Thayer of Massachusetts, rising to a

would be considered derelict In his duty
if he would go home to get in his win

he would return when six or seven men
who, he said, constituted Congress, should
announce that something was to be done.
The Speaker suggested that the ques
tion hardly amounted to a faint assault
upon the dignity of a parliamentary In
quiry. Payne observed that he was about
to request unanimous consent that the
gentleman from Massachusetts be ex
cu&ed for the remainder of the session.
Payne the^n introduced the bill to make
effective the Cuban reciprocity conven
tion, which, without objection, was read
by title and referred to the Committee on

the House to-day introduced a

and had it referred to his committee. He
said that it could be reported, at once.
John Sharp Williams, the minority lead
er, gave indication that the Democrats in
tended to delay action. The bill is in a
form satisfactory to leaders of both
House and Senate and that section relat
ing to a possible reduction of duty "by
convention or treaty" during the time
the Cuban treaty Is in force is satisfac
tory to the House leaders, who insist that
it establishes the precedent that the Sen
ate cannot change tariff rates by treaty
without legislation by the House.
The Democrats will attempt to put on
a differential amendment, but whether
they can get enough Republicans to join
with them on this question Is still a mat
ter of doubt. William Alden Smith of
Michigan did not get the place he desired
on the Ways and Means Committee, but
it is not yet indicated that he will take
any action of reprisal by fighting Cuban
reciprocity. Friends of the administra
tion say that the only delay expected in
putting the treaty immediately into force
will be in the Senate, where the rules will
permit the minority to prolong the die
cuss-ion.

It Is reported from Washington that the

on his acceptance of "courtesies" from

All Congressmen are given passes by the
railroads. That fact- was brought out
with sufficient clearness in the Baltimore

But up to date Congressman Baker Is the
only member of either house who Â¦ Is

Americans, however critical, have a way
of doing things in public without the
sense of measure. We whoop a man to
a dizzy height for nothing and drop him
for the same reason. Suppose a good
humored grocer should make a great deal
of money, use it to pay a Prince's debts,
get thus into the faster wing of British
society, acquire a title, buy a lot of
yachts and show equanimity in- defeat,
a certain reward should normally be his.
Unless, however; he has more than money
and cheerfulness, need he become a pub
lic personage and the cynosure of every
eye? Is it dignified that he be looked
upon as a national figure or the nation's
guest, as Mr. Chamberlain would be, M.
de Witte or II. Waldeck-Rousseau? Even,
we will say, as Meredith, Ibsen or Tolstoi
might be? Is there not a greater trail of
Barnumlsm in our cities than we need,
with all due . appreciation of that illus
trious exponent of ; publicity? We - read
with resignation that a marrying Duke
has Importuned his solicitors to make sure
of a more liberal settlement from his pur
chaser than was : secured a few years
ago by a predecessor. We are also will
ing to read with resignation a few vhun
dred columns about the good humor of a

these gentlemen, to shake them from their

PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 12.â Arra B.
Chutglan, now a resident of Pittsburg,
the young brother of Rev. Q. B. .Chut
glan, who was murdered in the streets of
Odessa, Russia, in daylight last July and
leader of the local Huntschagonlst revo
lutionary branch of the Armenian patri
ots, to-day received advices of another
massacre by Turkish soldiers of bands of
Armenians in Asia Minor. The butcheries [
occurred, according to Chutgian, about
eight days ago In the city of Bayazid, at
the foot of Mount Ararat. In discussing
the assassinations, Chutglan said:
"The first band of Armenians, which was
about one hour in advance of the second
band, was attempting to reach Asia Minor
from Russian domain in order to afford
pome relief to the suffering Armenian
farmers In that territory. It was made
up of some fifteen members, and really
acted In the capacity of a scouting party
for the much larger band following. En
trance from Russian to Turkish domain
Is obtainable only by means of two passes,
each fortified by strong blockhouses.
"The Turkish soldiers were informed that
the advance body of the relief band was ;
coming and the Information was fur
nished by men of the opposition party of
our society. In any event, when the'band
arrived at the blockhouse all were killed.
It was simply a cold-blooded butchery.
No one was spared and the second band
halted some distance from the frontier,
fearing that their friends had fallen Into
the hands of the Turkish Boldlers. The
latter went out to meet tne second ex
pedition and killed many of them. Much
money and everything Intended for Ar
menian relief was confiscated by" the
Turkish soldiers."
- Chutglan explained to-day that the Ar3
menlan relief parties from Russian prov
inces simply desired to aid suffering Ar
menians In the Mount Ararat district,
owing to the heavy crop failures last sea
son. "Winter in that section Is now at Its
height and the" bitter cold is working
great devastation among the Turkish Ar
menian subjects, who are reported this
winter to be almost destitute. The TurR
ish soldiers on the frontier refuse to allow
any aid to reach the interior, Chutglan
says.

In the Chamber of -Deputies to-day
there was a further discussion of the war
budget An amendment proposing the
suppression of court-martial was rejected,
325 to 24. During the debate there was
a violent altercation between Henri Mau

Georges Berthoulat, Independent Repub

the Chamber to suspend the sitting for a
few minutes. A duel has been arranged
between Bertaux and Berthoulat.
After some desultory discussion the Sen

When the session of the Senate was re
sumed M. Denoix proposed that debates
be adjourned until the Government, bill
forbidding primary secondary and supe
rior teaching of all' members of the con
gregations was brought In. The proposal
was rejected, 141 to 135.
Combes' declaration made a deep im
pression and the session of the Senate was
suspended to permit conferences.
PARIS, Nov. 12.â The Senate was crowd
ed to-day, owing to the expectation that
Premier Combes would make a declara
tion of the further purposes of the Gov
ernment concerning the religious orders.
Contrary to the opinion. Waldeck-Rous
seau, the former Premier, announced his
opposition to the governmental proposi-.
,tion to forbid teaching by those who had
taken the vow of celibacy.
Combes declared the Government accept
ed the principle of the proposition, but
said it Intended bringing in a general
project of law forbidding primary, second
ary and superior teaching to all members
of congregations. Concerning members
of the secular clergy, the Government re
served its course until a determination of
the question of the separation of church
and state had been expressed. It was his
earnest wish to speedily conclude the en
tire teaching question, so that the country
might again be tranqullized.

The following report was submitted last
night by the committee of the Building
Trades Council' appointed to Investigate
the charges made by M. C. Haybl against
P. H. McCarthy:
Your committee appointed to formulate thÂ«
findings oÂ£ the council upon the facts given, la
evidence at the Investigation In open session
of the council of the charges made by M. C.
Haybl and published In the prÂ»sa of October
31, 1903. against P. H. McCarthy, beg leave
to report as follows:
First â From the testimony of M. C. Haybl
we find there was no foundation in fact for the
charges made by him, but the said charges
were bastd upon partisan political campaign
rumors and are false in every particular. Sec
ond â We find that an attempt was made
through the press to show the public that the
council was, through P. H. McCarthy, presi
dent of the council, behind the candidacy of
K. E. SchmlU; that in order to show that the
members of the council and its affiliated
unions were free to support by voice and vote
whomever they saw fit. President McCarthy,
over his signature on October r.Â», 1003, stated
that the persons connected with the building
industry were fully capable of thinking and
speaking for themselves, hence Mr. McCar
thy's statement, while expressing his individ
ual views, showed absolutely the freedom of the
council and its affiliated unions as organiza
tions from partisan politics.
Third â The Building Trades Council and its
affiliated unions, as labor organizations, have
had nothing to do with the nomination of any
candidate for any public office. The council,
during the election, and all past elections, has
strictly refrained from participating in parti
san politics. The individual members, at all
times, exercise their constitutional rights, fol
lowing their political beliefs, without interfer
ence from the council. Those who are charged
with the guidance of an organization of the
magnitude and success of this council are sub
ject, at all times, to the attacks of designing
politicians, supported by men who are its
enemies, and are desirous of sowing the seed
of dissension within its ranks, which if allowed
to go unchallenged would have & disastrous
effect upon this council, which has done and
is now doing so much for every person con
nected with organized labor in this city. In
conclusion we desire to express our unquali
fied and unlimited confidence in our worthy
president, P. H. McCarthy, because we recog
nize in him one who has done more than any
other living man to bring the council and its
affilating unions to their high standard of ex
cellence, and to whom every man connected
with the building industry owes a debt of
gratitude for faithful services in securing
Increased wages and decreased hours, and who
has been their fearless champion In not only
protecting the council from the attacks of Its
enemies, but has preserved It a clean, noble
and honest organization, to the mutual benefit
of Its members and the community at large
Respectfully submitted.

It merely that he might have it on the
calendar and be prepared to urge It if he
deemed It advisable. It is understood that
action will hardly be taken on the Mil
prior to the Presidential campaign.
A large number of bills were then pre
sented, and when the order of business
was passed there was a brief executive
session, after which the Senate adjourned
until next Monday.
Hale took the position that thÂ© question
of Smoot's eligibility had been improperly
raised at this time. He referred briefly
to the moral aspects of the Smoot case,
and said that, grave as they were, they
were not more important than the "intru
sion of a great religious hierarchy like
the Mormon church Into the political af
fairs of the country." He suggested to
the Senate the importance of not pre
judging the case.
HALE SUPPORTS HOAR.
Replying to Dubois' argument Hoar
said that in his remarks yesterday he
had merely called the attention of some
of his own constituents to the fact that
they are pointing out to the Senate their
determination of a Judicial question In
regard to which the Senators are the
Judges. He again compared the Senate to
the Supreme Court, and added that he
had addressed the Senate upon thÂ© sub
ject not because he considered it a mat
ter of small moment, but because of Its
vast importance, and because of Its im
portance he thought It most desorabls
that the Senate should approach the sub
ject In the proper way.
Hoar replied that he did not believe any
member of the Committee on Privileges
and Elections would find it necessary to
make a public display of his attachment
to the family tie, as established in all
Christian countries and so signally mani
fested in Its beauty In our own country,
and he expressed his surprise that any
Senator could consider It necessary to
present his views on thÂ© subject. How
ever, he said, that was a question for
members to decide for themselves.
Dubois said in closing that Instead of
discouraging the Christian people of the
country in giving vent to their opinions
In the shape of petitions on the subject,
he would like to have them encouraged in
that direction. Ji\ vv
HOAR GROWS IRONICAL.
"I contend," he said, "that these various
organizations of Christian men and wom
en have a right to petition the Senate. Of
course, we will appreciate that this is a
judicial question, which must be deter
mined by the facts, but it is not an idle
question and It is properly before the Sen
ate. It is the same question that was in
volved in the case of the polygamous
Roberts, for whose unseating by the
House of Representatives many petitions
were filed." All the petitioners ask is that
we. study the case carefully before pass
ing upon it. They know what they are
doing. . They represent the moral thought
of the country, and should not be discour
aged. They scarcely expect to influence
our votes, but it is to be hoped that the
petitions will at least . have the effect of
causing us to pause and givÂ© careful at
tention to their representations.
"If the allegations now on file with the
Committee on Privileges - and Elections
can be proved, I do not believe there is a
Senator herÂ© who would vote to have Mr.
Smoot continued in his seat; but if they
arc not proved I think we would all unite
In asking him to remain."
HAVE BIGHT TO PETITION.
WASHINTON, Nov. 12.â Immediately
upon assembling to-day the Senate
plunged into a discussion of the question
of the eligibility of Reed Smoot of Utah
to a seat in the Senate. The debate grew
out of 'the remarks made, yesterday by
Hoar that petitions bearing 'upon Smoot' s
case were as much out of place as similar
petition* to the Supreme Court of the
United States would be in the Interest of
any case before that tribunal.
Dubols of Idaho took issue to-day with
Hoar and presented his yjews in connec
tion with the petitions for Smoot's expul
sion, which were presented by himself.
After announcing that his views differed
from those of Hoar as to the propriety of
the petitions on this subject, Dubols pro
ceeded.

so when a rival power hears of a vessel
bearing a certain name and known to
have been a first class battleship it is not
known whether the vessel bearing the
same name is a coal carrier or a torpedo
boat destroyer. The Russian Government
has adopted these tactics to avoid public

WASHINGTON. Nov. 12.â Democratic
Senators have determined to oppose the
ratification of a canal treaty with the
new republic of Panama should
the administration enter upon treaty ne
gotiations with that country. The Demo
cratic steerinc committee is said to be
unanimous in condemnation of the recog
nition the United States has given to the
creation of a new government on the
isthmus, though the announcement has
been madÂ« that no course cf opposition
has been definitely adopted. It has been
learned on the authority of a member
of the Democratic steering committee
that the sentiment is to attack any effort
to open negotiations with the new re
public and go before the country In sup
port of the Spooner act, to show that
the party is not antagonistic to the
building of a canal.

then quickly followed.
The organization was carried on secret

land on the isthmus and precipitate the
revolution on November 1. Vessels were
in waiting, and the filibusters were to set

ammunition and arms had been sent in

work of organization was secretly begun.
The leader carried recommendations from
practically every officer of the Seventh
Army Corps, which served in the Spanish
war, and also from four Governors of

was to organize a force to patrol the

gency appear. Other reports received
from the department commanders indi
cate that within a few days something
like 20,000 men could be in readiness for
service. It was declared, however, that
unless there were Indications of serious
trouble on the isthmuB, such as would be
caused by a declaration of war by Colom
bia or the interference of some outside
nation, no further orders would be issued.
It was said by officers of the War De-,
partment that, while there seemed to be
ho Immediate need of troops on the isth
mus,, it was the intention to be prepared
for any emergency that might arise and
that the present activity in army quar
ters was due entirely to a desire to be In
a etate of preparedness.- While the of
ficials would not concede that they looked
for any foreign interference on the isth
mus?, it was learned that orders had gone
forth to a!l military department com
manders to get their troops into shape to
be called out at a moment's notice.

DOAN'S KIDNEY PILLS.
DOST OVERLOOK THIS
A Careful Fenual Will Prove Its Value
to Every San Prancisco Header.
The average man is a doubter, and
there Is little wonder that this is so.
.M isrepresentations make people skeptics.
Nowadayrtbe public ask for better evi-
dence than the testimony of strangers.
Here is proof which should convince
every San Francisco reader.
George Merrill, starter at the Sutter-
street Railway Company's barn, resi-
dence 2630 Sutter street, says: 'To say
I greatly value Doan's Kidney Pills
mildly expresses my opinion of them. It
is six months since I took a course of
the treatment, and it did exactly what I
wanted and did it very quickly. It stop-
ped backache, from which I had suffered
far too long to be pleasant. My advice
to any one suffering from backache or
who are subject to kidney complaint Is
to use Doan's Kidney Pills according to
directions. The long-looked-for results
will undoubtedly follow."

A TEST EXPERIMENT.
Peculiar Power Possessed by a New
Medicine.
Of new discoveries there la no end, but
one of the most recent, most remarkable
and one that will prove Invaluable to
thousands of people Is a discovery which
it is believed will take the place of all
other remedies for the cure of those com-
mon and obstinate diseases, dyspepsia and
stomach troubles. This discovery Is not a
loudly advertised, secret patent medicine,
but is a scientific combination of whole-
some, perfectly harmless vegetable es-
Eences, fruit salts, pure pepsin and bis-
muth.
These remedies are combined In lozenge
form, pleasant to take and will preserve
their good qualities indefinitely, whereas
all liquid medicines rapidly lose whatever
good qualities they may have bad as soon
as uncorked and exposed to the air.
This preparation is called Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, and it is claimed that one
of these Tablets or lozenges will digest
from SCO to 3000 times its own weight of
meat, eggs and other wholesome food.
And this claim has been proven by actual
experiments in the following manner: A
hard boiled egg cut into small pieces was
placed in a bottle containing warm water
heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat): one of these Tablets was then
placed In the bottle and the proper tem-
perature maintained for three hours and
a hjvlf, at the end of which time the egg
was as completely digested as It would
have been in a healthy stomach. This ex-
periment was undertaken to demonstrate
that what it would do in the bottle it
would also do in the stomach, hence its
unquestionable value In the cure of dys-
pepsia and weak digestion. Very few
people are free from some form of Indi-
gestion, but scarcely two will have the
same symptoms. Some will suffer most
from distress after eating, bloating from
gas in the stomach and bowels; others
have acid dyspepsia or heartburn; others
palpitation or headache, sleeplessness,
pains in chest and under shoulder blades,
extreme nervousness as in nervous dys-
pepsia, but they all have the same cause-
failure to properly digest what is eaten.
The stomach must have rest and assist-
ance, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give
it both by digesting the food for It. and in
a short time It Is restored to Its normal
action and vigor. At the same time the
Tablets are so harmless that a child can
take them with benefit. This new prepa-
ration has already made many astonishing
cures, as, for Instance, the following:
After using only one package of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets I have received
such great and unexpected benefit that I
wish to express my sincere gratitude. In
fact, it has been six months since I took
the package, and I have not had one par-
ticle of distress or difficulty since. And all
this in the face of the fact that the best
doctors I consulted told me my case was
Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely incura-
ble, as I had suffered twenty-five years.
I distributed half a dozen packages among
my friends here, who are very anxious to
try this remedy.

VANCOUVER, B. C. Nov. 1Zâ A re
markable piece of antique carving, which
must be close upon one thousand years
old, was dug up to-day in the making of
an excavation in the center of Vancouver.
It seemingly had been made at some
primeval date by Indians.
The carving is of brown sandstone and
the work must have been done with a
sharp piece of flint or slate. It is about
ten inches long and three wide and
weighs three pounds. Its two sections are
united by a thin slice of the stone. One
section is a bowl and ' the other is a
carving of a bear's head. The long snout,
the mouth and eyes are so cleverly carved
as to be easily recognizable as an Imita
tion of a bear's head.
But the details of the finding: of the
relic are most Interesting. It was under
the decayed stump of an Immense cedar
tree. The stump looked as If It had been
dead nearly a hundred years and it must
have been growing for five or six cen
turies at least. The \ carving was imme
diately below the heart of the tree, so
that It may have been made by some In
dustrious native of bygone times, who
lived ages before this tree began to grow.

SURGEONS FEAR KAISER

Experience Great ' Difficulty in En

BERLIN, Nov. 12.â The greatest diffi
culty of Emperor William's physicians Is
to keep him from overtaxing his voice.
They have ruled that he must only whis
per a little, and, while he Is not forget
ful of their command, he whispers a good
deal and occasionally utters an exclama
tion.
State business is piling up. Various
matters In which the Emperor Is person
ally Interested are developing: and he. Is
unable to- discuss them, but he listens
to the views and writes . suggestions,
though the pencil runs too slowly and he
breaks out occasionally with whispered
remarks pitched near the surgeons' dan
ger line. No special harm has been done
yet. but as time passes the Emperor's im
patience Increases.

FEDERAL COURT UPHOLDS . :
ACT OF TOBACCO COMPANY
Decides That It Had the Legal Right
to Refuse to Sell Its
Goods.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 12.â The United States
Court of Appeals decided to-day that the
Continental Tobacco Company did , not
violate the Interstate commence law of
the anti-trust law when it refused to
sell Joseph P. Whitwell, a St. Paul to
bacco dealer, its manufactured product.
The court says:
The tobacco company and its competitors
were cot dealers in articles of prime necessity,
as corn or meal, nor were they rendering pub
lic or quasi public service, like a railroad
company. Each of them, therefore, has the
right to refuse to sell Its commodities at any
price.
The court goes further and says that
the acts of the tobacco company are noth
ln/r more nor less "than the lawful exer
cise of their unquestioned rights, which
are indispensable to the existence of com
petition or the conduct of trade."
Judge Sanborn wrote the opinion, which
was concurred in by Judges Thayer and
Vandevanter.

Professor McAdle of the weather bu

of the most peculiar that he has ever ob
served. It appeared heavy and of con
siderable extent In the morning, but
later in the day It divided. One storm
went east at the rate of nearly eighty
miles an hour and the other circled over
Eastern California and Nevada. What
rain fell In San Francisco was only a few
drops from the ragged edge of the main
storm.
McAdie states that clouds bearing: an
immense amount of moisture passed over
the city last night on their way to Ne
vada. The winds raged and the floods de
scended all day in the sagebrush State.
The rainfall at the Farallones was .01 of
an inch, in San Francisco .06 of an Inch
and on Mount Tamalpais more than an
inch and a half. The storm had not
reached Fresno at 5 o'clock last night,
but the forecaster predicts rain for the
south for to-day. In this city the weath
er will be a little clearer to-day, but an
other storm is thought to be on the way
here.

CHICAGO, Nov. 12. â Constant
scenes of disorder throughout a
district approximately of fifty
square miles in extent resulted to-
day from the Institution of - the
strike by employes of one of the two
principal surface street railway companies
in Chicago. All along the lines, wherever
cars were started, strike sympathizers
made desperate onslaughts upon the
crews, beginning at dawn of day and con
tinuing as long as cars remained on the
tracks. The tie-up was made complete.
A number of cars were wrecked, and
that no person was killed was no fault of
the rioters. One man's back was broken.
The first shot of tha strike was fired at
Wentworth avenue and West Sixty-ninth
street, where several hundred persons
tried to hold up a train. - â¢
Many persons, chiefly non-union Btreet
car men, were injured by flying stones or
splintered glass. Two women were
among those hurt.
Excepting a few dozen passengers, who
had to flee from the cars, the 300,000 daily
patrons of the company were forced to
try all sorts of other methods in order to
get down town and buck.
MAYOR HARRISON NEUTRAL,
With faces and hands bleeding from the
attacks by strikers, the motormen, grip
men and conductors who tried . to run
trains entered the barns and refused to
go out again unless the trains bore pla
toons of policemen or patrol wagons were
alongside. The police confined their ef
forts to seeing that the passage of cars
from, the barn was unobstructed and that
crowds and. blockades In the streets were
cleared away. This was done under or
ders from Mayor Harrison, whose an
nounced purpose was to preserve an Im
partial attitude, taking sides neither for
nor against the strikers or the street car
company, which, though known as the
Chicago City Railway, is a private cor
poration. Its lines extend through the
south side of the city, radiating from the
business center.
Developments regarding the action of
the municipal administration hinge large
ly upon a new official, Herman F. Schut- ;
tler, who to-day, under appointment by
the Mayor, assumed the duties of Assist
ant Chief of Police. Schuttler will be In
direct charge of police arrangements dur
ing the contest. . His duties heretofore
have been restricted to the north side of
the city, a section entirely removed from
the scene of the present difficulty and not'
penetrated by. the lines of the city rail
way. Schuttler is the man who tracked
and arrested Anarchist Louis* Linng after
the Haymarket riot and subsequently sent
Adolph Luetgert, the wealthy sausage
manufacturer, to die, under conviction of
wife murder. Schuttler is about 6 feet 4
Inches tall. He has a remarkable record
for -personal daring and astuteness.
TALK OF INTERVENTION.
The possibility of Federal' Intervention,
under certain conditions, is being dis
cussed. The situation In this respect was
outlined to-day Â¦ by Postmaster Coyne,
who said: â¢ .o
Thus far there U no cause for alarm as. to
the mall service. It Is true trains have been
delayed, but that is not serious enough to re
port to Washington. The street car company
owns the mail cars, and by contract Is obliged
to run them in separate trains and deliver
mall at specified points. There'll no ground
for objection against the company sending out
mall trains between passenger trains What
else can the company do? If serious delay
occurs we will report the fact to" Washington
and act on , instructions rroin tha â¢ Postofnce
Department. *.â¢â¢â¢. .
Before nightfall President D. 1 G. Ham
ilton and General Counsel i Bliss of the
railway, company, after -â¢ endeavoring to
operate cars in defiance of the trainmen,
announced after a conference with Mayor
Harrison that the attempt would be aban
doned for the day. The railway officials
declare that 30 per cent of their employes
are loyal, and that if accorded sufficient
protection by the Police Department the
company will be able to man and ope
rate its cars. A further effort to run cars,
each car accompanied by a squad of po
lice in a patrol wagon, will be made, it is
expected, to-morrow.
WAGONS REPLACE CARS.
As a result of the tie-up of the surface
lines, the elevated and steam roads tra
versing the strike bounds were taxed to
their utmost capacity. Train service on
all lines was doubled and an effort made
to accommodate the thousands of addi
tional passengers. Meanwhile bus lines,
hacks and express wagons with Impro
vised seats did a thriving business In
transporting passengers.
The strike is the outcome of persistent
demands for increased wages. To-day
about 3000 men, practically the entire
forces of the company's wage earners,
were idle, the number at any time run
ning cars being but a small fraction of
the number usually at work.
The company's stationary firemen, who
also have presented demands upon the
company for increased wages, and to
whom the trainmen looked for assistance,
declined to go out, expressing their belief,
after a conference with General Manager
McCulloch of the railway company, that
he had not refused arbitration.
The committee representing the firemen
offered Its services to the company as
mediators. Whether or not the offer will
be accepted has not been decided. Â¦
WILL START CARS TO-DAY.
The attempt to run passenger trains
with non-union crews was abandoned dur
ing the afternoon and, with the excep
tion of the mall car service, which was
carried out according to the regular
schedule, traffic on all lines controlled by
the company was at a complete stand
still. According to statements made by
the officials to-night, as many trains as
can be manned by non-union crews will
be pressed into service for the early morn
ing rush to-morrow. Each train will
carry a half dozen policemen as a body
guard to protect the crews from the vio
lence of strike sympathizers.
Derogatory remarks regarding the un
ion by an armed non-union employe of
the company caused a riot at Thirty
sixth and State streets to-night. The
man was chased Into a store near by and
before the police could reach the spot
a -mob of 2000 persons surrounded the
place, howling for the life of the refugee.
A squad of police, after a great deal of
difficulty, finally quelled the disturbance
and removed the man to a place of safety.
Although the full list of the Injured in
the street car strike rioting to-day is un
doubtedly large, the police secured the
names only of those whose wounds were
of- a serious nature.' The most serious
cases probably are those of H. S. Orton,
a conductor, who was beaten while try-
Ing, to run a Cottage Grove-avenue cable
train, and his grlpman, William Watson.
Besides being hit by missiles, these men
were dragged from, their car by the riot
ers and beaten. Orton may not live.
Albert < Barren, a non-union â¢ motorman
on the Wentworth-avenue line, was taken
to his home unconscious from having
been hit 1 on the head with a brick, but
he will recover. Two men at the Seventy
seventh-street barns were badly bruised
by: missiles: thrown by rioters.

LOCAL BUTCHERS AID
LOS ANGELES STRIKERS
Marine Cooks Pass Resolutions of
B-egret for Pour Departed
Members.
The local Butchers' Union last night
donated an additional $100 toward aiding
their striking brethren in Los Angeles. A
few days ago the union donated a similar
amount to the same cause. It was de
cided by the executive committee of the
union to issue white union cards for the
months of November and December. On
and after January the due of the Butch
ers' Union will be 75 cents a month.
The Marine Cooks' Union met last night
and adopted resolutions of regret for the
death of four of their comrades, who
perished on the Ill-fated steamer South
Portland. Following are the resolutions
adopted:
Resolved. That In the death of 'William T.
Coleman. George Gould, Benjamin Lewen and
J. Wright, the Marine Cooks 1 and Stewards'
Association of the Pacific has lost members
ftaiich in their adherence to union principles
and loyal to their obligations of personal
friendship, worthy comrades and true men;
and be it further
Resolved. By the member* of this associa

tend to the bereaved relatives of the deceased
our tilncerest sympathy.
At a. meeting of the Building Trades
Council the strike of the workmen em
ployed In the various planing mills of
Stockton was discussed. It was decided
to take immediate action in the case, as
reports show that the strike has injured
union men and the planing mill industry
In this city.

PUEBLO. Colo., Nov. 12.â Official con
firmation of the rumors that have been
prevalent for some time. In effect that
the Mlnnequa plant of the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company would be clpsed on
Saturday, was had to-night in a state
ment from Vice President Wellborn, who
said:
Owing to the strike we have found it nec
essary to close & portion of our Pueblo plant.
ThlÂ» will be done on Saturday night. We have
not decided yet Just what departments will
be closed or how many men will be laid off.
We hope to be able to start them again in a
few days at the farthest. There is nothln*
r.ew in the strike situation from our point of
view. . v
Notices were posted to-day in most of
the departmsnts of the big plant that the
men would receive their pay up to date
by calling at the office. It is expected
that all of the departments, with the ex
ception of one blast furnace, the machine
shops and the wire mills, will be closed
on Saturday night.
The coal supply within the fence of the
plant is about 30,000 tons, which Is less
than three weeks' supply for the entire
plant. Not enough coal is being received
to warrant continuing the various depart
ments In operation.
Until recently about 6000 men have been
employed at the plant. Although no
statement has been made as to the num
ber that will be affected by the suspension
of operations, a conservative estimate

TACOXIA, Wash., Nov. 12.â R. A. Fal
coner, an old miner of Aberdeen, in this
State, is organizing an expedition of 100
men with the double object of conquer
ing the natives on a cannibal Island on
the Mexican coast and exploring the isl
and, which is supposed to be rich in gold.
According to reports, the island is ex
ceedingly difficult of >access, its inhabi
tants having killed and eaten every white
man who has visited their shores within
the memory of man. Falconer declares
he has secured the necessary consent
from the Mexican Government, together
with a promise of a bonus payable In
silver if the island is subdued. Falconer
places the bonus, at $1,000,000. He has
signed fifty-three men and will get the
balance this week from a long list of
applicants. He accepts only hardened
miners and -woodsmen inured to hard
ships. The party will be thoroughly
armed, its equipment including two
Maxim rapid-fire guns and one Gatling.
Falconer believes the island is rich In
gold and that the natives can be Â«on
quered . providing, his expedition is able
to make a landing. He is now In corre
spondence with Washington authorities
with the object of securing permission to
embark on such an expedition.

BOSTON, Nov. 12.--President Roose
vtifs name and his action in the so-called
Miller "open shop" cise were brought be
fore tltf convention Â«f the American Fed
eration of Labor to-4ay, when several del
egates criticized hi* decision not to dis
criminate against ton-union labor in Fed
eral employment. .The question came be
fore the convention from the committee
on resolutions is the form of a report
that a resolutioa on the "open shop" is
sue be referred Â¦ to the committee of the
executive cour^ll. The substance of the
resolution was that the "open shop,"
whether under private or Government
control, "cannot be recognized by orga
nized labor."
Delegate J. M. Barnes of Philadelphia,
president of the Clgarmakers' Interna
tional Urion, declared that President
Roosevelt's decision was a "slap In the
face" for laboring people.
President D. A. Hays of the Interna
tional Association of Glassblowers defend
ed the President's action. Eventually the
resolution was committed to the commit
tee from which it originated.
A resolution was adopted urging that
the Government construct all its ships in
Government yards, on the ground that
such a policy was fairer to labor.
The preamble to the "open shop" reso
lution indicated that it was based upon
the Miller case, prowing out of trouble in
ihe Government Printing Office in Wash
ington. A motion was made, and later
withdrawn, that the resolution be taken
up by the convention ss a whole. First
Vice President James Duncan of Wash
ington advocated the acceptance of the
i-ommittw's report. Delegate Barnes of
Philadelphia, president of the Clgarmak
ers' International Union, said President
Roosevelt's decision that the "open shop"
must be maintained in all cases of Fed
eral employment was a "slap in the face"
for laboring people.
Another delegate held that a public
"open shop" conducted by President
Roosevelt was just as bad as a private
'"open shop" conducted by President Par
ry of the National Manufacturers' Asso
ciation.
President Hays of the International As.
pociation of Glassblowcrs said he was
convinced that any delegate In the con
vention would act just as President
Roosevelt had done under the circum
stances. A motion that the subject be
K'ubmitted to the commute on resolutions
was adopted.
Bricklayers Go Out on Strike.
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â Work on build
ings in course of construction by the
Fuller Construction Company in this cily
has been stepped abruptly by a strike of
union bricklayers. Pending adjustment
of the difficulty all work of the company
is= at a standstill and nearly 1000 men are
idle. The men assert that the company
has sublet some work to a concern which
it declared "unfair." The offlciaJs say
they will make no effort to employ non
union men.
MOSCOW, Nov. 12,â General Dragomir
off, the retired Governor General of Kleff,
has left here for his estates, the Czar hav
ing no further use for his services. The
circumstances of the summary dismissal
of General Dragomiroff have just leaked
out They strikingly Illustrate the hu
manitarian ideas of the Russian ruler.
Dragomiroff lost favor and his office be
cause he did not show moderation In quel
ling the recent strike riots at Kleff, which
practically Involved all the working peo
ple of the town. Hearing that the strik
ers might cause a repetition of the Kish
inev scenes, Dragomiroff called out the
artillery and caused a wholesale slaughter
of the rioters. It is said several hundred
of them were killed. When the Czar heard
the facts he at once dismissed Drago
mirofl with the words: "I cannot have
that man at Kieff any longer. His hands
are stained with human blood."
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 12.â The result
of the inquiry instituted by the Czar into
the cause of the increasing poverty of
the peasantry has been published. It is
a highly Important document, and In a
supplement to the Czar's manifesto on
civil and religious rights it recommends
the education of the peasants.
The commission appointed to carry out
the inquiry was thoroughly representa
tive, containing village elders and landed
proprietors as well as Government offi
cials. They attribute the* decline In pres
ent prosperity to oppressive passport reg
ulations, labor restrictions and lack of
education.

There another brother met the widower
with a Bhowlng that Mrs. Frledlander's
share In her father's estate had long since
been paid to her and that there was noth
ing due her estate, as a pro rata division
had been made. That ended the search.
Herold still feels bitterly toward his
brother-in-law and exults In the failure
of the Eastern Journey.
Subsequently Herold made a .fight in
tho Probate Court against Friedlander'9
petition to be appointed administrator of
his wife's estate, but the brother lost and
the husband was appointed. According to
Herold tho husband obtained $300 or $400
and Boms Jewelry that had belonged to
Mrs. Frlendlander and then went to New
York City to claim the remainder of the
estate. \ .
Filled with disappointment at learning
that the supposed rich estate left by his
deceased wife did not exist, Harry Fried
lander, a olano salesman, has returned
from a fruitless Journey to New -York.
His failure to realize has been reported
to I. II. Herold, a jeweler at 622 East
Twelfth street, a brother of the dead wife,
Bessie Herold Friedlander, who was mys
teriously drowned from the steamer Arc
tio last April while on her wedding trip.
At the time of her marriage the young
woman was an heiress, It was said, to a
share In her father's estate, which was
valued at $30,000. After her marriage to
Friedlander, which was decidedly , dis
tasteful to the young bride's Oakland rel
ative, the brother made much ado about
It and was seriously unstrung when the
news of the strange death reached' him.
The girl disappeared from the steamer
and was not missed for several hours.
Neither the suddenly bereft husband nor
any of the ship's company could find a

terms of affection' by which she said he
won her love. Her story was corrobo
rated in part by Mrs. Rose Davis, a sis
ter.
\ Miss Lanlgan's eight-months-old baby
was an exhibit in the case. Mrs. Doherty,
the plaintiff's mother, testified that she
knew' Neeley twenty-five years ago, and
that he then had hair of the same red
shade ns that adorning the babe's head.
The attorneys hope they will be able to
submit the case to the Jury by Monday
afternoon. ..

Mrs. A. M. Werum, president of the

pointed a general committee of arrange
ments and' this committee has charge of
all of the details of the affair for next
Wednesday night. This committee Is com
posed of Mrs. Julius Seulberger, chair
man; Mrs. A. Schlueter, Mrs. C. G.

Mrs. C. Hesse and Miss M. Harding.
and will be one of the most Im
portant of the charitable events of the
Vrtnter J-season. -TÂ£rv ; ball always com
mands attention from the entire popula
tion upon this side of the bay, and not
alone from the German colony, and this
year it will be more attractive than ever:
The ladies of. the society have deter
mined upon a new move this year. Old
Germania Hall is to be abandoned, and
the ball is to be held In an uptown hall.
Germania Hall was for years the center
of festivity in Oakland, but Oakland has
grown beyond the old building, and the
ladies of the German .society finally de
termined that they would have to aban
don the locatityj and go where society
dictates. The result Is that after a quar
ter ofa century of the existence of this
society they have been compelled to aban
don their old home, and move uptown
with the general trend of both society and
business.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The right of way committee has in
hnnd a detailed statement which will
show the names of the land owners
through whose properties the boulevard
Â¦will run, with the names of those hold
ers who have agreed to give deeds for
right cf way and of those who demand
payment for the strips that will be re
quired. The Supervisors are hopcTul that
actual work of construction can be, com
menced as soon as the rains *cease.
Euch progress has bocn made by the
committee In charge of .selecting the route
through the foothills for the projected
scenic boulevard from FVuitvale to Hay
wards thaX the three commissioners have
announced that the riglzts of way have
been signed Â»up for almost the entire four
teen miles. In fact, a, report is in prep
aration for the early- submission to the
Board of Supervisors.
T. B. Parsons of Castro Valler, A.
Cary of San Leandro and E. C. Prcther,
County Surveyor, comprise the commit
tee of viewers in charge of the selection
vf the route. They have outlined in con
nection with Ih* provisional plans of the
board a highway eighty feet wide fol
lowing the contour of the foothills and
at a sufficient aJtitnde to Insure a su
perb view along the entire route. It Is
estimated that three years will be re
quired to construct the boulevard and
that the cast will be from $230,000 to
â¬250,000.

in Preparation.
The delay is caused largely by the lack
of cars. The original order of the com
pany for cars was supposed to be large
enough to equip the lines to Berkeley,
Piedmont and Oakland, but it has been
found necessary to make a second order
that completely duplicated the first that
was given. Until the second order of
cars arrives the Berkeley service will be
given the preference over that from
either Oakland or Piedmont
Meanwhile it is becoming evident that
it will be some time before the regular
service of the new system will be ex
tended beyond Berkeley. The Oakland
service la by a swing car only, and the
rails of the new line have not yet been
laid to Piedmont.

Total for seven days, $4153 10.
This represents almost exclusively a
travel that was Impelled by curiosity.
A little of that travel, which came from
Berkeley, might be considered regular,
but all that from Oakland was of the
excursion â¢type, as the large amount
taken In on Sunday, November 1, shows.
Exactly what the new system will do
can hardly be determined until commu
tation tickets are put on sale on De
cember 1.
The San 'Francisco, Oakland and San
Joso Railroad, which Is the cumbersome
official title of the new ferry system, has
Issued a statement of the earnings of
the new line for the first week of Its
operation. During this week only hourly
trips were made and only single tickets
were sold. The commutation service
will not be inaugurated until December
1 ; but since this statement was Issued a
half-hourly ferry servlco has been In
augurated. The statement Is as follows:

only the tax for State purposes was in
volved. By his action the the city of San
Jose will receive 524,000 In addition to
what would have been received In the
regular way. Suits are threatened, but
the lawyers seem to be at sea regarding
both municipal privileges and individual
rights. .

Equalization, which Imposed an addition
al State tax of 15 cents on each 5100 worth
of taxable property. The Auditor com
puted the tax so that it Included the city

was rushed - to the hospital, where a futile
effort was made to save bis life by ampu
tating both legs close to the hips.

PORTLAND. Nov. 11-For three months
the local police have been awaiting the
arrival of the bark Professor Koch, in
order to arrest Max Dahms. an alleged
embezzler, from Berlin, Germanv, who
took passage in the vessel from Hamburg:.
When the Koch anchored here detectives
boarded her. but found that Dahms had
left the boat at Port Los Anseles.
The officers of the Professor Koch ad
mitted that Max Dahms did accompany
them from Hamburg anÂ«l that he was
neither a passenger nor member of. the
crew. They were willing to divulge very
little Information on the subject. Sailing
vessels are not permitted to carry pas
sengers and so Dahms signed to make
the voyage to America, but he was as
signed to no duty of any character.
The officers say that upon arriving at
Port Los Angeles Dahms went ashore
Rnd that was the last time thev'saw him.
From local police sources It Is gathered
that under the pretense of wanting money
as security to obtain a position in a Ber
lin bank Dahms Induced his wife to give
him 11,903 marks, or about $30CO In Ameri
can money. Then he is said to have de
camped on the Professor Koch and to
have started for the Pacific Coast.

H. Wittenberg, president *of the Pacific
Coast Biscuit Company of this city, when
seen to-day acknowledged that trouble is
brewing In the trade, but wonld not enter
Into particulars. The agreement entered
into by the combine, he said, has been
In part lived up to, but he Inferred that
there had been some breaks in the ranks.
The president of one of the largest con
cerns in San Francisco recently made a
visit to Portland and Seattle with the idea
In view, apparently, of trying to keep
everybody in line. His trip was not a
success and he returned to San Francisco
much disappointed with the results of his
effort.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 12.â Trouble is
again brewing in the biscuit business and
probably within the next few weeks
crackers will be selling on the Pacific
Coast at less than^cost.
More than a year and a half ago the
various biscuit companies of the Pacific
Coast came to an agreement as to the
selling price for their goods and what
was considered an Ironclad arrangement
between the parties Interested. Many
such agreements have come to grief, new
competitors entering the field.
A new plant has started up in Los An
geles, another in San Francisco, one in
Seattle av.d a new one in Spokane. All of
these companies cress each other's ter
ritory, and the new companies, not being
parties to the old agreement, have acted
as free lances and made their own prices.
This has brought about a strained condi
tion of affairs between the parties to the
agreement.

Those politicians who have been looking
for some Indication from Governor Pardee
as to his choice cf a candidate for War
den have been disappointed, the Governor
evidently having clung to his expressed
determination to leavÂ»Â» the choice of a
Warden to the State Board of Prison Di
rectors, the body responsible to him and
the people of the State for ths conduct of
the prison.
An Interesting incident of the present
week in connection with Folsom prison
affairs was the appearance of State Prison
Director R. T. Devlin before the Grand
Jury, in response to a request from that
body. Mr. Devils was asked to inform
the jury with respect to the responsibil
ities assumed by the directors and the
warden, and he made a detailed state
ment. At the same time he told the Jury
that a change In the wardenship was Im
pending, and members tjf the jury since
have said that in view of the approaching
change of administration they would
probably not include In their report their
intended sweeping condemnation of the
prison management as disclosed by cir
cumstances attending the big break at
the prison last July.
Tell Is at present the Assistant District
Attorney of Sacramento County. He is a
Democrat, a former District Attorney of
Mendocino County and served that county
with distinction in the Senate. His stand
ing at the local bar is high, and he is held
in resyect by all classes In the com
munity. As District Attorney of his for
mer home county and as a public prose
cutor here he has had opportunity to
study the criminal classes and he is
spoken of as a man of good habits, force
and determination.
The Sacramento people have been Inter
ested chiefly In the candidacy of Archi
bald Tell for the place, and the belief Is
strong here that he will be chosen. Mr.
Tell himself has preserved absolute
silence en the subject except to say that
he Is a candidate and that If chosen Be
will endeavor to give the State good ser
vice. He has declined to discuss his
chances, but from other sources It has
been learned that they are excellent. In
deed, some who keep In touch with polit
ical events assert their positive belief that
Yell will be elected to the waidenshlp at
Folsom 'at the next meeting of the Board
of Prison Directors.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 12â It has been
known for some time that a change was
about to occur In the wardenrhip of the
Folsom prison, and It has been understood
that the choice of Warden Thomas TTTl

prison directors before the close of the

A South American correspondent for tna

abuse of culnlne in fever countries:
Abuse of Quinine.
It seems that Apostle Grant, had trouble before, and five
years ago was convicted of polygamy and fined $500. Going
to the Mormon view of it as a" question of morals, we find
that proof of that which the law of his State makes a felony
did not injure Mr. Grant in the estimation of the church.
Is Unthinkable that the Methodists would take a man con
victed and runished; for bigamy and make him a Bishop, or
that any church called by the : Mormons Gentile would con
tinue to keep in place, promote or favor, with power in its
councils i. man so proved guilty? Every, one knows r this
could. not be so outside the Mormon church, and that it is
so inside, of Mofmonry reveals that community- in a light an
tagonistic, to the : law and dangerous to civilization. .Â»Â¦Â¦â¢'
WHEN Apostle Grant bragged to the alumni of
Utah University that he had a harem which he
would stock up better if the law would let him
he revealed the temper and secret purpose of the Mor
mon church to restore, polygamy whenever and wherever it
could evade the eye of the ltw. It was said that the
first presidency rebuked him for his imprudence, and. the
other eleven apostles were quite disturbed. But there is
no doubt that the church secretly regarded him as a hero
and the evangel of a good time coming, when an unlimited
number of wives would be the reward of the faithful."
But the law in Utah, though battered, is still in the
ring, and Apostle Grant , finds himself compelled to hide
from or face the service of a State's warrant in a criminal
proceeding to punish hinf for the crime of polygamy. Mor
mon sentiment has tempered the law to the shorn poly
gamist, and the punishment is light, being a fine of $300,
with alternative imprisonment. It is quite easy, still it may
restrain the ordinary lay members from keeping harems,
but it is little restraint upon the apostles, who can pay it
out of what Brigham Young called "the treasury of the
Lord."

COUNT CASSINI, the Russian Embassador to
Washington, has returned from a long vacation,
most of which he spent in Paris. He says truly that
his post is now regarded as the most important to Russia.
But he is surprised to finda palpable enmity in this coun
try toward the Government of the Czar. This he .quite
mistakenly ascribes to the Kishenev massacre of Jews.
( As far as the American people are concerned they joined
the humanity of the world in expressions of deprecation of
that fanatical crime, but it did not cause any settled en
mity to the Russian Government, which seemed to us to
take fairly prompt and certainly creditable measures to
punish the criminals in that affair and degrade the public
officials who should have prevented it. We furnish too
many illustrations of the violence of .racial and religious
prejudices in the midst of us to sit in stern judgment upon
other nations that arc subject to the same disorders. The
recent mobbing and murder of. inoffensive Chinese at
Tonopah, Nev., and the unlawful treatment of the same
people in this State, in Tuolumne County, not only infringe
the treaty rights of the Chinese, but deny the constitutional
rights of their American employers. So we are not unmind
ful of the beam in our own eye.
The growing enmity to Russia in this country has quite
another cause. Russia does not keep her word. She seems
guilty of a trick in\ joining the other powers in an agree
ment to evacuate China after the BoxeT troubles were over.
She waits until all the others are gone and then refuses to
go. She amends the date of. her departure and still stays.
Her bad' faith is cumulative. She has stayed in China by
breaking her word, and her stay has been used in aggres
sions which endanger the peace of the East and thereby, the
peace, of, the world.
It <Â¦ is . amusing that V the Â¦ Count complains . that Russian
diplomacy is accused of' belonging to the Machiavellian
school, and that he carefully lirnits. his interview to. Kishe
nev and Macedonia, omitting any reference"; to :Manchuria
and China. His diplomacy; belongs to an older school than
that of Machiavelli. Long before Â¦ him ; the Sultan ; Ab-der-
Rahman gave' to his, Minister these instructions: ; "Reply" to

Guarding Bljrnt Iiead fox Heart
When boxing hold the hands lightly
clenched. Do not clench ; them tightly,
except in the very moment of delivering
the blow. Never (as I have seen ama
teurs do. in a moment of nervousness)
clench" the fist with the thumb inside the
fingers. A broken thumb is the sure re
sult of that bit of awkwardness.
There is something else I would like
to impress on you to-day. As I have said,
never "slug" in a friendly bout, but if
your opponent should accidentally land
a heavier blow on you than he intended
do not lose your temper. The man who
cannot learn to keep his temper is, not
fit to box, and he can never excel in the
art. Perfect coolness and good nature are
absolutely necessary to the good boxer.
No boy . ought to take up boxing regu
larly until he is 14. If you find that your
first fatigue continues after half a dozen
lessons and that you do not recover easily
from it, " consult your family doctor
and let him determine whether' your
heart and other organs are in normal con.
dition. If they are not don't box at all.
.In "our next lesson:; I will teach- you
something about foot work.. It is perhaps
the most important Item of modern box
ing. 1
When your opponent leads a straight
right for your heart knock his arm out
ward with your left and bring your right
across in a straight lead for his face. A
similar rule applies when he leads for
your solar plexus with his left In the
latter case knock his arm outward with
your right and send in a left lead for his
face. In order to make these guards do
not, of course, raise your arm as in guard
ing a blow for the face, but lower which
ever arm you wish. to guard with, and
with an outward down-arm motion push
his blow aside. Take care not to push
his blow merely downward, as it will then
probably land on you below the belt.
Whatever blows parries or other move
you make at any stage of boxing alway;
remember to come back again at once t<
"on guard."
Wonderful Graphite.

(Author of "Shop Talk on the Wonders of the
Crafts. 1 ')
Carbon Is the industrial paradox. It Is
the hardest and one of the softest of the
known substances. It burns and doesn't
burn. It is colorless and transparent and
black and opaque. It scintillates and
sparkles, and is dull and lifeless. It is
heavy es rock in one place and in another
fifty pounds will fill a barrel to overflowing.
It is so rare that it Is called "precious"
and so common that it often Is a drug on
the market. It is a poor conductor of
electricity and one of the best It is bo
expensive that a bit not much larger than
a bean costs a small fortune and so cheap
that the ordinary citizen buys it by the
ton. It is a luxury and such a necessity
that without it the industries of the
country would be paralyzed.
Carbon is a paradox because as a dia
mond it is a precious stone, the hardest
of known substances, colorless and trans
parent As graphite it is black, soft,
opaque and so refractors* that it is made
into crucibles for melting things almost
to heat proof. As coal it burns and is the
chief source of industrial and domestic
beat. As carbon black it is so "fluffy"
that a boy can easily handle a barrel of
it The diamond, which is pure carbon,
is a poor conductor of electricity, and
graphite, which sometimes is &3 per cent
pure carbon, and gas retort carbon â
nearly pure â are such good conductors
that large quantities are used In the elec
trical section of the Industrial arts.
There are many substances which enter
bo intimately and unobtrusively into
everyday life that they are classed as
"common" and the average individual
pays no attention to them. Yet each of
them assumes such a great number of as
pects, plays eo many different parts and
exercises such varied Influences on so
many unlike things that the simple act
of following the path of any one of them
is a fascinating pursuit. Starch, clay,
water, sand, alcohol, sulphur, aluminum,
petroleum, iron, cellulose and a dozen
other solids and liquids offer themselves
as illustrations to prove there is a great
deal of the uncommon in common things.
And carbon ranks high in the list
Thus cf all the elements which affect
the character of iron, carbon exercises the
greatest Influence. The amount of it
present in the metal determines whether
the most useful of metals is cast iron,
Fteel or malleable iron. Cast iron con
tains more carbon than steel, and steel
has mere than bar or malleable iron. It
affects the hardness, strength, melting
degree and color of cast iron. Its "per
cent" in steel makes that alloy of iron
and carbon suitable for rails or razors,
boiler plate or girders, cold chisels or dies,
armor plate or nails.
Graphite, known also as plumbago and
b!ack lead, is one of the softest minerals,
and is found in the earth singularly free
from impurities. The graphite mines in
Ticonderoga, N. Y., produce graphite
which is S3.9 pure. A diamondâ pure car
bonâcan be placed on a block of graphite
âpractically pure carbonâ and in the pres
ence of intense heat can be reduced to
ashes, but the graphite will show no In
dication of having been heat affected. A
diamond is so hard it will cut glass, but
graphite is so oily soft that mixed with
pipe clay it is used almost exclusively for
lead pencils which will not scratch even
tissue paper.
Every rider of a bicycle and every au
tomobilist knows graphite as a lubricant.
It is difficult to believe that the greasy
feeling, smooth, unctuous black stuff
which minimizes the friction between the
eprocket wheel and chain of the bicycle
is the same etuff which is molded into
crucibles for melting gold and steel and
other refractcry substances. The lady of
the house might find It hard to see a
strong family resemblance between the
diamond on her finger and the stove pol
ish which her cook is using on the kitch
en range, but the stove polish is made of
graphite. Her husband would discredit
the etatement that the shine on his shoes
and the coal in his cellar are relatives;
nevertheless carbon black, the soot from
natural gas, which is the base of many
shoe blackings, and anthracite are half
brothers.
Carbon is not very particular as to lo
cality. As a diamond it is picked out of
gravel and sand and blasted from the
blue cement in the South African mines
in the form of crystals. Graphite is found
underground in "detached masses and
sheets in Ceylon, New York, -Wisconsin,
California, Vermont, Germany and other
places. Coal, hard and soft, is mined.
Petroleum (liquid carbon) and natural gas
(gaseous carbon) are brought from the
earth through pipes. Carbon grows in
trees, but must be subjected to heat to
become the charcoal of trade.
In preparing carbon for useful purposes
âand the diamond is not altogether mere
ly a thing of beauty, several trades use it
as a common toolâ the methods employed
are as wide apart as are the original
forms and varied characteristics of the
curious substance. The diamond is cut by
the continuous application of the hardest
of brasives and its own dust, but graphite
is mashed to a powder and floated on
water through a scries of tanks to re
move the impurities and "grade" it. Car
bon black, which is the base of the best
printing inks, and which enters Into the
make-up of paints, stove polishes, shoe
blacking, varnishes and lacquers. Is the
noot of natural gas, caught on the bot
tom of iron parts, suspended over long
rows of gas jets. Gas retort carbon,

poses and for the "carbons" of arc lights

illuminating and fuel gas. Anthracite
(hard coal) Is mined and broken into Its
merchantable sizes in the huge coal
breakers of Pennsylvania, while bitumin
ous (soft coal) is screened and sometimes
washed alter it is brought to the surface.
Coke and charcoal are made practically
by the same processâ slow combustionâ
the one from coal, the other from wood.
In the text books carbon Is called "one
of the most important of the chemical
element's," and also "a solid substance,

Jay Pollock McCoy of Shanghai. China,
who recently came to this country for
the first time, having been born and
reared In China, gave an interesting ap
preciation of Chinese character to the
New York Tribune. He said:
"I feel that I understand the Chinese
character. I had a Chinese nurse and
passed the whole of my boyhood with
Chinese of my age. Though I am thor
oughly American in my allegiance to the
land of my parents, I am in point of con
tact more Chinese than American.
Though the Chinese are little understood
by foreigners, who underestimate their
abilities, they are as capable of loyal at
tachments as the people of any other na
tionality. They may all appear much
alike to those who have only casual con
tact with them, but, speaking as one who
has grown a p among them, I know them
to be as different and as thoroughly dis
tinguishable as are any other people. Be
sides the Chinamen of recognized abili
ties there are a great many of them of
equal capacity who have simply been de
nied the opportunity of displaying their
abilities."
Chinese Character.
Now for another body counter. Let
your sparring partner lead again for your
face with his left. This time move your
head to the left to avoid his blow, bend
the left knee and lead for his heart with
your right. Raise your left arm to a po
sition where you can guard any possible
right-hander for your face.
Maintain your balance carefully (until
that balance becomes instinctive) in these
counters, for only perfect balance can
render the blows effective.
The very instant the blow lands come
back at once to the first position of guard.
tide) a little knowledge of anatomy will
stand you in good stead. Just where the
ribs diverge into a sort of inverted V
there is a spot, about the size of a silver
dollar, directly below the apex of the V.
This is known as the solar plexus. It is
an important nerve center. A heavy blow
there will temporarily paralyze the whole
body. Even a moderately stiff blow, sci
entifically planted there will make your
opponent groggy. But a few inches !
above or to either side he Is protected
by an armor of bones. So you see the
necessity of planting this left counter in
exactly the right place. If you err at all
you will give more effect to your blow

In friendly sparring or in practicing the
various points do not "slug" when deliv
ering a body blow. Strike lightly, but in
such a way that, if you so desire, you
could throw tremendous force into the
blow. In other words, bring the weight
and strength of the body into the blow,
but do not drive that weight and strength
home with full force. If you do you are
apt to have a knocked out sparring
partner or a free fight on your hands.
"When I reached home and had given

Carey was walking out Pine street after
the theater when the thug approached
him. The editor guessed the fellow's in
tention and cleared decks for action.
When the footpad bumped against him
and made a grab for his watch Carey
let go a right swing that caught the
stranger squarely upon the jaw and sent
him to the sidewalk.
"Carey, old man. you did that beauti

self. "Now Is your time to make a reputa

then arrest him." ,' .-ViV.)
The thug was In no hurry to arise, but
Carey, bubbling over with enthusiasm,*
helped him to his feet and steadied him
while he . started another swing toward
the place where it would do the- most
good.
Â¦ "About that time," said the editor in
telling the sfory, "I seemed to start upon
a trip that took * in every sub-station

before I landed anywhere the thought
flashed through my mind: 'By Jove! that

Nearly all the visitors who come to New
York in summer ask the hotel clerk or
somebody else where they can get the
"best view" of the city, according to tEe
New York Times. Few of them are ready
to accept the metropolis as they find It by
tramping through the streets or riding in
observation buses. It la disappointing to
most of them, not to find some place like
Bunker Hill Monument, in Boston, or
Wash'ngton Monument, in thd nation's
capital, where they can take in every
thing at a glance.
New Yorlc is too bigr for that, and tne
hotel men are often puzzled to direct the
visitors where to go. Generally they put
them off by telling them that It Is easy to
get to the too of one of the skyscraper
office buildings downtown â a statement
very far from the truth, as thousands
who have tried it will testify. For persons
with Influence enough to get passes
marked "special access" to the summits
of tall buildings it Is all right, but the
sightseeing multitude that goes up in ex
press elevators finds its view blocked
front, rear and sides by private offices,
which few of them have the temerity to
invade. Sometimes a limited view of one
street is open to them from a oorridor
window, but that is alL
No views of New York from above are
so popular . as lower Broadway and its
tributaries, where the tide of human life
runs strongest. It i3 a sight visitors from
the West cannot see in their largest cities,
cr indeed anywhere else In the world.
There is only one Broadway and one Wall
street. .^-
High Up in Nczu York.
The end aimed at is indicated clearly in orie paragraph
of the report of the committee: "In the area drained by.
this creek and its many tributaries and branches are lo
cated numerous and extensive deposits of auriferous gravel,
adapted to be worked by hydraulic mining, nearly all of
which are now neglected and idle by reason of the onerous
requirements of the laws with' regard to the restraint and
storage of the debris from such mines. * * * Hydraulic
mining would be extensively renewed within the area
drained by Weaver Creek and its branches if suitable pro
vision could be made for preventing the resulting debris
from reaching the navigable rivers of the Sacramento
Valley."
Tbe committee reports that with the view of determin
ing the feasibility of erecting the proposed barrier an exami
nation has been made of a site admirably adapted for the
dam. At the junction of Hangtown Creek with Weaver
Creek there is a flat or valley that extends down Weaver
Creek nearly one mile and is about half a mile wide, form
ing a basin of flat land but little above the level of high water
in the creek. At its lower end, so the committee reports,
"this basin is inclosed by abrupt .hills, through which the
creek makes its way in a steep canyon or gorge of hard,
metamorphic rock, supplying. an ideal site for the dam
across the stream, a considerable portion of which has al
ready been constructed by nature, which has also pro
vided an abundance of^ material, close at hand and of the best
quality, for its completion."
On the more important consideration as to whether the
dam would hold back the debris the committee reports in
substance that it 'would back the water up Weaver Creek
for about one mile, and that the stream, when backed,
would have an average width of about half a mile, thus
covering an area of at least 320 acres; that the basin would
have a capacity to hold 12,000,000 cubic yards of material;
that inasmuch as the dam would be several miles below
where the principal mining operations would be carried on,
the greater part of the coarser material dislodged would
never reach the dam; that the dam would^provide safely
for the lodgment of at least 50,000,000 cubic yards of mate
rial, as it now lies in the banks to be mined, and wpuld im
pound and restrain the same above the proposed barrier for
all time.
The estimated cost of the work is $25,000, as reported
by the committee, this including the title of all lands to be
inundated. Such prospective^ submerged areas are "mostly
mined-off bedrock, not fit for cultivation and of little value."
The committee, consisting of H. N. Picket, C. J. Green,
Thomas Alderson, Thomas Clark a"nd A. Baring-Gould, ex
press the opinion that the construction of the dam, "above
which all the. owners of mines could operate without fear of
loss or damage to their neighbors of the valleys below,
would result in a largely increased production of gold in
this district and be of material and lasting benefit to the
citizens of our county and State and the country at large."
SOME stir has, been occasioned in El Dorado County
by a proposition to urge the construction of a debris
dam on Webber Creek, sometimes known as Weaver
Creek, the expense to be borne jointly by the United States
and the State of California. A report has just been filed
concerning the matter by a committee of the El Dorado
County Miners' Association. The text of the findings of
the committee is published in the El Dorado Republican.
The place selected for the location of the dam is at the
narrows of Webber Creek, below its confluence with Hang
town Creek and Cold Springs Creek. The El Dorado
miners will strive to enlist public attention by bringing
their proposition before the annual convention of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, to be held in this city Novem
ber 16, 17 and 18. Therefore a full discussion is likely to
take place.

For another reason the law will be of the highest im
portance. All timber land will be withdrawn from entry.
The harvest of the forest will go on, under regulations that
permit the use of all ripe timber, but preserve for the future
all that is unripe and growing. This policy will extend to
the present forest reservations, and the country will nat
urally enter upon the preservation and perpetuation of its
forests without at all abridging the proper use of .timber for
the many purposes for which it has no substitute. The Gov
ernment by the sale of its ripe timber, at a proper stumpage,
will derive a large revenue, which may be used in the re
forestation of its timber lands,' and we will have bridged a
difficulty in administration which has been the despair of
the advocates of forest preservation.
â¢ This difficulty is made plain by study of the forest laws
of Continental Europe. There, by reason of the difference
of the political powers of government from ours, it is possible
to regulate the use of timber tracts in private ownership.
Here it is doubtful whether there is the power to do thisâ
indeed it may be said confidently that such power does not
inhere in our system. But our Government, as owner of
the forest lands, may lease or permit the harvest of timber
under such regulations as any owner may impose upon the
lessee. It may even require him to plant a crop of timber
where he has cut a harvest, though this will probably be
the legitimate work of the Forestry Bureau.
The same law proposes a reform of the lieu scrip system,
by requiring that when a private party within a forest res
ervation exchanges his holding for an equal acreage of
scrip it must be located on agricultural lands. This puts an
end t6 the present offensive practice of taking scrip on
private timber holdings, that have been stripped, and imme
diately relocating upon an equal holding of virgin timber.
The Dakota Senator has succeeded in drafting a conser
vative and highly important measure. The stock men will
see in it the advance guard of their proposition to lease the
grazing lands. Unless this is done we will soon expel our
live stock industry, and it will be relocated in Mexico and
Northwestern Canada, and we will lose our important com
mercial position in the meat trade of the world.
This is not saying that reclassification would not have
been a benefit. Experience had shown clearly that there
were about four hundred millions of acres of lands that
were not agricultural nor timber lands. They were grazing
lands only, with no other possible use in sight. They were
located in the arid and semi-arid regions, and nature had
furnished them with forage grasses and plants in sufficient
abundance, if cared for and not overstocked, to make them
permanently the largest and best stock-grazing area in the
world. They should have been classified as grazing lands,
and to protect the future settler in the event of a nobler use
appearing the title should have been left in the Government
and the forage should have been protected by leasing, in
sufficiently large tracts to make the payment of a proper
rental an object to the stock men. Instead of doing this,
however, we got the timber and stone acts, which have
been grossly misused to alienate the public title without
carrying at all the good intent of the laws, if they had any.
It is quite significant that when the stock men did ap
peal to Congress for a range lease instant objection was
made that the lease law would by implication and operation
repeal the stone entry law and perhaps the timber entry
also. To this the stock men rejoined that both ought to be
repealed, and they received the defeat of their leasing meas
ure as the reward of their frankness. But now, following
closely upon that defeat, come the General Land Office, the
Interior Department and the chairman of the Senate Land
Committee in entire agreement with the position of the
stock rangers in regard to those laws.
The law proposed by Senator Hansbrough is framed
precisely on the principle of the range lease law. By it
the title to stone and timber lands remains in the Govern
ment. It, in effect, leases the privilege to remove for eco
nomic purposes the timber and stone. The* holder of such
privilege may not alienate it to another, but it must be
used for his benefit and operated by him. This is a vast
improvement on the policy it will supplant. The proposed
permits will fix the conditions upon which they may be
used. The injury of the land for other purposes will be
prevented. The West will not have its progress checked
by lack of the use of timber or stone, but its future will
be safeguarded and its present welfare promoted at the
same time.
THE conservative action of the National Irrigation
Congress at Ogden is reflected in the bill introduced
by Mr. Hansbrough, chairman of the Land Com
mittee of the Senate- Everyone having knowledge of the
operation of the timber and stone entry laws knows that
in the beginning they were unnecessary to the administra
tion of our land system. The stone act added a surplus
classification to the public domain, which was unnecessary.

ing to do with the sale of the establish
ment, except as a representative of the
bank in dealing with Forst's note. Dis
cussing the matter last night, Bauer said:
"I never spoke to Forst about buying
the restaurant, and In fact did not know
that he was to buy an interest in the
place until he had completed negotiations.
He came to the bank with $3500 in cash
and a note for $1500, the balance of the
$5000 he had agreed to put Into the busi
ness. His note was secured to the bank
by his stock, but It was agreed that as
soon as he took possession of the restaurant
he should secure a reliable indorser for
his paper. When he failed to do this the
bank attached his stock and the court or
dered it sold. This was the only trans
action the bank and I had with Forst"
ALLEGES TRICKERY.
ing the stock with Bauer's bank and giv
ing his promissory note for that amount.
He charges that the least Important
statement made by Bauer and Ely was
the one to the effect that the Swiss-
American Bank was back of the restau
rant and would, in the light of its pros
perity, advance $15,000 if needed.
Now Forst claims that he is the victim
of a clever scheme to cheat him out of
' $5000. He says that after receiving the
stock he endeavored to participate in the
management of the restaurant. It was
then he learned, he says, that the state
ments of Elv and then bank cashier
were false and fraudulent and made for
the purpose of getting his money to re
duce the company's indebtedness. He
says that the only man in the concern
is Ely, and that the other two directors
and stockholders are merely dummies.
He says that it was never intended that
he should have any voice In the manage
ment, notwithstanding his holdings: that
all Ely wanted was his money. He says
that Ely has been cheating him ever since
he became a member of the firm and
claims that his employes have stood in
with him. Bills have been forged by Ely,
6ays Forst, marked O K by the cooks
and others, and the amounts they called
for pocketed by the manager. The cash
register, he says further, has also been
manipulated by Ely, with the result that
he has never been able to find out what
are the exact receipts of the concern or
to learn to what extent he had been swin
dled. Forst also charges that notwith
standing the lease required that no gam
bling games should be conducted on the
premises Ely has maintained a roulette
and faro outfit and has waxed wealthy
on the proceeds.
In his complaint Forst alleges that
Bauer and Ely approached him in the
early part of this year and excited his
cupidity by telling him what a mint the
restaurant was. They told him, he says,
that during the last year the restaurant
had made so much money that Ely had
been enabled to pay off an indebtedness
of $9000 in addition to providing himself
and i two other directors, his brother,
Frank Ely, and W. Richards5n, each with
a monthly income of $350. They told him.
he says, that they had a block of 2500
shares of stock that they would sell him
for $5000, thereby letting him in on the
ground floor of a prosperous business.
Forst believed the tale of the alleged con
spirators and mortgaged his home for
$3500 and raised another $1500 by pledg-
EXCITED HIS CUPIDITY.
Ernest H. ForEt, a stockholder in the
Malson Riche Catering Company, which
conducts a restaurant and hotel business
at the corner of Grant avenue and Geary
street, wants the affairs of the company
placed in the hands of a receiver pending
the trial of a eult for an accounting and
for an injunction preventing the sale of
his stock. The suit was filed by him
yesterday against Ralph A. Ely, manager
of the business of the company and owner
of the majority of the stock of the con
cern; the Swiss-American Bank, the in
stitution through which Forst acquired
his interest, and Sbainwald, Buckbeo &
Co., the real estate firm which has of
fered for rale Forst's stock. The com
plaint ia a long one and fairly reeks with
charges of conspiracy and fraud, in which
Ely and Arthur Bauer, cashier of the
bank, play prominent parts.
This suit is the direct result of the ac
tion of the Swiss-American Bank in at
tempting to dispose of some of the shares
of the capital stock of the Maison Riche
Company. The eharea were held by the
bank as security for a note for $1500 is-
Eued to them by Forst. The auction of
the stock was to have taken place yes
terday morning, but Shainwald, Buckbee
& Co., the auctioneers, were restrained by
an Injunction from Judge Murasky's
court.
Rusk was immediately taken into a pri
vate room and searched for the key with
which it was supposed he had twice
gained his liberty. The now sober man
laughed at the authoritles / as they were
searching him. When they had finished
he told them he would show them how he
eot out. He was taken back to the cell
and locked in as before. Rusk then took
a common lead pencil from his vest
pocket and shoved it into the keyhole.
After fumbling around with the lock a
moment, working the while with the bolt
in the socket he was able to throw it
back and open the door. .
Chief "Wlttman was at once informed of
the discovery and he immediately ordered
new locks placed on all of the cell doors.
ThÂ» discovery of the Rusk method of
opening the strong locks of the City
Prison accounts for the escape of Charles
Chester last May. Chester was jailed on
a charge of assault to commit murder
upon his wife. He was placed In the
same cell from which Rusk walked so
easily. At the time of his escape Station
keeper Horace White was up before the
Police Commissioners . on a charge of
neelecting to lock the door of the cell 1 In
which Chester was confined. He was ac
quitted and prisoners were placed in the
cell as before. None of them, however,
ever thought of attempting to open the
lock, which had always been regarded as
burglar-proof, until the ingeenlous Rusk
became occupant of the cell for a night.
It is reasonable to believe that the locks
on the other cell doors could have been
opened- as easily had an attempt been
made. \*
It remained, however, for a drunk to
find out the utter worthlessness of the
cell locks. Twice he freed himself and
was found strolling up and down the cor
ridors of the jail when discovered by ac
cident by one of the prison men.
On October 20 a drunken man named
Thomas Rusk was placed in a cell to re
cover from the effects of his debauch.
Prison-keeper Young locked the man In
his temporary domicile. Ten minutes
later he had occasion to enter the cor
ridor along which the cells are lined.
He was startled to find Rusk peacefully
strolling up and down tho hallway.
Thinking that he had been faulty in lock
ing up his charge Young again placed him
in the cell and said nothing of his dis
covery to the sergeant at the desk.
Thinking that he had made his prisoner
secure Young repaired to the office of the
prison.
It. was about an hour later when he
again stepped into the corridor to lock
up another drunk. The keeper could
hardly believe his eyes when he saw Rusk
again out of his cell enjoying a quiet
stroll.
It is somewhat startling- to think that
some of the most dangerous criminals of
years have been confined behind these
doors with defective locks. Just how long
these locks have been In that state la
not known, but it seems that they must
have been worthless for several years.
Murderers and felons of all classes, had
they not supposed that me department
had substantial locks on the cell doors,
might have made their escape with ease.
That tie locks of the cells of the City
Hall Prison could be opened with a lead
pencil in the hands of a drunken man
was the startling discovery made by
Prison-keeper Young several days ago.
The fact was kept a secret by the po
lice force and the truth did not leak out
until a locksmith was engaged to replace
the antiquated mechanism on the various
cell doors.
The bride was the youngf lady who cre
ated much gossip in Mill Valley by her in
fatuation for young Landgraff. She hov
ered round the stable owned by the elder
Landgraff and, despite the repeated re
quests of the latter, declined to leave the
place. It was thought the young lady was
suffering from aberration of mind, and
her father, A. J. Eaton, a well-known
business man of this city, waa notified
and he had her taken to the Receiving
Hospital for observation. It now develops
that Miss Eaton waa not weak-minded,
but simply madly infatuated with young
LandgraftV He also thought a great deal
of her and, despite the efforts of the
parents to keep the two apart, love held
sway and the devoted pair were married.
Mr. Eaton subsequently consented to his
daughter's marriage and the newly wed
ded couple spent the evening with the
bride's parents.
It was stated that Miss Eaton had made
her home in the stable, but this Is re
futed by the young woman, who under
oath testified she was employed by Land
graff as his bookkeeper.
On September 30 the father of the groom
had the bride arrested on a charge of
vagrancy and the young lady appeared
before Justice Pryor for examination. She
proved to the satisfaction of the court
that she was employed by the son, and
the Judge subpenaed him to appear before
him and corroborate or deny the testi
mony. Young Landgraff did not see fit to
testify against his future wife and The
proceedings were dropped.
The young man continued to pay suit to
Miss Eaton, and yesterday In company
with his bride he visited "Cupid" Dan
forth and secured a marriage license.
They then called upon Judge Van Nos
trand and were made . one. The young
couple will go to Mill Valley to-day and
receive the blessings of tee groom's par
ents.
A very pretty romance which will In
terest the residents of Marin County and
this city culminated yesterday, when Miss
Hattie M. Eaton of S33 Shrader street and
Joseph O. Lendgraff Jr. of Mill Valley
went before Justice of . the Peace Van
Nostrand and were, united In marriage.

"At the Opera" has a decidedly pleasing flavor in its
composition. It depicts a beautiful, buddin&r young
woman, rich in all the attractiveness of her young life.
and typically an American GirL
The ideal Grecian profile, the rich coloring of her au-
burn hair, the carelessly draped opera gown, exposing
her delicately chiseled neck and bust, all combine to give
the study a distinct character. The background could not
be more -aptly described than by the saying â it's Bry-
son's â as in his execution and handling of. colors he *
seems to impart to his creations a bit of life and dash
seldom attained by contemporary artists.
TtKIffKBrBER -The publisher has no possible way of
knowing just how many of this set to order: the best he
can do is to guess; and as it will take weeks for addi-
tional orders to be refilled, it seems proper to suggest
that every one wanting this beautiful "Series in Gold"

Boston's corn exports continue to fall
off, Montreal having become the principal"
shipping port on the Atlantic side for this
commodity. . The Boston shipments have
declined about 60 per cent and the New
York shipments 23 per cent since the Do
minion hag made the Canadian port free.
As matterh now stand, grain for export
can bÂ« shipped from Chicago to Liverpool
via Montreal 3 cent* a bushel cheaper
than through Boston, In spite of the fact
that thifc port has Buj>er!or facilities for
transhipment. A remedy for this condi
tion ot things lies in the lowering of. the
export freight rate by the American rail
roads, but although the export shippers
are trying to get the railroads to grant
them concessions on grain for export
by seaboard ports, the roads are doing
such a large domestic business that they
are not inuch inclined to cater to the
cheap ocean busings.â Boston Trantcrlrt.

Â¦ The team: work has improved greatly within
the laÂ«t two. weeks, and I think will compare
well with Stanford'*. We have been trying out
halves all along â¢ In > order, to get, the pick of
them. There has been a' good deal of talk about
our not having selected our backs and perfected
team work, but we * could not "do - It* '"Â¦ We
have had. a veteran. line all the time.' but not

The smashing game will be necessary on ac
count Â¦ of - the new â¢ rules; which â¢ force playing
t&gainst the line. The new rules were designed
to make the play, more open.: but they have had
the opircsite *ffect. . Heretofore there 'Â¦. was in
terference behind the line, but the rules forbid
that now In certain parts nf the field, so that
line-bucking is necessary. :^OJBMPw4ui
The backs will not do any end running be
cause of the superiority of the Stanford ends.
At present it seems our play is to break down
the opposing line.' , By. straight smashing
through . the line we hope ' to Â¦ wear : the other
men out. 'As the game Â¦ progresses,' if things
go as wÂ« wish. - their efficiency will grow less
and less. -/4MMWI - Â¦ . -. Â¦-
Of Sstroud as center and . Overall and Stow
as guards I think" there can be no question
as to their superiority to the opposing men on
the Stanford line. Ac to the - tackles, llelt
muller and Howard, they are not stars, but
they are good, consistent players. They are
good enouch . to handle . their opponents, . I
think. Both will have to play . hard, because
Stanford has < been massing its line bucks
against tackles. I noticed that Stanford hit
our tackles hard in the freshmen - game. â¢ ' Â»
As for the ends, I -don't think we are as
strong 'as Stanford, though I have 'not: noticed
any attempts of Stanford to smash down : end*.
Hudson will go in as. right end. If he is. able,
and Demeritt as left end. Hudson is not any
better than Oliver, who is his substitute, ex
cept that he has had- more experience. Â¦ The
trouble with both Demeritt and Oliver is that
they do not get In and . break up interference.
The biggest danger.. we. stand In.' however, ia
from the ends losing .'sight of the ball on some
trick play. The new rules give chances - for
lots of trick plays that may . turn .' out to be
costly for the team if the men do Â¦ not Ijok
sharp. $&*&&&&
The efficiency back of our line. If we have
any. lies in unity 'of action. The- men are
good on the offensive and much better on' the
defensive than Â¦ lasf year, ' though ithey -still
have a good deal to learn. Mini, the left half,
is the best of .the four. Stern at full is fair,
but he does not usÂ« his strength as he should."
Whlpplfc . is a little slow. More at quarter . Is

I think our line is stronger than Stanford's.
With the big veteran men we have there we
ought to be able to hold the Stanford backs.
On our line will fail the brunt of the battle,
as Stanford has backs that are better; than
ours. .
On a. dry field California's chances for win

thinks it doesn't pay to brag beforehand
because there's no telling what will turn
up In a football game. It Is easy to see
Whipple Is a little bit worried about the
outcome of the trial, though he is not
losing sleep over it. In estimating the
chances of California he carefully refrains
from saying he believes the team will win
"easy" or "hands-down," or in any other
equally expressive way, and he doesn't
indulge in any forecasts as to how the
score will read. The teams, he finds after
close figuring, are pretty evenly matched
âso evenly matched he won't hazard a
flatfooted avowal as-to.wnich will win.
Here is the way he sizes up the situation

of the assemblage, had It needed encour

President Jordan and Coach Lanagan
were outspoken in their praise of the
spirit shown by the football squad this
year and of the careful attention which
the men had paid to training rules. "The
way to win," j said President Jordan, "is
to deserve to win, and the team this
year deserves to win."
Coach Lanagan thanked the student
body for the support given the coaches
and the team and expressed his confi

do his best on Saturday to win a. victory.
Dr. Frank Angell of the I faculty ath

The new field will occupy the Hillegass
tract, facing on Bancroft way aDd border

the same Fpot that has been set aside for
It in the Ber.ard plans for the greater
university. It will be a little larger than
the regulation football field, which is
110x60 yards. The earth will be removed
from this area and piled up fifty feet
high, the earth forming the, wells. On
the slopes of this embankment will be
built the bleachers, enough to accommo
date 25.000 people. In four or five years,
when the earth wl!l have become compact,
the bleachers can be built on the em

possible accidents.
Ultimately it is proposed to build a con

be grown upon it to make it the more
sightly. The field itself will be sown with

â * â hihu at St. Louia.
There Is a little anticipation in this fes
tivity, for the application for the certifi
cate has yet to be made in regular form,
and It may quite possibly be discovered
that there is some flavin the qualifica
tions of the would-bo Briton. - A - form of
petition, which has to be sent to the
Home Secretary when filled up, is laid be
fore the alien, and upon it he has to give
full details of his claim. As mentioned
already, the applicant must show that he
has lived here five years and is going to
keep on doing so. He must also state the
number and age of his children, if any,
for all under are are naturalized themurb
The whole of the members of such a so
ciety pay their shillings every seven days
and agree to do so till the necessary
amount is paid, but they need not neces
sarily wait until then before they can call
the Union Jack their own. The business
is arranged on the building society prin
ciple, and once a week, or of tener, at a
busy time, there Is a drawing at head
quarters, as the result of which Mosea
Rosenstein, who once lived in Germany,
and who has only paid five shillings of his
naturalization money, is able to take his
friends round" to the "Green Cow" and
celebrate his advent into British nation
ality,, upon the advantages of which he is
expected to make a speech. '. . '
When the trials and troubles which a
foreigner must endure to become a citi
zen of the United States are considered
the rapidity with which an alien can gain
such rights in Great Britain, be he so
minded, seems remarkable. Any man
possessed of a fair amount of shrewdness
may become a naturalized British citizen
for $25. This amount is the fee which the
Government exacts for grainting the nat
uralization certificate, and there is a mat
ter of about twenty shillings to be settled
before the alien can be declared fit and
can receive a certified copy of the certifi
cate. That represents the total outlay in
money. Of course^ there are certain con
ditions laid down in the laws which he
must fulfill, but these are little under
stood, and the would-be Britisher may
slip through without fulfilling all of them,
if he knows how. The laws say that ono
must have enjoyed a five-year residence
in the country or served the Government
for that length of time outside, and that
an applicant must enow that he does not
intend to decamp as soon as the certifi
cate is given him. These rules are en
forced as rigorously as possible, and of
late years the number of aliens who have
slipped through has not approached that
recorded some years ago.
If the alien is poor, and especially if he
lives in the East End of London, where
so large a proportion do. he usually elects
to solve the pecuniary and all other ques
tions connected with the process of turn-
Ing himself into a Briton by subscribing
to a naturalization society, of which in
that part of the metropolis there are sev
eral. In some cases, and particularly in
the Jewish colonies, there are naturaliza
tion societies who arrange the whole busi
ness on the applicant paying a shilling: a
week and making his residential qualifi
cation good.

TBAFFIC IN CERTIFICATES.
A poor alien who is legitimately entitled
to naturalization saves up his shillings
till he has the number required, gets his
certificate in the ordinary course, and
then waits for his investment to ripen.
He has only got the certificate to sell
again, and he passes the word along in
the most useful quarters that when one
i3 wanted by a fresh Incomer from abroad
he has one to dispose of at a price.
It does not. matter what name the new
foreigner goes by In this country, and so
It Is a simple thing for him to adopt that
given on the certificate, whilst other de
tails are easily capable ; of arrangement.
The holder demands a price according to
the means and the necessity of the buyer.
On an; average he ; la yielded . a profit , o j
two or three pounds, but sometimes it
may be worth twenty to him.â Baltimore
American. , -.,-; ,Â¦Â¦Â¦ .
Some care has also to be taken to make
sure that the applicant really wants the
naturalization certificate for his own per
sonal gratification or use, for, strange
as it may appear, there Is some traffic
done in these British trademarks, and
there Is no doubt that there are many of
the worst characters I from foreign coun
tries who have been here but five min
utes, so to speak, who are able to flout
the certificate before the eyes of anybody.
The method .of working in this case- is
simple but effective. .
Thus, on one occasion a rough-looking
Pole, who could speak but a dozen words
of English, was the applicant, and even to
the oiflcials of the society, who In such
matters are not at all thin-skinned, it ap
peared eminently undesirable that for the
future this person should be allowed to
class himself as a British subject. Yet he
produced his four references arid it
seemed as if his case would have to go
through, until some one began to conceive
suspicions as to the references. Then,
after the closest Inquiry, It was discov
eerd that each of the four persons re
ferred to had received Inducements to
act in the capacity, and, when challenged,
they declared that they had given "their
names under a misapprehension. Â¦ Â¦
Moreover, the Pole was found to have
been a resident in this country for but
three months, and to be engaged in an
occupation of the most questionable de
scription. "Better try Russia," was the
brief and sarcastic advice which was
given to the gentleman when-all this was
known, j: .^"v
their father, and he must give the names
and addresses of four householders to
whom reference may be made, three as to
personal character and one as to resi
dence.
Efforts are usually made to see that the
application is made in good faith and that
the facts of the claim are as stated; but
on many occasions it becomes painfully
evident that the alien is seekiug British
rights when he has no moral or any other
claim to them. Under such circumstances
he is plainly told that he had better wait
a little while until his qualifications ma
ture somewhat.
The victim of the robbery informed the
officers that the men watched him in a
restaurant and when he departed they
followed him. He was able to give a good
description of the men and the police hope
to capture them.

The extraordinary episode of Joseph
Leiter's corner, during 1S38. is recent his
tory. Epitomized, the story fs that ha
started buying wheat at 73ti cents per
bushel; bought as low as 63; kept on buy
ing and selling for a year; put up tha
price to $1 83 on May 10. 1538; actually
controlled 35.000.000 bushels and sold or ex
ported on the advance 25.000,000; was be
lieved to have secured a paper profit of
at least $5,000,000; then, all at once, con
fessed insolvency, leaving a member of
hi9 family to raise at least the sum named
above to pay his debts.
This memorable case contained such of
the moral as there is in this corner epi
sode. It has been fleurfed out that be
tween May 10 and June 13 the paper valuq
of Leiter's holdings shrunk $3,5O-').000. This
Is the inevitable peril of a corner. Actual
control of the market enables any specu
lator to name the price, t>ut he cannot
force the real consumer to buy. This ex
perience called forth the well-known re
mark of the late P. D. Armour, himself a
dabbler in venture* of this sort: "You
can make your corner; you will kill your
market: what will you do â¢with tho
corpse?"â New York Evening Post.
A>, hurry-up telephone mesage was re
ceived at the Park police station last
night from Mrs. Thomas Mitchell, Nine
teenth avenue and M street. The woman
In frenzied tones told the officer that an
swered the phone that her husband was
trying to kill her. Patrolman Clener was
at once dispatched to the place and found
the husband lying on the floor in the
kitchen, drunk, his right hand tightly
clutching a 38 caliber revolver, all five
chambers of which were empty.
The woman was standing outside the
house, fearful lest her husband might
awaken from his drunken slumber and
again attack her. In hysterical tones the
woman told the officer the story of how
her husband, frenzied from drink, had
chased her around the house, firing at her
as she fled for her life.
"My husband came home shortly before
midnight," said Mrs. Mitchell, "and when
I saw that he was under the influence of
liquor I began to remonstrate with him.
Suddenly he pulled a revolver out of his
pocket and fired a shot at me.
"He was so drunk that his aim was bad
and I started to run. He followed me up,
firing two more shots as he ran. I finally
managed to escape from the house and
took refuge with a neighbor. As soon as
I made my escape he must have fallen
asleep, for I watched the house closely,
but could see no more of him."" : V. â¢

consumption at a maximum. The early
*SO*s reversed both elements in the situa
tion. Prosperity caused increased con
sumption, and in 18S7 the harvest failed.
A successful corner was manipulated In
that year, wheat at Chicago going from
96 cents early in 1SS1 to $1 43 in October,
and the corner was really continued into
the spring months of the ensuing year.
It was in 1SS7 that the famous "Cincin
nati deal" occurred. Involving misuse of
the funds of a powerful bank and the for
tunes of a dozen firms. The market was
thought to be really cornered, yet the
price was only raised from &)*Â» cents to
94*4 cents per bushel, and that moderate
rise was enough to turn the wheat from
seaboard storehouses back Into Cincinnati
and Chicago and break the corner abso
lutely. The corner manipulators went
down In a general collapse of insolvency;
wheat fell at once to 6S cents per bushel.
By way of contrast 1RS8 supplied, per
haps, the most successful wheat corner
In our history. B. P. Hutchinson, purely
by getting his "bear" antagonists to sell
him vastly more contracts for delivery*
than the somewhat deficient crop would
warrant, started with the price around 83
cents in the later summer and at the
very clcse of September drew the lines.
He announced on September 28 that 12
per bushel was his price for settlement
with the "shorts," and on the last day
of the month they had to pay It.
"On the Board of Trade," one newspa
per report narrated, "a crowd followed
him all over the floor, cheering lustily
whenever his head could be seen." Like
all successful adventurers, he was the
hero of the. hour.
Yet Hutchinson himself very soon gave
impressive Illustration of one moral o*
the "corner." Convinced to the point of
mad infatuation of his ability to handla
such operations, he started to corner the
Chicago corn market In March, 1S91.
He had the "statistical position" on his
side, the previous season's crop having
run 623,000,000 bushels short of 1SS3, and
Europe's crops promising failure. The
corn crop was, in fact, smaller than the
recent yield of 1901. From 65 cents in
March, he put the price to 82 on April IS.
Then the price wavered. On April 29. ISM.
"Old Hutch." as the Board of Trade al
ways called him, simply disappeared. He

The peculiarity of the wheat corners of
1S71 and 1872 was that they -were made on
reasonably abundant crops, but with home
There was an exactly similar corner in
August, 1S72, in which, however, the cor
ner manipulators did not "come out
whole." Spring wheat for August deliv
ery was thought to be absolutely cor
nered: it was advanced above even the
New York price and touched $1 61. The
corner was brought to a head too early
in the month. In the third -week of Au
gust a mass of new supplies suddenly
came upon the market and within twenty
four hours the price collapsed from $1 â¬1
to U 19 per bushel. It went to Jl 01 a few
weeks later.
The certainty that the American cotton
corner of 1903 will go down in commercial
history as one of the most remarkable of
such episodes on record calls "attention
again to the noteworthy points of contrast
or resemblance between this corner and
those of other years. As to cotton corners
in recent times, the market's story was
told on this page March 7. The notable
episodes there noticed, the Labouisse cor
ner at New Orleans in 1895 and the Steen
strand corner at Liverpool in 1S99, broke
down through failure of the corner ma
nipulators to secure sufficient bank funds
to take the cotton forced on them at toy
-prices. â¢ ,.
On the other hand, the extraordinary
cotton corner of 1864, when the maximum
prices in the trade's history were touched,
turned out satisfactory to the manipula
tors. From 76 cents a pound In April of
that yearâ a price due, of course, to the
Southern blockade â cotton advanced to
$1 54 in July and to $1 90 shortly afterward.
As late as January, 1S65, the price held at
$1 20. In that extraordinary year our ex
port of cotton was 2G.765 bales and our
import of the same raw material 76.0S5.
By the time of Lee's surrender cotton
was down again to 40 cents a pound.
It is in the grain market rather than in
the market for cotton that the spectacu
lar corners of this country have been run.
The Chicago corner in wheat during 1S71
was one of the most striking 6f these. The
crop of the previous season had been
somewhat reduced from the year before,
but was w;e}l f vp to.rthe average. The
Franco-Prussian 'war, 'with Its partial
suspension of wheat production in the
two belligerent states, came to an end in
March and the price of wheat declined.
The speculative sellers went too far and
were confronted with a i sudden foreign
demand, as a result of which, in the
words of a contemporary grain review,
"almost the whole of our new crop of
winter wheat has been going forward to
the continent." Spring wheat, which a
"bear raid" drove down to 96 cents at
Chicago for August delivery, was put up
to $1 30 before the month was over. This
was a successful corner; it ended, after
two "bear failures," in a highly profitable
settlement.

STANDIXQ OF THB CLCBS.
The landlady of the house where Upson
and his wife roomed stated last night
that the man was very devoted to the
woman and always treated her kindly.
She stated that she did not know Upson's
business or where he spent his time.
Captain of Detectives Martin stated last
night that no report of the case had been
made to him by Coroner Leland and that
no detectives had been put to work to ln
lnvestigate the circumstances surrounding
Mrs. Upson's death.
At Bayjey's drug store at 251 Grant ave
nue it was denied that Upson had secured
eny medicines on a prescription of Dr. R.
Lowry Jr.
Upson was not questioned by the Coro
ner's deputies yesterday and he could not
be found last night at his lodgings. Ac
cording to statements made by Upson to
Dr. Preston, the man is addicted to
gambling. A search was made for him
last night in the tenderloin, but he could
not be found.
At Olson's drug store at Mason and
Geary streets the proprietor denied that
Upson had been sold any morphine or
that the man had called and exhibited a
box of the deadly pellets, flatly contra
dicting the statement made by Dr. Pres
ton.
DRUGGIST OLSON'S DENIAL.
Mrs. Upson was dead, presumably from mcÂ»
phlne poisoning.
I declared positively that nothing would be
considered by me unless we began with a
dt-flnite agreement that any negotiations for or
dismissal of this appeal by the city should
alfo carry with it an absolute agreement by
the Contra Costa "Water Company that* the
Hart judgment and valuation would never be
ykaded by the company against the city In
any future Htipation. That would leave the
litigation In the condition that the Hart
valuation could not be urired or pleaded against
the city, while a compiMJon of thiÂ» appeaJ.
if It wont against the city, would bo binding.
That was as far as the proposition got. I
declared that nothing would be considered un
less we began with this agreement and noth
ing more has been said. The dismissal of
thiÂ« appeal is In the hands of the Council and
not the Mayor and It is In such a shape that
I da not think that I shall even submit It to
the Council.
The discussion that took plac* was a pirely
private, informal and accidental cne. It oc
curred st a luncheon table in San Francisco,
and it is very remarkable that it should find 1U
way to the world when it had no official c!g
n::icar.oe. The matter TraÂ» talked over from a
Jcital point ot view. It vu urged that the
completion of the appeal would ailect only the
ratcu of the year for which the *uit was
brought and that the rates for that year bad
already h&ea raid and the consumers would
hardly make any fight over them. The fact
that tbe valuation ct the Contra Costa Water
Cr>mrany was changing every year and that
the Hart valuation could not be made to hold
from year to year was also submitted. The
c.'st cf the appeal was discussed. Printing
and attorneys' fÂ»vs will be considerable, and
at thÂ« conclusion it was claimed that only the
matter cf the v.ater rates for the one year in
question would be settled.
Mayer Olney to-night explained how the
meeting came about, and announced that
it was without his province to take any
action in the matter, that such action
was in the hands of the City Council, and
he did not think that he would submit the
matter to that body. He said:
The story of an Informal discussion of
the Etatus of the water rate case that
look place at a luncheon table in San
Francisco leaked out in Oakland to-day.
The case is now In process of appeal from
the decision of Judge Hart, and the attor
neys for the city and the attorneys for
the water company are at work settling
the bill of exceptions upon which the case
will be taken to the Supreme Court
Not long since Mayor Olney and some
of the attorneys for the Contra Costa
Water Company met during the noon
hour and fell to discussing the case th*t
has been so long drawn out. "The discus
sion was informal and turned \ipon the
case in which each was interested. No
agreement was reached and neither side
offered any, though possibilities were dis
cussed.

THE MASTER OF APPLEBY
( Â£ *7\ T this sharp crisis when a look or a word would cost me more
f j than death and mv dear lady her honor, it was the colonel
\Â» j who. all unwittingly, stood my friend. A breath of doubt
â¢*Â¦ upon my lie and we were lost, and once I thoueht he would
have breathed it. But he did not. Instead he broke out in a laugh,
with a gibe flunz first at Gilbert Stair and then at Falconnet.
" 'God save us. I jrive you ioy, Mr. Stair, and you. Sir Francis.
These two have duped vou bravely. By heavens, Sir Frank, 'twas you
who should have had the sword thrust in the duel. In that event vou
might have stood in Captain Ireton's shoes, and so had the priest
fetched for your benefit.' Then he turned to Margery with a bow that
had a touch of mockerv in it. "I crave your pardon, madam; I knew not
â¢j'ou were pleadinc for vour husband's life an hour ago. It grieves me
that I may not spare him longer to you than the night, but war is cruel
at the best.'
"She stood like anv statue done in cold Carrara while he spoke; and
when she made no sieh he arave the word to recommit me."
If you were writinc a novel do you think you could crowd more of
the anguish, the doubts and fears, the cruelty of war, the hope and cross
purpose of a misplaced love into two hundred words than are woven into
those three paragraphs? They are the very essence of the art of writing.
It matters not what went before. It matters much what comes after.
In that brief outline vou eet one of the most thrillinc: situations iii
Francis Lynne's "Master of Appleby." and in those few words vou are
given a wonderful insight in all that has gone before; but better than all
else there is such a promise of exciting things to come that, clever as
jron may be at weaving a solution for yourself, your curiosity is piqued.
and. true to the ruling passion in human nature. j*ou simply must know
how some one else could untangle such a strange love affair.
That is the reason that the first installment of the "Master of Ap-
pleby" will have such a big sale when published in the next Sunday Call.
And perhaps another equally eood reason may be found in the fact that
you cannot buy this masterpiece of American fiction anywhere else in
"any form for less than $i 50. That is one of the big advantages of the
Sunday Call's literary policy; you not only get the best books of the
hour, but you get them for one-tenth of what they would cost vou else-
where. That is one of the truisms that has made the Sunday Call so
immensely popular. There are no interminable "Continued in Our
Next"' series, no lone waits between installments. You not onlv eet
the whole novel complete, but you get it quick. And best of all 'The
Master of Appleby" is worth having in any shape.
But. however, that isn't all that there is to the next Sunday Call.
Oh. dear. no. There is much more besides of the best literature ever
written. For instance, there is "The Roadmaster's Story," the last and
the best of Frank H. Spearman's thrilling railroad stories: "On Sentence
Day." by Josian Flynt: "Private Hogan, Coward," and a whole page of
"Half-hour Storiettes" of the sort you want to stay awake at night to
read; "The Man Who Ended the Land Wars in Ireland" and some-
thing amazingly new about "Crime and Criminals" in the West": "The
Smiling Girl," which is a full-page picture that you siraplr can't miss;
"New Boots for the Athletic Woman," which is another page of pictures
that will keep you on the aui vive: "The Girl Who Served Time." bv
BilJy Burgundy: "Me-ows of a Kitty" (you'll. laugh at those cats), and
ever so many more thines besides. Indeed, the next Sunday Call will
show you how new the Sunday Call always is.

So holds Judge Sanborn in the United
States court in the case of Thomas H.
Phillips against the Iola Portland Cement
Company.
The cement company contracted with
William Parr & Co., of which firm Phil
lips was a member, to sell cement, and
In the contract was an agreement on the
part of Parr & Co. not to sell any of the
cement outside of the State of Texas.
Parr & Co. accepted and paid for 24,580
barrels and refused to accept 25,420 bar
rels. The cement company sued. The de
fense answered that the contract not to
sell outside the State of Texas constituted
a contract in restraint of trade among the
States. The court holds that such restric
tion did not affect interstate commerce.

Plans Are Now Under Consideration
for the Contemplated Ttto Ten-
Etory Buildings.
XF^V YORK. Nov. 12.-Andrfw Carne-
Cie's plan to make New York one of the
great engineering centers of the world
and to give to all branches it the pro
fession a large building for general c!ub
purposes is reported to be fast approach
ing realization. The proposed buildings
Will cost fl.000.000. :
The plans now under consideration con- '
template two ten-story buildings, one for
the Engineers' Club in West Fortieth
street, near Fifth avenue, and tne othtr
as the home of the four national societies
of the engineering profession in West
Thirty-ninth street. Here will be housed
the mapnifieent technical libraries of
these organizations and here their mem
bers will meet for the business and pro
fessional detail* that pertain to each.

CAEin-GIE'S PBOPOSITION
The transport brought 416 Â¦ passengers.
As has been the case on' nearly every
transport that has crossed the Pacific," the
Thomas bad on board a" number of pro
fessional gamblers who had shipped In
various ! capacities to { be 'I on hand Â» when
the returning sobers received their pay.
Owing to the foresight i of Quartermaster
Captain ;V. K.' Hart,' however, there were
few military , pigeons plucked on the
Thomas. , He ?. learned of the ; presence on
board of ' this : undesirable element - and
Two steam launches were smashed and
Jmn la J at Â° ry on tne a Â«er end of the
upper deck was completely gutted by one
big sea that went through^ the structure
lU e a steel jacketed shell. Several mem
bers of the crew were slightly injured
and a number of passengers received
bruises more or less severe.
To Chief Steward Herbert the passen
gers paid a warm tribute for his conduct
during the gale. Throughout the night
he devoted himself to the women and
children, securing for. them all the com
fort possible under the trying circum
stances. Before leaving the ship the pas
sengers signed a testimonial in which
they expressed their appreciation of Her
oert's efforts.
To the passengers the most terrifying
feature of the storm was the violent roll-
Ing of the shin. She heeled until her
decks were almost perpendicular. When
she reached the end of a -roll she stop
ped, aa if undecided whether to remain
on her beam ends, turn turtle or swing
over on her other" side. During one of
these side dives the coal. in her bunkers
shifted and added a few. degrees, to the
steepness of .the decks when she rolled to
etarboard. As she heeled over passengers
furniture, crockery and other . movables
slid across the saloon floor to slam in an
indiscriminate heap against the first ob
struction firm enough to ! withstand the
impact. At one stage of the proceedings
the saloon sideboard got loose and but
for the prompt action taken by Steward
Herbert and his men would have played
a disastrous game of nine pins" with the
frightened passengers.
Fine weather followed the storm, and
by the time Honolulu was reached the
passengers were able to laugh over their
wild experiences.
Captain Buford, the commander of the
Thomas, was on the bridge, too fully oc
cupied with the handling of the ship to
devote any attention to his passengers.
The coolest man on the vessel was Chief
Engineer Handle y.
"Another boat smashed!" yelled a mem
ber of the crew to Handley in hearing
or a group of awe-stricken passengers
"Ju m . n 2 l , deaf> " replled the chief.
-mÂ»hH t/ lcre are a dozen boats
smashed. If you go around shouting like
that the passengers will think this is
Eomething unusual."
army transport Thomas, Cap
1 tain.Buford, which arrived from
I Manila on Wednesday night, passed
quarantine early yesterday morn
ing and at noon was docked
at the transport wharf. As she
neared the dock . there loomed up the
scars received in as fierce a gale as ever
swept the Pacific, through which the
i Thomas fought her way during the night
1 of October 25 on the trip from Nagasaki
to Honolulu. Twisted stanchions, stove
in boats and a canvas-patched house on
the trooper's after end bore eloquent wit
ness to the truth of the tales told by pas
sengers and crew. :>- Â¦
By the land folk on board the storm is
described variously as a hurricane, a
typhoon and a cyclone, or a combination
of all three.
Captain Buford says It was "A gale,
sir; a full gale and a stiff one."
The storm struck the ship about 5 p. m.
and by 6 o'clock the battle was on In
earnest. The troops were ordered below
and hatches were battened down. Pas
sengers forsook their staterooms and
gathered, for mutual comfort, in the din
ing saloon, where crashing crockery
mingled with prayers and hysterical
laughs and screams and where such of
the ship's officers as could be spared from
the navigation of the trooper did their
best to calm their fear-stricken charges.
One brave, little woman, however, Mrs.
D. E. Holley, wife of a captain of the
Fourth Infantry, refused to leave her
stateroom. She had confidence In the
ship's officers, she said, and faith in the
stanchness of the Thomas. If the ship
was going to founder she preferred to
meet death quietly and alone. Mean
while she thought she could be of more
service by keeping out of the way than
by adding her presence to the confusion
in the saloon.
The Thomas brought Troops C and H
of the Fifteenth Cavalry, 83 casuals, 33
sick and 33 general prisoners, as well as
a number of civilian employes. Her cabin

William Borgwardt and William Fugit
testified to conversations with Hulse the
evening before the shooting, in which he
said that McKinney was In town and that
he had brought him. Sheriff Kelly testi
fied to having had a conversation with
Hulse In the jail, in which the latter said
that he had brought McKinney Into the
city and had sheltered him at the Joss
house, describing how he had driven out
with him by night to where the outlaw
had cached his guns and ammunition and
brought them into town. When asked if
he was present at the time of the shoot
ing Hulse replied: "No; if I had been

TELL OF STATEMENTS
OF McKINNEY'S COMRADE
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday granted a new trial in the case
of the United States against James M.
Engle, William S. Lewis. Richard H.
Lewis and Arthur W. Keddie. The de
fendants were convicted last Tuesday of
having Buborned nine persons to swear
falsely to applications for Government
timber lands In Sierra and Plumas coun
ties. S. C. Denson. Frank R. Wehe and
Bert Schlesinger, counsel for the defense,
made the motion for a new trial on the
grounds that the evidence was wholly in
sufficient to Justify the verdict of con
viction; that the court erred in refusing
to instruct the jury to render a verdict
In favor of the defendants; that the court
erred In refusing the instruction asked
for by defendants' counsel that prior
agreement betwen the entryman and the
defendants must be proved before a con
viction could be had; that there was no
evidence whatever in ten of the eighteen
counts of the indictment charging that
the defendants had puborned the five
missing witnesses to commit perjury, and
that the court erred in denying the de
fense an opportunity of cross-examining
United States Marshal Shine.
Judge de Haven sustained the conten
tion of the defense with regard to the
absence of testimony as to the suborna
tion of the five missing witnesses and
granted the motion for a new trial on
the ground that the court had erred when
it neglected to charge the Jury that it
must be proved that prior to the entry
man making application for the land an
understanding or agreement had been
made by him and some one else for the
transfer of the land.
The case will be set for the retrial
shortly after December 1.
By order of the chairman a meeting of the
advisory committee has been called for Tues
day, November 1". The topic of this meet
ins will be "Co-operation." and as represent
atives from all parts of the State will be
present, a very Interesting programme is
promised.
For California, the monthly magazine of
the committee, will make Its first appearance
in December. It will contain articles by
Governor Pardee, "William H. Savior and oth
ers. Illustrations by Dixon. The committee
is receiving liberal contributions from prom
inent Californiana for this publication, and It
Is anticipated that In each number there w:ll
be much of interest to the prospective set
tler and to our own people aa well.
Records from one transcontinental line only
show that since September 15 10,290 person*
have taken advantage of the low colonist rates
to come to California.
The convention of the American Bankers*
Association, Just held, proved of more than or
dinary interest and of great benefit to Cali
fornia. Much enthusiasm was manifested
by these representative men, many of whom
traveled extensively throughout the State,
gaining a knowledge of tha resources and op
portunities here for Investment. Material re
sults of this convention will be shown later on.
Within a few months the cruiser California
will be launched in San Francisco Bay. Tha
Native Sons of the Golden West have taken
an active Interest in this launching and will
endeavor to make It an event of mora than
ordinary significance. This committee has
been in consultation with the officers of the
Native Sons of the Golden West and will co
operate by lending any possible assistance to
make the affair a success.
WILL ISSUE MAGAZINE.
The committee is anxious to have San
Francisco boast of a magnificent convention
hall in the near future. Such a hall is abso
lutely required here for conventions and other
gatherings so much desired by the city. Tba
matter is being actively agitated.
The committee, ! with the aid of tha press
In different localities of the State, is carry
ing on an active campaign for better hotels.
The tourist should be able to find proper ac
commodations in all parts of the State. Tha
beauty spots of California may be made still
more attractive by adding material comforts
to visitors.
Talks have been made by representatives of
the committee before the Sacramento Valley
Development Association at its last meeting
in Sacramento and before the Women's Col
legiate Alumnae in San Francisco.
The committee is making special efforts, to
gether with the California Creamery Opera
tors' Association, to provide a representative
exhibit of California dairy Droducts at tha
St. Louis fair, and la endeavoring to secure a
strong delegation of dairymen during tha con
vention of the National Buttermakers' Asso
ciation, to be held in St. Louis In 1904, so that
this important association may meet in Cali
fornia in 19C5. This convention will be ef
peculiar Importance to California: it draws
from 6000 to 80C0 dairymen from all parts
of the United States.
The following articles from the publication
bureau of tba committee were published dur
ing the month of October: "The Eleven Coun
ties of the Sacramento Valley," "Small Farms
as Means of Profit, " "The Great Valley of,
the San Joaquln."' "New Era for Tulare."'
"Possibilities of Limited Farming," "Califor
nia Mountain Counties." "The Central Coast

"Wine" and "Potato Raising on Large Scale."
Clippings received show that publications
outside of California having a circulation of
838,000 published articles from tha committee*
In October. The committee has furnished tha
American Press Association, tha Associated
Press and all of the papers in the State with
articles and news Items that have, been exten
sively used.
A representative of the committee attended
the ceremonies at Tulare on the occasion of
tha burning of the irrigation bonds, and ad
dressed the people of that community.
DAIRYMEN ARE INTERESTED.
The different books published by tha com
mittee continue to be in demand and a larga
distribution of the literature is looked for
during the approaching holiday time as sou
venirs to Eastern friends.
During the month of October about 1100
letters were received and about 1S0O letters
eent out. and about 13.COO pieces of literature
distributed. The committee has on file taa
names of about 60, CW people who are interested
in California.
LITEBATTTRE DISTRIBUTED.
It is a matter of gratification to notion thÂ»
results of the work of the committee become
more pronounced each month. It is interesting
to note the Increase in the number of peopla
from other States who have been attracte-i to
California by information sent them. Many
are now coming here who have been in cor
respondence with the committee for & year
or more, and those newcomers. If well, placed,
will influence many of their friends outside of
California to settle here. It must be consid
ered that while the committee is interesting
many in California, that only a certain per
centage can make it convenient to coma im
mediately and cut loose from their present
surroundings. From advices received, how
ever, as soon aa this can be accomplished, an
enormous tide of Immigration to California
may be looked for. It has been found that
the "follow up" system of the committee la
most effective; a party who has expressed him
self aa interested in California is written to,
but for some reason does not respond; tha
method is to write him again, and sometime*
more than once; these second, third or fourth
letters from the committee almost Invariably
brlnsr replies, and in many cases it has been
found that the parties so persistently sought
are influenced into coming to our State.
Tha membership of the committee has
Increased rapidly within tha last two
months and much Interest has been
stirred up In the East concerning Califor
nia. The executive board is anxious to
secure more members and a personal ap
peal will be made to representative citi
zens all over the State to co-cperate with
the organization In advertising the pro
ducts and advantages of the State
throughout the East.
The following report for the month of
October was submitted by Rufus P. Jen

business was transacted and work for
the future planned. The meeting was at

ing of A. Sbarboro, Rufus P. Jennings.

yesterday afternoon and much Important
The regular monthly meeting of tha
California Promotion Committee was held
It was alleged fa the Aubury report that
many rJacer mines had been taken in by
timber speculators on overlapping timber
claims and that some of these placer
rropcriics had h>-en worked extensively.
The names of miners who claimed to be
achieved &"d the substance of their
complaints were forwarded by Aubury to
Washington. ProbabJy this matter con
cerning the placer miners and other min
ers has been investigated by the agents
now in the field.
Sinea the last annual convention of the
California Miners* Association in this
city, when complaints were frequent con
cerning the manner in which public lands
covered by timber and also placer loca
tions were being gobbled up by specula
tors on cne pretext or another, a com
plete chang* in conditions has taken
place. No report has yet been submitted
as to the result of recent investigations
by trusted agents of the Government rel
ative to the timber frauds, nor may such
report be made for some time. When it
is in the hands of the proper authori
ties In Washington additional startling
developments may come to light.
The action of the Secrc<ary of the In
terior in accepting the resignation of An
drew H. Burkeas, a special agent, com
pletes the task cf dispensing with the
cervices cf all those who were connected
in any way tilth the transactions in the
Marysviljf land district, concerning which
there was more complaint than la any
other district. Th<* Call published the
Btory exclusively that there was trouble
in the Marysville district. This wa? dis
puted for a time, and officially, until the
SlarysvUle land office was cleaned out
and a new official head was found for it.
State Mineralogist Aubury pent Horace
Stevens to Marysville to investigate.
Stevens returned a report which was
adopted as his own by Aubury and was
forwarded to Washington. Binger Her
mann was then the Commissioner of the
General l^and office. He sent Andrew H.
I>urke out to look into the charges.
ISurko did not find anything to censure.
Aufcury went tn Washington and called
upon Hermann Â«nd asked him to send
fome one else to verify the report that
had been made by Stevens. This Her
mann declined to do, saying that Uurke's
rr;Â»ort was final. Then Aubury went to
I 'resident Roosevelt and made a state
ment. Since then Hermann, the officials
of the Marysville land office and Burke
have dropped out of the public service.
A more vigorous investigation is supposed
now to be under way. Aubury is satis-
Bed that lie has been justified in the re
port that he sent to Washington by the
result.
The Judge did not enter into the ques
tion as to whether a manufacturer doing
nothing but buying the raw material and
selling the finished product was a la
borer.
"A Chinese manufacturer who engages
in any kind of manual labor about the
establishment, even for the purpose of in
structing his employes, is a laborer un
der the meaning of the exclusion act, and
as such Is not entitled to enter into or
remain in this country as a merchant."
This was the opinion handed down yes
terday by United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock in tha matter of the de
portation of Lin Lung "Wong. This opin
ion, if adopted as a rule of action by the
Chinese bureau, will lead to the deporta
tion of a large number of Chinese pro
prietors of cigar factories, clothing shops,
broom factories and other establishments.
At the time when Chinese laborers In
this country were required to obtain cer
tificates of residence, Lin held a 11500 In
terest in the Pacific Fruit Packing Com
pany at 804 Stockton street and acted as
foreman, his particular duty being to
Bbow the employes how to pack fruit and
vegetables. For the reason that he was
a member of the firm, Lin regarded him
self as a merchant and therefore did not
ask to be registered as a laborer. He re
turned recently from Alaska and was held
up by the Chinese bureau for deportation
for having been found Illegally in this l
country, he not having the certificate re
quired by the exclusion act. The defense
was set up that Lin, having been a mem
ber of the firm at the time registration
was going on, was a merchant.
Judge Heacock decided that Lin, as
foreman of the. cannery and being re
quired to teach the employes how to pack
fruit, was a skilled laborer and the fact
that he owned an interest in the cannery
did not place him outside of that cate
gory.

Local trade in the fruit market was verv
quiet owing to the rain, but there was a steady
demand for choice table Grapes and other
fruits suitably packed for shipment to Pueet
Sound. Receipts of Grapes from all sections
were unusually heavy, as growers evidently ex
pected a period of wet weather and rushed in
all available supplies. The local demand for
large and small packages was very light and
although the Sound steamer took out several
thousand packages, there was a h-avy surplus
unsold at the close. The feeling, however was
steady, as most dealers expected that the' rain
would materially lessen subsequent receipts and
were not inclined to force sales. Receipts of
Strawberries and Raspberries, while moderate
were in excess of the demand; there was a
sharp drop in prices' and quite a quantity was
carried over. About fourteen boxes of Huckle
berries came In from Point Arena and sales
were readily effected at 10c per pound. The
Apple market was quiet locally, but there was
a good demand Tor shipment to near-by points
and prices of fancy stock were well sustained'

VEW TOP.K. Nov. 12.â Pennsylvania and
Visited States Steel preferred again divided
attention and a good degree of influence in
to-day's etock market. The dealings were not
in gucn overwhelming proportions in either
ftock as for the last several days. Pennsyl-
Minia was weak from the outset, but showed
ftubborn resistance in the neighborhood of 112.
The efforts to purport the ftock were aided
at first by the strength shown by United States
Fteel preferred, and by the second United
States Eteel bonds. It was oorr.rr.cn belief that a
very large short interest was being covered
in the steel creferred stock.
The outlook In the labor world was regard
ed aÂ« threatening, and report* of rioting In
connection with the Chicago Street Railway
ftrlke emphasized the feeling. There was
also the report of a cut of 10 per cent in wages
at Fall River, which tiad its effect In the
etitten market aa well as in the stock mar
ket. The rerwrted intention of the United
States Bteel Corporation to retrench their
Ioutl&y for wages $15,000,000. or 10 per cent,
and the Mrlous situation growing out of the
crjal strike in Colorado were added factors in
ehapisg *Â»ntlment. The show of strength in
. sugar wsj <j ue u> hopes of a Cuban reclproc-
Iltjr treaty. Amalgamated , Copper was an
otner Firong feature with legislation. Addi

particularly large young Chickens, and young
Roosters and large Broilers were quoted higher

A local house reports as follows on Wool :
"The Wool traffic, both East and Went. Is very
unsatisfactory, i Many of the large dealers hava
heavy stocks at seaboard . points and their in
ability to move them accounts largely for the
present inactivity in the local market. When
manufacturers reduce supplies and when busi
ness in woolen fabrics shows a marked im
provement over the present dullness In this line
renewed activity. Is looked for in W00L The
various scouring establishments are running to

The newly honored prelates then arose
and went to each of their brother Car
dinals and gave and received the- usual
fraternal embrace, the choir in the mean
while singing softly.
"When the ceremony of the exchange of
embraces was ended the Pope rose, be
stowed the papal benediction on all pres
ent and then withdrew, the halls and
loggias re-echoing with acclamations as
he passed on his way to hia apartments.
After returning thanks in the Sistlne
Chapel, the new Cardinals, with the other
Cardinals, retired to the hall of the con-
Pistory to hold a supplementary, secret
consls'tors. during which the Pope grant
ed them the privilege of participating In
and speaking at meeting* of the con
gregation, placed the Cardinals' ring up
on their fingers and made each of them
a titular bishop of a church in Rome.'
It was only to-day that the Pope signed
the brief officially appointing Cardinal
Del Val Papal Secretary of State, and
making him a member of the congrega
tions cf rites and of extraordinary ec
clesiastical affairs.
The Pope at the secret consistory gave
Cardinal Del Val the title to the church
of Santa Maria ad Praespe. one of the
oldest in Rome. The date of Its founda
tion is not known, but It 13 certain that
it existed in the fifteenth century.
Thereupon the Pontiff, with emotion,
repeated the usual formula in Latin, used
on such occasions, after which he em
braced the five Cardinals tenderlv.
The Pontiff seated himself on the throns
at Xhe end of the hall, while the Car
dinals went to their stalls on either side,
with the BIshoss at the left-
Intense silence then fell over the as
sembled throne and then the new Car
dinals were introduced by the master of
ceremonies, who. while they knelt one by
one before the Pope, held a Cardinal's
hat over their heads.
His Holiness was clothed in full pontifi
cal robes, with the miter, an immense
emerald sparkling on his finger as hÂ©
raised his hand to bless the assemblage.
Preceding him were the celebrated Swiss
Guards, the Cardinals coming close be
hind them. The Xoble Guards came next.
escorting the Pontiff, who was followed
by a train of bishops, priests, monks and
court laymen, at the end of the procesiion
being another detachment of guards.
The corridors through which the cortege
had to pass and the Sala. Regia. where
the consistory was held, were filled to
overflowing, even the places in the three
tribunes, with seats set apart respectively
for the diplomats, the Roman aristocracy
and specially Invited persons, being un
comfortably crowded.
The ceremonies began at 11:30 o'clock,
when the five Cardinals who were to re
ceive the red hat, Mgr. Merry del Val;
Mgr. Callegari. the Archbishop of Padua:
Mgr. Ajuti, the Papal Xuncio at Lisbon;
Mgr. Taliani. the Papal Nuncio at Vienna,
and Mgr. Katzschthaler, the Archbishop
of Salzburg, Austria, went to tne Slstina
Chapel to take the oath before Cardinal*
Oreglia. Rampolla and Macchi, heads of
the three orders of the sacred college.
Mgr. Men-}' del Val and MÂ«t. Callegari
wore their red robes for the first time.
KOME, Xov. 12.â Pope pj as ne iÂ«j Ms
first public consistory to-day. Five Car
dinals, including the Papal Secretary of
Sta.te. Merry del Val. received their red
hats.

theater" will enable the rtremen to in
crease their funds for the widows and
orphans, provided that the public will
give Its assistance.
The firemen are desirous of abolishing
the former system of soliciting public aid
to help the families of their dead com
rades. They purpose to give the public
"its money's worth" and at the same time
help their most worthy cause. .
Every fireman taÂ«the city is authorized
to sell tickets for the big benefit week.
TheÂ«e tickets will be exchanged at the
box office of the Grand Opera-house for
reserved seats and a large attendance Is
hoped for. The by-laws of the Widows
and Orphans' Aid Association provide for
the payment of J1000 to the beneficiaries
of any member in case of death-
PLAN OF BIO BENEFIT.
Recognizing the condition of affairs
Chief Sullivan. Assistant Chief Dougherty
and other officers of the Fire Department
have worked hard to organize the Wid
ows' and Orphans' Aid Association of
the Fire Desmrtment.
Active members of the Fire Department
or of the Mutual Aid Association of tlie
organization are eligible to membrrship
in the society for aiding widows and
orphans or families of the firemen.
The men will contribute the sum of $1
per month, and though the o-?w society
has only been incorporated a few weeks
nearly 400 men of the Fire Department
have already signed the membership roll.
That there is urgent need of a fund
to aid the widows and orphans of the
firemen is disclosed by the record* of the
department. Since 1S96 fifty-four firemen
have died who were actively connected
with the department.
Other firemen, forced to l^ave their
work by illness, have also passed away.
Only the families of the men killed while
In the discharge of their duties received
any aid from the municipality. The fam
ilies of the balance of the men who died
were aided by the men of the department-
In order to guarantee to the family of
a fireman some assis if.; 1 . 1 . j in case of
death calling a member of the depart
ment, the Widows* and Orphans' Aid As
sociation of the San Francisco Fire De
partment has been organized.
TO AID BEREAVED.
If a fireman falls ill while engaged In
his arduous work the city of San Fran
cisco gives him no assistance. The fire
men have a Mutual Aid Association to
care for their comrades who may fall m.
The firemen donate the sum of 51 per
month to the Mutual Aid Association, and
out of these funds pay for medical at
tendance and allow a small sum per week
to their brother members unable to work.
If a member of the San Francisco Fire
Department dies as the result of injuries
received while on duty the city gives half
his salary as a pension to his widow or
minor children for. a certain time. The
fireman whose death Is not directly
caused by his work leaves those near and
dear to him at the mercy of the world.
If he belongs to the Mutual Aid Associa
tion his comrades will assess themselves
in tb* sum of Jl each to aid his family.
This assessment falls very heavily on the
firemen at times.
FIREMEN HELP FAMILIES.
It is true that if a fireman loses his life
in the discharge of his duties the munlci
palty grants a pension 'to the widow or
orphans of the man who died at his post;
but no provision has been made for those
dependent on firemen who may meet
death from natural causes, but Incident
ally due %o the nature of their work. A
fireman exposed to all kinds of weather,
constantly on duty. ''never knowing any
hour of the day or night when he will be
summoned to fight fire, works under a se
vere strain. * /â¢
In the matter of providing for the fami
lies of the gallant men who day and night
guard the lives and property of this com
munity's citizens San Francisco is far be
hind other cities.
The cause of the widow and orphan 1j
one that always appeals to the generous
hearts of the citizens of San Francisco,
and bountiful aid Is sure to be forthcom
ing: through the bter benefit that is to be
given for the "Widows' and Orphans* Aid
Association of the San Francisco Fire
Department, which will take place at the
Grand Opera-house during Christmas
week.

eq^ily persuaded to go to the hospital,
and later in the morning the Vice Consul
cabled his firm in Paris of the predica
ment of its representative.
After being barricaded In his apart
ments at the Palace Hotel for several
days, during which he was laboring un
der the hallucination that he was an ob
ject of ccnteixiDt of the San Francisco
public, Rodolphe J. Metayer, a member
of a large mercantile firm of Paris, was
yefcterday removed to the Ftench Hos
pital, where his apparently hopeless case
of melancholia will be attended to until
his relatives in France can decide what
disposition to make of him.
Metayer, from what could be gleaned
from him during his rational spells, has
been In Sydney for some time inquiring
Into the affairs of a branch house in that
city, and recently returned to San Fran
cisco by way of Victoria, arriving here
Saturday last. When he registered at the
Palace he appeared to be all right men
tally and continued in a rational mood
Â¦until the following day, when he refused
to leave his room and Insisted on his
meals being brought to him. His actions
attracted little attention until early yes
terday morning, when he complained to
one of the attaches of the hotel that mys
terious beings were hovering about his
apartments and were scoffing at him.
Later he eaJi he was ill, and asked that
& physician be summoned. Dr. Albert
J. Noble responded to the call, and pro
nounced Metayer's case one of melan
cholia. To the physician the young
Frenchman told of his visit to Sydney
on a business mission, and then in a ram
bling manner made frequent references
to financial losses, which seemed to great
ly trouble him. He also said that while
In Sydney he attended a ball, and hardly
bad he enured on a discussion of the
two Incidents of his trip before he grew
v-ild.
Judge Troutt granted Jessie A. Gunn a
divorce from Rvis Gunn for neglect and
cruelty, and Judge Seawell severed the
ties uniting Murray E. Taylor to George
W. Taylor on the ground of desertion.
On complaint of Nellie E. Leonard,
Judge Sloss annulled her marriage to
Frank C. Sullivan. The wedding took
place within a year after her divorce from
F. W. Leonard, and in consequence the
ceremony w.xs invalid.
Suits for divorce were filed by Charles
A. Serin against Louise Serin for infidel
ity, Narclsse Lefflori against Clara Lef
fiori for desertion, Annie Jackson against
John Jackson for neglect, arid Irene Mc-
Mahon against Joseph McMahon for de
sertion.
Judge Hebbard annulled the marriage
of W. J. Reed to Selina P. Reed on com
plaint of Reed. Mrs. Reed is insane. He
also granted Horace Wilber Mann a di
vorce from Carlotta Mann for desertion.
Adeline Straub's fondness for having
her parents about her is the cause of the
rift in her matrimonial happiness, if the
allegations made yesterday by Frank
Straub in a complaint for divorce are to
be believed. He says that from the time
of his marriage to Mrs. Straub at San
Jose on July 15 last up to September 30.
when she left him, he was a most misera
ble man and all because of the presence
In his home of the parents of his wife.
Straub alleges that the day following
his marriage Mrs. Straub brought her
father and mother to their house. He did
not object to the presence of the old peo
ple, he says, for a week or so, but when
they showed no signs of cuttting their
visit short he made a few decided re
marks about a man's home being his own
and about the treatment that should be
accorded intruders. Still they remained,
he saya, and finally his wife tegan neg
lecting his Interests in order to cater to
the wants of her relatives. He says that
she would prepare fine meals for them
and never invite him to join them, even
going so far as to compel him to prepare
his own meals. When he objected she
would tell him to mind his own business,
and finally, on September 30, they left
him to his own devices. Before going,
however, says Straub, they drove his two
children by a former marriage into tho
street, carted away all his furniture and
left him, forlorn and miserable, to hunt
up. his little ones and do the best he could
with them in an empty house.
Antoinette Amanda Thumler was grant
ed a divorce for desertion from William
Thumler by Judge Graham. She was also
given permission to resume her maiden
name, McClure. Three weeks after her
marriage to Thumler at Alameda, Jan
uary 29, 1900. he embezzled the funds of
his employer, Alexander Forbes, and ran
away. â¢ Judge Graham also granted a di
vorce to Vivian P. Petltt from Alfred Pet
ltt for neglect, and Nellie L. Fronk from
George Fronk for cruelty.
"I will go on with, the work," said Mrs.
Krebs yesterday, "as soon as I know
whether a sufficient amount of money will
bo raised by the redwood lumber manu
facturers to insure success. I will know
all about that within a week probably.
I think that about J5CX) will be necessary
to meet the cost of preparing an adequate
redwood exhibit."
Mrs. Krebs is a handsome, gray-haired
lady, who appreciates tho compliment
that has been bestowed upon her and
also realizes that the business ability of
women has been recognized.
Recently the redwood lumber manu
facturers have been seriously considering
the advisability of making a display of
redwood in commercial and also :n other
forms at the St. Louis Exposition. The
sugar pine lumber men of the State have
madÂ© plans, by which they hope to aston
ish all spectators by the size of ihe lum
ber to be displayed. The sugar pine men,
for instance, will have an enormous
trunk of a sugar pine tree, sawed into
planks and then put back Into tree shape,
with one tall plank standing on end
among Its fellows to catch tho eyes of
the multitudes. Then there are other
suear pine exhibits that have been pre
viously described in this paper.
The redwood lumber manufacturers
have as great a pride in their output as
tha sugar pine men have in theirs. To
have sugar pine alone exhibited would be
unfortunate. In casting about to have
a committee headed by some one com
petent to insure success for the exhibit
to be made up for St. Louis the redwood
lumber manufacturers have appointed
Mrs. Krebs.
The redwood lumber manufacturers of
California have done a graceful deed.
They are men, with one exception. The
one person of the other sex who Is en
gaged In getting California redwood Into
the markets of the world Is Mrs. Abble
E. Krebs. She Is the president of the
Casper Lumber Company and In that ca
pacity has shown executive and business
ability that have won the respect of all
her competitors In the business world.

"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â A while ago my health began to fail
.because of female troubles. The doctor did not help me. I remem-
bered that "my mother had used I<ydia E. Pinkliam's Vegetable
Compound on many occasions for irregularities and uterine troubles,
and I felt sure that it could not harm me at any rate to give it a trial
"I was certainly glad to find that within a week I felt much better,
: the terrible pains in the back and side were beginning to cease, and at
the time of menstruation I did not have nearly as serious a time as
heretofore, so I continued its use for two months, and at the end of
j that time I was like a new woman. I really have nover felt better in
t my life, have not had a sick headache since, and weigh 20 pounds more
. than I ever did, so I unhesitatingly recommend your medicine." â 3I&3.
