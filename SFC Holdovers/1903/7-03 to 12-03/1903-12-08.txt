The Senate Committee on Military
Affairs to-day resumed its hearing in
the Wood case, with Commander Lu
cien Young of the navy on the stand.
Commander Young was subpÂ«naed by
the Committee on Military Affairs at
the request of Major Rathbone, who
has given the committee a list of ques
tions which he desired to have ad
dressed to the witness. Some of the
questions were ignored by the commit
tee, though much testimony was
brought out in relation, to the charge
that General Wood, after assuming the
duties as governor general of Cuba
employed detectives not connected with
the army to shadow certain army offi
cers and report their actions to Gen
eral Wood.
Commander Young testified that he
occupied the dual positions of captain
of the port of Havana and commander
of the naval station at Havana. Un
der the first position he was subordi
nate to General Wood, but under the
latter in no way amenable to Generai
Wood's orders. The witness said he
discovered detectives shadowing him
and that upon investigation he learned
that General Tasker H. Bliss. General
Charles F. Humphrey and Major E.
Ladd also were followed by detectives.
He asserted that he knew the detectives
were in the pay of General Wood.
In reference to his recall from the
post at Havana Commander Young
said he was assured by General Wood
that he was very sorry and unable to
understand the order, which had been
received from Washington. Commander
Young said that when he, arrived in
Washington he learned that the recall
had been at the suggestion of General
Wood and that there is correspondence
on file at the War Department to prove
this assertion.
WOOD EMPLOYED SLEUTHS.
It is the general opinion of members
of the Senate, however, that the nomi
nees will retain their old rank until the
nominations are confirmed, despite the
fact that all of the officers affected
have been serving for nearly three
months under the advanced rank and
pay to which they will be entitled when
confirmed. On this theory, General
Wood will cease to be a major general
and will resume his rank of brigadier
general and hold it until he Is con
firmed in the higher rank. When he is
confirmed, however, he will receive a
commission dated August 8 and ad
vanced pay will take effect from that
time.
Notice has been given by the com
mittee to Senator Hanna and Senator
Teller, who made the protests against
the confirmation of General Wood to
be major general, that they must have
all of thPir witnesses here before De
cember 16, when, it is expected, the
investigation will be closed. It is be
lieved by opponents of General Wood
that this order will have the effect of
curtailing the extent of the Inquiry.
It has not yet been decided whether it
will be necessary to summon any more
witnesses from Cuba, thouph it Is
known that several persons who have
been before the committee w!ll be re
called.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â President
Roosevelt to-day sent to the Senate
the nomination of General Leonard
"Wood to be a major general of the
army and the nomination of 167 other
army officers whose promotions depend
upon that of General Wood.' Accom
panying these nominations were those
of about twenty-flve civilian appoin
tees, Including that of Dr. W. H. Crum
(colored) to be Collector of the Port of
Charleston, S. C, and some others
whom the President nominated in the
last recess.
These appointments are considered
by the President and his advisers to
be recess appointments. The question
of their status has been thor
oughly discussed by the President
â¢with the best lawyers connected
with the administration, and In
Congress. The conclusion has been
reached that between the time of the
falling of President Pro Tem. Frye's
gavel signifying the conclusion of the
extraordinary session and the calling to
order of the Senate in the regular ses
sion of Congress an appreciable lapse
cf time occurred. In this time the ap
pointments technically were made.
They are regarded by the administra
tion as recess appointments and the
appointees, therefore, will receive the
pay and exercise all the authority of
the rank to which they are promoted.
The commissions of the army officers
have been made out on this under
standing. All of them are rated back
to the time last summer when the ap
pointments were originally made.
SENATORS TAKE OTHER VIEW.
At the close Governor Odell said he
would give the Missourlans two weeks

Judee Harvey then produced a num
ber of affidavits constituting the liis
eÂ«~-uri end of the case. The principal of
these was by former Lieutenant Oov

l^g-ed bribery of the legislative com
mUtee through him at the instance of
IÂ»aniel J. K^lly of New York. who. Lr-e

LEE AMONCJ THE ACCUSERS.
In his statement Zeigler denied em
phatically that lie had committed any
bribery or that he was a fugitive from
justice, and declared that the whole
proceeding was a malicious act of op
pression, inspired chiefly by his per
sonal enemies. These enemies he
named as Evelyn B. Baldwin, whom lie
says he discharged for failure to carry
out faithfully the Zfigrler-Baldwin Arc
tic expedition: Patterson Bain, whose
enmity, he says, crew <Â«ut of anti-alum
prosecutions in Missouri, and F. A.

through Zelplcr's attempt . to obtain
control of the Provident Chemical

The Missouri authorities were repre

Sheriff Smith tf Cole County. Million
aire Zeigler was present in person with
his counsel. John M. Bowers, Delancey

J. Underwood and John D. Lindsay.
Bowers argued that thÂ» papers in the
case were not regular in that they did

Â¦was in the State of Missouri commit
ting the alleged crime. Crow main
tained that if the acts and contentions
of the State of Missouri were not to be
given full faith, but were to be disput
ed, the burden of proof was upon thooe
attacking them. A lively tilt between
the lawyers on each side followed.
Attorney General Crow repelled in
dijmar.tly what he called an insult to
a sovereign State, its chief executive
and its prosecuting officers.
"I do not know the gentleman who
n*kes this charge," he said, "but I

) SALT LAKE, Utah,; Dec. 7.â In a
conference to-day between Governor.
Wells and members of the miners'
union, headed by State Organizer
Charles Demolll, the Governor pre
dicted civil war in Utah if the strike
were not spee,dily ended. ' Speaking to
the representatives of the strikers,
Governor Wells said:
."I honestly believe, gentlemen, that
If there is much further effort to se
cure recognition of the union and to
prolong the strike the sentiment in
the State is such that.lt will be only
a question of time when men from all
sections of the State will shoulder
their rifles and go down there and run
the agitators out of the State. I think
you are wrong in pursuing this matter
further at the present time."
The Governor warned them against
any lawlessness and, turning to De
molll with a smile, said:
. "We will give you a free passport
out of the State and I am sure the
people would like to see you go back
to Colorado." . . â¢
Demolli, however, has returned to tie

JUDGMENT OF NEBRASKA
COURT IS REVERSED
United States Tribunal Renders an
Â«, Important Decision in the Mat-:
ter of a Usury Suit.
.WASHINGTON, Dec. ".âIn an opin
ion by Justice White the Supreme
Court o4 the United States, to-day re
versed the decision of the Supreme
Court of Nebraska in the case of the
Schuyler National Bank of Schuyler,
Nebr., versus George Thrush and oth
ers. The case involved a question of
the exaction of usury by the bank.
â¢Thrush and his wife were debtors to
the president of the bank ; in the sum
of $5000 and. they gave a note for that
amount, with interest at the rate of 12
per cent. This rate of Interest was
usurious under the Nebraska State law,
and Thrush asked for a computation
of the interest, which showed that,
counting the payment of interest as the
payment of principal, as provided for
by the statute, the note. had been re
duced to $200.
The State court held this plea to be
valid, on the ground that 'usury was
governed by the State and not by Fed
eral'law, inasmuch as the note was
made payable to an officer of the bank
and not. to the bank itself. Justice
White's opinion reversed the finding,
and was favorable to the contention of
the bank that the case came within- the
purview of the Federal law and that
the Interest payments could not be
computed- as payments of principal.

VIENNA. Dec. 7.V-A11 of the power
and Influence of the powerful Austrian
court has been put Into motion to sup
press the scandal and hide the tragedy
in Wlndisch-Graetz, Palace at Prague.
From everv source near the throne or
controlled by it pour denials that the
young, beautiful and wealthy Princess
Elizabeth of .W'ndisch-Graetz, grand
daughter at once of the Emperor of
Austria, and, of the. King of. the Bel

she 'surprised in the apartments qf her

" Despite these inspired denials, which
have been telegraphed to every capital
in Europe and. are being widely circu
lated by the aristocracy and. the police
of every, city, from St." Petersburg to
London, from Stockholm to Rome; press
correspondents emphatically reaffirm
every statement concerning the affair.
The Princess, who dearly loved her
husband and gladly relinquished her
imperial, rights for him, learned of her
lovely rival's presence. The exact
source of her information is not known,
of course, and may never be But it
is not improbable that a. man whom
thelactress had rejected carried it to
her/ Maddened by jealousy, infuriated
by the betrayal and yet ashamed of it,
the' Princess made her way to her hus
band's apartments, drove from the
door, at pistol's point, the valet Sn
guard there, entered, found the actress
and' shot her -with a' revolver which
Prince Otto had himself given to his

* Naval officials decline to say whether
the dispatch of , the Atlanta to the Gulf
of Darien is the result' of any intima

of Colombia. They content themselves
with expressing the opinion that it will
be impossible for : Colombian troops to
march overland to Colon or Panama
because of: the' Impassability ;of the
country to, be traversed. I Nevertheless
the departure of the vessel is regarded
as significant, as indicating the inten

NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â Startling dis
closures, based upon information ob
tained through a confession made by
Max Karnfield, a public fire adjuster,
who has been convicted of fraud In
connection with a claim of loss he had
himself put in and who will be sen
tenced on Friday, were made to-night
by Assistant District Attorney Garvan.
The cases of twelve persona who are
suspected of having defrauded insur
ance companies in a similar manner
will â¢ be presented to the Grand Jury
within a few days. Among them are
three lawyers, several merchants, sev
eral public fire adjusters and two or
three adjusters employed by fire In
surance companies. Garvan declared
that fire Insurance companies have lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars
through paying false claims of loss.
One of these persons is a merchant
worth $500,000 and another la president
of a corporation which employs 400
men.
/ Fire patrolmen, men employed by the
board of fire underwriters to take
charge of properties after \ftres have
been extinguished and save as much
property as possible, Garvan alleges,
have been in league with the fire ad
justers. Instead of doing their duty,
he says, he knows that in many in
stances they have purposely damaged
goods by water for a fee paid by fire
adjusters.

The Judgment due Samuel Stevenson
i& $100,000, for which secured notes have
been given. This leaves only $452,267
due to outside creditors on merchan
dise accounts. It is to the holders of
these outside claims that Dowle made
the offer of settlement.
The creditors who were represented
at the meetlnj thought the proposal
reasonable and a committee was ap
pointed to seek further details. If this
committee finds that Dowie's statement
of debts and resources is correct, it is
said, they will accept the proposal at
once and then seek to have the bank
ruptcy proceedings dismissed. Dowie's
statement of his resources included
land, buildings, stock in Zlon's lace in
dustry, bills receivable and other items
not named. Of his total Indebtedness
that due for bank deposits and shares
of stock in the various Zion industries
was placed at $3,193,679, maturing in
1913 and 1923. Bills payable on account
of land were placed at $313,403, due in
1903 and 1908.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â In a statement

tangle at Zion City Will be straightened
out in a satisfactory manner.
In Dowie's communication bis assets
are declared to be $18,845,210 and his lia
bilities only $4,058,349.
Of the liabilities- $452,267 Is merchan
dise Indebtedness. Note3 bearing 5 per

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â Charles
F. Murphy . is aimiog . high for his
friend, Mayor-Select McClellan of New
York. If statements made to-day by
members of the House from New York
and by other friends of the Mayor
elect are to be relied upon, the leader
of Tammany desires to present the
name of McClellan to the Democrats of
the country as. a candidate for Presi
dent, and he would like to do it in the
next national convention instead \ of
waiting until 1908. That, in the opinion
of Representatives from whbm the in
formation comes, is the reason Murphy
is fighting fihy of making any agree
ment with David B. Hill to have the
New York delegation to the. next na
tional convention vote solidly for Judge
Parker.
No one has dreamed that the Tam
many leader would take the man * he
made Mayor and seek to make Presi
dential timber out of him, all within
one year. But that is the only construc
tion given by. members of Tammany
who have been asked to explain the
denial by Murphy of any agreement
with Hill.
It is admitted that there is a very
strong feeling in New York In favor of 1
Parker. It is said that if Judge Park
er's 6nly support was Hill's strength,
then a close' fight might be looked for
in the' State convention.
Whether there will be a contest de
pends largely on the strength McClel- 1
l^n can^give himself during .the first
four or five months of his administra
tion as Mayor.

NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â Sensational
charges, against the old management
of the National Salt Company and Its
present receivers were made to-day,
when the matter of the sale of the
property of the company in this State
by the receiver to Samuel D. Halliday
came up in the" Supreme Court.
Halliday and the .receivers, Nathan
S. Beardslee and Frank P. McDermott,
asked Justice Leventritt to confirm the
sale.
This was opposed "by a number of
stockholders, who claimed that the
former management had mismanaged
the affairs of the company and had
paid JSOO.OOO unearned dividends out of
borrowed money, to enhance the value
of t^ieir stock holdings; that in the or
ganization of the National Salt Com
pany, with a capital of $30,000,000 to
take over the National Salt Company's
property, Â¦ there was a conspiracy on
the part of Milo M. Belding, Edward L. 1
Fuller and Joy Morton to "freeze out"
minority stockholders of the National
Salt Company, and in pursuance of this
polipy an application for a receivership
and the sale of the property was made
in- the New Jersey courts. Receiver
Beardslee. it is charged, discouraged
intending bidders on the New York
property, telling them that the prop
erty would be Bold to the International
Salt Company, and It is further charged
that Halliday in buying the property
acted as an agent for the company,
and that the property sold for $337,500
was really worth $1,250,000, and. even
at forced sale, had a value of $750,000.

he has no personal knowledge of the
accounts of the Fruit Growers' Ex r

which that concern \ may have had
i with the Porter Bros. Company, J.
j Ogden Armour, when placed on the
stand- before Bankruptcy Referee
"VVean, to-day declared that he could
I not help the creditors of the latter
j company to discover how much money
President James S. "Watson received as
rebates. Armour, who is the prln
jclpal owner of the Fruit Growers' Ex
press Company, was on. the stand for
two hours, all of which time he , was
busy answering or. refusing to answer
questions put to him by Attorney Bach
of New York. The lawyer, who was
acting for New York creditors of the
Porter Bros.- Company, had previously
learned from General Manager Rob
bins of the Fruit Growers' Express;
pompany-that Watson had received
about 1 $700,000 . as rebates from the
express company in six years. Bach
thought Armour 1 would be able to
give more information on this sub
ject, and also' tell how much Watson
received from the railroad companies
which' used cars, of the Fruif Growers'
Express Company 'in \ transporting
goods for" the Porter Bros, cqneern,
but in this the New York lawyer was
disappointed. , ""
The witness said that Armour & Co.
had made large loans to Watson and
the" Porter Bros. Company, though
he did ' not ' know Â¦ how. 5 much-' or for
what purpose. Armour declared that
the company's only claim against the
Porter Bros.' estate to-day is for $60,
000, which is secured by Mr. .Watson's
life Insurance policy and stock of the
bankrupt company. Â¦

GENTLEMEN : â Some two years ago I was so run down that I lacked strength, had no ap-
petite and could not sleep nights. Sometimes it seemed as though my back would break in two
after stooping. I had to get up many times during the night to urinate and go often through the day.
After having the best physicians prescribe for me without relief, I decided from my symptoms that
the medicine I needed was Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and bladder remedy.
After trjing a sample bottle with good results I purchased six bottles of the regular size, and after
taking them was entirely cured. Swamp-Root is a wonderful remedy when a man is not feeling
well, after exposure or loss of sleep and irregular meals. It is also a great medicine to tone up a
man's system. Other members of the Police force are using and recommending Swamp-Root. They,
like myself, cannot say too much in praise of this great remedy.
The officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the
good you have accomplished in the compounding of Swamp-Root. -Y.

Mrs. Coit added one most important
â¢ feature to her. previous evidence, i "Af
! ter shooting Major McClung," she\aid,
\ "Garnett advanced to me with' the pis-
exander Garnett. â¢ *
She repeated the testimony she gave
to Coroner Leland when that official
took her evidence in her rooms last
week. Mrs. Colt told of being In her
rooms with Major McClung, who had
paid a friendly call; of the sudden en-,
trance of Alexander Garnett in an ex
cited manner, of the latter's wild ap
pearance and of his drawing a revolver
from his waistband and of the effort
of Major McClung to disarm Garnett
and of the firing of the shot by Gar
nett that resulted in the death of the
man who had sought to defend her from
murderous attack.
Questioned by District Attorney. By
ington, Mrs. Coit once again told of
theproceedlngs that took place in her
rooms at the Palace Hotel on the even
iqg of November 25 last, which resulted
in the killing of Major McClung by Al-
seated, Alexander Garnett was re
leased from the dock. He walked
with a jaunty air to the attorneys'
table and took a chair next to Mrs.
Coit's nurse and then arose and
walked to the end of the table and
sat next to his attorney. W. Alford.
Garnett never once looked at Mrs.
Coit and the woman, whose testimony
is so important in the case, avoided
looking in the direction of the man
who shot down her old friend in her
presence without warning or cause.
All the witnesses In the case were
present in the court when Judge Fritz
announced that he was ready to
begin the preliminary examination.
Mrs. Coit was the first witness called
and she took her scat on the witness
stand and was sworn by Judge Fritz.
Mrs. Coit was cool and collected and
gave her evidence In a convincing
manner. There was no attempt on
the part of the witness to shield the
accused man. On the contrary, she
testified to fact3 that were most dam
aging.
EVIDENCE IS DAMAGING.
When Judge Fritz called the case
of Garnett, Mrs. Coit entered the court
room, accompanied by her hospital
nurse and Attorney Creswell.
She was garbed in black and her
face was hidden by a black veil, the
only relief to the somber ctolor being
the white lace edging to the sleeves
of her coat. 'â¢ -~.\ '-.
The eyewitness to the murder of
Major McClung was given a seat at
the attorneys' table. Her nurse sat
on one side of her and her attorney
on the other Bide.
A few seconds after Mrs. Coit was
IS GARBED IN BLACK.
Garnett listened closely to the evi
dence in the Feld case, but he betrayed
no emotion. He shifted his seat in the
dock as he listened, to the evidence
and kept his eyes on the various wit
nesses.
Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock Coit. the soli
tary eyewitness to the murder of
Major J. W. McClung by Alexander
Garnett, which occurred in Mrs. Coit's
apartments at the Palace Hotel on the
evening of November 2^ last, gave her
testimony yesterday morning in the
courtroom cf Police Judge Fritz, at
the preliminary examination of the ac
cused man. .â¢Â¦*Â¦ '.*
Mrs. Colt, attended by a trained
hospital nurse and Attorney Creswell,
arrived at the Hall of Justice in a
carriage, and was at once escorted to
the office of District Attorney Bying
ton. _ '
Mrs. Coit remained in the office o.
the District Attorney until a few
minutes before the case of Garnett was
called by Judge Fritz.
Garnett, the man accused of the
murder of Major McClung, was taken
to the courtroom half an hour before
his case was called. He was locked up
in the dock and listened to the testi
mony in the murder case of ex-Police
Officer Feld, who ruthlessly shot and
killed his father-in-law. Fritz Dirking.
Dr. G. Martin and Dr. G., F. Shiels
also testified as to the condition of Ma
jor, McClung and his being informed
that he . was fatally wounded and was
likely to die. ,
Dr. Shiels, an old friends of , Major
McClung, again recited 'the. statement
TESTIMONY OF, DOCTORS.
Mrs. Dr. Whitney was the nextwlt
ness to follow Mrs. Coit. The evidence
of Mrs. Whitney showed how Garnett
had appeared at her rooms In the Pal
ace Hotel on the night of November 25
and asked for Dr. Whitney. The wit
ness described Garnett as being exclr
ed and appearing in despair. Mr e.
Whitney also recounted how she had
accompanied Garnett to" Mrs. Colt's
rooms and finding Major McClung in a
wounded condition and of her summon
ing Dr. Shiels to attend the wounded
man. . ' -,Â¦>-..
At the close of her evidence Mrs. Colt
left the witness stand and, accompa
nied by her nurseand her attorney, de
parted from the courtroom. The party
descended to the street and entered a
carriage and returned to the Palace
Hotel. , -
"Did you not ask Garnett," said At
torney Alford, "where he had placed
some oysters he had bought for you
just previous to his leaving your room
that night." . . ,
"I did not," was the emphatic reply
of Mrs. Colt.
Attorney Alford then tried to show
that Garnett had no motive to harm
Mrs. Colt by questioning her as to the
terms on which Garnett lived free of
charge at the Brooklyn Hotel and that
she did not have any power to order
him from the place, as his living at tho
hotel was guaranteed In the lease be
tween herself as owner and her ten
ants.
Prompted by Garnett. his attorney
asked Mrs. 'Colt If she had not parted
very friendly on the night on which he
had quarreled with her over a game of
cards.
Questioned as to Garnett's motive in
coming to her rooms with the intention
of harming her, Mrs. Colt again told of
how Garnett lived free at the Brooklyn
Hotel, which she owned,. and how she
had heard from McClung that Garne.tt
feared he would be turned out of the
hotel as a result of the insulting lan
guage he had used to Mrs. Colt over a
game of bridge whist.
QUESTIONS OF MOTIVE.
Mrs. Colt told' of the insulting lan
guage used to her by Garnett ten days
previous to the murder, when he swore
at her over a game of bridge whist,
when she ordered him from her rooms
and told him never to return.
A hush fell upon the crowded court
room when District Attorney Byington
showed Mrs. Colt the revolver with
which Garnett had shot McClung. In
a perfectly cool manner, Mrs. Colt ad
justed her lorgnette, looked at the
nickel plated revolver In the hand of
the District Attorney, and said that
it looked like the pistol she saw in the
hands of Garnett when McClung was
shot.
Mrs. Cult then recounted the strug
gle she had with Garnett in the bath
room, where she had gone to usejthe
telephone to summon <r^}, and of the
.arrival of a maid of the hotel and the
subsequent coming of the doctors and
Garnett's departure, after throwing the
pistol at her feet.

The Rev? Dr. Larkin submitted In
great candor that it was hard to ac
quire a state of patience," long suffer
ing and brotherly love. While he had
witnessed self-abnegation among a
congregation that was edifying and en
couraging, on the other hand at con
ferences it seemed to appear as though
all things would go to smash in the
"scramble for office and for. place." He
admitted that he himself had not yet
reached that point of self-abnegation,
b'ut he would never be diplomatic, and
yet w^re he appointed to a position
undesirable, he had prepared to sus
tain himself and family. His 'opinion
was that if bishops and elders would
make appointments without bias or fa
voritism there were men who would in
that event go to the end of the world
without complaint. Â»-~_
The Rev. Dr. M. C. Harris held that

The Methodist ministers met at Ep
worth League Hall yesterday. The
Rev. L. H. Baker, j an evangelist from

clared that there was not enough

there was not that Christian abnega

he knew to be equally competent, but
who was being appointed to a "hard-

that there must be subordination some

The Rev. E. E. Clarke was of the
opinion that the Intelligence of the
people was sometimes overrated and
held that from his experience the peo
ple did not study DarWin and Spencer.
The Rev. Mr. Clarke did not attribute
the, lack of attendance at churches to
unbelief, but" he considered that the
swirl of modern enjoyment was re
sponsible.
Following the Rev. Mr. Clarke came
the Rev. Dr. John T. Wills, who de
clared it as his opinion that the people
of San Francisco did not fail attend
ing the churches owing to any un
belief, because he and other ministers
could testify that the very men who
did not do so were the very first â¢ in
time of trouble to come to the min
ister. That showed belief in those
very men who abstained from attend
ing their church, a neglect probably
due to surrounding circumstances.
Redolpho'B. Hummel, a student at
Stanford University, spoke of the great
good that was being achieved by the
prayer circles in which Stanford stu

CHRISTIAN ABNEGATION.
Dr. Vanhee asked whether any of the
sciences could create the -sun, the
moon, the stars. Could it be said of
science, he asked, that she was self
existing, that she was capable of crea
tion? He replied in the negative and
declared that God was the original
source of all knowledge and his will
was revealed "by holy men of old and
proved by the miracles'of Jesus Christ,
the only mediator between God and
man. "\,. ''..'Â¦Â¦
SCIENCE XOT' CREATIVE.
The variocs minsters, clubs and mis
sionary societies were busy in this city
yesterday. The Presbyterian ministers
met at the" Presbyterian Mission Home,
Sacramento street, and listened to a
profound address by the Rev. Dr. Edgar
Vanhee, late of Sydney, Australia. The
doctor gave a lucid explanation of his
subject, "Science Subordinate to Reve
lation."
Among other things Dr. Vanhee said
that if people would realize the authen
ticity of God there would be greater
faith, greater zeal, less skeptics and
few empty churches.
There were people, he ; said, who
thought that religion was for the weak
minded and he asked, if that were the
case, hoyr was It that religion had stood
for civilizing the world, had stood the
tests of mighty war and^had remained
victorious and pre-eminent over polit
ical opposition?
Dr. Vanhee asked 'whether any hu
man intelligence could give the world
a religion to take its place? He con
tended that the prophecies of the scrip
ture were being fulfilled , dally and re
futed "the cssertions sometimes, made
that the scripture was antiquated. He
feared there were those who expected
that the church should lean to the car
nal â to the expounding of sensational
politics of the day, and many required
the accessories of highly paid vocalists
as a means to invite the congregations.
In holding that science was subordinate

window and had his hands badly
burned.
Mrs. Paine, with her face, hair and
hands badly burned, rushea down the
hall warning the lodgers, several of

ing was a roaring furnace when the
railroad shopmen arrived on the scene
with their fire apparatus, but when
they heard that'people were still in the
building they dashed in and brought
out a body burned to a crisp. C. E. Van
Dame, a timekeeper, was in the hall

ablaze. He is positive he saw two bod

The police, who were notified of thÂ«

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center street, Dec.*? 1 .
Henry Plltz, master mariner, had
$123 60 in his pockets when ha toot, ofi
his trousers before going to bed last
night, but when he got up this morn
ing to put those same trousers on again
there wasn't a cent in the pockets. A!
thief had come in the night and shifted
the whole $123 50 from Captain Plitz"s
pockets into his own. But he was kind
enough to leave the trousers, which ac
counts for Captain Plltz not being In
bed to-day for the lack of another pair.
How the thief happened to know
that Captain Plltz's pantaloons were
very near a window last night with
$123 50 in them neither the loser nor tha
police venture to say. All that the mas
ter mariner knows Is that tho money 19
gone and he'd like to have it back.
The trousers that were rifled were
hanging over the back of a chair near
a window when Captain Plitz retired
last night. The captain's home is at
2909 Grove street . and somewhat iso
lated, so there was nothing tn disturli
the thief. It is supposed that he climb
ed upon a fence within reach of tha
window and dragged 'the trousers into
the cold night air. Then, after going
through the pockets, he put the apparel
back where he found it.

Owner Identifies Keys Found Among

OAKLAND, Dec. 7. â Mrs. T. W.
Fowler, residing at 1220 Masonic ave
nue, San Francisco, has identified a
bunch of keys found among the ef
fects of David Kiniry and Frank J.
Goldstein as the property of her hus
band. The keys, with other, property,
were stolen from the Fowjer resi
dence.
This evidence of further crime has
been taken in charge by the police
against the time that Kiniry may be
captured. Though ten days have gone
since Policeman Smith was killed.
Chief of Polire Hodgkins is without a
trare of tho fugitive Kiniry. The po
lice have about given up all hope for
his arrest-
Members of Policeman Smith's fam
ily have indorsed the position assumed
by the patrolman's mother, touching
the testimonial fund that is being
raised by citizens in token of apprecia
tion of the brave young officer's stand.
His relatives desire that the fund
should be used as a reward to be paid
to the proper person or persons In the
event Kiniry shall be captured.
In explanation of the fact that Gov
ernor Pardee has authorized a State
reward of only S200 for IÂ£miry's ar
rest, word has come from Sacramento
showing that the last Legislature ap
propriated only $750 for rewards.
Owing to the rneagerness of the allow
ance, the Governor has bten com
pelled to refuse applications in a num
ber of cases for the issuance of reward
proclamations. The amount offered In
the Smith case is more than one-quar
ter of the entire appropriation.
The inquest was held at the Cor
oner's office at 10 a. m. to-day, the
verdict being that death was due to
strychnine, self-administered, while
the deceased was mentally unbalanced.

"I fancy another clerk, either in the

office, in figuring the rate^ was misled
or found a number blank and endeav

two tax bills instead of one. At any

that any prosecution will be neces

been discovered that the personal and
the real property belonged to the same
company and the number 47,614 oppo-

This left this number a blank, the in

The main points of the honor system
consist in pledging the student to pass
examinations honorably and to sign a
statement at the end of each paper
saying that he has neither received nor
Riven assistance. If he is caught
cheating he is piven a trial by the
presidents of the four undergraduate
classes, who fix the penalty according
to the nature of the offenses and make
their recommendations to the faculty.
The agitation for the establishment
of the honor system in the University
of California was renewed 'to-day
through the publication in The Dally
Californlan of a communication from
William L. Finley, a former editor of
that paper and president of the English
Club. In this letter Mr. Finley refers
to the attempt that is being made to
establish the honor system at Stanford
University and points' out the benefits
that will accrue to this university
through thÂ« workings of the system.
The 6tudents voted against its estab
lishment in 1902 mainly on the ground,
he says, that they believed it would
bring with "it spying and tattling.
Tangible form will be given to the
movement tÂ»X the semi-annual meeting
of the student body next Friday morn
ing. At that time the matter will be
brought up again and a committee ap
pointed by President Max Thelen to
collect data. If the committee believes
the honor system worth the attempt
to secure its adoption by the whole
student body, then a vigorous cam
paign of education will, be begun.
There will be literature on the subject
and letters published in the college pa
pers, the idea being to promote a full
discussion. After the proposed sys
tem is sufficiently advertised it will be,
submitted to a vote.

ALAMEDA, Dec. 7. â City Trustee
W. M. Bowers introduced two ordi
nances at the meeting of the Town
Trustees to-night to repeal the ordi
nances recently passed, awarding the
two local railroads' franchises to the
Southern Pacific Company, and which
were â¢ refused by the corporation, be
cause the life of the privileges was
limited to twenty-flv,e years in each
ordinance, when the company wanted
them for thirty-three years and forty
four years, respectively.
In addition to rescinding the original
enactments, the measures submitted
to-night provide for granting the fran
chises to the. Southern Pacific Com
pany on the terms it demanded. There
are a | number of details and amend
ments to be made to the ordinances
before , they will be ready for final
action. City Trustee Bowers stated
to-night that the object of introducing
the ordinances in an unfinished form
was to have them shaped as quickly as
possible by the City Trustees.
While practically every demand made
by the Southern Pacific with respect
to the franchises will be granted in the
new ordinances, the most important
concession is that of the life of the
privileges, forty-four years for the
north side line and thirty-three years
for the south side, line.

, The result of a suit now being tried
before Superior Judge Ogden to re
cover on a note will show a remarkable
lapse of memory on the part of the de
fendant or a bold forgery on the part
of some one else. The note is for $175
with, interest at 1% per cent a month
and is dated November 27, 1877. The
total claimed to be due on it is $1050.
The holder of the note is Robert Col
lins and he says that it was given him
by Ignacio McCourtney .In payment of
three months' work at $45 a month and
$40 borrowed money. McCourtney de
nies he ever saw Collins or that he
worked for him, and declares the note
is a forgery. . â¢ ~. - r
â¢ The note bears evidence of age and
Is written on an ordinary sheet of pa
per, in purple ink. Collins says the note
was given 'him in Sacramento County.
McCourtney acknowledges he lived
there at that time. Collins tells hdw he
helped McCourtney lay a water pipe on
his ranch- and goes into details. Mc-
Courtney remembers laying the pipe,
but says his father helped him and no
one else. * '
The matter is now one of veracity
between the men, and McCourtney is
trying to show by other documents
he signed about that time that the note
is not in his handwriting. It reads,
"For value received twenty-five years
after date I promise to pay Robert Col
lins $175 with interest at 1% per cent
a month."

become secret service detectives."
Ellison told about his trip to Califor
nia on business, of accidentally meeting
Musher to-day on the street, of de
manding first that he settle the $60 in
debtedne'ss and also pay Ellison's rail
road fare to this State.
"That's business," commented Sili
con.
"Musher handed me his purse," con
tinued the merchant. "It contained
$6 75. but I- was not satisfied and I de
cided to turn him over to the police.
He made such a row in the hotel that
the proprietor caused his arrest. And
that's the story. If I can get him
back to Minneapolis I shall have him
punished." . .
Musher claims he arrived four or live
days ago and was on a trip to find a
good business . location.
"During my absence on a business
trip Musher and one of my competitors
in business in Minneapolis told David
Harris, with whom ' I had done much
business and whom I owed money, that
I was going to skip out. After my return
Musher ttÂ«ok a hand in this business
and ha.l my place attached. I owed
Harris J147C 33. I paid him $1000 cash
and returred goods sufficient to make
up the balance. It was a straight, le
gitimate business transaction and Har
ris knows now that he acted through
the misrepresentations of rivals.
"Musher came to my place of busi
ness in Minenapolis last September and
wanted to become a partner with me,"
said Ellison. "He showed me a lot of
what he said were United States bonds
and securities and asked me to intro
duce him to my bank people. He pro
tended to. be well fixed. I loaned him
$25 and later gave him a $35 suit for his
wife, for which he has not paid me.
PLACE IS. ATTACHED.
In spite of Musher's denials of
wrongdoing, Ellison reeled off a story
of swindling and declared that he
would take steps to prosecute the man
he had accidentally encountered in Cal
ifornia. ;i.,j-VuÂ»
Musher claims to be a traveling
salesman with his home at Atlanta, Ga.
He said he had a wife In St. Louis and
later asserted that she was with him in
Oakland. 'Â¦,..
"This man Musher took the certifi
cate away from me several days sgo
after asking me to allow him to in
spect 1 it. I did not know what had be
come of him."
Further search of his effects brought
to light a certificate from the officcr3
of the Beth Jacob Hebrew Synagogue
of this city accrediting Morris Block as
the rabbi of that organization. Detec
tive Kyte found Block, who said:
Musher evaded the question as to his
financial standing , by saying he had
been drawing against the accounts and
did not know how he stood.
Â¦'Â¦ Smash went a stiff right-hander from
Ellison. Musher ducked, but the blow
caught him on the back of the head.
Then Police Captain "Wilson stepped in
and stopped the fight.
Musher's story, in brief, was that El
lison, who conducted the New York
Silk Garment Company in the Boston
Block, Minneapolis, had owed David
Harris, a Grand street. New York, mer
chant, $1400 and that he (Musher) had
forced Ellison to settle the bill and had
been paid $25 commission by Ellison
for adjusting the trouble. Musher as
serted that his antagonist tried torday
to compel him to pay back the $25,
hence the quarrel.
Musher was burdened with a lot of
documents', bank books and . papers,
which have been made the objects of a
careful police Inquiry in view of Elli
son's flat accusations that the man is
a' swindler. The first thing that at
tracted the police eye was a bunch of
Confederate bills of $100. $50 and $20
denomination. A bank book of the
Federal Bank of New York showing
$11,000 deposit, a "book from the Lowry
National Bank of Atlanta, Ga.. with a
credit of $3040; a check for $8000 drawn
on the National Park Bank of New
York by Nathan Musher and- stamped
"paid" were among the papers.
EVADES THE QUESTION.
"You're a thief!" shouted Ellison as
he confronted his man in the police sta
tion.
/"You're a thief!" echoed Musher.
Ellison, claiming that Musher de
frauded him, hustled him off to his
room at the Hotel Crellln and there de
manded a settlement. In the midst of
the dispute that followed, the policÂ©
were called by Ellison, who stalked off
to the City Prison with hi3 man, Hotel
keeper Fred Jordan having caused
Musher's arrest. Musher retaliated by
charging Ellison with disturbance and
also with taking his purse. Ellison
surrendered the purse, declaring that
its contents had been given to him in
part settlement of the claim he had
over the man. _
Out of an unexpected meeting in
Oakland this afternoon between J. R.
Ellison, a merchant of Minneapolis,
Minn., and Nathan Musher, late also
of the Flour City, came arrests, accu
sations of theft and all sort* of swind
ling, a fight and a police investigation
which may or may not develop more
seriously than the charges of disturb
ing the peace that are registered at the
City Prison against the men.

.The case was taken before Judge
Melvln, who stated that he was bound
to make the order asked for, but that
he disliked doing so. and that Lewis
deserved indictment by the grand Jury.
This afternoon, in charge of two de
tectives, Lewis visited the County
Clerk's office, secured a license and
married Miss McKay. * _ .
Two different wives in one day is a
record made by Vincent M. Lewis, a

Lewis, however, and Judge 'Â¦> Melvln

served being indicted for perjury.
Two years ago this month, Lewis,
who was then 18 years of age, went
with Sarah Hood to San Rafael and
the pair were secretly married there.
In order > to get a license he had to
swear that he was 21 years of age.
They never lived together as husband
and wife and a few days fl-go Lewis
was arrested on complaint of Rose Mc-
Kay, who alleged that he had promised

The Pope walked among the stu

Kennedy, in presenting the stu
dents, said: "Holy father, here are
ninety-six students of the American
college to present their homage and to
give evidence of their faith and their
loyalty toward your holiness and the
holy see. They have come a long dis
tance from their native country to this
holy city to drink In learning and pie
ty under the shadow of the holy see."
The Pontiff greeted the students in
the most affable manner, and remarked
that they were a magnificent set of
young men. He said he was delighted
to see so many students from th*
United States, and then preached a lit
tle sermon on the great advantage
they had in becoming learned priests,
laying special emphasis on the cultiva
tion of the priestly virtues, "for," said
his Holiness, "a holy priest, even with
out saying a word, preaches by exam

of our faith."

convened to-day in regular session and
listened to the reading of the Presi

special session robbed the day of many
Interesting features incident to a new-
Congress. The House having organized
four weeks ago, the ceremony of open

develop the presence of a. quorum and
the customary notifications to the
President and to the Senate.
More than an hour and a half was
consumed in the reading of the Presi

which there was general applause on
the Republican side of the chamber. A
considerable amount of routine matters
necessary' to facilitate the work of com
mittees was transacted before the re
ception of the message.
A list of contests was announced to
the House by the clerk as follows:
California, Fourth District; Illinois.

HOUSE HEARS THE MESSAGE
The Email brother has a play this
week. The barn was busy, but "A
Royal Prisoner" was good-naturedly
put on at the Alcazar, with every one
to help, even to Frances Starr. Small
brother must have enjoyed it last night
almost as much as the rest of us did.
Sister'E hand also is seen in the love
scenes and she. too, must have had a
gorgeous time. I know I did. Brother
hasn't his name on the programme, so
I can't thank him for it. Sister neither.
But I'm grateful just the same, i .
You can't afford to miss "A Royal
Prisoner." Of course there isn't the
dear old burlap curtain in front, nor
the victorious perfume of coaloil.
Neither are there the lovely old keggly
seats, and Mr. Belasco won't take pins
at the door. Otherwise it's all there,
the drama of our barn days. Brother
has stacked it with Empresses and
things, and there are plots to burn.
The scene is, of course, laid In Russia,
and there is a lovely and lowly lieu
tenant with whom the Empress falls in
love. He manifests no disinclination,
but keeps his hand In before the
gxande passion by several trifling af
fairs. The first scene is laid in a St.
Petersburg prison, to which two pris
oners are brought, the lieutenant and
the great Duke Courland. Just for
ducks, as brother says, the lieutenant
takes the place of the Duke, doomed
to be hanged at sunrise for political
sins. He himself is in durance vile
for flirting. Those Russian prisons
are really very up-to-date sort of af
fairs. They keep lager or something of
the kindâ at least the jailer got tipsy
on itâ for the perennial refreshment
of the unfortunate prisoner. However,
the lieutenant persuades the Jailer to
get drunk, and the Duke escapes. The
Lord and brother only know why the
lieutenant doesn't.
The second scene finds the false
Duke in the guardroom that brother.
has made into a family reception par
lor. Here the Empress, young and
lovely, enters disguised as a spy. It
seems she has leanings toward the
Duke. This doesn't seem to make much
difference, however, for her affections
are Immediately enslaved by his sub
stitute. It is positively thrilfing where,
with "I will put him now to the final
test:' the Empress declares herself a
epy and offers to kill the Empress In
order to place Courland upon the
throne. The lieutenant nobly refuses,
with both eyes to heaven, and she Im
mediately falls in love with him.
"Wouldn't you? But he determines
to choke the lady and calls In the
guards to help. Naturally the curtain
go*>s down on "I am the Empress!"
They are at the palace In the next
scene. Courland (the false) has the run
of the place, and the Empress comes in
looking like a jewelry store. She, asks
the Duke to demand what he will.
"Wisely the Duke demands the lieuten
ant's freedom. He gets it, and Is short
ly afterward discovered. I'm still won
dering if hÂ» gets the Empress, for I
didn't wait for the end. But brother,
and especially sister, couldn't be so
cruel as to deprive them of each other.
They were very good to brother at
the Alcazar last night. Adele Block
played the Empress bo heartily that
her crown tipped over her left ear;
James Durkln slapped himself convinc
ingly as the lieutenant; John B. Maher
might almost have belonged to grown
up drama as the Count Ivan Schou
naloff, and Miss Frances Starr was su
par and spice as Theodora Vanka.
George Osbourne was the drunken ma
jor, and Mr. Belasco furnished the
handsomest of trimmings. I wouldn't
have missed It for anything. Nor
should you.

The Senate first took up the resolu
tion calling on the Postmaster General
to send to the Senate Committee on
Postofflces and Postroads the papers
bearing on the recent investigation
into Irregularities In the Postofflce De

Gorman suggested a number of
amendments, the effect of which was
to make it mandatory upon the com
mittee to make an investigation into
Postofflce affairs and to compel the
committee to make a report to the
Senate by May 1 next.
Penrose, as author of the resolution
and chairman of the committee, indi
cated a willingness to accept the
amendments, but Platt (Conn.) ob
jected. After some informal discus

to-morrow.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â The Senate
to-day closed the extraordinary session
and entered on the duties of the regu

natural as to be scarcelv noticeable.
The unusual features were the close
of the called session by the announce
ment from the chair and the offering
of two prayers within a half hour of
each other. The business transacted
consisted of the reading of the Presi
dent's message and the beginning of
the discussion on the Cuban reciprocity
bill. Cullom, who has charge of the
Cuban bill, made a speech advocating
its passage, In the Interest of American
trade.
Charles J. Carlson has an excellent
study of an "Old Man," which will at
tract great attention. John R. Dick
ersoh has four studies of Chinese life
that are full of life and color. L. May
nard DIckson has some wonderful pas
tels from the southwest that are more
than worthy of further men! ion. He
has found the desert moonlight and
fixed it for all ages. Harry Stuart
Fonda has four meritorious offerings
that will attract attention. John M.
Gamble has showed three canvasses of
Among the paintings the choice was
difficult. Charles Rollo Peters has five
of his wonderful moonlight scenes on
exhibition. From two of them espe
cially, "Finch House" and "Casa La
guna," are kept out the hair pulling
histrionics of art and they are master
pieces. The others verge on the melo
dramatic and lose their art through an
excess of art. C. D. Robinson had two
marines representing surf, but neither
of them were surfy, and only the light
in the foreground saved them from be
ing mediocre. More attention to com
position, added to the color the artist
has already, will place him in the front
rank.
J. Frank McComas has a notable col
lection of water colors, principally of
Monterey cypresses, which pall the
spirit of the viewer in the subtillty of
their rendering. They are Japanesque
in their truth and universal in their
meaning. Their boughs echo the sound
of hopeless wave beats on a sorrowful,
rock-bound coast. Arthur F. Mathews
has an exquisite bit in light and shade
entitled "The Mirror." He has three
other striking pictures on the same
lines as McComas' productions.
Orrin Peck has exhibited three port
raits, the best of whichâ and that
means something excellentâ Is of Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst. It is peculiarly life
like and full of delicious detail, ranking
him as an artist of unexpected merit.
SOME STRONG OFFERINGS.
DIFFICULT OF CHOICE.
In addition to these Mr. Altken has
a wonderful figure entitled "Clutch of
Destiny," representing two massive
hands dragging down the struggling
body of a man. It is a striking Idea
both In conception and execution and
when produced beyond a sketch will
be bound to attract attention. Three
busts of his will attract serious atten
tion. M. Earl Cummings has three busts.
A. Putnam offered an excellent collec
tion of his wonderful animal produc
tions in plaster.
Under advice from fellow members of
the club, the versatile sculptor has
made a new design. He thought that
his previous effort might seem too fu
nereal, so he "designed a scene from
the "Luck of Roaring Camp," where
Old Kentuck dies with the baby in his
arms. The situation is not nearly so
universal or compelling as his original
work, though It is life size and decid
edly impressive. Unfortunately, it was
done hurriedly and the figure of Old
Kentuck is out of proportion. The same
claim cannot be made against ! "Ten
nessee's Pardner," which is fashioned
perfectly to life.
Against Mr. Aitken are two sketches
for a Bret Harte monument, offered
by M. Earl Cummings, typifying
a scene from the "Luck of Roaring
Camp," when "he Â¦wrastled with me
thumb." Both are sketches and are
weaker artistically than either of Mr.
Aitken's offerings.
A. Putnam has two offerings for the
Harte monument, which lack original
ity or strength, but are full of composi
tion. They both show the figure of the
author against cold stone and beyond
the pose and execution suggest noth
ing. His sculpturing is purely subjec
tive .without the least inkling of ro
mance to It.
All the knowing ones- at the Bohe
mian Club are positive that never be
fore the seventh annual exhibition of
the Painters' and Sculptors' Club,
which will open for public view from
to-day until December 23, inclusive, has
such a meritorious showing been made
in the annals of the swell organization.
Members of the club only were pres
ent at the private opening of the ex
hibition yesterday. The spread is made
in the jinksroom. The real Interest
of the exhibition rests mostly in the
award the governors of the club shall
make for the proposed Bret Harte mon
ument to be erected in some public
place In this city.
Three contestants are entered for the
race. One of them is Robert I. Altken.
who originally designed a sketch rep
resenting "Tennessee's Pardner" weep
ing over the grave of his late associate.
It was beautifully smybollc of the Cali
fornia miner, whom Harte had made
historic in song and story. Aside from
the tale, it represented the miner of
'49, bewailing his harpist. Even the
most ill-read person, to whom had came
the joyous , tragic notes of Harte
through the medium of a Fifth School
fteader, would have recognized the
pose. It did not need' the story of
"Tennessee's Pardner" to complete the
tale. It was a statue of the California
miner thieving over Bret Harte.

ria. China, by treaty with us. has opened to
foreign commerce the cities of Mukden, the
capital of the province of Manchuria, and An
tung, an important port" on tha Yalu River,
on the road to Korea. The full measure of
development which our commerce may right
fully espect can hardly be looked for until
the settlement . of the present abnormal state
of things in the empire: but the foundation for
such development has at last been laid.
I ' call your attention to the reduced cost
in maintaining the consular service, for the fis
cal year ending June 30, 1903. as shown in
the rnnual report of the auditor for the State
and other departments, as compared with the
year previous. For the year under consider
ation the excess of experidltnresover receipts
on account of the consular service amounted
to $28,125 12. aa against $36,972 SO for the
year ending June Sr>. 19C2. and $147,040 18 for
the year ending June 30. 1901. This Is the
best showing in this respect for the consular
service for the past fourteen years, and the
reduction in the cost of the service to the Gov
ernment has been made In spite of the fact
that the expenditures for the year in Question
were more than $20,000 greater than for the
previous year.

Last year the Interparliamentary Union for
International Arbitration met at Vienna six
hundred members of the different legislature*
of civilized countries attending. It was pro
vided that the next meeting should be in -190-1
at St. Louis, subject to our Congress extending
an invitation. Like the Hague Tribunal this
Interparliamentary Union is one of the forces
tending toward peace among the nations of
the earth, and It Is entitled to our support
I trust the invitation can be extended.
I advocate this as a matter of humanity and
morals. It la anachronistic when private prop
erty Is respected on land that should not be
respected at. sea. Moreover, it should be borne
in mind that shipping- represents. Internation
ally speaking, a much more generalized spe
clen ot private property than Is the tase
with ordinary, property on land â that is,, prop
erty found at sea is much less apt than is the
case with property found on land really to
belong to any one nation. Under the modern
system of corporate- ownership the flag of a
vessel often differs from the flag which would
mark the nationality .of the real ownership
and money control of the vessel ; and the
cargo may belong- to Individuals of yet a dif
ferent nationality. Much American capital U
now invested . in foreign ships; and among
foreign nations it often happens that the cap
ital of one is largely Invested In the shipping
of another. Furthermore, as a practical mat
ter. It may be mentioned that while com
merce destroying may cause serious loss and
great annoyance, '- it can never be more than
a subsidiary factor in bringing to terms a res
olute foe. This is now well recognized by all
of our naval experts. The fighting ship not
the commerce destroyer, is the vessel whose
feat* add renown to a nation's history, and
establish her place among the great powers
of the world-
"The experiences of the last year bring for
cibly home to us a sense of the burdens and
the waste of war. We desire, in common with
most civilized nations, to reduce to the lowest
possible point the damage sustained In time of
war by oeaceable trade and commerce. It
is true we may suffer in such cases less than
other communities, but all nations are dam
aged more or less by the etate of uneasiness
and apprehecclon into which an outbreak ot
hostilities thiowa the entire commercial world.
It should be our object therefore to minimize
so far as practicable this Inevitable loes and
disturbance. This purpose can probably best
be accomplished by an international agree
ment to regard all private property at sea as
"exempt from capture or destruction by the
forces of belligerent powers. The United
States Government has for many years advo
cated this humane and beneficent principle
and is now In a position to recommend it to
other powers without the Imputation of selfish
motives. I therefore suggest for your consid
eration that the. executive be authorized to
correspond with tbe governments of the prin
cipal maritime powers with a view of incor
porating into the permanent law of civilized
nations principle of the exemptgn of all
private -property at sea hot contraband of war
from capture . or. destruction by belligerent
powers," ' ' : .'
. I cordially renew, this recommendation. : ..
The Supreme Court, . speaking on December
11, 1S99, through Justice Peckham. said: -
"It is, we think, historically accurate to say
that thin Government has always been in its
views among the most advanced of the govern
ments of the world in favor of mitigating, as
to all non-combatants, the hardships and hor
rors of war. To accomplish that object it has
always advocated those rules which would In
most cases do away with the right to capture
the private property of an enemy on the high
seas." -. . ;,-Â¦
Further steps should be taken. In President
McKinley's annual message ot December 6,
1808, . be - made the following recommenda
tion:
There seems good ground for the belief that
there has been a real growth among , the civ
ilized nations of a sentiment which will per
mit a gradual substitution' cf other methods
than the method of war in the settlement of
disputes. It Is not pretended that as yet we
are near a position in which it will be possi
ble wholly to prevent war, or that a Just re
gard for national Interest and honor will . in
all cases permit of the settlement of interna
tional disputes by arbitration; but by a mix
ture of prudence and firmness with wisdom
we think it is possible to do away with much
of the provocr tlon and excuse for war. and at
least in many cases to substitute some other
and more rational method for the settlement of
disputes., The Hague court offers mo good an
example of what can be dona in the direction
of such" settlement that It should be encour
aged in every way.

In enacting the laws above enumerated the
Congress proceeded on sane and conservative
lines. Nothing revolutionary was attempted;
but a common-sense and successful effort
made in the direction of eeeing that corpo
rations are so handled as to eubserve the
public good. The legislation was moderate.
It was characterized throughout by the idea
that we were not Attacking corporations, but
endeavoring to provide for doing . away with

Commerce between the nations is steadily
growing in volume, and the tendency of the
tiroes is toward closer trade relations. Con
stant watchfulness is needed to secure to
Americans the chance to participate to the best
advantage In foreign trade; and we may confi
dently expect that the new department will
Justify tbe expectation of its creators by the
exercise of this watchfulness, as well aa by
the buslness-Mke administration of euch laws

During the last session of the Congress, at
the suggestion of a Joint note from the repub
lic of Mexico and the imperial Government of
China, and In harmony with an act of thÂ»
Congress appropriating 125,000 to pay the ex
penses thereof, a commission was appointed to
confer with the principal European countries
in the hope that some plan might be devised
whfreby a fixed rate of exchange could be as
sured between the gold standard countries and
the silver standard countries. This commis
sion has filed its preliminary report, which has
been made public. I deem It Important that
the commission be continued and that. & sum
of money be appropriated sufficient to pay. the
expenses of its further labors.
A majority of our people desire that steps
be taken in the interests of American . ship
ping, so that we may once more resume our
former position in the ocean carrying trade.
But hitherto the differences of- opinion as to
the proper method of reaching this end have
been so wide that It has proved Impossible to
secure the 'adoption of any particular scheme.
Having in view these facts, I recommend that
the Congress direct the Sacretary of the Navy,
the "Poetraaster General and the Secretary of
Commerce and Labor, associated with such ft
representation from the Senate and House of
Representatives as the Congress in its wis
dom may designate, to serve as a commission
for the purpose cf Investigating and reporting
to the Congress at Its next session what legis
lation Is desirable or necessary for the devel
opment of the American merchant marine and
American commerce, and Incidentally of a na
tional ocean mail service of adequate auxiliary
naval cruisers and. naval reserves. â¢-.:."
From all sources, exclusive of the postal ser
vice, the receipts of the Government for the
last fiscal year aggregated $560,396,674. The
expenditures for the same period were $500,
<â¢'.*:'.<>('". the surplus for the fiscal year being
$54.2Â»7.6 > J7. The indications are that the sur
plus for the present fiscal year will be very
small, if Indeed there be any surplus. From
July to November the receipts from customs
were, approximately, nine million dollars less
than the receipts from the same source for a
corresponding portion of last year. Should this
decrease continue at the same ratio through
out the fiscal year, tbe surplus would be re
duced by, approximately, thirty millions dol
lars. Should the revenue from customs euf
fer much further decrease during the fiscal
year, the* surplus would vanish.' A large sur
plus is certainly undesirable. Two years ago
the war taxes were taken off with the express
intention of equalizing the governmental re
ceipts and expenditures, and though the first
year thereafter still showed a surplus. It now
seems likely that a substantial equality of rev
enue and expenditure will be attained.
Such being tbe case It is of great moment
both to exercise care and economy in appro
priations, and to scan sharply any change In
our fiscal revenue system which may reduce
our Income. The need of strict economy in
our expenditures is emphasized by the fact that
we cannot afford to be parsimonious In pro
vidii.g for what Is essential to our national
well-being. .Careful economy wherever possi
ble will alone prevent our Income from falling
below the point required in order to meet our
genuine needs. Â¦
The integrity of our currency is beyond
question, end under present conditions it
would bÂ» unwise and unnecessary to attempt
a reconstruction of our entire monetary sys
tem. The rame liberty should be granted the
Secretary of the Treasury to deposit customs
receipts as Is granted him In the deposit, of
receipts from other sources. In my message
of December 2, 1902, I called attention to cer
tain seed* of the financial situation, and I
again aek the consideration of tbe Congress
for these questions. â¢

In 1S78 questions ofirevemie administration on

a provisional demarcation, crossing the channel
between two high peaks on either side about
twenty-four miles ahpve the river mouth. In
1809 similar, questions growing out of: tha
extraordinary development ' of mining interests
in the region about the head of Lynn canal
brought about a' temporary, modus Vivendi, . by

Russia and later by the United â¢ States, "of a
strip of territory along the continental main
land from the western shore of Portland canal
to Mount St. Ellas, following and surrounding
the Indentations of the coast and Including the
Islands to the westward. Its description of the
landward -margin of the strip was indefinite,
resting on the supposed existence of a continu

There can be no crime more serious than
bribery. Other offenses violate one law, while
corruption strikes at the foundation of all law.
Under our torm of government all authority is
vested In the people and by them delegated to
those who represent them in official capacity.
There can be no offense "heavier than that of
him In whom such a sacred trust has been re
posed who sells It for his own and enrich
ment; and no less heavy is the offense of the
bribe-giver. He is worse than the thief, for
the thief robs the Individual, wnlle the corrupt
official plunders an entire city or State. He
is as wicked as the murderer, -for the murderer
may only take one life against the law, while
the. , corrupt official and the man who
corrupts the official alike aim at the
assassination of the cpmmonwealth it
self. Government ' of the people, by
the people, for the people will perish from the
face of the earth If bribery is tolerated. The
givers and takers of bribes stand on an evil
pre-eminence of Infamy. The exposure and
punishment of public corruption is an honor
to a nation, not a disgrace. The shame lies
In toleration, not In corruption. ! No city of
State, still less the nation, can be injured by
tho enforcement of law. As long as public
plunderers â¢ when detected can- find a haven of
fef uge in any foreign land and avoid punish
ment. Just so long encouragement ia given them
to ' continue their practices. - If we fail to do
all that in us lies to stamp out corruption we
cannot escape our share of responsibility for
the guilt. The first requisite of successful self
government is unflinching enforcement of the
law and the cutting out of corruption. '
Bribery Strikes
Law's Foundation
Exposure and Punishment
of Public Corruption Is an
Honor to Nation, and Not
a Disgrace, Says President
The Federal Grand Jury lately In session in
New York City dealt with this subject and
made a presentment which states the situation
briefly and forcibly and contains important sug
geetions for the consideration of the Congress.
This presentment Is included as an appendix to
the report of the Attorney General.
Â¦ The methods by which these frauds â now un
der full investigation with a view to meting out
punishment and providing adequate' remedies â
are perpetrated include many variations of pro
cedure by which false certificates of citizenship
are forged in their entirety; or genuine certifi
cates fraudulently â¢ or colluslvely . obtained in
blank are filled in by the criminal conspirators;
or certificates are obtained on fraudulent state
ments as to the time of arrival and residence in
this country; or imposition and substitution cf
another party for the real petitioner occur in
court; or certificates are made the subject of
barter and sale and transferred from the right
ful holder to those not entitled to them; or cer
tificates are forged by erasure of the original
names and the insertion of the names of other
persons not entitled to the tame.
It Is not necessary for me to refer here at
large to the causes leading to this state of af
fairs. The desire for naturalization la heartily
to be Commended where it springs from a sin
cere and permanent intention to become citizens
and a real appreciation of the privilege. But It
is a source of untold evil and trouble where it
is traceable to selfish and dishonest motives,
such as the effort by artificial and improper
means. In wholesale fashion to create voters
who are ready-made tools of corrupt politicians,
or the desire to evade certain labor laws cre
ating discriminations against alien labor. All
good citizens, whether naturalized or native
born, are equally interested in protecting our
citizenship against fraud in any form, and, on
the other hand, in affording every facility for
naturalization to those who In good faith desire
to 6bare alike our privileges and our responsi
bilities.
The special investigation of the subject of
naturalization under the direction of the At
torney General and the consequent prosecu
tions reveal a condition of affairs calling for
the immediate attention of the Congress. For
geries and perjuries of shameless and flagrant
character have- been perpetrated, not only in
the dense centers of population, but through
out the country, and it is established beyond
doubt that very many so-called citizens of the
United States have no title whatever to that
right and are asserting and enjoying the ben
efits of the came through the grossest frauds.
It is never to be forgotten that citizenship is,
to quote the words recently ' used by the Su
preme Court of the United Statesman "inesti
mable heritage," whether it proceeds from
birth within the country or is obtained by
naturalization; and we poison the sources of
our national character and strength at the
fountain, > If the privilege is claimed and exer
cised without right and by means of fraud and
corruption. The body politic cannot be sound
and healthy if many of its constituent mem
bers claim their standing through the prosti
tution of the high right and calling of citizen
ship. It should mean something to become a
citizen of the United States, and in the process
no loophole whatever should be left open to
fraud.
We cannot have too much immigration, of
the* right kind, and we should have # none at all
of the wrong kind. The need la to devise some
system by which undesirable- immigrants shall
be kept out entirely, while desirable immi
grants are prooerly distributed- throughout
the country. At present some districts which
need immigrants have none, and in others,
where the population is already congealed, im
migrants come in such numbers as to depress
the conditions of life for those already. there.
During the last . two â¢ years the i immigration
service at New York has been greatly Improved
and the corruption and Inefficiency which for
merly obtained there have been eradicated.
This service has Just been investigated by a
committee of New York - citizens of high
standing, MeÂ«t>rs. Arthur von Briesen, Lee K.
Frankel, Eugene A. Phllbln, Thomas W.
Hynes and Ralph Trautman. Their report
deals with the whole situation at length and
concludes~with certain recommendations for
administrative and legislative action. It is
now â¢, receiving the attention of the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor.
The establishment of the Department of
Commerce end Labor, 'with the Bureau of Cor
porations' thereunder, marks a real advance
in the direction of doing all that is possible
lor the solution of the questions vitally affect
ing capitalists and wage worker*. The act
creating the fienartmont was approved on
February 1*, JMrt. and two days later the head
of the department was nominated and con
firmed by the Senate. Since then the work of
organization has been put-hod as rapidly as
the initial appropriations permitted, and with
due regard to thoroughness and the broad pur
]*>*Â« which the department Is designed to
serve. After the tianffer of the various bu
reaus and branches to the department at the
beginning of the current fiscal year, as pro

country at l&rge. The scoi>e of tha depart
ment's duly and authority embraces the com
mercial and industrial interests of the nation.
It i* not designed to restrict or control the
lullest liberty of legitimate business action,
but to pwure exact and authentic information
which will aid the executive in enforcing ex
isting laws and which will enable the Con
press to Â«:nact additional legislation, if ! any
should be found necessary, in order to pre\-ent
the few from obtaining privileges at the ex
pense of diminished opportunities for the many.
The preliminary work of the Bureau of Cor
porations in the department has shown the
v-ireom of its creation. Publicity In corporate
affair* will tend to do away with Ignorance
end will afford facts upon which intelligent
action may be tak<>n. PyMTnatic, Intelligent
investigation is already developing facts the
knowledge of which is essential to a right
understanding of the need* ur.i duties of the
business world. The corjxtration which is
honestly and fairly organized, whose man
agers In the conduct of Its buslneM recognize
their obligation to deal squarely with their
Ftoekholder*. thÂ«-lr corejÂ»otltors and the public
has nothing to fear from euch supervision. The
purpose of this bureau Is not' to embarrass or
assail legit 1 Ante business, but to aid in bring
ing about a better Industrial condition â a con
dition under which there shall be obedience to
law and recognition of public obligation by all
corporations, great or small.
The Department of Commerce and Labor will
be not only the clearing-house for information
regarding the business transactions of the na
tion, but the executive arm of the Government
to aid in strengthening our domestic and for
eign markets. In perfecting our transportation
facilities, in building- up our merchant marine.

vided for the expediting of suits for the en

It will be remembered that during the second
session of the last Congress Great Britain, Ger
many and Italy formed an alliance for the pur
pose of blockading- the ports of Venezuela and
using such other means of pressure as would K.
cure a settlement of claims due. as they alleged,
to certain of their subjects. Their employment
of force for the collection of these claims was
terminated by an agreement brought about
through the offices .of the diplomatic represent
atives of the United States at Caracas and the
Government at Washington, thereby ending a
situation which was bound to cause Increasing
friction, and which jeoparded the peace of the
conl Inent. Under this agreement Venezuela
agreed to set apart a certain percentage of the
customs receipts of two of her ports to be ap
plied to the payment of whatever obligations
might be ascertained by mixed commissions ap
pointed for that purpose to be . due from her,
not only to the three powers already mentioned,
whose proceedings! against her had resulted in a
state .of war, but also to the United States,
France. Spain. Belgium,, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Norway, and Mexico, who had not
employed force for the collection of the claims
alleged to be due to certain of its citizens.'
A demand was then made by the so-called
blockading powers that the sums ascertained to
be due to their citizens by such mixed com
missions should be accorded payment in full be
fore anything'waa paid upon the claims of any
of the so-called peace powers. Venezuela, on
the other hand. Insisted that all her creditors
should be paid. upon a basis of exact equality.
During the efforts to 'adjust this dispute It
was suggested by the powers In interest that
It should be referred to me for decision, but 1
was clearly of the opinion that a far wiser
course would 'be to submit the question to the
Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.
It seemed to me to offer an admirable oppor
tunity to advance the practice of the peaceful
settlement of. disputes between nations and to
secure for The Hague tribunal a memorable in
crease of its practical importance. â¢ The na
tions Interested in the controversy were so nu
merous and In many Instances so powerful as
tomake?lt evident that' beneficent results
would follow from their 'appearance at the
same time before the, bar 'of that aucust tri
bunal of peace.. ' .
The result Is satisfactory in every way. It is
of great material advantage to our people In
the Far Northwest. It has removed from the
field of discussion and possible danger a ques
tion liable to become more acutely accentuated
with each passing year. Finally, it has fur
nished a signal proof of the fairness and good
will with which two friendly nations can ap
proach and determine issues involving national
sovereignty and by their nature Incapable of
submission to a third power for adjudication.
The award is self-executing on the vital
points. To make It ( effective aa regards the
others It only remains for the two governments
to appoint, each on its own behalf, one or more
scientific experts, who shall, with all conven
ient speed, proceed together to lay down the
boundary line in accordance with the decision
of the majority of the tribunal. I recommend
that the Congress make adequate provision for
the appointment, compensation and expenses of
the members to serve on this joint boundary
commission on the part of the United States.
This tribunal met in London on September^,
under the presidency of Lord Alverstone. The
proceedings were expeditious, and marked by a
friendly and conscientious spirit. The respect
ive casts, counter cases and arguments present
ed the issues clearly and fully. On the 20th of
October a majority of the tribunal reached and
signed an agreement on all the questions sub
mitted by the terms of the convention. By this
award the right of the United States to the con
trol of a continuous strip or border of* the main
land shore, skirting all the tied water Inlets
and sinuosities of the coast, is confirmed; the
entrance to Portland canal (concerning which

Trans- Atlantic mail line was equal to any for
eign line. Since then the Germans have put
on 23-knot steamers and the British have con
tracted for 24-knot steamers. Our service
should equal the best. If it does not the- com
mercial public will abandon it. If we are to
stay in the business it ought to be with a full
understanding of the advantages to the coun

knowledge of the cost and proper methods of

are of even more importance than fast mail
lines, save so far as the latter can be de

We have cause ae a nation to be thankful

harm to the honest corporation. The only cor
poration that has cause to dread It Is the cor
poration which shrinks from the light, and
about the welfare of such corporations we
need not be Oversensitive. The work of the
Department of Commerce and Labor has been
conditioned upon this theory, of securing fair
treatment alike for labor and for capital.
The consistent policy of the National Govern
ment, to far Â¦ as it has the power, is to
hold in check the unscrupulous man, whether
employer or employe; but to refuse to weaken
Individual initiative, or to hamper or cramp
the industrial development of the country- We
recognize that this la an era of federation
and combination, in which great capitalistic
corporations and labor unions have become
factors of tremendous Importance in all lndu*
trial centers. Hearty recognition is given the
far-reaching, beneficent work which has been
accomplished through both corporations and
unions, and the line as between different cor
porations, as between different unions, is drawn
as it is between different individuals; that is,
It Is drawn on conduct, the effort being to treat
both organized capital and organized labor
alike; asking nothing save that the Interest of
each shall be brought into harmony with the
Interest of the general public, and that the
conduct of each shall conform to the' funda
mental rules of obedience to law. of Individ
ual freedom, and of Justice and fair dealing
toward all. Whenever either corporation, la
bor union, or Individual disregards the law
or acts In a spirit of arbitrary any tyrannous
interference with the rights of others, whether
corporations or individuals, then where the
Federal Government has Jurisdiction it will
see to it that the misconduct is stopped, pay
ing not the slightest heed to the position or
power of the corporation, the union or the
individual, but only t<* one vital fact â that is,
the question whether or not the conduct of the
Individual or aggregate of Individuals is in ac
cordance with the law of the land. Every
man must be guaranteed his liberty and hie
right' to do as he likes with his property or
his labor, so long as he does not infringe the
rights of others. No man Is above the law
and no man is below it ; nor do we ask any
man's permission when we require him to
obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as
a right; not asked as a favor.
Steps have been taken by the State Depart
ment looking to the making of bribery an ex
traditable offense with foreign iioweu. The
need of more efTectlve treaties covering this
crime is manifest. The exposures nnrt prosecu

and other dltles and State* have resulted in a
number of elvers and takers o? bribes 'Ix-cuming

der the direction of the Attorney General, and
until used, for the due enforcement of the laws
of the United States In general and especially of
the civil and criminal laws relating to public
lands and the laws, relating to postal crimes
and offenses and the subject of naturalization.
Recent Investigations have shown a deplorable
state of affairs in these three matters of vital
concern. By various frauds and by forgeries
and perjuries, thousands of acres of the public
domain, embracing lands cf different character
and extending through various sections of the
country, have been dishonestly acquired.
It Is hardly necessary to urge the Importance
of recovering these dishonest acquisitions, stolen
from the people, and of promptly and duly pun
ishing the offenders. I epeak In another part
of this message of the widespread crimes by
which the sacred right of citizenship is falsely
asserted and that "inestimable heritage" per

greatest effect the due penalties for such viola

rHE salient features of the President's message may be summarised as fol
lows: PanamaâPresident Roosevelt defends the course of the administra
tion in isthmian affairs and the recognition of the republic of Panama. Capital
and labor â Work of the Department of Commerce andLabor had been conditioned
upon the theory of securing fair treatment alike for labor and capital. Legislation
has been moderate and clxaracterizcd throughout by the idea of not attacking cor
porations, but endeavoring to do away with any evil in them. National finances â
Economy must be practiced, because expenditures for the current fiscal year are
exceeding receipts. Frauds â Attention is called to frauds, forgeries, perjurers
and briberies, and Congress is asked to provide money' for prosecution of all of -
FEATURES OF THE MESSAGE THAT WAS SENT TO CONGRESS
fenders. Navy â There should be no cessation in adding to the strength of the
navy, and a navy general staff should be established. ArmyâUntil^a better sys
tem of promotion is devised we cannot hope that our officers will be of as high
grade as we have aright to expect. Merchant marine â A commission should be
appointed to investigate and report to Congress legislation for the development of
the merchant marine. Public lands â Revision of the public land laws is recom
mended. Insular possessions â Steady progress of the Philippines and Porto Rico
has been amply assured. Private property at seaâ President McKinley's recom
mendation that European nations be invited tp.join zvith the United States in ex
empting such property from capture is renewed. . j
The signing of a new commercial treaty with
China,- which took place, at Shanghai on the
8th of " October, is a cause for satisfaction
This act,' the result of long discussion and. ne
gotiation, places our commercial relations with
the great Oriental empire on. a more satisfac
tory footing than. they have ever heretofore en-
Joyed. It provides not only for the ordinary
rights and privileges of diplomatic and con
sular ' officers, but also for an Important ex
tension of our commerce by Increased facility
of access to Chinese ports, and for the relief
of trade by the removal of eome of the ob
stacles which have embarrassed it in the past.
The . Chinese Government engages, on fair
and equitable conduits, which will probably
be- accepted by the principal commercial - na
ttons, to abandon the levy of "liken" and other
transit dues throughout the empire, and to In
troduce other desirable administrative reforms.
Larger facilities are to be -given to our â¢citi
zens whajieslre to carry on mining enterprises
in China. "We have , secured- for - our mission
aries -a valuable privilege, the recognition Â¦ of
their â¢ right to rent and lease In : â¢ perpetuity
such property as their religious ' societies may
need 'in all parts of the empire. And, "what
was an indispensable condition for the advance
and development of our commerce In Wanchu-
Early In July, having- received Intelligence,
which happily turned out to be erroneous of
the association of our Vice Consul at Beirut.
I dispatched a small squadron to that port
for such service as might be found necessary
on arrival. Although the attempt on the life
of our Vice Consul had not been successful
yet the outrage was symptomatic of a state
of excitement and disorder which demanded
immediate attention. - The arrival of the ves
sels had the happiest result. A feeling of se
curity at once took the place of the former
alarm . and . disquiet; our .officers mere cor
dially, welcomed by the consular body and
the leading merchants, and ordinary business
resumed Its activity. The Government of tha
Sultan gave a considerate hearing to the rep
resentations of our Minister; the official who
was regarded as responsible for the disturbed
condition of affairs was removed. â¢ Our rela
tions with the Turkish Government remain
friendly; our claims founded on inequitable
treatment of eome of our schools and missions
appear to be In process of amicable adjust
ment. .:. â¢ Â¦ â¢ .
The rural freÂ« delivery ferric* has been
i steadily extended. The - attention ef the Con
gress Is axked to the question of the compensa
1 t!on of the letter carriers and clerks engaged In
the postal service, especially on the new rural
free delivery routes. More routes have been In
stalled since the 1st of July last than in any
like period In the department's history. While
a due regard to economy must be kept In mind
In the establishment of new routes, yet the ex
tension of the rural free delivery system must
be continued, for reasons of sound public policy.
Nq governmental movement of recent years has
resulted In greater Immediate benefit to the
people of the country districts. Rural free de
livery, taken in connection with the telephone,
tho bicycle and the trolley, accomplishes much
toward lessening the isolation of farm life and
making It brighter and more attractive. In the
Immediate past the lack of Just such facilities
as these has driven many of the more active
and restless young men and women from the
farms to the cities; for they rebelled at loneli
ness and lack of mental companionship. It Is
unhealthy and undesirable for the cities to
grow at the expense of the country; and rural
free delivery is not only a good thing In Itself.
but Is good because It la one of the cause*
which check this unwholesome tendency toward
the urban concentration of our population at
the expense of the country districts. It Is for'
the same reason that we sympathize with and
aprrove of the policy of build In a: good roads.
Tho movement for good roads la one fraught
with the greatest benefit to the country dis
tricts.
I trust that the Congress will continue to fa-
Tor !n all proper ways the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. This exposition commemorates the
Louisiana purchase, which was the first great
step In the expansion > which made us a conti
nental nation. The expedition of Lewis and
Clark across the continent followed thereon and
marked the beginning of the process of explora
tion and colonization which thrust our national
boundaries to the Pacific. The acquisition of
the Ore*^>n country. Including the present States
of Oregon and Washington, was a fact of im
mense importantÂ© In cur history; first giving us
cur place on the Pacific seaboard and making
ready the way for our ascendency In the com

tennial of our establishment upon the Western
coast by the expedition of Lewis and Clark Is to
be celebrated at Portland. Oregon, by an expo

should receive recognition and support from the
national Government.
I call your special attention to the Territory
of Alaska,. The country Is developing rapidly
and it has an assured future. The mineral
wealth is great and has as yet hardly been
tapped. The fisheries. If wisely handled and
kept under national control, wilt be a business
as permanent as any other, and of the utmost
Importance to the people. The forests If prop
erly guarded will fona another great source of
wealth. -Portions of Alaska are fitted for fann
ing and stock raising, although the methods
must be adapted to the peculiar conditions of
the country. Alaska is situated fn the far
north; but so are Norway and Sweden and Fin
land; and Alaska can prosper and play Its part
In the new world Just as those nations have
prospered and played their parts in : the old
world: Proper land laws should be enacted;
and the survey of the public lands Immediately
begun. Coal land laws should bÂ« provided
whereby the ccal land entryman may make his

mineral entrymen. Salmon hatcheries, exclu
sively under Government control, should be es
tablished. The cable should be extended from
Sltka westward. Wagon roads ' and " traits
should be built, and the building of railroads
promoted In all legitimate ways. Lighthouses
should be built along the coast. Attention
should be paid to the needs of the Alaska In

I heartily congratulate the Congress upon the
steady Â¦ progress In' building up the â¢ American

Meanwhile the Navy Department' and the offl-
The effect of tbe laws providing a general
staff for the army and for the more effective
use of the National Guard has been excellent.
Great improvement has been made in the effi
ciency of our army In recenr> years. Such
schools as those erected at Fort Leavenworth
and Fort Riley and the institution of fall ma
neuver work accomplish satisfactory results.
The stood effect of these maneuvers upon the
National Guard Is marked, and ample appro
priation should be made to enable the guards
men of the several States to share In the
benefit. The Govenin.-tr.t should as soon a*
possible secure suitable permanent camo i.tes
fcr military maneuvers in ths various se<*tions
of the country. The service tnerÂ«*by rendered
no* only -to tha rerular army, but to the Na
tional Guard of the several States, will be
bo great as to repay many times over the rela
tively small expense. We should not rest sat
isfied with what has been done, however. Tbe
only people who are coutented with a system
of promotion by mere seniority are those who
are contented with the triumph of mediocrity
over excellence. On the other hand, a system
which encouraged the exercise of social or po
litical favoritism In promotions would be even
worse. But it would surely* be easy to devise
a method of promotion from grade to grade In
which the opinion of the higher officers of the
Mrvic* upon the candidates ehould be decisive
upon the standing and promotion of the latter.
Just such a system now obtains at West Point.
The quality of each year's work determines the
standing of that year's class, the man being
dropped or graduated Into the next class in the
relative position which his military superiors
decide to be warranted by his merit-
In -ether words, ability, energy, fidelity and
all other similar qualities determine the rank
of a man* year after year In West Point, and
his standing in the army when he graduates
from West Point: but from that time on all
effort to find which roan la best or worst, and
reward or punish him accordingly. Is aban
doned: no brilliancy, no amount of hard work,
no eagerness In the performance of duty, can
advance him. and no slackness or indifference
that falls short of a court-martial offense can
retard him. .Until this system is changed we
cannot hope that our officers will be of as high
grade as we have a right to expect, considering
the material upon which we draw. >Moreover,
when a man renders such service as Captain
Pershing rendered last spring in the Moro
campaign It ought to be possible to "reward
him without at once Jumping him to the grade
of brigadier general.
Shortly after the enunciation of that famous
principle of American foreign policy now known
as the "Monroe Doctrine." President Monroe,
in a special message to Congress on January 30.
1S24. spoke as follows: "The navy is the arm
from which our Government will always derive
most aid in support of our â¢ â¢ , " ; rights.
Every power, engaged in war will' know the
strength of our naval power, the number of our

Seven years later. In 1S65, Mr. Seward; In
different communications took the following
position: Â¦.-â¢Â¦.. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦"..'Â¦.Â¦Â¦
"The progress of e\*ents has rendered the
intcroceanic route across the narrow 'portion
of Central America vastly important to the
commercial world and especially to the United
States, whose - possessions extend along the
Atlantic and . Pacific coasts, and demand the
speediest and easiest modes of communication
While the rights of sovereignty of the states
occupying this region should always be re
spected we shall expect that thÂ«se rights be
exercised ; in a spirit befitting the occasion
and the wants and circumstances that have
arisen.. Sovereignty has its duties as well as
Its rights, and none of these local govern
ments, even if administered with mere regard
to the Just demands of other nations than they
have been, would be permitted. In a spirit of
Eastern isolation, to- close the gates of inter
course on the great highways of. the world
and .. Justify the act by the pretension that
these avenues - of trade and travel belong to
them and that they choose to shut them, or,
what Is almost equivalent, to encumber them
with such unjust relations as would prevent
their general use." i. .
A new republic, that of Panama, which was
at one time a severelsm state, and at another
time a mere department of the successive con
federations known as New Granada, and Co
lombia, has now succeeded to the rights which
first one and then the other formerly exer
cised over the isthmus. But 'as long as the
isthmus endures the mere geographical fact of
Its existence- and the peculiar interest therein
which Is required _ by our position Perpetuate
the solemn contract which binds the holders
of the territory to respect our right to free
dom of transit across It. and binds us In re
turn to . safeguard for the Isthmus and the
world the exercise of that inestimable privilege.
The true Interpretation of the obligations upon
which the United States entered in this treaty
of 1846 has been riven repeatedly In the ut
terances of Presidents and Secretaries of State
Secretary Cass in 1S5S officially stated the
position ot this Government as follows:
When the Congress directed that we should
take the Panama route under treaty with Co-
Icmbia the esicnce of the condition, of course
f e filT 5 ... 1101 to tn t Government which con
trolled that route, but to the route ItÂ«elf- to
the territory across which the route lay, not to
tly> name which for the moment the territory
bore on the map. The purpose of the law was
to authorize the President to make a treaty
with the powt-r in actual control of the Isthmus
of Panama. This purpose has been fulfilled
In the year 1846 this Government entered
into a treaty with New Granada, the pre
decessor upon the Isthmus of the republic of
Colombia and of the present republic of Pan
ama, by which treaty it was provided that
the Government and citizens of the United
States should always have free and open right
of way or transit across the isthmus of'Pan
ama by any modes of communication that
might be constructed, while in return our
Government guaranteed the perfect neutrality
of the above mentioned Isthmus with the view
that the free transit from the one to the
other eea might not be interrupted â¢ or em
barrassed. The treaty vested In the United
States a substantial property right carved out
of the rights of sovereignty and property which
New Granada then had and possessed over
the said territory. The name of New Granada
has passed away and its territory has been
di\1deÂ«i. â¢ Its successor, the Gov.-rnment of
Colombia, has ceased to own any property
in the isthmus.'
By the act of June 2S. 1902. the Congress au
thorised the President to enter Into treaty with
Colombia fcr the building of the canal across
the Isthmus of Panama; it being provided that
in the event of failure to secure such tr-aty
after the lapse of a reasonable time, recourse
should be had to building a canal through Nica
ragua. It has not been necessary to consider
this alternative, as I am enabled to lay before
the Senats a treaty providing for the building
of *he canal across the Isthmus. of Panama.
This was the route which commended itself to
the deliberate Judgment of the Congress and
we can now acquire by treaty the right to con
struct the canal over this route. The question
now, therefore, is not by which route the isth
mian canal shall be built, for that question has
been definitely and irrevocably decided The
question Is simply whether or not we shall have
an Isthmian canal.

In my last annual message the attention of
the Conrress was called to the necessity of
enlarging the safety-appliance law, and it is
rrstiiying to note that this law was amended
in important respects. With the increasing
railway mileage of the country, che greater
number of men employed and the use of
larger and heavier equipment the urgency for
renewed effort to prevent the losÂ« of life and
limb upon the railroads of the country, par
ticularly -to employee, is apparent. For the
Inspection of water craft and the Hfe-savlnr
service upon the water 'the Congress has built
up an elaborate body of protective legislation
and a thorough method of inspection and is
annually spending large sums of money. It
is encouraring to observe ' that the Congress
Is alive to the interests of tho;y who are
employed upon cur wonderful arteries of com
merce â the railroads â who. so e&fely transport

freight. The Federal Inspection of safety

making appropriations. Is a service analogous
to that wim-h the Government has upheld for
generations in regard to vescels, ami It is be
lieved will prove of great practical benefit,

Expert er.ee haa shown that in the Western
States themselves, es well as in the rest of the
country, there is widespread conviction that

preset needs. The character and uses of the
: â¢-..-.Â¦-r..:.K public lands differ widely from those
of the public lanfls which Congress had espe
cially in view when these laws were passed.
The rapidly Increasing rate of disposal of the
put/lie lands is not followed by a corresponding
ir. create in home building. There is a tendency
to mass in large holdings public lands, espe
cially timber and grazing lands, and thereby to
retard settlement. I renew and emphasize my

The Indian agents should not be dependent
fcr their appointment or tenure of office upon
onsiderations of partisan politics; the practice
of appointing, when possible, ex-army officers
or bonded superintendents to the vacancies
that occur is working well. Attention Is in

In granting patents to foreigners the proper
course for this country to follow is to give the
ean-.e advantages to foreigners here that the
countries In which these foreigners dwell ex
tend in return to cur citizens; that is, to ex
tend the benefits of our patent laws on Inven
tions and the like where in return the articles
would be patentable in the foreign countries
concerned â where an American would get a
corresponding patent fn such countries.
The cotton-growing States have recently
be-n Invadrd by a weevil that has done much
damage and threatens the entire cotton Indus
try. I suggest to the Congress the prompt en
actment of such remedial legislation as its
Judgment may approve.
The study of the opportunities of reclamation
of the vast extent of arid land shows that
whether this reclamation is done by individ
uals, corporations or the State, the sources
of water supply must be effectively protected
and the reservoirs guarded byÂ»the preservation
of the forests at the headwaters of the streams.
The engineers making the preliminary exami
nations continually emphasize this need and
urge that the remaining public lands at the
headwaters of the important streams of thÂ»
West be reserved to insure permanency of wa
ter supply for irrigation. Much progress in
forestry has been made during the past year.
The necessity for perpetuating our forest re
sources, whether in public or private hands. Is
recognized now as never before. The demand
for lorest reserves has become insistent in the
West, because the West must use the water,
wood and rummer range which only such re
serves can supply. Progressive lumbermen are
striving, through forestry, to give their busi
ness permanence. Other great business Inter
ests are awakening to the need of forest pres
ervation as a business matter. The Govern
ment's forest work should receive from the
Congress hearty support, and especially sup
port adequate for the protection of the forest
reserve* acainst fire. The forest-reserve policy
of the Government has passed beyond the ex
perimental staee and has reached a condition
where scientific methods are essential to Its
successful prosecution. The administrative
features of forest reserves are at present un
satisfactory, being divided between 'three bu
reaus of two departments. It is therefore rec
ommended that all matters pertaining to for
est reserve*, except thoee involving or pertain
ing to land titles, be consolidated In the Bu
reau of Forestry of the Department of Agri
culture.

discovery of this hemisphere, the canal across
the isthmus haa been planned. For two score
years it has been worked at. "When made It
Is to last for the ages. It is to alter the
geography of a continent and the trade route*
of the world,. We have shown by every treaty
we have negotiated or attempted to negotiate
with the peoples in contnrt of the Isthmus and
with foreign nations in reference thereto our
consistent stock! faith in observing our obliga
tions; on the one hand to the peoples of the
Isthmus, and on the other hand to the civilized
world whose commercial rights we are safe
guarding and guaranteeing by our action. We
have dene our duty to others in letter and in
spirit, and we have shown the utmost forbear
ance in exacting our own rights.
Last spring, under the act above referred
to. a treaty concluded between the representa
tives of the republic of Colombia and of our
Government was ratified by the Senate. This
treaty was entered into at the urgent solici
tation of the people of Colombia and after a
body of experts appointed by our Government
especially to go into the matter of the routes
across the Isthmus had pronounced unani
mously in favor of the Panama route. In
drawing up this treaty every concession was
made to the people and to the Government of
Colombia. We were more than Just in deal-
Ing with them. Our generosity was sucb. as
to make it a serious question whether we had
not gone too far In their interest at the ex
pense of our own; for In our scrupulous de
sire to pay all possible heed, not merely to
the real but even to the fancied rights of our
weaker neighbor, who already owed eo much
to our protection and forbearance, we yielded
in all possible ways to her desires In drawing
up the treaty. ' , *
Nevertheless the Government of Colombia
not merely repudiated the treaty, but repu
diated it tn euch manner as to make it evi
dent by the time the Colombian Congress ad
journed, that not the scantiest hope remained
of ever getting a satisfactory treaty from
them. The Government of Colombia made the
treaty and yet when the Colombian Congress
was called to ratify it the vote against rati
fication waa unanimous. It does not appear
that the Government made any real effort to
secure ratification. *'/-Â¦â¢
Immediately after the adjournment of the
Congress a revolution broke out in Panama.
The people of Panama had long been discon
tented with the republic of Colombia, and
1 they had been kept quiet only by the pros
> pect of the conclusion of the treaty, which
was to t>em a matter of vital concern, when
i it became evident that the treaty was hope
lessly lost the people of Panama rose llter
1 ally as one man. Not a shot was 'fired by a
single man on the isthmus in the Interest -of
the Colombian Government. Not a life was
lost in the accomplishment of the revolution.
Th*. Colombian troops stationed on the isth
mus who had long been unpaid, made common
cauÂ«e with the people of Panama, and with
astonishing unanimity the new republic waa
started The duty or the United States in
the premises was clear. In strict accordance
with the principles laid down by Secretaries
Ca-Â« and Seward in the official documents
above quoted the United States gave notice
that It would" permit the landing of no Â»xpedl
ttonary force, the arrival of which would mean
chaos and destruction along the line of the
railroad and of the proposed canal, and an<
Interruption of transit as an Inevitable con
sequence. The de facto Government of Pana
ma was recognized in the following telegram
to Mr. Ehrman : ,_ ' *~ Â»,
"The people of Panama have, by apparently
unanimous movement. .dissolved their political
connection with the republic of Colombia, and
resumed their Ind-pendence. When you are sat- |
lsfled that a de facto government, republican in
form and without substantial opposition from
Its own ptople. haÂ« been established in the
State ot Panama, you wjll enter into relations
with it as the responsible government of the
territory and look to it fcr all due action to
protect "the persons and property of citizens of
the United States and . to keep open the isth
mian transit. In accordance with the obliga
tions cf existing treaties governing the rela
tions of the Uriited States to that territory."
The Government of Colombia was notified of
our. action by the following telegram to Mr.
Beaupre : "Â¦

examinations are progressing throughout the
arid States and Territories, plans for reclaim-
Ing works being prepared and passed upon by
boards of engineers before approval by the
Secretary of the Interior. In Arizona and Ne
vada, in localities where such work is pre-em
inently needed, construction has already been
begun. In other parts of the arid West va
rious projects are â¢ well advanced toward the
drawing up of contracts, these being delayed
in part by necessities of reaching agreements
or understanding as regards rights of way or
acquisition of real estate. Meet of the works
contemplated for construction are of national
importance. involving interstate questions
or the securing of stable, self-supporting com
munities in the midst of vast tracts of vacant
land. The nation as a whole is, of course, the
gainÂ»r by the creation of these homes, adding
as they do to the wealth and stability of the
country, and furnishing a home market for the
products of the East and South. The reclama
tion law. whil? perhaps not ideal, appears at
present to answer the larger needs for which
it is designed. Further legislation is not rec
ommended until the necessities of change are
more apparent.

It Is eminently desirable, however, that there
should be provided a naval general staff on
linen similar to those of the general staff lately
created for the army. Within the Navy Depart
ment itself the needs of the service have
brought about a system under which the duties
of a general staff are partially performed; for
the bureau of navigation ha* under Its direc
tion the war college, ihe office of naval Intelli
gence and the board of Inspection, and has
been in close touch with the general board of
the navy. But though under the excellent of
ficers at their head, these beards and bureaus
do good work, they have not tlie authority of
a general staff, and have not sufficient scope to
insure a proper readiness for emergencies. We
need the establishment by law of a body of
trained officers, who shall exercise a systematic
control of the military affairs of the navy and
be authorized advisers of the^lecretary concern
ing it.
cersof thÂ«i navy are doing well their part by
providing constant service at sea under condi
tions aktn to those of actual warfare. Our of
ficers <>nd enlisted men are learning to handle
the battleships, cruisers and torpedo boats with
high efficiency in fleet and squadron forma
tions, and the standard o* marksmanship Is be
ing steadily raised. The best work ashore Is
Indispensable, but the highest duty of a naval
officer is to exercise command at sea.
The establishment of a naval base in the
Philippine* ought not to be longer postponed.
Such a base is desirable in time of peace; In
time of war it would be Indispensable, and Its
lack would be ruinous. Without it our fleet
would be helpless. Our naval experts are agreed
that Sublg Bay Is the proper place for the pur
pose. The national interests require- that the
work of fortification and development of a na
val station at Â£ublg Bay be begun at an early
date: for under the best conditions it is a work
which will consume much time.
' persons were appointed through competitive
examinations under the civil service rules.
This was J'i672 more than during the preced
ing year, and 40 per cent of those who passed
the examinations. This abnormal growth was
largely occasioned by the extension, of classifi
cation \o the rural free delivery service and
the appointment last year of over SJOOO rural
carriers. A revision of the civil service rules
took effect on April 15 last, which has greatly
Improved their operation. The completion of
the reform of the civil service is rccoenized
by good citizens e\'erywhere as a matter of
the highest public importance, ani the suc
cess of the merit system largely depends upon
the effectiveness of the "rules and the, ma
chinery provided for their enforcement. A
very gratifying spirit of friendly co-operation
exists in all the departments of the Govern
ment in the enforcement and unlicnn observ
ance of both the letter and spirit of the civil
service act. Kxeci'tive orders of July 3. 1902.;
March 2t>. 190:;. and July 8, 1303. require that
appointments of all unclassified lalx.rers. both
in the department? at "Washington and in the
field service, shall be made with the assistance
of the United States Civil Service Commission,
under a system of registration to test the
relative fitness of applicants for appointment
or employment. This system is competitive,
and is open to all citizens or tne United States
qualified in respect to age. physical ability,
moral character, industry, and adaptability for
manual labor: except that in case of veterans
of the Civil War the element of ajc* is omitted.
This system of appointment is dls-tinct from
the classified service and does not classify
positions of vmere laborer under the civil
service act and rules. Regulations in aid
thereor have been put In operation in several
of the departments and are being gradually
extended In other parts of the service. The
results have been very satisfactory, as ex
travagance has been checked by decreasing
the -number of unnecessary positions and by
Increasing the efficiency of the employes re
maining.
The Congress, as the result of a thorough
investigation of the charities and reformatory
institutions in the District of Columbia, by jÂ»
Joint select committee of the two houses,
which made its report in March. 1698. created
In the act approved June 6, 1000. a board of
rharitles for the District of Columbia, to con
sist of five residents of the district, appointed
by the President of the United States, by acd
with the advice and consent of the Senate,
each for a term of three years, to serve without
compensation. President McKinley appointed
five memwho hart been active and prominent In
the public charities of Washington, all of
whom upon taking office July 1, 1900. resigned
from the different charities with which -they
had been connected. The members of the board
have been reappofnted In successive years. Th*
board serves under the Commissioners of the
LMstriet of Columbia. The board gave its first
year to a careful and Impartial study of tho 'Â¦
special problems before it. and has continued ;
that study every year in the light of the best i
practice In public charities elsewhere. Its
recommendation* In Its annual reports to the
Congress through the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia "for the economical and
efficient administration of the charities and re
formatories of the District of Columbia," as
required by the act creating it, .have been
based upon the principles commended by the
Joint select committee of the Congress in its
report of March. 1S9S. and approved by the
best administrators of public charities, and
make for the desired systematization and Im
provement of the. affairs under its supervision.
They are worthy of favorable consideration by
the Congress. â¢ .^^
The control, tn the Interest of the commerce
and traffic of the whole civilized world, of the
means of undisturbed transit across the Isth
mus of Panama has become of transcendent
Importance to the United States. We have re
peatedly exercised thia control by Intervening
in the course of domestic dissension, and by
protecting the territory from foreign invasion.
In 1!Â«33 Mr. Everett assured the Permian Min
ister that we should not hesitate to maintain
the neutrality of the Isthmus in the case of
war between Peru and Colombia. In 1 vM Col
ombia, which has always been vigilant to avail
itself of its privileges conferred by the treaty,
expressed its expectations that in the event *>f
war between 'Peru and Spain the United Stated
would carry Into effect the guaranty of neu
trality. There have been few administrations
of the State Department In which this treaty
has not. either by the one side or the other,
been used as a basis of more or less impor
tant demands. It was said by Mr. Fish in 1S71
that the Department of State had reason to
believe that an attack upon Colombian sover
eignty on the isthmus had. en several occa
sions, teen averted by warning from this Gov
ernment. -â¢, -In 1888. when Colombia wa3 under
the menace of hostilities from Italy in the Cer
rutl case. Mr. Bayard expressed the serious
concern that the United States could not but
feel that a European power should resort to
force against * a ' sister republic of this hemis
phere, 'as to the sovereign and uninterrupted
use of a !>art of whose territory we are guar
antors under the' Mlemn faith of a treaty.
The above recital of facts establishes beyond
question: First, that the United states has
for over half a century patiently and In gon-J
faith carried oct its obligations unde- 'he
treaty of 1S46; second, that when for th* tint
time it became possible for Colombia to do
"Knowing that revolution has already com
menced in Panama [an eminent Colombian]
says that If thÂ« Government of the United
States will land troops to preserve Colombian
sovereignty, and the transit. If requested by
Colombian Charge d' Affaires, this Government
will, declare martial law; and. by virtue of
vested constitutional authority, when public or
der is disturbed, will approve by decree the
ratification of the- canal treaty a* signed; or.
If the Government of the - United States pre
fers, will call extra session of the Congress â
with new and friendly members â next May
to approve the treaty. [An eminent Colombian]
has the perfect confidence of Vice President,
he says, and if It became necessary will go
to the isthmus or send representative there to
adjust matters along above lines to the satis
faction of the people there."
This dispatch is noteworthy from two stand
points. Its oftTer of Immediately guaranteeing
the treaty to us Is In sharp contrast with the
positive and contemptuous refusal of the Con
gress which has just closed . Its sessions to
consider favorably such a treaty; it shows that
the Government which made the treaty really
had absolute control over the situation. But
did not choose to exercise this control. The
dispatch further calls ; on us> to restore order
and secure Colombian supremacy in the Isth
mus from which the Colombian povernment
has just by Its action decided to bar us by
preventing the construction of the canal.

The above is only a partial list of the revo
lution?, rebellions, insurrections, riots and
other outbreaks .that have occurred daring the
period tn question: yet they number fifty-three
for the City-seven years. It will be noted
that one of them lasted for nearly three years
before it was quelled; another for nearly a
year.. In short, the experience of over half,
a century bas shown Colombia to be utterly
incapable of keeping order on the Isthmus.
Only the active interference of the United
Stales has enabled her to preserve so much
as a semblance of sovereignty. Had it not
been fear the exercise by the United States of
the police power In her' Interest, her connec
tion with the isthmus would have been sun
dered long ago. In 1S56. in 1860. 1873. in 1SÂ»5.
in 1901. and again in -1902. sailors and ma
rines from United States war ships were forced
to land in order to patrol the isthmus, to pro
tect life and property, and to sÂ«e that the tran
sit across the isthmus was kept r.pea. In IStil.
in 1SÂ«C In 1SS5. and in 1900. the Colombian
Government asked that the United States Gov
ernment would land troops | to .protect its In
terests and maintain order on the isthmus.
Perhaps the most extraordinary request is that
which has just been received and which runs
as follows:
j constant state of flux. The following is a par
' tial list of the disturbances on the Isthmus of

You remember the old catch ques
tion. "What would happen if an irre
sistible force should collide with an
immovable body?"
Some one has answered, "There
xiould be nothing left to happen."
But in boxing the answer is, "A
clinch."
The clinch "comes in handy" in
many different boxing crises. If two
men get into a mix-up and are at such
close quarters that one or both can
not get out of reach to avoid punish
ment they run into a clinch.
If a man is hard pressed, cornered
or dazed, he saves himself by clinch
ing. If a boxer overreaches or fails
to land his blow and is carried on by
his own impetus he clinches.
These are but a few of the count
less times that a clinch is useful.
Practice and intuition will 5n time
teach you to employ It.

E. H. Harriman is at the head of one
of the largest railroad combinations yet
formed. A few years ago he was only
.known in Wall street as a minority
stockholder In the Erie. Turning his
attention westward. Mr. Harriman
first obtained control of the Chicago and
Alton Railroad and the Kansas City and
Southern. He secured a dominating In
fluence in the Illinois Central and soon
afterward took full .control of the Union
Pacific arid the Oregon Short Line. The
subsequent purchase of, the Southern
Pacific by the Union Pacific gave Mr.
Harriman control of 22,302 miles of line
with an aggregate capital stock of
$677,100,000.
The Pennsylvania bought the Long
Island Railroad and the Western New
York and Pennsylvania and secured a
dominating influence in the Norfolk
and Western and the Baltimore and
Ohio. Mr. Morgan, besides his large In
terests with the Vanderbllts. obtained
control of the Erie, the Lehigh Valley,
the Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis
and two or three other roads. Including
the Great Southern Railway system,
which absorbed the Mobile ana Ohio.
Thus three men became the controlling
force of all of the principal railroads In
the East. These roads are comprised In
the Interstate Commerce Commission's
first four groups, which operate 103,470
miles of line, more than half of the
entire railroad mileage In the country.
The aggregate capital stock of the rail
roads In these four groups was on June
30. 1901, $2,518,110,159. and In that year
these roads paid 1303,093,019 to em
ployes. *r
Mr. Morgan's activities also extend
west of Chicago. He reorganized the
Northern " Pacific and with James J.
Hill formed the great northwestern
railroad combination. Including the
Northern Pacific, Great Northern and
the Chicago, Burlington and Qulncy.
These roads are a part of the Inter
state Commerce groups six, seven and
ten. They represent an aggregate cap
italization of about $600,000,000 and in
clude 19.420 miles of line.
It was the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company's -'-esident. A. J. Cassatt, by
the way. who first took up, with W.
K. Vanderbilt and J. Pierpont Morgan,
the auestion of community of interest
among the railroads. When the United
States Supreme Court declared all rail
way traffic agreements to be illegal
these three men undertook to bring all
of the trunk lines operating 1 between
Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard into
harmonious relationship in order to pre
vent rate cutting and secure economies
in operating expenses. It was mutually
agreed that the Pennsvlvanla Railroad
and the Vanderbilt-Morgan interest
should dominate the Eastern railroad
situation. Jointly they purchased con
trol of the Chesapeake and Ohio 'and
the Readins and Jersey Central rail
roads. W. K. Vanderbilt merged the

more bought a larqre interest in the
Lackawanna system.
Less than a dozen men now practi
cally control all of this railroad mile
ape. Twenty years ago nearly every
railroad of importance h..d a different
set of owners, and the controlling In
terests were in most cases antagonistic
because of the sham competition for
traffic. Concentration of control finally
became a necessary means of self-pro
tecticm. After more than one-half of
the largest railroad companies in the
country had, passed through insolvency
a few men took up the problem of rail
road preservation. Much progress has
been made' hi the way of consolidation
and combination, and the lines of con
trol are being drawn more closely each
year. It is interesting to note, how
over, that while the control of railroad
properties has passed into the hands
of a very few, the ownership of rail
way shares is steadily becoming more
nidely diffused. Almost every railroad
company reports this year an increase
in the number of its stockholders.

About Railroads.
It,* is cause for congratulation that the speculative
fluctuations in securities, with all the loss by shrinkage
that has occurred since midsummer, have had no percepti
ble effect upon the soundness of the banks. This is due
to official supervision and proper business caution, which
have joined to cause the banks to margin all loans on
collateral so widely that even the enormous shrinkage
that has overtaken good collateral and bad has not im
paired that kind of security. â¢
Seed time has its currency needs as well as harvest,
but we hear less of them. Thcy ( jp/ess hard upon the
planter, however, in the rate of interest he has to pay
remote from the money centers. That rate decreases his
profits and is the means of multiplying mortgages. ' If
a proper asset currency were permitted, he would be
able to make such economical use of his credit on short
loans as to avoid the mortgage, which once placed is
apt to stay for a long time and to become, in hard times,
the sad means of losing his. estate. Congress and the
financiers need to learn that the grower of crops and
live stock is a part of the whole business body. He is
a business man, and has exactly the same right of access
to the loan fund of the country as the manufacturer, the
merchant and any other class of business" men.
The Comptroller's report shows that loans and dis
counts reached their highest, in the experience of the
banks, in the first half of September, when they amounted
to $3,481,446,772. At the same time the. deposits were
$3,863,512,112 and the reserve was $850,762,184. In the
financial history of the country we have never before
had a banking system that exhibited so much essential
service to the people, with as little loss and risk. It
shows expert and honest management of the loan fund
and if, with equal safety, the element of flexibility is
added to it, securing more equal distribution and cheap
ness in the use of individual credit, the system would be
as perfect as banking facilities can be made 1 .
THE annual report of Mr. Ridgeley, Comptroller of
the Currency, is of interest far outside banking
circles. The season of moving crops is now ad
vanced into its last stages, and business men have
noticed that its. work has been accomplished without the
usual extreme disturbance of currency conditions., For
the. first time in a great many years the Secretary of the
Treasury has not been called to take any extraordinary
measures to prevent a currency stringency, and perhaps
a panic, in order to move the crops to market without
imperiling other business.
The cause is probably found in the Comptroller's re
port. It shows that duringÂ»the past year the number of
national banks increased by 441, with a net increase of
$196,501,053 in resources. This is due to the liberal pro
visions of the amended law, permitting banks to organize
with a less sum of individual capital. But this does not
tell the whole story. ,It is completed by the farther
showing that national bank currency in September last
reached the highest point in its history, being then
$421,222,489, or 55 per cent of the maximum that might
have been issued. This shows a possible currency from
that source of about eight hundred millions, and we are
warranted in believing that the amount issued sufficed
for the currency needs of the country, or it would have
been increased.
The Treasury, omitting its usual extraordinary aid,
adopted the policy of encouraging the organization of
new banks and inducing an increase in their issues. But
it is also pointed out that activity in the organization of
new banks caused such a demand for bonds, as the basis
of their circulation, as to advance the premium and, be
ginning late in September, there was a palpable move
ment in the other direction by the deposit of currency
to redeem bonds, in order to take advantage of the
higher premium.
This is the defect of the system. It is exactly the
defect that causes such propositions as are embodied in
the Shafroth bill, which we have "already noticed. It
makes the volume of currency depend, not upon 'the
needs of the country, but upon the premium on bonds.
The Shafroth proposition, in its main feature, is not
new, since it was proposed long ago to issue a bond, as
security for bank circulation, fixed at such a rate of
interest as would hold it at par, but prevent a premium.
With such a bond deposited to secure circulation the
banks would have to look for profit upon the use of
their maximum amount of currency, and not to the fluctu
ating premium upon their bonds.
The Comptroller admits the necessity for, greater
flexibility in our currency, and renews his recommenda
tion tfiat it be met by permitting 'the banks to cniit
currency above the amount covered by their bonds, that
is to sajvupon other valid assets. This system hasÂ»the
advantage of having been tried by long experience in
the Scotch and Canadian banks. If kept under stern
official supervision and within proper limitations, it
would solve the problem 1 in a particular in which it is '
not solved, even by the favorable conditions that cased
the moving of this season's crops. .

who take charge of the fruit. Surely the revelations
made in the examination of the affairs of the Porter
Bros. Company should spur every producer to activity
and move them all to meet the jobbers half way. "
The avowed purpose of President Francis to investi
gate here suggests, as a natural thing, that there be made
at once a Producers' Association that covers the whole
State, and affiliates every grower, with facilities for
knowing correctly the condition of the crop at various
stages in its growth, and able to estimate the output of
every section as correctly, approximately, as the crops
of wheat, corn and^ cotton are estimable. Such an asso
ciation can be in immediate touch with the jobbers, the
distributers, whose business it will be to know, approxi
mately, the demand in every Eastern locality. Then,
equipped with such knowledge of the supply; and the
demand, the two associations will have the material
upon which to base judgment as to prices.
About this there is no need of sorcery or conjuring.
It is easily within the reach of grower and distributer.
When reached it may not eliminate the wholesaler, but
it will put .1 curb upon his rapacity, and check him in
the use of methods which have heretofore injured both
producer and consumer. \ â¢
THE Eastern fruit jobbers, the actual distributers of
the crop, have organized wjth the intention of
seeking, direct contact with the growers of Cali
fornia and Oregon. The president, Mr. Francis, says
they want to see if the producers out here have been
completely sewedj up by the wholesalers, who have so
long had them in clutches.
Those who have started an investigation into the
market conditions of our fruit have been led to suspect
that- the producers feel under some sort of duress, for
it has been very difficult to secure any information from
them that will aid in improving their condition. It may
well be that a strong jobbers' association will cause the
unlocking of much information that now seems to be
locked up. . â¢

President Eliot of Harvard has determined to protect
his student charges from die ravages of indigestion and
dyspepsia by closing a coffee house that has lived twenty
five years of a bilious existence on the campus. The
learned president seems to have overlooked an ordinary
precaution in not seeking to determine if the over-eating
be mental and not physical. Stuffing in college is a com
mon complaint. .:â¢
Not many days ago there wandered
into the classic precincts a gentle-eyed
old man, who was concealing some
spirituous liquors about his person.
So burdensome was his package that
his manifest distress became evident
to one of the hawk-eyed college po
licemen. Promptly he was taken into
custody by the upholder of academic
dignity^ and haled into the puissant*
court of the Town Justice that a
charge of drunk and disorderly might
be lodged against him.
But long and diligently did Justice
Edgar thumb the ordinances of the
town fathers and at last was prone to
admit that there was no law in the
gentle town of Berkeley making
drunkenness a misdemeanor. Then
the light which sprang to the eyes of
that gentle old man with the package
was soulful and he shook a day-day to
the hawk-eyed college policeman-
Over there in classic Berkeley they
turn their plowshares into swords and
their pruning: hooks into edged
weapons with a facility which Is be
wildering. Their policemen forsake
the furrow to wield the fasces upon
the first call from outraged justice.
Under the efficient direction of A.
L. Bolton, manager of grounds for the
University of California, there has
been organized a valiant band of mln
utemen to patrol the college campus
and preserve the classic dignity which
broods over the hallowed sanctuary of
wisdom. Ready are they to leap from
the plow at the first sign of disorder
and hail the offender. But it is only
recently that the university police
force could demonstrate its efficiency.

more gratifying to find a correspondent
choosing him, as Calverley chose" the
organ-grinder, "for encomium as a
change." Last Monday night our cor
respondent's sister was. waiting for a
Stoke Newington omnibus; her 3-year
old child was with her. AH the passing
omnibuses were full. But a cabman,
seeing her futile efforts, asked If she
wanted to go to Stoke Newington, and
then Invited her to get Inside. "But
your charge Is such a lot," said the
woman. ."Don't you worry," replied
the cabman. "I'm going that way, and
I've had enough of it to-day. My wife
has told me what a job it is to get a
bus on a wet night." And we drove
her to her door for nothing. Our cor
respondent thinks this true story should
be told to prove that some cabmen are
gentlemen. We agree with him.âLon

Governor Pardee has sent a copy
of this dispatch to the California com
missioners to St Louis and has writ
ten that "it seems to be important
that the university should be well rep
resented at the exposition."
Whether the University of California
will get the space it seeks in the edu
cational building at the St. Louis ex
position may be determined to-day.
The space required is 1500 square feet.
Mr. Rogers, the head of the educa
tional department at St. Louis, was to
return from the East to St. Louis yes
terday. The supposition Is that the
matter of space will be taken up to
day.
Governor Pardee has received from
President Francis of the St. Louis
Exposition an answer to his telegram
sent last week asking that the Univer
sity of California be given what space
it needs. The answer from President
Francis is as follows:
"Hon. George C. Pardee, Sacramen
to, Cal.: Early in the exploitation the
department of education and at dif
ferent times and in different ways
urged the University of California to
participate in the exposition, space
being at that time reserved and held
several months for that purpose, but
the university declined without reser
vation. It now seems impossible to
grant any space In view of the in
creased requisition of foreign govern
ments. Â«I will look Into the situation
very carefully and it may be that pro
vision can be made.

The proposed ordinance declaring It
the intention of the board to lower the
grade of Golden Gate avenue at Jones
and Leavenworth streets was laid over
for one week.
City Engineer Grunsky stated that
an estfmate of the cost of lowering the
suiface of the avenue had been made,
but no estimate cf the damages that
night result thei>Irom had bean pre
pared. Attorney McEnerney, repre
senting the St. Boniface Church mem
bers who have protested against the
reduction of grade, held that at least
an approximate estimate of damages
should be made before any proceedings
were taken to lower the grade. Mc-
Enerney held that property owners on
Eddy street were interested, but had
not been notified to attend the meet
ing. James D. Phelan, representing the
property owners favoring the reduc
tion, stated that the committee of prop
erty owners who had recommended the
change of grade had gone further and
included the property owners on O'Far
reil street among those who would be
benefited by the change.

feet wide was passed to print.
The amended ordinance providing

thorizes the board to appoint some suit

was adopted, finding Poundmaster H.
O. Irwin. the Mayor's appointee, guilty
of neglect of duty In that he had Issued
a form of receipt not warranted by law.
Although he testified that in every in
stance when* that form of receipt was
issued his deputies were instructed to
issue an official receipt to correspond
with the receipt, he did not always
compare the stubs of that receipt book
with the official receipts, and the stub
books were destroyed or thrown away
with his knowledge. The vote on the
adoption cf the report was:

G. D. Shadburne, president of St.
Mary's Square Association, appeared
before the Finance Committee and urged
the payment of two judgment demands
obtained In land condemnation pro
ceedings for the proposed park. Audi
tor Baehr refuses to pay the demands
until a stipulation is filed releasing thr 3
city from paying demands In excess of
$125,000, the original appropriation for
the park.
Brandensteln thought that some legal
document should be filed to protect the
city In the matter, but Shadburne
would not consent to it. Shadburne
stated that subscriptions to the amount
of $6000 had already been taken up
among the promoters of the project.
Brandensteln thought the list of sub
scribers should be furnished the com
mittee, but Shadburne thought other
wise. The committee thereupon post
poned action until next- Monday, when
Auditor Baehr will be present and
pome agreement arrived at.
A petition was filed signed by mem
bers of the St. Mary's Square Associ
ation, requesting that the board pro
ceed by right of eminent domain to

such acquisition and the association
will raise by subscription whatever
amount In excess of that sum may be
necessary therefor.

The board adopted a resolution di

"purposes: 1901-2. $25,000; 1902-3. $50,000;
1903-4, $25,000; and if any of the afore
said amounts have been expended other
than for th* purposes appropriated,
then to specify for what purposes they
nave been so expended.

*e!?.ary for the board to take come ac
tion looking to the immediate construc
tion of & municipal road on Market
ttreet. from GÂ«ary street to the ferry
before any steps can be taken to de
termine the right of the city to use
that portion of Market street. The
resolution asking th^ City Attorney for

prior to the recent election, at which
tho Question C f the municipal owner
ship of the Geary street railroad was
submitted to the people.
The communication from Albert Kel
*?Â»>-, BUDerlntendent of the municipal

City Attorney Lar.e advised the
Board of Supervisors yesterday that it
rr.ey proceed under tha charter to Issue
all the bonds voted at the recent elec
tion fcr public Improvements, celling,
however, only as many as may be
needed from time to time. Lane says
tfcat thÂ» board cannot by Its ovm. act
fcrtng the question of the validity of the
bond Issue before the courts and any
attack xnade upon the bonds must
come from those opposed to their Issu
ance.
The resolution authorizing an ex
penditure of ?2000 under the directlqn
of the special committee, of the board
and the Health Board for the purpose
of cleaning Chinatown was passed to
print.
The ordinance prohibiting the erec
tion or maintenance of fences and
framework boards of a greater height
than ten feet above the ground for
painting or posting of signs or adver
tisements thereon was passed to print.
The ordinance is amendatory of one
declared unconstitutional by the courts
because It prohibited the erection of
fences in excess of ten feet from the
sidewalk Instead of from the ground.
The Board of Works was authorized
to advertise for proposals for furnish
ing 100,000 basalt blocks to be used in
repairing streets.
Ordinances were , finally passed

Park, Hill and Parsons avenues, Gor
don, South Broderick, Tilden, Four

phalt pavement on New Montgomery
street from Market to Mission at a cost
of $13,560; ordering the construction of
a sewer in Thirty-seventh avenue
South.
George Renner, manager of the Dray
men's Association, said that his organ
ization would withdraw its objection
to the spur track privilege if regula
tions were adopted prohibiting the cars
from being left on the streets and also
prohibiting the roadways from being
cut up by the tracks.
The board then adopted a resolution
recting the Street and Judiciary Com
mittee to Inquire into and report to
the board a proper and reasonable sys
tem of regulation of the operation and
maintenance of spur tracks. The regu
lations intend that cars Bhall not be
kept standing in the street longer than
a practical time; no compensation
shall be exacted by owners of spur
tracks from others and only grooved
rails shall be used.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the report of the Street Com
mittee, rehislng to rescind the spur
track privilege on Filbert street here
tofore granted to St. Mary's Help Hos
pital. Petitions for tke repeal of the
permit had been filed by the" Labor
Council and other organizations, alleg
ing that the privilege is inimical to
the interests of draymen. '
Secretary Painter of the North Cen
tral Improvement Association held that
the owners of drays should also com
ply with the ordinances regulating
their business, which were being con
stantly violated.

MEMORY MEXDIXO.
Whnt Food Alone Can Do for the
Memory.
The influence of food upon the brain i
and memory is so little understood that j
people are Inclined to marvel at It.
Take a person who has been living on j
improperly selActed food and put h!rn j
upon a scientific diet in Â¦which the food j
Grape-Nuts Is largely used and the in-
crease of the mental power that fol-
lows is truly remarkable.
A Canadian who was sent to Colora-
do for his health Illustrates this point j
in a roost convincing manner. "One year j
ago I came from Canada a nervous i
wreck, so my physician said, and re- j
duced in weight to almost a skeleton
and my memory was so poor that con-
versations had to be repeated that had
taken place only a few hours before. :
I was unable to rest day or night, for j
my nervous system was Ehattored.
"The change of climate helped me
a little, but it was eoon seen that this
was not all that I needed. I required
the proper selection- of food, although
I did not realize It until a friend rec-
ommended Grape-Nuts to me and I
gave this food a thorough trial. Then
I realized what tHe right food could do i
and I began to change In my feelings
and bodily condition. This kept up
until now after six months' use oft
Grape-Nuts all my nervous trouble has
entirely disappeared, I have gained in
flesh all that I had lost and what is j
more wonderful to me than anything
else my memory is as good as it ever
was. Truly Grape-Nuts has remade
me all over, mind and body, when 1
never expected to be well and happy
again." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.

the best terms obtainable. The first
plan was dismissed as suicidal. The
second failed. Since, then" China has

practical steps to be taken. Therefore
the third plan was adopted.

Gun Making in China,
A correspondent of the Lahore Civil
â¢ind Military Gazette visited one of the
Chinese arsenals and thus put down his
impressions: "Finally we were taken,
among other places, to the great-Chin
ese arsenal some way beyond treaty
limits, where every form of munition
of war, from rifles to forty-five ton
suns, was being made. We wandered
through a wilderness of factories, cov
ering acres of ground, and were shown
the whole proces. of manufacture. And
there were powder factories and other
institutions not far away which we had
no tirr.e to visit. 'Jhat was, perhaps,
the most significant experience of all.
You may have seen gun factories be
fore, but have you seen a place turning
out great guns by the dozen, and ma
chine guns by the hundred, perfect In
design and construction, run, from
cooly to head mandarin, entirely, by
Chinese, and with only a couple of
Englishmen engaged solely in consulta
tive supervision? Have you seen a
roomful of Chinese draughtsmen and
designers in pigtails ,and blue gowns
Folemnly, stolidly and assiduously get
ting out the drawings for a new gun?
It is a Eight that furnishes food for
thought. And as you leave you ask
yourself the question: 'If these men
can make guns, why may they not
work them some day?" " â Brooklyn
The Chancellor is glad to be able to

BERLIN," Dec. 7.â Chancellor von

message of sympathy from American
friends of the Emperor, authorizes the
Associated Press to express his sin

imperial majesty. - The : Chancellor
brought the messages to the Emperor's
knowledge and authorizes the Asso
ciated Press to say that the Emperor
expressed his pleasure over these tes

Chancellor von Bulow is willing that
the Associated Press should name him
as authority for the statement that the
Emperor's recovery has progressed
naturally and uninterruptedly, that the
Emperor's condition Is excellent, and
that he. feels very well. The continued
issuance of bulletins is regarded as
superfluous, the attendance of physi

necessary and there is not the slight

Bulletin Concerning Messages
From the United States
A convicted bookmaker is at once ex
pelled by the organized members of the
latter body, known throughout the
country for Its disciplinary methods
with persona alleged to have violated
racing ethics, who would naturally
come within its control. This was dojie
with a bookmaker connected with the
Wax Taper case. He was expelled and
his seat sold to the highest bidder, he,
of course, receiving the proceeds of the
sale.
It was. however, argued by some to
day that a member of the' Metropolitan
Turf Association who earns expulsion
should thereby forfeit his seat in the
Bookmakers* Association and the price,
realized should go to the sinking fund.
Xo Xcw Developments.
There were no fresh developments in
the turf scandal yesterday. President
Thomas H. "Williams said that if any
of the disgraced riders wish to appear
before the stewards and admit their
guilt their reinstatement would be im
mediately considered. Many are of the
opinion that Bookmaker Jim Davis has
not strengthened his case by acknowl
edging that John Condon and Clarence
Waterhouse held an interest in his
book. They are at a loss to figure why
keen and shrewd as the California pen
cller is and possessed of ample means
to go it single handed, did he wish to
give a piece of the book to Messrs Con
don and Waterhouse? Â«
Davis is a member of the Metropoli
tan Turf Association, and the question
among men about town was as to
whether the California Jockey Club of
ficials would submit the proofs alleged
to be in their possession to the Jockey
Club officials here and to the executive
committee of the Metropolitan Turf
Association.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â In racing, cir
cles to-day the chief topic of conversa
tion was the ruling off in California of
the well-known bookmaker, James
Davis, and three jockeys who have
been riding at the Oakland track since
racing opened there for the season on
November 14.
Davis made books on the Eastern ra'ce
courses during the last season and,
while successful, had not attracted
criticism either from his associate
bookmakers or from those extraordi
narily acute ring generals who are al
ways on the lookout for men laying
against alleged "dead 'uns."
Special Dispatota to ThÂ©' Call,
ly careless practical joker in the audi
ence lit a paper under a sleeping man's
<hair and shouted -Fire." Several
hundred persons on that side of the
garden rushed In panic from their seats
and breaking through the guard rail
fell and 6lid down the steep sides of
the wooden trade, a number of the
ilying riders having close escapes from
Â«*ollisions. Keferee Reeves immediately
ordered the riders to dismount and suc
ceeded in stopping them before the
loaders reached the struggling maes on
the track. In the galleries the cry of
fire caused great excitement, but after
several minutes order was restored and
the race resumed.
The whirlwind pace set at the outset
of the race was slackened after the
â¢withdrawal rar!y to-day of Kramer and
Tenn. who went in to pace the first
!~,S miles, and at 1:10 a. m. the leaders.
â¢ ho had finished 225 miles and two
liips, were nearly a mile behind the
record. A number of falls took place
during the day, the most serious acci
dent being that in which Bowler, SimÂ«r
:;nd McLean went down, McLean laps
ing to unconFciousness and being un
able to continue. His teammate. Mor
gan, continued the race for several
liours alone, but could find no partner
and the team was withdrawn.
All the other teams at 10 o'clock were
well bunched, except Hedspeth and
Dove, the colored riders, who had been
lapped repeatedly.
Simar was taken sick about 9 o'clock
and retired. Gougoltz then announced
That he would team with Rettick of
the German team. Beaugendrie, Ret
tick's partner, having announced his
intention of quitting.
The leaders' score at midnight were:

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 7.â Information
regarding the - post-season football
gan^e for Minnesota was made public
by Manager Barnard to-day. A month
ago negotiations were opened between
the Minnesota management and the
promoters on the Pacific Coast for a
football game. Terms, could not be
agreed upon and the affair , was
dropped. Recently negotiations were
again quietly opened which culminated
in an agreement whereby Dr. Williams
is to take his football players to San
Francisco to play the University of
California on New Year's day.
Two years ago Coach Yost took the
Michigan team west and they defeated
the Pacific Coast champions 43 to 0.
The polo game was played last year,
but it did not. draw well and it was
consequently decided to have a foot
ball game again this year.
The Minnesota players will take light
practice In the armory every day and
also do a little outdoor running to im
prove their wind.

JLÂ»n Neil lost his shifty sprinter Mike

three furlongs Mn 26 seconds the gelding
dropped dead on the track. Â«
When questioned regarding a match
race, Tobe Ramsey, trainer of Hora
tiu3, signified his perfect willingness to
pit the three-year-old against Divina
at the same weights as carried by each
in the handicap on Saturday last." The
association will hangup a purse of $500.
and a telegram was sent to Jo Terry
at Sacramento last night stating such
to be the facts and that he could be
accommodated with a side wager of
$2500. The Sacramento turfman issued
the defl. and if the match* is made it
"will be run to-morrow.
Double Six ran in the colors of the
wealthy New York turfman, Jack Fol
lansbee. Bob Smith had the mare ready
first rattle- out of the box, just as he
did last season.
The stable C. C. McCafferty brought
from Latonia comprises the following
horses: Fair Lady Anna, Quizz II, Eda
Riley, Chicakdee, Flaneura, Mr. Far

George Berry, superintendent of Napa

yesterday.

track yesterday.
XQTKS OF TIIE TRACK.
Looking over the entries in the mile
and fifty-yard selling number, Con
stellator appeared to have fallen into
a soft spot. But, at odds of even
money, he. trailed in behind Kitty
Kelly, which mare was well played at
2^ to 1. Achilles, a 40 to 1 shot, was
third.
Bob Smith had Double Six tuned to
concert pitch first time out, and in
the five and a half furlong sprint the
Domino mare made Glendenning show
the white feather. The latter gelding
had first call, backed from V to 5 to*
4 to 5, and was outfooted from the
first Jump and downed cleverly by two
lengths in l:06>i. Albemarle ran a very
fair race, finishing third.
Somenos, from the Josephs stable,
was the next favorite to fall by the
wayside. The three-year-old closed a
2 to 1 chance for the seven-furlong
selling affair next decided, but got no
piece of the purse. Foley. who rode
*St. Winifride. made too much early
use of the filly or she would have won.
Tiring with the wire in sight, she was
headed by both Illowaho and Heather
Honey, the former getting a head de
cision. The winner was 12 to 1 in the
ring. , . *
Bill Massie was installed favorite for
the introductory seven-furlong selling
affair, but Quite evidently the track
was too hard tor him, and he finished
fourth. In a driving finish, Hilde
brand, on the 6 to 1 chance. El Piloto,
reached the wire first, beating Tele
phone out a length. Elie, at 15 to 1, was
third.
On a previous excellent run, 8 to 5
looked a fair price about Dargin to
take the five-furlong dash for maiden
two-year-olds and 2Vss to 1 was obtain
able. Otis had the mount on the
Schreiber entry, and succeeded in land
ing him an easy first over Instrument
and Harbor.
The racing at Oakland yesterday
could practically be called featureless,
excepting, possibly, the remarkable
stretch run made by Ilorton in the last
race of the afternoon, a mile and firty
yard run. Even money was the first
quotation chaiked against thÂ« Burns
handicap winner of rjiKJ. but such a
spirited play developed on Hosarie and
Uedwald that' the favorite's odds
lengthened to 2 to 1. At the start, or
soon after the barrier was sprung,
Ilorton stumbled and, as Harry
Thatcher led the field Into the back
stretch, the first choice looked hope
lessly out of it. Even when the stretch
for home was reached his chances
looked blue, but Jack Martin squeezed
through openings no wider than lence
cracks and, in a 'lierce drive, beat
Kosarle a head on the wire. Kedwald,
which looked a winner an eighth of a
mile from the stand, ran a close third.
Fine weather attracted a large
crowd, and business was brisk in the
ring. Besides Horton, Barney Schrei
ber's Dargin was Xhe only other favor
ite to earn brackets.

A POOR. CRUTCH. <^^M
Experience is a dear teacher, as those who pin their /^j/j^^Iv^W
faith to Mercury find out sooner or later. This power- (i|SK^( |S f
ful : poison combined with Potash, is the treatment gen- L\ Wi
crally prescribed for Contagious Blood Poison, but failure 791 /\ \ 'w
and disappointment is the invariable result. These min- gf*-J >Â«w vl
erals drive in the sofces and eruptions, and apparently the /w^//j^J?k >
disease is gone and the patient believes the cure perma- /^FA^^^^jj^
nent, but soon learns better when the old symptoms ?= *^|
return almost as soon as the treatment is left off. You*
must either keep the system saturated with mercury or endure the tortures
of sore mouth, ulcera Jed throat and the mortification that one naturally
" feels when the body is covered with disgusting sores, rashes" , copper-colored
splotches and other aggravating symptoms of this vile disease.
Mercury and Potash are poor crutches, and their use eventually breaks
down the constitution, ruins the digestion arid cause the bones to decay.
'"^m*J ' y*-m^ â¢"Â¦""s s - s - S. , a guaranteed purely vegetable remedy, is the

liquid Â¦ refreshments. In Judge Ca

that he ordered a bottle of beer, for
which he expected to pay not more
than 50 cents, but instead of beer he
was served with a quart of champagne
âor some sort of a beverage masquer
ading under that title â and when it
came to a question of paying for the
same, the lady who served It insisted
that ha owed her $10. His vigorous
protest led to his arrest, and in his
possession was found a small pistol
of Amsterdam manufacture, which the
policeman handled with ostentatious
contempt, as he held it up for. the in
spection of the court.
"I don't propose to have this court

accusations of petty larceny to his dis

guest at the hotel in which he was

The Tinklers and Â£ the Fitzgeralds !
dwell oDDOsite each other in the 400
block of Clementina street, and that
they do not dwell In complete amity
was proven yesterday to the dissatis
faction of Judge. Cabaniss, who makes
a specialty of promoting harmony be-;
tween neighbors. John Fitzgerald was :
the defendant and William J. Tinkler
the complainant, the gentlemen being
the respective heads of the two fami
lies, and each was " flanked and . sup
ported by a mob of relatives, ready and
eager to testify.
Mr. Tinkler's grievance against Mr. ;
Fitzgerald originated in the inability
of. the feminine members of the two
households to "get on," and when Mr.
Fitzgerald approached his home at
midnight Saturday, singing in loud
voice and otherwise disturbing the noc
turnal quiet that usually hangs like a
pall upon the 400 block of Clementina,
street, Mr. Tinkler raised his bedroom 1
window and expostulated, whereupon
Mr. Fitzgerald maliciously grasped the
bell attached to the front door of the
Tinkler domicile and Jerked it with
such vigor as to break it. In corrob
oration of this testimony the ladles of
the Tinkler family testified with avid
ity, but their statements did not go un
contradicted.
"How about the sarcastic remarks
that the Tinklers hurl across the street
at us every time we put our noses out
side the door?" inquired Miss Fitzger
ald* a pretty girl of piquant manner.
"My dear young lady, I regret to
state that I cannot answer that ques
tion," eaid the court, "and I am
pained to rule that, as it has nothing
whatever to. do with the bell-breaking
Incident Saturday night, It Is irrele
vant, immaterial and Incompetent."
Miss Fitzgerald tossfed her head and
glared with mingled defiance and con
tempt at the female Tinklers.
"But," resumed the court, "you
may derive some solace Â¦ from a- time
honored adage which I shall quote to
you:
Sticks and atones may break our bonÂ«Â«.
Foul names can never hurt us.
"There Is a world of philosophy in
that humble quotation, from an author
whose identity has unfortunately been
lost the shuffle of history-making,
but whose name should be emblazoned
among those of the bards immortal.
Remember . the precious words, Miss
Fitzgerald, and should the Tinklers
again assail your ears with uncom
plimentary allusions, the remembrance
Â¦ may convey unction to your souL At
the same time I would suggest to the
Fitzgeralds that they restrain, curb
and keep in abeyance any impulse
which may seize them to hurl a sar
casm across the street when they Bee
a Tinkler nose project from the door
of that family's domicile. I would re
mind the Fitzgeralds here assembled
that there is a statute which provides
for the , punishment of a person who
willfully unloads abusive language
upon another." .
With these words *of advice and ad
monition, the Judge proceeded to re
view the testimony and adjudge the
case, which was finally accomplished
by Mr. Fitzgerald promising to re
pair the Tinkler door-bell and to here
after Ignore the Tinkler noses^
Dr Gerino was arrested last August
for practicing medicine In San Fran
cisco without a certificate from the
State board. The matter Is brought to
the attention of the Supreme Court on
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
It is arcued by the defense that sec
tion P of the act creating the board is
unconstitutional because it gives dis
criminatory power.
The mejnbers of the board may arbi
trarily grant or refuse a certificate to
practice, -no matter what credentials
the applicant may present. It is held
that the Legislature has no right to
delegate such power. The act provides
that the board may grant certificates
to those holding diplomas or licenses
from certain classes of institutions with
or without examination.
It is asserted by the counsel for the
defendant that the law should give dis
cretionary but not discriminatory pow
er. It is also claimed that the board,
having more alopathlc than homeo
pathic and eclectic physicians as mem
bers, may decline to grant certificates
to certain classes of medical practition
ers. Through the alleged Invalidity of
the section in It is claimed
that the whole act is unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court took under con
sideration yesterday the question as to
the validity of the law providing for
a State Board of Medical Examiners.
The arguments of both parties to the
dispute were presented at length and
the case* was ordered submitted. An
opinion will probably not be handed
down for several months.
About fifty similar cases aA pending
In various courts of California. Dr. G.
R. Gerino is the defendant in the test
suit. Ex- Justice Garoutte Is appearing
for the contestants and Charles Wheel
er for the Board of Examiners.
"She never nursed Mrs. Morris."
said the witness, "or. took any care of
her. On the contrary, she treated her
cruelly. She made her mother sleep
on a hard couch while she occupied a
soft bed, and once she chased the
poor woman about the house with a
large knife. She "
The witness did not have a chance to
tell what else Mary Morris did. for
at this point In her testimony the
plaintiff rose to her feet with a yell
that would have put to shame the best
effort of a Camanche brave on the
warpath. She followed it with another,
equally as strong and earpiercing. Her
sister Cora helped her out with the
third scream, the voices of the two
making a combination of sounds hard
to describe. The fifth was nipped In
the bud by all the attorneys concerned
and the bailiff, assisted by Charles
Morris, clerk of the court. They
grabbed the excited women and rushed
them toward the door, where Cora
turned and. throwing her arms in the
air, yelled again, following the scream
with a loudly and dramatically uttered
curse upon the Judge and others.
The suit is the result of a battle over
the $12,000 estate of Bridget Morris,
who died last February. She left a
will g^ing the property to her three
children, Edward, Mary and Cora
Morris, share and share alike, and
naming H. P. Umbsen as executor.
Mary thought she was entitled to a lit
tle more, because of certain services
she claimed she had rendered her
mother from February, 1901. up to the
time of her death. Cora agreed with
her, but the executor and Edward did
not, and in consequence the latter re
fused to allow her claim against- the
estate for the extra amount The claim
is for $2290, two years' pay at the rate
of $3 a day.
Mary and Cora Morris, sisters, cre
ated a scene in Judge Sloss' court
yesterday. During the progress of the
suit of Mary Morris against H. P.
Umbsen, as executor of the will of
Bridget Morris, their mother, they
grew hysterical and disturbed the
peace and quiet of the, courtroom by
yelling and screaming at the top of
their voices. They stopped only when
the court bailiff led them from the
room and took them to the Emergency
Hospital for treatment.
Hanna Holmes, a witness for the de
fense, was the cause of the . dis
turbance. During the course of her
testimony she said that the claim of
Mary Morris for pay for services as a
nurse alleged to have been rendered
during the last two years of her
mother's life waB not a just one.
When the court had heard the facts
of the case, as above narrated, he
opined that Stephenson was largely the
aggressor and had provoked all the dis
turbance created by the mate. The sea
man was very repentant and on his
promise to duly respect his superior of
ficer ashore as well as on shipboard,
the case was dismissed.
Ed Stephenson, rated "A. B." on the
books of the good ship Invercauld, was
convinced yesterday that the rigid dis
cipline of the British merchant marine
is a good thing to adhere to when
ashore. With First Mate Fred C. Stock
el of the same stanch craft. Seaman
Stephenson was in a Montgomery street
clothing store last Saturday, and while
inspecting some garments which the
mate had anproved, he decried, their
quality and pronounced their price ex
orbitant. This difference of opinion led
to sharp words between the mariners,
and the man before the mast became
so excessively insubordinate that the
mate ordered him to return to his ship.
The order was flatly disobeyed and a
rough and tumble fight ensued, In
which both were actively engaged when
a policeman disturbed them. They
were before Judge Mogan yesterday
morning on a charge of disturbing the
peace.
Supreme Court Reserves Its De
cision Pending Thorough
Consideration of the Case
Scream Loudly and One Curses
His Honor Upon Hearing the
Testimony of Raima Holmes
Policeman Joseph Feld must answer
before the Superior Court to the charge
of murdering: his father-in-law, Fritz
Dirking, on November 2 last. He was
remanded without bail yesterday morn
ing by Police Judge Fritz.
With studied indifference, the de
fendant listened to the latest testimony
against him, given by Mrs. Sarah Tay
lor of 2420 Clay street. 'The woman told
a straightforward storyi and Attorney
Alford's efforts to weaken it. were not
resultant of signal triumph. /Through
out her recital and the cross-examina
tion Feld watched her face and lis
tened to her words with a seeming in
difference that occasionally savored of
ennui. At the pronouncement of the
court's decision his face wore an ex
pression of mingled weariness and re
lief.
Mrs. Taylor said that about two
years ago she became acquainted with
Feld and the Dirklngs through living
next door to them. On May 1 of the
present year Feld voluntarily told her
he had had trouble with the Dlrkings,
and he also voluntarily showed her a
purse containing cartridges and in
formed her that he was going to shoot
the entire family. Â¦ \
The remainder of the testimony was
neither new nor -very Important, and
Judge Fritz gave his decision promptly.
him not unduly insane, considering
there wa^ a woman , in the case. A
brother of the defendant appeared in
court' and promised to take him away
to Mendoclno County, where he will. not
be irritated at the sight of his wife re
vealing the future at cut rates. '

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
~~~~~~^.-..- *-.-~. Â»Â» Â¦ .^x^
EIGHT REASONS
why Scott's Emulsion is an
ideal food-medicine.
1. It is partly pre-digested
and therefore passes quickly
into the blood.
2. It imposes no tax upon
the stomach or other 'digest-
ive organs.
3. It does not cause
fermentation such as usually
results from ordinary food
when the stomach is weak.
4. Its action is mild and
even, insuring the greatest
nourishment with the least
effort. v
5. Its quality is always
uniform.
6. It feeds and strengthens
the bones, blood, nerves and
tissues.
7. It is one of the greatest
flesh producers known to
medical science.
8. It is palatable and
agreeable to the taste and
easily taken.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The damage she sustained in this lat
est battle Is also extensive. Her top
mast is damaged, also her fore yards
and three topsail yards. Her rudder
is injured and serious havoc has been
wrought about the decks.
The American bark Willscott has
again been stripped of her wings by
the elements and is at present under
going repairs at Port Stanley, Falkland
Islands. She was on her way from
Philadelphia for San Diego when she
ran into the gale. News of her putting
into Port Stanley was received yester
day at the Merchants' Exchange in a
cablegram from London.
The Willscott formerly sailed under
the British fag and'gained the right to
fly the Stars and Stripes some years
ago through the repairs necessary after
weathering a terriflc gale off the Aus
tralian coast. In that storm the ves
sel's steel "masts buckled over and for
several days to the terror of the gale
was added a thrilling bombardment as
the broken spars battered the ship's
steel sides. It was several days before
the tangled mass of metal spars and
steel rigging were cut loose. The few
bold strokes of a gleaming ax so effec
tive in the days of wooden spars and
hempen shrouds proved of no avail In
the case of the Willscott and the clear
ing of the wreckage involved many
weary hours of tedious work with ham
mers and cold chisels. During most of
this time the vessel wailowed helplessly
in the trough of , the sea, drifting per
ilously doss to a rock-ribbed shore.
When the wreckage was cleared nearly
every man aboard had cripped hands,
the wounds from the Jagged steel hav
ing become infected. Notwithstanding
the fact that of the masts the stumps
only remained and, undaunted by the
lack of spare spars, these resourceful
sailormen got a mervelous Jury rig on
their vessel and with yards built of 2x6
planking and sails of all sorts, shaped
and sizes, brought their vessel across
the Pacific and into this port. She
made a good passage and her cargo
was intact. Her British owners sold
her rather than make the necessary re
pairs, which proved to be sufficiently
extensive to entitle the vessel to Ameri
can register.
TeedinK before the Harbor Commission

teresting.
Yesterday passed without unusual
happenings en the wharves. The pro-
A rumcr was circulated yesterday
that the commission men. if they are
finally defeated in the courts, may
drop all their permits, cart the goou.=
that they want to their stores as they
en- received and charge up the cost of
cartage and storage and handling to
the producers by whom the consign
ments are made.
The Harbor Commissioners now have
tT.o affidavits before them. In one of
these several Crms that still hold per

sociation. Commissioner Spear â¢ Â«?aid
last evening that the Commissioners
would not take any fu%her action un
tU after to-morrow, when the commis
sion men would probably indicate what
their line cf procedure would be. Com
ir.lÂ£E5oi:er Spear also said that proba
bly a test case would be made up by
the commission men. This is the gen
craJ opinion of business men.
It may be decided to have one of the
parties who has been denied permission
to sell perish a bie products on the
Â¦wharves openly proceed to sell, with
the understanding that an arrest will
follow and that by this method the la-.v
will be considered by the Judges. At
present the Harbcr Commissioners are
adhering to \he line of action that was
marked out br them last week when
they revoked four permits to sell.
No sales were attempted on the
Â¦wharves yesterday by the four houses
that have tten deprived of permits.
Potatoes, beans and onions are the
rrindpal farm products now coming
into the market. The Jackson and
"Washington street wharves show a
great accumulation of these vegetables
Tiled up there v.ithin the last forty

toes, thousand? cf sacks, has not been
held on the wharves before in a long
time. The four firms without permits
did not attempt to cart away the goods

The name of the footpad that held
up six men in Little's saloon on How
ard street, near Fourth, on Sunday
night is not Harry Howard, but W. J.
Watson. He made that confession to
Detective Ryan yesterday morning and
admitted that he had just completed a
term of ten years In the penitentiary
at St. Louis for highway robbery. His
parents live In Indian Territory and his
chief desire was that they should not
know of his arrest here.
Watson was not alone In the hold-up.
He had two companions, W. H. Owens
and a youth known as "the Kid," who
came here with him from Texas on De
cember 2 for the sole purpose of rob
bing people. Owens was in the saloon
and when Watson ordered the men to
throw up their hands Owens also threw
up his hands, but was prepared to go
to Watson's assistance if there had
been any attempt at resistance. "The
Kid" remained outside the saloon on
the lookout. Owens was arrested yes
terday morning at the Denver House,
217 Third street, by Detectives Ryan
and Taylor and locked up In the
"tanks," where he will be detained till
It Is determined what charge can, be
made against him. . "The Kid" has not
yet been arrested.
Watson was in Police Judge Mogan's
court yesterday on a charge of robbery.
When his case was called he limped
out of the dock, as his wounded leg
was bothering him, and In answer to
the Judge said he did not have an at
torney. He was instructed as to his
rights and the case was continued till
December 11, when the Judge will ap
point an attorney to look after his in
terests.
Policeman Charles F. Skelly, who
wounded Watson, and Policeman T. C.
Murphy, who arrested him, were in
court yesterday. They said that Wat
son, after his arrest, told them that if
his revolver had worked properly they
would have both been in the Morgue.
Both officers have been highly compli
mented for their courage in arresting
such a desperado.
It appears that the same bullet that
struck Watson on the leg also struck
the wounded lad, George King of 157
Clara street. After the bullet struck
Watson it hit the ground and rebound
ed; striking the boy, who out of curios
ity got in the line of fire. The boy's
condition remains unchanged at the
Central Emergency Hospital, but Dr.
J. D. Murphy says that unless blood
poisoning sets in his chances for recov-
Macken drank the liquor, walked
across the street to the paint shop and
killed himself.
"That's a very poor way to do," re
marked Glowbody; then, seeing that
the stranger needed a stimulant,
added: "Well, take it anyway; I
guess you need It."
Joseph Macken, a man about 35
years of age, placed the muzzle of a
pistol In' his mouth yesterday and sent
a bullet into his brain. He died in
stantly.
The deed was committed in the paint
shop of Peter Brown, 666* Mission
street. At 8:45 o'clock in the morning
Macken entered the shop, drew a
chair up to the counter and sat down.
John Brown, brother of the proprietor,
was kindling a fire and, seeing that
Macken was a total stranger, walked
toward him' and asked whether he
could do anything for him. The man
made no repry, but quickly drawing a
revolver out of his pocket, placed the
muzzle in his mouth and' pulled the
trigger. An ambulance from the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital was sum
moned immediately, but the suicide
was dead when it arrived.
Peter Glowbody, a bartender in a
saloon at the corner of Third and Mis
sion streets, identified the body as that
of a man who had walked into his
place that morning and ordered a
drink of whisky and, . when it was
served to him. declared that he had
been held up a short time before that
and had been robbed of every cent he
had.

KFTT YOICK. I>c. 7.â All the interest in
to-df.y'y clock market up to the l&et hour was
â¢ onfined to the movements of a few special
ties. These served to hold thÂ« market firm,
<1mpdte the dullness of the trading elsewhere
in the list, until the time for the publication of
the Preiideiii's mtssag'-. Immediately upon
tlÂ»<s HFjtfarartc* of that document the market
took on strength and animation and advanced
comprehensively. The railroad list, which
! ;.m lain inrrt up to that time, came into the
upward movement and tbe prominent active
l>-ad>rft made gain* of a point or more. 'St.
i'nul gained tf-mrly 2 points. The profeftMonal
trader*, who did roost of the buying c-f the

jHjratlo-n regulation. It was not until late. in
-,he day that thÂ« extent of the engagements of
cold in I^ondon for -exoort became known.
ThÂ«"f* footed up over $1,400,000. For the
Â«n-eater part of the day the active speculation
in Amalgamated Cor-per predominated in the
whol* market. TtoÂ« buying of this etock was
rrofc-enediy based ux>on the co-called fair trial
liji; in Montana, but tbe personality of the
brokrr* employed In tbe buying also had a
strong Â¦ influence upon sentiment, being taken

Receipts of Potatoes over Sunday were
large, aggregating 14.347 . sacks, and Included
3107 from Oregon. The market waa quiet, ' as
the dullness Which usually prevails on Mon
day was enhanced by the closing of a large
number of restaurants owing to labor trou
bles. Three cars of Sweet Potatoes cams in
and there was a sharp decline in prices.
Onions were In free supply and ruled weak
at easier rates.
Mont kinds of vegetables were in ample
supply, and although quotations bad little
change, prices were inclined to easiness, ow
ing to the light demand among dealers who
cater to the restaurant trade. Poor quality
offerings of Peas and Beans â¢ from Los An
geles were still abundant and moved very
slowly at unsteady rates. Very poor lots were
still offering at rÂ»Oc(?f?l per sack. Tomatoes
from Los Angeles were weak owing to the
abundance and low prices of the Bay article.
Carrled-over lots of the latter were offering
below, the quotations and the canncrs secured
quite a quantity at 10c per box. Offerings of
Green Peppers were chiefly of poor quality and
sold slowly while Dried Peppers, which were
plentiful, met with a fair demand at good
flgurrs.

months. Toward the end of the first hour a
good demand developed on reports of heavy
rains In Argentina, which resulted in the mar
ket becoming strong, with May up to S2%c.

crease in the visible supply, together with
later reports from Argentina, contradicting the
earlier advices and claiming favorable, har
vesting weather there, brought out an abun
dance of Felling orders, and prices again de
clined. May going down to 81%c. Much of the
celling was due to rumors to the effect that the
big holder was unloading through commission
houses. There was an urgent demand later In
the day from brokers who were credtted with
buying for the bull leader, and with only small
offerings a rally occurred, and the close was
strong with prices near the top. May closing

"We are in this flght to win. We can
bring other restaurants into line If we
need them. "We will take no steps to
close other restaurants unless they at
tack us. We could stop the meat and
fish supplies of other houses, but will
only do so as a defensive measure. An
other meeting of the association will be
held to-morrow afternoon."
The Nathan Dohrmann Company
solved the problem of providing eat
ing places for their help by spreading
tables in the annex to their building.
Three hundred employes partook of
excellent fare as guests of the firm.
The closing of the restaurants Is seri
ously Injuring the markets for many
lines of produce, notably poultry, game,
fruits, potatoes, vegetables, butter and

IX FIGHT TO WIN'.
We. have had an intimation that thÂ«
unions would like to confer, and wo
have expressed ourselves as being de
sirous of meeting them.
A large audience enjoyed the open re
hearsal of the Treble Clef Club yes
terday afternoon at Steinway Hall.
Among those taking part- were Mrs.
John Madden and Miss Viola Samter
In "The Ode to Music" (Zoellner), ac
companied by the chorus. Miss Eliza
beth Gowan accompanied cleverly.
Rehearsal of 'Treble Clef Club.
A rumor reached a member of the
Restaurant Keepers' Association yes
terday that the unions were ready and
willing to confer with It. At a meeting
held In the afternoon Chairman John
son of the executive committee moved
that the committee now having the af
fairs of the association in charge be
empowered to meet and treat with any
committee from the unions. The mo
tion was adopted and it remains for
the unions to arrange such "a meeting.
In discussing the affairs of the asso
ciation last night. Mr. Johnson said:
"Tortoni's. Delmonico's, Marchand's
and the Bav State are not members
of our association, but will close if the
association requests Mr. Blanco of the
Poodle Dogr. We are not ready to call
upon the French restaurants, as we
feel we have the situation well in hand.
The Restaurant Keepers* Association
was ready to go on under the old
agreement between the association and
the unions, which would expire on Jan-,
uary 31 on the following conditions:
First, that the unions put back the
crews they took out of the Central
Dining Room and the Tivoll Cafe. Sec
ondly, that they cancel all the agree
ments they have enforced from indi
vidual members of the association:
and, thirdly, that while this agreement
last, they refrain from compelling
members of the association to sign in
dividual agreements.
"Before we ask Mr. Blanco to close
we will await further developments.
2013 Mission: 8. C. Bernedo. 218 Townsend.
The so-called "French" restaurants,
Marchand's, Poodle Dog, Pup, Delmon
co's and Tortoni's, were open for busi
ness. Mr. Blanco, proprietor of the
Poodle Dog, Is a member of the asso
ciation and had he closed the other
places, with the exception of Mar
chand's, would ha,ve shut their doors.
The association did not deem It neces
sary to call upon Mr. Blanco to close,
although he is willing to do so, so says
Mr.- Johnson, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Restaurant
Keepers' Association, when requested.

The proprietors of- the Humboldt
House say that Benes has been living
off the earnings of his wife for many
months. They arrived there last
spring and the woman went to, work
in the kitchen. Benes hung around
the place and refused to work. Soon
after that they went to Los Angeles.
They left there after a short stay, the
.wife leaving her husband and return
ing to work at the hotel and Benes
going to Sonoma County.
He returned here two .months ago
and sought out his wife, but she re
fused to have anything to do w : lth
him. Then he went to Los Angeles
and nothing more was heard of him
till he arrived here on Saturday.
When he ran short of funds he would
take his wife's money and when that
was spent he every pawned her
clothes. She finally left him, unable
to stand his abuses and threats any
longer.
Among Benes' effects was discov
ered a long letter written In German,
in which he declared his Intention of
killing his wife and himself. He
broods over his troubles In the note
and accuses his wife of being intimate
with another man.
Mrs. Benes brought suit for divorce
against, her husband pn December 3.
She alleges In her complaint that he
had abused her, pawned her clothes
and even went so far as to strike her
In the face at. the corner of Broad
way and \ Stockton street . several
months ago.
CONVERSES WITH FRIEND.
Benes, while conversing with a
friend last night, said:
"Nine days ago I sent my wife's
sister to San Francisco to see If she
could not Induce my wife to return
home. I wanted her to come back and
live with me, so that we might have a
happy Christmas. Last Friday my
sister-in-law returned to Los Angeles
and said that she had been unable to
do anything with my wife. She said
that my wife said that she* was never
going to come back. She was. happy
and having a big time and didn't want
to come back. .
"I then left Los Angeles and arrived
here Sunday. I Immediately went to
her apartments and tried to get, her
to return and told her that I Intended
to kill her If she did not come home
with' me. My efforts, however, .were
unavailing. I have had the revolver
for a long time qnd "brought It with
me to force her 'to come back with
me." ' , V . ' â¢ . - . .â¢"lAt-'-Tj;

George came down after me. He said,
'Good-by. I don't want you any longer

before. I said I did not want him any
more. I don't know whether I will
die or not. I hope I'll get well. This
happened In the cellar of the Humboldt
House, 1309 Stockton street. He tried
to shoot me once. I don't know what
he did then. He came in the side door,
which was open. EMMA BENES."
Witnesses-Louis Ward, Thomas

drew. .
Benes was removed to the Emer
gency Hospital at the City Hall. He
expressed: regret that his attempt at
self-destruction had failed and added
that he would end his own life at the
first .opportunity. He said he had
made preparations to take the life of
his wife and then his own. .He aver
red that the woman was untrue to
him and jealousy drove him insane.
Following is his statement:
"I saw. Emma on the street about
6 o'clock this morning. I followed
her. I saw my wife go into the cellar
at 1309 Stockton street. I said, 'Em
ma, come back to me.- She said, 'I
don't want anything more to do with
you.' I pulled my pistol from my back
pocket and shot her. She started to
run and I shot her. Then I shot my
self and said. 'Good-by.' I don't feel
like I am going to die. I work in the
telephone company at Los Angeles. I
made a mistake. .1 saw Emma In the
house. I went there, and saw Renner
at the bar. Then I went into the bath
room and waited. I put' my hand on
her shoulder and begged her to come
back to me. She said, 'Go away,' and
I shot her. â¢ â¢ GEORGE BENES."

The hungry had a wild search for
places to eat yesterday. The leading
restaurants of the city were closed by
the order of the Restaurant Keepers'
Association and the eating houses that
Merc open were far too small to ao
commodate the hungry horde that
clamored for food. Many homeless peo
ple, who look to the restaurants for
their meals, hunted up places that
were open and congratulated them
selves that the ban had not reached
their discovery.
Those who labor in the business sec
tion of the city took no chances. They
provided themselves with lunches and
passed the closed restaurants with an
independent air. The fair stenographer
and the equally fair saleslady carried
all sorts of parcels and boxes contain
ing edibles. Music rolls, "phony" cam
eras and dress suit cases were pressed
Into service to carry the staff of life
and some hard-boiled eggs and fixings.
CLOSED
"With the passion of Jealousy burn
ing In his breast and the thought of
cowardly revenge uppermost in his
diseased mind, George Benes. a young
Swiss electrician, sought the life of his
young and pretty wife in the cellar of
the Humboldt Lodging-house, 1309
Stockton street, at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning. After firing a bullet into
the back of the woman, Benes turned
the weapon upon himself, but the
courage he was so long in summoning
failed him at the last moment and his
effort at suicide resulted in a slight
wound of the throat. The llfeblood of
the woman is slowly ebbing away at
the Harbor Hospital, and It is a mat
ter of but a short time when, the phy
sicians say, her sufferings will be re
lieved by the cold hand of death.
Behind the cowardly deed lies a tale
of a wife's long suffering and a hus
band's heartless brutality. A girl yet
In her teens, the unfortunate victim
met and fell in love with the man who
was base enough to seek her life.
They were married last January in Los
Angeles and ere the honeymoon had
waned the husband commenced to
maltreat his girl wife, forcing her to
keep him supplied with funds, which
she earned by her labors.
Many times she threatened to for
sake him. but not until two. months
ago did she carry out her Intention.
Then she left him. . He sought her out.
but she was firm in her refusal to re
turn to him and when he at last saw
that persuasion was â¢ useless he re
solved to have her- life and then end
his own.
With his mind fully made up to
carry out his plan, Benes came to this
city from Los Angeles last Saturday
and at once sought an interview with
his wife at the Humboldt Hotel, where
she was employed as a cook. The
woman told the proprietors; of the
place how she feared the man . and
begged of .them not to - allow him to
entCr " HIDES IX BASEMENT.
He was â¢ refused â¢ admission to the
.hotel and left. the place at once. This
morning a â¢ few. minutes before. 6
o'clock he stole Into the hotel and
hid in the basement till his wife ar
rived. He' boldly confronted her and
asked her to return to him. She said:
"I will have nothing more to do with

Then the enraged man pulled _ a 38

Mary Margaret Coleman, three years
and seven months old. daughter of Mrs.
Coleman of E24 Third street, died at
4:25 yesterday morning, and at the
mother's reauest Coroner Leland or
dered an investigation. Mrs. Coleman
informed Deputy Coroner Brown that
on November 2 sire took her little girl
to Mrs. Fisher's house, 6 Welsh street,
and while there Mary Fisher. 11 years
old, took Mary Coleman behind an easel
or a screen ar.d caused her to inhale
poisonous fumes. On the evening of
that day a few hours later the Cole
man girl was taken seriously ill and
the mother called In Dr. Dickson, whose
office is on Third street, near Bryant.
Mrf. Coleman said that Dr. Dickson
had expressed the opinion that the child
had inhaled the fumes of some poison
ous drug-. The child's condition becom
ing: worse. Dr. H. B. Kilbourn of 551.
Third street "was called in and attended
her until she died. The matter was
reported to the police and Detective Ed
ward Gibson was detailed to make an
investigation. â¢
Dr. Kilbourn was asked yesterday as
to his opinion concerning the cause of
the little one's death, and he expressed
the opinion positively tTiat the disease
was tubercular meningitis, "a disease
very common among children living
eouth of Market street, where the air
and ventilation are bad," he added. Dr.
Dickson, the first physician called In,
informed Deputy. Coroner McCormlck
that he had diagnosed the case as one
Â«'f stomach trouble, and denied emphat
ically that he had ever told the mother
that the child had been poisoned.
An autopsy performed at the Morgue
last evening by Dr. Bacigalupi showed
that death had resulted from cerebral
tubercular meningitis, which disposes
of the suspicion entertained by Mrs.
Coleman that her child had died from
the inhalation of poisonous fumes.
The detective department Is investi
gating: a daring daylight burglary that
occurred in the apartments of Miss B.
Kearns at 411 A Van Ness avenue last
Briday afternoon. The burglars en
tered the front door with the aid of a
"Jimmie" and made their escape with
Jewelry and gems valued at $600. Miss
Kearns was absent when the crime
was comitted. . Â« t
The building in which the burglary
occurred is a five-story apartment-,
house and there is a separate front'
entrance for each floor. The crooks
in forcing the door, took daring
chances of being discovered, as people
were passing in and out of the place
at all hours during the day. Miss
Kearns and a friend started out shop
ping early in the and did
not return until nearly 6 o'clock in
the evening. When they walked into
the place they discovered everything
in disorder. Bureau drawers had
been pulled out and their contents
searched and everything of value
taken. ; .
Two diamond rings, a pair of pearl
earrings, a pearl studded breastpin
and two Jeweled breastpins . were
among the most costly of the things
taken. Miss Kearns also lost a quan
tity of silverware, several gold rings
and a hunting-case gold watch.
The captain of detectives was Im
mediately notified and detailed two of
his men to visit the premises. After
a thorough search they are convinced
that the crime was the work of ex-
perts and that a gang of bold daylight
burglars is operating in the city. The
pawnshops are being watched for the
recovery of the stolen property.
