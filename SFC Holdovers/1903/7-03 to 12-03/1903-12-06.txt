"Bah:" eaid he: and with that he
whistled for his troopers; and while we
looked, my dear lady and her tire
?ivomari were helped upon their horses,
and at the leader's word of command the
escort fcrraed upon the captives as a
center. A moment later the little gladn.

lodge Cre to prick out Its limits in dusky
red, was rmpty. and on the midnight
stillness of the forest the minlshing
hoofbeats of th* hcrsss came fair.tpr and
falrter till the distance swallowed them.
Then it was that my poor lad. famine
mad and frenzied, rose up to curse me
bitterly.
'Now may all the devils in hell drag
you down to everlasting torments. John
Ireton, for your cold-hearted caution that
made us lose when we had good hope
to win!" he crlei "One little hour I
begged for.' and that hour had fought
her battle and eet her free. But now â "
He broke off in the tntrtst. choking
with what miserable despair I knew, and
shared as well; and throwing himself
down In the wot grass, he would eke out
the bitter words upon such ravings and
Robbings as bubble up in sheer aban
donment of rage end misery.

mimic etare of the romances that the

in their lines nor, betraying by slip or

humankind. Being mere mortals,, we
were not so endowed; we were but four
It was as grim a picture aa any limner
of the weird could wish ' to look upon.
The twilight shadows were empurpling
the mountains and gathering in dusky
pools here and there where the trees
stood thickest in the valley. The hush of
nature's mystic hour was abroad, and
even the swiftly flowing river, rushing
sullenly along its rocky bed no more than
a stone's cast beyond the Indian path,
seemed to intermit its low thundeiings.
There was never a breath of air astir in
all the wood, and the leaves of the silver
poplar that will twinkle and ripple In th*
lightest zephyr hung stark and motion
less.
Barring the old borderer, who had gono
upon his knees, we stood as we were;

' The hooe was dashed on the instant by
the sudden snorting and shying. of two or
three of tho horses In passing. . and wÂ«
laid bold of our weapons, keying our
selves to the fighting pitch. But, curi
ously enough, the riders made no move*
to pry Into the cause. So far from it. they
flogged the shying ponies Into line and
rode on stolidly: and thus in a little timo
that danger was overpast and the eventnc
silence of the mighty forest was ours to
keep or break as we chose.
The old frontiersman was the first to
Â¦peak.
"Well, friends. I reckon ez how we
mought ez well thank the good Lord for
all his marcles afore we go any furder."
he would say. and he doffed his cap and
did it forthwith. '^
So you are to conceive us waiting with
nerves upstrung. ready for fight or flight,
as the event should decide, stifling in
such pent-up suspense as any or all of ais
would " gladly have exchanged for the
fiercest battle. Happily, the breath-seant
scantfng interval was short. From be
hind our thicket screen we presently saw
a file of Indian horsemen riding at a
leisurely footrace down the path.
Ephraim Yeates quickly named these
newcomers for us.
Luckily for us the new danger was ap
proaching from the westward. So. by
dint of the maddest hurryings we got
the bodies of the three Cherokees hoist
upon the horee3. and were able to efface
In part the signs of the late encounter
before the band of. riders coming down

was , no time to make an orderly retreat.
At most we could only withdraw a little
way into the wood, halting when we were
well in cover. and;hastlly stripping coats
and waistcoats to muffle the heads of the

was no practicable horse path leading
down from the plateau. . , _ ' :
As for the hunter and Richard, they
had made a discovery which might stand
for what It' /was worth. At its lower ex

from, the: great gorge "without only; by.' a ;
ridge which was no more than a i huge
dam and this diking | ridge was evidently
tunneled by the stream, since the latter
had no visible outlet." "" '^ "â¢ ' ''

Since we must examine closely every
rift and crevice in the boundary cliff, it
was a most tedious undertaking, and I do

a; wincing agony. They say an army

So when we had breathed us a little
the circuiting was begun, Ephraim
Yeates and Jennifer going toward the

"Ez I allow, that's Jest what the good

HOW UNCANOOLA TRAPPED THE

: Uncanoola shook his ' ' head. "Heap

down, no acoss over, 1 no go back. Mebbe
go up like smokeâ w'at?" :
As we made sure, we left no stone un
turned In the effort to solve the mystery.
No horse, ridden or led, could have lived
to cross the pouring torrent of the main
river or to wade up or down its bed, and
If the cavalcade had turned up the bar
rier stream Its progress must have ended
abruptly against the sheer wall of the
cliff at tho entrance of tho low-arched
cavern whence the tributary came into
being. But if Falconnet and his following
had ridden neither up nor down the bed
of the barrier stream. It seemed equally
certain that no horse of tho troop had
crossed It The Indian trace, which held
straight on up the gorge and presently
came out above into a high upland valley,
was unmarked by any hoof print, new or.
old. Â¦-.- Â¦'-Â¦:'
. On each hand the mountains rose pre
cipitous, the one on the left swelling un
broken to a bald and rounded summit,
forest covered save for its tonsured head
high in air, while that on the right was
Bteeper and lower, with a line of cliffs at
the top. As we fared on the valley nar
rowed to a mere chasm, with the river
thundering along the base of the ton
sured mountain and the Indian path
bugging the cliff on the right.
In the gloomiest depths of this defile we
came 1 upon the hunter's stumbling block.
A tributary stream, j Issuing from a low
cavern In the right-hand cliff, crossed the
Indian path and the chasm at, a bound
and' plunged noisily into the flood of the
larger river. On the hither side of thi3
barrier stream the trail of the powder
convoy led plainly down' Into â¢ the water,
and, so far as one might see, that was
the end of It.
Here was a fresh complication and one
that called for instant action. We had
counted upon a battle royal in any at
tempt to rescue the women, but that'Fal
connet. Impeded as he was by the slow
movements of the powder cargo, could
slip away, was a contingency for which
we were wholly unprepared.
So, as you would guess, the hunter
breakfast was hurriedly dispatched, and
by the time the sun was shoulder high
over the 1 eastern hills we had broken
camp and crossed the river and were
pressing forward to the gorge of disap
pearance.
say. His first discovery w.is that the
ford we had found in the darkness served
as the river crossing of an ancient and
well-used Indian trace. Along this trace
from the eastward the powder train had
come, no longer ago than mid-afternoon
of yesteroay; and arguing from this that
the night camp of the band would be
but a short march to the westward
Yeates had pushed on to fee! out the en
emy's position.
For a mile or more beyond the ford he
had trdiled the convoy easily. The Indian
trace or path, well trampled by the nu
merous horses of the cavalcade, followed
the up-stream windings of the swift river
straight Into tho eye of the western
mountains. But in the eye Itself, a rocky
defile where the slopes on each hand be
came frowning battlements to narrow val
ley and stream, the one to a darkling
gorge, the other to a thundering torrent,
the trail was lost as completely as if the
powder convoy had vanished Into thin
air. Â» .
outwearled men, well spent in the long
chase, with never a leg among us fit to
pace a sentry beat nor a decent: wakeful
eye to keep it company. So, as I have
said, we took the risk. and slept;' would
have slept soundly.' I dare say, had the
risk been twice as great.
We were astir at the earliest graying
of the dawn. Richard and I. and were the
laggards of tho company at that,' since
the old hunter wi^s alreadyout and away
and the Indian /had kindled a fire and
was grinding more of the parched corn
for the morning m<?al. Ephralm Yeates
at that moment returned with.the,.hind
quarters of a fine yearling buck, fresh
kijled. across his shoulders.
Seeing the deer's meat, we would think
the old hunter's thrift of the dawn suffi
ciently accounted for; but when the cuts
were a-broil- we wenjTnade to know that"
the buqk was merely a lucky incident in
the early morning scouting.
Taking time by the forelock, the old
borderer had swept a circle of reconnais
sance around our haltinp place, "to get
the'p'ints of the compass," aa he would

. The old hunter postponed his prayerful
motion, ; most reluctantly, as -it would
seem, and led ' the' way J in ; a" silent with
drawal from the dangerous neighborhood
of the ambushment. When wo had pushed

there was a halt for a council of war. r :
Here death lay in' wait for us In. the
mad plunsings of the main river, but we
made shift; to catch at the overhanging
branches of the willows In passing, to
draw ourselves out, to scramble up the
gorge and to gain a great boulder on the
mountainside whence' we could look
down upon the scene of our late surprisal.
By this wo saw, from the wings, as it
were, the setting of the stage for a trag
edy which miir'rtt have been ours.- 'One
by "one a score of heads with painted
faces floated silently out of the spewing
rock-mouth. One by one the glistening,
bronze-red : , bodies appertaining thereto
emerged from the water, each to take
its place in an ambuscade inclosing the
stream-crossing of the Indian path in .a
pocketlike line of crouching ftgurea. with
the mouth of tho pocket, open toward. the
lower valley.
Ephraim Yeates chuckled under - his
breath and smote softly upon his thigh.
."They tell ez how the good Lord has a

low-arched cavern whence the stream is

'Twas the old borderer who took the in
itiative in the swift retreat, and we fol
lowed his lead like well-drilled soldiers.

the grassy savannas by the stream, so
fairly beneath us that the smallest . can

dropped a shot into it, was the camp of
the powder train.
The old borderer took his bearings by
the sun and laid the course of quartering
to bring' us out as near as might be on

fell in line once more, and being so for
tunate as to hit upon a ravine which led
to the cliff-crowned summit, the climb
was shorn of half of Its toil and diffi
culty. Nevertheless, by the sun's height
it was well on In the forenoon before; we
came out, perspiring like sappers in a
steam bath, upon the mountain top.
; As Yeates* had guessed,' this northern
mountain 'proved to be a lofty table-land.
So far as could be seen the summit was
an undulating plain, less densely forested
â¢than the valley, but with a thick sprink
ling of pines to make tho still, hot air
heavy with their resinous fragrance. As.lt
chanced, our. ravine of ascent headed
well back from the cliff edge, so we must

Ephralm Yeates was up In. a twinkling,
dragging us back from the cliff edge.
"Up with ye!" he cried. "Now's our

Thus said the old borderer, and being
only too eager to come 'to handgrips
with the enemy we were up and running
faster than ever Joab's messenger ran.
long before the old man finished with
his Scriptural simile. . -___
Not to take the risk of delay on ai?y
unexplored short cut we made straight
for the ravine of our ascent, found It as
by unerring instinct, and Were presently
racing down to Â¦' the Indian trace in the
little upland valley above the gorge.
For all the helter-skelter v- haste I
fpund time to remember that the gorge
as we had last seen it had been well
besprinkled with armed Cherokees lying
in wait for us. If they were still there
we should be â¢ likely, to â have a hot wel
come; and some Â¦ reminder of this I
gasped out to Yeates 'in'mld-flight.'
"Ne'm mind that; if we run up ag'inst
'em anywhere, 'twon't be there-away.
They've took the hint and quit;.scat
tered out to hunt us long ago," was his
answer. Jerked out between bounds. And
after I had loosed the Ferrara In its
sheath and saved my breath as I might
for the killing business of the moment.
'Twas a sharp disappointment that, for
all the haste of our mad scramble down
the mountain we were too late to sur
prise the. secret of the enemy's strong
hold. The Catawba was leading when
we dashed down Into the valley, and one
.glance sent him flying back to stop us
short with a dumb show purporting that
the quarry was already out of the defile
and coming up the Indian path.
- .Richard swore grievously, but the old
backwoodsman took the checkmate pla
cidly and began to set the pieces for the
second game in which the horses were
the stake, hiding his useless rifle. In a
hollow tree â his powder had been soaked
and spoiled in the. early morning plunge
for life â and drawing his-' hunting knife
tp feel its . edge and | point. Â¦'
"Ez I allow, that fetches us to the hoss
lifting." he said, in his slow arawl. Then
he laid his commands upon us. "Ord'ly
and In" sojer-fasliloh, now no whooping

You are not to suppose that he was
holding . us Inactive ; while he thus ex
horted us. . On the contrary, he was post

disadvantageâ that since the enemy was
close ' at " hand we dared ' not cross the
path to : give our trap a Jaw on either,
side. To offset this, the Catawba dropped

From what could be seen 'twas clear
that the camp was no mere bivouac for
the day; Indeed, the Englishmen were
still working upon their pine-bough shel
ters, building themselves in as if for a
stay indefinite.
. "'Tis a rest camp." quoth Dick,
"though why they should break the
march here is more than I can guess."
At first we sought in vain for the stor
ing-place of the powder. It was the
sharp eyes of the Catawba that finally
descried It. A rude housing of pine
boughs, like the huts of the troopers,
had been built at the base of a large
boulder on the opposite bank of the
stream; and here was the lading of the
powder train.

more peering down at the enemy's camp.
Though | for the cliff-shadowed valley It
was long past sunset arid all the depths
were blue and purple in the changing
half-lights of the' hour, the shadow veil
was but a gauze of color, softening the
details without obscuring them. So^ we
could mark well the metes and bounds of
the camp and prick in all the items. .
The camp field was the 'largest of the
savannas or natural clearings. 1 On the
margin of the stream the . Indian lodges
were pitched in a semicircle to face the
water. Farther back Falconnet's troop
was hutted In rough-and-ready shelters
made, of pine boughsâ these disposed to
stand between the camp of the Cherokees
and. the tepee-lodge of the captive women,
which stood among the trees in that
edge of the forest hemming; the slope
which buttressed our cliff of observation.

But now Ephralm Yeates. standing ear
a-cock and motionless, like some grim

with a sudden "Hist, will ye!" and a

work to do.
While yet this most merciless deed
was a-doing. the Catawba bounded to his
feet and made sure of the horses, which
were rearing: and snorting: with affright.
That done, he must needs gloat, Indian

and when the Englishman's = next stride

his sword's point at his throat.

"Mayhap," I admitted. "But yet â " :

they look." (
He nodded, and we backed away, to
make another circuit which fetched us
out on the up-valley side of the encamp
ment Here we could look, down into
a smaller glade or bottom meadow on
the stream where the horses of the band
were cropping bush grass. It was the
sight of these and of Margery's black
mare among them that set me thinking
of a plckeerlng venture to the full as
harebrained as that from which I had
but now dissuaded Richard Jennifer.
"We- shall need another mount and
Mistress Margery's saddle," I said. "Lie
you. close here whilst I play, the horse
thief on these reavers."
Â¦. So, having first gagged the poor devil
with his own neckerchief, we stripped
him quickly; and I as quickly donned the
borrowed uniform and became, at least in
outward semblance, a light-horse trooper
of that king whose service I had once for
sworn. â¢ ; The items of small-clothes,

fair afoot In the enemy's camp.
"Bay, quick! what to do with him.
Jack?' he demanded when I came up;
and now my-' slower wit came into play.
"Out of this to some safer dressing
room, and I'll show you," said I; and
forthwith we marched our prize up the
valley a long musket-shot or more.
When the soldier had leave to speak

would guess; but we gave him a short

"Ho," Jack Warden!" he called, making
a speaking trumpet of his hands to lift
the hail above the chanting of the Indian
dancers. "Have a look at that shelter
whilst you are over, there and make sure
'twill shed rain' if the weather shifts," '
On the bare hillside beneath the pow
der magazine I made no doubt I was in
plainest view from the great fire, and
the proof of this conclusion came shortly
in a bellowing hail from Falconnet
From the hillside just below tnls pow
der rock I could look back upon the camp
en enfilade, as an artilleryman would
say. Nearest at hand was the half-moon
of Indian lodges with the hollow of the
crescent facing the stream, and a cal
dron fire burning in the midst. Around
the fire a ring of warriors naked to the
breech-clout kept time in a slow shuf
fling dance to a monotonous chanting;
and for onlookers there was an outer
ring of squatting figures â the visiting
Tuckaseges, as I supposed.
Beyond the Indian lodges, and a little
higher up the gentle slope of the savan
na, were the troop shelters; and beyond
these, half concealed in the fringing of
the boundary forest, was the tepee lodge
of the women. .
"What say you. Jack? Shall we rush
them? There's naught else for it." And
then, with a gritting oatn: "Oh. damn
this cursed chilling:"
I whispered bacK that we would wait
till he was better fit. He was loth to
admit the necesity. but as it chanced,
the momentary delay saved our lives in
that strait. While we paused, hugging
the shadows in the crooking elbow, the
gloomy dÂ«?pths beyond the Sentries were
suddenly starred with flaring flambeaux
lightir.g the way for a hasting rabble of
savages; and had we been entangled in
the struggle with the two sentinels we
should have been taken red-handed.
As it was. we had to make the quick
est play to save ourselves. In the same
breath we both remembered the narrow
eid^ passage Just behind in which we
were nigii to losing our way. and into
this we plunged, reckless of possible pit
falls. We were no more than safely out
of the main corridor when the runners,
some score of them, as we guessed,
trooped past our covert in full cry. leav
ing us half smothered in the smoky trail
of their pitch-pine flambeaux.
"Now what a-devil has set this hor
net's nest of theirs abuzz bo suddenly?".
I whispered, when the smoke-choke gave
us liberty to speak without coughing to
betray ourselves.
"Our pony-riding Tuckaseges. doubt
less." was Richard's ready answer. "By
all the chances, they should have met
the Great Bear and his peace-offering out
yonder on the trace â which same they
did not. So when they bring this tale to
camp there is the devil to pay and no
pitch hot. God help our tough old
Ephraim and the Catawba if these blood
hounds win out in time to overtake
them'"
"Aye." said I: and then we crept out
of the dodge-hole and made ready to go
about our business with the sentries.
But when we came to peer again
around the crooking elbow it would seem
that the hurrying search party had
fought our battle for us. The watch lire
was there to light a little circle in the
gloom, but the watchers were Rone. We
chanced a guess that they had joineu the
hue and cry. and so we- pressed forward,
past the handful of embers and into the
pit-black depths beyond.
Twenty "paces further on it came to
playing blind man's buff with the rocky
walls again, and measured by the trip
pings and stumblings 'twas a long Sab
bath day's journey to that final turn in
thi great earth-burrow whence we could
se? the glimmering of the enemy's camp
fires in the sunken valley.
"Now God be praised!" quoth Richard
most fervently. "Another hour In this
cursed kennel" with the fever on me and
I should be a yammering loose-wit And
I. too. was glad enough to see the stars
again, and to be at large beneath them.
Emerging from the subterranean way.
we held to the camp side of the stream"
making an ample circuit to the left to
come down upon the enemy s position from
the wooded slope behind the encamp
ment We met no let or hindrance, in
this approach. Secure in their strong
hold, the Indians had no patroU out; and
as for the Englishmen, every mother's
?on of them, it seemed, was basking in
the light of a great fire built before the
pine-bought shelters.
Favored by a dense thlcketing of laurel,
we made a near-hand reconnaissance of
the little wipwam which held our dear
lady. As I have 'said, this was pitched
in the thinning of the forest which cov
ered the steep slope behind the encamp
ment and so P was P th* farthest removed
from the stream, and from the Indian
lodges disposed in a half-moon at the
water's edge. Here all was quiet as the
crave, and the clamor of the Indian
camp came softened by the distance to a
low monotonous humming like the buz
zing of a beehive. The Hap Â°* .I"* 8 * 6 ?**
lodge was closely drawn and the Wt of

of white-ashed embers. , â,Â»...
"They are safe as yet. thank God.
says Richard, heaving a most palpable
sigh of relief. Then, with the fever in
his veins to whip his natural ardor into
hasty action: "'Twill be hours before
Eph and the Catawba can come in by
your upper ravine. Jack, and we shall
never have . a better chance than % this.
Hold you quiet here, whilst I â '
But I laid fast hold of him and would
not hear to any such a foolhardy mar
ring of Ephraim Yeate's plan.
â¢'Heavens, boy! are you gone clean
mad?" I would say. V 'Twill be risky
enough with midnight in our favor; with
the camp well asleep, and that great
fire burned down to give us something
less than broad daylight to work in!'"
He turned upon me like a pettish
child. "Oh. to the devil with your stum
bling-blocks. John Ireton! You are al
ways for holding back. By heaven! I'll
6wear you have no drop of lover s blood
in your veins!"
"So you have said before. But let that
pass; we must bide by our promise to
Yeates. which was not to interfere un
less Margery stood in present peril.
Moreover, we should learn the lay of the
land better while we have the firelight
to help. When Â¦ the time for action
comes we must be able to make the play
with our eyes shut if need be. Come."
'Twas like pulling sound teeth to get
him away, but he yielded at length and
we crept on to have some better sight
of the troop camp. We had it; had a
glimpse of the Baronet-captain playing
loo with his. lieutenant and another. The
tableau at the fire gave us better cour
age. The men had laid their arms aside
and were sprawling at their ease; and
while the arch scoundrel was . in the
gaming mood Margery had less to fear
from him.
I said as much to Dick, , and for an
swer he pointed to the flask of usque
baugh which was at that moment mak
ing the round of the loop layers.
"I know Frank Falconnet better than
you do. Jack, for I have known him
later. He is all kinds of a villain sober,
but he is a fiend incarnate with Â¦Â« the
liquor in him. 'Tls lucky we are here.
If- he. do but drink enough Margery la
like to have need â "
"Hist!" said I; some of these loung-
. Dick pressed closer to me, and I could
feel him drinking in deep draughts of
the grateful outer air.
"What new wonder Is thisT" he would
ask. with something akin to awe in his
voice; but we must needs grope this way
and that to feel out the answer with our
finger tips.
When the answer was found, the mys
tery of the lost trail was solved most
simply.' As we made out, we were in a
deep crevice cut crosswise by the stream,
which, issuing from a yawning cavern
In the farther wall, was quickly engulfed
again by that lower archway' we had Just
traversed. In some -. upheaval of- the
earthquake age a huge slice of the moun
tain's face had split off and settled away
from the parent cliff to leave a deep
cleit open to the sky.- One end of this
crevice chasm â that toward the upland
valley â was choked and filled by the de
bris of later landslides, but tne lower
fn>i was open.
Through this lower end, as we made
no doubt, the powder train had come,
turning from the Indian path in the
gorge up the bed of the barrier stream,
turning again at the outer cavern muutu
to squeeze in single tile between the
thickly matted undergrowth and the
cliff's face, and so to pass around the
split-off mass and come into the crevice
rift.
how the sharp eyes of the old hunter,
and those of the Catawba as well, had
missed the rinding of this squeezing
place where the cavalcade had left the
utream bed, wo could never guess; but
on the chance that we might yet need to
know all the crooks and turnings of this
outlet we felt our way quite around the
masking cliff and down to the stream's
edge In the gorge.
That done we were ready for a farther
advance, and clambering back into the
crevice we once more too* the stream for
"our guide and were presently deep in the
natural tunnel piercing the mountain
proper. This extension of the subter
ranean waterway proved to be a noble
cavern, wide ana high enough to pass a
loaded wain, as we determined by toss
ing pebles against the arching roof. None
the less, 'twas full of crooks and wind-
Ings; and in the saarpest elbow of them
all. where we were like to lose our way
by blundering Into one of the many
branching side passages, Richard stopped
me with a hand thrust back.
"Softly!" he cautioned; "here are their
vedettes!"
Just beyond the crooking elbow the
dull red glow from a tiny fire gone to
coals showed us two Indian sentries*set
to keep the pass. Dick drew his clay
more, but he was chilling again, and tne
hand that grasped the yreat blade was
shaking as with a palsy. Yet he would
mutter, as the teetn-chatterlng suffered
him:

sight and sound and breath went out to
gether, and I was but an atom crushed
to earth beneath the human avalanche.
"Make the round again and tell the
men 'twill be ten gold Joes and a double
allowance of liquor to the man who first
Â¦claps eyes on any one of the four."
â¢ The subaltern went to carry out t$Â»
order.' arid Falconnet fell to pacing back,
and forth the little wigwam. I
could see his face at tne turn where the
firelight fell upon him; 'twas the face
' of a villain at his worst, namely, a vil
lain half in liquor. There was 'a lurk
ing devil of pas3ion peering out of tho
sensuous eyes; and ever and anon he
'stopped as to listen for some sound with
in the captives' lodge.
When the lieutenant returned to make
his report, he was given another order to
cap the first
"Your line is, too close drawn and too
conspicuous," said the captain shortly.
"Move the men out fifty paces in ad
vance, and bid them take cover."
"They will scarce bo within hail of
each other at that." says the lieutenant.
"Near enough, with ten gold pieces to
sharpen their eyesight. Go you with
them and hold them to their work."
The line was presently extended as
the order ran. each link in the cordon
chain advancing fifty paces on its front
into the forest. Dick fetched a deep
sigh of relief; and I thought less of the
thin-leafed cover and the scarlet coat of
me.
Falconnet had resumed the pacing of
his sentry beat before the lodge, but
when his men were out of sight and
hearing he stopped "short and stole on
tiptoe to lay his ear to the flap.
"So you are awake. Miss Margery?
Send your woman out. I would speak
with youâ alone."
There was no reply, but wÂ» could both
hear the low. anguished voice of our
dear lady praying for help in this her
hour of trial. Dick inched aside to givÂ«
me room, freeing his weapon, as I did
mine. We were not overqulet about It,
but the captain of horse "was too hot
upon his own devil's business to look

Having no answer from within, hÂ»

down on the inside. He arose and whip

been the face of a foul fiend from the
pit
"Open!" he commanded; and when
there was neither reply nor obedience hÂ»

it back. Â«V
The two women within the wigwam

the swordsman fighting for his lifeâ a
face in which the hot flush of evil pas

Ing of fear.
We drove at him together, Dick and I.
and so must needs fall afoul of each
other clumsily, giving him time to spring
back and so miss the claymore stroke
which else would have shorn him to the
middle. Then eniued as pretty a pieco
of blade work as any master of the old
cut-and-thrust school could wish to see:
and through It all this king's captain ct 4

There was no punctilio of the code nf
honor in this duel a 1'outrance. Knowing
our time was short we fought as men
who flsrht with halters round their necks:
not to decide a nice point at issue, but
to kill this accursed villain as we would

whose living on Imperiled the life and
honor of the woman we loved.
Thrice, while I held him in play, Dick
rushed In to end it with a scythe-sweep
of the broadsword; and thrice the Scot

striving shrewdly to gain time made shift

Ing mob of Cherokeesâ the detachment
.we had met in the cavern returned in
the very nick of time to cut us off from
the pursuit and to ring us In a whooping
circle of death.
"Back to back, lad!" I shouted; and
I here confess to you. my dears, that,
had I loved my sweet lady less, no earth
ly power could have driven me into that
dismal stifling place. All my life long I
have had a most unspeakable horror of
low-roofed caverns and squeezing pas-
Bases that cramp a man for breath and
for the room to draw it in; and when the
suffocating madness came upon me, as it
did when we were well jammed In this
cursed horror-hole, I was right glad to
have my love for Margery to make an
outward eeemlng man of me; glad, too,
that my dear lad was close behind to
shame me Into going on.
Yet. after all. the passage through the
throat of the rock dragon was vastly
more terrifying than difficult. Once well
â¢within the closely <lrawn upper lip we
could brace our backs against the roof
an" so have a purchase for the foothold.
Better still, when we had passed a pike's
length beyond the lip the breathing space
above the water grew wider and higher
till at length we could stand erect and
come abreast to lock arms and push on
Bide by side.
From that the etrea.ra broadened and
grew shallower with every step, and pres
ently we could bear it on ahead babbling
over the etones like any peaceful wood
land brook. Then suddenly the dank and
noisome air of the cavern gave place to
the pine-scented breath of the forest; and.
looking straight up, we could see the

the gurgling throat of the spewing rock
monster.
â¢â¢No." said he. stubbornly. "Walt but
a minute and the fever will be on me;
then 1 shall be fighting-fit for anything
that comes."
So we waited, and I could hear his teeth
clicking like castanets. Having had a
tertian fever more than once in the Turk
ish campaigning. I had a fellow-feeling
for the i>oor lad. knowing well how the
thought of a p'unge into cold water
â¢would make him shrink.
In a little time he felt for my hand and
grsÂ»5p*d it.
"I'm warm enough now. In all con
eciojice." be e&M. and â¢with that we
slipped ir.to the stream.
'Twas n disaprKiintrnent of the grateful
sort to find the water no more than mld
thi>rh de*r>. The current was swift and
strong, but with the pebbly bottom to
give pood footing 'twas possible to stem
it slowly. laying hold of each other for
the letter breast of the flood we felt our
way warily to the middle of the pool; felt
for tho low-epruns cavern arch, and for
that scanty lifting of ft where we hoped
to find head room between stone above
and stream below.
"As ready as a man with a shaking
ague can be," he gritted out. "This dog's
work we have been doing of late has
brought my old curse upon me and I am
like to rattle rny teeth loose."
"Let me go alone, then. Another cold
plunge may be the death of you."
So taid the old backwoodsman : but nei
ther Dick nor I would agree to this in'
toto. Dick argued that while we were
killing time in the roundabout advance
Tre should be leaving Margery wholly at
the mercy of the Baronet, and that every
hour of delay was full of hideous menace
to her. Hence he proposed that three
of us should carry out the hunter's
plan, leaving the fourth to take the
hint given by the charred stick
and the swimming ambush crew, and
bo penetrating to the valley by the stream
cavern, be at hand to strike a blow for
our dear lady's honor In case of need.
" 'Tis a thing to be done, and I am with
you. Dick." said I. This was before Eph
raim Yeates could object. "Should there
be need for any, two blades will be better
than one. If it comes to blows and we
are kitted or taken, Yeates and the chief
must make the shift to do without our
help."
As you would guess, the old hunter de
murred to this halving: of our slender
fore*, but we overpersuaded him. If all
went well, we were to rendezvous on the
scene of action to carry out the plan of
rescue. But if our adventure should prove
disastrous, Yeates and Uncanoola were to
bide their time, striking in when and how
they might.
Touching this contingency, I drew the
o!d man aside for a word in private.
"If ought befall us, Ephraimâ if we
should be nabbed as we are like to beâ
you are not to let any hope of helping us
lessen by a feather's weight the rescue
chant* of the women. You'll promise me
this?"
"Sarlain sure; ye can rest easy on that,
C&p'n John. But don't ye go for to let
that rampaging boy of our'n upsot the fat

He's '.ovesick. he Is; and there ain't noth
tnjj'n this world so ridic'lous foolish Â«a
lovesick boyâ less'n 'tis a lovesick gal."
I premised on my part and so we went
our separate ways in the gathering dark
ness; though not until the lashings of
the racks had been cut and the powder
and lead, pave fuch Epoil of both as Eph
rahTi Yeates a.nd Uncanoola would re
serve, tad been errilled into the river. As
for the bodies of the dead Indians, the
old hunter said he would let them ride
til! hÂ» should come to some convenient
cha?m for a sepulcher; but I mistrusted
that he and the Catawba would scalp and
leavt them, once we were safely out of
sis l>".
At the Darting we took the river's edge
for St. Richard and 1. keeping well under
tlie l:ar.k and working our way cautiously
down the gorge until we were stopped by
the pouring cross-torrent of the under
ground tributary. Here we turned short
to the left along the margin of the bar
rier stream, and tracing Its course across
th*> rrorc<Â». came presently to the northern
cliff at the lip of the spewing cavern
mouth.
But now the night was fully come and
in the wooded defile we could place ous
sclves only- by the sense of touch. :-.;"Â¦Â¦
"Are you ready, Dick?" said I.
Hi? face, commonly a leather mask to
hide the man behind it, was now ablaze
with the fire of zealotry; and. truly, In
these, hlÂ« Fpasm-flts of supplication, he
stood for all that is most awe-Inspiring
and unnerving, asking but a little stretch
of the Imagination to figure him as one
of those old iron-hard prophets of denun
ciation come back to earth to be herald of
the wrath of God.
'Twas close upon actual nightfall when
the eld. man rose from his knees and. with
the rMr.g. put off the beadsman and put
on the Ehrewd old Indian fighter. Fol
lowed some hurried counselings as to how
we should proceed, and in these the hun
ter f.et the pace for us as his age and vast
experience in woodcraft gave him leave.
His plan had all the merit of simplicity.
Now that we had the horses, Richard's
notion of an approach from the head of
the sunken valley became at once the
most hopeful of any. So Ephraim Yeates
proposed that we betake ourselves to the
mountain top and to the head of that ra
vine which the Catawba and I had dis
covered. Here we should leave the horses
veil hidden and secured, make our way
down the ravine and, with the stream for
a guide, follow the sunken valley to the
camp at Its lower end. Once on the
ground without having given the alarm,
we might hope to free the captives under
cover of the darkness; and our retreat
up the valley would be far less hazardous
than any open flight by way of the unex
plored rea<i the rÂ»owder train had used.

the pommel of that saddle which bore the
trunk of the five-feathered chieftain, Un

its sca.l<>-lock~ to dangle and roll about
with every restless movement of the
horse a hideous death-mask that seemed
to mop end mow and stare fearsomely at
us with its wide open glassy eyes.
With this background fit for the stag

striving with might and main to gain
the laurel thicket whence we had made
our first* reconnolssance before the con
verging ilnes of the redcoat cordon
should close and shut us out.
We did it by the skin of our teeth,
diving to cover through the closing gap
not a second too soon. When we were
in and hugging the bare ground under
the scanty ' leafing of laurel. I take no
shame in saying that I would have given
a king's ransom to be at large again.
Had there been but one of us the, covert
would have been cramped enough; and I
was "painfully "conscious that my bor
rowed coat of sear let was but a poor
thing, to' hide in. .
To , make it worse, . Falconnet, who
had lagged behind /at . the fire, was now
heaping fresh fuel r on, and this reviving
of the blaze made the place as light as
day. -^ With : the nearest links in the red
coat chain no more than a pike's length
at our ; backs', : we dared not - stir or
breathe a word; and. all in all, w*. might
have been \ taken like rats in a trap had
any one of the sentries â¢ on our. side of
the circle" chanced to look behind him.
Having repaired the fire to his liking,
the- troop captain came up to- pass a
word or two with his lieutenant. They
spoke guardedly together, but we could
hear â could not help hearing.
"You have seen nothing, Gordon 7"
"Nothing, as yet"
"Good-by, Jack; go while you can.
You'll be liko to meet Eph and Catawba
coming in. Turn them back and tell them
to bide their time."
"But. you 7* I would say.
"My place is inside of that soldier
cordon. our friend is drawing about his
dove-cote. I shall be at* hand when she
needs me, as I promised."
"Aye, so you may be; but not alone;"
While we looked the Cherokees scat
tered like a company of trained gillies
to beat us out of cover; and when the
hunt was fairly up the baronet-captain
set hi* men in marching order to sur
roun.l the wiswam of the captives.
As yet there Â¦. was tlnie for a swift
retreat up the valley, or at least for the
choosing of Fonio battlefield of our own
where, the enemy need not outnumber us
twenty to one; and again I urged Richard
to bestir himself. But it was the sight
of Fnlconnet'a troops deploying to sur
round tho tepee-lodge, and not any word
of mine, that broke his merriment In the
midst.
At a bound he was up and handing me
my sword. BQSHKHHBHh *
My plan to cut her out was simple
enough. Trusting to the darkness â the
horse meadow was far enough from the
dre3 to make a murky twilight of the
ruddy glowâ I thought to lead the mare
quietly away up the stream and. thus on
to the foot of that -ravine by which we
hoped to climb to the old borderer's ren
dezvous on the plateau. But when all
wan ready and I sought to' set this plan
in action, an unforeseen obstacle barred
the way. To keep the horses from stray
ing upfthe valley an Indian sentry line
was strung above the grazing meadow,
and into this I blundered, like any un
llcked knave of a raw recruit.
Had I been armed, .the warrior who
rose before me phantom-like In the lau
rel edging, of the meadow would have
had a most sharp- pointed answer to his
challenge. As it was â I had left my
sword with Jennifer because the cap
tured trooper whose understudy I was
had left his sword in campâ I tried to
parley with the sentry. He knew no
word of English, nor I of Cherokee; but
that deadlock was speedily broken. A
guttural call summoned others of the
horsekeepers, and one among them who
spoke a. little English.
"Ugh! What-for take white squaw
horse?" he demanded.
" 'Tls the captain's order," I replied,
lying boldly to fit the crisis. i_;
â¢ At that they gave me room; and had I
hastened I had doubtless gone at large
without more ado. But at this very apex
point of hazard I must needs play out
the part of unalarra to the fool's envoi,
taking time to part the mare's forelock
under the headstall, and looking leisure
ly to the lacings of the saddle girth.
This foolhardy delay cost me. all, and
more, than all. I was still fiddle-fad
dling with the girth strap, the bet
ter to impose Tipon my Indian
horse guards when suddenly there arose
a yelling hubbub of laughter in the
camp behind. 1 turned to look and
beheld a thing laughable enough, no
doubt, and yet It broke no bubble of
mirth in me. Half-way from the nearest
forest fringe to the. great fire a man,
white of skin and clothed only in a pair
of trooyer boots, was running swiftly
for cover to the nearest pine bough
.-shelter, shouting like an escaped Bed
lamite as he fled. It asked for no sec
ond glance, this apparition of the yell
ing madman:- 'twas our captive soldier,
foot ]<y>*e and racing In to raise the hue
and Ay. .' Â¦
Now you may always count upon this
failing in a cautious manâ that in a
crisis he ,1s like to do the unwisest thing
that offers.' This cutting out of Mar
gery's mare was none so vital, a matter
that I should have risked the marring
of Ephraim Yeates' plan upon it. Yet.
having done this- very thing, I must
needs make a bad matter infinitely worse.
Instead of mounting, to ride a churge
through the camp, and so to draw the
pursuit after me toward the cavern en
trance, .13 I should. I "lapped the mare
to send her bounding through the guard
line, snatched a saddle from its oak
branch peg to hurl It In ths faces of the
{â¢entry group, and, darting aside, plung
ed inta the laurel thicket to come by
running where I could and creeping
where I must to that place where I bad
left Richard Jennifer.
All hot and exasperated, as I was, 'twas
something less than cooling to find Dick
n-double on the ground, holding his tides
and. laughing like a yokel at his first
pantomime.
"Oh, ho. ho! did you â did you twig
him.^Jack?" he gasped. "Saw you ever
s>uch a ralncins puss-in-boots since tae
Lord made you? .Ah' ha! ha!"
"The devil. take ycur ill-timed humor!"
1 cried. '.'Up with you, man, and let uÂ»
vanish while we may." '
By this time the cam? was in a pretty
ferment, as you would jruess â our late
captive having had spacs enough to tell
his tale. Drunk or 'sober. Falconnet was
afoot and alert, shouting his orders to
the Englishmen, who were scrambling
for their arms, and to the Indians, who
came swarming up from the lodges.
As I had hoped to find them, .the sad
dles were hung upon the branches of the
nearest, trees, Margery's horse-furnish
ings among them. At first the black
mare was shy of me, but a gentling word
or,two won her over, and she let me take
?|erÂ» by the forelock and lead her deeper
nto the herd where* I could saddle and
bridle her in greater safety.
But being otherwise enjoined, as I say,
I turned my back upon the temptation
and held to the business in hand, which
was to reach and recrosa the ' stream
higher up and so to come among the
horses.
But- since my dear lady would also
share the hazard of such a broadside. I
had no leave to blow myself and the
powder convoy to kingdom come, as I
thirsted toâ^could not, you will say, hav
ing neither pistol to snap nor flint, and
steel to fire a train". Nay. nay. my dears,
I would pot have you think so lightly of

the sick man: and when he was securely
lashed thereto there was little danger for
him save In some stumbling of the beast
he rode. ,
When all was ready we had first to find
our way down from the mountain top:
and now even the old borderer and tha
Indian confessed their Inability to ' do
aught but retrace their steps by the only
route they knew: namely, by that ravine
which we had twice traversed In day
light, and up which they had led the
captured horses In the dusk.
This route promised all the perils of a
gauntlet-running, since by It we must take
the risk of* meeting the fleeing fugitives
from the convoy camp. If the explosion
had spared any fit to lift and carry the
vengeance cry. But here again there was
no alternative, and we set us in order
for the descent, with Teates and the
Catawba ahead, the women and Dick in
the midst, and her Apostolic Majesty's
late captain of hussars, masquerading as
a British trooper, to bring on the rear.-
Once In motion beneath the blue-black
shadows of the pines, I quickly lost alt
sense of direction. After we had ridden
in wordless silence a short half hour or
less, and I supposed we shquld be nearlng
the head of our descending ravine, our
little cavalcade was halted suddenly in
a thickset grove of the pines, and Eph
ralm Teates appeared at my stirrup to
say:
"H'ist ye off your nag, Cap'n John,
and let's take a far*well squlnch at tne
inlmy whilst we can."
â¢"Where? what enemy?" I would ask,
Â¦lipping from the saddle at his "word.
"Why, the hoss captain's varmints, to
be sure ;\ or what-all the abomination o\
desolation has left of 'em. We ain't
more than a cat's Jump from the edge o'
the big rock where we first sot eyes on
"em this morning."
I saw not what was to be gained by
any such long-range espial in the dark
ness. None the less. I followed the old
man to the cliff's edge. He was wiser
in his forecastlngs than I was in mine.
There was a thing to look at, and light
enough to see it by. One of the missile
stones. It seems, had crashed into the
great fire, scattering the brands In all
directions. The pine-bough troop shelters
were ablaze, and creeping serpent3 of
fire were worming their way hither and
yon over the year-old leaf beds in the
wood. Ever and anon some pine sap
ling in the path of these fiery serpents
would go uo In a torchllke flare; and so,
as I say, there was light enough.
What we looked dovm upon was not
inaptly pictured out by Ephralm Yeate3*
Scripture phrase, the abomination of
desolation. Every vestige of the
camp save the glowing skeletons of the
troop shelters had disappeared, and the
swarded savanna was Decome a biacK
ened chaos-blot on the fair woodland
scene. I have said that the powder shel
tering bowlder was a cliff for size; the
mighty upheaval of tne explosion had
toppled It in ruins into the stream and
huge fragments the bigness of a wine
butt had been hurled with the storm of
lighter debris broadcast upon the camp.
. At first we saw no sign of life in all
the flrellt space. But a moment later
when three or four of the sapling torches
blazed up together we made out some
half dozen figures of human beings â Â¦
whether red or white we could not ten
stumbling and reeling about among the
rocks like blind men drunken. Â¦ -'
At sight of these the old hunter doffed

IN' WHICH WE MAKE A FORCED
MARCH.
It could have been but little short of
midnight when we came down Into the
Great Trace near the ambush ground
where we had set our trap for the peace
men.
The night had cleared most beauti
fully, and overhead the stars were burn-
Ing like points of white fire In the black
dome of the heavens. As often happens
after a shower, the night shrtlilngs of
the forest were in fullest tide, and a
whlp-will*s-wldow. disturbed at our ap
proach, fluttered to a higher perch and
set up his plaintive protest.
' As our turning eastward on the trace,
the old hunter massed our little com
pany as compactly as the path allowed,
and giving us the word to follow cau
tiously, tossed his bridle rein to the
Catawba and went on ahead to feel out
the way.
This rearrangement set me to ride
abreast with Margery, and for the first
time since that fateful night in the up
per room at Appleby Hundred we were
together and measurably alone.
Since death might be lying In wait for
us at any turn In the winding bridle
path I had no mind to break the
strained- silence. But, womanlike, she
would not miss the chance to thrust at
me.
"Are you not aflre with shame. Cap
tain Ireton?" she said, bitterly, and then,
"How you must despise me!"
.* I knew not what she meant, but be
ing most anxious for her sarety. I begged
her not to talk, putting it all upon the
risk we ran In passing the outlet of the
sunken valley. Now, as you have long
since learned, my tongue was but a
skilless servant, and though I sought to
make the command the gentlest piea, she
took Instant umbrage and struck back
smartly. *
"You need not make the danger an ex
cuse. I will be still, and when I speak
to you again you will De willing enough
to hear me. I promise you!"
"Nay, then, dear lady, you must not
take It sol" I protested. "'Tls my mis
fortune to be ever blundering."
But to this she gave me no answer at
all. and barring a word or two of heart
ening to her serving woman, she never
opened her lips again throughout the
perilous passage. - . . *
By good hap we came to the crossing
of the cavern* ' stream without meeting
any foeman, and on the farther side of
the shallow ford we found the old bor
derer awaiting us.
"Ez I allow,. we've smelt the bait In
the trap and come off with whole bones,
like Shadrach, Mesbach and Abednego."
he said, mixing metaphor. Scripture
phrase and frontier Idiom as was his
wont. Then he put a leg over his horse
and gave the stirrup word: "From now'
on. old Jehu, the son o' Nlmshi. Is the
hoss-whipper we've got to beat. Get ye
behind. Cap'n John, and give the hoss
that lags a half -Inch 'r so or your sword
p'lnt."
Then and there began a night flight
long to be remembered. Down the val
ley of the swift river to the ford where
Ytates and I had crossed after the mock
rescue of. Margery the night before, we
let the horses pick the way as they
could. But once beyond the ford, where
the trace was wider and the footing less
' precarious we piled whip and spur. push-
Ing the saddle-beasts for every stride we
could get out of them in the blind race.
â¢ I have marveled often that we came
not to grief In all this long night gallop
through the darkness. There was every
chano> for It. ~The overarching trees of
the great forest shut out all the star
light, and the trace was no more than
a bridle-path, rougher tf an any cart
road. Yet we held the breakneck pace
steadily, save 'for the time It took to
thread some steep defile to a stream
crossing or to scramble up its fellow on
Ing volley the Englishmen were ' thrown
into confusion; while the Indians, sum
moned by the firing and the shrilling of
the captain's whistle, dashed blindly Into
the trap. At the right moment Unca
noola touched' off his powder train and
cut in with a clear field for his rescue of
â¢ Dick and me. . .
Of the complete success of these
various climaxlngs, Ephralm Yeates
had his first assurance , when we
three ' came safely to the rendez
vous; for. after firing his masked
battery, the old ' hunter lost no
time In rejoining the women and in has
tening with them out of the valley. Had
these. three been afoot we might have
overtaken them; but Yeates had been
lucky enough to stumble upon the black
mare peacefully cropping the grass In a
little glade; and with this mount for
Margery and her, tire- woman he had
easily 'outpaced us.
All this I had from Yeates what time
> Margery was pouring the wine and oil of
: womanly sympathy Into Richard's
â¢woundlngs; and I may confess that
while the ear was listening to the hun
ter's tale, the eye was taking Â¦ note of
these her tender ministrations, ana the
heart was seulng them down to the
score of a great love which would not be
denied. ' 'Twas altogether as I would
have had it; and yet the thought came
unbidden that she might spare a niggard
moment and the breath to ask me how I
did. And because she would not, I do
think my burns smarted the crueler.
It was to have surcease of these extra
smartings that I turned my back upon
the trio under the flaring torch and took
up with Ephralm Yeates the pressing
question of the moment. r^
"As I take It, we may not linger here,"
I said. "Have you marked out a line of
retreat?" -â¢ . Â¦ \
The old borderer was busied with his
loot of the Indian campâ 'twas not In
his nature*! to come off empty-handed,
however hard pressed* he had . been for
time. In the raffle of it, guns and pis
tols, dressed skins and warrior finery, he
came upon my good blade and Richard's
great claymore â trophies claimed by the
head men of the Cherokees after our tak
ing, as we made no doubt.
"Found 'em hanging In the lodge that
usen to belong to the Great Bear," said
the hunter, and then with grim humor:
'"Lowed to keep 'em to ricollect ye* by
if so be ye was foreordained and predes
tinated to go up In a fiery chariot, like
the good old Elijah." The weapons dis
posed of, he made answer to my query.
"Ez for making tracks immejltly, if not
sooner, I allow there ain't no two notions
about that. , But I'm dad-daddled if I
know which-a-way to put out, Cap'n
John,- and that's the gospll fact."
"Why not strike for the Great Trace,
and so go back the way the powder con
voy came?" I asked.
It could be done, he said, but the haz
ard was great. 'Twas out of all reason
to hope that there were no survivors left
In the sunken valley to carry the news of
the earthquake massacre. That news
once cried abroad In the near-by Cowee
Towns, the entire Tuckasege nation
would turn out to. run us down.! More-
[ over,' the avengers would look to find us
In, the only practicable horse path lead
ing eastward. -
"Ez I'm telling you right now. Cap'n
. John, we made one more blunder In this
here onfall of our'n, owln' to our having
ne'er a seventh son of a seventh son
among us to look a little ways ahead.
Where we flashed In the pan was In not

a- making straight for that crlwls
dodge-hole right now. and lf-.we^was
I there we could do 'em like the Glleadltes
did tha men o' Ephralm at the passages
o* the Jordan." Â¦
Fresh as I was from the torture fire. I
could not forbear a shudder at this old
man's savagery.
"Kill them In cold blood?" I would say.
"Anan?" he queried, as not under
standing my point of view; and I let the
matter rest. He was of those who slay
and spare not where an .enemy Is con
cerned.
But when we came to consider It
there seemed to be no alternative to the
eastward flitting by way of the Great
Trace. To the west and south there was
only the trackless wilderness; and to the
north no white settlement nearer than
that of the over-mountain folk on the
Â¦ Watauga. I asked If we might hope to
reach this. V
" 'Tls a long fifty, mile ez the crow
flies, over e'enabout the mountalnousest
patch <f land that ever laid out o" doors."
was the hunter's reply. "And there ain't
ne'er a deer track, ez I knows on, to p'lnt
the way."
"Then we must ride eastward and run
the risk of pursuit by the Tuckaseges,"
said I.
"Ez I reckon, that's about the long and
short of it. And I do everlastedly de-'
spise to make that poor little gal Jump
Â¦her hoss and rida sklmper-scamper
again, when she's been fair living a
horseback for a fortnight."
; "She will not fall you," I ventured to
say, adding: ."But Jennifer Is in poor
fettle for making speed." '
"It's ride or be skulped for him, and I
allow he'll ride," quoth the old hunter,
hastening his preparations for the start
"Reckon we can get him on a hoss right
now."
I went to see. Margery rose at my
approach, and even In the poor light I
could see her draw herself up as If she
would hold me at my proper distance.
"Your patient. Mistress Margery â vi
must mount and ride at once. Is he fit?"
"No.:*
"But we must be far to the eastward
' before daybreak." . .
"I # cannot help It If you make him
ride to-night you will finish what those
cruel savages began*. Captain Ireton."
"We have little choice â none. I should
say."
"Oh, yon . are bitter hard I" she cried,
though wherein my offending lay Just
then I was wholly at a loss to know.
" 'Tis your privilege to say. so," I re
joined. "But as for making Dick ride,
that will be but the kindest cruelty.. We
are. only a little way from the nearest
Indian towns, and If the daylight find
us'hereâ " v^C

; CHAPTER XXX. .
HOW BPHRAIM YEATES PRAYED
v. FOR HIS ENEMIES. '. : '
. However much or '.little : the Catawba
understpod i,of Richard Jennifer's grief
or its cause, the faithful Indian had a
thing, to do and. he did It, loosing his
grasp . of to turn ; and j fall ; upon Dick
with pul!ings ' and haulings and 'buffet
ings, fit to bring a man alive out of a
very stiffening rigor of despair.
; So, i in ; a , hjEind-space "-, he i had him up,
and we were pressing on Â¦ again. In mid
night â¢ darkness - once we ' had passed be
yond ; the' light of our; grilling fires. No
word was spoken. Under the impatient
urging of the Indian there was little
breath to spare for ; speech. But when
Richard's afterthought had set its fangs
In him he . called a halt and would not
be denied.
VGo \ on, you two, Â¦â¢ If you are set upon
it," he said. "I : must go back. Bethink
you, Jack, what : if she should be only
maimed and not. killed outright. "Tls too
horrible^ I'm going back, I say." "-"'
The Catawba grunted his disgust.
,- "Captain Jennlf talk fas'; * no
run- , fas'. What think? "White
.squaw.*' yonderâ no yonder," pointing
first forward arid then back in the direc
tion of the stricken camp. V
"Richard spun around and gripped the
Indian by the shoulders. : "Then she Is
Â«llve | and safe?" he burst out. "Speak,
friend, while I leave the breath In you
to do it!"
"Ugh!" said the chief, In nowise moved
either by Jennifer's violence or by the
dog-like shake. "What for Captain Jen
nif* think pappoose thinks 'bout the Gray
Wolf and poor Injun? Catch um white
squaw firs'; then blow urn up Chelakee
camp and catch um Captain Jennlf and
Captain Longknif e if . I can. Heap do
firs' thing firs', and las' thing las'. Wah!"
It was the longest speech this devoted
ally of | ours was ever known to make;
and having made It he went dumb again
save for his urglngs of us forward. But
presently both be and I had our hands
full with the poor lad. The swift transi
tion from despair to Joy proved too much
for .Dick; and. besides, the fever was .In
his blood and he was grievously burned.
So when we went stumbling on
through the cloud-darkened wood, locked
arm in arm like three drunken men. trip
ping over ' snares and bramble nets
spread for our feet, and getting well
sprinkled by the dripping foliage. And
at. the last, whe.n we reached the ravine
the valley's head, Dick was muttering
in the fever delirium and we were well
nigh carrying him a dead weight be
tween us.
'Twas a most heart-breaking business,
getting the poor lad up that rock ladder
of escape in the darkness; for though I
had come out of the fire with fewer
burns than the roasting of me warrant
ed, . the battle preceding it had opened the
old sword wound In my shoulder. So,
taking it all In all. I was but a short
breathed second to the faithful Catawba.
None the less, we tugged it through
after j some laborious . fashion, and were
glad enough when the steep ascent gave
place to leveler going, and we could sniff
the fragrance of the ' plateau pines and
feel their wire-like needles under foot,
By this the . shower cloud had passed
and , the stars were coming out, but It
-was still pitch black under the pines; so
dark that I started like a nervous wo
man and '.went | near to panlo .when a
: horse . snorted at ' my very ear, and a
'voice, bodiless/ as It seemed; said: â¢ "Well,
now; the Lord be praised! If here ain't
the whole enduring-^
-What Ephralm Yeates would have
said, or did say, was lost upon me. For
now my poor Dick's strength was quite
spent, and when the chief and I were
easing him to lie at full length upon the
ground there was a quick little cry out
of the darkness, a swish of petticoats,
and my lady darted in to fall upon Rich
ard In a very transport of pity.
"Oh, my poor Dick! they have killed
you!" she sobbed; "oh, cruel, cruel!"
Then she lashed out at us. "Why don't
you strike a light? How can I find and
dress his hurts In the dark 7"
"Your pardon. Mistress Margery," *I
said; "'tis the fever has overcome him.
He has no sore* hurts, as I believe, save
the fire scorching."
"A light!" she commanded; "I must
have a light and see for myself." .
We had to humor her,- though It', was
' something against I prudence. Ephralm
found dry punk in a' rotten log, and fir
ing it with the flint and steel of a great
king's musketâone of his reavlngs from
the enemy â soon . had ' a- pine-knot torch
for her. She gave It over to the Cataw
ba to hold; and while she was cooing
over her patient and binding up his
burns In some simples gathered near at
hand by the Indian, I ' had the story of
the double rescue from the old hunter, j
Set forth, in brief, that which had
come as â¢ a miracle to^ Dick and me fig
ured as a daring bit of -strategy made
possible by the emptying of the Indian
camp at our torture spectacle.
Yeates and the Catawba, following out
the plan agreed upon, had come within
spying distance while we were yet in the
midst of that hopeless back-to-back bat
tle, and had most wisely held aloof. But
later, wnen every Indian of the Cherokee
band was busy at our torture trees, they
set to .work.'"
With no watch to give the alarm,
'twas easy to rifle the Indian wigwams
of the firearms and ammunition. The
latter they threw Â¦ Into the stream; the
muskets they loaded and trained over a
fallen tree at the northern edge of the
savanna, bringing them to bear point
blank upon the Ughthorsd guard gath
ered again around the great fire.
The next step was the cutting out of
the women; this was effected while the
baronet-captain was paying his courtesy
call on us. Like the looting of the In
dian camp, 'twas quickly planned and
"daringly done ; it asked but the quieting
of, the two trooper guards on * the * forest
side of the tepee lodge, a warning word
to Margery and her 'woman,' and a
shadow-like flitting with them over \ the
dead bodies of their late Jailers to the
shelter of the wood. "
Once . free of the camp, Yeates had
hurried his charges to a place of tempo
rary safety : farther up the valley, leav
ing the Catawba to cross the stream to
lay a train < of " dampened powder . to the
magazine. When he had led
the women to a place of safety, the old
man-left "them and ran back to his
masked battery of loaded muskets. Here,
â¢ at ; an r owl-cry signal ;Â¦ from' Uncanoola, ; he
opened fire upon the redcoats.'
The 'outworking of the" coup - de main
was a triumph for; the old borderer's
shrewd generalship. At the death-deal-'
now," said I, hearing a groan from my
poor Dick.
His reply was a chattering curse, not
upon Falconnet or the Indians, but upon
his malady, the tertian fever.
"Now. by all the fiends! I'm chilling
again. Jack 1" he gasped. ' "If these cursed
wood-wolves mark it. they'll set It down
to woman cowardice and that .will break
my heart!"
Again I bade him be of good courage,
assuring him, riot derisively, as It looks
when 'tis written but, that the fire would
presently medicine the': chilling. In the
middle of the saying the lighted brand
was fetched and thrust among our fagot
ings, and the v upward-curling smoke
wreaths made ' me gasp and strangle at
the finish. ., '." /
Fora little time after the sucking in
of that first smoke-breathâ -nature's ano
dyne for any one of her- poor creatures
doomed to die by flref-I saw and heard
less clearly and suffered only by antici
pation. But to. this day the smell of
burning pine wood is like a sleeping po
tion to me; and the sleep It brings is full
of dreams vaguely/troubled. ",
So, while the Indians danced and
leaped about us. brandishing their wea
pons and chanting the captives' death
song, and while the/blue and yellow
tongues of flame mounted from twig to
twig, climbing stealthily to flick at us
like little. vanishing demon whips, I saw
and heard and felt as one remote from
all the* torture, turmoil of the moment.
Through the dimming haze of sleeping
sensibility 5 the dancing savages became
as marionettes In some cunning puppet
show; and "the blood-satlned figures
stiffening against their log took shapes
less horrifying. *
'Twas Dick's voice, coming, as It
seemed, from a mighty, distance, that
broke the spell and : brought me back to
quickened agonies. He spoke in panting
gasps, aa the smoke would let him.
"One word. Jack, before we go â go to
our own place. He said â he said she
would be free toâ to marry him. Tell
me â¢ â¢ .:.â¢' OGod in heaven f"
( His agony was a lash , to cut me deep
er than any flicking demon whip of flame,
yet I mutt needs add to it..
\ "Aye, Richard, I have wronged you,
wronged you* desperately; can you hear
mo yet? I say I have wronged you, and
I shall die the easier if you'll forgive â "
Once more the smoke, rising again In
denser ; clouds,: cut me off. and through
the blinding blue haze of it I saw the
Indians running up with green branches
to beat ft down lest it should spoil their
sport oversoon by smothering us out of
hand. f'^'Cfi '
. With the chance to gasp and breathe
again I would have confessed In full to
Richard Jennifer and had him shrive me
if he would. But when I /called, he did
not answer. His head was rolling from
side to side; and his handsome young
face was all drawn and distorted as in
the awful grimaces of the death throe.
You will not wonder that I could not
look at him; that I looked away for very
pity's sake, praying. that I might quickly
breathe the flames, as I made sure ha
had, and so be the sooner past the an
guish crisis. .
There was good j hope that the prayer
would have a speedy answer. The fires
were burning clearer now, leaping up in
broad dragons" tongues of -flames from
the Â¦ outer . edges . of j the ' fagot V piles to
curtain off all that lay beyond.' Through
the luminous flame veil the capering say
fages took on shapes the most weird and
grotesque; and. when I had a glimpse of
the dead ' men's ' row, each j hideous | face
In it seemed to wear a grin of ' leering
triumph. " . . " ._Â¦-... Â¦Â¦'.;.'
Thus far there had never been | a puff
of wind to fan the blaze. But now above
the shrilling of the Indian chant and the
crackling of the flames alow growl ol
thunder trembled In the upper air, and
a gentle breeze swept through the tree
tops. .
So now I would commend my soul to
God, making sure that . the breath he
gave would go out on the wings of the
first gust of wind that should come to
drive the fiery veil inward. But when
the gust. came It was from behind; a
sweeping besom to beat down the leap-
Ing dragons' tongues; a pouring flood ol
blessed coolness to turn the ebbing life
tide and to set the dulled senses once
more keenly. alert.
With the wind came the rain, a pass
ing summer night's shower of great
drops spattering on the leaves above and
dripping thence to fall hissing In tha
fires. Then the thunder growled again;
and into the monotonous droning of the
Indian chant, or rather rising sharp
and clear above It, came a sudden
rattling ttre of musketry from the camp
In the savanna â this, and . the sharp
skirling of the troop captain's whistle
Bhrilllng the assembly.
While the flames' lay flattened in the
wind. I saw the Indians wheel and bound
away to the rescue of their camp like a
pack of hounds in full cry. In a trice
they were wallowing through the stream
at the foot of the powder boulder; and
then.' as the flames leaped up again, a
dark form burst through the flery bar
rier, my bonds were cut. and a strong
hand plucked me out of the scorching
bell pit.
If I did aught to help It was all me
chanical. I do remember dimly some
fierce struggle to free my legs from the
blazing: tangle; this, . and the swelling
sob of Joy at the sight of the faithful
Catawba hacking. at Dick's : lashings and
dragging h,im also free of the fire. And
you may believe the welcome tears came
to ease. the pain of my seared eyes when
my poor ladâ I had thought him gone
past human helpâ took ' two; staggering
steps and flung his arms about my neck.
Uncanoola gave us no, time to come by
easy stages to full-wit sanity. - In a
twinkling he had pounced upon us to
crush us one upon the other behind the
larger tree. And now I come upon an
other of those flitting instants so crowd
ed with happenings that the swiftest pen
must seem to make them lag.. 'Twas all
In a heart beat, as It were; the Catawba'H
freeing of us; bis flinging us to earth
behind the tree; a spurt of blinding yel
low flame f rpm the foot of the powder
cliff and a booming/ Jarring shock like
that of an earthquake.
â¢ The momentary â¢ glare of the yellow
flash lit up a scene most awe-inspiring.
The epoutlngr fountain of fire at the base
of the great r : powder i rock was thick
with flying missiles; and on high the very
cliff itself was tottering and Â¦ crumbling.
So much I saw; then the Catawba sprang;
up to haul us afoot by main: strength,
and to i rush us, with an arm for. each,
headlong ; through the wood toward the
valley, head.
I . But Dick hung back, and when the dull
thunder .; of the '- falling rocks,' the . crash
of the tumbling cliff and the shrill death
yells of the doomed ones came to our
saw It leave the thrower's hand; saw it
coming straight, -as I would think. Â¦ to
split my skulL The prompting to dodge
was well-nigh masterrul enough to over
ride the strongest will. Yet I did make
shift to hold fast, and In mid flight the
twirling ax veered aside to miss me by
a halrsbreadth, gashing the tree at my
ear when It struck.
"Bravo! well met!" cried Richard; and
then, betwixt his teem: "Here comes
mine."
As he spoke a second tomahawk was
sped. I heard it strike with a dull crash
that might have been on flesh and bone,
or on oak bark â I could not telL I dared
not look aside till Richard's taunting
laugh gave me leave to breathe again.
The Indians answered the laugh with
a yell; and now the marksmen stood out
quickly ene after another " and for
a little space the air was full . of
hurtling missiles. You fill read in the
romances of the wondrous skill of these
savages in such diversions as these; how
they will pin the victim to a tree and
never miss of sticking knife or hatchet
within the thickness of the blade where
they will. But you must take these tales
with a dash of allowance for the j ro
mancer's fancy. Truly, these Indiana of
ours threw well and skillfully; 'tis a
part of the only trade they knowâ the
trade of war â to send a weapon true to
the mark. None the less, some of the
missiles flew wide; and now and then
one would nip the cloth of sleeve or body
covering-^-and the flesh beneath it, as
well. ' :
Dick had more of the nlppings than I;
and though he kept up a running fire of
taunts and -gibing flings at the marks
men. I could hear the gritting oaths
aside when they pinked him.
Notwithstanding, the worst of these
miscasts fell to my lot. A hatchet, sped
by the clumsiest hand of all. missed its
curving, turned, and the helve of It
struck me fair In the stomach. Not all
the parting pangs of death, as I fondly
believe, will lay a heavier toll on forti
tude than did this grlplng-stroke which
I must endure standing erect. "Tis no
figure ot speech to say that I would have
gi\|n tha reversion of heaven, and a
crown to boot, for leave to double over
and groan out the agony of It. *
Happily for us, there were no women
with the band, so we were spared the
crueler refinements of these ante-burning
torments; the flaying alive by inch-bits,
and the sticking of blazing splints of
pitch wood in the flesh to make death a
thing to be prayed for. There was
naught of this; and tiring finally of the
marksman play, the Indians made ready
to burn us. Some ran to recover the
spent weapons; others made haste to
heap .the wood in a broad circle about
our trees; and the chief, with three or
four to help, renewed . the deer-thong
lashings.
â¢Twas In the reblndlng that this head
man, a right kingly looking savage as
these barbarians go, thrust a bit of pa
per Into my hand, and gave me time to
glance Its message out by the light of
the fire. 'Twas a line from Margery;
and this is what she said:
"Dear Heart: Though you must needs
believe my love Is pledged to your good
friend and mine, 'tls yours, and yours
alone, my lion-hearted one. I am pray
ing the good God to give you dying
grace, and me the courage to follow you
quickly. MARGERY.
"This by the hand of Tallachama."
For one brief Instant a wave of Joy
caught and flung me upon Its highest
crest, and all these savage tormentors
could do to me became as naught. Then
the true meaning of this her brave Ave
atque vale smote me like a space-flung
meteor, and the Joy-wave became an
ocean of. despair to engulf me In
Its blackest depths. The letter
was never meant for me; 'twas
for Richard Jennifer, who, as she
would think, must know tn"e story of her
marriage to his friend and must believe
her love went with the giving of her
hand. And she named him LJon Heart
because he was brave and true and
strong, like that first English Richard of
the kingly line.
I thrust the message back upon the
bearer of it, begging him in dumb show
to, give it quickly to my companion. I
knew not at the time if he did it, being
so crushed and blinded by this fresh mis
ery. But when the Indians drew off to
ring us In a chanting circle for the final
act, I would not let - the lad see my face
for fear he might fathom the heart
break In- me and know the cause of it.
. 'Twas at this crisis, when all was ready
and one had run to fetch the fire, that
I heard a smothered oath from Dick and
saw the Indian who was coming up to
fire the wood heaps drop his brand and
tread upon It.
"Ecod." said a voice, courtier-llke and
smoothly modulated. " 'Tls most devilish
lucky I came. Captain Ireton. Another
moment and they would have grilled, you
In the King's uniformâ a rank treason,
to say naught of poor Jack Warden, left
without a clout to cover him."/
It needed not the glance aside to name
mine enemy. But I would not pleasure
him with an answer. Neither would
Richard Jennifer. He stood silent for a
little space, smiling and nursing his chin
in one hand, at his habit was. Then he
epoke again.
"I came to bid you godspeed, gentle
men. You tumbled bravely into my lit
tle trap. I made no doubt you'd follow
where the lady led, and so you did. But
you'll turn back from this. I do assure
you, if there be any virtue in an Indian
barbecue."
At this Richard could hold In no longer.
"Curse you!" he gritted. "Do you mean
that you kidnapped Mistress Stair to
draw uÂ« out of hiding?"
"Truly," said this arch fiend, smiling
again. "Most unluckily for you, you
/both stood in my wayâ you see I am
speaking of It now as a thing of the past
âand I chanced upon this thought of
kllllng'two birds with the one stone; nay,
three, I should say. If you . count the
lady In."
"Have done!" choked Richard, in a
voice thick with Impotent rage. "Give
place, you hound, and let your savages
to their work}"
"At your pleasure, Mr. Jennifer. I
have no fancy for funeral-baked meats,
net or cold, though they be made, as
now, to furnish forth a marriage sup
per. I bid you good night, gentlemen.
I'll go and make that call upon the lady
which' you were bo ruda as to Interrupt
a little while ago." And with that he
turned his back upon us and strode
away, forgetting to tell his redskinned
myrmidons to strip me of that King's
uniform he was so loath to have me
burned In. .
The Cherokees waited until the master
executioner was out of. sight among the
trees. Then they set up their " infernal,
howling again, and . the fire-lighter ran
to fetch a fresh brand.
"Courage, lad! 'twill soon be ever
meadow, other savages werÂ« hurrying to
Join the wood carriers.
So far aa these hasting preliminaries
applied to me, their meaning was not
difficult to read. I was to be burned at
the stake In proper savage fashion. But
Richard Jennifer â what had become of
him? A. sound, half sigh, half groan,
told me where to look. Hard by. bound
to a tree as I was. and so near that with
a free hand I could have touched him.
was my poor lad.
"Dick!" I cried.
He turned his head as the dose-drawn
thongs permitted and gave me a smile as
loving- tender as a woman's.
"Aye, Jack; they have us hard and
fast this time. I have been praying
you'd never come alive enough to feel
the fire."
"We were taken together?" So much
I dared ask. ..â¢Â¦?." '-. : .;
"In the same onset Twas but a ques
tion of clock ticks In that back-to-back
business. But they paid scot and lot,"
this with an Inching nod toward a row
of naked bodies propped sitting against
a fallen tree; nine of them in all. one
with Its severed head between Its knees,
and three others showing the gaping
hacks and hewlngs of the great broad
sword.
-They've fetched them here to see uÂ«
burn." he went on. "But by the gods, we
have the warrant of two good blades and
Ephralm Teates* hunting knife that the
only flres they'll ever see are those of
belL"
Teates?" I queried. "Then they have
taken him and the Catawba, as well?"
"Not alive, you may be sure, else we
should have them for company. But It
has a black look for our friends that the
flying column we met In the stream
cave came back so soon. More
over, the bodies of the three
peace-pipe smokers were found and
brought In; that will be the Qreat Bear
holding his head in his hands at the end
of yonder bloody masquerade."
"I guessed as much. God rest our pool
comrades!"
"Aye; and God help Madge! "Tls xw
time for reoroache*. but among us we
have signed her death warrant with out
bungllngs."
"If it were only death!" I groaned.
" 'Tls Just that. Jack," said he; "nc
better, mayhap, but no worse. When wÂ«
were downed by that screeching moS shÂ«
we* out and on her knees to Falconnet,
beseeching him to spare us. He put hei
on" smoothly at first, saying 'twas thÂ«
Indians' affairâ that they would not bÂ«
balked of their vengeance by any Inter
ference of his. But when Bhe only beg
ged the more piteously he showed hit
true colors, rapping out tnat we should
1 have as swift a quittance as we had
meant to give him, and tEat within th*
hour she should be the mistress of Ap
pleby and free to marry an English gen
tleman."
"Well?" said I, making buts that now
at last he must know all.
"At that *he stood before him brave
ly, and 1 saw that all the time she hat!
had the Catawba's knife hidden in the
folds of her gown. 'You have spoker
truth for once. Captain Falconnet; I shal!
1 be free, 1 she added. 'Come and tell mt
when you have added these to your othei
murders."
"And then?"
"Then she went bade to her prison wig
wam, walking through the rabble of red
coats and redskins as proud as the Scot
tish Mary went to the block."
'She will do it, think you?" I queried,
fearful that she would, but more fearful
lest her courage should fall at the pinch.
"Never doubt It. Good Catholic as she
is, there Is martyr blood in her on bei
mother's side, and that will help her to
die unsullied. And God nerve her to It,
say L M
I paid "Amen" to that; and thereupon
we both fell client, watching as con
demned men on the gallows the bus}
preparations for our taking off.
Again, as In the late battle. It was thÂ«
trivial things that moved me most. Chle]
among them the grinning row of dead
Indians propped against the fallen tree
In the constant background for all the
memory pictures of that waiting Interval,
and I can see those stiffening corpses
new, some erect, as If defying us;, some
lopping this way or that; as if theii
bones had gone to water at the touct
of the steel.
I know not why these poor relics ol
mortality should have held me fascinated
as they did. Yet when I would looli
away, through the vista to where th<
light of the great fire in the savanna
camp played luridly upon the Indian
lodges, or, nearer at hand, upon the sav
ages gathering the wood to burn us
with, this ghastly file of the dead
drew me Irresistibly, and I must
needs pass the fearsome figures
in review again, marking the star
ing eyes and unnatural postures, and the
circular blood-black patches on the heads
of the three peacemen whom Yeates and
the Catawba bad scalped.
While they were making ready for the
burning, our executioners were strangely
silent; but when the work was done they
formed In a semicircle to front the row
of corpses and set up a howling chant
that would have put a band of Moham
medan dervishes to the blush.
"'Tls the death song' for the slain,"
said Richard; and while It lasted, this
moving tableau of naked figures, keep-
Ing time In a weird stamping dance to
the rising and falling ululation of the
chant, held us spellbound.
But we" were not long suffered to be
mere curious onlooffera. In Its dlsmalest
flight the death song ended .In a shrill
hubbub, and the dancers turned as one
man to face us.
I hope it may never be your lot. my
dears,'. to, meet and endure such a horrid
glare * of -human ferocity as that these
?wrought up avengers of blood bent upon
us. "T was more unnerving than aught
that had' gone before; more terrible, I
thought, than aught that could come
after. Yet. â¢ as to this, yon shall Judge
lor 'Â¦ yourselves. -
.-. The' pause was brief, and when a lad
ran up to cut. the thongs that bound us
from the middle up, the torture play be
gan In dVadly earnest. While the In
dian youth was slashing at the deerskin,
Richard "gave me my cue.
"'Tls the knife and hatchet play; they
are loosing us to give us .freedom to
shrink and dodge. Look straight before
and never flinch a hair, as you would
keep the life In you one minute to the
next!"
"Trust me," said L "We must eke It
out aa x long as we can to give our dear
lady time for another prayer or two.
Mayhap she will name us In them; God
knows, our need Is sore enough."
The lad ran back, and a warrior stood
out. Juggling his tomahawk In air. He
made a feint to cast it at Richard, but
Instead sent it whizzing at me.
That first missile was harder to face
unflinching than were all the others. ITHE FIJNDAY C AIjIj.
(Concluded Next Sunday.)
since morning dubiously lost in the som
ber trackless forest, when an elflsfi cry
rose, as it would seem, from beneath the
very hoofs of my horse,
"God save the king!"
The bay shied suddenly, standing with
nostrils a-qulver; and I had to look
closely to make out the little brown dot
of humanity, clad In russet homespun,
crouching in the path, lta childish eyes
wide with fear and its lips parted to
shrill again: "God save the king!"
I threw a stiff leg over the cantle and
swung down to go on one knee to my
stout challenger. I can never make you
understand, my dears, how the sÂ»ght of
this helpless waif appearing thur unac
countably in the heart of the great for
est mellowed and softened me. 'Twas a
little maid, not above three or four years
old,/ and with a face that Master Ra
phael-might have taken as a pattern for
one of < his seraphs.
"What know you of the king-, little
one?" I asked. â
"Gran'dad told me." she. lisped. "If I
was to see a soldier-man I must say.
quick,' 'God save the king.' or 'haps he'd
eat me. Is â is you hungry, Mister Sol
dier-man?"
"Truly I am that sweetheart: but I
don't eat little maids. Where is your
grandfather?"
. "Ain't got any gran'favver; I said
'gran'dad'."
"Well, your gran'dad, then; can you
take me to him?"
"I don't know. 'Haps you'd eat him."
"No fear of that, my dear. Do I look
as if I ate people 7*
She gave me a long scrutiny out of
the innocent eyes and then put up two
little brown hands to be taken. "I tired."
she said; and my sore heart went warm
within me when I took her in my arms
and cuddled her. After a long-drawn
sigh of contentment, she said: "My
name Polly; what's yours?"
"You may call me Jack. If you pleaseâ
Captain Jack, if that comes the easier.
And now will you let me take you to
your gran'dad 7*
She nodded, and I spoke to the bay and
mounted, still holding her closely in my
arms.
"Tell me quickly which way to go,
P.olly," I said; for besides being, as I
would fear, far out of the way to Gilbert
Town, the last hilltop to the rear had
given me another sight of my shadowing'
pursuers riding hard as if they meant to
overtake me. x
The little maid sat up straight on the
saddle horn and looked about her as If to
get her bearings.
"That way." she said, pointing short to
the right; and I wheeled the horse into a
blind path that wound in and out among
the trees for a long half mile, to end at
a little clearing on the banks of a small
stream.
In the midst of the clearing was a
rude log cabin; and in the open doorway
stood a man bent and aged, a patriarchal
figure with white hair falling to his
shoulders and a snowy beard iÂ«uch as
Aaron might have worn. At sight of me
the old watcher disappeared within the
house, but a moment later he was out
again, fingering the lock of an ancient
Queen's-arm.
I drew rein quickly, and the little maid
sat up and saw the musket
' "Don't shoot, gran'dad!" she cried
"He's Captain Jack, and he doesn't eat
folks es."
At this thÂ« old man came to meet us,
though still with the clumsy musket held
at the ready.
â¢These be parlous times, sir," he said
half in apology, I thought And then:
"You have made friends with my little
maid, and I owe you somewhat for
bringing her safe home."
"Nay." said I; "the debt is mine, in
asmuch as I have the little onÂ« for my
friend. 'Tis long since I havÂ« held a
trusting child in my arms, I do assure
you, sir."
He bowed as grandly as any courtier.
"I hope he* trust is not misplaced, sir;
though for the matter of that we have
little enough now to take or leave."
"You have given It all to the Klng7'
said I, feeling my way as I had need to-.
that I might have a chance to exchange
a word with my dear lady; might ask
her forgiveness, or, failing so much
grace of her,*, might "at least have an
other sight of her sweet face.
But even this poor boon was denied
nw. I was scarce out of the saddle when
an aide came to conduct me to the gen
eral, and I saw no one in the house save
my lord himself.
As you would guess, ray instructions
conformed exactly to the plan outlined
by Lord Cornwallis in the council. I was
intrusted with a sealed packet for deliv
ery to Major Ferguson, and. for safety's
sake, as my lord explained. I was given
the meat of. the message to deliver ver
bally should the need arise. Ferguson
was to be ordered to come In instantly
by forced marches, If necessary, and he
was on no account to risk a battle with
the over-mountain men.
You may be sure, my desrrs, that I
scarce drew breath till I was ahorse and
out of the toÂ»n and galloping hard on
the road to that ford of Master Mac
gowan's which afterward became famous
in -our history under the misspelling
"Cowan's Ford." 'Twas too good to be
true, that I should be thrust thus into
the very gaping mouthNof opportunity,
and now and again I would feel the
packet buttoned tight beneath my hussar
Jacket to mako sure 'twas not a dream
to vanish at a touch.
.In- the mad Joy of it the spirit of
prophecy came upon me, and I saw as if
the thing were done, how at last I held
the fate of the patriot cause. In all our
west country in the hollow >qf my hand.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
OF WHAT BEFELL AT KING'S CREEK.
Skipping lightly over the happenings
of the two days following my departure
from | Charlotte on the king's errand, I
may say that after passing the, British
outposts at the crossing of the Catawba,
I met neither friend nor foe and -from
noon on I rode, to the westward through
a pitiless, drizzling rain, splashed to the
belt with the mire of the road, and hav
ing little chance to Inquire my way.
This last lack grew with the pawing
hours to the size of a threatening hazard.
As -you may have guessed. I knew no
more than a blind man the route 1
should take; knew no more of the"where
abouts of Gilbert Town and Major Fer
guson's rendezvous than that both were
some eighty miles to the westward.
At the outset I had thought to feel out
the way in general by cautious inquiry
along the road; but when I came to con
sider of this, the risk of betraying my
ignorance to those who followed me was
too great to let me turn aside to any of
the wayside houses; and as for chance
passers-by, there were none â the rain
kept all within doors.
So I was constrained to gallop on
without pause; and throughout that com
fortless afternoon and the scarce less
mtserable day which followed there were
no Incidents' to break the dull monotony
of the blind', race save these two; that
once the clouds lifted enough to give me
a glimpse of my pursuers in a far reach
to the eastward; and once again I had a
sight of an awkward horseman in the
road before me â saw him and tried to
overtake him. and could not. for all his
clumsy riding.
Now I was curious about this lone
horseman ahead for more reasons than
one. but chiefly because my glimpse of
him seemed to show me the back of a
man whom I made sure I had left safe
behind In the British guardhouse in
Charlotte, to wit, the scoundrelly little
pettifogger.
At first I scoffed the Idea. Saying he
were free to leave Charlotte, how should
he be riding post on my haphazard road
to the westward? 'Twas against all rea
son, and yet the tittuping figure of
which I- had but a rain- veiled glimpse
named Itself Owen Pengarvin in spite of
all the reasons I could bring to bear.
'Twas close on eventide of the second
day. the early evening gloaming of a
chill autumnal rain-day, and I had been
ent Â¦ In the meantime in this matter of
reaching Ferguson we may make good
use of him."
"In what manner, . your lordship?"
asked one whose voice I did not recog
nize. .' .,' .-Â¦'' . .
"He has come straight from Major
Ferguson, as I say; and. loyalist or rebel,
he can flnd his way back to Gilbert
Town." â¢ *
"But you'll never: be trusting him with
dispatches!" said Lord Rawdon. j
"There's no need to, trust him. He can
be given the dispatches i with some hint
of their purport, : and of how much the
klng?s cause. will profit by their safe de
livery." . " '
Again a silence fell upon the group
around the lawyers' table, and then some
one â 'twas Major Hanger, as I thought â
said: "'Tis an unread riddle for me as
yet, my lord." I ; ';'-Â¦'/ â¢, 1 .,
Cornwallis laughed. "Where are your
wits this morning, gentlemen? If he be
loyal, and true, the 'dispatches will go
safe enough. If, on the other hand, he
be a rebel and a spy, he will doubtless
tamper with them; but In that case he
will none the less ride straight enough
to Major Ferguson's 1 headquarters in the
west." ""."â¢â¢ â¢ 'â¢Â¦ Â¦
"H'm; your lordship is still too deep
for me." said Tarleton's second in com
mand. "If he be a rebel and a spy. why,
in God's name. 'Bhould he carry your
lordship's letters to any but some rag
tag colonel of his own kidney?"
My lord laughed again. "Truly, major,
you should go to a dame's school and
learn diplomacy. If we' tell him before
hand what our object is, how could any
rebel of them all defeat it more surely
than by going to Ferguson with a gar
bled message that would make him stand
and fight a losing battle?" ;
"But, my lord â the risk!" cut in the
commissary general.
"There need be none. An. hour after he
sets out we shall send "a mounted detail
after him with an Indian tracker to nose
out his trail. The lieutenant In command
will carry duplicate dispatches. At the
worst, Ireton will guide these followers
to Ferguson's rendezvous; and. so far as
we know, he is the only man who knows
exactly where to find the major."
I had heard enough. Under cover of
the chorus of bravos raised" by Lord
Cornwallis' explication of a plot within
a plot, I lifted the, trap' door and made
my exit as noiselessly as I had come.
Guessing that no time would be lost in
putting the plan into -action, I made
haste to be found inquiring hither and
yon for the commander in chief when my
lord and his suite came down the outer
stair; and when we were met I was
quickly told of my assignment to courier
duty. . . .
"Make your preparations to take the
road within the hour, and report to me at
Friend Stair's," said my lord,, most affa
bly. ."We shall put your new-found loy- .
alty to the test. Cap tain\ Ireton, by in
trusting you with a most important mis
sion. Go with the commissary general
and he will find you your mount and
equipment"
Thus dismissed, I went with Stedman,
and was accorded a more gentlemanly
welcome than my , . overhearings had
given- me leave to expect.
On the way, to the horse paddock the
commissary general told me' of a plan of
his to write a history of the campaign; a
bit of confidence, which set me laughing
inwardly and. wondering if he would put
one John Ireton, sometime of the Scots
Blues and late . captain in her Apostolic
Majesty's Hussars, between the covers
of his book'. 'Tis small wonder that he
did not.'; I have ajnee had the pleasure of
readlng%his history of the great war, and
I flnd it curiously lacking in those.inci
dents which did not redound to the honor
and glory of the king's cause and army
in the field. : ..
Not to digress, however, my makeshift
mount. was soon exchanged for a better;
I was allowed to draw what I would of
accouterments and provender from the
king's stores; and so. to cut it short. I
was presently, at the door of my lord's
headquarters fully equipped and ready
for the road.
-I did hope in those last few moments

more of the frost of unwelcome in her
voice: "To what may we be Indebted for
this honor?" lA " J . '
Now, chilling aÂ« these words were,
they thrilled me to sny finger-tips, for
they were the first shjs had spoken to me
since the night of ray In the
black gorge of the faf-oft! western moun
tains. None the less: they were blankly
unanswerable, and hjtd the v door been
open I should doubtless have vanished as
I had come. Of all *he houses In the
town this was surely the last I should
have run to for refuse had I known the
name of its master, and it was some up
flashing of this thought that helped me
flnd my tongue. r
."I never guessed this was your-fath
er's house," I stammered, bowing low to
match her curtsy. > "I beg you will par
don me and let me go as I came." ,
She laid a hand on the door-knob. ."Is
â is there any one here whom you would
see?" she asked; and "now her .eyes did
not meet mine, and ;I -would think the
chill had melted a little.
"No. I was begging a night's lodging
of a friend whose house is full. . He sent
me here with a note to â ah â to your
father, as I suppose, though in his haste
he did not mention tl)e name." $
She held out her hand. "Give me the
letter." . -/Â¦â¢-..
"Nay." said I; "tl. at would be but
thankless work. Knowing me, 1 your
father must needs conceive It his duty
to denounce me." V â¢.
"Give it me!" she Insisted: this with
an impatient little stamp of the foot and
an upglance of the compelling eyes that
would have constrained me to do a far
fool isher thing had fi-he asked it.
... , So I gave her thi letter and stood
aside, hat In hand, 'while she .read it
There were candles \h their sconces. over
the mantel and she moved nearer to have
the better light. Then suddenlyvthe
beautiful eyes were- alight and warm
and pleading eloquent.
"Oh, why did you' come? Are you â
are you what they" said you were?"'
"A spy? If I am you would- scarce
expect me to confess it even to you."
"'Tis dishonorable â most - dishonor
able!" she cried. "I could respect a brave
soldier enemy; but a spy â "
There was a clattering of hoofs In. the
street and a jingle of sword-scabbards
in the doorstone. I Wheeled to face the
newcomers, determined now to front' it
boldly as a desperate man at bay. But
before the fumbling hands without could
find the door-knob Margery was beside
me, all aflutter in a trembling* fit. of ex
citement.
"Up the stair quickly, pour l'amour de
Dleu! The town is agog with news of
your coming." she whispered, and we
were at the clock landing when the great
door opened and some half dozen king's
officers came in. On the moment I be
held the skulking black figure of the lit
tle pettifogging lawyer and made after
him, but he vanished in the darkness,
leaving me face to fact at an open door
that held my Lord Cornwallis himself.
Ho knew me at a glance.
"Ah. Captain Ireton, 'tis you. is It? We
are well met at last They told me you
were gone to Join the rebels, did they
not'"
Here was an opening for a bold matv
and I took it. A He Is a He be it spoken*
in never mo good a cause, and with my
Lady Madge hating me for It I took it
and, wonder of wonders, concluded my
story to the tune of an appointment to
no less than my lord's personal staff.
An hour later when I again sought
Margery where I was now quartered a3
an honored Austrian officer and where I
had thought to find but an Insecure hid
ing place, she left me in a fury, and I
in hot resentment of her behavior must
(\RPh forth in reckless disregard of the
danger that still lurked about me. I
would take a soldier's chance to acquit
myself or forfeit all else I held dear.
In the market place I heard news of a
star chamber meeting of my Lord Corn
wallis and his staff. Here -was my
chance, if I could but strike one good
blow for the cause.
The old courthouse of. our ; greater.
Mecklenburg- was such [ as some .of you'
may remember; a stout wooden building
raised upon brick pillars to leave a story,
underneath. In the time of the British
occupation this lower story served as a
market house and the public entrance to
the courtroom above was reached -by
steps on the outside. In my boyhood days
this outer stair was the only, one; but
now in wandering aimlessly through the
market place beneath I found another
flight in a corner; the "jury stair,"- they
called it, since it provided the means of,
egress from the Jury box above.
.: The sight of this â¢ Inner stair set me
plotting. Could I make use of it to
come unseen into the council chamber of
Lord Cornwallis and his officers?
The market place was well thronged
with venders and soldier buyers, the pa
triotic Mecklenburgers were not averse
to the turning of an honest penny upon
the needs of their oppressors, as it
seemed. I watched my ohance, and when
there were no prying eyes tq mark it
made the dash up the steps. ;
Happily for the success of the adven
ture there was an angle in the narrow
stair to hide me while I lifted the trap
door in the courtroom floor a scant half
inch and got my bearings. As I had
hoped, the trap opened behind the Jury
box, and I was able to raise it cautiously
and so to draw myself up into the room
above, unseen and unheard.
A peep around the corner of the hig
jury stalls showed me my lord and his
suite gathered about the lawyers' table
.in front of the bar. Of the staff I recog
nized only Stedman, the commissary gen
eral; Tarleton, looking somewhat the
worse for his late illness; Major Hanger,
his -second in command, and the young
Irishman, Lord Rawdon. I
At the moment of my espial, Cornwal
lis was speaking and I drew back to Its
ten, well enough content to be in ear
shot. For if my good angel had timed
my coming I could not have arrived at a
more opportune moment
"What we have to consider, now is how
best to reach Ferguson with an express
Instantly," his lordship was saying.
' Thi : rising of the over-mountain men
is likely to prove a serious matter â not
only for the major, but for the king's
cause in the two provinces. Lacking
posiuve orders to the contrary, Ferguson
will fight â we all know, that; and if he
should be defeated 'twill hopelessly undo
his work among the border loyalists and
set us back another twelvemonth." '
"Then your lordship will order him to
come in with what he has?" said a voice
which I knew for Colonel Tarleton's.
"Instanter, had I a sure man to send."
"Pshaw 1 I can flnd you a hundred

'Twas young Lord Rawdon who aald
this. V ; â¢
."Damn them!" said. his lordship short
ly; "I would sooner trust this new aid of
mine. He comes straight from the > ma
jor and can flnd. his way back again."
â¢ â¢ Tarleton laughed. "I fear we shall
never agree upon him,- my lord. I know
not how he has made his peace with you,
but I do assure you he is as great a ras
cal as ever went unhung. 'Tis true, as
you say, I did not *, go into the particu

- There . was ; silence for : a little space
following the colonel's denunciation
of me, and then my,, lord broke it to

a third made sure of the horre.

But when they had turned the pockets
of my. borrowed ; coat inside out and
ripped the lining and made it other
wise as much the worse for thi'lr mis
handling as it was for wear, the third
man fetched a rope.
"Did you mean that, friend?â about
the hanging?" I asked, wondering If this
should be my loophole of escape from
the life grown hateful.
"Sure enough," Bald - the biÂ« man,
coolly. "You'd besfbe saying your pray
ers." Â¦
I laughed. "Were you wearing my
coat and I yours, you might hang me
and welcome; in truth, you may an it is.
Which tree will you have me at?"
The man stared at me as at one de
mented. Then he burst out in a ituffaw.
"Damme, if you bean't a cool plucked
one! I've a mind to .take you to the
colonel."
"Don't do it. my friend. Though I am
something loth to be snuffed out by the
men of my own side, we need not haggle
over the niceties. Point out yom tree."
"No, by ,God! you're too willing.
What's at the back of all this?"
"Nothing save a decent reluctance to
spoil your sport. Have at it, man, and
let's be done with It"
"Xot If you beg me on your knees.
You'll go to the colonel, I say. and he
may hang you if he sees fit You must
be a most damnable villain to want to
die by the first rope you lay eyes on."
"That is as may be. Who is your
colonel?"
"Nay. rather, who are you?"
I gave my name and circumstance and
was loosed of the hand-grip, thoup.ti the
third xpan dropped the cord and stepped
back to hold me covered with his rifle.
"An Ireton, you say? Not little Jock,
surely!"
"No, big Jock; big enough to lay you
on your back, though you have a hand
as thick as a ham."
He Ignored the ohallenge and stuck to
his text "I never thought to see the son
of old Mad-bull Rodger wearing a red
coat," he said.
"That Is nothing. Many as good a"
Whig as I am has been forced to wear
a red coat ere t^ls, or go barebacked.
But why don't you knot the halter? In
common Justice you should either hang
me or feed me. 'Tis hard upon nooi,, and
I breakfasted early."
"Fall in!", said the big man: and so
I was marched quickly aside from the
road and into the denser thicket) ng of
the wood. -Here my captors blindfolded
me, and after spinning me around to
make me lose the compass points, hur
ried, me away to their encampment,
which was inland from the stream,
tbough not far, for I could still hear, the
dlstance-mlnlshed splashing oi the
water.
When the kerchief was pulled from my
eyes I was standing In the midst of a
mounted riflemen's halt-camp, face to
face with a young officer wearing the
uniform of the colonelcy In the North
Carolina home troops. He was a hand
some young fellow, with curling hair and
trim side whiskers to frame a facfe fine
lined and eagerâ the face of a gentleman
well born and well bred.
"Captain Ireton?" he said; by which I
guessed that one of my captors h?.d, run
on ahead to make report /.' \ ;,
"The same." .1 replied.
"And you are the son of Mr. Justice
Roger Ireton of Appleby Hundred?"
"I have that honor." /
He gave me his hand most cordially.
"You are verv welcome, captain; Davie
is mv name. I trust we may come to
know each other better. You arÂ« in dis
guise, as I take it; do you bring news of
the army?" , .
"On the contrary, I am thirsting for
news," I rejoined. "I and three others
have but now returned from pursuing a
British and Indian powder convoy into
the mountains to the westward. We
have been out five weeks and more.
He looked at me curiously. "You and
three others?" he queried. "Come apart
and tell me about it whilst Poihpey is
broiling the venison. I scent v whole
Iliad in that word of yours, captain Ire
ton." J 0
"One thing first, if you please. Colonel
Davie," I begged. "My companions are
faring forward on the road to Queens
borough. They know naught of my de
tention. Will you send a. man to over
take them with a note from meT
The colonel indulged, me in the most
gentlemanly manner and when^my note
to Jennifer was dispatched we sat to
gether at the roots of a great oak and
I told him all that had befallen our lit
tle rescue party. , He heard me through
patiently, and when the tale was ended
was good enough to say that I had earn*
ed a commission for my part in the af
fair.
-Our spies are thick in Cornwallis'
camp." he said, "but what is needed Is
some master spirit who can plot as. well
as spy for us. Major Ferguson moves
as Cornwallis pulls the strings. Could
we know the major's instructions and de-
Blgns we might cut him off, bring the
Tory uprising to the groand and so
hearten the country beyond measure. I
say we might cut him off, though I know
not where the men would come from to
do it"
"Well?" said I when he paused.
"The preliminary is some better infor
mation than our spies can give us. Now
you have been an ofllcer in the British
service, and â "
Â¦ I smiled. "Truly; and I have the
honor. If you please to call it so. of his
lordship's acquaintance. Also I have
that of Colonel Tarleton and the mem
bers of his staff, the same having tried
and condemned me as a spy at Appleby
Hundred some few weeks before this
chase I have told you of." -
His face fell. "Then, of course, it is
out of the question for you to show
yourself in Cornwallis' headquarters."
I rose and buttoned my borrowed coat.
"On the contrary. Colonel Davie, I am
more than ever at your service. Let me
have a cut of your venison and a feed
for my horse and I shall be at my lord's
headquarters as soon as the nag can
carry me there."
CHAPTER XXXII.
This adventure In the very lion's
mouth, undertaken In sheer recklessness
of love's despair, was destined to be
passing strange Indeed. Fortified with
a letter from Colonel Davie to a %f riend
In Charlotte, who unhappily was all
overcrowded and had passed me on to a
friend of .his in turn. I now stood on the
doorstone of a familiar mansion but one
remove from the corner of the Court
house green. I thought my Huzzax dis
guise complete, but since the street was
busily astir with redcoat officers and
men coming and going, and any squad of

my threadbare courier tale, I - lost . no
time in running up the steps and' ham
mering a peal with the heavy knocker.
Through the sidelights I could see, that
the wide entrance hall was for the mo

ing I had a flitting glimpse of some one
â a little man all in sober black â com
ing down the- stair. There was no im
mediate answer to my. peal, but when I'
would have knocked again the door was
swung back and I stepped quickly within
to find myself face to face with â Mar
gery. Â¦ .- ; .
I know not which of the two of us

do know that I was still speechless and

"I bid you good evening, Captain Ire-
the opposite side, and when the dawn be
gan to gray In the sky ahead we were
well out of the broken mountain region
and into the opener forest of the hill
country.
The sun was yet below the eastern
horizon when we came to the fording or
a larger stream than any we had crossed
In the night. Its course was toward the
sunrise, hence I took it ror some tribu
tary of the Catawba or the Broad.
"Tis the Broad itself," said Ephraim
Teates. In answer to my esking; "and yit
It ain't; leastwise. It ain't the one you
know. *Tls the one the Parleyvoos
claimed in the old war. and they call it
the Frinch Broad."
"But that flows north and westward, If
I remember aright," said I.
"So It do, so it do â in glneral. But
hereabouts 'twill run all ways for Sun
day, by spells."
"If this be the French Broad we are
not yet out of the Tuckasege country, as
I take it"
"Mighty n!gh to it; nigh enough to
make camp for a resting spell. I reckon
ye're a-needlng that same pretty tole'ble
bad. ain't ye, little gal?" this to Mar
gery.
Weary as was, she smiled upon
him brightly, as though he had been her
grandslre and so free to name her how
he pleased.
"I shall sleep well when we are out of
danger. But you must not stop for me,
or for Jeanne, till 'tis safe to do so."
"Safe? Lord love ye, child! 'safe' is a
word beyond us yit, and will be till we
sot you down on your daddy's doorstone.
But we'll make out to give ye a bite and
sup and forty winks o' sleep lmmejltly,
It not sooner, now."
So. on the farther side of the stream
the hunter led the way aside, and when
we were come to a small meadow glade
with good grazing for the horses, he
called a halt, lifted the women from
their saddles and came to help me ease
Dick down. The poor lad was stiff and
sore, having no more use of his joints
than If he were a bandaged mummy; but
the fever- delirium had passed and he
was able to laugh feebly at the tree-limb
contrivance rigged to hold him In the
saddle.
"How did we come out of it. Jack?" he
asked, when we had let him. feel the
comfort of lying flat upon his back on
the soft sward.
"As you see. " We are all here and all
in fair fettle, saving yourself. You're
the heaviest loser."
He smiled, and his eyes languid with
the fever sought out Margery, who
would not come a-nigh while I was with
him.
"That remains to be seen. Jack. If my
dream comes true, I shall be the richest
gainer."
"What did you dream?"
He beckoned me to bend lower over
him. "I dreamed I was sore hurt, and
that she was binding up my bruises and
crying over me."
"'Twas no dream," I said; and with
that I went to help Teates make a bough
shelter for the women, while Uncanoola
was grinding the maize for the breakfast
cakes.
'Tis" not my purpose to weary you with
a day-by-day accounting for all that be
fell us on the way back to Mecklenburg.
Sufflce It to say that we ate and slept
and rose to mount and ride again; thia
for five days and nights, during which
Jennifer's fever grew upon-hlm steadily.
At the close of the fifth day our night
halt was In a deserted log cabin at the
edge of an unfinished clearing in the
heart of the forest. Here Richard's
sickness anchored us. *nd for three full
weeks the Journey paused.
We nursed the lad as best we could for
a fortnight, dosing him with stewings of
such roots and herbs as the Catawba
could find in the wood. Then, when we
were at our wits* ends, and Teates and
I were casting about how we could com
pass the bringing of a doctor from the
settlements, the fever took a turn for
the betterâ of Its own accord, or for Un
canoola's physickings, we knew not
whichâ and at the end of the third week
Dick was up and able to ride again, this
time without the forked stick to hold
him in the saddle.
After this we went on without mishap,
and with no hardship greater than that
of living solely upon the meat victual
provided by the hunter's rifle; and you
who know this plough-dressed region at
this later day will wonder when I write
It down that in all that long faring, or
rather to the last day's stage of it, we
saw never a face of any of our kind, or
of the Catawba's.
You may be sure the month or more
v.e spent thus In the heart of the wild
wood was but a sorry time for me.
While the excitement of the pursuit and
rescue lasted, and later, when anxiety
for Richard filled the hours of the long
days and nights. I was held a little back
from slipping into that pit of despair
which I had digged for myself.
But when the strain was off and Dick
was up and fit again, the misery of it si I
came back with added goadings. I ha4
never dreamed how cutting sharp
'twould be to see these two together day
by day; to see her loving, tender care of
him, and to hear him babble of his love
for her in his feverish vaporlngs. Yet
all this I must endure, and with it a
thing even harder. For, to make it worse,
if worse could be, the shadow of com
plete estrangement had fallen between
Margery and me. True to her word,
given in that moment when I had be
sought her not to speak aloud for her
own safety's- sake, she had never opened
her lips to me: and for aught she said or
did I might hare been a deaf-mute slave
beneath her notice. . -
And as she drew' away from me, she
seemed to draw the closer to Richard
Jennifer, nursing, him alive when he was
at his worst, and giving him all the
womanly care and sympathy a sick man
longs for. And later, when he was fit to
ride again, she had him always at her
side in the onward faring.
As I have said before, this was all as I
would have it. Yet It made me sick In
my soul's soul; and at times I must needs
fall behind to rave it out in solitude,
cursing the day when I was born, and
that other more unfortunate day when I
had reared the barrier impassable be
tween these two.
What wonder, then, that, as we neared
the fighting field of the great war, I grew
more set upon seizing the first chance that
might offer an honorable , escape from
all there heartburnings? 'Twas a
weakness, if you 'choose; I set down
here naught but the simple fact, which
had by now gone as far beyond ex
cusings as the underlying cause of it
was beyond fergtveness.
'Twas on the final day, the day when
we were riding tantivy to reach Queens
borough by evening, that my deliverance
came.' I say deliverance because at the
moment it had the look of a short shrift
and a ready halter.
We had crossed our own Catawba and
were putting our horses at the steep
bank on the outcoming side, when my
saddle slipped. Dismounting to tighten
the girth, I called to the others to press
on, saying I should overtake them
shortly. ,
The promise was never kept I scarce
had my head under the saddle flap be
fore a couple of stout knaves in home
spun, appearing from I know not where,

had come from a city
fifty nilltf away, bringing the very best
recommendations, and had taken hold
cf the school to the satisfaction of
everybody. The trouble was that she
was 20 years old and good looking. She
could r.ut help being good looking any
more than a dozen farmer girls In the
district could help their plain faces,
but scarcely a fortnight had passed
when mot hew and daughters were
sneering and backbiting.
No homely woman, be she married or
eingltt can help being jealous of a
handsome one. In the society of a city
the homely one has the sense to conceal
her feelings, but in the country she at
tends a quiltfng-bee on purpose to
speak her mind.
The thing may be said to have started
with L'nc!? Ben Driggs, chairman of the
school committee. He was a widower,
60 years old. and had been courting the
Widow Hastings, five years his junior,
but v. hat docs he do but t offer the
schoolma'am his calloused Hand and
aged heart before she had fairly got
the school organized.
She promptly refused him. but the
Widow Hastings was her enemy from
that time on, and Uncle Ben heard her

defense. In the course of six weeks

she Is sly and deceitful, and she'll sep

Before New Year's came there was
only one marriagable man for four
miles around who hadn't offered him
self at least once. That was Abner Joy,
a man of 30, who had a farm of his
own and a sister for a housekeeper. He
had admired, but so secretly and mod
estly that Miss Lee had not suspected.
No one mistrusted his feelings until
one evening when there was a paring
bee at Uncle David Saunders". The
gathering included over forty people,
old and young, and as it was Miss
Lee's week to board with the Saunders'
Bhe *)ught to have been there. She was
not, however, and, though the night
had come , on with a storm, nobody
worried about the schoolma'am â not
even Abner. When he failed to find her
there he argued that she bad stopped
at a nearer place. In the gathering
were several girls and women with
spiteful tongues, and several young
Miss Lee had turned down another
widower and two young men, and thus
made more enemies. Several engage
ments were in danger of being broken
because Jim, Joe or John would insist
that the teacher was the daintiest
daisy that ever called up a class in
geography. The girl knew that she?
was making enemies and being slurred
and slandered, but as It was not her
fault and she had no remedy she main
tained silence. This subjected her to
criticism again. As Hannah Jones re
marked at Mrs. Doolittle's quilting
bee:
"Iâ I guess I will. If youâ you want
me. to." she replied, as she drove away,
and three months later she did.
"Talk love ? ; Not ; a Â¦ word. . I j know

Half an hour later he was inquiring
at Taylor's If Miss Lee was, there, and
again he stopped, at FUker's. But hs

with her things on, and the open stove

Â¦zniling, tantalizing face that she knew
bo we::
Candida's mirror smiled back at her.
It was a tiny mirror with a shabby
frame, but it held the loveliest and
most famous picture in all Alta Cali
fornia. The portrait was that of a
sixteen-year-old girl, strongly built and
exquisitely rounded as those Castilian
girls of old California were â the com
plexion a pure Castilian olive witheut
a tinge or rose: the eyes a sparkling.
\ivld black; the hair as black as thÂ»
eyes, a splendid mass coiled high and
caught with a comb.
"Ah. but it is of use, even if Filiberto
is & mere nobody. What do you think,
lovely Senorita?" she said to the face
in the mirror. The face laughed back
at her.
Candles were fastened to the wall
on each side of the miror, so that a
strong light was thrown on the face
therein. Candida could watch it to
pood advantages as it grew lovelier un
der her skillful touch.
A lock of hair did not suit her. She

ter to accompany him to the fandanpn
to-night. She had watched in vain for
the message. She saw her match-mak
ing blighted after being brought to a
critical point.
"Where's the girl?" growled a ter
rific voice. It was that of her husband.
"Phe"e dressing."
"What for. when she's going with no
body but Yorba? She had as well wear
her working gown."
"Ah DJos â after all cur hopes!" Se
ncra Barrajas wrung her fat hands..
"It's of no avail to whimper about

"My stubbornness made me marry
you." put in the Senora,
"And you pot better than you de

crumbling like a thunderstorm.
Candida, adjusting her comb, heard it
all and smiled.
"Ah, Madre mia, how blind you are In

took a note from her bosom.

Candida tucked the note in het bosom
again. It would be fun to show it to
Flliberto when they had a little time
alone.
"Tell Flliberto I'll be ready in a min
ate." she called as she heard the light
hoofs of Mia.
She moved the comb to fhe other side.
then back to its original position. Be
hind her ear she fastened a great crim
son rose.
"You are lovelier than ever." Flli
berto whispered as she pave him a
glimpse of the picture she was. Then
she threw a white mantilla ever her
head and shoulders, her facs and the
rose peeping out from the snowy lace.
"Good evening. Mia." she f-aid, pat
tins the little horse's nose. It save a
happy whinny, for It knew Candida.
Her father and mother came from the
house and said a surly pood evening to
the handsome young Spaniard. To them
he was entirely objectionable In that he
had no property, no Influential father,
nothing but his own cleverness and
courage to depend upon. Furthermore,
they strongly suspected their daughter
of preferring him to the shrewd old po
litical fox to whom they were trying to
marry her.
"Permit me to thank you both for in
trusting your daughter to my care to
night," he said bltthely. In spite of the
frowns that greeted him.
Candida patted the restless pony
again. "Are you in a hurry. Mia?" she
Â¦aid. "Come, Flliberto. we must start.
Mia says she will not wait."
The girl put her little red-slippered
foot Into the stirrup. Flliberto helped
her as she sprang, and she was perched
aloft in the gala day saddle, all carved
and be-stlvered. With a bow to the old
people he sprang up behind her, as was
the Callfomlan custom.
He reached forward to adjust thÂ»
reins. Mia fumed to be off. But the
word had not been given when a clatter
cf hoofs sounded beyond the house.
All turned to see who the arrival was.
The hoofs clattered more sharply as the
rallop slowed. Up rode the Coman
dante. /
At the sight of Candida about to ride
away he turned white with anger, as
his way was.
"Ah, senoxita. may I Inquire who your
physician may be, that your ankle heals
so quickly?"
The father and mother stood silent.
looking from one to the other. Suspi
cion, fear.- rage -were creeping upon
them. It was no time to parry, the glr!
knew.
"There Is but one physician who can
heal every hurt." she replied. "He is
Love. I am In his charge. Off. Mia."
And the pony was away with them.
"You mean it?" said Flliberto.
Bhe only tossed him a teasing laugh
now. "How Mia flies!" she sa'd. dodg
ing his question. "There are the lights
of the fandango."
Far away glittered the brilliant lights
In a great ranch house. Suddenly the
road divided. At the end of one branch
were the lights of the gay ball; at the
end of the other, one lamp shone from
the Mission.
"Listen!" said Flliberto, and stopped
the horse. A strange blending of sounds
came to their ears; guitar and violin
sounded faintly from the left: from the
right came the faraway chime of the
Mission bell.
"To the left lies the dance," he said
slowly. "After Itâ home again, a storm
of wrath, you and I separate forever."
"Yes," she said, the merriment gone
out of her eyes.
"To the right." he went on, "Father
Juan, our old priest and friend. He
knows us and loves us. He will marry
us to-night."
"Oh!" she cried with a little shudder.
"Shall It not be the right road?"
"Ohâ I'm afraid â I can'tâ"
"Say the right."
She hesitated, perplexed. Then she
cried, "I know, I'll let Mia decide. We
Â¦hall see which way she chooses."
She pushed his hands from the reins.
drew Mia to the middle of the fork and
Â¦topped her. "Now go, Mia," she said.
The horse flung up her head and sal
loped into the dark road on the rlzht.
"Mia, you shall feed on sugar lumps
for the rest of your life," Flliberto said.
It waa not for many years that Can
dida made a confession to her husband.
"I tweaked the right rein." she owned
then. "I was so afraid Mia might
make a mistake."

"Poor Elizabeth," said their hostess.
"But th'e Van i Horn's left," cried a

Suddenly Elizabeth laughed, a gay

Constance let the salmon pass, and

wisdom to It.
"Stephen, you are a dear," she said.

OSWUjaiGSBa HE maid knocked
nF* Â¦ ffl'âanr/j gently upon Miss
fcH RJ3 fX? Catherwood's door
D -Ivt K? and handed in a
| 3sf! iSJH card. Miss Catber
islt Is wood looked at it
pfcfcw^-.^, ffi" and tossed it to the
"Oh, the dickens!" she said frankly.
It will be seen at once that, although
Miss Catherwood was a young lady of
beauty and chax-mlng personal char
acteristics, Â«she had decided opinions
about various things. One of the
things was Mr. Anthony Wadsworth.
â¢who, as appeared, was waiting below
for an audience with her.
"The dickens!" reiterated Miss
Catherwood, "I suppose I shall have
to see him." Miss Catherwood's' mother
happened to be within earshot.
"Who is ltr* she Inquired. She waa
informed. "Dear me," said Miss
Catherwood's mother, "why, Mr. An
thony Wadsworth has always appeared
to me to be a very proper young man."
"That's just the trouble, mother,"
returned Miss Catherwood, "he's too
proper. He's too conventional. He's
a tissue-paper man."
"Dear me," answered her mother;
"heâ he doesn't look like a tissue
paper, man."
"Oh, I know," petulantly responded
the young lady. "I know; he's Just
about the proper weight and proper
height, and his shoulders are just the
proper breadth. He's like a patternâ
a fashion plate. He's Just unbeara
ble."
Miss Catherwood's mother, who
could not quite reconcile her daugh
ter's premises with her conclusion,
sighed. Her daughter swept out of
the room and went downstairs.
Mr. Anthony Wadsworth rose as she
entered and bowed in a quaint old
fashioned way. He was flustered and
embarrassed â and there was good
reason for it. For Mr. Anthony Wads
worth was there for a purpose, and his
purpose ultimately became apparent.
He was there to propose to Miss
Catherwood, and he proposed. He
didn't do It very well, and Miss Cather
wood, who had had a proposal or two
before, as she listened to him, made
mental comparisons that were un
favorable to this particular suitor.
"Don't â don't give me your answer
to-night," implored Mr. Wadsworth,
the perspiration standing out upon his
brow; "wait â wait until to-morrow
night. Take time."
Miss Catherwood, who would have
preferred to end It at once, assented.
She said with all the coldness she
could summon to her aid that she
would consider it: that she would wait
until to-morrow night. And she had
a reason for it. She had an engage
ment with Tommy Boggs for the next
night; and she Intended to write a
short note f qr Mr. Wadsworth " to re
ceive when he came. That would be
the end of Mr. Wadsworth.
She started with Tommy about 7
o'clock In the evening, in order to get
a choice seat in the ladies' quarters.
She left the fatal note with her moth
er, with Instructions to hand it to Mr.
Wadsworth; she told her mother 'what
It was. Her mother, who was a very
tender-hearted .old lady, met Mr.
Wadsworth at the doorâ he came at 8
o'clock sharp â and Mr. Wadsworth
was so downhearted when he found
that Miss Catherwood was out that
the old lady thought) she would' keep
the note to herself.
"I'llâ I'll call to-morrow evening,"
said Mr. Wadsworth, tremulously;
"she probably forgot last night that
she had thisâ this engagement for to
night, althoughâ. I'll call to-morrow
night."
Down in the Fourteenth Ward in
Bailey's hall Tommy Boggs and Miss
Catherwood were having the time of
their lives. The campaign was In full
blastâ election was wear at hand. Miss
Catherwood kept her eyes on the
speaker, and she listened to every, word
he said.
"Isn't he fine?" she exclaimed to
Tommy. "It's Just great to be a man
like thatâ a man who can sway men."
There was a burst of applause from
something more than one-third of .the
crowd as the man upon the platform
paused In his. speech at the proper
place. He was a paid campaign orator,
and he was good at that. But there
was Just a bit of dissatisfaction visi
ble upon the faces* of the crowd. A
man near Miss Catherwood moved
about uneasily.
"I am three years older than Mar
jorie."
.
,
'
ened. It never came true. And beside*.
I am three years older than Marjorie.
Would you think I waa 26, Steve?"
Stephen turned the rimless eye
glasses on her with cheerful scrutiny.
"Thirty-nine," he said pleasantly.
','How long were you engaged to him?**
"Two weeks and a half."
She nodded her head.
"It's a bad time of. year for engage
gagements. Dead leaves and general
dampness and all that. I always choose
early summer. It don't hang on the
nerves so. Try June next time. Con."
She turned to him with sudden Im
patience.
"It isn't that I don't want to see
Marjorie happy, or that I care about
last October. I am afraid she will
waken as I did. He la so perfectly
colorless In temperament that It la
simply infuriating. A girl doesn't seek
a new engagement every summer,
Steve. I never waa engaged before,
and don't you know when you've been
looking forward to something ever
since you could chase butterflies, to
falling In love with the one man who
t was to be your prince of dreams, and
all at once you think you've found
him, and you love him and promise to
be his wife, and nothing happens at
all, why, you feel like the boy who
spent all his Fourth of July money for
one skyrocket, and then it wouldn't go
off."
"Better said boy than the boy who
shoots the merry rocket and then geta
unmercifully batted with the fallen
stick," said Stephen gently and philo
sophically.
"Haworth was Just the same. He
never seemed to understand how won
derful it all was to me, or how a girl
wants It to be wonderful. We were
good, stanch friends and comrades,
and he cared for me. I know he did,
last October, but there waa the rose
mist missing. He wasn't my prince
of dreams. He was just himself.
One likes the rose, mist of life, you
know, even if one knows they are all
Illusion. They give a glory to the path
behind and the hills ahead."
"But they aren't worth a cent close
around," said Stephen. "Rose mists
aren't worth a rap floating around
one's self, when one la busy living to
day. Seems to me I wouldn't want any
illusions around the one I loved best,
either. And I don't think Marjoria
would. Haworth's a splendid old chap.
We've been friends for over ten years.
He's given me many a hand grip over
tough places in the first days when I
was only a fresh kid fighting for a
place In the crowd, and he's always the
same. It may be monotonous, but It's
mighty comforting. Perhaps after ten
years even you might be glad to find a
man unchanged."
"Perhaps." She smiled bitterly, but
bravely still. . x
He looked Into her eyes Interestedly.
"Honest, don't you care, Con?"
She hesitated.
"Not as long as It Is Marjorie, and
she will be happy." Her voice was
low. "Of course one may still remember
the prince of dreams, when the dreams
never came true."
"Haworth waa up to my place last
night and we talked sense. No rose
mists or dreams, just plain sense. And
I told him that I was going to marry
the dearest girl In the world. If she'd
have me."
"Stephen!** Her face was radiant,
her tone tender and maternal In Its
quick sympathy. "I'm so glad for
you."
"If she'd have roe." repeated Stephen
modestly. "And Haworth opened up
and told me a few things about a cer
tain dearest girl whom he had wanted
to marry, but she wouldn't have him.
He wasn't bitter, you understand, or
wearing crape for any dead hopes. He
Just told me. He doesn't quite under
stand why she gave him up. but he
believes she loved him, and that some
â¢day the world will seem lonesome and
strange to her, and the rose mists' she
cared for will have faded. Then he
thinks she may be glad to find him
unchanged."
"Stephen! 1* She turned her head and
met Haworth's gaze. His eyes were
restful and steady, , as she had loved
best to remember them.
"And I told.him." continued Stephen
mildly, "not to wait for the lonesome
time, to take the day he was sure of.
And he said he thought he'd try to
night."
"But Marjorie!"
Her face flushed and her lips half
parted. She was still looking beyond
the yellow chrysanthemums.
Stephen smiled across the table.
"The dearest girl in the world said
_ yes just half an hour ago," he said.
w
Â«Hffie
And when he finished the crowd
surged up to the platform and literally
overwhelmed him. Miss Catherwood,
when it was all over, drew a sharp
breath. "To think," she walled to her
self, "that I have refused such a man."
The next night Mr. Anthony Wads
worth called upon her. She met him
at the door. She was radiant.
"Iâ I've come to| ask your pardon,"
he said contritely.
"For what?" she inquired.
"Youâ you haven't forgotten," he
stammered, "about â about myâ my girl
last nljjht. I â I don't know why- I
said it. I felt reckless, I suppose."
She laughed Joyously. "That," she
said, "is the only part Â«f your speech
last night that I had forgotten. It
was Just superb."
He laughed. "Dear me," he an
swered, "that's Â¦ nothing; every fellow
livpoMtlcs has to do that. That's not
the question," he went on. "There's
something else."
"Wâ what?" she Inquired timidly.
"I want to know," he continued,
"whether 1 â whether my â my girl is go-
Ing to turn me down to-night. If so,
I've got a meeting in the Fifth Dis
trictâthe boys are waiting for me."
Miss Catherwood stepped toward
him and held out her* hand. "They
can't have you." she answered gently,
"Anthony Wadsworth, Alderman." ;
This, In black and white, amounts to
nothing. But it was the way that
Wadsworth said it that took. "Ha,
ha, ha!" roared the crowd; "Imagine
Tony's girl a-turnin' of him down. Go
on, Tony." . Â¦
Mr. Anthony Wadsworth raised his
hand high in the air and started in.
Suddenly he stopped. He was looking
directly into the eyes of Miss Cather
wood herself.. He turned white and
then he turned red. Then he turned
away, and apparently forgot her. And
then he started in. He started in as
only . Alderman Anthony Wadsworth
knew how. Miss Catherwood had
thought the campaign orator had
talked - as no other man could talk.'
That was because she had never heard
Mr. Anthony Wadsworth. With one
hand In his trousers pocket and the
other in the air, the. Alderman walked
UP and down the stage, casting into the
very faces of his audience, humor,
pathos,- expletive, vituperation, sar
casm, .congratulation â everything..
"Tony, Tony. Tony, Tony!" yelled
the crowd. The big man stepped for
ward.- "Mr. Tony Wadsworth." he ex
claimed, by way of Introduction, and
pandemonium broke loose. Mr. An
thony Wadsworth stepped forward a
pace or two. "Ain't he corkln'," said
the loquacious individual near Miss
Catherwood, "and he always comes
here In a swallow-tail suit â he knows
what's what, he does."
Wadsworth nodded, and the crowd
fcecame instantly silent. "I didn't In
tend to be here to-night," he explained.
He hesitated. "The fact is," he went
on, "I had an engagement with my
girl and she turned me down. I didn't
have any other place to go and I came
here."
"Aw ," he - said, "why don't they
bring on the Alderman? What the
's the use o' this?" "Â¦'Â¦
Another man nudged him. "The
Alderman," he explained, "ain't a-goin'
to be on hand to-night."
As he . si>oke a stout man entered
from behind the scenes and stepped up
toward the front of the stage. He was
cheered loudly.
"That must be the Alderman," whis
pered Miss Catherwood to Tommy
Boggs. But he wasn't. He whispered
for a moment to the speaker, and the
speaker nodded and shook his head.
The big man raised Ms hand.
."Ladies and gents," he said, "we'd
fully expected to have the Alderman
with us here to-night, but I'm givin'
it to you straight that-\;"
He was Interrupted by a mighty
yell. "Hi, hi, hi!" yelled the crowd:
"what ye - givln' us? Look behind
you!"
The big man turned and everybody
looked and howled. "Hooray! hooray!
hooray!*' velfed the crowd. Miss Cath
erwood looked with the rest, : and then
she gave a little gasp. For the man
that the whole crowd was looking and
yelling at was a young man attired in
a full-dress suit. He was bowing, with
conventional stiffness, right and left.
And he was none other than Mr. An
thony Wadsworth.

there should be some temporary ob-'

These temporary obstacles not only
gave spice to the love affairs them
selves, but they afforded hardworking
novelists like himself a fair chance to
earn a living. Now he was finding a
lifetime of theory deftly upset by a few
moments of practice. His courtship of
and engagement to Anne Lorrimer had
been a very, commonplace affair, but
he was so much In love that he could
not see the . advantage of j obstacles,
temporary or otherwise. They had met

promptly decided that the match would
be a good one. Now the inevitable rift
In the lute had appeared in Anne's jeal
ousy of the heroine whom Riker had
painted in his newest and most suc
cessful book, "A Pair of Slippers."
"Of course, she may have been home
ly and all that," said Anne, with an air
of dissatisfaction, "but you didn't paint
her as homely. You gave her, with a
lavish hand, all the graces and beauties
that a woman could possess andâ what

i "When I was 111 this spring I occupied
a room In one of the" uptown hospitals
and, despite j the calls of my friends,
time hung very heavily on my hands.
My nurse was one of those efficient
machines .which school and hospital
training turn out, and I was ready to
turn to anything for relaxation and en
tertainment. Just across the areaway
from my Â¦ window ;was I an apartment
house, ; and I used to hear some one
singing there and : would close my eyes
and listen to the music. One day some
of my friends had brought me a mag
nificent clump of lilies of the valley and
it occurred to. me that It would be nice
to send some of them to the girl who
made the music* I knew that it would
be useless .to try and enlist the services
of my matter-of-fact nurse in trying to
find out her name, so determined on
another plan. I had never seen . the
girl, but the voice seemed -to float out
of a window just opposite me^ i
"I was becoming convalescent rapidly
and, casting about for something to
weight the bouquet with, my eyes fell
on a pair of slippers. I stuck the flow
ers in the toe of one of the slippers and
hurled it across with all my force. I
saw it sail in the window and then,
the exertion proving too much for me,
I fainted and fell on the floor by the
window. I had [ counted on seeing the
girl pick up the flowers, 'but I fainted
too quickly. *
Â¦ "I was removed to another room .
which looked out on an inner court,
and I never heard the. voice again. I
recovered from the relapse quickly, and
while I was in bed I blocked out the
synopsis of my romance. The hero,
as you know, I made an art student
in Paris, and had him fall in love with
a girl across the way on account of
the girl's voice. He threw her flowers
just as I did, and they got to know each
other in that way.
"But both the young artist and the
young singer were poor; they drifted
away from Paris and lost the sight,
but not the memory, of each other.
Ten years later the artist, now on the
top wave of success, went" to hear a
new opera sung. by a new prima donna,
of whom great things are told. The
prima. donna 'turns out to be 'the girl
at the other window.' The artist rushes
out of the opera-house, buys some lilies
of the valley and a ' pair of slippers,
sticks the flowers into the toe of one
of the slippers and hurls It Â¦ on the
stage. She. recognizes him by the sign,
'they marry,' and live happy ever after
ward. "And that's all there is to the lit
tle story ' which the critics Jumped on
me for* giving such a prosaic title as 'A
Pair of Slippers," "' \ -'
"And you are Â¦ sure that If you met
the girl to whom you threw the flowers
you would never be tempted to try and
turn your romance into reality?" asked
Anne.
"I have enough romance to last mo
for a lifetime."
"But suppose the girl waa really*' a
very nice girt and a very pretty girl?"
"Makes no ' difference."
"Did you know that I lived in the
apartment house back of the hospital
at which you were a patient?" Anne's
expression was rather mischievous.
"No, I didn't. Then it Is possible that
you know the woman with the con
tralto voice. Do you?"
"Yes, I knew her v In fact, I have the
slipper and the bunch of lilies of the

Some Genuine
Darky Poetry
Stories, the tale will bear reading any
day in the year. It Is a simple little
story that makes the reader feel better
for having come across it. When an
author Is able to make the reader, of
many books keep in his mind for many
days the nebulous image of a wide
eyed little darky with ideals then that
author has not written In vain. This
has Ruth McEnery Stuart done.
George Washington Jones is little,
orphaned and irredeemably black. His
head is full of the grand tales'told him
by his grandfather of how that worthy
was one time sent to a beautiful "fairy,
lady" as a Christmas gift long before
the war. To the bright little head of
George Washington there comes, there
fore, the brilliant idea of making a
Christmas present of himself to some
equally lovely mistress and thereby fol
low in the path of* his honored grand r
parent. But when the 'little nigger
starts out to make of himself a "Christ
mas gif," ho finds that. In these de
generate days of ours little colored
kids offering to give themselves away
are considered beggars.
How the little fellow suffered one re
buff after another until he was glad to
nestle to the bosom of a kind old child
less mammy Is told with words which
leave but ! a narrow frontier between
tears and laughter. Then of George
Washington's final triumph and of his
service in the home of the old lady who
was once the charge of that very idyl
lic grandfather the details are re-'
counted. It Is a triumph for the reader
as well as â¢ for George Washington
Jones, for the reader feels as if .the lit
tle kinky. pate Is next of kin before he
finishes with him.

out over the . Jangling keys of our
neighbor's piano that Job's bodily [dis
comforts haven't been a marker to thÂ«
mental anguish that has been the lot
of all, right-minded individuals. .'Al
most drowned out -by this- persistent
howling of musical bosh, yet sounding
with ; a pure, sweet note ; to ., those with
ears ; r attuned, have been the genuine
darky melodies of the darky poet,
Paul Lawrence Dunbar. ; Now we have
another collection of his poems, pub
lished in an attractive holiday form,
under the title of "When Malindy
Sings."
Those of us who have had the rare
good fortune to have lived down in the
South, where the darky is still a
darky and not a "culiud gemmun,"
speak of the real music that there is in
the hearts of the typical south of Dixie
negroes. Their song Is - spontaneous,
bubbling; their rhymes have often the
ring of true poesy. To catch this ster
ling worth and give It to American
literature at its real value is the work
of- Paul -Lawrence Dunbar. Right well
has he accomplished his task; but let
us all hope that there remain yet a
great many more songs for the young
negro poet to sing.
In the present volume there, are
bits of verse ranging In senti
ment from rollicking banjo songs to
pathetic reflectlbna upon the loss of
dear ones. The darky's feelings lie
very, near the surface and Dunbar has
deftly caught the strange blend of sun
shine and shadow which Is the charac
teristic of his race. So few , and so
simple are. the words necessary to ex
press the deepest thoughts. .Witness
the following, stanza from a little poem
entitled "The Memory of Martha."
"Down by. de road de shadders grows,

For many years Monsanto and Lan

the student by constant practice and
repetition in Spanish, and to this end
the Spanish examples are made as nu
merous as possible. The advance in
linguistics, and the new rules of accen
tuation promulgated by the Spanish
Academy, have made a revision of the
book necessary. The original form oj
the work has been retained so far as
possible, but such grammatical state

cast. The Spanish text Is presented In
accordance with the latest rules for
orthography and accent.

and Mr. Major is ready to begin. Set
ting Is of no great consequence â a
baronial manor or a log cabin can be
conjured into the piece with equal
dexterity. The historical atmosphere
need only be some other time than the
present. Now, with everything read}',
the story starts out and with a slow
and graceful movement unwinds Itself
to the length required of the modern
novel and then with a faint rattling of
the cogs and wheels comes to a digni

/KNOW a little old maiden lady
who welcomes â¢ a new story by
Charles Major as she would a val
entine from an eighteen-year-old boy.
She has seen fifty summers and away
back in the twentieth she had her only
little love affair. In her second
maidenhood she lives in a hallowed
memory of this love affair of thirty
years gone by. Her faded cheeks will
glow a trifle when she grows reminis
cent and she will simper a coy little
simper when the tender passion is men
tioned. Next to discovering a Â¦ new
breakfast food or hearing of some
happy Instance of two bleeding hearts,
this little old maiden lady would rather
read Charles Major's books than any
thing else in the whole world. "They
are Just so lovely."
So it will be a red-letter day for the
little maiden lady when "A Forest
Hearth" is put into her hands by some
ill-advised but well meaning friend.
For If ever there waB a love tale pre
pared especially for single and senti
mental ladies of many summers, this
is that one. To invalids taking the
rest cure who must be shielded from
excitement it must surely prove a gen
tle sedative. The growing girl of the
household will be happy to have it read
to her by the impressionable house
maid.

the ;whole thing away; of course, the.
little playmate giÂ»ws stronger in his
affections with the years. But there
is a man twice the age of Rita who
fain would clasp her to his bosom. So
affected is he by her very presence that
"his heart was filled with Joy, his face
beamed with pleasure and his scalp
was suffused by a rosy hue." Alas,
the race is not for him .-and .the 'only,
thing he can do in the story is to give
the hero an engagement ring when the'
time for that stage property is full ripe.'
But it is in order 'for a' little excite-,
ment by the time chapter six comes
around and so the town bully spies the
hero saluting the heroine with a soulful
kiss ur>on the banks of the Wabash.
Beinp: "not full but comfortable" at
the time the town bully attempts a

It is a sad' failing of some authors

flood-tide of the romantic novel. It

TWO of our San Francisco literati
have harked back to the good old
days of the earliest story tellers
to find the form for a tale upon which
they have collaborated. "The Reign of
Queen Isyl," by Gelett Burgess and
Will Irwin. has the old stilted pro
logue and high sounding chapter head
ings of an eighteenth century romance,
but sparkles with the most up-to-date
'slangr and is replete with modernisms
which are more startling in contrast to
their archaic setting.
Again, like some of the old Italian
romances the book contains tales with
in a tale. Upon the skeleton plot of a
carnival queen of San Jose, who was
spirited away upon the eve of her coro
nation to have a pretender sit upon the
throne of mirth, the two authors have
stretched a web of stories from the
mouths of the principal characters
which divide the honors of interest on
the part of the reader with the thread
of the main narrative.
There Is enough mystery to the royal

Herein lies the great difference be
tween London, the new writer on the
elums. and Riis, the man of years' ex
perience. Earnestly as Mr. London
may have sought after the truth and
diligently as he may have striven to
get to the bottom of things, he betrays
too ready a tendency to Jump at con
clusions and draw deductions from the
thing* which fit his theory. Within
the short space of a few months" time,
London endeavored to familiarize him
self with the life to which Riis tM de
voted years of study. Naturally, he
oouid not know his Whitechapel like
Riis knows his Bleecker street and
Chatham Square, but with his insuffi
cient knowledge, London has gone to
the lengths of making sweeping gener
alisations upon social questions which
Riis has never voiced.
London approached Whitechapel with
preconceived ideas of the rights of
man and the duties of governments,
bora of his earlier socialistic studies.
When he discovered so many thou
sands of creatures who did not enjoy
these rights he attributed all of their
wrongs to a decayed Bociety, which he
declares Is only fit for the scrap heap.
His marine fireman, who spends his
earnings In beer, is not held to account
per re for the life that is his, but is
merely one of the unfortunate atoms
ground to dust by this self-same de
crepit machine of society.
Rlis has shown that -the hopelessly
poor are stubborn In their wretchedness
and neglect or even resent opportuni
ties for their betterment. To his eyes
the degradation of the great cities'
poor is due in great measure to an
Inborn disinclination to aspire to any-
Since Jack London has suddenly ven
tured into the field of slum literature
with "The People of the Abyss," he
roust naturally be subject to a com
parison with an acknowledged student
of the poor such as Riis. Yet so few
points have the two In common that
comparison is almost defied.
London has attacked his subject
with an ax. He is a strong man, a
etrong writer; perhaps he could not
approach any subject with a whit less
energy than he used In climbing Chil
coot Pass. But his ardor In attacking
the elums of the East End of the great
city, his nameEake, is so strong as to
color his entire book with a very per
ceptible bias. He evidently knew that
everything was all wrong in London
and he went there to prove It to himself
and to the world.
When this keen-sighted Dane was
first thrown in contact with the sordid
life of the New York tenements it was
in the capacity of a police reporter for
a. metropolitan newspaper. He did
not jjo down into the elums with a
fore-orÂ«2ained determination to catch a
hurried glimpse of the muck and the
reek p.nd then to return to the pure air.
there to write tomes upon the shocking
lives of the poor. But it was his daily
duty, the price of his bread and butter,
which held RMs down to the Mulberry
Bend and Mott street year In and year
out until the life about him became a
part of him and its darkest corners
were disclosed to him. Then he began
to write and to work for these people
whose every life shadow he knew.
Riis did not give vent to diatribes
upon the enormities of the existence
which these people supported; he did
not mch into print with scathing con
demnations of government in general
and the Iniquities which were suffered
as a result of its pernicious machina
tions*. On the contrary, be wrote little
etories of real life in the tenementsâ
stories which reflected conditions as
they were without any comments by
the writer. He gave to the reading
world truthful transcript* from the
real lives of real people.
Such a collection of short tales is his
latest book, "The Children of the Tene
ments." Written originally for the
New York Sun. Riis" paper, and for
the Century Magazine, these little
stories are of a merit well deserving
the distinction of book covers. Some
are pathetic, some In a humorous vein,
but all are told with a simplicity
which Impresses the reader first and
above all of their truth.

Ing fancy and the good people who in

It possesses right at the present time.

vigorous portrayal of ugly facts. Both
are good books.
"What influence it has been which
has moved so many of the present-day
writers to champion the cause of the
hopeless poor it is hard to determine.
Is it that the old Rousseau idea of the
brotherhood of man has become rein
carnate after a hundred years of dor

of socialism has crept into the channels
of literature? Is there greater charity

Kach of these- writers will give a dif

Of the Americans who have devoted
their pens to the uplifting of the lot
of the poor, Jacob Riis is pre-eminently

not only written things, but has actual
ly done them. Through his twenty-five
years' daily contact with the sore spots
of New York he has gained a knowl
edge of the things whereof he writes

The flooring was loose in the corner,
and plank by. plank the two savants
raised it and leaned It against the wall.
Below there was a square aperture
and a stair of old stone steps which led
away down Into the bowels of the
earth.
"I had some very narrow escapes at
first, but I have gradually learned to

coat, with 'a lantern hanging from his

Kennedy, stepped out of the shadow to
meet him.

"I hope you left no clew as to where

The German came back to the stove,
and, laying down his basket, he sank
into his chair once more. . .
"May I have another cigar?" said he.
"Thank you very much. I never smoke

KENNEDY sat thinking, with his
fine forehead wrinkled and his
fingers playing with his Ions,
lair mustache.
"You have given yourself away. Bur
ger," raid he at last. "Your words can
only apply to one thing. You have dis
covered a new catacomb."
"Quite so. There is no mystery about
that. I have discovered a new cata
comb."
â¢Where?"
"Ah, that is rny secret, my deer Ken
nedy. SuSce It that it is so situated
that there is not one chance in a mil
lion of any one else coming upon it.
Its date is different from that of any
known catacomb, and it has been re
served fur the burial of the highest
â¢Christians, so that the remains and the
relics ore quite different from anything
which has ever been seen before."
Kennedy loved his subject with a
love which was almost a mania â a
love which held him true to it amidst
all the distractions which come to a
wealthy and dissipated young man.
"Look here. Burger," eaid he earnest
ly. "1 assure you that you can trust me
most implicitly in the matter."
Burger smiled thoughtfully over his
cigar.
"I have noticed, friend Kennedy."
said he, " that when I want informa
tion over any point you are not al
ways eo ready to supply It."
"What you are driving at I cannot
imagine," said the Englishman: "but
if you mean that you will answer my
question about the catacomb if I an
swer any question which you may put
to me, I assure you that I will cer
tainly do bo."
"Well, then," said Burger, leaning
luxuriously back in his settee and puf
fing a blue tree of cigar smoke into
the air, "tell me all about your rela
tions with Miss Mary Saunderson."
Kennedy sprang up in his chair and
glared angrily at his impassive com
panion.
"What the devil do you mean?" he
cried. "What sort of a question is this?
You may mean it as a joke, but you
never made a worse one."
"No. I don't mean It as a Joke." said
Burger, simply. "I am really rather
Interested in the details of the matter.
I don't know much about the world
and women and social life and that
sort of thing, and such an incident
has the fascination of the unknown for
me. I know you and I know her by
eight â I had even spoken to her once
or twice. I ehould .very much like to
bear from your own lips exactly what
It was which occurred between you."
"I won't tell you a word."
"That's all right..* It -.was -.only my.
whim to see if you. would give up a se-.
eret as easily *as 'you expected me to
give up my secret of the new cata
comb. 'You "'wouldn't, and I didn't ex

*JNo; wait a bit. Burger." said Ken-'
ne4y: "this, is really,- a ridiculous ca
price of yours to wish to know about
an old love affair which has burned out
months ago.' *You know we look upon
a man -who -kisses and tells as the
greatest coward and villain possible."
"No. Twickenham."
"You must excuse my curiosity, my
dear Kennedy, and you must put it
down to my ignorance of the world.
No doubt it is quite a simple thing to
persuade a young lady to go off with
you for three weeks or so. and then
10 hand her over to her own family at â
what did you call the place?"
"Twickenham."
"Quite soâ at Twickenham. But it
is something so entirely -outside of my
own experience that I cannot even im
agine how you set about it. For ex
ample, if you had loved, this girl, your
love could hardly disappear in three
v.eeks, so I presume that you could not
have loved her at all. But if you did
not love her, why should you make this
great scardal, which has damaged you
and ruined her?"
Kennedy looked moodily into the red
eye of the stove.
"That's a logical way of looking at it.
certainly," said he. "Love is a big
word, and it represents a good many
aifferent shades of feeling I liked her
and â well, you say you have seen her â
you know how charmingly she could
look. But still I am willing to admit,
looking back, that I could never have
really loved her."
"Then, my dear Kennedy, why did
you do it?"
"The adventure of the thine had a
great deal to do with it."
"What! Are you so fond of adven
tures!"
'Where would the variety of life be
without them? It was for an adven
ture that I first began to pay my at
tention to her. I've chased a trood der.1
of game in my time, but there's no
chase like that of a pretty woman.
There was the piquant difficulty of it,
also, for, as she was the companion
of Lady Emily Rood, it was almost im
possible to see her alone. On the too
of all the other obstacles which at
tracted me, I learned from her own lips
very early in the proceeding that she
was engaged." -*,-::Â¦
"Mein Gott! To whom?"
"She mentioned no name."
"I do not think that any one knows
that. So that made the adventure more
alluring, did it?"
"Well, it did certainly give a spice to
it. Don't you think so?"
"I tell you that I am very Ignorant
about these things."
"My dear fellow, you can remember
that the apple you stole from your
neighbor's tree . was always sweeter
than that which. fell from your ovrn.
And then I found that she cared for
me."
"Whatâ at once?"
"Oh. no; it took about three months
of sapping and mining. But at last I
won her over. She understood that un
judicial separation from iny wife made
it impossible for me to do the right
thing by herâ but she came, all the
tame, and we had a delightful time as
long as It lasted."
"But how about the other man?"
Kennedy shrugged his shoulders.
"I suppose it is the survival of the
fittest," said he. "If he had been the
better man she would not have deserted
him. Let's drop the subject, for I have
had enough of it."
"Only, one other thing. How did you
get rid of her in' three weeks?"
"Well, we had both cooled down a bit.
you understand.- -She absolutely re
fused, under any circumstances, to
come back to face the people she had
known in Rome. Now, of course. Rpme
is necessary to me. and I was already

was an obvious cause for separation.
Then, again, her old father turned up
at the hotel in London, and there was
a scene, and the whole thing became
so unpleasant that reallyâ though I
missed ' her dreadfully at firstâ I was

Some two months afterward the fol
lowing paragraph made the round of
the European press:
"One of the most Interesting discov
eries of recent years 13 that of the new
catacomb in Rome, which lies some dis
tance to the east of the well-known
vaults of St. Calixtus. The finding of
this Important burial place, which 13
exceedingly rich in most interesting
early Christian remains. Is due to the
energy and sagacity of Dr. Julius Eur
ger, the ycung German specialist, who
is rapidly taking the rirst place as -an
authority upon ancient Rome. Al
though the first to publish his discov
ery, it appears that a less fortunate
adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger.
Some months ago Mr. Kennedy, the
well-known English student, dis
appeared suddenly from his rooms in
the Corso, and it was conjectured that
his association with a recent scandal
had driven him to leave Rome. It now
appears that he had in reality fallen a
victim of "that fervid love of arche
ology.which had raised him to a dis
tinguished place among living scholars.
His body was discovered in the heart of
the new catacomb, and it was evident
from the condition of his feet and boots
that he had tramped for days through
the tortuous corridors which make
these subterranean tombs so dangerous
to explorers. The deceased gentleman
had. with Inexplicable rashness, made
his way into this labyrinth without, as
far as can be discovered, taking with
him either candles or matches, so that
his sad fate was the natural result of
his own temerity. What makes the
matter more painful is that Dr. Julius
Burger was an Intimate friend of the
deceased. His joy at the extraordinary
find .which be has been so fortunate
as to % make has been greatly marred by
the terrible fate of his comrade and fel
low worker."
"If it were not for thla string which.
I hold in my hand I should not have a
notion which way to go."
"I dare say not. Strike- a light. fÂ«",
and have an end to this nonsense."
"Well. Kennedy, there are two things
Â¦which I understand that you are very
fond of. The one is an adventure, and.
the other is an obstacle to surmount.
The adventure must be the finding of
your way out of this catacomb. The
obstacle will be the darkness and tha
two thousand wrong turns which make
the way a little difficult to find. But
you need not hurry, for you have plenty
of time, and when you halt for a rest
now and then I should like you Just
to think of Miss Mary Saunderson. and
whether you treated her quite fairly."
"You devilâ what do you mean?"
roared Kennedy. He was running
about In little circles and clasping at
the solid blackness with both hands.
"Good-by," said the mocking voice,
and it was already at some distance.
"I really do not think. Kennedy, even
by your own showing, that you did the
right thing by that girl. There was
only one little thing which you ap
peared not to know, and I can supply
it. Miss Saunderson was engaged to a
poor, ungainly devil of a student, and
his name was Julius Burger."
There was a rustle somewhere, the
vague sound of a foot striking a stone,
and then there fell silence upon that
old Christian churchâ a stagnant, heavy
silence which closed round Kennedy
and shut him in like water round a
drowning man.
"And the darkness is something
dreadful* I tried it once for an experi
ment. Let us try it again!" He stooped
to the lantern, and in an instant It was
as if an invisible hand was squeezed
tightly over each of Kennedy's eyes.
Never had he known what such dark
ness was. It seemed to press upon
him and to smother him. It was a solid
obstacle against which the body shrank
from advancing. He put his hands out
to push It back from him.
"That will do. Burger." said he. â¢'Let
us have the light again." ]
But his companion began to laugh,
and in that circular room the sound
seemed to come from every side at once.
"You seem uneasy, friend Kennedy,"
said he.
"Go on, man. light the candle!" said
Kennedy, impatiently.
"It's very strange. Kennedy, but I
could not in the least tell by the sound
In which direction you stand. Could
you tell where I am?"
"No; you seem to be on every side
of me."
"Do you know how many wrong
turnings there are between this and
the stairs?" he asked. "There are over
two thousand. No doubt it was one of
the means of protection which the
Christians adopted. The odds are two
thousand to one against a man srettinsr
out, even if he had a light; but if he
were in the dark it would, of course,
be far more difficult."
"So I ehould think."
"Precisely," said Burger. "If I had
more time I should like to show you
all the bodies which are burled in thesa
niches upon the walls, for they are tha
early Popes and Bishops of the church,
with their miters, their erozlera and
full canonicals. Go over to that one
and look at it!"
Kennedy went across, and stared at
the ghastly head which lay loosely on
the shredded and molderlng miter.
"This is most interesting." said he.
and his voice seemed to boom against
the concave vault. "As far as my ex
perience goes, it is unique. Bring the
lantern over, Burger, for I want to see
them alL"
But the German had strolled away,
end was standing in the middle of a
yellow circle of light at the other sida
of the hall.
"By Jove!** cried Kennedy in an ecs
tasy, as Burger swung his lantern ovtr
the marble. "It is a Christian altar
pro bably the first ono in existence. Her*
is the little consecration cross cut upon
the corner of It. No doubt this circu
lar space was used as a church."
marks of his own. for he neither
stopped nor hesitated.
"What would happen if the light went
out?" Kennedy asked, as they hurried
onward.
Â¦ "I have a spare candle and a box of
matches in my pocket. By tha way,
Kennedy, have you any matches?"
"No. You had better give me some.'*
"Oh. that's all right. There is no
chance of our separating."
"How far are we going? It seems to
me that we have walked at least *
Quarter of a mile."
"More than that, I think. There is
really no limit to the tombs â at least.
I hav* never been able to find any.
This is a very difficult place, so I thlnJc
that I will use our ball of string."

CnP? HE art of posing: Is simply the ability to make
I the most of whatever beauty you may possess.
I Indeed It Is nothing more or less than the art
X. of being beautiful at all times, under any cir
cumstances. Given a pretty woman in a becoming
go-ATi and much' that is artistic may be secured.
But alter all it is not enough that a woman' should
possess mere ; perfection of face and figure. ., She
must have as well that subtle, elusive something
which, for want of a better definition, I might'call
the spirit of beautyâ the ability to portray' emo
tionally all those qualities of a dominating person
ality which in' a photograph as well, as in real life
not only attracts and holds the attention, but lives
longest in the memory of the beholder.
And such pictures, let me say at once, are as
rare in photography as such women themselves are
rare in real life. When we do find one, the result Is
invariably an almost endless array of negatives'
that run the gamut of human emotions from com
edy, to tragedy. ,..-,./.
Perhaps the most notable example of "this fact
Is Miss Joan Hadenfeldt, whose picture I present
herewith. Without doubt she has been photo
graphed more than any society girl is the West be-'
cause photographers are always seeking her. And
tblÂ« Is not simply because she has beautiful gowns
wf fcix.sbe knows how to wear. A handsome ward
nfbe, combined with * clever lighting effects and
other accessories, goes far toward making an attract
ive picture, but It is only the beginning in the art' of
' posing. There most be beauty of .the most â¢ striking -
order and. Miss Hadenfeldt '-Is : certainly distinctive.

totally unlike; *Â¦ -' . / : â¢.&""Â¦ '
;-/. ; " By nature, however,- she Is extremely vivacious,
I and yet It: is -an odd circumstance that most of the
- pictures I have made, of her ; show, her in the heavier
â¢ â emotions. â¢ Look at this, picture*, for instance. It Is
'not only a good portrait, but ft displays a depth of
emotion that borders-, on. the, tragic. And, the pose
- and expression are ' striking ~ In the extreme." In
; fact 'it is one of the most notable pictures I have
Â¦ ever made, and best Illustrates what I mean when
I say that it la not beauty alone that countsin the
> art '-, of Â» posing. - It is - the . Inborn capacity for deep
feeling. Â¦ And yet , In contradiction to this I have
-many .pictures of this same young lady In easy,
graceful... animated poses, which while , far from
I being conventional attitudes are as different aa day
and nicht. *
To those women who place a vast deal of reliance
upon an expensive wardrobe as the chief element
of attraction in their pictures let me say that their
gowns should - be not . only : original, Â¦ but harmonious.
The , simpler the -better. Gorgeous raiment detracts
from the merit of the pose Itself. A glance at this
picture, will Illustrate what I mean. The gown

just there, and down she sallies with
sails full set to conquer or die. With
the rose and the bow as war paint she
declares that battle is on and those

cee her flaunt her signals.
With the business lassie it's quite
the same. Her war paint is of another

glare of cold office scrutiny, but never

hang your head and the finger of scorn
is ever ready to be pointed at you.
This working girl took herself off
Into a convenient corner and had, a
long- heart to heart with ' herself.
"There's absolutely no sense in not be
ing dressed correctly," she argued with
herself. "Plain, substantial clothes al
ways wear far better than cheap fluffs
and I owe it to myself to keep up an
appearance."
And that Is the situation in a nut
shell. It need not necessarily follow
that Just because a girl works she has
no other interests or claims on life.
It is perfectly true that her time is not
her own to do with as she pleases, but
that only makes it the more imperative
that she keep well groomed and fresh,
else the time will not be far distant
when she will be a drab, forlorn -old
maid, thoroughly sour-balled on the
world and giving neither satisfaction
nor cheer.
It's bo terribly easy to fall into this
rut. Days pass, one exactly like an
other, with nothing but work, work,
and It soon comes to pass that Jack Is
an awfully dull boy, not caring what
happens nor looking ahead into the
future. And at that rate there isn't
any future. Even the most philan
thropic grow weary of sighs and long
gray faces and seek the sunny girl with
the merry laugh and the ready an

She may not have so very much to
make merry over, but ' she -laughs and
the world laughs with her; she makes
the best of things and her followers

Fhe sulk and make it known to all that
to-morrow's bread is an uncertain

All, no; not this girl. Perhaps that
would have been considered quite the
proper caiier a few years back, but in
this use a.nd generation the essentially
imixjrtant thing is to remember to keep
your troubles to yourself. And as to
look at her, no one would ever so much
as dream that she and Mr. Worry were
or ever had been intimate friends, and
that Mr. Want had called several times
Â« hÂ»n the weather was cold and pride
high. ;
And one reason for this change is
ihat so man; r women are standing
fchoulder to shoulder with men. and the
time has long since passed when it was
considered a burning disgrace to earn'
thread end butter and perhaps a bit of
jam honorably rather than to drain the
family coffers to the dregs and nightly
lall on your knees and devoutly pray
that the expenses may be lessened by
some kind chap coming along in the
very nick of time. 4
That may be all very well and good,
but somehow the attic with* a cheerless
hearth and an empty cupboard looks
good beside it. And here is where Miss
Business Lady makes her strong point.
An attic, be it ever so mean, does not.
tell 6tories, and these days it has come
lu be a recognized fact that good
clothes are often worn to cover up
poverty.
The girl who works is Just like any
other girl end she dearly loves all the
pretty furbelows and the dainty noth
ings that women wear, but she simply
can't afford them, and even if she
could, she is generally supplied with
enough plain, ordinary, common sense
to understand the eternal fitness of
things.
Eut mark you. she knows as -well
as you or the next one that shabby
garments no longer stand for anything
but plain inability, or worse yet, ill
health. They don't even stand for
Â¦womanly virtue or native talent as
they did in the good old days gon*j
by. and 6trange as it may seem to
those blessed with good old fashioned
ideas, the poorly clad girl is Invariably
the one who goes wearily on her way
answering this, that and the other ad
vertisement and finding no emloy
ment.
N'ow Mr. Skeptic, even though you
Ehake your head ar.d mutter, it's an
absolute fact. And you. Mrs. Wife-of
the-Business-Man, you may smile and
Bay "foolish," but use your eyes a bit
the very next time you visit your
husband in his sanctum-sanctorum
and take one long look at his secretary.
For it is now a part of the business
girl's code to dress well. Not in grand
spurts, but always. When she is look-
Ing for a position; when she has it, and
more especially, when she has lost it.
In other words, it is a part of her
business training.
But it most certainly isn't part of her
training and she most assuredly^
doesn't display* good common sense if
the rigs herself out regardlessly in
silks and satins and reserves the
calicos and rags for the privacy of her
two-by-four hall bedroom. Dangling
do-dads and flying- ends don't make
favorable impressions on sensible busi
ness men and the girl hunting fora po
sition is Quicker than any one else to
notice that, but she knows In her heart
of hearts that a well-cut tailor suit,
fresh linen and smart boots will do
more for her than a packet of recom
mendations and letters.
And does she take advantage of his
weakness? Well, rather. She Isn't the
least bit gullible and she knows for an

" "While this wait is on I'll run over
to the house and get themâ It's luckily
only -a few blocks away. She's a pep

ring her up late she might put me out

"I grabbed my hat. I dared not take
my overcoat. TU be back before the
Â¦next turn,' I declared, and rushed up
the aisle.
"As I left my seat the stage manager
came from behind the scenes and sig^
nalcd the orchestra leader to stop. 1^
i Dr. Harrity is in the audience,* I heard
, him say, 'there is a telegram at the box
office for him.'
"When I reached the sidewalk there
was the man In the tall hat. with a
policeman, both shouting for a cab.
There was one standing across ths
I street, but the driver was missing. 'He's
in some saloon along here.' I heard ths
policeman say, 'I'll look foT him. doc

" 'Find him. or I'll take the cab my
self. I've got to get to Forty-third
street Instantly!' the physician cried.
'I'd give $5 to get there la ten minutes.'
"The cop disappeared and the doc
tor ran across the street to be near tha
cab when the driver appeared. And I
was richt by his side.
"Five dollars! Why. at the minute.
Jack. I'd have committed highway rob
bery for that sum!
" 'You Jump in,' said I to the doctor.
I'll get you there. What's the num
ber?'
"He cave me a look which assured
me he knew I was not the driver of
the. cab: but he told me the number.
'I'll give you $5 If you're there in ten
minutes.' he said.
"I expected to hear the officer or the
driver of the turnout yelling at me to
stop. But the doctor wasn't in the cab
any quicker than I was up on ths high
seat. And I woke that cab horse up.
"Inside of the ten minutes we stoppc^
before the number Dr. Harrity gave
me. He was out and up the steps ring
ing the bell in a flash. For a second
I thought the promised $5 was getting
away from me. and I had made a crlm-j
inal of myself for nothing.
"I leaDed down just as the door of
the house opened. A man let the doctor
in. but I seized his coat tails before he
could disappear.
"The doctor tried to Jerk away, but
I hung on. 'Johnson!' he shouted to
the serving man, 'give this- fool $5 and
kick him out!' But I didn't wait to be
kicked after getting my grip on tfle
fiver.
"You can bet that I wasn't to bÂ»
hired to drive that cab back to the
theater. I took a car down the ave
nue and walked calmly into the lobby
Just as the orchestra began to play the
introduction for the first number after
the intermission.
"As I passed In there was the officer
and an excited cabman Jawing each
other, with a curious crowd about them.
Evidently cabby blamed the policeman
for the disappearance of his rig.
"I slid into- my seat. Jack. Just as tha
curtain went up. There were the
glasses on the shelf In front of my
guests, and I^saw the waiter, rather
anxious by now, hovering about.
" 'Oh, I fonrot to pay for these
drinks.' I remarked, and passed over
the fiver with an air which evidently
impressed the old gentleman at the
"Ah and it Is a taleâ a tale of won,"
Binning began. "It happened a good bit
ago, too: not long after I came down
here to the city, believing, in my green
ness, that I could cut a swath In law
that would lay over anything I could
do In the plow-making line.
"Dad zot me a chance wltn a cood
firm and then paid no further attention
V. me â financial attention, J mean. I
was as lonely as a strange cat sit first,
but after a few months one of the boys
In the office introduced me to a rather
nice family uptown.
"There were three girls In the family,
and as I bad hardly spoken to a girl
since leaving home, this introduction
seemed a godspeed to me. But I'va
wondered since if my fellow clerk did
not introduce me simply to make his
own escape from matrimonial toils the
easier. As my visits increased, his de
creased.
"So it was up to me to treat every
body alike. And I wag. determined to
do the elegant. I invited the bunch,
daughters and mamma and papa, to go
to the theater, bought six scats right in
this very row.
"It pretty nearly cleaned me out- Six
dollars was two-thirds of a week's sal
ary, and after mentally figuring It up
I decided that I would excuse myself
after the thaw and let my guests go
home alone. I could not afford even
another round of carfares ! Â¦Â¦:
"Well, we rustled into our seats like
a nock of pigeons â papa, at one end and
myself here on the aisle. After the first
two or three numbers on the pro
gramme, the waiters got . extremely
busy. To tell you the troth. I had not
taken into consideration the fact that
liquid refreshments were served, but I
figured that I could stand one round for
the crowd, even If I had to walk from
the office to my lodsings several even
ings to pay for Jt.
"So I suggested a drink to the girl
next to me. She took me up with posi
tively frightful alacrity, and passed on
the proposition to the others. I turned
to beckon the waiter, intending to order
six of those foaming glasses in an off
hand manner, bound to impress the ob
server with the fact that I was the
Real Thing. ..
" 'Oh, Mr. Binning," said the daughter
next to me, 'I think I'll take a lemon
ade.'
'â¢ 'And so will I-. Mr. Binning.' said the
second sister. The .third and mamma 1
followed suit. Whew! In those few sec
onds mv collar wilted, i .
"Evan the old man, evidently consid
ering that I would be; offended If â¢ he
ordered beer, asked for something In
the line of mixed poison that I knew
plaguey well he'd never tasted. Then
the waiter, with increasing affability,'
looked at me.
"It's a terrible thing to be a coward.
Jack. I wanted to blurt out: 'Not with
my money!' But I didn't dare, so I or
dered the same, mysterious drink that
the old man had spoken for and saw
the waiter hurry away with a feeling
that he might as well bring the house
officer back with him when he returned
with the refreshments. -
"Those six drinks would amount to
SI SO, and I had just 75 cents in my
pocket!
"All the Impossible means of getting
out of the entanglement raced through
my mind. I couldn't even see what was
going on upon the stage. The falling
of the curtain ar.d a burst of applause
roused me
and any. girl who nas her own living tc
make would do well to humor his fan
cies, no matter how foolish she may
think them. What if she has to rus
raadly to her nearest accommodating
friend and lay the situation before her.
And let me tell you right here that
true friendship Is to be found among
those who toll early and late for their
daily bread, and; there Isn't one girl
In a hundred who would not gladly
loan a gown or a hat toward the
cause.
To be sure It Isn't always the most
I pleasant thing in the world to start off
* to work clad in the best suit your chum
has and to be constantly reminded if a
sudden shower should come up that
Mary's pet hat would probably be much
the worse for year. It isn't pleasant,
but it is profitable, and that is Infinitely
more to the point when It comes down
to a matter of hard, cold facts. Even
the most capable office girl may have a
long streak c-f bad luck and when the
mere ' borrowlts of a friend's pretty
Â¦frock would put her upon her feet
again wouldn't she be the silliest thing
that ever happened not to take advan
tage of her opportunities?
v The girl who sings at concerts has
her stock In trade and she don't depend
entirely . upon her voice, either. She
knows that she must make a good ap
pearance and that her manner must be
gracious and charming. And how could
she be thoroughly at ease if her gown
was r.ot smartly cut and she had to
remember to keep her skirt lust so in
order not to reveal her shabby boots? .
That isn't the way to secure another
engagement and after one or two pitiful
blunders she comes to the edifying con
clusion that It is an actual business in
vestment to dress well, even If she eats
crackers and cheese tor a solid week.
\ The fastidious hostess wishes to .make
; as brave a front to her guests as possi
ble and when she pays for their enter
tainment she demands that they be
amused and pleased and in her eyes
slopplness and poverty have no excuse
for existing.
Scr what is this girl worker to do?
Nothing more or less than dress as well
as she honestly canâ no more or no less.
If she gives up seeing a play that she
has set her heart upon for the sake of a
. new hat it may not prove as attract
ive, but from a business standpoint it
'is a good investment, and she at least
has the satisfaction of kne-wing that
WHEN BINNING DID THE ELEGANT
a salary that seems to. fit her needs,
but on the other hand, if she looks as
though she had been used to a good
salary, she will get it and Just as easily,
too.; For, unfortunately the time has
not yet come when girls' salaries are
uniform, and they are subject to violent
ups and downs according to the appear-
ance of the applicant.
But from aonther standpoint buying
cheap fabrics is even worse economy
for her than for other women because
of the wear and tear that they arÂ«
called upon to withstand. The really
good thing may seem terribly expensive
at first, but gowns that'keep their
shape and color through months of
active all-weather service, that don't
wrinkle and look forlorn after a sudden
Ehower, are found by miladi sensible
to be a rattling good Investment at th^
end of the year. If she be wise she re
mcmbera when buying that this gown
Is worn almost ten hours out of the
twelve and that she is seen in it by the
largest number of people.
If for that reason alojie ?he should
not think it beneath her dignity to pay
the strictest attention to beinÂ» neat and
stylish and never fur a single Instant
should she begrudge the time expanded
upon the minute details or consider it
idly wasted.
Life is too short to worry over trifles
and the glr! who can push aoide care
is one that is truly blessed, but it be
hooves her not to push aside the im
portance of teins the smartest, neatest
office girl in town, for, forsooth, it may
mean more than she wist of.
(""pfHE independent, business girl has
I issued a new proclamation, and
I right nobly have her thousand
JL and one sisters responded to the
call. So well, in fact, that there
irn't even the faintest similarity be
twefn the girl of to-day and the one
of h~lf a score of years ago. \
Ar.d ber proclamation? Ah. nothing
more ncr less than to change her man
ner of dress with her code of business
ethics. And it wasn't eo terribly diffi
cult, either, once she tried.' Instead of

the Length and breadthof the city with
a general air of hard luck written all
over her and hanging her head with a
sort of excuse-me-for-being-on-the
oarth sort of air, you are very much
more art to find her traveling leisurely
along with her head well up and giv

are silver-lised, and. for that matter,
always have been.

Probably not. His eye has not been

Men are queer creatures. They

tops that women's clothes are a lot of
foolish trash; yet, even the sagacious,
stern man of affairs Is decidedly sus

without half trying, all on account of
a bow of crisp ribbon or a spick and

To.be frank, the girls aren't slow to
seize upon this advantage and use it
for all it Is worth. And when it comes

the rose and the bow as war paint she

With the business lassie it's quite

This working girl took herself off
Into a convenient corner and had, a
long- heart to heart with ' herself.
"There's absolutely no sense in not be
ing dressed correctly," she argued with
herself. "Plain, substantial clothes al
ways wear far better than cheap fluffs
and I owe it to myself to keep up an
appearance."
And that Is the situation in a nut
shell. It need not necessarily follow
that Just because a girl works she has
no other interests or claims on life.
It is perfectly true that her time is not
her own to do with as she pleases, but
that only makes it the more imperative
that she keep well groomed and fresh,
else the time will not be far distant
when she will be a drab, forlorn -old
maid, thoroughly sour-balled on the
world and giving neither satisfaction
nor cheer.
It's bo terribly easy to fall into this
rut. Days pass, one exactly like an
other, with nothing but work, work,
and It soon comes to pass that Jack Is
an awfully dull boy, not caring what
happens nor looking ahead into the
future. And at that rate there isn't
any future. Even the most philan

gray faces and seek the sunny girl with

All, no; not this girl. Perhaps that
would have been considered quite the
proper caiier a few years back, but in
this use a.nd generation the essentially
imixjrtant thing is to remember to keep
your troubles to yourself. And as to
look at her, no one would ever so much
as dream that she and Mr. Worry were

that Mr. Want had called several times

clothes are often worn to cover up
poverty.
The girl who works is Just like any
other girl end she dearly loves all the
pretty furbelows and the dainty noth
ings that women wear, but she simply
can't afford them, and even if she
could, she is generally supplied with
enough plain, ordinary, common sense
to understand the eternal fitness of
things.
Eut mark you. she knows as -well
as you or the next one that shabby
garments no longer stand for anything

health. They don't even stand for
Â¦womanly virtue or native talent as
they did in the good old days gon*j

Bay "foolish," but use your eyes a bit
the very next time you visit your

For it is now a part of the business
girl's code to dress well. Not in grand
spurts, but always. When she is look-
Ing for a position; when she has it, and
more especially, when she has lost it.
In other words, it is a part of her
business training.
But it most certainly isn't part of her
training and she most assuredly^
doesn't display* good common sense if
the rigs herself out regardlessly in
silks and satins and reserves the
calicos and rags for the privacy of her

notice that, but she knows In her heart
of hearts that a well-cut tailor suit,
fresh linen and smart boots will do
more for her than a packet of recom

And does she take advantage of his

to the house and get themâ It's luckily
only -a few blocks away. She's a pep

ring her up late she might put me out

"I grabbed my hat. I dared not take
my overcoat. TU be back before the
Â¦next turn,' I declared, and rushed up
the aisle.
"As I left my seat the stage manager
came from behind the scenes and sig^
nalcd the orchestra leader to stop. 1^
i Dr. Harrity is in the audience,* I heard
, him say, 'there is a telegram at the box
office for him.'
"When I reached the sidewalk there
was the man In the tall hat. with a
policeman, both shouting for a cab.
There was one standing across ths

in some saloon along here.' I heard ths
policeman say, 'I'll look foT him. doc

" 'Find him. or I'll take the cab my

'I'd give $5 to get there la ten minutes.'
"The cop disappeared and the doc
tor ran across the street to be near tha
cab when the driver appeared. And I
was richt by his side.
"Five dollars! Why. at the minute.
Jack. I'd have committed highway rob
bery for that sum!
" 'You Jump in,' said I to the doctor.
I'll get you there. What's the num
ber?'
"He cave me a look which assured
me he knew I was not the driver of
the. cab: but he told me the number.
'I'll give you $5 If you're there in ten
minutes.' he said.
"I expected to hear the officer or the
driver of the turnout yelling at me to
stop. But the doctor wasn't in the cab
any quicker than I was up on ths high
seat. And I woke that cab horse up.
"Inside of the ten minutes we stoppc^
before the number Dr. Harrity gave
me. He was out and up the steps ring
ing the bell in a flash. For a second
I thought the promised $5 was getting
away from me. and I had made a crlm-j

"I leaDed down just as the door of
the house opened. A man let the doctor
in. but I seized his coat tails before he
could disappear.
"The doctor tried to Jerk away, but
I hung on. 'Johnson!' he shouted to
the serving man, 'give this- fool $5 and
kick him out!' But I didn't wait to be
kicked after getting my grip on tfle
fiver.
"You can bet that I wasn't to bÂ»
hired to drive that cab back to the
theater. I took a car down the ave
nue and walked calmly into the lobby
Just as the orchestra began to play the
introduction for the first number after
the intermission.
"As I passed In there was the officer
and an excited cabman Jawing each
other, with a curious crowd about them.
Evidently cabby blamed the policeman
for the disappearance of his rig.
"I slid into- my seat. Jack. Just as tha
curtain went up. There were the
glasses on the shelf In front of my
guests, and I^saw the waiter, rather
anxious by now, hovering about.
" 'Oh, I fonrot to pay for these
drinks.' I remarked, and passed over
the fiver with an air which evidently
impressed the old gentleman at the
"Ah and it Is a taleâ a tale of won,"
Binning began. "It happened a good bit
ago, too: not long after I came down
here to the city, believing, in my green

that would lay over anything I could
do In the plow-making line.
"Dad zot me a chance wltn a cood

V. me â financial attention, J mean. I
was as lonely as a strange cat sit first,
but after a few months one of the boys
In the office introduced me to a rather
nice family uptown.
"There were three girls In the family,
and as I bad hardly spoken to a girl
since leaving home, this introduction
seemed a godspeed to me. But I'va
wondered since if my fellow clerk did
not introduce me simply to make his
own escape from matrimonial toils the
easier. As my visits increased, his de
creased.
"So it was up to me to treat every
body alike. And I wag. determined to
do the elegant. I invited the bunch,
daughters and mamma and papa, to go
to the theater, bought six scats right in
this very row.
"It pretty nearly cleaned me out- Six
dollars was two-thirds of a week's sal
ary, and after mentally figuring It up
I decided that I would excuse myself
after the thaw and let my guests go
home alone. I could not afford even
another round of carfares ! Â¦Â¦:
"Well, we rustled into our seats like
a nock of pigeons â papa, at one end and
myself here on the aisle. After the first
two or three numbers on the pro
gramme, the waiters got . extremely
busy. To tell you the troth. I had not
taken into consideration the fact that
liquid refreshments were served, but I
figured that I could stand one round for
the crowd, even If I had to walk from
the office to my lodsings several even
ings to pay for Jt.
"So I suggested a drink to the girl
next to me. She took me up with posi
tively frightful alacrity, and passed on
the proposition to the others. I turned
to beckon the waiter, intending to order
six of those foaming glasses in an off
hand manner, bound to impress the ob
server with the fact that I was the
Real Thing. ..
" 'Oh, Mr. Binning," said the daughter
next to me, 'I think I'll take a lemon
ade.'
'â¢ 'And so will I-. Mr. Binning.' said the
second sister. The .third and mamma 1
followed suit. Whew! In those few sec
onds mv collar wilted, i .
"Evan the old man, evidently consid
ering that I would be; offended If â¢ he
ordered beer, asked for something In
the line of mixed poison that I knew
plaguey well he'd never tasted. Then
the waiter, with increasing affability,'
looked at me.
"It's a terrible thing to be a coward.
Jack. I wanted to blurt out: 'Not with
my money!' But I didn't dare, so I or
dered the same, mysterious drink that
the old man had spoken for and saw
the waiter hurry away with a feeling
that he might as well bring the house
officer back with him when he returned
with the refreshments. -
"Those six drinks would amount to
SI SO, and I had just 75 cents in my
pocket!
"All the Impossible means of getting
out of the entanglement raced through
my mind. I couldn't even see what was
going on upon the stage. The falling
of the curtain ar.d a burst of applause
roused me
and any. girl who nas her own living tc
make would do well to humor his fan
cies, no matter how foolish she may
think them. What if she has to rus
raadly to her nearest accommodating
friend and lay the situation before her.
And let me tell you right here that
true friendship Is to be found among
those who toll early and late for their
daily bread, and; there Isn't one girl
In a hundred who would not gladly
loan a gown or a hat toward the
cause.
To be sure It Isn't always the most
I pleasant thing in the world to start off
* to work clad in the best suit your chum
has and to be constantly reminded if a
sudden shower should come up that
Mary's pet hat would probably be much
the worse for year. It isn't pleasant,
but it is profitable, and that is Infinitely
more to the point when It comes down
to a matter of hard, cold facts. Even
the most capable office girl may have a
long streak c-f bad luck and when the
mere ' borrowlts of a friend's pretty
Â¦frock would put her upon her feet
again wouldn't she be the silliest thing
that ever happened not to take advan
tage of her opportunities?
v The girl who sings at concerts has
her stock In trade and she don't depend
entirely . upon her voice, either. She
knows that she must make a good ap
pearance and that her manner must be
gracious and charming. And how could
she be thoroughly at ease if her gown
was r.ot smartly cut and she had to
remember to keep her skirt lust so in
order not to reveal her shabby boots? .
That isn't the way to secure another
engagement and after one or two pitiful
blunders she comes to the edifying con
clusion that It is an actual business in
vestment to dress well, even If she eats
crackers and cheese tor a solid week.
\ The fastidious hostess wishes to .make
; as brave a front to her guests as possi
ble and when she pays for their enter
tainment she demands that they be
amused and pleased and in her eyes
slopplness and poverty have no excuse
for existing.
Scr what is this girl worker to do?
Nothing more or less than dress as well
as she honestly canâ no more or no less.
If she gives up seeing a play that she
has set her heart upon for the sake of a
. new hat it may not prove as attract
ive, but from a business standpoint it
'is a good investment, and she at least
has the satisfaction of kne-wing that
WHEN BINNING DID THE ELEGANT
a salary that seems to. fit her needs,
but on the other hand, if she looks as
though she had been used to a good
salary, she will get it and Just as easily,
too.; For, unfortunately the time has
not yet come when girls' salaries are
uniform, and they are subject to violent
ups and downs according to the appear-
ance of the applicant.
But from aonther standpoint buying
cheap fabrics is even worse economy
for her than for other women because
of the wear and tear that they arÂ«
called upon to withstand. The really
good thing may seem terribly expensive
at first, but gowns that'keep their
shape and color through months of
active all-weather service, that don't
wrinkle and look forlorn after a sudden
Ehower, are found by miladi sensible
to be a rattling good Investment at th^
end of the year. If she be wise she re
mcmbera when buying that this gown
Is worn almost ten hours out of the
twelve and that she is seen in it by the
largest number of people.
If for that reason alojie ?he should
not think it beneath her dignity to pay
the strictest attention to beinÂ» neat and
stylish and never fur a single Instant
should she begrudge the time expanded
upon the minute details or consider it
idly wasted.
Life is too short to worry over trifles
and the glr! who can push aoide care
is one that is truly blessed, but it be
hooves her not to push aside the im
portance of teins the smartest, neatest
office girl in town, for, forsooth, it may
mean more than she wist of.
(""pfHE independent, business girl has
I issued a new proclamation, and
I right nobly have her thousand
JL and one sisters responded to the
call. So well, in fact, that there
irn't even the faintest similarity be
twefn the girl of to-day and the one
of h~lf a score of years ago. \
Ar.d ber proclamation? Ah. nothing
more ncr less than to change her man
ner of dress with her code of business
ethics. And it wasn't eo terribly diffi
cult, either, once she tried.' Instead of
fct-lir.s it her bounder^duty to travel
the Length and breadthof the city with
a general air of hard luck written all
over her and hanging her head with a
sort of excuse-me-for-being-on-the
oarth sort of air, you are very much
more art to find her traveling leisurely
along with her head well up and giv
ing the impression that her pockets
are silver-lised, and. for that matter,

Probably not. His eye has not been

It means.
Men are queer creatures. They
swear and tear their hair over ex
pense and cry aloud from the house
tops that women's clothes are a lot of
foolish trash; yet, even the sagacious,
stern man of affairs Is decidedly sus
ceptible, and many a victory is won
without half trying, all on account of
a bow of crisp ribbon or a spick and
Epan linen collar.
To.be frank, the girls aren't slow to
seize upon this advantage and use it
for all it Is worth. And when it comes
right down to it, can you blame them?
There isn't so terribly much differ
ence between the methods of the soci
ety girl and the business girL Both
have their tricks In their trades and
both are remarkably alike.

Â¦There is not only a powerful, but a
rather touchlng5sermon embodied in
this unconscious' plaint of childhood
that might do better service for pulpit
oratory than many of the eloquent
tirades and sensational explosives by
which so-called divines seek to achieve
reputations and bank accounts.
The woman who boasts that she can
successfully divide her time amons a
number of outside Interests, club or
otherwise, must of necessity neglect the
one or the other. A woman with a fam
ily of little people, and sometimes one
is more care than half a dozen, has all
that she can attend to if she stays at
home and minds her own business.
Â¦ The woman who does not care . for
children should not marry. The many
stories lately ventilated anent a noted
writer of children stories who so beau
tifully depicted child life caused a
shock to many of her admirers.
This woman frankly admitted ' that
she hated children and when consent-
Ing to become the wife of a widower,
the father of two sons, she exacted the
condition that these children should not
â¢hare their home.
And the man compiled.
Underlying this also ona might read
another sermon, or perhaps It might
more aptly be styled a tragedy.
The woman who carries a fat. woozy
poodle in her arms and drags a tired
child by the hand Is a sorry commen
tary on the peculiar workings of tha
feminine mind.
The woman who has co higher ambi
tion than to be led around by a dog at
the business end of a string is hardly
worthy of even decent Christian burial.
The woman around whom ' children
cluster is the woman whose heart ia in
the right place.
Little' people are excellent Judges of
character, and the woman who is
equally at home whether presiding at
some stately function or entertaining a
bunch of youngsters Is the woman who
will make the best wife and mother,
and the old-maidy. acrimonious femala

He stretched out his long, lean arms
and looked grimly at | the great, bony
hands. "One of those fellows ; wears
a ring and plays" the piano. 7 he *
thought; and a ghost ' of a smile
â¢touched the firm mouth, t
He walked with long, slow steps to
the mirror and gazed at the face re
flected there. It was not unlike the
man for whom he was named, with'
the high cheekbones, wide mouth, '
deep-set eyes and large hose.'
"You're not much to look at. Abe."
he said, shaking his head at the re
flection, "and Bruce is as handsome
as a girlâ and a good, square fellow,

Abraham Lincoln Adams had come
from a country home and a country
lawyer's office three years before. He .
had passed the examinations with high
honors, ; and since his admission to
the bar. had been remarkably success-'
ful. He' felt that; he was now in a ;
* position'; to ask - the : glr^ 'of : his ' choice .
to share his life and the honors he was
sure the future held for him. *
He. had known the girl since 'child-/
hood: '.; He was" a ;'Â¦ big boy.V studying
algebra; whenT she ; sat Â¦; dangling ,; her v
plump legs on. the front ; seat ? devoted 'Â¦Â¦',
to the > infants. 1 He Kad taught ' one "?

tortured his falthf ul' heart by "an ab

; He had left her with no word of
loveâhe had his way to make, and the ?
letters > between them ; were - few and
unsatisfactory.. . v â¢
A year ago she had come ' to Boston *
He took out his watch and held it In
his hand. He looked only at Tillleâ
for him * the others, were not there.
Some . foreshadowing of the greatness
that was yet to be his., fell upon the
thin face and gaunt figure,' and lent a
strength and. dignity that awed the
girl's soul and held her. gaze captive.
"Tillie,", sneaking slowly and clear
ly, ' "in exactly two minutes I am â¢ go-
Ing to propose to you. If you wish
yo. ur seven friends to remain. I have
no objection â "
A horrified, gasping "Oh!" in ' sev
eral different voices, a rustle of silken
petticoats; and seven breathless girls
Tillie shook her pretty head In re
fusal, but her. heart beat faster. There
was something new In the man's tone â
something masterful and commanding,
that she had never known before.
After a\few minutes, he wandered.
w!th apparent listlessness. to the fire
place, and, turning, "faced the group.
'â¢Tillie!" \-,
At the sound of the firm, compell
ing voice, eight astonished faces were
turned toward him. and eight pairs of
bright eyes gazed at him In constrained
silence.
But' now. he was resolved. He would
not be a plaything for a girl's whim.
Under cover of greetings from eight
laughing girls, he was able to ask Til
lle if she would go for a short walk
with him.
"With another of the eight?" she
asked, archly.
"No, alone."
His own nature was so simple and
direct that this would seem the most
kind and true thing to Vlo. He could
not understand the feminine com
plexity that led the girl to enjoy his
unwavering, unspoken devotion. The
protests of the other : girls that she
was unfair to the -man. and did not
deserve such homage, only Increased
her determination to hold him at this
disadvantage, and to ward off as long
as possible the declaration she knew
she/ must hear when once they were
alone.
pletely shut out as he, and tha unwel
come thought suggested itself that Til
lle might manage to see him alone If
she really wanted to. (
"Can it be that Tillle doesn't cara
to see me?" he asked himself, un
easily; "if it were' so wouldn't she tell
me?" . .
to study music, and his honest soul
had, rejoiced. How happy he would
be In having her bo" near. He could
see her often, and take her about a
good deal;' and it- would not be long
now before he could , tell her of the
great love that was In his heart, of
his hopes for the future, his plans for
her happiness. . .
But to his dismay he found Tillle
hedged about,. In a most Inexplicable
fashion, with formalities and conven
tions hitherto unknown.
Eight. young women had rented a
furnished house, and with an aunt
and 'uncle as housekeeper and pro
tector, were living in" a little world of
their own, superior to boarding-houses;
and with a fine â¢ contempt for "home*"
and institutions. Adams wasn't 'auite
sure whether the" aunt and uncle were
rented with the house, or if they were
really related to -one of these very
modern young women.
He called several times and was
cordially received; but upon every oc
casion at ' least three of the other
young ladles * were present, and re
mained during his entire stay. Then
he tried the plan of writing to Tillle,
inviting her to accompany him to a
lecture or concert. The little notes
he ' received in . reply were sweetly
courteous, ;Â¦ but he. felt somehow
thrown back upon himself â chilled and
repulsed.,, ,
"You must remember, that X. am only
one of eight," was the 'Â¦ tenor.' of Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ the
sweet little notes; "no one of us ac
cepts-an invitation "'for. herself alone.
Which one of the girls would you
like-to include , in your' very pleasant
plan for i Thursday ; evening, or Satur
day .afternoon?" etc. v
' Then he. settled down to : a regular
call on" Wednesday evenlnsr. He met
all'dfithe young ladies, and really had
better * opportunities for < conversing
wlthiany, one* of* the- others than with
'thelone he sought j Bright, pretty girls
they ".were,*; each earnest: in, her work,
with high aims and youthful ambitions.
An artist, a schoolteacher, a a
music teacher, a ; violinist, kindergart
ener and ; an editor made up the list.
: Often " there were other men there,
and Adams soon discovered that he was
not the only, one 1 who. would like to see
Tillle alone. After awhile he -began to
wonder if the:other men were as corn-
Â¦campered out Into tha hall and as
the stairs.
"Of course she'll refuse him." cried
the girl who wrote stories; "isn't ha
horrid?"
"No," answered the woman whÂ»
read stories; "ha Is manifesting tha
one needful quality, and Tillie will mar
ry him."
"If she doesn't." chimed in tha ar
tist, "it will show that aha Isn't bright
enough to recognize a great man in
the days of his obscurity."
"In which case." added tha girl with
the violin, "I shall try for him my
self."
This was the last, and certainly tha
most astounding. Each girl went
silently to her own room, feeling that
a great crisis had come in the life of
one of the eight.
Left alone, at last, with tha girl ha
loved. Adams made no movement to
approach her. Ilia eyes had never left
her face, and she -had not been able
to look aside even when her com
panions fled from the room.
"Tillle." the grave voice grew sol
emnly tender, "I have loved you for
years, and you have known It. Thera
was small need for me to declare a
love that had been yours since child
hood, and I would not seek to bind
you by any promise until I could offer
you a home as well as a heart. I am
now ready to do for you all that a man
can do for the woman ha loves. Coma
to me. Tillle, and tell me that my lova
is returnedâ that^ you will be my wife,
Tillleâ"
He held out his handâ the great.
bony hand that wore no rins and
could not play the piano: and tha
dark, homely face was illumined with
the mighty love and exceeding tender
ness that only a strong man knows. Â¦
The girl rose slowly, her eyes still
fixed on his. and moved toward him.
as If impelled by some stronger power.
Hailf way she stopped, and raised a
pitiful, pleading face to him.
"Abe," she whispered. "Abe. ara
you going, to make me come all the
way?" 5
He had intended to, but the passion
ate, thrlllinc: sweetness of his boyhood's
name overcame his resolve. One long
step and he caught her in his arms.
"All the way. sweetheart." he, an
ewered, "but I will carry you the other
half."
Little peopla need rtst and quiet as
much as they need air and sunlight,
and, goodness knows, the mother and
nurse and every one else needs a lit
tle rest, too, when sleepy time comes.
A child has no past. It turns Its lit
tle back, upon each day with the set
ting sun and accepts the present as
each day dawns. Over the sea of life
it builds its castle In Spain and delights
in dreams of the future. The present
is the moment which It recognizes and
those interwoven with Its life should
seek to make even the sunshine -
brighter.
The childhood of some little people is
sadder far than the dreariest* romanc
ing of fiction, and few 'appreciate the
i'ttle sorrows that steal Into a child's
life., robbing It of Its birthright of hap
piness.
Children who have not been allowed
to revel in mud pies miss half the de-;
lights of childhood, and the housewife
who invented overalls for 'little' people
deserves the gratitude, of progeny. If
any one has ,'eve'r^ known , a child who
did' not love its "blue Jeans" it must
have had an abnormal streak some
where. â¢
The boy who has a carpenter shop In*
an old-fashioned attic and a pair of
tions in which the Inquiring mind of
a 3-year-old delights, and one young
ster bubbling over with an investigat
ing mania can manage to perpetrate
more outrages in ten minutes than a
grown-up would think of In ten years.
The woman who loves children, be
she mother or: maid, can easily ac
quire the art of managing them by
keeping little minds in the right chan
nel when she would not be able to ac
complish anything did she adopt
sterner methods.
The first time one comes In contact
with a little one, be it girl _or boy,
generally settles It whether it shall be
peace or war between them.
The woman to whom children natur
ally trend has always much In her fa
vor, and her manner toward them re
flects her character.'
I do not believe In the "ootsie toot
si e" business, but think a mother
should treat her little people as if they
had a reasonable share of commom
sense from the time they are old
enough to ' understand what, is said to
them.
There should be hours of play that
should have all the fun that could be
crowded Into them, these to be followed
by hours of rest.
'^r YÂ» Â«VHEN a woman boasts that
\ A Jshe does not love children,
Y Ehy off; there is something
*Â¦ wrong. Her heart or her head
needs disinfecting, or her
Â¦pleen is dislocated.
The love for children begins In a
miniature little woman when she hugs
her first dolly jto her baby breast, purs
ing it with all the tenderness of the
grown up mother. Should anything
happen to her dolly her little heart is
broken and she will cry her little self
to sleep with all the abandon of the
big mamma who later on folds little
dead hands In sorrow and weeps in
anguish over a little white coffin.
Of course, there are children whom
no one on earth could love, but I ques
tion if It be not the mother's fault. The
child who Is loved at home grows up
Â¦with a craving for love, which will
crop up, and love wins love in return
that keeps the heart warm and bright
despite the cruelties of fate.
There are many women who are
about as capable of filling the maternal
role as they would be to handle a pow
der magazine, and the fact of mother
hood does not always carry with It a
patent right to all the virtues to which
sentimentalists give It a clean bill of
sale.
There are many ways to love little
people and the more sensible and rea
sonable the love the greater will be the
respect engendered in a child's heart.
The foolish extravagant subservience
that some mothers lavish upon a child
is enough to disgust the little one it
self, who soon realizes that the mother
is too weak and Sacking In character to
instil into its mind and heart such pre
cepts as will best fit it for the battle of
life.
I do not think that too much love
ever spoiled a child or any one else,
but too little, with its burden of ne
glect, furnishes the timber filling out
per.al institutions.
Excessive, coddling with money ad
libitum ruins many children, who,
never being" allowed one moment with
out the attendance of a host of hire
lings, grow up without a thought or
ldea\>f that self-reliance which is the
fundamental principle of sturdy ma
turity.
It is. not the sons of moneyed kings
Â¦who forge a way to the top of our
great institutions, It is the men who
have had to dig their own way. who
win through their own pluck.
And the mother who molds the char
acter of such men deserves the meed
of praise.
The twentieth century idea that chil
dren are to be permitted to grow and
not be decently raised finds few advo
cates among sensible people, or those
who have at one time or another been
engaged in the strenuous- -occupation
of keeping a set of live, energetic
youngsters from making bonflrei of
themselves or of the roof tree, or in
dulging other equally wild Investiga-

Mrs. Stetson straightened herself In
her chair. She felt the "stiff enlnc" *o
out of her knees, but her eyes flashed.
Under the gross Injustice of this thin*
her "crushed sperrlt" had revolted.
"Them .turkeys was mine." she said
in a voice whose tone was new ta
him.
"I s'pose you paid for all the corn

"They was mine." she reiterated,
and there was neither appeal nor apol
ogy in her words.
*:i guess it's pretty well settled whÂ«
they belonged to," he said grimly.
She rose from her chair and stood
before him. She trembled violently,
but her eyes never falterd as they
looked into his.
"Jim Stetson." she said, chokingly.
"I'm goln' to have Christina* as I
want it. I'm goin* to have a turktyâ

To his amazement she swept from

laughter and many broad Jokes shook
the dice on an old counter from a dilap

Much might be written of her ex

she threw to the limit of her cash
capital (60 cents): of how one of tha
Dayton boys showed her how to count
the dice, and as he bent above them
slyly . turned them over to count
higher. But that has all passed Into
the official (unwritten) history of the
town. Suffice It to say that at Â»:S0
Mrs. Stetson strode homeward witl)
a plump turkey under her arm and the
odor of vile tobacco about her clothes.
Her - husband sat by tha kitchen
table as she entered. She threw her
bundle on the floor beside him.
"I got my turkey." she said In chal
lenge.
"Eh? Where'd you fit it." ha said
stupefied.
"At the raffla." sha said defiantly.
She was prepared for a storm of
his wrath. She knew In that event
Just what sha would say. To her sur

critically inspected the bird.
"Good looking critter." ha â¢aid.
"You done first rate."
She felt the hot tears In her eyas.
Her throat seemed parched and chok

"I never done fust rate, neither."
she said, brokenly. "It was all tobacco
Â¦mokeâ and they'd been drlnkln'â but
you drove me to It."
Ha smiled grimly. Tha hard lines
about his mouth softened. Ha cam*
over to her chair and gently placed a
hand on her shoulder. Her sobs wera
unrestrained.
"Sho!" ha said uneasily. "Don't
take on so, mother. I promisa you you
won't never have to raffle for anothar
turkeyâ never."
"so long's Marthy goln' to bring her
husband home here for Christmas
don't you think we'd better have a
turkey?"
Her husband turned to her. The two
pairs of spectacles gave, his face an ex
pression of ridiculous ferocity.
"Turkey?" he Inquired explosively.
"I guess chickens'll do well enoueh."
"Last year when we was up to Mar
thy's place we had- turkey," . Mrs.
Stetson pursued. "Seems to me we
ought to do as much for them."
"I cal'clate a pair of them chickens'll
be full as good," said Stetson. .
"They're nice chickens. I know."
said Mrs. Stetson. "Them Plymouth

Incidentally investigating; all the old

maiden who can also don her overalls
and be her Â¦ little boy friend's compan

* The companionship of ' little boys and
girls : Improves . the 'â¢. character of both.
The boy is made more. gentle and ten
der by the association, and the girl ac
quires more force and strength,"men
tally, morally and' physically, than
when reared In an exclusively feminine
atmosphere.
'And the woman who loves children â
well, she is sure to be better, truer, no
bler and more womanly. She is a better
wife, 'a tenderer mother and a more
genial companion for both old and
young. '
There . is , something appalling in the
present social condition, where moth
ers ..are so absorbed by outside duties
is to be almost strangers to their own
little ones.
And little people do more thinking
than they are given credit for.
I heard a miniature llttm society
woman of five remark some time ago:
"Mamma is very sweet, and I lova her,
but I know my nurse." â¢
Â¦There is not only a powerful, but a
rather touchlng5sermon embodied in
this unconscious' plaint of childhood
that might do better service for pulpit
oratory than many of the eloquent
tirades and sensational explosives by
which so-called divines seek to achieve
reputations and bank accounts.
The woman who boasts that she can
successfully divide her time amons a
number of outside Interests, club or
otherwise, must of necessity neglect the
one or the other. A woman with a fam
ily of little people, and sometimes one
is more care than half a dozen, has all
that she can attend to if she stays at
home and minds her own business.
Â¦ The woman who does not care . for
children should not marry. The many
stories lately ventilated anent a noted
writer of children stories who so beau
tifully depicted child life caused a
shock to many of her admirers.
This woman frankly admitted ' that
she hated children and when consent-
Ing to become the wife of a widower,
the father of two sons, she exacted the
condition that these children should not
â¢hare their home.
And the man compiled.
Underlying this also ona might read
another sermon, or perhaps It might
more aptly be styled a tragedy.
The woman who carries a fat. woozy
poodle in her arms and drags a tired
child by the hand Is a sorry commen
tary on the peculiar workings of tha
feminine mind.
The woman who has co higher ambi
tion than to be led around by a dog at
the business end of a string is hardly
worthy of even decent Christian burial.
The woman around whom ' children
cluster is the woman whose heart ia in
the right place.
Little' people are excellent Judges of
character, and the woman who is
equally at home whether presiding at
some stately function or entertaining a
bunch of youngsters Is the woman who
will make the best wife and mother,
and the old-maidy. acrimonious femala
whose teeth are set on edge by a child's
laughter had better remain an old
maid, cr some fellow will be blooming
sorry for himself before the curtain
rings down the grand finale.

T^a^jrJEa^l at the best, and this
HB^â¢ I^aBm expression of stern
determination did not add to his at
tractiveness^r
"This thing has gone far enough.",
he said, aloud. "One way or another
It shall be settled, and settled to
night.".
He stretched out his long, lean arms
and looked grimly at | the great, bony
hands. "One of those fellows ; wears
a ring and plays" the piano. 7 he *
thought; and a ghost ' of a smile
â¢touched the firm mouth, t
He walked with long, slow steps to
the mirror and gazed at the face re
flected there. It was not unlike the
man for whom he was named, with'
the high cheekbones, wide mouth, '
deep-set eyes and large hose.'
"You're not much to look at. Abe."
he said, shaking his head at the re
flection, "and Bruce is as handsome
as a girlâ and a good, square fellow,
too." he added, honestly. . .
Abraham Lincoln Adams had come
from a country home and a country
lawyer's office three years before. He .
had passed the examinations with high
honors, ; and since his admission to
the bar. had been remarkably success-'
ful. He' felt that; he was now in a ;
* position'; to ask - the : glr^ 'of : his ' choice .
to share his life and the honors he was
sure the future held for him. *
He. had known the girl since 'child-/
hood: '.; He was" a ;'Â¦ big boy.V studying
algebra; whenT she ; sat Â¦; dangling ,; her v
plump legs on. the front ; seat ? devoted 'Â¦Â¦',
to the > infants. 1 He Kad taught ' one "?
term". In' that same : school, tmdj she had .
tortured his falthf ul' heart by "an ab
sorbing, interest In a pink-cheeked <boy.
; in : her, class,; and ;by<an J , utter-- inability-^
to master, the mysteries, of, X, 1 Y./Z.V
; He had left her with no word of
loveâhe had his way to make, and the ?
letters > between them ; were - few and
unsatisfactory.. . v â¢
A year ago she had come ' to Boston *
He took out his watch and held it In
his hand. He looked only at Tillleâ
for him * the others, were not there.
Some . foreshadowing of the greatness
that was yet to be his., fell upon the
thin face and gaunt figure,' and lent a
strength and. dignity that awed the
girl's soul and held her. gaze captive.
"Tillie,", sneaking slowly and clear
ly, ' "in exactly two minutes I am â¢ go-
Ing to propose to you. If you wish
yo. ur seven friends to remain. I have
no objection â "
A horrified, gasping "Oh!" in ' sev
eral different voices, a rustle of silken
petticoats; and seven breathless girls
Tillie shook her pretty head In re
fusal, but her. heart beat faster. There
was something new In the man's tone â
something masterful and commanding,
that she had never known before.
After a\few minutes, he wandered.
w!th apparent listlessness. to the fire
place, and, turning, "faced the group.
'â¢Tillie!" \-,
At the sound of the firm, compell
ing voice, eight astonished faces were
turned toward him. and eight pairs of
bright eyes gazed at him In constrained
silence.
But' now. he was resolved. He would
not be a plaything for a girl's whim.
Under cover of greetings from eight
laughing girls, he was able to ask Til
lle if she would go for a short walk
with him.
"With another of the eight?" she
asked, archly.
"No, alone."
His own nature was so simple and
direct that this would seem the most
kind and true thing to Vlo. He could
not understand the feminine com
plexity that led the girl to enjoy his
unwavering, unspoken devotion. The
protests of the other : girls that she
was unfair to the -man. and did not
deserve such homage, only Increased
her determination to hold him at this
disadvantage, and to ward off as long
as possible the declaration she knew
she/ must hear when once they were
alone.
pletely shut out as he, and tha unwel
come thought suggested itself that Til
lle might manage to see him alone If
she really wanted to. (
"Can it be that Tillle doesn't cara
to see me?" he asked himself, un
easily; "if it were' so wouldn't she tell
me?" . .
to study music, and his honest soul
had, rejoiced. How happy he would
be In having her bo" near. He could
see her often, and take her about a
good deal;' and it- would not be long
now before he could , tell her of the
great love that was In his heart, of
his hopes for the future, his plans for
her happiness. . .
But to his dismay he found Tillle
hedged about,. In a most Inexplicable
fashion, with formalities and conven
tions hitherto unknown.
Eight. young women had rented a
furnished house, and with an aunt
and 'uncle as housekeeper and pro
tector, were living in" a little world of
their own, superior to boarding-houses;
and with a fine â¢ contempt for "home*"
and institutions. Adams wasn't 'auite
sure whether the" aunt and uncle were
rented with the house, or if they were
really related to -one of these very
modern young women.
He called several times and was
cordially received; but upon every oc
casion at ' least three of the other
young ladles * were present, and re
mained during his entire stay. Then
he tried the plan of writing to Tillle,
inviting her to accompany him to a
lecture or concert. The little notes
he ' received in . reply were sweetly
courteous, ;Â¦ but he. felt somehow
thrown back upon himself â chilled and
repulsed.,, ,
"You must remember, that X. am only
one of eight," was the 'Â¦ tenor.' of Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ the
sweet little notes; "no one of us ac
cepts-an invitation "'for. herself alone.
Which one of the girls would you
like-to include , in your' very pleasant
plan for i Thursday ; evening, or Satur
day .afternoon?" etc. v
' Then he. settled down to : a regular
call on" Wednesday evenlnsr. He met
all'dfithe young ladies, and really had
better * opportunities for < conversing
wlthiany, one* of* the- others than with
'thelone he sought j Bright, pretty girls
they ".were,*; each earnest: in, her work,
with high aims and youthful ambitions.
An artist, a schoolteacher, a a
music teacher, a ; violinist, kindergart
ener and ; an editor made up the list.
: Often " there were other men there,
and Adams soon discovered that he was
not the only, one 1 who. would like to see
Tillle alone. After awhile he -began to
wonder if the:other men were as corn-
Â¦campered out Into tha hall and as
the stairs.
"Of course she'll refuse him." cried
the girl who wrote stories; "isn't ha
horrid?"
"No," answered the woman whÂ»
read stories; "ha Is manifesting tha
one needful quality, and Tillie will mar
ry him."
"If she doesn't." chimed in tha ar
tist, "it will show that aha Isn't bright
enough to recognize a great man in
the days of his obscurity."
"In which case." added tha girl with
the violin, "I shall try for him my
self."
This was the last, and certainly tha
most astounding. Each girl went
silently to her own room, feeling that
a great crisis had come in the life of
one of the eight.
Left alone, at last, with tha girl ha
loved. Adams made no movement to
approach her. Ilia eyes had never left
her face, and she -had not been able
to look aside even when her com
panions fled from the room.
"Tillle." the grave voice grew sol
emnly tender, "I have loved you for
years, and you have known It. Thera
was small need for me to declare a
love that had been yours since child
hood, and I would not seek to bind
you by any promise until I could offer
you a home as well as a heart. I am
now ready to do for you all that a man
can do for the woman ha loves. Coma
to me. Tillle, and tell me that my lova
is returnedâ that^ you will be my wife,
Tillleâ"
He held out his handâ the great.
bony hand that wore no rins and
could not play the piano: and tha
dark, homely face was illumined with
the mighty love and exceeding tender
ness that only a strong man knows. Â¦
The girl rose slowly, her eyes still
fixed on his. and moved toward him.
as If impelled by some stronger power.
Hailf way she stopped, and raised a
pitiful, pleading face to him.
"Abe," she whispered. "Abe. ara
you going, to make me come all the
way?" 5
He had intended to, but the passion
ate, thrlllinc: sweetness of his boyhood's
name overcame his resolve. One long
step and he caught her in his arms.
"All the way. sweetheart." he, an
ewered, "but I will carry you the other
half."

Of course, there are children whom
no one on earth could love, but I ques
tion if It be not the mother's fault. The
child who Is loved at home grows up
Â¦with a craving for love, which will
crop up, and love wins love in return
that keeps the heart warm and bright
despite the cruelties of fate.
There are many women who are
about as capable of filling the maternal
role as they would be to handle a pow
der magazine, and the fact of mother
hood does not always carry with It a
patent right to all the virtues to which
sentimentalists give It a clean bill of
sale.
There are many ways to love little
people and the more sensible and rea
sonable the love the greater will be the
respect engendered in a child's heart.
The foolish extravagant subservience
that some mothers lavish upon a child
is enough to disgust the little one it
self, who soon realizes that the mother
is too weak and Sacking In character to
instil into its mind and heart such pre
cepts as will best fit it for the battle of
life.
I do not think that too much love
ever spoiled a child or any one else,
but too little, with its burden of ne
glect, furnishes the timber filling out
per.al institutions.
Excessive, coddling with money ad
libitum ruins many children, who,
never being" allowed one moment with
out the attendance of a host of hire
lings, grow up without a thought or
ldea\>f that self-reliance which is the
fundamental principle of sturdy ma
turity.
It is. not the sons of moneyed kings
Â¦who forge a way to the top of our
great institutions, It is the men who
have had to dig their own way. who
win through their own pluck.
And the mother who molds the char
acter of such men deserves the meed
of praise.
The twentieth century idea that chil
dren are to be permitted to grow and
not be decently raised finds few advo
cates among sensible people, or those
who have at one time or another been
engaged in the strenuous- -occupation
of keeping a set of live, energetic
youngsters from making bonflrei of

B jOH? a.nce of the term â the
rÂ» r?^ "W^i money received In
pl^^r?^^ payment for labor. It
is, however, evident.
that to examine thoroughly the rewards
of labor In different countries and to
compare them, many other factors.
such as cost of living, would, call for
consideration. For, as Adam Smith
says ("Wealth of Nations," Bk. I.,
Chap. V.) "the real wa?es of labor may be said to consist of the auantlty of
the necessaries and conveniences of life that are given for It; its nominal wages
In the quantity of money. The laborer Is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded. In
proportion to real, not the nominal, wages of his labor." A comparison of
"real" wages would be an extremely difllcult. if not an impossible task The
best practicable substitute consists of an account of money wages, with the
reservation that the "real" wages may be, either greater or less than the
"money" wagesâ greater where the cost of living is low. less where this is
high. â¢
Even with reference to money wages it is impossible to give as exact a
comparison, when dealing with large classes In different countries, as v. hen
dealing with smaller classes or with individuals in the same country I sha
endeavor to present a fairly correct picture of the conditions which prevail
by first giving an estimate of the general average of wages in the three
countries in -whirh the conditions are most Interesting, viz.: America. Kng
land and Germany, and then by giving in more detail particulars of wages
In tucclal branches of Industry in several countries.
Let us take America first. An offlclal estimate (the Wage -Census) gives
J4S4 per year (3Ss 9d per week) as the general average of wages for the' whole
of the States. In the slave States, where the competition of cheap black la
bor is felt, the average runs from $211. to $395 per year (16s lid to 31s 6d per
week) In "the States around New York the general average is $493 per year
(29s 6d per week). I have made an estimate from the returns relating to
255 000 workers in the State of Massachusetts (published by the Massachu
setts Bureau of Statistics of Labor) and obtain an average of 42s 6d per
week, or a little more than the average above given. I do not know of any
offlcfal general average for this country, but Charles Booth gives particulars
of the wages of 75.000 workers in various trades in- London, and their average
is approximately 31s 9d per week.
In Germany particulars are recorded as to the wages of 10,000 employes
In various trades in Baden, and here the average is iss <a per wmk. tsroaq
averages such as these are, of course, liable to. certain errors, but probably
they are sufficiently accurate to give a fairly correct Impression of the gen
eral level of money wages fn the three countries. .
The employes have been. divided Into classes according to the amount of
their wages, those receiving under 20s per week forming one class, from 20s
to 25s the next class, and so on. The vertical height of each column repre
sents the number in each class out of a hundred work people. In England
it will be observed there Is a very large group in the classes ranging from
20s to 35s per week, and the numbers fall off rapidly above and below these
limits. Almost half the workers are In the two classes which earn from 23s
to 35s per week.
In America there is much more variety in the Incidence of wapes, and
the population Is much more evenly divided among the various classes. It is
Interesting to note that the proportion earning less than 2Qa a week Is near
ly twice as large as It is In this country. At the other extreme the figures
are more favorable to America; as ths number of people there v who earn
more than 45s per week is five times as great as It is here.
The diagram does not throw a very favorable light on the ; state of
wages in Germany. More, than half the wage earners appear to receive
less than 20s a week,, while the number of those receiving more than 30s a
week Is only 7 per cent., and, does not admit easily of a further division
Into classes. Indeed, in, order to get a complete picture of German wages
It Is necessary to subdivide further the group of wage earners receiving less
that 20s *a week. When' this Is done it is found that 12 per cent receive
less that 12s a week, 14 per cent receive from 12s to 15s a week and 20 per,
cent receive from 15s to 18sja week.
The mos't Important industry in every country is agriculture and on the
whole it is one of the worst paid. The following figures give an idea of the
rate of. pay given to agricultural laborers in various parts of the world.
In England the general average of wages of ordinary agricultural labor
ers is 17s a week .without* board. There are considerable variation* In dif
ferent parts of the co'untry; the rate being highest as a rule In the neigh
borhood of coal mines and, In other industrial centers. The highest rate ia
found in Durham and Is 20s 9d a week; the lowest. In Suffolk, is 14s 5d.
In America the general average is 17s lid a weekend the rate varies from
Â£1 IOs 2d in Washington to 12s in South Carolina. The lowest rate of ag
ricultural wages in the States is thus lower than the lowest In this coun-
On the Continent the wages of agricultural laborers are much lower than
the rates given above. For instance. In France the average Is 12s a week,
Dr .mark 9s to 10s, Belgium 9s Gd and in Hungary only 6s 3d. On the other
hand, in the colonies the average rates are higher than' either In .this coun
try or in the States. For instance, In Canada the general average Is 21s,
ivhiia thin is pvwpripri \n Manitoba and British Columbia. In the older col-
onles of Australia the average runs
from _10s to 20s a week with board, and
In Western Australia reaches 60s a
week, but this does not include board.
The mining industries show very
considerable variations. In coal mines
the following are average wages: -
s. d. s. d.
Austria ..... 10 0 to 14 0 per week
Belgium .... 15 fi to 21 0 per week
France 16 8 to 25 0 per week
Prussia 18 6 to 24 0 per week
In each of these cases the lower fig
ure refers to the wages of "putters"
and "trammers," while the higher
one refera-to those actually working at v .;â¢ T?neland the

State Library at Sacramento. Legislation was soon procured which gave
the trustees ample authority; not onlyto send out traveling libraries, but also
conferred the long-desired right to make the library otherwise helpful to the
State. 0:;^'' "â¢/.â¢ Â¦.Â¦*.'Â¦_
The State Library, established in 1850. has by the generous appropria
tions made for its increase become one _of the largest and best selected
State libraries In the Unlted^States; in fact, It Is surpassed. only by the State
Library of New York. :'But*during. the half century; of Its existence Us
functions have been, limitedfsolely to those, of a reference library, save
that a few State officials could borrow books for y : short periods. The time
was ripe for a change.^^ when the great; storehouse" of '120,000 volumes of his-,
tory, art, literature and lawâ -and; all other departments of knowledge
should become beneficial, to : Its ownersâ the people of California.. The, first
liberal measure of recent adoption to be described Is that of ' individual
loans outside of Sacramento.. Responsible Individuals and all approved In
stitutions throughout the State may now borrowâ perferably through their
local library or the/school authoritiesâ any volume which In the Judgment
of the State Librarian can be spared, or which Is not of such rarity aÂ» to
forbid loaning. 'Such books may be borrowed for two weeks, subject ordi
narily to renewal for the same length of time.- The sole conditions are good
care of the' books and payment of all express charges.
Special stress Is laid by the State Library upon the value of this work,
and no paina will be'spared to accommodate all applicants, regardless of
their, location., in the State., Teachers and women's clubs will find this
boon to t>#'of the highest vaiue in thalr studies.

No two" States have exactly the same educational problems. Hence, be
fore undertaking the dispatch of traveling libraries, the State library
trustees determined to send State Librarian James L. Glllls on an exten
sive tour of investigation and comparison of the traveling library systems
in the East, bo that the best features of their work might be Incorporated.
If desirable, in our own. During his month's absence Mr. Gillis visited
many State and public' libraries, was' everywhere received with special
courtesy, had every facility for -Information opened to him. with promise
of subsequent co-operation.* His report to the trustees indicates that he
was profoundly Impressed with the value of the work as a 'whole and hear
tily believes in Its widespread adoption In California.
TtteHrustees Immediately voted to send out fifty traveling 'libraries of
fifty volumes each as early as possible and they are now in process of
preparation. These 2500 selected volumes' have been purchased in the East
and will form the basis of a duplicate department of the State library, for
It has never been contemplatedâ as has been erroneously supposedâ to de
plete the existing collections on the shelves by large drafts on them for
traveling library purposes.
The rules governing the issue of traveling libraries are very simple.
They will be loaned to any community now without a public library.
Five resident taxpayers must organize as a local library association and
must pay *3 In advance for transportation of the library both ways. Other
details may be learned by correspondence addressed to the traveling li
brary department of the State library. %
â¢ - â¢ -V.* ji
Inevltabiy 1 the question arises, will this library extension work be a
success? , Before seeking an answer, let us look fit some of the prevailing
conditions. It would seem as if It were supremely appropriate that the
traveling library should have a permanent home among us because of the
peculiar topography of the State. The vast areas and the great mountain
ranges of California ordain the . existence of hundreds of scattered hamlets
and villages that will never be able to support a local library. For that
very reason the State should reach out its helping hand and say to the boy
and girl, the lonely housekeeper and the telling man. "You shall not, be
cause of your Isolation, be deprived of the mental life and power which
comes through the reading of good books; It Is your birthright." Such read-
Ing is part of the education which every State in. this age of the world
should give to those of its youth and adults who desire it. No argument
is needed that without such knowledge there cannot be realized the Indis
pensable qualification of a democracyâ the best citizenship.
In further seeking a solution of our question we cannot be unmindful
of the far-reaching results that may flow from this work. It is not merely
a proposition of a few hundred libraries circulating throughout the State,
but rather, what ia to be their effect?â to what will they lead?
Said Oliver Wendell Holmes, when asked at what time a child's educa
tion should begin: "A hundred years before he Is born."
To -our query then we may briefly reply, that, like other worthy enter
prises, the results will largely depend on the management. Rarely does
there come to any body of men an opportunity to do finer work for a great
State than is now presented to the trustees of the State Library. A new
educational field is to be occupiedâ fortunately with the use of ample
meansâ yet there, is another imporant factor to be secured. This Is noth
ing less than the' good will and co-operation of the people. No measure for
the uplifting and enlightenment of the masses ever succeeds if It falls to
command that element divineâ human sympathy.
From the known strong interest of the State Library Trustees, the
deep concern of Governor Pardee In all educational matters and the well
founded belief that our leading educators will counsel and assist, there is
no room to doubt that the future of library Interests in California Is as
sured.
As time rolls on, to all race lovers comes more and more the con
sciousness'that .
"The education of the people Is the real underlying work for earnest
men who would best serve their country." â¢
. Â¦ . Â¦ 2 jc educational measure Is now In view which demands the
]^^s-fc-^sr| sympathy and widespread attention of the people of Caii-
Â£Â» fornia. It Is a part of a movement which has for its ob
j*Â»j&//^ra<Â«*|) J >(1 lh<? helping of every person, young or old, to broader
</*/^-^Vc^B views of life, to a wider outlook on the world, to a culti
; Ti'W^| vation of the best lhat is in them. These alms are to be
T/d^"-Jifc~^. \ accomplished, first, by a general use of traveling libraries;
JjXjtliauLaqggBg second, by an extension of public libraries to every place
which Is able to support one. . :- '* \
The traveling library is easily described. It is simply a little collection
of books of varied selectionsâ usually of fifty volumesâ sent from a center to
places more or less remote. Its object, like that of the public library, Is thÂ«
recreation and Instruction of the people. The most noticeable feature js
seen In the fact that the book is brought to the individual. Instead of com
pelling him to go weary distances to the library. It Is free to all, excepting
transportation charges. f'Jr'--
The ready response to the widespread use of the traveling library In all
parts of our country reveals the longing of the common people for quickened
Intelligence and broader knowledge. They have long waited for such a help
and now cheapness of printing and transportation and rapid communication
combine to make the wish a reality. California is distinguished among her
sister States for zealous educational efforts which have given her schools and
universities exceptional rank. What then has been done In traveling library
work? With the exception of several scores of libraries sent out by women's
clubs, which have done valuable pioneer work, nothing has been accom
plished. Organized womanhood stands for the best in this, as In all other
uplifting plans for the State.
The States of New York, Michigan, Ohio. Wisconsin, Iowa and others
have for many years past found this labor, conducted by the various library
:ommiEslons, to be of the most productive they have undertaken; in fact, it
s Impossible to estimate the educational value of the missionary purpose
tvhlch these Itinerant libraries have performed. They have been sent to min
ing and forest camps, to distant hamlets and towns shut away from close
touch with the world, to little villages whose local libraries are struggling to
live, to granges, schools, societies without number and women's clubs, every
where carrying the refining and elevating influences which are the message
of good literature.
Surely It was with prophetic vision that Horace Mann, the distin
guished educator of Massachusetts, forty years ago exclaimed, "Had I the
power I would scatter libraries over the whole land, as a sower sows hla
wheat field."
The charge of indifference to this great popular movement can no longer
be made against California, for preliminary steps have been officially taken
to a wide and general use of traveling libraries. The Initiative was .effected
a year ago by the California Library Association, which after due discussion
succeeded in obtaining the Interest and. co-operation of the trustees of the
Â¦Â¦Â¦!Â¦Â¦! ii n HOUGH we sometimes speak of the great importance and
t '" ir " W * T ", pi the wondrous power of sympathy, too few realize how In-
I IS conceivably potent Is its function In the formation^of hu
oVr JRevS man cnaracter - Especially powerful Is its influence over
SyVcg the tender feelings of a child. In his joys and sorrows
v^** ;Fcm a every child wishes some one to share. At every turn he
w Â¦Â¦n-jui.TWTTTTT-a needs, and should have, the tenderest sympathy of the lov
ing parent. Too often he receives no sympathy where he
has a right to expect It.
The child who has injured himself is made no better by being told, "It
serves you right; be more careful next time." "I told you you would hurt
yourself." Such a statement will tend to Btir up all that # ls worst in any
child, but especially in the child of some temperaments. ',
Parents must ever remember, and never forget, then, that sympathy Is
the strongest bond of union between human hearts. It is not -possible for -
any heart to shut Itself against it. When all else has failed it will prove to,
be the most powerful factor In reclaiming the lost. Indeed, it seems almost
Impossible to exaggerate the strength of the influence which it exerts in
forming character and in regulating the habits of all. If a child feels
that you sympathize with him he will imitate you, and you can .mold him
almost at will.
As children grow older their habits become firmly fixed, and determine
character. That which is once fixed in a child's mind . through loving
sympathy will scarcely ever be removed, even by the moat skillful argu
ment. Each one of us can trace most changes in ourselves to the Influence
of some one whom we loved, 'because of the sympathy which was shown
us. It may have been silent sympathy. It may have* been almost or en
tirely unconscious. It was none the less powerful.
The child who loves the parent and feels that he possesses the parent's
sympathy needs but little admonition or criticism. When he perceives
what the parent wishes the, bond of sympathy tends to firmly establish
the desired principles. Be assured that In no way can any parent gain
such power over a child for the purpose of shaping his character as by
manifesting warm sympathy with the .child. Next to a lack of loving
kindness there Is no more potent cause of unhapplness to children than a
lack of sympathy In those from whom they have a right to expect It.
Almost every person has wondered at the peculiar, potfer and action of
sympathy. One child starts to cry, and nearly all the young children present
will do the same, as if they had been Injured also. The actress feigns
great grief, and two-thirds of the audience Join with her In' shedding tears.
Or one or two start to laugh, and, In a short time it will spread to the whole
company, though none may be able to tell why they are laughing. Some
one sneezes or yawns and many others do the same. \,A Joke which Is
scarcely, understood by a single heare r will set a whole audience- into
sympathetic laughter. ,
It would thus seem, that there Is some mysterious. Inexplicable power
In sympathy. By this power the mental or physical conditions of one may
be communicated to others, Increasing in intensity as It passes from one
to another. Since this is so, need we wonder that that sympathy, prompted
by. holiest, love, should have such an all-powerful effect upon children, who
are bo "delicately deeply sensitive, to every influence? .
Some may assert that there is no difference between sympathy and love.
If this is the caBe,; then, having considered the power of love and kind
ness, we are not Justified In spending even a few minutes In the/con
sideration of sympathy. But are they the same? Love may. be" upon one
side alone, and therefore . unappreciated and without any power of affect
ing the object loved. It is not so with sympathy. Sympathy Is two-fold.
It starts as a response to an express need. It is an answer to a call for
it, whether â¢ expressed in words or ; not. It is therefore certain of grateful
recognition, even where love Is neither felt nor welcome.
v As .before - stated, next' to love, there Is nothing a child needs so much
as sympathy. It is : much easier for a parent to love a child than to give
the child the'sympathy which. It should have. ' Parental ! love is natural. It
may not be unnatural, but It is. comparatively 'seldom r. that a parent is
found who, shows. great sympathy with his child In both work and play.
When such. a) parent is noticed it is considered worthy of remark, if not re
markable. UThiB may Beema; strong statement, but It is believed that it will
bear the test, of Investigation.' '
Let the reader ask himself the questions: "How many playthings have
I taken home to my child? Of these, how many have I taken time to enjoy
with the child in play? How many books have I purchased for him? How
many of them have I enjoyed with him or even made Inquiry concern-
Ing? Of the things lost how many have I simply replaced? Concerning the
lost how many have I really sympathized with the dear child in his then
great sorrow?" Truthful answers to such questions as the above will give
a parent some idea as to .whether or not he is showing that sympathy to
which every child is entitled. SflSpl
v To sympathize. with a child you must be able to put yourself in the
child's place and feel as a child. You must forget that you ara not a
child. any. longer. By being a child again 'for a few minutes you will not
only make the child love and adore you, but you will again renew your
youth and be the better and the stronger because of it-
Let it be acknowledged, then' that the most effective way of securing
that confidence and love of children which make their management
easy- Is by sympathizing with them in their hopes, in their fears, in their
sorrows, in their plays and in their work. Certain It Is that the parent
who does not sometimes descend into the world in which the child lives
as a sharer of its fears and sorrows and not as Â« faultfinder or even as
a counselor cannot have the fullest power over the child.
NlneAlmes out of tenâ yes, ninety-nine times out of & hundredâ the
child does not mean to do wrong. The right kind of sympathy will have a
more powerful effect at this time than at any other, for the heart is es
pecially open to Buch influences when bowed down by grief.
Why should not the loving parent sympathize with the weakness
which has resulted in some folly? - ; Then is the time a child is most happy
to turn for advice and, comfort to some one stronger than he. God for
give the parent who could turn an unsympathetic ear to a penitent child's
cry.
Foolish is the parent, and not often truthful, who tells the child he does
not understand how he can be so bad'. Hard-hearted he who can turn such
a child away without the sympathy to which he is entitled. If he does this
he need not be surprised if, at the same time, he builds between himself and
his child a barrier which will probably never be removed.

Ten Bones

Naturally this put quite a crimp in Barrington's business and set him
behind with the landlord and the crocer. Fact is, it put him on his uppers,
for he had no working capital.
When the votes were counted and it was found that the reform ticket
came in second, word was passed down the line to Â£0 ahead, and business
at once picked. up with Barrington. -Â¦'. .
The first case in which he was retained was that of one Musrer Mulligan,
alias Squint-Eye the Brute. Muggsy was pinched on the charge of having
removed from the Person of'another one sparkler and three steel engravings
done by Uncle Sam, having a face value of one hundred dollars each. *
Not less than seven persons whose veracity could not be questioned had
seen Muggsy turn the trick, and it looked like a cinch that he would have
to do a bit
Now it came to pass that a municipal election had to be pulled off, Â»o
the pkin clothes men passed out the tip to the grafters to ease up a bit until
the votes were cast.
Despite the fact that Barrington had been. busy before the bar for some
fifty-odd years.- he had not been able to run up a stack of blues, for the rea
ioa that whenever his clients were caught with the goods they were relieved
of them before Barrington arrived. Then, too, Barrington's wife was an
avvi'ul spender, and always went through his clothes in the morning befort
waking him up.
Earrington stood ace high with porch-climbers and all-around .crooks,
r.::d enjoyed the distinction of having saved more men from rock pile and
striped apparel than the clcrgv. . I >
Once upon a time there was a foxy old geezer of the name of Barring
ton Blackstone Bellows.
Barrington was a criminal lawyer, and a wonder in his line. He was on
to all the fine points of his business, had the penal code down pat and was
pitted with a line of talk that was always good for an acquittal on the first
ballot.
Such little things as the evidence and the Judge's charge amounted to
notl.ing to a jury that had heard Barrington tell his side of the storv.
Whenever he stood up in front of the box, looked appealingly into thÂ«
t.ves oi the twelve men good and true, shed a quart of tears and pointed hiÂ»
trwnbiing finger at the grief-stricken wife of the accused, the jury was with
him to a man. and that was about all there was to it.
When Barrington was called in he guaranteed to save Mucks v the trou
ble of doing time for the sum of three hundred dollars. Barnnsrton hap
pened to need just about that amount of money, but for some reason or
other did not seem desirous of possessing a diamond.
When the case came up for trial the eye-witnesses told exactly how the
Job was done, and then Barrintrton got busy.
It took him just two hours to convince the jury that his client was inno
eent, and as usual there was an acquittal the first dash out of the box.
. After thanking the iurv and receiving the congratulations of his friends
Muggsy paid'Barrington three one hundred dollar bills for his services.
When Barrington returned to his office he shut himself up in the consul
tation room and heaved a sieh of relief. He was out of the hole, and his
heart was glad. He footed iio his outstanding tabs and found that thev came
to. two hundred and sixtv simoleons flat He was strong enouzh to take
them up and still be forty to the good.
.Contentment settled do\yn upon his . pallid dome, and he felt that ioy
which comes to a man when he breaks even on the consolation iackoot
He I fingered, his roll with a satisfied unction and pictured the obsequious
delight with which his tab-holders would write "received payment" over

It was at this moment that a knock came at the door and a delicate

TALE OF THE MAN WHO GOT OUT OF A HOLE AND FELL BACK AGAIN
"Mrs. Ame
lia's Ambi
tion Was to
Boa Back
Somersault
From th.6
Top Bound
of the
Social
Ladder."
By
Nicholas
Nemo
where all that a woman who wanted to give the social mill a twist or two
had to do was to throw a shawl over her head and i drop into a few back
doors to break the news. Now back doors are ; scarce in the metropolis
and Mrs. Amelia was soon up against ithe fact '. that , the :. unfortunate indi
vidual who attempted to butt in without having been : properly accredited to
the powers that are most of the time would get a reception '- that would
make a refrigerator look like a kitchen range in full blast.
As a result of this slight oversight on her part, Mrs. Amelia's first ef
fort was attended by pretty much everything except the guests that she
most wanted and success. Her experience in this round taught her that she
was away behind in the latest methods of getting her name at the top of
the column of society notes. Being not devoid of guile, and realizing that
neither Rome nor Newport was built in a day she determined to put her
self in training for the next event. The retired society leader whom she
called in to coach her on the latest rules for infighting and. breaking 'away
among the "best people*' told her that thesine qua non was to eet hersslf
talked about. As an opening? lead she suegefted a divorce suit When Mrs:
Upandatit broached the subject to Mr. U. she was surprised to find that he
had conscientious scruples tucked a\?iy in some' out-of-the-wav corner of
his soul, a^id besides he was too busy to be bothered with trifles just then.
The cruelty of modern husbands is bÂ»vonH be'ief.
When she failed to move her incumbrance to a sense of his Christian
duty in the case. Mrs. Upandatit fe t for ?. few days that her name was
really Upagainstit. More than ever she realized that eternal climbing: is the
price of getting one's name in the list of those present. But her trainer
bade her be of good cheer, the experience of said trainer having tausjht her
that a fight is never over till the count is finished. As a substitute for a
divorce suit she advised Mrs. Upandatit to try a Newport cottage and a
steam yacht; to be sure there is nothing particularly original in either of
these methods of treating but they are standard remedies that are
guaranteed to cure all but the most stubborn cases, and Mrs. Amelia found
that they would do all that was recommended for them. â¢
For a long time she congratulated herself that she had the. upper crust
rolled out thin with her initials stamped on it in big letters. Even a com
mon, ordinary cottlHonfest was good for a column any day. in the week, and
her masked ball a la simian kept the society reporters; busy for at least three
days. Her rivals were on the keen iump to stay iri sight of her. but most
of them had to wear thick-veijs to keen her dust out of -, their eyes at that,
MiÂ» uniiMi^ RS. AMELIA I. UPANDATIT was a woman with -an am-'
r /â Vâ 3^, bition. Being a woman, th2t is equivalent to saying that
ffr7/. /^f*r&k E ' lc was * ntcnt on doing one of two things â to cast a vote
I â¢y&Jft\fl a or to climb the social ladder and do a back somersault on
/ $^HhA a l * ie t0Â£> roun d- rs - Amelia's most heartfelt desire was
]>**Â¦ "-jQJ^ to do the social stunt. There wasn't room for the idea ot
iTj voting to enter her head. As far as she was concerned
the glorious cause of universal franchise might have been carted out into the
broad Atlantic and dropped overboard in the deepest place.
It wasn't long, however, before Mrs. Upandatit began to give a high-class
imitation of Mr. Alexander, late of Macedon, in his renowned act of sighing
:cr more worlds over which to cast the protecting mantle of benevolent
assimilation. As a result of this sighing habit of Mrs. Amelia's, her negli
gible fraction had it borne in upon his cerebral upholstery that it had arrived
to him, as our French friends would say, to get out and hustle in a field
that would give the speaking member of the firm a little more elbow room.
She was aweary of the dreary social round of Lonesomevillc, and besides
there were a few people there who were of the opinion that she was some
what short of being the whole show for the reason that her great grandfather
hadn't been obliging enough to get himself turned into an imitation of a
sieve in some of the battles wherein our forefathers demonstrated their abil
ity to do their own tax dodging. Another objection that these absurd people
made to Mrs. Upandatit was that the had never been inoculated with the
Boston brand of culturine virus. Therefore, stid Mrs. Amelia, it is our
move.
Being a man and for that reason a model of prompt and unquestionable
obedience, her husband cast his eyes cautiously around the horizon in
search of some bourne where grandfathers don't count and culture is un
known; some place where diplomas cease from troubling and ancestors
axe at rest The locality that seemed to him to about fill the bill was a
certain village that lies between the Hudson River and Long Island Sound,
where the boundaries of the United States Steel Corporation- and the Ship
building Trust intersect. Mr. Upandatit had a few trusts concealed about his
person and he was of the opinion that if he could get past theg corner of
Wall and Broad streets without being held up he could make good on a lit
t'e scheme or two of his own. j, .a, ]Â¦Â¦ Â¦'Â¦'.)Â¦
Thus it came about that in the course of time the Upanditits were
duly installed in the island that is situated as aforesaid and Mrs. Upandatit
was launched upon her career of social illumination. Her ideas of the
proper way to pull off a society function were of the Lonesomeville variety,
and Mr. Upandatit was working night and day to keep the visible supply of
dust up to the legal requirement. When the Count von Wurzberger spent
two weeks in America collecting extensive material for' his new book on
'"Things That Never Happen in der Vereinigten Stadten," Mrs. Upandatit
got together a swell handout for him that he sincerely assured her was fully
equal to the best free lunch in the old country. When the other society
heavyweights heard of the Count's warm praise they turned so green with
envy that the whole town looked like a St Patrick's day parade on its
native sort. . I'',- . ....
The casual observer might conclude from these few indications that
Mrs." Upandatit was justified in thinking that she had at last arrived with
both feet and room to spare, but the evidence was not all in yet In the
course of her excursions into the best families of the island that brilliant
luminary was frequently stumbling over names that didn't seem to figure
largely on her visiting list. When she conferred with her trainer that person
age informed her that they were the descendants of the first settlers, who
were of the opinion that they had been set apart in the original arrange
ment cf the universe, and were henceforth and forever more to remain
quiet and ruminate on their exalted and unassailable position. She also in
formed Mrs Upandatit that they were neither rich nor prominent in so
ciety but that an invitation to Sunday night tea in their back parlor was
more' to be desired than a full column on the front page of the Daily
Whirled ora place in the front rank of the Vanderbilk's german.
. This kind of talk was calculated to make Mrs. Upandatit go down into
her brown study, which she kept swept and aired for just such occasions,
but for the first time in her life she failed to dig up the right kind of a plan
for the conquest of the new field. She had thought that she stood on the
top round of the ladder: she discovered that her ladder was only a fire es
cape and that the real thine wasn't even on her side of the block. The rest
of the story is very brief, but extremely pathetic. Mrs. Upandatit hap
pened to run against one of these samples of the real article at a meeting
of the woman's committee for the provision of sexing machines lor the
Cannibal Islanders. Mrs. Realthing had never heard Mrs. Upandatit s name
before zrtd got it wrong four times in five minutes. That was enough lor
Mrs Upandatit: she returned home and gently but firmly died that rncrht of
mortification of the egomaniac nerve, complicated by ingrown ambitioa
Her sad fate teaches us the useful lesson that the atmosphere in high
altifudes is extremely rar.fied. and that the reason that there is so much
room at the top is that there are so few people there, and the ones who have
arrived put in most of their time holding down their places.

Finally, about midnight, when the
crowd surrounding Leatherwood car
ried crimson paint brushes and were
all telegraphically hilarious, the fol
lowing telegram was received and read:
"ROME. March. 1SS1.
A new Mayor of a newly Incorporate*

found anywhere, and the smaller thÂ«

a publlo-splrlted little gentleman
known to fame as Bob Leathsrwood.
The Western Union Telegraph Com

months In advance of the completion
of the railroad and the dtlzens, under
the leadership of Mayor Bob, organized
an Impromptu celebration, consisting*
mainly of "setting them up" for each

sent off telegrams of congratulation to
the Governors of California* New York
and other States and the Mayors of Ban
Francisco. New York, ; Chicago and
other cities. In the evening answers to
these dispatches arrived and were read
by Mayor Bob to the' crowd In the

brating was conducted. A. pair of un
principled wags obtained /some receiv

graph messenger boy, and when thÂ»
genuine dispatches began to give out
faked dispatches were concocted and
delivered. A telegram purporting to
come from President Arthur congratu
lated the Mayor of Tucson on the con
nection of his city with the Federal
capital by wire. Then came a telegram
from Lord Beaconsfleld to the Illustri
ous Mayor of Tucson, saying: "Her
Majesty the Queen desires me to ex
press her personal and official delight
at being in touch with you. and hopes
that the harmonious relations between
Tucson and London may never be dis

When you come back I give you half

The tenderfoot who availed himself of
the offered opportunity was, upon the
completion of the transaction, arrested
immediately by a Deputy Marshal for
selling liquor to an Indian. "His indict

his friend . lost the case ~Â«nd ha ! remem%

tew thousand aouars io spare, I con

to . Europe. In Paris I received' a let
ter from a banker in a mining town
where my home had been, inclosing a
quitclaim deed to him of a one-third
Interest' in the Kempton mining claim,
and saying that if I would sign it I
could draw on. him for $500. I did not
know of any such claim, or of owner
ship of any mining claim in that dis
trict, and I did not think it safe to
take the money, so I wrote him brief
ly, declining the offer, giving no rea
son for my declination and stating that
I would" soon be back. Some months
afterward on my return to 'my, former
home the same gentleman called on
me, told me that the mine was look-
Ing better and offered me $3000 for my
interest. I said I would look into It
and let him . know in a few days. I
visited the district where the mine was,
searched the records and found my
name along with those of one Kempton
and one Hamilton signed to a. notice of
location of 'the Kempton mining claim.
I did not know either of these gentle
men and inquiry developed the fact
that they had sold their two-thirds
Interest to my banker friend some
months . before and - that Kempton was
dead and Hamilton had left thÂ» Terri
tory. I interviewed the banker and
stated the facts to him and
agreed to accept $5000 for. any Interest

The trustees of the principal mining
companies created a milling corpora
tion and contracted with themselves
to crush all the ore at a high price
per ton. The rich ore was mixed with
poor ore and the poor ore with bedrock
and the stock of the milling company
paid dividends while the stockholders
of the mining companies paid assess
ments.
Two humble adventurers In the lar
ceny line resorted' to more primitive
methods of obtaining other people's
property. They were employed in the
assaying and melting room of one of
This being accomplished the superin
tendent hauled up and detached the
wire cable, took out some necessary
pieces of machinery, closed and locked
the hoisting house, and placed a trusted
ally on guard. That night he rode on
horseback to the railroad station forty
miles away, caught the train and the
next day at noon was in San Fran
cisco. His relative was a man of large
resources and within three days they
had quietly bought up two-thirds of
the stock in the mine. Then the im
prisoned men were released, work was
resumed, the bonanza was developed
and within one month the stock had
advanced from $8 to $600 per share, and
the trust-betraying scoundrel â for he
was nothing else â was worth $7,000,000,
and was at once admitted to social and
business communion with all the other
magnates of the Comstock.
Another "operator" In charge of a
bank loaned the money of Its stock
holders to mining corporations to en
able them to continue development
work in advance of the collection of
assessments. If the company "struck
It rich," something happened to the
pumping machinery and the shaft filled
with water. The "operator" and his
friends bought in the stock, then the
mine was pumped out. the bonanza un
covered and more millionaires were
created.
Breaches of trust by which millions
were obtained were as brazen as the
dissipations of the millionaires. To this
day men relate as an exhibition of
financial and business acumen the act
of a California mining boss and county
politician who at a low ebb in his for
tune was 6ent to a relative to take
charge of a quartz mine In Nevada.
The mine was owned by a corporation
and its shares were selling at $8 each
In the San Francisco Mining Stock
Board, for no considerable body of ore
had been found. One afternoon the
superintendent was present when the
miners broke Into an ore body which
two hours' work with the picks dis
closed to be enormously rich and ex
tensive. Obviously the plain duty of
the manager was to make public the
news or at least to communicate it to
the stockholders, whose trustee he was.
Instead of doing so he ascended to the
surface, hastily collected bedding,
blankets, cooked food, wines, liquors
and cigars and lowered them down the
Â£00- foot shaft, accompanied by a note
to the shift boss stating that the men
might cease work and make themselves
comfortable; that they would be kept
there for a few days, during which time
their pay would go on; that each man
would receive $100 as a gratuity, and
that the families of those imprisoned
would be told that an accident to the
machinery was the cause of their de
tention.

Some of the great fortunes of the
Comstock lode came to their possessors
through methods which elsewhere
would have made those who practiced
them candidates for the striped suit
of the convict rather than the toga of
the Senator, and would have entailed
general obloquy rather than general
esteem. The impulse which begets and
directs the "sacred golden fury" Is usu
ally ap impulse of the pit, and those
who are inflamed by it often prepare
for the mad race by stripping them
selves of conscience and turning deaf
ears to the monitors of good faith and
honor. The evil consequences are not
confined to a few. The paresis of In
tegrity which results extends to the
masses and lessens the moral upright
ness of those who neither participate
in the dishonest act nor share in the
plunder. Often, indeed, the baleful in
fluence thus created extends .to and
poisons the literature of the . period.

amalgam, a few pounds at a time, un
til In the course of a year's time they
had stolen and carried away over one
hundred thousand dollars' worth. How
to market their goods was a problem.
ComEtock bullion had an Identity of Its
own and any offered for sale outside of
the regular channels would arouse
suspicion and 'might result In detec
tion. In this dilemma they took Ras
cal Number Three Into partnership.
Rascal Number Three had a few thou
sand dollars capital. There was a bank
rupt mining corporation called the
Hornet that owned an abandoned mine
and a dismantled live-stamp mill In a
decayed mining: district about forty
miles from where the stolen bullion
was hidden. Rascal Number Three
was a skillful metallurgist and miner,
lie bought up the Hornet stock for a
trifle and took possession of the prop
erty. With a far night Journey he
transported the bullion In a spring
wagon to the old mill. Then he re
opened the Hornet mine and with the
aid of the two thieves refitted the mill
and began crushing the ore. There
was svme silver in the Hornet ore and
to the actual yield the conspirators
added a portion of the stolen bullion
until it all was marketed. While this
was in progress, the continual yield
from the Hornet gave Its stock a mar
ket value and it was fed to the public
at gradually advancing prices. It was
estimated that the three clever rascals
cleaned up a hundred thousand dol
lars each.

Reflections of Thomas Fitch
14At lest they reached a wondrous tree whose twig* and boughs were white,
And the sight they saw therein, my loves, filled them, both with fright.
They scampered to a spot secure and regained their courage keen,
And then retraced their steps across the plain of whitened green.
With courage that was splendid, Grandpa Prune went to the tree,
With Crookneck Squash a pace behind and trembling at the knee.
In the tree all clothed in white were beings strange and funny,
And all of them were seeking spots that were warm and bright and
sunny.
"I think that we are strong enough," said Grandpa Prune in time,
'â¢To capture all these beings strange and whip them into line.
Ill talk to them and see if they will tell to you and me
Why they're perched and how they got up in this magic tree."
"While you're talking," Crookneck said, "111 run and get a cagÂ«
So we'll be safe in case they all should fly into a rage."
Trembling Crookneck dashed away, and Grandpa planned and thought
And felt quite sure the dwellers strange in time should all bo caught
Timid Crookneck soon returned with a cage and other things,
Including a fishing rod and net and a trap with sprightly springs.
"Twere wise, dear Crookneck," Grandpa said, "that you should shake tha
And if the' strangers lose their hold, they'll come straight unto me."
Old Crookneck gave tha tree a shake and many tumbled down-
Some in black and yellow shells and some in shells of brown,
Grandpa chased one little chap many times around the cage,
And became fatigued, which was not strange, if you only knew his ago.
With tact and great diplomacy the strangers all were captured,
And as a result the captors bold were very much enraptured.
When all were safely in the cage eld Grandpa called the roll,
While Crookneck stirred them all about with a long, sharp-pointed pole.
A double-Jointed Peanut was the first to speak his name,
And Crookneck made fr*â¢ dance about until his legs were lame.
The others who responded when Grandpa said: "Who's here?"
All trembled very greatly and their voices showed much fear.
When the 'roll had been completed old Grandpa said In glee:
"We've captured many hundred nuts and I'm full of ecstasy.
We have a dapper Filbert and a Walnut black as jet
And a Pecan trim and tidy who will make a pretty pet.
The lis{ shows we've a Hazel and an Almond sleek and yellow
And a satin-coated Chestnut, who seems a charming fellow.
We've 'Nigger Toes' and Hickories and Chinkapins so fine,
And of our captured Acorns I've already counted nine.
We've Pistachios by the hundreds and Beech Nuts one or two,
And two dainty little Xdchees that are Chinese through, and through.
Dear Crookneck, we've done wonders and our fortune should be great,
And I t**"*' our golden glory' will flow throughout the State."
Grandpa Prune and Crookneck wheeled the cage to Pumpkinton,
To where folks swarmed in masses till the setting of the sun.
fOKDERS ne'er -will cense, It seems, In the Wonderful
Kingdom great,
And as long as there are ears to hear there'll be
wonders to relate.
A week or so ago, my sweets, there came. on a Heecs
lined cloud
The Honorable Mr. Jacky Frost, who was haughty,
bold and proud.
He anchored his cloud on a hilltop high and swept
down to a plain,
Where he gleefully blew his chilling breath time and
time again.
Grcndpa Prune and Crookneck Squisn soon learned that heM arrived,
And they kept close to his heels to see the wonders he'd contrived.
Over hills and down through dales they trudged till dusk of day,
And marveled at the whiteness which he scattered on his way.

BERLIN, Dec. 5.â Weary of the best
cigars the world affords, tired of ciga
rettes presented to him by the Sultan,
the Emperor had taken to smoking a
pipe before the surgical operation on
his throat was performed. Perhaps
the monarch wished to flatter his peo
ple, for certainly the pipe Is one em

As he never does things by halves,
his Majesty ordered several pipes.
But he had his favorite, a pipe made
after his own design. The b6Vl N egg
shaped, is of meeschaum. as befits an
Imperial pipe, for, as all smokers know,
a good meerschaum pfpe needs more
care than a good baby. The stem is of
Turkish wild cherry wood. Where the
stem enters the trowl a big "W" is
carved on the meerschaum. Silver
branches twine in and around the
"W," and on a branch is seated a sil
ver bird. The branches, elongated,
form a scroll effect around the bottom
of the bowl.

Â§ DUCHESS DIRECTS AFFAIRS.
The Cuke appears to be taking very
little interest in the change that is be ;
ing effected, everything being done un
der the direction of the Duchess. There
appears to have been a difference of
opinion between them with regard to
the disposal of the 'estates to the ten
ants under the- new land act. The Duke
would like to be an Irish landlord, but
the Duchess didn't want to be respon
sible for the maintenance of the estate,
and she would not hear of the trouble
of having to collect rents from a people
in a semi-impoverished state. In this,
too, she- is having- hes way, and the
farms jand small holdings will be sold
to tenants according to their necessi
ties. The Duke is allowed to retain a
small portion of the estate for shooting
purposes.

remarks upon the London weather. In

what remains of my time here In be
coming acquainted with this wonderful
old metropolis. The thoroughfares,
with their quaint names and surprising
gateways into .sequestered quietness,

"When the days are very wet and terrific

LONDON, Dec.v5.â Beautiful Kyle
more Castle, is undergoing a transfor
mation since it came into the hands of
the American, Duchess of Manchester.
Tlie experts who pronounced it, before
it, was. sold recently, to be one of the
finest "mansions in Great Britain, will
not know it in a few months from how.
Externally, there will be no change, but
inside the ancient place is being pulled
to pieces as fast as the builders' men
can move. A perfect system of heating
on American -principles is being intro
duced, and. in other, ways the castle is
being made comfortable, in accordance
with modern ideas.; A special suite of
apartments Is i being arranged for the
nursery. a.nd playrooms. The servants'
quarters are also undergoing a change.
Hitherto they were distributed all over
homes of comfort and quietness, could
not help remarking on Its difference
from any club In the. United Stages.
"We have nothing whatever like It in
the States," she remarked to the secre

"No? This Is a club where we do
nothing."
"Ah," answered the American. "Noth

learned to do In America."
It is to be a club more of this order

It was only 700 years ago from the
authorization of trial by Jury In land
disputes in England till private war
was wholly abolished in England, and
the Parliament which did this came
into existence 100 years after trial by
jury was authorized. Already the na
tions have authorized trial by Jury in
all controversies.. Remembering when
wager of battle was abolished the coun
ty seats in England were farther from
London than the capital of the nations
now are, it is hard to escape from the
conclusion that an International Parlia
ment will come into existence as Eng
land's Parliament did, much more
speedily as time for travel and com
munication diminishes, and that^ this
Parliament will do, in say 100 year3
under twentieth century conditions,
what It took the English Parliament
600 years to do under ancient condi

sixth my brain gave out. You see, I
could sleep only a couple of hours each

and board. I got the board."
"How did you set home?"
"I had a good father," the actor put
it. "But you will understand with that
sort of thing as a starter that .the work
I have now does not seem excessive."
"And then came?"
v. "More barnstorming. I virtually
barnstormed for , four ; years. Most ac
tors have done it and most are ashamed
of it. I don't see why.. Every one must
have a start. Of course, one gets into
bad habits, but with a good stagei,man
ager you soon get out of them."
"Your voice, you always had that â
no, I forgot," I 'recalled.
"It was really a bad, weak voice
when I began," the_ actor repeated, in
its. pleasant depths. "I studied sing
ing for; it and . the ordinary elocution
ary exercises. â¢. No, when I was at . the
university I sang onceâ only onceâ at
a small function. In the report of it

said: . 'Swans sing ,; before they, die; it
would be a good thing if some people
died before they sang.'^, I 'never .sang
again." - ".
"And now after the barnstorming?"
"And after that?" '
"Maybe," I agreed. "But now, may
we return to your history? You
stopped with spouting Marc Antony's
speech for the inappreciative Yankee."
"Well, my first experience on the
stage was while I was at the univer

the representation â aside from Mrs.
Fiske's wonderful acting and the ex
ceptional support she receives from
one of the best companies ever organ
ized in this country â presents "five acts
of flawless stage pictures." The scenes
of this drama, as Mrs. Fiske has pro
duced it, are said, as they are succes
sively unfolded, to represent pictures
as perfect as though magnified from
the canvases of great masters of
painting. It is not only the beauty of
the scenes themselves, which enlisted
the best talent to be found in their
composition, but also the added beauty
and harmony of fit furnishings, and as
much as anything else, the wonderfully
accurate and picturesque costuming
that gives to the scenes as they are
peopled the aspect of actual Oriental
life.

"I love you for myself alone!" Some
thing like this. In stentorian tones from

interviewing- talk, and Mr. Mayall
smiled naturally and said: "It's Sim

curious to say. the Jolllest fellow in the
world off the stage."
"Does that seem curious to you?"
"Well,. It seems to me that if you are

He nodded his remarkably .shapely
head in affirmation and volunteered:
"I was once Interviewed by a girl in

a friend of mine, and we went to the
theater together one day. Naturally, I
talked about the show and the acting,
and next Sunday it all came out in the
paper. I didn't even know that she was
a Journalist- But that was Just the
right kind of interview."
"Tr^at seems to me a rather Impossi
ble sort of thing to do â "
"We were schoolmates," the actor
explained- "But do you find that-peo
ple will talk freely with that before
them?" â my inch of pencil.
"Frankly. Mr. Mayall, I think people
will talk on the fascinating subject of
themselves with anything before them.
I get to* much, not too little, usually,
of heart-to-heartiness. In fact, I'm a
more or less discreet filter. Gosse says,
'tell everything you can,' in a chapter
on the ideal biographer. Interviewing
is something the same, don't you
think?"
"Oh, if there's anything an actor is
particularly Interested inâ the National
Theater, for example â ask him about
that. Then his theories of his art, his
history and so on are always Interest
ing. With you, for example, I should
like to know how you come to be play
ing Central melodrama?"
"There are three things I dislike," the
actor said then, in a sort of I-had-al
moBt-forgotten-it way, "going to the
dentist's, having my photograph taken
andâ"
"Being interviewed." Tve heard it be
fore.
How do you usually do?"
"With little Q's and A's down the
columns? Twould be original," I re
turned, "but a little formal.".
Mr. Mayall showed his handsome
dentistry in a slow smile and slowly
ventured: "I think it would be best if
you asked me questions and let me an
swer them."
"My tender mercies, Mr. Mayall," I
insisted, then reassured him. "Well, I
have only once been nccused of mis
quoting any one, and Jhen the lady â
well, did not teil the truth."
"But things look so different In
print "
"Don't tell me you have sinnedâ
rpare the gallery boy:" I implored.
The atmosphere up yonder reeks with
fieroics 1 .
Because, gentle reader, it would have
indecorously Joyed me for the 1 gallery
to see this hero of a hundred fights â
he wipes the floor with a bunch of
counterfeiters "single-handed and
alone" this weekâ palpably and de
lightfully afraid of one small woman.
One realized luxuriously and reverently
the ppower of the ppress. Mr. Mayall
sat there, with a chest swelldom he's
afraid to own up to, all but trembling
before me. He told me bo himself al
most immediately. And, alack-a-day,
the gallery was not there to hear!
We did b*Â»gin formally on the
"through -by -daylight-or- we'll- bust
the-borier!" drammer. Naturally one
wondered what Mr. Mayall, an erst
while Eilert Lovborg, Petronius, Mer
cutio, was doing in it. But the talk
soon drifted to the art of being inter
viewed. The Apollo ot the Central sat
conscientiously In his padded chair,
background by the disguise in
which he runs down the counterfeiters
this week. As seriourly as he takes
everything else he took the Interview.
An contraire, the interviewer has be
gun to believe, with long handling of
the frying pan, that e-els get used to
skinning.
"You know De!sarte said that there
are 200 or 300 ways of putting the
same phrase and each one looks differ
ent." the actor was Ba>ing. "I'm quite
at your mercy "
It would have been "nuts" for me to
have had the small boy there, in small
boy parlance. It would have been
"pie" to have had the large boy there,
as he would eay in pieful way. The
girls, too. though Herschel Mayall
stoutly disclaims any pull with the car
amel contingent.
Not that there was much room for
any one but Mr. Mayall. the artist, and
myself, in the actor's little 6x10 dress
ing-room, where I went to chat with
him the other day. But oh! how I
should have liked to rake the gallery
in with me:â the gallery that whistles
virtue to heaven, and sizzles the tres
passer until the hiss of him is heard
even unto the City Hall! the gallery
that weeps with beauty in distress,
chuckles with the sleuth, giggles with
the ingenue, but abovÂ» all adores mag
nificently, unreservedly, the conquering
hero! the gallery, in short, of the Cen
tral Theater!
And wherefore?
"Yes, I earned that,' also. It was
very bad and weak when I began. One
thing, you know, seems strange to me.
We, train horses, dogs and cattle to
be strong and fine and stop at "our
selves. Mostly it's laziness, I think."
"Do you do much now In the way of
training?"
. "Every morning, mostly, and some
times evenings. I feel"â and Mj\ May
all shrugged his fine shoulders uncom-
But he would not say. I might have
been asking an Ingenue her age, or a
prima donna her weight I ventured
again: "Were you alwaysâ that way?"
"No, I used to be a puny lltle wisp
of a chap until 14 and thereabouts. My
father sent me to school In Maine then
âthat was the only place for education,
he thoughtâ and I determined to get a
good body there â " listen, little chap of

I've a bunch of medals at home."
"Your voice, too?" â¢
Mr. Mayall threw up his hands when
he saw It, with that characteristic lit
tle pout on his classic features. Then
he made the following unique request:
"Oh, can't you take something off those
shoulders? It makes me look so â "
"Chesty?" supplied the artist.
"Reallyâ"
"Really, they are quite broad, Mr.
Mayall," I protested. "What Is your
chest measure? â as a defense."
"As you can't convince yourself
you could be, you don't want to be â "
"Thank you," he laughed, "exactly.
I personally npveled In the part of Ma
rio in 'La Tosca.' That's not saying at
all that I played it well, though. Mer
cutio I'm very tond of, and Eilert Lov
borg. But it quite frequently happens
that we don't play well what we like
best. And vice, versa. Here's a very
email instance. This week I have to
adopt three disguises, and I'd never
done anything like one of these parts,
an Italian peddler. I was nervous about
it, didn't want to do it, butâ well, it
isn't a failure. Now, I suppose you will
make all sorts of fun of me for this on
Sunday â and you â " to the artist.
"Heaven forbid!" I said. "Conscience
is too valuable a commodity to be made
fun of, even in disguise."
The artist answered by passing over
his sketch. ,
"And why not?"
"Hardly, pays these days. And
then â " the would-be tragedian mod
estly paused, "well, if I could con
vince myself that I could be I should
want to be. But as â "
"Deep down in my soul," and. this
was in the actor's deepest, warmest"
note â and I know of no finer voice
going than the Mayall organ â "I
would like to have remained in trag
edy."
"Oh, well," and for a few moments
Mr. Mayall talked "not for publica
tion." He ended up with: "Ashton
Stevens paid me a compliment I val
ued most highly when he said I
would play a thousand colorless parts
without condescension or shirking.
Of course, one does get many and
many a bad part and has to swallow
one's prideto play them." }-"{â¢'?;
"Still, it's due to the audience to
do your best," I remarked. "Morgan
didn't swallow much of his when he
played in 'The White Heather* â^o
you remember? And that Romeo of
his! You had many good people
down at the Grand Opera-house in
your day, by the way."
"Joseph Haworth one of the finest,"
Mas-all heartily subscribed. "He was
one of the most unselfish men I ever
met, kindness itself, and such a Ham
let. I enjoyed thoroughly my experi
ence with him."
"What parts do you like best your
self?"
"But, Mr. Mayall, after Eilert Lov
borg. Mercutio, Mephisto and such
like â "
"Well. I had never had a melodra
matic experience for one thing," Mr.
Mayall began, unconsciously throwing
out his chest. "Then again, they pay
excellent salaries here."
"You like it?"
"Sometimes. This week I have
quite a little opportunity of character
ization in 'The Counterfeiters.* It's
not a bad thing. You've seen 'Sher-i
lock Holmes?' Not such a far cry
from that."
Skene In 'The Masqueraders.' I was
Â¦wandering round â¢with a polished frown
â¢and my hands in my pockets all day.
Then when I played Mephlsto here a
while ago I went around making cut
ting, sarcastic remarks."
"Impossible!" I cried. "But do yon
know there is quite an opposite the
ory from yours? Miss Constance
Crawley of the 'Everyman* t company
told me of Beerbohm Tree's experi
ence â or rather his wife's. Mrs. Tree
said that when her husband was play
ing saints on the stage he was sinful
off. Then again, that when he was
playing the villain he was perfectly
lovely at home â 'angelic* was the
word, I believe."
"That is not my experience,*' the
actor said thoughtfully.
"You would be almost a 'holy ter
ror* at home Just now if It were,
wouldn't you?" I laughed. "Serious
ly, though, how comes it that you are
playing 'do or die* heroes?"

might be the central figure at the sil

During the latter part of November
Grand President Stella Finkeldey paid
official visits to local parlors of the
Native Daughters and at each place
visited there was a feeling of serenity
until one or two members, under good
of the order, told their tales of woe,
which many members believe ought to
be told in the Grand Parlor to the com
mittee on grievances, and marred the
pleasures of the evening.
At Fremont Parlor the grand presi
dent was well received and among the
visitors wore Past Presidents Keith and
Baker. Grand Secretary Frakes and
Deputy Presidents Mulcay and Wehe.
The officers were complimented for
their excellent work and Lily Kerrigan.
the marshal, was specially congratu-
latod for the charming and ' dignified
manner in which Bhe discharged her
duties. The grand president was pre
sented with a handsome Jewel case
and the two district deputies were
plvon fragrant flowers. There were
addresses by the grand officers named
and then a banquet.
At Orinda Parlor the grand president
was most graciously received and the
reception must have left a most favor
able impression on her of the Orinda
pirls. The ritual was exemplified by
the initiation of two candidatesâ Miss
Carrie Muller and Mrs. Kitty Gilmourâ
after which there was the presentation
of a set of six volumes on California
to the grand president, a book for each
letter of the name of the parlor, in
token of appreciation of that officer.
The grand officer praised the parlor for
the excellent manner in which the offi
cers performed" their work and spoke
in praise of the beautiful decorations,
cor.siFting of the State's golden flower
and evergreens. The speaker said that
a lesson is learned at every visit to a
Fubordinate. In Orinda Parlor she must
have discovered that the members are
teaching what fraternity is. The meet
ing was addressed by Past Grand Pres
ident Conrad, who said of the grand
president that "she extols that which is
good in others, never breathing the
good Fhe herself does and therefor we
love her for her worth." Past Presi
dent Mills said: "It is the heart that
tells and we are pleased to think that
Sister Finkeldey will love Orinda as
much as we do her." Other visitors
were Past Grand Presidents Baker and
Keith, also Dr. Emma C. Lafontaine,
the parlor's physician, and District
Deputy Miss Nellie Mulcay. There
were many addresses under good for
the order and the presentation of a cut
glass berry dish to Grand Treasurer
Emma Gruber Foley, a member of the
parlor, on behalf of her admiring
friends; a memento to Mrs. Baker, and
flowers to special guests.
At La Estrella Parlor, the grand
president was received with that gra
ciousness which has been a feature in
the star parlor. The decorations were
emblematic of the patriotism which
characterizes the membership of the
order. There was the exemplification
of the ritualistic work in a manner
that demonstrated that the officers had
given much attention to the game and
for this they were complimented by the
inspecting officer. Among visitors to
the parlor were Past Grand President
Eliza D. Keith, Grand Secretary Laura
J. Frakes. Grand Treasurer Emma G.
Foley and visitors from every parlor
in the city. There were interesting ad
dresses by the grand officers named
and one by a member of the order who
aired her grievance. Her remarks
were received with such a degree of
coolness that she must have felt there
is much that would better be left un
eaid. As a token of the parlor's ad
miration of the grand president it pre
sented her with a handsome crystal ink
well. After the business of the even
ing the parlor served icecream and
cakes.
The grand president was also pleas
antly received by Gabrielle Parlor In
Eagles' Hall. There, by reason of the
large floor, the officers had the oppor
tunity to make a fine display of floor
work during the ritualistic ceremony.
The officers of the parlor received praise
and after the usual work there was the
presentation of a token of love and ad
miration to the visiting grand official
and a thanksgiving programme, con
sisting of a song by the parlor; "The
Origin of Thanksgiving," by Miss
Wood; "The First Thanksgiving," by
Julia Tanner; "America," by the par
lor; "How Came Thanksgiving Day,"
by Miss Beherns; an address by Past
President Eliza D. Keith, and a piano
polo by Grand President Miss Finkel
dey, who is possessed of rare musical
talent. The present that was given to
grand president . was a beautiful ink-
Etand. Flowers were presented to other
grand officers.
A new parlor called Hiawatha was
Instituted at Redding in the latter part
of last month by Past Grand President
Mrs. Etna Gett of Sacramento, who
was assisted in the initiatory work and
Installation ceremony by a full team
of officers from Camelia Parlor of An
derson. This parlor was organized by
Miss Ethel Lowden, who was assisted
in the work by J. J. Daley, a well
known member of the order of Native
Sons. The parlor starts with twenty
eix. charter members. The president
chosen for the first term is Jessie Dunn
and the recording secretary Mrs. Stella
Collins.
During the stay of the grand presi
dent In this city she was the guest of
Lena HIIke Mills and Ida M. Kervan
at several of the prominent women's
clubs, including the California,
Women's Press and Outdoor .Art
League. She was also entertained at
luncheon and was driven out to see
the eights by Lena H. Mills, Emma G.
Foley. Mary E. Tillman and L M.
Kervan.
Keith Parlor at its last held meeting
disposed of business in a most expedi
tious manner, for the purpose of hav
ing a "lady Jinks." at which there was
a great deal of sport.
The visit of the grand president to
Darina Parlor on the last Monday In
Novembqr was in the nature of an ova
tion, which was Illustrative of the love
and esteem in which the grand officer
is held by the membership of that par
lor. The hall was elaborately decorat
ed with fish nets, in the meshes of
which there was a liberal display of
ferns, huckleberry leaves and golden
poppies, and national and California
Hags were everywhere in evidence. The
seat of honor, reserved for the visiting
officer, was beautifully decorated with
flowers, ferns and Christmas berries.
The ritualistic work was exemplified
by the initiation of Miss Pillar and
Miss Radke. Under good for the order
Miss Finkeldey delivered an interest*

This series of luncheons affords

to learn their names and select her

THREE YOUNG FAVORITES I N^SOCI ETYMON^
PARIS, Dec. 5.â The pawnshops of
Paris are making money from the
automobiles pawned by Francisco Ter
ry, the spendthrift son of Emlllo Terry,
brother-in-law of Count Stanislaus de
Castellane. It is gossip of the clubs
that Terry has pawned five automo
biles for comparatively trifling sums.
This Is the first time Paris pawnbrok
ers have been" asked to advance money
on automobiles. 1 Among the machines
Terry has pawned are two racing ma
chines one of which won the P4ris-
Bordeaux race in. May. Terry bought
this and a sixty-horse- power Mercedes
a few months ago. Though only 23.
Terry finds an allowance i of $60,000 a
year insufficient for his heeds. He is
generous. He recently gave a singer
at the Opera a house costing $SO,000.
The youth relieves his immediate wants
by discounting notes with money lend
ers' at Tapacious prices. Notes already
negotiated total a million francs.
Terry now Is in the hands of a notori
ous money-lender called Tour de Mou
lin, who furnishes money to youths
with expectations at heavy rates of
interest. The- Terry and CastelJane
families are moving to have a Suardlan
appointed to "restrain the spendthrift.

A high tea recently -given for Mrs.
Budd was a charming affair and the

The attempt now being made in
New York to revive the "high tea" is
meeting with favor and it will be ven
tured in San Francisco to a certain
extent. Â¦ ': Safe r>; . : :
A sunrise party on Mount Tamalpais
is a novel diversion being enjoyed to
day by a score of happy people. The
quests went up the mountain yester
day and dined at the Tavern and rose
early this morning to behold the sun
rise â a decided departure from their
usual hour of rising.
Those present were: Mrs. J. M.
Henry. Miss Gertrude Dutton, Miss
Malita Pease, Miss Helen de Young,
Miss Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Runyan;
Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Smith, Mr. and
Mrs. George Sperry. Captain Emerson

Mrs. Thomas Porter Bishop gave the
most novel affair of the season last
night. It was a "folly dinner," at which
only the fair sex were invited. Not that
it is passing strange to identify women
with affairs of folly, for good, sound
sense in either sex is something of a
rarity, but it is difficult to understand
why the hostess eliminated men. They
are not used to being left out, and on
this occasion were dying to know^vhat
the women were going to wear. Abso
lute license was given every guest in
the matter of dress. She was to wear
a costume representing anything on
this mundane sphere, man, the animal,
not excepted. There was no end of se
crecy surrounding the arrangements,
as all guests wished to surprise each
other.
Latter day hostesses are ever on the
<;ui vive for some novel sort of enter
tainment. Luncheons will do for the
debutante, who expresses herself as
having "the time of her life" at every
one: but for the guest of honor from
out of town and the full-fledged society
matron inclined to be blase and who
thinks there is nothing new under the
Fun, something must be marked very
special to interest her.
The easiest thing for the hostess to
do upon the arrival of a friend from
out of town i6 to give a small tea,
sending out her own visiting card, on
â¢which is written. "To meet Mrs. "
and the date and hour when they will
t>e at home. This renders it possible for
ihe truest of honor to choose for her
friends from among the number, al
though one says so little at a tea that
it is difficult for any one to be an
other's Columbus. She usually accepts
them because her hostess does, and
takes chances upon discovering that
they have an idea or two afterward. -
Particularly this season are San
Francisco hostesses striving to depart
from the '"beaten path," and cheerfully
task their wits to devise new attrac
tions in entertaining.

An unknown, square-rigged vessel, be

on Ferryland^ Head, near Cape Race,
during "a~ furious storm at midnight
last night and- every person aboard
perished. One body was washed ashore
this morning, but bore nothing which
could possibly lead to its identification
except a gold ring, marked with the
initials, "J. E." Portions of the wreck
also drove ashore, bearing the letters,
"Torens," "Levekapsy," "Bestr" and

It seems possible that the complex
questions Involved may require the de
cision : of" the Attorney General.
All of the new nominations, includ
ing army and navy and civil appoint
ments, made by President Roosevelt
during the extra session, and which
have not been. confirmed by the Sen
ate, will have to be renewed at tne reg
ular session. It is expected that these
nominations will be retransmitted by
the. President on Monday next.
At the War Department the- officials
are not quite clear in their minds as
to the exact status of the military offi
cers, whose nominations have failed of
confirmation. There is a disposition to
take the point of view that, between
the expiration of the present session
and the beginning of the regular ses
sion, there will necessarily be an ap
preciable but small period of time when
there is .no session and during which
Congress is technically In recess, and
that it will be within the power of the
President at any time after Monday
next toniake recess appointments to
continue during the session, unless oth
erwise disposed of. The officials are
not united yet In their view upon this
point, but the new nominations which
are now being, made out at,, the War
Department to replace those which
lapsed are all to be dated as to the
time the vacancy ocurred.
While no official representation has
been made by the Senate to the House,
several informal* conferences have
been held between the Republican Sen
ators an<t Speaker Cannon. In these
the Speaker has said that the House
has no. authority over executive ap
pointments or confirmations, and that
if the creation of a recess was neces
sary to take care of these matters the
Senate should have taken official ac
tion looking to adjournment of the
special session. In the absence of such
a.movement, the Speaker said, he could
not Interfere In any. way with th^e ex
piration of the extra session by con
stitutional limitation. \
MUST RENEW NOMINATIONS.
Among the civil appointments affect
ed is that of Dr. Crum, the negro, as
Collector of Customs at Charleston, S.
C. Crum is serving under a recess ap
pointment. The effect of the adjourn
ment Is to - vacate his position. Cram's
recess appointment has thus been ter
minated. As the situation in the Sen
ate has been such that his confirma
tion has been despaired of, the collect
orship of the port of Charleston will
remain vacant until the expiration of
the next session, unless the President
selects some one else for this place and
the nomination is confirmed by the
Senate.
DR. CRUM LOSES POSITION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â By the
manner of adjourning the House to

eighth Congress will expire by con
stitutional limitation on Monday.
when the regular session will begin.
This eliminates the possibility 'of the
President renewing his civil and mili
tary appointments. Such appoint
ments as have not been confirmed by
the Senate during the extra session
must be renewed simply in the form of
nominations, which. In effect, are but
recommendations, and do not become
effective in any case until confirmed by
the Senate.
In effect, this action will r.ednce Gen
eral Leonard Wood from his present
tank of major general, to which the
Senate has not confirmed him, to the
rank of brigadier general, which he
held prior to August S last. It also

The suggestions which have been
made as- to legislation are very care
fully guarded. It Is not expected that
the ' President recommends any radical
legislation regarding trusts, but there
will ' be laid " before Congress a very
full statement, as to the .condition of
the State ana-Federal laws. As no ef
fort, has yet been made to obtain from
corporations . the secrets of their busi
ness and capitalization the President
probably will ask" for change in the
laws creating- the new Department of
Commerce and Labor." V
It Is understood among those % who
have been, acting in an < advisory ca
pacity- to ,the ; President that no new
onslaught on corporations contem
plated. What will -be suggested In the
future will depend entirely upon 'the
facts â¢ brought out by the Bureau of
Corporation^; of the Department of
Commerce and Labor when it sets into
full 5 operation. This bureau . was cre
ated for the purpose of obtaining facts
which should be communicated to the
President and the information so com-
All of these things made It fitting
that the President should state his po
sition, which is not one of hostility to
either business or. Industry, but rather
of friendliness to both classes, so long
as they work within the laws and treat
each other fairly^ and lawfully.
LAWS i REGULATING TRUSTS.
The treatment of this great subject
is expected to form a very large part
of the message. It will be recalled that
the President laid down in the dispute
which arose in the bindery of the Gov
ernment Printing Office the principle
that, while labor organizations had the
right to exist among Government em
ployes, those organizations \ had no
right to put their rules above the laws
of the land and that no man could be
excluded from the' Government service
because he did or did not belong to a
labor union. -r , . . - "
The events of the last year bearing
on the right of labor to boycott and
intimidate and the rights of corpora
tions to annul laws on ' the statute
books gave the President an excellent
opportunity. to discuss questions which
are uppermost in' the minds' of every
business man and every labor leader
In the United States.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â The Herald
has the following from Washington:
President's Roosevelt's message, which
will be sent to Congress at the begin
ning of the regular session on Monday,
is understood to be a very long docu
ment and discusses with great detail
questions of government which the ex
ecutive has considered during the last
twelve months* The most interesting
thing in it is the treatment of the Isth
mian canal question. The President
meets this subject' with characteristic
boldness. "He justifies his course and
the policy of the administration. The
United States not only had obligations
to perform under the treaty with New
Granada in keeping peace on the isth
mus and providing for open and unin
terrupted traffic across the neck of land,
but it had a greater duty on i.ie higher
ground, that this Government is the
trustee of -the world for the isthmus.
i The President's message is couched
in language which leaves no doubt that
'he? regards, what has happened as final
and there* Is no. suggestion of retrac
ing the steps which have been taken.
NO; INTRIGUE WITH PANAMA.
Â¦There-^'isin the message, so Senators
whd" have read 'it say, much that re
minds them of the query that Mr. Me-
Kinley made when he. said that the
flag was floating over the Philippines
and. boldly asked: "Who will haul it
down?"
But in the largest sense is the Pana
ma section of the message a justifica
tion of what has been done by the
United States. .The President will show
that this Government was not parti
ceps criminis to the revolution on the
isthmus; that it knew only as all other
nations, including Colombia, knew that
a revolt might occur; that the Gov
ernment, in accordance with its obli
gations to preserve peace on the Isth
mus, sent a few ships in that general
direction, but that the very fact that
the naval force near at hand was so
small showed that the administration
did not have definite news that a re
volt was actually impending. . '
The President informs Congress that
a treaty has been negotiated with the
new republic of Panama and that it
will be submitted to the Senate for
ratification. > :

The blind girls and boys of the State
Institute for the Deaf and the Blind
demonstrated to-night that they can
get up as good an , argument as any
body when it comes right down to it.
The girls particularly were so well
armed with woman's one weapon of
defense that they got the last word in
every time and carried off the prize.
This clash of words between sightless
students was carried, on in .Willard Hall
at the Institute." It was a battle be
tween Willard Hall, the girls' part of
the institute, and Strauss Hall, the
boys' part. The debate had been talked
over for a long time and had. been de
cided many times in private debate be
tween the girl and the boy factions. So
deep was the interest in the result that
the whole of Willard Hall was occu
pied by the students when the first
speaker besan.
The question at issue was, "Resolved,
That the United States should adopt
free trade as its national policy, with
the proviso that free trade be not in
terpreted as excluding tariff for reve
nue only." .Now this was a pretty deep
question to solve, especially for girls,
who are not supposed to be interested
in "free trade" and such things, but ths
debaters spoke fluently upon the sub
ject and handled the various points
with such care as to indicate careful
preparation.
, The affirmative side was presented by
C. M. Caceres, J. F. .Dondero and W.
E. Scurlock;- the negative by Catherine
Morrison, Tillie Morrison and Maude
Hilton. Each speaker was allowed ten
minutes.
The Judges were Max Thelen. E. E.
Wood and Robert L; McWilliams. War
ren. Wilkinson, superintendent of the
school, acted as presiding officer.
The judges awarded the girls the
prize for "the, best presentation, but it
was decided that the boys had the best
arguments.

former marshal of the Bt. Ixtuls Court of Ap
peals, wno recently was convicted, with County
Chairman Dolan and Policeman Garrett, of aid-'
ing and abetting naturalization frauds, was
to-day sentenced to five years In the peniten
tiary and fined $1000.- Pending an appeal Bar
rett was released on bonds of $20,000. i ,"
CHICAGO, Dec. 5.âThe creation of a
national arbitration tribunal named by
the President, to which shall be sub
mitted all disputes between capital and
labor, is the aim of Volney W. Poster.
He has drawn up a bill, copies of which
have been sent leading business men,
manufacturers and labor leaders, with
a request that they suggest such
amendments as they deem necessary to
make the bill if enacted into law as ef
fective as possible.
The bill provides for a commission of
six members, at a salary of $3000 a
year, with the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor as an ex-offlclo member and
chairman. The members are not to ac
cept perquisites aside from their sala
ries under a penalty of a fine of $3000,
two years* imprisonment or both.. The
headquarters of the tribunal are to be
in 'Washington. .
The proposed bill provides that the
tribunal determine all cases, either In
the affirmative or negative, on tijte
claims of both parties. It also provides^
that there shall be no strike or lockout ,
pending the Investigation, and both
parties to the controversy are to?re
sume and continue their former Rela
tions. This condition is to remain/until
a decision has been rendered. /
There, will be no sensational dis
closures in the annual message. The
great work which Secretary Root has
performed in placing the army on its
present footing, so that, to use the
words of one of the best military ex
perts of the country, "we have an
army in time of peace of 60,000 men and
an army In time of war of 176,000, which
can be increased to 300,000 with the
right sort of machinery behind it," will
come in for a word of praise from the
President.
There will be a recommendation for
a further and steady Increase of the
fighting strength of the navy. The ar
guments in favor of this, however, will
be left largely to the Secretary of the
Navy, whose report was published to
day, and the department arguments in
Congress.
Financial legislation will not be spe
cifically recommended. This subject
will be commended to Congress with a
view to arriving at some agreement as
to the needs of the banks and the busi
ness world!;
The postal' frauds will be touched
upon only in a general â¢ way. The
President comments on the Bristow re
port having covered the ground so far
as the situation at this time seemed to
warrant. The recommendation by
Messrs. Bonaparte and Conrad as to ex
tending the statute of limitations to
five years, however, will be made to
Congress.
munlcated was first to be used as a
basis of recommendation for additional
legislation and might be made public
at the discretion of the President.
ROME,- Dec. 5. â Senor Gutierez
Ponce, the Colombian Minister to the
Vatican, after long interviews with
Cardinal Merry del Val, the Papal Sec
retary of State, and other prominent
Cardinals, is about to leave Rome
without having obtained from t*ie
Vatican the support for 'Colombia
which he expected.
Colombia Fails at Vatican.
"Proofs of Immortality" will be the
subject of Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-
Tyndall's psychic discourse to-night at
Steinway Hall. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
will deal with convincing manifesta
tions of the existence after death of the
individual soul, and may be relied upon
to give some particularly interesting
information anent the much discussed
question of individual immortality.
This question is one that materialistic
science has yet to deal with, and it Is
being agitated on all Fides during the
present revival of interest In psychic
science. In addition to the lecture,
which will undoubtedly attract an im
mense audience, there will be an enter
taining and xnyEtif ying programme of
psychic manifestations.

The prisoners all were born in the
interior of Colombia and have been
upon the isthmus for. years. -.They .were
members of the Colombian battalion
which gave its support to the new Gov
ernment when the republic was formed
and which was commanded by General
Huertas. They all took the oath of al
legiance to the new republic and con
tinued to serve in the army. One of
them is a colonel named Ferrol, two
are majors, and the fourth is the ad
jutant general of General Huertas.
They declare that the charge that they
were engaged in a' conspiracy is the
work of personal enemies.
COLON, DeC. 5.â Through a letter the
Panama Government . has discovered
what is alleged to have been a plot
against the life of .General Huertas,
commander-in-chlef of the forces of
the republic of Panama, and an effort
on the part of a few army officers to
persuade the garrison at Panama to
revolt. If such a plot really existed it
was promptly nipped in the bud by the
apprehension this morning at Panama
of four alleged conspirators, who were
immediately brought . under guara to
Colon and shipped herice :- to Port Ll
mon.
Alleged Attempt to Incite Revolt of

PLOT AGAINST HUERTAS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. â Senator
Hanna to-day authorized the press to
state that at last night's conference
the President and himself "discussed
a number of things political." .While
they differed on the subject of the
confirmation of General Wood, there
was no misunderstanding between
them ana; nothing;, indicating a break
in their relations, such as haa been
rcportea.
It can be said that at last night's
conference only ; incidental reference
was made to matters of concern to
the Republican National Committee.
The â¢ statement that Senator Hanna
has, not determined definitely. whether
he . would be willing to retain, the
chairmanship of the committee or not
is strictly accurate. It probably will
be several months before the necessity
for a final decision will arise. - Mean
time the question will remain in abey
an.ee. ' j Vi:*'\^\ ~
As. to Perry S. Heath's connection
with the committee as secretary, it is
understood the President does not
care to assume a position. Heath is
an officer of the committee and the
Presiaent thinks the committee amply
qualified to . take care of its own af
fairs without suggestion from him.
The national committee which will
direct the next Presidential campaign
will not be selected until the Repub
licans of the country meet in national
convention next summer. That com
mittee will -select its own officers. It
is decided that Heath, in any event,
will not be a candidate again for sec
retary of the committee. â¢ .
GRIDIRON CLUB
JESTS AT FAME
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. â The Grid
iron Club entertained more than 160
guests at its December dinner in the
Arlington Hotel to-night. The even
ing was replete with unique features,
in which public events and the alleged
ambitions and aspirations of states
men were made subjects of. burlesque
and good natured ridicule. The ini
tiation of three new members afforded
an opportunity to picture the inside of
a newspaper office,. In which the staff
discussed methods Â»of interviewing
many of the guests present. , The . re
public.of Panama suddenly appeared
at the,. -dinner. and was recognized by
the Republican elephant, amid brays
of the Democratic donkey. The Grid
iron Club flying machine was brought
in and a number of prominent guests
were given an Â»opportunity to test it,
the course being to the White House,
but all met with a mishap before
reaching the goal, .^^v-
Moving, pictures illustrated some re
cent, events, political and social. A
New York policeman appeared and
hung a red light directly over the
place where Leader Murphy of Tam
many and Mayor-elect McClellan were
sitting. . There were a number of
brilliant and witty speeches and the
evening was interspersed with topical
songs.
Amid the festivities the lights were
turned down and large pictures -of
William E. Annin and Hubbard T.
Smith, members who died during the
past year, were thrown upon a screen,
and a short and impressive eulogy was
delivered by Major John M. Carson,
in which reference was made to .the
fact that Annin was once- president of
the club and Smith one of its valued
musical members. The pictures fad
ed away and as the club sang. one of
Smith's songs the lights again flashed
and the mirth proceeded.
Among the guests present were Sen
ator Warren, Representative Mondeil,
J. A. Breckons of Wyoming, Charles
S.. Gleed of Topeka, Kas., and F. M.
Murphy and N. O. Murphy of Arizona.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â General
Ratael Reyes, the special Minister from
Colombia, practically initiated his mis
sion when, with Dr. Herran, he called
upon President Roosevelt at the White
House to-day and told him why he had
come to Washington. The presenta
tion took place in the blue parlor,
where all regular Embassadors and
Ministers are received,, but the Presi
dent infused so much cordiality into
his greeting, that this occasion was a
little out of the ordinary. There was
no. exchange of formal speeches,
though the Colombians were prepared
to do so in case of < need. Instead the
President greeted General Reyes ; in
formally as 'a former acquaintance,
having met him when the general was
visiting the United States some time
ago. Instead of standing to receive his
callers, -as Is the case in ordinary diplo
matic presentations, the President
himself sat down and invited General
Reyes to a seat beside him: "
The two then entered upon an ani
mated conversation, which touched on
some notable exploits In -General
Reyes' life, with which the ; President
seemed to be more or less familiar, and
gradually drifted around to the sub
ject of General Reyes' mission; There
was no definite proposition advanced
by the Colombians, for the President
intimated that the. Panama problem
was a matter with which the State De
partment alone <Jould properly â¢ deal.
The conversation on this point closed
with an understanding that General
Reyes, who now regards his mission as
duly launched, should hereafter make
any representations respecting Panama
that he cared to broach to Secretary
Hay. Nevertheless there was Just
enough intimation in- the President's
talk to make his callers aware that he
saw little prospect of being able to
meet their wishes.

LONDON, Dec. 5.â Roger Casement,
British Consul in the Congo State, has
Just completed a tour of investigation
undertaken under the orders of the
British Government, and he fully con
firms the worst reports of outrages per
petrated on natives of that^part of
Africa. Casement's . tour was to have
lasted six months, but after the scenes
he witnessed and the information he
obtained in the first two months, the
Consul decided that further evidence
was unnecessary. The report which
Casement Is now preparing for the For
eign Office will show that the most hor
rible outrages are still being perpetra
ted under the" "rubber regime," and
that* slavery and barbarism in their
most revolting forms still exist.
The -' Casement â¢ party | traveled over
1000 miles from the coast along â¢ the
Congo and its tributaries, visiting the
Abir and Lulonga rubber zones. Pend
ing the delivery of the report to the
Foreign Office the investigators refuse
to furnish any details, but a member
of the mission summed up the situa
tion by saying:
"The most terrible slavery exists, the
administration Is atrocious and if there
Is not speedy, intervention it will be
too late." ' , . . . â¢

had been planned and up to a few days

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 5. â A Chil
dren's . World's International Exposi
tion was opened to-day in the Tauride
Palace with gr^at ceremony by Eliza
beth Mavrickievna. The opening was
a brilliant function and was attended
by. the state Ministers, members of the
diplomatic corps, including United
States Embassador McCormack and
high, Government functionaries, in full
uniform. The ceremonies were fol
lowed by a â¢ grand ball. This, is the
first international exposition' devoted
exclusively to the life of children ever
held and it is unique in every respect.
It owes Its origin to a suggestion made
by Dowager Empress Marie and is held
under her auspices. All the countries
of the world were invited to partici
: pate and almost all of them accepted
the invitation. Russia has the largest
exhibit and France, Germany and Aus
tria follow . in the order named. The
exhibit of the United States, which is
under 'the direction of Commissioner
Schadt of Philadelphia, , is the small
est, consisting only of photographs of
schools and school children, but it en-
Joys the 'distinction of being displayed
under the largest flag in the palace.
When the American colors were un
furled the Incident attracted universal
attention, the appearance of the Stars
and v Stripes being greeted with ap
plause and cheers.
.The most interesting features of the
exposition are the exhibits relating . to
hygenie and the' physical deevlopment
of children, including the care of new
born Infants, etc., and the section de
voted to scientific teachings. 'One sec-'
tion devoted 'to â¢ child life ,j includes
paintings of children by Russian and
foreign artists. Another section illus
trates historical events in . the lives [ of
Childhood, discoveries and j inven-;
tions of children arid the ethnographi
cal peculiarities of children of different
nations. :Â¦ One of the most pleasant in
cidents of the exhibition . was the pre
sentation *by - Professor Drumbaugh - of
Philadelphia to the Dowager Empress
of an American citizen's book written
by Miss Hall. The book was presented
on' a tray : bordered by small. Russian
arid 'American' flags and bearing masses
of the Empress* favorite flowers.'
The exposition will continue for two
months. ;

j BOSTON, Dec. 5.â In her official trial
over the Cape Ann course to-day the
new cruiser Des Molnes exceeded her
contract requiremnts of 16.5 knots an
hour, making an average of 16.633 knots
per hour. It is thought that the tidal
corrections will not materially change
these figures.
Next to speed the noticeable feature
of the trial was the remarkable steadi
ness of the ship. The conditions of the
trial were favorable on the whole. The
sea was moderately smooth and the
wind, which struck the warship abeam
on the north and almost ahead on the
run home, served to make good draught
for . the Jjollersi
On th% other hand, the atmosphere
was hazy during the greater part of
the run so the stake boats could not
be made out with any great certainty.
The northerly run was covered in
three seconds over two hours, a speed
of 16.49 knots, or one-one-hundredth
of a knot under the contract..
It was on the run -back that the Des
Moines showed her true worth. One
by one the number of the revolutions
of her engines were increased until
on the second leg they reached 191 per
minute. The machinery worked in j fine
form and a speed of 16.77 was attained
on the return. . -i S\:'~ r

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â The big
sixty-foot aerodrome of Professor Sam
uel H. Langley, the secretary of the
Smithsonian; Institute, which was un
successfully, launched several months
ago, was prepared for another experi
ment to-day, but unfavorable wind con
ditions prevented the test. The ma
chine has been put into perfect order
and is ready to be hoisted onto the su
perstructure for another trial at the
first opportunity, possibly Monday. No
attempt will be made to hoist the ma
chine into, position unless the wind is
less .than twelve miles an hour, in or
der to avoid possible danger to the men
engaged .in the work, who might be
swept into the stream thereby. F. M.
Monley, Professor Langley's chief as
sistant In thS*^ flying machine re
searches, and ' who has been actively
directing the plans and preparations,
was aboard' the houseboat all day with
his force of. mechanics, and Thomas W.
Smith, the official photographer of the
Smithsonian Institute, has his rapid
lire camera prepared .to make the offi
cial photographic records of the flight.
Professor Manley made observations of
the wind "velocity ,a number of times
during the day, but at no time did
conditions warrant an attempt at fly
ing. Manley left the boat after 4
o'clock this afternoon, merely saying
that it had been Impracticable to at
tempt the launching and that he could
not with any certainty predict when the
aerodrome would be given another test.
Both he and Professor Langley say
there ha.s been no change whatever
either In the motor, the launching
mechanism or any other part of the
flying machine apparatus. Professor
Langley said that the time of the next
attempt now hinges on wind condi
tions. . He said that it might not be
possible this season and yet it might be
found practicable in the next few days.
He credited the trouble with the last
experiment to a metallic projection in
the launching track, and explained that
that obstacle had been moved. He said
it was not likely that experiments
would be undertaken again at Wide
water, where the wind conditions
proved so unfavorable.
The experiment will be made in all
probability off the Government arsenal
grounds in this city, at the confluence
of the Potomac River and its eastern
branch, which offers a broad sweep for
the test.

not. My work has Just begun and I am

for Every Weak Kia." â Dr. Ferris.
It is mine to give to whom I will and
my works go before me. Doubt not!
1 ask no man to believe me, but I give
to every weak man free this priceless
boon and it restores him instantly to
the strength and powerful vigor of
youth. With this marvelous, mysterious
compound, which I have discovered
only after a lifetime devoted to search
through all the realms of science, and
the archives of the ancients, it is possi-
ble for every weak man to have for his
own the glorious manly power, the un-
tiring vigor and the long life of the
patriarch? of Bible times. With this
mysterious compound no w<>ak man
v. ill ever again be troubled with impo-
tency, vital losses, nightly emissions,

ity, defective power or lack of vital

Send me no money. It is my duty,
guided by an Unseen Handâ it is my

matters not what doctors or scoffers
say. This is no ordinary drug or stim-

the vital spark of life itself, and it
matters not how many remedies and
doctors have failed, I have repeatedly
and instantly renewed the youth of old
men. My secret compound never fails.
I have often Instilled into Jaded men j
new vitality, health and strength. For \
worn-out men I have oft kindled, in an ;
Instant, and to stay, the sparkling vi-
tality of youth. Write to me to-day
and tell me in strictest confidence all
about your case. My private address
is Dr. C. Sargent Ferris, 368 Strawn
building. Cleveland, Ohio, and I urge
every weak man to come to me, for I
will give him undying strength, the su-
preme Joy nnd happiness of perfect
manliness. My wondrous discovery* has i
startled the world by its miraculous ef-
fects, yet I Beek not fame nor glory. It
suffices me if I may be the humble in-
strument of Nature's greatest power in
bringing all men into the enjoyment of
their true manliness and I do it free.
In the time allotted to me here on
earth I shall do all that In my power
lies to give my fellow men the beneSt of
this great secret and my reward shall
be in the knowledge that I have done
unto others as .1 would that others
should do unto me.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.NEW YORK, Dec. 5. â The feature
of the official statement of the New
York Associated Banks last week was
the net gain of $517,200 in cash,
whereas estimates, which were based
upon the traceable movements of
money during the week. Indicated a
loss of (285,200. This discrepancy
between the official and the estimated
changes in this item may very easily
be acounted for by the system of av
erages. Payments by the assay of
fice of Imported gold were large, but
they were distributed through the
week, and moreover the disbursement
on Friday of $450,000 for gold re
ceived from Boston, which had been
imported by a Boston bank, though
counting for but one-sixth of the
amount, had some influence. The de
posits increased $1,349,400, as the re
sult of the gain In cash and of the
augmentation of the loans. The re
quired reserve was increased $337,100
because of this gain in deposits, and
deducting this sum from the net in
crease of cash leaves $180,102 as the
gain In surplus reserve, which Item Is
now $6,305,300. Computed upon the
basis of deposits, less those of $36,
801,100 of public fund3, the surplus is
$15,505,575. The increase in loans
was somewhat unexpected, but it was
probably caused by the renewal of ac
tivity, at advancing prices, on the
stock market This is indicated by
the average daily bank clearings for
the week, which were $218,000,000,
against $203,000,000 the previous
week. The statement shows a good
balance, the sum of increase in loans
and of cash being $1,697,800, or only
$331,400 more than the increase in
deposits. The surplus, reserve wlil
doubtless be augmented in the 'cur
rent week through the arrivals of gold
from Europe, which metal Is now in
transit. Moreover, the transfers hence
to San Francisco are. understood to
be practically at an end. The sub
treasury operations last week were
largely against the banks, because of
a falling off in pension disbursements
and of the heavy transfers of Internal
revenue collections and of payments
by banks on account of the 5 per cent
redemption fund. One feature of the
statement was the decrease in specie,
while legal tender increased. The loss
in the former was probably due to the
fact that foreign bankers are employ
ing much of the gold which they are
receiving from abroad, in the pur
chase of exchange. The gain In legal
tenders was most likely caused by re
ceipts from near by interior points,
and also to some accumulations of this
kind of money in anticipation of holi
day reauirementa. _^ -K - i ** v .

VANDERBILT HURRIES -
TO WIFE'S BEDSIDE
When arraigned for sentence before
Judge Moore in the Queens County
Court a year ago on the conviction of
burglary referred to he admitted that
his arrest for counterfeiting labels was
the first step in his downward career,
although through the Influence of his
money and his family he escaped con
viction. Ernest Monet, a Frenchman
and expert chemist, photographer and
an artist, was at the head of a Buck
ley-street gang. They occupied a small
story and a half frame house In Buck
ley street, Long Island City. How
Haas has become identified with the
gang has never been explained.
When the police raided the Buckley
street house they found several hun
dred bottles containing spurious phen
acetine, which Haas was manufactur
ing and selling in big quantities to
drug houses. The bottle bore the
counterfeit label of a big wholesale
drug house in Manhattan.
In the house was also found a print
ing outfit, which was used by Monet
and Haas in turning out bogus labels.
Two murders are attributed to the
gang, that of Albert C. Latlmer, who
was shot and- killed at his home by a
masked burglar, and John J. Sheridan,
detective. Haas was taken from Clin
ton prison last week and is now lodged
In the Queens County Jail to answer
to four indictments against him. He
is held in $250 bonds on each Indict
ment. His attorneys, Kreland, Lafetra
& Plaza of Manhattan, succeeded in
having his conviction set aside. They
are now fighting- to recover royalties
due Haas on his "gold cure."
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. â With more
than $80,000 In accumulated royalties
awaiting him', Joseph Haas, alias
Harry J. Claire, reputed discoverer of
the "gold cure," who was sentenced to
twenty years and four months on a
conviction of burglary, is back in the
Queens County Jail to make a fight for
liberty and fortune.
Haas is known as a chemist of rare
attainments. He comes. of a wealthy
Pittsburg family and is accredited
with being the first to produce: the
"gold cure," which he disposed of on a
basis of payments in royalties. He had
wealth and social standing and It is
said his first wrong was to become a
manufacturer of spurious drugs. He
was arrested for counterfeiting labels
of a big wholesale drug house In thÂ«
West.

The Financial Chronioie points out
that municipal bond sales for Novem
ber were larger than for any previous
November except in 1886. The large is
sues of new railroad bonds which have
been successfully placed in the recent
past is also the occasion of comment fa
forable to the financial prospect. A con
trast Is afforded by the figures of new
Incorporations with a capital of $1,000,
000 or over during November, which fell
to the lowest aggregate of any month
since the early part of 1899.
The temper of speculation in stocks
has undergone a change this week, and
prices have advanced in a broadening
market. Commission houses report that
there has been little growth In outside
order business, and the movement is
supposed to be principally due to oper
ations by professional traders and
habitual operators of the wealthy class.
But the technical significance of the
movement is probably not less on that
account. Operators in stocks for a long
time have found their only success on
the side of receding prices. This week
the market grave evidence of being over
sold, and the bears failed of . their
recent successes in forcing out sales of
stocks when they offered prices down.
Among the industrials especially
which have suffered such drastic scal
ing- down of prices, the urgent demand
to borrow stocks for delivery, which
commanded a premium in some cases,
j?ave warning of danger to the shorts
and prompted buying to cover. The
early covering movements among short
speculators of the smaller class did not
at first disturb the more powerful
operators on that 6lde of the mar
ket and they were inclined to avail
themselves of the rallies in prices to
put out fresh lines at the higher level.
Some of the selling that was attributed
to realizing by the longs was un
doubtedly this renewed short selling.
With the persistence of the upward
movement through the week an ex
tended short Interest was thus left un
covered until past the middle of the
â¢week, when it became clear that a bear
element of a stronger and more per
sistent character than any heretofore
reached was being driven to cover,
â¢with very important effect upon prices
and an awakening of animation in the
market. The fears of shorts were ag
gravated by their suspicion that an
absorption of stocks had been going on
by the great capital and banking com
binations, tehose operations contem
plate vide policies and are based upon
convictions as to general conditions
p.nd their ultimate working out. The
recovery In prices gained force and
proceeded in the face of various news
factors that were unfavorable, but
which had to do with conditions that
have been more or less foreseen and
LARGE SALE OF BONDS.
NEJV YORK, Dec. 5.â There was a
tone of doubt and hesitation In to-day's
rtock market which quite nearly fol
io vred the appearnace in yesterday's
jrarkct of signs cf a culmination of the
rise. Yesterday's large volume of deal
ings and the small net changes in in
voice pointed to both heavy realizing
and to large short covering. While the
realizing is a strengthening factor of
the market, the reduction of the short
interest deprives it of a technical factor
of strength. A renewed advance in
Brooklyn Transit, followed by the local
tractions this morning, obtained little
following in the general list. A selling
movement followed, which carried a
number of the leaders, such as Penn
pylvania. United States Steel preferred
end Amalgamated, a point under last
r.igrht- A feverish and irregular recov
ery succeeded, upon the publication of
the bank statement. The gain of $500,
000 in cash reserves was an agreeable
surprise compared with the expecta
tion of a decrease of several hundred
thousand dollars, and it is supposed to
be due to the making up of former
discrepancies the other way. The in
crease in the loan item of a little over
51.000,000 was not disturbing. The mar
ket closed steady and not far from last
night's le\el. The sterling exchange
market was weak and declined further
to a level which will assure the move
ment toward New York of any avail
able gold supply In foreign money mar
kets.
The money market has shown the ex
pected relaxation following the comple
tion of the December settlements. Con
ditions abroad as well as here promise
a continuance of a firm money market
for the rest of the year. But it is made
clear from the movement of the inter
national exchanges and the statistics of
international trade that New York
commands the exchange situation. New
Orleans and San Francisco have made
further requisitions upon New York for
currency during the week, and addi
tional shipments to those points are
expected, but the Western demand for
crop-moving purposes has come to an
end. Gold for import has been secured
in the London market, whenever the
movement of money rates did not make
it more profitable for holders of ex
change on London to hold up their col
lection and leave the proceeds on the
loan in London.
A new development has been the
shipments of gold from Japan to San
Francisco. San Francisco's exchange
needs are usually satisfied by way of
Australia, but large Australian crops
has thrown the advantage of exchange
to that center. San Francisco finds it
of greater advantage to dispose of its
sterling exchange claims to Japan and
to take gold from there in compensa
tion. The movement serves as a relief
from the San Francisco demands upon
New York for currency. Confidence is
undiminished that money will become
easier with the turn of the year, and
it is believed that the movement of
stock is in part a discounting of this
expectation.' "
The bond market has been somewhat
irregular, but has grown steadier In
sympathy with stocks. United States
2's and the new 4's declined one-fourth
below the closing call of last week.
MONEY MARKET FIRM.
have been an element in the specula
tion for a decline for some time past.
For instance, the cotton crop indicated
by the' Government's estimate at below
ten million bales would be regarded as
amounting to a national calamity were
it not that the heavy marketing of cot
ton during: November awakens some
skepticism toward the estimate.
INDUSTBIAIi OUTLOOK GOOD.
Reports continue to be received of
the closing down of iron and steel mills
and of new measures of retrenchment
and economy In the trade. The sen
timent over the industrial future also
has grown distinctly more hopeful.
This is especially marked in regard to
the iron and steel trade, from which
come reports indicating that the de
cline in prices has met a revived
demand, which promises some con
sumptive absorption of the lessened
volume of output. The measures of,
economy already adopted and those in
contemplation and the reduced freight
rate3 on steel products for export
arouse hopes of an available outlet in
the foreign trade.
The details of the foreign trade state
ment for October offer gratifying evi
dences of the revival of the export
trade in all lines of manufacture. The
seasonable cold weather has given an
impetus to all lines of distributive trade,
and the coal trade, in which consider
able congestion had developed, is re
ported to be especially benefited by the
cold weather. In the stock market no
small part has been played in the re
covery in the constant circulation of
rumors of important adjustments of
control and of policy touching the rela
tions of groups of capitalists tending to
harmonize those relations.

"Then a friend finally, after much
argument. Induced me to try Grape-
Nuts food and quit my regular food.
Although I had but little faith I com-
imenced to use it and great was my
surprise to find that I could eat it
without the usual pain and distress in
my stomach. So I kept on using
Grape-Nuts and soon a marked im-
provement was shown, for my stomach
was performing its regular work in a
normal way without pain or distress.
"Very soon the yellow coating dis-
appeared from ray tongue, the dull,
heavy feeling in my head disappeared
and my mind felt light and clear; the
languid, tired feeling left, and alto-
geLher I felt as if I had been rebuilt

The proper way out of the difficulty
is to shift to the pure, scientific food,
Grape-Nuts, for it rebuilds from the
foundation up. A New Hampshire
woman says: "Last summer I was
suddenly taken with indigestion and
severe stomach trouble and could not
eat food without great pain; my
stomach was so sore I could hardly
move about. This kept up until I was
so miserable life was not worth liv-
ing.
Proper food is the foundation of

for a time and not feel any 111 results
until there is a sudden collapse of the
digestive organs and then all kinds of
trouble follows.
ON FOOD
The Bight Foundation of Health.
rood Xaten X* Worthless UnleÂ»s Digested
âSome Stomachs Hast Have Help.
Food taken into the stomach, which,
from the nature of the food or the con-
dition of the stomach, is not digested,
is worse than no food at all. This is a
true statement as far as it goes and a
great many dyspeptics go only this far
with their reasoning. They argue with
themselves that because their stomachs
do not do the work given them, they
must be given less work; in other
words, they murt be. starved. It would
be Just as sensible for a business man
who is unable to do all his own work
to cut down his business to his own ca-
pacity as it is for a man to starve
himself to relieve his stomach. The
sensible business man employs help
and goes forward with his business.
Likewise the sensible dyspeptic will
employ help for his stomach and give
his body proper nourishment.
. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
do the work assigned to them. They re-
lieve weak and overburdened stomachs
of a great portion of digestive action.
Their component parts ar* identical
with those of the digestive fluids and
secretions of the stomach and they sim-
ply take up the grind and carry on
the work just the same as a good,
strong, healthy stomach would do It.
On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in their
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance In
the stomach or bowels. They them-
selves digest the food and) supply the
system with all the nourishment con-
tained in what Is eaten and carry out
Nature's plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible is this
method than that employed by many
sufferers from weak stomachs. By
this means body and brain get all the
good, nutritious food they need and the
man is properly nourished and equipped
to carry on his work and perform his
duties. He could not possibly be in
proper working condition by starving
himself or employing some new fangled,
insufficient food that does not contain
enough nutriment for a year-old baby.
A strong man doing strong work must
be properly fed and this'applies to the
brain as well as the body-
Stuart's Dyspepsia : Tablets, by re-
lieving the stomach of its work/enable
it to recuperate and regain its normal
health and strength. Nature repairs
the worn and wasted tissues Just as she
heals and knits the bone of a broken
limb, which is of course not used dur-
ing the process of repair.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and they are the one article that the !
druggist does not try to sell something
in the place of that's "Just as good."
Their unqualified merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every
one. _^ . - . .'..-.':- ,^_<

the nine councils of this city was a
banquet tendered the visiting officials
last evening in the Golden Gate Asy
lum on Sutter street.
There were nearly four hundred at
the festal board. After an excellent
menu had been disposed of, during
which Sichel's orchestra discoursed
popular airs, W. K. Wheelock, master
of ceremonies, introduced Mayor
Schmitz, a member of California Coun
cil, who welcomed the visitors, after
which the senate president responded
and expressed great gratification at the
manner in which he and his fellow offi
cer had been received and entertained
by the National Unionists. He paid a
high tribute to San Francisco, which
he declared will in a few years be the
great commercial city of the Union.
The other speakers were E. H. Hills,
president of the cabinet; Senate Secre
tary Myers, Mayor Warwick of San
Jose, Senate Senators J. E. Field, J.
W. Cuthbert and Arter, M.C. Allen,
ex-Judge Bahrs and Benjamin Schloss.

The very young members of the
Heartsease Auxiliary have reason to be
proud of their first cnarity bazaar,
which they gave yesterday afternoon
and evening at the Palace Maple and
Marble rooms. They found the affair
quite an undertaking, but were so in
tent upon raising funds for the purpose
of a free hospital bed that they put
forth a united effort with very pleas-
Ing results. The California Eye and
Ear Hospital, to which the auxiliary
belongs, Is at present closed, the pa
tients being cared for at various hos
pitals, pending the erection of a suit
able building:, but In case the hospital
board . does not build at once the pro
ceeds of the auxiliary's affair will pay
for & bed ln any other permanent hos
pital to which it may send their pa
tients.
The Marble room was devoted to the
bazaar and the Maple room was re
served for the vaudeville performance
In the evening. The patrons ** freely
opened their purse strings and many
dimes and dollars went into the hos
pital fund. Although the exact sum
netted Is not known, there is no doubt
whatever of the gratifying success.
A unique and pretty Idea was origi
nated for the grab bag. A large table
was transformed into a flower bed, In
which: were growing artificial purple
pansles, emblematic of the auxiliary,
name. A trivial gift was attached to
each root and completely hidden from
view. Upon paying/ 10 cents each pa

Unheralded and unobserved, the happy
young couple arrived from New York
four days ago in a private car and un
til yesterday their identity was a mat
ter known to but few about the hotel.
Yesterday Mr. and Mrs. Stillman. ap
parently feeling that they had at last
escaped the notoriety that followed
them in the East after their marriage,
ventured into the hotel court. They
were there again last evening, he in his
tuxedo and she in a gorgeous gown, and
it was the elaborate attire of the bride
that attracted the attention of the more
curious and finally led to the discovery
of their identity.
Young Stiilman's marriage was quite
a romantic affair, which dated back to
his student days at Harvard two years
age/. There he was stricken down with
typhoid fever and was sent to the
Harvard Infirmary, where he was at
tended through a long siege of sickness
by Miss Mary Wight, a nurse of the in
stitution. Stillman had not long been
an inmate of the hospital before It was
remarked that he was deeply interested
in his fair attendant and was rapidly
thriving under her care. She. too, un
consciously exhibited a keen interest in
her patient's welfare and %vas constant
ly near his bedside, ministering to his
every want.
PURPOSE IS SUSPECTED.
It was not long before the suspicion i
was aroused that Stillman was in love j
with Miss Wight and this was later j
confirmed by the young man when he \
confided to several of his friends his j
Intention of some day making the j
woman who had so carefully watched j
over him during his illness his wife.
On leaving Harvard Stillman,
through the influence of his father,
was given a clerkship in the office of j
the Great Northern Railroad by James i
J. Hill, the understanding being that i
he should work himself up in the rail- J
road world to a position of responsibil- |
ity. In his new employment Stillman I
frequently found time to make a hur- |
ried trip to Augusta. Me., whither Miss J
Wight had gone shortly after he had
left college, and there, in her modest
home, he wooed the woman who is
now his wife.
The announcement of their intend- I
ed marriage four weeks ago was by no j
means pleasant news to young Still- j
man's father or the Rockefellers, but j
apparently both families soon became j
reconciled in a certain degree to the
alliance, for James Stillman and Mrs.
W. G. Rockefeller, together with a
number of their social equals, were ;
conspicuous among the guests at the j
wedding ceremony, which occurred j
November 17 in St. Barnabas Epis
copal Church in Augusta. Since then
Mr. and Mrs. Stillman have been en
joying a wedding tour, which ended in j
this city, for it is here that they will
reside. !
VISITS HARRIHAN.
Stiilman. on Thursday, was among
the visitors to E. H. Harriman's of
fices in the Southern Pacific Railroad
building: and by the president of the
company he was presented to General
Manager Kruttschnitt. His future ca
reer was decided oh by his relatives in
New York two weeks ago. It was
agreed -that he ehould continue in the
railroad business, but farther away
from home and with that end in view
Banker Stillman placed himself in
commutation v.ith President Harri
man, who agreed to find the young
man employment in the local offices.
Here he will enter upon his duties in
a few days, as soon as a comfortable
billet has been found for him.
It has been intimated in the East
that while the wealthy relatives of
young Stillman were willing to attend
his wedding:, it was simply to quell
the prattle that had arisen over his
hurriedly announced marriage and
that after this seeming condescension
the members of his family thought

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal Is the
ra'Â«=t and mott <fflcient disinfectant and puri-
fier in nature, but few realize its value when
taker. Into the human system for the same
cLniisiri; purpose.
ChJicoal iÂ» a remedy that the more you take
of it me better; !t is not a drug at all. but
elir.ply aVt-crbs the eases and iaisvrttlea al-
T.ays t,rt((Ct in the Etoniach and Intestines
and ci.rrieÂ« them out of the cystem.
Charcoal eweetens the breath after smoking,
drti:UlÂ«B or after eating onions and other odor-
ous \Â«-Kft*fcles.
Charctal effectually clear* and Improves the
owrpiexior.. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a r:ttural and eminently eaft cathartic.
It i.bsorl.8 the Injurious Â£as-:s which collect
in the Blcir.ach and bowels; It disinfects the
iKcuth and threat rrotn the poison of catarrh.
All druKcIste sell charcoal In cne form or an-
other, but probably Xhe best charcoal and ths
rcoit lor the inccey Is in Stuart's Absorbent
Lo-cnpes; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal and other hsrm'ees an-
ti:wrtie* sn u.b'et for:n or rather in the form

Dr. William Simpson, health officer of Santa
Clara County, and Dr. H. C. Brown, health
officer of. San Jose, to-day visited the univer
sity and expressed themselves as satisfied wfth
the control of the situation and with the
precautions now beln? taken see do reason
for the further spread of the disease. . There
are now in the detention hospital eight cases
and four suspects. Two students are being
isolated in private houses In Palo Alto. It
is quite jiopsible that a few more cases may
develop, but any extensive spread of the dis
ease is not at all likely. With the precau
tions now being carried out by the Individual
students and members of the community there
is no unusual danger in remaining in the uni
versity till the end of the semester. The uni
versity will not close and there will be no
necessity for the general quarantining of any
of the balls or boarding-houses.
The exact origin of the cases has not been
determined, but there is little doubt that some
student contracted a mild case of diphtheria
during the Thanksgiving recess and returned
to the campus without knowledge of his con
dition, consequently exposing those with whom
he came in contact. The water and milk sup
ply of the community have been under con
stant examination since last year and are be
yond question. All things considered, the dis
ease is well ln hand and there is now no espe
cial reaeon for apprehension.
Emphasis should be placed upon the fact
that there Is no epidemic in the usual sense
of the term. We were only on the edge of
one. The crisis came Thursday, when the iso
lation of the two cases appearing- on- that day
meant either the quarantining of the two halls
or the removal of the patients to the county
peethouse.
With the prompt permission of the univer
sity authorities to use the old psychology lab
oratory for a detention hospital and its sat
isfactory equipment, the one essential factor
in eetrrefating the cases was supplied. It is
now possible to successfully meet any situa
tion that may develop.
The dtohtherla situation to-night is reas
suring. No positive cases have developed dur
ine the day and only three students Have
been admitted to the detention hospital. Every
precaution Is beinc taken to prevent the de
velopment of an epidemic and ample facilities
have now been provided for controlling the
situation. ' *
There are twelve cases of (pnsilitis on
the campus and eight suspects. The
source of the disease has not been dis
covered, but it is supposed that some
student contracted it while away from
the campus during the Thanksgiving
holidays. The authorities state posi
tively that the water and mllk ( supply
of the community are not responsible
for the disease. Dr. W. F. Snow, uni
versity health officer, gave out the fol
lowing official statement to-night:
HEALTH OFFICERS' STATEMENT.
Eight of those patients who are con
nected with the university are being
cared for by the Students' Guild at
their two hospitals. The following four
diphtheria suspects are detained in the
detention hospital: E. Kohl Morrison,
1904, of Denver: J. C. Storey, graduate
student. Seattle; B. Holley, 1906, of
Dixon and N. K. Carpenter, 1907.
The following ten members of the
university, eight students and two
members of the faculty, are at present
suffering from diphtheria: Miss Olive
Neal, 1906, of Lewlston, Idaho; Misa
Edna M. Reeves, 1905, Ukiah, Cal.; H.
E. Savage, 1906; Stephen' Tabor, 1906,
Richmond, Va.; G. D. Boalt, law grad
uate, Palermo, Cal.; I. B. Hunter Jr.,
1904, assistant In engineering, Stan
ford University; C. S. Sherwood, 1907;
H. C. Wilde, 1907; W. J. Neidlg, In
structor in English, Stanford Univer
sity; W- A. Manning, Instructor in
mathematics, Stanford University. In
addition to these Mrs. Scott Brook,
wife of Organist Brook of Memorial
Church, and another person in Palo
Alto, whose name could not be ascer
tained to-night, are stricken with the
disease.
NAMES OF THOSE ILL.
All social functions were stopped by
the authorities to-night in order to
prevent any unnecessary possibility for
further contagion. As a result of the
order the dance which was to be given
by the young ladles of Roble Hall and
another by the Sigma Chi Fraternity
were called off. .
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 5.â
Although a number of cases of diph
theria and tonsilitls have developqrf on
the campus the university health offi
cers stated to-night that the situation
was well ln hand and that there was
no danger of an epidemic. .
However, the fact that there were
numerous cases reported to-day has
created considerable excitement in the
college community and a number of
students have left for their homes, but
these have cone generally ln response
to telegrams from home. A large
number of the women students in Roble
Hall have left the dormitory as the re
sult of two cases of diphtheria discov
ered there, some of them going to Palo
Alto temporarily and others going to
their respective homes.

* Write 'Pyramid Drug' Co., Marshall.
Mich., .for their little book on 'the
causes and cure of piles, which Is sent
free for the asking. ,
The Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by
druggists for 50 cents a package and Its
merit is*, so well known that the 'sales
exceed those' of all * similar remedies
combined. ,
For the Cure of Piles
Ib not. only intensely painful, danger-
ous to life and very expensive, but in
the light of modern medical research,
and since the discovery of the Pyramid
Pile Cure, wholly unnecessary. If you
have any doubt on this point kindly
read the following letter from one who
knows that, the claims regarding the
merits of the Pyramid Pile Cure are
borne out by facts.
"For a long time I suffered with blind
piles. They gave me so much pain and
uneasiness that they almost disquali-
fied me for doing anything. I saw an
ad In the Atlanta Journal of Pyramid
Pile Cure and ordered a 50-cent box.
I used them and they gave me relief;
that encouraged me and I bought an-
other 50-cent box *^.nd they cured me.
Oh, how glad that I am well again!
"The Pyramids cured me and I am
satisfied they will cure anybody else
who Is suffering as I was, If they will
use them.
"You may Use this in any way you
see proper.,. if my experience will en-
courage any sufferer, to use your Pyra-
mids. I shall be glad.'" â ' , .

"Talk about standing on tho corner
watching the houses go by, waiting for
yours to come along," said a San Fran
cisco young ' man, "that's easy com
pared with finding your own room after
the hotel does arrive, the way they're
building them at present. Every floor's
the same and each cell is lika Its fellow.
I was staying in a hotel on Bush street
a year ago and one evening waa called
to the telephone. They had phones on
every other floor, and as my floor waa
an odd one I had to ascend one flight.
"Well, I finished my talk, and being
In a hurry to keep the da â well, any
how, being in a hurry, I very naturally
forgot the floor and went straight for
what appeared to be my room, opened
the door suddenly and entered. Say!
There was one screech, a splash of
golden hair, a disappearing . female â
and I was out. I never knew how. Re
flex action wouldn't work quick enough,
to leave an impression. You can bet I
rushed to the office, though, to 'fess up
and head off the police. 'Grandma.' the
landlady's mother, squared it for me.
but if I hadn't a reputation that -won't
shrink, rip or fade I # never coul<i have
explained it away. And yet. it was all
the fault of thelarchitect!"
Up to the Architect.
Is it a trade? Upon my word, I
think it is a profession and one of the
ancient and honorable. The casual
rogue has rio chance of making him
self free of the guild. He must, in the
first place, be a "college graduate,"
duly provided .with a diploma. The
most notable coachman's college is In
the rue Marcadet, 'yonder on the flank
of Montmarte.'
Officially the college ig known as
the "Ecole d'apprentissage des coches

Characterizing this, Mr. Smith as a union man said: "If
this was not a clear case of exacting money by blackmail
and intimidation then it would be well to know what
constitutes "such .an offense. "Such, an act ought' to .'be
punishcd ; by^imprisonment, and a union which backed up
such methods \will ; either lhave to change its â¢' policy or be
exterminated by outraged public sentiment."' ' . ,
That : the ; paper, was received with every evidence of
approval; by the union men;, to. whom â¢ it" was s . addressed
seems .to ' indicate the speedy of \ conditions
.which, will make these destructive \ industrial

Every one knows that the conductthat has made this
extreme resort necessary has no right nor proper nor
reasonable relation to the. principles of organized labor.
They inhere only in the impulse to make unlawful use of
physical force. The Avisest menin organized labor know
that industrial peace can never prevail as long as men
are taught that they are in a class by 'themselves and that
every other man's hand is against them. At a recent
meeting of the Engineers' Union, a member, Mr. Cecil B.
Smith, read a paper on this subject that may be bene
ficially studied by all workingmen and employers and by
the citizens who constitute what President Roosevelt
called the "third party in interest"â a party that suffers
all the cost and consequences of industrial : warfare and
has rip organizatiqn through which to assert its rights.
Speaking of unioh;Iabor as a union man Mr.< Smith said:
"The' "demagogue must be purged from its ranks. and
the walking delegate who traffics his position for boodle
and becomes a mass of corruption, a parasite who sucks
the very life blood.out of the movement and makes it an
easy prey .to its. enemies.. Methods of intimidation arid
coercion belong tothe past and should be buried with it.
There are plenty, of capitalists and corporations too, for
that, matter, who,, if they were approached ; in a proper
spirit of fairmindedness; would> only be too glad to meet
the demands of ;labor Â¦ in- an j open, ' honorable/ straight
forward'manner, perfectly willing to live. and let live.
But, when organized labor acts the demagogue by making
arbitrary and unjustifiable' demands it simply^ plays the
better spirited employers into the, hands of those capital
ists â¢ and; emploj'ers who v would not concede to" labor the.
right to. live only.that it; may be exploited of the fruits of
its Â¦industry. â¢ . '
; : "No nian in his"; right senses can- deny- that-many , of
the acts which have lately. Â¦ been made . public as ' perpe
trated by organized labor-have been little short of fiend
ish;' acts. which seemed'to me incredible, for in my eight
or more years' association with- organized labor I have
never personally encountered; such conditions arid could
not believe them to exist until convinced by sheer weight
of evidence. I refer, for. instance, to the practice J of
arrhing'a-* walking delegate with the authority 'to call a
strike on his own 'initiative. Just fancy walking up to a
workman, who is entirely oblivious to there
being any trouble whatsoever between himself and his
employer, and demanding that he quit work! So a strike
is declared and in'manyv cases iwhen the, workman de
murred at what he justly considered such tyrannical
measures of procedure he is met by a 'shower of abuse
mingled with threats." If this is freedom then what under
the sun '-would constitute tyranny /or slavery? If it-be
come'a .recognized, fact; that .a necessary qualification lor
membership in a. union is the surrender of one's manhood
to .the arbitrary, demands of .an official bully then trades
unionism will have to: go, and the sooner , it goes, under.
,' such conditions- the. beUcr.. for. all, concerned, for. instead
of promoting 'progress such -retard it and place
us in the status of the dark" ages."
Continuing, : he ; said that the* labor unions must in
crease their strength and become a force to be reckoned
with on the lines of reason and justice and that' the union
should be the workingman'sjcollege, schooling him in tljf
knowledge of economics... Referring, to the internecine
wars between. unions he cited this.'caser-During the con
struction of a large building a;walking delegate. appeared
declaring that though* the whble'job v was unionized some"
of the work had been done by. the! wrong union and im
mediately, called a strike on the ,whole : work. Subse
quently*'he. found' that he was mistaken that the
right "union : \ had done - the work and *ordercd the men

When I arrived at Boma. the capital
of the Congo Free State. I had nowhere
to go. There was a two-story hotel,
nsed for housing the agents of the'Con

$3 a day to stay there, and that was as
far beyond me aÂ« a million. But soon I
found employment as an engineer with
the Congo Free State, and then I board
ed at the hotel., with the rest of the
government men.
Here I had a chance to study the
question of making American plo"heer
life practical in this country. At first it
did seem as though the chances were
against it. The employes of the gov
ernment were dying very rapidly.

not stand the climate. Some went; on

and very liable to die on the way home;

I went aboard the Volte with a pack
of clothes that I could carry and a 44
Winchester. It was a nasty voyage. I
was the butt of all the Jokes. The idea
of an explorer with only as many
clothes as he could carry and a popgun
for big game! I tried to explain pioneer
life In. America, and that all the cow
boys used 44 Winchesters, and that a 44
Â¦was a big gun compared with the old
mutrle-loading, patch-bulleted Boone
rifle and that the Americans used
small bores and shot straight instead of
using a big gun and shooting anywhere.
There were several old co^et traders
on board, and what fun they had with
me! They were going out for three
years for a large coast trading com
pany, Which furnished e\'erything to Its
employesâ European food exclusively
two or three bottles of beer a day, a
few bottles of seltzer water and as
much brandy and wine as theywanted;
and notwithstanding all thfÂ«s, these men
hail tons of luggage of their own. They
laughed at my ideas of making Ameri
can pioneer life practical In Africa.
What was I going to do for "medical
comfort." as they called their cham
pagne and cognacs. Madeira wines and
liquors? I could not live without it to
put blood in my veins^ they said. But
before I arrived at the coast it was the
opinion of the people on board that I
knew what I was about; that there -was
6ome mission I had been sent on and
was Just going this way as a blind;
that my luggage was ful> of gold, etc
So the teasing stopped.
It was Just before Christmas of 1889.
and on Christmas day the Volte, a boat
of Elder Dempster & Co., was to sail
for the western coast of Africa. I had
taken passage on her, and though it
seemed very impractical to go and com
mit suicide, as every one thought, I de
termined to accept my fate.
Looking back at my start for Africa
I rather pity myself. I can see that
American boy on the Liverpool landing
stage, without a friend on that side of
the Atlantic and without a single letter
of introduction, but with infinite faith
that no matter what came he would ac

Inflated confidence soon was punctured.
I talked with several Englishmen who
were supposed to know the coast of Af
rica, and they all discouraged ma. At
last I visited Dr. Guiness at Hull
House, who had lately returned from a
trip up the Congo. I'told him my plans,
and he said that I could not live there
three months without medicine, Euro
pean food and backing from the civit
ized world, and that it was simply sui
cidal to go as I expected to. Xo con
vict ever heard his sentence with great
er despair than was mine as I listened
to Dr. Guiness exploding my pet theo
ries.
As the years passed I made every
thing conform to my boyhood's resolve,
and at last, in 1889, I found myself at
the mouth of the Congo.
I was then 22 years of age. I had
very little equipment, but I had a store
of knowledge gleaned from every Afri
can authority I could consult. I imag
ined I was well prepared to meet all
emergencies.

or partially fnozen over. These inge
nious people long ago realized the
need of a vehicle capable of traveling
on either ice or water safely, and
about thirty years ago they launched
the first "scooter," a boat constructed
to travel on both Ice and in water. It
w%s a small boat, made fast to a sled,
which .was pushed on the ice and
rowed on the water. This crude mode
of travel with the wind against or
across the boat made the trip one of
tremendous exertion. In the course
of time a sail was tried, at first square
rigged and very small, but it was used
only when the wind was fair. Then a
special boat was built, which was par
tially decked, and the sled was matla
lighter until at last the scooter of the
present day came about, with nothing
left of the sled but the bottom of tho
runners, shod .with iron, or, better
still, as . experience has shown, with
brass. And so has developed the won
derful "scooter" of the Long Island

will sail in the water and from one

GENERAL GREEN in the Colusa - Sun
about the .effort 1 to acquire for. preservation v and
public use the Calaveras grove* of big trees that:
"The Calaveras big trees got into private hands through
the fraudulent use of the United States land laws,, and
now" the o\v*ners are busy, getting- up all. sorts of -petitions'
begging the Government to condone .the fraud and; per
jury by which the land passed into private. hands and in
addition pay a vast forjune for lands which cost $2 50 per
acre. We have a circular letter from Mrs: White telling
us all about the danger of the destruction of the big
trees. "Mrs. White could not be used directly in the
premises, but she is being used all the same by these
speculators." . â¢ , ;Â» \
Now we think this is all a mistake, an honest mistakef
but . its 'effect may be deplorable. Long years ago>th>:
Calaveras big trees passed into private ownership and
became the property of' Mr. Sperry, . and: there was no
taint nor shadow of fraud in the transaction. He owned
them at least thirty years. Financial'Tiecessity caused
him to mortgage the tract for a large sum of" money. He
persistently and repeatedly tried to sell the -property. 7 He
proposed that the State should purchase, it, and there is
evidence that be made every effort to get out of his pre
dicament in such a way as to free himself of/debt and
preserve the trees for the public. But he met with no
response from any quarter. '.'.". fj*. :
Of course it is unfortunate that at that time public sen
timent in this State* on the subject' was not at concert
pitch and there was no such organization as the Waters
and Forests Society or the Outdoor Ltague to take ad
vantage, of his offer and secure the grove at a nominal
price. Failing at every turn he finally spld the* trees,
embodied in a large lumbering tract ; of yellow pine and
sugar pine timber, to Mr. Whiteside of Minnesota. After
this was done public sentiment was aroused and an ef
fort began to acquire the trees from, Mr.. Whiteside.
Instead of being used by a speculator to sell back to
the Government at a great price lands acquired by. fraud
and perjury Mrs. White has labored ceaselessly to make
the best of a situation created by the past neglect of our
people. This effort has attracted interest and. enlisted
effort far and wide. In New England and the Southern
States. it has the benefit of the splendid rise; of public
feeling for the guarding of the forests of the country. It
has secured the co-operation of economists who know
the value of forests as related to the conservation of
moisture and to the permanence. of a timber supply, and
it has the concurrence 'of sentimentalists who see the
scenic-value of saving the forests and their relation to the
esthetic life of the people. Now if the idea got out that
at the base of it all is a fraud akin to the, land frauds
that are now attracting so much attention and are under
judicial examination for punishment by the courts all
of this support will be alienated and the last state of the
big trees will be worse than the first.
For thesereasons we ask that General Green revise his
conclusions in the light of the facts as we have stated
them, for he is loyal to California and to the purpose of
Mrs. White's efforts. He will see that if if be true that
the old patent to these lands be vitiated by fraud, as the
statute of limitations does not run in civil cases against
the Government, the lands can .be. resumed to Federal
ownership and- no appropriation^ for their purchase- is
necessary. If this idea become current among members
of Congress their aversion, to appropriating money for
such a purpose will have an' excuse which cannot be suc
cessfully answered. We are warranted in assuming that
when â¢' Mr. Whfteside contemplated such a '. large invest
ment in real property he secured an abstract. of title
which showed that' the. fee simple was actually and law
fully and equitably in the man from whom he bought
This being the case there can be no legal ground for
voiding the title which he purchased and paid for. The
matter is of too much importance to be left whereit is
and, we are sure that General Green will give it his im
mediate attention. , ~ :
In his article he says: "There is. no danger in the wide
world; of the destruction of those trees. There is no
known machinery that will cut them into lumber/ and if
there.were the grove is worth more for a^ resort. than for
the lumber. If the petition asked the Government to
take up the matter of /.fraud in connection with the. title,
and if that should be found good to fix a price at some
reasonable, advance on the purchase price and take the
groves, we would sign it and work for it, butas long as it
has all , the' earmarks of being got", up and pushed by
the so-called owners we beg to be excused.'
Granting that the trees are worth more'standing than
felled and sawed/ they should be held by the public and
not by the private owner of a resort/subject to the muta
tions, of his fortune, as they were in. the. case of Mr.
Sperry: With the element of alleged fraud 'eliminated
the' "earmarks" suggested are non-existent. The tract
which it is proposed to purchase is heavily timbered
with_ other trees of. high commercial value, and we are
told that the land so timbered is worth the money pro
posed to be paid for it even if the Government were
moving in the. matter on purely, commercial. lines.

MISTAKE ABOUT THE cTREES.
There was one thing I found that I
was not looking for â namely, the fever.
I had not been there three months be
fore my first attack. It was not serious,
but, of course, when a man has the first
attack he always imagines he Is going
to d.ie. He laughs about it afterward,
but he does not laugh at the time. The
fever is generally caused by biliousness,
and in this country It would not be
looked upon as serious, but it is gener
ally serious enough in its results.
Homesickness arid an excited imagi
nation have much to do with bringing
it about. At first my fever did not
amount to much, and there were inter
vals of some two weeks between at
tacks. Then they became" more fre
quent and at last the fever lasted all
the time. My temperature was*pos
sibly only a fraction of a 'degree above
normal in the morning with an Increase
of one or $xvo degrees during the day.
Some days it wouid run to three or
four degrees above normal. I gradually
lost my strength, and in the course of
three months was nearly a wreck. The
doctors said I must Â¦ go home. ,Dr.
Guiness was right, then, and all those
years of planning and preparing were
to be thrown away. I believed im
plicity in the Congo State doctor, and
he said I would die. It was easier to
die than to return and admit failure.
The English boats came in once a
month. One was almost due.. The day
before it came I decided Â¦ not to be
taken aboard, determining to stay at
all costs. I stayed and 'got well and
found out that I had not been taking
enough quinine. There was nothing
wrong with my constitution, as has
been proven since. For, after. learning
how to live in Africa, I never had an
other attack of fever during the whole
of my first trip, although exposed to
the worst hardships.
When I recovered from my acclima
tization I had an offer from a trading
company to go to the Upper Congo. I
was to take with me some heavy loads
of a section steamer that had been de
serted and left behind' by the carriers
and construct the boat on the Upper
Congo, above the rapids, on Stanley
Pool, the other part of the boat having
been carried up to the pool.' This work
would take me 300 miles farther*'! nto
the interior. It-was Just'what I want-'
ed and had been looking for, so I ac
cepted and went. . ;
At this stage the Upper Congo was
little known to the civilized world, and
there were many of , the tributaries of
the Congo with only a portion of their
navigable water explored, while .; the
inland was -totally unknown.' ' After
finishing the steamer I ran her on her
first trip to Stanley Falls, which was a
place of Importance to the Arabs. 'Van
Kirchoven was north of. the Arulmml
at the time with a big expedition, and
the Hodister expedition was being or
ganized. Tiputib was on his way. to
Zanzibar, having jusfleft the falls; and
Rashid, his nephew, had arrived with
a convoy of ne,wly raided slaves and
a great quantity of ivory. '' '. * â¢
Many of the slaves died here on ac
count of the failure in crops, and of
smallpox. Some twenty a Â¦â¢ day' were
dying and were pitched into the river.
AH the horrors pictured by the other
explorers were enacted here! I made
the acquaintance of some of. the great
Arab leaders of the Lamoml and Ny
angwa, among whom were TIputlb's
brother and " eon." ' On ' my 'return to
Brazzaville, . on Stanley . Pool, â¢ we
learned of the massacre of Cranipell, a
French explorer^ who*; was trying, to get
through to, Lake Tehad from the": Mob
ang^ii River. Crampell had several
white men with him, also atroop ; of a
hundred or, 1 so Senegalese 'soldiers.
They, were all killed excepting one of
the white men, who "escaped "Â¦ "and
brought the news to Brazzaville. -
v An,<expedition was organized to chas
tise the "Arabs between the | Mobarigul
and Lake Tehad, with M.:Duboscy at
its head, and a little later I started up
the Mobangul . with part 6f.it. "I got
as far as ,the first rapids of the:Moban
gui, where the French post, , Bangui, is
now situated. â¢ Then Â¦ it/ was oÂ»ly a few
huts. ' Here the 'steamer/ could : go no
farther, the current over the rapids be
ing, too swift for dny. stern-wheeler.
The expedition debarked: and; r went
back to Brazzaville, "\yhen I . returned

I had to keep still and wait for de
velopments. One might stay ' on the
coast, as some, men have done, for
years without- seeing any of the won
ders of this great country t and these
are generally the men who give infor-'
mation and advice. They have made
up Jn imagination what they lacked in
experience and have helped the world
to form an erroneous opinion of Africa
as a modern inferno.
I did not know what to think of many
things, and . great was my surprised to
find that my Ideas of the new country
were wholly different from the reality.
At a . distance the foliage looked j the
eame as in the temperate aorie. From
all I had read I had expected to find
great tropical forests, crowded with
palm, cocoanut and banana trees, with
dense undergrowth. ' Now, the palms
are comparatively scarce in Africa and
the cocoanut and the banana must be
planted like the orange.
â¢ And where were the crocodile, snakes
and large animals familiarly associated
in our minds with Africa? I saw noth
ing: that had a tropical look but parrots.
Once I did see a few monkeys which a
native brought in to sell. There were
also a few crows with white spots on
them and a few vultures, very , lame.
The natives were not ferocious. They
wore the orthodox breech clout and in
looks they were as negroes in Ameri
ca. They all spoke a pigeon English,
Portuguese or French. And why should
they not, seeing they, had been used to
the white, man for the last 200 .years?
All along the western coast the prevail
ing speech Is English.
The heat was not, oppressive, being
at the seaboard, the air was balmy and
pleasant. And right here under the
equator, where I had expected it to be
unbearable, I suffered less from the
heat than I have often done in my na
tive land. I was much disappointed to
find things so tame. Look where I
might, there were no big animals, not
even little snakes. There were not even
active insects to be enthusiastic over, i
It to form a number to designate '. the
body. This state of affairs made the
men take more and more "medlcafcom

warious.".. Each and every allegation of the English gentle
man is true, but we cannot agree with him upon, the deduc
tion ;that*these are the symptoms *of a coming attack of
rational paresis.. '
Our constitution and the spirit of our laws guarantee abso
lute religious freedom." A' man may set up. a golden calf in
his back yard and bow down to it thrice daily -without let or!
hindrance from the law. The Puritans came to Massachu
setts to gain religious freedom; the Lutherans left the Palat
inate, the CalvinistsleftjFrance for the same purpose. For
the same reason there come to our^shores to-day subjects of
the Czar and vassals of the Sultan: In these United States
there is in fact so much "toleration that freedom has become
license and waxed into such luxuriant growth.that it has de
veloped'characteristics which are unique. â¢
v Every country has its class" of individuals erratic in a mora
or less virulent form. In Russia, such people are housed in
prisons to rot.: In France and Italy'they are shadowed by
the police. Such repression develops religious fervor into
nihilism and anarchy.- In our country, where there is no
repression, the erratic, spirit assumes some most bewildering
forms, but our! freak religionists are. in the main harmless.
Our nihilists and our anarchists are all made abroad.

The Board of Education yesterday
held a conference with Commissioner
Herbert Schmitz of the Board of Pub
lic .Works for the purpose of coming
to an agreement as to whether Inspec
tor of School Buildings James B. Mc-
Sheehy or Assistant Inspector Com
mary shall be removed from his posi
tion under a resolution adopted by the
Board of Education at its last meet
ing.
By the termtf of the resolution the
Board of Education requested the
Board of Public Works to dismiss the
inspector of school buildings owinÂ» to
lack of funds and the consequent lay
ing off of a number of mechanics In
the school repair department. '/;
The Board of Works refuses to re
move McSheehy| assigning as a reason
that McSheehy .was appointed from
the civil service . eligible list and Com
xnary was not. It was stated at the
conference that the Board of Educa
tion , desired to retain Commary be
cause he keeps the books of the de
partment. McSheehy is hot a book
keeper and the board declared that a
bookkeeper is absolutely necessary; In
the repair department. ;
The board further held that an In
spector of school repairs was not re
quired because there j was now \ but
three carpenters, two plumbers, two
plumbers' helpers, .'. one tinner, , two
painters and one ; locksmith , employed
on. school buildings .and these did riot
requite to be watched at their work.
The two painters will be laid off to
morrow and there* will be but nine ineri
employed in making repairs that are
absolutely : needed on school buildings.
For; that reason the' board Insisted on
the retention of Commary, who Is a
bookkeeper.

PREPARES BILL
FOR BOND ISSUE
Detective George McMahon. Corporal
Dan Sylvester, his squad and Special
Policemen George Downey and Gus
Finn were on the scenes of both af
fairs soon after they happened. The
officers learned the cause of the trouble
and until a late hour searched for Mah
Noon, but" were unable to locate him.
Noon is' the man who, on March - 30,
1S98, shot and killed LIm. Sier and seri
ously injured . Policeman . Pat , Tracy.
The indictment for. the latter crime is
still hanging over his head. While serv
ing a term for murder in San Quentin^
Henry T. Gage, who was then Governor,
acquired a taste for the Mongolian's
dainty cooking and, paroling him, took
him to his ranch at Downey.
On January 6 of the present year, the
then Governor granted Mah Noon an
absolute pardon, though his crime was
one of the most cold-blooded ever com
mitted in Chinatown and hjs record ona
' of the worst.
For the last two weeks Mah Noon
has been engaged in blackmailing
houses throughout the district and was
a leading spirit in the trouble between
the Wong family and the Sen Suey
Yings, which was recently settled.
SEARCH FOR MAH NOON".
When the Hod Sings learned that
Mah Noon was bent on murder several
animated discussi'ons regarding his pur
pose occurred on the streets. Then hos
tilities broke out anew, and a few min
utes afterward How Kam Yue, a Sen
Suey Ying man, lay on a sidewalk at
the corner of "Waverly place and Wash
ington street with a bullet through his
neck. Boo Wan Hoey, the Hop Sing
man who shot him, ran down to the
corner of Kearny and Sacramento
streets, where he was captured by Spe
cial Policeman Barney Maloney. The
wounded man Identified him at the Re
ceiving Hospital. How Kam Yue will
recover.
Then the Sen Suey Yings, bent on re
venge, started out in search of a Hop
Sing man and half an hour after the
first shooting Chan Luey was hit by a
bullet as he was passing in front of 17
Spofford alley. As In the first case,
his injuries were not serious and at
the hospital he accused Won Ah Chew,
a Sen Suey Ying highbinder, of having
fired the shot. The latter made his es
cape.
HOSTILITIES OPEN.
Mah Xoon, the notorious highbinder
v.'ho was paroled from San Quentin and
later griven a pardon by Governor Gage,
was the occasion of two shooting affairs
In Chinatown last night. He has been
in the city but a few days, and since
his arrival has returned to his habits of
strife, blackmail and blood, with the re
sult that war between two powerful
tongs, has been resumed, and the police
predict much loss of life before its
close.
Mah Noon is a Sen Suey Ying high
binder, and early last night lay in wait
for Mah On, the interpreter for the Hop
Sing tong. Mah On had been shot by
the Sen Suey Ylng men about seven
months ago near the See Yup head
quarters, but when he recovered the
hatchet was burled, and- it remained
for Mah Noon to revive . old' feeling as
soon as the gates of the prison had
been opened to him. Mah Noon had a
big revolver and intended to finish the
work of murder whioh his tong had
left undone.

An investigation was made quietly
by the firm's employes, but no clew
could be found to the perpetrators of
the brutal act, and it was decided to
ask the assistance of the police. Several
of the men employed by the firm went
out oh strike about a week ago. Wheth
er or not the strike had anything to do
with the act of vandalism is a matter
of conjecture, but there is a strong sus
picion that the persons implicated are
known to the strikers.
A copy of the letter to the Chief of
fering the reward was read to the dif
ferent watches at the police stations
throughout the city yesterday, and
every effort will be made to discover
the identity of the vandals.
In the stockyards on "Wednesday
were fourteen lambs. They were all
right when Charles Riddy, the man
ager, locked up the place for the niffht,
but when he went there on Thursday
morning he found their dead carcasses
scattered over the place. An examina
tion by the Board of Health inspectors
showed that the skulls of the ani
mals had been crushed in, their necks
brokeuvand twisted and they had been
mutilated in other ways.
Chief of Police Wittman was notified
yesterday by Miller & Lux of a gross
act of vandalism that was perpetrated
in their stockyards, on Sixth avenue
and M street, South San Francisco, last
Wednesday night or Thursday morn
ing. The firm offers a reward of $500
for Information that will lead to the
arrest and conviction of the miscreant
or miscreants.

mark. The sum of cash in bank is
considerable. There is a growing sen
tiijjent in favor of acquiring new quar
ters and giving the membership of the
club comforts and facilities which
cannot'be given in the rooms now oc
cupied by the league. Since the fail
ure of the plan to buy a lot and build
a house on Stockton street, facing
Union Square, J there has i been much
talk of a project to join . the Press
Club in a lease of the premises now
occupied by the Pacific-Union, but as
the last named institution will not be
able to get into the new building be
fore November next the proposition' to
co-operate with the Press Club has r.ot
taken definite form.
The presidency of the Union League,
Club during the year of a Presidential j
I campaign is regarded as a position !
I that carries considerable prestige in a:
I political sense. Next Tuesday there _
i will he a general meeting of club mem- {
I bers for the purpose of selecting a
committee to nominate officers for the .
ensuing , year. Colonel George H. ; â¢
i Pippy's second , term as 'president.. of/
the league is drawing, to a finish and
there is a deal of gossip among: the >
members concerning hissuccessor.* â¢Â¦. j
Next in the regular. order of promo- |
tion is First Vice- President Colonel !
! Samuel" J. Hendy. '.The incident^ how-.]
J ever, is recalled that the "regular or- |
; der" was set asidÂ« one year, ago when J
L Duncan E. McKinlay, a- brilliant- and â¢
! persuasive orator of the Republican?*
! party, was defeated for the presidency |
[ by the advocates of a second term for,;
j Colonel Pippy. The latter had dis- j
1 played so much enterprise in the work |
i of enrolling new members and increas- Â¦
'ing the club's store of money "in the
bank that many V members readily
acquiesced in the plan to set aside tra
ditions and re-elect him to leadership.
â. Duncan McKinlay accepted the. re
; Suit with as much complacency as
.could be expected. Whether Colonel
I Hendy's friends will now stand aside
I and give the campaign orator the right
â¢Â¦ ot way to the presidency of the club
may be determined at the general .
' meeting next Tuesday. j
; The ticket which is put forward by i
! the nominating committee is styled the :
, regular ticket and it generally wins
] out. It happens, ohce in a great while,
that a candidate for president pack*
I the general meeting with his special
supporters^Jhid thus obtains a-nomina
i tion contrary to the wishes of the gen
eral body of the league. .. When this :
happens the dissenting members put j
an opposition ticket in the field and a
fight in the open to a finish is the re
sult.

the agreement under protest.
"A meeting of the Restaurant Keep
ers' Association was called on Thurs
day afternoon and it was decided to
take a determined stand in opposition
to.the unions. Another meeting was
held yesterday afternoon. On the
morning of the meeting the union called
out the ere* of J. Bettz's restaurant at
24 Ellis street because Mr. Bertz re
fused to be Intimidated into signing the
agreement. At the meeting In the aft
ernoon Mr. Bertz received instructions
from the association not to sign the
agreement and to keep his place closed.
It was also decided to send the unions
an ultimatum that If the men did not
return to work by 10 o'clock Saturday
morning all the restaurants would close
on Sunday night. Instead of heeding
our ultimatum, at 11 o'clock this
morning the union called out the crew
of the Tlvoll Cafe and that place closed
its doors. .
BESTAUBAITT MEN, TO MEET.
"At another meeting held this after
noon, the members , of the association
were instructed to close their places of
business Sunday night and not to re
open on Monday morning."
Mr. Johnson says that fully one hun
dred restaurants will close their doors.
He believes that restaurant men who
are not members; of the association
will stand by the organization in "this
fight. There Is to be another meeting
in Eagles' Hall, 731 Market street, this
afternoon and all restaurant keepers
are invited to be present so that they
may learn the true facts of the case. ,

who has been engaged by the Brock
syndicate of â¢Philadelphia to' build, the
new railroad from the Tonopah min

TO BE HURRIED
PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE FIRST MEET . OF - THE \ SEASON OF
THE SAN MATEO COUNTY HUNT DRAG HOUNDS, HELD AT THE
BURLINGAME COUNTRY CLUB YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
.To mark the occasion fittingly, Mr.
Carolan entertained thirty-five guests
at a hunt breakfast on the clubhouse
veranda. In keeping with the day,
the table decorations were of a hunt
ing character. There were violets, smi
lax and pink roses with miniature
fences and brooks and also horses and
hounds in miniature. An orchestra
discoursed sweet music and lent its en
livening, influence to.the occasion.
â¢~; The arrival of Huntsman Jerry Keat
ing with j twelve couples of hounds on
the lawn near the clubhouse drew -the
merrymakers to (the scene. Hunters
were being' led upland down- and there
was an air of suppressed excitement
among the hunting men and their fair
friends.
.At the word from Mr.' ; Carolan, the
hounds were laid on and a rush was
made by the onlookers for a vantage
point from which to view the, first
jump.s This was into a 'field to the
northeast of the clubhouse. The first
flight were over clean, and then there
was a clatter of hoofs as some horses
struck the top boards. One horse, de
void of .sporting instinct, refused the
issue entirely.
The scent took the hounds down tow
ard the railroad v track, then to the
west past the Carolan place. It bore
to the.southwest here, over the Tevis
property in order to clear the golf
links, forbidden territory for the hunt
ing men.' The finish was on the George
Howard property. ' The distance was
about seven miles/ The run was a short
one and avoided the foothills, as both
hounds and hunters are not in condi
tion at this early date for severe work.
â¢ Mr. Carolan rode his favorite hunter,
Merry Boy. Huntsman Keating rode
the Bell mare, while the two "whips,"
Fred Johnson and Charles Richardson,
were mounted on Spectator and Scar
boro, - also from * Mr. Carolan's stable.
Mr. Carolan had as guests Mr. Gerry,
a son of Commodore Gerry of , New
York, and a friend who accompanied
him to this coast. There were an un
usual number of strangers among the
field, which included Walter Martin,
E. W: Howard and others. One horse
was taken to the meet for a lady to
*lde, . but the fair sportswoman was
not in evidence. . Â¦-..
- * C. W. Clark has sent East for 'â¢ two
hunters arid other enthusiasts have or
dered horses. With these and the for
eign Â¦ polo contingent ; the season- gives
promise of affording great sport in this
healthful recreation.
The springy turf afforded safe and
excellent footing for .the horses yester
day, making galloping a delight to the
well mounted" hunting* men.
Burlingame Country Club in its set
ting of green made a fitting frame yes
terday for the first meet of the season
of the San Mateo County Hunt Drag
Hounds. The scarlet coats of the mas
ter, Francis J. Carolan, and of the hunt
servants, the hounds 4 and the well
groomed hunters made a series of bril
liant pictures. " .
Notwithstanding that Ferrell made
a wide, turn into the stretch, claiming
the three-year-old ran out, Bay Won
der won by a narrow margin from
horses he outclassed. In the race won
by Casclne on December 2 the Judges
again had word that Ferrell would not
try to win with Don Domo. The "gray
streak" ran third.
Adklnsywas developed by Dell Foun
tain, the Idaho horseman. Last sum
mer Fountain sold the boy's contract to
Tiehenor.& Newgass of Chicago a^d he
was to ride for that firm next season.
From- information In "possession of
the stewards, Adkins pulled Rollick
on Tuesday. December 1. when Milton
Jones' horse was beaten by Father
Wentker, ridden by HalK Rollick was
started back the next day, and, with
Martin In the saddle, finished first. On
the same day he rode John A. Scott
contrary to orders, when the chestnut
was. beaten -by Iridius. The stewards
have evidence in this case also that he
knew what he was doing in disobey
ing, stable instructions. The exhibi
tion Adkins furnished on Meehanus
December 3 did not help his case.
Bookmaker "Jim" Davis is a mem
ber of the Metropolitan Turf Associa
tion and is considered one of the keen
est pencilers in the business. He is
a Calif ornlan and" is well known on
tracks throughout the country.
M. Z. de Armond holds a contract on
Hall and Barney Schrelb^r has second
call on his services. "D." is a capable
rider and soon became popular with
turfgoerS. Among other rides charged
up against Hall, the one on Bragg,
which ran a disgraceful race, on No
vember 2S, is the worst. On this occa
sion, it is claimed, Davis took great
liberties with the horse. 'Â¦Hall was
carded to pilot Divina In the handicap
yesterday and the officials were early in
receipt of information to the effect that
Hall intended to pull the horse. Book
maker Davis took all kinds of wagers
on the mare until Martin was substi
tuted for Hall. Then he rubbed out his
prices and stood pat. Diyina was beat
en, 'however, notwithstanding thÂ»
change, owing to poor racing luck,
and Davis* sheets show he won more
than $3700 on the- race.
yMuch Information and facts possessed
by the stewards was not divulged.
From advices received by the Judges
at Oakland Ferrell was down to pull
Bay Wonder, from the} stable of his
employer, J. F. Newman, which started
favorite In a sprint on November 30.
DON DOMO IS PUT J.KT>.
"At a meeting of the board of stew
ards of the New California Jockey
Club, held at 23 Kearny street Decem
ber 5, the'-- following rulings were
made: James Davis, bookmaker, is
ruled off the turf. The stewards are
in possession of information to the ef
fect that Davis and Danny Lynch
have been in collusion with Jockeys D.
Hall, Ferrell, and M. Adkins to have
horses pulled and to lay against them
in a book conducted by said Davis.
Jockeys Hall, Adkins and Ferrell are
a^so ruled off. The said D. J. Lynch
having already been ruled off by the
Western Jockey Club, it is beyond the
power of the stewards to inflict any
further punishment upon him."
Not sincere days of the Little Pete
scandal, when Jockeys Chorn, Heln
richs and Chevalier were debarred all
privileges of the turf, has such a
bombshell been exploded and ' such a
sensation created. When scandal bobs
to the surface it looks as if the name
of Danny Lynch would not down,
whether guilty or innocent. Shortly be
fore the season opened "Frisco" Land,
who trained the horses owned by
Lynch until both were ruled off the
turf in Chicago, purchased a saloon
and lodging-house lit Emeryville not
many blocks from the track. Accord
ing to the evidence produced last night.
Hall made his first misstep by engag
ing quarters there.
HALL'S BAD RIDE ON BRAGG.
For some (lays since the inception of
the racing soason now in progress at
Oakland track there have been mur
murings of discontent and insinuations
cast about by owners that their horses
had been Dulled or had received bad
rides. ;::^-
Where there is smoke there is bound
to be some fire, and some of these poor
rides have not passed unnoticed by the
officials at Oakland. Competent and re
liable men were engaged to watch the
movements of certain riders whose
names were brought under suspicion,
as well as some bookmakers known to
be on friendly terms with these riders.
The denouement came last night.
The stewards of the New California
Jockey Clu'o met last evening and ruled
off the turf Bookmaker '"Jim"" Davis,
and Jockeys D. Hall, Ferrell and Ad-
Kins. The foil ruling is' herewith given:
RULING OF THE STEWARDS.
James Davis, the Well-Known Book
maker, Is Charged With Laying
Against the Horses Pulled
and Is Also Ruled Off.
"Failing to get the agreement signed,
they called out the crews of Owens &
Starr's two restaurants. Owens & Starr
â¢ then signed the agreement under pro
test and the men went back to work.
"The committee Immediately " after
ward called out the crew of Jacobsbn's
restaurant, during. the absence of the
proprietor, who was then at my place
CALL "WAITERS OUT.
"The tacit agreement provided that
at no time should the association en
ter into any agreement with any em
ploye or set of employes giving differ
ent agreements from our agreement
with them. During the month of
August an agreement was entered into
by the unions with the Louvre, Zin
kand's. Odeon, Little Louvre and
Techau's wherein there was a stipula
tion for the recognition of the unions.
"When we were informed of that fact
we contended that our agreement
should be amended to meet these condi
tions, there being no question of chang
ing hours and wages. About the same
time a complaint was filed by the un
ions against Mr. Wolfe, who conducts
a cafe in the Claus Spreckels building,
because he employed a chief cook who
v.as a non-union man. Once before a
similar complaint was filed, and which
â¢was acted on to the satisfaction of the
unions, as In a good many instances.
"When the last complaint against
Mr. Wolfe was filed the Restaurant
Keepers' Association contended that he
should not be compelled to discharge
his non-union cook. Inasmuch as the
unions had entered into an agreement
with the Louvres and grottos giving
them "open ehop' conditions. The en
tire matter came up before the Mayor
on September 30 last, and the Mayor
took it under advisement and has since
failed to render a decision.
"About one week ago the Cooks'
Union No. 44, the Walters' Alliance No.
20, and the Cooks' Helpers' Union
mailed a blank copy of a new agree
ment to the individual members of the
Restaurant Keepers' Association. Last
Thursday a committee from the differ
ent unions called on Owens & Starr, J.
Jacobson and several others and re
quested them to elgn the agreement.
These gentlemen said they were mem
bers of the association and referred the
committee to it.
Mr. Johnson yesterday gave out the
following Btsatement for the press rela
tive to the present trouble:
"A year ag<^ the Restaurant Keepers'
Association entered into an agreement
with Cooks' U&ion No. 44 and Waiters'
Alliance No. 30* which specified hours,
v ages and general conditions, including
the recognition 'Of the unions. At the
HÂ»me time and In the presence of the
ilayor" who signefl the written agree
ment as a witness, there was also a
tacit understanding, since, admitted,
that there should be a board of arbitra
tion, and this board v was provided for
in the written agreement and was to be
compoped of four men\ from each side,
and the Mayor was to cast. the deciding
vcte in case of a deadlock.
TACIT" AGREEMENT.
Unless a compromise is effected be
tTreen the Restaurant Keepers' Asso
ciation and the Cooks* and Waiters'
Union within the next twelve hours all
the leading eating-houses in this city
Tvill close to-night and will remain
closed until the differences between
the parties are settled.
The Cooks' Union and the Waiters'
Alliance have a certain agreement that
they want signed by the restaurant- i
keepers and the latter decline to affix
their Eig-rcatures because the terms do
not meet with their approval. Th#
present trouble has been brewing for
the last year and is now coming to- a
head.
Members of the Restaurant Keepers'
Association are determined to defeat
the unions and if necessary will keep
their places of business closed for a
month. This means hardship for the
public. The big restaurants cater to
many thousands of hur.gr>* people a t
day and if they close their doors there
will be suffering: and discontent. If
the restaurants close their doors home
cooking and cold lunches must be en
dured by thousands and a goodly num
ber will have to* avail themselves of
saloon free lunches to stay the pangs
of huugrer. The strike will throw many
thousands out of employment and this
v.ill be a sad Christmas season for j
many.
JIAYOR MAY ARBITRATE.
Mayor Schmitz will undoubtedly act
as arbitrator of the strike. He has
not been asked to intervene, but it is
almost a certainty that the city's chief
executive will take a hand in the dis
pute in order that the residents of this
city may rot puffer.
v Both sides have held meetings and
\s.re determined to fight each other to a
Vinish. The Waiters' Alliance has been
preparing for the strike for the last
six months and now that it has come
is\ ready to put up a hard battle. The
executive committee of the unions is
loth to make any statement in the
matter. A committee called upon M.
Johnson,* chairman of the executive
conmaittee of the Restaurant Keepers*
Association, yesterday for the purpose
of arranging a meeting with the pro
prietors. - The committee was Informed
by Mr. "Johnton that such a. meeting
was impossible, but that any communi
cation tivey might prepare would be
given immediate attention by the asso
ciation. \ Â¦

While the detectives were In Cooper's
establishment McSwegan. who Is em
ployed as a lineman in the department
of electricity,' drove, up In a wagon and
disposed of 400 poiinas of copper wire
for 539. In view of the fact that Cooper
had purchased such a large quantity
of stolen Government wire the officers
determined to investigate ; this latter
sale./ -
Superintendent" Hewitt, the City
Electrician, was sent for, but upon an
examination declared that the .wire
was riot city property. The superin
tendent of the Mutual Light and Pow
er Company was then called in and
stated that the wire was the property
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company. McSwegan at first denied
his â¢ guilt, but subsequently admitted
that in stringing wires for the city he
had come across a considerable num
ber of* dead lines and confiscated
them. /He is a married man and ow
ing to that fact it is understood that
the gas company will not prosecute.
Cooper and Farber. will be turned
over 'to the Federal officials for trial.
At the time of the exclusive publica
tion by The CalL of the fact that Un
cle Sam had been, made" the victim of
a bold ring of thieves, the military
authorities absolutely denied "all
knowledge of the matter, but subse
quent developments have shown the
'correctness 1 , of \ the report. Â¦'
SOLD "DEAD LINES."
Their investigation shows that Cor
poral Lewis, who was also stationed at
Goat Island, was sent over to this city
by Simard to negotiate for the sale of
the wire. Lewis enlisted the services
of Farber, who took a sample of the
wire to Cooper. The market value of
the wire is 60 cents a pound, but Coop
er would give no more than 10 cents.
The wire was turned over to him and
he recently sold it to the Great West
ern Foundry, 217 First street. The de
tectives found about 50,000 feet at the
latter, establishment, and the firm has
agreed not to dispose of it pending the
final disposition of the case. '
Cooper and Farber were taken into
custody and brought before the mili
tary authorities at the Presidio. Cor
poral Lewi3 was sent for, but denied
all knowledge of the affair, j Upon be
ing confronted with Cooper and Farber
he broke down and confessed. He
stated that the two men in custody
knew where the wire was coming from
and told him to bring all that he could
get- .* From checks found fn possession
of Cooper and Farber it was ascertained
that the Great Western Foundry had
paid Cooper $176 50 for the goods and
Lewis was paid 5153 4t> as his and Sim
ard's share* of . the proceeds. Lewis was
arrested and placed in the guardhouse.
LOCATE THE W1BE.
Chief of Police Wittman received a
communication yesterday morning from
Captain W. S. Overton of the Artillery
Corps, U. S. A., relative to the loss of
a large quantity of wire from Goat Is
land. The captain in his letter stated
that about October 24 he went on a
month's sick leave and Electrician
Sergeant Henry Simard was left in
charge of the torpedo station at Goat
Island. Simard had under him Sergeant
Hodgman of the Twenty-eighth Com
pany of Coast Artillery and three pri
vates. On October 28 the launch Brisk,
with the name "Joe Kane" painted on
her stern, Visited the island . and took
away 60,000, feet of . insulated copper
wire. Simard at. that time told Ser
geant Hodgman that the wire was to
be' used at the Presidio so. as to allay
all suspicion. On November 7 the same
launch again visited the torpedo sta
tion and 52,000 feet of wire. was placed
on board. Sergeant* Simard boarded
the boat on that occasion and has not
been seen since.
â¢' Upon receipt of the communication
Detectives Ryan and Taylor were im
mediately detailed on the case, and
with the assistance of Detective Pete
Lewin had cleared up the mystery sur
rounding the disposition of the plunder
and landed three of the guilty parties
behind the bars before 5 o'clock. The
officers were highly commended by
their superior officers for their clever
work. \
The magnitude of the theft of which
the three men in custody stand accused
and for which they will be prosecuted
by the Federal authorities is surprising,
as 'sufficient wire to string a single line
between this city and San Mateo was
carried away in a launch from Goat
Island under the eyes of those In
charge of the station. A peculiar fea
ture attending the investigation of the
case by the police was the discovery of
another theft of wire from the San
Francisco Gas and ; Electric Company
by one of the employes of the depart
ment of electricity of this city, and as
a result the name of Philip McSwegan
of 350 Fell street appears on the detinue
book at the City Prison.

General B, the handsome, smooth
coated St. r.ernard, was awarded the
prize for the best dog in San Francisco
County. He had a large field of com
petitors and the race for honors was a
hot ore. M. Coffey's Scotch collie Sir
Henry was declared the best dog en
tered from Sacramento County.
The banner dog from Santa Clara
County proved to be His Majesty of
Charlcombe, an Old English sheep dog
owned by the Charlcombe Kennels.
Irving Towrsend of Watsonville took
the prize for the best dog from Santa
Cruz and Monterey counties with his
Scotch collie Tyke.
A large crowd gathered around the
ring to witness the distribution of the
prizes by Mr. Stewart. Many handsome
cups and other valuable articles were
awarded the winners. A cheer went up
from the gathering when "Rags," the
Filipino dog:, went barking out of the.
ring under cover of the Stars andr
Stripes, his prize for being the only
naturalized Filipino dog in all the
world.
The dog, r-oultry and cat show at Me
chanics' Pavilion came to a close^ last
night after attracting an attendance
which thronged all the available space
in the big exhibition hall.
In every respect the exhibition was
the most successful of its kind ever
held in th? city. The directors and
patrons of the show are one and all
satisfied. The former feel highly elated
over the success of their efforts and are
already planning for next year.
The gTand closing event was the
Judging for the best dog in the show
and the banner crowd of the season
was on hand to watch the proceedings.
The lucky dog happened to be Minne
sota Joe, the superb pointer, many
times a prize winner, and the property
of Henry F. Ziegler of The Dalles,
Or. He wen from a large field and,
though there were some who did not
approve of the choice, still all admitted
the dog made a wonderful showing.
Against Minnesota Joe were pitted
two St. Bernards, John Rlpllnger's
English setter Elloree, which was the
reserve dog; two poodles, a Mexican
hairless dog, an Irish setter and a
Scotch collie. The judges were James
Cole of Kansas City and John X. de
Witt of this city. N. J. Stewart of San
Jose acted as the referee.
It took some time to decide on the
merits of the dog, as each was a win
ner in his class. Finally the two Judges
came to an agreement and awarded the
palm to Minnesota Joe. Both men are
fanciers of pointers, though no one can
say their fondness for this breed of
dogs influenced their decision. The
prize was an artistic silver cup donated
by the management of the St. Nicholas
Hotel.
ers, and as ShellmounC a 15 to 1 shot,
hit the stretch in front, it looked as
if he might win. Silver Fizz, though,
proved the better stayer and at the
close won easily. Invictus, at 30 to 1,
took the show. The winner received
steady support at 5 and 6 to 1.
Charley Henshall's Martinmas caught
the public fancy and was played down
to 2 to 1 favoritism to beat some fast
ones in the fifth event, a six-furlong
selling run. He ran a clever race,
though finishing no better than a close
third. Sherwood, a green boy, had the
mount on Sad Sam and gives promise
of becoming a rider. He got the erratic
Sam away well, kept him well In to
ward the rail and in the. most exciting
finish of the afternoon only lost to E.
M. Brattain by a nose in 1:13 flat.
Chandler rode the winner, which closed
at odds of 3% to 1. Bay Wonder could
not keep up, running a good fourth.
The final event, a mile a^d fifty yard
Ananias and Ebony raced off head
and head when the barrier was sprung
and It was apparent neither would
get a big chunk of the purse. On the
stretch turn Jack Martin, on Military
Man, ran into a beautiful pocket and
was compelled to wait for an opening.
Less than a furlong from the wire
he got out, but could not quite catch
Padua, and 8 to 1 chance, which was
rushed into the lead by "Bill" Waldo.
Willie, See handled Captain Forsee
with great care.
Martin also rode I O U, favorite
for the mile and fifty yard selling
event. The gelding is naturally a poor
breaker and got away from the bar
rier in such wretched form that he
had no chance. There were ten start-
A world of money was bet on the
maiden Ebony to win the 2-year-old
sprint at six furlongs. The big fellow,
which is a son of Hamilton II, reeled
off four furlongs in 47 1-2 seconds on
Friday and closed equal favorite with
Military Man.
MILITABY MAN POCKETED.
Fort Wayne, whose name revives
memories of E. J. Arnold & Co. of
get-rich-quick fame, started a 2 to 1
favorite for the opening sprint. Saintly,
which has been left at the post on one
or two occasions, had Hall up and the
Schreiber Jockey got him away. In fact,
he got the 10 to 1 shot away sailing
and was never headed. The first choice
closed strongly under Knapp's urging,
only to be beaten less than a length in
the fast time of 1:13. Quatre finished a
close third, quite an improvement over
her previous race.
In the interim, J. Booker, on Hora
tius, had shaken off Ishtar and gradu
ally opened up a gap of daylight be
tween the colt and the balance of the
bunch, scampered in the easiest imag
inable winner In 1:45 3-4. Six lengths
back of him Yellow Tail lead Divina
not quite a length for place honors. The
winner ran practically unbacked, the
price drifting from 5 to 12 to 1.
If the books made no money, then
they never will. Beginning With Fort
Wayne, a 2 to 1 choice, five other fa
vorites, Military Man, I. O. U. t Divina,
Martinmas, and El Oriente, all met de
feat The track was lightning fast and
fast time marked the running of the
different events.
Many even went further, for Jack
was hissed as he returned to the stand
after the. finish. .
D. Hall was. posted to ride the mare,
but from Inside information received at
the judges' stand, the Texas rider was
taken down shortly before post time
and Martin was substituted. Divina
carried 110 pounds and was extensively
plunged on by large and small bettors
alike. Of the other six starters, Yel
low Tail carried , the most backing.
While Martin came in for severe cen
sure for his handling of the favorite,
the misfortunes he met with were
plainly unavoidable. Ishtar and Hora
tius cut out the early running.
Before reaching the half mile ground
King on Yellow Tail cut Divina off, and
before Martin had the long-striding
mare straightened away he was again
cut off by Dugan astride Forest King,
losing several lengths. Martin next
moved up on the rail with his mount
and Just before swinging into the
stretch was once more cut off by For

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5.â Frederick
H. Rlndge c* this city received, word
to-day of a disastrous fire on his Mal
ibu ranch in Ventura County, on the
coast. The Malibu ranch is one of the
largest In Ventura County, and was
well-stocked and highly improved.
The ranch house, recently constructed
at a cost of $25,000, together with a
number of smaller outbuildings, were
destroyed. Two thousand cattle stam
peded, and it Is reported that many
were destroyed by the flames. Definite
figures as to the damage done cannot
be obtained here to-night, but esti
mates run from $100,000 to $150,000. A
tract thirty miles long was swept by
the flames. ; ' -^
The fire started in the brush and
grass several miles from the ranch and
because of the high wind that prevailed
yesterday along the . coast the flames
were driven along the coast for sev
eral miles, finally reaching the Malibu
ranch. All efforts to check the progress
of the fire were unavailing.
Mr. Rindge is absent from the city,
but his attorneys said to-day that de
tails of the disastrous fire are lacking.
From reports reccelved here, however,
it. appears that the ranch was ewept

â¢ BERKELEY, " Dec. ' 5.â Manager
Ezra Decoto of the University of Cal
ifornia received a telegram to-day
from Manager E. D. Barnard of the
University of. Minnesota promising to
play the California eleven on New
Year's day in San Francisco. The
Minnesota manager agreed to all the
terms proposed by the California
manager and now both sides can go
ahead with their^. preparations Â¦ with
the full assurance that there will be
a midwinter game.
Manager Decoto estimates that it
will cost at least $6000 to bring the
Eastern eleven but here and play it a
game. The game will have to draw,
that much money, and a good deal
more, probably, before California will
realize anything out of its venture.
However, Decoto thinks thegame will
be a drawing card and that there will
be a good round sum realized for the
fund that has been started for a new
football field on the university cam
pus. . ' '
This will have been the second
Eastern team that California has
brought to the coast.. In 1899,- when
the State University had the best team
in the history of California football,
the Carlisle Indians, who < were - that
year at their, best, came to the coast.
The game was played in San.Fran
cisco in the presence of an immense
crowd, the contest ending with a score
of 2 to 0 in favor of Carlisle.
The Minnesota eleven this year i3
the best that university has turned
out. It has ' won all but one ,'of its
games, having lost to the University
of Chicago. It played a 6 to 6 tie
with the University of Michigan,
which ranks among the foremost
elevens in the Middle ; West. There
will be twenty men in the squad that
Minnesota will bring to California.
None of their names are known', to
Manager Decoto. . N

the 'fair racket wlelders figured in some
exciting mixed doubles and singles
matches. Miss Jeannette Wright car
ried off the honors.. Her knowledge of
the game, is somewhat limited, but her
style is good and with a little practice
she should develop a first-class player.
Miss Wright beat Daniel Volkmann and
tied William" Volkmann.

and Sidney Smith proved too strong
for Miss Elsa Draper and O. Law. Miss
Draper, â¢ with Smith as a partner, took
a set rather easily from Miss Wright

In the afternoon many good practice
matches were played. The feature was
a doubles between Frank Stringham
and Sidney Salisbury and Herbert

were considered somewhat stronger
than their, opponents, but Schmidt and
Rolfe, by careful, steady play, man
aged to make a tie of the match. When
darkness put a stop to play, each had
won two sets and the fifth stood 4-4.
Another doubles match that was close
and exciting was between Dr. Noble

Germ Infected Air. . fljl
Malaria is not confined exclusively to the swamps v|ilM*M
and marshy regions of the country, but wherever there is
bad air this insidious foe to health is found. Poisonous I'wl^l â¢
vapors and gases from sewers, and the musty air of damp rS-eÂ»s^]
cellars are laden with the germs of this miserable disease, g^aS^i
which are breathed into the lungs and taken up by the 111^11 >-'
blood and transmitted to every part of the body. Then . m&MiM
you begin to feel out of sorts without ever suspecting the "y^ffiaJ
cause. No energy or appetite, dull headaches, sleepy and wf^^
tired and completely fagged out from the slightest exer- Lp '$imh
tioa, are some of the deplorable effects of this enfeebling H^r \ft
malady. As the disease progresses and the blood becomes \*
more deeply poisoned, boils and abscesses and dark or tiS^gjt&M â \
yellow spots appear upon the skin. When the poison is .^SJÂ«*r3Â£^afcJa
left to ferment and the microbes and germs to multiply in \â^T
the blood, Liver and Kidney troubles and other serious complications often
arise. As Malaria begins and develops in the blood, the treatment to be
Si , â^ effective must begin there too. S. S. S. destroys
/^-^ lO^ *k e germs and poisons and purifies the polluted

said he had- attempted to murder his
wife by stabbing her, will be vigorous

woman at first refused to enter, com
plaint against. her; husband,. but yes
terday, she 'appeared in Judge Mo
gan's â¢ court and caused some . surprise
by Â¦ voluntarily swearing he had tried
to k-Hl'her. The' hearing has been set
for to-morrow.
Amos Jones, proprietor of an El
lis-street apartment-house, was the
defendant in an assault and battery
case heard and continued by Judge
Mogan. The complainant was H.
Stecker, who manages a ladies' tail
oring shop at 459 Clementina street.
Mr. Stecker's story was to the ef
fect that he had . delivered to one of
Mr. Jones' roomers, a lady named
Gladys, a coat, and that after receiv
ing one installment of the price of the
garment he had been unable to find
Gladys to collect any more, although
he visited the hostelry in which'she
dwelt early, late and often every day.
He was obstructed by the elevator
man and other attaches of the house,
who evidently were ; not. in sympathy
with his quest, and when he called at
midnight Friday he was forcibly eject
ed from the place and severely pum
meled by the defendants
'For the defense it was urged that
Mr. Stecker was Ro persistent in his
pursuit of the elusive Gladys that he
annoyed the management of the hotel,
and that- he was not ejected until , he
had ' frequently been .requested to re
tire. - Furthermore, Mr. Jones assev
erated that in the process of escorting
Mr. Stecker to the sidewalk he had re
ceived sundry Bevere punches from the
fist of that person, . which fact, he
thought. . should be taken Into consid
eration by the Court. ' . ; ,
Gladys was called for, but did not
appear, . and the Jones ' forces smiled
significantly and apparently treated the
lady as a myth born and Â¦urturedin
the brain of the complaining ; wltness.
The case was taken under advisement:
All restaurateurs accused of selling
liquor without license were dismissed
yesterday by Judge Fritz, three test
cases having fallen through for lack
of evidence sufficient to warrant con
viction. . â¢ ;Â£Â£Â£â¢
There were about a score of these
cases on the docket, the defendants
being keepers of small restaurants in
the Latin and Slavonian quarters, and
each of them demanded a jury trial.
The prosecuting testimony in the test
cases was submitted by policemen,
who Â¦ had donned plain clothes and,
accompanied In ; each instance by a
woman, endeavored to purchase
drinks .from the defendants without
ordering, food at the same time. "'Â¦' In
each case the jury seemed to think
that a caterer should, be allowed to
supply his customers with liquid ap
petizers before they ; order solids.
At any rate, the prospect of secur
ing a single conviction appeared to
be so" remote that the. prosecuting at
torney suggested, dismissal of the en
tire bunch of Â¦complaints.
1 MaryH. Mann's saloon is no longer
a refuge for the blbulously inclined
youth . of Silver street and neighbor
hood. Mrs. Mann paid a fine of 520 yes
terday and solemnly promised Judge
Mogan that she will forever abstain
from dispensing Intoxicants to minors.
Her former dispensary is closed.
After several postponements the
final match of the Scottish bowling
tournament was played yesterday a/
ternoon at Golden Gate Park. J. C.
Moffatt carried off the honors and is
the champion. James Gray was his
opponent and he worked hard to win.
Moffatt was steadier at critical ' mo
ments and Â¦vt'on out by a small margin.
.. The ;"frlatch- was close from start to
finish and the outcome was in doubt
until -the ei\d. Both players were
rather nervous at the start, but this
soon wore off and some great bowling
was done toward the" end. The score
in Moffatt.'s favor was 21 to 18.
Some good practice matches were
played. J. C. Moffatt and A. Fore
man played a close game with M.
Crowe and Joseph Gray, the score be
ing 21. to 20.

Fireman "William Gernandt disap
pointed some of the wiseacres in Mo

ed in response to the bench warrant
issued for him the previous day. He
wasyout on $20, bail pending examina
tion on a charge of tolerating ill-treat
ment of his young daughter by her
mother, and when he failed to appear
at the appointed time it was freely
opined he had forfeited his bond and
left the. city. In of his
absence . on that occasion he yester
day'informed' thp court that ! he J was
compelled to be on duty at the engine

Gernandt's wife, a chronic invalid,
is. alleged to have abused her little
girl lay striking .her savagely with ; &
potato masher and' sticking the scis
sors points in her head while cutting
her hair. The: husband and father
pleads ignorance of the ill-treatment.
Six previous charges of petty larceny
have been resurrected and will be're
ferred to by Judge Mogan to-morrow
when he passes sentence on Lawrence
V. Hill, a hotel bellboy, who has been
convicted of having stolen an overcoat
belonging to A. W. Moore. Hill is about
23 years of age, and his punishment
will be - imprisonment in the ' County
Jail. Â«:f"
The parties will reappear in court
to-morrow and be Informed of what
the Judge thinks of their respective
sides or the case.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Flynn, her husband has been in the
habit of getting drunk twice a week,
and while influenced by Bacchus he
has regularly chastised her with a
broomstick, smiting her upon the
head and arms with the implement.
Mr. Flynn, on the other hand, swore
that he was never first to introduce
the broomstick as a medium of en
forcing domestic discipline, but while
defending himself from his helpmeet's
attacks he may have acidentally
"jabbed" her with the unmufflled end
of it. He cited one instance in which
Mrs. Flynn figured as deliberately
pouring hot tea upon his neck as he
sat awaiting his vesper- meal. Mrs.
Flynn acknowledged the scalding, but
averred it was accidental, as Mr.
Flynn, with the recklessness of intox
ication, had swung his arm and
struck the hand in which she clutched
the teapot.
A tale of marital discord was next
unfolded in Mogan's court; the prin
cipal narrators being Mrs. Frank
Flynn and her husband, who dwell in
infelicity at 8^ Federal street. Mr.
Flynn Is a longshoreman', and his
wife supervises his domestic establish
ment.

Such was the strained relationship
between Ferdinand and Irene when he
forced an entrance to her boudoir Fri
day night and importuned her to bury
the hatchet. She, haughtily declined to
participate in the proposed Interment,
and -in disappointed rage Ferdinand
struck here uoon the right eye, discol
oring that erstwhile bright organ, and
systematically proceeded- to. inflict fur
ther bodily injury,, when her cries at
tracted the attention of Miss Ellen
Cowen, occupying an adjoining apart
ment, who heroically flew to her aid.
Instead of staying the punitive fist of
Ferdinand, however, Miss Cowen re
ceived it on her face, and the enraged
athlete had both ladies literally "down
and out" before he ceased his attack.
Against the name of Ferdinand Rol
lender on the Police Court docket are
inscribed three separate charges. . Miss
Gre.ye accuses him of assault and bat
tery and disturbing the peace, and Miss
Cowen Is the complainant in another

Silvano Flores, a Mexican sea cook,
made his seventh consecutive appear
ance in the Police Court yesterday,
with his wife as complainant. She tes
tified through the agency of an inter
preter that her husband has .a pen
chant for celebrating his returna from
sea by loving her 'dearly a day or two
and then radically changing that mari
tal policy to one of cruelty and coer
cion. The specific charge against him
yesterday was threatening to kill her.
The defendant stood before the bench
and bombarded its occupant with flat
denials uttered in fractured English,
and while his wife was testifying he
frequently scowled at. her and said
something in his native patois.
Mr. Donaldson evaded the issue by
declaring he could get the best cit
izens ,of San Lorenzo to testify that
his character in that thriving town is
above reproach.
"Well, there will be room for them
here next Monday," said the court,
"until which date your case is con
tinued."
Stewart Donaldson of- San Lorenzo
went to an O'Farrell-street playhouse
Friday evening and disturbed the peace
to such an extent that a>policeman
was called in to remove him. W.hile
escorting Stewart to the exterior the
policeman discreetly "searched his
pistol pocket and was rewarded by
finding therein a fully loaded revolver.
So carrying a concealed weapon was
added to the charge of "drunk and
disorderly", originally intended" by Mr.
Donaldson's captor.
"What do you mean by raising a row
in a theater and carrying such a mur
derous looking arrangement as that?"
quoth Judge Mogan to Mr. Donaldson,
and pointing with censorious digit at
the big pistol.
"Weel, yer Honair," was the reply,
"I was a wee -bit fu\ an* didna ken
wheer I was or what I was daen*!"
"Hoot, mon!" retorted the court,
"you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
A combination of drunken man and
loaded revolver is bad at any time or
"place or under any circumstances, and
in a crowded playhouse it is positively
a public danger. I suppose if the act
ing on the stage â or stages, for you
must have seen more than one â had
not been satisfactory you would have
unllmbered your artillery and taken a
shot or two at the offending mummer
or mummers? You ought to be thank
ful that you were removed before your
appreciation of histrionic worth was
shocked."

Relief dogs were much in evidence
during the running of the open stake
yesterday at Ingleside Coursing Park.
Save for one or two short trials, every
course was a lengthy one and many
went well over the time limit
The day's feature was the defeat of
Full Moon by Little Plunger. Full
Moon ruled a strong favorite, five and

bunches that he would be returned a
winner. :
The dogs were slipped to a hare that
had speed and stamina and they were
in pursuit for nearly three minutes.

Mesdames Rose Dunn and A. Dondero
flatly and emphatically contradicted
each other's testimony yesterday morn
ing while Police Judge Fritz -was try-
Ing to get at the facts of the assault
case in which the ladies were princi
pals. Mrs. Dondero had Mrs. Dunn ar
rested on a charge of attacking her
with a deadly weapon and incidentally
informing her that she was "a dirty
dago." and also that she was "full of
vino," all of which Mrs. Dunn posi
tively denied, and supplemented the de
nial with the" accusation that Mrs. Don
dero had hissed uncomplimentary allu
sions to her nationality, she (Mrs.
Dunn) being a native of the Emerald
Isle.
The ladieB reside in neighborly pro
pinquity at Mason and Greenwich
streets, but the evidence showed there
had been nothing neighborly about
their social relationship. Mrs. Dondero
averred that Mrs. Dunn seldom or nev
er neglected opportunity to hurl Insult
ing epithets at the Dondero household,
and on more than one occasion carried
her antagonism to the extent of in
flicting bodily injury upon representa
tive members thereof.
"She struck me over the head with a
pistol." swore Mrs! Dondero, "and as
saulted me with a bag containing a
school slate. More than that, she hired
small boys to follow me and whistle
derisively."
"She called me a dirty old Irish
thing," was Mrs. Dunn's plea, "and I
never struck her except in self-de
fense."
As the casus belli was not made clear
and as the court was not perfectly sat
isfied with that phase of the prose
cuting testimony relating to the use of
the pistol, the case went over till next
week. Each side of the controversy
has a swarm of witnesses on hand, and
the vicinage of Mason and Greenwich
streets will be depopulated during the
next hearing.
street sweeper, who had been sen
tenced to six months for petty lar
ceny, had nled an appeal and fur
nished a bond and had taken advan
tage of his liberty to visit and utter
deadly threats against one of the wit
nesses who had appeared against him.
During the examination of MrrKeith
it was revealed that while he pursues
the humblest vocation that man .can
follow, he is fairly reveling in wealth,
having about $20,000 In bank and per
sonal property galore. The police al
lege that his street-sweeping act is
merely a '.'blind" for his real business
of "fencing," which means receiving
and disposing of goods which more
courageous practitioners of crime have
stolen. A quantity of jewelry, watches,
cutlery and other articles of which he
could give no satisfactory account
were found in the man's abode when
the police â¢ searched it for evidence in
the petty larceny case. â¢
Judge Cabaniss remanded the opu
lent Mr. Keith until Judge Conlan can

him. ,-,, vjvy

Mr. T. T. Rea. Palo Alto. Cal.
MR. REA Fays: "Before taking: up the
i Electro-Chemic treatment I was exam- j
j ined by seven doctors, and no two agreed Â¦
j exactly upon a diagnosis of my case. 1 !
I was naturally discouraged and went to
: the Electro T Chemic Institute, 118 Grant
\ avenue, San Francisco, for a thorough
X-Ray Examination. It was plain to me
that " the Electro-Chemic specialists
, knew their business, and I was so great-
l.ljr pleased with the examination which
i they gave me that I at once took up the
! Electro-Chemic treatment. My trouble i
! j.roved to be Constitutional,, Catarrh, j
; Probably every organ was more or less
: affected, but I felt the effects of the j
; catarrh mostly in my nose, throat, stom- i
I ach and heart, and my breathing was not
â¢ normal, ko no doubt my bronchial tubes '
and probably the lungs were consider- ,
! ably involved. \
\ 'From the very start of my. treatment \
I I began to improve In every manner. I i
' do not feel the effects of the catarrh at !
'. all now. and I am sure that the disease j
Â¦ has been thoroughly cured. I never lost
, r. day from my work while taking the
: Electro-Chemic treatment, and my cure .
1 has been accomplished at my home. The
Electro-Chemic apparatus with which
i my treatment was applied was loaned to
mo. and I was saved the expense of pur- i
chasing the instrument. This made the
: treatment cheap indeed, when the won-
derful results are considered. I feel It
my duty to recommend the Electro- i
Chemic treatment to all catarrhal suf- '
ferers. I do this out of gratitude to the
Electro-Chemic physicians, and with a i
desire to help others. T. T. REA,
"Palo Alto, California."

iA Bryson in Gold, absolutely the richest art picture ever used ft
for any purpose by a newspaper. i\
Admiration is a type of beauty essentially modern. The strong- U
est element of modernity of this study, however, is to be found in its gj
composition. There are styles in women as well as in everything: H
else. The type preferred to-day has not the same element of beauty if
which our forefathers most admired, or perhaps that will be admired t
by the coming generation. Almost every year brings a new type of c
the "Summer Girl" or the "Golf Girl," etc. The clothes, manner and |
. mode of dressing the hair contribute much to the creation of an im-
pression that there is an actual change constantly taking place in |
the form and features of the fair portion of the human race. It is [
possible that new thoughts, ideas and conditions have an influence I
upon the form. of the body and features and perhaps the color of the f
hair and eyes may be affected- Â¦ Â£
The type portrayed with so much grace and distinction bv Bry- I
son has the characteristic of up-to-date famininity. The refined type f
of beauty in the figure, the grace of movement suggested in her pose If
gj and the mingled expression of intelligence anj sweetness in her fea- 11
p tures, combined with the artistic arrangement of accessories, the f|
| H dash of color and the delicate flesh tints, make this a most beautiful r j
! tj] art study. f]

one of them being, a Junior, who had in

were caught and punished.
"On December,. 5, In accordance with
a recommendation by the Committee

who used dishonest methods in an ex

dismissal was published this afternoon
by James Suttqn, recorder of the fac

a university rule, to reveal the name
of the culprit. The notice reads as fol

published charge that the Agricultural
Bureau's cotton report had been pre
maturely announced to a selected few.
Officers of the New York Cotton Ex
change said that they had received no
tangible Information on which to acV
The matter had been called to their at
tention, but no one, it was announced,
presented any evidence to connect any
members of the exchange with the dis
honorable practice, such as is charged.
Probably the sentiment of the ex
change is best reflected by the state
ment made by Robert P. McDougal.
president of the New York Cotton Ex
change. He said:
"Nothing has been presented to the
exchange as yet on the charge that cer
tain of our members utilized informa
tion dishonorably obtained on the Gov
ernment cotton crop. The report that
there was a leakage from the Agricul
tural Bureau was current In this city
and in New Orleans on Monday and
Tuesday,- when it was generally stated
that the Government would show a
crop of less than 10.000,000 bales. Tele
grams to this effect were sent between
the two cities as ordinary cotton gos
sip is sent."
Samuel T. Hubbard, a former presi
dent of the exchange, who believed
there was a leakage of the report, said
he had no tangible evidence to present,
but he yas convinced from a variety of
reas<Â«nÂ«Â»that there had been a prior
publlcj&Jon of figures and that the In
formation had been used by certain
men. '

STUDENT CHEAT
Megaham some weeks ago had trou
ble with the school department, and it
is now believed that it was the first In
dication of his breaking down and that ;
afterward it aggravated his unfortu- ;
nate condition. He preferred charges
before the Board of Education against
Superintendent McClymonds, who he
imagined was discriminating against
him and not giving him the assistance
he required. He offered his resignation
to the board at that time, which, how
ever, was not accepted, and upon sug
gestion he took a leave of absence,
which had not yet expired. .Another
note to his brother-in-law found among
the papers in his pocket, which it Is be
lieved refers to this, says: "P. M. Fish
er," 576 Vernon street â Dear P. M.: All
my efforts to understand details of my
experience are useless, and my brain
whirls with a fierce power every time
It. I am worn out and my head is

OAKLAND, Dec. 5.â While in a state
of mental unbalance Ambrose Mega
ham, principal of the Peralta School in
this city, committed suicide some time
last night in a house in process of con
struction on Webster street, between
Twenty-first and Twenty-second, by
taking strychnine. His body was found
this morning by artisans employed in
building the house. -
Megaham had not been dead long
when discovered, for there was warmth
still in the body. In' one of the dead
man's pockets was found the following
note, written to his brother-in-law, P.
M. Fisher: "For P. M. Fisher, 576 Ver
non streetâ Help me to find my home.
Help me to find my dear ones." The
writing was straggling and not in his
usual style, and it is supposed was
written when his mind had so far gone
that he realized that he could not find
his way home. He lay on his face In
the unfinished house, and in both hands
were clutched some shavings.

Johnson Is a senior in the college of
mechanics and was about to graduate.
His home Is In Roseberg, Or. He Is 24
years old.
Johnson was found in his room at
7:30 o'clock this morning by Mrs. Rob
ert Melville, in whose home he" boarded.
She detected the odor of gas at that
hour, and suspecting that it came from
Johnson's room tried to arouse him.
There being no response, she opened
the door and found the young man
lying partly on the bed and partly on
the floor. Hastily dragging the uncon
scious form out of the reeking room.
Mrs. Melville summoned Dr. E. Z. El
lis. Later Drs. H. N. Rowell and F. H.
Paine were called In to assist. The doc
tors said that if Johnson had remained
in the room a few minutes longer he
would have been beyond aid.
The gas that brought Johnson near to
death came from a gas stove. It is
supposed that he got up early this
morning and and after lighting the
stove went back to bed, because he
would not have been alive if the gas
had been escaping all night. While
dozing again the light must have been
put out in some way, and Johnson
realizing that the gas was escaping,
arose and went toward the window,
was overcome before he reached It and
fell in the position in which he was
found.
George S. Johnson, a student at the
University of California. Inhaled a
large, quantity of gas in his room at
1S11 Prince street this morning and now
lies unconscious, with the chances for
life and death about even. Three phy
sicians have been working on him all
day in an endeavor to keep going the
spark of life, and at a late hour to
night the patient was still unconscious,
though his condition was somewhat im
proved. ; i-';

"To the Citizens of Oakland: While
I appreciate the feeling of kindness
and generosity that has prompted the
friends of my son James to start a
subscription for the purpose of paying
off the mortgage on my home, I must
decline to accept any such subscrip
tion. I do this in view of the fact
that my son James, in connection with
rny other children, have left me amply
provided for. However, I am natural
ly anxious to have my son's murderer
apprehended, and if the citizens whose
interests he was protecting at the time
he met his death, desire to provide a
fund to be offered as a reward to be
paid to the person or persons who ap
prehend the murderer, they will be do
ing that which I am unable to do, and
for which I and my family will be ex
tremely grateful.

capture of the murderer of her son
thsji she is for her own financial ag
graridizement. As an incentive to Kin
lry's capture she" wishes the money the
citizens desire to present to her of
fered as a reward for the murderer's
apprehension. She has written the fol

First Battalion of Artillery reported
during the week at Battery Slauughter,
Presidio, for instruction at the eight
inch guns. Lieutenant Garber, U. S. A.,
who is acting instructor of the bat
talion, thoroughly explained the mech
anism of gun and r carriage,,the various
kinds of projectiles and powder used,
the chart, azimuth instrument and cor
rection tables. The "non-coms" were
then drilled in the manual of the piece
for two hours and dismissed.
Lieutenant F. S. Emmal has been
recommended for promotion to captain
and assistant surgeon of the battalion.
"Regimental commanders should pre
scribe both the theoretical and the
practical instructions for their regi
ments and Insure their uniformity in
the several companies. To â¢ that end
they should require their field officers
to visit the companies frequently for
the purpose of instruction. Brigade
commanders should visit each unit of
their commands, either personally or by
staff, at least once a year. It Is noted
with regret that, these essentials have
been generally omitted and attempts
made to supply their omissions during
encampments. The work of a year can
not be crowded Into a week of camp.'
Much can be accomplished in that time,
but much more can be accomplished if
officers and men are properly instructed
In the armories during the year."
During November twenty-three en
listed men have been discharged from
the service of the State out of , the Fifth
Infantry, sixteen on account of re
moval, six at expiration of term of en
listment and one for the good of the
service.
The school of instruction . for the of
fleers of the Naval Militia at this port
was opened on; board the "Marion last
week, with Lieutenant J. T.. McMillan,
U. S. N., of the'hydrographic office as
instructor. There will be instruction
every Monday and Thursday until each
officer becomes; a proficient navigator.
Arrangements J^ave been completed
for the Naval Militia clambake, to be
held at ! California City December - 20.
The^ Marion's steam launch will a tow, a
line of cutters with men of the two "di
visions in them to the point of destina
tion.
The officers and "non-coms" of the
COMMANDERS' OMISSIONS.
Another evidence of dilatorlness In
the National Guard is made apparent
in an order recently issued from head
quarters In Sacramento. It follows:
"The attention of all commanding
officers, and also all officers of the de
partment of rifle practice is called to
the fact that, with the exception of
the report for Troop B, cavalry, all
reports of target practice for the pres
ent year are now delinquent so far as
their receipt by the Inspector of gen
eral rifle practice is concerned."
At various times in the last two years
orders issued from the various head
quarters have been sent out in any
style and on all sizes of paper, and as
this practice has been commented upon
adversely orders have been issued that
hereafter all orders must be issued on
paper 5x7% inches. As soon as the same
can be obtained from the War Depart
ment at "Washington, D. C, files of a
suitable size for filing letters will be
issued to the different organizatolns.
The guard of the State has been or
dered to change the color, of chevrons
and trouser stripes from light blue to
white.
The division commander has come to
the conclusion that all is not as it
should be In the guard, for In a recent
order he says:
"For the lack of uniformity and in
struction given the men company com
manders are not alone responsible. It
is the duty of field officers to frequent
ly visit the companies under their
charge and see that they are given
complete and uniform instruction in
everything that the drill regulations
prescribe, not only the usual amount
of arms and company movements, but
bayonet exercise, guard and outpost
duty and extended order. A field of
ficer's responsibility is not limited to
the period of encampment or of assem
blies for parade. It extends through
out the year for the instruction of both
officers and men.
DUJLTOBY OFFICERS.
Another step In the direction of re
deeming the National Guard of Cali
fornia has been taken. It Is the call
ing for a meeting In the Assembly
Hall of the Mills building at 2 o'clock
on the afternoon of Thursday, Decem
ber 17, of brigade, regimental and
other commanding officers for the
purpose of discussing matters of In
terest to the organization and secur
ing uniformity of instruction and care
of property, to the end that needed
improvements may be made and that
all organizations brought to a degree
of efficiency.
United States Inspector Colonel W'll
helm and Colonel Bangham, assistant
adjutant general, visited the United
States arsenal at Benlcia last week
and there obtained Information to the
effect that during the current week
all organizations of the National
Guard in the State, will be provided
with Krag-Jorgenson rifles to replace
the Springflelds previously Issued.
This will be on the basis of fifty to all
companies or organizations except ar
tillery, which will be allowed seventy
for each battery. When this arm is
issued the commanding officers will
be Instructed to the effect that the
new rifles will have to be cared for
differently from the Springflelds and
that they will inspect or have them
inspected at least once a month, and
further that the weapon will not stand
the rough usage that is often given to
the Springfield. The arm is more ef
fective, requiring more attention.
The commanding officer of each
company of infantry, battery of ar
tillery and troop of cavalry has been
ordered to make immediate requisi
tion direct upon the quartermaster
general for not less than fifty nor
more than sixty dress coats ami caps,
except the artillery, which will be
allowed seventy for each battery.
Commanding officers of the Signal
Corps and Sanitary Corps will make
requisition for caps and coats neces
sary for the number of the men of
their detachments, and regimental
commanderji and the commanding of
ficer of the battalion of artillery will
make requisition for the necessary
number for non-commisioned staff
and bands of their commands. If
there are more than sixty men in an
organization except the artfllery some
men will be shy new caps new
coats.
In the case of Mrs. Ludmiller Bel
mont, who died on October 28, a verdict
of natural causes was returned.
The same Jury blamed R. C. Hares,
a helper in the United States Mint, who
was killed on October 27 in an elevator
accident. The verdict reads: "And we,
the undersigned jurymen, find that the
above R. C. Hares came to his death
through accident by running the ele
vator in U. S. Mint through careless
ness by himself." ":>â¢''.
Verdicts of accident were returned In
the cases of F. II. Knowlton, gas suf
focation, October 27, and Annie Mc-
Nab, who was suffocated with him.
In the case of Edgar Trefts. killed on
October 2S, the verdict reads: "And
we, the jury, find that same was caused
by accident by trying to Jump on the
car of the United Railroads while car
was in full motion on Ellis street, be
low Webster."
A verdict of suicide was rendered In
the case of Gustaf Lofgren, who shot
himself through the head last Friday.
Daniel Sheehan, an unfortunate la
borer, 62 â¢ years old, who was killed
last Thursday by a cave In a sewer on
China avenue, between London ami
Paris streets, was blamed by a Coro
ner's jury yesterday for his own death.
After reciting the circumstances the
verdict goes on to say: "And we, the
jury, find that said Daniel Sheehan
came to his death by accident by not
properly supporting the excavation on
which he was working."
Sheehan, with several other laborers,
was digsinc: a trench preparatory to
the construction of a sewer, and the
bank caved in upon them, burying
them to the hips. All were speedily ex
tricated without material injury, but
the mass of earth had fallen upon
Sheehan in such a way as to fracture
his spine.
It appears that the trench was being
dug on the ground that had been-fllled
in, and the soil was therefore very
loose, a fact unknown to the workmen
at the* time.

petition with the ctvlltan mechanics
whose wages run from $2 50 to $6 per day of
eight hours while the soldiers receive 916 eo
per month, with an additional 50 cents addtd
per day for the caroenter work, making h!a
pay for mechanical work a little more than 91
a day.
The following resolution relative to
the employment of soldiers as.carpen
ters was adopted:
The Labor Council at its meeting
last Friday night elected B. Benham
and A. C. Rose to represent the coun
cil at the State Federation convention
to be held In Fresno shortly.
The paper-box makers lost their
strike and have returned to work on

United States District Attorney Wood
worth yesterday filed complaint ia the
United States Circuit Court on behalf
of the United States of America
against the New York Dredging Com
pany. John MeMullen and R. Percy
Wright to recover $37,333 02 damages
alleged to have been sustained by the
Government by reason of the failure of
the defendants to comply with the
terms of a contract dated October 25.
1897, to dredge the channel' in front- of
the United States naval station at Port
Royal, S. C. .
The complaint alleges that 'the con
tract price at which the ' work was
awarded to \ the defendants - wÂ«i
$57,333 02, but that by reason of their
failure to undertake the work the Gov
ernment was obliged to pay $25,333 02
additional. It therefore demands this
sum, plus $31,750 as liquidated damages,
making the total of $37,338 02.
The management of the case has
been placed in the hands of First As
sistant United States District Attorney
Edward J. Banning.
Government Demands .f 57,338 02

leged Breach of Contract. . . r Â¦

arrivals from Oregon . and were purchasing
just enough for immediate requirements. River
Bur-banks continued dull, but holders were
firm -in their views and. were not Inclined to
force sales. Two cars of Sweet Potatoes came
in from Merced and sold off ! well at the fa
malliar quotation. Onlwis were In ample sup

freÂ«ly and choice lots me't with ready vale at
maintained prices. 1 1 The market was still over
loaded with poor stock." which dragged at un-
Eteady rates. Tomatoes were weak owing to
the cool weather and large lines of poor qual
ity offerings from across the bay were offering
below th* quotations, but found few buyers.
Prices of the other vegetables had no quotable
variance and supplies of all descriptions were
well up to - requirements. The market was
overstocked with Marrowfat and Hubbard

CHICAGO, Dec. 5.â The fact that cables did
not respond to the advance here yesterday
caused an easier tone In Â¦ wheat at the start
and opening sales on March â¢ were unchanged
to Â«fec lower at 82% Â®S2%c .There was a fair
scattered demand early, but offerings were
more than sufficient to meet the wants and
after Belling at 82%@S2%c May gradually de
clined. Local longs sold freely throughout the
entire session and there, was nothing In the
way of news to stimulate any large buying
movement. With the ezceDtion of the July
option, which was firm on continued dry weath
er In the winter wheat section, the market
closed weak, with May %c lower at S2 1 , 8 c.
after selling at 82Â©82Vfcc.
Expectations of heavy deliveries of December
contract caused liberal liquidation of that op
tion In the corn pit and the market weakened
under the pressure to sell.- The weakness .in
wheat also had a depressing - influence. May
closed at 43VbC. > Â¦ â¢ ' -
Â¦ - The name conditions that covered wheat and
corn prevailed in oatÂ« and* the- market rul^d
weak. May closed at 36VÂ»c. -â¢Â¦-â.
Liberal receipts of hogs and renewed talk of
enormous receipts for next week caused liqui
dation in provision* The selling was largely
by packers. Shorts were the best buyers, but
there was a scattered demand from other
sources -that held the market steady at the
gain. January pork closed 17"v4c lower; lard
and ribs were each 7%c lower. - "
The leading futures ranged as follows:
