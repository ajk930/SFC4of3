P OLSOM, July 29.â At 9
./^V o'clock to-night a telephone
message was received at the prison
from Deputy Sheriff Bosquit at
Placerville, saying that he had re
ceived word from his father,
Sheriff Bosquit, that eight of the
convicts had been located at Black
Hawk Canyon, and that three of
the convicts, including Seavis, the
colored man, were at Pilot Hill.
The message also stated that
scouts had been thrown out from
the posse.
-Â¦ â¢ Shortly after the above message
arrived a telephone message was
received here from Harry Wilkiri-
ySOLSOM, July. 29. â The
jH startling news was received
#< * here to-night that a consid
erable number of ex-convicts have
gathered in the region where the
murderous fugitives from the
penitentiary are supposed to be
hiding, and are supplying .the
runaway jailbirds with food and
ammunition.^- 'Â¦;
It is related from an authorita

"were at one time imprisoned here

secretly being made to apprehend

It is not doubted here that the
convicts have received some aid
already, because, with scant pro
visions and very little ammunition
at the time of their rapid depart
ure from Pilot Hill, they have
succeeded in , keeping well under
cover. Had they been dependent
solely upon the food they pos
sessed at' that time they" would
surely have raided a farmhouse or
sought by some means to replenish
their inadequate store.

progress by the convicts impos
sible, as the advance through the
brush is wearisome and slow. One
of the convicts is known to be sick
and was an additional drag up to
the time the party was lost
sight of.
The search is conducted by day
light almost entirely. Thus far it
has been unproductive of results,
but there seems no other way to
conduct the campaign. A small
guard is stationed in every village.
The different detacHments in pur
suit of the jailbreakers communi
cate with each other thrice daily,
that the chase may progress
smoothly.
Sheriff Keena left for Chinese
Camp at 10 o'clock this morning
on a still hunt, with a posse of
twelve men. It was thought that
the convicts, being addicted to the
use of opium and familiar with the
locality, might make for the dig
gings, in order to receive a supply
of the baneful drug. Nothing new
was discovered, however, and
Sheriff Keena will now work
toward the north.

CONVICTS SURROUNDED.
The officers congregated at this
point are convinced that the entire
eleven fugitives are surrounded,
and that a cautious tightening of
the cordon will soon reveal their
hiding places. Three of the con :
victs have been seen near-Conl, a.
*hort distance from here, and have
been pursued by troops.
George M. Brown, who lives
on the Spanish Dry Diggings,
twelve miles from Cool, has just
appeared here with information
that three convicts passed by his
house at 2 o'clock this morning.
He hailed them, thinking they
were neighbors. The convicts
swung about, leveled their rifles,
conversed among themselves for
a few moments and then fled to
the brush.

Rumors of the visit of the con
victs are flying from iip to lip
throughout the county. The head

of a house or two and a farm.

The identity of the convict who
was killed in the affray at Pilot

now disputed. It was Convict Al

years' sentence. He was drawn
into the plot at the last moment,
according to the statements made
by some of the convicts to-day in
the prison. It was stated to War

talking of the time when he would
be set at liberty.

The statement made by Convict
Woods to Guard Klenzendorf,
when the latter was a prisoner of
the convicts on theirway to Pilot
Hill, which was published in The
Call to-day, is looked upon as be
ing very close to the truth. The
plot was undoubtedly the work of
the thirteen men who broke from
the prison, and Convict Al Myers,
who failed to get away, was also
one of the band. That a general
prison delivery was planned is
not thought of here as ever having
anv existence.
DENIAL BY CONVICTS.
Warden Wilkinson and Dis
trict Attorney Seymour of Sacra
mento County have questioned a
number of the convicts, but they
all deny that they knew of the ex
istence of the plot to escape. Some
of them said that if they had been
in the. plot they would not be in
the prison to-day, which is a good
proof that the plan was confined
to the men who escaped and per

PIQUA, Ohio, July 29.â An attorney
Is here looking for evidence In
the estate of the late E. L. Camp
bell of San Francisco, whose body
was taken from a Panhandle
train here on May 14. The attorney's
mission is to lÂ»arn what effects of Camp
bell's were taken from the train with
him and what was found in his berth and
returned by the trainmen.
The widow, Mrs. Campbell, believes that
her husband was robbed. The inventory
of his effects show that two pins, one a
diamond and the other an emerald, each
valued at $250. are missing. That a con
siderable amount of money was also
taken is believed. Â¦',
At the time of his death Campbell was
on his way to Minneapolis, en route home
from New York, where he settle/1 a $50,000
case. It is known that he received his
fee, which was a large one. and that a
portion of it was deposited In New York,
to be placed to his credit in Minneapolis.
It is believed that this jum was $750.
From what is known of Campbell's hab
its by his relatives It la believed that he
could not have had less than $200 or $300
on his person when on the train.
Only $45 .was found on the body, his
gold watch and chain being afterward
found in the, berth Campbell occupied.
Neither the diamond nor the emerald pin
was found. This, coupled with the fact
that the death of Campbell was not re
ported by the Pullman porter until Bomo
time after its discovery, strengthens the
belief of the relatives that hewas robbed.
The attorney, who refuses to give his
name, will go to Cincinnati, Pittsburg and
New York In search of further evidence.
In the event of sufficient evidence being
discovered a suit will be brought against
the Pullman Company to recover' the
missing money and valuables.
J. S. Spillman, who was named executor
of ' E. L. Campbell's estate by the will
left by the dead man,. said yesterday that
he did not believe any robbery was com
mitted. When Campbell's death was first
made known in this city it was suspected
that he had been roWbed of a large sum
of money. Subsequent investigation, said
Spillman, convinced him that no robbery
had taken place, as the papers of the de
ceased showed that he did not have much
money with him when he died. Spillman
professed himself in ignorance of any
new evidence In possession of Mrs. Camp
bell that would tend to support the rob
bery , theory. . *

ROME, July 29.â There has been no
change in the attitude of the several fac
tions in the Sacred College regarding the
various candidates for the papacy. The
position of the foreign Cardinals Is clearer
than that of the Italian members of the
college.
The French Cardinals met to-day, but
failed to agree upon united action. Two
of them are opposed to the candidacy of
Cardinal Rampolla, two support It and
two are wavering. The Austrian, Hun
garian and German Cardinals number
seven and they all support Cardinal Sera
fino Vannutelli. The four Spanish Cardi
nals are in favor of Cardinal Rampolla.
Cardinal Gibbons, of Balti
more, and Cardinal IÂ«ogue. Archbishop of
Armach, Ireland, are against Cardinal
RanWnlla.
The session of Cardinals to-day occupied
only fifteen minutes. One innovation
noted was the Introduction of a buffet
with Ice water and vermouth.
Cardinal" Oreglia distributed voting
papers for the conclave. He explained th$
manner in which the ballots are to be
used. A vote will be taken at 1 o'clock
each morning. At the afternoon sessions
Cardinals desiring to change their votes
may do so, the others casting blank votes.
This process is designated as "accession,"
and its practical. effect Is that two ballots
will be taken daily.
For a long time after the meeting the
Cardinals remained in groups discussing
various Questions.
CONCLAVE WILL BE SHORT.
Tho impression x gains ground that the
conclave will be short. It- will sopn be
evident whether or not It will be possible
to elect Cardinal Rampolla. If it Is shown
that he cannot be elected, It will not be
difficult to concentrate on a neutral can
didate. One guess is as good as another
concerning who the neutral candidate
may be, for the Cardinals themselves
are without any fixed idea.
After the meeting Cardinal Oreglia re
'questedthe Cardinals to visit their cells
and be prepared at to-morrow's meeting
to present any complaint which they may
have.
Superstitious people hero find an omen
in the fact that Cardinal Rampolla drew
apartment No; 58. which In the book of
the lottery stands for Pope, and, conse
quently they- come to the conclusion that
fato has marked hilm to be the next PopVÂ».

Should' all of the sixty-two Cardinals
now in Rome enter the conclave it will be
the most numerously attended in history.
The conclave which elected Pope. Leo was
attended by sixty-one Cardinals. In tho
past. Popes have been elected by conclave
containing as low as nine. t
The ecclesiastics who are to watch the
sliding doors which will be the only
means of communication between the
conclave and the outside world have been
requested to be. present at the Vatican
Friday afternoonto assume their duties.
The sliding doors will be opened only be
tween 9 and 11:30 o'clock in the morning
and between 5 and 7 o'clock in the even
ing. At all other times they will be
locked.
CARDINAL LOGUE 'S VIEWS.
" Cardinal Logue, Archbishop of Armagh/
had an Interview to-day with Cardinal
Gibbons. When asked what he thought
of the objections frequently mentioned
against Cardinal Gottl being elected Pope,
on the ground that his being a member
of a religious order would prevent him
dealing In a broad spirit with Catholic
problems in America and Great Britain,
Cardinal Logue said:
It is absurd. Cardinal Gottl was formerly
an internuncio and has mixed with the reprt
sentatlves of the various powers. He knows
the prevailing conditions as well as anybody
Just because he is a Carmelite it does not fol
low that he is narrow minded. Moreover, It Is
unreasonable to attribute too much weight to
the personality of the new Pope. International
matters and Internal policy are now almost in
variably settled by a committee of Cardinals
who certainly, under the late Pope Leo, have
directed their departments Just as much as the
heads of departments of a civil Kovernment di
rect their departments. But. whoever may be
Pope. -it is not likely that he will attempt to
make any changes in policy without belnn
10 ta Â£. e advice of those committees
which have hitherto directed the policy of the
Vatican. .

Â¦LOWELL," Mass., July 29.â Two small
gunpowder magazines situated in the very
midst of the humble residences of fifty
mill operatives exploded to-day with a
frightful concussion and the resultant
wave of death cut off the lives of more
than a score of human beings and In
jured nearly fifty others. A half dozen
men who were loading kegs of powder
from one of the magazines were blown
to pieces; four boys 200 yards away were
killed by the force of the explosion and
fourteen frame houses within a radius' of
400 yards went down as if they' had been
built of cards. Seven of these houses im
mediately caught fire, probably from the
kitchen stoves, and were consumed. At
least three persons were caught in the
ruins arid burned to death, while seven
or eight others who were rescued died
subsequently of their Injuries.
It is estimated that seventy separate
pieces of property, including those al
ready mentioned, were destroyed, while
the force. of the explosion wrecked win
dows five or 6ix miles distant and its
thunder could be beard distinctly more
than fifty miles way.

SURROUNDED BY DWELLINGS.
The magazines were the property of the
United States Cartridge Company of this
city, but formerly were situated more
than a mile from the factory itself. They
were built of brick, about ten feet high
with a rounded roof of corrugated Iron.
They were constructed forty years ago In
what was then a broad, open field on the
banks of the Concord River. During the
last decade small wooden dwellings haye
gradually sprung up in the vicinity,
crowding nearer and nearer with fancied
security to tbe innocent looking little
buildings until they almost completely
surrounded them, except on the river side,
the nearest house scarcely fifty feet
away.
One of the magazines was just within
the roadside fence, while the other was
about a hundred feet behind it, near the
banks of the river. Both magazines or
dinarily contained two or three tons of
gunpowder in tin kegs, each keg being
about eighteen inches high and a foot in
diameter. The company for some time
has been desirous of strengthening* the
floor of the magazines nearest the street
and this morning eight men, three of
them employes were sent there with three
large express teams to take out the pow
der and mend the floor. Two of the
wagons had been loaded and the other
was almost full when the explosion oc
curred.
FOREMAN'S FATAL MISTAKE.
It was a long time before the actual
cause of the explosion was ascertained.
It was first thought that every one with
in a radius of fifty feet of the magazines
had been killed, but later It was found
that Clarendon Goodwin, the foreman of
the men who were loading the powder
on tl:Â« teams, had survived, together with
one <y his assistants, Amadee Boulanger.
Boulanger said that the men went down
to the magazine nearest the street to fix
the floor and after the wagons had been
loaded with tbe powder which was In the
magazine it was discovered that a can of
nitro glycerine, which was stored in the
magazine, was leaking. Goodwin picked
up what he thought was a Jug of water
and began pouring it on the nitro- glyc
erine with- the Idea of diluting it and
washing It up. As soon as the fluid from
the Jug struck the floor he found that it
was nitric acid. The floor at once be
gan to smoke and when the men saw it
they rushed from the building, but had
not gone ten feet when the explosion oc
curred.
This magazine, therefore, was the first
to go up, followed by the gunpowder in
the three wagons and, some seconds later,
by the second magazine.
To those who heard the crash it seem
ed as if there, were two distinct explo
sions, with a continuous roar between
them. There are, however, five holes in
the ground, which seems to clearly Indi
cate five explosions.
The entire catastrophe hardly occupied
the space of five seconds, but in that
time the surrounding property was swept
as if a small volcano had broken forth
In its midst.
FLAMES SPREAD RAPIDLY.
For several minutes afterward the air
Â¦was completely filled by smoke and dust,
illuminated by the glare from the already
burning houses. The work of rescue at
once began, but in many cases the flames
had already gained full sway over the
crumbled ruins, and several persons were
burned to death before the debris which
covered them could be removed.
The property Is situated Just over the
Lowell line in Tewkesbury, but the Low
ell fire department 1 did noble work in
carlns for the injured. Before a stream
of water started from the engines nearly
forty persons were taken to the hospitals,
while many more whose injuries' were,

HONOLULU, July 29.â The proceedings
in the Supreme Court to-day In the dis
barment cases of Attorneys George A.
Davis and J. A. Magoon assumed an ex
citing and sensational phase at one stage
and hostilities in open court were im
minent. Attorney General Andrews has
prosecuted the charges against the de
fendants with all the vigor at his com
mand and as a consequence has created
some personal enmities. The expectation
of the public* at large has been that seri
ous trouble would develop at the trial.
Davis Is a man of forceful, aggressive
character and he resented the attltud? of
Andrews, who claimed that thfi,dwin-J!ing
of the fortune of the aged and unfortun
ate John Sumner from $110,000 to $30,000
within a few months could be readily
traced to the avarice and unprofessional
conduct of a number of the attorneys en
gaged in defending and opposing his in
terests. The feeling ran so high. to-day
between Davis and Andrews that pistol
talk was Indulged In and Intimations
made of the possibility of settling the
differences of the men outside of the
court room. Happily, however, no oppor
tunity was allowed for a breach of the
peace, but the friends of both gentlemen
are greatly. co%:erned over the future.
The case of Attorney Magoon was sub

PHOENIX. Ariz., July 23.â The most
distastroua flre . that Phoenix â¢ has ex
perienced In a decade broke out at about
2:30 this morning and raged until 6 a. m.
It was practically confined to the dry
goods store of the Alkire. Company and
the plumbing establishment of D. H.Bur
tis. The two stores were situated on
Washington street In the middle of a solid
business block. Both were one-story
buildings, while the surrounding proper
ties are all two-story brick. The store
and stocks were completely destroyed, the
total loss being estimated at $100,000. The
floor to Alkire's did not burn through and
a portion of the reserve stock in the base
ment will be saved unless ruined by
water.
The Alkire stock was estimated at
nearly $70,000, but well insured. Burtls*
stock was valued at $13,000, one-third In
sured. The buildings were worth $20,000.
Insurance unknown. The flre originated
in the back of Burtls* store, caused pre
sumably by spontaneous combustion, as a
quantity of oils, and cotton waste were In
the buildings. Only by the prompt work
of the firemen were the Elllgson block on
the east and the Cotton block on the .west
saved from destruction.. A slight loss was
sustained by tenants by damage from

The girl is well developed and would
easily pass for 16. She is described as a
handsome blonde and only'arrlved In this
city a month ago from Italy, where she
had been studying in one of the foremost
colleges of that country. Boragni is
nearly distracted with grief and spent the
night in searching for some clew to her
whereabouts. He stated that his daugh
ter is attending a dressmaking Institu
tion on Market street and during the last
three days he accompanied her to' and
from that place. Yesterday morning the
girl stated that she was a*ble to find her
way without his assistance and started
off unattended:
The grief-stricken father believes his
daughter inadvertently boarded a car of
some other line than the one on which
she should have come home and was car
ried out Into the suburbs. As she speaks
nothing but Italian. It Is possible that she
vainly tried to find her way home or fell
into the hands of unscrupulous persons,
who have decoyed her away. Captain
Martin detailed detectives on the case
and the patrolmen have been Instructed
to keep a close lookout for the child. -At
the time of disappearance she wore a
light brown drees and a white straw hat.
P. Boragnl, a well known wine mer
chant at 1846 Union street, reported to
Captain of Detectives Martin last night
that his 14- year-old daughter, Assunta,
had not returned home from school and
he feared that, owing to the fact that
she is entirely unfamiliar with the Eng
lish language, she was wandering aim
lessly about the streets. ,

There Is a deal of comment concerning
the grand arch or court of honor now in
course of construction at the intersection
of Market, Third and Kearny streets. Re
ports that work would be suspended and
plans changed were caused by a con
ference of the builders and members of
the Board ot Public Works. Practical
men In charge of the work assert that the
steel cables holding the platform over
Market street are capable of sustaining
a much greater strain than will be
placed upon them. Supervisor Horace
Wilson, chairman of the Arch Committee,
reports that the Board of Public Works
acted quite in line with official duty In
making Inquiry concerning the structure.

B1SBEE. Ariz.. July 29.-A dispatch
from Bowie brings news of an apparently
cold-blooded murder committed in the
heart of the San Simon mountains, not
Jar from that town. The body of Frank
CaJdwell, a miner and prospector, was
found yesterday in a secluded spot in the
mountains l-y two prospectors, -who at
once reported it to the authorities at
Bowie. Coroner J. H. Tevis summoned a
jury and visited thÂ© scene. They found
a great r^!e in the back of Caldwell's
head made by a bullet from a rifle. The
man had evidently been dead several
days, as the body was beginning to de
compose. There was a bitter feud be
tween James Gould and his friends and
Caldwell and his friends, and Gould has
boasted many times that he would some
day put Oaldwell under the ground. Gould
always carried a rifle of the same cali
l*T as the tn ! let which was found lodged
in the back of Caldwell's head. The spot
was an ideal one to shoot a man from
ambush and it ,*s believed Caldwell was
killed In this way.
The coroner's jury took Into considera
tion ail of these facts and In their verdict
found that Caldwell had met his death at
the hands of Gould. The latter has not
been eeen in the vicinity of Bowie since
the crime was committed, but cowboys
coming up from the line country report
that they saw on Saturday a man of his
description riding south, who is believed
to have been Gould headed for the line.
Caldwell was last seen on Friday. He
Â¦was armed when murdered and the fact
that neither his six -shooter nor rifle had
l>een discharged gives color to the sup
position that he was shot by Gould from
ambush He was quick with a gun and
would hardly have permitted such a bit
ter enemy to get the drop on him. Gould
is described as a one-armed man who
ought to be easily identified for that
reason. Officers all along the line are on
.he lookout for him and unless he has
already succeeded in crossing Into Mexico
his capture seems certain.

FRESNO, July 29.-FredT E. O'Brien,
Deputy Coroner under Dr. A. B. Cowan,
has disappeared and the police and
Sheriff's office are both making strenuous
efforts to find him at the instigation of
a number of citizens who were duped by
him. O'Brien came here a couple of
years ago from nobody knew where. He
was a man of rather pleasing personality
and much energy and within a short time
had worked himself up to a fair position
with Stephens & Bean, undertakers. The
first of the present year he was appointed
Deputy Coroner. He had in the mean
time become prominent in fraternal af
fairs. Several weeks ago he went on a
carousal here and was discharged from his
position. Friends sympathizing. with him
offered to back him in .the undertaking
business and several furnished money for
him tot make a payment on stock. He
went to San Francisco and returning said
he had arranged for the purchase of' the
stock. The exact amount of money turned
over to him is not known, but Frank
Shuck, a waiter In the Acme restaurant,
who had $G00 saved up. gave the entire
amount to O'Brien, thinking he was mak
ing a good business investment. O'Brien
went to San Francisco again. Shuck
waited several da>\s for O'Brien's return,
then received a letter in which the un
dertaker said: Â¦

surrounded at a point near Greenwood.
Then messages were received from Placer

in a gully some miles from Pilot Hill, but
this was, proven to be false.
It is the opinion here that the convicts
have hidden in the dense brush and will

TRAIL OF CRIMINALS
News Arrives
in Fragments
at the Prison
District Attorney Seymour and the
prison officials had one of the cellmate*
of Harry Eldridge, one. of the escapes,
before them yesterday afternoon. They
decline to give the name of this convict.
From him they learned that he had told
a trusty that something was wrong with
the men and that he had better warn the
lieutenant of the day watch: The trusty
told this convict to report the matter to
Guard Cochrane. but he was unable to do
so for the reason that illdridge and
Woods kept at his side afterward. El
dridge and Woods were among the first
to get out of the line and make the at
tack on the office of Captain of the Guard
Murphy.
Eldrldge's. cellmate told the officers at
the examination that last Sunday night
Eldridge questioned him about the coun
try in which the escapes have sought ref
uge. This occurred after the prisoner?
had all been locked in their cells for the
night. Eldridge then showed his fellow
convict the rifle balls which he had and
said he was to have received more of
them, but the person who was to have
brought them got "cold feet." Elrfrldge
told his cellmate that he was going to
"get out," and asked him to Join with
him. He Eldridge he would have
nothing to do with any jail break and said
Eldridge was foolish to attempt it. El
dridge then pulled a knife from under his
shirt and threatened to kill hla fellow
prisoner if he ever said a word to any
free man about what he had told him.
The next morning Eldrldge watched his
cellmate closely, but the latter managed
to hastily impart a word of warning to a
trusty, advising him to tell Lieutenant
KIpp of the threatening danger, but the
trusty did not pay any attention to the
warning, telling the prisoner to 'Â»<Â£Â£>
Cochrane. The prisoner said if Eldridge
saw him talking to a free man he would
kill him. Eldridge and came up
to the former's cellmate and he had no
further chance to talk to the trusty.

Juan Martinez, a convict, is given much

Myers and Leverone were questioned by
District Attorney Seymour and Captain
of the Guard Murphy as to t.Vir :con
nectlon with the conspiracy to escape, but
they denied they, participated in it and
stoutly maintained they had no knowl
edge of it. They also claimed they, did
not assault Chalmers and had merely re
turned, to the prison through the gate to
avoid getting into the difficulty.
Guard Carey subsequently investigated
the cell which Leverone occupied and dis
covered a shirt of Leverone's from wnlch
several pieces - had been . cut on which
there were blood spots. . These pieces had
been thrown into the "waste can. Blood
was also discovered on the back of the
shirt, showing plainly he had participated
in the assault. Leverone was called into
the office to explain this circumstance,
but as soon as he was questioned about
it'ho said:
"Do you suppose I am going to r'.t

are going to put to me?"
"Why, yes," said District Attorney Sey

He replied that he would not dc- it then,
but at what he designated as t*>,e proper
time he would tell what he knew.
It was stated by some of the eye-wit
nesses that William A. Leverone; one of
the convicts, who Is doing forty-five years
for robbery, was engaged in assist in;
Myers in his attack on Chalmers. Both
Myers and Leverone returned to the main
prison through the gate immediately after
the assault upon the officers and guards.
This was rather puzzling to the officers,
for they could not understand why they
did not carry out their design of escaping.
It appears, however, that while they were
engaged In their attack some chots were
fired and it Is probable that Myers and
Leverone heard these shots, imagined that
the guards had opened fire and as &
matter of safety they rushed into' i.\&
prison. It was soon too late for them
to Join their confederates, who were
crossing the prison grounds on their way.

It appears that W. A. Chalmers, the

prisoners and received a severe cut on his

this mornirife, the defendant to the ac

complainant is Mary Martin, the alleged
wife of the San Joseean. now residing in
Athena County, Ohio. The complaint al
leges adultery and avers that she and
Martin were married in A<hena County,
Ohio, on January 13, 1855, and lived to
gether until 1872, raising a f&mlly of six
children, three of whom have since died.
In the last â¢ named year, without just
cause of any kind, the complainant re
cites, Martin left his wife and children,
some of them then quite young, and since
he has refused them attention or money.
The complaint alleges that through all
the years subsequent she struggled for a

educate the latter. This, she states, she
succeeded in doing, and now finds herself
in her old age broken in health and poor
in pocket, and, with the knowledge that
while her husband has. been false to his

The names of forty residents of Peking,

were presented to the Dowager Empress
to-day by the reactionary officials, who
recommended that they be severely pun
ished. Those accused are considered
guilty of only what in enlightened coun
tries would be termed legitimate criticism
of the Government. This Is said also to
be true of the native journalists Imprison
ed at Shanghai, except in the case of two
of them, who suggested the assassination
of the Manchu rulers as a remedy for
China's troubles. AH foreigners and pro
gressive Chinese are deeply interested in
the decision which the Ministers will
make on the question of turning over the
native editors arrested at Shanghai to
Chinese jurisdiction and they express the
hope that technicalities concerning the
Jurisdiction of the mixed court will be
ignored If necessary and that the Min
isters will refuse on the ground of hu
manity to deliver the prisoners to the
Chinese for probable torture and execu
tion, as happened In the case of the Chi
nese who were turned over to the Chinese
officials at Shanghai during the Japanese
war.
PEKING, July 29.â The Chinese who are
advocating Government reforms have
been terrorized by the readoption of the
old policy of repression as instanced by
the recent arrest at Shanghai of Chinese
editors on charges of sedition. These ar
rests are interpreted here as Indicating
that the extreme conservatives are in the
ascendency and that the Government has
determined to suppress the freedom of
speech, -which has prevailed since the up
heaval of 1900.

This is an outrage to stigmatize Captain
Howard as a suicide, when the evidence so
plainly points to murder. I will get every
pency I can find to sift this thing to the bot
tom by private means.
When they were leaving the room one of the
jurors. I think .It was J. S. Llnscott. told me
that when they called Coroner Mehrmann Into
the Jury-room on a point of information tho
sentiment then stood seven in favor of a mur
der verdict to one opposed. According to - Lin
scott's statement, the Coroner swung the ma
jority around to the suicide verdict.
i Leon Newman, one of the lessees of tha
Russ House, was present in the absence
of his brother. Charles Newman, to tell
what he knew t of the dead man's move
ments. Leon Newman said that Captain
Howard's absence from the hotel was
noted July 9. He had never heard Howard
speak In a despondent tone and could not
explain the week's time elapsing from tho
date at which he left the hotel to the
day of his death. Gus ' H. Schmidt of
1912Â»~ Jones street, a |:Ierk at the Russ
House, next added his testimony.
Dr. C. F. Gladding, the autopsy sur
geon, who performed the post-mortem
examination, then took the stand. He
declared that the fracture of the skull
extending the entire length of Captain
Howard's head from behind the right ear
to the nose was probably due to the fall
to the ground after he fired the fatal
shot. Deputy Coroner C. H. StreighUf.'
who was present at the autopsy, testified
that no such fracture could be made save
by a blow from some blunt Instrument.
After all the testimony in the case had
been taken, the Jury rendered the verdict
oi suicide, after long deliberation.
R. W. Turner, who came down from
Victoria to review the testimony In the
case, was greatly incensed "at the result
of the deliberations and boldly states that
it was effected by irregular conduct on
the part of Coroner Mehrmann. He said:
To the testimony which was developed
on Monday evening were added details of
the contents of Captain Howard's private
papers, now at the Russ House with the
remainder of his baggage. Since it was
the absence of this testimony which had
caused the Jury to postpone its decision on
a verdict at its former meeting, the case
was closed with the hearing of a Call re
porter who had examined the dead man'd
papers.
After deliberating for one hour and a
half last night the Coroner's Jury called
to investigate the death of Captain Thom
as Howard "of Victoria in West Berkeley
oji July 17 brought in a verdict declaring
that he met death by his own hand. R.
W. Turner, the dead man's relative, who
was'present as a witness at the inquest.
declares that In view of the evidence, tha
verdict of the jury is ridiculous and even
goes so far as to state that undue Influ
ence was brought to bear upon them by
Coroner Mehrmann of Alameda County.
He says that he will see to it that the
mysterious death of Captain Howard is
investigated by private detectives.
The meeting of the Jury, which was
postponed from Monday night on account
of the absence of one witness, resulted In
the verdict of which the text follows:
' We. the Jury, do" find that the name of tha
deceased was Thomas Howard, "a native of
Canada, aged about 62 years: that he came to
his death at the rear of an old barn, known as

THE SAN VEAKGISCO CALL, THURSDAY; JULY 30, 1903.
5It seems an idle waste of time to censure the fre
quent jawbone assaults of William Jennings Bryan
upon ex-President Cleveland. These attacks serve
to keep Bryan busy enough to prevent him from the
perpetration of other mischief; they probably af
ford him some amusement, and under no possible
construction do they work harm to any one.
IT appears certain that France and Great Britain
are about to enter into a general arbitration
treaty for the settlement of all questions that may
arise, between them or between their respective na
tionals. This takes both nations out of The Hague
court, as far as* issues between them are concerned,
and perhaps it is the beginning of the dissolution of
that court before it has been fairly put in operation.
Something of this kind was feared when the court
was created at the Peace Conference and members of
the tribunal were permitted to practice before it.
Sir Julian Pauncefote proposed to forbid this, but was
outvoted.
Inasmuch as all judicial officers are forbidden to
practice before their own or other courts, it will be
seen at once that permission to appear as attorneys
before this highest court of its own members is de
structive of its character. Since the nations selected
their* members of The Hague tribunal the conduct
of certain of them has scandalized it. Notable
among such acts is that of Von Bar, one of the Ger
man membcra, who has rented himself out for a fee
to write an opinion in review of an international de
cision of which a petty shyster would be ashamed
His conduct is likely to lead to a diplomatic request
that Germany withdraw" him as a: member of The
Hague court, and certainly any party to an issue
therein will reject him, not only on the ground that
being a member of the court he should not sell his
opinions, but that the opinions for which he takes a
price are full of falsehood and misrepresentation.
If France and Great Britain make the proposed
agreement The Hague court can be â¢ saved only by
forbidding practice to its members and by insisting
that such disreputable members as Von Bar be
taken off the panel. Â¦ v . t ' Â» '*.â¢%"Â¦
DISCREDITING THE HAGUE.
A few weeks more and we will.be in the midst
of the hubbub, confusion and turmoil of local poli
tics. The orator will be abroad in the land, our be
loved English will be murdered, a new set of officers
will be chosen to take the places of the old, and we
will all settle down again to the even tenor of old
friendships. Friction is life.
Cassius M Clay owed his long life mainly to his
skill as a fighter at critical junctures. Partly, too,
he owed it to accident. In describing one of his
many fights Clay tells how an opponent once fired
at him within srm's length, but Clay escaped un
"mr*. After the fight was over an examination was
ma'te. and Clay says, "It was found that the ball, as
T pulled up the scabbard of my bowie knife in
draâ ing the blade, had entered the leather near the
point, which was lined with silver, and there lodged."
Perhaps, then, one way to have a long life is to
car ..' a bo-*ie knife with a scabbard lined with silver.
W^en Leo was sick he had the best physicians in
<*?ome to attend him and he did whatever they said,
but when Clay was sick he barricaded his house and
threatened to kill any doctor that dared to enter it
Thus their attitudes toward death were as different
as their attitudes toward life. There are some who
sÂ«y the doctors killed the Pope by overtreatment.
There are others who say that doctors could have
saved Clay had they been permitted to take care of
him. Such statements are worth nothing. All that
can be truly said is that Leo's life serves "to point
a moral and adorn a tale," while Clay left a story
"at which the world turns pale." There is much to
be learned from the two to help a man to live rightly,
but nothing that will assure him the certainty of liv
ing tang.
-f his favorite doctrines. It is therefore to be re
gretted that just as Leo was showing the world how
to live long by being good and serene Cassius M.
Clay was showing how one could live a little longer
than Leo by being what is called a "hell of a man,"
One of the moralists in commenting upon Leo's
life says: "A sound mind in a sound body, a healthy
:i^.d sympathetic interest in humanity, a sane and
natural love of life, a spiritual sweetness that assured
unfailing soul-poise, go far to account for the vital
for-e of the frail old priest of 93, who has now put
oJ his mortality. The perfectly balanced man. phy
i-icaliy and psychologically, lives a long and useful
rid happy life, closed by a tranquil death."
That doctrine sounds beautifully, and doubtless it
is Â«.ne proper thing to teach the masses, but unfor
tunately it dees n*.t fit the facts. A good many men
of -y. -client balance, mental and physical, have caught
cold or slipped on a banana-peel and died young. A
good many unbalanced people, with brains awry and
bod,.s frail and feeble, have lived a long time. In
deed Leo himself was not physically well balanced,
for he was more or less of an invalid all his life, and
there has been recently published a poem written by
him in his twentieth yeaf in which he speaks of his
frail body 2nd the imminence of death even at that
early period.
FROM the long life of Pope Leo moralists are
now drawing lessons for the edification of those
who wish to live in good health to extreme old
sgÂ« and possibly attain their hundredth year. As
the life of Leo was a beautiful one, so the lesson
Â¦drawn from it is beautiful. The moralist could
hardly have a better theme upon which to preach his
finest s'.'raon, or a better illustration to cite in proof
LESSONS IN LIFE.
AT a national contention of State Dairy and
Food Commissioners held at St. Paul Pro
fessor Wiley of the Bureau of Chemistry of
the Department of Agriculture made a partial re
port of resultS'-obtained from his experiments with
various kinds of preserved foods and announced that
a full report would be made in October. The experi
ments have attracted a great deal of attention
throughout the country, and many exaggerated
reports and misrepresentations concerning â¢ them
have been circulated, so it is gratifying to know
that the exact truth will soon be made public.
A full report of the proceedings of the convention
has not reached us, but a summary of the statements
of Professor Wiley says: "The result so far as the
experiment has gone in relation to prepared foods
is that those chemically preserved are not desirable;
that foods can be preserved better by simple steriliza
tion, and that only 'in occasions of emergency or
exigency' is the use of chemical preservatives neces
saiy. Professor Wiley says that it may be well not
to make absolute prohibition of all preservatives, but
that most certainly every food in which a preserva
tive is used should be clearly, labeled on the package,
so that the purchaser and the consumer should
know what he is using. Chemical preservatives \n the
ultimate, if long used, are harmful. Professor Wiley
says that national and State legislation should be
made uniform, based on sound hygienic principles,
'free of any tendency to prosecute or annoy, and
supported by an enlightened public opinion both on
the part of the producers and consumers of food.' "
There is nothing in that statement to which any
honest manufacturer of foodstuffs can justly take ex
ception. The tests made by Professor Wiley of the
effects of eating chemically/ prepared foods appear
to have been sufficiently elaborate to render it safe
to draw positive conclusions from them. None of
the young men who volunteered to make the tests
suffered^ any great injury, but it seems there was
ample evidence to show that chemical preservatives,
while not immediately injurious to strong and healthy
persons, are, as Professor Wiley puts it, "undesir
able." That being so, there is no reason why food
stuffs preserved in that way should not be clearly
branded as "chemically preserved," so that con
sumers may know what they are getting. That would
be a simple way of doing justice all round and would
not in any way interfere with legitimate industry or
annoy manufacturers whose preservatives are harm
less.
PURE FOOD PROBLEMS.
A New York woman bought ah incubator that
looked very much like a refrigerator and placed it in
her cellar. Then she put two dozen fancy eggs in
the incubator and went down town. When the ice
man arrived the husband deposited the ice in the in
cubator instead of the refrigerator. On her return
the woman found the eggs frozen and the butter
melted. There was first a row and then a fight. Now
there is a suit for divorce on the ground of extreme
cruelty. All of which shows that men who manu
facture incubators like refrigerators should be in
dicted for inciting riots and interfering with domes
tic peace.

That is a big showing for a single year, but in all
probability it will be exceeded during the year to
come. Outside of the mere bigness of the sum, how
ever, there is not so very much on which to con
gratulate ourselves. Authorities who are in a posi
tion to know the facts assert that our democracy of
insatiable readers demands trash and compels the
libraries to furnish it. That is said to be especially
true 01 public libraries supported by taxation. One
critic says: "The librarian must stock his shelves
with current fiction and display every popular maga
zine, or the taxpayer has a grievance: He is not get
ting his pennyworth, and he will criticize and aim to
undo the work that the librarian carries on at public
cost if this agency for popular instruction should
give its care exclusively to serious literature."
Doubtless the critics are taking a pessimistic view
of the situation. They generally do. Still it is grati
fying to have the issue brought up for study and
review. If the readers are demanding the wrong
kind of books it may be found necessary for the .Car
negies of the future to endow libraries not with
funds to buy more books or erect new buildings, but
to employ instructors to tell people what to read
and how to read it.
WHEN Andrew Carnegie was growing to
manhood and bravely working his way to
wealth the thing he longed for most acutely
and found most difficult to get Was a good library.
Out of that unsatisfied desire of youth grew a reso
lution that if ever he became rich enough to do any
thing for poor boys he would found a free library.
He has become far richer than he ever dreamed of
in his most ardent hours of youthful expectation,
and now he is founding or promoting libraries by
the score. Having himself felt such a longing for a
library, he has of course believed that every one else
shared the feeling, and is doubtless surprised to find
how coldly .his. benefactions in that way have been
received in many quarters, and how indifferent a
very large percentage of the people are to what he
deems to be the best thing a community can have.
Mr. Carnegie does not perceive that, conditions
have changed materially in this country since the
days when he was a struggling youngster, and that
there is now no such pressing' need for more li
braries as there was in his time. Books of all grades
are cheaper and more plentiful. The book now sold
for a dollar or even a dime is no longer necessarily
a thing of trash. Most of th'e great classics and
some of the masterpieces of scientific exposition can
be obtained for comparatively small sums, and con
sequently men are no longer so dependent on li
braries as of old. Moreover, libraries are themselves
more numerous and more abundantly stocked than
they were. In bur American life, 'therefore, ,a lack
of books is by no means regarded as a long-felt want
by any considerable number of people.
So rapidly have libraries and books multiplied that
some critics complain we are reading too much. The
complaint is made not only of us, but of our British
cousins, who also have had the free library habit very
strong of late years. One of these critics says free
libraries "encourage habits of reading for the mere
purpose of killing time; they form and confirm the
practice of intellectual dissipation; they introduce
boys and girls and half-educated young men and
women to poems and fictions which, though not ac
tually immoral and warranting inclusion in the Index
Expurgatorius, inflame their passions and imagina
tions and have a most disturbing and unwholesome
effect; and they place in their way, often with the
most disastrous results, works on religious and
moral subjects for the perusal of which they are not
ripe."
Whether it be true or not that we read too much,
it is certain that the increase of libraries in this
country is going on at a great rate. At a recent
meeting of the American Library Association at
Niagara Falls a report was read showing the num
ber of notable gifts to American libraries during the
past year. The reports included no gift of less than
$500 in money or less than 250 volumes. A sum
mary of the report says: "Five hundred and eleven
gifts are recorded, representing in all 96,247 vol
umes and $10,306407 61. Of this amount $715,800
was given for general endowment funds, $86,700 for
building sites, $5,679,000 for buildings, from Andrew
Carnegie, $1,250,998 55 for buildings from various
donors, $108,060 for the establishment of book funds,
$101,577 46 for the purchase of books, and $1,363,
371 6b for purposes which were not stated. This

j bushels more than the crop of 1961/ while as recently
as 1890 the wheat yielded but little more, than 20,000,

On the Pacific Coast the crops of all kinds prom

to early expectations, but other crops will be good.
We shall do more than our share in swelling Uncle
Sam's revenue from rural industries. In fact, there
is not likely to be any complaint from the railroads
of a lack of freight in any part of the West. We are
more likely to hear a repetition of the complaints of
the past two or three years of a lack of cars and
locomotives to handle the freight offered. The
West, indeed, is ready for big business. Her broad
acres have nojt felt the tremors of Wall street.

if he has upon the table any combination
In which it can be used his adversary
may force him with it. even after it has
been declined. For Instance, a player has
eight cards down, two sequences of four
small cards each, and in his hands a pair
of kings. Another king- will make him
game, but if he has to depend on hia se
quences to put him out he will have to
get three more cards. Suppose he draws
a card that will fit one of his sequences.
it is to his advantage to pass It; but upon
laying it on the table his adversary may
take it up and force him with It by plac
ing it at the end of his sequence, at the
same time saying 'discard.* In the same
manner one of the players holding 1 one of
the cards of his adversary's sKow-down.
sequence or triplet, may force after using
a card by placing his discard on his ad
versary's sequence Instead of laying It on
the table. If it Is laid on the table the
adversary may pass It once by turning it
down, and It Is then too late to compel
him to use it. Suppose you think your
adversary holds two cards of an un
played sequence and has a triplet on the
table: if you can use one of those se
quence cards in his hand to advantage
and can force him by givinjr him the
fourth card of his triplet, which is of no

must remember that you cannot forca

LONDON, July 29.â The validity of Da

to-day before the President of the Divorce
Court, Sir Francis Jeune, in the suit for
divorce brought by D. S. Constandlni

Stephen Ralll, a member of the firm of
Ralli Brothers, well known in New York
as well, as ' In London. The husband
cfharged his wife with bigamously marry
ing Dr. Lance, the family physician. Con
standini obtained a judicial separation
from his wife in 1899.
John Lawson Walton, counsel for the
petitioner, explained the subsequent pro
ceedings as follows:
This delicately nurtured lady of Belgrravi*
went to a wild district of the earth, emigrated
to the half-settled State of Dakota, became an
American citizen, stayed six months there,
fraudulently obtained a go-called divorce and
married the co-respondent there, thus using the
lax Dakota laws for her own purpose. This
was fraud on civilized jurisprudence.
The jury found the respondent and co
respondent guilty of adultery, awarding
$125,000 damages against Dr. Lance, and
also found the petitioner guilty of the
counter-charge of adultery. His petition,
therefore, was dismissed and argument
on the points of law involved was post
poned until to-morrow.-
PHILIPPINE COMMISSION
COMPELS RETRENCHMENT
It Is Believed That Insular Expenses
. Will Show a Reduction of
10 Per Cent.
MANILA, July 29.â The United States
Philippine Commission has been conduct
ing a detailed examination of the heads
of the various departments of the Gov
ernment, forcing on them a general policy
of retrenchment. The Commissioners
have investigated the estimates, cut down
items, substituted Filipinos in subordi
nate positions formerly assigned to Amer
icans and have impressed on the chiefs
that they must follow the McKinley pol
icy of the elevation of the Filipinos. As a
result of the commission's action it is
estimated that the budget for the half
year will be reduced from $5,209,408 to
$4,216,165 for the Insular Department, and
for the city of Manila from 11,407,034 to
$969,015, exclusive of permanent improve
ments, which will be made a separate
charge. C V ;r 1
The budget bill has not yet been passed.
The commission has adopted a new ar
rangement for the appropriations because
previous statements contained over
estimates to the amount of about 51,000,000,
which is being returned to the treasury,
and it is expected that the insular ex
penses will show a general reduction of
8 to 10 per cent.

Special Dispatch to The Call
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 29.â
. The elaborate new mosaic work on the
front of the Stanford Memorial Church
was completed to-day and the facade of
the church stands as it will for many
years to come, a glorious picture amid
and above the palms and arches and tiled
roofs of the quadrangle. The Interior of
the great structure is. however, by no
means completed. .Work was begun soon
after the close of the last term smoothing
the stone walls of the nave and the
artists started to-day with the mosaic
work there after finishing the outside.
The first of the inlaid pictures on the
face of â¢ the church represents with fig
ures of heroic size and exquisite bits of
natural scenery "The Sermon on the
Mount," and was completed a year ago.
The later work has been above the arches
of the entrance.' It is a beautifully colored
floral decoration in mosaic, surrounding
four figures representing Love, Faith,
Hope and Charity. The inscription has
likewise been sent in a background of
gold mosaic and the smaller spaces filled
with conventional floral designs. One of
the most beautiful additions to the church
since its dedication is the carving on the
arches of the entrance. It has all been
most delicately executed In the stone by
hand and in like manner fhe columns
have been fluted.
Owing to the immense amount of work
to be done on the interior, it is rumored
that the church will not be used for ser
vices during the coming year. High scaf
foldings have been erected and the seats
of a large part of the church, as well as
the large organ, have to be covered up.
The Italian artists will be engaged for
probably a whole year on the work al
ready designed. In the basement of the
church they have opportunity to spread
out the designs in glass and. give all the
finishing touches. Already four of the
great Old Testament scenes which will
line the walls of the nave are ready to be
put up. The walls of the nave will hold
eight of these pictures, each about 12x7
feet in dimensions. The clestory walls
will be covered with floral designs and
very elaborate mosaics, whose designs
have not yet been chosen, are to be placed
last of all in the organ gallery around the
rose window. ' .

Governor F. O. Schuster Says Amer

Not Attractive.
LONDON. July 29.â Governor F. O.
Schuster at a meeting of the Union Bank
of London. Limited, to-day made a
lengthy reference to the British fiscal con
troversy. While he welcomed an inquiry
into the fiscal policy of the Government,
the whole tenor of Schuster's remarks
was opposed to tampering with free trade.
He expressed the belief that the United
States was within measurable distance of
adopting free trade and in support of this
said he had a private interview with the
late President McKinley two years ago.
In which the latter said:
My tariff bill has done its work. We have
been able to build up many great Industries
In a short time, and now gradually but inevi
tably our tariff must be reduced.
Schuster contended that America's in
dustrial position under protection was
"not entirely attractive, nor are its work
ingmen contented." /

* An Alameda man went insane .the other, day
dreaming over a fortune which; had been bequeathed
to him. His condition is almost as sad as the fel
low who dreams that he won the first prize in a lot
tery and wakes uo before he has a chance to soend it.
An Indiana youth, backward, bashful and awk
ward, fecured a hunter's license the other day and
believed that it endowed him with' the privilege to
marry the girl of his choice. Perhaps even in his
haste he felt that his wooing would have to begin
*fter the wedding ceremony.
A man was arrested in Oakland the other day for

Russian newspapers have had the unspeakable au
dacity of censuring the traditional and widely ac
cepted American habit of lynching, even going so
far as to cartoon Uncle Sam as presiding officer of

yond toleration. It is almost as bad as our inten
tion, subsequently revised, to interfere in Russian
domestic affairs.
PRESIDENT HILL of the Great Northern,
when asked his opinion of the recent flurry
among the stockbrokers of New York, an
swered: "We are not worried out here. Our broad
acres do not feel the tremors of Wall street." That
statement sums up the subject in a nutshell. Doubt
less there are many persons in the West who have
had such close relations with Wall street that
they have suffered more or less from the fluctuations
in the stock market, but the West generally, from
the Mississippi to the Pacific, has not felt even so
much as a tremor from the Wall-street shake-up.
The wheat States as a rule have remarkable crops
despite a shortage here and there. An estimate
made up in St. Paul from reports from 300 cor
respondents in various parts of the Northwest is to
the effect that the average yield per acre will not
be large, but that nevertheless taken as a whole the
crop will be a good one. The calculations are that
Minnesota will have 90,000,000 bushels, North Da
kota 46,000,000, and South Dakota 36,000,000.
- From Kansas come glowing reports of a crop so
big that there are hardly men, women and children
enough to harvest it. One report says: "The sec
retary of the State Board of Agriculture and officers
of the San Francisco Railroad estimate this sum
mer's yield at 100,000,000 bushels, and the officers
of the Atchison road make the estimate only five
million bushels less. The officers of both roads es
timate the wheat yield in Texas at 25,000,000 bushels,
against one-third of that last year, and the yield in,
Oklahoma at 40,000,000, against less than a third of
that last year. * * * In Nebraska the area of
wheat is IS per cent greater than a year ago, and
estimates from all parts of the State put the wheat
harvest at 80,000,000 bushels. This has never been
approached in the State. The crop last year was
under 53,000.000 bushels, and that was 10.000.000

The annual report of the operations of
the Bureau of Streets was filed yesterday
with the Board of Public Works by Of
fice Deputy Donovan. The report shows
that during the fiscal year ending June
30. 1303, 1,000,737 square feet of paving
work was performed on the stone pave
ments at a cost of $44,612 49. The cost of
the material was $4053 33 and of labor $40,
659 16. The report continues:
There -were 522 sewer breaks repaired; 8837
linear feet cf ripe sewers were reconstructea
and 12Â«.3Â«9 brick, 5121 feet of Ironstone pipe
and 620 barrels of cement were used in the
work of sewer. The repairs to bituminous rock
pavements cost J24.RS5 51.
Applications to the number of 1755 were
made during the year for the construction of
new side sewers and deposits aggregating $51,
010 were maae with the cashier therefor. The
trenches opened in streets by water, light and
power companies within the southern district
aggregated 0S1S. The total mileage of mains
laid was 47.79. i
The total cost for sweeping and sprinkling
of (streets was $178,240 09. The Fourth-etreet
drawbridge was opened 7676 times. There
were 2936 coir.nlalr.ti filed during the yeai.
There were posted along the line of contem
plated street imDroveroents 784 notices.
The total receipts from all sources were
$129,864 67 and the disbursements $93,819 61.
The accepted streets raved with bituminous
rock aggregated 11,415 linear feet: paved with
basalt blocks. 2007 feet; cobblestones. 5S1 feet.
It was unfortunate that such a email amount
of money is annually set aside for the repair
of bitumen pavements. The sum of $20,000 is
insufficient to oroperly maintain 107 miles of
bitumen pavement for a year and the result

At the meetine of the Board of Public
Works Commissioner Schmitz desired a
resolution adopted showing: that he had
protested against the action of the board
in passing a resolution devoting portions
of the funds for the fiscal year 1903-1904 to
increasing the salaries of various em
ployes. Schmit* 6aid he wished the rec
ords show that he not only voted no,
but had objected to the raise in salaries.
Commissioners Manson and Casey voted
apair.ft Schmitz's resolution, which was
lost, as the record is already In evidence.
The secretary was authorized to adver
tise for sealed proposals for the care of

Mayor Schmitz sent yesterday to Audi
tor Baehr the following protest against
the increase in salaries of a number of
employes by the Boards of Health and
Public Works: w
July 20. 1003.
Hon. Harry Baehr, Auditor. City and County
of San Francisco â Dear Sir: I hereby respect
fully call your attention to what seems to me
to be a violation of certain provisions of the
charter both by the Board of Public Works
and the Board of Health In raising the salaries
of certain of their high-salaried employes. In
violation of section 8, article VI, and lection
10. article X.-
I protest against the payment of the addi
tional salary allowed the employes in those
two departments, believing it to be an extrava
gant and an absolute waste of public funds
and strictly agalns^ the provisions of the afore
rcf-ntioned sections of the charter.
I therefore recommend that you refuse to
audit the demands of all employes in those
departments who have been raised since July
1, 15Â»03. \ Respectfully yours,
E. E. SCHMITZ. Mayor.
Says Action of Boards of Health, and
of Works Is Violation of
Charter.

Langdon Says Classes
Have Too Many Pu
pils Enrolled.
Board of Education Makes
Som9 Assignments and
Accepts Resignations. f>
Superintendent of Schools Langdon sent
a communication to the Board of Educa
tion during its meeting yesterday, in
which he' declares that the present clas
sification requiring first grade classes to
consist of fifty pupils each enrolled and
that all other classes shall consist of
fifty-five pupils at the beginning of the
school year is too high. The superinten
dent recommends that the classes be
maintained for the following year as fol
lows:
Minimum. Standard. Maximum.
Grammar 40 ' 50 65
Primary ........ 35 "45 50
He also recommends that it be the
policy of the department to reduce the
size of classes within the next five years
so that they shall be maintained as fol
lows:
Minimum. Standard. Maximum.
Grammar 40 " 45 80
Primary 35 40 45
Langdon also recommends the establish
ment of an ungraded class where weak
pupils could be taken for special instruc
tion and the board is likely to have such
a class in the Lincoln or "Washington
Bchool. The board took the report under
advisement, but expressed itself in accord
with Langdon's views. The report con
tinues:
ASKS IMMEDIATE ACTION.
The problem of the classification of school
children has become one of the most Important
school problems in the city of San Francisco,
as in all the other large and growing cities of
the United States. It is a difficulty that re
quires particularly urgent action in this city
for three reasons: (1) The number of children
assigned to a class has always been too largo
In the city of San Francisco, (2) the impend
ing enforcement of the compulsory education
statute will bring Into the schools thousands
of children for whom no provision has been
made In epace equipment, (3) the present rapid
growth of the city Is giving an increased
school population that will soon levy additional
burdens on the school department. -
Something must be done immediately for
the relief of the pressure of crowded classes
before the additional pressure of an increasing
population becomes too excessive. Nothing
less than the full quota of schools asked for
by your Board of Education in the projected
Issuance of bonds will meet the necessities of
the coming few years. In the meanwhile wo
must lay down an ultimata working standard
for the size of classes to which we must bring
our classification.
Superintendent Langdon reported that
he had graded the schools so that those
having primary grades and an average
attendance of less than 200 pupils in the
grammar grades shall be known as prim
ary schools and an attendance In excess
of 200 pupils in the grammar grades shall
be known as grammar schools.
BOARD ASSIGNS TEACHERS.

lowing transfers and assignments of

Corbett did all his : work yesterday In
the morning. In .the. afternoon, he came
to this city to witness Brother Joe do tho
twirling for the Los Angeles baseball
team. In tho evening he went to the
theater. . .
Corbett laughs at- the fears of some of
his friends that he may work himself out
and be all in when he. puts up his guard
in front of the champion of the world.
Jim asserts that he has done what the
wise man of ancient" times advised,
"Know thyself." V He Is confident he
knows himself and his limit and says that
If he does not clamber between the ropes
to do battle In the best possible physical
condition with the grizzly giant now at
Harbin Springs It will be because he could
not attain it.
Those who have seen James J. Corbett,
ex-champlon of pugdom, fitting himself
In Alameda to capture, if he can, the
championship from James J. Jeffries, are
invariably Impressed with the care and
earnestness Corbett devotes" to his train
ing work. Even his Bparrlng and wrest
ling partners. Sam Berger and Yank
Kenny, and they are both powerful and
husky men, complain occasionally of the
terrific pace the ex-champlon puts them
through In the every day routine train
ing.

CK. G. BILLINGS' marvelous
Callfornla-bred trotting mare,
Lou Dillon, did not try for the
world's record yesterday at
Cleveland, as planned, owing to
the heavy condition of the track.
The daughter of Sidney Dillon-Lou
Milton Is looked upon as a possible two
minute trotter, that animal which horse
men |have been trying to ! produce for
year*. The Illustrated Sporting News
says of her: â¢ Â»
The appearance of a new trotting queen is
significant. The world's record has been held
frequently by geldings and onco by a stallion,
but the real slaughtering of time since 2:30 was
first beaten by Lady Suffolk, more than a half
century ago, has been done by mares. Lady
Thorne, Uoldsmlth Maid. Maud S. Nancy
Hanks and Allx were racing queens as well as
"watch queens.'.' It is a pity. In one respect,
that Lou Dillon, which trotted a mile in 2 :(>:{>?
at Cleveland two weeks ago, will not be raced
for money, as - then her real class, when
matched against the best campaigners of the
Grand Circuit, could be determined. Her own
er races only for cups and ribbons, however, so
the ordinary patron of harness contests may
not have the pleasure of seeing her. Of course
she will make a number of attempts during
the season to reduce her record, . and these will
be followed with the greatest interest. Lou
Dillon is really queen of trotting mares because
she has beaten the 2:03% of Allx. She has yet
to lower the 2:03% of The Abbot, a gelding,
and the 2:02Vi of Cresceus. a stallion. That
she will do It. however, few horsemen doubt.
Her mile at Cleveland was far faster than any
other trotter, regardless of sex, had ever gone
so early In the season, and sne moves with
such grace and ease, and gives such evidence
of reserve speed that good Judges predict she
will clip at least a second from the present
world's record, and may succeed in trotting a
mile In 2:00 before the snow files.
Road drivers and those who love *i>ort not
for the money there Is in it applaud Mr. Bil
lings' action in refusing to race his horses for
money, and hope Lnu Dillon, who has never
competed for a cent, will prove the trotting
marvel she seems to be.

The Reorganized crippled band of Oak
land baseball artists, under the personal
chaperonage of the venerable Peter Loh
man, are with us once more. They hied
themselves to the Eighth-street lot yes
terday afternoon In order to give bat
tle to the Angels, and, as is usually the
case, they were honoreot*with the smaller
portion of the runs. Score, 5 to 4.
Brother Joe Corbett installed himself
in the pitcher's box with the air of a man
who Is about to be King for a day. Joe
had reason to take on a look of pride, for
way up in the grand stand, with a party
of friends and admirers, sat James J.,
swelled with pride at the sight of Joe do-
Ing the big stunt for the big team of the
league.
Joe performed well In the main. He had
one fault â wlldness. As the game pro
gresed he seemed to overcome It
and the more he pitched the better he
became. In all the Cripples only located
three of his offerings, though errors al
lowed them to circle the bases four times.
Then Joe turned In and struck out seven
men, something that does not happen dur
ing the progress of every ball game.
Graham, for the Cripples, was also suf
fering from his old complaint, wildness,
and his unsteadiness could be noticed in
nearly every inning. The Bupport of the
southpaw was about 100 per cent bet
ter than that tendered his opponent on
the slab. But for that he wourd . have
probably lost the game by many runs
instead of by but one.
Kruger came in contact with one of
Corbett's rapid shoots in the fifth inning
and was knocked out. The ball nit him
square on the skull and he was In thf
land of dreams for several minutes. The
shock was a severe one and for a time
the lad was unable to see. He has lost
the use of his senses for the time being
and may be out of the game for weeks as
a result of the unfortunate accident. The
score: -

Harrison for president and John J. Glea
son' for leader, but Is unpledged to the
other directors.
,iMr. Harrison has taken a stand
against the opposition. He has the ut
most faith In the present board of direc
tors and does not Intend to sit Idly by
and see them ousted. With the present
board of directors to advise him, Mr. Har
rison has been enabled to make many im
provements in the club. To-day it Is In
better condition than It has ever been in
Its existence. Its membership is 2500 and
there Is a waiting list of more than 100.
On next Tuesday night the members will
meet to elect a nominating committee.
The regular nominating committee whose
names will appear on the ballot prepared
by the friends of President Harrison are:
J. D. Spreckels, "W. H. Hanrahan, A. P.
Hampton. Herman Oelrichs and L. L.
Cooper. If this ticket is elected by the
members the present board of directors
will, In a\l probability, be named. If the
opposition is successful they will decline
to nominate Vice President Judge
J. C. B. Hebbard, Â£ Captain Wil
liam Mackle, Director W. â¢ D. Shea
and ! Secretary John Elliott. The op
position's main fight is against John El
liott, the secretary. The^ fight Is led by
men who are opposed to Mr. Elliott by
reason of differences that have arisen in
amateur athletic circles.
The members of the Olympic Athletic
Club are perturbed over the attempt to
bring about a change In the present ad
ministration. The election of officers for
the ensuing year will be held shortly and
thofe who oppose the present board of di
rectors Intend putting up an opposition
ticket.

CHICAGO. July 29,-It is said that proof
has been obtained by the stewards of the
Chicago Jockey Club that James Ar
thur's Bondage was "doped" in the July
Selling Stakes on Monday, which caused
him to make the disgraceful showing that
he dld t finishing last in a field of eight"
after being backed from 4 to 1 down to
3 to L James Arthur, the owner of the
colt, thought he would win sure and is
said to have induced plunger Joe Yeager
to back Bondage to win the stake.
Another rumor Is current that the same
persons who "doped"' Bondage also doped
Bragg yesterday after he had been backed
from 4 to 1 down to 11 to 5. Bragg finished
last, ten lengths behind his flelu.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Jeffries' great strength showed to
marked advantage in the bouts with Joe
Kennedy, for he would brush the latter
and his 195 pounds off as if he were an
Alaskan "skeeter." Kennedy's powers of
assimilation were admired by thosa
watching the men work, for be was tha
receiving end for some swings that
would have kept the bells on the nickel
ln-the-slot punching machines throughout
the State ringing as when a general alarm
of fire Is sounded. While Jeffries' foot
work may have shown no Improvement,
he was much faster with his hands. In
one of his rounds with Kennedy the big
fellow worked a shift on Joe which must
be a new wrinkle on the menu. It land
ed on the latter's jaw, bringing forth tha
exclamation from Bob Fitzsimmona,
"Well, you got it in the first time!" Whila
his two sparring partners were well wind
ed, Jeffries walked about the gymnasium
during the interval of rest with no bellows
to mend, only squatting on his legs but
twice after the seventh And ninth rounds
for about thirty seconds.
The boxing done, he skipped the rope
and indulged in phantom boxing with tha
light dumb bells. In' the afternoon he
played whist and after dinner was a par
ticipant in the ball game. This out of the
way, he easily, defeated Joe Kennedy la
some' sprinting coatests, conceding tlfÂ»
latter a liberal handicap. He then at
tended a show at the springs hall, whera
he and Fitzsimmons made business good
by harpooning friends with hatpins, and
that's going some.
While Trainer Billy Delaney, who is in
clined to be cautious, has advised his
friends all over not to bet that Jeffries
will win inside of ten rounds, the big fel
low undoubtedly opines differently and is
unquestionably confident ha will turn tha
trick. That ho Is going to mako a fierce
rushing fight is certain, and It will re
quire merry sidestepping on Corbett'a
part to duck these savage onslaughts.
Although many of the punches delivered
by Jeffries to-day would dislodge tha ma
sonry In the new Flood building ha re
marked that he had not let himself out.
For several days Bob Fitzsimmons has
had his name down for a go with Jef
fries, but is so engrossed with waiting
on the new Mrs. Fitzsimmons that all bC
his business engagements Â« have been
broken. To-day, however, it seems to ba
in the cards and there Is every likelihood
of the two donning the mlts. "Fits" was
asked what he thought of Oeorga Gard
ner's ultimatum, stipulating that tha Aus
tralian should come down to 163 pounds.
"Why. that's a bloomln' fine bluff." said
Bob, "when only a few weeks ago ha was)
so anxious to meet me that he would al
most concede that I ba allowed a horse
shoe in each glove and was willing to bet
15000 on the side. Well. I'll tell you what
I'll. do; I'll meet that duffer at 153 pounds
and that may hold him for a time."
V F. E. MULHOLLAND.
The champion retired early Monday
night and at 7 o'clock Tuesday morning
Issued from his cottage for a short warm-
Ing up exercise. The sore leg gave no
further cause for anxiety. Just after too
stage pulled out, well filled with depart
ing guests, who wished Jeffries all sorts
of good luck, the champion started for
the gymnasium with his sparring part
ners. Brother Jack and JoÂ© Kennedy.
If he retains his present form the Jef
fries who will face James J. Corbett on
August 14 will not be the same Jeffries
who, appeared so slow In the ring with
Bob Fitzsimmons. Ten round* were in
dulged in this morning and despite tha
reports of the champion's alleged careless
hdblta he would not "blow out a candle "
after the first round. ;^Y- 'Â¦â¢
From what Billy Delaney says there la
every possibility that the herculean boil
er-maker will remain here at the springs
until within a few days of the contest.
For a reason. Delaney says he can do
his work without being subject to the in
trusion of visitors, who will want to teat
the big fellow's lung power, feel his mus
cles and ask a hundred and one silly
Questions.

QKUS.fiES OUT
THE LlFk^lJf O
The most loathsome and repulsive of all
living things is the serpent, and the vilest and
most degrading of all human diseases is Contagious Blood Poison The
serpent sinks its fangs into the flesh and almost instantly the poison passes
through the entire body. Contagious Blood Poison, beginning with a little
ulcer, soon contaminates every drop of blood and spreads throughout the
whole system. Painful swellings appear in the groins, a red rash and
copper colored splotches break out on the body, the mouth and throat
become ulcerated and the hair and eye brows fall out ; but these symptoms
are mild compared to the wretchedness and suffering that come in the latter
stages of the disease when it attacks the bones'and more vital parts of the
body. It is then that Contagious Blood Poison is seen in all its hideous-
n if SS ' -l. T p Un 8T abscesses and sickening ulcers and tumors show
the whole system is corrupted and poisoned, and unless relief comes soon
this serpent disease tightens its coils and crushes out the life. The only
antidote for the awful virus is S. S. S. It is nature's romody, com-
S /^ ,/â -s posed entirely of vegetable ingredients. S. S. S.
n^M |O^ destrovs every vestige of the poison, purifies the
V^^ V^V blood and removes all danger of transmitting the
N-^/ awful taint to others. Nothing else will do this.
v *â¢ 1^ Strong mineral remedies, like mercury and potash!
dry up the sores and drive in the disease, but do not cure permanently.

the Oakland Transit Consolidated from

monopoly of the Ftreet franchises of Oak

can ever come into Oakland and compete
with them because they have secured
every available franchise in these three
cities, and in addition hold a privilege
from Oakland to HayÂ«r&rds along th*
main highway, running south from Oak
land. These franchises were secured
from the various city and county govern
ment? without cost, and yet the Oakland
Transit Consolidated would not part with
them for twice the amount of the assess
ment, even if there were no rails and cars
upon them.
The orie'nal petition as filed with the
County Board of Equalization was not
quite in legal form and did not state ex

In the United States District Court yesterday
a suit was begun by the Pacific Hardware and
Steel Company vs. the American steamer Mln
netonka^to recover $13,936 33, with costs and
interest.^ The complaint recites that in March.
1903, the libelant company delivered to the
-steamer at New York 19.002 packages of hard
ware for the freight of $13,2S3 11 and the ves
sel arrived In San Francisco June 2S with a
part of the cargo damaged in the amount sued
for The libelaift. alleges that the damage was
-caused by reason of the negligence of the own
ers of the steamer and the improper 'construc
tion of the vessel. . - -
United States Local Inspectors Captains O.
F Bolles and John K. Bulger visited the Min.
netonka yesterday on the drydock at Hunters
Point and made a careful survey of her hull
and machinery. They found between2oOO and
3000 loose rivets in her bottom. They also
found one set of toiler tubes defective and or
dered a new set to be put in.
The Mlnnetonka grounded while passing
through the Straits M Magellan and there is a
question at issue whether the grounding caused
the rivets to become loose or whether there
was improper construction in the first place.

<HE Pacific Mail Company's City
j j of Para, which arrived Tuesday
11 i ? ght from Pajiama and way ports.
*Â¦ docked yesterday at the little Mall
dock. She brought 929 tons^ of
cargo, treasure valued at $42,987 and forty
six passengers.
Stowed away in a locker on the after
deck was a prisoner, captured on Tues
day morning-, when the coaster was off
Point Sur. Captain Zeeder, whose impos
ing appearance on the bridge has gained
ti'm the title of "Klr^," was the man that
made the capture. The prisoner is a hawk
of large proportions. The bird's wings
from tip to tip masure four feet. With
a beak like a pruning knife and claws
l:ke Pilipino bolos the hawk was well
equipped for holding its own against any
kind of an ; enemy. It yielded to the
"King," however.
The hawk was discovered on the can
vas awning which covers the after deck.
The bird was tired and when Captain
tZeeder made a grab its dodging was weak
and it had little energy to give battle to
its captor when he finally mustered up
sufficient courage to seire the bird's leg.
With the help of half a dozen sailors
Captain Zeeder subdued the hawk and
confined It In a stout locker: Rest and
food worked a complete change In the
bird's appearance and when the liner
reached . port its strength had returnea
to such an extent that a call for volun
teers may be necessary to move the hawk
from Its prison.

S. E. Buswell was bothered with dan
druff last April and he purchased from
J. S. Potts and J. A. Logan, members of
a drug firm, a lotion he alleges they
recommended as a sure cure. He charges
in a complaint for $5000 damages -he filed
against them yesterday that the. remedy
caused a disease worse than the dandruff
and was the cause of numerous boils and
Bores that covered his scalp and face after
a few applications.
He- alleges further . that when he re
ported his condition to the druggists they
sent him to Dr. John J. Richsteln, an
employe of theirs, and that he received
from him a prescription, the application
of which made him worse.

CHICAGO, July 29.â Judge Cavanaugh
in a decision to-day decided that labor
unions have the right to place pickets
about a plant where a strike Is in pro
gress, and he also declared that workmen
have the right to persuade workmen to
quit. The jurist furthermore held that
sending men to jail upon affidavits ttiat
they have .violated an. injunction is
illegal. Judge Cavanaugh's decision is di
rectly opposed to decisions rendered in the

This action is taken, it is said, on ac
count of the desire of the company to
cut down expenses all over the system.
The employes are all paid by the hour
and this will make quite a difference in
the pay roll if this same rule applies all
over the system. The machinists receive
37J4 cents an hour and the loss of the one
hour each day will be approximately $10
a month. The loss to the helpers and ap
prentices will. average accordingly.
It is supposed that the change will last
only during the summer months, though
it is possible that the new rate may be
permanent.

The present center of agitation is Ama

They fear that labor trouble Is liable to
come soon. Notices have been posted for
some time reauesting those employed
about Amador City mines to become
members of the Western Federation. The
time limit has been extended to August 10.
Notices are posted up around Jackson call
ing a special meeting for organizing en

to-morrow night.
JACKSON. July 29.â J. C. Williams" of
Nevada County, -vice president of the
Western Federation of Miners, has been
In the county several days on business
concerning that organization. His pres
ence here is interpreted â¢ as a move to
bring engineers and others identified with
the local union of the American Federa
tion of Lrfibor to affiliate with the Western
Federation. It is necessary, the . latter
claims, to hold its position that all those
working in mines in this section should
become members even though they, keep
up, the other union as well. They repudi
ate all idea of falling another strike.

CHICAGO. July 20.â Improved weather and
the heavy selling of yesterday caused weakness
In wheat at the start to-day, and the early
depression was considerably augmented by the
eevcre break In corn prices. September opened
with a loss of V4@%c to %c at 77%@77&c to
77 %c, and there was very little wanted at the
decline. Prices held fairly steady'durlng the
first hour at the lower range, but later a bet
ter demand developed, Induced by bullish news
from the Northwest, where reports from Man
itoba showed greatly reduced crops In that sec
tion. Shorts covered freely, and some promi
nent longs reinstated lines which they had sold
out, which resulted In the market taking a
sharp up-turn. September selling up to 7lHÂ«c
On the advance offerings became extremely
scarce and prices were well maintained
throughout the remainder of the session, Sep
tember closing at 78%c. a net gain of l%@l^c
General rains throughout Iowa, Illinois and
Nebraska caused heavy selling In corn at the
opening; extreme weakness prevailed, Septem
ber being off %c to %c at 61V4Â©51%c. At one
time the offerings were overwhelming and the
market was badly demoralized, but later a
good demand developed on reports from sec
tions of the corn belt to the effect that only
light showers had fallen and that much more
rain was needed. After selling between 5194c
and 62%c, September closed %c higher at
62%c. . â¢ ,..'.;
Oate acted largely In sympathy with corn,
opening weak, but showing a good rally later
with local longs, -who had-sold out their lines,
replacing them on the break. I The close .was
firm with September We higher at 33%e.
Provisions ruled active and strong the greater
Chicago Grain Market.

Conditions In the. fruit market had no note
worthy change. Good sound fruit suitable for
shipping was wanted for shipment on the Puget'
Sound steamer, and occasional lots of " such
stock in small boxes and crates commanded a
small premium over the quoted rates. Re
ceipts of Bartlett Pears from the river were
very heavy, but the market was steady for No.
1 stock under liberal purchases for canning
account. No 2 Pears were In "free supply and
sold off fairly well to peddlers and others, but
at easy prices. Apricots In bulk were quite
steady and the best offerings readily com
manded the top 'rate, but for the common run
of offerings $25 was an extreme figure. Apri
cots In small boxes were offering freely and
neglected. Plums and Peaches In bulk were In
fair request among runners and cleaned up
well. Freshly arrived Peaches In baskets met
with prompt sale, but carrled-over stock moved
slowly. Figs were more plentiful than for
some time past and were lower. Large pack
ages from the river were marketed late, hence
the low prices. Fancy Apples were still in de
mand, but supplies were too heavy for the
market and prices declined. Fancy Grapes and
choice red Nectarines were in fair request, but
common and Inferior stock was In free supply
and moved slowly. There was a sharp drop In
Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes under heavy
receipts from the river. Watermelons moved
slowly at unchanged rates. ! There were seven
cars on the market.
Longworth Strawberries and Currants were
In limited supply and steady. Most of the
Longworths came to hand In poor condition,
being badly shaken up, hence the wide range
In prices. Choice Raspberries and Blackberries
were steady. The canners secured a few chests
of Raspberries at $3 per chest. Prices of Lo
ganberries were largely nominal. Receipts
were light and mostly poor and soft.
There was nothing new In Citrus fruits aside
from a decline In Mexican Limes. The Panama
steamer broucht 509 boxes Into an< easy and
liberally supplied market.
STRAWBERRIESâ J.'XgS per chest for Long

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK.^July 29.â Operations in the
stork market took on a more conservative tone
to-day ar.il the leaps and bounds of the first
recovery from the long depression gave place
to a mote creer.ing process. Even this mod
erate upward pace wts not maintained and
there was irequent hesitation and reaction.
The news of rain In the Southwest and the
resulting weaknees in the grain market was a
benefit to the stock market, as a close eye U
kept on all news bearing upon the condition or
the corn croi*. There Â«ai no evidence of re
newed liquidation of the forced character that
ccst the market so dear for some time past,
but the demand for stocks, nevertheless,
Fhowed signs of satisfaction, and the selling,
though light, was sufficient to force prices
backward again.
There Is an element among stock buyers
I which refrains persistently from entering the
market until conclusive evidence Is shown that
the turn has definitely come. It la made up In
part of speculative shorts for a long turn and
in part of investment buyers, who dread to
hold stocks through a decline, in distinction
from that class called bargain-hunters, which
takes stocks and holds them regardless of the
market prices. The demand from this element
srems to have been exhausted quickly. The
banrÂ»ln-humer element, of course, -decline* to I
follow any advance in prices. The recovery
has readied sufficient dimension* to induce
profit-taking also by the speculative buyers fcr
a short turn who were so fortunate as to get
In at last week's low prices. It U an Inevi
table consequence of such a forced liquidation
with the little sustaining power In the market
that a strong class of holders should have been
able to hold through the. weakest point by an
agreement between themselves; and their credi
tors In order to avert needles* sacrifice to both
by forced liquidation of collateral. The result
is a considerable amount of credits extended
with a stipulation for liquidation at the first
good opportunity. A rising market at this
time meets a considerable pressure of such
contingent liquidation. Aside from these tech
nical considerations, there remains a conserva
tive spirit of waiting to perceive how far the
businot-a and Industrial affairs of the country
will respond to the possible index afforded by
the recent movement of â¢ecurltles prices.
The oolnlona of prominent bankers on the
situation :mpertÂ«il yesterday to the Associated
Press made ui impression upon the financial
district and imply the warning tone adopted
by one Influential banker that the commercial
and Industrial interests of the country may
have to undergo later an experience of liqui
dation like that through which Wall street
har just been passing.
There was a distinct relaxation In the time
money market to-day. The wide movements In
to-day'F market were confined to specialties,
under the influence of special causes. The
day's nÂ«f changes are not important, the
earlier gains having been rather more than
wi|>ed out by the reaction., The Atchlsons were
conspicuously pressed for eale.
Bone"? were generally Irregular. Total sale*
(par value), $2,565,000. United States bonds
were all unchanged on the last call. Â¦

LBUiKi by the ether fact that the losses have
chiefly fallen upon the rich, and by *t'll an
mher that liquidation while forced has at no
time been, allowed to develop symptoms of
panjc Support at critical times has always
b*-rn forthcoming frr-m big insiders as well as
Ironi bargain-hunting investors who usually
enpear when securities sell at or under intrinsic
value*.- For high rrade railroad ptooke with a
proved reputation fcr dividend earning cÂ»pÂ«Â«"ity
there are ready rurchnsers on ever>- decline;
and these no doubt will eventually prove profit
able Investment?, even thoulii the market fall
to a tUll lower level. As to the latter possibili
ty. It Jepe^'is entirely ** to the comrleteneFi;
of liquidation, and aa assertion to that effect
is p:-emature. It It* quite certain that bottom
will not be touched until the weak *pots have
beÂ«n thoroughly eliminated, while the l>ear ele
ment, encouraged by recent euccess. are likely
to carry their campaign to the extreme limit.
Indications are that the bottom is not far dis
tant, and that many stocks are at cr suffi
ciently near bottom to warrant purchasing on a
downward scale. This applies, however, only
to really sound securities. There 1* etlll on
the market a mar* of unfllKeFted stocks, or In
digestible as Mr. IIl'.l aptly described them,
for which a etill lower market 1* possible, if
not probable. As a dtpturbin* element, there
fore.' these must continue to tie taken tnto con

cline can be formed by the frilowlnn compuri

Ths decline in securities ha* been satisfac
torily accounted fo>r over and over again; and
now It iÂ» the consequences of that decline that
cause concern. Losses have been exceedingly
severe. And the fact that they have thus far

ter i* dimply astonishing. It is explained, of
"Has the liquidation in etocks run its course,
and what will be its effect upon general busi
ness? These Â«xe the two questions at present
uppermost in the minds cf business men.
though definite answers are impossible under

considerably less than originally anticipated.
This has been especially true with the Hollia
ter district, one of the largest hay producing
auctions in the State. A careful estimate of
thÂ« crop was made early in June and now that
hay is being baled It is turning out full 25 per
cent short. Many shippers are anxious to
clean their fields, fearing early rains, but Judg
ing from" former years ifo worry need be given
this question for over a month yet.
"Concerning the local â¢ market we -have very
little to report. Yesterday matters were espe
cially dull because of exceedingly heavy â¢ ar
rivals. In the country matters are very differ
ent, for with the exception of two or three dis
tricts there Is considerable excitement and hay
is being bought up at figures considerably
above the present range of prices here. Wheth
er buyers are warranted in paying such figures
remains to be seen, although from the present
demand outside of San Francisco It would
seem as though hay should rule high through
out the remainder of the season.

OAKLAND. July 29.â James Bell, a nur
seryman of Berkeley, instituted suit
against his wife Alice to-day to quiet
title to a piece of property on Dwight
way, which he desires to â¢all. The Bells
are unhappily married and she has told
him that before she signs the deed he
must settle with her. Bell states that
the property was his before he married
and wishes to have the court set it aside
as his individual property rather than
make a bargain with his wife for her
signature to the deed. The land is valued
at a few thousand dollars.
Signature Comes High.
ALAMEDA, July 29.â Owing to the fact
that the Unitarian Club will hold its own

the call for the gathering of property
holders arc members of the Unitarian
Club, among them being W. B. Koll
myer, president of the organization. Al
though it has been understood that the
object of the mass meeting is to form
an improvement association to promote
the interests of Alameda it is ajso ex
pected that the unsettled state of r.ffalrs
here due to the agitation (\t the railroad
franchises will be given attention.

OAKLAND. July 20. â Justice of tie Peaca
George Samuels has started on a hunt for
quarters at the City Hall la which to establish
a second Police Court. The newly appointed
Justice has his eye on the Council chamber as
a suitable courtroom. Ke arsues that tha
apartment Is not used by the municipal legis
lators during the daytime, except on rare occa
sions, and that the room could readily be con
verted Into a suitable place for the dispensing
of Justice. As soon u the question of quar
ters is settled Judge Samuela purposes to open
court. Provision for a clerk and the necessary
paraphernalia la authorized under the act of
Legislature, which provides for two Polico
Courts in cities of Oakland's population.

BERKELEY, July 23.â The report that
President Eliot of Harvard University
contemplates resigning within a year has
again sÂ«t afloat a rumor that President
Wheeler of the University of California
may be selected by the board of over
seers for the vacancy should it occur. As
President Eliot has not resigned and has
made no definite statement as to his
intentions it is not likely that President
Wheeler has been thought of in connec
tion with the presidency of Harvard. Be
sides.- President Wheeler in private cor
respondence to friends in California has
said that he has never had any Intention
of resigning the presidency of the Uni
venlty of California to take a diplomatic
post or any other . position. He declares
that he wants to carry on the work he
has inaugurated here and will not with
draw to take an office that offers only
temporary honors.

WEDDING beUs rang out last
evening for the nuptials of
Miss Loretta A. Nolan and
Thomas J. O'Hara of Los
Angeles. The ceremony was
performed by Rev. Father McGinty, pas
tor of the Holy Cross Church. The edi
fice was beautifully decorated and was
crowded with relatives and friends of the
young couple.
The bride was handsome in a gown of
white voile de sole. The yoke was em
broidered in orchids 'and studded with
seeded pearls. A bertha of rare old lace
was worn. The skirt and flounce
were shirred and embroidered in orchids
and seeded pearls. She was escorted down
the aisle by her father. P. F. Nolan, the
retired merchant. They were met at the
altar by the groom and Leo Frank No
lan a brother of the bride, who was best
man. Miss Katherine L. Nolan was maid
of honor. Her gown was pale blue broad
cloth, trimmed with lace and taffeta and
elaborately trimmed with tassels of the
same shade. A Persian girdle set oft the
gown. The ushers were students of Stan
ford University and are classmates of the
groom, who is still in college. They were
William A. Innes, Frank F. Merriman,
John Polhemus and Winslow Bcarty.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the
wedding party returned to the Nolan resi
dence, 1428 Golden Gate avenue. The in
terior was a veritable bower. Decorators
had covered the walls and lattice work
with ferns, palms and flowers and the
house was filled with fragrance.
During the repast toasts were given to
"Did you tell all those merchants you
interviewed that you were seeking infor
mation adverse to the Carmen's Union?"
Livernash asked. "Did they say they
were afraid of trades unions?"
"They said so in so many words," re
plied Milllman.
This closed the case for the day. The
cross-examination of Milliman will be re
sumed this morning at 10 o'clock.
"I resent the suggestion that the trade
unions of San ' Francisco would in any
way injure any merchnat who told the
truth," replied Livernash. "I regard any
merchant who gave any Information and
reqHested his name to be withheld as a
coward, and I also think that- the United
Railroads is acting as a Â«coward in its
present action. You mention. Mr. M111I
man, in your statement, two prominent
shoe dealers. Whom do you regard as
prominent shoe dealers?"
"I advise you not to give this Informa
tion." suggested Attorney Moore to the
witness.
To this Attorney Moore replied that pos
sibly the merchants were afraid of a boy
cott on their stores.
"If you withhold the names of the mer
chants, you ought to withhold your Infor
mation." said Livernash. "You are strik
ing the body I represent In the back. Are
the merchants so cowardly that they
won't disclose tbeir identity V

John R. Haake, who until July 4 acted
in the capacity of superintendent of the
German Hospital, has mysteriously dis
appeared from a party of friends camping
in the vicinity of Ukiah. Mendodno
County.
Four days ago Haake told his compan
ions and . r. and Mrs. Arnold Baum
6tigrr, who were his hest and hostess,
that he intended going for a ramble. He
was in his usual good fp.rits and from
the relaxation that he was enjoying on
his vacation was particularly happy. The
days passed, but Haake did not return
and his friends began to speculate as to
the cause of his absence, concluding that
in all probability he had taken a walk to
onr of the adjacent townships and ln
tenfied to remain away for the night.
Although his non-appearance at the camp
the following day caused a good deal of
uneasiness, Haake, it was concluded, be
ing 1 of Herculean proportions, would be a
match for any one who might attempt to
attack him.
A search was made in the vicinity and
for some miles distant and from all di
rections, but there was no tidings of the
missing man. The third day brought no
news to his anxious friends . and tele
gram* were sent on Tuesday to M.
Raschen. a friend of Haake and manager
of the Aachen Munich Fire Insurance
Company, 423 California street. Raschen
made inquiry of the numerous friends of
the missing man and yesterday, as there
wtj no information forthcoming as to his
whereabouts, the greatest fear was ex
pressed as to Haake's safety.
It is firmly believed by Louis Rush of
ST5 Eansome street that Haake has met
xrl'i a serious accident, possibly while
climbing or descending some steep moun
tain, because he is of a somewhat ven
turesome nature and was likely to take
some chance during his exploration of the
country-
Others of his friends believe that Haake
has been -the victim of foul play.
Haake is a member of Doric Lodge of
Masons, the Teutor.ia Vereln, Germania
Club and Odd Fellows.
~f no tidings of him ir* at hand to
day it is the i: entlon of his friends to
prosecute a further and thorough search.
According' to a complaint for damages
and for the recovery of realty and cash,
filed yesterday by Andrew J. Schow
against John D. Morton and H. A. Mas
sey, he Is the victim of a grave conspir
acy by the defendants. He alleges that
he was damaged to the extent of $3000,
and deprived of $300 cash in bank, prom
issory notes worth $200, Building and
Loan stock worth $369 and realty in San
Louis Obispo County valued at $2000.
Schlow says that last May ho answered
an advertisement of J. M. Thurston,
whose right name, he says is John D.
Morton, and as such he sues- him. The
advertisement informed him that lagal
advice was given free. He retained Mor
ton to defend him against a suit for $1980
brought against him by Peter Courneen.
Massey, says Schow, was called into the
case by Morton, and then the conspiracy
was formed. He avers that they inform
ed him that he was in danger of being
prosecuted by his wife for neglecting to
provide -for, his family. They represented
to him, hie says, that such a charge was
a felony, and - advised him to assign to
them his bank account, stock, notes and
realty,' assume a fictitious, name, and go
into hiding until the danger was past.
Schow did as he was told, he alleges,
even going so far as to offer through the
columns of a newspaper a reward of $50
to any person giving information as to
his whereabouts. The offering of the re
ward, says Schow, was also suggested by
the attorneys, for the purpose of adding
to the deception he supposed was being
practiced solely on his wife.
Greatly alarmed, Schow went into hid
ing, remaining so for six weeks, feeling
during- all this time that his property
was being cared for, that he was secure
from the persecutions of his wife, and
that his interests were being defended
against the suit of Courneen. "When he
emerged from his seclusion, he alleges, he
learned that he had been cleverly duped.
He said that he found that Morton arid
Massey had realized on his property, and
settled Courneen's suit by paying him
$10. They pocketed the bulance, he says,
and notwithstanding that he has made
a demand for Its return, he has received
nothing.
Morton is also being sued by Mrs.
Schow. In an action commenced by her
yesterday she alleges that he was em
ployed by her to collect $2175 due her
on property interests assigned to her by
her husband. The full amount, she al
leges, was collected, but she received but
$400, the balance 1 eing retained by the
defendant.
Groceries. â A member of one larze firm vis
ited stated that the highest point reached for
prices of general -groceries was in the early
part of 1001, and that there was a downward
tendency of said prices in 1901 and a some-
Boots and shoes. â Two of the most prom
inent San Francisco shoe dealers were visited.
At one place shoes were exhibited and demon
strated. A first-class union made man's shoe,
all leather, can be purchased for $2 60 per
pair: a woman's shoe for $-: a boy's shoe for
$1 rO; a miss' shoe for $1 75; all warranted
first class in every respect. .Thia dealer in
formed me that the cost of shoes to the con
sumer had not increased; that while the cost
of raw material had increased competition kept
the retail price down and that the price now
is lower, it any change at all, than a year
or 'two ago and very materially lower than
It was five years ago or ten or fifteen, years
ago.
Clothing. â A leading San Francisco clothier,
centrally located, stated to me that he Is
selling the same grades of clothing now at
the prices prevailing a year ago and that
there has been no increase in the price to
the consumer. That while the price of fabrics
had advanced somewhat the competition In
this line regulated the price and permitted
of no advance In the retail prices, the advance
In woolens being absorbed by the manufacturer
and retailer.
In his statement Milllman, after telling
of commutation meal tickets that are sold
for from $2 to $5 and of rooms that- cost
from 75 cents a week to $5 a month, says:
In response to an - inquiry of the United
Railroads of San Francisco I interviewed a
number of leading: merchants of San ! Fran
cisco dealing in groceries, provisions and boots
and shoes. All of the firms mterviewed re
quested that their names be not used, as
they did not wish it to appear that they were
taking sides In a controversy In which they
were not Interested, but were wUliiur to be
quoted impartially as to facts and without pre
judice. â¢
Following Lucey's statement, H. "W.
Millitnan, an accountant representing
Haskins & Sells, certified accountants of j
New YorK, was called to the stand. Milll
man has been employed for ,three months
gathering statistics in reference to the I
cost of living of carmen here and in other j
cities. His report differs from and abso- j
lutely contradicts the testimony in re
gard to cost of living which was given
earlier in the proceedings by witnesses j
called by E. J. Livernash.
MERCHANTS' STATEMENTS.
The first witness, J. W. Lucey of the j
street car corporation, had compiled flg- i
ures from the statements signed by car
men in reference to their savings and the
increased cost of living. In Lucey's state
ment he aserted that out of the 937 em
ployes responding to the interrogations
supplied by the United Railroad superin
tendents, 378, or 40.3 per cent, reported
having saved money out of their earnings
as carmen. J
The cost of living and carmen's savings
were the points of the evidence given yes
terday at the arbitration proceedings of
the Carmen's Union and the United Rail
roads. Two of the strongest arguments
of counsel for the carmen, namely, that
the cost of living had increased and also
that carmen are unable to save any money
from their present earnings, were refuted
by witnesses called by Attorney Moore on
behalf of the United Railroads.

This is the proposition: You want to fur-
nish a home. You haven't enough ready cash
to pay in full when the goods are delivered,
aence you're compelled to buy "on time." Yet
you dislike trading in an out-and-out install-
ment store. How are you going to get the
easy - payment accommodation and still buy
your goods in one of the big first-class stores?
We offer you the way.
, We loan you the money, charging simply
the regular banking rate of interest â six per
cent. You go then to one 'of the big, first-
;â¢; class furniture stores where the stock is big
and fresh, tnd where satisfaction is certain;
and when you have made your selections pay
your bill in good, hard cash.
The installment stores charge you ten per
cent above their cash prices for time. All you
pay us is six per cent. The actual saving to
you is FOUR PER CENT.
For instance: If your purchases amount to
$100.00 we will charge you $106.00â which is a
six per cent advance; then you pay us -$20.00
cash and the balance in monthly payments
amounting to $8.60 each month. If your, pur-
chases amount to $75.00 we will charge you
$79.50; you make us a cash payment on this
of $15.00 and pay the balance at the easy rate
of $645 per month.
Investigate this â it v/ill pay you.
