east of this city. They- had j gathered
large pieces of rock and heaped them into
a stout barrier against the passage of

VISALIA, July 23.â That the east-bound

this morning, was not' the fault of the
unknown miscreants who piled rocks on
the track at a point where an appalling
disaster at any other time would have
been almost Inevitable. It happened, for
tunately for those aboard the cars, that
the train was running slowly and the
collision with the rock pile resulted In
nothing more serious than a severe shak

PHOENIX. A. T., July 23.â It is report
ed from Jerome that during Tuesday
night's storms there was a cloudburst in
the canyon above the United Verde Smel
ter, which did several thousand dollars'
damage. The flood occurred in tho same
manner and with j similar results as the
flood a year ago. There was also another
flood in Chase Creek at Clifton, but
smaller than that in June, in; which so
many were drowned. Several business
houses suffered damage, but there were
no fatalities. ,
The people of Benson have taken steps
to relieve the inhabitants at Fairbank
who suffered from the flood and pro
visions will be sent if found necessary.
l<ive bridges on the branch line to
Tombstone were washed out, blocking all
traffic by rail. At Tombstone it j is re
ported that following the storm the roar
of the* waters in Walnut Canyon, a dis
tance of seven miles, could be heard. Had
the storm reached as far as Bisbee not a
single house would have been left, as that
city Is built in the heart of two canyons.
No estimate of the damage could be
obtained to-night,' as the waters are just
beginning to subside, but it is known
that it will run up into the thousands.
Fairbank was the greatest sufferer and
part of that junction town will have to be
entirely rebuilt. As many of the build
ings were adobe, they were utterly ruined
by the rush of waters. Reports from the
outlying, districts are" anxiously awaited
and In some directions expeditions have
been sent out to determine the extent'of
the damage done by the storm.
At Fairbank a tremendous wave of wa
ter with a ten-foot breast rushed down
the valley, carrying with it the .wreck
age caused by the wind. Those houses
which escaped the wind . were caught by
the flood and their inhabitants were com
pelled to flee to higher ground, while the
wind still blew a gale. Many narrow
escapes were reported In the town of
Fairbank, but at this hour none are posi
tively knowirto have been lost, although
several are reported" missing.
Tombstone has been cut '.off from all
towns by the. storm, bi^t a stage suc
ceeded in getting over the road late this
evening and reported that Tombstone had
been on the outer edge of- the storm and
that, on^on^/sec^^ottg!* :jhe city .had, sufc
fered greatly. .. . ~,~- * ... v'
Both the Southern Pacific and the El
Paso Southwestern lines between^ Benson
and Fairbank are washed out, all bridges
are down and it is estimated that it will
take $50,000 to repair the damage to the
railroads alone. Both lines put gangs of
men to work this morning and the South
ern Pacific reported that they expected to
get a train into Fairbank over temporary
trestles to-night.

TORRENT IN A VALLEY.
As the wires are down." the first reports
of the terrific storm did not reach Tucson
until this afternoon and they are but
meager. It will be v l several days before
the supposed loss of;lifeand the full ex
tent of the damage -in,^he sections out
side of the towns will' be known.
The storm started with a high wind
about 6 o'clock last night, wrecking
houses, uprooting trees and breaking down
telegraph poles. The' inhabitants of both
Tombstone and Fairbank were swept off
their feet and sought the low adobe
houses for protection. But while the
wind still raged the water burst from the
clouds, adding horror to the already hor
rible situation."
Fairbank is under six feet of .water, the
railroad lines are washed out "and it is
impossible to reach the flqod sufferers.
TUCSON. Ariz., July. 23.â The towns of
Tombstone and Fairbank were devastated
by a terrible tornado; and .cloudburst last
night and it is thought'that many ranch

have been drowned in the flood.

were "lowered all over tne United States

;The majority of the congregation de
cjded to pursue a middle course and In
truated Cardinal Merry del Val with the
duty of drawing up the document for sub
mission to. another -meeting .of the con
gregation. The note, when approved, will
be presented to the diplomatic body,
signed by Cardinals Oreglia, Mactfhi and
Netto, deans of the three orders into
which the Sacred College is divided.
After the will of Leo XIII had been
opened it was the. Intention of the Car
dinals to maintain the strictest secrecy
concerning its contents, but it is learned
that it , comprises thirty-six sheets in the
handwriting of the late Pope, except ad
ditions evidently made In his later years,
when the Pope found considerable difficul
ty in writing, owing to the trembling of
his hand, which was so pronounced be
fore his death that he Was obliged to hold
his right hand with his left when he made
his signature. The earlier portions of the
testament Include the recommendation
which the testator addressed to his ex-
ed other officials, such as the physicians,
who will stttend them during their seclu
sion.
PROPOSED NOTE TO POWERS.
The most important question" before the
meeting, however, was a proposition pre
sented by Cardinal Oreglia to send a note
to the diplomatic audience accredited to
the Holy See for the purpose of repre
senting to the powers the condition of the
papacy since the loss of Its temporal pow
er and the transfer of the capital of the
Italian Government to Rome. From what
leaks out, it appears that the proposition
provoked considerable discussion and
Cardinals Steinhuber, Mathieu and Vivea
y Tuto favored the dispatch of a most
energetic note concerning the question of
reclaiming" the papal rights. Cardinals
Agllardi and Seratino Vannutelli, on the
Contrary, advocated a milder wording of
this document, which, they considered,
should maintain the historical pretensions
of the Holy See. but In temperate lan
guage. â¢*
WASHINGTON, July 23.â The State De
partment has received the following re
sponse to Secretary Hays message of
condolence on the occasion of the Pope's
death:
ROME. July 23. â I have not failed to con
vey to the 8acred College the heartfelt sym
pathy expressed by you In the President's name
on the ead occasion of his Holiness' death.
The Sacred College desires me to express to
the President its deep and sincere gratitude
for such a noble manifestation.
CARDINAL RAMPOLLA.
REPLIES TO HAY'S- MESSAGE.
Sacred College Appreciates American
Sympathy.
The document then enumerates all the
property which Leo possessed and pro
vides that It shall go to hla successor for
the -benefit of the church, including even
the. presents, which might perhaps be
considered personal rather than gifts to
the Pontiff as such. The money which
the Pope left Is in a closed safe in his
bedroom, .the keys having been given to
different persons mentioned ln\ the will.
To the members of his family the Pope
left a present for each, to be chosen from
the valuable objects in his apartments,
and similar gifts were bequeathed to his
doctor?. AH of the land purchased and
buildings erected for Institutions person
ally founded by Leo are put in the name
of the Holy See, to avoid possible claims
from relatives, as the Pope probably re
membered that some time after the death
of Plus IX, the latter's nephews instituted
a suit against the church, claiming 15.000
francs as their proportion of his estate.
The will ends by providing that bis re
mains shall be buried in the basilica of
St. John Lateran, in* the tomb which
he had already chosen. x

Cretoni, on the best way to continue the

announcement that Lord Roberta had defi
nitely determined to make the visit. The
truth is that the whole matter has always

PONTIFICAL REQUIEM MASS.
At 9:30 o'clock the solemn pontifical re
quiem mass was celebrated In St. Peter's
for the repose of the soul of Leo XIII.
The crowd was kept constantly moving
within the wooden barriers, but other en
trances wer.e provided for those desiring
to assist at the mass on the other side
of the church. Several thousand persons
were present, although, in eo vast a
church, they appeared to be a mere hand
ful, especially as all were standing.
During the hot hours of the day the
Within the church temporary railings
had been erected to keep the people in a
straight line leading to the bier. This
was the center toward which all eyes
were turned. The body lay in a catafalque
ten feet high, so that all could see it.
The body was slightly inclined, with the
head raised and facing the passing
tlirong. The visage had a chalky white
ness and appeared to be unnaturally
shriveled. It was robed in the full vest
ments as the Roman public knew- the
Pontiff in life. Around the bier-burned
thirteen high candles, while on each side
stood the Noble Guard, motionless. Far
ther back were kneeling priests and aco
lytes, softly Intoning invocations.
The crowd pushed against the iron trel
lis which separates the chapel from the
main portion of the church, but those
who expected to kiss the slippered feet
were disappointed, as__the officials had
adopted precautionary measures, so that
the lower extremities of the body were
half a yard back of the iron grating.
All ranks and stations of life were rep
resented in the throng. Many were work
ing people; there were also groups of
convent girls," under the care of nuns, and
of schoolboys, headed, by priests. Crowds
continued to pass ucfore the bier through
out the morning.
THRONG PAST THE DEAD.
At the sound of the first bell two regi
ments of Italian grenadiers marched
smartly across the piazza to the stone
steps and soon the east t portico swarmed
for the first time in years with Italian
troopsâ 300 on the portico and 1200 sur
rounding the colonnades. The grenadiers
wore long blue service coats and peaked
caps. They stood In double column at
parade rest, the lines extending from the
threshold of the church through a nar
row gateway of a temporary wooden
structure, which was holding back the
crowds.
At five minutes after 6 o'clock the gate
was opened and the human tide began to
flow in. The. jam at the narrow entrance
soon became terrific, threatening serious
results to the struggling mass of half
fainting women and children. Although
the crowd was not extraordinarily large,
the steady movement into the funnel-like
lnclosure made the pressure terrific. Many
women had their dresses or veils torn off
and some were lined, exhausted, over
the wooden indoeure and out of the
crush. Fortunately there were no serious
accidents and the ambulances were not
summoned. ;V ';'-." '

clergy, but to-day the doors were opened

the piazza throughout the hot night in
order to gain a place at the head of the
line. By 5 o'clock this morning there was
a crowd of several hundred, which had
increased by 6 o'clock to several thou

Elaborate preparations had been made
to guard against accidents in the crush.
All converging streets -were cleared of ve

been erected, including one at the en

the door of St. Peter's.

bell beginning in the high notes and the
chimes running down through the scale
until a deep bass stroke had completed
the minor chord.

LONDON, July 3.â The French Sen
ator* and Deputies representing the ln
tTna-tlonal arbitration prrmip, accompa
nied by a namber of British members of
Parliament, were formally received to
day by Lord Mayor Samuel and, the Lady
Mayoress at the Mansion House. The
Lord Mayor and Baron d'Estoumelles de
Constant, leader of the visiting delega
tion, made speeches, daring which they
reiterated and emphasised the desire for
continued International friendship and the
conclusion of a treaty of arbitration. ThÂ«
Frenchmen afterward visited ihe Ftock
Exchange and the financial district-
It is understood that the probable result
of thÂ« French legislators' visit to London
will be the formation of a Franco-British
arbitration agreement, independent of
The Hague court. It is believed the oc
casion Is ripe for such a step. Baron

Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
ROME. July 23.â To-day's meeting
of the College of Cardinals again
contained some obvious signifi
cance, bearing upon the probable
action of the conclave.
It is estimated that Cardinal Rampolla's
total strength dors not exceed twenty
two votes. Cardinal Rampolla will re-
reive several votes on the first ballot
which probably will not be cast for him
subsequently. These votes will be by
Cardinals who are largely Indebted to
him for their red hats.
Cardinal Vannutelli. who for the past
two years has opposed Cardinal Rampol
la's French policy, is training some Ital
ian support on th1(Â« account. Cardinal
Vannutelli's candidacy I is certainly the
moÂ« active at the present moment. -
It seems probable that when the con
clave meets the situation will be reduced
to three prominent candidatesâ Cardinals
Vannutelii, Oreglia and Rantpolla. It
would not be difficult as a compromise to
consolidate the Vannutelli and Oreglia
forces, perhaps upon Cardinal Oreglia and
possibly upon pome one not yet named,
but even then It would be necessary to
weaken Cardinal Ramnolla's present
solid support in order* to eecure the neces
sary two-thirds. The indications are that
it would be hardly reasonable to expect
fein election in such a sMort thne as at
the conclave of 1S78.
Cardinals Oreglia and Rampolla ore In
disposed, but the Illness of neither is
serious.
The commission of Cardinals intrusted
with the arrangements for the conclave
iias presented a plan which involves an
expenditure of $1400 and assures that
everything will be in readiness for the
opening of the conclave on July 31. The
apartment etlll occupied by Cardinal
Rampolla will be divided into four rooms
in order to accommodate four of the Car
dinals during the conclave.
Now that the Pope's will has been
opened the work of removing the things
in his apartment which he bequeathed by
the terms of the Instrument has. been be
gun. If the new. Pontiff desires to occupy
the Fame apartment only the bedroom
furniture will be changed. Following an
ancient cuptom, however, the new Pope
will not take possession of the old apart
ment until several months after his elec
tion.

Prior to leaving the Vice Regal lodgs
his Majesty presented colors to the Royal
Hibernian militia school.
The King and Queen held special court
at the castle last night in the famous
St. Patrick Hall, which was gorgeously
decorated and illuminated for the occa
sion. Their Majesties entered the hall
at 7:03 p. m., with all the accompaniments
of state and took their places near tbft
throne, which was the center of a bril
liant group. Including the Duke and
Duchess of Connaugh and Earl Dudley
and other high state officers in full uni
form. There they received the most rep
resentative body of the Irish nobility and
the Irish people which had been seen at
the castle in many years. Queen Alex
andra wore a cream-colored gown, em
broidered with gold. She wore vari-col
ored jewels In the form of shamrocks and
her diamond ornaments were set in de
signs of rose, thistle and shamrock.
The influence of the sovereigns secured
a social union which English statesmen
had vainly sought to attain. The Irish

the grand staircase was lined with lan

VICTORIA. B. C, July 23.â Captain
Thomas HorwaVd of this city, who was
"presumably murdered in Berkeley, Cal.,
on Saturday, was prominent in Canadian
affairs, he haying been paymaster in the
Red River expedition and provincial
Treasurer in the Clark administration,
the first government of Manitoba. He
was once a leader ln v Montreal society in
the sixties, prominent in all social events
and a universal favorite, no fashionable
affair being complete without him. He
was one of the founders of the St. James"
Club, the most exclusive in the Canadian
metropolis. He held a command in the
Victoria Rifles, Montreal's crack volun
teer regiment.
In 1869 on the outbreak of the rebellion

politics and held the office of Minister of
Public Works," Provincial Secretary and
Provincial Treasurer at different times

province.
.; In 1875 Captain Howard retired from*
active political ] life and' embarked in
business in Winnipeg as . a. forwarder. In
which ' he was very successful for ; some
years. Early in the eighties he,; returned
to Montreal, where he carried ' on - a

Mr. Kelly then showed the correspond
ent nine other checks for sums aggregat
ing $2250, which he said he sent Lee be
tween November 21, 1901, and December
14.1902.- \v3 "â¢;â¢:Â¦ Â¦
This Kelly refused to do.
"Now," said Kelly, "if I attempted to
bribe Lee In that instance, why didn't he
mention all the checks of a similar nature
that I had sent to him?"
"I don't consider," replied Kelly,' "that
you have done anything for me, but I
guess I can let you have a thousand.".
When Kelly reached St. Louis a week
later he handed the $1000 check to Rob
ert E. Lee at the Planters' Hotel.
March 31, -1903, Kelly received the fol
lowing written note from John A. Lee:
"Paper you gave Bob cannot be used at
present; I will have it returned and you
can send New York exchange payable to
Mrs. Lee."
March 26, 1S03, Lee went to the office of
the- American Queen, the organ of the
National Health Society, In New York
and, according to Kelly, Lee said: --j
"You know, Kelly, you promised me
some money and I think I ought to_ have
It."
Lee declared to Attorney General Crow
that he understood this was bribe money,
but that he refused to accept It. Lee
held the check for two weeks before
turning it over to the authorities. }S::'i
Kelly says that from the. time the 1903
legislative session opened Lee begged him
by wire and letter to let him have some
money. He was sorry for Lee's distress,
but he thought he had given him enough
during the preceding two years and was
tired oS supplying his financial wants.
D. J. Kelly gave to the Post- Dispatch
to-day for the first time his story of the
$1000 check dated March 27, which was
handed to Robert Lee for his brother,
John A. Lee, formerly Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Â¦ and upon which the two indict

bribery are based. r * 1*

PERSONAL MENTION.
Dr. Foute was called to Grace parish in
ISS* and remained tbeTe continuously un
til the time of his death. Through his in
fluence the establishment of the Armltage
And Maria' Kip orphanages and St. Luke's
Hospital was accomplished. His persist
ent work raised his parish to the first
place In the diooese.-
During the general convention of the
Episcopal church In this city last year
Dr. Foute's name was prominently men
tioned for the Bishopric of Hawaii, but
he expressed his desire to remain a priest
yith his parish and the honor was conse
quently given to another. . %-^x
Dr. Foute is survived by a widow, a son
and a daughter. The funeral services will
be held at Grace Church to-morrow at 2
p. m. The interment will be at ~ Cypress
Lawn Cemetery. Bishop Nichols will con
duct the services. . Â¦- ""*,Â»â¢/.,
THE Rev. R. C. Foute, rector of
Grace Episcopal Church and one
of the most prominent Hgures In
this Episcopal diocese, passed
away peacefully shortly before 10
o'clock yesterday morning at his home on
California street. Paralysis was the cause
of death. Dr. Foute was stricken with
the disease some weeks ago, and the doc
tors abandoned hope from the outset.
The death of the well-known clergyman
Ti-as peaceful and was not marked by
pain or suffering. After his affliction he
became semi-conscious and remained so
to the last. He was surrounded by the
members of his family when the last sum
mons came.*
Rev. R. C. Foute was of Southern birth.
His parents were wealthy land owners in
Georgia and as a youth Foute was given
every advantage of education.
When the Civil "War broke . out the
young man instantly linked his fortunes
vrith the Southern cause and became a
petty, officer in the Confederate navy-
After a. thrilling chapter of adventures on
Southern privateers Koute became s, mem
ber of the crew of the ram Mer
rimac and participated in the famous sea
fight between the Federal monitor and
the Merrimac
After the war had come to a close with
the surrender of I_%e at Appomattoz Foute
was one of the persistent guerrilla band
who essayed to prolong the struggle In
the far South. To escape capture by the
Northern troops he crossed the gulf to
Mexico In an open boat and there re
mained until affairs had quietedr
Once more a man of peace, Foute turned
his eyes toward the ministry and was or
dained a - priest I in the Episcopalian
church. <j Â¦
Between August .1. 1902. and July 1, 1003,
I have laken 209 written applications for work.
In addition to this I have had at least 200
applicants from whom , I , have taken no writ
ten applications. These applications cover
every, occupation" in which I employ men. I
have had fourteen applications for grip re
pairers by men. who had some exoerlence in
this - line. I . have only thirteen grip repairers
employed at the present time. - In addition -to
this I have had a :. great many applications
for grip repairers by men who have been help
ers In blacksmith shops and â¢ machine . shops.
This class of- men are very, desirable for grip
repairers. As for laborers, not a day passes
but what I have at least two or - three ap
plications -: of that-kind for .work. â¢ I -.-have* not
had any. trouble in getting any kind of help
since . I . have been In - San Francisco. .When
ever a . man left Â¦Â¦ there have : been from three
to ten men applying for the position.
The case will be resumed at 10 o'clock
this morning. \
Directly over the motor-man's head and
within his Immediate reach is located what
is known as the "circuit breaker." When
the motorman . throws on too much power the
circuit breaker blows open. When this hap
pens he - simply reaches up and pushes the
switch handle back to its original position,
making the circuit ! thereby. Other cars not
equipped with circuit breakers are equipped
with fuses made of soft copper or lead wire.
When the motorman turns-on too much power
this wire melts and so protects the* machinery
on the car. Replacing .this fuse merely con
sists in loosening â¢ the thumb screws, placing
a new fuse thereunder and screwing the same
up tight. If any extraordinary i accident hap
pens to a car the motorman Is not* expected to
make any repairs, . but his car. is - trailed or
pushed Into the carhouse, where a new. car
is given ' to the ~ crew and the : damaged car
Is placed in the : hands -. of the car repairers
under my charse. . '..
HOW TO RUN" CAR.
The duties of the laborers are about Identical
with: that of a section hand on a steam rail
road. The work of grip repairers and truck
repairers Is not laborious or continuous, for
they have during working hours considerable
leisure. The brakes on the cars of the United
Railroads are In first-class condition.'- * In ad
dition to the regular wheel brake most of
the cars are fitted with a track j brake. Both
are operated by a lever. " The lever brake,
the operation of which Is by n* means labor
ious, stops a car quicker . than an ordinary
ratchet brake, which is generally In use In
other cities. The cars are now maintained in
better condition- than heretofore.. We have
more men employed now taking care of brakes
on the same number of . cars than we had a
year ago.' Motormen are not required to study
electricity or make any repairs to broken
down cars. >
Any man of ordimary Intelligence can fill any
of the above-named occupations with from one
to four weeks' experience; the laborers need
no previous experience. Grip and truck re
pairers when first employed are paid at the
rate of 22 J /4 cents per hour and are Increased In
pay as they grow proficient in their duties; the
greater portion of the men employed have abso
lutely no experience when employed. . The work
is neither hard nor laborious and our climatic
conditions are such that the men are not ex
posed to extreme heat or extreme cold; practi
cally no time need be lost throughout the entire
year on account of climatic conditions. The
employment Itself is stead", with no layoffs for
a dull season. A large* portion of this work Is
done under roof; there is no danger connected
with the work and in a majority of the cases
the work is performed in the day time. .
The men in my department affected by the
demands of the Carmen's Union are but few in
number, to wit, 33, and consist of 6 truck re
pairers, 13 grip repairers, 7 laborers ' and 7
men engaged in assembling special track work,
which are by this company termed "track
men." <
Laborers In the employ of my department
number seven and receive $2 a day. Laborers
In Los Angeles receive $1 75 a day, and in San
Jose they receive $1 75 a day; in Seattle, $2
a day. Grip and car (truck) repairers get time
and a half for overtime: laborers also receive
time and a half for overtime. Free transporta
tion to and from work is also granted to all our
employes; this amounts to from $2 50 to $3 per
month.

PALO ALTO. July 23.â Palo Alto's
new Christian church is now
nearly completed. It was de
signed by Architect R. H. Walk
er and Is the first church of this
model to be built' anywhere. The church
is a long, one-story brick structure, very
pretty' in appearance and designed to
have just a suggestion of the old Califor
nia mission architecture. It. will now. ac
commodate 300 people comfortably, but
with a view to later needs for more space
the walls have been constructed very
thick and the roof made fb rest on them
without fastening." Later -the roof can be
removed and one or two stories. added. A
tower can bo" raised from the front bal
cony. Outside the clinker brick and stock
brick and the black 'and white mortar
give a decorative appearance, while inside
the great beams are finished in Flemish
green.
The dedication of the new church, which
is the seventh to be erected here, will oc
cur within -dk'o weeks. The pastor Is th'e

shoeing and general wagon work; from 18 to 19
years of age I worked in stores, on farms and
in blacksmith shops; from 19 to 23 years of
'age I attended Lafayette College, Eastern
Pennsylvania:' graduated as an electrical en
gineer In 1898. * During the summer vacations
of this latter period 1 1 worked as helper. In the
blacksmith shop and machine shops, also on
farms, waited on. tables. At the age of ' 23
years I entered street railway service of the
North 'Jersey Street Railway, Newark, New

and worked up 'gradually through successive
stages as wlrcnmn, controller 7 man, armature
winder, electrician, and chief clerk of thÂ« mas
ter mechanic's office; then assistant master
mechanic of the North Jersey Street Railway;
on September 10, 1901, I was appointed master

Pa.terson Street Railway Company; on January
1, 1902, I was appointed- master mechanic of
the North Jersey Street Railway, and on August

PAY MORE THAN ELSEWHERE.
1 am 28 years of 'Age .and have .open t a
greater part of my life since leaving school In
mechanical work.- From 14 to IS years of ago
I clerked -In a country store,' attended the nor
mal school at Mansfield,"- Pennsylvania,' for two
years- of that time preparing for college, : work
ing during vacation at blacksmlthlng, horse-"
F. F.Broder, master mechanic of the
United Railroads, was next called. He is
but 28 years of age and told' how he had
educated himself, worked on; farms and
"even waited 'on table to ' get -a practical
engineering course- at college. ' He' was
on the stand the balance of the day and
gave his testimony in a straightforward
manner. "Livernash attempted to get him
,to admit that, the seven , laborers *under
his jurisdiction needed a' certain amount
of skill to perform their duties, but Bro
der^stated positively a dozen times that
there wan always a foreman or an-as
sistant watching " the ; men while they
worked" in the company's yard. Broder's
testimony In part follows :
I am master mechanic of the United Rail
roads of San Francisco; as such officer, I have
under my charge and supervision: (1) All re
pairs on rolling titock; (2) preparing plan, and
specifications for new rolling stock: (3) repairs
on all buildings belonging to the company; (4)
shop work in the construction of special track
work: (5) repair work- on enarlne, boiler and
electrical equipment power . houses; : (6) ma
chine sliops; (7) electrical repair shops; and (8)
I hire and discharge aU men connected with
these several departments.. Â¦ Â¦
EDUCATED HIMSELF.
In the East it is necessary for platform' men
to provide themselves with winter and sum
mer suits, with rubber storm boots, coat cap,
Kloves and mufflers and heavier underwear.
The company here and now agrees that If Its
employes will purchase their uniforms at one
establishment to be named by it It will under
take to furnish proper uniforms made accord
ing to the specifications just referred to for $16
each or less â coat, vest and trousers t
I
. TherÂ« Is an. adequate supply of men, in fact
we have more applicants than we can accom
modate. . Â¦
The climatic conditions prevailing / in ' San
Francisco* are peculiarly advantageous to the
carmen. Tracks' blocked by snow and ice are
unknown; .blizzards, as they are known in the
Edit, never occur. The city is exceptionally
healthy and neither extreme heat nor cold pre
vail. > The streets along which cars are oper
ated are wide and offer exceptional advantages
for operation.
Employment on the qars is steady. A car
man having a regular run- may work every
day In the year if he chooses and may figure
upon a fixed income and regulate his living
expenses accordingly. There [ are no "lay
offs" or Idle days for lack of work.
Platform men are by the company granted
free transportation over the division upon
which they are employed whether In uniform
or other clothes upon presentation of their
badges, and when in full uniform are granted
free transportation over all' the lines within
the city limits. These concessions enable the
thrifty, carman to live In the outlying districts
If he chooses to do so.
I have also considered it highly important
that we should have the best possible sched
ules for the men so as to enable them to make
the maximum rate of wages within the â¢ best
hcurs possible, and for this reason I have
given the matter of timetables a great deal
of personal attention. The foregoing compari
son between the dally pay earned on the old
timetables and the new will bear, out the state
ment that our changes have been in the direc
tion of bettering the condition of the men and
increasing their earnings. It is a physical Im
possibility to make satisfactory timetables to
enable all men to earn the same sum. If you
make a flat scale of a given amount per diem
the short runs are overpaid â and short runs
are unavoidable. Â¦ . . Â¦. â¢ .- Â¦â¢â¢--.Â¦Â¦
Taking hours, wages and climatic condi
tions "into consideration I do not know of any
place superior to San Francisco for- carmen's
work. As will be witnessed by the schedule
Introduced here as United Railroads' exhibit
No. 8 that exhibit shows that under the old
timetables no platform man was earning as
high as $2 75 per day. We now have twenty
eight runs that' pay-, fifty-six men $2 75 per
day. ' Under the old timetable but eleven runs
paid $2 70 per day; we have seventy-six such
runs. Involving 152 men. Under the old time
tables but two runs paid $2 G5 per day; we
have 103 such runs and therefore 200 men
drawing that pay. Under the old timetables
but three runs paid but $2 60 per day; we have
114 such runs and 228 men drawing such pay.
Under the old timetables but' twenty-five runs
paid $2 55 per day; we have 142 such runs
and 284 men drawing such pay. Under the

EABN GOOD WAGES.
In all the years of my railroad experience,
about eighteen in- number, I do not know of
any place where the conditions are so favor
able'for men to work on the cars, or where
the same i>ain* have - been taken- to 'give the
men the best timetables possible. I ' have
given this matter close personal attention so
as to - give to each man the highest possible
earnings.
The three chief requisites of a platform man
are carefulness, politeness and honesty, and if
I were called upon to add another qualifica
tion I would repeat "carefulness."
The 'knowledge necessary to start, run and
stop a car Is easily grasped. A man of aver
age intelligence and proper. ,, character will
make an acceptable platform man.
ââ¢ The foregoing applies equally to conductors,
more particularly the three essential require
ments, carefulness, politeness and honesty. <
The work required of a platform man is in
no sense skilled labor. The actual knowledge
necessary to operate an electric car may be
acquired In from one to three days' Instruc
tion, j
When a new table is posted the man oldest
In the service has the first choice and so on
down the list.
The United "Railroads of San Francisco has
in its employ 1835 motormen. conductors, grip
men and drivers known as platform mem
They are paid 25" cents per hour and 30 cents
per hour overtime. Overtime under, the pres
ent agreement is time , worked in excess of
eleven hours. On the 26th day of April. 1802,
the United Railroads entered into an agree
ment with its men that all regular runs shall
not exceed ten hours of actual work, the same
to be performed within fourteen hours. It was
found that in practical operation these hours
were unsatisfactory to the men, whereupon at
the request of the employes the company
amended the agreement and changed the hours
so as not to exceed eleven hours' actual work
to be performed . within ' fifteen hours. The
present carmen's demands call for a maxi
mum of nine hours' actual work (a decrease
of 18 2-11 per c-nt) to be performed. 60 per
cent within 10% hours and 35 per cent within
14 hours at $3 per day (an increase as to pay
33 1-3 per cent), overtime â that is time worked
over nine hours â to be paid for at the rate of
45 cents per hour (an Increase of 50 per cent).
Platform men who may be entitled to regular
runs are permitted to pick their runs from
the timetable in the order of their seniority,
and they retain the runs so selected so long
as that table is In effect.

The chief feature of the proceedings
was the evidence of Manager Chapman

I last saw him at 4 o'clock on thÂ» afternoon
of July 11. He had with him at that time
between $175 and $200. which I had advanced
to him. In coin, and he told me he had pur
chased his ticket for Victoria and was going
to leave that night by the Oregon express, at
8 o'clock. ' We shook hands and. he appeared in
fine spirits, and said he was going to the
Southern Pacific office to secure his berth
That was the last I saw of him, as I went out
of town that same evening. He had Interests
in Alaska, and I was contemplating joining
him In. some of his business ventures there.
He was happily married and devoted to his
family.
Knowing nothing to thÂ« contrary I -replied
to tlie message: "He lelt for the north some
time ngro." You can see how surprised I
must be to learn of the present situation of
affairs.
When I returned home to-night from the
south I found the following telegram awaiting
me: "Reported mishap. Is Captain Howard
well and safe?" Signed, Mrs. Howard Dal
las Hotel, Victoria.
Treanor tells the following story of his
knowledge of Captain Howard's move
ments:
According to Treanor's story Captain
Howard was in the city trying to dispose
of some mining claims in the Klondike.
He seemed short of money, and just be
fore leaving for his trip on the 11th
Treanor advanced him $175. At the time
Captain Howard told Treanor that he had
a ticket for Victoria and would shortly
leave for that place. Â¦ " %
J. B. Treanor, an insurance adjuster,
having an office at 501 Montgomery street,
was a chance acquaintance of the dead
man. He returned to the city last night
after an absence since July 11, and when
notified of the supposed murder In West
Berkeley and the identification from Van
couver confirmed the report that the body
in the Berkeley Morgue is that of Cap
tain Howard.
It has been, discovered that Captain
Howard was a 'guest at the Russ House
from. May 23 up to July 11, when he sud
denly dropped from sight, leaving, behind
him all his baggage and. an unpaid hotel
bill of $80. No importance was attached
to his disappearance since he had often
said. that he had to look aiter-Â«ome.Berke
ley property in the interest of a friend
in Canada and it was thought .that . he
was staying with friends across the bay.
When shown the intelligence from Vic
toria last night Head Clerk Powell of
the Russ House positively confirmed the
identification. He . confessed that he had
failed to associate Captain Howard with
the stories that have appeared in the
local fbapers about the unidentified dead
man in West Berkeley. Â¦
Charles Newman, the proprietor, tells
a story of Howard's allegations of unfair
dealing . on the part of some unknown
party in this city which may throw some
light on the mysterious end of the man.
He said last night:
Captain Howard was an exceedingly fine
gentleman. Â¦ He played a good ! game of 'bil
liards and we all liked him. [ He was always
very dignified, courteous and polite. He stated
he had a big deal on with parties having of
fices in the Mills building and he went there
every day to see them. He would often say
to me. "Those scoundrels, over there in tha
Mills bulldinir are trying to do me up, but
they won't do it. I have a fair proposition in
hand and they know it and they are trying
to get the best of me. but 'I know my rights
and I am going to have them."
The identification lsÂ«complete and the
body Â¦ thau was found behind Brennan's
barn, West Berkeley, last Saturday morn
ing, the skull fractured and pierced by
bullets, accounts for the disappearance of
the Victoria captain. Back of the dis
covery, 'perhaps, is the story of a crime.
This .is the theory of the police.
The Victoria authorities base their
claim of identification upon significance
of the few effects of the dead man which
could be used as evidence. Upon the body
was 'found a ring having as a crest a lion
holding an arrow. This, it seems, is the
Howard crest, and} advices from the
north say that Mrs. 4 Howard and her
daughter, are wearing the same seal in
their rings.
The laundry marks upon the linen of the
dead man, consisting of the initial "H."
and the . number 2326, have been proved
to be his initial and mark of the Victoria
Steam Laundry Company, which was as
signed to his linen when it was taken into
their establishment. A hotel clerk of the
Vernon and Dallas hotels of that city by
the name of Cave has told the Vancouver
authorities that; the foldlng'steel footrule
found on the body of the man in "West
Berkeley is^ undoubtedly the same one
that he had seen him. use many times.
According to Victoria advices, the
costume worn by Captain Howard was
similar in every detail to that described
by the newspapers of this city as having
been. worn by the victim of the thugs in
.West Berkeley, and there are still further
circumstances that tend to confirm the
identity of the deceased as Captain How
ard. On part of his under-clothing was
found the name of R. J. Tooke & Co., the
well-known Montreal haberdashers.. It is
said that when Captain Howard went
from Victoria to seek to dispose of his in
terests in hydraulic ground in the Yukon
it was to Montreal that he went, where
he was well and favorably known. It is
probable that he purchased the garments
in question when visiting the Eastern
Canadian city. It is stated that he wore
russet gloves, and in this connection those
who knew the dead man say that Captain
Howard almost invariably wore russet
gloves.
Berkeley's mysterious dead man was
Captain Thomas \ Howard of Victoria,
B. C. -This fact became known beyond
question last night ..through advices re
ceived from the police of Vancouver by
local police. â¢

WASHINGTON. July 22.â The State
Department has heard nothing recently

Manchurlan pirts refers to a phase of the
negotiations dating about two weeks back.
The reason for this suggestion Is a
knowledge on the part of the officials
here that before Secretary Hay's depart
ure for his summer home the Chinese
Government actually did pledge Itself to
open two or three more ports in Man
churia If. however, there has been any
change In the Chinese attitude since this
pledge was given, it Is said here that
the United States Government will not
be moved thereby, but. holdlfc fast to
the pledges already given, will insist on
their redemption.

DOUBTS PEKING ADVICES.
' The Duke of Devonshire, Conservative
leader in the House, retorted thut while
he gathered from the remarks that the
Premier ought to tell Mr. Chamberlain to
resign he feared that was a rather Illog
ical procedure since though the Govern
ment had by no means yet adopted the
views of the Colonial Secretary, the Gov
ernment's Investigation, so far cs It had
proceeded, had convinced the Premier and
his colleagues that Mr. Chamberlain's Im
peachment of the fiscal policy was well
founded and that changes ought to be
effected.
Earl Spencer added that if Mr. Cham
berlain remained In the Cabinet It would
be almost Impossible to dissociate his
views from the policy of the Government
as a whole.
The educational campaign on the tariff
programme which ' Colonial Secretary
Chamberlain -has vigorously launched by
means of leaflets and circulars came in
for serious criticism In the House of
Lords this afternoon. Earl Spencer, the
Liberal leader, \ complained that Mr.
Chamberlain was practically violating the
Government agreement, namely that the
fiscal discussion should be poscyened un
til October. He said the distribution of
such literature looked on its lace as
though the Government had taken up Mr.
Chamberlain's views.
subject. The Government had pledged
itself not to ask the country not to make
a change until after the general election
and premature and hasty parliamentary
debate could only produce divisions
among friends without benefiting the
country.

No man, Balfour said, had a better op
portunity than' Mr. Chamberlain of know

coins to gold could be had. The resolu
tions further recommend the gold-using
countries 'buying silver for subsidiary
coinage to observe regularity. The Ger
man delegates passed a resolution to the
effect that Germany does not need to buy
silver, having already about one hundred
millions above her requirements in cir
culation. The resolutions disclaim pro
moting bimetallism or any change in the
monetary system of the gold countries.,
The Americans and Mexicans express
satisfaction with the. results of the work
In Berlin. President Creel of the Mexican
commission said that if the project for a
uniform currency for China was soon car
ried out and the silver purchases of Eu
rope and the United States were made
regularly the fluctuations which have
been so injurious to the trade between the
silver and the gold countries will cease.
Representatives of the Chinese Govern
ment, who were present at the confer
ences at London. Paris and Berlin, ex
pressed approval of the proposition to
give China a uniform currency.
BERLIN, July 23.â The conferences of
the American and Mexican Monetary
Commission with the German committee
were concluded to-day. The promptness
with which the Government appointed the
German commissioners and their speed In
dispatching business enabled the Amer-^
leans to finish their work here In one
week, whereas they expected to remain
three weeks. The Americans and Mexicans
will proceed to 'St. Petersburg on Sunday.

Concludes Conference
Japan is reported to be furious over the
alleged advance of Russian troops into
Korea for the ostensible purpose of pro
tecting timber cutters employed in the
Korean forests. This is the most acute
question now Involved In the differences
between Russia and Japan. Recent re
ports that there had been an agreement
on the timber cutting matter which
would satisfy Japan's qualms were at
first credited here, but now it is said thar
Japan will be satisfied with nothing short
of the rellnqulshment by Russia of the
timber concessions.
WASHINGTON, July 23.â Very hopeful
feeling prevails here that the differences
between Japan and Russia will yield to
efforts now being made by neutral pow
ers to bring about a settlement. It Is
learned that Secretary Hay, realizing
that war between Russia and Japan was
not Improbable if conditions did not
change, has been using his good offices
to avert a conflict. On every occasion
presented he has not failed to urge upon
the representatives of the two govern
ments the necessity of maintaining peace
In the far East, where the consequences
of war might be to involve all civilized
powers in the most terrible struggle the
world has ever known.

policy of the Government, which, he said,
waÂ« strangely inconsistent. He. com
pared the recent visit of King Edward
to France and President Loubet's return
viFit to England with the Government's
attitude toward Germany, and accused
the Government of cringing to Germany
in the Venezuelan matter and of "allow
irjsr themselves to be hoodwinked." But,
Sir Charles added, when there was a
popular cry against Germany the Govern
ment had "hatched up the Canadian tariff
prievarce and lately the Ministers had

college men from the East to the wheat
fields of Kansas, with the intention of spending their
vacation in the merry task of harvesting the golden
grain. As the stories came to us from many sources
in the East and seemed like the beginnings of a
series of beautiful idylls, care was taken to point out
how glibly the rural papers of Kansas had taken to
combining harvest items and society gossip in one
sweet and charming mixture of business and
pleasure.
Later reports from the scene of theTiarvest festivi
ties are not so attractive as those earlier glowing:
ones. It appears that harvesting is not the jocund
task it was in the days when poets sang of it and
when it was carried on without the rush of ma
chinery. It has now become something of a hustle,
and it seems the college athletes, so far from being
able to perform it lightly and with graceful ease, are
being laid out prostrate all over the fields.
It would have been sad to learn that the. aspiring
youths had failed under any circumstances, but the
Kansas papers make bad things worse by saying that
the athletes of the East cannot even so much as
match the native girls. A Topeka report says:
"College students from Eastern States who are
working in the Kansas wheat fields have found that
they cannot keep up with the farmers' daughters
with whom they work. Several of the young men
have been compelled to stop work during the hottest
part of the day, but the girls and young women rest
only at night. Two Swedish girls in Edwards
County are said to have tired out four of the em
bryo athletes who came from New York. The girls
keep up with the binders in shocking wheat, and
the footsore young men are ; obliged to rest every
few minutes."

THE. Territory of Hawaii is in the enjoyment of
a high degree of self-government. It comes
high, but the people must have it. The appro
priations for carrying on the government amount to
$28 per head of population. For the government of
150,000 people the cost is $8,423,859 49 for two years.
The income to meet this is only $4,600,000 for the
same period. To meet the budget borrowing against
future taxes is proposed, but that is simply getting
income and outgo still farther apart. A tax of $28
per capita is probably the highest . levied by any
Government in the world. When local and municipal
taxes are added, annexation appears as the greatest
luxury on earth if measured by its cost. Neither
under the monarchy nor the missionary oligarchy of
Dole did taxation come anywhere near the present
figure.
The government purchased at so high a price does
not seem to justify its cost by its quality, for it is
not a very good government. If affairs go on at the
present pace the islands are bound to go heavily in
debt. When a career of extravagance is once begun
it is difficult to arrest the pace. In Hawaii, as else
where, there are large numbers of voters who are not
materially touched by taxation, but who touch the
results of taxation beneficially to themselves. These
are appealed to by a lavish policy of expenditure,
and their votes can be counted on to continue in
power any legislators who have excessively liberal
views on public expenditure. By and by there will
be an insolvent dependency on our hands, and Uncle
Sam will have to put his hand in his pocket to pay
the bills of his youngest daughter.

We would urge the collectors to secure liberal

In your collections all products of the county
are Included. We want fruit, grain, grasses,

produce of value.
When It Is known that the material Is col

ways and means will be found for getting it
to St. Louis and having It attractively In

Practical instructions to the counties of
California were sent out yesterday by the
California St. Louis Exposition Commis
sioners, over the signature of Secretary
B. B. Willis. The most important part of
the admonition is contained in a state
ment to the general effect that the coun
ties must hustle. They must employ col
lectors of samples to be" exhibited if they
wish to make a creditable showing. The
whole question of success or failure, so
say the .commissioners, depends upon the
employment of collectors. The counties
that have collectors are getting together
a lot of good material; those that have
no collectors are complaining of having
a hard time. A part of the circular of in
structions is as follows:
The California Bt. LouiÂ» "World's Fair Com
missioners desire to Impress upon county
World's Fair commltteemen the urgent neces
sity of providing- for active and energetic
county collectors. There Is no expenditure that
can be made which will produce better re
sults finally than the employment of a first
class man. Impressing upon him the duty of
collecting liberal samples of all the material
products of his county. Of course the com
mltteemen of the different counties are well
advised an to the products of their respective
counties, and know the season when they can
be moHtf conveniently and economically secured,
and the work in hand at present is to see that
these things are got together when they can
best be had.
Our belief is that & rood man put in the
field right now, if you have not already such
I a one In the field, can do more toward In
suring a good display of the county's products
at St. Louis next year by four months' active
work than can be obtained by the same ex
penditure In any other way. You cannot rely
on voluntary effort. Such a collector should
be selected by the county JVorld's Fair com
mittee, and his work should be outlined by
them, and he sh<Ai!d be required to report to
them at least once a week, or oftener. if de
sired, so that they may know what he Is do

to do In the oremlses. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, July 23.â Henry
Bush and Miss Nora Brown
ing: were married to-day at the
residence of the bride's parents.
The young couple will spend
their honeymoon In San Francisco and in
the southern part of the State.
The bride comes of the oldest and most
widely connected families In Yolo. She Is
the fourth daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R.
W. Browning, cultured, beautiful and
ranks as one of the belles of the county.
Mr. Bush Is a prominent young- mer
chant. He Is the second son of Judge E.
R. Bush, at one time Judge of the Supe
rior' Court. He Is a popular member of
the local parlor of Native Sons.
WHEN first the announcement was made
that the President had decided to call an ex
tra session of Congress in November to
consider the reciprocity treaty with Cuba and finan
cial legislation The Call predicted that the financial
issue, though placed second by the President, would
constitute virtually the whole interest in the session.
That opinion has been confirmed by the tone of pub
lic discussion since the announcement was made.
Very little has been said about the treaty, but upon
the question of financial legislation there has been
a running comment not only from the press but from
statesmen of both parties and of all sections of the
country.
Secretary Shaw on his return to Washington from
a conference with the President at Oyster Bay de
clined to be interviewed as to what the President
had said during the conference further than to con
firm the statements of Senator Lodge concerning the
extra session. He went on to intimate, however, that
in his judgment the Fooler bill as presented at the
late Congress has no chance of success owing to
the widespread objection to permitting banks to is
sue currency based upon assets. The Secretary also
expressed a conviction that the other bills before
the late Congress would share the fate of the Fowler
bill, and that something new would have to be pro
posed if there were fo be any reasonable hope of
financial legislation during the extra session.
Since the Secretary's statement there has been a
growing conviction at Washington that the Senate
committee will report a new bill substantially on
lines reported in The Call a few days ago. It will be
remembered that by the plan as outlined it is proposed
to authorize the issuance of "additional currency"
by national banks up to 25 per cent of the amount
of their capital. On this the Government would
place a tax of. say, 5 per cent per annum. Because
of this tax banks would only call for the additional
currency in time of greatest stringencyâ that is, inter
est on loans would have to be higher than 5 per cent
to induce a bank to go to the expense of issuing ad
ditional currency. The instant interest rates dropped
below 5 per cent this currency would retire automati
cally.
The opinion prevails in New York that the Presi
dent is keenly interested in the currency problem and
is really much more concerned for financial legisla
tion than for the Cuban treaty. Neither Senator
Lodge nor Secretary Shaw has spoken for the
President, but each has directed attention to state
ments made by him in a speech at Quincy during
his recent tour. In the course of that speech he
said: "It is well nigh universally admitted that our
currency system is wanting in elasticity; that is, the
volume does not respond to the varying needs of the
country as a whole, nor to the varying needs of
different localities. * * * Our currency laws need
such modification as will insure the parity of every
dollar coined or issued by the Government, and such
expansion and contraction of our currency as will
promptly and automatically respond to the varying
demands of commerce. Permanent increases would be
dangerous, permanent contraction ruinous; but the
needed elasticity must be brought about by provisions
which will permit both contraction and extraction as
the varying needs of the several communities and
business interests may require."
Those statements are in harmony with the opinions
of the business world, and the fact that they have
been recalled by men who have, just had a confer
ence with the President is everywhere construed as
San indirect way of informing the public of the Pres
ident's attitude toward the issue. It may then be
taken for granted that the administration, while
standing impartial as to different, measures proposed
for providing for a flexible currency, will none the
less exert all its influence to procure the enactment
of torne sort of relief measure. The outlook, in fact,
is premising. The Cuban treaty will probably oc
cupy very little time for consideration, and there
wil! thus be ample time for taking up the financial
question and settling it to the satisfaction of the
country before the regular session begins.

The industrial statistics, however, are much more
interesting than those 'relating to marriage. Setting
aside children and dealing only with persons of mar
riageable age, there are upward of 1,000,000 more
women than men in Great Britain, and as a conse- i
quence a considerable number of women must of
necessity earn their own living. The statistics show
that for every twenty-nine unmarried women* who
do not support themselves by work outside the home
there are thirty-two who do. Even among married
women one out of every seven earns her living by
work outside the home.
The result of this pressure for work among women
has been a steadily enlarging field s of occupation
open to them. The summary says: "A comparison
between these returns of women's employments in
1901 and the statistics give*n in the census returm
of fifty years before shows a striking change. In
185 1 there was practically no general occupation
open for women of the middle class except teaching.
Three hundred, it is true, were druggists, and 100
were engaged in literature. Now practically the
whole range of employment outside the army, the
navy and the law is open to both sexes *klike. Seven
thousand women now work as chemists; there are
nearly 300 women undertakers, 4000 work as butchers,
and three as slaughter-women. Fifty-eight of them
are bill discounters, twelve are shepherds and one is
the feminine equivalent of a woodman."
It appears there is no work too heavy for some
women to perform. Thousands of them work at the
pit heads of the mines, many more as blacksmiths
and in other metal trades, quite a number as barge
women and a considerable number as cokeburners.
The great mass of them are of course employed in
some kind of domestic service, but the better edu
cated are rapidly making their way in all forms of
professional life and in the civil service of the Gov
ernment.
The darker side of the statistics shows that up
ward of 77,000 women are in the poorhouses and
that about 45,000 of them formerly earned their own
living in some definite employment. Of these un
fortunates one out of every three was once a do
mestic servant. The report adds: "Nearly 13,000 of
these workhouse inmates were once charwomen or
laundresses. Four of them were once artists, four
photographers, 162 worked as women teachers, and
no fewer than 624 were once sick nurses. No woman
author seems, yet to have^come to the workhouse.
There is not a single actress or woman writer among
the 2844 women in the prisons to-day. No women
teachers are in prison, although twelve male teachers
are, and no women doctors, although sixteen male
doctors are incarcerated."
Dark as are the figures showing the proportion of
failure and poverty among the women workers of
Britain, it is evident that their situation is much bet
ter than that of their predecessors. They have won
recognition in the industrial world and are getting
better wages than in former years. The pace of im
provement may be slow, but it is nevertheless steady,
and the British working woman has no reason to be'
dissatisfied with the record she has made during the
last fifty years.
A SUMMARY of facts regarding woman and
her work in Great Britain has been recently
issued by the compilers of the census of 1901
and shows a number of interesting evidences of the
progress made by women in establishing themselves
as independent factors in the industrial world. In
cidentally it also reveals by statistics that when men
marry under 20 years of age they generally marry
women older than themselves; between 20 and 25
they marry women of about their own age, but after
that they nearly always choose a woman much
younger than themselves. ,

Geo. P. Rowell & Co.. advertising
agents, recommend advertisers to use the
dally papers axd believe the list named
above is as good a selection, so far as it
goes, as can be made.
IN the course of. its work of advertising the re
sources, industries, attractions and possibilities
of the State the California Promotion Committee
has' compiled, and published a new and timely
description of the 'State, under the title "Cali
fornia To-day." The volume comes as near
fulfilling the object aimed at as is possible
in a volume sufficiently compact to be eas
ily handled and read. , It will therefore serve as
a useful text-book in the important campaign of
education that has been undertaken to enlighten the
Eastern people with respect to California conditions.
Within the space of 192 pages the work reviews
every feature of California life from the achievements
of industry to the accomplishments of art and educa
tion. The volume is therefore fairly comprehensive,^
though of course the space <loes not admit of full
accounts and details of any particular section or
phase of life. The task of the writers has been sim
plified somewhat by the aid of artists, who have
contributed a series of photographs showing repre
sentative scenes in every section of the State. These
pictures not only ornament the work, but add to its
value as a medium of education, since they reveal
at a glance something of the beauty and the richness
of our landscapes that could not well be presented by
literary description.
The introduction to the volume justly says: "No
book of this size could do more than to satisfy in
terest in briefest detail; to point the way to knowl
edge that may be had for the asking; to refer to and
quote men whose authority in special lines is rec
ognized the world over; to give figures of Govern
ment and State officials; to tell of things from the
standpoint of the writers' experience; and last, but
above all, to present by finest reproductions of pho
tographs scenes of natural beauty, of industries, of
houses, of lands, factories, horses, cattle, dooryards,
dairies, racecourses, irrigation ditches, poultry yards,
business blocks, buildings in the chief cities, parks,
steamships, railroads, the thousand things that mean
much to one whose face is turned to the Farthest
Westâ all this is here attempted and accomplished in
reasonable measure."
That the work will at first impress the uninformed
Easterner as something of a glittering exaggeration
may be taken for granted. The most carefully mod
crated statement of California conditions must al
ways appear to those who are accustomed to the
lands and the climates of the East as a poetic descrip
tion of a fabled Arcadia. Still the general statements
of the work are so carefully backed up by definite
and specific facts and statistics as to reassure the
mind of any reader who gives the subject proper
thought and attention. These bear witness that if
the generalities of California life are glittering it is
because they have a right to glitter. There is no need
to attach glowing adjectives to them to adorn them.
The simplest statement of the facts, the plainest ar
ray of statistics, presents to the mind an idea of
wealth and of promise that no other land can
match.
Tlfe reader of the book is first called upon to note
that California is larger than all England and Scot
land combined; that all of New England, New York
and Pennsylvania may be "laid out in California's
giant area"; that the people who have settled
within its borders and laid the foundations of 'its
civilization are among the most progressive of Amer
icans and have achieved much not only in the way
of producing material wealth, hut in art, science and
letters.
Ample stress, too, is laid upon the important fact
that "Northern" and "Southern" California aro
geographical terms merely and do not mark any
sharp distinction of soil or climate or product; that
the olive, the orange, the fig and the prune are grown
in the northern counties as well as in the south; that
the winters of Northern are as mild as>
those of the southern section, while the southern
summers are as pleasant as those of the north.
The industrial features of the State naturally form
the chief theme of the volume, for it is designed to
bring workers and investors to the State, but other
attractions are not overlooked. In fact, as has been
stated, the work is a valuable addition to our de
scriptive literature and merits a wide circulation.
It is to be hoped the people generally will assist the
Promotion Committee in circulating it wherever it
may do pood.

Late yesterday afternoon a notice of an
appeal from the decision was filed by
Attorney H. C. McPike, who represents
the Bwell-Aubertlne faction.
Ordered peremptory writ issue.
The case of McDonald vs. Hlnton does not
militate against the position taken here. In
that case the Supreme Court used this lan
guage: "If tha issue presented here, whether
or not the convention which the petitioners
represent was the convention which In fact rep
resented the Democratic party, then this court
would have to consider whether or 'not it would,
upon mandamus, hear evidence, and, after a
trial thereof, Itself determine the essential fact
In dispute. But this proceeding was submitted
upon the admission that the convention repre
sented by petitioners only claimed to be, but
was not, a convention representing said local
party, and upon the theory that the registrar
was bound to file their certificate merely be
cause It was in due and regular form. There
fore, the question whether this court ehbuld,
upon mandamus. Inquire into the fact and de
termine whether said convention did or did not
represent said political party Is not before us."
In the case at bar petitioners not only
claimed, but established, if my view of tha
law Is correct, that they represented thÂ« Union
Labor party, and under such circumstances,
following the doctrine of McDonald vs. Hlnton,
mandamus will lie.
Such being the caee, mandamus will 11Â«. I
do not believe that the Board of Election Com
missioners has discretion, these thing* being
shown, to deny the application of the petition
ers.
MANDAMUS WILL LIE.
If the contention of tha petitioners in this
case is true, the application presented by them
to the Board of Election Commissioners waa
presented on behalf of the Union Labor party.
It requested a designation upon the primary
ballot and set out an apportionment of dele
gates to the convention Intended to be held. So
far as the name Is concerned this proceeding
is unnecessary, for a place and designation for
the party have been ordered assigned on the
ticket by respondents. But the apportionment,
when made as required by law, becomes thÂ«
basis of the convention which 1' to follow the
primary, and only those delegates selected In
accordance with such apportionment become the
duly authorized delegates of the party.
It will be seen, therefore, that the acceptance
of the petition and the placing of the designa
tion of the party upon the ballot in accordance
therewith are essential to tha existence of a
legal convention. In this case it was undented
that the Union Labor party came Into existence
In 1001 by a nominating petition; that the
Union Labor party participated In the primary
of 1002, and elected delegates to tha local con
vention, at which convention candidates for
office were regularly nominated and a govern
ing committee duly and regularly chosen,
which committee'has continued in existence un
til this time, and of which the petitioners are,
respectively, the chairman and secretary. The
committee coming from such convention Is the
committee authorized by law to govern thÂ«
party and It must be considered the represen
tative of the organization.
REQUEST DESIGNATION.
It Is claimed by respondents that they hav*
already done those things which by law they
are required, and by the petition for this writ
oi mandate they are requested, to do. namely,
that they have given a place to the name
"Union Labor party" upon the primary ballot,
and that they have received a petition, pur
porting to be presented on behalf of the party
by its duly constituted authorities, apportioning
the delegates to the coming- local convention.
The law does not require-* the board to ap
portion delegates unless the petition presented
to it falls to make art apportionment; and It la
contended that the Commissioners have no
action to take In respect to the apportionment
of delegates. But under the provisions of the
statute no convention is a legal convention un
less it be organized in conformity with the
law; and to be a lecal convention it is pre
scribed, among other things, that it shall pro
ceed from a primary election of the party, at
which its name appeared upon the ballot conse
quent upon a petition presented by the party
and apportioning delegates. It becomes Impor
tant and necessary, then to determine which
of several petitions contains the apportionment
made by the party; for It is only a convention,
as I have said before, held in accordance with
such petition, having delegates apportioned In
the manner set forth and by the party itself,
which is a legal convention and from which
legal nominations may be made.
GAVE PLACE TO PARTY.
He holds that mandamus lies In such a
case, and that the Commissioners went
beyond their power, In view of the facts
shown, in granting the petition of Ewell
and Aubertine. The court's opinion Is as
follows:
August Harders and Samuel Berger,
respectively chairman and secretary of
the governing committee of the Union
Labor party, have established In the
courts their right to. a place on the ticket
â¢at the coming primary, notwithstanding
that the Board of Election Commissioners
decided that the Ewell-Aubertine faction
had first call on the place. Judge Mur
asky decided yesterday that their com
mittee was the bona fide governing body
of the Union Labor party, selected In
1901, and continued^ In power up to the
present. In accordance with the decision
the court ordered that a writ of mandate
Issue, directing the Commissioners to
grant the petition of Harders and Berger
for the placing upon the primary ballot
of the names of the delegates to be elected
to the Union Labor party convention for
the nomination of candidates for muni
cipal offices. ;
Murasky's opinion Is a short one and
deals principally with the question of
whether mandamus would lie in the case
at bar and whether the board has the
right to use its discretion in dealing with
petitions.
Says Ewell-Aubertine Faction
Does Not Represent
Labor Party.
Hearing of the charges against Police
man W. T. Hooper, charged with making

Gallant "Jack" Stelzner, the policeman
who dragged little George Clark from be
neath the wheels of a Geary-street car at
the Imminent risk of his own life on July
16, was the center of Interest at the meet
ing of the Police Commission yesterday
afternoon. He was present to receive as
a testimonial for his bravery a handsome
gold watch presented by Colonel A. An
drews. The colonel made the presentation
and at the - conclusion of his remarks
the token was banded to the abashed
policeman amid the prolonged applause of
the few present at the meeting.
Commissioner Howell thanked Colonel
Ahdrewi on behalf of the commission and
expressed that body's gratification at the
interest taken in the department by pri
vate citizens. .Commissioner Hutton, as
acting chairman, congratulated the patrol
man on his heroic conduct and hoped that
his future record would be In keeping:
with the brilliant deed.
Previously a letter had been read from
Dr. C. H. Carlson, who was a passenger
on the car when the accident occurred, in
which was given a graphic description of
the occurrence and a high tribute was
paid to the hazard which the policeman
ran. Horace G. Platt, president of the
Geary-street Railroad, also wrote, ex
pressing the appreciation of the company
for the rescue.
Policeman Charles "W. Goodwin ten
dered his resignation to the commission.
It was accepted.
Policeman \V. F. Kruger was convicted
of abusing Joseph Desmond while con
veying him from Sixth and Market streets
to the City Hall In a patrol wagon after
he had arrested him and was flne,d $100.

conviction.

In the Democratic party the apportion
ment designated by the regular county
committee, of which Jasper McDonald is
chairman and Gavin McNab "the power
behind the throne," seems to afford gen
eral satisfaction. All signs point to a hot
mix-up at the primary election, for future
control of the Democratic works. The
Regulars and the Horse and Carters are so
busy In the enrollment of voters that
they have no time to Interfere In the con
cerns of the Republican party. Prospects
of Republican success at the ensuing
municipal election are daily growing
brighter. Clubs are manifesting activity
In the work of enrollment. The duty of
nominating men to serve as delegates to
the convention is at hand. A convention
composed of representative, tax-paying
citizens and chosen at the primary elec
tion under the auspices of the Republican
party ought to be able to put forward
the winning ticket.
A meeting of Democrats under the aus
pices of the County Committee of the
party will be held in the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District at the corner of Twen
ty-fourth and Church streets this even
ing. The regularity of the proceedings Is
attested by the fact that J. J. Sullivan
calls the meeting.
Martin Kelly raised the point that the
Republican convention of 1902 refused to
create a new county committee or to pro
long the life of the existing one. The con
clusion was drawn . that no governing
body existed. The Election Commission
ers were asked to fix a flat representation
of twenty-five delegates for each district.
The request was denied. The court sus
tains the commission In Its' denial. Kelly
and his followers, however, can make
their fight for recognition at the primary
election on August 1L .
The decision of the courts, however, will
not settle the question of supremacy In
the Union Labor party. The battle for
the control of the convention will be
fought at the primary election. In order
that each faction may vote for an equal
number of delegates in the respective As
sembly districts the question of appor
tionment should be adjusted at once. It
Is not Improbable that Eugene E. Schmitz
and Michael Casey may be Induced to ad-
Just the differences by arbitration.
The 'Superior Court, as expected,
promptly recognized the Republican Coun
ty Committee of which Thomas D. Rlor
dan is chairman and Clifford McClellan
secretary as the governing body of the
Republican party of San Franoisco. The
apportionment made by this committee
was fair and equitable, the representation
being based, as the law requires, 'on the
party vote cast at the "last preceding
election."
Of course, It happens now that the dis
tricts which voted â¢ largely in favor of
Franklin K. Lane for Governor In 1902
will not have very large representation in
the Republican municipal convention of
1003.

A telegram from Helper. Utah, Inter
rupted guardianship proceedings before
Judge Murasky, sitting for Judge Troutt
yesterday, and caused a postponement of
a week of the hearing of the Detltion of
J. V. Miller to be appointed guardian of
the person and estate of his six-year-old
daughter, Margaret.
The telegram was from Lauja F. Mil
ler^ mother of the little girl and Miller's
divorced wife. It was addressed to the
clerk of the court and requested a post
ponement cf the hearing until such time
as she could appear and contest Miller's
petition. Shu accused him of kidnaping
the Utt'e onÂ«.
It seems that the Millers formerly re
sided in this city. Little more than two
years ago Mrs. Miller went to Utah and
obtained a divorce. She was awarded
the custody of their one child. Several
months after obtaining the decree she
married again and a few weeks ano'came
to this citv on a visit, bringing the
child with her. She secured rooms
with a family at North Beach. The
father learned of her presence here and
determined to secure custody of the child
and commenced guardianship proceed
ings. The people with whom the former
Mrs. Miller was staying were served with
the papers and when she came to take
the child home to Utah they refused to
give her up. fearing the law. The mother
went home to Utah without the child and
Miller reckoned on getting the custody
without further trouble. That he will
have trouble is evidenced by yesterday's
telegTam and the announcement that his
former wife Is prepared to return to this
city and give him a contest for the little
girl.
Decision in the San Rafael
Case Will Affect Many
C TT-.ers.
Special Dtsv*XÂ£h to The Call
SAN RAFAEL. July 23.â The Bollnas
land case occupied the attention of Judge
Lennon in the Superior Court of Marin
egaln to-day. It was the third day's
session of court In this case and from
present indications the trial will con
sume several weeks. The testimony is re
plete with stories cf pioneer times at
Bollnas. .
The settlement of the case is anxiously
awaited and the decision will affect many
of the residents of the northern part of
the county and especially some citizens
of Bolinas. It is an action brought to de
termine the boundary line of about ISO
acres of land as wt!l as the title to the
property on the bay shore. If the defend
ants casnot retain control of the property
nearly COO acres of tide land will be in
volved and a host of families will be
ousted from, their homes.
The euit, which is entitled Adams vs.
P. Mulvasey et al.. Is the outgrowth of a
contention as to whether the original
pater.ts on these tide lands, as given by
the Government, are not legally worth
less. The land is situated Just west of the
town of Bollnas and Includes a peninsula
known as the "Aranal." The original
patents were taken out In 18S0, but not
until very recent years was the property
thought to be of any value. Since
IJollr.as has become a popular summer re
sort people settled upon this sand beach
and subsequently discovered that there
was a flaw In the title. They retained
possession of the land and now action has
been brought in order to try to eject
them.
Borne of the oldest residents in the
county are the chief witnesses in the
case. M. Briones. who has lived in Bo
linas clnce 1S3S. occupied the witness chair
the greater portion of the day. He testi
fied as to the condition of the land in
early days, as well as changes in the
lopogTaphy in recent years.
State Prison Director J. H. Wilkins wÂ«
also an Important witness. He made a
purvey of the property many years ago.
Albertus Atkins Becomes a Benedict.
Yesterday afternoon, at the residence of
the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. D.
Hall. 306 Noe street, Mr. Albertus Atkins
of the Examiner was married to Mrs.
Anna D. Sangster.
The wedding was a quiet one, only the
immediate relatives of the contracting
parties being present.
Mr. Atkins has been for eighteen years
a valued employe of the Examiner in Its
advertising department, and a great
measure of the popularity of its classified
ad pages has been brought about by his
genial personality and persistent effort.
The manager of the Examiner and the
business office staff sent a very elaborate
wedding gift as a testimonial of the high
esteem In which Mr. Atkins is held by
them.
Mr. and Mrs. Atkins left for the south
last evening for an extended honeymoon
trip.
Martin Kelly went down to defeat yes
terday in Judge Murasky's court when a
decision was handed own in the case of
N. C. Coghlan, chairman of the so-called
Regular Republican organization, against
the Election Commissioners was decided.
The court decided that Coghlan was not
entitled to a writ of mandate compell
ing the Board of Election Commissioners
to grant his petition to place on the
ticket to be used at the coming primary^
election the names of prospective dele
gates selected by the petitioner as head
of the Martin Kelly faction of the Re
publican party.
The suit was opposed by the United Re
publican League, the heads of which are
Abe Ruef and Tom Rlordan, and under
the decision of Murasky their petition, for
a place on the ballot for delegates of
their choice as the Regular Republican
party which was granted by the Com
missioners Is the only Republican pri
mary ticket. ,
Judge Murasky finds that the Legisla
ture evidently Intended by the primary
law to create a system by which the In
terests of political organizations might be
conserved. He finds that the law as it
stands provides that no names of candi
dates shall be placed upon a general elec
tion ticket except those of persons who
have been nominated by the convention
of a party which at the least preceding
general election polled at least 3 per cent
of the total vote cast, or whose names
have been presented to the Election Com
missioners In a petition signed by voters
equal in number to 3 per cent of the total
vote polled at such election. The conse
quence of these provisions, says the court,
is that even if the petition of the organi
zation represented by the petitioner were
to be granted a place upon the primary
ballot It would receive no benefit, not be
ing a party which had received any votes
at the last election. It would therefore be
compelled, notwithstanding that it had
held a convention, to present a petition
containing names of its nominees to the
Commissioners In order that they might
be placed upon the ballot.
The decision means that representation
on a primary election baJlot cannot under
the law be given to a party, or section of
a party, which does not date its exist
ence from a preceding election and did
not at such election receive 3 per cent of
the total vote cast at such election, or
which does not show, by petition, that
such representation is desired by 3 per
cent of the voters at such election.
Grand Juror Makes Good Excuse.
The citation directing: Alphonso Hlrsch,
a member of the Grand Jury, to appear
before Judge Murasky and show cause
why he should not be punished for con
tempt of court for falling to attend sev
eral meetings of the Grand Jury, was dis
charged yesterday. Hirsch having fur
nished proof that his absence was un
avoidable.

WHITE'S DEFALCATION
MTJST NOW BE SETTLED
City Attorney Lane advised Mayor
Schmitz yesterday that demand should
be made upon the surety companies which
gave the bonds of W. J. H. White, the ab
sconding cashier of the Board of Public
Works, for the full amount of his defal
cation. For any surplus not covered by
the bonds Lane advises that demand be
made upon all the members of the Board
of Public Works under â¢whom White
served. The opinion, which was filed in
response to a request for the Institution
cf legal proceedings, says:
The Board of Works changed In personnel
several times daring White's incumbency as
cashier cf the department. An eriort should
be made to ascertain how cAieh he embezzled
undÂ«=r each ec-t of officers, eo that specific de
tr.and could be made upon them for the amount
fo embezzled. This demand ehouia be made
before m2t is brought. Inasmuch as so consid
erable time naÂ« elapsed elnce the defalcation
was discovered, and I would iurrwt that th*
data required be secured and the demandi
here rugpeeted be rr.ede aa soon aa possible, to
the end that if the city la compelled to aue.
immediate action can be taken.

head of the turf Investment company that

followed by the dismissal of the seven
charges against him of .embezzlement by

The opponents of the Aubertlne faction
of the Union Labor party captured Mayor
Schmltz's meeting in tHe Thirty-second
Assembly District last night, i It was an
nounced at the Potrero yesterday after
noon that the Mayor would- address a
meeting at Maennerbund Hall on Twenty
fourth street and "Potrero avenue In the
evening. The Mayor was at the appointed
place on time, but soon learned that the
followers of the rival faction were In con
trol of affairs. When he attempted to
speak the leaders and claquers of the dis
turbing element shouted: "How is Willie
Hearst? What did he pay you for going
to New York and making Democratic
speeches? 'How do you like' Judge Mu
rasky?"
In vain the Mayor essayed to speak,
but his voice was drowned In the tumult.
.When he saw that the crowd of 100 had
assembled t'o break up h^is meeting he
.walked out of the hall and > went home to
reflect upon "man's ingratitude to man."

SANTA BARBARA, July 23.â The Santa
Barbara polo team defeated Burlinganle
at the Carrlllo-street track this afternoon
In one of the hottest games ever played
at the local grounds. The score was 3
to 2. The grandstand and every point of
vantage was filled with epectators. While
all the players put up a good game, the
star plays were made by Captain Thomas
A. Driscoll of Burlingame. who scored
two goals, and by Ernest Wickenden of
Santa Barbara, who made the three goals
for the local team. Driscoll distinguished
himself to-day by making a remarkable
drive through the lines, followed by a
score in the third period.
To Wickenden's great plays was due
the success of the local team, although
he received valuable assistance at criti
cal points. R. Cameron Rogers being
credited with the most brilliant assist of
the game. A collision occurred between
Rogers and Hudson in the third period,
in which both were thrown violently from
their horses. Neither was seriously In
jured.
After the third period the Santa Bar
bara team played on the defensive, realiz
ing it was only necessary to shut out
Burlingame to win.

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J., July
23.â A fluke and a shift of wind cheated
Shamrock III out of a victory in a drift
ing race with Shmarock I off Sandy Hook
lightship to-day, and gave the old boat
the first victory ever had over the new
cup challenger. The boat^ had drifted
about nine miles before the wind to the
turning mark with just enough wind to
keep tlwm moving when Shamrock I's
sails filled with wind and for twenty min
utes she slipped away, leaving her sister
racer almost becalmed. Beating back to
the finish line a shift of wind gave the old
boat an advantage. Shamrock I gained
five minutes by her good luck. She fin

Iberg inaugurated the bad fourth by
passing Wheeler. Smith forced him at
6econd and Just then Dillon * was there
with hla timely hit to right that chased
Smith to third, the latter taking second
on the throw in. The fielders played in
close for a double play. Cravath then
slammed one down to Shay, which the
latter could not get his mitts on.
Smith dashed home while this was In
progress and Dillon stole the third cush
ion. In the mixup that followed, Tommy
Leahy made a rather wide throw to third
to catch Dillon. The ball might have been
handled, but it was not, and so Dillon
made the plate and Cravath came aa far
as third. Then Ross bunted and Ham
Iberg fumbled the ball and Cravath hot
footed It to the pan with the- last tally.
It was in tho. third the Angels got in
wrong and allowed the only run to score
against them. Shay hit a grounder to
Toman, who threw it out to right field
Instead of into Dillon's mitt. Shay kept
running till he reached Â«econd. Then
Hall threw to Toman to catch the runner
off the bag and this time Jimmy let the
sphere go and Shay arrived on third.
Meany at this juncture made good with a
hit to center for the only local run.
Outside of the third and fourth innings
both teams fielded well and everything
was handled cleanly. Toman, as soon as
he settled down, was In rare form and got
everything In his territory; also^a few
In Smith's. The game was played in an
hour and twenty minutes, making it one
of the fastest of tho present season. The
score:
No one who witnessed Wednesday's.ex
hibition could, possibly believe It was the
same two teams who performed yester
day. The falling off in hitting was re
markable. It 13 safe to say the three lead
ing clubbers of the day before got more
hits on that occasion than the entire
eighteen men who vainly swung at the
leather* yesterday. -
To Hall belongs the credit of the Angel
victory beyond a doubt. During the en
tire nine innings of the game he was
never in danger of being walloped by the
home clubbers. In only two rounds did
they get any hits off the rural slabster.
But for Toman's kindly errors in the
third no native would have experienced
the pleasure of treading the path to the
home plate.
Iberg was a good one In every round
save tho fourth, when he went astray.
The entire team for a time seemed to fol
low his lead, till the Angels amassed thrco
runs. After this disastrous period no one
came over the pan and no one semed to
have a chance.
If the fates had kindly disposed of the
affable Mr. Hall In "some manner or form
then the home team would probably have
stood a chance to get Into the going oc
casionally yesterday at Recreation Park.
But Mr. Hall was there all thÂ© time and
the fates did not interfere at all, so there
was no hope left for Uncle and he went
under. The score: Los Angeles, S; San
Francisco. 1. " /

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEWPORT, R. I., July 23.â In" a race
for a special cup i to-day the Reliance
gave the Columbia the worst beating she
has ever sustained in a contest sailed
In a cood stiff*breeze. Sailing over a
course of , thirty-eight miles in length,
nearly twenty of which were dead to
windward, the new cujr yacht finished 13
minutes 49 seconds ahead' of the old cham
pion. - . ; ;.' . x
The Constitution went up to Bristol
last evening to have a new topmast put
Vn and' did not arrive here to-day until
too late to eo 'out to the starting "line.
For a few moments tiie older boat held
her own." but as soon as the .Reliance
got her. wind clear she shot through, the
lee of her rival and, crossing her bow
on the .next, tack, worked steadily out
to weather of her and. at the same time,
outfooted her rival. To give the Colum :
bia such a drubbing: in weather which
sharps said was Just suited to bring out
the old boat's speed, is "looked upon by
the yachtsmen here as nothing short of
a wonderful performance. â¢
Besides the special event for the 90-foot
ers there .were races for the. single stick
ers and schooner yachts of the New York
Yacht Club fleet that have not been
hauled out for cleaning since the annual
cruise becan.
The trophies were presented by Captain
John Jacob Astor and consisted of a cup
valued at $1000 for the schooners and one
worth $500 for the sloops, yawls and cut
ters.
Mr. Morgan, who steered the Columbia,
and Captain Barr of the Reliance had a
lively fight for the start and it resulted
In the amateur skipper gaining a de
cided advantage, although both craft
were more than two minutes behind the
handicap gun in getting away. The new
craft was handled so prettily that she
was but 39 seconds behind the Columbia
in starting. After further skillful hand
ling, at 12:06 the Reliance crossed the
Columbia's bow and took up the coveted
weather berth. From this time on it was
only a auestion of how, much the new
boat would beat the old one out to the
weather mark. The Reliance behaved
handsomely in the rough water and out
footed and outpointed her rival all the
time. Off Point Judith heavier seas were
encountered, but* the two racers made
easy way through them. The Reliance
drew away steadily and turned tho wind
ward mark at 1:31:34. I *
The Columbia wore around at 1:35:55,
four minutes and 20 seconds behind the
leader.' Adding the 39 seconds actual
start the old boat had over her rival, the
Reliance had beaten her an" even five
minutes In a 12\$ mile thresh to windward.
Spinnakers were set for the run to the
second turn and the Reliance increased
her lead in every mile. A slight fog was
encountered near the second, turn, but
Captain Barr had steered a true course
and hit the mark so exactly that he was
able to gibe around ahead of the Vigilant,
which had worked off to Â¦ the southward
of the turn. The Columbia also failed to
hit the mark, but was a little to the north
of her course when the Reliance passed
her on the way to the finish. It was a
close lay to the line from the second
turn, but the wind hauled to the west
ward still more and the Reliance was
obliged to mnke a short tack off shore
before she could fetch to the line.
The Ineomar- led- the schooner class
around the course but lost the prize to
the Elmira on time allowance. ! The Vig
ilant was the first or the single-stickers
to finish and as shejhas not been officially
measured her length compels her to make
big allowance to the other yachts in the
class. It Is flcured out that the , Isolde
takes the cup on time allowance. Sum

John J. Byrne, general passenger agent
of the Santa Fe at Los Angeles, who has
been in the city, for several days with
his wife, departed last evening for Lake
Tahoe, where he will enjoy a vacation.
The freight traffic representatives of the
Southern Pacific Company who have been
In conference at the railroad building for
the last two days finished their powwow
yesterday afternoon and a number of
the outside men started nome on the even
ing trains. The work accomplished has
no material effect upon the shippers, re
ferring mainly to a division of the haul
ing proceeds.
The Southern ,'801110 Company ha.s an
nounced thnt beginning with the new
month It will not permit passenger travel
on its frPlght trains, except on such
freight trains as are provided with pas
senger coaches. It aas been a practice
for some time to permit holders of scrip
or mileage books to use the freight trains
between regular stopping places, but this
privilege Is now to be abolished as a safe
guard against accidents which are more
likely to occur on the freight than on
the passenger trains. The new rule will
affect principally commercial travelers
who have been. in. the habit of taking ad
vantage of this method of getting over
a laree territory In a shorter time than
Is afforded them on the regular passenger
train.".
One of the. many changes that has fol
lowed the consolidation of the office? of
the various Gould lines throughout the
West-Is -the adoption of the title of "Rio
Grande System" as a future designation
for the Rio Grande & Western Railroad
and the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad.
Since they were consolidated the two
roads have continued to do business un
der separate names and have also been
operated under separate time schedules.
The latest Drlnted matter received here
combines the two roads under title named
and the Information has been sent to the
local agents that hereafter they will be
recognized as only part of one great sys
tem.
MADE ONE SYSTEM.
Shortly after President Martin Inaugu
rated the Improvement work along tha
bay end of the road and while the Santa
Fe and Southern Pacific were fighting for
a means of traffic between the bay of.
San Francisco and Eureka. It suddenly
became known that the Santa Fe. realiz
ing that It stood no show against thÂ©
Southern Pacific in forming an alliance
with the California Northwestern or pur
chasing the road from the Foster syn
dicate, had secured an option on the
North Shore road and might possibly util
ize that line as a means of reaching thÂ«
bay from the north, for the terminal point
of the road at Sausallto i3 regarded as
most advantageous for a project seeking
water connections. Later the Santa Fo
official? concluded that they would build
the entire way from Eureka and It there
fore abandoned Its option on the North
Shore road. In discussing this matter
yesterday President Martin stated that
the option was raised some time ago and
that his road was now free from any and
all bonds or options.
Patrick Campbell, the millionaire mining
man of Spokane, who 13 at present stop
ping at the Palace Hotel with his fam
ily, is seriously contemplating the con
struction of a Â«thirty-flve mile railroad
from Jacksonville, Or., south across the
California border line to a point In the
northwestern part of Siskiyou County.
known as Blue Ledge. He 1* at present
negotiating for a valuable copper prop
erty in the Blue Ledge district and al
ready has h!a mining partner, "Doc"
Reddy of Spokane, In the north examin
ing the mine, which Is located five miles
south of the northern boundary line of
this State. In the event of making tha
purchase it Is Campbell's intention to
build a road as a means of bringing hla
ore to market, and the only available
route Is from Blue Ledge to Jacksonville,
where by way of a branch road he will be
able to connect with the main line of the
Southern Pacific. He has had the ground
surveyed and estimates made as to the
cost of the thirty-five miles of road and
purposes going north to-morrow to look
over the ground himself. - .
OPTION IS NOW OFF.
The directors of the North Shore road
met yesterday afternoon and formally
levied an assessment of JS on the stock
of the company. It was decided to make
the assessment effective Immedlatelj and
the date of delinquency August 25.
It had been announced and generally
supposed that an assessment of 510 would
be levied, but that action on the matter
would be deferred until September, but
at yesterday's meeting It was one of the
first subjects taken up and disposed o.
at once. The board then entered upon a
discussion of the general Improvement of
the company's property, for which tha
money derived from the assessment la to
be used. In discussing the matter after
the meeting President Martin said: = - /;
When our company first took hold of thÂ«
North Shore road we did not ccntemplatÂ»
many Improvements which we have sine*
found absolutely necessary. Among thesÂ« I
may mention the additional terminal facllttle*
at Sausallto. which included the work of fl.l-
Ing In the water line at that point, tha buUd
1ns of rew and more commodious quarters for
passengers and overhauling thÂ« approach to
the terminal. The work had to be done, a
fact which all the directors fully appreciated.
and we went ahead with It. naturally ex
pecting to raise the money when the con
tracts were finished. The time being near at
hand for a settlement we levied an assess
ment to-<Jay and I do not believe any of thÂ»
shareholders will find fault when they realls*
the necessity of the improvements and tha
good results that are already accruing from
them.

Lectures on Rough Riders.
A graphic account of the gallant part
which the Rough Riders played In the
Spanish-American war was given by Pri
vate George C. King of B Troop before a
large audience in Golden Gate Hall last
night. The lecture was given for the
benefit -of the relief fund of Camp Gen
eral Fremont No. 14, Service Men of the
Spanish War. and a generous sum was
realized, as the audience filled the hall
to Us limits. Private King traced the
career of the crack fighters from the time
that the regiment was assembled bjt
Roosevelt at Ban Antonio through all of
its fights on Cuban poll and up to the
final camp at Montauk Point on Long
Island. With the use of ; many photo

Oakland' Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. July 23.
Leon >Lafleche, 18 years old, a telephone
company employe, was dragged off a bat
tery wagon this morning and brutally as
saulted by a gang of hoodlums at Third
and Webster streets. The .boy was beaten
and kicked on the head and so badly In
jured that it was with difficulty he made
his way back to the company's head
quarters. '
The /issnuU occurred at 9 o'clock. La
fleche had been sent out with the wagon
earlier In. the day to replenish the
batteries in telephones. Accompanying
the boy was an unarmed man. but the
crowd that swooped down upon the wagon
quickly overpowered the pair and gave
the youth a hard beating.
After the assailants had completed their
work they disappeared, leaving their vic
tim to get back to the telephone station
as best he could.
Lafleche was covered with blood from
a dozen cuts on his bead and face.
Â¦ The boy said he was not- doing line
men's work,' but was engaged solely on
batteries. He was able to recognize some
of the crowd that beat him and will swear
to warrants for their arrest â¢
This, is the first serious assault that has
occurred in Oakland since the telephone
linemen's strike began. There has been
much hooting and yelling at the telephone
company's men. but violence had not beeit
offered.- The company. In view of this
occurrence, has decided- to request Mayor
Olney to "order the police back to guard
the wagons. The Mayor withdrew, the
police upon the promise from the striking
linemen that no violence would follow.
Ed Davis of the Linemen's Union de
clares no strikers assaulted the boy.

The. third floor Is given over to the lodge
room and living-rooms for such members
as may desire to avail themselves of that
privilege.
The lodgeroom is a magnificent piece of
work. The station of the exalted ruler is
at the east end of the hall on a raised
stage, while opposite is an organ loft with
an excellent instrument The stations of
the lodge are chairs of the handsomest
hand-carved designs. In the center of the

four elks" antlers, at the end of each
prong being a small electric light, the ef

The decorations of the hall consist of two
full-antlered elks, a doe and a fawn, this
being the only lodge In the United States
that owns such a complete collection of
these animals.
There will be a formal opening of the
new building some time In September,

this coast. This is testified to by
those who have been through other rooms
and other quarters, even In San Francis
co, and it is the general opinion that the
Oakland Elks have exceeded everything
from Seattle to San Diego.
But the Oakland Elks are very proud of
their quarters, whether this claim be true
or not, and to-night the lodge moved from
the long-inadequate rooms on Broadway
to its own building on Fourteenth street,
just opposite* the terminus of the narrow
gauge ferry system.
The ceremonies were simple. The mem
bers ot the lodge convened at the old
lodge rooms, which had been dismantled,
and marched In a body from there to the
new rooms on Fourteenth street. There
the lodge reconvened, and after the tran
saction of a small amount of business
they resolved themselves Into a social ses
sion, when there were remarks by some
of the officers of the lodge. Exalted Ruler
H. C? Capwell and the leading: knight,
James M. Shanley. and Lecturing Knight
Ward M. Pelton were present and helped
to christen the new building.
There were no formal exercises, for the
fathers of Elkdom In Oakland were away.
George W. Reed and Dr. O. D. Hamlln are In
the south. Superior Judge H. A. Melvln and
State Senator G. R. Lukens are In attend,

For this reason the exercises to-night
were extemporaneous, though none the
less enjoyable.

lodge. It is a four-story building, owned '

She said her husband had beaten her and
she wanted to die. The husband called to

B. L. Fisherâ Mr. Worthington's statement
In The Call looks much like a "bogle man." I
would not close out my business because of a
trifling dispute with my customers. That is
the position of the Southern Pacific with re
spect to Its Alameda patrons, according to
Mr. Wcrthlngton. The company will not de
sert Its patrons. That would be expensive and
unwise. I think the ; railroad company will
stay with us and that we,wlll all be happy yet
Frank N. Dodd, Alameda Land Company
Alameda has two franchises to grant. The
Southern Pacific desires to secure these two
franchises. We do not care to give them away
for nothing and the Southern Pacific should
not expect to get them for nothing. That
would not be business. Let us get together
and strike a bargain that will be fair and
satisfactory -to all concerned. It seems to me
however,/ thax the Southern Pacific has us on
the hip/ It has no opposition here and evi
dently does not fear any. else its tone would
be more conciliatory. There is no question but
what free local travel made Alameda famous
to the outside world. It was a good adver
tisement to the city and Induced many people
to locate here. Its restoration would helD
Alameda wonderfully. elp
City Trustee Charles J. Hammondâ It is my
opinion that the railroad company will do right
by the people of Alameda If the people of Ala*
meda will do right by the railroad company
The five years which nearly 1600 residents have,
petitioned us to grant the franchises to the
Southern Pacific seem to me to be too short
I believe that many of those who signed the
petition, which also asks for the restoration of
free travel, realize now that five years Is not
long enough for franchises where such large
Interests and so much money and property are
Involved. It is my belief that the Southern
Pacific will accept the franchises on a twenty
or twenty-five year basis.
T. F. Balrd. secretary of the Board of Trade
â I was one of those who inaugurated the pub
lic discussion of the applications for franchises
filed by the Southern Pacific Company. Dis
cussion is good at times but again It may
work injury to a person or city if It is car
ried too far and descends to what s&vora of
demagegism. Much has been said on both
sldea. and personally I have done all that â¢ I
am going to do in the matter. Alameda one*
had free local travel and prospered. I would
like to see . It restored. I understand that
Berkeley has free local travel: why should not
Alameda be accorded the same privilege? As
I have said, the matter has been argued pro
and con and is now submitted to the" City
Trustees. What they will do will settle all
adtatlon, and the sooner It Is settled the bet
ter. This agitation Is Injuring Alameda In
the eyes of the outside world.
Trade: >
I read In The Call what '-Mr. Worthington
is reported to have said about the Southern
Pacific withdrawing its service and leaving
Alameda oil the map . if his company is not
granted the franchises which it seeks at the
hands of our City Trustees. I am certain that
Mr. Worthington is a far seeing gentleman and
a business man, but I am not inclined to be
lieve that he meant all that he is credited with
saying. We do not wish to sever our rela
tions with the Southern Pacific. We need its
tservlce and I. am satisfied that they want to'
retain our patronage and good will. That Is
as it should be. We do not desire to deal un
fairly by the railroad company, for no good
ever comes of being or of trying tope unfair.
All that we have asked In exchange for tie
valuable franchises that the Southern Pacific
has applied for is that no fares be charged on
local trains from High street to West Ala
meda on the south-side line and from Park
street station to Mastlclr station on the north
side line. This request was framed after sev
eral mass-meetings and a petition signed by
nearly 1SW residents is now' on file with the
City Trustees. They are to be the final Judges
and whatever action they may take with re
spect to the franchises will be binding. It
has been said that some of the meetings held
were not representative. If that is true I hopÂ«
that all citizens who consider themselves rep
resentative will come forward before this mat.
ter is settled and put themselves on record so
that there can be no regrets after all has been
disposed of.
City Trustee Dr. Henry May Pond â I have
not believed from the. beginning; of the fran
chise agitation that the Southern Pacific Com
pany would accept any franchises on terms of
five years. If I were a business man and were
about to invest a million dollars in the man
ner In which the railroad company says it in
tends to invest it in this city J would not be
willing to accept such a short franchise. It
would not bÂ£ long enough to Insure that sta
bility necessary to operate large undertakings
profitably. I am also convinced that the South
ern Pacific is not irrevocabl-- committed to
fifty-year' franchises, although It haa asked
for them fomhat term of years. I think this
matter can be compromised In a way that will
be generally satisfactory.^. Â¦- â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
ALAMEDA, July 23. â Division Su
perintendent B. A. Worthington's state
ment published in The Call that if the
Southern Pacific cannot obtain from the
city of Alameda the two franchises it
seeks for its local roads the corporation
will withdraw from the city created a
tidal wave to-day in > the, railroad agita
tion that has stirred the municipality in
all its precincts for the last three weeks.
While Worthington's statement is gen
erally accorded official credit there, are
many who believe that the Southern Pa
cific is not overlooking the little game of
bluff in its endeavors to influence pub
lic opinion with respect to the franchises.
The residents that profess to see a "hold
up" move on the part of the railroad
company assert that it is unreasonable
to think that the Southern Pacific would
desert Alameda and leave the way open
to other corporations to come into pos
session of the valuable privileges it has
made use of for more than a 1 quarter of
a century. Others fear that the South
ern Pacific may be forced to such an ex
tremity if. the franchise is not handled
properly. They feelthat now is the crit
ical time in the negotiations and that
coolness and caution should be exercised
to the limit before action is taken. Here

After the District Attorney had con
cluded his address, about 3:20 o'clock.
Juror Judge asked that the charge be
postponed till this morning, and it was so
ordered. During the District Attorney's
scathing arraignment the defendant sat
perfectly cool, chewing prum and keeping
his shifting eyes away from his accuser.
"This," concluded the District Attor
ney, "was one of the most diabolical
crimes ever committed in any part of this
State. This brute at the bar beats a de
fense'ess woman on the head and on the
face with the butt end of a revolver and
threatens to blow her brains out unless
ehe tells him where she kept her dia
monds. There is the o.uintet, Docia Nolan,
Mike Nolan, Bernard Whltelaw, John
Davis and Lupton, over one of whom the
Ehadow of the gallows has fallen, all
marching on to the same goal, and White
law is the blackrst, foulest and most dia
bolical of them all. In every lineament of
his face the words thug, villain and
ecoundrel are written."
It was agreed among counsel that each
Â¦would take only half an hour, so that the
Judge would be in a position to charge
the jury about 2:3'.' o'clock and a verdict
might be reached that evening. Attor
ney Carl E. Lindsay made the opening
address for the people, and was followed
by Attorneys Farquhar and Barnes for
the defense. District Attorney Byington
made the closing argument. He analyzed
the evidence, claiming that there were at
least five reputable witnesses besides Mrs.
Matthews who had positively identified
the defendant. No stronger case had in

â¢VEW YORK. July 23.â There was a fur
ther decline in the stock market to-day, thÂ«
industrials being the most affected by the
railway lift, including a number of high grade
Issues which suffered In sympathy. A num
ber of causes contributed to to-day's break.
In addition to adverse crop reports and fur
ther wild speculation In cotton a building
trade failure created a leellng of alarm. The
break of 5 1 ' points in Amalgamated Copper
is rather more far reaching than is generally
supposed. Much of the stock was purchased
outright at prices fully fifty points above to
day's quotations, and the shrinkage to-day
was as a last straw to many holders. Large
quantities of copper were . thrown overboard
at practically any price that was offered. Bos
ton, according to all accounts, was forced to
let go at least 20.000 shares and the same
doubtless applies In a lesser degree to numer
ous places. Sales of Amalgamated Copper ag
gregated over 80,000 shares out of a total
business of esn 000 shares. Some new low rec
ords were registered to-day. The list em
braces United Statas Realty. Colorado Fuel,
Tennessee Coal and Rock Island common.
This by no means covers the ground. Net
declines of 2 to 5 points were numerous.

Most descriptions of small tree fruits con

Puget Sound and Honolulu steamers. Fancy
Gravenstein Apples and Bartlett Pears moved
off well and the best offerings readily command

small Pears were offering freely and dragged
at easy prices. Plums, Prunes, Peaches and
Apricots in small boxes and crates stood
as previously quoted. Basket Peache*
were in more liberal supply than
previously and prices were shaded. Prices of
Aprlruts in bulk were unchanged, but the can

to be strictly fancy to bring $30 per ton. As
high as $35 was obtained from the regular

A conference yesterday between th*
heirs of the estate of the late Major "W.
B. Hooper and the representatives of the
various cartles Interested In the Occi
dental Hotel property resulted In an un
derstanding: regarding the future of the
Mon,tgomery-street hostelry. It waa
agreed that the Occidental Hotel shall be
maintained for a number fcf years practi
cally under the control of. the Hooper
family, although ostensibly Frank I*
Hooper, nephew of the late Major Hooper
and at present steward of the hotel, will
be the lessee and manager. This arrange
ment, it . is said, is satisfactory to the
members of the Hooper family and the
papers necessary to prolong the manage
ment will be signed to-day. It was also
announced that the representatives of
the owners of the property will recon
struct the interior of the hotel In order
to modernize it. Something like fllO.OCO
will be expended In new sanitary arrange
ments, modern bath tubs, a new elevator
and the Introduction of an eleotrlo bell
system and other new appliances now in
use in the more modern hotels.
George Hooper expects to assume the
management of the Occidental on the first
of the new month and will make few
changes In the corps of assistants who
served for many years under his uncle.
The arrangements for the continuance of
the Occidental Hotel were made through
Attorney Gavin McNab. acting for the
Hoopers, and the Donohoe-Kelly bank,
representing the heirs of the Donahue
estate, which owns the major portion of
the property. 3
The old lease of the Occidental Hotel
expired on the first of this month and
since then there has been much specula
tion among local people. Interested In
real estate, as to what disposition would
be made of the valuable property. The
â¢sickness of Major Hooper prevented hia
securing a. renewal of his lease, as the
bank people declined to act without hia
presence. It was finally decided that the
Hoopers should continue In control of
the hotel until Major Hooper grew better
or died. When he died it was reported
that the owners of the property were a
unit In the determination that the old
building should be torn down and replaced
by a modern office structure. Yesterday,
however, an entirely new plan was
adopted and the Occidental Hotel, one
of the most famous in the United States,
will continue to exist for another ten
years and under the management of a
Hooper.
Another car of Western Hens, making the
fourth for the current" week, was on sale and
moved off slowly at easy prices. Receipts, of
domestic stock were moderate but ample. There
was a steady demand for large young stock.
but second-class offerings, especially of Hens,
were neglected. Game sold oft well at un
changed prices, the supply and demand about
balancing. '

exchange for gpods and good change of
the realm were. offered a number of local
business men by a smooth operator to
day. Martin Joost is out of pocket $4 60
arid John Lubben is short $4 with noth

drafts on the Bank of Alameda bearing
the namo "D. A., Carrington." Ludwlg
"VVarnke has a check for 110 inscribed with
the same, signature and Alois Kist has
another for $15. Warnke and Klst took
the checks, but as they gave no change
back and failed to find the place where
the swindler ordered them to deliver what
he had bought, they are short on nothing
and longer on experience. No trace of
the operator has been discovered by the

ree Oil Painting
With Next Sunday's Call.
, There is nothing in the wide, wide world quite so appealing as home.
t Be it ever so humble there is no spot like the habitation of the individtu_
man. Rich or poor, high or low, good or bad, prince or pauper, the in-
- clination is for home, and any picture that represents home ties or â¢ horns
features touches the wannest spot in the hearts of all men and women.
Apropos of this, The San Francisco Call presents as its art supple-
ment next Sunday an oil painting' which is a perfect reproduction in color
of the celebrated picture by Henry P. Smith entitled "The Old Home;
stead." It represents a New England farmhouse and possesses artistic
qualities of the highest order. Its composition is well balanced, its color .
harmonious and there is a satisfying fidelity in the completeness with
which the details are elaborated. There is an element of outdoors in the
whole beautiful scheme. The farmhouse, with its antique, cozy character,
its great elm tree in front, its-rich greens surrounding and its air of
shade," comfort and coziness are peculiarly attractive.
Smith, the artist, is one of the most successful of New York pie-
, ture-makers and he is one of the most cultivated men in the art world.
Hitherto he has devoted himself largely to Venetian /scenes â pictures of- :
architectural wonders of the Old World. The present effort is an innova-
tion; it* passes from the grandeur of Granada and Seville to the homely
* comforts of a New England homestead. The change shows great -wfrsatil-
ity in the artist and has in it an atmosphere that is peculiarly graceful
and charming*
California readers will be especially interested in this attractive pic-
ture of Eastern homeliness and natural luxury, conveying as it does a de-
licious sense of coolness that seems to exude from the canvas.

Qâ Is It not a fact that P. E. Bowles of

on you for the Inspection of Â¦ your warehouses
on May 28? A.â He did. Â¦, r
Q. â Then was not < that an unusual | occur

demand his back salary? A.â Such things
have happened 'before. - ,
Q. â Well; waa there anything else that hap
pened between May 28 and May- 31. which
might have caused uneasiness? A. â No.

you had with B6wles on June 3 ;you ordered

for Josua's j precipitate < haste in demand

cured only- a few. days vbefore the 'firm

SEES STORM APPROACHING.
Q. â There were two months, from March 31
to May 31, which were not covered by this
Item. How do you account for that? A. â
Josua wanted to balance his account for six
years. .-.â",.
Q.â What is the debit charge as shown by.
that book against Josua Eppinger on May 31?
A.â $56,329 12.
Q.â Do you know what that means? A. â It
means that he has been charged up with that
sum for various owlngs of cash which he had
withdrawn during the period covered by that
entry.
Q. â The effect of crediting your sen with
$42,000 on May 31 was to offset the debit col
umn of Josua Eppinger, w.as it not? A. â Well,
he owed that much less. \ Â¦ . . -
Q. â How do you explain that entry, credit-
Ing your son with $42,000? A. â On or about
May 31 Josua came to me and said he would
like to get what was coming to him on the
books and I wrote a note to the cashier tell
ing him to give him what was due him ac
cording to his credit account. Josua carried
the note to the cashier.
er on some suspicious entries as follows:
Q. â On the account of Josua Eppinger there
are debit charges from June 1, 1901, to May
29, 190Â»r The only credit, charge is the item
$12,600 which has been carried over from an
old ledger. But on the credit side of the
account for May 31, 1903, there Su the entry:
By expense account â Salary from February 28,'
1897, to March 31. 1903, at $7000 per year,
total $42,000. Now is it not a fact that for
the â¢ last six years Josua Eppinger was I not
credited with any salary? A.â I see no credit
on the books.

crepancy wa 8 accounted for In the bcoks? A. â
No. I never did.
Q. â When did the firm of Eppinger & Co.
last take an account of assets and liabilities?
A. â So long ago that I have. forgotten. Not
within ten years- at least.
; Q.â Did you ever ask for it? A. â Yes, I
asked my brother Jacob several. times, but he
told me to leave things alone. ',
' Q. â Then could you say at the end of this

time he needed. Â¦ . . i
Q. â But were not Ettllnger & Co. In the
same business as your firm â did they not do a
grain business also? A. â They dealt only in the
purchase and Â«a!e of options on wheat; we
dealt in the wheat Itself.
Q. â Bid your son devote himself entirely to
the business of your firm during, the last seven
yeare? A. â No; he had Interests with Â¦ Et
tllnger & Co. as a partner. 1 After the organi
zation of that firm he looked after their Inter

Attorney Frelfienrich v opened the' in
quiry with questions' eliciting the infor
mation that the witness was 61 years of
age and had been actively connected with
the firm of Eppinger & Co. up to the time
it closed its doors on June 6. The ques
tions and answers of the examination fol
low categorically:
Q. â State thÂ« duties performed by each
onÂ« of thÂ« members of the' firm during the
last ten years. A. â The business was conducted
almost entirely by Jacob Eppinger. . I attended
to the correspondence, the selling of grain on
the samples and the. Exchange. .
Q. â What were the specific duties of* Jacob
Eppinger?- A. â He directed the whole busi
ness, the purchase or grain, financiering and
call board business.
Q. â There werÂ« regular books . of aecounl
kept? A. â Tes. . - â¢ .
Q. â What were the names of the several em
ployes and what were their duties? A. â W. W.
Topping was the bookkeeper of the grain ac
counts; F. Mitchell was general bookkeeper;
Jomia Eppinger kept "tab on the .foreign mar
kets, made up the grain tables and had charge,
of foreign sales; C. Lengton had charge of the
examination of samples -of ft-aln; E, Bes&o.t
made out the cipher tables; Joseph Eppinger
was carhler; L. Friedlander was office bey.
Q.â What salary did Joeua Eppinger receive?
A. â I think that he received ?300 a month up
to 1897, and then his salary was raised to $7000
a year. .
At the opening, of the examination at 10
o'clock Attorney Ach made the statement
that Jacob Eppinger, the senior member
of the firm, whose testimony was to be
taken first, had been unable to attend the
first session of the inquiry/ on account of
a sudden illness which had overcome him
at his home on Wednesday night, but
that as soon as he was able to be out- he
would make his appearance . before the
referee of bankruptcy. The testimony of
Herman Eppinger was then commenced,
and it occupied the entire time of the ses
sion.
examination commenced yester
day morning by^the attorneys represent
ing the, interests of the creditors in the
office of Milton J. Green, referee In bank
ruptcy. Eppinger admitted facts which
prove that when the shadow of impending
disaster fell over the doomed firm one
member at least made a strong effort to
e'ear a comfortable sum to his credit be
fore the crash. Further it was discovered
that for an Indefinite time previous to the
failure of the firm checks on his indi
vidual account were drawn by Jacob Ep
pinger without any record of such trans
actions appearing on the debit side of his
accounts in the books of the firm. Â»It was
finally admitted that as far as the wit
ness, Herman Eppinger, knew no trial
balance of the financial standing of the
firm had been made for the last ten years.
If the testimony given by Herman Eu
pinger can be taken as an indication of
the statements which are to be made by
other members of the firm whose exam
ination is to follow, it appears that when
all the evidence is taken by the attorneys
for the creditors there will be little of the
mysterious business transactions of the
firm' which will not be brought to light.
David Freidcnrich of the law firm of
Naphtaly, Freldenrich & Ackerman, as
representative of Receiver Henry Wads
worth, conducted the examination. Alfred
Sutro, Richard Bayne and H. G. Platt,
attorneys representing various banks who
are creditors of the bankrupt .firm, were
in, attendance to listen to. the testimony
of the witness. Henry Ach, the legal ad
viser of the Eppingers, accompanied his
client to instruct him in his rights.

; There is trouble in store for Charles E.
Navlet; the well known San Jose florist.
Yesterday his wife commenced proceed

cover property " valued at more than
1 $25,000, which she claims Navlet procured
from her by fraud and which she says
unless the court restrains him he will

serious charges against her husband and
