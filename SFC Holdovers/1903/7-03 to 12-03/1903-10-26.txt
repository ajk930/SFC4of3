the campaign cry from one end of the

The election in Maryland Is looked upon
by both parties as an important .test of
the negro question as a campaign issue.
It will be the first expression by the peo
ple of that State on the restricting legis

cational test bars many negroes from the
privileges of the ballot. Gorman's speech
is rejrarded as staking almost the entire
election in Maryland on this one ques
tion. It is knownthat he looks upon the
result as very' important to his party and
his friends regard It as critical to his own
chances for the Democratic nomination.
It developed to-day that It is a well-de
termined plan on .the part . of -national
Democrats to force the" race issue to the
front, not alone in the South and the close
States of Maryland.' Delaware, New Jer
sey and West Virginia, but also in the
larger cities of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and

Upon hearics the facts broturht out at
the inquest the Coroner's jury brought in
a verdict averring that Louise, Harold
and Maria Iverson. aged, respectively, 12
and 6 years and 7 months, had come to
their death by strangling, presumably at
the hand* ef their mother while she was
temporarily insane. Mrs. Iverson was ta-
In the evening, about dark, she
t trarjried the youngest boy, Harold, aged
< years, and went out cf the house and
cot an ax with which she struck him on
ihe side cf the head. Later in the even
ing she strangled her infant daughter,
Maria, aged 7 months. After killing her
children the demented woman walked
about the house nearly all night, lying
down on the floor for but a short timÂ£.
This story lira. Iverson told Sheriff Nes
bitt this morning mhen he questioned her,
saying that she believed it was her duty
to kill ail^her children. She said she knew
i^he had done wrong, adding that the chil
dren were good children and she had no
ciSculty with them nor no occasion to
punish them. She appeared to realize
Â«-nly In a very slight degree what she had
done and later asserted that the children
were not dead.

L'pon hearing this Iverson telephoned to

ing him to co to the place -and see the
girl. Dr. Trimmer asked his partner, Dr.
A. M. Ritchie, to call and see the child,
and hÂ« did ho. He was met at the door
by Mrs. Iverson, who told him there must
be Boise mistake, as no one in the house
was 111. She betrayed ro emotion, al
though the girl was lying dead within, and
the doctor, suspecting nothing wrong,
wÂ«Â«nt away. The neighbors heard no un
uÂ«ual wounds about the house and nothing
Â¦Â»-3Â« known of the tragedy until Iverson
arrived this morning to find the house in
disorder, his wife crazed and his children
dead.

the testimony at which showed that Mrs.
Iverson, who has been in ill hÂ«rUth for
the pas-t seven mor.ths, came to Pacific
Grove with her four children about tfcres
weeks ago. Iverson had accompanied
his family to the Grove at that time,
whither he had brought them . in the
hope of benefiting his wife's health, and
twice 5!nce then had visited thorn. At
no time had he seen anything to indicate
that his wife was mentally deranged, and
neighbors occupying 1 adjoining houses
testified that she had lived very quietly
thrre. and that they haC seen, nothing
unusual in her actions.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Ivcrson, act

a supreme b^ing, determined to kill all her
children, ar.d seizing- her U- year-old
da-jghter, Louise, by the throat, choked
her until life was extinct. She then laid

It is believed that the revolutionists

they were disappointed. Advices received

Cauca and Bolivar state that Genera'*
Diaz, Morkun and Duendla and other
prominent Liberal leaders purposed
starting a revolutionary movement, but
were arrested beforÂ« they were ab!Â« to
do so.
News of the landing of the so-called
revolutionists was received here witJi
great surprise by both Liberals and Con

ever with any Liberal movement or pre
concerted political plan of any kind, and
therefore no Importance Is attached to It

to the effect that the expedition started

few moments y a stream of water was*
gushing in and trickling about sthe feet
of the workers, and to some extent Inter-'

men and policemen cleared away the
small pieces of rock from the big. block
of . stone and managed to get near Juno
Pasquaie and Batasto Valantio, who were
bruised on the back and,' legs. -As soon j
as the Injured In Its Immediate vicinity
were removed; the big stone was blown
up with powder and taken away piece
by piece. Back of this rock was a fifty
ton block that had dropped from the roof
of tho tunnel. In a crevice beneath it
the bodies of the two men, one lying
across the other, were found.
The upper man had been crushed to
death while tho one underneath was
alive, though his legs and body were
crushed. It was an hour before he was
extricated. The big stone was partly
blasted away while It lay over him and
a hydraulic jack then elevated the re
maining portion of it sufficiently to per
mit of the man's renibval. He was Junoj
Baki. He had been pinned under the'
body of his dead fellow,' workman for
hours, part of the time conscious.
Four feet below the place where Bakl
lay. the crushed form of Alphonse^ Ar
matello waV discovered under a quantity
of small rock and shale. He was quick

bodies of several unidentified Italians,
some of them crushed beyond recogni

done in the light of the ambulance lamp.
The man, who was not identified, died
later at a hospital.
RESCUE WORK IS DELAYED.
A pathetic incident was the finding of
the body of Foreman Sullivan, wedged
and Jammed far beneath the stone. It
was not recovered until long after day
light.
From about 3 o'clock in the morning
his ten-year-old son Samuel had stood
by and could not be induced to leave
until the body of his father had been ex
tricatd. Many Italian women congre
gated about the exits, weeping, lament
ing and rushing to the tram car each
time it brought forth a body.
/ The corpses of Stanzione Burne, Louis
Tippio, Guisseppe Barono and three
other unidentified Italians were found
flattened on the floor of the tunnel near
where the body of Sullivan was recov
ered- The heads of the men, in most
cases, were toward the exit, indicating
that they had plunged to the north in an
effort to escape. Each body was re
moved only by the lifting of tons upon
tons of rock. â¢
Rufus C. Hunt, superintendent, and
â¢Richard Beyers, general foreman .for
John McDonald, the contractor, who Is
building the tunnel, * were arrested as
soon as they reached the scene of the
disaster, i but being experts in tunnel
work and blasting, were permitted to
direct the work of rescue. Later a mag
istrate remanded them to the coroner,
who held them in $10,000 ball each.
Coroner Jackson said he believed the
accident was caused by criminal negli
gence. Ths seams that appeared Sat
urday are pelleved to have been about
the great rock that fell directly in the
center of the excavation. As soon as
this boulder, acting as a keystone, was
released, the stones on both sides fol
lowed it.
From men who worked in the tunnel
it was learned that props had been used
to hold up the roof. The heavy timbers,
12 by 12 inches, were crumbled like
toothpicks beneath the great weight of
the cave-in.
Later the body of William' Schutte
was found, within ten feet of the face
of the tunnel. -
A policeman and two ambulance sur
geons were the first to enter the tunnel.
They ran along the track, which was
still lighted by Incandescent lamps, until
the>\. reached the great pile of bowlders
and crushed rock. The first victim found,
an Italian laborer, . was pinioned on a
Bhelf of the excavation by one leg, a
bowlder of about ten tons in weight hav
ing fallen on it. He was hanging head
downward, groaning in semi-conscious
ness. ThoÂ«rocki that held him was re
strained from falling farther by a small
piece of stone insecurely wedged under
it. and an effort to move the^bowlder
would cause the Italian to be completely
crushed. The doctors then determined to
; When the. roar had ceased the cries of
the injured workmen re-eohoed through
the tunnel. An alarm was telephoned to
the police headquarters and reserves and
ambulances were immediately sent to the
scene. . â¢ . â¢ ' '
The tunnel was. being bored* by open
ing a perpendicular embrasure in the face
of the bore, and blasting the sides to the
right and left of these embrasures. Three
blasts were arranged by the drillers, the
holes being charged well toward the roof.
The drillers then withdrew and the blasts
were set eff in rapid succession by elec
tricity, loosening large quantities of earth
and rock. About ten minutes elapsed to
allow the smoke to clear away before
Timothy Sullivan, the foreman, and Elec
trician Schutte advanced, the latter in
tending to string wires and hang electric
lamps to light the way. They were fol

Castro has not yet satisfactorily ex
plained his possession of a_ number of
pillow slips and portions of a woman's
garments. He says that they were given
to him by a Chinese, but the officers be
lieve they were stolen in one of the towns
near here, probably Concord. Constable
Benjamin V. Â£oto of Concord reports
that Castro attempted; kidnaping in that
locality, recently, but not to such an;ex
tent that he could be arrested.
The child said to-day that
Castro drove up the street and asked her
if she wanted. a ride/ At first Bhe an

the young man assisted in the arrange
ments to steal the child and that he was,
in fact, chiefly responsible. Tho ' officers
reserve their opinion, as to the truth of
the ex-convict's story, but the fact that
Young traveled with Castro has seemed
to lend some color to the theory of the
former's participation in the crime.
Until this morning Castro maintained a
resolute silence regarding the events , of
last night. When finally he was induced
to talk he promptly endeavored to fix the
responsibility on Young. This resulted in
Young's arrest. The Boy stated to the po
lice that he had journeyed from Concord
to Martinez with Castro, that the horse
attached, to their buggy had been tied,
tbat ho wandered. about town and- that he
knew nothing more of Castro until the
latter's arrest. This statement by Young
Is considered true, because several per
sons saw him on the streets before the
child's disappearance and during the pro
gress of the search for tha kidnaper.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 25. - "Intelliffent
Senrlce to God and to the State" waa the
subject of an address by President
Roosevelt to the 7000 people who attended
the public open-air missionary service at
Mount St. Albana this afternoon, on the
grounds of the Cathedral of St. Peter
and Bt. Paul. The President was accom
panied by Mrs. Roosevelt. Admiral
Dewey and Brleadier General John A.
Wilson. After a procession led by the
marine band in cassocks and -a choir of
500 voices, the clergy of the Diocese of
Washington and tha Bishops of the
Anglican Communlcrts of America, the
opening prayers were read by Bishop
L>oane of Albany. The President was in
troduced by Bishop Eatterlee. At the
ciose of the Presidents address, the
Most Rev. Enos Nuttall, Archbishop of
the West Indies, asked permission to Eay
a word on behalf of the British people.
Speaklne. as he said, for them, he to-ld
of the "reverence and respect" which all
Englishmen feel for the President of the
I tilted States and Theodore Roosevelt,
"the man and the Chris:ian/' He de
ciared that England welcomed the expan
sion of the United States into a world
power and that if President Roosevelt
Â«hbuld visit England he would receive the
greatest welcome extended a foreign vis

The President epoke. in part, as follows:

MAN TO SHOOT HIMSELF I
SALINAS. Oct. S.â Three bodies In one
coffin arrived here to-night from Pacific
Grove. They were these of the victims
cf Mrs. Iverson's religious frenzy. By the
same train she arrived, gaunt and hag
gard, looking straight ahead, apparently
unheedful of the great crowd gathered
at the derwt.
From the husband and others It Is
learned that ever since the birth of the
Infant Mrs. Iverson has been 111 and at
times out of her mind, but as her hallu
cinations appeared slight nothing was
thought of them. About three weeks ago,
thinking that a change of scene and air
might benefit his wife, Iverson took her,
with their four children, to Pacific Grove
and installed them In a cottage.
Mrs. Iverson had said she would be
back In Salinas last night and when her
eight-year-old son arrived home alone
both Iverson and his mother-in-law. Mrs.
P. Jorgenson. were thunderstruck. To
their questions the little boy said:
"Mama sent me to tell you that Louise
was sick and that she had given her med
icine. Louise looks white and Is very
quiet and don't talk. Mamma wants you
to com* over."
Alarmed at his son's statement, Iver
son drove over to Pacific Grove. Upon

couple were married In Salinas about
fourteen years ago and their life until
the present time was a happy one.
Mrs. Iverson, who Is about 32 years old
and of Danish descent, has spent most of
her life in Salinas, where she was highly
respected. She was of a pleasant dispo
sition and had never given any indica
tions of Insanity. She was a devout mem
ber cf the Danish Lutheran Church, but
has never shown any tendency to relig

INSANE MOTHER ENDS THREE LIVES
The others at the wedding, besides Mrs.
Hooper, the bride's mother, were: George

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25.â After a
courtship beginning with child
hood, two young: members of San
Francisco society were married
at Hotel Bellevue at 3 o'clock
tills afternoon after a hurried trip had
been made across the continent by the
bridegroom.
The bride was Hiss Rosa Hooper,
daughter of the late Major W. B. Hooper,
for twenty rears the Â¦widely known pro
prietor of the Occidental Hotel In the
Golden Gate city. The bridegroom is
Charle3 Albert P'.otner, who is In the in
surance business in San. Francisco. The
marriage was performed by the Rev. Al
fred P. J- McCIure-
The bride came here with her mother,
who Is under medical treatment. Mr.
and Mrs. Plotner left this evening for
New York. After a brief visit they will
return to San Francisco.
entering the cottage he was horrified to
find h!s three children cold in death, with
his wife apparently unconcerned.
Upon their arrival to-night the bodies
of the victims were taken to the morgue
and the mother to her home, where a
close watch is kept upon her. From inti
mate friends it is learned that for several
months cast she has done several Queer
things, claiming that she had been di
rected to do so by a supreme power. Ten
days ago her husband notified Dr. Par
ker of the facts and was advised to
watch her. It Is believed that she killed
her offspring while under one of these
spells. It Is stated that two of her un
cles .are Insane, one being- confined at
Napa and one at Highlands.
There Is great amazement here over the
crime, as both husband and wife were
born, raised and wedded in this place and
have always bcrne an enviable reputa
tion. Their families are among the leadt
ers of the Danish colony in the county.
Mrs. Iverson's eight-year-old boy. who
escaped death, has been crying all day
and now says that his sister, Louise, had
been white and still, refusing to talk or
even open her eyes since Friday after
noon. She was probably poisoned.
When the news was received this morn
ing about the triole murder, Peter Jor
geneon, father of the murderess, was In
formed. He fell unconscious from his
chair and still remains so. As be is TO
years* old and feeble, the doctors believe
he will not recover.
Miss Hooper Is tall, dark-haired and ex
tremely attracti\e. She wore at the wed
ding a pearl gray gown and a pearl gray
hat. Â¦with a white ostrich plume. The
bride has traveled abroad a great deal
and has a high reputation on the PaciQc
Coast as a painter of miniatures.
As the family could be together In tnls
city and as the young patr desired to be
married as soon as' possible, the bride
groom and the' bride's brother "were tele
graphed that the joyous opportunity had
come, and immediately hurried across the
continent.
"Yes,*" Mrs. Hooper replied, "you may
perform my daughter's wedding ceremony
here on Sunday."
Dale of New York, a close friend of the
Hooper family.
There was a pretty, sympathetic fea
ture about the wedding ceremony. For
several years Mr. Hooper was contrib
utor to the mission funds of the Church
house here. Recently Mrs. Hooper re
ceived a letter from Rev. Mr. McClure,
addressed to Mr. Hooper, asking for as
sistance for the mission. She came here
a day cr two ago and left a card for Mr.
McClure. The clergyman, who had never
met Mrs. Hooper, called afterward and
was greatly grieved to leara of the death
of her husband about three months ago
and asked whether he might be of any
possible service to her.

at 12:30 oVloek this morning by F. Pons,
proprietor of the house. The body was

from natural causes. *A strange feature
of the case lies in the fact that at about
3:30 o'clock last night an old man called
at the Morpue and asked if the body of
Annie Curlfy was there. This was three
hours before the body was found by
Por.Â« and the case reported to the Cor

that the regiments of the National Guard

the money, but they demanded that the
regular army officers detailed to muster
the military regiments should notify them
as to the time the National Guardsmen
left home, the length of time on the road
going and ermine and the duration of
camp duty. The mustering officers re
fused In every Instance to comply with
the majority of these requests on the
ground of lack of personal knowledge.
For a short time there was a deadlock,
but Adjutant General Mayes stepped Into
the office, certified to the facts In each

HIS RELATIVES
Young Fraser was educated to follow in
his father's footsteps. He was sent to
the famous Union Theological College of
New York, from which he was graduated
In 1841. Immediately afterward the young
man took a four years' course at Prince-
Dr. Fraser's name is firmly linked with
the history of the Presbyterian church In
the United States, particularly in the
Western portion, which he entered in the
ante-bellum times, and there labored for
many years in upbuilding and strongly
rooting the faith.
The eminent minister and missionary
was born at Dalkieth, Scotland, in 1820,
of sturdy Scotch Presbyterian stock. His
father, a . Presbyterian clergyman, came
to the United States in 1S25. bringing hia
son Thomas with him and settling at
Schenectady, N. Y., where the elder Fra"
ser was pastor of the first Presbyterian
church built in that thriving city of the
empire State.

OAKLAND, Oct. 25.â The Rev.
Thomas Fraser, D. D., one of the
most prominent Prsbyterian
clergymen on the Pacific Coast,
a pioneer of his faith in this
country and the organizer of 100 Presby
terian churches in the United States,
died at 11 o'clock this morning at his res
idence, 916 Myrtle street. Dr. Fraser had
been in ill health, but his death was quite
unexpected, as the venerable clergyman
was up and about no later than yester
day. He- was stricken with pneumonia
last night and because of his 83 years
the illness proved speedily fatal, despite
all that the attending physician. Dr. S.
H. Buteau, could do. m

LOSES THREE OF HER MEN
The deceased leaves a daughter, Miss
Julia Fraser, and a stepson, Charles W.
Beebe. The funeral will be held Tuesday
afternoon at 2 o'clock from the chapel
of the First Presbyterian Church.
Dr. Fraser retired from this work in
1883 to accept anf' appointment as professor
of systematic theology in the San Fran
cisco Theological Seminars', now located
at San Anselmo. Dr. Fraser strenuously
opposed the removal of the college from
San Francisco. During more recent years
the distinguished clergyman had lived
quietly in Oakland and had not been in
active service.
With the strength of conviction backed
by a belief in the righteousness of his
cause. Dr. Fraser was one of the first
men in the West to make a public dec
laration against the "free silver" move
ment.. He denounced it before a large
meeting of Presbyterian ministers in San
Francisco.
In 1867 Dr. Fraser was appointed synod
ical missionary for the synod of the Pa
cific, embracing all of the territory west
of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
Ocean on the west and from the Mexican
boundary to British Columbia on the
north. During the fifteen years that he
served in that capacity he traveled many
thousands of miles and established many
churches throughout that immense ter
ritory. Indeed, he might almost be called
the father of Presbyterlanlsm in that
vast region.
ESTABLISHES
Looking about for a suitable place to
begin his church work, Dr. Fraser set
tled In Sonoma County, with headquar
ters at Santa Rosa. He organized every
Presbyterian church in Sonoma County.
At the outbreak of the Civil "War Dr.
Fraser lent his voice In strong speech for
the preservation of .the Unlca, and one
of the famous oratorical efforts of that
period was the earnest preacher's address
at Santa Rosa.
The young clergyman started West as
soon as he had completed hia college
work and settled in Madison, Wis. He
organized the first Presbyterian church
in that city. Dr. Fraser also organ
ized the synod of "Wisconsin and was its
first moderator. Thence Dr. Fraser went
to Little Rock, Ark., where he became
the pastor of the first Presbyterian church
organized in the Arkansas capital. There
in 1859 he married Mrs. Julia M. Beebe,

thc-m suddenly struck him on the face,
< ausing- a wound from which the blood
flowed freely. Tyler fell to the ground,
â¢ ailing all The time for the police, but his
assailants went through his pockets and
abstracted the money. The men then ran
away.
The police have a good description of
the jewelry stolen, and are sanguine that
they will run the thieves to earth.
A further search disclosed the loss of
valuable Jewelry. Including three gold
watches, three highly prised long neck
chair.s. a unique vinaigrette, a handsome
gold bead necklace, three bracelets, a dia
mond stud, a pair of valuable earrings, a
gold thimble anda wedding ring.
The police were notified, and Detectives
Dinan and Wren were sent immediately
to the house and made a thorough in
vestigation. From marks outside and
with the evidence before them the detec
tives concluded that the burglars roust
have climbed the porch, and by that
means had effected an entrance through
one of the windows. They also must
have made their escape from the house
by the same means.
A daring burglary was perpetrated last
Friday night at the residence of Alden
W. Jackson, 3750 Clay street. Mr. Jack
sen, who is connected with the firm of
Pope & Talbot, lumber merchants, and
his family were in the lower part of the
house at the time the crime was commit
ted, and 6o dexterously was the burglary
planned and carried out that no one of
the household heard a sound that would
have given warning of the presence of
the burglars.
On retiring for the night the family was
surprised to find that one of the rooms
had been entered and the contents thrown
ruthlessly about.
In order to protect the asserted rights
of the Indians and to give ground for a
suit at law the department, it is said, or
dered the emptying of the reservoir, and
in accordance with instructions a force
of Indians was detailed to cut the dam
and release the water that was stored.
The railway company several years ago
constructed a reservoir and appropriated
water from Wolf Creek, and for several
seasons recently the Indians have com
plained of a short supply of water for ir
rigation.
GREAT FALLS, Mont., Oct. 25.â News
was received to-day from Wolf Point, on
the Fort Peck Indian reservation, that
the Indians there at the direction of the
agent, it is alleged, had removed a dam
and let all the water run out of the rail
road company's reservoir at that point.

about $60,000, Is one of the largest ani
most important owned by the Great

General Gillesple submits a total esti
mate of $10,366,100 for the fortifications for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, as fol
lows:
At present there are provided for the
defenses of the United States 105 twelve-
Inch guns, 133 ten-Inch guns, 96 eight-inch
guns, 567 rapid-fire guns and 376 twelve
inch mortars.
Projects for the defenses for San Juan. Porto
Rico; Pearl Harbor and Honolulu Harbor,
Hawaii; San Luis, Apia; Guam, Manila Bay
and SublR Bay have been approved by . the
Secretary of War, and actual construction
should begin thereupon at an early date. It is
bÂ«lleved that the time will come when it will
no longer be possible to ignore the question of
insular defenses. The Navy Department Is
properly insistent that all its important coal
ing stations should receive proper defensive
protection to keep off attacks from possible
hostile fleets.
These coast defenses of the United States are
now somewhat more than SO per cent com
pleted. Twenty-flve of the principal harbors
of the United States have a sufficient number
of heavy guns and mortars mounted to permit
an effective defense against naval attack, and
during the past three years considerable
progress has been made in the Installation of
an adequa'te rapid-fire armament, now the
matter of first Importance.
General Gillesple says that the projects
for defenses of thirty-one localities have
been approved. He adds:
WASHINGTON. Oct. 25.â The annual re
port of General George L. Glllespie, chief
of engineers of the United States army for
the past year, made public to-day, refers
to the work of construction of the fortifi
cations that has been going on under the
general scheme of the Endlcott board. It
adds:
The degree of defense to be provided for coal
ing- and other naval stations, scattered all over
the world, for the larger naval bases, which
must be promptly established, and for which
appropriations are asked cf Congress by the
Navy Department for the ports of Manila,
Pearl Harbor and Honolulu, and for the Lake
ports and the fai. Lawrence River, should
preferably be determined by a tribunal similar
to the Kndlcott Board, as recommended In my
last annual report. In the absence of legis
lation on the subject of insular defenses, a
mixed board of engineers and artillery of
ficers, organized by authority of the Secretary
of War, has already been practically consider
ing and reported upon plans for the emergency
defense of several of the most important har
bors in the Insular possessions. Before these
preliminary plans are actually entered upon
It might be well to invite the co-operation
of the navy by the assignment of a certain
number of naval officers upon a new joint
board of army and navy officers, appointed to
revise or enlarge the preliminary plans of de
fense heretofore prepared.
Upon arriving at Sausallto Harlan had
Robertson arrested for violating the auto
mobile ordinance. Robertson gave bonds
to appear before Justice Pryor on next
Tuesday. Automobiles are prohibited
from passing Coyote Creek on the BoIInaf
road.
SAUSALITO. Oct. 23.â W. T. Robertson
and party, all of San Francisco, while
out riding in an automobile this after
noon, ran Into a buggy containing Georg*
11. Harlan, an attorney oi San Rafael,
and his aged grandmother, Mrs. Gardner,
of Sausallto. The buggy was badly dam
aged, both occupants were thrown out
and Mrs. Gardner was seriously Injured.
Robertson was operating his machine
on a road in violation of the Marin
County automobile ordinance. The acci
dent occurred on the Boiinas srade at a
place known as Steep Ravine, between
Wi'loW Camp and Sausallto. Both ve
hicles were going In the same direction
and the collision took place at a sharp
turn In the road. Fortunately, when thÂ«
automobile struck, the bug-gy was thrown
to the Inside of the road, otherwise tiva
occupants would have been dashed over
a high precipice.
Harlan was only sliehtly bruised, but
Mrs. Gardner was rendered unconscious
for a Ion? time. No one in the automo
bile was harmed. Mrs. Gardner was
taken to Sausalito and. owing to her age.
76 vears, her condition Is considered pre
carious.

Russia Issues Secret Circular.
LONDON. Oct. 35.â The Times learns
that the Russian Secretary of the Interior
has Issued a secret circular to the Gov
ernors of the provinces and other author
ities ordering them to report on the dlffl
culties in the application of laws in rela
tion to Jews, with a view to their revisio^
and improvement. This action is due to
the fact that In several cases Jews have
successfully appealed to the Senate acd
obtained decisions that Governors had
acted Illegally. â¢
I have marie this denial as fcK and Â«=p#>eiSc as I know
bow. I will a-1d that I do not believe the charre of double
dcalin? mack against Judge Bahrs. If I did. I would
n-ver speak to him asain.
As for myself, f am working. Tilth all my heart for the
election of our upright and able Republican candidate,
Henry J. Crocker, and I believe he vrill bo elected by the
Lirpest vote cl^en a Mayoralty candidate for years. Every
decent Republican I know cf is working for bins, and I am
acquainted rrlth many strong Democrats who trill noc only
vote for Crocker, but are working effectively for h!ia row.
"I have brtn in politics more or less for fifty years. All
this time I have fought the corporation politicians. I be-
Heve in clean politics and honest government. Hence I am
fcr Henry Crocker, and hence also I hasten to brand toe
falsehood printed by the evening paper.
My attention was first called to the story this af:ernoon
oy Mr. Casey himself. He was' indignant at your eoa
temporary's misrepresentation of us. and called me up to
as* If I had In any way authorized the use of my name in
the publication. In due time he will makr? his own state
ment regarding the matter. JOHX D. S1EBK.
San Francisco. October =3, 1S03.
I'tfed that he vas glad I was so friendly to Grelf- Then
I started on. and Casey said. "I hear Jud?e Bahrs Is
masking a strong fight." I reolied, "I bol!Â«Â»ve he Is." and
then 1 went on down to mv store on Sacramento street.
Nothing rnor? than this r:s.s sa'd by either of us. Ko
tn^nt^n of t!"Â» 'Mayoralty rtirht rra? mad?, and neither of
us uttered the name of Crocker or Schmitz. Casey asked
me no quesifpn xrhaterer rcgardlcg political or other
matters. __Instt-ad of his comins to see me. our meeting
Â¦was a Â«uFprise to each of it?.
I stopped -Cassy to tell him that I was taking great In
terest in Mr. Greifs campaign for the County Clerkship;
aiso In t bat of E. J. Smith for Tax Collector. Casey re-
The evening paper goes on to say that Ed Casey of the
County Clerk's ofSce came to me to ask about" orders al
leged to have been given by Mr. Herrin favoring th-?
campaign of Mayor Schmitz. and that I confirmed the
report, saying; "Yes. it is Schmitz and Bahrs. That is
the programme. Crocker Is gone."
Every wcrd of this is a deliberate falsehood. In the
first place Ed Casey never came to see me about anything.
I have been in the country nearly all fall, and have seen
Mr. Casey only once since the campaign began. That was
an accidental meeting for a few eeeonds on Montgomery
street, near Clay, and occurred. I think, last Friday after
noon. I met him on the street and stopped to shake hands
with him. Casey was a clerk under me when I was As
sessor, as was also John J. Greif. Both were good men.
and I liked them.
That paper charges that I am "a spokesman for Her
rin." the counsel of the Southern Pacific Railway. This
is false. I have never known Mr. Herrln and never, to my
know'edge, have even seen him. I have never had any
transactions with the Southern Pacific Railway, ekcept
as a business man and shipper. I am In no -way inter
ested in the railway or its attitude toward the Mayoralty
candidates.
EDITOR Call: I ask space in your columns to deny
unequivocally a statement involving me which ap
ptared In yesterday morning's edition of an even
ing paper. I brand that statement as a' falsehood oat of
the whole cloth. There is not even a plausible founda
tion for the story.

pices of the campaign committee of the
party are the largest and most interesting
ever held in a municipal contest. Great
er demonstrations of popular approval
than have ye; taken place will be accord
ed to the Republican nominees this week.
It waÂ« common talk i in the political
camps yesterday that Crocker's majority
would approximate 90001 Lane Is hardly
taken Into account in the race. The or
ganization of the Henry J. Crocker Work
lngmen's League - produces consternation
in the camp of Ruef & Co. and all the ef
fcrts.of the Schmitz regime will be in
voked to resist the Republican advance in
the direction of the labor vote. Ruef is
becoming alarmed over the condition o"
afTairs in the Forty-fifth Assembly Dis
trict. It was his boast early in the cam
paign that - he controlled the Forty -fifth
and conldi swing very nearly the eniira
voting strength of the district to ScRmltz.
Something has happened of late to change
his mind. He is patting Schmitz In the
Fcrty-fifth every n5sht. Politicians say
that Ruef himself Ls not sure of tha
ground In that quarter. There Is consider
able conjecture regarding the ability of
McXab to carry a single Assembly dis
trict for Candidate Lane. Since the red
pepper episode the candidate has re
ceived respectful attention and the other
evening he varied the monotony of talk
about himself to the extect of saying a
few words in behalf of other candidates
on the Gavin McNab Democratic ticket.
for which consideration the candidates
are indebted to Gavin.

Republicans will not take the chance of

the city is Republican. In the creation of

Republicans participated. The party is
tnite*l and confident of success at the
polls. The number of votes for Mr.
Crocker tray exceed KJX&, but ft fs gen
erally conceded that 21.tO) votes will be
sufficient to elect him Mayor. Schmitz
will get a large vote, but not as large as

will not obtain in the coming election.
The excess of the Sclimitz vote over that
of his fellow candidates - on the t'nion

that the Rop'Jbiican Primary League

of victory.
It is expected that every Republican wt:i

the corporations. The same thing cannot

If Franklin Kandidate Lane fails to get
the indorsement of the Ministerial L"cion
he will svrely be known in political an
cals as a hard luck candidate. He was
turned down coldly but politely at a Ger
man Sunday evening festival not long
since. Worklnrmen declined to attend
his meeting called for the purpose of or
ganizing a Lane Union Labor Club. He
has plainly signified that he does not want
the Indorsement of business men. The
Iroquols Democratic Ctub regards his
candidacy as a failure and does not care
to hear him speakâ at least It does not
care enough to invite him to speak, and
the horse and cart wing of the Demo
cratic party entertains with considerable
satisfaction the prospect that he will be
laid cs the shelf.
So far as the Mayoralty Js concerned
there, is only a question as to Henry J.

"Wait a minute and consider. Ruef would

Schmitz should get another term In the
Mayor's office. He would control the Po

That is too much. "No. It is not an

The Value of Ruef's graft under the

subject is everywhere- discussed because
Ruef is spending money with a prodigal
ity unheard of since the time that rich
men poured out coin to buy their way to
the United States Senate. In the course

was oropounded to a man who has quite

REPUBLICAN NOMINEES"Is that so?" replied her hostess. "My
folks was all Baptists,', but Joalah comes
from a Methodist family."â Chicago Rec
ord-Herald^ : '
FOR some time past the leaders in the Lane camp have
been trying to keep up the courage of their followers
by assuring them that however far Lane might be
behind not only Crocker but Schmitz in the early part of
the campaign he would' make it up in the closing week.
Over and over again the word has been sent down- the line
during the past ten days, "Lane is a boss campaigner;
watch him on the homestretch; he will make a whirlwind
finish."
The last week of the campaign has opened and the whirl
wind is now due. It is quite probable that extreme efforts
will be made by the Lane men for the next two or three
days. Every Republican whom Mr. Lane counts among his
close personal friends and who by reason of that friendship
gives him support in this contest will be quoted as a proof
that Republicans are breaking away from Crocker. A good
deal of that kind of work has been done already and doubt
less we shall have more of it. It is to be^noted, however,
that despite all the columns of display given to these so
called : proofs of Republican defection they do not amount
to as many as half a ddzen when they are counted.
Of course no objection is to. be made to tafctics of that
kind when properly'used, but it is very easy to misuse them;
and consequently the public might just as well be on guard
for the rest of the campaign against canards and roorbacks:
When politicians set about making a whirlwind finish there
is no telling to what tactics they, will resort in their efforts
to raise a wind arid make it whirl. "
As the campaign presents itself there is nothing that gives
any slightest reason for changing the â¢ opinion formed at - the
starf that the real contest is between Crocker and Schmitz.
Lane cannot draw any considerable number of Union Labor
men from Schmitz, but Crocker can and has. That 'fact
has been shown by the organization of a Henry. J. Crocker
Workingmen's League. with a membership running up into
A WHIRLWIND FINISH.
The isthmian canal is to share discussion with the pro
posed commercial treaty between the United States and
Cuba during the extra session of Congress. We may be
assured therefore that the legislative reputations that are
not lost in one debate will be hopelessly damaged in the
|pther.
Portland has a healthy sensation in the fact that a suit. has
been instituted to force some of the city's prominent club
men to pay for the whisky which they have imbibed in good
fellowship at the club bars. Slowly but surely the iconoclast
is tearing down the last cherished privileges of bohemianism.
If this sort of thing continues we won't have left a single
fashionable dead beat to exhibit even as a freak.

â¢ â Chicago News.
down on Montgomery street,
behind the Hall of Justice, there is
a little restaurant which keeps its
doors open all night. Along in the gray
hours of the morning, when the vegetable
carts and the milk wagons begin to rum
ble through the streets, a motley crowd
of nlsht owls drift In there to get their
warming cup of coffee. and a "snake."
Every morning about 1 o'clock there
comes Into the little shop a slattern old
woman, who sits down to her rolls and
steaming coffee apart in one corner of the
dimly lighted room. She Is tall, gaunt,
shaky in her step and has a habit of sit
ting with her lean arms tightly folded
about her as 4f to Insure against her be
draggled clothing falling away from her
scrawny form. No one knows who she is
or where she lives. When once her order
is set before her she begins to nod. First
she will make an endeavor to shake off
sleep by a pretense of reading the coffee
stained paper. Ostentatiously â¢ she will
turn j the pages and pretend to scan the
columns, but Inevitably the crazy old bon
net will drop lower and lower until with
a quick Jerk It Is barely saved from dip
ping In the coffee.
A few mornings ago a greasy meat
wagon driver, who happened to be In the
restaurant for the first time, evidently,
took a keen delight in watching that old
bonnet dip and waver. At last, when the
dingy feather trailed Into the egg ome
lette on the bare table he burst into a
roar of laughter.
"HI, old lady, take a brace!" he bawled,
slapping his table with his fist.
Instantly the bonnet righted itself and
the aueer shambling figure raised Itself
with an air of rare dignity. The seamed
old face was turned toward the butcher.
Not a shadow of a scowl crossed the wan
features as the old lady spoke.
"Young man," she said, "when you have
known sorrow you will not laugh."
Then the old lady went out into the
gray morning. 1 .
Danny, Human Bat,

'Nudder steam, barkeep."
Waking refreshed a few mornings ago
from his, bat-like sleep, Danny addressed
the curious witnesses of his sleeping
stunt. He said;
Danny Is seen to best advantage In the
dark hours of the morning. His work
through, he drops into one of "the poor
rren's club3" that line his route to en-
Joy a nightcapâ of "steam."
Perhaps drowsiness will come upon him
and then his accomplishment will evidence
Itself. Hooking his chin over the bar
rail and slipping his hands comfortably
into his coat pockets, he permits his
knees to bend under him until, with heaa
bent back at a startling angle, his weight
rests heavily on his chin. Then he slum
bers and the hours glide away, his snor
ing uninterrupted by the klinking ol
glasses and the wild songs of roisterers.
Tj yO head through which raced the
j\f phantom shapes of happy dreams

low than does Danny's chin on a bar-rail
when drowsiness seizes himâ and that is

standpoint of his ability to sleep with
comfort in positions that would fracture

CALIFORNIA has a more than passing interest in
the/, plans' and methods of Dr. John Alexander
Dowie, the reincarnated Elijah. He began his-<vork
as a divine healer in this State, but as.it did not go to suit
him he left, us. He has not forgotten-us, however, for he
announces that after he has clarified New York he will come
and found Zion in the midst of us.
That his plans deserve our attention is demonstrated by
his remarkable success in Chicago. He has gathered within
his fold several thousand people and has had the art to '
accumulate in cash gifts from the well-to-do in his flock or !
under his influence a fortune of several millions of dollars, j
His Zion City, near Chicago, has a large population and he
has founded there lacemaking and other industries of con
siderable magnitude and commercial importance. His vast
wealth is shown in his. ability 'to hire special trains with am
ple accommodations to transport three thousand of his peo
ple to New York City and there hire for a month or more
Madison-square Garden as a meeting place for his "clari
fiers."
His influence with his followers is absolute. They think I
they believe that he is the prophet Elijah and obey his bid
ding without question. His career has not been without
scandals, entirely of a financial nature, however. His own rel- j
atives have sued him to recover large sums of money given I
into his keeping, but have not succeeded in getting it back,
for he seenjs to be as keen in the law as he is in business.
The medical profession has procured his arrest and prosecu
tion for pretending to cure disease by laying on of hands
and incantation, but none of these suits succeeded in sup- j
pressing him. The preachers have preached against him and
the mob has hooted and pelted him, but every attack uponj
him of whatever nature has seemed only to make him
stronger and increase his following.
A large number of orthodox clergymen of many denomi
nations have resigned their pastorates to join him and enter
his missionary corps. A few years ago, having conspic
uously failed to heal the sick in cases brought to him, he
declared 'that they could not be divinely healed because they j
had some time eaten pork. Thereupon he started a crusade
against swine, and his missionaries went into the hog and
corn country and actually influenced many farmers to kill j
all their hogs and destroy them by fire as a burnt offering.
This movement reached such proportions that it alarmed the j
great pork packers of Chicago, who feared that the supply
would be cutvpff, and, they took steps to send out counter
missionaries to offset Dowie's work.
In person he is a man of large frame, with a large head
and not very refined features or manners. In speech he is
coarse and unimaginative. His discourse is not symmetrical
and has none of the graces of oratory. It consists in putting Â¦
forward the most preposterous claims for himself, his super
natural power, his insight into the unseen and his ability to.
work wonders. While his followers seem to be satisfied
whether they see the promised wonders or not. the doubting
world outside is compelled to admit that his wonders worked
upon material things are actual. Both the spiritual and
non-spiritual observers of his career find it difficult to ac
count for his power over his followers, who resign them- I
selves and their property to him in blind and unquestioning |
obedience. It may be said for him that his coarseness of I
speech does notVnake against him, for many of the prophets
of the Old Testament were equally coarse and as brutally
direct. But they also had the imaginative, the poetic, vein j
in which he seems entirely lacking.
Considered as a religious movement his cult is surely a
curiosity. It has attracted to him people from every church,
just why only they can tell. His career seems to again em
phasize the fact that 'any bold man who will set up a novelty j
that is framed in the mystic and, supernatural will get fol- j
lowers. The human tendency to pry into the unknown and i
unknowable and to see through the eyes of another the mys- |
tcrious things not visible to the natural eye must be,ac
cepted as accounting for the great following of such a man.
It is probable too that his'keen attention to tfie material in
terests of his followers has something to do with his suc
cess. Like the Mormon church he sees to it that his people
have work and that they are so directed that they are sure
of the comforts of life.
Early in his New York crusade he is attacked by Rev. Dr.
Parkhurst. But that is what Dowie wants. He thrives on
attacks, and his policy has always been to provoke them.
No matter what he does in New York he will tell *his people
that he has succeeded, they will believe him and his special
trains will carry them to Chicago flushed with victof-y. Then
we are to expect him here. He will move on California with
thousands of his followers to settle them ijj a 7 nev^ Zion
here. This assault on Satan in our State will be awaited
with interest, possiblj' by Satan, and certainly by our people.

Middle Age of Its
Dearest Happiness
By Chaunccy M. DcpKv.
Â«Â«^ 5CENTLY a young lady who had
S3 just come back from a month's
Â»^L honeymoon called on me.
"How do you like matrimony?"
I asked.
"I am utterly wretched," she replied.
I asked her why.
"Beca-use I did not to* it sooner."
And that speech of hers, frivolous as it
may appear, sounded the keynote of tha
marrying question far more truly and
resonantly than could the sneering epi
grams of a world full of cynics.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I bear unqualified testimony to the fact
that a man who passes his life in what
Is miscalled "single blessedness" has
missed most of life's pleasures.
Life at 20â even at 30â may seem pleas
ant enough to a man wltnout a wife to
share its triumphs or failures. The
world is young. There is much to dis
tract and amuse. Home perhaps seems
"a place to go when all the other places
are closed." Friends are plentiful; rela
tives and immediate family are about
him.
But when a man reaches middle or old
age? Friend* are not so many nor per
haps so disinterested as at 20. Old-time
pleasures lack their zest
Klessed, thrice blessed, then, is th^man
who has home, wife and children to ease
that last stage of life's long climb. Most
miserable of mortals is he who must look
forward to a loveless and lonely old age.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Annexing a wife and family In youth Is
merely a higher and wiser form of put
ting money In bank. No other invest
ment yields such interest in later years.
Let a man inarry just as soon as he
can support alwlfe. The youth who puts
off this great fetep in order that he may
search through the world for an "af
finitv" Is foolish. In the search he is
more than liable to pass by his true "af
finity" and to choose at last a T*Jfe whom
no stretch of Imagination could twist into
an affinity for any one. The traditional
man who wandered for days through
a forest looking for material for a cane,
and who at last picked up a crooked
stick, was fortunate if that crooked stick
did not turn out to be a snake.
A man Is just as likely to hit upon his
ideal earlv in life as later on. My ad
vice, then, as the supposititious man's
lawyer, is: "Don't wait."
"Marriage halves one's privileges and
doubles one's troubles" is an idiotic saw
probably invented by a bachelor. There is
too much talk of this sort. Men speak of
matrimony as a millstone tied about the
neck of youth. The lives of the world's
most successful men give the He to this
feilacy. *
Search the lives of the men who have
made history, of the men who have
achieved true greatness, who have won
fame, who have acquired wealth.
The vast majority of them were mar
ried. Of these the greater part married
young. Their wives, instead of trans
forming themselves into shapely but
heavy millstones and dangling about the
galled necks cf their liege lords, have, in
nine cases out of ten, done more than all
other influences combined to crown their
husbands' lives with success. Nearly all
great men who have been married would
confess they owed much of their fame or
wealth to their wives.
There are, of course, obstacles to happi
ness in married life. So also are there
reefs and shoals in the Atlantic. But the
sailor does not for that reason become a
landsman. He studies the shoals and
learns to avoid them. The pitfalls in mat
rimony can far more easily be studied
and avoided by any couple possessed of
a moderate degree of sense.
My belief, from observation, is that sev
enty-five out of 100 marriages are happy,
and that not more than five out of that
number are unhappy.
Apart from love itself there is a com
panionship in married life that draws
closer and more beautiful as the years go
by.
During my last visit to Europe I met a
distinguished' man who expressed the
deepest Interest in our country.
"Why do you not visit us then?" I
asked him, "if you have so kindly a feel
ing for America and the Americans?"
"Because," he replied, simply, "my wife
could not stand the voyage, and I would
not, for any personal or selfish reason,
be responsible for one day's separation
from her."
The couple had been married, forty
years.
Again, many a man or maid postpones
.jjfarrlage because in neither's heart, has
dawned that wonderful aaÂ«eatlon of the
novelist known as "love at first sight"
This is a mistake. Propinquity Is the
most powerful factor in making two
hearts beat as one. .
Many women fo"rm their ideals of a
husband on novels and plays. Disillu
sionment is bound to follow. They find
that thÂ» once idealized husband is only
a common mortal without even a pin
feather on his shoulder blade. Then th4
wife feels she has been deceived. So she
has. But by herself; not by her hus
band.
Another grievous blow to many a wife
is that her husband does not always re
main her lover. She forgets that he Is
toiling every day for her welfare, as no
lover would toiL She forgets also the
wide difference between masculine and
feminine nature. Man loves, but not
quite as woman loves.
While a man may become so wildly in
fatuated as to spend his business hours
in drawing Cupids all over his letter
beads, yet love can never pennanenily
occupy so large a place in his life as it
does in woman's. His life is too full, too
active, too varied in its Interests.
Concession on both Eides is the sover
eign remedy for domestic differences.
If you were to drop two strange cats
into a barrel and then clap on the lid you
vnuld not marvel at the ensuing sounds
cf wrath nor at the floating upward of
errant scraps of fur.
Yet when a man and a woman, reared
along different lines and in separate en
vironments, do not agree in every par
ticular the world, stands aghast at the
tale of martial infelicity. Whereas, a
little forbearance, a careful study of each
other's moods and failings, will soon re
duce this strife to a minimum.

I believe that no couple who began by
loving each other and had the right con
sideration for each other ever came to
serious trouble. The effort of each to
please the other leads in a little while to
not having to try, because of the sym
pathy between them.
"Kiss and moke up" Is a good rule. If
the couple do not properly consider their
relations there will be a good many
kisses, but far more necessity of making
up. *BÂ«BSNBBII BffHHHMBHBH

(Author ofV"Shop Talk on the Wonders of the
Crafts.")
/N an Eastern locomotive works Is. a
gray haired mechanic who can "feel"
the thousandth part of an inch. His
fingers are calloused. His knuckles
are stiff from hard work. His palm is
tough as leather. Yet with a pair of wab
bly-Iegged calipers, the ordinary measur
ing appliance used in every machine shop
in the country, he can detect the differ
ence between one inch and .999 inch.
There are michometer gauges which ac
curately measure to the thickness of a
bubble's film. There are exquisitely fash
ioned machines which record almost In
finitesimal divisions of space. TheVe are
other machines of well-nigh Inconceiv
able delicacy in operation which, with
diamond points, rule thousands of crossed
lines in a square inch of glass. And there
are hundreds of men in overalls who, like
the old Eastern mechanic, accomplish the
apparently impossible In the ordinary
course of a day's work, and that without
realizing they are doing anything wonder
ful. .
â¢ ';;Â¦â¢"â¢,-â¢
s-l â¢ â¢ â¢
The extraordinary accuracy in nice
measurements which enables a mechanic
to note a difference of one one-thousandth
part of an inch in comparing two diam
eters is not given to every craftsman,
but there are multitudes of workmen who,
v.ithout knowing it, do almost incredible
things in their daily labor.
Boring holes in a strip of wood fifteen
inches apart is not much of a trick if the
holes are marked beforehand.' But there
is a lad about 18 years old in an agricul
tural implement factory who does nothing
all day long but bore half-inch holes fif
teen Inches apart in strips of hard wood.
The swiftly revolving auger sticks out
horizontally from the machine. The lad
presses the strip against the auger, which
instantly rips through the wood.
He then moves the strip along and an
other hole Is bored, and so on to the. end
This operation is repeated with weari
some monotony all day and every day in
the week. No marks are- made for the
lad to set the auger to, yet careful meas
urements of a number of sticks showed
that 85 per cent of the holes were exact
ly, fifteen inches apart, and in no case
was there an error to exceed half an Inch.
The ceaseless repetition of certain mo
tions had made the young lad a human
measuring rod.
In another building not far from where
he worked a power hammer all day long
beats a merry tattoo and turns out har
row teeth. Its operator is a boy who sits
on a high stool and with a pair of tongs
holds the red-hot "blanks" under the
hammer. His helper lays the heated
steel on an iron plate. The toothmaker
picks it up. sticks it under the hammer,
presses a lever with his foot, and the
hammer strikes rapidly and sharply, the
operator meanwhile turning the blank and
pushing it forward. The latter move
ment is necessary to secure a sharp, even
point. If moved forward too far the point
is ragged; if not enough the point is too
blunt.
The boy has been making harrow teeth
a year. Doing the same thing over and
over again has turned living flesh and
blood into an automatic feeding attach
ment to a power hammer. The muscles
of his fingers, wrist and right arm work
in beautiful harmony with the machine.
They move the harrow tooth blank ex
actly the right distance at exactly the
right time, apparently without mental ef
fort, for the operator frequently reads
the sporting columns of a newspaper,
making perfectly pointed harrow teeth
the while.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Much that is called skill and expertness
is but marvelous precision and wonder
ful uniformity secured after years of un
varied work One cannot feel the almost
velvety smoothness of a hand-cut "dead
smooth" file without doubting the state
ment that every cut in it was made by
the hand of a man and not by a machine.
A file is cut from an annealed or soft
ened steel blank. The chisel has a broad,
straight cutting edge. The hammer han
dle is inserted well up toward one end of
the hammer head, and when the workman
strikes he gives a "pulling" blow which
raises the "burr" that makes a good
han<Â»-cut file popTJlar with mechanics.
The file cutter, \a-straddle his bench,
works year after year on the same "cut"
of file, and in time becomes so much of a
machine that he can close his eyes and
never miss a blow or spoil a cut He is a
mere automaton, yet the file cutters of
Sheffield. England, are declared to be of
all mechanics the most skilled and expert
with the hammer and cold chisel.
One need not search the machine shops
and factories for examples of wonderful
skill and expertness developed by repeti
tion and sameness. He finds It in the ele
vator man who stops his swiftly moving
car so that Its floor level coincides with
the fixed floor level. He can see it in
the gripman or raotorman who brings his
cable train or trolley car to a stop with
the rear platform exactly over the side
walk crossing. The dressmaker, swiftly
plying her needle, discloses It in every
stitch. The bricklayer, building a wall
exactly plumb, demonstrates another
phase of subconscious precision;- and the
skilled paper hanger, cutting a roll of
wallpaper lengthwise without gauge or
mark, seldom falls to make the edges
parallel.

But it is the engineer of a high-speed
Iacomotlve who has attained almost ideal
perfection "In combining time accuracy,
speed certainty and distance judgment to
meet time table requirements. The man
at the throttle, controlling with the nicest
discrimination his steam propelled pro
jectile, weighing sometimes a hundred
tons, has a new problem to solve every
time he Begins a trip. The wind and
weather, the condition of the rails, the
weight of his train, the opposing move
ments of other trains, his own physical
condition, are factors which enter into
the problem.. He must go a certain dis
tance within a specified number of min
utes, making specified stops between ter
minals, and he must arrive and leave "on
time." This means variations of speed
betwÂ«Â«n points, and yet day. after day
he drives his Iron horse,' now urging it
to its highest speed, now soothing it to
a quiet run, arriving and departing to
the minute, reeling " off the mlles^-trlth
confident certainty and finally pulling up
at the terminalâ "on time.". ;'
It's a wonderful performance when you
come to think of it*

..ADHERE was one. story the re
â¢ â¢ g porters didn't get," said the
<Â£ big policeman to the new
man en the beat. ./'It wa3
when I was doing quarantine duty in
Chinatown. My partner and myself were
detailed to watch a room in which three
Chinese were confined by the Board of
Health. All the entrances to the room
had been sealed by the doctors except tine
skylight, and we watched the Chinks
through that.
. "It was twelve-hour watches then, and
the time went slowly. In order to help
things along, we fell into the habit of
taking a bottle of germ exterminator up
on the roof with us. One night the fog
came in and we drank up all the exter
minator before midnight. I volunteered
to go after some more. "When I returned
my partner was fast asleep, and by the
light of a coal oil lamp In the room be
low I could see that there were only two
Chinks in the room. I woke him up and
told him that our jobs were things of the
past. His gray matter commenced work
ing overtime instantly. Finally he evolved
a saving plan, and we followed it.
"We battened down the skylight and
went out into the byways of Chinatown.
We waited until we found a Chinaman
who generally resembled our escape and
we shanghaied him. Of course, he strug
gled, but we carried him tq the roof and
shot him through the skylight. Then we
resumed our occupation of beating off the
fog with our germ exterminator.
â¢A Board of Health inspector came aloi;sr
and peered through the skylight. 'One
of them seems to have gone insane,' he
said. The captured Chink was making
noises as though he had swallowed a
crockery store and it had begun to break
up Inside of him.
" 'That's due to long confinement.' I
said. We kept the poor Chink seventeen
days, and he gradually recovered from his
insanity." Â¦Â¦
OIL ON TROUBLED WATERS-
Subscriher. City. The origin of the
phrase, ' "Pouring oil on troubled
waters," ia lost in antiquity, but
it is pot a Biblical phrase. The no
tion that oil will smooth troubled
water is very old indeed. The Syrian
fishermen have been wont for time
out Â«of mind to pour oil on the sea when
caught in a storm far from land. Tho
boatmen of the Persian Gulf have always
been in the habit of towlns astern their
frail craft bladders filled with oil. these
bladders pricked so as to permit a gentle
leakage of the oil In the wake of their
boats. In book 3. chapter XV, In "The
Miracles of Bishop Aldan." Bedes' Eccle
siastical History, is Riven what Is said
to be. the earliest account of the use of
oil to ouell troubled waters. "I know,"
said Bishop Aldan as he gave to a priest
named TJlla some holy oil, "that soon
after you shall * embark you will meet
with a storm and a contrary wind; but
then remember to cast this oil which I
now slve you into the sea, and Imme
diately the storm shall cease and you
shall have pleasant, calm weather and
return home in safety." It was a witty
Irish saUor who said nf oil on the water
that "it makes the waves so slippery that
the wind can't get hold of them."
CONSERVATISM still characterizes trade and cau
tion in buying is the dominant feature' 1 now. From
all sections of the country come the reports that
buyers are taking no more goods than they need and that
the liberal and often thoughtless forward purchasing of the
past several years is a thing of the past. Steel mills, iron
furnaces, copper) coal and i r on mines have, shut down in a
number of widely separated regions, another general re
duction in the price of pig iron is announced in spite of the
recently diminished output and a movement is on foot to
still further cut down the production unless business im
proves.
Soft coal prices are. held up purely by combination and
would drop if left alone. The textile mills are no longer
working overtime and refusing to accept orders where
prompt delivery is required. They are now willing to ac
cept all business offered. .The only briskness worthy of
note among the great Eastern manufacturing districts is
shown by the cotton mills, which report rather more activ
ity, and by the footwear factories of New 'England, which\j
continue to do an active business. The movement in gen- |
eral merchandise throughout the country is less than at
this season for several years, and the decline in prices, ac
cording to Dun's index number, on which the cost of<fiving
is based, is slightly over 3 per cent compared with 1902,
and'the decline from May 1,1902, which was :the< highest
point touched in recent years, is now about 5 per cent.
The index number of commodity prices October 1 was
$97-37, against $98.54 September 1. The chief ..has
been in breadstuff's and meats, the latter having declined
about 14 per cent during the past year.
It will be remembered that a year or so ago, when the
so-called "beef barons" marked up quotations for meats
with no apparent compunction and the people and press
all over the country were indignantly protesting against
the summary proceeding, that the prediction was freely
made that the days of moderate-priced meats had forever
passed and that in the near future beef would be to 1 the
workingman of America as it is to the average European
â beyond the reach of his purse and eaten only on Sundays
and holidays as a treat. -But it seems that Providence is
ordaining otherwise and that from present indications the
American wage earner will stifl be a beef eater for a good
many years to -come. For which may we be truly thankful.
As for cured meats, such as the products of the hog, the
Western packing markets are dragging and for some
months prices have been held up by main strength alone,
while the general expectation is that the markets must
fall to a still lower level. Briefly, the cost of living is de
creasing and has been for months, though the decline is so
gradual that it is noticeable only to those few commercial
statisticians who keep close track of prices. To the general
public it is imperceptible, though it is going on silently all
the time, like the noiseless formation of frosting on the
window panes during the cold nights of winter.
So much for general trade. As for finance, the conditions
have been further unsettled of late by the suspension of a
couple of trust companies in Baltimore, a bank at Pitts
burg and rumors of impending trouble in St. Louis, though
the latter were not realized. All this tended to still further
demoralize Wall street and led to further liquidation.
Money, however, was not materially affected, and rates
showed no change worthy of note. It is gratifying to
serve that thus far this fall the stringency in funds expected
to accompany the regular autumnal movement of the crops
has not materialized, and when we Tecall the sweat we were
in last spring over what was going to happen in this direc
tion during the fall we cannot but remember that fine old
remark about crossing a bridge before we get to it. It may
be that funds may yet be tight, but they are not thus far, and
it may turn out that we did a good deal of worrying over
nothing after all.
I The usual figures are running rather against 1903. The
weekly bank clearings showed a loss of 20.2 per cent last
week as compared with the corresponding week last year,
while the failures were 279, against 239, and included several
large ones, as mentioned above.
The leading local feature last week was the bankers' con
vention of course.) It was noticeable that the whole trend
of expression among the bankers during the meeting was
toward thorough confidence in the sound prosperity of the
country, a general belief that it would continue and that the
present lull in business was simply the natural recession from
a period of over-expansion in speculation and exploiting of
vast syndicates. If there was any apprehension or pessimism
among the bankers they certainly did not show it and all
addresses expressed surprise and admiration over the solid
commercial basis of the country.
the thousands. ' Line cannot draw from Republican ranks
any support save that of a few personai friends/ but Crocker
can and has obtained fro.m the ranks' of conservative Democ
racy hundreds of who come to him because they
recognize that ; in this contest he stands for the best inter
ests of all classesv of people and gives clear assurance of a
good administration carried out from first to last on busi
ness lines.
Up to this, time the most notable feature of the campaign
has been the \ magnificent "canvass* of Mr. Crocker. Lane is
one of the brightest and brainiest campaigners of the time.
His friends justly counted a great deal upon his capacity in
that respect to overcome the heavy odds against him, but
they did not foresee that he would be met by a man who,
without any of the arts of rhetoric, would prove more than
his match. jThat, however, is what has happened. Mr.
Crocker has met Lane upon his own ground and beaten him.
As matters stand now the chances, are) that the whirlwind
finish will be made by Crocker and that, independent voters
will gather round him and help to make his victory a sweep
ing one for the whole ticket.

usual the inevitable Swain was under the
ball, and before ha could bÂ« caught was
well in the Brooklyn field.
The ball was fumbled in an attempt to
make a field goal and' was lost to tha
Brooklyns. The Brooklyns tried a place
kick, sent the ball to the center line, and
from there carried for a twenty-yard run
by Sullivan.
At the close of the half the teams wera
lined up in the center of the field, with tha
Union team in possession of the ball.
In the second half Brooklyn kicked off.
but was blocked and the ball covered by
Brooklyn. The ball went to Union on a
fumble, but was regained on downs.
Brooklyn tried .new tactics, and after
the second down, with one yard to gain,
the ball was passed to Swain, who made
the run of the day by rushing down a
zigzag course of seventy yards to the sec
ond touchdown. Swain kicked both goals,
making the score 12-0.

Among the military marksmen, George
H. Seyden was foremost, with' 47 points
to his credit. He stands the best chance
to win the Slebe medal, as he has already
captured it twle* in succession.
"Otto Bremer was top man in the re
entry rifle match of the Golden Gate Club,
with 227 rings . to his credit. He was
closely followed by Al Gehret, who made
226 and 223. Both these marksmen are
shooting close together, and, - it will not
be- until the last score of the year is
fired that supremacy can be determined.
G. Bw Frahm's two scores of 95 and 94 In
the pistol match were the highest of the
day. ;
The riflemen were well represented yes
terday at Shell Mound Park Range. Her
man Huber of the Norddeutscher Schuet
zen Club was far ahead of all the marks
men who participated. His good score of
454 rings in his medal string is a record
seldom made, and will stand high In tbs
club shooting for some time to come.

Senators Hit Hard.
The first inning brought forth the only
tally for the Cripples. Rockenfltld drew
n pass and Murdock laid up against the
lfathrr and smashed It out tÂ» Â«.he center
field fence. Then hard luck interfered
and the ball hit a post, preventing it from
hurdling th' 1 enclosure. Any way. it was
a two-cushioner and it brought Rocky tn.
The Serators did not get n\en a h!t
Â¦ till ihr- forrth. Then Casey drove one
out to lÂ»ft, ?tole second and arrived on
Cjr Townsend'5 Mnplcr to right. In the
Fixth the bis th!n^ was exploded. Casry
began ft with another single and HUde
brand bunted along the first base line.
Moskiman booted the ball and they
were both safe. McLaughlin Facrificed
and wh*>n Townsend got a pa?? the ba?3
were all filled. Egan tore off a r^al torrid
one. but Bil! Deveresux fielded it and
shot it to the plate in r.me to catch
Casey. Gorton got depey and threw the
ball wild to first. Before Mess^rly
could nt< k it up and line it to the plate
Hfldebrano was under the tape.
Doyle !ed off with a plng'.e to center for
the Senators in the seventh. Hojran
bunted successfully ard Kee:> brought
r>oy3e in with the final run for Mike by
sousing the ball past third.
The Â« "ripples had a e'hanc- in the eighth
when O'Hara hit. Rockenfleld flew out to
deep center and O'Hara did not get back
to the bag In time to save himself from
being doubled up. Again, in the second,
with Mfsserly on third and l>crton on
f^cond. Moskiman lined ore to Casey.
He promptly executed a dou?!? rnd saved
another tally. The score:

Twice again did the Cripples, under the
chaperonage of Peter Lohman. succumb
yesterday before the onslaught of the
Senators on the baseball field. In the
tnorrJng', on Peter's own battle ground,
the trick was easy to turn. W hen the
srasie broke up, the Senators were there
11 to 4. At Recreation Park the Cripples
fought a trifle harder and made the Sen
ators go Bome ere thev landed, 3 'to 1.
Yesterday's double victory entrenches
the Senators In the second position by
sevcraJ points. They fattened their per
centage -J'jring the last week by taking
five out of six from Peter's maimed toss
Â«nÂ».
Mike's followers went through the two
gam-* yesterday without a Ktani on the:r
fieldir.gr averages. Keefe pitched the best
game of his career at Recreation Park.
The college younpsier had everything. In
every inning but the first the ("ripples suc
cumbed to the influence or his bewilder
ing twister*. Then he had control, and
only walked two men. one of whom
â¢cored.
Mosklman was brought out on the slab
for the first time in many moons, and
although he did not win, hÂ«Â» twirled a
beautiful game. The rest of the team
seemed delighted with the ntc-ser.c-e of
the Doc in the box. end they backed him
op well except In a few Instances.

From present indication? it looks as
though about the whole field would face
the starter, ar.d there is no doubt it will
be a race well worth seeing, there being
several horses that figure very close to
gether.
On form Embarrassment looks to be the
favorite, and from what ws*s heard at the
Metropolitan Turf Club to-night he will
be quoted at about 2 to 1. with fours
quoted against Rosand. Stamping Ground
and Duke of Kendal.
The event of interest on to-morrow's
card is the Aqueduct handicap, at one and
oÂ«e-sixteenth miles. This race will bring
out a fair field, in which three-year-olds
have the call. There is an even dozen
carded to go, of which all arc three-year
olds but two. these being Lord Badge and
Warranted, both tarrying lighter weight
than any of the others.
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â Racing opens at
Aqueduct to-morrow afternoon. The track
Is practically new, and the addition of a
straightaway course for two-year-old
racers â¢will be an innovation.
There is every reason to expect a con
tinuance of sport of equally high quality
as that at Brighton Beach during the
.meeting that closed yesterday. The Aque
duct stakes have filled well, both as to
quality and quantity, and few of the
horses that helped to make racing inter
esting at the seaside track will be miss-
Ing when the shift is made to Aqueduct.

Nearly 100 members of the Olympic Ath
letic Club took part in the cross-country
walk yesterday through picturesque Ma
rin County. President William Greer Har
rison led the athletes over the steep hills
at a fast pace and within two hours ten
miles were covered and the pedestrians
had their appetites sharpened by the brac
ing air. It was the initial walk arranged
by Max Rosenfeld, the new captain of the
club. There was a large attendance out
of compliment to the latter.
The members crossed 'the bay on the 9
o'clock boat and journeyed by train to
Fairfax. This was the starting point for
the ten-mile Jaunt over the hills and
through the canyons. Harry V. Ramsdell
and Mr. Harrison set the pace and. kept
the members moving until the steep places
were reached, when some fell by the way
side. Others tried short cuts In order to
save themselves arduous labor.

. : Griffin will . meet Long and give him
odds of "3-6" and "owe â¢. 2-6.". Allen will
allow ; Janes i odds of ; "owe! 15 12-6." Of
these four players Griffin's chances are
undoubtedly the best.
:% The ; tournament committee has run the
event off in a. clever.ma nner, but- allowed
matters to drag yesterday. . The specta
tors were fully prepared / to . see the event
completed: down to the 'finals and there
was ample time to do so. : One of the play
ers claimed hs was -too tired to fjo on,
after playing; but three sets 'and conse
quently play >was ; called off , for the : day.
Thej event, will- be completed next Sun-
The first match played was an uncom
pleted one between James CodÂ© and Hor
ace Mann. "Each had a set. to. his credit
and the deciding one was' won ' by Mann,
9-7. As U3ual, Code had a big: lead and
needed but one point to win and as usual
he was unable to get that one little point!
The matches -resulted as follows:
: Clarence Griffin was. really the star
player. He j received a slight handicap
from George Baktrâ "owe 3-6"â and beat
him with ease. "Peck" won the first set
6-1 and had a lead of 4-1 In the second.
Baker made a stand here, and won the
next two games, but the "little fellow"
ran out the next two. Griffin played re
markably well In all parts of the court
and handled Baker's perfect lobs in clever
fashion. The winner is undoubtedly the
most promising of the park players.
Herbert Long, and; Guy; Lytton played
the longest and most stubbornly contest
ed match of â¢ the ' tournament. All three
sets went to deuce-vantage. The score in
favor, of Long, who allowed' his opponent
odds of "3-6," was 12-10, 7-9, 7-5.
Will Allen showed how well his game is
suited to handicap conditions, j He allow
ed Neil Baker odds of "owe 15 2-C" and
won two sets out of three. Baker won
the first set as he pleased, and dfd not
allow his opponent a game. The former
was somewhat overconfident after this
and did not play as hard as he should.
Allen changed his style of play, in the last
two sets and won them by aggressive
work at ; the net. Most of Baker's lobs
fell short and were easy for the scratch
man to handle. . â¢-.â¢-"
J. Drummond MacGavin and George
Baker, who were considered by many to
have the best chances of winning the
event, were both beaten. George Janes
defeated MacGavin in a close match, the
outcome of which was in doubt until the
Â¦end. In the final set MacGavin led at 5-4
and looked a winner,. but Janes took the
next three games. MacGavIn's physical
condition was anything but good. He got
up from a sick bed to play the match,
and consequently was in poor form. Jane3
played his usual dashing game. He was
rather wild In the back court, but at the
net did some hard smashing. Had Mac-
Gavin gone to the net on all occasions as
he should, the result would probably have
been different.
A large number of spectators occupied
all of the available space around the
Golden Gate Park tennis courts yesterday
and witnessed several good matches in
the handicap tournament. Only' four of
the ten players who competed yesterday
are left In the tournament. They are Her
bert Long, Clarence Griffin, George Janes
and Will Allen.

that the three principal shipyards In the

The departure of the torpedo-boat de

from XorfolJc fcr the China station may
be locked for at an early date. The voy
age of 15,000 miles Is expected to take
about six months, and the progress of the
vessels will be watched with much inter

ried by these boats the course acrcja the
Atlantic will be circuitous. The first stop
will be made at Bermuda, thence to Bar
badoes, from which latter the northern
snores of South America will be made
and hugged down to ports in Brazil, from
which the flotilla will steer past the isl

for the tons voyage, on which they will
be convoyed by the cruiser Baltimore.
Quite a number of destroyers of less
size than the American boats have made
the voyage from Europe to Asia.- There
are five British destroyers, ranging from
232 tons to 230 ton*, on the China station,
acd another, the Virago, of 3G0 tons, is at
Esquimau. Russian destroyers varying
from 250 to 230 tons have successfully
made the 3000-mile voyage from Kron-

THE announcement is made for the
twelfth time in the last six
months that P.ear Admiral Royal
Bird Bradford is to resign as chief
cf the bureau of equipment, hav
ing consented to go to sea. He now
stands number eleven en the list of cap
tains, will be promoted to the actual rank
of rear admiral within two years and will
retire In XSK. Kis service record to date
, is fifteen years nine months at sea, twen
ty-four years three months shore duty
and one year eleven months unemployed.
He has had no ?ea duty In his present
grade, and only three years two months

cemmand was on the cruiser Montgomery,
from July. 1536, to July, 1S37, from, which
latter date he has been chief of the bu

as a member cf the board of construction
he has been rather too conservative, and
his efforts to win over other bureau chiefs
to his ideas cf the proper designing of
ships has been the cause of some friction.
It is due to his extreme conservatism that

means the Admiral will know whether

The damage done to the old Belieisle by
exploding a torpedo against her side- be
low water shows that coal bunkers are
not of much value as a protection. It
was net alone that the cofferdam built
against the side was blown away, but the
torpedo charge burst through the ship
in every direction. The hole in her side
is twelve feet by eight feet and the coal
cellulose was scattered In every direction.
An Austrian battleship name Erzherzog
Karl was launched October 4 at Trieste,
wherp another ship of the same type and
size is under construction. The building
of these ships indicates a deoarture from
the previous policy, which was less am
bitious as to size and armament. The
largest armored ships hitherto built were
the Arpad and Bahenberg, launched, re
spectively, in 1201 and 150C These ships
are of 6340 tens, whereas the newer ships
are of 10,600 tons. The main batterv of
the new craft consists cf four 9.4-Inch,
eight 7.5-Lnch and six 6-lnch, an armament
proportionately heavier as to displace
ment than any other Austrian battleships
afloat or designed. The principal dimen
sions of the ships are: Length. 350.4 feet;
breadth. 72.13 feet; draught. 24.6 feet. The
engines are of 14.000-horsepower, calcu
lated to give a speed cf nineteen knots,
and the bunker capacity cf 1315 tons is
sufficient for 4200 miles at ten knots
speed. All the material. Including guns
and armor. Is of domestic manufacture.
RUSSIA'S LATEST BATTXESHTP.
The Russian battleship Cesarevltch. re
cently ccEcoleted at La Seyne, France,
has far ex<fteded the speed requirements,
making nearly 1S.5 knots at her trial, an
excess of about one and a half knots
over the contract. The Cesarevitch is 330
feet in length, 73 feet 6 inches beam and
displaces 13,110 tons on a mean draught
of 26 feet 3 Inches. The battery is com
posed of four 12-inch and twelve 6-inch,
twenty 12-pounders, twenty 3-pounders.
ten Maxims and four torpedo tubes, of
which two are submerged. She is driven
by twin-screw engines of 15,300-hcrsepow

ville type. The armor belt extending all
around the vessel varies from 10 inches to
4 Inches and the side above is 6 Inches
thick. It ha.s also two armored decks,
the uocer one 2.7 Inches and the lower
cne 1.3 Inches In thickness. The normal
coal supply, is 900 tons, with a capacity
for 1323 tons, sufiiclent for steaming 35CO
miles at ten knots. The principal weights
with their percentage of the displacement
are: Hull. 5123 tons (.33.1 per cent); armor,
K50 tons (27.1 per cent); armament. 1540
tens (11.7 per cent); machinery'. 1430 tons
(10.9 per cent), and coal. 500 tons, or 7 per

SAX DIEGO, Oct. 23.â A peculiar suit
was commenced in the Superior Court i
yesterday by the Pacific Coa3C Steamship j
Company against R. A. Graham, now of
Xew York. Ten years ago Graham, who |
was then a railroad contractor and buifd- '
er and who was making money in tha f
Coos Bay country, shipped to San Diego j
a part of his grading outflt, consisting of f
sixteen dumpcarts. several wheel-scrapers j
and a patent grader. He directed that
they be storsd until he called for them.
This was done, and fcr ten years, lacking
five days, they have occupied a corner in \
the company's warehouse. Graham has I
gone out of the country and has probably !
forgotten where he had the articles ;
stored, if Indeed, he recalls that he once
owned it. The storage charges cow j
amount to CSS. ar.d the platntlff ask3 that \
the court direct that the articles be sold j
to pay the charges.

while cruising about Gabriola Island,
Harry Rogers and some friends entered
a cavern, where the waves washed in by
northern storms Â¦ had eaten away the
rock, leaving magnificent sculpture of
odd-shaped patterns in the sandstone.
The gallery consists cf a chamber 350
feet long, with a floor twenty-one feet
wide and a roof formed by an overhang

yond the floor ledge. The overhanging
roof has been sculptured Into hundreds

sea, presenting an endless variety of
forms. Amons the largest figures is one
of an Indian reclining against a walL
This figure was accurately described by

following the course.
Mr. Terhune says: "The boy who has not learned to box has not yet
made his own acquaintance. - In other words he Is ignorant of his own mus-
cles, his own power or limitations, and even of his own temperament. For
boxing teaches all these things. It strengthens and lends deftness, speed and
endurance to the body; It teaches the brain to think and to think quickly. It
teaches courage and coolness, and, above all. it teaches the art of controlling
one's temper."

HOME MTJSICAI* EDUCATION FOB CHILDEEN".
rwsnans&DAXS.)
1500 to 2000 words once a week, illustrated.
The writer 13 ANICE TERHUXE. song writer, formerly director of music
in the College of St. John the Baptist. New York.
Several articles of this series were submitted to F. H. Grlswold. the "mu-
sical sharp" of the Chicago Record Herald, who expressed himself concerning
them as follows:
"It seems to me these articles would find many readers, as vthelr tone is
pleasant and attention Is called to things which might otherwise escape the
notice of parents who wish their children to study music. The comparative
newness of the plan would probably tend to make many anxious to know how
it is applied to the teaching of children."
Mrs. Terhune says: "The course is designed to enable parents to give home
musical education to their children. Each step Is explained In such a way that
any mother, even though she herself may not be a musician, can Impart the
lessons to her child. The practical results will at once be apparent.
"I have not given a theoretical disquisition on music, but have explained
each detail simply and completely, as though I were a music teacher deliver-
ing the lesson to a pupil.
"Although these lessons have never before been printed, many competent
musicians have gained their entire knowledge by the course I have set down.
and I can guarantee success to any one who will conscientiously follow it.
"Each step Is explained with a simplicity that brings It within the reach
of the least precocious chlld-
"Many people ilo not understand the necessity of getting the muscles of the
hands and arms Into perfect condition for plajinsr. before attempting to use
them at the piano. This all-Important feature I have fuly explained, and the
course begins with some light exercises for fingers and arms, given In such
a way as to make them interesting and entertaining to botb pupil and teacher.
"These first exercises will also be of great value to persona farther ad-
vanced In music, whose progress Is Impeded by lack of manual facility.
"In connection with this, I teach the pupil how to practice. Practicing is
in Itself an art. and much time may be saved and mental strain be avoided If
the student understands exactly how to work.
"How to acquire a sweet, ringing tone, and to gain control over the tech-
nicalities of the piano come next.
"After this; we take up reading music (and here I explain everything that
the pupil is likely to find in ordinary music, from the simplest musical sign
to the most complex), memorising, sight reading, phrasing, duet playing, ac-
companiments, etc. The pupil Is taught how to listen to music and how to
interpret It. The management cf the pedal is another important item, often
misunderstood and therefore abused.
"The scales, too, though frequently made a bugbear, are in this course cf
instruction reduced to a system at once interesting and entertaining to the
pupil.
"Every possible aid to the student. In the way of example and explana-
tion, is given in each branch of the subject; and also advice as to what music
a child should hear.
"How the child's voice should be trained so as to strengthen It instead of
straining It Is also taken up In practical detail.
"There can be no question as to the practicability of these lessons. Mu-
f!c Is as easily taught in this way. by any one possessing a thorough knowl-
edge of the subject, as are hints In cooking, housekeeping, physical culture
or dressmaking."
The series will be rounded out wjth articles by some widely known
authorities in music.

According to reliable private reports, the
condition of internal affairs In Bulgaria
Is alarming. All of the revolutionary
bands which were operating in Ea3tera
Macedonia, have returned to Bulgaria. The
streets of Sofia are thronged with insur
gents, who beg for food and shelter. It
Is feared that these Insurgents wtll create
disturbances in the country before long 1 .
unless a decided improvement ts effected
in Macedonian affairs. The Bulgarian
Government is said to be demobiiizina' its
reserves with great reluctance, and ai>
prehensions are expected in many <v&ar
ters that the Turks will take advantage
of the situation and attack Bulgaria at
about the tiiae of the approaching elec
tion, when the Bulgarian Government will
be obliged to send the reserves to their
homes.
VIENNA. Oct. S.â Two Bulgarian mis
sionaries, named Furnajleff and Popoff .
are about to leave here to make a tour
of the United States to raise funds for
destitute Macedonians. They are gradu
ate* of American colleges, the former
having studied at Princeton and the latter
at Hamilton. N. T. %

He was walking along Steuart street and
between Market and Mission streets the
robber came out of a. doorway and or
dered Wilkens to thro'w up his hands.
The robber made a movement as If to
draw a revolver from his hip pocket, and
"Wilkens thought ft was the better part
of discretion to obey the command so he
held up his hands. He thought the footpad
must have been an old hand at the busi
ness, from the rapid manner in which he
went through his pockets. After taking
the $15 the footpad told Wilkena to walk
slowly away and not make any outcry.

Leslie Morosco and Leila Shaw opened
at the Grand Opera-house yesterday
afternoon with a musical farce comedy
called "Spotless Town." The name indi
cates nothing, and neither does the play.
It serves, however, as a vehicle for the
production of a number of clever spe
cialties. Leila Shaw, in the character of
Fleur-de-Lis, a French cafe chantant who
comes to America for the dollars, devel
oped ability that with proper nourishment
should place her in the front rank of
vaudeville artists. She dances well, sings
convincingly and, given proper material,
might be something of an actress.
Harry Ford, who is Injected into the
farce' as -a baker for no obvious reason,
is one of the best palmers that ever ap
peared on the stage here. His card tricks
are exceptionally good. William Law
rence, who figures in the cast as a husband
with an unappreclative wife, assumed as
a specialty the character of a "down
east farmer, and showed In dress and ac
tion a perfectly typical specimen of bu
colic Yankeeism. Unfortunately for the
success of his act, the stories he tpld were
old, and his song, to. the tune of "A Hot
Time," fairly tottered with accrued years.
Bernard Williams,: as a French visitor,
was fairly successful, and Frank Rowan's
representation of a lawyer's clerk in love
with the French singer was good. The
farce calls for performers appearing in dif
ferent parts of the theater in trough
house" work, and this feature seemed; to
please the audience vastly. The play will
continue throughout the week.
If you want to see a good knock-me
down-and-step-on-me show, one of the
regular old horse play and dancing shows,
go to "Rudolph and Adolph" at the Cali
fornia. Don't anticipate too much in the
line of plot; don't even' look forward' to
high-class farce. What you will see will
make you laugh, but you will not be able
to explain why. The' brothers, Charles
A. and H..P. Mason, are good; they sing
some funny songs and do some funny
steps. Miss Bessie Phillips is a clever
dancer. Miss Rutter and Miss McKenzie
are comely and there are fourteen girls in
pretty dresses to nil in the chinks of the
piece with songs and poses. This consti
tutes you money's worth, but you don't
get more than that.
Wenona and Frank's rifle shooting de
serves a better place than at the begin
ning of the programme. It is stunning.
The holdovers are all good. The Water
burys and,Tenney play on any instrument
that happens to be around and make
music; Tom Browne does double-stopping
on his whistle to continued wonder, and
Crawford and Manning's black face turn
makes twenty minutes' persuasive laugh
ter. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
I did not see Herbert Lloyd at the Or
pheum last weekâ my loss. Yours, too, if
you have not. For those who have so
far missed himâ though most of the town
seemed to be In the big theater yesterday
afternoon, Lloyd's turn in the vaudeville
dictionary would be called a comedy jug
gling act. There is enough of the juggling
to go round and much less than one wants
of the accompanying fun. Lloyd's humor,
like lightning, never strikes twice In; the
same '.place. When you expect another
dig in the ribs it chucks you under the
chin, and waiting for another chuck -you
are caught In the midriff. Just the dif
ference between Lloyd and the others of
his kind is the difference 'between Miss
Tyson of McWatters and Tyson and Elfla
Fay, the difference between cleverness
and genius. And Lloyd's, like Miss Fay's
fun. Is difficult to nail down. To say that
he takes off an overcoat and then brushes
his hair, before a glass in the back of it
dots not suggest hysterics, but it goes
far to induce them. Also to write that his
disrobing actâ the discarded overcoat "dis
covers" him in a ballet skirtâ conducted
behind a screen thiat'modestly reaches to
his knees can be rapturously (and de
cently) funny, is to invite Incredulity.
But so it is, as funny as the incandescent
wart on Mr. Lloyd's nose, or as the
dummy legs he tacks on and folds round
his neck. If humor* be the incongruous
and unexpected this humorist has cer
tainly struck paying soil. V
There are good numbers in plenty on the
bill, a dog and cat turn among the new
ones, that even the Orpheum has not seen
bettered. The beasties are Goleman's,
and handsome creatures they are. They
do everything but talk, and seem to do
that. Pussy is a novelty on the stage and
one wonders why after seeing these clever
little animals. Two of them, a snowy, blue
ribboned aristocrat, and a gray Angora,
showed at least as much intelligence as
the dogsâ with whom 'they appeared to be
on anything but the proverbial terms.
The children shouldn't miss these.
McWatters and Tyson have a cleverish
and odd turn in "Scenes From a Dressing
room," in which they Introduce some
capital imitationsâ so far as McMatters
goes. Miss Tyson does not quite get
there. She does 'the monkey trick a la
Fay, but there i3 too much and too many
of it. It -is not the flash of apish mimicry
of Blfie Fay, but a fieaful chart of the
little brother of man. Her drinking song
is much better, though suffering from the
same overplus of detail, and Miss Tyson
is singing on a sprained voice â one
wouldn't mind, but the original happens
to be gocd. The acts ends with an illu
sion, Herrmann fashion, that becomes a
little trustful as three nymphs where but
one was put In an appearance after the
vanishing lady has duly vanished. They
bring some new songs. v"
Cadigan was last seen alive at 11:30 p.
m. on Sunday. October 18, by Hugh Drls
coll at the latter's saloon at 24 Moss
street. Cadigan had been drinking to a
considerable extent and when he left
signified his intention of immediately go-
Ing to his home at 1610 Leavenworth
street. That was the last seen of him un
til his body was recovered from the
waters of the bay yesterday morning.
The transfer found in his pocket bears
the date of October IS and was Issued
on an inbound car of the Eighth and
Eighteenth street line. None of the light
face figures denoting a. m. or the black
face figures denoting p. m. are punched.'
As the portion of the transfer bearing
the midnight numeral is missing, it is
supposed that Cadigan after leaving his
friend's saloon walked to Eighth street
and boarded a car bound toward Market
street, receiving a transfer from the con
ductor. It is supposed that he fell asleep
and rode to the end of the road on the
return trip. <â¢ As the car stops but a short
distance from the bay at Kentucky and
Eighteenth streets he may have alighted
and staggered into the water. An effort
will be made, to find the conductor who
issued the transfer in an endeavor to
clear up the mystery surrounding Cadi
gan's tragic end. Â¦ #
With' features so horribly distorted as
to be almost unrecognizable the body of
William Cadigan, the grocer who mys
teriously disappeared last Sunday night
was found floating in the bay off Beale
street wharf yesterday morning by John
Nellson and Antone Kohle. The body was
secured with a rope and removed to the
Morgue by Deputy Coroner Mike Brown.
There was nothing in the "pockets of
the deceased that would tend to establish
his identity, with the exception of a
bunch of keys and a transfer of the
Eighth and Eighteenth street car line,
.dated October 18 and bearing the number
05543. Late yesterday afternoon Michael
Drlscoll, a partner of the dead man in the
grocery and bar at 1612 Leavenworth
street, and John Moynihan called at the
Morgue and viewed the remains. They
were unable to positively identify the
deceased. In company with Detective "An
thony they repaired to the grocery with
the keys found in the pocket. The keys
were tried and found to fit all of the
locks, and thus the identification was
fully established. \
Manager Vosmer had stationed four
men at the guy ropes to cut the balloon
from Its moorings. It was understood that
these men were to respond to a given sig
nal,-but they became confused and made
an error. Before the rope that confines
the balloon overhead had been released
the big bag started skyward, carrying the
aeronaut with it. The balloon lunged to
ward the ground, and as it did so Ware's
body struck a small fence and smashed
the structure to pieces.
Then the inflated bag dropped lower and
the aeronaut landed on the ground. His
left wrist had been fastened to the tra.
peze, and when the balloon again ascend
ed he went with it, hanging by one hand.
The crowd stood in terror, knowing that
an acldent was inevitable. The balloon
pitched about, and in almost a second
Ware was thrown on telephone and elec
tric light wires, and with the parachute
dropped to the ground.
When picked up Ware was found to
have been severely burned on the arms
and shoulders. The current burned the
rope that connected the balloon with the
parachute and the balloon started sky-
CRASHES INTO FENCE.
Two weeks ago Beals, who was an ex
perienced balloonist, was killed near the
chain of lakes in the park. He was in
the act of making a descent when he sud
denly released his hold from the para
chute and dropped nearly fifty feet to the
roadway beneath him. When taken
to the Park Emergency Hospital It was
found that death had already ensued.
Charles Vosmer, manager of the gardens
from which Beals made his last ascent,
conceived the* idea of a benefit for the
dead man's family, and after a consulta
tion with the owners it* was agreed that
the proceeds of yesterday's entertainment
should be donated to the widow and or
phans.
Ware, who was practically a novice in
the business, offered to make, an ascen
sion. . He declared that the cause was a
good one and that he would assume all
risks. His ofTer was accepted and he ap
peared on the grounds at the appointed
time. There was a strong wind blowing
when the balloon was being Inflated. The
current of air that came from the ocean
caused the immense bag to sway to and
fro, art* when the time for the ascension
came considerable of the gas had escaped.
WARE'S NARROW ESCAPE.
Â¦ A dramatic balloon ascension waa made
yesterday afternoon by Claude Ware, a
Boldier in the Sixty-fourth Coast Artillery,
at the Coney Island gardens. Owing to a
mistake in releasing the balloon the aero
naut was hurled first against a fence,
then, to the ground and finally thrown
upon a string of electric wires, where he
was severely burned. That, he did not lose
his life is a miracle.
A peculiar Incident of the accident was
that Ware- was making an ascension for
the benefit of William Beals, an aeronaut
who was killed two weeks ago. He volun
teered his services, although he had made
but three ascents, in the interest of char
ity, and the feat almost brought him to
the same fate that the man whose family
he was "assisting suffered. It was corisid
ered singular to the large crowd assem
bled that he was not killed. When he ap
peared in the gardens after having landed
on the wires and ground a round of con
gratulations was in order. *
