CHICAGO, Dec. 30.â The fire
in the Iroquois Theater broke out
during the second act of the play
"Mr.' Bluebeard," which was the
first dramatic; production present
ed in the theater since it's erection.
The ', company, which was very
large, escaped to the street in
safety", nearly all of the players,'
however, 1 being compelled to flee
into the snowy streets with no
clothing but their stage costumes.
A few members of the company
sustained minor injuries, but none
was seriously hurt.
. Accounts of the - origin of the
fire are conflicting, and none. ce'rf;
tain, but the. best theory given is
that an electric wire Jon the lower,
part of. a piece of drop s scenery
suddenly^ broke and was grounded."
The fire spread rapidly toward the
front of the stage, causing the
members of the chorus; who were
then engaged in the performance,
to flee to the wings with screams
of terror. The fire in itself up to
this time was not serious, and pos
sibly could have been checked had
hot the asbestos curtain failed to
work.
CURTAIN FAILS TO LOWER
As Goon as the fire was discov
ered Eddie, Foy, the chief come
dian of the company, shouted to
lower the curtain, and this was.
immediately done. It descended
about . half waV and then stuck.
The fire thus was given practically
a>* flue through < which a strong
dra ft was setti ngy aided by the
doors, ' which had been thrown
- As soon as the flames first ap
peared beyond the curtain a man
in the rear of the hall shouted
"Fire! fire!" and the entire audi
ence arose as one person and made
for the doors. â¢
It is, believed* that the explosion
open in the front of the theater.
With a roar and a bound the
flames shot through the opening
over the heads of the people on the
f*st floor and, reaching clear up
to those in the first balcony,
caught them and burned them to
death where they sat.
, Immediately following this rush'
of flames there came an explosion
which lifted the entire roof of the
theater from its walls, shattering
the great skylight into fragments.

More than one thousand persons in the orchestra seats,
with easy access to the doors, gradually made their way to
safety, but most of them threw aside wraps, pocketbooks, hats
and everything that seemed to impede them in the rush for life
and the open air.
But in the balcony and gallery the destruction wrought
frightful work. The flame and smoke, gathering on these up
per floors, caught the victims before they realized the full extent
of their danger. â¢
It seemed incredible that the little tongue of fire could lap
the walls so quickly and reach out after them like a stroke of
lightning. Then, when the full meaning of the disaster came
to the helpless ones, they fought and battled with one another
for safety â battled like stampeded animals, with the smoke curl
ing about them. Everything was plunged into absolute dark
ness, not even a friendly lantern showing them the wav' out
of this house of death. .
FIERCE BATTLE FOB LIFE .
Foy. chief comedian of the company, stood out from the
panic-stricken group on the stage to assure the audience that there
was no danger. Even as he spoke the great asbestos curtain was
let down, but it caught on one side and failed to work. " >Â¦
In another instant smoke burst from the top arch of the stage
and from under the bottom of the curtain. Before- the audience
realized the danger the whole roof of the auditorium was ablaze.
Two gas tanks exploded in the flies on the sides of the theater and
black, choking fumes beat down in a cloud of death from everv
wall.
This was not all. Fear, uncontrollable and terrible, reigned.
Men and women fought like wild beasts, filled only with a desire
for self -protection. Little babies slipped from their mothers' arms,
and in an instant their lives were crushed out by the crowd. Girls
threw themselves from the balconies and lay crushed and dying
till suffocation ended their miseries.
GAS TANKS EXPLODE.
From pit to dome the house was packed. Mothers and
their little ones had laughed themselves hoarse at the antics of
"Eddie"' Foy, a comedian. It was in the middle of the play
and the chorus, smiling and frolicsome, had just concluded the
singing of the "Moonlight Song."
"There is the moon now," cried a little chap in the front
row as a curl of smoke and a tiny tongue of flame shot out from
the wings to the right of the stage. Children clapped their
hands in glee. Mothers laughed and the whole audience was
in fine humor.
But the tongue of flame reached out and caught a bit of in
flammable scenery which hung over the center of the stage. In
stantly there was a larger ribbon of flame and in a moment
everything back of the footlights was a broad wave of fire, which
lighted the halt-illuminated house with weird effects.
TINY TONGUE OF FLAME.
CHICAGO, Dec. 30. â Chicago is stunned to-night by the
worst theater catastrophe in the history of the country. More
than six hundred men/ women and children, according to the
official report of the police, met death by fire, smc*;e and panic
during the matinee performance of "Mr. Bluebeard" at the
beautiful new Iroquois Theater. Most of the dead arc women
and children. Scores were incinerated, while hundreds were,
suffocated by smoke and gas and crushed to death by one an
other while struggling to escape. Still other hundreds are
"lyifi'g" "to-mglit Between life and death, wiih limbs broken and
burned, at their homes and in hospitals. Every undertaking es

probably never will be identified.

LONDON, Dec. 30.â Mrs. Allen of the
American-African Gospel Mission sailed
for New York to-day from Liverpool on
the White Star line steamer Celtic after
four years' work among the Nana
kroos, in Liberia. Just prior to sailing
from Liberia she witnessed severe tri
bal fighting between the allied inhabi
tants of the coast towns and the bush
men. 'Mrs. Allen's mission-house was
the center o* the first conflict and the
Nanakroos' Queen sought refuge there.
Mrs. Allen refused to leave, although
advised to do so by the Liberfan troops
sent from Monrovia to support the
coast towns.
During, the fighting Mrs. Allen was
not molested, but she witnerced re
markable scenes of barbarism. There
was not actual cannibalism, but the
bodies of the slain bushmen were chop
ped up into small pieces and the ears,
heads, arms and legs were cut off and
distributed among the various towns as
trophies of victory, -ti'**? \
The bushmen ultimately were worst
ed and returned to the interior.

tection of the Jews of Kishenev, had an
interview .with President Roosevelt to
d?y. At its conclusion Wolfe taid that
at the request of the President him
self he could not discuss the interview
for publication.

informed that prior to his presentation
of the matter to the State Department
the President had directed the United
States Consuls in Russia to Inform this
Government if there was any likelihood
of a repetition of the Kishenev massa-.
ere of last spring. The replies to that
inquiry thus far received have been
reassuring.

Post " Is Excited Over Report That
Troops Will Go to Panama.
When the rumor reeched the Ptesidio
yesterday that practically all the troops
now stationed on the coast we're to be
ordered to Panama there was naturally
great surprise manifested on all sides.
No direct orders had been received from
Washington, but still, owing to the sit
uafion of affairs, all were anticipating
a call. The wives of the different of
ficers in command were thrown into a
great state of excitement. They did not
object to Manila, but they had visions
of yellow fever and all kinds of ills that
are supposed to spring from Panama
climate.
Telephones were kept busy by anx
ious ones asking friends of the press
and officers at headquarters in the Phe
lan building if the rumors were true,
but no satisfaction could be gleaned,
as the direct and positive orders from
Uncle Sam's headquarters had not been
officially announced.
The Tenth Infantry, which is in can
tonment, is practically ready to start
for the scene of action at almost a mo
ment's notice. Colonel C. H. Noble, the
commanding officer, stated that no or
ders had reached him for a change of
base. He added, however: "My regi
ment is practically camping here, and
we are ready for any emergency. We
could leave this post at very short no
tice. If we should be ordered to Pan
ama we could proceed as soon as the
regiment could be equipped to go into
that tropical climate. In forty-eight
hours after the order reaches us we
could be teady to depart."

PARIS. Dec. 30.â Owing to the recent
events at Panama the annucl meeting
of the Panama company, which began
this aftt.rr.oon, developed unusual in
terest and excitement. Prior to the
opening efforts were made to secure
enough votes to overrule the existing
management of the company, which is
favorable to the sale of the company's
property to the United States. The
meeting: took place in the Hall of Agri
culture, which was crowded with offi
cials, stockholders and prominent
financiers. At the opening of the meet
ing the management submitted a re
port of the recent events on the isth
mus and the course token Dy the com
pany. The report set forth that the
republic of Panama to-day exercised
sovereignty over tht- isthmus, displac
ing Colombia's former sovereignty;
that the United States, Franc?. Russia*
Great Britain, * Germany and other
countries had recognized Panama's
supremacy and added:
"In view of the accepted fact and in
face of superior force we can only
maintain and continue the existing en
gagements with the United States."
The report of the president disclosed
Colombia's recent vain efforts to induce
the company to continue dealing with
the old Government of the isthmus.
During Secretary Lampre's reading of
the report the disaffected ekment
hooted and cat-called, causing much
disorder. The speech of M. Groton, a
representative of the old company, also
was hooted.
Finally two resolutions were adopted,
the first approving the accqunta and
the report of the management and the
=econd re-elect'ng: the ole officers. The
vote on the first resolution was 9233 in
favor of it to 119 against it, showing
the insignificance of the opposition to

sia-will reconsider her first answer to
Japan's request.
At the Russian embassy and at the

that the situation In the Far East has

"There is no war to-day; to-morrow

The paper rather fatalistically directs
attention to the fact that wars marked
the opening of the seventeenth, eight
eenth and nineteenth centuries. The
Novoe Vremya, nevertheless, still pos
sesses faith in a peaceful settlement,
saying:
"We believe Japan will not place Rus
sia in a position where to yield would
appear to ba a renunciation. of the de
fense of her vital interests in the Far.
East. Russia does not desire war, but

PARIS, Dec. 30.â The Chinese Gov

shall have been ratified the opening of
Moukden and Antung to the commerce
of the world can be pressed.
It Is learned In diplomatic circles that
the Japanese Government has informed
the foreign diplomats that the situation
with respect to Russia is desperate, but
not â¢ hopeless. It is believed this infor
mation was communicated to the
French Government for presentation at
St. Petersburg.
While still not believing that war be
tween Russia and Japan will occur, ttfe
optimistic tone In offlclaK and diplo
matic circles here was somewhat modi
fied to-day by advices from Tokio and
St. Petersburg. Japan, it appears. Is
hastening preparations for the purpose,
it is suggested, of influencing Russia's
action upon the Japanese note. Russia,
on the other hand, has no intention to
hurry. Her reply Is not expected to be
made before January 10. Russia's pur
pose seems to be to put the onus of de
claring war upon Japan, if such be the
result of the negotiations.

LONDON. Dec. 30.â Japan this even-
Ing completed the purchase of the Ar
gentine warships Moreno and Rivada
via, building at Genoa, Italy, for which
Russia was also negotiating.
News has been received here confirm
ing previous reports that Japan Is
mobilizing troops, probably with the
object of occupying Korea. The con
firmation has reached the German Gov
ernment officially, and it is interpreted
here, as in Paris, to mean not that Ja
pan intends to send an, ultimatum to
Russia, but that Japan may occupy
Korea without Russia considering it a
casus belli. The .situation is regarded
here to-night as developing rapidly, yet
not necessarily toward war.
In response to an inquiry as to
whether it was true, as asserted by the
Lokal Anzeiger of Berlin, that Japan
had notified the powers that the Russo-
Japanese situation was desperate and
that an immediate reply would be re
quired from Russia, failing which'Ja
pan would strike, the following state
ment was made by the Japanese lega
tion to-night:
"Japan hars confided to the powers
confidentially the circumstances under
which the negotiations have been car
ried on hitherto, justifying her action,
but not at all in the sense that your

always taking it as nri impossibility
that the situation in the Far East is
even grave. Others of the diplomatic
corps seem to be without news and
express general ideas, the easy and
safe one being that "hostilities are
quite unlikely." and that each side is
testing its adversary to the breaking
point. Everywhere there is anxiety for
authoritative news that shall bring the
period of suspense to an end.
The mobilization of the Japanese
navy is at least partially attributed,
according to a Vladivostok dispatch to
the Colc-gne Gazette, to open acts of
hostility oa the part of the Koreans
toward Japanese, probably necessitat
ing active measures of defense of Jap
anese interests in Southern Korea.
The Cologne Gazette considers that
this dispatch is an admission that Ja
pan has a good claim to defend her
interests in Southern Korea by force
of arms arid -controverts the rumors to
the effect that Russia would regard the
landing of a considerable Japanese
force in Southern Korea as a casus
belli. The paper concludes:
"The attitude of Russia on this ques
tion may therefore be regarded as a
further concession on her part."
had not been crowned with success.
But the Japanese Minister laid much
stress on the dispatch from Paris Â§ an
nouncing that the French Government
did not believe that war between Rus
sia ar.d Japan would break out, and
said:
"The French Government must be
in a better position than that of any
other power to know the nature of the
Russian reply. If they are honest in
saying they do not believe there was
danger of war they must have been
pretty certain ' Russia will agree at
least to the spirit of Japan's proposals.
Up to now we have had no indication
of this, and unless Russia does agree
there seems no way of averting war.
I onlj- trust that M. Delcasse will be
successful."
Minister Hayashi definitely stated
that the Russian evacuaiion of Man
churia was not one Â°of the Japanese
cardinal demands.
FRANCE TO REMAIN NEUTRAL.
Baron Hayashi has declared that.
in the event of war, he had the best
authority for saying that France would
not join forces with Russia, even
should China co-operate with Japan,
and that the Triple Alliance would
preserve strict neutrality. For the
former statement Baron Hayashi's au
thority is not known, and his belief in
France's neutrality in case of .China
Joining in the conflict creates some
doubt and astonishment, In diplomatic
circles here there Is no indication when
the Russian reply may be expected.
At the Foreign Office and at the Jap
anese. American and other legations,
the Novoe .Vremya's editorial of to
day is regarded as warlike, but the
suggestin was made at one embassy
that the remarks might really be in
tended fo- home consumption, in order
to make a compromise more palatable

LONDON, Dec. CO.â Lord Lansdowne's
diplomatic reception to-day centered
on .the Far Eastern crisis. The Rus
sian Embassador, Count Benckendorff.
was unable to give the reception any
information. regarding the tenor of the
Russian reply to Japan, as he had re
ceived no advices on the subject from
St. Petersburg. The Foreign Secretary
adopted a slightly more hopeful torre
to- the other Embassadors than has
pre\-ai!ed at the Foreign Office for the
last few days. This is chiefly due to
th" persistent belief of the French yor
rirn. Minister. M. Ex?lca5=se. that he
will be able to prevail upon Russia to
make such compromises as will avert
war.
EmbasFador Choate, after a confer
ence with Lord Lansdowne, expressed
his continued conviction that a solu
tion would be found, and said the in
dications were not warlike. This belief
was not shared in by some of Lord
Lansdowne's other callers, notably the
German Embapsador.

Last evening at a. meeting of a num
ber of intelligent representative Rus'
sians of the kind that can be taken as
echoing popular sentiment, the spirit
shown coincided with impressions
gathered here in governmental " cir
cles, which is that there is rapidly
growing impatience and ever increasing
conviction of necessity for Russia to
assert herself, the tone of opinion be
ing summed un"*-as follows:
"Russia musj be the dominating pow
er Jn the Far,.East. She long ago be
came tired of of inferior
Eastern powers contesting for the same
position, and is convinced that it is
high time that Russia should strike
with mailed fist and show once for all
that she will not be trifled with, and
the pretension of Japan that the yellow
races are to rule the Far East is one
which Russians canno. admit.!'
Apropos of this a Vladivostok tele
gram to the Novoe Vremya says. that
much attention has been drawn there
to the avowed intentions of the Japan
ese to place themselves in front as a
power of the Far East with the theory
of "Asia for Asians" and to conclude
an alliance for that purpose with the
Asiatic powers.
RUSSIANS ARE ASSERTIVE.
"The late peaceful news is destroyed
by to-day's Tokio news. Japan is tak
ing extreme measures. Russia does not
seek war, but not one Russian would
for "one . moment desire that Russia,
with her peaceful intentions, should bi
made to- dance 'to the piping of Japan
and. her friends. With full knowledge
of her. strength, t Russla/. Is: awaiting
events."" jj ','
The official Novy Krai says:
"A Mongolian war cloud darkens the
horizen. Chinese news shows that the
yellow peril is being strengthened by
Europe at the expense of Russia."
The Dirschewya Viedomosti begins
an editorial with the strong declaration
that it would be folly for Russia, after
expending such stupendous sums on
railroads, to be asked by a small power
like Japan to get out, and proceeds to
say: V-/- ' -
"No man of intelligence in Russia
would !!ke to see his country at war.
But the present crisis is one of such
supreme importance to Russia that any
giving way on part of this â¢ country
would be unworthy of the nation's
aims and traditions."
Japanese will effect a landing in Korea.
Well, what of it, and what after?" This
Indicates that Russia proposes no pre
cipitate action, shc-uld Japan try to
force the situation. The Novoe Vremya,
upon the latest news, takes up the key
note universally heard thus:

CHICAGO, Dec. 31.â Will J. Davis and
Harry- J. Powers, proprietors of the
Iroquois Theater, made the following
statement at 1:20 o'clock this (Thurs
day) morning:
"So far as we have been able to as
certain the cause or causes of the most
unfortunate accident of the fire in the
Iroquois, it appears that one of ths

ignited from some cause. It was de

is detailed* and constantly on duty
when the theater la opened noticed it
simultaneously with the electrician.
The fireman, who was only a few feet
away. Immediately pulled a tube of

RESULTS OF DISASTER

CHICAGO, Dec. 30.â Coroner Treager
made as complete an inspection of the
theater as possible. He said:
"If the . asbestos curtain had been
working I believe the fire might have
been prevented from spreading into the
audience chamber. An Iron railing
which separated each row of seats from
the adjoining tier prevented, I think,
many from reaching places of safety.
This circumstance, combined with the
steep incline, made it difficult for so
large an audience to escape without
great ' delay. This is a modern fire
proof theater, furnished with all the
appliances and equipment that are sup
posed to prevent just such a catas
trophe as now has occurred. The plush
on the seats of ; the first balcony was
charred, but still visible.
' "This does not look to me as though
everybody would have got out of the
theater alive when you Uake into ac
; count the speed with which the flames
had spread. My Inspection showed
that the seats on the, main floor were
burned but little. The balconies had
evidently shielded to a large extent the
seats in the parquet. The path of the
flames was evident. The stage and
ceiling of the theater were blistered
and blackened* .There was practically
no damage to furniture on the first
floor. The ' booth boxes on the sec
ond tier were' destroyed by fire, while
gled and charred humanity. We car

at last they grew so numerous.that we

Such a dreadful sight I trust I will

W. A. Merriman. Western manager

made the following statement con
cerning the construction of the build-
Ing: .
"The building was built. with 'safety
as the rnnln consideration. All build

every detail, and. more than that,
there were 'additional safeguards
thrown about until I do not hesitate
to state that there was no theater
building in the country which was
freer from danger. The j exits were
numerous and all the work which
our company performed was abso

very, careful examination of the build

equipment of the theater. It started,
they claim, from the bursting of a
calcium light apparatus. Thi concus
sion was so great that it blew out the
skylight over the stage and auditorium.
This statement of the theater man
agement is contradicted by many per
sons who were in the theater and who
declared that when the explosion oc
curred they saw flames in a narrow
streak crossing the wall near the upper
part of the drop curtain.
W. A. C. Sellers, the house fireman,
who was severely burned in trying to
lower the asbestos curtain, describes
the scene upon the stage and the cause
as follows:
"I was standing in the wings when
I heard the explosion and there Im
mediately went forward a cry of 'Fire!'
from the stage and all parts of the
theater. Looking up, I saw that the
curtain was ablaze, so I rang for the
fire curtain. We got it half way<4lown,
when the wind, rushing in from the
broken skylights, bellied it out so that
it caught and we could not budge it.
'With the stage hands I climbed to
where it was suspended and together
we tried to push it. down. Our efforts
were futile, and seeing that no human
power could move that fire curtain, and
that the stage was a mass of flames.
I turned my attention toward warning
the actors and trying to save those who
were in trouble.
"The women were frantic and the
men not much better. I stocd at "the
stairway leading to the dressing-rooms
where the chorus people were located
and kept some from going up to get
their street clothes. As the others came
down I forced them to leave the build
ins. I do not kntrw how they ever got
out all those girls and men who came
crowding down the stairs, for the stage
entrance was blocked by a mass of
flames."

rushed to the rescue when the call of

curtain did not descend entirely
was what saved the lives of the
company, although it caused such
a horrible catastrophe in the front
of the house.
"After the curtain had refused
to descend there came the explo

would have been confined be

and the .fireproof curtain in front.
Under these circumstances it

When the panic was at its

ran for the fire escapes, only to

ty feet from the ground, a fire be

platform first endeavored to hold
theifc footing and to keep back the
crowd that pressed upon them
from the rear. *,* y^j

that -many of them W^JSS crowded

George H. Elliott, secretary of
the Ogden Gas Company, was in
a building directly across the al

smoke, went down to ascertain its

street the women were already
dropping into ttfe alley, and Elli

sistance they were able to devise
was to hurriedly lash some planks
together and throw them across
to the women on the
platforms, with instructions to
place the end firmly on the iron

a fearful loss of time ensued, wo
men were being hurled every in

CHICAGO. Dec. 30.â Rarely in the
history of Chicago has its peqple been
so stirred as by the calamity of to-day.
Next to the Chicago fire, it is the
greatest castrophe that has ever oc
curred here, and the speed with which
it came and went seemed for a brief
period to appall the business section of
the city. The news spread with great
rapidity and in a short time hundreds
of men, women and children were rush
ing toward the theater.
The building in which the calamity
occurred stands midway between State
and Dearborn streets, on the north side
of Randolph street. Although every
available policeman within call of the
department was Immediately hurried
to the spot and men placed in lines
from the ends of the block, allowing
nobody to enter Randolph street from
either Dearborn or State, it was found
for a time almost impossible to hold
back the frenzied crowd that pressed
forward, many of them having friends
or relatives in the theater and being
anxious to learn something of them-
POLICE WIN PKAISE.
The conduct of the police was beyond
all praise. The officers held their
ground firmly and gently pushed back
all who sought to gain an entrance to
the theater, although in some instances
frantic men, anxious to look for their
loved ones, actually beat the officers
with their fists in their rage a* being
prevented.
In spite of the efforts of the police,
however, a large number of persona
succeeded in breaking through the
lines and entering the theater, and, in
many cases, did heroic work In rescu
ing the injured and carrying out the
dead. Among these was Alderman W.
H. Thompson, who, unaided, carried to
the street the bodies of eight women.
The first newspaper men upon the
ground also carried out many of the
dead and injured.
The building was so full of smoke
when the firemen first arrived that the
full extent of the catastrophe was not
immediately grasped, until a fireman
and a newspaper man crawled up the
stairway leading to the balcony, hold-
Ing handkerchiefs over their mouths t>>
avoid suffocation. As they reached the
door the fireman, whose vision waa bet
ter trained in such emergencies, seized
his companion by the arm, exclaiming:

vealing some portion of the
agony which must have preceded
their deaths. There weie scores
and scores of persons whose en-,
tire faces had been trampled com
pletely off by the heels of those
who rushed over them, and in
one aisle the body of a nian was
found with not a vestige of cloth
ing, flesh or bone remaining
above his waistline. The entire
upper portion of his body had
been cut into mince meat and
carried away by the feet of those
who trampled on him. A seafclf

of finding his head/ but at. a late
hour to-night it had not been dis

friends who he -was is. the coloc

on the lower limbs, and this is in
such a" condition as to. be hardly

In the aisles nearest to the
doors the scenes, were harrowing
in the extreme. Bodies lay in
In the first and second balconies
bodies were piled up in the aisles
three and four deep, where one
had fallen and others tripped over
the prostrate forms. All had died
where they lay, evidently suffo
cated by gas. Others were bent
over the backs of seats, where they
had been thrown by the rush for
the door, and killed with hardly
a chance to rise from their seats'.
â¢â¢One man was found with his
back bent nearly double, bis spinal
column 'having been fractured as
â¢he. was thrown backward. A
woman was found cut nearly in
half by the back of the seat,, she
having been forced over, it face
down.
As the police removed layer
after layer of dead in those door
ways the sight became too much
even for police and firemen, hard
ened as they; are to such sights,
to endure. The bodies were in
such an inextricable mass and so
tightly were they jammed be
tween the sides of the door and
the walls that it was impossible
to lift them one by one and carry
them out. The only possible
thins: to do was to seize a limb or
some other portion of the body
and pull by main strength.
Men worked at the task with
tears running down their cheeks;
and the sobs of the rescuers could
be heard even in the hall below
where this awful scene was being
enacted. A number of the men
were compelled to abandon their
tasks and* give it over to others
whose nerves had not as yet been
shaken by the awful experience.
' As one by one the bodies were
dragged out of the water-soaked,
blackened mass of corpses the
spectacle became more and more
heartrending.
There were women whose cloth

bodies above the waist, whose

this point were those of women

which must have taken place at
these two points is something
that it is simply beyond human
power to describe. Only a faint
idea of its horror could be de

bodies as they lay.
Women on top of these masses

death as they were crawling on

bodies of those who had died be

W. J. Davis, manager of the
theater, said after the catastrophe
that if the audience had remained
seated and had not been ex
cited by the cry of "fire!" not a
single life would have been lost.
This, however, is contradicted by
the Statements of the firemen, who
found numbers of persons sitting
in their seats, their faces directed
toward the stage, as if the per
formance were still going on. It
is the opinion of the firemen that
these persons had been suffocated
at once by the flow of gas which
came from behind the asbestos
curtain.
As near as can be estimated
at the present time about thirteen
hundred persons were in the the
ater. Three hundred of these
were on the first floor, the remain
der being in the balconies and in
the hallways back of them. The
theater was modeled after the
Opera Comique in Paris and
from the rear of each balcony
there were three doors leading out
to passageways toward the front
of the theater. Two of these
doorways were at the end of the
balcony and one in the center.
The audience, in its rush for the
outer air, seems to have chosen,
for the greater part, to ike to the
left entrance and to attempt to
make its way down the eastern
stairway leading into thÂ» lobby
of the theater. Except for those
burned or suffocated by gas it
was in these two doorways on the
first and second balconies that the
greatest loss of life occurred.
DEAD MASSED IN DOORWAY
When the firemen entered the
building the dead were found
stretched in a pile reaching from
the head of the stairway at least
eight feet from the door back to
a point about five feet in the rear

_ REDDING. Dee. 30.â Harvey Leigh
ton, who lives three miles west of Red
ding, believes he located a lot of buried I
treasure in this city and that it was [
dug up bv other persons after he had I
found it. He now unsuccessfully seeks j
their arrest. Recently several men 1
came here from Willits. Mendocino
County, to dig for between $70,000 and
$100,000 located by a divining rod on the
premises of a local stable, but they
failed to find the treasure. Since then
i many people. with. magic wands of dif
ferent varieties have used the rods
about the stable grounds. Leighton
claimed yesterday that he had located
; the buried wealth about twelve feet |
from where the men from Willits had i
sunk a shaft in search of it. Before dis- I
closing his secret he got the promise of \
the stablemen that he would be allowed
to dig for the wealth and would receive
half of whatever was dug out.
Leighton went out home las\ evening,
and when he returned to Redding this
morning to dig up the coin he found a
hole six feet deep at the spot he
located. The stablemen acknowledge
digging the hole, but say. they found
nothing. Leighton believes they got
something, as he considers hla atick In
fallible.

Captain Newton H. Chlttenden, the
explorer and lecturer, has proved the
theory that he has held for some time
that this neighborhood was formerly
the home c-f giants by finding the bones
of one of the species. Captain Chitten
den refuses to reveal the burial ground
of this prehistoric man. but admits't^hat
it is somewhere In one of the old Indian
mounds of West Berkeley.
The bones found by Captain Chitten
den make almost a-complete skeleton,
the missine parts being a number of
the vertebrae. The thigh bones are
large and, measured by present day
standards, indicate that the owner of
them must have been a man at least
eight feet high. Half the skull Is gone,
but the half that remains shows that
the head must have contained about
twice as many brains as that of the
modern man. This skull is like one
found several years ago in West Berke
ley when excavations were being made
for the foundation of a building.
"I have no doubt," said Captain Chit
tenden, "that ages ago giants roamed
around this country. This man was
no monstrosity, such as we occasion
ally have nowadays, but a perfectly
formed "man and possessed of greatin
tellectual powers. I intend to continue
my investigations in the hope of find
ing more cf the bones of our ancestors."
Captain Chittenden will present the
skeleton to the Berkeley High School.

PROMINENT, YOUNG MAX
MEETS SUDDEN DEATH
Captain Xewlo^ H. Chitten
den Makes Discovery of Skel
eton of a Prehistoric Man
The trouble between Fagan and Carl
son began a week ago. when Fagan de
cided to discharge Carlson, who is a
union man, and do his own work. There
is a rule of the electricians' union that
prevents an employer from working
himself or joining the union, and so
Fagan in order to work himself had to
discharge his union man.
Since his discharge Carlson has been
following Fagan from house to house
and attempting to persuade contractors
not to give him work. He also made
threats against Fagan in the presence
of his friends, saying he would kill Fa
gan and then swallow a dose of poison,
which he exhibited.
This morning Carlson accosted Fagan
in his office and demanded that he say
nothing more "against the Swedes."
Then he pulled a pistol and pointed it
at Fagan's head, threatening at the
same time to shoot. Phelps. who was a
spectator of this sensational episode,
bravely jumped in between the inen
just as Carlson was about to fire. He
seemed to have some influence over the
man and finally persuaded him to go.
After getting him out on the street
Phelps turned him over to an officer.
"Carlson has no grievan.ee against
me," said Fagan afterward. "I owe him
nothing and he demanded nothing. All
he asked me to do was to quit talking
about the Swedes. It was pure cussed
ness on his part. He thought I could
not get along without him, and when
he saw I did he tried to even up mat
ters by attempting my life. Anyway,
the pistol looked as big as a cannon,
and I thought my time had come,"
To the arresting officer Carlson ad
mitted dogging Fagan's footsteps and
attempting to shoot him, but said It
was only done to frighten him. Carl
son is a Swede and has only been in
America two years.
BERKELEY, Dec. 30.â That he is not
now lying a corpse at the Morgue is a
source of considerable satisfaction to
F. D. Fagan, an employing electrician,
with an office at 2139 Center Street. And
it is not altogether the fault of John
Carlson^ his former employe, that Fa
gan is not a subject for a Coroner's
inquest, because he fully intended to
kill him with a big six-shooter he
shoved into his face this morning. All
that saved Fagan was the adroit inter
ference and pacifying wqrds of Ralph
Phelps. an electrical engineer, who
jumped between the men at the critical
moment. Carlson is now a prisoner at
the County Jail, charged with assault
with intent to commit murder. His bail
is fixed at $2500 cash.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. CO.-M. H.
Flint, who has been selected as post
rriaster of IÂ»a Angeles to succeeJ
Lewis Groff, whose term expires next
month, is not a San Francisco postof
fice official, as is announced In a Wash
ington dispatch, but is v.ell known
throughout Southern California as a
Republican politician. For many year9
Flint has been in the postal service,
first as a carrier, then as superintend
ent of carriers, next as a postoffice in
spector and lastly as superintendent of
the allowance and inspection bureau of
the Postofflce Department for the dis
trict embracing Idaho. Washington.
Oregon, California, Nevada and Ari
zona. He is a brother of Frank P.
Flint, until a year ago United States
District Attorney, and now. the. legal
representative in Los Angeles of the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
The ne^- postmaster took an active
interest in Congressman McLachlan's
candidacy, and It was largely through
his efforts that Los Angeles County |
was made a separate Congressional dis
trjet. when an effort was made to tack
on Ventura and other counties to this
district. Flint has spent many years
in the postofflce service and is equipped
for the duties of postmaster. In the
selection of a successor to Postmaster
Groff Senator Bard, who secured
Groff' s appointment four years, ago,
did not take a hand, but left it to Con-:
gresman McLachlan. .There Â» was no
opposition to the appointment:. in fact r
there was no other applicant, .it" hav- "
ing been a foregone, conclusion, who was .
to succeed Groff.
Flint will surrender an office which
pays him. $2500 and traveling expenses
for one which pays $4000, and with the
enormous increase in business here
will pay $5000 a year before his term of
office expires.

Miss Miller offered a defense. She
said she was engaged as a housekeeper
for a landlady, on O'Farrell street. Per
sonally she looked like a half-breed
Chinese, but in replies to the ques
tions of Judge Fritz she said she was
born in Ireland. Bailiff Conlan was
called as an expert. He. has probed the
heart of--Chlnatown until it bled In
great big blotches. After he had eyed
the woman he concluded ' she was a
Caucasian. . !
/The complaint missed the statutory
provisions in vagrancy cases by. one
day and Judge Fritz was compelled to
dismiss her.
Effie Miller was an interesting char
acter in Judge Fritz's court yesterday.
She was found by Policeman George
Douglass inhabiting a room at 1025%
Dupont street. Effie wore a kimona
and slippers made of straw. The place,
which has a historic past, is now ten
anted exclusively by Chinese. Miss
Miller was handsomely gowned in black
silk when she appeared in court and a
picture hat crowned her head. She told
Judge Fritz that her purpose in visits
ing the house was to secure the medi
cal attendance of a Chinese doctor. The
policeman thought her intentions were
otherwise. .*'-. ~' : -.

CONVENTION AT FRESNO-
There is a grievance existing be
tween the and their em
ployers, which will be ventilated at
the next meeting of the Stablemen's
Union. The Livery and Carriage Own
ers' Association has taken the lni'tia
; tive in bringing about certain rules
! which the Hackmen's Union does not
quite take to- .
One of these rules which conflicts
with the union agreement is that one
man should remain from T to 8 o'clock
to help, the night watch unhitch
teams which come in during/ that
time. The association also insists that
I the help should aid in the loadin'gof
manure wagons and the unloading' of
grain. .These are the main. points in
dispute, as pointed out by the asso
ciation. There is no question as to
wages. ' ! . _ ._ " .
It is hinted that unless the, stable
men conform to these conditions there
will be a general lockout of all union
men in the near future. One more
condition is asked for by the associa
tion and this is that it be permitted
to employ such men as it sees fit, with
the privilege of such men joining the
union if so inclined. This last clause
is' vigorously objected to by the union
stablemen. . . .
men's Union and the Longshoremen's
Union, which has been in progress for
several months, has been taken up by ;
the Alamcda County Building Trades
Council, and that body has taken ac
â¢ tion to compel the six men employed by
the Pugret Sound Lumber Company,
Â¦who are members of the Longshore
men's Union but are doing" tallymen's
work, to Join the Tallymen's Union,
and to this end the Puget Sound Lum
ber Company has been declared "un
fair" by the Building Trades Council
in the following notice sent to all con
tractors in this county:

Secretary B. T. C.. of Alameda County.
By this action the Building Trades
Council will tie up the use < lumber
from the Puget Sound yards until the
rr.cn who are now doing the tallymen's
work there become members of the
Tallymen's Union. The council does
not cla'm that these men are not union j
men. but that they are not members of
the Tallymen's Union. J. B. Bowen, the
V>usine5s agent of the Building Trades
Council, said to-night>
'â¢The Council does not want the Puget
Sound Lumber Company to discharge
i hope tallymen, but simply to require
them to join the Tallymen's Union.
This the company has refused to do, so
the council has sent out nonces to the
contractors stating that it will not
sanction the use of lumber from the
Pug-el Sound Company's yards until all
the tallymen employed there are mem
bers of the Tallymen's Union."
If it comes to a fight the council is

there has been a dispute between these
â¢two unions, but I thought it had been
/'settled some time ago. I htve not been

f cil had declared the Pugret Sound Lum- !
ber Company unfair, and the first that \
I knew of the affair was when I saw a
circular, which had been sent to a con
tractor, notifying him that after the
first of January union men would not
be allowed to handle our lumber. I
think there has been a blunder some- !
xvhere and I believe the matter will be'
amicably arranged, as every man in our
employ is a union man, and there is' no
occasion for the action taken by the
E\jildins Trades Council. Of course I
can make no definite statement until I
have seen the representatives of the
council."

"His Holiness has referred to the

CHICAGO. Dec. SO.â The Iroqunis
w.s opened November 23, 1SG3. by Klaw
& Erlar.ger's company presenting the
spectacular extravaganza, "Mr. Blue
beard."
It was regarded as cne of the most
beautiful theaters in the country. In
fact, good critics claimed there was but
< ne house superior to it in matter of
beauty and comfort. The foyer was
large, enough of itself to inclose the
Bijou Theater. The seating capacity
was about 1950. and the theater itself
was a model. Every seat in the house
v.-as a pood one. There were no pillars
to obstruct the view and there were
no boxes that jut and shut off seats
in the circle on the side. The Iroquois
was bread, not long. There was never
a pense of aloofness, fon one felt near
the stage even if in the last row of the
balcony.
The seating: arrangement was admir
able, as the aisles were not narrow and
the space between the rows was ample.
Red and green were the prevailing col
ors; in the foyer Pompeiian red made
the scone bri'liant, and the red of the
auditorium was* grateful. Cream relief
made the jrlaro impossible and the ceil
lr.gr was artistic. The white panels on
the walls were beautifully dcrae. The
cost of the theater was $550,500.
â¢ The proprietors were Messrs. F. J.
Davis and H. J. Powers of this city,
Klaw & Erlanger of New Tork and
Nixon & Zinirermann of Philadelphia.

LIFE LOSS
BY FIRES
IS GREAT
One large truck ordinarily used for
conveying freight to depots was so
heavily loaded with dead in front of
the theater that the two large horses
attached to it were unable to start and
the police were compelled to assist by
tugging at the wheels.
When the need for trucks to remove
the dead was more pressing, a huge
electric delivery wagon, owned by
Montgomery, "Ward & Co., was hailed
by the police. The automobile headed
for the scene, but at State street en
countered so great a press of people
The merchants in the vicinity of the
theater arose to the emergency in
splendid fashion. Marshall Field &
Co., Mar.del Bros.. Schlesinger &
Mayer: Carson. Pirie, Scott & Co. and
other large dry-goods stores sent wag
onload after wagonload of blankets,
rolls of linen and packages of cotton
to be used in binding up wounds of the
injured and to cover the dead.
The drugstores gave of their stock
to anybody that asked for it in the
name of persons hurt in the fire.
Doctors and trained nurses were on
the ground by scores within a half hour
after the calamity was known, and
every injured person who was car
ried from the building received prompt
medical aid. A number of doctors
waited at the entrance to the theater
with stethoscopes in hand and as soon
as a body which looked as though it
might possess life was carried out it
was at once examined. If dead, it was
placed on the pile lying on the side
walk. The living were at once placed
in ambulances and whirled away to
hospitals or to the offices of physicians
in the immediate neighborhood.
FREIGHT TRUCKS IN USE.
It was found necessary in order to
convey the bodies rapidly to the
Morgue and to the various undertak
ing establishments to press .trucks into
service, and in these, upon costly
blankets supplied by the dry-goods
stores in the vicinity and covered by
thÂ° sfme material, the dead -were
hauled away practically like so much
cord wood.
GIVE WITH FREE HAND.
So rapidly were the bodies brought
down that in an hour there were twa
streams of men in and out of the'door â
the one carrying bodies, the other com
posed of mt?a returning to get more.
The bedies were carried into the
Thompson restaurant, which adjoins
the theater on the east, where all the
available space was given by the pro
prietor. The dead and injured were
placed on chairs, tables and counters,
one woman even being placed, for lack
of a better spot, on top of a cigar case.
Because of the tremendous throng
which surrounded the block in .which
the theater building stood it was not
possible for the police to carry the dead
and injured any distance, and they
were? compelled to await for ambu
lances at the theater. Although \\\
the patrol wagons and every ambulance
owned by the city was pressed into ser
vice, they were utterly inadequate to
carry awav the dead, and in a short
time there was a line of corpses fifty
feet long, piled two and three high, on
the sidewalk in front of the theater.
LONG ROWS OF BODIES.
The two men tried vainly to get
through th<? door, which was jammed
with dead women, piled higher than
the h<?ads of either man.
All the lights in the theater were ex
tinguished and the only illumination
rame through the cloud of smoke that
hung between the interior of the thea
ter and the street.
The two men immediately hurried to
a floor below and informed Chief Mush
am of the fire department that bodies
were pJled high in the balcony and
prompt assistance must be rendered if
any e* them were to be saved. The
chief called upon all of his men in the
vicinity to abandon work on the fire
and come at once to the rescue.
The building: was so dark and the
smoke so thick that it was found Im
possible to accomplish anything until
lights had been procured. Word was
at once sent to the Orr & Lockett
Hardware Company, two doors east of
the theater, and that firm quickly
placed its entire stock of lanterns at
the service of the department. More
than 200 lights were carried into the*
building and the work of rescue com
menced. -

faces!"

MANY BESIEGE MORGUE.
All night long stricken relatives and
friends of missing persons besieged the
,morgues where the dead had been car
ried awaiting identification. Hundreds
of men and women waited in long Iine3
for hours to finally demand admit
tance. For every person who was al
lowed to enter the death r.ooms a score
were ordered away.
After waiting for several hours in
front of Jordan & Co.'s undertaking
establishment in Madison street, the
crowd of mourners, consisting of
more than 1000 persons, became im
patient and it took the united efforts
of twenty policemen who were guard
ing the place to quiet the dissatisfac
tion. The aisles between the piles of
dead were already filled with persons
and it was impossible for those out
side to enter until those already in
side left to make room.
RELATIVES ARE FRANTIC.

in there, and they are missing. .Are

and driven home. Later it was ascer
tained that Sanborn's son, Harold. 19
years old, had taken the entire party
in safety from the theater.
"Will J. Davis, one of the proprietors
of the Iroquois, collapsed to-night un
der the worry and distress occasioned
by the catastrophe. After the fire he
and Powers made their headquarters
in the women's dressing rooms, where
they were besieged by people who
were frantically seeking information
of their relatives. The climax came
with Davis when â¢ ho was approached
by George C. Sanborn, a prominent
busines man, who said:
DAVIS BREAKS DOWN.
Frederick W. Job, secretary of the
Chicago Employes' Association, tele
phoned to D. Moon, a livery stable pro
prietor at 2021 Wabash avenue, ask
ing that carriages be sent for the relief
of the sufferers. Moon replied he would
give his carriages for the work. He
later told Job that he notified the union
headquarters, where the drivers now on
strike are congregated, that he had. do
nated the carriages and asked if they
would drive to the Iroquois Theater to
help remove the wounded. Moon re
plied to Job that they flatly refused to
do so. <* ,
Two of the downtown theaters closed
their doors to patrons as a result of the
fire. These were the Illinois and Pow
ers Theaters, which were owned by the
proprietors of the Iroquois. All other
theaters remained opened as usual and
there was no perceptible falling off in
the attendance.
The body of a dark haired girl, about
12 years of age. was found impaled on
the iron railing ,of the first balcony,
she evidently having been thrown over
from the second balcony above.
\Vith all of its clothing torn from it
but a pair of baby shoes, the body of
a child about a year old was found
tn a far corner of the second balcony.
It had evidently been knocked from
its mother's arms and was trampled
beyond recognition.
While scores of men were busy in
carrj-lng out the dead and Injured,
others, fortunately few in number,
searched the aisles and seats for valu
ables. Two women were found who
had provided themselves with baskets
and were filling them with ths prop
erty of the dead. They were placed
under arrest, and the theater ushers
a,nd stage hands given the work of col
lecting the valuables on the floor of
the theater. During the evening the
police arrested over a dozen men ac
cifted of being thieves and pickpockets.
STRIKERS ARE STUBBORN.
About a score of people in the second
balcony were saved by firemen, who
took them through the roof and car
ried them down ladders in the rear of
the building. 1
Two bodies tightly locked in each
other's arms, young women apparently
about 25 years of age, were found in
one end of the orchestra pit. They must
have fallen there from the balcony
above.

Dozens ot others, swept, carried, dragged or thrown out to

sight of the throngs outside with fire wagons and smoking
horses, but died in great masses seven and eight feet high, with
their faces in the last agonies, all turned toward the doors they
could not reach.
From the windows at the north and west ends of the building
they streamed, blinded by smoke and crazed beyond any possibil
ity of helping themselves further or of taking advantage of the
aid extended to them from the upper floors of the buildings fac

The women and girls in the gallery never had a chance for

the seats they had grasped when the panic came. Others who
had managed by the strength of terror to get. into the aisles
found the end in the mingled mass of smoke and fire and the
tearing of limbs there and in the open space back of the seats.

SURPRISES HER FRIENDS
Never was there a busier night in
Chicago than this one. All night long
hundreds of people were going be
tween the police station and the hos
pitals and the Morgue, first- to one,
then to the other, then back again,
seeking news" of missing friends, and
relatives and trying to identify the
dead. At the Central Police station,
within one and a half squares of the
theater, a dozen policemen were kept
busy all night taking names and de
scriptions of missing people.
In the squad room of the station the
lists of injured received from hospitals
and from police stations were read to
the crowd. The throngs were silent
while the names, were read except for
an occasional outbreak of sobbing as
some one recognized in the description
a relative or friend. The hospitals
were besieged i by . callers and â¢ eager'
questioners over, the telephone. In spite
of all this the work of identification
went on but slowly, and at 2 o'clock
this morning apparently only one
fifth of the bodies lying in the rooms
of downtown undertakers had been
recognized by their friends.
and mothers who were anxious about
relatives and friends refused to be
pacified.
At Rolston's morgue, 22 Adams street,
where nearly 200 bodies lay awaiting
identification, the scenes were equally
as dramatic. There, were thousands of
people -in the crowd in front of the
place, and it was with, the greatest dif
ficulty that the police, were able to con
trol the situation, so anxious were the
grief-stricken people to gain admit
tance <to ascertain if their loved ones
had fallen victims to the awful disas
ter. A dozen other places in the city
where dead had been carried witnessed
the same scenes.

doors and shattering the glass panels
in their attempts- to afford a larger
space for the exit of the people. Many
fell as they reached the doors, where
a few steps more would have carried
them to fresh air and safety. As I look
at it now I must have been walking on
prostrate bodies as I struggled through
the opening. All of our party escaped
in about the same manner as I did, but
all of them suffered so terribly in the
matter of clothing that the first thing
they did was to rush to the stores to
buy wraps to cover them."
TROY, N. Y..'De*c. 30.â Moses T.
Clough, the nesto'r 'of : the Rensselaer
County barand the. last survivor of the
class of 1834.' of Â¦ Dartmouth College;
William Shaw, head of the law- firm- of
Shaw, Bailey & Murphy, and Benjamin
,W. â¢Kinnejv manager for the Fuller-'
Warren Company of Boston, Mass., lost
their lives in a; fire which partially de
stroyed ; the Troy Club to r day. Al
though the doomed men were seen at
the windows nothing could .be "done to
save them, 7 so- dense was:the smoke' and
so rapid the progress'of the flames. . :
Edward Carpentier of New York was
taken, from" an upper window* by the
firemen and removed to a hospital,
where he is recovering from the effects
of smoke inhaled. He was in tpwn pre
paring for his marriage with a young
society woman of this city.' His escape
from death was regarded as one of the
remarkable features of the fire. "All the
persons killed were occupying rooms
on the upper floor of the club building,
which is four stories in height, and it
was the part the flames attacked first.
The victims had retired about 10
o'clock and were sleeping soundly when
the alarm was given. by the employes.
An effort was made. at once to-reach
the sleeping apartments, but the pro
gress of th,e fire had been so rapid that
the help at? hand could not make their
way to the top floor.
The fire is thought to have been
caused by a lighted cigarette - being
thrown among some combustible mate
rial. The clubhouse was built ten or
twelve years ago at a cost of $500,000.
The loss by fire will reach $55,000. r
Mr. Clough was 89 years of age and
Mr. Shaw was. nearly 70. Both resided
at the club, at which Kinney and Car
pentier were guests.
The police report that while the fire
was at its worst a man was discovered
trying to set fire to the building at the
corner of Broadway and Fifth avenue,
occupied as a news stand. The man es
caped. It is not believed, however, that
the clubhouse fire was of incendiary
origin.

crew failed to see him in time or lost â¢
control of the brakes for a moment,
and the train, whiih was running slow

A French army officer who â¢ recently

region in Central Africa has sent to his
Government curious reports of the isl

amazed when the first steamboat ever

MacVEAGH AT THE HAGUE.
SOME time ago the New York Sun published a |
dispatch from Washington to the effect that the de
parture of Wayne MacVeagh from the Hague, where
he had gone to act as counsel for Venezuela before the
arbitration tribunal, was' caused by dissatisfaction with
his conduct of the case, and that had he not returned
he would have been recalled. "The report went on to
say that among other offenses MacVeagh had vwritten
a. letter to the executive council of the tribunal saying
in effect that if the arbitrators_,wcre lawyers instead of
diplomatists they would know; their business better. It
was added that the remark was regarded as insulting by
the tribunal.
'Shortly afterward the Sun corrected the original re
port, saying it had been misled into doing an injustice
to one whom it described as '"a gentleman and juriscon
sult of high character -and distinguished reputation, not
the least of \vhosc many services to the country has been
his recent professional performance at the Hague."
Mr. 'Â¦ MacVeagh has not been fully satisfied with what
he himself; calls the "full and honorable retraction given
by the Sun," and asserts that retraction "follows false
hoods but lamely and never quite catches up with them,
for. they, are fleet of foot and wonderfully elusive." For
the sake of further refutation, therefore, he has pub
lished the complete text of- his argument before the
High Court' of Arbitration as a convincing! proof that he
did not exceed his rights as counsel and was not in any
way insulting to the tribunal. ; â¢ *
;' The argument is so able and lucid' that it forms a
notably valuable, contribution to the literature of interna
-tional law. and if its publication be due solely to a de
sire to refute the original erroneous report, : then the
error after all has been of some good service. As The Call

Coal Out of Peat.
A firm in Kent, England, has devised
an electrical process for converting or
dinary peat Into firm, smokeless steam
coal at a moderate cost. The peat is
cut and excavated by machinery, load
ed into dumping cars, which convey it
to the plant, where it is packed into
rotary Jron cylinders. The cylinders
being rotated at high velocity, the cen
trifugal pressure, aided by an interior I
beating device, expels nearly all of the'
80 per cent of water in the material.
Electrodes connected with a dynamo
are then inserted in the cylinders in
such a manner that the mass of dried
peat completes the electrodes. The. re
sistance offered by the peat, like the
filament of an incandescent lamp, gen
erates heat which carbonizes the ma
terial, producing a mass of disinte
grated black globules. From the cylin
ders the carbonized material passes to
machines which knead it into a puttjf
llke mass, which is then pressed into
briquettes or left to dry and harden in
masses, which broken Into lumps,

In a certain big downtown wholesale
house it has been a holiday custom to
allow the office employes to buy a fat
turkey at the firm's expense. On the
staff was a broth of a Mission boy, say
sixteen years old and up-to-date. A
few days before Christmas the youth
received word that on and after Janu
ary 1, 1904, his services would no longer
be required. Yesterday the bill for
master office boy's turkey reached the
house. It was $5 SO.
Here is the dialogue that followed:
'"Say, Tommy, don't you think that's
pretty stiff for turkey?" inquired the
cashier.
"Naw, I don't," replied Tommy. "I
had to go all over town to find one that
Avas big enough. You see. I'll ba out of
a job soon and I thought I'd better take
the best of it while it lasted. If youse
hadn't told me I was going to be
fired," continued the youthful philoso
pher, "youse might have got off cheap
er. But I couldn't afford to pass up
this last chance."
Tommy sauntered off whistling and
the cashier caught his breath.
The Secret Out.
Satisfied that, his children would be
. convinced that Santa Claus was a real
and not a mythical character, a well
known insurance agent dressed in the
garb that children usually associate
with their ideas of Kris Kringle and
walked into the nursery 'at his home
Christmas eve. He flattered himself
that his make-up was perfect and that
his little ones would receive him with
the spirit that for months past, in an
ticipation of a joyous Christmas day.
he had been endeavoring to instill into
their minds.
And the children were convinced, all
but one, the youngest, a sturdy little
boy of eight. When the others, at sight
of the long, white beard, the wig of
white hair and red fur-trimmed coat,
shook with fear and expectancy and
tremblingly held out their, little hands
for the presents that Santa Claus in a
gruff voice announced he had for them,
this little chap rose up' and bravely
marched toward his disguised father.
"I want to whisper, Santy," he said
in a voice in which there was not a
sign of fear.

In this enlfghtened age of interna
tional amity it seems strange to read
what the World's Work has to S3jr
about Colombian army methods. "It
it a common thins f f >r a Colombian boy
of 12 or 14 to be thrashed to death with
cowhide whips for 'deserticg' from the
armyâ that is to say. running back
home after he had been forcibly en
listed," says that magazine. "It is
generally common for a mere child to
be nuns up by Ihe thumbs until he
dies, because ho will notâ or cannot â
say where his father is hidden. Women
have been crucified because they have
refused to betray their husbands, and
others have been treated infinitely
worse."
DST2S this not seem to be like the re
port spread among negroes by the peo

that Yankees had hoofs and horns like
the devil?

The San Francisco Call devotes a
page of its Monday's edition to writing
up the resources of the Interior of the
State. Yesterday it published articles
from the pens of C. M. Wooster, and
NT. P. Chipman. president of the. Cali
fornia State Board of Trade. Both
are interesting and will undoubtedly
direct attention to California's almost
unlimited resources. The Call is on
the proper course. All of the great
journals of the State should devote a
little more of their space to building
up the interior, and they will not be
neglectful of their own interests In
doing so, for as the interior progresses
so will their own homes advance and
increase in material wealth.â Madera

IT is announced that St. Petersburg is angry at Ameri-,
can and English sympathy for Japan. This may be a
very serious matter for St. Petersburg, as it is always
serious to get angry, but the United States and Great
Britain will not immediately apologize. or withdraw their
sympathy.
There is something greatly attractive in the aspect
and attitude of Japan. Since her emergence ftoni
national seclusion she has joined Western progress, art
and science to the Oriental character and has shown
what can be done by all Eastern Asia, if the autonomy
and independence of China and Korea be respected.
Looked at philosophically, Japan is the natural leader of
the Mongol races. If they were all in her condition of
advancement and had her parliamentary institutions
and popular participation in government, the advantage
to the whole -world would be inestimable. She has
taught the West that 5 , progress, liberal political institu
tions, and the extension of art and, science are the sure
cure for the yellow peril, about "which Europe has been
often alarmed.
There is something glorious in the intelligence and
firmness and high statesmanship she has shown in all
this negotiation with Russia, and there is something
morally" prreat in her uniform good faith, honor and mod
eration. She does not hesitate to risk war with a nation
that has four times her population and resources, but
with none of her sense of right and justice. She is en
titled to and will have the sympathy of the world if she
take up arms for the just cause she represents. It may
not be that the Government of the United States can
assist her as a government, but the people of the United
States will not hesitate to give her all the aid in their
power. Our principles forbid entangling alliances, offen
sive and defensive, being made by our Government. But
our people are in sentimental alliance and have the spirit'
of assistance with all nations that show the fine spirit of
Japan and for such a cause.
What a contrast between her and her enemy! Russia
pillaging, persecuting and slaughtering Jews, from re
ligious intolerance; forbidding those who expatriate
themselves to visit their birthplaces even under the
passport of other countries, of which they have become
nationals; by decree closing her zone of inflnence. ac
quired by craft in China,. to Jews and forbidding to them
there the exercise' and benefit of their, commercial en
terprise, and in all "ways pursuing a narrow, selfish and
uncivilized policy; while Japan opens all her territory
to the free and safe intercourse of all nations; estab
lishes her own steamship lines; gives equal protection to
all religions; educates all of her people and participates
in promoting the progress of art and science.
If the intelligence of the civilized world have to
choose between Japan and Russia, without exception
Japan will be fellowshiped and supported. If war
come and brute force override Japanl, then indeed will
the light of Asia have gone out, and the knout and the Cos
sack will extend over' the East the policy that lashes
students for aspiring to freedom and murders people on j
saints' days as a religious pastime.

Tubes in the Body.
BT W. R. C. LATSON. M. D.
(Editor Health Culture Magazine, New York.)
Copyright. 190CL by Joseph B. Bowie*.
Among,, the mpst remarkable and
beautiful structures of the body are the
blood tubes â the system of '"piping" by
means of -which the blood Is conveyed
from the heart to the tissues, through
the tissues themselves and then back to
; the heart. Of the heart itself, that won
derful double pump, to' the action of
which the flow of the blood is mainly
due, and of the blood, the center and
intermediary of all life processes, we
have written in previous articles.
The tubes conveying the blood from
the heart are called 'arteries. And the
structure, of these tubes is- peculiarly
adapted to the work they have to do.
In discussing the heart's action it was
stated that the heart contracted about
seventy times each minute. At each of
these contractions it throws into the
arteries which go to the tissues about
160 cubic centimeters, or neardly six
ounces of blood. Xow if the artery
were a hard, unyielding tube, like a
lead gas pipe or a clay water main, it
would require great force to keep the
blood moving, through the three or four
feet of tubing, which lie between the
heart and the more distant tissues. But
the artery is far from being rigid. Its
walls are very strong and very elastic,
much more so than ordinary rubber
tubing. So when the quick contraction
of the left ventricle throws a tumbler
ful of blood into- the arteries they ex
pand to take it in, and then by their
own elasticity they contract again.
The blood once in the artery cannot
get back into the heart because of the
closing of the aortic valve, which
guards the opening of the large artery
leading from the heart to the tissues.
So as the artery contracts again to Its
natural caliber the blood thrown into
it from the heart is passed on In a kind
of wave. This elastic expansion and re
coil of the arteries is a most powerful
assistance to the heart in propelling
the blood through the body. And it is
in this alternate enlargement and con
traction of all the arteries, once for
each closing up of the heart, that j
causes what is called the pulse. The
pulee may be felt at the wrist, the
temple, in the groin, under the arm or !
at any other point where an artery I
passes sufficiently near the surface to !
' be felt by the finger. j
In the disease known as old age
(eapillary-arterio fibrosis) there is a
chance in the nature of the material
composing the walls of the arteries and
capillaries, which causes thent to lose
their power of elestic response to the
heart impulse. This condition is event
ually fatal in every case, thus showing
the importance of the arterial expan
sion and recoil.
Xot only, however, must the artery
be elastic; it must be strong â strong
enough to withstand a pressure which
at one point is equal to a column of
mercury eight inches high. And the
structure of the artery is such as to
insure the highest possible degree of
those two qualities, strength and elas
ticity. The arterial walls arc- com
posed of several coats or layers. In
side these is a thin layer of epithelial
cells (called here endotheliai). These
are of Irregular shape, and are joined
together at the edges by a kind of
cement. Outside of this lies the prin
cipal coat of the artery itself, com
posed of several layers, the most im
portant of which is made up of tiny
muscle cells, which pass round Ihe cali
ber of the artery and impart to it that
combination of elasticity and strength
which is so important to its functions.
Each of these tiny snakeliks muscle
cells is a minute muscle. 7n some of
the arteries these muscles have a spe
cial set of nerves, which regulate the
caliber of the blood tube, causing it at
one time to contract, causing pallor and
coldness of that part of the body, and
under other circumstances to expand,
thus containing more blood and result
ing in added heat to tne part, with
flushing.
From the 'heart the blood passes into
one large artery called the aorta. The
aorta gives off a number of smaller
branches, and these give off still small
er branches, which again subdivide,
and so on, until the smallest arteries,
called arteriols, are reached.
The blood stream returns from the
tissues to the heart through blood tubes
which differ widely from the arteries
Justo described. The arterial blood flow
ins from the heart is under strong
pressure, and is Bent forth in powerful
and rapid jets. To withstand this pres
sure the arteries must be strong : and
elastic. But the; blopd going back to
the heart is under but little pressure,
and the flow is steady. Therefore the
blood tubes leading to the heart (the
veins) need not be, and are not, as
strong nor as elastic as the arteries.
Like the artery, the vein is a tube con
sisting of a number of layers, which,
however, we may roughly divide into
inner and outer, the inner composed of
endothellal . and the outer of muscle
cells. The walls of the veins are much
thinner than those of the arteries, and
there is no pulsation or throbbing in
the venous flow.

I have performed hundreds of mar
riage ceremonies, but have only asked
one bride to promise obedience to her
husband. 1 did this because she in
sisted upon it and I have never asked
h<*r whether she was glad. Probably
not one American woman in 10,000
has any intention of obeying her hus
band in the â¢sense contemplated in
the marriage service, and so what is
the use of asking her to promise what
she does not mean to perform? It al
ways seems to me like sham.
The real problem of matrimony is
not obediem e. but deference. There
Is a certain subordination, submission,
recognition of superiority in both
friendship and marriage that is of the
utmost import&iiee.
The case stands this way:
Kither the man and woman have
equally strong wills and good Judg
ment <whÂ£^h is a very gTeat improb
ability) or the man has the highest
endowment in these qualities; or, per
chance, the woman.
Now. the most important question
for every young couple is the early
discovery of this superiority and its
constant recognition. The little
home kingdom needs to be ruled
by the noblest mind. The do
mestic .Â«tate thrives best under
an aristocratic â¢ fann of govern
ment. But here's th*Â» "rub." In the
vaet majority of cases it is. the one
who has the least sense who has the
most tgoti.tm. and the married life
becomes one long struggle on the part
of the weaker member of the firm to
assert his or her personality. Our
â¢â¢personality:- How we dread to have
it swallowed up or even subordinated.
And it would be a terrible thing to re
ally lose it in another; to have one's
will and judgment so completely ab
sorbed in that of a husband or wife
as rea!ly to become a nobody:
ThiÂ« tragedy often happens in the
married life. You have seen women
who wore nothing in th*- world but
little o, hoes of some big, blustering,
domineering man. You have seen
eix-foot men nho wore wagged like
a tail by liaie. aggressive, capable and
determined women. It is always a
pitiful and gem-rally a contemptible
sight. Losing- one's individuality in
thlc way is like being sucked down
into quicksand. It would hnve been
ignoble in Solomon's weakest wife to
have thus surrendered h<Â»r personality
evrn to the wisest <if men.
And it is the instinctive fear of this
ignoble surrender that often lies at the
bottom .-f lifelong matrimonial unhap
piness. A man or a woman makes the
slow, painful discovery of his or her
inferiority and it is humiliating beyond
Â¦words. It is something to be covered
up; to be denied; to be resented. In
the* blind struggle against the inevit
able f< If -assertion is the last resort.
"U'hat this inferior mind lacks in great
ness it must make up for by obstinacy
and aggressiveness. Day after day and
year after year it struggles for su
premacy by this fatal method, ajways
developing its egotism at the expense
of its judgment: always sacrificing its
best interests to avert Its threatened
loss of individuality.
This is a very subtle but very com
mon and very terrible evil in married
life. Few people have the meta
physical acumen io understand their
own motives or the operation of their
minds. It is a blind, instinctive and
desperate struggle for existenceâ the
existence of the personality! The fear
of being mentally absorbed is like the
fear of being bodily devoured. And
there is a genuine basis for the appre
hension, for it is a characteristic of
ell superior minds, or most of them,
to swallow up inferior ones. Power de
acends into tyranny as rivers descend
into the sea. There is a deep and ter
rible joy in dominating minds that are
beneath us. It is this delight that turns
men into brutes and women into vipers.
But if it is a real danger (and a dan
ecr to be avoided) that the very per
sonality of the weaker partner in the
greatest business, combination of all
time shon!d bo swallc-wed up and ex
tinguished, it is a still greater one that
St rhould become a self-assertive and
pavagc egotist. And the simple truth
of the matter is that home after home
has been wrecked because some vain
and stupid man or woman was not will
ing to acknowledge the superiority of
a nobler mind. Ftop for a moment and
think of the homes you have seen ship
wrecked on this rock. Stop and lnquJre
whether it may not be the peril of your
own.
But why should it be no terrible to
acknowledge that your husband is no
bler and larger than yourself? Be
thankful if it is so. Try to climb up
on his broad shoulders and see the
â¢woild through his eyes. What an op
portunity, to be in such close contact
with an intelligence nnd a character
so much greater than your own! If
you are modest and simple and true
to yourself, he will not crush you; he
will elevate you. He will not bully you;
he will enlighten you. Bend your proud
little neck to the yoke of his judgment.
Be less assertive and agg-essive. Sit
at his feet and learn. If it become
necessaryâ obey. Sometimes his mind
thas so much wider sweep than yours
that it will be far better for you' to be
like a child than a wife.

and the natives sometimes use it for
canoes and also as a float in crossing the
lanes of water which separate the isl
ands,. Usually the canoes used by the
natives are made of reeds, but not in
frequently a native transfers his family
and flocks from one island to another
by simply swimming across. The cat
tle become accustomed to this mode of
changing pasturage. Colonel Deste
nave estimates that the number of in
habited islands is about eighty, sup
porting a population of about 50.000
people. There are some 70.000 or 80.000
head of cattle on the islands, as well as
a number of horses.
A torpedo-boat ran amuck in the East River a few
days ago, and after inflicting material damage upon it
self and upon an unoffending ferry-boat was sent to
drydock for repairs. It is- all well enough for us to
clothe our fighting sailor men with the attribute of
being rough and ready, but it *might also be well to
consider that a little less roughness will be warrant of
more readiness when we need the boats for something
else than show.
THE Colusa Sun, which is easily the leading Demo
cratic paper of the State, says: "There is some
talk of the Democrats making the confirmation of
the Panama canal treaty an issue of the next campaign.
If they want a winnmg issue we would advise against it.','
The>Sun then proceeds to denounce the treaty and the
transaction'as so dishonest that "if it were relegated to
private transactions it would land . the perpetrator in
prison."
Then why not make an issue of it and prove to the
people that it is a transaction of such criminal character?
Surely the Sun is mistaken as to the nature of the mat
ter, or has no confidence at all in the honesty and honor
of the people, or in the capacity of the Democratic
party to make such an issue plain to the understanding.
But, is it such a transaction? Panama has repeatedly
been independent and has been subjugated by force by
New Granada and Colombia. The great Bolivar wanted
the canal. JHe wanted his own people to build it. He
prayed for peace among those whom he had freed from
Spain, in order that their armies might be set to digging
the waterway. But they would not be peaceable. They
would not rise to the height of his patriotic aspirations,
and he. died broken-hearted and left civil confusion, dis
honor and dishonesty among those whom he had hoped
to establish in civil stability and commercial progress.
The people of Panama appreciated his policy and pur
pose, and though often whipped have never lost the de
sire to regain their independence that they might pro
ject the greaf ideas of the Liberator. But they were held
down and prevented, though they have always repre
sented the policy of Bolivar and the best Central Ameri
can type. The Bogota government has insisted . upon
dictating isthmian policy. It has blocked every feasible
proposition for a canal, constructed either by private
American enterprise or by this nation.
At last, under circumstances of supreme provocation,
and after frank warning of their purpose, the isthmians
have again declared their independence, and again
Bogota has asserted sovereignty and ownership of. the
isthmus, with the power to continually block the canal.
The United States has only taken advantage of a situ
ation that was created at Bogota and not at Washington.
It has joined the other nations in recognition of the in
dependence of a sovereignty that wants the canal, and
has the power to grant all concessions, privileges, and
powers required for its construction. If there be in
the history of the transaction a taint of dishonesty, it is
upon Bogota and not upon Washington.
It is not becoming in an American to denounce his
own government as so dishonest in international mat
ters that it violates-either .the. law or the ethics govern
ing the conduct of individuals. The whole case was
stated by Lewis Cass, when Secretary of State under
Buchanan. As the Sun is Democratic, we ask it to con
sider this statement of Cass: "The progress of events
has rendered the interoceanic routes across the narrow
portion of Central America vastly important to the com
mercial world, and especially to the United States,
whose possessions extend along the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts, and demand the speediest and easiest, modes of
communication. While the rights of sovereignty of the
states occupying, this region should be always respected,
we shall expect that their rights be exercised in a spirit
befitting the occasion and the wants and circumstances
that have arisen. Sovereignty has its duties as welLas
its rights, and none of these local governments, even if
administered with more regard to the. just demands of
other nations than they have been, would be permitted
in a spirit of Eastern isolation close the gates of in
tercourse on the great highways of the world, and justify
the act by the pretension that these avenues of trade and
travelbelong to them and that they choose to shut them,
or/ what is almost equivalent, to incumber them with such
unjust relations as would prevent their general use."
Now will the. Sun or any other Democratic paper pre
tend that Cass and Buchanan would have done differently
from Roosevelt, and Hay? When Cass said that isth
mian sovereignty would "not be permitted" to do just
what Colombia did, will some one tell us how she would
not be permitted? Such permission could be forbidden
only by the use" of force, and in the situation created at
Bogota the only way to make 'good the policy of Cass
would have been direct and immediate war upon Colom
bia, without waiting for Panama to assert her former in
dependence -as a sovereign nation. We can reach no
other conclusion if the declaration of Cass, approved by
Buchanan, were a sincere statement of national policy
and not mere vaporing.
The Sun should remember that the Democratic party
indorsed the Ostend manifesto, and according to the
doctrine of that official declaration, applied to the
isthmian situation, what would that party have done
under the circumstances of the refusal of Bogota to
ratify the treaty and permit the canal? There is no
room for do.ubt thaj a Democratic President would have
considered himself fortunate to be able to stop short of
the theory of that manifesto, under which he would have
seized and annexed the isthmus. * We ask calm consider
ation of this great issue, every step in which taken by
President Roosevelt has been in conformity, to interna
tional right and law and honor.
A Message to Yohanna.
Policeman Flrnn thought that he
must have been a-dreaming. Over there
in the shadow of the gathering dusk
he spied the angular figure of a man
climbing, monkey-like, up a telegraph
pole. A coil of wire wa3 dangling from
the arm of the climber. Before Police
man Flynn could interfere the shadowy
figure on the pole had tossed one end of
his wire over a strand of electric light
wire and descended with the two loose
ends of the waving string of copper in
his mouth.
"Hel-lo, Yohanna." came in a shrill
voice from across the street. The blue
coat peered around the pole, and there
he saw the lanky figure of the man
standing with one end of the wire to
his ear and the other clenched in a flst
which he held to his mouth, trumpet
like.
"Hel-lo, Yohanna; I want vit you to

gathered the lanky German into the
hurry-up barouche. The Commissioners
sent (he poor fellow up to Napa, where
he is still trying to telephone to Yo

the messages which he tried daily to

MARYSVILLE, Dec. 30.â The second
section of the northbound Oregon
express ' met with an accident
in the railroad yards in this
city at an early hour this
morning, the smoker and day coach
leaving the rails at a switch just north
of thS depot. The smoker was turned
over on its side and the passengers piled
up In the aisle. Both cars were badly
damaged and the*smoker wrecked.
The smoker was Hlled with passen
gers, all of whom were more or less
shaken up, bruised and^cut', by glass
and splinters. J"he injured were re
moved to the* depot waiting-room,
where Dr. Powell of this city attended
them. The injured requiring nis as
sistance were L.. Hencratt of Cotton
wood, cheek and hands cut; J. L. Stars
lin, Bonanza, Oregon, face and .wo
fingers badly cut; O. E. Naugh, Chlco,
back sprained and leg bruised, cut on
hands and face; Martin Zambalich,
newsboy, cut by broken glass. The de
railment was caused by a point of the
switch rail being bent. The. train had
gone in on a side track to pick up a car
containing the Foxy- Grandpa company
and was returning to the main line.
Several of the cars had passed over the
switch when the smoker left the rail
and pulled the day ca> otf. Tho train
was running very slowly and the cars
went quite a distance before tipping
over. The wrecking train arrived here
about 6 o'clock and at noon the track
was cleared. The tiain left on its
northern journey about six houi*s late.

A quiet wedding, that might easily be
construed as an elopement, occurred in
the parlors of the California Hotel last
evening. The contra g parties were
Miss Ivy M. Perkins, daughter of the
late and well remembered A. f. Per
kinp. ar.d Joseph D. Cerkel, a promi
nent young grain merchant of Suisun.
The wedding was the culmination of a
courtship beginning in Suisun, where,
for a number of months, the young
lady had been en&ageu In teaching
school. It was in the latter town that
Cerkel first met Miss Perkins and an
acquaintance rapidly developed into a
iove affair between the young couple.
Recently Cerkel became aware of the
fact that his attentions to the pretty
rchoolmarm were not particularly
pleasing to the relatives of the young
lady, but apparently the news did not
discourage him in his wooing. * When
the school vacation began and the fair
object of his attentions prepared to re
turn to this city to spend the holidays
with her widowed mother and sister at
their home, 1825 Eddy street, he exact
ed a promise of marriage from Miss
Perkins, whether or not parental con
sent was obtained.
Yesterday Cerkel came to this city
and caJled upon Miss Perkins to fulfill
her pledge, and true to her word she
entered into his suggested plans for an
immediate ceremony. Horatio Muzzy, a
friend of Cerkel. and Miss Lillian Her
sog, a cousin of the prospective groom,
were taken into the confidence of the
young couple and with the assistance
of Muzzy arrangements were hastily
rr.ade for the Avedding at the California
Hotel, and Judge J. C. B. Hebbard was
engaged to officiate, a #sity hi= Honor
gracefully performed at the appointed
hour last evening in the presence of
Muzzy and Miss Herzog, who acted as
best man and bridesmaid respectively.
The wedding over the bridal party
adjourned to the sr.pper-room and
Â£fier a repast bride and groom went to
a nÂ»ighbori:ig telephone through which
they concÂ«yed to Mrs. Corker* relatives
the news o? tbeir marriage and then

PAKKXTS NONE THE WISER
The figures were very pretty and ef
fective, the dancers going through their
paces with contagious merriment. But
will some one solve the riddle of why
some people take their pleasure so sol
emnly? There were some who sat along
the wall who looked as though they
were attending a "wake" â but, happily.
MAVY PRETTY FIGURES.
All hail the debutante! In dainty
grown and budding beauty she tripped
into the ballroom at the Palace Hotel
last night to dance her first "big" cotil
lon. And she danced it with the effer
vescence that makes youth a joy. Her
cheeks glowed, her eyes sparkled arid
her laughter made merry music "twixt
the dances. Ah, but the music was
fine! No Teuton masters for the
debutante, but the gay, patriotic "Yan
kee Doodle" and his compatriot airs.
Those are the airs that engulf ennui â
and ennui is not to the debutante's lik
ing. While the ball was not essentially
a debutante function, the dainty buds
were there en masse. So, too, were the
belles of seasons now agone. Likewise
were the matrons there at the genial
bidding of the hostess, Mrs. Monroe
Salisbury. Her absence, by the way,
from the function for which she stands
sponsor was universally regretted, and
while her illness prevented her attend
ance and her cordiality was sadly
missed the details of the affair did not
suffer. Ab has been usual at recent
functions, the decorations were confined
to the little forest of firs at the end of
the hall, behind which the makers of
the music sat.
Ing gown of red chiffon.
MJss Bernle Drown wore black, 'in.
which she is very attractive. A touch
of turquoise blue gave an "air" to her
toilette.
Miss Newell Drown was gowned in
yellow point d'esprit, touched up with
black velvet. " ."','Â¦
Â¦ Mrs. Frank Sullivan wore a regal
glitter gown, black with silver span
gles and a ropef of diamonds.
Miss ! Alys Sullivan, a debutante, was
gowned in white point d'esprit and on
her hair she wore a chaplet of tiny
roses.
Miss Cheeseborough, also a bud, wore
a quaintly pretty gown of figured chif
fon. ' .
Miss Melita Pease, another of the sea
son's favorites, was gowned in white
chiffon, with a beautiful Irish point
bertha.
Miss Margaret Wilson looked very
smart In white, with a garland of yel
low roses trailing from her left shoul
der.
Miss Charlotte Ellinwood wore a
pretty Dink chiffon frock, x
Miss Murison was a dainty maid in
a pink diaphanous gown.
M16S Hyde-Smith wore one of the
smartest frocks on the floor, a* blue
point d'esprit with winged sleeves flow-
Ing from the shoulders. It was stun
ningly effective.
Refreshments were served in the ves
tibule, where the punch bowl held high
carnival.
Supper was served In the Maple room,
where the tables bore the roseate glow
of red shades. And a right merry party
clinked glasses beneath the ruby light.
there weren't many.
The cotillion was led by Miss Chris
tine Pomeroy, the dainty bud, who was
beautifully gowned in a filmy. affair of
white point d'esprit. With perfect
sangfroid, she fulfilled her difficult po
sition, in which she was cleverly as
sisted by Douglass Waterman, Whar
ton Thurston, Robert Eyre and Sidney
Salisbury.
In Mrs. Salisbury's absence, the fol
lowing ladies assisted in receiving:
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs. Carter Pit
kin Pomeroy, Mrs. Russell J. Wilson,
Mrs. Gordon Blanding, Mrs. Hyde-
Smith and Mrs. Henry Glass.
The gowns were especially smart.
Among those observed were:
Mrs. Henry Glass, a beautiful gown
of white silk, with Irish point.
Mrs. Hyde-Smith, a robe ofd'Alen
con lace and white chiffon. The gown
was given distinction by a chou of lav
ender, blue and pink velvet at the
left of the corsage.
Mrs. Alexander, blue silk with blue
chiffon. With it she wore a wreath of
violets, which gave it a Parisian air.
Mrs. Carter Pltkin Pomeroy, black
Brussels net, elaborately trimmed with
black d'Alencon lace.
Mrs. Jack Spreckels, black Jetted
gown, that was one of the prettiest
worn.
JIORE BEAUTIFUL. GOWNS.

chiffon flounces.

rose in her hair.

Argument on an application for a
writ of habeas corpus for the release
from custody of J. M. Evans, saloon
keeper, 119 Eddy street, was heard
before Judge Cook yesterday and the
writ was granted and the prisoner or
dered discharged. Attorney W. H.
Cook, who represented Evans, argued
that no crime had been committed by
Evans, as in the section of the statute
under which the charge was made no
penalty was attached.
Evans was arrested on a warrant
sworn to by Mrs. Lavinia Raemsch,
charging him with the felony of sell
ing incumbered personal property. It
was alleged that Evans sold to Mrs.
Raemsch the furniture and other per
sonal effects in a lodging-house at 131
Tayldr street while there was a mort
gage on the property. The .case was
heard before Police Judge Fritz, who.
held Evans to answer before the Su
perior Court. Then followed the ap
plication for the writ of habeas cor
pus.

of State. McCord sued for a writ of
mandate compelling Curry to issue to
the M<_Cord Oil and Development
Company a certiQcate cf incorpora
tion. Curry had refused the certifi
cate on the ground that the articles of
incorporation had been certified to
before Notary Public Charles Edel
man, who, ho claimed, was not a no
tary at the time of the certification.
He ba.<=ed Ms refusal on the ground
that Edelman had only been appoint
ed to fill the uncxpired term and
signed the document after the four
years' term of his predecessor had ex
pired.-
In a decision rendered by Judge
Bloas yesterday in the case of George

Secretary of State, the court holds
th-jit the appointment of a notary pub
lic entitles him to the office for four
years. He holds that there are "no
unexpired terms" of notaries, and
that therefore a man appointed a
notary shall serve for four years from
the dr.to of his appointment,, and not
the length of time remaining under
the commission of his predecessor.

At that the dinner did not cost him
the light, an hfe only cbance to win whs
to land one of his wild sayings,* which
was Impossible owing to Corbett's clev

this match is from the point of vietr

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Still another long shot bobbed to the
surface in the mile and seventy-yard
event. Willie Haack had the leg up
on Arthur Rav, against which 15 to 1
was laid, and after meeting with -only
moderate racing luck got home first on
the outsider, a neck before Expedient,
also auoted at 15. Twenty to one was
laid about Dotterel, which finished
third. Â¦ Lunar, backed from 9 to 5 to 6
to 5, ran fourth, the plunge on her
hardly being justified on the mare's
preceding race.
Red Cross Nurse was plugged to win
the final mile number and a Tagged
start contributed to her success. Hilde
brand got away sailing on the filly and
after making all the pace she lasted
long enough to dispose of Avenger by
a neck. The odds against Ebony went
from 4 to 5 to 3 to 2. The start ruined
whatever chance he may have pos
sessed.
To Kockaway belonged the honor ot
being the only favorite to reach, the
ffoal first. The gfcorl-priced ones
mourned were Oro Viva. Mountebank.
Lunar, Jvenilworth and Ebony. The at
tendance was gcoÂ«J and the betting
spirited.
Hildebrand set the ball In motion by
placing Troy over the line winner of
the first race at odds or fi to 1. He coT-
Tared Ora Viva, the favorite, near the
paddock, and in a driving finish re
ceived the vertlict !Â»y a neck. Yeljoiv
Â«tone. at odds of !S to 1, raft third. Hil
ary looked a possible winner turning
inio th& stretch, but royld not stand
the dip. Oro Viva was bumped by the
winner, but Careen wade no complaint
to the judges.
After suffering two crushing defeats,
Rocfcaway, the Burns & Waterhouse
colt, gathered in a purse. He did not
do it impressively, though, and Tviil
have to show a whole It vC Improve
ment o before being classed as & top
notcher.
The son of Altamox was installed a
pronounced choice agnin and it took
hard urjjiHg on the part of Tommyi
Burns to get him tcrthe front, and then
he only downed Otto Stifel half a
length. Judge ran third.
Hildebrand was to the front again in
the Futurity course sprint following
astride the 15 to 1 chance Jennie
Hughes. The mare was overlooked by
the general public and, receiving ex
cellent treatment at Hildebrand's
hands, finished first, half a length be
fore Mountebank, the favorite. Planet,
the two-year-old, was well backed and
ran a good third. Atwood, another
two-year-old which was accorded con
siderable suppert, got away none too
well and was not prominent.
Arthur ray is first.
San Nicolas, the black four-year-old
from the Burns & Waterhouse stable,
picked ub 117 pounds in the six and a
half furlong handicap at Ingleslde yes
terday and showed a clean pair of heels
to a small but select company. Kenil
worth, delegated to carry 12S pounds
and with Tommy Burns up, opened fa
vorite, but the smart ones' did not fig
ure that the bird's claws were sharp
enough to scratch out, and played their
coin all around him. The stable fancied
the chances of San Nicolas, and he re
mained "a consistent second choice
throughout the b'ettiflg. it is barely
possible that Iridius was as well
supported; at half a point higher. Bell
piloted San Kicolas. and after lndul*.
ins Jrtdius with the lead for about
three-eighths of a mile assumed the
/rant position, winning under three
quarter speed. Iridius lasted. Just long
enough to take the place /rom DoliJ-
Hayman. The favorite did pot appear
at his l>est, finishing fourth.

The department of the High School
Association voted unanimously yester
day morning in favor of a reduction of
the units required by the universities.
Fifteen units are required, but in the
opinion of the committee thirteen would
be more reasonable. The report was
made by Dr. A. W. Scott of the Ala
meda High School, who stated that the
high standard required by the
university for entrance does not allow
the students sufficient time for voca
tional work. Another point raised was
that a great many of the students who
wish to enter the university are girls,
and in order to attain the required
standard they overdo themselves at a
period when their health should be
most carefully protected.
Professor Clark . of Lowell High
School, who spoke on "Units of High
School Work," held the same general
ideas. He said that since 1899 the Uni
versity of California has defined its en
trance subjects as units, the unit be
ing five recitations a week for a year.
This, he held, is very injurious to the
bjgh school, as he considers the univer
sity should be content with specifying
the material in its entrance subjects
and the high school free to determine
the work. The present system, he said,
leads the high schools to place work
before scholars when they are unfitted
for it. â¢
Some interesting facts and figures
were brought out by Joseph O'Connor,
principal of the Mission High School; in
his address on "High School Teachers'
Salaries." He compared the' salarjesof
the teacher with those paid the me
chanic and showed by figures that the
man who earns his bread by, the sweat
'of his brow is better paid than the pro-

MEX WHO WERE PRESENT.
The traveling men who were ban
queted last night had come from many
parts of the country. Eighteen States
and Territories were represented. The
occasion was a house warm ing in honor
of the first Christmas of the firm in
the new quarters. The management
pays the fare to and from the various
men's homes. During the last two days
they have been entertained by the firm,
taken to the Cliff House, theater and
other points of interest in and about
San Francisco. Yesterday they were
taken up Mount Tamalpais.
It is an unusual thins to find a firm
that treats its employes with as much
consideration as does Schilling's. The
members of the, firm prepared for each
and every man who came. to the ban
quet a little verse written especially for
him. This was placed with the menu
opposite, his seat at the table. The
night was passed merrily in speech
making and feasting. Between the
speeches a stringed orchestra, hidden
in the profusion of trees, played pretty
selections. The whole affair bore the
evidence of careful planning and artis-.
tic execution.
FROM DIFFERENT STATES.
Amid a mass of Christmas trees,
ferns and flowers, resembling a small
portion of Golden Gate Park, the trav
eling men of the firm of Schilling & Co.
were banqueted last night in the firm'3
new building at the corner of Folsom
and Second streets.
The large delivery room of the house
was transformed by the magic hands
and artistic eyes of Charlotte F. Wil
liams and Carl Schilling into a spring
time scen^. On entering what is gener
ally the shipping room one could not
tell whether he had got into a conserv
atory of greens or a small part of a
beautiful park, decorated with prettily
colored lights. â¢i*'.-
In the center of the large court ivas
a circular table, seating seventy-nine
guests. In the space surrounded by
the table was a fountain springing out
of amass of greens, the spraying wa
ter being lit up with pretty red lights.
Above the table, stretching from the
center of the ceiling in great droops
toward the table were long strings of
greens, interwoven with myriads of. in
candescent lights. Surrounding the
table and forming the background were
500 Christmas trees, deftly arranged so
that they had the natural forest ap
pearance. Hundreds of red balloons,
bearing the mark "S. B.,7 floated ar
tistically among the greens. Large
numbers of hanging baskets of greens
and ferns hanging from the ceiling
completed the decorations. The court
was a perfect garden spot and reflect
"ed great credit upon its designers,
Charlotte F. Williams and Carl Schill
ing. ..
State Mineralogist Aubury e a y s that
;he Epace in the mining building will
not be sufficient to represent the min
\g industry of California adequately
a competition with other States. Kan
sas and Missouri, for ir.stanct, which
have but three minerals Â»to show, as
against fifty-one mineral substances in
California, will occupy as gre<u, or pos
sibly greater, space than will Califor
nia at the exposition.
In the meantime the space that was
ailotted to California in tho education
building has practically all been al
lotted to the public and other schools
in the State. There is, therefore, a
chance, as Stanford has not agreed to
exhibit and the University of Califor
nia has waited until the spaci has been
distributed, that the educational sys
tem of California, as illustrated by ex
hibits at St. Louis, will be devoid of
any representative showing cl either
">i its great universities.
L'XIVCUSITV SPACE.
Trebles are accumulating for the
Calif ri\xa. Commislsoners to fct. Louis.
Th- a difficulties, grow largely < ut of the
lesfre of certain counties to occupy
nrcrer space in the agriculture building
ai St. Louis. The room that the Com
missioners secured could be filled sev
eral tim^s if the representations of th<?
Â¦ unties concerning their nesds are to
he accepted. On the other hand the
Commissioners sÂ»ay that some of the
counties are mistaken in the space they
-equire and that it is largely a matter
of installation. More can be put in a
certain space than is supposed by those
who have not had experience In installs
ing products for display at expositions.
Some time ago Commissioners Filcher
and Wiggins and Secretary Willis be
took themselves to Catallna Island and
there talked over In seclusion the mat
ter of space and the distribution of it
among the counties that will exhibit.
At last accounts there werÂ« thirty of
these couÂ»itifs. but it is rumored that
at least two in the San Joaquin Valley
that proposed to exhibit jointly have
concluded to Take part only In the gen
f-ral State display of California pro
ducts and cot show as individual
counties.
COUNTIES SEX1> DELEGATES.
Inuring the two days jurt passed a
Ftrong delegation, representative of the
Â¦en counties belonging to the Sacra
ipnto County Valley Development As
nciation has been in the city confer
ing with Commissioner Filcher. No
allotment of ypace has been made yet.
It was impossible to reach a final de
termination when* the two Commission
er* met at Catalina Island. The con-
Oitldna since have not been entirely
favorable. Meanwhile the representa
tives '>f the counties north o? Tthachapi
and Commissioner Filcher have been
in continual correspondence or confer
ence.
The ouestion as to whether the Uni
versity of California will have thy space
at St. Louis desired by President Whee
ler and the faculty is still problemat
ical. Months ago the university was
invited to se!>vt space in a section set
apart especially for universities, this
invitation coming directly from St.
Louis, but no move was mad-Â» to take
adya ntegr of the offer. Then the uni
versity* vvns urged by the St. Louis
Commissioners to exhibit, but no action
was taken. It was only recently that
the university applied to the author
ities at St. Iv:uis to be given a lar^e
.'â¢;>ac; for exhibition purposes. The
answer has been returned Â¦ from St.
Louis that such space can bt given
only in case some earlier applicant for
room relinquishes . .what has been
awarded, the rcliniuishmer't to be
made by the opening of the new year.

Miss Mae O'Donnell of the Fremont
Primary School brought forth an ag
gregation of "Emmy Lous" and stal
wart lads with sweet voices, and they
thrilled the teachers with a concord bf
sweet sound. If these children ap
peared at any theater in thjs city and
sung as they did yesterday they would
score a decided hit. They rendered four
songs, but Auber's "Morning" ' and
Foster's "Old Black Joe" were the best.
The audience sat back in breathless
silence as the children's voices filled
the theater with the plaintive melody
of the Southland and tears came to
many eyes. The singing of this youth
ful choral did much to prove the effi
ciency of the local school department.
Professor S. H. Clark of the Universi
ty of Chicago received a generous
greeting when introduced by the presi
dent. His address was on "Interpreta
tive Reading" and it surpassed his ef
forts of the previous day.
The speaker appealed to his' auditors
to not allow themselves to be carried
away by the desire to gain riches, but
to pause and appreciate the beauties of
poetry and enrich their minds with
good literature. He ! illustrated his
meaning by allusion to the line "ane
never lifted up a stone," used by
Browning in one of his poems. Profes
sor Clark said he never appreciated
the meaning of the line until he had
discovered it in William "Wordsworth's
beautiful pastoral poem "Michael." He
grew eloquent in his narration of the
story in the poem and moved his lis
teners by the fervor and brilliance of
his remarks. Professor Clark's lecture
was illustrated with stanzas from the
poets, -which he recited with great ex
pression. When he concluded his mas
terly address the teachers applauded
him heartily.
An adjournment was taken until this
afternoon.-
PUPILS SIXG SWEETLY.
Wo have learned that It If not the knowl
edge alone, nor. the training passed through to
obtain It, which makes the true teacher; but,
as in all other departments of life, it is largely
personality â a very important factor in the
formation of the character of those who imi
tate. Many children come to us from homes
where the finer graces and qualities of life
are unknown, and the teacher Is tii^ first per
son with whom they come In. contact who
evinces refinement. Many children run wild
liecause mothers are too busily engaged with
the dressmaker or in attending the club, while
the father must spÂ«-nd his waking hours In
gaining food and clothing for his family. The
consequence is that the boy hae little or no
restraint In the home, and the school Is the
first place where he finds his purposes crossed.
He la comparatively unchecked, and orders
hip life as he pleases. The teacher takes the
toy. with all these tendencies, and sees at
once that he- must correct the wrong and
Instil the richt.
"School Discipline" was the subject
of the address of James A. Foshay,
City Superintendent of L.os Angeles
Schools, to the teachers. HÂ» pointed out
the best means of maintaining discip
line in the schoolroom. In part he said:
' DISCIPLINE IX SCHOOLS.
Tou can readily eee from this how very im
portant Is the introduction of new teachers
Into cur department, for it Is with the Intro
duction only that the school directors take a
real part. After a teacher has passed through
the eutstitute class and has served her period
of probation as a probationary: teacher she
can only be elected < permanently, into the de
partment upon the recommendation of the
principal under whom ehe has taught and of
the Superintendent of Public Schools. You
can see from this that the responsibility .does
not rost entirely upon that much-abused class,
the school director, but upon those who should
have an intimate knowledge of the teachers'
ability. It has been the custom to lay all
faults, real or imaginary, existing among our
teachers, upon the school. directors; their backs
are broad; criticism of their a<?ts is a neces
eary accompaniment to their position; they
are used to it, although It is not always as
pleasant as could be desired, but as a matter
of fact the real responsibility for the final
placing of teachers in this department rests
not upon them, but upon the principals and
upon the Superintendent:
And when we have our annuity fixed upon
a firm basis, when our teachers after an active,
conscientious life spent in the schoolroom, can
feel that their remaining years are not un
provldsd for, when the $2 mt-nthly Increase
to their salaries is devoted to the annuity
fund, which I proposed some months ago and
which I have since advocated *and shall con
tinue to advocate until, I trust, the desired
result is Attained â when this comes to nass,
then, imlped. will our department ana our
teachers be as near perfection as possible.

boards of education actually thought it pos

charges and trying her. The present beard in
the last year has paid SX7.0OQ rectifying errors
of this kind made by former boards. One at

from a club wojnan's standpoint. She j
said that while as a rule Boards of Ed
ucation would do nothing to improve
the appearance of schoolrooms they
-would willingly accept anything pre
sented to them. â¢ Other addresses were
made by Mrs. A. G. White, C. P. Niel- j
son, Miss Emelia Kalisher, F. H. |
Meyer and Miss Katherine Ball. j
At the session of the County Boards i
ot Education the following resolution, I
introduced by Mr, Kepple of Los An- |
geles, was unanimously adopted: i
Perhaps the most important as weil a* the
most difficult duty cf a Board of Education
Is the selection of proper and efficient teach
ers. You may have elaborate courses of study
pr-pa vd by learned college professors or by
practical educators, you may have expensive
building*, fitted with modern improvements
and equipments, but unless you have good,
faithful end conscientious teachers you will
not i>Â« able to make a success of your educa
' tional work.
While this is important in all portions of
California, it is not so much so in districts
outsdc of San Francisco, where the mistakes
of appointment can be rectified at the opening
of the next school year by the failure to re
flect the teacher who has proved unsatis
factory, but In San Francisco it is of especial
importance, fcr here we have the life tenure'
'provision, which gives a teacher once elected
in the department a position for life. It \i a
good thing in this way: Teacher* should bf.
tree from the whims, caprices and personal
attacks of bc'ioo! directors. It has, however,
I understand, been somewhat criticized by
eome inurior teachers, who seem ' to think
that the result is not always as satisfactory
ss it should be. but I note that when we have
our annual examinations for teachers' posi
tions in this department we have numerous
Thoma5 P. Woodward's viftwa on the
law of tenu*' <â¢Â» applied to teachers
and his efforts to secure an Increased
annuity fund interested thv teachers
and they applauded many points in his
address. In part he spoke rs follows:
BOARD HAS ITS TROUBLES..
If you teach th^ee at all teach the local
cufctom of to-day, or, better still, leave the one
bey of your fchuo! who may in after life need
to "know these special things to learn them in
actual rrsctic* rather than give them to the
forty-nir.e who will never have use for them.
The" o'd idea of formal culture giving a dis
cipline which may be transferred to any occu
pation of later life does not accord with modern
thoupht and experience. Mental discipline may
be given by exorcise ur>on useful, up-to-date
thincr. We are ftill teaching English as
though It were an Inflected language. We are
posting the brains of children with subtle
distinctions fcund enly in the Latin grammar.
One-third the time now spent on grammar is
sufficient to teach all the thought relations
eyyntial to the use and appreciation of good
Knpllfh. Leave the subtleties of Latin to thÂ«
Latin teachers. Leave the erammar of eld
English to the college professor.
In the primary grades we have cut out a big
curve in the teaching of reading and now go
direct to the thought expressed by the words,
but we are forcing upon children literature be
yond their appreciation.' Many emotions must
Walt upon physical development. The love of
a youth for a maiden awakened too early be
comes sickly sentimentality. Rvangeiine and
Enoch Arden are no poems for children. Rob
inson Crusoe. Arabian Nights, even HUckle
beiry Finn, at a certain period In the life of
a boy are far better. The literature of exalted
emotion should not be put before -the minds
of children. More of nature, more of manual
training more of modern life, more of work
adapted to the child's environment might re
place the things that should be eliminated from
th*> vresent course of study.
In other lines of business there Is constant
striving for better plant, better equipment.
New Â»nd more expensive machinery Is con
tirually replacing the older and cheaper. Type
for the <Vi;!y newÂ«iÂ»r*T Is no longer set by
hard, but by the ingenious Mergcnthaler. The
elÂ»ctrir train Is fast supplanting the steam
car. \Y> r.eed more property constructed and
well furnifhed fcIjocI buildings, mor; beautiful
end attractive school rooms, more ample and
improved Â«rhool ground*, more attention to
rhysical education. These Increased school
facilities will cost money, but '- the business
world the most expensive equipment is usually
found to be the cheapest. It turns out the best
article; in the largest quantities.
WILIj ASK FOR MOKE MONEY.
I am pernuad'd that it !s my official duty to
ask the Stat" Lrrifdature at Its next session
to increase the State school tax rate from
$7 to $10 and to raise the minimum in the
counties from $S to *S per census child, and I
shall count uivni all friends of uubllc educa
tion, nil interested in the Industrial growth
of cur Stat<\ to Rive their earnest support to
advancement of these measures. The appeal
to local pride, to the tchool district alone, will
not answer, nor can the needed Increase, of
revenue bÂ» left wholly to the counties. The
call for more, money must be made upon the
three hai^ily blended sources of our school
revenue!*â the Stst*. the' county and the dis
trict. Those who would leave cut the State
overlook the fact that public education in the
Etate'ti business and that a State tax Is the
most tqultable. for it affects all portions
alike. I would suggest that In seeking this
change In the minimum of State and county
levy it *lso be enacted that not Gnly all
of the State fund as now, but at least "5 per
cent of fie oratiiy fund annually, b* devoted
to the payment of teachers' nalarie*. and that
the law be risM and exacting that school
bulldlr.g* an<5 Â«>tner equipment be supplied by
the local dlftnr:.
Shivering with cold and wrapped up
in furs and winter Jackets thj teachers
of San Francisco and members of the
California Teachers' Association sat
through the third day's session of the
annual institute in the Alhambra Thea
ter yesterday afternoon. The commit
tee of arrangements had forgotten to
have steam turned on and iho big play
house was cuite cold. Despite the dis
comfort the pedagogues enjoyed the
excellent programme. The singing by
the children from the grammar schools
has been, as it always will be, a feat
ure of the sessions. Splendid addresses
were delivered by Thomas P. Wood
ward, president of the San Francisco
Board of Education, and James A.
Foshay, city superintendent of Los
Angeles schools. As on the previous
day the lecture by Professor S. H.
Clark of the University of Chicago
proved very interesting.
The session opened with ringing by
the pupils of the eighth grades of the
Hamilton Grammar School, under the
direction of Miss Ida R. Strauss. The
boys and girls showed good training,
singing In perfect harmony. They ren
dered "Flow Gently, Swe?t Afton,"
'"My Love Is Like the Red, Red Rose"
and Metcalfs beautiful "Absent." The
assemblage was appreciative and ap
plauded the efforts of the pupils. The
demand was so great that ths young
sters rendered "Absent" a second time.
. FAVORS HIGHER SALARIES.
At the conclusion of the singing
President JSrlewine introduced Thomas
J. Kirk, State Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction, who .delivered an ad
dress on "The Output." Tha speaker
struck a responsive chord in the hearts
of his auditors when he said that
"teachers are the most poorly paid of
all public servants. Policeman and let
ter-carriers are better paid and have
permanency of employment." In part
he said:
Thr aim of the modern business world is to
produce the vcrv best goods at the least ex
pense or cutlay. To this end the manufacturer
is trying to secure better raw material, better
machtiK-rv and more skillful workmen. The
school rriuM take it? j>lace amonc. business
enterprises. It employs more capital and more
labor i nan any other vnc industry in the whole
country; vet it? methods are in many respects
antiquated, it? equipment is comparatively
l*>or and its workmen are often unskilled. We
cannot Improve the raw material; that we must
take as it comeg to hand. Just as furnished us
by nature. We must, therefore. Improve our
equipment and train our workmen.
Traveling cast through Nevada and Utah,
we find 'he railroad Is everywhere cutting out
rurvts and reduCthS Kradei*. The roatibed of
the seventies will not do for thÂ« Overland Lim
ited and the increasing traffic of to-day. In
education we are still traveling alone trails
made by the pioneers. The conrs? of etudy
is still encumbered with much that is useless.
We are *till teaching the spelling of apteryx.
caoutchouc and syzygy. We forset that the
child needs to learn only the words he will
probably have to use. Spelling iÂ« not a pre
requisite to readinp. We may read many
tverds that we cannot ipelL I recognize the
Governor wfct never 1 meet him. but I coulJ
not draw his picture. I recognize in reading
many wordy which I could not picture with

that- on December 22 of this year she
saw the launch afloat and abandoned
about 100 feet from shore and waded
in at the risk of her life until she
caught hold of the end of a line and
beached the launch, the value of which

While the case agreed upon by the
Board of State .Harbor Commissioners
and the" wholesale produce dealers of
this city to test the extent of the juris
diction of the Commissioners under the
Woodward law has been set by Judge
Sloss for January -8, counsel do not
think that the proceedings before Judge
Sloss will be final. The attorneys for
the Board of Harbor Commissioners
say that the Commissioners are deter
mined to have the law judicially de
fined, so that there may be no question
remaining relative to tWfe position of
the board. The question of the consti
tutionality of the law may be raised
by the interested parties in case the
decision" is^ against the produce men in
the case before Judge Sloss.
This case principally involves the
right of the Commissioners to with
draw permits that were granted upon
certain conditions, which the Commis
sioners say were violated by those
whose' permits have been taken away.
The issue of constitutionality, if it Is
to be raised, cannot well come up in
the case now before the court.
Prior to the setting of the date for
the case before Judge Sloss counsel for
the Harbor Commissioners moved for
dissolutions' of the temporary injunc- I
tlons that were granted in a number j
of cases. It is the intention of the j
Harbor Commissioners to press for dis
solution if counsel for the wholesale
produce men is not ready to go on in |
the case now considered acceptable as
a test of some phases of the law. The
reason for this is that the Commis
sioners wish to find out where they
stand legally and as soon as possible.
Mr. Reinstein says that his clients are
also anxious to have the matter de
cided.

NEWS OF THE OCEAX.
Delayed for several hours beyond her
schedule by head winds, the Oceanic
Steamship Company's liner Mariposa
arrived early yesterday morning from
Tahiti. Her cargo included 79,410 cocoa
nuts, 4146 sacks of copra and other
tropical products. She brought seven
teen passengers.
Captain Rennie spoke the British ship
Eurasia December 28 in latitude S0.35
north, longitude 126.57 west. The wind
jammer had lost her main yard and
main topsail yard, and evidently had
been pretty roughly handled since De
cember 13, when she left this port for
Queenstown. â¢ So serious was the ap
parent plight of the Britisher that Cap
tain Rennie changed his course and by
signals asked Captain Hughes of the
Eurasia if the liner could be of service
to the sailing ship. No notice, however,
was taken of the Mariposa's signals.
The offer of assistance was not even
acknowledged. This kind of discourtesy
is not common on the ocean highway,
and if Captain Hughes is not suffering
from tingling ears the comment on hia
conduct made yesterday at the Mer
chants' Exchange failed of its fabled
effect. As far as Captain Rennie could
judge the Eurasia is heading for Hono
lulu for repairs.
The Mariposa's passengers included
the following named: Mrs. M. Monler,
F. J. Pucher. H. J. Heiner. G. R. Rich
mond, F. Levy. L. L.e Gouellec, T. Love
land, Mrs. M. T. Chaffey, G. Chaffey
and T. E. Bunkley,' wife and two chil

Household utensils, such as dishes,

to be believed. He says Sara Rilcy, to

his head that at times renders his life
miserable. lie says she occasionally
varies the programme by throwing a
lamp or a clock at him. Once, he says
she stabbed him with a pair of scissors.
Dr. W. B. Estes. who was married to
Myrtle Estes in 1901, wants a divorce
because he is not allowed his liberty.
He alleges that on two occasions his
wife locked him in his room, and once
while they were living at the Winches
ter Hotel she had him removed by force
from his apartments and taken to a
private sanitarium. He says she also
interferes with his patients.
Suits for divorce were filed by Mar

Pears'
People have no idea how
crude and cruel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do.
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness and roughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it.
Pears' Soap has no free, al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds lo water instantly; wash-.
es and rinses off in a twinkling; is
as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.

"Although shipments of Hay have been un
usually light during the past week, yet they
are heavy enough to supply all -present de
mands. The total for the week ending to-day
amounts to but 1050 tcnÂ«. In comparison with
2250 tons for the preceding week. , Prices are
tinner, although no increase over the list given
last week can be. noted, > nor Is . one expected
until after January l. ; Business, as a rule,
lmproveB after the holidays are over, and now
that the ' Government order for Hay will be
placed here prices should have a strong up
ward tendency. A comparison of the bids sub
mitted here with those of the northern dealers
shows that we are from $4 to $7 per ton -lower
than they are. The bids of the San Francisco
dealers on No. 1 wheat Hay ranged from $17 to
?2l per ton, while those of the northern people
ranged from $21 on Puget Sound Hay to $28
en beet Washington timothy. The prices sub
mitted by the northern people confirm our be
lief that they have none too much Hay on hand
and that they will probably cail upon us again
for Hay, ns they did last season. Taking the
situation In Its entirety, we can see no reason
why Hay sljould net advance to what may be
considered eJitreme figures. ?
"Rain Is needpil In nearly all the Hay sec
tions at present and growers are beginning to
wonder If. we are to have a dry year. Grain
Is In a healthy condition, however, and It is
hoped that the needed showers will 'come soon
"Wheat Hay constitutes the bulk of the presl
ent arrivals, with tamo oat Hay and alfalfa
still in light demand."
Note â The bids for the Government order
mentioned in the above circular, represent
double compressed bales, which adds $3 per ton
to the regular price. . -

CHICAGO. Dec. 30.â An easier feeling was
manifested in the wheat pit at the start, owing
to easier cables, large receipts and a general
disposition on the part of local traders to take
profits. Considerable wheat came out the flrst
hour and the maiket became quite weak. May
declining to S3%c after opcnlnK %<HV t c lower
at 84@S4Hc. On rumors that the leading long
was buying freely many of the early eellera
turned buyers, and there were additional pur
chases to even up over the holidays. Sensa
tional war rumors were circulated and prices
advanced rapidly. May sold up to 84%c. A
reaction occurred during the last half hour,
but the close was firm, with May at 84*4c
War news furnished the lever for bulls in
the corn pit to boost prices a little higher. The
feature In trading was the selling of about a
quarter of .-. million buFhels of May by* a
prominent provision houne. Closing prices were
strong. May opened unchanged to %c higher,
closing lie higher at 45>ic.
Onts were easy. May closed a shade lower
at XS'ic.
Larse shipments of lard and meat, together
with the war rumors, were the Incentives that
caused n rood demand for provisions. There
was an unusually good demand for May v pork,
nnd that product led the list In the advance.
The close was strong with May pork showing
a train of 30@37Vic; lard and ribs were each
UP ]2";C.

will take out about 1000 boxes for Honolulu
which were purchased In this market. The
same steamer will take several thousand boxes
for the Antipodes, purchased in the growing
sections. Fancy Lemons were firmer under
light supplies and some well-known brands of
extra fancy commanded a small premium over
the quoted rates. Common stock was still
plentiful and continued dull. The other Citrus
fruits were without quotable change and more
or leas weak.- Stocks of Apples were very
heavy and the mnrket was exceedingly dull.
Eometblng unusual for this rime of the year,
when retailers ought to be stocking up for the
ex^ra requirements . on New Year's. Quinces
were offering freely, but were practically un
salable, while Ptars and Persimmons met with
a very light demand.

NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â There was a pro
nounced Vspositlon to take profits in to-day"s
sto-'k market, as was rather clearly fore
shadowrd by the action of the late market o.
t yesterday, but there was not lacking a fos
i tering i-arc of the market which held.it in
I chÂ»ck on thÂ» declines and nursed the recov
j eries. The opinion was thereby caused that
j while ;hc large interests behind the market
were disinclined to continue the advance in the
face of a stiff call money market they were by
; no means willing to relinquish the advanta
[ peous position **cured for lne year-end situa
tion. If it is true, as generally supposed, that
tho great banking groups, with thÂ»lr allied and
complex interests in the great trust companies,
the Insurance companies and in other financial
Institutions, have given a friendly countenance
Â¦ to the advance In prices to correct the dls
] cre;'anrle? from lrst year's showing In balance
j sheets, investments held, etc.. It would not
I agree witK those purposes to have the advances
I yielded on the very eve of the new year. The
! pinch In the money market was effective In
dislodging some speculative holdings In to
day's market, but the watchful guardianship
j was evidenced by the way in which Influential
I stocks were bid ud to hold prices. The Pa
! ciflcs and the United States steel stocks were
criHFpicuous examples. Some of the less promi
nent stocks which have enjoyed violent ad
...!â¢.. i s in me last few days were forced back <
with violence tn t^e day's realizing. The
closing was dull and heavy.
Bonds were active and easy. Total sales,
$2,140,000.
United States bends were weak.

Harrison's circular says:' "Since the sailing
of the steamship Ventura. December 10, there
have been ths following arrivals of coal from
Australia. vIje. : Ladas. 2200 tons; Kensington.
271'7 tonsi Thistle. 3&40 tons; Zinlta. 84Â» tons:
total. 5>4ia ton*. There are- seventeen vessels
Under engagement to carry coal from the colo
nies on the way and to lead, with a carrying
capacity of about 4H.00O tons; of. these there
are nine cargoes already afloat and a portipn
of these 'to load' will not leave for several
months yet. The quantity of Australian coal
now hÂ«re is very light, the major portion of
same being Richmond coal.* which Is being re
served for domestic uses only. Th# deliveries
of colonial coals at this port for the present
year will be over 50.000 tons In excess of 1902:
this has been brought about by the remission
of the duty on same of 67 cents per ton; as
the duty will probably b* renewed In 1904 the
outlook for an Increased importation Is dis
couraging and another serious drawback to an
'Increased Importation the coming year will be
a local demand in Australia for carriers to
move the large quantity of wheat just coming
In. If thÂ» colonial colliery proprietors solicit
a portion of the coal trade here they will be
forced to reduce their f. o. b. price at New
castle about one shilling per ton. Â¦ This will
be a necessity to men the competition that
will exist between the -British Columbia and
Australian coals In 1004."

Fine lots of Burbank Potatoes from Salinas
and Oregon continued to move freely ' nd
prices wera * well sustained. . Tha steamer dua
from Oregon to-day will bring about 5500 bags,
but as ' tha cargo brought by the last steamer
is pretty well cleaned out of flrst hands, it Is
not expected that prices will be any lower. Re
ceipts of River Burbank* . were moderate, and the
best Â«tock moved off well at steady rates. Poor
stock continued dull and supplies were still
Hccumulating. A carload of choice Sweets
came in and was firmly held at an advance,
but -sold slowly, owing to the abundance of
carried over stock, which was offering at easy
ratÂ«s. Onions were firm at the recently ad
vanced quotations. The receipts included a
carload of choice Oregon stock.
Los Angeles vegetables arrived freÂ«ly and
cholc* lots . of Peas and Summer Squash
brought higher prices. Quotations for Strlog
and Wax Ufa ns had a wide range, as- the of
ferings included much poor stock carried over
from the preceding day. ' Supplies of Tomatoes
were excessive and consisted , largely of old
stock, which was -hard to dispose of " even at
the minimum quotation. Fresh arrivals of
Green Peppers sold fairly at firmer prices, but
poor and old stock, which was still plentiful.

The wedding will occur early in the

The social science department of the
California Club appeared yesterday in
the role of hostesses 'to the inmates of
the County Hospital. There were no
elaborate decorations, nor swagger
gowns, nor ethereal music, but the re
ception was distinctly in keeping with
the spirit of the hour. And the music
given in the wards by the choir boys
of the Good Samaritan Mission was of
the kind that lifts up heartsâ and there
are hearts a-plenty that need it in the
city's home for Jts friendless sick.
Good things dear to the inner self
were distributed by the good ladles and
a -fine programme was rendered in the
chapel for the convalescents.

New-Year Dinner.
Aside from the local interest attach,
ing to the show, it compared favorably
in general artlstjc quality with any
professional minstrel organization that
has appeared in . San Francisco this
season.
' .The olio, consisted .of a whirlwind
dance by Ruth Wilson and Irma Roper,
a musical act by Regal and Driscoll, a
sketch by the Brittains, colored enter
tainers, and songs by Harold Forman,
the choir boy. Casassa's orchestra
furnished the overture and accompani
ments. â¢
In mercaRtllt circle* it It conÂ«ider#a
bad form to miss thÂ« "<3rnmtherÂ«'
show," as the annual minstrel enter
tainment given by Golden Gate Coun
cil No. SO, United Conunferrfal Travel
ers* Association, Is popularly Alluded to.
So it was not surprising to find the A1
hambra Theater flllÂ«d to its capacity
last evening by business tnen and thci*
women folk; nor was it cause for as
tonishment that the performance was
unanimously pronounced a "corker.*"
for most of the "gags'* rattled off by
the end men dealt with persons a.nd
things familiar to the audience,
William H. Brownâ he is better
known as "Billy/ although the come
dians FespectfulJy addressed him as
"Mistah Brown "âsat in the center oÂ£
thÂ£ first part semicircle and acted as
receiver general for badinage from the
eight burnt-cork artistsâ Billy Brack
ett, Billy Hobson, Sam Hall, Dave Fin-,
ney, Billy Hynes, Jack Einstein, Elton
Lambert and Tom Holden. Mr. Hob
son told of an imaginary train ride to
heaven, during which he mej many
well-known drummers and recognized
them by their ruling penchants, and his
fusillade of 3 "shots" kept the assem
blage in a roar. Mr. Brackett told some
adventures in which his friend McCarty
was the leading- figure. Mr. Lambert
got a laugh on the house by glancing
up at the gallery and saying, "Why, if
there ain't my old friend. Judge Mo
gan," and then yelling "Rubber!." when
the audience twisted its head around
to follow his gaze. Mr. Lambert re
peated the chorus of his song, "Many
Rags," so ; many times that when he
was finally permitted to desist his
breath was spent and perspiration was
washing the blackness from his coun
tenance.'- Sam Hall's "Rain Song" won
a double, encore.
â¢ Billy Hynes, whose final appearance
as a public entertainer it was, sang his
famous laughing song thrice over after
he had already contributed three vocal
numbers to the programme. Mr. Eln
stein sang i "Dat's de Way to Spell
Chicken," and a large basket of se
lected vegetables was one of the trib
utes handed to him over the footlights.
There were sentimental songs, of
course, and all of them were well sung.
W. H. , Brown and Carl L. Koening
sang bass solos, tenor solos were given
by Harry B. Smith and Fred Everett,
F. J. Glanninl and F. B. Wade contrib
uted barytone solos, and the Columbia

Iightful Ttienuâ all these and more verc j
pleasing factors In the very successful j
luncheon given at the University C!Â«b I
"o-flay by Mrs. John Charles Adams j
of Oakland. It was complimentary to |
M:"f J Malcolm Henry of Washing
ton, D. J., who is spending the -winter
with relatives in this city.
Considerable <>riginality waÂ§ display
ed in Lhe deco-atlons, which carried
out the idea o* a circus as far as pos
sible Red and white streamers were
festooned from the jenter of the cell
ing in tentlike lashior and in the mural
decoration grotesque masks and gaudy
t'.n horns played their part. \n the
center of each table toy drums r rough
riders, ballet dancers arii wild animalr
were grouped and were Jatev' carried
away \j> the guests as souvenirs of the
occasion.
A vaudeville programme between
courses prevented anj* tendency toward
ennui and orchestral music gave a
pleasing support to the constant mur
mur of feminine voices. Miss Jean Lo
gan, society's favorite dancer, appeared'
in two graceful delsarte dances, 'in one
of which she wore a Greek costume
and in the other a Japanese kimona.
The musical end of the programme was
supplied by a quartet of male voices
in a number of popular selections.
Just before the ladies left the. tables
confetti was passed around by Mrs.
Adams' beautiful little daughter, Vere
de Vere Adams, and showered upon the
guest of honor with, good wishes for
the Xew Year.
Mrs. Henry is a large woman of the
very pronounced blonde, type, just the
opposite of her hostess, who is petite
and dark. Mrs. Henry wore a hand
some : white lace gown with a large
toque of white tulle.
Mrs. Adams â¢ resembles Mrs. Pat
Campbell somewhat and the resem
blance is increased by the long cling
ing gowns she affects, and which are
always designed by herself. Her dress
yesterday was of some soft, blue, filmy
stuff, ornamented with pearl embroid
ered butterflies, and a wreath of flow
era was twisted through her dark hair.
Miss Lulu Bothin, one of the season's
debutantes, was an attractive figure
at the luncheon in a dainty white chif
fon gown and hat and her hair a la
Peggy O'Neill. Miss Katherine Dillon
wore a becoming and exquisite white
lace gown. Mrs. Clarence Mann wore
over her reception gown a long coat
that was the envy of everybody.
It was of heavy greenâ a real
grass greenâ silk and the deep collars
were appllqued with Persian embroid
ery. A beautiful long green plume al
most covered her flat modish hat- An
other striking feature of Mrs. Mann's
costume was the large hoop rings she
wore, a' style now becoming very pop
ular in Paris.
Mrs. William Sesnon was also a guest
a-nd charmingly gowned,: her famous
collar and belt of cameos attracting
much attention.

The winter picnic of Mrs. Bowie-Die
trick's planning was voted a tremend
ous success on Tuesday night. The
house became a woodland glen for the
hour, December became May, and. the
fun that reigned was that of May time.
Games. hardly, commensurate with dig
nity, but highly productive of fun, were
played, the "festive board" Was done
away with and with it the dignities of
evening j dress. The men . forsook their
"spikes" and the maids their frumperies
for the joyous freedom of picnic attire,
which greatly facilitated their squat
ting in a picnic fashion upon the erst
while grassy glade.
More of these functions would' soon
render stupidity in society a thing to
be shunned.
Mrs. E. A. Trefethen entertained a
number of friends "at luncheon to-day,
at which the pleasant announcement

yesterday in honor of the much-feted
bride-to-be. Miss Bernie Drown. Was

Drown has been? And that in spite of
the unfortunate mishap to her mother,
which necessarily forestalled many
functions. The rooms were made beau
tiful by the prodigal use of pink roses
and feathery' greens. Miss Drown, after
the manner of the season, wore white.
Mrs. Boardman, the hostess,, appeared
in a stunning gown of black velvet.
About COO guests called, sipped tea and
exchanged greetings for the coming
year. The following iadies assisted in
receiving: Mrs. Chauncey Boardman
and Mrs. Danforth Boardman, daugh

producing an effect altogether coseate.
The guest of the hour was Miss Flor

The long expected row over the es
tate of the late millionaire politician,
Thomas J. Clunie, ' has materialized.
Yesterday in the Probate Court Mrs.
Florence Clunie, widow 'of the deceased
Congressman; created a sensation by
opposing the petition for partial dis
tribution of the estate by Andrew J.
Clunie, her brother-in-law, and by an
nouncing that she intended to ignore
her husband's will and claim half of
the estate under the law governing
community property. If she carries out
her Intentions and succeeds in show
ing that the estate of Clunie wag ac
quired after her marriage to him she
will receive $500,000, instead of the real
ty valued at about $200,000 bequeathed
to her in the will.
At the hearing of Clunie's petition
yesterday it was shown that the estate,
which was appraised at 11,017.000, was
In excellent condition. With the excep
tion of debts amounting: to $5000, not
yet due, all debts have been paid and
a comfortable surplus is in the hands
of the executors of Clunie's will. The
estate is in distributive shape, accord
ing to the executors, and they have
certified that they are willing to turn
over to the heirs of the Congressman
such portions of the estate as were de
vised to them. If this were done An
drew J. Clunie would receive the ware
house property in Sacramento, "Jack"
â¢Jlaring-Clunie, the adopted son of the
deceased, or the executors of the wi!l.
as his trustee?, would receive the Clunie
building at the corner of California ;*nd
Montgomery streets, nnd the wJdow
would;' receive the realty i> Sacramento
anjlitiilS city* devised 'u> her. The ex
ecutors of the will as trustees to: the
â¢jhildr^n ot Andrew CJunie would also
receive certain pieces n? realty left
them by their uncl*.
E. A. Britlgford, B. G; "White and An
drew J. Clunie are the executors of the
wiU. They are alsr. trustees !or "Jack"
Olaring-OIunie and th<Â» nieces an<i
nephews of the decedent. They hope
t.Â« convince the court that the widow,
in the Â»ivent Jhat she elects to make
Her claim for half -n th.* estate. Is not
entitled to more thf*n the shary Revise'!
her h: t!ie will. They say that the
Clunie i* not community jrop
?Tty; that it was acauir^d by Jhe poli
tician prior io Jiis marriage.- They so
testified yesterday.
Mrs. Clunie. aiso Jioiies to show thÂ»t
she is entitled to-more of th* estate
than the will gives *.er because of the
existence of a large amount of per
sonal property discovered by the *>xecu
<ors and, as she claims, not reported In
the Inventory.
The petition will be given a further
hearing next Tuesday.
