Captain Manning said tonight that he
could have proceeded witlj^the rest of the

that the Massachusetts could be dry

Sir, Charles Dllke seconded Robertson's
amendment. His only objection to the

he said, was that it was a bargain by. the
British Government with foreigners. The

The southeastern portion of the Island
has been practically denuded of its crops,
the rivers are flooded and many men
were carried out to sea and drowned.
Considering the damage to- property dur
ing the hurricane, the loss of life was
comparatively small, though the present
estimate now is that the death list will
reach fifty. Hundreds of persons were
Injured and there were numerous hair
breadth escapes. The property loss is
estimated at $10,000,000.
The Norwegian steamer Salvatore dl
Giorgy was driven ashore at Annotta Bay
and lies in a dangerous position. Several
sailing vessels were wrecked on the north
side. It Is still stormy and threatening
and there are fears that there may be
a renewal/ of the storm.
Thousands of houses In Kingston were
damaged, the wharves were battered and'
several coasting vessels were sunk in
the harbor. Trade is practically at a
standstill. - '
The western end of the Island, which
it w*as at first supposed had escaped, also
suffered considerably. New banana plan
tations planted there were partly de
frayed-&nd the orange v anu coffee crops
were also injured.
The entire eastern end of the Island has
been devastated. Villages have .been
wiped out and public buildings and
churches destroyed. Thousands of the
peasantry were rendered homeless and
destitute and 'are wandering about seek
ing food and shelter. The destruction of
the banana plantations has been com
plete and the fruit trade is paralyzed for
the next -twelve months. Hundreds of
prosperous fruit growers liave been
brought to bankruptcy and ruin.
KINGSTON. Jamaica. Aug. 12.â The ef
fects of, the hurricane upon the island
of Jamaica were greater than at first be
lieved. Port Antonio, on the north coast,
was completely overwhelmed. Only six
houses were left standing there. The
United Fruit Company's wharves, offices,
hotel and plantations were utterly de
molished. Five of the company's steam
ers, including: the Simon Dunois, Alfred
Dunols and Brighton, were driven ashore,
but are lying-in easy positions. Port Ma
ria, another town on the north coast, also
suffered similarly. The coast is strewn
with wreckage of local sailing vessels.
It Is feared that the loss of life, has
been heavy, thirty fatalities having al
ready been reported, principally among
seamen.
ERIE, Pa., Aug. 12.â The Silver Spray,
a fishing boat owned here, came into
port this afternoon in a badl^r shattered
condition, owing to an encounter in mid
lake at about noon with the Canadian
revenue cutter Petrel.
The Canadian authorities have (or years
had trouble with American . fishermen
poaching on the Canadian 1 side of the
lake, and the Petrel is kept constantly on
the lookout for them. At noon she came
upon the Silver Spray on the Canadian
side of the lake, and at once ordered Cap
tain Chris Chau to stop. I The Petrel is a
strong steel craft and, it is said, attempt
ed to ram the American-boat before she
could comply with the order to stop. Cap
tain Chau decided to attempt to escape,
and started ahead at full speed.
The Petrel then oDened fire with all of
her guns and about twenty shots struck
the Silver Spray. Two shots struck the
pilot-house in which Captain Chau stood
at the wheel. One came' within a few
inches of Chau, scattering a myriad of
splinters around his' head. ; ..
That no one was killed is remarkable,
as two shots struck the cabin, two the
roof, three "the after hurricane deck, and
the others various parts of * the boat.
The chase was kept up for osme time,
but when Captain Chau got across the
boundary line the Petrel gave up the
pursuit." j â¢*

In an elaborate address * to-day at' 1 * the
Chautauqua Assembly on lynchings and
mobs, from an American standpoint. Dr.
Babbitt's address was the chief one of
to-day on mobs. He contrasted the view
of lynching justified by Graves with what
he called the "more general and the bet
ter view of the American nation," and
showed the prevalence and increasing vio
lence of the mob spirit, its tendency to
leap the color line and lynch for minor
offenses than for rape and murder. He
dwelt on the phraseology of the mob and
gave the Wilmington lynching of the ne
gro. White, as typical and denounced the
officials who refused to protect any pris
oner of any color or for/ any crime. He
paid a glowing: tribute to order and .law
as represented in Governor Durbln and
Governor Yates of Indiana and Illinois,
respectively, and upheld President Roose
velt in his r'ecent letter on lynchings.
Ly.nchers, the speaker \ declared,, "were

LONDON, Aug. 12.â A dispatch from
the British Consul General at Odessa tor-
I warding the report made by the_ British
! Consul, V. Bosanquet, ovho was sent spe
j dally to Kishenev to obtain the/facts re
; carding the recent anti-Jewish riots there,
j is published to-day.
Bosanquefs report, which is dated July
i 26. generally agreed; with the stories of
! the occurrences cabled to the Associated
! Press. It says:
The ar*a of â¢ the disturbunefs comprisfd two
' lhirdÂ« of th* town of Ktshenev. Ttie murderfc
\ ai\ occurred on MiÂ»nÂ«iay. the second day of ths
' disturbances. Thfy were precipitated by bands
' of rioters In <ilff<rent pane of the town. Many
i believed they were the work of organized
; comiMinics. which fact aij?u>s In favor of a
i jTearranstd conspiracy to exterminate the
1 Jews. If this belief it not accepted, the riots
must be attributed to the articles in the I5es
earabeiz. the anti-Semitic ortan-In KUhenev.
I to the unfounded report of the Jewish murder
of a Christian priest, to the wine drunk .early
on M> inlay ami to the belief which seÂ«ms to
have grown witn the continued Inaction of thfe'
authorities that the latter wished the Jews ip
be massacred cr had even expected It. Ai>-
I>ar*-ntly, a feeling existed among the lower
eUfStS'.tfeat the Jews oUfht not tu be in â¢ the
rnajcrity lit Kishenev. .
The local authorities tock no effective istep
to stop the riote. The soldiers were passive
if not sympathetic spectators. The police con
tented themselves with the arrest of minor
criminals until 4 o'clock j In the afternoon,
when the Governor, who had remained at
hume, telephoning ordeis which were disre
garded, at length ventured to eign the reces
rary order for the troops to be employed. The
one ca*e I heard of in which .the latter used
their weapons was when they bayoneted a
Christian who w-as pursuing a Jew with stones.
This boy was th? only Christian killed during
the disturbances. If resolute action had been
taken by the authorities 1 believe the riots
wuuld have been checked at an early stage.
Bosanquet places the Jewish victims at
forty-one killed and thirty wounded, while
among the Christians one was killed and
twenty-eight wounded. Inquiries show, he
said, that three women were violated, but
this may well represent a small fraction
of the actual number, since the Jewish
women naturally remain silent for their
own Â£akes, as under the Mosaic law di
vorce must follow violation. The Vice
Consul heard of the assault of a girl 12
years old and- of others aged 13. but this
was only hearsay. Mutilation and delib
erate torture of the victims, he said, does
not seem to have been practiced. Thougrh
there were undoubtedly great barbarities,
he only knows of one ca?e of mutilation,
when a man's eye was put out with a
nail. He iuard stories of mutilation after
death and of a child being torn limb
from limb, but he considers the latter
story to be very improbable considering
that only two little children appear to
have perished. Bosanquet pays a tribute
to Prince Urusoff, the new Governor of
Bessarabia, who, he says, helped him
with every means in his power. The
Vice Consul adds:
On the arrival of the new Governor, who Is
doing all he can to gain the confidence of the.
Jewish population, matters began to improve"
and the commercial life of the town was re
sumed. A newcomer visiting. the Jewish quar
ter can Â»ee no signs of a stoppage of business.
an'i it is hoped that Jewish commercial affairs
are In a fair way to regain their prosperity,
though they have not yet entirely recovered.
The Jew* place their lotses at 2.000.C00 rubles,
but thin figure is probably an exaggeration:
About SSO rioters were arrested and 306 were
punished on minor charges, while 216 were
acquitted. Three hundred and sixty rioters
will be tried at Tiraupol in October, of which
number 100 are charged with murder in addi
tion to other crime*. If they are found guilty
they will be sentenced to penal servitude on
the island of Sakhalin. ' Â¦

Â» This is the proposition : You want to fur-
nish a home. You haven't enough ready cash
to pay in full when the goods are delivered,
jencc you're compelled to buy "on time." Yet
you dislike trading in an out-and-out install-
, , ment store. How are you going to get the
easy - payment accommodation and still buy
your goods in one of the big first-class stores?
We offer you the way.
We loan you the money, charging simply
the regular banking rate ol interest â six per
cent. You 'go then to one of the big,- first-
class furniture stores where the stock is big
and fresh, and where satisfaction is certain ;
and when you have made your selections pay
your bill in good, hard cash. .
The installment stores charge you ten per
cent above their cash prices for time. All you
pay us is six per cent. The actual saving to
you is FOUR PER CENT.
For instance:/ If your purchases amount to
; $100.00 we ywill charge you $106.00 â which is a
six per cent advance; then you pay us $20.00
cash and the balance in monthly payments
amounting to $8.60 each month. If your pur-
chases amount to $75.06 we will charge you
$79.50; you make us a cash payment on this

Major General MacArthur has ordered
that First Sergeant Marlln C. Jones be
released from the Presidio guardhouse,
where he was confined on a charge of
securing money from other enlisted men
as pay for not enforcing the regulations.
Jones is a member of the Seventieth
Company. Coast Artillery, and has a
reputation for being very strict with his
subordinates.
Some time ago several of the company
men complained that the first sergeant
was getting a rake-ott from all gambling
gameÂ« and was selling excuses rrom
duty. Major Hobbs Investigated the mat
ter and a court-martial was ordered. Cap
tain Burgess and Lieutenant Lewis, both
of the Artillery Corps, were chosen re
spectively president and Judge ' advocate
of the court. The witnesses called by
both sides numbered more than a score
and tbe testimony of the defense and the
prosecution was largely contradictory.
Jones was convicted by the court, but
General MacArthur deems the evidence
insufficient and directs that the prisoner
be allowed to go free.

Mrs. Bailey iraÂ» found unconscious In
her room yesterday at 1 o'clock and taken

hours later.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â Mrs. jessle
Bailey, a waitress, died yesterday sfter
r.oon at the Emergency Hospital after
fcÂ«A-s>re,l doctors had worked over her for
hours and It was announced that her
death had resulted from morphine polson-
Injr. It was seemingly a plain case of
BUlclfl*. although no known motive exist
ed. A* a result of an autopsy made to-
Cay evlCence was discovered which lnSl
cates that the woman may have been
murdered end until the chemical analysis
of the stcrriach and intestines of the de
eeaeed Js completed It will not be known
whether ehe took poison. The discovery
was made by accident at an undertaking
establishment, the undertaker finding
that the weman had & broken rib.
When Ceroner Trout was notified he or
dered an autopsy, which showed that
thre* of the woman's ribs were broken
end that death had resulted from paraly
e!s cf the^heart, in the opinion of the au
topsy surgeon, caused by a' heavy blow
over the heart. The fact that there was
no cxtrrior bruise over the broken ribs
has caused the authorities to hesitate
ebout accepting the murder theory, for it
Is possible that the ribs might have &Â«Â«n
fractured at the hospital, where several
physicians applied artificial respiration to
the woman for nearly five hours, think
ing she had taken morphine. In this
wcrk she may have been roughly handled,
as is frequently done to restore the spark
cf life to a poisoned person. .The hospital
physicians knew. nothing about the fiac
tÂ»red ribs until notified by the Coroner.
The detectives have taken Into custody
a man named Weber, who will be held
until the case is investigated. He is
known to have spent Tuesday night in the
Â«OTEan'Â» room and to have been friendly
â¢with her for months. He has admitted
having seen her with another man. who,
et sight of him. left her. The officers be
lieve that Weber may have quarreled
with the woman and struck her a violent
blow ever the heart with his fist, but he
denies this, although he practically ad
mits that they quarreled. He thinks she
tock poison following the quarrel. The
puzzling feature about the case is the ab
sence of any bruise on the body.
'Dr. G. W. Campbell, former Coroner,
who performed the autopsy, declared to
r.ipht that the woman's nb= had been
fractured by a blow and that that blow
killed her. He asserts that she was mur
dered, but he has ordered an analysis of
the digestive organs to discover if possi
ble whether poison was taken by the
woman.

Greeks Join the Macedonians.
SOFIA, Aug. 12.â Representatives of the
Macedonian committee- say that the Rou

ber of villages have joined the insurgents
and that the Mohammedans are taking
refuge in the cities and towns. At Kru
shevo the revolutionists, have seized the
repeating rifles and ammunition stored in
the magazine. It is stated that Prince
Ferdinand will spend next Saturday, the
anniversary of his accession to the throne,

Bulgarian. Officials Expect Fanatical
Bising Against Christians.
SALONICA. Aug. 12.â It is reported that
! the Turkish troops on Monday bombarded
and destroyed the village of Eshiu, twen
ty miles south of Monastir.
According to another rumor the Insur
gents who have occupied Krushevo, after
repulsing two assaults by the Turkish
troops, offered a conditional surrender.
Instructions were asked for from Con
stantinople and in reply the Turkish com
mander received orders to give no quar
ter.
The bridge at Gievgveli, on the Uskub-
S&lonica Railway, which was blown up
by the insurgents, has been repaired.
Several strong bands"rÂ«:ently crossed the
frontier of Eastern Macedonia.
The whole Bulgarian Government takes
a decidedly pessimistic view of the situa
tion and the officials openly express their
fears that, a general massacre of^ the
.Christians in Macedonia is inevitable, pos
'sibly within four, days, and almost cer
tainly within a fortnight. Meanwhile the
Government continues to maintain, its
peaceful attitude, but It believes that a
sudden development e-f affairs across the
border may at any moment render the
authorities powerless to prevent war.
The reports from Bulgarian official
agents in Macedonia show that the sit
uation is rapidly growing worse. The
fact that the Mussulmans are becoming
excited and congregating in the mosques
is regarded as an additional feature In
dicating the possibility that a massacre
may occur within a short time. It is
feared that such a massacre would cover
a wide area and include both the large
towns and the villages, and that the i
Turkish soldiers would prove incapable j
of restraining the Mussulmans, even if j
they desired to do so, which Is by no I
means certain. . % ;
Monastir bowj contains only four battal- j
ions of Turkish" troops, two consisting of |
raw recruits, who will be quite unreli- i
able in~the event of serious trouble. It!
is thought quite possible that the troops â¢
might even aid the : Mussulmans in I
slaughtering the Christians.
The officials here blame Turkey for the
present sudden outbreak, attributing it
largely to the action of the Porte in in
stituting a search for arms In the vil
lages. - i .-' '''â¢;"â¢
Dr. Mandelstam. the acting Russian
Consul at Uskub, who has been appointed
to succeed M. Rostkovowskl, the mur
dered Consul at Monastir, reached that
town to-day. Some anxiety had been felt
tor his safety, as nothlns had been heard
of him since he left his post at Uskub a
couple of days ago. The Mutesarif of the
Uskub district refused to give Dr. Man
delstam an escort. The Consul Insisted
en proceeding to his. new post and, hav
ing obtained an escort from Hilmi Pasha,
he started on. his own rsponslbllity across
country for Monastir.
FEAB GENERAL MASSACKE.
Tho most astonishing feature of the sit
uation here is the remarkable quietude
with which the people have received the
news of .the fresh rioting In Macedonia.
The whole outbreak came as a great sur
prise, even to the local revolutionary
committees, which were not prepared for
so early a rising. In spite of the stir
ring appeals of the committees, little or
no popular enthusiasm is apparent, not
even among the 30.000 Macedonian resi
dents, of Sofia.
How long this condition will last de
pends largely upon the developments in
Macedonia. At present the center of the
disturbance is Monastir. a long way' off.
Should the rising spread to the vilayet
of Uskub and come near to the Bulgarian
frontier It is probable that tnÂ«"population
of -Bulgaria will become aroused.
The Government also charges Turkey
â¢with doing less to prevent the insurgents
crossing the frontier than Bulgaria,
though Turkey maintain* four times as
many troops a".ong the border. The
Turkish soldiers Invariably retire to bar
racks at sunset ar.d remain there until
sunrise, leaving free egress to the Mace
donian insurgents during: 'the night. The
Turks fight bravely during -daylight, but
dislike skirmishing in the dark.
It is everywhere declared that the pres
ent Ministry in doing Its utmost to check
the revolutionary movement, but the; sit
uation 13 reaching B point where circum
stances may prove too strong for tho Cab
inet. The grcvTlnir economic depression in
the country constitutes a dangerous fac
tor in the situation.
Sofia Government Says Powers Alone
Can Prevent Disaster.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Aug. 12.â The Bul
garian Foreign Office has received very
disquieting news from Its agent at
Uskub. The Mussulmans there are daily
gathering In the mosques and it is feared
that a massacre of the Chris^tjans Is Im
pending. Officials here express the be
lief that the intervention of the powers
alone can prevent a disaster. -
HOPES FOE INTEBVENTION.
The insurgents continue to devastate
the district of Koritza and have captured
Important Turkish supplies of provisions.
More or less severe fighting Is reported
In the districts of Kastoria and Fiorina.
Three hundred insurgents are assembled
on the heights between Gievgvell and
Yenije. Twenty-six Mussulman peasants
have been massacred In the village of
Ziverninl. near Perlepe. \ by â¢ the insur
gents. Stringent military Â¦ â¢. precautions
have been taken in the town of Uskub to
prevent threatened dynamite outrages.

Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â Furiously
driving across the country for four long
hours, gazing into a loaded revolver held
in the trembling hands of a drink-crazed
maniac, living through a thousand hells,
and not daring to speak. Isaac H. Bry
son, son of former Mayor Bryson, had an
experience which he" says aged him sev
eral years and almost made his hair turn
white.
Bryson was induced by Alexander
Fountains last week to financially assist
him in the development of a mine near
Plute, in Kern County. He agreed to In
vest ln the property when Fouritalne dis
played assayer's reports showing that
the mine produced ore worth $500 a ton
Bryson wanted to see the mine and Sat
urday they started out overland. At
Caliente, *'ountalne, who frequently
asked Bryson whether he had tho money
with him, began drinking. They started
out and after driving for four hours Bry
son started to turn the team, saying he
was going back. Fountalne at once
pressed a revolver against his head and
ordered him to drive on. They drove four
hours longer, Fountalne frequently
threatening Bryson with death
Finally they came to. a small stream
and Bryson was permitted to get a drink
While he was drinking, still covered bv
the revolver, the team became frightened
and as Fountalne had to attend to the
horses Bryson darted into the brush and
made his escape. He walked back to
Plute. journeying all night, and sent offl-

The indications are that William D.
English, vice president and manager of
the Contra Costa "Water Company aad
former secretary- of the State Harbor
Commission, will pass away before' cany
hours. The slight rally of Tuesday gave
place to a relapse this evening, and it Is
not thought that Mr. English can survive
long. Recovery under the present condi
tions would be nothing short of miracu
lous. There was a noticeable slaking tt*.
day and this evening, with pulse extreme

The physicians In attendance would t>Â»
pleased to see a rising temperature rather
than the sub-normal, or at best noraal
condition.
There is practically no consciousness,

aro Incoherent and rambling. Only under
the greatest effort can he be brought Into
a state where his remarks are Intelligi
ble.
Dr. D. D. Crowley to-night gave out t!i9
following statement as to Mr. English'
condition:
"Mr. English Is not better this evenin*
He 13 not markedly worse. At this spe

he has much to overcome. \ The patient is
weak and his speech is rambling, but a'
times he can be aroused and speech t *- 1

Thrilling Experience of
Isaac H. Bryson of
Los
CINCINNATI, Aug. 12.â The Democratic
convention of Hamilton County selected
forty-two delegates to the State conven
tion. A majority of these delegates, favor
John L.- Zimmerman for Governor as
against Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleve
land. .
Forty delegates who held a second con
vention this afternoon after the Demo
cratic convention of Hamilton County had
adjourned have called a public meeting at
G. A. R. Hall for next Friday night. One
object of the meeting is to protest against
the leadership of Lewis G. Bernard, who
is charged with controlling the local or
ganization through an alliance with
George B. Cox, the local Republican
leader. The dissenting delegates at their
convention this afternoon appointed - a
committee, with Rev. Herbert S. Blgelow
chairman, to report on a plan for bring
ing the contests of Hamilton County be
fore the Democratic State Central Com
mittee and the State convention, and this
convention will report at the opening of
the mass meeting on Friday night.
Among the seats in the State convention
to bo contested is that of Melville E. In
galls. who is prominently mentioned for
Senatorial Indorsement. .The local faction
headed by Bernard represents those fa
vorable for Zimmerman for Governor, and
the faction headed by Blgelow represents
those favorable to Mayor Johnson.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â Dr. George A.
Dorsey, curator of anthropology of the
Field Columbian Museum of Chicago, who
has just arrived here, has given out an
Interview concerning the published ac
counts of his recent visit with Dr.
Mooney to the Cheyenne Indians in 'Okla
homa. - Dr. Dorsey characterizes as false
the statement .that the. scientists encour
aged tbe Indians to self-torture during
their sun dance by a monetary consid
eration and contends- that the barbaric
ceremonial is religion to the Indians and
that they have a right to celebrate it
under the clause of tho constitution
granting American citizens freedom of
worship. .
With, regard .to statements made to the
Indian Bureau at Washington by Super
intendent Seger of the Reservation School
Dr. Dorsey makes charges of duplicity
and ignorance and states that Seger's al
legations were not â¢ disinterested. He
says: ' *
"Concerning the torture itself, which
Mr. Seger describes, not only did Dr.
Mooney and myself not instigate it, but
we actually knew nothing about it until
the Indian was well on his way making
his rounds of the camp circle. This tor
ture occurred, by the way. on the morn
ing following the final rites of the cere
mony and had nothing to do with the
performance of the so-called sun # dance."

line until next Monday. Other delega
tions are arriving in town constantly. On
Tuesday' over 700 arrived from different
parts. Yesterday 779 Grand Army passen

Next Saturday afternoon Major General
W. R. Shafter, -Department Commander
of the Grand Army; General George
Stone, chairman of the general committee
of management, together with members
of the executive committee of tho Thirty
seventh-National Encampment, will go to
Point Richmond to meet the incoming
commauder-in-chlff. General Thomas J.
Stewart of Pennsylvania, and escort him
to national headquarters in the PalacÂ©
Hotel. Among the distinguished comrades
at present In San Francisco is General
Beaver, former Governor of Pennsylvania.
There is an undercurrent of gossip in
Grand Army circles that General Nelson
A. Miles, who is on his way to the en
campment, may enter the .contest for
commander-ln-chlef to succeed General
Stewart. A contest between'General Black
of Illinois and General Miles* for the first
place in the Grand Army would develop
considerable interest. '
FRESNO. Aug. 12.-An ultimatum : has
been issued to the raisin growers. The
directors of the Raisin Growers' Asso

statement for publication, in which they
state that they have come to the ' end
of their resources, and under these cir
cumstances and in order to stop. a use
less expenditure of '"time and. funds they
have resolved to medt on Tuesday, Sep

turned and the offices closed.
In addition to the above the statement
declares: .. .
The director*. In publishing 1 the resolution,

Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â Furiously
driving across the country for four long
hours, gazing into a loaded revolver held
in the trembling hands of a drink-crazed
maniac, living through a thousand hells,
and not daring to speak. Isaac H. Bry
son, son of former Mayor Bryson, had an
experience which he" says aged him sev
eral years and almost made his hair turn
white.
Bryson was induced by Alexander
Fountains last week to financially assist
him in the development of a mine near
Plute, in Kern County. He agreed to In
vest ln the property when Fouritalne dis
played assayer's reports showing that
the mine produced ore worth $500 a ton
Bryson wanted to see the mine and Sat
urday they started out overland. At
Caliente, *'ountalne, who frequently
asked Bryson whether he had tho money
with him, began drinking. They started
out and after driving for four hours Bry
son started to turn the team, saying he
was going back. Fountalne at once
pressed a revolver against his head and
ordered him to drive on. They drove four
hours longer, Fountalne frequently
threatening Bryson with death
Finally they came to. a small stream
and Bryson was permitted to get a drink
While he was drinking, still covered bv
the revolver, the team became frightened
and as Fountalne had to attend to the
horses Bryson darted into the brush and
made his escape. He walked back to
Plute. journeying all night, and sent offl-

The indications are that William D.
English, vice president and manager of
the Contra Costa "Water Company aad
former secretary- of the State Harbor
Commission, will pass away before' cany
hours. The slight rally of Tuesday gave
place to a relapse this evening, and it Is
not thought that Mr. English can survive
long. Recovery under the present condi
tions would be nothing short of miracu
lous. There was a noticeable slaking tt*.
day and this evening, with pulse extreme

The physicians In attendance would t>Â»
pleased to see a rising temperature rather
than the sub-normal, or at best noraal
condition.
There is practically no consciousness,

aro Incoherent and rambling. Only under
the greatest effort can he be brought Into
a state where his remarks are Intelligi
ble.
Dr. D. D. Crowley to-night gave out t!i9
following statement as to Mr. English'
condition:
"Mr. English Is not better this evenin*
He 13 not markedly worse. At this spe

he has much to overcome. \ The patient is
weak and his speech is rambling, but a'

Los
CINCINNATI, Aug. 12.â The Democratic
convention of Hamilton County selected
forty-two delegates to the State conven
tion. A majority of these delegates, favor
John L.- Zimmerman for Governor as
against Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleve
land. .
Forty delegates who held a second con
vention this afternoon after the Demo
cratic convention of Hamilton County had
adjourned have called a public meeting at
G. A. R. Hall for next Friday night. One
object of the meeting is to protest against
the leadership of Lewis G. Bernard, who
is charged with controlling the local or
ganization through an alliance with
George B. Cox, the local Republican
leader. The dissenting delegates at their
convention this afternoon appointed - a
committee, with Rev. Herbert S. Blgelow
chairman, to report on a plan for bring
ing the contests of Hamilton County be
fore the Democratic State Central Com
mittee and the State convention, and this
convention will report at the opening of
the mass meeting on Friday night.
Among the seats in the State convention
to bo contested is that of Melville E. In
galls. who is prominently mentioned for
Senatorial Indorsement. .The local faction
headed by Bernard represents those fa
vorable for Zimmerman for Governor, and
the faction headed by Blgelow represents
those favorable to Mayor Johnson.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â Dr. George A.
Dorsey, curator of anthropology of the
Field Columbian Museum of Chicago, who
has just arrived here, has given out an
Interview concerning the published ac
counts of his recent visit with Dr.
Mooney to the Cheyenne Indians in 'Okla
homa. - Dr. Dorsey characterizes as false
the statement .that the. scientists encour
aged tbe Indians to self-torture during
their sun dance by a monetary consid
eration and contends- that the barbaric
ceremonial is religion to the Indians and
that they have a right to celebrate it
under the clause of tho constitution
granting American citizens freedom of
worship. .
With, regard .to statements made to the
Indian Bureau at Washington by Super
intendent Seger of the Reservation School
Dr. Dorsey makes charges of duplicity
and ignorance and states that Seger's al
legations were not â¢ disinterested. He
says: ' *
"Concerning the torture itself, which
Mr. Seger describes, not only did Dr.
Mooney and myself not instigate it, but
we actually knew nothing about it until
the Indian was well on his way making
his rounds of the camp circle. This tor
ture occurred, by the way. on the morn
ing following the final rites of the cere
mony and had nothing to do with the
performance of the so-called sun # dance."

line until next Monday. Other delega

parts. Yesterday 779 Grand Army passen

Next Saturday afternoon Major General
W. R. Shafter, -Department Commander
of the Grand Army; General George
Stone, chairman of the general committee
of management, together with members
of the executive committee of tho Thirty
seventh-National Encampment, will go to
Point Richmond to meet the incoming
commauder-in-chlff. General Thomas J.
Stewart of Pennsylvania, and escort him
to national headquarters in the PalacÂ©
Hotel. Among the distinguished comrades
at present In San Francisco is General
Beaver, former Governor of Pennsylvania.
There is an undercurrent of gossip in
Grand Army circles that General Nelson
A. Miles, who is on his way to the en
campment, may enter the .contest for
commander-ln-chlef to succeed General
Stewart. A contest between'General Black
of Illinois and General Miles* for the first
place in the Grand Army would develop
considerable interest. '
FRESNO. Aug. 12.-An ultimatum : has
been issued to the raisin growers. The
directors of the Raisin Growers' Asso

In view of the fact that a large number of

condition not to ring up the wagon and send
them to Â¦ the station, but to endeavor to find
out where they live and try to Ket them to
their lodgings. In fact, let us try to treat
these old veterans a* our guests, which they
really are, and as It is the last time they will

Though she was married to Edgar
Giershoffer, a wealthy New York banker.
Ethel Giershoffer was once reduced to the
necessity of pawning her diamonds to
raise funds to provide her with suste
nance. It was because she had been
abandoned by her. husband 3000 miles
away from her home, relatives and
friends that the necessity arose. She was
granted a divorce yesterday. She began
the action some months ago, after having
made many appeals to Giershoffer.
She said that the marriage was in 1S92.
They lived in New York until 1901, when
they started on a tour of the world. She
went no farther, however, than this city,
remaining here while her husband went
to Japan. After an absence of several
weeks he returned, but much to her sur
prise did not remain, but went straight
to New York, where he is now, notwith
standing that he knew his wife was in
want. She wrote to him repeatedly, she
eays, but got no response, and she finally,
when her Jewelry -was gone and starva
tion stared her in the face, sought the
aid of her parents.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by Rosa Beck against Benjamin Beck for
failure to provide, Josephine L. Llbbey
against Albert Llbbey for cruelty, Kath
erlne G. Cashman against Henry D. Cash
man for cruelty, and D. E. Williams
against W. J. Williams for cruelty.

After tho Â«first crime Weymouth placed
a heavy padlock, in addition to the other
lock, on the door. This the criminals
must have discovered, for when Ihey vis
ited the place during the early hours of
yesterday morning they were prepared
with a locksaw. They operated cleverly
and the detectives say that It must have
taken them at least half an hour to saw
out the section of the door on which the
lock was fastened. After this they en
tered and carried away thirteen boxes of
cigars, nineteen gallon Jugs of whisky
and a two-gallon jug of port wine.
Just- how this bulk of stuff was taken
from the place unseen is a mystery. It
is the theory, however, that the property
Is stored somewhere In the neighborhood
and that a gang of burglars, responsible
for several other crimes, have their den
not far distant. Four empty cigar boxes,
from which the cigars had been dumped,
were found but half a block distant and
this supports such a theory. It is also
believed that the thieves made several
trips to the place, taking 'as much as
they could carry each time and conceal
ing themselves when the different patrol
men passed.
What the detectives pronounce to have
been one of the most clever jobs done
by burglars for some time was discovered
early yesterday morning at 211 Jones
street. A liquor store, conducted by
Frank Weymouth, had been entered and
an unusually large quantity of stock
stolen. The thieves opened one lock with
a skeleton key and then, being retarded
by a padlock, sawed a section of the
door out In such a manner as to re
lease the lock and, after they had de
parted, to prevent discovery of the crime
until daylight. Captain Martin had De
tectives Harper and Bell work on the
case until a late hour last night, but
the crooks were not apprehended.
This Is the second time within the last
month that Weymouth's store has been
visited by burglars, and a restaurant ad-
Joining was entered during the latter part
of July. On the first occasion the rob
bers contented themselves with what
cash was In Weymouth's register. They
entered with skeleton keys and went
away with $30. Then followed the burg
lary in a restaurant conducted by Mrs.
C. Moody at 203 Jones street. This time
provisions and cigars valued at $50 were
stolen. They were bulky and must have
been carried away piecemeal or in a
vehicle.
"I should have liked very much to have
kept the tablets as curios," said Captain
Anderson yesterday, "but I felt that I
was not entitled to retain them and my
sense of honor impelled me to offer them
to the Government, of which I am a l.iyal
and devoted servant."
The captain said further that the Chi
nese regard very highly such tablets and
as an illustration of the value that the
Chinese Government places upon the
treasures of the Forbidden City, he nar
rated an incident that came under his ob
servation while sojourning In Manila. He
learned that one of the sergeants of his
command sold to a representative of the
Chinese Government an imperial Jade seal
for $S00 in gold.
Customs Surveyor Spear gave Captain
Anderson an official letter thanking him
in the name of the Government for the
return of the tablets. They will be placed
In possession of the Chinese Embassador.
Gracefully and honorably, and with due
respect for the ethics of the American
army service, Captain A. V. P. Anderson
of the Sixth United States Cavalry turned
over to Customs Surveyor Spear yester
day three Jade tablets, looted from the
ancestral temple in the Forbidden City,
Peking.
Captain Anderson explained that while
sojourning in Yang Tsun, China., a
Russian officer, under the jovial Influence
of the Inebriating cup, presented him with
the three imperial tablets. Two of the
polished stones are engraved in the
Manchu character, and the third
bears the mandarin lettering. The tab
lets had been part of much treasure that
had been looted by Russian soldiers, the
remainder of the book being at the pres
ent time in St. Petersburg. Immediately
upon his arrival here on the transport
Logan Captain Anderson notified the cus
toms officials that he had the jade tablets
among 1 Is effects and that he wished to
surrender them to the United States Gov
ernment.

The resignation of Harriet E. Worden,
teacher in the John Swett School and Be
atrice Reynolds, teacher of classics in the
Girl's Hieh School, were accepted.
Leaves of absence were granted to J.
H. Phclps and Mary Barrett..
ThÂ« Board of Education adopted yester
day a resolution rejecting tae bid of R.
Dalzell for the contract to Install a heat
ing plfcnt in the Noe Valley School build-
Ing for the sum of J5TT9. The bid was ac
cepted ten dÂ«~ys ago by the Board of
Works, which, however, had failed to file
an estimate of cost with the Board of
Education as the law provides.
The bid was rejected, not only because
It is considered excessive, but because the
plans contemuJate the heating of the
school building by steam, to which the
Board of Education is unalterably op
pesed. Director Roncovleri's motion that
ell other bids contemplating heating by
steam be rejected on the ground that such
h rating Is a menace to the lives of the
pupils was adopted. The action cf the
board will necessitate- the preparation of
rew p!ar.s excluding the use of steam and
the issuing of an invitation for new bids
for the work.
Mrs. Susie Hart beir.g number 1 on the
substitute list was assigned to the new
class in the Columbia Grammar SchooL
The following named, being next In or
der In the teachers' competitive examina
tion, held in June, 1903, were placed on
the day substitute list: Miss Marie E.
Geary. Miss Ida M. Manley. Miss Emma
McGowan, Miss A. M. Loehr and Miss
Elois D. Harrison. They were instructed
to report for duty immediately.
The Board of Public Works filed its an
nual report for the fiscal year 1902-1&B
# with Mayor Schmitz yesterday. The re
port should have been filed under the
charter on August 1 last, but pressure of
other official business delayed the work
for ten days. The report. In addition to
the figures given in last Sunday's Call,
saye:
There vai appropriated for the work and
maintenance of the. department the mm of
SS57.1O7. of which $17.Â«Â«0 was not expended.
The illuminating of the City Hall dome left a
deficit In the lighting fund of J325 53. The
number of gas lamps was Increased from 5019
to riio> and the number of arc lighta from. Â£25
to 932.
The board relteratea its recommendation that
the city secure an adequate water supply from
the Tuolumne River and refers to former re
ports of the City Engineer on the subject.
Colonel Mendell, the late president of the
Board, outlined the Improvement of Third street
f rcm Mission to Channel streets, now under
way, and the City Engineer has been requested
to report upon the possibilities of extending
the improvement southerly. The utter inade
quacy of the appropriation for repairing bi
tuminous pavements is again called attention to.
SEWER SYSTEM PLANS.
The revised plans for a sewer system call
for the expenditure during four years of $7.
250,000. for which a bond issue Is proposed.
Â¦\Ve again refer to the neceeslty of amending
the charter in the matter of paying for public
work before any works of magnitude shall be
undertaken. The charter now provides that
these works shall be paid only upon comple
tion and this plan will not be feasible where
the expenditure le Involved.
The vital matter of securing a municipal
water supply has In some way been allowed
to fall in the rear and does not appear in the
list of projects to be submitted to the voters.
Water supply so far outranks all other mat
ters that they could well be allowed to rest un
til the water question has been settled. i
The fait that the Supervisors have not ap- I
propriated money to repair accepted streets has j
resulted in a number of individual law suits i
for damages agttlr.st the members of the Board. I
which will exercise a restraining influence in I
the acceptance of the onerous duties assigned j
to this board.
COST OF NEW BUILDINGS.
New buildings estimated to cost $15,603,332 50
were approved and ?1.47O,4riO was the esti
| mated cost of alterations and additions to
i buildings. In addition 1729 permits were issued
I without charge, the estimated cost in each In-
I stance being less than S.ViO.
The additions built to schools in the last
three years have added more than 3000 seats.
The amount and character of work done has
been coramvnded, despite the complaint*
against the condition of public schools. Add!- j
tional buildings are undoubtedly needed, but
not to the extent which biased outcry has called
for.
This board takes nc-a^lon to acknowledge
the faithful work done by ttn officers and
employes. The executive officers and office em
ployes have been frequently called upon for ser
vice beyond the hours prescribed by law, for
which no additional compensation is allowed.
The field forces of craftsmen and laborers are,
as is customary, allowed extra compensation
! for such service.
When the reoort was put In the hands
of Commissioner Schmitz for his signa
! ture that official stated that he would not
sign the document, because there were
some things In It he did not approve of.
Schmitz said he did not consider that the
j employes were overworked, which the last
I portion of the report would Jead one to
believe.
THIRD-STREET BRIDGE.
At the meeting of the Board of Works
yesterday the City Engineer submitted a
diagram showing the location of a pro
posed steel bridge to span Channel street
j at Third. The bridge will be built by tiie
I Santa Fe Company and will be a "two- i
leaf Page Bascule" bridge. The board I
approved <he diagram which is to be i
transmitted to the Harbor Commission
for Its approval.
The board denied the petition of Stan
ley Fay for permission to bltumlnlze Lin
den avenue between Buchanan and Web
ster street on the ground that the grad
ient is above 8 per tent, and requires a
strip of basalt paving fourteen feet wide
in the center of the roadway. The Board
of Supervisors had already given author
ity to Fay to do the work.
The board directed the United Railroads !
to cease putting in a cobblestone pave- j
ment on Twenty-fourth street near San J
Bruno avenue, as the specifications call j
for a. bituminous pavement. ;

Dr. Miles' Nervine Waa
My Salvation.
Sleeplessness is at once a symptom and a
disease. Just as soon "a* the nerves become
drranged the patient suffers from sleepless-
ness. Deprived of their natural rest the
aerres soon lose all force and vitality and
while sleeplessness is a symptom in such
cases it iremjentlT becornes chronic and
remains tbe chief effect of disordered nerves.
Dr. Miles* Nervine quiets the nerves and
strengthens them; soothes the tired brain
and permits sleep; restore* lost ecerpy and
vitality and brings sleep, health and strength.
"Previous to our corning to the territory
three vears ago, we lived In Virginia, and it
was there that I get acquainted with the
wonderful powers of Dr. Miles 1 Nervine. I
had been ender the doctor's care and taking
his medicine for over two years, but the nerv-
ous trouble that was gnawing my life away
grew steadily worse. I had nervous cramps
m my hands and legs, which would draw op
and pain me so that I could not sleep at
night. Often I never closed ray eyes for
day* and nights together. Tbe doctor finally
told me he could do nothing more for me and
that I was on the xerze of insanity. He told
me I migflt try your Nervine as a last resort
aad it proved to be xny salvation. When I
had used four bottles of the remedy together
with the Nerve and Liver Pills I had re-
ciined my former rood health." â M*s.

957 to 977 MARKET STREETThe fanatical Doukhobor women who recently
gave way to the frenzied pleadings of an agitator and
started naked on a pilgrimage, only to be lashed
home by their husbands, have at least served to cor
rect a peculiar modern impression. It has been gener
ally supposed that only the ladies within the pale of
civilization have been eager to show as much of
themselves as possible' .
All roads lead to Roosevelt. He represents all that
the Honor Bright Democracy stood for in 1896 and
1900, and hundreds of thousands of De'mocrats of
that kind, and also those who, like. Mr. Brewster, fol
lowed Bryan in both years, turn to him and will
support him. In politics the country is about to enter
another Golden Age like that of Monroe's time.
LAWYER BREWSTER, Mr. Bryan's manager
in his two campaigns, for Brooklyn and Kings
County, New York,, was interviewed as to his
leader's speech at Urbana and said: "Mr.. Bryan's at
tack yesterday on Mr. Cleveland convinces me that
Mr. Bryan's poise and balance are lacking. If I had
been a candidate for the Presidency I should con
sider it beneath my dignity to call an ex-President
a bunko steerer. That speech of Mr. Bryan is not
the only one of his speeches which has my disap
provalâfour or five of his other speeches recently
have contained remarks which were distasteful to me.
If the party hopes to win it "must get back to the
solid Cleveland principles â those of Jefferson."
When asked, "What is your politics. at present, Mr.
Brewster?" he replied: "I have no party now. I
was born a Democrat and want to be one now, if I
can. But I cannot indorse the Democratic party in
its present shape." The interviewer then asked him.
"Who do you think will be the next President?" and
he answered, "Theodore Roosevelt will be elected,
easily."

WHILE the campaign of education against
the use of child labor in the mills of the
Southern States has not had the effect in
tended, it has not been altogether without good re
sults. The Southern mill-owners, instead of co
operating with the movement, turned upon their
Northern critics with charges that the employment of
children in factories is almost as common in the
North as in the South, and that the critics should re
form their own States before trying to reform those
of other people.
Such a method of meeting the agitation against
Southern child labor is not logical, for it is clear
that the violation of a child labor law in the North is
no reason why the South should have no such
law at -all. Still, while illogical, the answer has been
in some measure effective. It has caused a number
of earnest reformers to search out the facts, and the
result is that we have now a pretty clear proof that
the labor laws of several of our largest manufacturing
States are habitually violated, and that the campaign
of education in the interests of the children will have
to be waged as actively in the North as in the South.
In the course of their investigations the advocates
of the children have given a good deal of attention
to the glass bottle factories of New Jersey, Pennsyl
vania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and as a result have
discovered that th'e employment of children is quite
common in such places. In some instances the sto
ries are almost sensational. Thus one authority is
quoted by the Boston Transcript as saying: "For
years the rumor refused to die out that certain chari
table institutions of Philadelphia systematically fur
nished orphan boys who had reached the twelfth
birthday to glass works in New Jersey, where the law
until this year permitted boys to begin work at that
tender age. These orphans were nominally adopted
by glassblowers, whose slaves they became. Within
a year applications have been made to a philanthro
pist in New Jersey for young lads to be 'adopted' by
glassblowers, who were required' to furnish more
boys than thev could obtain."
The publication of such facts has had the effect of
making the campaign much more earnest than it
Â«vcr could have been had it been confined to some-
CHILD LABOR PROBLEMS.

know what the lady would demand if, in her com

Having attained such results from the primaries,
the rank. and file of the Republican party can now
look to the future with an assured hope of success
in the elections. The party convention is to be made
up of racn from whom good nominations may be
safely expected. The prospects are that the ticket
will be sufficiently strong to command the support
not only of all loyal Republicans but of all indepen
dents as well. Under such circumstances we may
count upon having a complete Republican adminis
tration for the ensuing term of city and county of
fice;, and the party will have the prestige of in
augurating "the new and better San Francisco," for
which public sentiment is now ripe. Moreover, the
success of good men in the Republican camp will
have its effect upon the Democratic and the Union
Labor conventions, and each will perceive the neces
sity of putting its strongest men to the front. The
outlook, then, is promising for a campaign of clean
politics. That much is virtually assured by the re

WITH the results of the primary elections
the great masses of the people of San Fran
cisco are doubtless well satisfied. They
have at any rate abundant cause for satisfaction.
There was a sufficient amount of interest taken in
the contests ot each of the parties to bring out a
fairly go/Â»d vote, and in nearly every instance there
was a victory for the rank and file against the
machinations of the bosses and their gangs.
A total vote of something more than 26,000 is not
large for a city of the population of San Francisco,
but it is so much better than the vote of some pre
vious primaries that it may be regarded as an evi
dence of an increasing interest among the people in
municipal politics and a more careful attention to
public affairs. Furthermore, the voting this time was
dene largely by men of independent minds and of
genuine party loyalty, and in that respect the elec
tion is one of the most notable in the annals of the
city.
The salient features of the result are two â first, the
preponderance of the vote in the Republican pri
maries over that cast in the Democratic and the
Union Labor primaries, and, second, the sweeping
victory attained in the Republican contests by the
United Republican League against the representa
tives of bossism. In the first tbe showing is remark
able. Despite the fact that there were in both the
Democratic and the Union Labor parties fights suf
ficiently lively to set in motion the energies of all
the party leaders and to prompt them to do their
uttermost to bring out the voters, neither of them
was able to poll a vote anything like equal to that
cast by Republicans. In fact, the Union Labor men
cast only a little more than 5000 votes and the Demo
crats something more than 7000, while the Republi
cans cast more than 13.000. or a vote considerably in
excess of that cast by Democrats and Union Labor
men combined.
The significance of the heavy vote cast in the Re
publican primaries is too plain to be mistaken. It
is an evidence that popular interest is with the Re
publicans in the coming contest, and that the rank
and file of the party had sufficient assurance of elect
ing good men to incline them to go to the polls and
vote. Had it not been that there were exceptionally
strong tickets of delegates nominated in each district
it is 'quite certain the vote would have been much
smaller than it was, and the bosses might have won
instead of losing.
Such being the case it is plain that the work done
for the party by the United Republican League
merits more than a passing notice. To that organi
zation is due the fact that the party had in the field
in every district a set of proposed delegates repre
senting no faction, pledged to no set of men, bound
to no secret programme and under no obligation
other than that of nominating a party ticket that will
be worthy of the support of every good citizen. It
was the object of the league to rid the party of fac
tions and of boss domination, and its success has
been a genuine triumph. Not a single boss ticket
was elected. The victory of genuine Republicanism
was Overwhelming.

Clark then moved with his parents to
Fort Dearborn, and his father was the
first man to erect a frame building in
Chicago. Clark street was named in hon
or of this patriarchal soldier's father.
In 1850 Mr. Clark came to California
and located In Amador County, where he
has since resided. He is much Interested
plete and the war soon closed by the
surrender or capture of Black Hawk,
Keokuk and other chiefs.
When the treaty was stoned between
the Indians and the United States troops
Charles Clark, like the illustrious Abra
ham Lincoln and the thousand and more
other men who had enlisted to defend
their homes, was honorably discharged
from the army In August of 1S32.

THE hunt of the Democracy for a Presidential
candidate has its amusing features. Judge
Parker was for some time in focus; but when
he went South and instead of talking politics deliv
ered a dry and dusty essay on law he passed from in
front of the lens and ceased to be a possibility. Then
Mr. Cleveland, greatly to the distress of Watterson
and Bryan, was brought out. The Brooklyn Eagle
screamed for him. A preacher named Beetle made
what he called a comprehensive canvass of* Kansas,
Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan,
and announced that it was revealed to him that
Cleveland would carry them all. That ended the
candidacy of the ex-President. Beetle's iridescent
prophecy made it ridiculous, and no candidacy can
stand tha f .
Then Senator Gorman was brought, out by Texas
and Georgia and stood for a time in the limelight,
closely observed. As it was seen that he did not
shy at a dollar nor chew the tongue of him when
somebody shouted "Trusts!" he joined the innumer
able throng of has-beens and went his" way in the
great company of those who were "also mentioned."
The party is now searching, not for a dark horse, but
for a Mayor. Mayor Harrison was supposed to be
eligible ex-officio until the Democratic Chronicle of
his town nicknamed him "Mushy." No politician
can survive being called mushy, and Harrison fell
outside the breastworks. Now it is announced with,
confidence that if Judge Van Wyck, president of the
Society of Southerners in New York City, can be
elected Mayor of Greater New York this year the
country will say to him as Nathan said unto David,
for a different reason, Thou art the man.
It is explained that there are in Greater New York
70,000 Southern voters. They don't fancy using their
balance of power to make Bill Devery Mayor, as a
Tammany candidate, and will prefer Low. But if
Van Wyck run they will make him Mayor and im
mediately transfer him to the Presidency. It is true
that Cleveland was Mayor of Buffalo, but he stepped
into the Governorship and thence to the Presidency.
But the party is now short on Governors in the
Northern States, having only three, in Nevada, Ore
gon and Rhode Island, so the hunt is for a Mayor.
If that fail probably a well qualified constable will
be demanded next.
It is an amusing strait for a party that has had in
it in modern. times McClellan, Seymour, Sanford E.
Church, Tilden, Pendleton, Thurman, Cleveland,
Carlisle, Bayard and Hendricks. Once it had an em
barrassment of riches when it proceeded to select a
Presidential candidate, but now its ideas of the place
have so declined that it is content with an unbroken
Mayor, and even the name of William Randolph
Hearst has been mentioned with favor once or
twice â in his own papers.
In the present competition San Francisco should
enter a Mayor by making an eligible a candidate
for that office. Why waste a candidacy on Mr.
Lane, who is ineligible, being of foreign birth? To put
up some sturdy Roman like Clitus Barbour or D. I.
Mahoney and get into the running is the proper thing
for the San Francisco Democracy to do. Why leave
this city out of the game? Local pride should seize
this opportunity to inscribe the name of San Fran
cisco on the bead-roll of fame.
DARK HORSE OR MAYOR
In the recent Wall street failures there is one ele
ment entirely pleasing to the public. The game seems
to be confined almost exclusively to speculators and
gamblers, with one set fleecing the other and both,
for the time, ceasing to prey on the public. As long
as the operators play with their own money it would
not be considered amiss if more of them were driven
from the pit. .
PERSONAL MENTION.
No other hero among the great throng
that will come to San Francisco can
boast that his record under his country's
flag began three score and ten years ago.
The illustrious old man of Amador, who
Â¦will grace the marching columns that
pass under the Triumphal Arch, still car
ries his ripe years with the light step of
sturdy manhood. Few that see him will
realize that he trod the wilds to the mu
sic of fife and drum at a time so far
removed from the present that California
was then the home of happy Mexican va
queros, and that while he fought Indians
on the plains of Illinois some of the holy
padres of the eighteenth century were de
voutly consecrating their lives to the
work of missions that have since had
added to thoir history the fruitful gen
erations that now make them sacred heri
tages of the past.
Mr. Clark is now 87 years of age. He
was born in Madlaon City. Ind., and
moved to Illinois in 1821. At that time
i the country was terrorized by the Black
Hawk Indians. Soon after the Indian
Creek massacre at a point fifty miles west
of Chicago Clark enlisted at Fort Beggs
as a soldier to fight the redskins.
In 1830 a treaty was made with the
tribes of Sacs and Foxes by which their
lands In Illinois were ceded to the United
States. They were nevertheless unwill
ing to leave their country. Black Hawk,
a chief of the Sacs, then about 60 years
of age, refused submission, and the next
year returned with a small force. He
was driven back by the troops at Rock
Island, but in March, 1832, he reappeared
at the head of about 1000 warriorsâ Sacs,
Foxes and Winnebagos. E.ther he would
not or he could not restrain his follow
ers, and the devastation of Indian war
fare soon spread among the frontier set
tlements. The force at Rock Island was
sent out to stay these ravages and Gen
erals Scott and Atkinson were ordered
from Buffalo with reinforcements. The
Governor of Illinois called for volunteers
and an effective force of about 2400 was
soon marching against the enemy. Black
Hawk's band fled before it. General
Whiteslde, who was in command, burned
the prophet's town on Rock River and
pursued the Indians up that stream. The
Indians were overtaken and defeated on
Wisconsin River and the survivors still
retreating northward were again over
taken near Bad Ax River on the left
bank of the Mississippi. Many of the
Indians were shot in the water while try
ing to swim the stream, others were killed
on a little island where they sought ref
uge. Only about fifty prisoners were
taken, and most of these were squaws
and children. The dispersion was com-
veterans halls from 'Aroador
County,, California. His name is Charles
A. Clark. and the term of his
service began long before many of the
great States of the Union were carved
from the untrodden wilds of the Far " Zest
of seventy years ago.
The memories of Veteran Clark's first
battles carry him back to the days of
Indian massacres â not the massacres of
what is now the West, but the massacres
of the years when Illinois was the land
of the setting sun and when the deso
late region beyond was the American des
ert of the old geographleaâ the home of
buffaloes and Indians.
MANY' remarkable men will visit
this city during the Grand Army
Encampment, but the veteran of
Under any circumstances there would be good Tea
son to oppose such a scheme as this, but there are
other and even stronger grounds of objection than
those which are patent on the petition itself. It is
well understood by those familiar with the project
that it has for its object the establishment in the
immediate suburbs of this city of a gambling resort
that would be under the control of the gamblers
themselves. Thu> the scheme is nothing more nor
less than a project to authorize a species of blackleg
government clothed with authority to levy taxes
upon the cemeteries for the purpose of supporting
gambling dens and such other resorts as would nat
urally gather around them.
That the proposed incorporation is nothing more
nor less than a gamblers' scheme appears to be pretty
well understood by those who have given it any
study. That much was made evident by statements
of San Mateo Supervisors in interviews published in
The Call of yesterday. One of them said that the
man who is engineering the scheme "has powerful
influences of well-known gamblers, whose names I
will not mention, behind him. * * * They say
they will not accept incorporation unless they can
have the cemeteries. I am not in favof of turning
the revenues from the cemeteries into the hands of
the town of Colma. If they want to run their pool
rooms let them look to them for the means of sup
porting their town government. I do not believe
in robbing the places of the dead to pay for the vices
of the living."
Another Supervisor said: "I have heard that the
pool-sellers were behind the movement to incor
porate Colma, but of course I cannot state that I
know it positively." A third said: "I will not men
tion any names, but I know there are well-known
blacklegs and gamblers who are using some of the
Colma people for tools to advance their project of
incorporation."
In addition to the Supervisors there are others
who have in their investigation of the scheme found
reason for believing it to be a gamblers' project.
Thus the manager of the Cypress Lawn Association
is quoted as saying: "This is an infamous attempt
on the part of politicians and gamblers to make the
sacred precincts of the dead a nest for vice."
At the present time San Mateo requires the pay
ment of a license of $i for every interment, and from
that license the county derives from the cemeteries
a revenue varying from $350 to $400 a month. That
would make a rice little income for the schemers to
sta r t their town government with, and would enable
them to run their games without much if any tax
upon themselves. Should the scheme succeed the
cemeteries, instead of being quiet, would be in the
immediate neighborhood of resorts of the riff-raff of
San Francisco, and blacklegs and their kindred
toughs would be a menace to every visitor to the
graves of the dead. That in itself is enough to con
demn the scheme, and public sentiment both in this
county and in San Mateo looks to the Supervisors to
kill it".
Fi ACTS published in The Call of yesterday con
cerning the scheme to incorporate Colma with
.a territory of about twelve miles square ought to
be sufficient in themselves to rouse the people of
San Mateo and of San Francisco to take active steps
to defeat the project. Even upon the face of it the
scheme is an -evil one, for the territory is too sparsely
settled for the inhabitants to form a genuine urban
community, and it is evident that the motive which
prompts the promoters of the scheme is something
quite different from that of a desire for the common
good.,.
The area included in the proposed incorporation
includes not only many farms, but also the lands of
several large estates, among which is the Abbey
Homestead Association and the Holy Cross, Mount
Olivet, Cypress Lawn, the Servian, the Italian and
the four Jewish cemeteries â Eternal Home, Hills of
Eternity, Home of Peace and Salem Fields. As
these cemeteries have become the chief places for the
interment of the dead in this city, it will be seen, that
San Francisco has almost as much concern in the
scheme as San Mateo itself, and public sentiment here
has a right to be heard before the San Mateo authori
ties.

thing like a sectional issue, and as a result some good
has been done in the South itself. Thus the Geor
gia Legislature, while not going so far as to prohibit
child labor altogether, has sought to prevent idle
parents from living on the labor of the children, and
to that end has enacted a statute providing that pa
rents able to work, but who do not work', and who
live on the wages of their children, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a penalty
therefor Whether such a law can be enforced is
questionable, but the enactment of it is a sign of an
improved tone of public sentiment in the South and
gives encouragement to the Hope that the whole
miserable practice of working children in factories or
mines will be abolished ere long from every part
of the United States.

THE STOLEN HORSE.
An Old Proverb With a New Appli-
cation.
' The woods are full of "so-called" reme-
dies for baldness.
IF the complete story could be told of trie devotion and suffering, of
the privations and heroic sacrifices of all the brave women who nursed
the wounded and the dying on both sides in the bloody conflict be-
tween the North and South it would be one of the grandest, most
sublime narratives ever penned. Even when recorded in brief their ca-
reers speak volumes for the dangers they braved to minister with gentle
hands and loving care.
"Oh, what breaking hearts many mothers are still carrying: for their
boys buried in graves marked 'Unknown,' " says Mrs. Mary J. Bos-
ton, one of these fifty-eight fair veterans of that bloody conflict who have
written two full pages of personal anecdotes of their service in the hos-
pital, the bivouac and the battlefield. She not only consecrated her
life to nursing the wounded throughout the entire war, but Rave two
brothers to the cause at Fredericksburg and a brother-in-law at Gettys-
burg, and the anecdote of which those few lines are the prelude is one
jf the most dramatically thrilling ever penned. These fifty-eight women
saw the awful struggle with their own eyes â and it is war â actual war â
that each and every one of them has written of from her own peculiar
point of view. Those two pages alone will enthrall you.
To the veterans whose names make up the roll of honor of the
Grand Army of the Republic that stupendous struggle must ever be a
vivid reality, but to those of the younger generation the hope and de-
spair of that fierce conflict must be seen through the eyes of the artist
the writer and the painter alone. It is a remarkable fact that some of
the best battle scenes ever oainted are those depicting our great Civil
War from beginning to end.
It is this fact that has enabled The Sunday Call in its special
G. A. R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest battles of the war that can be offered bv a
modern newspaper. Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its spec-
tacular close with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. which
scene alone, replete as it is with historical characters, is one of the most
notable pictures ever reproduced on a modern color press. There is
"The Battle of Shiloh." "Chattnnooga," "The Siege of Vicksburg."
"Sherman s March to the Sea." "The Battle of Gettysburg." "Grant's
Career From West Point to Aooomattox," etc.
And in the line of fiction the greatest popularity has ever been given
to tales of love and war. Just think what themes the Civil War had to
offer. And what sentiment, too. There is "Forty Years After" in the
next Sunday Call, for instance. It is a story of the waverinj: tide of
battle at Vicksburg. with a thrillingly pathetic denouement in this city.
Then there 13 "A Girl of the South." "Fate's Pence." "A War Vision"
and "Trying Him Out." which latter will bring back the most stirring
memories to any one who knows anything about war. .
And in a different way, how many know anythinar about the
speeches that created that awful slaughter. There are two pages of fervid
eloquence that will simply amaze you who read them now. so many
years after.
And last but not least there is that magnificent Supplement â tender
sentiment crystallized into colorâ "The Old Army Chest." wherein a
hardy warrior of the rebellion is showing his treasures to his beautiful
fair-haired daughter. Just register a deep-voiced complaint with vour
carrier if you do not Ret this picture with your G. A. R. Edition of the

Special Dispatch to The Call
The testimony of Edmund Freund. the
bookkeeper of the warehouse of the Pa
cific Coast Warehouse Company at
Crockett, was called to the stand. Mr.
McEnerney was assured that the testi
mony of the witness would In no way
jeopardize the interests of his new client,
and he therefore had no objection to his
testifying. Freund was interrogated about
a lot of wheaÂ£ containing 1100 sacks which
arrived at the warehouse on June 1. He
was asked particularly about the mark
ings on the sacks, but was unable to en
lighten the attorneys. It appears that the
Bank of Monterey and the American Na
tional Bank, which are repiesented by
Mr. Chickeringr, are anxious to show pos
session of the wheat, having had mark
ings placed on the sacks for identification.
Freund was requested to visit the ware
house and refresh his memory. The case
was continued until the 20th. On that day
Bernhard Ettlinger will be further exam
ined by the attorneys for the creditors.
Yesterday Ettlinger appeared with At
torney McEnerney, who asked that the
case go over a week until he could famil
iarize himself with it. The request was
granted.
Garret McEnerney appeared before
Referee in Bankruptcy Milton J. Green
yesterday mornlrs as attorney for Bern
hard Ettllnger, one of the members of
the ruined g^-ain firm of Epplngrer & Co.
Ettllnger has broken away from the Ep
pingerB and Intends to save himself from
blame by reason of the peculiar actions
of his partners.
Last week Ettlinger was on the witness
stand and gave testimony before Referee
Green. Attorney Henry Ach, who repre
sents the Eppingers, thought he also rep
resented Ettllnger and advised him not
to answer certain questions propounded
to him by Attorney Freidenrich, repre
sentative of the creditors. Ettlinger sur
prised Ach and every one present by ig
noring his partners' attorney. Ach stood
it for a while and then made the sensa
tional announcement that he would not
act as Ettlinger's attorney. He asked
that the matter go over a week in order
that Ettlinger might avail himself of eth
er counsel.

Corbett has not eased off in his training
as rapidly as it was expected he would do.
Whenever the mood comes over him Jim
is engaged in one form of exercise or an
other. If he is not in the ring or the
gymnasium he is on the baseball field or
strolling along the avenues and streets
In the vicinity of Croll's Gar
dens. Yesterday Corbett boxed six
rounds In his open air ring with
Sam Berger and Yank Kenny. He went
after Berger in the quick shadow move
ment style, tapping him but very lightly
and doing more foot than hand work.
With Kenny Corbett increased the force
behind his gloves and walloped his mas
sive trial horse In a manner that would
cause an ordinary sparring partner to feel
like the last rose on the bush. AH of Cor
bett's exercising is done in the morning
hours, when the air is fresh and Invig
orating. After mixing with Berger and
Kenny yesterday in the outdoor arena
Corbett went at the light punching bag
and played a tattoo on It for six rounds.
This was followed with a turn at the va
rious muscle developing machines in his
gymnasium. Then the big boxer sub
mitted himself to massage treatment at
the hands of Professor Tommy Dare and
his work for the morning was over. In
the afternoon Jim took to tho baseball
diamond and played every position on the
field, apparently enjoying the sport to the
limit.. In the evening he went for his
usual stroll, returning to his cottage and
retiring at 9 o'clock. This morning Cor
bett will work out in his gymnasium and
will spar with Berger and Kenny between
10 and 11 o'clock. He will continue to take
the massage and rubdowns prescribed for
him by Professor Tommy Dare until to
morrow.
For a time yesterday his friends were
afraid Jim would injure his hands from
the way he and Kenny mixed matters.
For two minutes the men cast aside all
rules of boxing and yent in for slugging
pure and simple. Tommy Ryan called to
Corbett to stop several times, but his
words fell on ears that would not hear.
When they finally desisted there was a
splash of blood on Kenny's mouth to tell
of stinging blows.
and confident that he will be
thj victor In to-morrow night's test of hu
man physical skill and endurance. lie
smiles at the fears of some of his friends
who profess to believe he will be rent
with nervousness before the gong sounds
the onset and as a consequence will lack
that Essential element which all winning
fighters must haveâ vitality.
Corbett asserts he has put up his hands
too many times to defend himself and lay
his opponents low to allow such an ama
teur affliction as stage fright or worry to
undo him at this stage of his career with
the gloves. He goes about his finishing
work at his training quarters at Croll's
Gardens in Alameda with the same en
ergy and deliberation that have charac
terized his bodily exercises for nearly
three months. Jim states that the antic
ipation of feeling like the champion of all
pugdom does not disconcert him, as he
has felt that way before. lie has expe
rienced the sensation of capturing the
boxing honors of the world and has come
out of a ten-second daze to realize the
bitterness of defeat. Therefore, Corbett
reasons, what has he to worry about or
why should he be afflicted with nervous
ness? He figures he has no prestige to
lose If conquered for the second timo by
James J. Jeffries and all things to gain if
he knocks the swarthy boilermaker boxer
from the exalted-pedestal he now occupies
In the arena.
WITH the ring battle of his tffe
less than forty hours off,
James J. Corbett. ex-champion
boxer of the world, feels fit
In conditioning himself for the ap
proaching contest with James J. Corbett
Jeffries has had as sparring mates Bob
Fltzsimmons, Joe Kennedy, the clever
San Francisco heavyweight, and Jack
Jeffries. Long, vitality-sapping runs on
the country roads under a scorching sun,
wearing double and triple sweaters, was
eliminated from the champion's training
for this fight. As a consequence he will
probably enter the ring heavier than ever
before. The object of this was to give
speed, and Manager Billy Delaney thinks
this desired quality has been acquired.
These changed methods caused stories to
be spread that Jeffries was dissipating,
but there was little or no foundation for
them. Spectators at the Pavilion to-mor
row night will see a vastly improved
fighter over the man who defeated Ruhlin
and Fitzslmmons in this city.
The herculean boiler maker put in a
hard day's work on Tuesday at Harbin
as a sort of wind up to his labor. In the
forenoon he Bpent an hour in the gym

rope and using the pully weights. In the
afternoon he took part In a ball game and
in the evening Indulged in more gym

kept up for eleven three-minute rounds
with the punching bag, ending with four
rounds of tugging and . wrestling. Jack

MARRY FORBES and Frank Neil,
the best two boxers of their
weight in America, will meet to
night In Mechanics' Pavilion in
a twenty-round battle for the
bantam-weight championship. Forbes Is
the holder of the title.
The boys are to weigh In at 116 pounds
at 3 o'clock this afternoon at Corbett's.
Both have made the weight without any
difficulty and will do but little work to
day. Nell came over from Alameda last
night and went to one of the theaters.
This 'meeting means much to Forbes.
He was given the decision over Nell in
Oakland last winter in a fight In which
Nell claimed a foul. The claim was not
allowed. They were matched again, but
Forbes fell under the blighting Influence
of Danny Lynch and the fight was de
clared off. Clarence Forbes took his
brother's place. Although outweighing his
opponent, he was knocked out.
Nell is a natural fighter, who will tackle
any proposition in the ring, no matter
what the odds against him may be. Forbes
Is the more finished boxer and the better
ring general. His opponent expects to off
set this with his aggressiveness and his
hitting power, which is out of all propor
tion to his size.
Eddie Graney will referee the fight,
which will be preceded by two preliminary
bouts of unusual class.

\V. E. Knowles and party were also on
the road between Del Monte and San
Francisco yesterday.'
At llil a. m. C. A. Hawkins with J.
Rice and Arthur Inkersley left the Hotel
del Monte in a touring car. Salinss was
reached at 12:05. On leaving that town
the operator by mistake took the Wat
sonvilie road instead of that to San Jose,
the time lopt in petting back to the right
road being fifteen minutes. San Jose was
reached at 3:03. in an elapsed time of 3
hours 44 minutes, or deducting the fifteen
minutes lost by pursuing the wrong road,
in 2 hours 2Â» minutes. A stop was made
at the Hotel Vendome in San Jo?e to pro
cure gasoline. At 3:20 p. m. the right rear
tire was found to be punctured and a stop
was made to put on a new tire. This op
eration tuok 23 minutes. The city limits
of Oakland were reached at 5:43 p. m..
and The Call branch office in Oakland at
5:56 p. m. The trip was accordingly made
in an elapsed time of 6 hours 33 minutes.
Deducting delays the actual running time
was 5 hours 17 minutes.
It is alleged that they were traveling at
the rate of 40 miles an hour. They were
obliged to deposit 5100 bail. The time lost
in securing bail was two hours. The car
afterward ran into a fence and 23 minutes
was lost in petting out of this trouble.
The otber car met with one mishap. A
cr>ark plug broke off and from forty to
fifty minutes were needed to find where
the trouble was and to remedy it. With
this delay the car reached Oakland at 5:50
p. m.. in an elapsed time cf 9 hours and
15 minutes.
Nearly all the automobilists who went
to Del Monte for the tournament have
left that resort. Two or three attempts
were made yesterday to establish records
for the trip from Del Monte, to Oakland.
J. A. Keenan with Caesar Luckhardt left
Del Monte at yesterday morning. R.
C. Lennige with Lewis Andrews left the
hot^l at the same time. Keenan and
Luckhardt reached San Jose at 12:10, an

San Jose they were arrested for having
driven through Gilroy at too high a rate

MALARIA A
Germ Infected Air.
Malaria is not confined exclusively to the swamps k^t24^\
and marshy regions of the country, but wherever there is W^ri^t
bad air this insidious foe to health is found. Poisonous WMMfh
vapors and gases from sewers, and the musty air of damp P^lOO
cellars are laden with the germs of this miserable disease, i^^Wi
which are breathed into the lungs and taken up by the f 5^V^|
Wood and transmitted to every part of the body. Then fi^WPi
you begin to feel out of sorts without ever suspecting the
cause. No energy or appetite, dull headaches, sleepy and W*v im
tired and completely fagged out from the slightest exer- u :;^M
tion, are some of the deplorable effects of this enfeebling n^Jnlft'
malady. As the disease progresses and the blood becomes IB
more deeply poisoned, boils and abscesses and dark or ify^zHffiil ~-\
yellow spots appear upon the skin. When the poison is
left to ferment and the microbes and germs to multiply in
the blood, Liver and Kidney troubles and^ other serious complications often
arise. As Malaria begins and develops in the blood, the treatment to, be
Si , , effective must begin there too. S. S. S. destroys
ffT^ f(C^ *k e germs and poisons and purifies the polluted
blood, and under its tonic, effect the debilitated
K^JJ "b^V constitution rapidly recuperates and the system is

Meanwhile Mr. Logan became a little
suspicious, so he wrote to the references
given on the card. This Is the reply from
the First National Bank: .
Dear Sir: In reply to your Inquiry about D.
Gruber. will say that I consider his referring
you to this bank as the last act in the little
farce we have been playing for about two
years, and which began when he gave us hi *
promissory note for about $'Â¦'â¢Â». He has woven
around this note such a web of romance and
fiction that If the impossible should ever hap
pen and he should pay it. we should be al
most sorry to let It go. Such colossal nerve as
his In referring- to this bank reaches Into thÂ«

There are many people who would like
to know the whereabouts of D. Gruber,
late of San Francisco, but later of Rock
well City, Iowa, but latest of Fruitvale.
Most of those who are looking for Gru
ber would like to collect bills. ' â¢
Gruber arrived in Oakland some weeks
ago and began looking for a house. Ha
flashed a big business card, which read;
D. GRUBER.
General Contractor and Superintendent Heavy
Buildings a Specialty.
References â Security Bank. First Xailonal
Bank and Rockwell City Canning Company.
Rockwell City. Iowa. J. B. L. Wood and E4
Croak. Waterloo. Iowa.
When Gruber told people how much he
liked Oakland; that he wanted to live In
this city, buy property and open a busi
ness here, he flattered the business men
of the city. The card looked as If he were
a man of considerable business standing;
his references' sounded good, and the line.
"Heavy Buildings a Specialty." suggest
ed more than a man with a carpenter's
pencil and saw.
The first one who did any business with
D. Gruber was Walter E. Logan, a real
estate man. Gruber wanted to buy prop
erty, but Mr. Logan was adroit and de
manded money. So Gruber selected n
house in Fruitvale and paid a month's
rent, with the understanding" that thia
was to apply upon the purchase price ai
soon as his money arrived from the East.
The Southern Pacific Company has de
cided that it will proceed with the devel
opment of its freight yards in South Ber
keley and to-day the deeds to the proper
ty were placed on file by the corporation.
This act, together with the completion of
the crossing of the Oakland Transit Com
pany's tracks at the disputed point means
that the two corporations came to an
agreement while the people were holding
meetings and denouncing railroads.
The Southern Pacific Company has held
the deeds to the property in Question for
some time. It was purchased when the
agitation for the removal of the freight
yards from the center of Berkeley to
some more remote point was started.
Then began the trouble over the granting
of a franchise for the, Southern Pacific
to cross the street and enter the new
yards. The people in the neighborhood
protested against the location of the
yards at , that point, and the franchise
has been hung up in the Board of Trus
tees for several weeks. - - :
Meanwhile the Southern Pacific Com
pany could not get its tracks built Into
the new yards, and the Oakland Transit
Company could not connect Its track be
tween East Berkeley and'. Emeryville.
The matter was settled last Sunday
when, the corporations got together and
placed the tracks and crossings upon the
line of an old track that the Southern Pa
cific Company owned. The filing of the
deeds to-day settled the -. fact that the
Southern Pacific Company ta'-to havo its
yards at that point. whether It gets the
franchises asked for or ru>t.' : * There were
thirteen lots transferred, a nominal con
sideration being named in each case.

about 8000 acres of land under the canal
will be irrigated by it Ultimately the
project is expected to reclaim about 300.
000 acres of arid lands In Western Ne
vada and Eastern California, including
the old Forty-mile Desert.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â The Secre
tary of the Interior has approved the
award of the contract for the construc
tion of an irrigating canal to connect the
Truckee and Carson rivers in Nevada to
Charles A. Warren & Co. of San Fran
cisco and ttae/E. B. & A.Â« LÂ». Stone Com

cost of $942,437. This is the first definite
action taken by ihe department looking
to actual construction under the recla

The Mof=t Rev. Georpe Montgomery, I>.
Â£>.. lectured before a largo audience in St.
Paul's Hall last evening for the benefit of
the new church of that parish. His sub
ject was entitled "The Natural and the
Supernatural." The distinguished church
man spoke forcibly and well. His dis
course lasted nearly two hours. In the
course of his lecture the Archbishop paid
his respects to the "rationalists." He was
scathing in his criticifm and he alluded to
the late Colonel lngersoll as being a very
shallow man. V
He appealed to Catholics to be faithful.
He said they ought to be proud of their
religion and should feel their responsi
biJity. In j>art he spoke as follows:
The rationalist has never treated the Chris
nan with any treat consideration. That has
never entered into his thought. He began fifty
ysrs ago with a set purpose of dethroning
faith and one of his chiet instruments in doing
so was ridicule. The rationalist never spared
& Clirfftitn'* feelings. I care not whether he
Â»Â¦Â« Catholic or non-CathoJic. Much of the dif
ficulty that the rationalist has raistrd is the
mlada of Christian people has been by the au
dacity in which he has served his sophistries.
- 1 don't care to ccmiÂ»are him with a highway
man, because I mu*i treat him with respect,
r&iih'-ftnd reason have a relation which he ha*
never - realized. That is his weak point. We
Â«-;..' r. with respect or human reason, because
laHh Is founded upon it.. The rationalist
would have you believe that he alone goes by
the law of reason and that the Christian acts
according to his laith. Christian authorities
confess to-day that they are handicapped by
the rationalist. He contend* that he alone
n*eaks fcr reason. He admits a. reason for all
he does and believes, whereas the faithful walk
without a reason. r
WHAT REVELATION IS.
Revelation is to reveal something. God has
Â¦Â¦ .. .- known things. Man says he has found
tnem out. It wes God who made him. His
windows are his five senses, and through these
five senses he see* the universe, the skies, the
mountains. T!;ey make themselves known to
Ms mind, his soul. Therefore God reaches him
tnrough these natural mejins. This U natural
revelation. Supernatural revelation is making
.known in a supernatural manner. What are
the evidences in :;â¢>.- things? If we were to
:-.-k the agnostic to-day why he is an agnostic
â wfcjr he does not accept the truths of the
â¢ "hnstian faiths, he would eay to you that they
are supernatural myttertes. cr that the truths
of the Christian faith are such that they can
not satisfy the natural mind.
I only wish there were more j-oung people
}i*>re this evening, as what I have to say is alto
for them. There is temptation besetting the
path of the young. \Vhat the priest and the
parent should do is to make their children love
and Klory in the grand church of God. They
are lh:ng in an age the literature of which is
such thEt :{ rr.ay raise doubt in their minds on
â¢ i'jt-stior.s of reason and faith.
The rationalist is one of the most Irrational
men. The Catholic must understand that; he
must feel it : he must know it. I want to prove
to you this evening that faith le
knowledge. In common parlance, we
tÂ»y *â¢! believe." I believe a man
:* honest, you may believe it. but he may not
r>p honr-st. Thp words â¢"belief" and faith have
been taken advantage of. It there Is any
thing that a man can know on this earth it
i* the truth of Christian faith. In order to
fhow that faith is reasonable we must not
*>xa!t reason above faith. The rationalist
doesn't do that. We must speak honestly and
onn-eetly about the relation of these things.
The very first act of reason is the act of
fa!th.
CHURCH FOR REASON.
The Catholic church has stood up for reason
wneri the rationalist would wish -to down it.
Th**tathollc church In the Vatican did more
for hurr^n reason, more for the dignity of the
human mind than all the rationalists from Lu
fifer to Hf-rtwrt Srwneer. And at a time when
Speuoer. Huxley. Tyndall and other men were
doing their utmost to sway men against it.
she Vatican Council held that an article of
fa'.th :s that man is free. The rationalist says
man iÂ» not free. The Vatican Council eays a
man is free.
Life is a myrtety. The rationalist says. "I
want a reason." The man who rejects mys
tery rejects the powers of knowledge, because
ail fundamental things, the stars in the firm
nmt-nt. the sun. the raocn. the earth and their
relation to each other, are mysteries. Scient
ists are able to explain the construction of a
rose. Xfcey have s;>ent yean in analyzing each
r*tal and can tell you hew it grows and give
you a. scientific dissertation on the flower, but
can tn*>y make one grow? -Â»
Archbishop Montgomery devoted himself
to prophecies and miracle? and impressed
the truth of them on the minds of his
auditors by illustration and ju recital of
f-ome of them.
GAVE THEM CLTJBS.
"AM these prophecies ftand." he assert
ed. "Th* hand of God has written them
and thÂ«Â» hand of man can not blot them
out." He continued:
What Â¦ pity It I* that the Christian ad
ministrations outRid" of the church have put
dubs in the hands of th*> rationalists to break
our heads. What is that Huto? Private Inter
pretation of God's word. The moment we gt*e
thftn thst j-rivilÂ«-g*> we have no reason to find
fault with them, if they say It i* all fable.
Here t* thÂ» position the Catholic priest takes
Â«nd always will teke. HÂ» claim* he has th*
authority â the divine right â to teach the Bible
to men: that the Bible â the Old and New TeÂ»
taar-nt â Is the word of God. and he Is ordained
to teach the Blblf in his name.
If there ever was a shallow man in the
world It was the late Colon*: 1 Robert Inger
scll; His power Jay in the power of his laugh
ter and to make other people laugh over the
most sacr'-d things. He could make you laujrh
Â¦ t your drad grandmother. He would pick up
the w-holÂ»> Testament and make you laugh at
It. There are some queer things In Holy
F<-riptur*. but nobody but the Catholic church
bus a right to say whether they are true or
troti Thia may sound har*h. but Christian de
nomination* will come to it some day. The
Catholic will not ro to the rationalist for his
interpretation of the word of God.
TruÂ» pelence the world love*. True sclÂ»ncÂ»
the church is very proud of. Science can only
progress the lnirtant that man Is free. And
r\Â«re we have the little rationalist tilling us
that man U not a fr*e man at all. ThÂ» Vat
ican Council haÂ» laid down the article of faith
"that "man 1* free."
LATTER-DAY MIRACLE.
The Archbishop ppoke of the death of
p^p*> L<eo XIII and pointed out the fact
t!iat the whole world paid tributes to the
dead Pontiff. He said:
CÂ«thol!r people, have you ever had a thought
wf growing weak In the supernatural? You
. -jeht to grow strong In it. for during the last
thPeo or four we*kÂ» we have really been liv
inc in the presence of a Visible .miracle. We
have s*Â»n the civilized world bearing teÂ»;i
monv Of the supernatural. In what way? In
thÂ«- death of Pope l*Â° * nd *?>Â« election
"f his Â«urrÂ«^sor. Plu* X. we have seen the
whole clvlli*e4 worldâ Christian, agmstlr.
catholic and non-Catholic alikeâ with scarcely
<n* dissent, parsing eulogies on the pa/>t and
praising the nÂ«=w Pontiff. Pope Leo XIII was
i h" representative of the eupernatural. He
Â»4ts one who Â«poke with authority on these
things The Catholic world recognizes that
the vole* of OrA ?poke through him. and
l.enre Catholic people, J mj, rhouid grow in
gratitude. In their love toward Ood. that they
have lived to *ee It. The Catholic church is
the divine teacher of men. W* Â«ee the world
shewn a good fwll.ig toward us. and when we
i*. Fuch good fueling H ought to make uft
grateful to <;..d. Catholic people ought to he
proud of the fart that they are Catholics.
They ought to feel their responsibility.
GRASS VALLEY, Aug. 12.â This city
has been visited by two disastrous fires
within the past fifteen hours. Noell's
grocery and dwelling-house .' adjoining
were destroyed this morning and a dwell,
ing owned by Thomas Quinn'of San
Francisco was burned Tuesday. This
morning's fire started in a house occu
pied by William Trebilcox and family.
Mrs. Trebilcox was taken from the burn
ing building through a window. Her hus
band then re-entered the house to res
cue their baby. He was overcome by
smoke, but both he and the child were
rescued by firemen.
It is more than likely that 200 head of
cattle belonging to Mr. Thompson, a cat
tleman who makes his headquarters sev
eral miles below Grass Valley, have per
ished in the fire." : , The animals are known
to have been in the path of the flames
and it 'is hardly probable that they suc
ceeded in making their way to a place of
safety. The fire is now raging in the
mountain forests and it will doubtless
take several days to get it under control.
Fire fighters are battling hard in an effort
to subdue it. ...
NEVADA, Aug. 12.â A wide stretch of
country In the vicinity of Omega is being
swept by a fierce lire and already an im
mense amount of damage has been done.
The fire burned briskly Sunday, but was
finally checked, and it was then thought
that all danger had passed, but the blaze
broke out afresh yesterday and last night
it was more furious than ' ever. Several
hundred acres have been burned over.
The flames were traveling east toward
Diamond Creek last night, laying waste
everything in their path. The property of
the Red Cross Mining Company is.. in im
minent danger. It is reported that several
of the older buildings on the property
have been wiped out. The sawmill at Red
Cross has also been partly burned, a por
tion of the flume has met a similar fate
and the remainder is In danger of de
struction. !
BENICIA, Aug. 12.â The competitive
shooting between United States troops on
the Benicia range was not Completed to

' HOUSE Â¦- LEADERS' ATTITUDE.
A provision looking to temporarily in
creasing the circulation has been formu
lated and was laid before the President
to-night.
The most hopeful sign that something
may be accomplished is the growing feel
ing among Senators that^hey will be able
to agree with the leaders of the House.
To get harmony it Is necessary to adopt
a policy of "give and take," and this pol
icy is being pursued.
It is reported that Representative Can
non of Illinois, who Is to be Speaker of
the next House, has shown. a disposition
to meet the Senators half-way. What
Cannon has been urging is that the bill
shall not be loaded down with too much.
He will give his support to a reasonable
measure which supplies an emergency cir
culation to provide funds in time of strin
gency for the movement of crops. He also
is supposed to be willing to favor a bill
which will permit customs receipts to be
deposited In national banks.
While the Senators would not discuss
the details of the bill, they made It clear
that they brought with them, in concrete
form, a statement of the various proposi
tions, to which they have agreed. No
draft of the bill was brougnt.
It can be. asserted that the Aldrich bill
of last j session has been abandoned, al
though some of the features which it con
tained may be found. In the new bill. The
proposition to secure Government deposits
on railroad, municipal. and country bonds,
instead of Government bonds, so that the
Government bonds could be released- to
be put up for additional circulation, has
met much opposition In the West. This
feature, If is said, has been dropped.
It is probable that the first thing In the
bill will be a provision for the deposit of
customs receipts In banks. The problem
of an emegency circulation, based on the
assets of a bank, to be retired when the
emergency passes, has been discussed In
a half-dozen different forms.
Mr. Roosevelt had caused It to be known
that while it was desirable that- the till
to-be passed should have the practically
united support of* the Republicans of the
Senate and House, if. was also important
that the measure' should- be on broad lines
and not open to the. charge that it was
planned to make it easy for the banks to
get money out of the treasury in order
to lend it when stock speculators "got
into- a hole.V
VIEWS OF THE Â¦> PRESIDENT.
The arrangement for the visit of the
Senators was made by Senator Spooner,
who was in New York on Monday and
who arrived at Senator Aldrlch's home,
Warwick, R. I., yesterday. There Sena
tor â¢ Spooner found' Senators : Aldrich,
Platt and Allison, who had, assembled to
put into the; form of a Bill .the Joint re
sult-of their, individual cogitations, which
have been taking form 'ever- since â¢Â» the
Senate adjourned. -..."' Â¦ ...
When "the Senators got together it was
found that President Roosevelt, had some
very clearly denied ideas about the leg
islation that is in contemplation.
OYSTER BAY. N. Y., Aug. 12,-Cur
rency legislation was the subject of a long:
conference held on short notice at Sag
amoro Hill to-night. It was participated
in by President . Roosevelt, Senator Nel
son W. Aldrich of Rhode Island?. Senator.
William B. Allison of Iowa. Senator O.
H.--Platt of Connecticut and Senator John
C. Spooney of Wisconsin.
It was by far the most important con
ference held at President Roosevelt's
country home this summer, because It
was held for the purpose of determining
in a general way the character of the bill
which shall be introduced at the extra
session of Congress. , .

on all day until 5 o'clock and In the

ing the first time the university has put a

The freshman class will not contain as

were 635 regular members of that class
last year. 296 special and 108 limited stu

&48 had registered for the freshman class,
so the indications aro there will be a con
siderable falling off. A large percentage
of these 543 applicants will probably not
be accepted by the university, in which
event the numbers will be still smaller.,

a sailor off Cape Horn when he dived under

disabled rudder, and he lived up to the tradi
tions of the sea In his first experience ashore.
He received his pay on Tuesday, and with
some $250 rattling in his pockets, went-trip
ping up town to forget the hardships of Cape
Horn in a good time. He reported on board
the Homeward Bound yesterday dazed and
penniless. How. when or where he lost his
money he does not know. If he had any fun
he doea' not remember it. He had evidently
been, piled with narcotics. Williams is not a
heavy drinker and is usually able to take good
care of himself. When he recovers from the
effects of the knockout drops the police hope
he will be able to give them same clew which
will lead to the discovery of the robbers.
Victim of Knockout Drops.
The decision, places the captain's former
stenographer in a sad predicament. She
became a mother several months ago
and Pedersen is the father of the chjld.
At the time she married the captain she
believed his tale that the woman who
lived with him on Haight street was his
sister and that he was free to wed. She
did not discover that she had been, duped
until the woman returned and announced
that she and not the stenographer was
the gay captain's spouse. Pedersen dis
appeared about that time, and as Otelia
could produce no documents to prove her
claim' the second Mrs. Pedersen denied
her admission to the house and a suit to
recover possession of the ' premises re
sulted. During the trial the woman whom
Judge Murasky si*)sequently found to be
Pedersen's wife testified that she had
married the captain at Honolulu several
years ago. She said she had a certificate,
but that it had been lost in a shipwreck.
Fully fifty witnesses testified that they
knew her for years as Pedersen's wife
and it then dawned upon the pretty
stenographer that she had been victim
ized. Still sh^ fought for the sake of her
little one, but in vain, as the court's de
cision shows.
Mrs. Otelia Pedersen is the wife of Cap
tain John Pedersen, the mariner who dis
appeared from this city several months
ago, leaving behind him, numerous unpaid
bills and two women, each of whom
claimed'. to be his wife. Yesterday Judge
Murasky decided that the woman he
married in Honolulu years ago. who was
known to hundreds as Mrs. Pedersen, was
his lawful wife, and that Mamie Fysette,
Pedersen's stenographer, whom â¢ he mar
ried during the absence of his wife in
Norway, had no legal right to the name
of Pedersen. The decision was rendered
in the suit to recover the household fur
niture in the Federsen home at Haight
and Pierce streets brought by Otelia
Pedersen after her return from Norway
and after the discovery of the second
wife.
The Decision Places Mamie
Fysette in a Sad Pre
dicament.

Obelia Pedersen Is
Mariner's Wife.

Police Are Searching for
Thomas Flood, Who Has
Disappeared.
The police are searching for a bellboy
who gave the name of Thomas Flood and
disappeared from the Pcndleton Hotel on
gutter street a few days a&o, taking with
him valuable jewelry belonging to sev
eral of the guests.
About the beginning of this month the
boy was sent fro'm Hansen's employment
agency, and he made ,yo favorable an im
pression by his cuict and courteous de
meanor and plcasine voice that he was
at once encaged. He soon became a fa
vorite with the quests, and the ladies
liked him for his good manners.
A few days aeo he disappeared, and
that day several of the ladies complained
to the landlady that their jewelry had
been taken from their rooms. Mrs. Abe
Marshall, wife of the well known tailor
en Kearny street, near Market, missed
a. valuable diamond and pearl pin. Mrs.
G. E. L. Willcutt, wife of the secretary
cf the United Railroads, reported the loss
of valuable articles. Several other la
dies were also victims of the bellboy's
cupidity.
Suspicion at ence attached to him. as
he did not retain and had not made a
demand fcr the w&zcs due him for the
few days he had been employed. Cap
tain Martin was notified and he detailed
Detectives Harper and Armstrong, but
thpy have been unable to locate the bell
boy or any of the stolen articles. Flood
Is about 20 years of age.
Most of us can find fault without the
use of a search warrant.

NEW TORK. Aug. 12.â Wall street's more
hoptful views of the outlook were reflected In
the movement of price* upward with which
Ux> day'* operations betan. The advance be
came to rapid as to overrun the newly awaken

market showed rignm of being oversold, the

with the Billing l>par. The fact wa* developed
In to-day*a market that there are buyers who
will come in on advance who would refrain
irom buyicg at th* lower level. There is a
Isrgf volume of *f-M!njr which disappears from
O>f market when prices tend upward. Of
n*.u?>Â«Â« this Is F*-peclally true of forced sellers
hv rianon of marÂ»rins wiptd out and shrinkage
of collateral. But :t :Â« also truÂ« that holders
of Â¦Â«.curttieÂ« are prompted to nell them when
thÂ» price is declining who win bold wben
price* brria to advance. The celling of col
lateral out of loans and the contractions of
credits hfc-r-.'-'l to haw disappeared to-day.
Andr from thru consideratio&a there was no
r.-. .->â¢Â¦ i chancea in conditions to account for
thÂ«- larger buying of iwcurlties.
Rates for time money continue very firm.
Th* continued heaviness of Taf&}gn exchange
causr* active dlscusvion of possible early gold

I was off %c to >H.fc%c at the Â£tart, opening at

Hay and Feedstuff s.
The demand for Feedatuffs Is rrportcl quiet
er, but the market continues strady. There is
no change in Hay. which is still in heavy re
coipt.
Tho clrt-ular of Somers &. . <"o. says 'of Hay:
"ltojcelptK of hay have been heavy again. 6100
Ions having arrived during the past week. In
comparison with .VtOO for tho weet! preceding.
The situation c-ontlnuos practically unchanged
in every â¢*Â«>'. Cars have' become more plenti
ful, as was evinced by yeHtortluy'n arrivals of
113 cars. Matters have steariieri down some
what during the past week, for there hns been
but little activity throughout the country and
dealers have been busy disposing of their
purchatrs or. the market hero. An to the fu
ture very little of interest can he reported,
for at present tl-.ore is nothing In sight -to help
<li/termlne future values. Sump little Inquiry
from outside diKtilctH has been, noted, hut this
Is not at it 1 1 unusual. It looks as though , wo
would have nothing. beyond, our usual demand
unless It will b" a continuance of our last sea
son's demand along the Coast, which does not
aggregate any very groat quantity. The lum
ber industry is thrivlnK and as long as it
remains eo the Coast ports- to the north, of. us
will draw on us for more or less hay.
"Tho bulk of prenont arrivals still continues
to be medium grade hay. which causes us to
believe that the choicer lots are being held
for storage. Hollister and Llvermore, which
are our districts for best grado hay. are send
ing practically nothing to market. Contra
1 CoÂ«ta County Is shippins freely and all the
counties bordering on the bay are sending
in their hay crop by schooner quite plenti
fully."

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables:
-Receipts of Potatoes were moderate ' and
prices of good stock were maintained under
a continued steady demand' for local use and
shipping purposes. The receipts Included much
small unripe: stock, which dragged at easy
rates. A few small consignments of. Sweets
came In and found quick sale at firmer prices.
Onions were plentiful and easy at the pre
viously quoted rates.
Receipts of Tomatoes were light again and
prices had a further advance. The high
prices, however, checked the demand and there
was -quite a surplus unsold at tho end of the
day. Receipt! of Green Corn were liberal and
consisted chiefly of poor:, and wormy stock.
Fancy offerings 'alone were firm.* Bummer.

Cucumbers. Egg Plant and Bell Peppers and
trade was active. Poor stock moved slowly

Poultry and Game.-
The Poultry market was well supplied. A
car of Western came in and the receipts of do
mestic stock were heavy. Fine, large, young
stock moved freely, but poor, scrubby Hens
continued to drag at easy prices. Some large re.
tailers were holding off. expecting a decline
owing to the heavy receipts, but wholesale
dealers were firm In their views and prices
were maintained.
Hare and Rabbits of good quality sold off
well and Hare were quoted higher. Doves ar
rived freely and continued weak at the re

varying one way or the other, as the receipts

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
" With the exceptfon of ripe Bananas every
thing under thla head, was in ample supply.
and as there was uracttcally no demand for
shipping the market had an easy tone. Re
ceipts of Pears and Peaches from the river
were light and' consigned chiefly to canners.
The latter purchased freely of choice Egg and '
Green Gage Plums and " also of freestone ,
Peaches. Bartlett Pears in bulk were steady.
CholCti wrapped stock from Martinez was firm
at a slight advance. Scattering lots of Apri
cots were received and found ready sale at
good prices. Nectarines were offering and
cleaned up quickly. Figs arrived too late for
the regular trade and. sold at easier rates.
Supplies of Plums in small packages were still
limited, but as there was -no shipping demand
prices ranged lower. The market was over-
I loaded with Apples and Peaches and only strict
ly choice offerings commanded the top quota
tions. Prices of Melons' stood about as previ
ously quoted, with supplies of all kinds tar In
excess of the demand. . There were liberal re
ceipts of Grapes, chiefly poor and sour stock/
and there was a general decline In prices. It
was difficult to obtain 'more than 75c per box
I or crate for anything except fine Seedless from
! Hanford or fresh Tokay. Attractive lots of
Berries found quick sale, but the common run
of offerings were poor and moved slowly.
The market continued practically bare of ripe \
Bananas, the recent arrivals being mostly
green. Mexican Limes were easy, but prices
were no lower. The Panama steamer arrived
with 413 cases. Oranges and Lemons were dull
and featureless.

yesterday added to the encouragement caused
by the monthly report published the day be
fore. In thV generally brighter outlook hopes
were expressed cf a good bank statement, al
though there was no very obvious foundation
for this in any known department. Late In
the day the market came under the influ
ence of a flood of rumors affecting the dispo
sition of the Â£eaboard Air Line, it Ik Â«lgnl
ficant of the change in sentiment that a prop
osition which promised large addition to an
already large- volume of securities failed to
causÂ« the chill of apprehension which the
market has shown at all recent suggestion of
â¢the creation or the new securities. 'i'nÂ« leader
chip assumed by Rock Island. In the late
I movement foreshadowed the announcement just
! before the close of a deal for Seaboard Air
, Line by Rock Island. The gains reached from
: l'io points far the principal active stocks and
more than that for specialties. The market
closed very strong and active.

A number of residents of the Mission
have decided to form an organization
which will be known as the Mission Park
Club, the object being to agitate for the
construction of a recreation park in the
Mission. The site which Is advocated is
the. old Jewish Cemetery, between 1 Eight
eenth, Twentieth, Dolores and Church
streets. Those having the matter under
consideration and who have been Indus
triously getting signatures to a petition
have called a meeting of citizens to be
held at the Turn Verein Hall, Eighteenth
street, near Valencia, on ,Saturday even
ing.
Recreation Park for Mission.
To controvert this allegation Brotherton
says he Is prepared to introduce the co
partnership papers, joint bank books and
receipts for over 53,000,000 of remittances
made by him to Kemp Van Ee during the
period over which their joint business re
lations are supposed to have existed.
Since the early part of July the American
Consul in London has been taking deposi
tions there, about . twenty-eight in num
ber, to prove that he and Kemp Van Ee
did business in the English metropolis
together, in sumptuously furnished of
fices, and were widely known thera as
mining partners. ,
The suit will first come up in the Calav
eras County courts, but eventually will be
transferred to the United States courts,
where Its progress will be carefully
watched by local mining men, for the de
velopments are "expected to be fraught
with considerable interesting matter re
garding the handling of California mines
among British investors.

nent mining men, who for years were as
sociated in the development of California
properties and plans for floating them on
the London market, are now at the Pal
ace Hotel, where, with their respective
attorneys, they are preparing for a bitter
fight in the courts of the State.
One of the gentlemen is J. C. Kemp Van
Ee, who is widely known In Northern
California, where he has operated for
many years, and the other Is J. H. Broth
erton of Denver, who has come West. to
inaugurate litigation in the courts over a
mine, In which he claims to have a com
mon intprest wlrff the first named. The
proposed suit involves the Royal group of
mines, situated in . Calaveras Couaty,
which have gained considerable promi
nence by reason of the fact that they
were recently disposed of to an English
syndicate for a large sum.
It is this sale that is responsible for the
trouble bcteween Kemp Van Ee and Broth
crton and for the bringing of Brotherton
to the coast. According to the allegations
upon which Brotherton's suit will be
based, he and Kemp Van Ee are bound
together In a business way by a copart
nership dating back to 1886. Three years
ago Kemp Van Ee purchased the Royal
property at Hodson from its owners, J.
D. Peters, J. V. Castle and I, R. Wilbur
of Stockton, the price being 5400,000. paya
ble In cash at certain periods within four
years. After about $65,000 had been paid
on the purchase price, it is chargedj by
Brotherton, that Kemp Van Ee secured
a title to the property and recently trans
ferred It to London capitalists. In this
deal Kemp Van Ee, it is claimed, paid no
heed to the copartnership arrangement
between himself and Brotherton and re
fused to share the profits of the deal with
the Denver man. In fact, the first named
Insists that the copartnership does not
exist and that Brotherton has no claim
upon the profits of the Royal mine.

Harrison avenue, forced his 19-year-old
wife and her infant girl of 5 months to
leave their abode yesterday afternoon.
The unfortunate woman, bearing her child
in her arms, applied at the Emergency
Hoepital for aid and she told a tearful
Ftory of treatment to the doctors in
charge.
According to the woman's statement her
husband Is a drunken, worthless fellow.
and he continually abuses both herself
and her child. Yesterday, according to
her statement, he turned them both out
cf doors, and as the poor woman had no
other place to go she sought refuge at the
hospital. The Society for the Prevention
cf Cruelty to Children will look Into -the
case.

Story of Abuse by Drunken
Husband.

Attorney Moore was seen after the
breaking up of the proceedings. He says
that Livernash Is simply fighting for time
and delaying the case so as to ''put In
evidence. Livernash says that If he closes
his case now he will be under a great dis
advantage. He does not know when and
where the arbitrators will meet and he
thinks that he Is giving the street car
company an undue advantage If he closes
his case and then gives Attorney Moore
all the time he wants to complete his end.
Livernash is smphatic in his declaration
that he will liot think of reopening his
side of the case for two weeks at least.
"As I said before," replied .Livernash,
"I am willing to send a telegram to the
arbitrators asking them when they will
meet and where."
"If I don't hear from' the arbitrators I
will go on with the case the day after
to-morrow, whether you are here or not."
said Moore, and he slammed his books
together and left the room. "This Is my
first and last experience with arbitration
boards."
"Now look here, Mr. Uvernash," said
Moore, who was getting angrier every
second. "You have said . several times
â¢you don't care.' I know you don't care;
you are not, supposed to,care; but gentle
men when .they meet generally keep their
feelings to themselves." .
"I don't care," Livernash fired brÂ»k.
"What are you going to do? I don't
call yrfur action adjourning." said Moore.
"All you are doing is walking out on the
case."
"Well, we will adjourn anyhow." snap
ped Livernash, rising from the table and
putting on his hat.
"Parties are supposed to go to trial
fully prepared when their case is called,"
continued Moore. "I insist that this case
goes on."
"I am willing to telegraph the arbitra
tors, Informing them of the situation,"
Euggested Livernash.
. "I will not agree to anything." said
Moore. "I want the case to go on."
"WE'LI/ ADJOURN ANYHOW."
When Livernash had finished reading
his statement Moore at once objected to
an adjournment for two weeks.
"There is no reason, for it," he said.
"I see no reason why we should not pro
ceed. I object to these continual ad
journments; you had one two weeks ago."
"When I had an adjournment before,"
replied Livernash, "it was because I
wanted to secure the testimony of seventy
witnesses. If they had been called to
this courtroom It would have taken a
month's time before they would have all
been fully examined." *
:er thus gathered and prepared considerable
Ame should be ppent If the task is to be ade
luately performed.
Therefore, at this stage. I suggest an ad
iournment for two weeks. /i-,.";
Inasmuch' as there can be no sitting of the
arbitration - commission earlier than the last
of September. I feel that the cause of the Car
men's Union can be promoted without injustice
to the- United Railroads by postponing the pre
sentation of the matter mentioned In the first
five paragraphs concerning matter to be sub
mlttedr I feel that a fortnight hence, or there
abouts.-I could .make a considerably more sat
isfactory showing than I am in a position to
make- to-day.- All of such matter can then be
presented ln-.-half a day. I believe that it will
all be-presented In written form. ; . â¢
Concerning .'the evidence relative to condi
tions' affecting cost,, of- Hying " and affecting
street railway service In cities other than San
Francisco, '"I have this to nay:
If the ruling of the arbitration commission
concerning my objection evidence of that
character presented by the United Railroads
shall be sustained, then there will be no occa
sion for producing on behalf of the Carmen's
Union any matter to rebut such evidence. I
am earnestly of the conviction that the ruling
of the commission will be with me In this re
gard. I do not feel, therefore, like entering at
this stage of the proceedings upon rebuttal in
this regard and shall not submit matter in re
buttal unless the ruling of the commission shall
make that course a proper one.
I am the more determined in this respect be
cause I am not yet fully prepared to rebut the
United Railroads' case as to cities other than

evidence forming a part -of our case in chief.
Thirdâ Affidavits relative to the retail price

I am in receipt of a telegrram from Mr. "W.
D. ilahon, a member of the arbitration com
mission, informing me that It will be impossi
ble for him to participate In any sitting of the
commission before the last of September,
whether here or in the East. This information
leads me to vary somewhat my plans as to our
case In rebuttal.
I have' yet to submit the following matter:
The trouble all started yesterday aft
erncon at 2 o'clock. Attorney Moore was
the first on hand, and In answer to the
question, "How much longer did he think
it would take to close the case?" he re
plied that when Livernash was finished
with his rebuttal he could close for the
railroad in about two hours. -
About this time Livernash arrived in
the courtroom and at once began by read
ing a prepared statement asking for an
adjournment of the case for two wtekc.
He said: Â»
On account of Livernash, counsel Â»fpr
the'Carmen'a Union, refusing to go on
with his side of the case for two weeks
the arbitration proceedings which are now
pending between' -the carmen and the
United Railroads broke up in a row yes
terday afternoon^ Livernash will net
close his case until he hears from the
arbitrators when and where they will
meet to render their decision In the case.
On the other hand, Attorney Moore, rep
resenting the street car corporation, la
emphatic in the statement that he vill
brook no further 'delay and that he will
resume day after to-morrow whether Liv
ernash' Is In the courtroom or not.
Gavin McNab is not disturbed in the
least by the claims of his opponents. He
is quite well satisfied with the outcome
of the primary election.
In Republican circles and among tax
paying citizens generally there is rejoic
ing over the victory won at the polls last*
Tuesday by the supporters of the United
Republican League. The success was 'so
complete and decisive along, the whole
line of boss resistance that the insurgents
in every district are preparing to sur
render. The successful Republicans now
say that it is up to the delegates-elect to
give the party a ticket composed of the
most capable and reputable men In the
community. The confidence in their abil
ity to win out at the November election
Is unbounded. ! The measure of success,
however, will depend upon the character
of the ticket nominated by the conven
tion. The Republican voters will never
stand for any dark and secret program
ming cf delegations, but will insist that
nominations be made by. \the delegates
themselves on the floor of the convention.
The bright prospect of victory is bring
ing out a legion of candidates.
Leading men in the Democratic League
resent the suggestion that Ralney con
controls any of the district delegations. It
is further asserted at league headquarters
that Gavin McNab's forces are not strong
enough to swing the convention. The
claim is advanced that many of , the dele
gates claimed by the county committee
organization cannot be programmed.
RAINEY CONTROL DENIED.
Sheriff Lackmann yesterday dismissed
Patrick Walsh from his position as bai
liff in Judge Troutt's court. The reason
ascribed Is that Walsh took too prominent
a part In the primary election in the In
terest of the Martin Kelly faction.
William G. Antonovich, president of the
County Committee Club, claims that there
is one ballot in the ballot box which has
not been counted which will elect the
seven delegates of his faction. Under the
primary law, however, the ballot cannot
be counted by the Election Commission,
but the municipal convention must decide
as to Its status.
This makes ten delegates elected out
of seventeen. A peculiar condition exists
for the remaining seven delegates to be
chosen, as fourteen names appear to have
each received 267 votes to-be divided
among the seven to be elected. Five of
'the fourteen are "Horse and Cart" candi
' dates and nine are on the County Com
mittee ticket. The "Horse and Carts"
will thus have two and a half votes in
addition to their other two, or a total of
-four and a half delegates, and the County
Committee "gets four and a half votes
out of the seven tied, or a total of twelve
and a half.
The County. Committee elects eight del
egatesâJoseph Valente, Walter J. de
Martini, Thomas Foley, David Capurro,
Paul Vlautin, Mario Forno, Fred Boden
and Harry C. Simi.
The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday afternoon began the official
count of the returns of the primary elec
tion-held last Tuesday. The Twenty
eighth, Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth As
sembly districts were counted, with no
changes in the results. In those districts
the delegates named by the United Re
publican League, the Democratic County
Committee,- the Ewell-Aubertine wing: of
the Union Labor party and the Socialists
were successful.
The most important change was dis
covered by Deputy Registrar Gordon In
the Forty-rffth District, where the first
returns showed that the * Democratic
County Committee had elected seventeen
delegates. Gordon found that in this dis
trict the "Horse and Cart" Club elect two
delegatesâ William Ortelll and George
Seekamj). -â¢
In answer, to questions by Shortridge
she indicated that the reason for Dillard's
departure from 'â¢ the city was due to a
auarrel between her ajnd him. ' That was
"No, sir," she answered. . /
"Well, you better be more, careful here
after/or you will, find yourself in jail,"
cautioned the Judge.
.Woodworth was for committing her^
but the "Judge decided to give her the ben
efit of the doubt.'' '
â¢Mrs. Dlllard, the defendant's wife, who
is said to be an octoroon, although she
looks like a white woman, nearly had her
self committed for contempt in her anx
iety to answer a question over the ruling
of the court. Shortridge asked her if
after her husband's departure from the
city she had been Informed by Collector
Lynch that all of defendant's accounts
were straight. The objection to the ques
tion was sustained and Judge de Haven
cautioned the witness not to answer. De
spite the warning she chirruped forth;
"Yes. he did."
"Did you hear me tell you not to answer
that question?" demanded Judge de Ha
ven. . Â¦ Â¦ . , Â¦Â¦ . Â¦ . j- --...Â¦Â¦;.".Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦
MRS. DILLARD OFFENDS.
Dillard was finally given up by Wood
worth and after eliciting some few fur
ther facts from him regarding the meth
od of leaving for signature the duplicate
and original ! certificates on Collector
Lynch's desk, Shortridge dismissed his
client from the witness stand.
"Your Honor, I apologize," he 'said,
"but no man can tell a witness that he
Is swearing falsely when I am his attor
ney."
Judge de Haven cut short the retort on
the lips of Woodworth and delivered to
him a severe lecture, cautioning him not
to offend again by commenting on the
testimony during the examination. He
told him ' that the proper time for com
ment was during hia argument.
The court rapped sharply for order and
Shortridge bowed thrice in the manner
of a gentleman of the old school. But he
returned to the attack.
"I desire to state," he said, "that what
the witness says is not false." -^
Again the court pounded his desk and
Shortridge bowed again.
SHORTRIDGE IS COURTLY.
Shortridge was on his feet in an Instant.
"Do I understand counsel to say that
what the witness states is false?" he
asked in an awe-stricken voice. v
Woodworth flared up In an instant an3
exclaimed: "What the witness says is
false."
"You were careful to keep me from any
opportunity to examine the papers in the?
case." v
It was while trying to involve the wit
ness regarding this transaction that At
torney Woodworth drew upon himself a
censure from Judge de Haven for his
treatment of the witness. He asked Dil
lard if he had ever seen the Deming let
ter since the morning of April 22, when it
was received. He said he had not and
added: Â¦ - â¢â¢-""-.
Regarding the letter of April 22 from
Deming. X. M., Inclosing a photographic
copy of Lynch's signature on one of the
alleged false certificates, which started
the investigation. Dillard testified that
he opened the letter in the presence of
Lynch without looking at its contents
and handed it over to him. He further
swore that Lynch, after reading the let
ter and looking at the photographic re
production of what purported to be his
signature, directed the witness' to write
a letter telling the Deming authorities
that the signature was genuine. Dillard
said he started to tell Miss Monnet, the
stenographer, to take the reply, but
Lynch suggested that the witness would
better write the letter with his own hand,
as the words, "in California," in wit
ness' handwriting also appeared in the
photographic reproduction, and this
would be doubly- convincing to the Dem
ing authorities. 'He' 'said that Chief
Deputy George Wright was present and
heard the conversation. The witness -was
taken over this ground time and again,
but he never varied In his statement of
the circumstances.
STICKS TO HIS STORY.
Despite his lack of memory he made an
excellent witness for himself. He was
not trapped into any admissions that did
him harm, despite the repeated efforts of
Woodworth to make him commit himself.
His contention that he had never issued
a certificate without having an applica
tion presented to him and that every one
of those issued by him had been submit
ted to the Collector for his signature was
skillfully adhered to.
The absence of receipts on the back of
the original certificates, which he testified
he Invariably demanded when Issuing a
duplicate, he explained by stating that it
was often the custom to take these re
ceipts separately on a typewritten sheet
and attach them to the certificate. He
thought some of the missing ones might
have become separated in handling the
papers. Woodworth pressed this point
strongly, but it acted somewhat in the
nature of a boomerang when on redirect
examination it developed that out of a
bundle of about fifty certificates which
the - prosecution admitted to be genuine
thirteen v/ere without receipts.
In regard to the latter defense he ex
plained that it was his custom when ap
plication was made for a certificate that
had been Issued by some one other than
himself to look up the original applica
tion and to see that they corresponded.
But in cases where he had issued the
original certificate himself he often made
the reissue from the data set forth in
the second application, as he was satis
fied that the oriKlnal certificate had been
issued properly and he assumed that the
facts stated in the application were cor
rect. Other errors he attributed to cleri
cal causes and pleaded in extenuation for
his carelessness the large amount of work
he was called upon to perform.
HOW ERRORS OCCURRED.
Under the kindly ministering of Sam
uel M. Shortrldee, the' defendant's attor
ney, Dillard's memory of occurrences con
nected with the issuance of the alleged
forged certificates was brilliant, scintil
lant, resourceful. But when District At
torney Woodworth started to probe into
the irregularities of some forty odd al
leged spurious certificates the defendant's
ifecollective powers suffered an almost to
tal eclipse. Everything that might tend
to explain the causes which lead to the
admitted discrepancies between the dupli
cates and the originals in the Collector's
office was-surprisingly dim and misty in
his- mind. Upon two rocks he built his
defense â clerical errors that he might
have committed inadvertently and mis
representations in the applications . pre
sented by those asking for duplicate cer
tificates. . -V"i

worth encountered a difficult task yes
