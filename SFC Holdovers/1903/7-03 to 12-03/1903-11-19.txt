Colombia Again Informed That Pana
ma Has Been Becognized.
WASHINGTON', Nov. 13.â It Is
learned here that the Bogota situa
tion has assumed a critical phase, as
far as j relations between the United
States and Colombia are concerned.
Minister Beaupre, on the ISth lnst.,
was pressed strongly by the Colombian
Government to know whether the
United States Intended to recognize the
republic of Panama. It Is understood
that the request was in such shape as
to constitute a menace in the event
that the recognition had fceen extend
ed. Beaupre was Instructed by this
Government to again inform the Co
lombian Government that such recog
nition had been extended to the new
republic of Panama by the United
States, but simply In the Interest of
humanity and civilization, and In con
formity with solemn treaty obligations
binding upon 'the United States. He
also was - Instructed to . tender to the
Colombian Government the good of
fices of the United States to effect a
settlement of the differences between
Colombia and Panama. The reply is
awaited with some anxiety here.
Beaupre, as has been stated, has
been granted leave of absence. by the
State Department, and it remains for
him to determine when he shall avail
himself of the leave.
As an earnest desire of the State De
partment to continue on friendly terms
with the Colombian Government, it is
pointed out that, without bringing di
rect pressure to bear, the department
is disposed to do everything in its pow
er to save any equities Colombia may
have in .the Isthmus^- Thus It is recog
nized as entirely proper that some part
of all matters relating to the entire
mineral- industry, thÂ«-head official of
which shall be known as the Commis

to deliver any articles to the Chicago

It was announced to-day In official
circles that the French colony In Bo
gota had extended its sympathy to the
Colombian Government and had of
fered to contribute $300,000 for its sup

This message has caused great re
joicing and on all sides are heard
cheers for Germany.
General Perdomo has been appointed
commander in chief of the Colombian
army. He Is positively the best In
formed officer in Bogota on affairs of
the isthmus, having acted in an of
ficial capacity at Panama during the
exciting times there. He was once
Governor of Panama.
Adding to the indignation of the peo
ple and stirring them on in their prep
arations for war Is a cablegram re
ceived from Germany, which "disap
proves of the course taken Jby the Unit
ed States and censures her for her In
terference at Panama." V >.. . "
The note concludes by stating that
"A prompt reply is awaited from
Washington, as the Colombian army i3
ready to march on Panama at once."

The Minister, in his note to the Unit
ed States, through Beaupre. says: â¢
"The Colombian Government protests
energetically against the attitude tak
en by the United States. By the rec
ognition of Panama and the warning
that the United States will not allow
Colombia to put down the rebellion the
heretofore friendly relations existing
between the two governments have ar
rived at such a critical state that it Is
absolutely Impossible to continue dip
lomatic relations, unless the Washing
ton Government should Immediately
give notice that it has no Intention to
prevent Colombia retaking the isth
mus or to extend any recognition to
the belligerents."

spondent In Bogota sends the follow
ing:
Official reply was made to-day to the
note presented by United States Minis
ter Beaupre informing the Colombian
Government that Washington had en
tered into official relations with the re
public of Panama. The reply was
framed by Senor Carlos Ricos, Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, who vigorously
defends his Government and threatens
to march an army upon Panama unless
the United States immediately recedes
from it3 position. That the Colombians
are willing to fight to maintain their
dignity and retake Panama is shown
by the strong support offered the Gov

Minister Ricos' stand.

where a strike of the metalliferous min

time, and that he had asked President
Roosevelt to send the regulars from
Fort Logan. He said that if the Presi

SALT LAKE. Nov. 13.â A large pro
portion of the coal miners employed at
Castle Gate. Utah, decided to-night to
go on a strike in sympathy with the
miners in Colorado and elsewhere. The
exact number who will obey the order
will not be known until to-morrow,
when the strike order is to take effect.
The outlook to-night Is that a major
ity of the men will go out and that in
such an event the strike will spread to
all the principal coal mines in Utah.
This means not only the cutting off of
the supply for Utah and other inter
mountain States, but the curtailment oÂ£
the supply for San Francisco and th>
Pacific Coast and the shutting off of
shipments to Colorado and other strike
districts.
The Utah Fuel Company, controlling
practically all the Utah mines. Is un
der contract to supply the Southern
Pacific with not ess than 1000 tons of
coal a day. Tins contract has "been
running as high as 3000 tonÂ«i besides
the coal shipped to thecoast'for com
mercial purposes. Should there be a
general strike this supply will be cut
off. At present about one- third of the
miners at Sunnysld* are out, although
the company claims to have madn Â«oma

Secondâ That the legal fees and other

party. These expenses are said to
amount to perhaps $150,000.

ANGELS TAKE DTELI, GAME.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â The State
Department late this afternoon re
ceived advices that the Department of
Cauca and Antioquola of Colombia are
seeking to separate from that Govern
ment and are soliciting admission Into
the Panama republic.
No surprise Is expressed here over
the report that these departments are
making an effort to align themselves
with the republic of Panama. The two
departments named and also that of
Bolivar are the most prosperous in the
whole Colombian territory. They con
tribute the greater portion of the rev
enues for the federal treasury, that fit
Antioquoia alone paying about one
third of the entire amount. The An
tioquoians are known as the "Yankees"
of- Colombia and are progressive and
businesslike people. For a long time
there has been dissatisfaction and dis
content among the people of these de
partments over the management of af
fairs by the politicians in Bogota. .
The : Department of Cauca will bene
fit more largely than that of any other
except Panama from ,the construction
of a canal across the isthmus.
Two More Departments Would Secede
;/.y c From Colombia.
SEEK TO JOIN PANAJJA.
No time will be lost by Panama In
ratifying the new treaty. Whether
the ratification will be made by the
Government at Panama or whether
the commission which arrived here o
.nighfc will be cabled power to ratify It
has not yet been determined. The ex
change of ratifications will occur in
Washington. ;
The President has not determined
when the convention shall be submitted
to the Senate for ratification. : His
present purpose is to withhold it until
there is reasonable assurance that Its
consideration will not obstruct any of
the legislation for which the present
special session of Congress has been
called.
The Panama Commissioners, Fred
erico Boyd and .Dr. Amador, arrived
here shortly before midnight. -They
were met by M. Bunau-Varilla, the
Panama, Minister, -who explained- to
them the . provisions of the new canal
treaty signed to-night. The Commis
sioners expressed their satisfaction
with the convention.
The contention of the Washington
Government that the capital of the
new republic be not located In either
Panama or Colon was not pressed 'by
Secretary Hay when he found that the
Panama Government was earnestly op
posed to It and the treaty makes no
such provision. This, however, it not
regarded by the Secretary as a vital
point, In view of the extensive rights
which the United States has through
out .the canal strip and Its especially
wide Jurisdiction in the terminal cities.
This Is the only point In the negotia
tions which caused the expression of a
difference of opinion.
H. C. Donald, a mining: man, com
mitted suicide in the Overland Hotel
by taking corrosive sublimate in a
glass of water. The body was found
fully twenty-four hours afterward by
a servant in the house. Donald came
to Reno several days ago from Tono
pah. Among the effects of the deceased
was a notebook showing that his home
was in Sonora, Cal., and that he is
survived by a wife and child. He had
$100 in the pockets of his clothes and
a membership card of the Eagles. In
the vest was a watch and chain, with
a locket containing a picture of a wo
man, presumably his wife, and a little
child.

the following dispatch, delayed in
transmission, has Just been received:
"BOGOTA, Nov. 16.â The Colombian
people protest and appeal to the Ameri
can people against the conduct of the
Government presided over by Mr.
Roosevelt. The United States Is
solemnly obligated by the treaty of
1868 to guarantee the rights of property
and the sovereignty of Colombia in
Panama. Now the American Govern
ment has violated its word and hence
has compromised the honor of the
American people. Colombia has wished
and wishes that the United States shall
open the canal through Colombian ter
ritory. The disapproval of the Hay-
Herran treaty was due to constitution
al obstructions, which can be legally
removed by Colombian people, and
which were made worse by the diplo
matic discourtesies of the Department
of State and its representatives here.
"The American Government, through
Secretary Hay, contrary to the prac

of the $10,000,000 which the United
States Government is to pay over to
Panama upon the ratification of the
treaty should be allowed by the gov
ernment of Panama to .Colombia in
payment of Panama's share of the Co
lombian national debt. It is under
stood, however, that the United States
Government would not offer an af
front to the Colombian dignity and
honor by tendering directly a sum of
money in the nature of a bribe as a
salve for the separation of Panama,
and, while it could not specify in its
agreement with Panama that any part
of the $10,000,000 was to be diverted to
Colombia, there would be no conceal
ment of the hopes of the United States
in that matter. The present intention
of the United States Government is to
include in the new treaty provision for
the payment of $10,000,000 to the re
public of Panama and to no other gov
ernment.
.The following cablegram was re
ceived at the State Department this
afternoon from Consul General Gudg
er at Panama, dated to-day:
"There is a good deal of excitement
In Buena Ventura and some feeling
against foreigners. The Colombian
Government is said to be considering
a land invasion of the isthmus."
Admiral Glass Is expected to send a
ship to Buena Ventura if, in his judg
ment, the situation warrants It, and
he will be communicated with to that
effect.

SPOKANE. Wash., Nov. 18.â Mrs. A.
Mcllvain, living in Minnehaha Park, is
receiving congratulations from rail
road men and others for a noble deed
preventing a serious railroad accident.
Mrs. Mcllvain's residence is riot far
from the Great Northern tracks which
connect Hillyard with Spokane. The
grade between the two places is very
heavy and after leaving Hillyard the
trains, despite the fact that the air
brakes are applied, always gain mo
mentum, passenger trains as a rule
coming down at a thirty-mile-an-hour
clip. About dusk Mrs. Mcllvain dis
covered that a telegraph pole had fall r
en across the tracks. She had no fa
cilities for communicating with the
company at Hillyard. and the t^me
when the express would pass was near
at hand. Realizing the danger and
knowing that she must act promptly,
she picked up a lighted lamp arid made
her way rapidly to the track. She
started up the road in the direction of
Hillyard and had gone at least 200
yards when the bright headlight of a
locomotive became visible around a
curve. The engineer quickly Baw the
woman holding the lamp high above
her head, reversed his engine and came
to a stop as he neared the figure.

Secretary Hay went to the State De
partment at 4 o'clock and after the
convention had been engrossed and the
necessary arrangements completed for
signing it he returned to his residence
with the treaty in duplicate, there to
wait for the arrival of the Panama
Minister. Â¦Â¦'Â¦1+t--.
Secretary Hay was at first somewhat
undecided as to whether the treaty
should.be an amended form of the Hay-
Herran convention or an entirely new
paper. This point was decided at a
luncheon at the Secretary's house to
day, at which were present Secretary
Root, Attorney General Knox and a
number of leading Senators. Their
unanimous opinion was that an en
tirely new treaty would be the more
favorably received by the Senate.
After the luncheon a slight change in
the original draft of the treaty was
made.
Secretary Hay had a conference with
the Panama Minister late last â¢ night
and the general terms of the treaty
were agreed upon.
Two-thirds of the treaty concerns de
tails of administration, which, while
not necessary to the efficiency of the
convention, will, it Is believed, com
mend the new treaty to many members
of the Senate who picked flaws In the
defunct Hay-Herran convention.
The money consideration is the same
in the new treaty as in the Hay-Her
ran convention, with the exception that
the $10,000,000 goes to Panama instead
of to Colombia. ,
The treaty provides that the canal is
to be neutral and open to all nations
on even terms.
Permission also is given the .United
States to fortify the line and the ter
minals and it may police it with troops.
That portion of the treaty dealing with
the fortification of the terminals Is
rather general, but sufficiently explicit
not to be misunderstood.
The cities of Panama and Colon re
tain their municipal autonomy under
the republic of Panama, so .long as
they maintain public order and sani
tary-conditions \to the satisfaction of
the United States.; Failure to do this
gives the United States, according to
the treaty, the right to force striet com
pliance with the wishes of this Gov
ernment in this direction and the
United .States â¢ can even use force to
compel obedience to rules as to pub
lic order and public health in these
cities.
The keynote of the treaty is the
provision in one of the very first arti
cles by which Panama cedes to the
United States whatever lands through
out the republic of Panama this Gov
ernment shall find desirable in" connec
tion with the building or the operation
and maintenance of the canal. In ad
dition, the treaty gives to the United
States abundant sovereignty over the
canal etrip, which, it Js understood,
comprises between eight 'and ten miles
on each side of the canal. Within this
zone the power of the United States is
as absolute as if the zone were part
ind parcel of this country.
In general, it may. be said that while
the new treaty contains many of the
provisions of the failed Hay-Herran
treaty, it is not based on that conven
tion, but follows not only the spirit,
â¢iut the letter, of the Spooner act.
Thus, instead of the lease for a fixed
period of the canal strip, this new
treaty provides for a perpetual grant
of the right of way to the United
States; and, instead of a complicated
provision for courts of mixed composi
tion â half American and half Colom
bian â to administer justice over the
canal strip, the new treaty permits this
Government to exercise the most com
plete jurisdiction thereon, i:
It consists of between twenty-two
and twenty-five articles, but the main
points of the convention are contained
in the first six articles.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â Secretary
Hay and M. Bunau-Varilla at 6 o'clock
signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty,
providing for the construction of the
Panama Canal by the United States.
The ceremony occurred in Secretary
Hay's study. The Panama Minister ar
rived at Hay's house promptly at 6
o'clock, having made an appointment
with the Secretary for a conference at
that hour. He was surprised to find
that the Secretary had before him the
treaty, engrossed in duplicate. The
Secretary informed Bunau-Varilla that
he was ready to sign the treaty. The
Minister read the document carefully
n.nd then he and Secretary Hay at
tached their signatures to it. Hearty
congratulations were exchanged.
Although the treaty has not been
made public, the Associated Press is
enabled to give the substance of the
document.

A. Camlnetti reported for the com
mittee on debris dams. The substance
of the report was that experienced and
able engineers of the Debris Commis
sion had reported that the regulation
of hydraulic mining can be made effec
tive, and quoted the statements of the
report of the Debris Commission in sup
port of this assertion. It has also been
shown that miners had in good faith
obierved the law, as shown also by the
Debris Commission report. Threatened
litigation constantly held before the
miners was the reason that there were
so few applications for licenses to mine
by hydraulic methods. This tended to
make capital timid. The Miners' Asso
ciation would not defend any violators
of the law, but would support any le
gally Issued permit so long as it was
not revoked.' The machinery of the law
was in operation on the Tuba River,
and It now remained to set it In motion
on the ~Bear, American, Cosumnes,
Mokelumne, Calaveras, Stanislaus and
Tuolumne rivers. The committee re
ported also in favor of the construction
of a dam on Weaver Creek. .
MINERS OBEY THE LAW.
Judge Hinkson went Into a long ex
planation of the attitude of the Sacra
mento Chamber of Commerce toward
the Miners' Association, and declared
that the Chamber of Commerce had al
ways sought the passage of legislation
beneficial to the miners.
"When Judge Hinkson stated that
Grove L. Johnson had not been ac
corded proper courtesy by the conven
tion he was reminded by President
Belshaw that every courtesy had been
extended to Johnson, who had ad
dressed the convention at length.
Judge Hinkson explained that the
evident antagonism to Johnson's views
was not a proper spirit to be shown.
The delegates did not desire to debate
the subject with Judge Hinkson, and
when he closed his speech he was given
a cheer.

addressed the convention on a question

The day was crowded full of matters
of interest to the miners. The reports
that were submitted by committees
were of importance. Nlles Searls con
gratulated the delegates upon holding a
most interesting and profitable conven
tion, t ..^._
A resolution was adopted offering the
services of the association as media
tors in case of differences arising be
tween the mine owners and mine em
ployes. A permanent appropriation was
asked for the support of the State Min
ing Bureau. A promise to furnish the
public with Information possessed by
the association regarding wildcat min
ing schemes was incorporated in a res
olution. The annual election of of
ficers took place.
Just before the convention came to
an end Secretary E. H. Benjamin, ad
dressing the convention after his re
election as secretary, made a statement
denying. completely assertions relating
to himself that have been published.
He said he had been accused of using
his office as secretary to act to the det
riment of miners by joining with oth
ers to extensively locate timber lands
as mining claims. He asserted with
emphasis that he had not entered one
acre of Dubllc land. He confessed to
associating himself with a railway that
will be constructed in Butte, Plumas
and other counties that will begin con
struction In thirty days, and that the

Â¦wedding being the culmination of a
pretty little romance which had its be

summer to visit his relatives in Ohio.
He has but ore arm. and one day in
the <iinir.e car he ordered a sirloin
steak. When it was served he, of
course, could not carve it. Across the
aisle two ladies, mother and daughter,
vere seated and. seeing his trouble, the
elder lady volunteered to cut the meat
for him. She found It more difficult
than she had expected and called upon
her daughter to finish the carving, and
Kirby enjoyed his meal. Of course,
there was an exchange of cards and
Kirby learned that the ladles were go
ing to Cincinnati, while he was go
irg to Hamilton. Kirby now admits
that he spent as much time in Cincin
nati as at Hamilton, and before he left
for Los Anseles there was an under
standing between him and Miss Ward
by the terms of which she agreed to
cut his steaks for him for the rest of
his or her life. They were married to

PRETTY LITTLE ROMANCE
CULMINATES IN A WEDDING
Los Angeles Official Marries a Young
Mr. Johnson made answer. In
fact, his presentation for the people of
the valleys .was all that was made
from that side of the house. William
Nicholls Jr. spoke In support of the po
sition of the 4 Miners' Association. He
asked if, when he held in his hand a
permit to mine by the hydraulic proc
ess, the Anti-Debris Association would
say that he could' not mine. He assert
ed that the Anti-Debris Association
had tried to place every obstacle in its
power in the way of the hydraulic
miners. If the Anti-Debris Associa
tion had information that the terms of
the license were being violated let the
association complain to the commis
sion and have the permits recalled.
*W. C. Ralston spoke at considerable
length in favor of the resolutions in
question. He said that the miners had
not been treated fairly by the Anti-
Debris Association. The time had ar
rived when a spade should be called a
spade and for the miners to meet the
issue before them. The members of
that association had come out in their
true colors and opposed all hydraulic
mining. \Hf, did not think, in viewof
the history of the matter, that this was
fair and square dealing.
A. Burrows spoke for the miners'
side of the case. Mr. Voorhels called
for the question and then the resolu
tions were unanimously adopted as a
whole, the miners applauding energet
ically at that result. Then Mr. Devlin
asked permission to speak, which was
denied.
DEFEND THE RESOLUTIONS.
There is the place where we want these
questions adjudicated and this resolution sim
ply gives notice to these men that that is
where we want this matter decided. WÂ»
make no threats. This association has refused
to take up any gravel miner's case which Is
not a legitimate one. but In no court Influenced
by those Influences I have spoken of can these
men get justice, and I say, with all Â° due re
spect In referring to the courts of Sacramento
County, that the matter should be referred
to the United States courts. Any order there
made and any decision given by them you
will support as loyally as Mr. Johnson or
any other man, and until that time I am
ready to give notice that we are ready to
fight.
Dunton grew more animated as he
proceeded, and said:
Now.Mf I remember rightly, the resolution
doesn't attack any one for going into court.
Tho'se men who are engaged in gravel mining
intend to obey the law, and. so far as we know,
we don't Intend to assist any miner who
does. not obey* the.jlaw. .But- there la a point
which we have reached, I will say for Mr.
Johnson's benefit, while we can't, as the Bible
says, turn thÂ« other cheek to be smitten, we
have been smitten long enough, and I for one.
though not a gravel miner myself, think the
time his come to flght a little t>lt. That Is
what I think about this proposition, and I
think the time has come to flght, not In the
courts of Sacramento County, not In the coun
ties where the Judges are elected by the men
who make and form the Anti-Debris Associa
tion. Let this matter go into the national
courts and their orders will be obeyed. Let
us go where we can get Justice.
It is the fact that the United States Gov
ernment is the one that has control of this
question and in their courts should it be de
cided whether or not the gravel miner has
fulfilled about the law every, single require
ment of the commission appointed, not by thÂ»
Anti-Debris Association, not by the courts of
this State, buf by the Federal Government.
That is where we want this question settled,
and I think it is time that we gave notice to
the Anti-Debris Association that we intend
to go where exact and quick justice can be
obtained for these men, who don't Intend, who
don't desire, to violate the law.
C. H. Dunton answered Johnson. He
said that he had seconded the motion
of Judge Belcher to get the matter le
gally before the convention, but he had
been opposed to it. Dunton was great
ly In earnest and spoke In a ringing
voice. He was applauded at times. He
was sarcastic part of the time while
he was speaking. He said the conven
tion would appreciate the kindness of
Johnson in coming, down from Sacra
mento to prevent It from making mis
takes. Dunton said that he personally
appreciated the kindly manner in
which Johnson advised about El Do
rado Countyâ not to restrict the debris
in Weaver Creek "so that we may be
able to mine in that county." "I think."
said Dunton, "that the delegation from
El Dorado County appreciates what he
says.
"Wa are perfectly willing to pay our
proportion of the $500,000 that has been
appropriated for the benefit of the
farmers of El Dorado County. We ap
preciate his kindness in advising us
that it is not wise to indorse or sup
port that resolution."

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 18.â More than
a month overdue, her captain and half
1 her crew down with scurvy, the first
mate in command and none of the men
under him hardly able to work, the
Italian ship Cressington, Captain Pal
legro, crept Into port last night and
dropped anchor off Port Los Angeles.
She was 178 days from Antwerp, a
voyage which usually takes between
130 and 140 days. The vessel is laden
with railroad iron, cement, etc., con
signed to W. R. Grace & Co., most of
which is intended for Huntington's
electric lines In this part of the State.
The Cressington was formerly a
British vessel, but for a year or more
has been flying the Italian flag. She
made a quick trip to Cape Horn and
was well up the South American coast
when she encountered gale after gale,
all of them from the northwest, the
very direction in which her course lay.
For days she made no progress, in fact,
she was beaten back at times. The
constant storms wore out the crew.
Then scurvy appeared and nearly half
the men were stricken with It. Two
weeks ago the captain became ill and
was unable to leave his cabin. The
first- mate navigated the vessel with
the short handed crew and after weeks
of suffering finally reached port. The
captain was brought to a Los Angeles
hospital, where the physicians say there
is hardly a possibility of his recovery, j
Four members of the crew are said to
be even nearer death.

Upon motion of A. Camlnetti the fol
lowing resolutions were added to the
report of the committee on resolutions
and were adopted by the convention
unanimously:
WANT Sl,000,00O SPENT.
Resolved, That this association 1Â« under deep
obligations to the merchants, manufacturers
and business men of Ean Francisco for their
generous financial aid during the past and
previous years, and recognize the fact that
without this special assistance it wculd have
been unable to accomplish one-half of what
has been done. The - association Is free to
acknowledge this since the j largest proportion
cf the funds received has come from these
gentlemen who are only* indirectly interested
In the Elnlag Industry.
Whereas. The mining exhibit to be made at
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition will to a
certain extent advertise the mineral industry
of California; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we earnestly request that
the mining men throughout th4 State contrib
ute specimens and samples, through the State
Mineralogist, to bÂ» exhibited.
Resolved. That this association hclds Itself
greatly indebted to the public press of San
Francisco and the mining' counties for the as
sistance it has given, not enly to the associa
tion, but to the mining Industry of California
durinc thÂ» past year.
TO CONTRIBUTE EXHIBITS.
Resolved. That we approve the recommen
dation of our uresident with refercne* to the
wildcat mining schemes and the ossoclatlon
will gladly furnish the public with any in
formation regarding such schemes that may
be in Its iKjssesilon.
Whereas. ThÂ« United States Debris Com
mission having Congressional authority to de
termine what hydraulic mines In the drainage
basins of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers may legally conduct that form of min
ing ha\*lnK In a written communication to
this association stated that there has been no
considerable failure of any of the impounding
baniera; but few cases of illegal mining dis
covered; the number of failures of dims com
paratively email, and that no large percentage
of debris ha* escaped by reason of failures
of Impounding works; and
Whereas, This Federal commission In charge
cf such work has the best facilities for know
ing of the practical workings of the law re
lating to hydraulic mining; therefore, be it
Resolved, That this association deprecate the
numerous and frequent attempts of the Antl-
Detrls Association, a private organization,
without either Government or State sanction
or authority, to Interfere with Individual mines
and miners and obstruct as far as lies In their
powers the workings of the law permitting
hydraulic mining In the section referred to by
serving Injunctions and otherwise annoying
miners who have already received legal licenses
from the United States Government to mine
by' the hydraulic process.
ATTACKS ITS OPPONENTS.
Resolved. That we urgently request our
representatives in Congress to secure appro
priations for the purpose of building additional
restraining dims and barriers for mining
debris upon the tributaries of the Sacramento
and the San Joaquin rtvers. viz: upon the
B*ar. American. Cosumnes, Mokelumne and
Calaveras rivers and their branches.
Resolved. That the California Miners' Asso
ciation looks with grave concern upon the dif
ferences that arise from time to time between
the emrÂ»ioyer and the employed In the mining
Industry in this State.
Resolved. That this association hereby of
fer? itÂ« friendly aid in the settlement of any
such differences that may hereafter arise, and
to that end be it further
Resolved. That whenever requested so to do
by the several interested parties, the president
of this association shall appoint a committee
to arbitrate Fuch differences.
Whtreas The Mining Bureau is the only
organizatton in the State for the accumula
tion of iata_ records, maps and geological
*p*ciraens for the general welfare of the min
ing industry, therefore be It
Resolved, By the California Miner* Asso
ciation In convention asembled that we earn
estly request our Legislature to place the Min
ing Bureau upon a prot>er basis by making a
sufficient and permanent appropriation for its
support.
Whereas. The lapse of tima frequently ren
ders it difficult and sometimes impossible to
prove with certainty the date of a mining lo
cation upon which a mineral patent has been
based, thus giving rise at time* to expensive
and vexatious litigation, therefore b- it
Resolved. That In the ooinion of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association all patents for min
eral land hereafur Issued should contain a
statement of the date of location cf the claim
upon which Issuance of such patent Is bas?d.
and said statement should be prima facie evi
dence of thÂ» date of such location In both
State and Federal courts.
FIXING DATE OF LOCATIONS.
Whereas. The mineral Industry Is now In a
position to demand from the Government the
recognition due to its yearly increasing pe
cuniary and industrial importance, and to ask
that its affairs be placed in charge of one
Federal official to whom all miners may ap
peal and who will collect statistics and mat
ters' relating to the techncT.ogy of mining;
therefore be It
Resolved That the California Miners As
sociation. In convention assembled, respectfully
urge upon Congress consideration of these
matters and ask that It appoint a separate
and special Commissioner of Mines and Min
ing whose work shall be dene upon the lines
of that of the Director of the United States
Geological Survey, but to include under his
Jurisdiction gold and silver as well as all
oth<r mineral substances produced In the
Urlted States said commissioner , to be under
cuch Cabinet officer as Congress may deem
best; and be It further
Resolved. That the president and secre
tary of this association be authorized and in-
Etructe.1 to transmit copies of these resolu
tions and of the report of the committee on
(lrpsnment of mines and mining to the mem
bers of the California delegation In Congress,
and respectfully ask their aid In the further
ance of the object desired, and request that
a suitable bill be Introduced to carry out such
object in behalf not only of the miners of
California but of those of the whole United
States.
ASK AN OFFICIAL HEAD.
and earnestly request that he make such ap
pointment.
Whereas. The Committee on Department of
Mines and Mining reports that it Is of the
opinion that it is Impracticable at this time
to obtain the consent of Congress to appoint
a Cabinet officer for such a department and
that instead this association should urge upon
Congress the necessity of at least creating a
special commissioner of Mines and Mining un
der supervision of the Secretary of the In
terior, of the Treasury, or of Commerce and
Indus:rles. as may be considered best: and
Whereas. Net only have the California
Miners' Association, but also the Trans-MIss
lssippl Congress, the National Mining Congress
and kindred bodies for some years been urg
ing upon Congress the necessity of creating a
Department of Mines and Mining with a Cab
inet officer at its head; and
Whereas. These efforts have thus far been
apparently In vain, although a new Cabinet
position has since been created in thÂ« Depart
ment of Commerce and Industries, having in
charge many departments formerly under other
Cabinet officers, but omitting mining; and
Whereat) Different branches of thÂ» mining
Industry of the Cnited States are now looked
after by different bureaus, under different de
partments, with different heads; and
Whereas. It is the opinion of this associa
tion that the beet Interests of the miner would
be subserved by having an Industry which has
grown in annual product from S3O.310.3C0 In
1SS0 to 51.066,329,521 In 1901. represented by
a Commissioner of Mines and Mining under
whatever department Congress may determine;
and
Whereas. It if perfectly well understood that
from 1S67 to 1S78 there was a Government
Commissioner of Mines acd Mining whe*^ duty
It was to collect statibtics, historical and tech
nical rr.atter relating to mining, which offlo
was abolished at the end of 1ST6; but It Is
recognized that at that time the general min
ing industry was of small Importance as com
pared with the present conditions when its
product is, worth over f 1.000, 000.000 yearly;
and *
Whereas upon the abolition of that office
th* United' States Mint. United States Geologi
cal Survey and United States Census, took
consideration of these matters relating to min
ing, s.nd have since continued, while the
United States Land Office has b-en in charge
of matters connected with mineral land loca
tions, mineral patents and titles.
Johnson said that he was at a meet
ing in Pioneer Hall in this city called
by men interested in mining, who stat
ed that they desired to forever burn
on the altar of. friendship any feelings
existing between the miner and the
farmer. He nominated the first pres
ident of the California Miners' "Associa
tion. It was because of the , feeling
that time that he had to eliminate the
feeling between the farmer and the
IS OF NO INFLUENCE.
Continuing, Grove L. Johnson said:
A question of hydraulic mining is one that
appeals directly to every man living In or own-
Ing probity in thÂ» valley. I live in the valley,
and what property I have is in the valley.
There is no member of this convention. I take
it. that would desire to injure my property.
There Is no member of this convention, I think,
that would desire to Injure the property of any
other resident or taxpayer In the valley. There
fore, taking that as a premise, let us go fur
ther. If this association as an association and
as Individuals would not wish to do that, why
find fault with men for protecting themselves?
Self-preservation Is the first law of nature, and
those people living In the valley are endeavoring
to protect themselves from what they think
is an injury. . > -
They have organized an association, as they
have a right to do. I understand that this as
sociation of miners is not receiving either
State or Federal aid, or that this association
stand? ucon a higher right and better plane
than the Anti-Debris Association. You repre
sent, as you think, the Interests of the miners
of the State. They, the Anti-Debris Associa
tion, represent, as they think, the interests of
the people of the valley, who have been injured
In thÂ« past, who are being . Injured now by
hydraulic. mining. Is.lt any wonder that they
are seeking to protect themselves? Wouldn't
you do it? Is there a man here who wouldn't
do it.'
ATTACKS THE RESOLUTION.
Are they as Individuals to be forbidden, ac
cording to the resolution â are the people rep
resenting the Anti-Debris Association not to
be permitted to go Into court? Is It seriously
contended by this association that you desire
to throw the weight of your- Influence, the
power that you have, in favor of a rule that
shall pay to a man: Tou must not seek the
courts of your country to obtain redress for
your wrong? Is there anything wrong in a
man going into court? If so, then every mem
ber of this association has been guilty of
wrong, and the chairman, my worthy friend,
the chairman of the committee on resolutions,
has undoubtedly been guilty of wrongdoing in
the t>ast, for, as I understand, he has some
times been engaged In litigation.
Mr. Johnson said that he had been
in law, but the law that he had been
in had helped him. The delegates en-
Joyed this sally and laughed. Without
stopping, Mr. Johnson went on to say:
Is there anything wrong in a man going Into
court when he don't ask the courts of his coun
try to protect him In wrongdoing; when he sim
ply seeks to prevent what hÂ« claims to bÂ«
wrongdoing? That Is all there Is of it. gen
tlemen; that s all there is of It.
There Is no necessity for us to go Into a his
tory of the litigation; there is no necessity for
us to go Into a resume of the acts that led up
to the litigation In hydraulic mining In this
State. The fact remains that there has been
Htieation; the fact remains that the Judgments
of the courts have been uniformly In favor of
preventing a man from Injuring the property of
other men. Isn't that so? ' Does any man ob
ject to It? And yet. by the adoption of these
resolutions, as It seem* to me. you are saying
that a man has no right to go into court.
RISES TO POINT OF ORDER.
C. H. Dunton, president of the El
Dorado County Miners' Association,
rose to a point of order and said:
"I understand that the question be
fore this convention is the adoption of
the report of the committee as a whole.
Does the speaker object to the entire
report, or does he object to some sec
tion of it?"
"I object to some section," replied
Mr. Johnson.
"I want to get the section." said
Dunton- "This is a question of the
adoption of the whole report of the
committee."
Belshaw ruled that the point of order
was not well taken.
Judge Belcher said: "Mr. Chairman,
I move an amendment to the report of
the committee on resolutions â to that
portion referring to the Anti-Debris
Association; I move that that portion
be stricken from the report."
Mr. Dunton seconded the motion.
JOHNSON AGAIN SPEAKS.
Johnson then continued:
As I was savin?, is it wrong for a man to go
into court to protect himself against what he
deems to be wrong? It is not a question
whether a man is right or wrong; It is not a
question as to whether the court will or will
not sustain his complaint; it is simply a ques
tion of whether or not a man has a right to go
Into the courts of his country. Now, that Is
all.
Now, it strikes me that you are doing
wrong in asserting it; it strikes me that you
are permitting yourselves unnecessarily to oc
casion the antagonism of other people in Cali
fornia, because, you know and I know and we
all know that a license issued by any power,
no matter what body or what board. Is not
sufficient to permit a man to do wrong. It
does not mean that a man may act not In ac
cordance with the terms of the license. Peo
ple sometimes' get a license, but it does not
give them the right to do as they please. The
courts have uniformly said that if they don't
conduct themselves in accordance with tho
law of the land ths license will be taken from
them.
DEFENDS VALLEY RIGHTS.
Now, this resolution deprecates the attempts
of the people living In the valley to protect
themselves against the acts of other people
who are not complying with the law. or their
licenses. Is that wrcng?- Tou deprecate, the
attempt of men who are seeking to protect
their property who are going Into court legally
and properly. It cannot be claimed by any
body that this Anti-Debris Association has re
sorted to force. You cannot claim, as a mat
ter of fact, that they have at any time en
gaged in a violent ! and tumultuous manner.
and have gathered their friends and marched
by the bundteds and thousands to redress
their wrongs. No. they have acted always In
a peaceable and peaceful manner, simply go-
Ing Into the courts of the land asking the
courts to protect them in the enjoyment of
their property, their property being an
sacred to them as ycur property is sacred
to you: their property being like the poperty
owned by most of the miners, all the property
that they have: and, as I understand this
resolution, you find fault with them for going
into court: you Indorse the action of men who
have violated the law. you disapprove of - the
action of men who are seeking to uphold the
law. Tou are sowing tho wind and you will
reap the whirlwind.
QUESTION APPEALS TO AIL.
A motion was put and seconded to
accept the report of the committee and
adopt the resolutions, when Grove L.
Johnson caught the eye of President
Belshaw. Instantly the entire house
was alive with interest. Johnson pro
ceeded deliberately to the work that he
had in hand. Having been recognized,
he began to speak in a conversational
tone. He said first that he wished to
say a few words about the resolutions
and desired to say at the outset that he
was not and never had been the agent
or attorney of the Anti-Debris Associa
tion, and never expected to be, and was
not even a member of the association.
He was Dresent as the representative
of the Sacramento Chamber of Com
merce, a body organized by the mer
chants, manufacturers and taxpayers
of Sacramento and who were Interested
not merely In the welfare of the city.
but in that of the State. He said that
It occurred to him that It would be
better for the miners' convention "not
to indulge in unnecessary antagonism,
nor to provoke unnecessarily a conflict
and not to take up the conflicts of
other people and make them the con
tests of the association"

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Nov. 18.
âHonduras is at present on the verge
of anarchy and conditions are such
that a revolution may break out at
any time. The Governmental party
was completely overwhelmed, at the re
cent elections and the opposition con
trols the legislative branch of the Gov
ernment. Consequently any measure
favored by the administration is voted
down and dissatisfaction is strongly on
the increase.
The reported Intention of Nicaragua
and Guatemala to unite against Hon
duras, while apparently unfounded, has
had the effect of adding to the general
apprehension. If' Guatemala were ,io'
take the offensive she would be : ln'/a
position to cause much trouble, as- she
maintains a large force on the Hondu
ran border. The reason : for this is
given as the fear that Salvador has der
signs on Guatemala and the force is
kept ready to resist any invasion.

promptly dismissed. It being shown that
the officer did his duty In arresting the
complaint on a charge of drunkenness.
Charges against Patrolman Archie Ham

Bennett put on several witnesses as to
his character and himself denied all of
the allegations. The case was then sub

The case of Policeman Joseph E. Ben
nett, charged with having intimated to
Goor&e R- Simpson, a saloon-keeper on
Mission Ftreot, that he should pay pro
tection money to Sergeant Wolf, was
called before the Police Commission last
night. Simpson said that Bennett had
approafched him on three occasions and
advised him to "see" Wolf previous to
the time he paid the sergeant any money.
He also says that after the charges had
been brought against Wolf the patrolman
came to him and asked him not to drag
him into the case. Simpson says he
promised Bennett that he would not.
Harry GUson, a bartender, testified that
he heard the latter conversation, and the
prosecution rested.

T. Hays will be called upon to make
a settlement with the Orange Growers'
National Bank as well as to the San
Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Com
pany. The amount Involved is $2000
and is In connection with a Salt Lake
land deal, in which B. B. Bush, a real
estate dealer here, figures as principal.
Bush was in possession of a piece of
land needed in the Salt' Lake right-of

obvious reasons, preferred to deal di
rectly with J. Ross Clark. Clark's of
fer of $7750 was accepted, a deposit of
$500 having been previously made with
the Orange Growers' National Bank to
cover the option.
The contracts covering the full pur
chase price were by Major Diss for

later he was informed that $7750 was
awaiting his delivery of deeds at the
Orange Growers' National Bank. When
Bush went for his money Hays told
him that there was but $5750 on deposit,
a shortage of $2000, but Bush was not
standing for any such holdup, as he

The Board of State Prison Directors
held an interesting session in this city
yesterday at the offices of Director R.
M. Fitzgerald. Ex-Senator Archibald
Yell attended the conference and was
practically recognized as the Warden
elect of Folsom prison. The board will
meet at Folsom next Saturday and
make official record of Mr. Yell's elec
tion. All the members of the board
attended the meeting yesterday.
There was a free interchange of views
regarding the future management of
affairs at Folsom, and while the Direct
ors do not apprehend that the retire
ment of 'Warden Wilkinson and the In
duction into office of his successor will
be followed by sweeping changes . of
subordinate attaches, the opinion is ex T
pressed that the new Warden will have
a free hand to make such appointments
as he deems essential to the enforce
ment of proper discipline in the prison.
There are rumors to the effect that
Captain Murphy will not be retained
by the new Warden, and there are also
reports to the effect that several guards
who were recently discharged will be
reinstated. The Directors and the War
den-elect are in accord on the general
proposition that worthy and capable
officers shall be retained.
Several weeks ago one Beach La
Salle, who had been the dead miner's
partner, and wag executor of his will,
visited In Oakland and vicinity, mak
ing a search for Miss Redford, but he
returned to Victoria without locating
her. The quest, however, aroused in
terest among a number of people and
the obiect of La Salle's search was
brought to light in the person of Miss
Redford. HÂ£r affairs were placed in
the hands of Attorney George E. Jack
son of this city, who is In communica
tion with the Probate Court authorities
at Victoria for light on the situation.
Neither the attorney, 'nor Mrs. Hal
lahan, nor the Interested Miss Redford
have been yet advised In detail, nor do
any of them feel ready yet to take the
news with that'posltlveness which com
plete Investigation might permit.
It la as the sole beneficiary under
the will of one Carlson, a miner who
"struck It rich" In the Northwest, that
Miss Redford figures as the legatee of
the departed prospector's pots of gold.
But behind that Is the memory of an
old sweetheart that lay buried In this
miner's heart, for, the story runs,
Carlson loved this girl's mother many
years ago and after learning of his
old sweetheart's death decided to be
queath his fortune to her child. All
of this is yet under the Inquiry of legal
Investigators -who have been trying to
ravel the maze of mystery in which the
tale is clouded, for want of precise veri
fication.
Miss Redford is motherless, and her
father, "William Redford, has by Illness
been long Incapacitated. The girl eight
years ago was given in charge of Mrs.
Hallahan, who, with the parents* con

done. My efforts on' behalf of the Salt
Lake road have been constant, honest
and untiring and the present unfor
tunate condition will always be to me
a source of the deepest regret."

"I could not tell what the plan of
his enemies was. I knew that they
were liable to do almost anything.- , I
sent the correspondence to my chief
clerk at Los Angeles with Instructions
to show the same to Mr. Hays, who
returned the correspondence absolutely
unsealed and by the same Instructions
he kept the correspondence for me un
til I did return. When accused by Mr.
Gibbon of giving Mr. Hays advance in
formation as to his. being, under in
vestigation I promptly told him and
Mr. Clark without equivocation iwhat
I had done and explained to them pre
cisely what I have stated here. I stated
PROTESTS HIS INNOCENCE.
"The question of my alleged violation
of my duty to the company in 'surrep
titiously' conveying to Mr. Hays copies
of correspondence had between myself
and Mr.), Gibbon in Salt Lake City,
which it is stated was sought to be ob
tained, as I was given to understand,
for information to assist in investigat
ing charges of fraud against Mr. Hays,
Is one Involving the high sense of re
gard in which I had always held that
gentleman. I had known him most In
timately and had always found him
honest and straight-forward. I was
connected with him fraternally and had
always been a welcome guest at his
home. For a long time in the city of
Riverside, to my certain knowledge,
there had been a concerted effort on
the part of his political enemies to
break down the political prestige whfch
he held. I had been acquainted with
many of his political dealings, and
know that while he had many strong
friends, being an active politician, he
likewise had many enemies, and in nu
merous cases had my attention been
attracted to their efforts against him.
"The correspondence to which Mr.
Gibbon refers was a request for in
formation as to 'an arrangement made
with Mr. Hays when he first began to
be an adviser in Riverside matters. Mr.
Gibbon, without any preliminaries, re
ferred to his understanding of Mr.
Hays' relations to the c6mpany and
asked me to advise him if he was cor
rect. I did this immediately. He then
suggested that he would write a letter
embodying the same request and would
ask -that I reply in writing, as he
stated, to keep the record straight in
so far as the right of way department
was concerned, should it be necessary
to establish our standing in this re
gard. The letters were written. Some
two weeks before it had been reported
to me in Los Angeles that Mr. Hays'
political enemies were making a united
effort to wrest from him his power in
the county of Riverside, and before
leaving for Salt Lake City I took oc
casion to ask two of our mutual friends
to see him on his return from the East
and to warn him that his political ene
mies were up and doing.
"I had no .reason to believe but
the reports I had obtained were
entirely accurate and subsequently re
ceived no Information from the peo
ple of my company that Mr. Hays' ac
tion in so far as the handling' of the
right* â¢ of way were under considera
tion. It therefore appeared to me pe\V
fectly natural ths-t, following out tha
line o'f policy which I always en
deavored to follow in political matters,
I should advise him â¢ precisely of
what I had done In regard to making
the statement as to his connection with
the company.
As to the charges made by Real
Estate Agent B. B. Bush of Riverside,
Diss declares that Bush Is actuated
by personal malice because his land
was not purchased. Diss denies that
he was ever present when any person
suggested that the prices of real estate
be raised and it sold to the company at
the advanced prica As to his alleged
failure to investigate certain matters
referred to him and reported to contain
fraud, he says he' did investigate, made
his report, and that his superiors were
satisfied with what he had . done.
Throughout the term of his employ
ment he says he was In a subordinate
position and that he simply recom
mended such' action as was taken by
the company. As-to^his having be
trayed the /fact that' an Investigation
was in progress to Hays,, he says:
EXPLAINS HIS POSITION.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18.â A climax
was reached to-day in the investigation
of the land frauds in the Salt Lake
Railroad Company's right of way de
partment, when, after having waited
for more than a week for Major Diss,
the head of that department, to take
some action. Vice President Gibbon
sent Diss a letter notifying him that he
was no longer In the employ of the
company. The action by the officials
caused no surprise. Diss knew that it
was coming, and. answering Gibbon's
letter, he demanded that some reason
be set forth for the dismissal. Reply
ing to this, Gibbon sent him a caustic
letter detailing the several reasons
that had prompted the company to take
the action It had taken and charging
that Diss had been derelict in his du
ties. After midnight to-night Diss is
sued a statement of his connection with
the land frauds, this being the first
time that he has vouchsafed any in
formation whatever. -His statement Is
the first that has come from any of
those interested in the deals other than
the officials who were investigating
them. He enters Into details as to al
most every transaction which has -been
mentioned since the discovery of the
scandal. The burden of it is, and it is
stated with all possible emphasis, that
he did not know that Hays was "graft-
Ing."

Attorney Ach filed an affidavit In re
ply, in w ; hich he alleged that he did
not request Herman or Jacob Eppinger
to be called before the Grand Jury,
but he did request, after they had been
subpenaed, that if they were to be
called they be called without delay.
District Attorney Byington had filed
an affidavit in answer to the affidavit
of Herman Eppinger, in which he al
leged that Attorney Ach had repeatedly
urged him to have the Eppingers called
before the Grand Jury as he was anx
ious that they should have a hearing
as speedily as possible. He further be
lieved that Ach had sent word to W. J.
Bryan, foreman of the Grand Jury, to
call the Eppingers before that body.
The District Attorney also alleged that
Herman Eppinger did not Inform him
that be had appeared before the Grand
Jury against his will, and further that
the District Attorney was not called
upon nor was it his duty to inform
Eppinger that he was to be sworn In
an investigation before the Grand Jury
concerning his acts or doings or the
acts or doings of any other person; that
Eppinger was not compelled to answer
any question, nor was he directed or
requested to answer any question the
answer to which he claimed might tend
to Incriminate him.
The argument on the motion of Her
man Eppinger of the bankrupt firm of
Eppfnger & Co., charged with obtaining
money by false pretenses, to quash the
indictment against him on the ground
of irregular proceedings before the
Grand Jury was to have been made be
fore Judge Lawlor yesterday, but It
was postponed till next Tuesday morn
ing.
When the case was called Attorney
Henry Ach, for the defendant, said he
was ill with a cold and his colleague,
Peter F. Dunne, was engaged in a case
In another court. He therefore asked
that the argument on the motion be
postponed. Attorney J. C. Campbell,
who has been engaged as special coun
sel on behalf of the people, said he waa
satisfied that the facts as set forth in
the motion were not sufficient to quash
the Indictment, but he had no objection
to the postponement. He would insist,
however, that the matter should rest
on the facts as stipulated, to which
Ach agreed.
Nearly thirty Inmates of Herman's
Place, a cheap lodging-house at 26
Steuart street, narrowly escaped death
by fire shortly after midnight this
morning. The police were active in
their rescue work, and their outcries
awakened the sleepers. Officer Barry
discovert-d the flames leaping through
the roof of the two-story structure,
and he turned In an alarm from box 34.
Sergeant Cook and Officer Hays rushed
to the house and attempted to go up
stairs, but were driven, back by the
flames. The inmates rushed everywhere
to eeek an exit. Many climbed out the
windows and were helped down by
l-assing people.
While the fire was at lta height "W. P.
Herman, proprietor of the lodging
house, attempted to rush upstairs to
rescue his wife and children, but was
prevented by the police. The children
were rescued by some of the lodgers,
and Mrs. Herman was carried out of
the burning structure through a win
dow.
The firemen made short work of the
blaze when they arrived on the scene.
They broke the skylights and cut holes
In the roof and poured streams of
water into the building.
John Richter. one of the lodgers, was
asleep nrben the alarm of fire awak
ened him. He grabbed a few clothes
and fouprht his way through the smoke
to the stairway and escaped. He feared
others mipht be In the house, but a
search of the premises showed that all
had escaped.
Dave Dent's Isaloon suffered from
smoke and water, as did also the prem
ises occupied by John A. Whelan, ship
wright.
His services, as alleged In his com
plaint, consisted of visiting and In
specting different mining properties
and giving advice regarding them. He
made two visits to Mexico, he says.
He also took a hand in trying to settle
the dispute that haa existed between
Sam Irvine and Senator Fair In the
famous controversy over the Morgan
mine. Besides these there were many
other services which he claims he per
formed. He fil^d his claim with the
executors of the Charges L. Fair estate
on July 16, 1903, and on September 24,
1903, his claim was rejected.
Now he comes forward with his suit
and, according to the statement- of his
attorney, Benjamin Healey, feels very
confident that he will recover from" the
estate what he claims is coming to
him.
In his complaint Rooney does not
contend that any actual contract ex
isted between himself and Fair, but he
states he was always ready and will
ing to be called upon to give advice
and that he gave 'it for six years.
Thomas H. Rooney brought suit yes
terday against the estate of Charles L.
Fair for $75,000. Rooney is the only
brother of the late Mrs. James G. Fair,
and consequently was uncle to Charles
L. Fair. He bases his claim on ser
vices he alleges he performed for Fair,
beginning from August 30, 1896, : and
covering the intervening period until
May, 1902.
ONCE A FAVORITE,
BUT NOW INSANE
Henry EÂ« Huntington, vice president
of the Southern Pacific Company and
the dominating figure in Southern Cal
ifornia's electric car system, is up
from Los Angeles and yesterday di
vided his time between the office of
General Manager Kruttschnitt of the
railroad and that of A. B. Hammond,
the lumber king and confidential man
of E. H. Harriman on this coast. The
purpose of Huntington's visit to the
railroad offices was to consult with
Kruttschnitt regarding the proposed
trip of the Southern Pacific officials to
Salt Lake next week to meet Harri
man and other officers of the road, who
are to assemble there and make the
initial trip over the new Lucin cut-off.
Huntington, aa vice president of the
Southern Pacific will go to Salt Lake
and return to this city with President
Harriman.
Shortly after Huntington left the
railroad building yesterday General
Manager Kruttschnitt sent word to the
heads of the different departments of
the corporation that they would be ex
pected to leave here In a special train
Tuesday evening for Ogden, which they
will reach Thursday, a few hours in
advance of Harriman's party, and with
the officials of the Union Pacific and
other roads will accompany the presi
dent of the Southern Pacific westward.
Among those who will accompany Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt eastward on
Tuesday will be Manager James Agler,
Freight Traffic Manager "William
Sproule, General Freight Agent G. W.
Luce, Chief Counsel "William F. Herrin,
General Passenger Agent T. H. Good
man and possibly a number of minor
local officials of the road. Passenger
Traffic Manager E. O. McCormlck, who
is now in the East, will accompany
Traffic Manager Stubbs and other high
officials of the Harriman lines west
ward from Chicago.
Henry E. Huntington's visit to A. B.
Hammond's office yesterday was in con
nection with their interests in North
ern California. It has lately developed
that Huntington has become interested
with Hammond in nearly all the lat
ter's enterprises In Northern Califor
nia, and with Hammond is now plan
ning to gridiron the northern part of
the State with electric roads on a simi
lar but smaller scale to that of the
Huntington-Hellman syndicate lines in
Southern California.
For months Huntington agents have
been quietly acquiring' holdings in the
electric roads In that * section of the
State, and. while this work has been
going on representatives of Hammond
have been secretly outlining extensions
and planning for rights, of way through
the more developed districts. These
roads when built will converge toward
points along the Southern Pacific Com
pany's lines, thus furnishing tributa
ries to the big Harriman system. Har
riman has been made to appreciate the
fact, since he and H. E. Huntington
patched up their differences in the
south, that electric roads are to cut an
Important figure in the future railroad
traffic of the country, and he has en
tered heartily into the plans of Hunt
ington to get hold of everything in
sight for the development of these
roads before rival corporations can en
ter the field.
TELEPHONE GIRL
AS AN HEIRESS
Suit has recently been brought
against General Charles P. Eagan..
U. S. A., by Mrs. Kate J. Black and
George W. Jackson, both of New York,
for $111,700 and $69,000, respectively.
General Eagan formed a company and
bought coal lands in July, 1901. The
company was Incorporated In Arizona
with a capital of $1,500,000. General
Eagan's contract with the Mexican
owners of the land provided that If
the Interest was not paid the property
should revert to the original owners.
After $300,000 was spent in development
the mines were abandoned. Foreclosure
followed, which made the American
bonds worthless, hence the suits to re
cover from General Eagan and other
directors.

A great volume of applause followed
Gompers' speech, and the rollcall re
sulted 12S3 in favor- and' 2185 against,
which meant that the convention had
refused to commit itself to socialism.
The announcement was hailed with
cheers. ""â¢
President Gompers defended the po
sition of Vice President Duncan, who
had been attacked by Carey. Gompers
pointed out that a vote for the resolu
tion would be construed by the world
as an indorsement of socialism. Gom
pers became very earnest, and even
bitter, in his argument against social
ism, and was interrupted frequently
from the floor. In closing he said:
"It would be a sad day, indeed,"
Mitchell concluded, "if trades unions
were made the tail end of a political
organization."
Delegate Carey addressed the conven
tion, making an extended argument in
favor of socialism.
John Mitchell, president of the United
Mine "Workers, said he thought It -a
great mistake If socialist friends at
tempted to commit the labor move
ment to the principles which they be
lieved.
Charles Lavia of Wilkesbarre argued
that there was something wrong. with
the body politic and that socialism
would cure the evil.
BOSTON, Nov. 18.â Discussion of the
question as to whether the American
Federation of Labor should place itself
on record as favoring socialism was re
sumed to-day at the convention of that
organization, and the proposition was
ultimately defeated. ?
D. "W. Richmond, president of the
Railway Clerks' International Associa
tion, declared during the debate that
his organization would withdraw If the
federation adopted socialistic ideas.
Federation of Labor
Denies Them Its In
dorsement.
Shafroth (D.) of Colorado added his
opposition" to "Â¦ the bill, saying lt was
undemocratic * and unrepublican and
fraught with danger to American In
dustries. He said plans had been pre
pared for beet sugar; plants in his
State, which would have risen If this
legislation had not been proposed. He
said the ' measure was unfair, and un
just to a growing industry.
But to pursue the dirty . aad surreptitious
methods (the facts concernlns which had - to
be dragxed out of Thurber's throat ia a Senate
committee) U disgraceful and ruinous -to any
administration under the sun. - No wonder
postofflce . thievery obtains in the land when
such acts as that can be notoriously done In
open " sunlight and " nobody comments upon
such political thievery. -
This means,' stripped of all vertlaye and the
bare facts stated.' that $20,000 was appropriated
from the Cuban rands on vouchers issued by
Leonard Wood, indorsed by the War Depart
ment of: this administration, reciting on t&elr
faces that they were for the purpose of Influ
encing cubllc ODlnlon in the United States in
favor of. this bill.
Gardner (R.) of Michigan explained
why he had changed his views and
now favors the passage of the bill. In
the first place, conditions had changed
in . the last two years. â¢ He said the
president of a beet sugar plant in -his
district favored the bill.
Buj-gess (D.) of Texas characterized
the bill as an outrage. Reading an ex
tract from an article written by Thom
as B. Reed, Burgess said:
Bell (D.) of California followed In
opposition to the bill, saying the farm
ers of his State wanted the same meas
ure of protection now afforded them
and he urged that the beet sugar grow
ers needed the protection. He said the
Republicans who felt so certain that
California would be in the Republican
column should go to that State and see

said, until the Senator has appeared

WASHINGTON, -Jov. 18.â A big ef
fort is to be made this winter by the
steamship Interests of the United States
to have Congress extend ito the Philip

statutes restricting to . of the
United States all trade" carried on be
tween this country and the Philippines.
A. R. Smith, president of the Maritime
Exchange of New York. Alfred Wind
sor of the Boston Steamship Company,
Representative' Littlefleld of Maine,
Fields S. Peridleton and Mr. Lucken
bach were at the War Department to
day making Inquiries as to the attitude
which will be taken by the Government
toward such legislation.
The Philippine Government is strong
ly opposed to the extension of the Unit
ed States coastwise laws to the Philip
pines at this time. The tariff bill passed
by Congress in 1902 provides that the
steamship coastwise law should not be
applicable In the Philippines to foreign
vessels engaging In trade between the
Philippine archipelago and the United
States or between ports In the Philip
pine archipelago until July 1, 1904.
Information was received at the War
Department to-day that a strong Brit
ish lobby intends taking part In the
fight this winter for the purpose of try
ing to have an extension granted so as
to favor British vessels engaged In the
Philippine trade. At the same time the
shipping interests of this country have
announced their Intention to seek legis
lation from Congress specifically ex
tending the United States coastwise law
to all vessels plying between this coun
try and the Philippines after July 1,

SOCIALISTS LOSE
ON TEST VOTE
"WASHINGTON, Nov. IS.â Secretary
Moody to-day announced his decision
in the matter of the protest of Pay
master H. -E. Blscoe against the lan
guage used by Rear Admiral Evans,
commander in chief of the Asiatic Sta
' tion, in reviewing the result of the
i court martial of Assistant Paymaster
Nichols.
After ruling that Rear Admiral
Evans, as the convening and review
ing- authority of the court martial in
question, was within the limits of his
authority in criticising the finding of
not guilty upon the third charge, and
pronouncing the sentence inadequate,
and in bis criticism and animadversion
upon the court. Secretary Moody says,
in conclusion:
"It is not to be inferred from this
decision that, although the power of
censure by the reviewing authority by
courts martial is clearly shown to exist
by an unbroken practice of many
years, it should be indiscriminately ex
ercised. " It Is to be kept in mind that
members of courts martial must be in
dependent in their action and are\not
subject to control. It is to be regretted
that an occasion has arisen which in
the Judgment of the reviewing author
ity demanded so severe censure as was
inflicted in this case. Nevertheless, as
the members of the courts must be the
Judges of the measure of their duty,
so the reviewing authority must be the
judge oi the measure of his duty.
While the exercise of the discretion of
the reviewing authority is uncontroll
able, there is a clear remedy for an
abuse of it. If it should appear in any
case that, in the exercise of his au
thority of reviewing the proceedings
of courts martial .convened by him, a
commander In chief had acted capri
ciously, cruelly, with evident lack of
Judgment, or from Improper motives;
in short, if he had shown himself unfit
to be entrusted with the authority
which the law attaches to his position,
the department has the power to with
hold from him that authority in the
future by recalling him^from' his sta
tion. It Is, however, considered that
in this Instance, Rear Admiral Evans
has not shown himself unworthy of the
continued confidence of the departmenL
On the contrary, in view of the evi
dence before the court without weigh
ing too nicely the terms of his censure,
it Is believed that he was actuated by
a high sense of duty and Inspired by a
regard for the honor and welfare of the
service." , ;

Answering a statement made by

"Immediately upon the election of

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â The oppo
sition to the Cuban bill was heard in
the House to-day In vigorous speeches.
The features of the day were tie
speeches of Grosvenor of Ohio, who
opened the discussion in advocacy of
the bill, and Fordney (R.) of Michigan,
who spoke in opposition. Among others
who spoke in opposition to the bill
were Shafroth (D.) of Colorado and
Bell . (D.) of California. The tfebate
will close to-morrow and a vote will
be taken not later than 4 p. m.
' Grosvenor, who led off to-day,
prefaced his remarks by saying that,
while the debate had taken a ; wide
range, he regretted that there had been
no discussion on the other side of the
House of the Panama canal , question.
In this connection, he said, the position
of the administration was unassailable
and would redound to the glory of 'the
American people.
Grosvenor said he would not permit
his vote on this .question to be chal
lenged as affecting his attitude on the
dominant' question of protection of
American industries. Speaking on tar
iff revision, he said the Republicans
would revise the schedule when they
got ready to do so arid in their own
way, without any aid from the opposite
side of, the House, and that the revis
ion would be with special reference to
the upbuilding of American industries
without disturbing present conditions.

inVililllllliu^n Jto tut**ruZdutTHE American Federation of Labor proposes that when
the isthmian canal is dug the work shall be done by
American labor, and that this shall be provided for by
law. For climatic and unchangeable physical reasons, this
would mean that no canal will ever be dug. The isthmus is of
low altitude and has nothing to relieve the tropical conditions
of the climate. American labor cannot live there, nor under
tropical conditions anywhere. To send it to the isthmus to
toil would be sending it to sure death.
Men have not forgotten the mortality that attended the
construction of the Panama railroad, although the labor em
ployed was native or coolie. The work on the canal will be
much more arduous, "and with permission to use even the
tropical races it will be found difficult to get a sufficient sup
ply that is even partially immune to the deadly heat and dews
and damps of> that region. Workers from the temperate
zone, and especially from the United States, cannot resist the
fatai influences of the climate. So many! experiments have
been made, from the Darien scheme until recent times, that
no one. need go astray as. to the ; physical conditions under
which the canal must be du$f.'
The climate of Hawaii is much more favorable than that of
the isthmus. Indeed it is probably the most favorable of all
the tropical" climates. But Americans cannot j work in the
cane fields of Maui, nor. elsewhere in that territory. The
American population of Hawaii is steadily decreasing,^ which
means, that those who went there expecting to ; maintain
themselves by manual labor are compelled to retire, surren
dering to the imperious influences of the climate.
As the proposition of the Federation means an obstruction
to the canal. work instead of facilitating it, we hope the labor
leiders will make ah examination : of the climatic facts and
change their plans in that â¢particular. ; It: will be found that
the expert overseers,' the .engineers and official representa
tives whose presence on the isthmus will be necessary during
the period of construction, although able to , relieve them-'
selves somewhat, as laborers -cannot, of the ill effects of cli
mate, wil| have to frequently resort to the temperate rone/ to
recuperate from the exhausting impairment of strength 'due'
"to the tropical Heat arid moisture! . V
It ; is probable that some newspapers will support the 'de
lusion that American labor can stand the; climate, but this
will be done either, for demagogic purposes; or to delay the
work, " in 'the interest : of aritagonistic^combmatiana* . T^c
WORK ON THE ISTHMUS.
For instance, the man who marries
a fool usually becomes lowered in
ideals and mentality. The woman who
marries a boor sinks to his level or else
raises him nearer to hers.
The question of marriage grows year
ly more complex. "Society's double
standard of ethics for man and :, for
woman is cruelly hard upon . the * lat
ter. Were the same code made appli
cable to both the aspect of marital life
would undergo a "vast transformation
for the better.. In the meantime choice

ence , to' the good old maxim, ; "Bear*and
forbear,"- willjdo \ much "to, r save- count
less married 'couj>les a lifetime of* mla
er 3v"" " , - â¢ .. -/ vâ _
The happiest unions are found where
both husband and wife have intellect.
Man and wife, by constantly living to
gether, have such a strong effect each
on the formation of the other's char
acter that it is surprising this point of
view Is not of tener considered before
alliances are entered upon. Each mod
ifies the other's characteristics and per
sonality. After a few years this change
in personality is often apparent to
every one.
Similarity of tastes and pursuits is
the firmest foundation for that preca
rious- structure known as matrimonial
alliance. Self-control, too, is a domi
nant factor In household peace, and
this is found to a much . greater de
gree among intellectual ami highly ed
ucated people than among those of a
lower order of mind. An intellectual
couple defer to and value each other's
opinions, and each gives up to a cer
tain extent his or her personal opin
ions, prejudices and plans.
I do not, therefore, believe in the the
ory that persons of like tendencies
should not marry. There can be no
Ideal married state between people of
widely separate interests and attain
ments.
"You admire Miss -V I once said
to a man of the world. "Why don't you
marry her?"
â " M y d *ar Mrs. Blake," he laughed,
she is far too handsome. A diamond
Is fine to look on, but one would find
far more safety and real companionship
with a collie dog."
Common sense is a strong factor In
married happiness, , and the intellectu
al woman knows best when and how
to yield in matters of real importance
and does not magnify trivialtles.
Men are always attracted by a pretty
face, but the wiser among them do not
want to marry a woman who will be
too attractive to other men.
Unhapplness in married life is most
often due to lack of communlty^of in
terest between man and wife. The man
of literary tastes cannot find an en
during companion in the mindless but
terfly of fashion. The woman who
keeps abreast of the times cannot long
be interested In the society 'of the hus
band who shares none of her Interests
and amusements. And this brings me
to the '* oft-vexed, never-quite-solved
problem:
"Does a man prefer a pretty wife or
an intellectual one?"
While the two qualities are by no
means Incompatible. I maintain that
the chances of the intellectual woman
far outclass those of her prettier but
shallower sister. *
There may or may not be a modi
cum of truth in the lad's blundering
assertion and in .the father's doubting
Indorsement. At any rate there can be
no doubt that on two points hang all
the difference between married happi
ness and married purgatory. These
two requlsities to happy conjugal life
are mutual affection and unselfishness.
The former of course Includes sympa
thy in tastes, and with this it is my
Intention to deal. â¢
A great source of misery is the draw-
Ing tog-ether through a brief attraction
of two people who have nothing in
common on which to build a regard
and respect which Bhall endure when
the Ignis fatuus of mere infatuation
shall haVe burned itself out.
In cases of "this sort, if there are no
children, it maj' be. eminently proper
that the husband and wife separate
when the marriage bonds gall unbear
ably, but where there are children- this
condition changes "and forbearance
must be practiced. The household
must not be broken up. -Better live
on together in mutual misery than to
rob your children of the home ties that
are inalienably theirs.
"Hush, brother!" counseled . the
father superior. "Perchance the child
is right."
"No, no!" gasped the hprrifled cate
chist. "you have given the definition of
purgatory."
In a modern washing plant the coal
(s lifted to the top of the high building
und dumped on screens, which divide
it into its several sizes. The nut coal
falls into the jigs, but the fine coal
finds its way into a trough of running
water. After the nut coal Is. Jigged it
Is 4ellvercd to a bumping screen, which
carries it along until the water escapes,
and then the clean -apt coal falls, in to
But the improved washers use a "Jig"
for separating the foreign matters from
the coal. This is a large box having
two compartments. In one a plunger
w orks up and down, forcing water,
which fills the compartments under the
partitionâ which comes but half-way
down from the topâ up through the
ecreen which forms the bottom of the
other compartment. The waterâ worked
up and down by the churning motion
has enough force to lift the coal as it
is fed into the Jig, but not enough to
more than agitate the impurities. This
action separates the coal from the for
eign matter, moving the coal through
the opening provided and working the
refuse to a hole near the center, where
it falls into a box to be carried off by
a screw conveyor.
The simplest appliance used for wash
lnc coal Is the trough washer. It is
an open-end box, set on a slant. The
coal, carried through a flume with the
water, runs into the higher end. The
heavier impurities sink to the bottom,
but the lighter coal, swept along by
the swift current, is caught by the
boards of a conveyor which moves
against the stream and Is lifted out of
the trough.
The "bumping table," another form
of washer, is a wooden trough about
S Inches deep. 8 feet long and 2% feet
wide, which is bumped at regular in
tervals against a post at the higher
end. The water and coal enter at the
upper end, and when the table is
bumped the impurities are Jolted uphill
and the water carries the clean coal
off the lower end.
When there is more than thirty
pounds of sulphur, in the form of iron
pyrites, sulphate of lime and magnesia
or organic sulphur, In a ton of bitumin
ous coal it is not good fuel. The iron
pyrites occur sometimes In solid dense
. lumps which are easily separated from
the coal by "washing:." But when the
iron pyrites take the form of thin
flales, liberally Eprinkled through the
mass, it floats away with the good coal
%.nd is not easily removed. The thin,
white sheets seen in some coal is sul
phate of lime, and when It Is found In
small parts scattered In the coal it is a
difficult task to get rid or it. "Bone"
coal is a trial and tribulation to the
coal producer. It is slaty coal â some
times more slate than coal, and again
more coal than slate â but at all times
a nuisance. Fire clay is easily washed
out, but It takes sweet revenge by
fettling down, a thick, sticky mud,
clogging the screens ;and making
trouble generally. But all these im
purities are floated and bumped and
screened and Jigged until the good coal
is pretty well rid of them.
"Washed coal" has been produced for
sometime, but It is only within the
last few years that washers have been
recognized as somethlnsr which every
well-regulated and up-to-date soft coal
Bhaft should have on the premises.
Now there are great buildings with ele
vators, bins, conveyors. Jigs, troughs,
chutes, screens, huge pumps and much
water which wash from fifty to one
hundred tons of coal every hour, and
the discriminating coal buyer will do
veil to purchase .washed coal, for he
will get more fuel to the ton end fewer
clinkers.

listed with "smokeless." "Hocking Val

tic fuel of the bituminous order is not
what most coal consumers think it is.
Many soft coal buyers have a vague
Idea that the enterprising coal man
turns the hose on his coal pile, cleans
off the mud and clay, labels the sprink-
Jed lumps "washed coal" and then
tacks on an extra quarter of a dollar
a ton, on the ground that it Is some
thing particularly fine. Othersâ and
some of these are intelligent business
menâ think that washed coal is mined
from the bed of a river and is cleaned
by the current as it is lifted to the sur
face.
Soft coal is "washed" to rid it of cer
tain impurities which reduce its fuel
value. The method of separating fire
flay, sulphur, slate, bone coal and other
impurities from the coal is called
"washing," because flowing water Is
the principal agent employed to do the
separating. The foreign matters In
coal are heavier than the coal and if
the impurities and coal are agitated
together in the water the slate, sul
phur, etc., will sink to the bottom and
the coal will float. Clean coal, of
'course, will sink in still water, but if
the water is moving with some velocity
the lumps will float in suspension Ions
enough* and far enough to permit of
Its separation from the deleterious sub
st^ ces.
"Washed coal" is becoming fashion
able with users of the bituminous. A
facetious soft coal dealer remarked a
few days ago, "Pretty soon you people
Â¦will want your coal not only washed,
but clear starched and ironed with a
domestic finish."

Washing Coal.
If it be said that the constitution should explicitly provide
for the death of elected but not inaugurated President. and
Vice President, the answer may well be that the constitution
imposes upon Congress the duty of providing for the general
welfare, and that requires that executive authority be un
broken, and it would not be broken because of the unlimited
tenure of the Cabinet officers, who remain in authority until
their successors are appointed, confirmed by the Senate and
sworn into office.
The act of July, 1789, creates the office of Secretary of the
department of foreign affairs, and, by 'the act of September
of the same year, the title was changed to Secretary of State.
Neither act limits the tenure of the Secretary of State, and
so in practice that officer and all the members of the Cab
inet retain functions until their successors are appointed and
confirmed by the Senate. They are executive officers, en t
trusted with administration of executive affairs.
Vice President Hendricks died during the Forty-ninth
Congress; John Sherman was President pro tern, of
the Senate, and John G. Carlisle was Speaker of the
House. It then occurred to our statesmen that un
der the act of 1792, it became possible for the Pres
idency to pass from the party in the majority at the
last election to the minority, for had President Cleveland <
by death or disability been removed Senator Sherman
would have become President. As the constitution empow
ers Congress to provide the Presidential succession, the act
of 1792 was changed, in respect of the succession provided,
by one passed January 19, 1886.
This act provides that in case of death or disability of
both the President and Vice President, the succession shall
pass to members of the Cabinet in this order: Secretary of
State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attor
ney General. Postmaster General, Secretary of the Navy,
and Secretary of^the Interior. The order is that of the sen
iority of each Cabinet department. Originally the Secretary
of. -War ruled the navy also, and the navy became a separate
department later on. . The departments' of agriculture and
commerce were not then in existence.')'.-^
Now it is evident that in the contingency foreseen by Sen
ator Lodge, the death of both the President and Vice Presi
dent elect, between the casting of the electoral votes and the
day of inauguration, March 4, there would arise this condi
tion: The terms of the President and Vice President being
fixed by the constitution at four years, when March 4
came there would be neither President nor Vice President,
and as the Secretary of State has no: limit-Â»to m ' s tenure of
office, he would still be Secretary, and would become acting
President and would act until a new election could be held as
provided by the law of 1792. Such construction of the law
does no violence to the constitution and is directly deriv
able from the act of 1886. So there is no doubt that under
the law of 1792 in such case the President pro tem. of the
Senate would have become acting President for the inter
regnum. The last act has the merit of putting more lives
in line for the succession.
gress.
All this is exactly stated. But he then proceeds to con
trast this explicit care about the Senate with what he calls
"the dangerous oversight of which the makers of the con
stitution were guilty in making similar provision for the.Ex
ecutive. A Vice President was created to take the place of
the President in case of the latter's death or disability, and
in the event of the death or disability of both the President
or Vice President Congress was empowered to settle the suc
cession by law. But in the case, by no means impossible, of
the death or disability of the President elect or of both the
President and Vice President elect after the adjournment of
the Electoral Colleges and before March 4, no provision
was made for the sucession or for the continuance of the Ex
ecutive subsequent to March 4." -
The act of 1792 provided that in event of the death or
disability of both President and Vice President, the succes
sion should pass in turn to the President of the Senate and
the Speaker of the House. And that in such event the Sec
retary of State should issue notification for an election of
President and Vice President.
SENATOR HENRY CABOT LODGE of Massachu
setts has not only distinguished himself in state'stnan
ship, but is a historical writer of established reputation.
In an article "The Senate," in the current number of Scrib
ner's, he fails to sustain his reputation for exactness of state
ment. After discussing the origin of the Senate, its peculiar
relation to the Executive by exercising its "adyice and con

making power, he details correctly the care taken by the
makers of the constitution to perpetuate that branch of Con-

Some soft coals are so pure and clean
by nature than for years they have
commanded higher prices than their
dirtier competitors. But the coal wash

Last of all, the water, which has been
doing the work runs into the "sludge"
tank, a deep trough nearly 100 feet
long. Here the coal dust, which is too
light and fine to be jigged, bumped or
screened, settles to the bottom, from
which it is scraped by scrapers carried
on link belting to one end, where it is
caught by. the buckets of an elevator
and lifted out.
The fine coal in the meantime is
swept along with the water to a "grad
inp trough," which is simply a settling
tank. Here tho coal settles gradually,
the larger particles first and the finer
last. Each size is lifted out and fed
into its own jig, so that the mass of

Indians, has, according to our Consular
Reports, been legislating in regard to
the minimum of wage that can be paid
to farm hands. The Government has
served notice on the planters that after
September 1 of the current year the
wages paid farm hands must be not
less than $1 50 a day. instead of 73 cents
and Jl, which were the ruling rates be
fore that date. Now, that sounds like
a good deal of an increase, and $1 50 a
day, which would mean $3 a week,
seems a high rate of wages for farm
labor in Central America. But this
money is Guatemalan currency, not
gold. In gold, wages of tt 50 a day
would mean fair pay, but in Guatemala
|1 50 of the depreciated currency of the
country is equal to only about 9 cents
in our own coinage. This decree, there

Business in the marriage license line
was not very brisk the other day at
the City Hall.jso "Cupid" Danforth put
in his time telling stories about the
different , people he has had to deal
with since his connection with the mar
riage license office.
"I think about the funniest ; couple
I ever had * to deal with dropped in
here about two months ago," he said.
"The prospective groom was a great
big, fine-looking fellow, about 25 years
old, and the bride-to-be was a little
bit of a woman who was 40 If she was
a day. She was a determined looking
little body, and I immediately came to
the conclusion that, little as she was,
she had it in her to make it merry
for the big fellow, particularly after
I noticed that he, despite his size, ap
peared to be very much afraid of her.
I actually pitied him as I watched him,
as with a look of fear In his eyes he
sank ' into a chair, while the woman
came to the desk and applied for the
license.
Her answers to the questions I asked
were given' in a snappy manner, which
strengthened my conclusion that the
list of henpecked ones was to be add
ed to. I was therefore very, much sur
prised . when" the subject of my cog
itations Jumped to his feet, reached
the desk with one bound, and, before
I could recover from my surprise,
grabbed the license I had Just com
pleted and was about to hand to the
woman, and tore it up.

r T"Â» HE Fresno Republican calls attention to the interest-
I, ing size of the garden vegetables that will be shown
* at the exposition in St. Louis, illustrating the capabil
ity of Fresno County to produce world beaters. R. D.
Chittenden, who is collecting exhibits in Fresno for the Cali
fornia commission to St. Louis, so the Republican says, is
not satisfied with finding two pumpkins that weigh respect
ively 132 and 142 pounds, and is looking for something
bigger.
Fowler is growing a pumpkin that is already estimated to
weigh 175 pounds and is still growing, with all the promise
of gigantic Thanksgiving pies commensurate with its own
generous circumference. The town of Fowler is looking on
with interest to ascertain its chance for distancing Fresno.
Other than these large pumpkins have been promised to Mr.
Chittenden to take to St. Louis. The county has already
contributed potatoes that, in the graphic language of the
Republican, "Chittenden carries about Just as he would so
much stovewood" â on account of their exceeding size.
The average length of the potatoes is fully one foot.
Fresno seeks to occupy a large amount of space in the
Agriculture building at St. Louis. The size of its vegetable
wonders makes the reasVn plain. The county will exhibit
its raisins/ its honey, nuts, vegetables of. all kinds, minerals,
oil, wines, dried fruitsâ in short everything for which it is
famous. With the citrus fruits will be shown the same sorts
of vegetation that are common in the East, only the Fresno
specimens will be larger. The land of the orange and the
raisin will be, found also to exemplify the ideal market
garden country. .>Â¦ '
â¢Fresno, however, will have to look sharp to its laurels for
growing pie materials at least. In the central coast \ counties
there have been discovered ten squashes that on the -scales
collectively weigh 2000 pounds. One of these prodigies
actually tips the scales at 300 pounds. The biggest Califor
nia squash that has been exhibited in the East up to this
time weighed 180 pounds. That was a wonder to the East
ern people. Since then California has had time 'to think the
matter over and the 300 pounder is one of the results.
Among the collected exhibits already reported to the com
missioners, to St.- Louis is a mangeiwurzel that weighs 100
poundsâwhich is a pretty fair sized beet. Three apples have
come in from San Joaquin County that are each fifteen inches
in circumference. One California: carrot weighs eighty
pounds. One duster of 4 grapes makes a record for 106
pounds. v

The very air we breathe is laden with

is healthy we are fortified against its

whether a really healthy person can

The healthy person will, therefore,
pursue his avocations and eat and
drink without the haunting fear that
he may assimilate disease germs. He
knows that he can do little to keep
them at a distance, and that the only
way to exclude, them from his system

The unreliability â¢ of circumstantial
evidence was demonstrated last week
in the case of a young collector for a
local firm. The latter was given a small
bill against a family who had been out
of. town for the summer months. The
house was in the fashionable quarter
and was large and well kept. The col
lector sized up the house and the bill,
which was an old one and v6ry small,
and concluded that he must have made
a mistake. However, the Jap who was
working in the front yard informed him
that the people for whom he was in
quiring lived In the house. Being in
the yard, the young man thought that
the best thing he could do' under the
circumstances would be to go to the
front door, stand there for a few mo
ments and then depart. The Jap, how
ever, noticed that he did not ring the
bell, and informing him that the la
dies were at home rang it himself.
A young lady of striking appearance
answered the bell, and the collector
was at a loss to know what to say. He
did not wish to dun a family living, in
such a house for ' so small a bill and
thereby risk -'losing their custom. On
the other hand, he felt that he should
say something, and consequently asked
if; they took iceÂ» and from whom. The
young lady replied that they did,' and
after going to the back- of the house
and consulting her mother told him
the name of the company with whom
they were dealing. . The young man
thanked her and departed.
That night the house was robbed of
$1000 by a porch-climber. The young
lady Immediately thought of the col
lector. She recalled his hesitating man
ner and the irrelevancy of his ques
tions, and forthwith furnished the po
lice with his description. The following
night he was arrested. They brought
the beautiful young lady down to the
hall and she Identified the confused col
lector. Until he told his story and
proved an alibi it looked as if circum
stantial evidence would get him over
the bay.
Circumstantial Evidence.
George E. Banks of Halifax, Nova
Scotia, a prominent exporter of Canada,
has revealed an astonishing falling off
in the season's catch of fish, both from
the Newfoundland banks and Norwe
gian waters. He says:
"A most serious and notable fact is
the shortage in the season's catch. The
average annual catch of Nova Scotia
is about 190.000 quintals of 113 pounds
each, while the aggregate for the last
season was 73.000 quintals, less than 40
per cent of the usual quantity. The
total catch of Nova Scotia, Newfound
land and Norway is normally about
3.000.000 quaintals, but the short catch
was universal, and was probably 500,000
quintals under the usual aggregate.
Prices have accordingly advanced
about 25 per cent. The advance \p
price, however, does not compensate
for the loss Incident to the short catch.
The shortasre was due to the lack of
bait, and boats that went out equipped
to bring in from 1500 to 2000 quintals
came in with from 200 to 300. The boat
owners are entitled to half the catch
and the fishermen to half. The results
were disappointing to both; the boat
owners lost money, and the fishermen
are left with very meager resources for
the winter. The shortare of bait was
simply a freak of nature that had
never occurred before within my thirty
years of experience as an exporter and
an observer of the fishing industry."

THE minority of the Ways and Means Committee in its
report in effect supports the Cuban reciprocity measure,
while offering some amendments? The treaty provides
that*Congress will not change certain tariff schedules during
the life of the agreement The minority desires to strike this
out on the ground that one Congress cannot bind future
Congresses not to change the revenue laws, for to do so
would violate the constitution. If this be so, that provision
is void anyway and cannot be made more void by an amend
ment. 'Â¦<'Â¦Â¦:;Â¦'Â¦
The debate so far on the minority side has been without
impressive incident, except such as is furnished by the speech
of Mr. McClellan, Mayor of New York, and mentioned for
the Presidency. He supported the treaty, lauded the Cuban
government and attacked the island administration, of..Gen
eral Wood by showing that Palma has governed Cuba with
an expenditure of seven millions less than Wood made.
General Wood had upon him the organization of a govern
ment over a population demoralized and industries pros
trated by civil war. His was a military government, always
more costly jthan civil administration, and he undertook and
accomplished the cleansing and sanitation of Havana and
other Cuban cities, where the venality and neglect of the
Spaniards had left perpetual centers of yellow fever and
other pestilence.
All of this work was done for President Palma and has
cost him nothing. But surely Mr. McClellan should credit
President Roosevelt for hastening to install independent civil
government in the island to get all of the good effects there
of which the speech so highly praised.
The speech had the merit of definite statement of the pur
pose of at least a large fraction of the minority to support the
bill. It stood in great contrast to the mere buffoonery of
Champ Gark, which would have been considered poor, even
for the stump in Missouri. It is evident that the treaty will
be ratified and the accompanying legislation passed, and that
we will soon have occasion to look for the predicted favor
able effects upon the trade of Cuba and our own.
To one argument there is no answer. The treaty is made
necessary by the Platt amendment which was adopted, under
our insistence, by the Cuban constitutional co/ivention. It
is. too late now to discuss. the wisdom or the policy of that
amendment. It is a' fact accomplished, and it limited the
power of Cuba to enter into commercial treaties with other
countries than the United States. We can hardly forbid her
to do that and refuse to make this commercial treaty which
gives her access to the world's trade through the United
States.
THE RECIPROCITY DEBATE.
Japan, it is announced on authority, is extremely dis
trustful of Russia and her intentions. Still the frying-pan of
uncertainty is not as bad as the fire of hopeless certainty.
If the two nations decide to relieve the strain of this dis
trust by war/the little brown men of the Mikado will be
taught a lesson new to their experience and perhaps admon
itory to their pride.
During the old Virginia City days,
when ore of great value was shipped by
tons from the rich" mines there, a car
of vthe precious stuff was lost In a mys
terious manner.' It was in the train
when it pulled out of Virginia. When
Reno was reached the conductor was
one car shy. All attempts to locate the
missing vehicle proved fruitless.
Several years later, the story goes,
two old prospectors were searching for
the yellow metal down below Virginia
in what is known as the Carson Sink.
At one time this sink was covered with
water; but later on | became - compara
tively dry. The prospectors were work
ing over the sink and ran across some
very rich auartz float. Cfreat excite
ment was caused by the strike. Hun
dreds of old mining men rushed to the
scene, an the "rock" was pronounced
some of the. richest ever found in the
vicinity of Virginia. Shafts were sunk
galore, .but not an ounce of anything
that looked like ore was found on any
claim but the one taking in the orig
inal strike. The two lucky prospectors
were . elated Â¦ over their discovery. A
shaft was sunk, the ore becoming more
plentiful as the hole went down. All
of -it, however, was in a broken up
state, no ledge being discovered. Down
about fifteen feet the shaft ran direct
ly through a mass of timbers.. The
wheels of an ore car soon came in view
and the prospectors discovered that
they had been mining about ten tons
of the Comstock's best ore. IV
The recent mysterious loss of a car of
ore from 'a train on the Carson and
Colorado Railroad brings back to mem
ory an old story that used to be told
during the Comstock excitement in Ne
vada.

time prior to hi3 death. The plaintiffs
are seeking to prove their father was
of unsound mind when he made a deed
to the defendant, Noah Bell, of certain
property valued at about $7000. The
hasty matrimonial venture is cited as
an instance of his falling mentality.
The star witness was Mrs. Kate Mil
ler, the divorced wife of the deceased.
She testified that she answered an ad
vertisement inserted in a local paper
by Bell, was employed by him as a
housekeeper and a week later was mar
ried to him. Bell subsequently secured
a divorce from her.
Interesting Testimony Is Given in
the Bell Case on Trial at
Santa Rosa.
HASTY MABBIAGE CITED
AS A PEOOE OF INSANITY
Moody was his own chief witness to
day and told a story greatly at vari
ance with that related by Mrs. Con
roy, who spent most' of ; yesterday on
the witness stand.
Several other witnesses testified, sub
stantiating in a measure the testimony
of Moody.
ing.
Judge Bellinger Interrupted the argu
ment of District Attorney Wood with
the statement to the effect that the
prosecution was proceeding on grounds
too far-fetched to warrant a verdict
against the defendant. The court in
structed one of Moody's attorneys to
write out the order of dismissal, and
after the document had been signed by
the foreman of the Jury the defendant
left the courtroom.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 18.â Former
Congressman Moody, on trial on an in
dictment returned by the Federal
Grand Jury charging him with wrong
fully securing and withholding a letter
addressed to Mrs. Margaret I. Conroy,
alleged to have contained a receipt
from the Comptroller of the Treasury
for the final dividend of the defunct
Dalles National Bank, of which Moody
was president, was acquitted this even-
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â This city la
to be the home of the most costly club
house for workingtnen in the United
States. Plans for the structure, which
is to be on East Eighty-fourth -street,
near Third avenue, have been . filed
with the city authorities for approval
and it is expected that construction
work will be started early next spring.
The clubhouse is to be five stories high.
100 by 102 feet in area, and is to cost
$200,000.
Facilities for mental and physical
culture are to be the best obtainable.
A gymnasium, class rooms, lecture
rooms and library are provided, and
It is the intention to have regular
courses of lectures, debates and studies
for members." ; u Â¦.ââ¢;:
vA large ballroom will be arranged,
with a stage for theatrical entertain
ments and muslcales; while on the first
floor there will be a bar and cafe, with
reading and billiard room.
The Workingmen's Educational and
Home Association of New York, which
will carry out the project, was organ

1400 members. Through entertainments
and other means funds were raised to

HONOLULU. Nov. 11.â The army
beard which Is to recommend a site for
an annv t>ost in Hawaii will make a
tour cf all the islands of the grouc be
fore rr.tiking a report. This board, of
which the ranking officer Is Colonel
Alexander Mackenzie of the general
staff, Â¦will aleo make a general study
cf the Islands for military purposes.
Although every available site in the
Territory -will be visited, it is not the
expectation of members of the board
that the War Department will go out
side of the island of Oahu in selecting
a site for en army post. The detail for
the work made by Major General Mac-
Arthur of the Department of California
Is as follows: Colonel Alexander Mac
kenzie, general staff, president; Major
Henry P. Moon, Tenth Infantry; Major
William E. Birkhimer, artillery corps,
and CaDtaln George W. Read, Ninth
Cavalry, recorder.
Major Davis of Camp McKinley and
Captain Williamson, depot quartermas
ter, report to the board and assist its
Tvork in every way possible.
According to the order issued to the j
members of the board they are directed
to meet at Honolulu, and at such other '
places as the president may direct, "to |
deterrr.ine uron a site for a central mil
itary pest, with special reference to de- '
t<?rminlr.g the suitability of the Waia- ;
naeuka tract for the purpose men- j
tioned, also for the purpose of consid- I
ering a thorough and exhaustive mil!- ]
P'ary reconaissance of the Hawaiian
trchlpel&go." It is the intention of the I
board to visit every island of the group j
â¢ind Ftcdy conditions with a special
reference from the military stmipoir.t.
A general plan cf defense In cas,Â» cf
wax will probably be decided upon and
recommended to the newly organized
general fctaff at Washington. As the
board cxj>ects to remain in the islands
for a month ample time and opportu
r.lty will be given for an -;xhE.ustive
study of the military requirements cf
the Tercitory, as is requested in the or
der designating the members of the
tcard. The army board will make no
report nhile In Honolulu, aut the re
port will probably go direct to General
MacArthur and to the general staff at
Washington.

SCOTTTS EMTJLSIOH.
There are two kinds of
emulsions of cod liver oil-
Scott's and all the others.
Not one of the latter is as
valuable as Scott's Emulsion
and there's a reason for it
| Only .the purest ingredients
enter our Emulsion and its
quality never varies. That is
why it helps when all others
fail.
There's not much oil in
the market now; it's scarce
and high in price. But seal
oil and other inferior oils are
cheap and plentifuL That's
why you can .buy so many
substitutes for Scott's Emul-
sion at a lower price.
We guarantee our Emul-
sion to be the best remedy
for weak lungs, low vitality
and wasting conditions. Who
guarantees the others ?
Well scad 70a a sample free, upon ret^xst.

Paul Martin, the amateur lightweight
champion boxer from North Beach, won
the final battle of the Bay City Club's
show last night from little Dick High
land. Highland took the place" of Joe
Carroll, who balked at the last mo
ment. Though handicapped in weight,
height and reach the little boy fought a
battle worthy of a true gladiator. The
odds were too much against him, and
his dusky opponent was handed the
palm of victory at the conclusion of
the fourth round.
Every moment of the, encounter was
marked by some lively Incident in the
form of a punch, a neat block or a
frenzied cry of foul from the crowd.
Both lads .were in. the ring to do their
best, and none of their exertions were
wasted. Martin took the lead, in the
Initial round, and up 'to the fourth he
hammered his tiny opponent. Then the
latter came back with a burst of speed
that won for him round after round of
wild applause. He landed time and
again on Martin's face and body. He
rushed the latter around the ring, and
there was fire in both his dimmed eyes.
The lead of the north end slugger was
a big one and the decision" was awarded
himâ a decision which he well earned
by his marvelously clever and ag
gressive work in the first three rounds.
| The next best one on the card was a
two-round affair between Joe Larkin
and Jack Burke. They mixed it bo hard
In the last spasm that the ; spectators
arose en masse and yelled like Indians.
During siege of slugging that en
sued Burke grew groggy and the po
lice ordered the' mill stopped.
Jack Moriarity quit in the first round
of his go with Bob Lundle, Nobby 'Otts
finished Billy White In a minute, bick
Cullen got the decision over : E.: Knock

Manager John Halton, In making the
unexpected announcement, said the se

tated the laying up of a number of

number available for running. On De

be run and a large entry is expected of
Eastern and coast greyhounds. This
will mark the reopening of ttie park,
which, It Is expected, will be the scene
of coursing throughout the winter.
"When the coursing men assembled at

Coureing Park they were Informed the
park will remain closed until Decem

MARTIN DEFEATS

Dr. Tillman. the Yosemite Club's
physician, will visit Gardner at Lark
spur to-morrow and examine him.
Gardner is in splendid condition and is
highly confident of winning. Fitz is a
6 to 10 favorite in the betting. There is
a wide difference of opinion over the
flght, each man having many admirers.
If Fitzsimmons enters the ring in as
good condition as when he fought Jef
fries he will surely win. If Gardner
catches Fitz out of condition he is ex
pected to win handily. Fitzsimmons has
taken oft a lot of weight- in a short
time, which may leave him unfit for a
severe struggle. - ....
The sale, of seats, for the Fltzsim
mons-Gardner^contest opeped at Cor
bett's yesterday. - That the house will
be big is evidenced by the number of
orders that have come from all parts
of the State. The light heavy-weights
will probably battle before a -$20,000
house. .->r r
Jimmy Britt is a 1 to 2 choice over-
Martin Canole for. their contest to be
fought to-morrow night before the
Colma Athletic Club. There is a great
deal of Britt money in sight and it is
expected the betting will be 4 to 10 be
fore the men step into the ring. Canole
does not want, for friends, who look
upon him as a good short end. The
pair are in splendid shape and should
put up a fast battle.
The new clubhouse;will be finished or.
time and will seat the same number of
spectators as does Woodward's Pavil

"As a way, out of this I believe a big
man; like Garry Cochran should be se

should be charged with the selection of

should have .the assistance of the stars
of "other Â¦ years, one man for each posi

. "The Stanford' team â¢ was the ] Har

"There was also' considerable politics
and friendship in: the selection of the
team, as ; at .', least three , Â¦'. substitutes
were ' conceded . to ' be better 7 players
than the ; men , who lined up against
Stanford. The /positions in question
were fullback, quarterback and right
halfback. â¢ v \ â¢ ,
"When he offers a suggestion he Is
likely to be asked, 'Who ever told you
you could play end or quarter?' as the
case maybe. This was particularly no
ticeable at Berkeley, where the men
all had previous experience in
their respective positions. Then again
former star players were :not wanted
on the field to coach men 'In positions
with which they vwere familiar.-
TOO MUCH POLITICS.
"The discipline at Berkeley this year
was lax. The men did not exert them
selves in the preliminary games, with
the result that when they met Stanford
they had formed bad habits, which
they could not change. It is a mistake
to think one man can properly instruct
the eleven men on a 1 te^im. The coach
has possibly played but ' one position
on a team in his time and has no Inti
mate knowledge of the work of the re
mainder of the team.
An authority on footballs who has
followed closely all the big games on
this coast during the present^ season
says the system of coaching is all
wrong. "If the two universities want
to keep football up to a high standard
they must employ Eastern coaches," he
said yesterday. "The universities about
Chicago and throughout the Middle
West found this out long ago, and the
majority of them have coaches > from
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other col
leges where^ football Is highly devel
oped. 'J -Vr. '
"I have been offered a good position,"
he said, "but I may not get it until
after I graduate. If it comes earlier it
will not interfere with my playing In
the baseball games,. as I will probably
stay in college until May."
The football team will elect a captain
to take Overall's place at a dinner to
night at Zinkand's. The candidates for
thu position are Henry Heitmuller,
Benjamin Stroud and ] Reno Demerritt.
As It was Heitmuller who saved Cali
fornia from defeat at the intercollegiate
game he will probably" be elected to
succeed Overall. There is some opposi
tion to him, however, because hie Is not
a 1 member of any fraternity.
NEW SYSTEM v NEEDED.
, No action has yet been taken on Col
onel, Edwards' suggestion, but It seems
so perfectly practicable to all men in
terested in football that the executive
committee of the Associated Students
is likely to adopt it at its next meet
ing. â¢ *
. A story went the rounds of the uni
versity campus yesterday that Orval
Overall, captain of both the football
and baseball teams, would leave col
lege in the middle of the next semester
to accept a commercial position. -The
baseball team needs Overall to help'
It win games against Stanford next
spring and the news naturally had a
depressing effect on the students. Over
all allayed the fears somewhat when
he told some. of them that he was not
sure about his future.
OVERALL TO REMAIN.
Colonel Edwards' plan consists of
turning over \ the management of the
team to a board. This board of man
agers might be made up of the head
coach, the sub-coach, a faculty mem
ber, an alumni member and one or two
others. These_ will unite In securing
for the team the best possible coaching.
New Eastern plays will be copied and
old varsity players will be called in to
assist the individual players and the
general team work. This method of
handling the team will have the effect
of relieving' the coach of, some of his
responsibilities, which are considered
too numerous.
"This is not a complaint against the
coaches," said Colonel Edwards. '"I
have thought of It for a long time as
the best way to keep up with the game
as It is played in the East. The board
would" be the Judges of our plan of
campaign. They could see the mis
takes they made and we could profit
by them. Under the present system
nothing of the past Is remembered.
The colleges in the East long- ago
adopted the plan and we ought to do
the same."
Colonel George C. Edwards of the
University of California faculty, who
stands for the highest standard In col
lege sports, has suggested that radi
cal changes be made Jn the methods of
coaching next year's .football team.
â¢When racing closed last spring the
giant Dupont . was added to the list
and turned out at pasturage. The big
fellow made his first appearance this
season In the mile and a furlong sell-
Ing number, and, well ridden by Fer
rell, . won in stake horse fashion from
the' 8 to 5 favorite, Erne. Dodie S was
third. The winner closed at odds of
9 to l. Â¦/â¢'<: ;
Dr. H. E. Rowell had his cold, Har
bor, primed and ready for a wild "klll
ing'V in' ' the maiden two-year-old,
forcing the odds from 10 down to 6,
but Johnny Schorr's Ananias interfered
with -arrangements. If Chicago form
counts for- anything the latter
youngster looked the best, notwith
standing which : his price went from
7 to Â£ to 3. He raced on almost even
terms with Harbor most of the route,
and. In a mild drive, led the' Rowell
entry out a neck. Instrument, a 10 to 1
outsider, ran into the show/;;
There was considerable comment
over the reversal shown by Meehanus
after the erratic chestnut . horse had
captured the third number,' a six fur
long .selling affair. Last Saturday,
over a muddy track, Meehanus re
ceived strong backing, both from his
owner and the public, at odds of 9 to 10
and couldn't scare up a gallop. Yes
terday there was 9 and 10 in profusion
and again ridden by Lee Jackson, he
scored handily from the 40 to 1 shot,
Blue Miracle. Tower, of Candles, the 7
to 10 favorite, was raced into submis
sion by Father Wentker, though man
aging, to last out long enough to get
third place.
Ivy Powell landed Loyal S winner of
the opening six furlong event The old
gelding ruled favorite, and, in a long
drive, earned the decision over Man of
Honor by less than a length. Egg Nogg,
under a vigorous beating, secured the
show.
LOYAL. S A WINNER.
Ten and twelve to one could be had
about Scott at almost any stage of the
betting, the smart play being confined
to the Jungle champion. Sad Sam, the
13 to 5 favorite. The latter chased
Money Muss to the stretch and then
tried to take to the outside fence. / It
looked once as if the yellow' horse.
Money Muss, would decamp with the
purse, but under,, D. Hall's careful tu
telage John A. Scott ran over him the
last sixteenth, winning easily in 1:00
flat. Hagerdon was a good third.
Nothing prettier In the racing line
could be wished for than the mile
handicap, which was last on the card.
To be sure only four started, but at the
finish a lindsey would almost have cov
ered the quartet. Beau Ormonde, car
rying 111 pounds and Fen-ell, opened
an even money favorite, but later his
price lengthened to twos, when a stiff
play on Warte Nicht began. â¢ .Â¦
FERRELL'S COSTLY MISTAKE.
If, Ferrell, who 'rode Beau Ormonde,
had kept. the. rail position that horse
might have won. Instead, on lth$
stretch turn, he accommodatingly left
room for Adklns, astride. Warte Nicht,
to get through on the inside, and at the
wire was beaten less than a length by
the Fonso colt In ;l:40%. Dainty met
with some ill luck at the start and then
after running a superb race only lost
the.show to Bragg by half a length.
Another excellent performance was
that of John A. Scott, owned by Mil
ton Jones, which horse disposed of a
cluster of the fastest sprinters out
here in the five-furlong scramble.
As a. sort of, prelude to the real
storm the weather at Oakland yester
day was showery, but not enough rain
fell at one time to form a pool large
enough for a Stockton slough tadpole
to take a bath" In.'
A glimpse at the time on the form
chart for the different events will ver :
Ify. this statement. Loyal S and Warte
Nlcht were the only winning favorites,
but no doubt the downfall of more than
one^ choice will be ascribed to the
heavy track. The attendance was
large and the sport the. best the meet-
Ing has thus far afforded. '5 ' ; \

The most loathsome and repulsive of all N^!|^gi^/ ,â >Ja Â¦
Hying things is the serpent, and the vilest and -^^^^
most degrading of all human diseases. is Contagions Blood Poison. The
serpent sinks its fangs into the flesh and almost instantly the poison passes
through the entire body. Contagions Blood Poison, beginning with a little
ulcer, soon contaminates every drop of blood and spreads throughout the
.whole system. Painful swellings appear in the groins, a red rash and
copper colored splotches break out on the body, the mouth and throat
become ulcerated, and the hair and eye brows fall out ; but these symptoms
are mild compared to the wretchedness and suffering that come in the latter
stages of .'the disease when it attacks the bones and more vital "parts of the
body. It is then that Contagious Blood Poison is seen in all, its hideous-
ness: Thejdeep eating abscesses and sickening ulcers and tumors show
the whole system is corrupted and poisoned, and unless relief comes soon

SAN JOSE, Nov. 18.â The body of an
unidentified man, who is " believed to
have fallen from a passenger train, was
found this morning lying 'beside the
railroad track near Perry station;

is believed his neck was broken by the
fall. There was nothing in the pock
ets of the dead man to identify ; him
aside from a baggage check, which is
numbered 4128. In his* hat was the

HONOLULU. Nov. 11.â The North
German Lloyd training bark Herzogln
Sophie Charlotte has arrived from
Bremen after a voyage of 132 days.
Shortly before rounding the Horn one
of the cadets, named Kishler. was
knocked from the maintop during a
storm. He fell to the deck, a distance
of ISO feet, and was killed instantly.
The burial took place at sea.
The training bark presents the as
pect of a man of war. The discipline
on board Is rigorous, as she has fifty
five cadets in training to enter the
North German Lloyd service. After
three years of study of navigation and
practical seamanship on board the bark
the cadets serve one year as Junior offi
cers In the German navy. They then
enter the service of the Lloyd Company

Tax Collector Smith yesterday re
fused to accept the tax npon the real
property assessed to the United Rail
roads on Valencia street, near Her
mann, because the corporation refused
to pay the taxes upon Its personal prop
erty, franchise and machinery, roadbed,
rolling stock, tools and material, the'
lien for which taxes was a charge
against the real estate described.
The representatives of the corpora
tion tendered to Smith the sum of
$19,101 92. being the first installment of
the taxes for 1903 on all Its real estate.
Smith would not accept the money un
less the United Railroads paid the en
tire first installment of taxes upon its
personal property. Including Its fran
chise. This tax. amounting to $36*
650 59, the corporation Is willing to pay
but as. the city, has assessed the road
and the State has done likewise the
corporation does not know to whom to
pay the money. It does not desire to
pay the taxes twice and lte attorneys
informed Tax Collector Smith that it
was willing to deposit the money with
the court to determine who should re
ceive it. Smith could not take the
money for taxes on its real estate on
Valencia street which secures the pay
ment of taxes on Its personal property
amounting to 52S17 Â£3.
SMITH BEFTJSES TAXES.
"You, of course, understand that
taxes become delinquent on the last
Monday of this month, and if not paid
by that time heavy penalties accrue.
Being ready and willing to pay our
taxes, we want to avoid these penal
ties. You can also see that If we pay
either claimant now and It should
finally turn out that we should have
paid the other we would be burdened
with the very, penalties we are seeking
to avoid.
"Of course, we could decline to pay
either. But this would mean separate
judicial and other proceedings upon
the part of both city and State, and
would result In prolonged and vexa
tious litigation which it Is equally de
sirable to avoid.
"By a suit In interpleader all parties
are udted in the same action, the
amount of the tax is forthwith paid
into court, and the respective rights
of the city and State can be speedily
and finally determined."
"Now, the United Railroads is ready
to pay Its taxes, but It doesn't know to
whom to pay, and so is seeking to have
that question determined by proper
judicial authority.
"The proceeding which has been in
stituted is called a suit in interpleader
and is a proceeding which is often em
ployed to determine the rights of con
flicting claimants. The person upon
whom the claim is made by the several
claimants avers his willingness to pay,
but states that he is unable to deter
mine with safety to himself to which
particular claimant the payment should
bÂ» made. He, therefore, turns the
amount of the claim over to the court
to be paid to such claimant or claim
ants as the court may determine.
"This is the course being pursued
by the United Railroads.
DELINQUENT TETS MONTH.
..- The suit Is not a new action, being
a means often employed where, though
a party is willing to comply with the
law, there exists a doubt as to the per
son or persons to whom money shall
be paid over. Attorneys Tirey L. Ford
and W. M. Abbott filed the action on
behalf of the company yesterday. It
was assigned to Judge Seawell by
Judge Murasky, and an order was is
sued directing the defendants in the
action, the various Tax Collectors and
the State Board of Equalization, to ap
pear before Judge Seawell November 20
and give evidence in the matter.
FORD EXPLAINS SUIT.
In discussing the suit yesterday At
torney Tirey L. Ford said:
"The purpose of the suit is to deter
mine where and to whom the United
Railroads shall pay its taxes. The
property of the company was assessed
by the State Board of Equalization,
and. if the State board had jurisdiction
in the matter, then the tax resulting
from their assessment is payable to the
State Controller. On the other hand,
the same property was assesed by the
Assessor of San Francisco, and if that
officer had jurisdiction, then the tax
resulting from his assessment is pay
able to the Tax Collector of San Fran
cisco.
the court.
The question cf which official shall
be the recipient of the taxes of the
United Railroads was passed up to the
Superior Court yesterday by the filing
of a suit in interpleader by the com
pany. Whether the money shall be paid
to Tax Collector Smith of this city, the
Tax Collector of San Mateo County,
the Tax Collector of the city of San
Mateo or the State Board of Equaliza
tion, each cf whom claims the right to
collect, is the bone of contention. Tax
Collector Smith has already refused to
accept the sum the United Railroads
has been assessed, and, until the issue
has been determined by Judge Seawell.

"In a straight line across toward the
Hilo side there were six smaller cones,
all more or lesa active. During the
night one of these broke out in violent
eruption. There was increased activity
In the larger one at the same time, and
the whole surface of the lake was vio
lently agitated, waves of molten lava
surging from the center out to the
edge and dashing itself like firellke
surf on the edees. At this time. too.
there was activity in one of the smaller
lakes, the lava welling up like water
from an artesian well. This Increased
activity lasted for several minutes and
the lava in the central lake rose so high
that it broke over its banks in three
streams, which soon united and flowed
in the direction of the Kau gap."
"At intervals the commotion was
very much like the noise of a locomo
tive blowing off steam, and when this
phenomenon was particularly violent
the whole body of lava In the cone
seemed to be lifted up to the lip of the
cone and fl**r over In a stream of fire.
HONOLULU, Nov. 11.â George P.
Thlelen of the Land Registration Court
has Just returned from a visit to the
volcano. His party made a quick trip
to the top of Mokuaweoweo, and he
says the sight is well worth any little
trouble and inconvenience which .visi
tors may experience. Speaking of tha
crater, Mr. Thielen says:
"In the center of the immense crater,
and probably about where the deepest
portion of it was before the present
activity, there was an Immense lake
of lava in which were several cones and
other forms of activity. The lake has
spread out, the lava hardening as it
spreads from the central fire, until it
has built up a bank or margin fully
ten feet, perhaps more, higher than the
general level of the lava . throughout
the crater. Within thi3 margin the
play and wash and agitation of the
molten lava as it was perturbed by the
awful forces be-ow was magnificent
and awe-Inspiring, especially at night,
when color gave distinctness and per
spective to the motion.
"Two other smaller lakes have formed
on the old floor of the crater, both to
the northward of the central one, each
of which showed activity. In the cen
tral lake there was one very large and
very active cone. It has been built up
at least 200 feet above the level of'the
lake. Every few seconds there is a
violent ejection of molten lava, rising
often to a height of 100 feet above the
top of the cone and falling back In
globes and stars and cascades of fire.
Special Correspondence of The CalL
"Mr. Cooper is very anxious to close
up a lot of matters which may not be
in the interest of the Territory." said
Secretary Carter, entering upon a
lengthy statement of protest, "because
they are unfinished business of the De
partmentof Public Works. I do not
see why there should be this unseemly
haste when the wisdom of a number of
past transactions which have been con
summated is In doubt. It seems to me
that it shows very decidedly a lack of
confidence in the new administration.
This is the first time I have heard of
many of these deals. I most seriously
object to the attitude of the old ad
ministration in rushing through these
transactions. It doesn't show any con
fidence in the new administration.
"I will say personally that I have lost
confidence in the reports which are
made here. Mr. Cooper stated recently
that his reports were made in the in
terests of the Territory as a whole and
ever since he made the statement I
haven't had the confidence I had before
in his reports and recommendations.
These transactions represent large
amounts, but we have no figures ex
cept from the other side. They may
be accurate, but they are not from the
Government side and they are from In
terested parties. I don't see why we
are called together on the eve of a
change in administration to rush these
propositions through."
"I don't see that there is any rush
ing through," said Cooper. "When I
took office I was snowed under for
months with the unfinished work of
my predecessor. My ambition is to
leave no unfinished business. This land
transaction is not a new thing. It has
been discussed for months."
"Excuse me, Mr. Cooper, but It is a
new thing," replied Carter. "It Is new
business which the old administration
is trying to get through. You can leave
unfinished business In your department
as far as the new administration is
concerned. The new administration
has to take the responsibility."
"I am trying to relieve the new ad
ministration of this responsibility."
"The responsibility of running the
Government will be with the new ad
ministration whatever Is done now. I
don't think It shows very much con
fidence in the new administration to
hurry these matters through now. We
are asked to come here and vote on a
proposition without sufficient data to
form a conclusion. I don't think it is
the proper way and If a vote is to be
taken on the matter I shall beg to be
excused before the vote."
Carter remarked that further investi
gation was necessary and that there
was danger that some disadvantageous
transactions, , like some past ones,
might be made. Asked by the Gover
nor to name examples, he spoke of a
Kahiklnui deal and of a transaction
with Mrs. Nakuina, which were acted
on without sufficient data. He said
that transactions "on the quiet" natur
ally lead to criticism, often unjust,
but If all the people have a chance to
bid there could be no complaints.
HONOLULU, Nov. 11.â A very ani
mated discussion of Territorial land
transactions was brought about In the
Executive Council meeting yesterday
by a protest from Secretary Carter
against what he termed the disposition
to "rush" through a lot of deals before
the coming change In administration-
Carter very severely criticized so'me
transactions of the past, as. not In pub
lic interest, and there followed a
lengthy discussiqn with Superintendent
Cooper and .'.the Governor,, which
showed much difference in the views
taken by them.
The matter under discussion was
brought up by Cooper and was the ex
change of land on an even valuation
of $45,000. "The land Is needed by the
Department of Public Works," he said,
"as a site for an armory and for a new
royal school."

peared before Judge Fritz yesterday to
answer to the charge of being drunk
and carrying a concealed weapon.
When he was arrested he told the po
liceman that he intended to shoot out
some lights with the revolver he was
carrying. Shreve looked like a respect
able citizen and when he told the Judge
that the revolver he carried would not

"Mister DoQley-ooley-ooley-ooley-oh"
received a partial vindication in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday. He was ar
rested on the charge of disturbing the
peace and quietude of Kearny street in
the block bounded by Pine and Califor
nia. Of course, Mr. Dooley was not
haled Into the Police Court in person.
He is too great a man for that. But he
appeared vicariously through F. J. Mc-
Carthy, who conducts a phonographic
establishment at 342 Kearny street.
Abraham Isaacs, who runs a jewelry
establishment at 331 Keamy street, was
the complaining witness. He testified
that an electrical piano in McCarthy's
establishment played "Mr. Dooley" so
insistently that his business was on
the verge of ruin. He brought sixteen
witnesses to corroborate his grievance.
The defendant outdid him In the
number of witnesses. He had twenty
six to swear that the music was thor
oughly enjoyable and never disturbed
them. As far as the'r business was
concerned, they thought "Mr. Dooley'i
was helpful. Among the rebutting wit
nesses was the father of the complain
ant, who. censured his son for his an
tagonism to the phonographic parlor.
Nearly everybody who is engaged in
business or lives in the vicinity of the
phonograph parlor was In attendance
to testify. Among them was a deaf
man who said that the music did not
bother him in the least.
Judge Conlan made a Solomon-like
Judgment. He got McCarthy to prom
ise that "Mr. Dooley" would be re
placed by other popular melodies and
that a soft pedal would be placed on
the piano. Under that agreement the
defendant was dismissed.
Charles H. Eichelberger wanted to
discharge his housekeeper, and found
the task difficult. Accordingly he
sought the assistance of Police Judge
Cabaniss yesterday. He testified that
his housekeeper was generally drunk
and unruly. The defendant, Fanny Le
brecke by name, appeared, clad sump
tuously in a costly mink coat and a hat
to match. She told the Judge that her
relations to Eichelberger were some
what closer than those of a mere me
nial. He had furnished a flat for her
and bought her much finery. She prom
ised the Judge that she would vacate
the premises gladly If she were allowed
to go. The case was continued for
thirty days.
Five years ago Eichelberger was a
prospector in Arizona. He owned a pair
of overalls, a shirt, two burros and a
couple of hob-nailed shoes. One day
he climbed a hill that raises its sun
scorched back between the Colorado
and Gila rivers, and the nails in his
shoes scratched the formation. When
he looked down at the nail marks he
nearly went crazy. The rock was shot
ted and seamed with gold. He had dis
covered the King of Arizona mine,

dollars to the gold output of the Ter

the housekeeper business. A pretty
Mexican girl whom he married at the
first outburst of his new fortune and
who now lives in Los Angeles will
probably resent the housekeeper epi
sode when she hears of it.

Phillip Magulre was found guilty of
till tapping yesterday in Judge Mogan's
court. He was arrested by Detectives
Fitzgerald and Graham In the act of
taking 52 50 from a till In a bakery at
106 Noe street. There were other
charges against him of the same char
acter, but these could not be proved.

"Jack the Hugger" was up before
Judge Mogan yesterday. He turned
out to be Hialmar Neilson, a Dane,
who is a well dressed, clean limbed
young Viking who works in a furniture
factory- He put his arms around Lola
Roberts when she was going home
from her work at the Montana dance
hall. "With all the instincts of woman
hood aroused In her she told him "not
to get fresh." He responded by knock
ing her into the middle of Kearny
street- It was muddy and her sealskin
sacque was stained. The Judge heard
the testimony and continued the case
until Saturday for further Investiga
tion. /
Morris Stroner was arrested yester
day on complaint of Leo'RolbeclkLon
a charge of battery. The defendant is
night clerk at the "What Cheer House
and says that the complaining witness,
after having reposed all rihjht In one of
the luxurious beds of the establish
ment, refused to render up the 15 cents
that is exacted in such cases. Rtroner
tried to take the money away from
him. and In so doing hit the recalcit
rant lodger in the eye. Therefore this
morning he will have to tell Judge
Mogan the troubles of an innkeeper.
Patrick Hannon, secretary of the La
borers' Protective and Benevolent As
sociation, was arrested yesterday on
complaint of Terrence O'Donnell, one
of the executive committee of the or
ganization. The charge is misdemeanor
embezzlement in the retention of a
bankbook valud at $5. Behind this
charge the officers of the organization
claim that Hannon has made himself
custodian of funds to the amount of
$1000. which he refuses to account for.
Hannon surrendered himself during the
afternoon and claimed that he had re
ceipts tor all the money he had re
ceived/ To-day Judge Moran will
thrash out the matter. . t

Dr. I. Matsumaka and his wife were
walking along Dupont street Tuesday
night when he received his injuries.
He appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday and told what he remem
bered of the occurrence. He was
swathed in linen bandages and gave
evidences of having had a lively time.
He said that H. Hayashi, a fellow
countryman, had beaten him entirely
without cause. S. Kishi, another little
brown man, attempted to act as peace
maker and got several jolts from the
overflow. Policeman McShane arrested
all three, being unable to distinguish
the aggressor in the tangle. Judge Ca
baniss did a little analytical work on
the bunch and sentenced Hayashi to
spend thirty days In the County Jail.
The others were allowed to go on their
way.
Thomas Newman, the sailor board
ing-house keeper, who was arrested
some weeks ago on complaint of thÂ£
British Consul for disturbing the peace,
is again irt trouble. Yesterday John
Cane, keeDer of a sailors' boarding
house at 12 V^llejo street, swore out a
warrant charging Newman with com
ing into his place and threatening to
kill Cane and his son. | Newman was
released on bail and his defense to the
charges will be heard to-day.
â¢Salvator Onarato proved a foxy de
fendant. He was accused in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday of assaulting
Annie Vento, an eight year old girl, on
November 1. He slapped her several
times and knocked her down. He had
six witnesses to prove that he had
never touched the child on his visit to
the house at 422 Bay street. Judge Con-
Ian took a hand in the questioning and
suddenly developed through the flood
of broken English poured forth by the
witnesses that they were testifying to
occurrences on November 17 instead
of November 1. Accordingly he gave
credence to the little girl's story and
found Onarato guilty. The trick of
changing the dates nearly served the
purpose of acquitting- a burly brute
who had beaten a child.
testimony showed that during the
course of an ordinary argument Bru
der drew his revolver and unexpected
ly turned it loose against Demery.

cloth worth $1900 from that firm, which
an affidavit by the Abbey Press ship

An affidavit accompanying the com
plaint, made by present secretary

the latter did not profit by the trans
action. Rideal was paroled by the
magistrate before whom the case was

Mrs. Saidie Adams, one of the two
women inspectors attached to the local
customs service, was knocked down and
seriously hurt yesterday on board the
steamship Gaelic. Mrs. Adams was
walking along the alleyway on the
main deck as the Chinese stewards
were putting ashore the liner's soiled
linen. A heavy bundle packed for
transportation to the laundry was
thrown from the hurricane deck in time
to land on Mrs. Adams' shoulders. She
was ' knocked down, badly bruised,
severely shaken and greatly scared.
After Dr. Gates, the Gaelic's surgeon,
had attended to her injuries she was
conveyed in a carriage to her home.

In the Custom-house examination of
the baggage of the passengers that ar
rived yesterday on the Gaelic the sys
tem of alphabetical segregation was
adopted for the first time and it work'ed
like a charm. In the past .ill baggage
has been carried to the corral at the
head of the dock and there dumped
into a heap from which each passenger
hunted his own. The baggage which
arrived yesterday was examined in a
roped enclosure on the dock and ar
ranged alphabetically according to the
owner's name. The Gaelic brought com
paratively few passengers, but by the
new system all the baggage was ex
amined in an hour or so less time than
it could have been under the old
method.
New System Saves Time.
The contract for a sewer In Pierce
street between McAllister street and
Golden Gate avenue was awarded to
Flinn & Treacy.
The board referred the protest of the
Sutro estate, Anglo-Californlan Bank
ing Company and Emily Pope against
the construction of a sewer in Ashbury

taken under advisement.
Protests were filed against allowing
the claims of ten property owners ag
gregating $82,961 09 for damages in the

who wants $45,000.
The board set Wednesday. November

to the construction of stone sidewalks
on 'Twelfth avenue from Point Lobos

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 18.â Dr. An
drew B. Neldon of New York to-day
performed the operation of grafting an
ear upon the head of a Western mil
; lionalre, whose name the surgeon says
he is under bond hot to reveal. The
operation was to have been performed
in New York, but District Attorney
Jerome is said to h'ave interfered.
Dr. Neldon advertised for a man will
ing to sell an ear for $5000 and from
300 applicants he selected a young Ger
man, who conducts a restaurant in
New York. Dr. Neldon said to-day:
"The operation has been performed
and promises to be successful. I am
under legal contract and heavy bond
not to reveal the name of my patient.
Generally speaking, he Is a wealthy
man from the "West. How he lost one
ear I do not know. It appears to have
been cut off with a sharp Instrument.
I believe he says it was accidental, but
I never asked him to explain.
"The operation took place at a private
hospital here, where I was assisted by
a Philadelphia physician and one from
New York. I think they will be will
ing to have theif names known laÂ£er.
The two men were placed in opposite
directions upon an elongated bed. One
half of .the volunteer's ear â the upper
half was cut off, together with about
four Inches of the skin behind the ear.
"This was twisted around and fitted
to a freshly prepared wound upon my
patient's head. The half ear was
held by bandages and the two -men
bound so they cannot move their heads.
"They must retain this position for
at least twelve days to allow the cir
culation to come through the flap of
skfn that still remains a part of the
volunteer's ecalp.
"If this half ear starts to unite prop
erly, the lower half ear will be grafted
in the same manner." ': :"?: :':.-

The Harbor Commissioners yester
day rejected all the bids submitted for
the construction of the Southern Pacific
freight slip at Central Basin because
the lowest bid was $11,000 more than
Engineer Lott Norton's estimate of
what the cost should be. Healy, Tib
bitts & Co. were awarded the contract
for reconstructing Little Main street
wharf. Their bid was $19,897. The
Risdon Iron Works received the con
tract for making a new crank shaft
for the fire tug Governor Irwln at an
expense to the State of $829.
The Santa Fe Company paid to the
board $19,S97 for the lease of J>0x669 feet
of Little Main street wharf for nlnety
t:ix months. Bills amounting to $19,000
were ordered paid. The commissioners
authorized the employment cf the
board's former attorney, James H.

The little coasting steamer Maggie
ran into the Key Route ferry-boat San
Jopo yesterday morning just as the
latter was entering the slip on this
Fide. The San Jose's rail was damaged
and a dent was made in the Maggie's
nose. The accident caused no excite
ment on the ferry-boat, the majority
of the passengers knowing nothing of
it until after the boats had backed
clear of each other. The navigator of
the Maggie is said to have answered
the San Jose's whistles, and then, in
disregard for the acknowledged warn
ing, to have tried to cross the ferry
boat's bows. The prompt action taken
by Captain Rasmussen of the San Jose
is said to have been largely responsible
for the slightness of the damage result
ing from the collision.

It was two hours after the scheduled
sailing time before the liner Korea
pulled away yesterday from the Pa
cific Mail Company's wharf. Cargo,
United States mail '. and passengers
were on board, and at 1 o'clock the
big steamship was ready for sea. The
arrival of the Gaelic, however, with
mail that called for an immediate an
swer resulted in the holding of the
Korea for the company's letter bag.
When she left the dock the large crowd
that at 1 o'clock thronged the wharf
had thinned down to small proportions,
and her departure, made in a driving
rain, was rather cheerless. The Korea
carried 6S00 tons of cargo and cabin

Feedstuffs are steady, receipts having been
lighter during the past -two or three days.
Hay rules steady, but the trade Is stilt handi
capped by the lack of cars. Receipts are light.
The detailed statement of the stock on hand
November 1 appears in the first column.
The Hay circular of Somers A Co. says:
"In spite of the fact that hay shipments
hav e been decreasing durinjr the past week,
yet arrivals have been sufficient for all de
mands. The account shows a total of 1C0O
tons for the week or 200 tons less thaji for
the week preceding. The stormy weather has
interfered somewhat with the transaction of
business, but even since the weather cleared
the demand has not been at all brisk. This
condition of affairs cannot last very -much
longer, for from all reports we are convinced
that many of the- consumers will soon have
to come on to the market to supply their
needs. We hear no talk at present of "a dry
season." although the. precipitation in the
southern part of the State has not been at all
plentiful. The car situation is becoming more
critical, for the edict has now gone forth
from Southern Pacific officials that nothing
but dosed box cars shall be used for . bay.
During the past few weeks stock' cars have
been utilized for this purpose, which has In
creased Â¦ dally shipments by about 25 per cent.
We . may therefore look for a very light sup
ply of hay during December, and if the de
mand Improves prices should surely go higher.'
"Choice wheat hay continues to come -In
quite, freely, the cheaper grades of hay be
ing In very light supply at present. Alfalfa
continues to come in- large quantities by
water, but It can be expected that theffl_ar
rivals will stop very shortly. Straw U in
fairly good supply with no change in prices."

in the wheat pit was the urgent demand for

result of this combination the price took a
sharp upturn. With the exception of the con

favored the bulls, cables being higher, receipts
in the Northwest smaller* and -the cash demand
much improved. There was a good scattered
demand for both December and May at the
ftart. and the former month" or>ened Uc up
at 784c. Outside markets were ail higher. As
the price advanced there was considerable
buying by commission houses on stop orders,
which added to the etrength, and daring the
last hour the price rose rapidly. December sell
ing up to 7Â»4,c. Fears of the December shorts
that a deal was about to be sprung oa, them by
a big local operator was the primary cause for
the sudden anxiety to cover short lines. The

WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â Robert J.
Wynne, First Assistant Postmaster
General, in his" annual report to the
Postmaster General, recommends 'that
Congress authorizo the clerk hire al
lowance* at all third-class postoffices.
This,, it Is estimated, would entail an
appropriation of $2,200,000.
Wynne recommends a new classifica
tion law for clerks in first and second
class postoSces, creating a number of
nevr positions and abolishing' the titles
of all clerks below the grade of fore
man, simply designating as "clerks"
employes whose duties ara purely
clerical.
It is recommended that the maximum
allowance for fuel and light at third
class postoSces be increased from $60.
as now fixed, to ISO per annum. A
lump appropriation oÂ£ $20,000,000 Is
asked for clerks at first and second
class offices, instead of segregating
this appropriation into grades of clerks.
During the year the domestic. money
orders issued amounted to 1353.621,64 s *.
and the excess of receipts from this
source over expenses paid from the
proceeds was J1.394.SSS.
The receipts at the dead letter ofSce
of mail matter of all classes and from
all sources, which could not be deliver
ed, deciphered or were unmailable.
were 10.153.52S pieces, an increase of 8%
per cent-
Wynne urges legislation to abolish
the private letter-box abuse In the
large cities: to prevent the boycotting
of postoffices because of political dif
ferences, petty Jealousies, etc!; to pun
ish the use of a postmarking stamp for
any unlawful purpose; to absolutely
bar inflammable matter from the mails
and to further restrict the- mailing of
disease Verms.

named vessels will arrive here prior to Jan
uary 15, 1904. when thÂ« duty oa foreign coal
may b* renewed, and as the outward grain
freights from -the Colonies .to* Euroce are so
much in excess of the asking rates from here,
it is a natural Inf erence to suppose that coal
shipments this way will entirely cease: it can
safety be predicted that for the first hart of
the incoming year oar local coal supplies will
be furnished from the coast collieries alan*. It
Is figured. that the output of the oil wells In
California will reach this year In the vicinity
of 20.000.000 barrels: of coarse a Urge propor
tion of this is being refined, and considerable
is exported, yet It can be assuredly estimated
that it Â»s a disturbing factor in the consump
tion of coal. The outlook Is encouraging for
the maintenance of present values, particularly

UKIAH. Nov. 18.â Austin Muir. a
butcher, had a narrow escape from
drowning near 'Wllllts during the heavy
rain last week. The creeks in the LJt
tle Lake Valley are noted for the speed
with which the water riaes after a rain.
When Muir left for his ranch in the
eastern part of the valley early In the
morning to kill some cattle the cre*ka
were barely running. In the evening:
when he was returning he noticed that
the creeks he had to cross were rather
turbulent, and concluded to drive farther
up to the ford. As "he is an old resident
and knows the country well he had 'iib
difficulty in locating the usual ford, and
drove in. The water had risen and had
made the former crossing a raging
mountain torrent. The current turned
the wagon down stream and upset - it.
Muir was thrown into the watsr, and
after a hard struggle through floating,
driftwood and logs managed to reach the
bank, completely exhausted. His wagon
was found farther down the stream with
the front wheels missing. -It is said that
the sudden rise was due to a cloudburst
on the mountain. 7Z

Answers to the contest of the will of
the late Isabella Duncan Clark, who
committed suicide at McNutt's hospital
September 10, were filed yesterday by
Dr. W. F. McNutt, executor of the will,
and Grace K. Strohn, a sister of the
deceased. They deny that Miss Clark
was mentally unsound or unduly in
fluenced 1 when she made the will, the
day before she took her own life, and
ask that the win be admitted to pro
bate, and that they be given judgment
for their costs.
The contest was brought by Alice A.
Hart and Mary F. Carter, sisters of the
deceased, who were not remembered in
the will, Mrs. Struhn being the resid
uary legatee. They charged that their
sister was not in condition, mentally, to
make .the will and that she was unduly
influenced by Dr. McNutt.

Secretary L. M. King of the associa
tion has had prepared an enormous
map of North America and the Pacific
Ocean with 'the Intent "to show graphi
cally that San Francisco will be great
ly benefited by the construction of the
proposed isthmian . canal. He will de
monstrate by the map that vessels from
the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico
will pass within twenty miles of this
port on their way to either Yokohama
or Hongkong. On a flat surface it
would not appear that such would be
the shortest route, hut it is true, never

"Three years ago while engaged in
mining in the Solomon River country I
discovered that freight rates by. horse
or dog teams from Nome, to Council
City were on the average $55 a ton, an
amount which to men of ordinary
means was prohibitive. It occurred to
me that a steam railroad, even of
crude construction and with slow
trains, would save half of this money
to miners, and at the same time earn
large profits. I then returned to this
ctty and Interested Eastern capitalists
In the project, and the railroad is now
being built. Surveys for half, a dozen
routes were made, but the. best was
selected. Half a million dollars -is i be

this city .to work on the road, and
everything is going smoothly. Nearly
$500,000 has already been expended."

Judge Long also formally announced
yesteftlay that he would appoint John
S. Partridge to succeed Chief Deputy
George Lane. Partridge is a graduate
pf the University -of California and
Hastings College of the Law. He has
practiced for ten years and was chair
man of the late Republican convention.
City Attorney-elect Percy V. Long
announced yesterday that he would
retain William I. Brobeck as his second
assistant when he assumes office next
January. Brobeck has been eleven
years in the office and has handled
some of the most Important litigation
in which the city has ever been a par
ty. He is now conducting the national
bank tax cases in the United States
Supreme Court, and the taxing of bank
franchises and the tax case of the
United Railroads in the State Supremo
Court. The fact that he is familiar with
all the details of the litigation is the
mam reason for his retention by Long.
Brobeck's salary is $3000 a year. He
served under former City Attorney
Creswell and is now Lane's second as
sistant. He could have had the nom
ination for City Attorney on the Dem
ocratic ticket, but declined it He is
said by lawyers to be one cf the best
authorities in this city on municipal
and constitutional law. Brobeck was
offered the place several days ago, and
accepted it yesterday. Discussing the
matter Mr. Brobeck said yesterday:
"It is true that I have consented to
accept reappointment under Judge
Long. While it Is my desire to retire
to private practice, the rewards of
which more nea'rly compensate for the
services rendered, I feel ' that I owe
something to the citizens of San Fran
cisco, In whose service as Assistant
City Attorney I have been so long. A
change of counsel in some of the im
portant litigation now in my care
would place the city's interest at a se
rious disadvantage. I have had the de
fense of the national bank tax cases,
which are now upon the calendar of
the United States Supreme Court for
argument next April. The city has been
successful in these cases in the United
States Circuit Court and in the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals. To
change attorneys now might be disas
trous to the city's interests. The same
is true of the San Mateo Railway case,
now under submission in our Supreme
Court, upon the decision of which de
pends the power of local assessment of
the properties of the United- Railways,
and also of a number of cases In the
State and Federal courts involving the
taxation of franchises."

at least one branch in each county.' In
many of the towns In the State the
branches have died out and others have
never had any. The association has

of the San Francisco Labor Council,
made the opening , addresses. Mr.
Leavitt encouraged the women in, the
good work he said they were doing and
said the greater number of^the prom
inent suffrage workers in the United
States were Unitarians. Mr. Benham
said he had always been a suffragist,
his mother was one; that he was in
favor of equal rights to all and would
present the merits of "the question

and the labor organizations.

A. Gordon, who occupied the second
story of the tenement, and S. Candeot
to, who cobbled shoes in the front room
of the ramshackle structure, responded
to Mrs. Campodonico's call, but the
dog denied them entrance to his home
until one of the men was forced to
kick him out of the way. Then the
beast's snarl changed to a pitiful
whine and he retreated to the side of
his dead mistress and fondly licked one
of her cold hands. When the men at
tempted to touch the corpse the dog
again resented their intrusion and
snapped and growled until they satis
fied themselves that the object on the
floor was beyond human aid. Then
they went and notified the Coroner,
leaving the dog alone with its dead.
While Deputy Coroner Brown was
removing the body the dog could
scarcely be restrained from flying at
him. When the corpse was driven
away in the morgue wagon the faith
ful animal lay down and howled In
distress. All day he stayed there and
the humble folk in the- neighborhood
supplied him with food, which, how
ever, he refused to touch, although it
was evident that he had npt eaten
since his mistress fed him:
Mrs. Periera was a widow, about 70
years of age, and lived in abject pov
erty. For her food she was dependent
upon the charity of her neighbors,
most of whom are almost as poverty
stricken as she was, a'nd the miserable
room in which she lived was only paid
for when she had a few cents. All that
her acquaintances knew concerning her
was summed up in the information
imparted by Cobbler Candeotto:
"She vfcray old an' she veray seeck
alia time. Hosband? No. Cheeldren?
No. She onlay have dog."
Mrs. Campodonico stated that Mrs.
Periera had been her tenant about sev
en months and that she paid her rent
when she had money. "Which was
veray sel-dom," sighed ,Mrs. Campo
donico. /.''
The woman died some time Monday
nlght t and her fate was not dis
covered until about 10 o'clock yester
day morning, when the owner of the
tenement, Mrs. S. Campodonico of
1817% Powell street, went to collect her
rent. She found the door of Mrs. Per
iera's apartment open, and when she
attempted to enter an angry growl and
a display of glistening, teeth drove her
back. The little dog that had been her
tenant's sole companion stood in the
doorway and angrily refused to be
scared away. While attempting to ap
pease the animal's wrath with soft
words Mrs. Campodonico caught a
glimpse of the interior of the room and
what she saw caused her to run in af
fright and cry for aid. The uncovered
bed was empty, but alongside it, wrap
ped in a dirty and ragged blanket, lay
the form of a woman.
Canine fidelity has seldom found
more pathetic exemplification than in
the guarding of his mistress' remains
by the pretty fox terrier that shared
the squalid home of Mrs. Maria Per
iera at 2 Washoe place, a cul-de-sac on
Vallejo street, between Powell and Ma
son.
â¢ The resolution proposed by Superin
tendent Langdon that the daily ses

Resolved, That not less than twenty minutes'
Instruction â¢ during Â¦ each school week ; shall bÂ«
given In all the primary, grammar . and high

and hygiene, with special reference to the ef

classes.
Under soeclal directors of manual' train-
Ing, â¢ physical culture, cooking, 'music and
drawing, work in these subjects has been eo
systematized that pupils may pass from grade
to crude or school to school without ' loss' of
time. It 'Is the aim of the superintendent's of
fice to systematize the work In the common
branches In similar manner. Â¦ It Is believed that
by simplifying method*, by cutting out non
essentials, by laying greater emphasis -on es
sentials, by correlating subjects, the work may
be greatly lightened for both teachers and
pupils.- . . ; i Â¦ â¢ .-

WORK IS SYSTEMATIZED!
The preparation of a graded course
of study in drawing was referred to the
Superintendent of Schools, the course
to, take effect January 11, 1904...
' Superintendent Langdon filed- his
monthly report on the standing of
schools, 398 of which were Inspected by
his department.. The report says that
while all the schools are working yn
der the same course of , study it is
found that much still needs to be done
to unify the work. Different meth
ods are used and subjects are treated
from different points of view. The re
port concludes:
The loss of time in passing from grade to
grade has been largely overcome by the efforts
of principals in unifying the work within each
school.
In accordance with the recommenda
tion of Principal Bush of the Polytech
nic High School, Mrs.' Irene D. Reeves
was, by consolidation, left out of her
position as teacher in the school and
was placed on the unasslgned list of
teachers without pay. Director Walsh
voted against ousting Mrs.' Reeves.
The latter once before lost her position
under similar circumstances, but the
Superior Court ordered th? board- to re
instate her with the payment of sev
eral thousand dollars in back salary.
Bush petitioned the board to transfer
Mrs. Reeved to some other school on
the ground that she was employed but
half a day in her teaching. He has
also filed charges against her, but ap
pears unwilling to press them. Bush's
recommendation that an additional
teacher in freehand drawing be ap
pointed was taken under advisement.
i The board adopted the recommenda
tion of Superintendent Langdon that
the drawing course be revised, as fol
lows: ' _
First, that the drawing work be con
tinued as at present until Thanksgiv
ing.
Second, that from Thanksgiving until
Christmas the work be upon Christmas
cards, and
Third, that at the beginning of the
new term simpler models be furnished
the teachers by the drawing supervisor.

The board dismissed James Gannon,
janitor of the Lincoln Grammar School,
and appointed Joseph Cohen to the va
cancy. Cohen was designated as head
Janitor of the school, with a salary of
$140, but he will probably have to em
ploy an assistant and pay him out of
his own salary.
RULE IS VIOLATED.
The Board of Education yesterday by
a vote of three to one summarily dis
missed Miss Jean A- Dwyer, acting
principal of the South End School,
from 'the public school department.
The board adopted a resolution finding
Miss Dwyer guilty of having ! violated
a rule of the department in having ad
ministered excessive punishment to
one of her pupils. Director Woodward
was the only one to vote against Miss
Dwyer's dismissal, he holding to the
opinion that the charge was not suf
ficient to warrant such action. The
resolution of dismissal, which was pre
sented by Director Mark, follows:
Whereas. On September 30. 1903, charges of
violation of the rules of the Board of Education
having been regularly and formally presented
In accordance with law by Superintendent of
Common Schools W. H. Langdon against Mis?
