when the President's carriage, contain

drove up to the shed in front of the
station. The heavy wagc-n'in charge of
the soldier was in the path of the con
veyance from the White House, and
the artilleryman was requested to drive
on a few feet by Policeman Whalen. ;
Instead of .complying, Young began to
swear and was arrested.
When the case was called in court to
day Young said he had had a drink of
whisky and might have made use of
bad . language, but he was not sure.
Young enlisted in the army two years

Horn seemed to slowly yield and
finally] knelt "down and prayed with the
minister. . After the service, Horn de
clared to Mr,"; Watson that he realized
his position and that there was no hope
for him. .He then; told the minister that
he, had been "reading ; the Bible given
him and "that heVdesired, as a cowboy,
to -say he would -/'go straight" to his
Maker." . . . .
Horn, realizing that all . hope; was
gone,' prepared to-night to meet his
God. Rev. Mr. Watson of St." Mark's
Episcopal Church, assisted 1 by a choir
of three, held a service in the , cell of
the condemned cattle detective this
evening, at which Horn for the first
time succumbed to religious influence.
The service was a dramatis one and
during'the singing of the hymn, "Jesus,
Lover of^My Soul," Horn first showed
a' realization ' of his position. During
Mr. Watson's prayer "Jim" ; McLoud,'
who broke jail with Horn last summer,
burst, into passionate weeping.
CONDEMNED * MAN : PRAYS.
k Word was received to-day that
Horn's friends would attempt hls^ rescue
to-night. The, force of guards has been
doubled and ..the full strength of; the
militia companies is thrown I about the
jail. .If Horn's friends come there will
be one of 'the bloodiest battles In the
history of the West, arid if the attack
ing party should v succeed in storming
the Jail they will not get Horn, for he
will b? A shot down by the guards. These
are the orders given them."
GRIM. ORDER TO GTJARDS.
When Horn Is placed on the trap he
will set in motion the machinery of
death, his own weight opening a valve
causing water, to flow from a vessel.
When sufficient water has escaped a
heavy weight will fall to the floor,
jerking the hinged prop from under
the trap and Horn will drop six feet
and four inches. The gallov/s, -which
Is erected in one corner ' of the jail,
within twenty ; feet of Horn and In
plain view, was tested to-night with
bags of sand of Horn's weight. The
rope was tested ' with a 400- pound
weight. Everything is ih readiness for
the execution. ' . . .. ,
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 19.âPrep
arations were to-night completed for
the execution of Tom Horn, ex-army
scout, range stock detective, paid as
sassin of the cattle barons and reputed
slayer, of -half a dozen men, who will
be hanged at "11 o'clock to-morrow for
the murder of William Nickoll of Iron
Mountain. Horn -will be his own ex
ecutioner. He will be taken from the
death chamber at 10:30 o'clock, his
arms and legs strapped/and before
stepping on the gallows will be per
mitted to bid his friends good-by and
make any address to the newspaper
men he desires.
: Cheyenne is filled with cowboys from
all- parts of this State, Colorado and
even New Mexico/, Bets of $50 arid 5100
are being made at even money that
Horn will-not hang." -The officials ac
cept these bets as meaning there will be
an attempt to rescue Hern.
Yi Horn was given letters to-night from
,hls two sisters, one in Canada and one
in' Missouri; and their heartbreaking
farewells failed to break down his mar
velous composure." -
The vigilance of the authorities "and
their fear of the desperation of Horn's
friends is evidenced by the fact that
Charley Irwin, a prominent cowboy and
a devoted frisnd.of Horn, this after
noon obtained a letter from Governor

the latter deemed it safe, to permit Ir

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Wyoming's Governor Warned That
His Assassination Will Follow
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 19.â At the
door of the Arcade depot, in the midst
of a crowd of 200 or more people and
before the eyes of scores of them. Hen
ry C. Roemer, until recently a consta
ble at Downey, this county, shot his
wife in the head, and then waiting for
her to arise and while her children
ivere clinging to her skirts shot her
again through the body. Before any
person cculd interfere he turned his re
volver upon himself and sent a bullet
through his heart, falling dead.
The tragedy occurred at 6 o'clock this
evening, when hundreds of persons
from the suburban trains and those
who were about to leave on/ outgoing
trains were crowding into the Southern
Pacific depot. The woman's wounds are
not necessarily fatal, and the surgeons
at the Receiving Hospital, whither she
was taken, say that she has more than
an even chance of recovery-
Whisky and Jealousy of his ex-con
vict brother prompted Roemer to com
mit the crime, which, had he succeeded
as he intended, would have left his two
little girls, aged 4 and 6 years, parent
less. They were witnesses to his at
tempt upon their mother's life and of
his own suicide. 'Possibly, the last
words he heard was the' screaming ap
peal of his elder daughter, who after
her mother had once been shot turned
upon the father and pleaded, with ter
ror in her voice and eyes.
"Oh, papa, papa, don't hurt mamma
any more."
In another Instant he had fired the
second shot at his wife and his third
ended his own life.
Roemer was perhaps the best-known
citizen of the Downey district. For
years he had been Constable" and
Deputy Sheriff there. A few months
ago he was convicted of selling liquor
without a license and paid a heavy fine.
As a result his Deputy Sheriff's star
was taken from him and he was obliged
to resign as Constable.
Four years ago his brother, Frank
Roemer, killed a man named Ullery
near Downey and was sentenced to ten
years in the penitentiary. Governor
Gage paroled Roemer and the latter
returned to Downey and began living
at the home of his brother. Henry
Roemer became jealous and after a vio
lent quarrel he swore out an insanity
complaint against his wife. She was
committed to the Highland Asylum.
A month or two ago she was dis
charged as cured and returned home.
Again Frank Roemer began showing
her attentions and this so enraged
Henry that the latter began drinking
heavily. A man of quiet habits when
sober, he was converted Into almost a
demon by drink, and for tho past two
weeks there had been constant quarrels
between him and his wife.
According to her statement, he final
ly refused to provide food for his fam
ily, and this morning there was noth
ing to eat In the house. She then told
him she would come to Los Angeles to
the home of her father and there se
cure food for her children. Despite his
repeated warnings she packed her be
longings and boarded the train. As
the train neared Los Angeles he en
tered the car. He, too, had boarded the
train without her knowledge. He de
manded that she return home, but she
refused. He waited until she had
reached the door of the depot and then
confronted her, and despite the fact
that scores of persons were crowding
past them, he stopped her in the nar
row passage and demanded to know if
Ehe intended to leave him. When she
answered that she did, he drew a re
volver and shot her through the cheeks.
There was a panic among those in the
depot and no person tried to interfere.
Mrs. Roemer fell to the floor, but soon
staggered to her feet and begged her
busband not to shoot her. Their terri
fied children were clinging to their
mother's skirts and screaming to their
father not to hurt .their mother, but
Roemer, as soon as the woman gained
her feet, pressed the revolver against
her right arm and fired a bullet through
her body. As she fell he sent a bullet
through his own heart.
While their mother was being lifted
on a stretcher to be conveyed to a
hospital the two little girls were lifted
over the body of their father and taken
to the home of their grandparents.
Late to-night it was given out at the
hospital that the woman will speedily
recover unless blood poisoning super
venes. . -
but only twenty-three members second
ed the demandâ an Insufficient number.
William Alden Smith (R.) of Michi
gan demanded a division, and on a ris
ing vote the ayes were 335 and the noes
2L This passed the bill. : â¢
er entertained the appeal.
Payne moved to lay the appeal on
the table, and his motion was carried
by a. vote of 193 to 165, a strict party
alignment.
On the passage of the bill an attempt
was made to secure an aye and no vote, (
Just before 4 o'clock Payne of New
York said he did not care to talk fur
ther, and Williams moved to recommit
the bill to the Ways .and Means Com
mittee, with instructions in the line of
the amendments previously proposed.
The Speaker ruled the motion to be out
of order. Williams appealed from the
decision of the chair and asked to be f
heard on the point of order. Payne
raised a point of order, but the Speak-
"Well." responded Williams, "If I am.
the Lord knexs I am unconscious of it.
But I would say the length It would
take would depend upon the care and
etrenuosity brought -Into action at the
other end of the avenue. If you could
just half-way approximate the celerity
that has lately actuated this adminis
tration in connection with the new
born republic of Panama you would
have it back here in three days."
"But the minds of all the mighty
Caesars In another place have not op
crated on this Panama business yet.
and they have operated on this treaty,"
said Payne.
"They will operate In some way or
another." Eald Williams, "providing the
trust is not hurt. They are waiting
for us."
Payne replied: "The gentleman is try
ing to help the sugar trust by his
amendment."
"Protection is a system 'of taxation
Â¦whereby many are robbed in order that
& few may be hothoused by legislation
Into artificial prosperity."
Williams charged that the Republi
cans did not desire to enter upon tariff
revision for fear It would open the
doors to too extended a revision. The
Republicans had a majority In the
House and Senate and ''a very large
majority in the White House." Some
cf the pledges of prosperity of the ma
jority were aJready collapsing. The
people, he said, were beginning to find
that their laws were keeping In power
cot only monopolies, but public cheats.
WilU^ms (D.) of Mississippi, leader of
the minority, answering a statement on
the Republican side that the Democrats
forced the talk on this bill, said he had
offered to have a vote on the minority
amendment and the vote on the bill
â¢without debate. Replying to Watson.
Williams said:
Watson (R.) of Indiana, one of the
new members on the Ways and Means
Committee, favored the bllL
Sulzer (D.) of New York paid he would
vote for the bill, as it was, a little step
In the rig-ht direction.
Hepburn (R.) of Iowa followed,'say
ing at the outset that he would \-ote for
the bill, but with reluctance. He said
he was not one of those who believed
he owed Cuba anything. This country
had spent $300,000,000 or J400.000.000 and
sacrificed many lives that Cuba might
be relieved from oppression. Hepburn
Eaid he believed in Republican reci
procityâthe reciprocity of McKinley.
In this connection he quoted from the
speech made by the late President at
Buffalo. He declared that there was
nothing in that speech that differed one
lota from the stable, established pollcy
cf the Republican party; there was
absolutely nothing in that speech to
chow that McKinley was approaching
free trade.
Broussard CD.) of Louisiana opened
the debate to-day. He opposed ' the
measure and said it was not In line
with Democratic tariff reform. . â¢ .
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â The House
/to-day, by a rising vote of 335 to 21.
i passed the bill to make effective the
â¢ Cuban reciprocity treaty. The dissent
,*icg votes were about equally divided
1 between Republicans and Democrats.
i but there was no record vote, the
. minority having too few votes to order
the ayes and noes.
The Democrats, under the leadership
of Williams, sought to the last to ob
tain amendments to the bill in accord
ance with the action of the Democratic
.caucus, but were defeated steadily.
Williams made the final effort when he
tried to have the bill recommitted to
the Ways and Means Committee, with
Instructions to amend, but a point of
.crder. under the special rule providing
for a vote on the bill Â¦without interven
ing motion, was sustained.
Cannon received Williams' appeal
" from his ruling, saying he preferred to
err. If he erred at all, in giving the
.K^use the right to express its will.
The appeal was tabled by a strict party
vote.

Out of thirty-five men who constituted
the crew of the work train only four
are living, and two of these are seri
ously Injured. Wreckage Is strewn
along the track for 200 feet and twenty
four hours will elapse before it can be
cleared.
One of the last bodies recovered was
that of William Bailey, who had been
thrown thirty feet into the air and held
In place by two steel rails which had
been pushed up between the locomotive
and the tender of the work train. The
workmen had been laying fails at dif
ferent points along the track.
The Injured were taken to the two
cabooses of the relief train, where hos
pitals were Improvised. One caboose
was taken to Morton, while the other
was taken to Tremcmt. Widows and
orphans thronged around the wreck to
night asking for information.
ENGINEEB'S LEAP FOR LIFE.
When about two miles from Nincrt
and enteriPS a cut, each engineer saw
the other f.pproachinj; train, and. real
izing that it was impossible to stop,
each threw on the emergency brake,
whistled twice and then leaped from
his cab.
The collision was seen by Russell
Noonan, who hastened to a nearby
house and telephoned to Tremont. A
special train with four physicians was
made up in a few minutes and in less
than a half hour was at the wreck. At
the same time another train arrived
from Peking, bearing Superintendent
Barnard of the Big Four and three
physicians. The second train bore a
number of Turkish rugs, and these were
utilized to carry out the bodies of the
victims. After working two hours the
bodies of twenty-six men were taken
out and laid on an embankment near
the side of the track.

Conductor J. W. Jude of Indianap

train, received orders at Urbana, it is
said, to wait at Mackinaw for the work
train. The freight train did not stop.
The engineer of the work train. George
B. Thacker, had orders. It Is said, to
pass the freight train at Mackinaw and
was on the way thither. The work
train was about five minutes late and
was running at full speed in order to
make ud time.
LIST OF THE - VICTIMS..
A 6econd after the collision the boiler
of the work train exploded, throwing
iron bars and timbers a distance of 200
feet., . . ... ... -. . - - â¢.-â¢.--
The collision occurred in a deep cut
at the beginning of a sharp curve,
neither train being visible to the crew
of the other until they were within
fifty feet of each other. The engineers
set the brakes, sounded the whistles and
then jumped. The trains struck with
such force that the crash was heard a
mile away.
PEORIA, 111., Nov. 19.â Thirty-one
men were killed and at least fifteen
injured to-day in a head-end collision
between a west-bound freight train and
a work train- on the Cleveland. Cincin
nati, Chicago and St. Louis Railrojfd,
between Mackinaw and Tremont, 111.
All of the bodies have been taken from
the debris, which Is piled thirty feet
high on the tracks â a huge pile of
broken timber and twisted and dis
torted iron and steel. The bodies are
mangled so that many are unrecogniz
able. All of the dead and most of the
injured were members of the work
train. The crews on both locomotives
jumped to save their lives.
The Count was asked: "Then Russia
has agreed not to oppose the open door
or commercial facilities ?' to which he
replied: SkSK
"The principle of Chinese sovereignty
must be upheld, with all it Implies.
Russian troops may remain as railway
guards, not as a sign of Russian sov
ereignty. The country must remain
China's, and the treaties will hold good
in every detail. New ports are opened
by China In Manchuria under her new
treaties. The door is open and our
traders are in Manchuria n towns now.
KOREA MTJST BE LET ALONE.
"Japan demands that the sovereign
rights of China and the open door for
trade should be maintained. Ih this
Great Britain - and the United States
support her. I do not think Russia will
or can object, but oÂ£ course I cannot
tell you anything about the negotia
tions now pending."
Turning to Korea the .Count was
asked if there was any statement of
Japan's views that could be sent to
England. The Premier replied that it
was an avowed principle of Japanese
policy that no other power must med
dle with Korea. Any outside inter
ference there, he said. wouM certainly
be a casus belli, but nothing of the sort
was likely to occur.
The interviewer, remarked: "But
there have been many reports of recent
Russian encroachments and intrigue in
Korea."
The Premier said: "Some of these
reports are erroneous; due to excessive
zeal on the part of Russian officials."
"If Russia does not keep faith it is to
her discredit, but it is no casus belli to
Japan. All that talk is a mistake.
There Is no difference of opinion in our
Cabinet. The British opinion seems to
be that if Russia will not withdraw it
is no use making a fuss so long as tha
open door is guaranteed, with full
maintenance of treaty rights; and the
British view Is our view in this mat
ter."
Asked about the view expressed la
seme Japanese papers that Russia's re
cent action amounted to an attack;
that the retention of Russian troops in
Manchuria was fa challenge which Ja
pan must accept, the Count replied:
"No, it is nothing of the kind. That
is only a little newspaper sensational
ism. The agitation in the Japanese
press about Russia's pledge. to evacuate
Manchuria does not represent the views
of the Japanese Government. Russia
only said that to China as a mere vol
untary promise. It was no pledge to
Japan; it cannot be Insisted upon by
Japan as an obligation.
NOT A PLEDGE TO JAPAN.
"The outer world," he said, "is told
of one man who shouts for war, but
the ninety and nine who do not are not
mentioned. You, who live In Japan,
can see for yourselves how universally
quiet is the tone of press and speaker.
"If war should be forced upon us, that
is another thing. We are absolutely
prepared to defend our national exist
ence at any moment. I feel sure there
is no danger of any such emergency,
but we are ready."
The Daily Mail's Tokio correspond
ent has received telegrams from Seoul
saying that the Russian Minister has
again successfully interfered to pre
vent the opening of Tongampho, con
sent to which the Korean Foreign Min
ister was on the point of communicat
ing to the British, American and Jap
anese Ministers on Tuesday last.
The Times Shanghai correspondent
says that a private letter from an of
ficial at Moukden states that the Rus
sians have treated the native authori
ties with the vitmost Indignity, openly
declaring that $nÂ».rÂ»pc.iui 1 Â«atiaii ~,&a tn
tended as" an intimation that Russia
would not permit the exercise of treaty
rights in Manchuria and claiming that
the United States and Japan had re
cently concluded a convention.
Count Katsura, the Japanese Pre
mier, in an interview with the corre
spondent of the Manchester Guardian

to think the Japanese were eager to
fight.

"Oh, must I always be the veiled
woman? Will people always stare at
my face because it is ugly, just as they
were formerly attracted by my
beauty?" \
In the bitterness of her humiliation
Mrs. Brannen complained in this way
to her maid. A disease of the skin had
marred her beauty, and it waa testi
fied that she brooded over the fact con
tinually. Mrs. Brannen Is reported to
have once been one of the most beau
tiful women in Denver. Four years
ago she was taken sick. In the per

DRIVES WOMAN" TO SUICIDE
DENVER, Nov. 19.â Rev. Father Fe
lix Mariano Lepore, pastor of Mount
Carmel Catholic Church in this city,
who was shot in his apartments last
night by Joseph Sorice of PIttsburg,
Pa., died to-night and the physicians
say that Sorice, who was shot by the
clergyman, cannot recover. The story
that they quarreled over a card game
is discredited. It is believed that they
disagreed over money matters.
In an ante-mortem statement made
to Judge Sales of the District Attor
ney's office Father Lepore said> that he
believed his assailant had been sent
out to Denver for the purpose of kill
ing him. Since his first conversation
with Sorice when he came to this city
about a month ago, Father Lepore
said,- he had feared the man and- had
thought that his life was in danger.
Sorice refused to say a word either to
the District.Attorney's representatives
or to the detectives. â¢Â«?Â¦*;*!;
Before coming to Denver- in 1892
Father Lepore* 'conducted a banking
business in New York,'where it is said
he failed" for a 'considerable amount.
Among, the creditors, it is said, was
Giuseppe Pasquel, a partner of Joseph
Sorice, who. came to Denver with the
latter about a month and a. half ago.
Frank Lepore,' a "nephew, of the priest,
said that' Pasquel had made a demand
on Father Lepore a few days ago for
$240, which he claimed the priest owed
him. -Young Lepore. advised his uncle
to give* 1 the man the money, but he
did -not do. so. However, he provided a
house and employment , for Sorice. and
Pasquel./ Frank Lepore said that his
uncle had known Sorice and Pasquel
in Italy. Efforts are being made to
flnd-?Pasxiuel. It is believed that be
hind the' tragedy lies a jnystery evtctl
liig'l'ack" to old times"' In Italy, which
it'is feared will never be solved because
of the' secretive nature of the Italians.
.PITTSBURG. Nov.- 19:â Father Le
pore is. well known by â¢Italian priests
in .'Pittsburg. Besides being ' popular,
his friends 'say he invented a railroad
brake and other mechanical devices.
"Each body of immigrants, each ele
ment that has thus been added to our
national strain, has contributed some
thing of value to the national charac
ter; and to no element do we owe more
than we owe to that element represent
ed by, those whom I have the honor this
day of addressing."
"You are right, Mr. Chairman, when
you speak of the stand that the German
element in our citizenship ha3 always
taken in all crises of our national life.
In the first place, from the beginning
of our. colonial history to this day, the
German strain has been constantly in-
I creasing in importance among the many
strains that go to make up our com
"pjosite national character. I do not !
have to repeat to you the story of the 1
early German immigration to this
country, the German immigration that
began in a mass toward the end of the i
seventeenth century. You are entirely
familiar, of course, with the German
immigration that went to the formation
of Pennsylvania from the beginning.
That element was equally strong in the
Mohawk Valley in New York; and it
was equally strong in Middle and West
ern Maryland. For Instance, in the
Revolutionary war, one of the distin
guished figures contributed by New
York to the cause of Independence was
that of the German, Herkimer, whose
fight in the Mohawk Valley represented
one of the turning points in the strug
gle for independence, and one of the
New York counties is now named after
him. The other day I went out to the
battlefield of Antietam,*in Maryland.
There the memorial church Is the Ger
man Lutheran Church, which was
founded in 1768, the settlement of the
neighborhood of Antietam being origi
nally exclusively a German settlement.
"In the Civil War It would be difficult
to paint In too strong colors what -I
may well-nigh call the all-Importance
of the attitude of the American citizens
of German birth and extraction toward
the cause of union and liberty, especial
ly in what were known then as the bor
der States. It would have been out of
the question to keep Missouri loyal had
it not been for the German j element
there. It was the German portion of
the city of St. Louis which formed the
core of the Union cause in Missouri.
And only little less Important was the
part played by the Germans in Mary
land and also in Louisville and other
portions of Kentucky.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â President
Roosevelt received to-day in the east
room of the White House about 150
representatives of the German societies
of Washington, to whom he delivered
a brief address. The delegates called
on the. President formally to announce
to him the opening next Monday even
ing of their celebration of the two hun
dred and fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of Germantown, Pa., and to

and the newspapers were recounting
his crime?, T. W. Parker has for thrÂ«;e
days QomiiiueiJ to issue forged checks
and gf t them cashed by various busi

tims. He Is the sonof Colonel Parktr,
a wealthy mining man, stock raiser
and ex -Congressman, now living at
Deer Lodge, Mont.
Young Parker was onoo sentenced to
the "Walla Walla penitentiary for for
gery. Since Saturday last he has
cashed $300 worth of checks in this

MARTINEZ, Nov. 19.â Andrew Caa
tro, charged with the kidnaping of Ade
laide Chatham, 4 years old, daughter ol
D. W. Chatham, a Martinez black
smith, has confessed his guilt to Sheriff
Veale. To-day in the Jail he told the
peace officer that he will plead guilty
when the case is called on Monday be
fore Superior Judge Wells. In hla con
fession Castro exonerated Ralph Young.
19 years old, who had been arrested
because he had been traveling with tha
kidnaper.
Castro's crime was as bold as It was
extraordinary- On Saturday, October
24, he drove into Martinez with a buggy
and passed by the Chatham residence
about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Lit
tle Adelaide was playing in front of
the house when Castro accosted tha
child, inviting her to take a ride with
him. At first the little one refused to
go, but Castro persisted and at last by
promising to buy her a birthday pres
ent persuaded the tot to accompany
him.
With his innocent companion the
burly kidnaper started away # . Fortu
nately a neighbor noticed the'palr and
gave the alarm. One hundred of the
townspeople responded to the clanging
of the fire bell. Castro had driven
rapidly and was well out of the town
when the searching posse started.
Three hours afterward Castro was
overtaken on the county road. It was
only by the exercise of great self-con
trol that a lynching was prevented.
Cool heads took charge and the prison-'
er was speedily sent to the County Jail,
while the baby was restored to her anx
ious parents.
Sheriff Veale has been busy with his
prisoner, with the result that Castro
to-day made a confession. Young, who
has been in Jail since Castro's arrest,
will be released after his former com
panion's case has been settled in court.
The authorities have found that the
kidnaper served two terms in the peni
tentiary at San Quentin. having been
last discharged in July, 1901, after com
pleting a two years' sentence for grand
larceny in Santa Barbara County.
Special Dispatch to The Call.

TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 19.â After
wandering about in the mountains with
snow up to his waist four days and four

PRESENTS TWO REPORTS
MARTINEZ, Nov. 19.â Sheriff Veale
of Contra Costa County to-night re
ceived word from Portland, 'Or.', to call
for Louis Daulton, who is at present at
Portland, but who is wanted in Pinole
on a serious charge. This is one of the"
most conspicuous cases that has come
before the courts "of Oregon. Daulton
was accused ' by' Florence Archey' 'of
Pinole. The woman" declared that she
had been wronged. Before an arrest
could be made, Daulton fled to Port
land, Or., where his family resided.
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
went to Portland with extradition pa
pers and endeavored to secure posses
sion of the accused man.
The Governor of Oregon "watf absent
at the tiifte, and Veale secured^xtradi
tion papers signed by the private secre
tary of the Governor. The friends of
Daulton who reside in Portland claimed
that papers signed by the private secre
tary of the Governor were not suffi
cient and as there was no Lieutenant
Governor in that State at the time,
Sheriff Veale did not know what to do.
The case was sent to the Supreme
Court of Oregon, but in the meantime
Sheriff x Veale secured extradition pa
pers from the Secretary of State of Ore
gon.
The extradition papers from the pri
vate secretary of the Governor of Ore
gon have been declared invalid by the
Supreme Court, but the extradition pa
pers from the Secretary of State have
been held to be valid. It Is upon these'
papers that Daulton will be extradited.
The case, has become notable because
of the clash of authority in Oregon.
Sheriff Veale made every effort to bring
his man back, but, was met at. every
turn with technicalities which were in.
terposed by the friends and relatives of
Daulton krOregorf.

DOAN'S KIDNEY PTTiLfl.
A GREAT, TRUTH.
How It Has Spread From Horns to Bom*
In San Franciaco.
In every part of San Francisco. In the
homes of the wealthy. In the humble
abode of the man of toil, 'tis now a
well-known fact â a grreat trutli â that
Doan'a Kidney Pills have brought more
comfort to backache sufferers and cured
more sick kidneys than any medicine or
modern time. _ .
John Lewis, tailor, rear of 721 Busa
street, says: "An attack of malaria, as
In the majority of Instances, was follow-
ed by inactivity of the kidneys and a
lameness and soreness across the sm Â»"
of my back. Sitting, as I am compelled
to do, practically stooped, strained tne
muscles of the loins; an aching ensued,
and when I straightened I couKI only
describe the twinges which shot t h roÂ«sn
the small of my back as Â«cruc ating.
With the passing of time pain in-
creased until I was compelled to stop
work. I knew something had l *? t _ bo ,?^ n ?
or my case might become serious, and I
commenced taking 8tandard m^, e a m n t fn
guaranteed to cure kidney complaint in
Iny of its -various forms. The results
obtained from the medicines ceased tha

I knew after k dose or two they were

Since then there has been some cor

objected to was that a hymn was sung
at the opening of the affair. In her
reply to that complaint Miss Gould told
him it has been her wish to have the

reading from the scriptures, but out of
deference to tlw- Roman Catholic chil

this done. In the future her original j

served and the Catholic children-par
took of it, unmindful of the day. As

he put the school under a ban.

It has repeatedly been charged that
the guards maintained by the Victor
Fuel Company around its property at
Hastings and Delagua have prevented
peaceable citizens passing through
the towns along the public highways,
although it is said Hastings is an in
corporated town and tha streets and
roads leading to the place have been
dedicated to public use. It is claimed
that the companies' guards have made
arrests without warrant and committed
other illegal acts. The miners' union
.officials say that every effort will be ]
made to prevent these alleged infrac- i
tions of the law. j
Sheriff Clark went to Hastings to- j
day and served injunction papers on !
the Victor Fuel Company restraining 'Â¦
It from preventing entrance to the
town, and the case will be argued be
fore District Judge Northcutt to-mor

MINERS' FAMILIES EVICTED.
Eviction of the miners' families from
company houses at Hastings continues.
Many tents and supplies were sent
there to-day by the union, the tents
being placed on the ground adjoining

PARIS, Nov. 19.â In the presence of
a crotvded Chamber to-day Deputy Des
chanel, Republican, formerly president
of the Chamber, began the discussion of
the Foreign Office budget. The key
note of DeschaneJ's speech was the far
reaching effects of the Improved rela
tions between France and England.
He pointed out that England's great
commercial . rivals to-day were the
United States and Germany.
Adverting to Morocco Deschanel said
France had no intention, to make war
upon that country. France wished
neither military adventure nor the par
tition of Morocco and she had no desire
to conquer Siam. There existed no
question which could not be settled by
diplomacy or arbitration. The Deputy
further declared that those who were
responsible for armed peace were those
whq refused to discuss the proposal for
disarmament. It would be a crime, he
added, to Beek to" raise issues between
Great Britain and France. The' rela
tions between France and Italy, were
friendly, but the alliance with Russia
must be ' the cornerstone of ' French
policy. Deschanel said that the pos
sibility of a conflict in Central Asia .was
diminishing, and even Korea .was: not
likely to produce trouble, Â¦ as the ; Gov-_
ernmenta of the United :', States : and
Great Britain were counseling Japan to
prudence. .

ROME, Nov. 19.â For some time the
volcano of Stromboli has been showing
signs of increased activity, emitting
considerable quantities of smoke, ashes
and redhot stones, accompanied by loud
detonations.
The opening of a new crater was sig
nalized by a tremendous report. L
The eruption continues, but it is at
present impossible to Judge of its vol
ume or its consequences because of a
thick cloud of smoke and ashes.

"Prince" Nanzeta Montezuma, who
claims that the blood of the ancient
Montezumas courses through his veins
and makes other assertions that would
cause many to suspect that he has a
right to lay claim of relationship to the
late Ananias, dropped into the city yes
terday and is registered at the Lick.
The "Prince," who says his domain is
located on the southern border of Mex
ico and Is known as the Sacred City,
is accompanied by his wife, an attrac*
tlve young woman, whom, he says, was
formerly a Miss Posey of this city. He
claims to have married her in Kansas
City about three months ago.
In Denver several days ago the
young descendant of the Aztecs made
the statement to the papers that he
was on his way to San Francisco to
marry the daughter of a former candi
date for Mayor and showed no hesi
tancy In discussing the proposed matri
monial venture. Last night, however,
he denied this interview and attributed
the fact that he did not acknowledge
his wife in Denver to a desire to con
ceal for "personal reasons" his mar
riage. . - 'y.J
For several months "Prince" Nan
zeta Montezuma has attracted atten
tion in the Eastern cities by his stories
of his duels in Mexico and his many
other adventures, which apparently
have all occurred in a very short space
of time, for he is only 28 years of age
and would look much younger if shorn
of his long, raven black hair. Accord
ing to his story he is the only lineal
descendant of the Montezumas and says
the killing of a rival for the hand of a
Mexican maiden resulted In a price be
ing placed on his head in Mexico. He
seems to be * possessed of plenty of
ready cash and indignantly denies the
stories published in the East that he
Is a faker and that he was in trouble
there over the issuance of a bad check.

wife have come to California to spend
the winter.

It was claimed that Thornton, who Is
a fiery Southerner, ueed that means to
satisfy his outraged dignity. But the
jury concluded after many ballots to
acquit the aged defendant on the
ground that the evidence was not con
clusive enough to prove guilt.

an expressman, was driving by Colonel
Thornton's office and was struck in
the back with a rifle bullet. A hole had
been cut in the fence along Thornton's

Dev?n went to a hardware store on
Third avenue, where he bought a piece
of rubber hose, into which he placed a
bit of lead pipe, and said to Nelson,
"Now we are ready for the Job."
At the last minute, when everything
had been made ready for the assault
upon Lewis, Nelson weakened and re
vealed the plot to the police.
During the proceedings there lay on
the desk of Assistant District Attorney
Nott a piece of lead pipe and two bot
tles, one containing chloral hydrate
and the other chloroform, which the
witness said were to have been brought
into requisition should they be needed.
Nelson said he had been employed as
a private detective and had met De
van, who was working In the same ca
pacity. He said that on October 2S
Devan had asked him to aid In the
robbery of Lewis, whose habit of re
maining in his office late at night had
been revealed to him by a girl whom
he met through a flirtation. Devan
showed bottles of drugs to the witness
and said:
â¢'If this job on Lewis goes through I
have several others mapped out, and it
will not always be necessary to use the
pipe, as we can use the drugs Just as
well."
NEW YORK. Nov. 19. â An astound
ing story of depravity and criminality
was revealed before Recorder Goff this
morning when Prosecuting "Witness
Oliver Nelson told of Edgar Devan's
plot to murder Samuel Lewis, the
wealthy manufacturer.
All that Devan expected co reap as
the reward of his crime was about $50
which it was hoped Lewis would have
in his pockets, his ring, which was
valued at about $150, and a diamond
pin worth $100. But, according to Nel
son, there were other affairs of the
same nature which Devan had in mind,
among them the assault and robbery
of an official of the Standard Oil Com
pany. Moreover, he told of previous
exploits of the same kind in which he
had taken a prominent part.

dried fruit, and besides it wcuid not be

The committee decided to write to
Filcher that there must be some im

ment of space and no dictation as to
what is to be put in it or not one cent
of the county appropriation of $7000

Great is academic consistency.
A few months ago, in a great univer-
Bity not more than a thousand miles
from Berkeley, several students were
tried by a faculty committee on a charge
of aiding and abetting a serious infrac
tion of the college rules. In the case of
one of the students It sought to prove
that he was intoxicated. A particular
member of the committee, a faculty man
of prominence, urged this point especial
ly against the unlucky student on trial.
The student was convicted and was told
that he had behavedilike a rowdy.
Within the last week the particular
student who was convicted of drunken
ness happened to be riding on a street
car in the university town. On the car
he saw his accuser of the faculty com
mittee. The learned scholar was behav
ing In a peculiar manner. He seemed to
have been stricken with paralysis, a pa
ralysis that had especially attacked his
legs and his tongue. At a curve kind
strangers caught the professor and kept
him from being thrown oft* Into the mud.
Besides the student who had been con
victed of ungentlemanly behavior there
were ten people on the car who knew the
professor well. Many more saw him on
the boat and on the train. , ,
Under the caption "Academic Con
sistency" Richard O'Connor, editor of

talk of the campus, and the general
opinion is that the scandal will result
In the dismissal of somebody from the
university, though Editor O'Connor

ALAMEDA, Nov. 19.â Damages in
the sum of $150 are demanded, by Mary
Holden from Franz Wlschnewiski for
being "hosed down with cold water."
She allowed the hose wielder to play a
stream on her on his guarantee that
the frigid water treatment would cure
her of an ailment with which she was
afflicted. Since Wischnewiski per
formed the operation the woman as
serts that she has felt worse than she
did before, and to-day began an action
against the water-cure man In the
City Justice's Court to recover the
amount sued for, alleging that she has
beÂ»;n injured physically and mentally
to that extent. -Vv *;
In her complaint the woman avers
that she was employed by Wischnew
iski. and that when she became ill he
represented to her that he was a regu
lar medical practitioner and prescribed
for her a shower. bath with a garden
hoso. She submitted to the treatment
aud finding that the water cure did not
end her trouble, but on the contrary
increased its severity, dispensed with
the hose-wielder's services. It Is also
alleged by the plaintiff that Wichnew
iski "was never a qualified medical
practitioner, but practiced fraudu
lently upon her for the purpose of de
ceiving and injuring her."
When the detectives visited the Ban
nan residence they met the same state
of affairs. The Bannans had been at
dinner when their unwelcome and un
bidden caller made his hasty entrance
and exit by climbing into the house by
way of the front porch and a bedroom
window. Without disturbing a soul In
the house the thief speedily made the
rounds of the sleeping apartments,
gathering in -all of the jewelry he could
find and using the same methods as
were employed at the Crellin residence.
The value placed by the police upon the
list of stolen gems reported by Bannan
is $500.
Police Investigation caused the detec
tives to accept the theory that the
same man was guilty of both thefts. It
is conceded at police headquarters that
the thief or thieves are bright and par
ticular stars, and the detectives fear
that the cases will be extremely diffi
cult to handle In view of the character
of the operations.
After supper Mrs. Crellin went up
stairs, only to discover tc her dismay
the loss that had been sustained. After
an inventory of the missing jewelry the
police gave out the statement that
more than $1000 worth of gems had
been stolen, and not a trace of the
thief's identity in sight.
DISCOVERS HEB LOSS.
Apparently satisfied with his even
ing's expedition, the busy thief depart
ed by the way he arrived, leaving only
empty jewel boxes littered about the
chambers, muddy footprints on carpets
and window casings and disorder as
evidence of his call.
Reports from the two residences were
sent to police headquarters almost sim
ultaneously, the thefts having been dis
covered about 7:30 o'clock at each
home. Detectives were dispatched to
the Crellin and Bannan homes, but tho
best that could be uncovered from tho
conditions was the very evident fact
that a man or men exceptionally tal
ented in their peculiar line of thievery
had accomplished the crimes. ,
It was between 6:30 and 7: SO o'clock
this evening {hat the Crellin residence
was entered. The family was at din
ner, and all of the house servants were
on the main floor attending to various
domestic duties. The porch-climber
made his way undisturbed to a point
within reach of a bedroom window,
which was quickly opened. HeÂ» first
visited Mrs. Thomas Crellin'9 apart
ments, and evidently was well supplied
with burglar's keys and picklocks, for
he opened chiffonier drawers, escri
toires and Jewel boxes with a- facility
that indicated the use of a first-clasa
kit of tools. Watches, rings, pins and
anything else that caught the burglar's
discriminating eyes vanished. Then
Miss Mona â¢ Crellin's boudoir was> vis
ited, and an equally complete clean-up
occurred there.

1118 Broadway. Nov. 19.
Daring porch-climbers invaded tha

work were the family of Thomas Crel

erations were identical in method and
equally successful, as not a vestige of
valuables remained in the apartments
visited after the bold and nimble
thieves completed the jobs.
The families were dining downstairs
while the catlike climbers went up tha
convenient porch-covering stanchions,
entered by windows and deftly and
speedily overhauled the sleeping apart
ments, gathering together everything
that looked like jewelry In their hur
ried but comprehensive search for
plunder.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â The Senate
transacted no business in open session
to-day beyond the receipt of bills and
petitions. After an executive session
the Senate adjourned.
Idle Day for Senators.
It was rumored in Washington to
night that, because of the attacks upon
him, General Wood, would be ordered
home for an investigation.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â The in
quiry of the Senate Committee on Mil
itary Affairs into the opposition to the
confirmation of the nomination of Gen
eral Leonard Wood to be major gen
eral in the army was begun to-day and
the hearing, so far as it has gone, was
behind closed doors. Before closing
the doors there were exchanges of
opinion concerning the propriety of
making the proceedings public. The
point was raised by Senator Quarles
and sustained that as all the business
was executive In character the com
mittee had no right to make it public
without first obtaining an order from
the Senate.
Senator Scott made a plea for open
sessions during the hearing.
"It will all be in the evening papers,
anyhow," he said, "and I think it bet
ter to have an authorized report than
try to hide the proceedings."
In addition to the members of the
committee and the newspaper men.
Senators Teller and Hanna and Major
Estes G. Rathbone were present, the
last named three being prepared to
present objections tp General Wood's
confirmation. It was said that no
charges had yet been filed against the
general, but Senator Proctor, who pre
sided, said that he understood Major
Rathbone would present such charges.
Senator Hanna's protest dealt prin
cipally with his active interest in be
half of Rathbone, when he was under
prosecution for malfeasance in office as
director of posts for Cuba in 1900 and in
subsequent years. He said that Gen
eral Wood's requirement that Rath
bone should give a cash bond of $25,000
in American gold when he was first
arrested was beyond all reason, in view
of the fact that the amount he was
charged with having misappropriated
was only about $4000, and Hanna con
tended that a man who would be so
unjust and so unfair under the circum
stances should not be entrusted with
high command. He also spoke of his
long acquaintance, with Major Rath
bone and reiterated his confidence in
his integrity.
Senator Teller said that he had
known Major Rathbone for many
years, and, from his knowledge of him,
in public and private life, he
i thought the major had been unjustly
treated under the directions of Gener
al Wood. Teller then took up the ques
tion of the promotion of General Wood
and went into details to show that he
had been pressed forward in an "un
precedented manner." He said that
from the time of the beginning of the
Cuban war, when General Wood was a
surgeon with the rank of captain, he
had been lifted over the heads of al
most 500 other officers, of whom half
had seen service in the Civil War.
The committee will continue its ses
sions to-morrow.
Soon after the wagon and the cars
carrying the officers had left Thirty
eighth street two cars came up from
the opposite direction. As they were
crossing Thirty-eighth street the mob
let fly a shower of stones, demolishing
the car windows and causing four pas
sengers on the first car to flee. The
mob then swarmed upon the cars and
had beeun to beat the train crews
when the two cars with the policemen
and the crew of the wrecking wagon
came hurrying back.
The mob, which had greatly increased
by this time, was in an angry mood
and refused to move. The police drew
their revolvers and clubs and charged.
The mob used stones and curses, while
the police swung their clubs with vigor.
There was a warm fight, which lasted
about two minutes, and then the mob
broke and Jjled In all directions. A
number of those engaged in the rioting
were arrested.
The demand for a sympathetic strike
to aid the former employes of the Chi
cago City Railway Company was re
fused to-night at a meeting of the
members of the union employes on all
the lines running through the north
section of the city. Instead of taking
such summary action, the north side
men decided to give their striking
brethren financial aid, and to this end
$10,000 was voted to the strikers.
CHICAGO, Nov. 19.â Despite the
united efforts to-day of Mayor Harri
son and the Aldermanic mediation com
mittee to bring about a peaceable ad
justment of the Chicago City Railway
strike, there is little change In the sit
uation to-night. After an all day ses
sion of the board of directors of the
company, at which the proposal sub
mitted by the strikers to Mayor Har
rison stating the terms on which they
would settle was considered, a counter
proposal was prepared by the officers
of the railway company and sent to
the Mayor to-night. As soon as the
document was received at the City Hall
the executive committee of the strik
ers' union was sent for, but as only
half the members of the committee put
in an appearance no action can be
taken on the answer of the company
until to-morrow.
Mayor Harrison said that some slight
modifications had been made by the
company's officers in their original an
swer to the demands of the men. What
these modifications were the Mayor de
clined to say.
A serious riot occurred to-nieht at
Thirty-eighth street and Wentworth
avenue. The trouble began when a
wrecking wagon manned by a non
union crew and guarded by six special
policemen passed Thirty-seventh street
and Wentworth avenue. A crowd
quickly gathered and followed It. When
Thirty-eighth street was reached 200
men were around the wagon, which
they threatened to destroy and then
offered violence to the men. Just In
the nick of time two cars carrying
eighteen policemen came up. The
crowd drew back and allowed the wag
on to pass.
A proposition to amalgamate the
Western Federation of Miners with the
American Federation of Labor was
sent to the executive council, with the
understanding that a committee should
be appointed to bring about if possible
the affiliation.
BOSTON, Nov. 19.â The American
Federation of Labor to-day disposed
summarily of the "open shop" issue as
raised in the case of William A. Miller,
now employed in the Government
Printing Office at Washington, and the
Miller case Itself, by unanimously de
claring in favor of the union shop in
Government as well as in private en
terprises, and by petitioning President
Roosevelt to re-examine the evidence
offered against Miller, and if verified to
remove Miller. Although the resolution
adopted presented the federation's view
on both the "open shop" and the Miller
case, the issues are kept entirely dis
tinct. The re-examinatlon of the Miller
case is not requested because Miller is
not a unionist, a circumstance formerly
urged as a reason for his removal, but
because, the federation > believes Miller
"is totally unfit to be in charge of
working people."
When the convention reassembled to
day a hundred or more resolutions had
yet to be acted upon. The schedule of
the proceedings provides for the elec
tion of officers to-morrow.
The first business was the acceptance
of an unfavorable report on the resolu
tion that labor unionists be obligated
to use only union label goods.
â¢ A resolution favoring the election by
direct vote of the people of the Presi
dent, Vice President, members of the
Cabinet and the United States Sen
ators, Supreme Court Justices and At
torneys General of the several States
of the Union was adopted.
The committee offered a substitute
for a resolution presented by Delegate
Furuseth of San Francisco that the
convention protests against the build
ing of an isthmian canal as leading in
evitably to interference with the sover
eignty of sister republics and to the an
nexation of all the territory between
Mexico and the proposed canal. The
substitute favored the construction of
the proposed canal, but suggested that
as there are hundreds of thousands of
Southern, European and Italian labor
ers who are citizens of the United
States, none but citizens should be em
ployed In the construction of the canal.
This matter was laid upon the table.
The convention hext unanimously
adopted resolutions that the Chinese
exclusion act be made to apply to the
Japanese and Koreans and other
Asiatic Mongolian labor in the Philip
pine and Hawaiian Islands, and that
the Chinese exclusion act continue In
full force in these islands. '
The Panama canal question was
taken from the table and discussed at
some length. Delegate Lennon, treas
urer of the federation, opposed ' the
building of the canal, declaring that it
looked very much to him as if the"
President of the United States had en
gineered the Panama revolution to put
through a great scheme In. the inter
ests of some of the great financiers of
the world. When the question was put
to a vote the substitute of the commit
tee favoring the canal was carried. 99
to 47.
She was at once taken in charge by
Superintendent Smith, who hastily
! summoned Drs. Vogt and Reinle, and
; after administering the first remedy in
; such cases they had her taken to the
j hospital. In her pocket was a letter
! addressed to Chief of Police Wittman
of this city, which said:

dead in the front parlor. Good-by.
"MRS. J. LINSKEY."
Mrs. Linskey's husband was a po
liceman In the San Francisco depart
ment and died about twelve years ago.
She has one son, Joseph, about 25 years
of ace, who is in the employ of the
telephone company and with whom
she has made her home.
Young Linskey. who went to Oak
land as soon as he was notified of his
mother's attempt to end her life, said:
"I do not know what could have made
my mother do such a thing. She has
not been very well lately and through
her absence from the company's office
lost her position. She has brooded over
this, and I suppose became despondent
and tired and thought she would end
It all. Her elster was buried In St.
Mary's Cemetery, and I suppose that is
why she went there."
Mrs. Linskey made her appearance
at Mountain View Cemetery about 10:30
o'clock yesterday morning, wandered
about for some time and then went
through the gate leading Into * St.
Mary's Catholic Cemetery, which ad-
Joins on the west. The day and the
storm and her general appear
ance caused her to be noticed
and an hour or so later one
of the attendants found her retching
on a crave and unconscious. While
carrying her to the lodge of the ceme
tery a phial dropped out of her dress
bearing the label of the Red Cross drug
store in this city and marked "Lysol,
poison."
Tired of battling longer with the
world and despondent over the loss of
her position as matron in the telephone
office in this city. Mrs. J. Linskey of
1214 Larkin street crossed the bay yes
terday and, going to the grave of her
sister in St. Mary's Cemetery, Oakland,
attempted suicide by taking the con
tents of a four-ounce bottle of lysol.
She was found in an unconscious con
dition and taken to the Receiving Hos
pital in Oakland, where she now lies,
hovering between life and death. Stew
ard Borchert thinks that she will re
cover.
The evidence is all circumstantial.
The defense claims that Drayeur struck
his head against some furniture In hla
rcom, inflicting the wound on his fore
head, and causing the hemorrhage of
the brain from which he died.
SAXTA ROSA, Nov. 19.-Mrs. Sophie
Drayeur was placed on trial to-day be
fore Judge William P. Lawlor of San
Francisco on a charge of having mur
dered her husband. The crime is al
leged to have taken place at Healds
burg about August 9, the corpse of
Drayeur having been round on that
day. The deceased was a well known
resident of Healdsburg. where he lived
on Center street. He had been on a
debauch prior to his death. His wife
declares that she is Innocent.
The selection of the Jury occupied
most of the day, and only two wit
nesses were examined. These were
City Marshal Parker and Dr. J. Walter
Seawell. The latter conducted a post
mortem examination. v finding many
contusions and abrasions, a lacerated
wound across the forehead nearly
three Inches in length and a slight
fracture of the skull at the base of
the brain. A hemorrhage of the brain
had be*en the immediate cause of death,
resulting from the force of the blow
on the forehead.

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG
Prevents Many People From Trying
a Good Medicine.
Stomach troubles art- so common and
in most cases so obstinate to cure that
people are & D t to lnck with suspicion
on any remedy claiming to be a radical
permanent cure for dyspepsia and indi-
gestion. Many such pride themselves
on their acuteness in never being hum-
bugged, especially in medicines.
This fear of being humbu-ged can be
carried too far. so far, in fact, that
many people suffer for years with weak
digestion rather than risk a little time
and money In faithfully testing the
claims made of a preparation so relia-
ble and universally used as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important re-
spect from ordinary proprietary medi-
cines for the reason that they are not
a secret patent medicine: no secret is
made of their Ingredients, but analysis
sbows thrm to contain the natural di-
fcestive ferments, pure aseptic, pepsin
the digestive acida, Golden Seal, btel
muth, hydrastis and nux. They are not
cathartic, neither do they act power-
fully on any organ, but they cure indi-
gestion on the common sense plan of
digesting the food eaten thoroughly be-
fore It has time to ferment, sour and
cause the mischief. This Is the only
secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure Indigestion and stomach
troubles because they act entirely on
the bowels, whereas the whole trouble
Is really in the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken
after meals digest the food. That is all
there is to it Food nut digested or half
digested Is poison, as It creates gas,
acidity, headaches, palpitation of the
heart, loss of flesh and appetite and
many other troubles which are ofttn
called by seme other name.
They are sold by druggists every-
where at 50 cents per package.

"It is a fact." he said, "that the
wages of the American workingmen
are the. highest in the world, and I
would like to see them higher; but I

Rabbi Voorsanger epoKe with the
earnestness that convinces an impartial
auditory. While disclaiming a deep
knowledge of. political economy, some
of his sentiments were littered with an
eloquence that bespoke more than ordi
nary study of the question under dis
cussion. He said;
-'I have never had any occasion to dis
cuss publicly the important problems
that seem to interest you to-night, but
that does hot mean that I have not paid
some attention to them. I believe that
the subject difecussed to-night Is the
most important one that can engage the
attention of the citizens of these United
States. I believe there is nothing: more
important. I believe that the peace of
the commonwealth depends upon the suc
cessful solution of the problem. 'I am
here not to speak in favor of this or
thatâ not to oppose one side or favor the
other. I am simply here as a citizen to
Join with all others who believe that the
main thing in. a. community, is not the
success of labor or the victory of capital,
but the peace of the community.
The speaker recalled when the first
trades union was established in his na
tive city, Amsterdam, thirty-five years
ago. He said his father was a labor
ing man and a member of the union.
He told ; how the union . succeeded in
quadrupling the wages, and that in
two years it raised the . schedule of
wages four times. The fifth time, he
said; the Beers Diamond . Syndicate of
Africa closed down and 10.0C0 diamond
polishers were reduced \o beggary.

had it in their own hands and the em
ployers could not do anything. So, in
Chicago during the hot days the deaths
of infants increased from 125 to 175 in
the thousand. And whose babies' were
dying? Not the capitalists; not the em
ployers on a large scale â they were not
suffering, because they were at cool wa
tering places, in shady nooks in the
country. No. friends, the babies that
were dying -were children of the work
ingmen. The Milkmen's Union had
stabbed to the hearts the interests jat
their dearest friends. Now, if there had
been a commission of the kind we are
discussing, and it had been called upon,
the matter would have been sifted to the
bottom and these things would not have
happened. ...
. At the . conclusion of Archbishop
Montgomery's a'ddress the Rev. Dr.
Adams was introduced. .-He assured his
auditors ; , that l\e: was a laboring man,

I don't believe in, compulsory arbitra
tion; I am told by attorneys that com
puls6ry arbitration could'nevcr work be
cause it is contrary to our, constitution.
I am not a constitutional lawyer, but 1
am just' such? a lover of this country as
to .say. that ;we do not. have ; to" resort to
a violation- /of the constitution to bring
about. ; a' settlement of our troubles by

Affchblshop 'Montgomery paid a high
tribute to the board of arbitration ap
pointed by President .Roosevelt. -He
read /a portion of. the report of the
board in the settlement of the coal
strike, and said if the newspapers of
the country .would . print a portion . of
it, at the top of their columns the year
round strikes would never occur. r . -
I came here to-night to speak on one
point. I am not here to discuss the dif
ference between capital and labor. I
was invited to speak in behalf of indus
trial peace, to be brought about through
arbitration. It is to this thought I directed
what little time I have had. I feel that
arbitration is advisory. It may not be
the principle that will finally and ulti
mately settle tho relations between labor
and capital, but is the best that is seen
at the present time, and, consequently. It
is advisable, and I believe in every- in
stance it is humane and patriotic to ad
vise people to arbitrate their differences.
The three parties to a strike are em
ployers, employes and the public. The
employer and the employe must remem
ber that this third partyâ the public at
large, whether It be great or small, State
or nationâ that third party pays every
cent that goes Into the finances of em
ployer and- employe/ Take this city for
an example. Here we have a system of
railroads which are owned by one com
pany, employing two or three thousand
men. The, public pays for the operation
of these roads and has given franchises
on condition that the public shall receive
uninterrupted service.
..WITHIN THE LAW.
When the chairman Introduced Arch
bishop Montgomery the distinguished
prelate was greeted with a hearty
round of handclaps. He said:
ARCHBISHOP MONTGOMERY.
The speaker then showed conclusive
ly that strikes are bad for all parties
concerned. He showed that by arbitra
tion strikes can be avoided, and proved
that Carpenters' Union No. 131 in Seat
tle had gained many concessions with
out going out on strike. He argued
that the contending parties should not
hide themselves behind closed doors,
but come out into the open and argue
their differences upon a common plat
form.

In an opinion rendered yesterday the
Attorney General states that while there
seems to be a lack of any express direc
tion as to the purposes for which the
library fund may be expended, yet the
statutory powers and duties of the
board of trustees and of the librarian
may be looked to In order to ascertain
the purposes for which the fund may
be disbursed, and the conclusion - la
reached that such powers and duties can
not be so construed as to authorize the
board to lawfully expend the moneys of
the State Library fund for the purposes
set forth.
Mr. J. L. Gillls. state librarian. In a
communication to Attorney Gereral U. S
Webb, states that the board of trustees
of the State Library contemplate the con
struction of an additional room in the
Capitol at Sacramento to accommodate
the growth of the library, and that they
also contemplate laying cork carpet and
hardwood floors, putting in a revolving
door, an elevator, and installing a heating
system and an electric light system, at
an aggregate coÂ« of $10,000. and the trus
tees ask the Attorney General if they
have the authority to expend the moneys

poses. --- .c-<

PERSONAL' HENTION.
Dr. T. It. Helntz of Redding is at the
Lick.
I want to show you that . unions arÂ©
good for the honest employer and the
honest business man. Â» They destroy cut
throat competition. - Unfortunately, 1 ,. we
have a class, qf employers who put in
estimates for work to be done at such
low figures that they have nothing to de
pend upon for a profit bu the. amount or
money they can filch. from labor, and/ as
a consequence, . they hire men at reduced
rates. In any country where the wages
are low you will find that it Is the worst
place for capitalists to invest: their
money. It stands to reason that where
wages are high the worklngmen rise - to
a higher standard and it puts more
money -Into, circulation. â¢ t Â¦Â¦ . .: â¢.-..)
I am a â¢ believer * in high wages. I am
for ; thÂ« ' lifting: up â¢ of the masses, ' but ?i
am not a believer In advancing Â» one
branch of -Â¦ Industry at the expense ' of
another. I want to say here that my xneas-
Tq inculcate a feeling of mutual're
spect between the employers and the
employed was the common effort of the
three clergymen. They were given or
derly hearing by the folks who were
apparently there to create disorder, and
by the men and women who were seek
ing enlightenment solely their most
telling points were warmly applauded.
Byron Mauzy presided and- introduced
Mr. Scullin, who Baid: .
A PLAIN TALK.
But the people who were there to
hear the advertised speakers â and most
of those people showed their disap
proval of the interruption by leaving
the theater when the turbulence began
Â¦^Â¦received ample reward for their at
tendance. They applauded ' Mr?"Scul
lin's manly avowal'of his unprejudiced
attitude and his declaration' that he
was not a champion of compulsory ar
bitration, but favored the establishment
in this city of a board of investigation,
which should probe : the question at
Issue and' discover just what conces
sions could be made by each disputant;
so that 'the publicâ the third party af-.
f ected by every strike^coiild determine
where its sympathy'and support should
go. ; .
It was Mr. Scullin's purpose to ex
plain his- proposed system of arbitra
tion, but he was prevented doing so by
the unruly conduct of a number of So
cialists, who insisted on having one
of their own speakers take the platform
and in other ways displayed such an
obstructive spirit that the chairman,
to maintain the principle of peace, that
the meeting was called to promote, or
dered an adjournment. Another meet
ing will be called, and it !s needless
to say that measures will be taken to
prevent a repetition of the disturbance
that marred the proceedings last night.
Arbitration of Industrial disputes was
eloquently and exhaustively advocated
last evening at the Alhambra Theater,
among the speakers being such prom
inent humanitarians and students of
sociology as Archbishop Montgomery,
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger and the Rev.
Dr. George C. Adams. The audience
was small, but that fact did not deter
the orators from talking as fervently
as If the house had been crowded. The
spirit that possessed the speakers. was
fairly expressed by Archibshop Mont
gomery when, after thanking those who
had braved the storm to be there, he
said that' their attendance was evi
dence of their interest in the question
unfter discussion, and he' would rather
talk to an earnest dozen than a listless
thousand. â¢
; The meeting had been called by.? a
committee^of local lovers of peace, con
sisting of Fairfax H. Whelan, Judge S.
C. Denson", Byron Mauzy.'and R. B.
Hale, to enable P. H. Scullin of Seattle
to explain a measure which he had
built of the best features * of the

by as many States of the Union! Mr.

â¢ The- Painters' Union: has decided to
ask the various employers of painters
throughout the city for. an increase of
wages on March 1, 1904. The painters
at the present time receive $3 50 for an
eight-hour day, but they. will demand
$4 on and after March 1.
. It was' voted to wait until March in
order to give the various contractors a
chance. to. complete the .work they have
on. hand. The painters have five differ
ent local organizations, and are reputed
to be among the Strongest of the city's
labor organizations.
The motive for the deed, whether sui
cide or murder, is not known, but will
rflrobably be disclosed at the Coroner's
Investigation: Friends of Saunders dis
credit the suicide theory, for the reason
that the deceased was never known to
carry a firearm and also because either
of the two wounds would have, proved
fatal.

OREGON CITY, NovV 19.â I* B.
Saiinders, a local hoy buyer, was found
dead on the street at Buttevllle about
7 o'clock' this morning with two bullet
holes In his breast, 'a' re velvet, was
f outod about two feet of the body, which
was lying on the sidewalk in front of
the residence ofR. V. Pafrott: . "
Saunders was the local' agent at
Buttevllle for Lilienthal & Co., well
known hop merchants of New York,
and had spent the evening playing
cards. ' lie started home late in the
morning. " A number of perrons heard
pistol shots In the early morning hours.
At the prison Mrs. M. Condon, ma
tron, took charge of the women and
children, fed them and provided ac
commodations for them. They said
they had 'comb to this city from Peo
ria, 111., a little more than four weeks
ago. At the time of their departure
they had $450/ Upon arriving in this
city less than half of the amount had
been spent. Hall says he took apart
ments with Mrs. Jane Grant at 415
Hayes street and paid $2(T rent for two
rooms. Before the month was up the
landlady made complaint about the
children, also about the use of flour
and wood by her tenants, and on
Tuesday they left. There was $5 due
Mrs. Grant, and Hall says he sold the
woman a pair of blankets for 51 50 and
that $3 50 is still due her. His trunks,
he says, were held as security. Tues
day and Wednesday nights were spent
In some lodging-house, the location of
which Hall says he does not remem
ber. He claims to have spent the last
of his money about one week ago and
says he was obliged to pawn his wife's
coat, a razor and a ring to secuVe suf
ficient money to pay for the lodgings
for the two nights. Hall, who is but
22 years of age, says that he has striv
en faithfully to secure employment
since he arrived here, but has been un
able to do so. As an explanation for
the disappearance of the money he
claims to have had when he left Il
linois, he says that it was spent for
the purchase of food and clothing.
Mrs. Grant says that Hall, his wife
and two-year-old son, Mrs. Severens,
her child and a man who purported to
be.. her husband came to the house
three weeks ago and engaged two
rooms. She says they were objection
able .tenants, continually drinking and
quarreling, and that after one of the
quarrels Mrs. Severens' husband left
and since has been working in a can
nery. On one occasion he, returned and
another fight ensued. When the party
gave up the apartments, she said, the
rooms were strewn with .beer and
whisky bottles. She says she did not
put the, people out and that they can
have their trunks when they call for
them. All claim to have relatives in

After spending nearly $500 in four
weeks. Earl Clarence Hall, his wife and
baby and Mrs. Bertha Severens and
her -four-year-old daughter sought
shelter from the rain under the trees
of Jefferson square last night. The
man, women and x children were found
by a passing policeman and' taken to
the city" prison, where they told, a tale
of penury- and hunger.
The trial was commenced about a
week ago and the evidence introduced
was of a positive nature and there
were no extenuating circumstances in
the defendant's favor. District Attor
ney Byington, who conducted the pros
ecution, was much disappointed with
the verdict and says he cannot under
stand on what ground the leniency
was. shown, except that it be out of
sympathy for Nihlll's mother and sis
ters, ..who. remained with him In the
courtroom while the case was belng^
heard. He will be sentenced next Sat
urday.. ''â¢ ... ... Â¦'.'-:
The crime for which Nlhlll is to
spend the remainder of his days behind
prison avails was a heartless one. On
April 21 of the present year he shot his
girl victim down in a grocery at tha
corner of Russ and Howard streets,
because she would not forsake her
home and return with him to a life of
evil. Nihill and his victim had lived
together some time before the affair.
Finally the woman concluded to walk
the straight and narrow path, married
and settled down. One child was born
to her and life with her husband was
one of contentment. On the day of
the murder she met Nihill and Jie
pleaded with her to abandon her child
and husband and go with him.
Mrs. Baker refused and requested
Nihill to leave her in peace. Instead,
Nihill followed the woman to a gro
cery, turned a revolver upon her and
killed her almost instantly. He then
placed the weapon against his own
head, but the bullet did little harm and
he came out of the hospital in a short
time.
The names of the Jurymen who ren
dered the verdict are: James O'Con
nor, foreman; James "Walsh. M. J.
Vaughn, Thomas E. Alaher, J. B. Fitch,
Hugo Judge, Peter N. Butt, AL Lind
heimer, N. D. Cohn, Peter A. Finnegan,
John L. McKinnon and Charles A.
Gawthorne.
"If this man Is guilty of murder In
the first degree," said the court, after
the jury had been polled, "he certainly
deserves to suffer death. If this la not
a case where the death penalty should
be Inflicted, then the statute providing
for such should be repealed.." The
Judge, making no effort to conceal his
displeasure, hastily adjourned court
and left the bench.
The jury In the case of Michael Ni
hill, charged with the murder of Bene
frida Baker on April 21, brought In a
verdict of murder in the first degree
last night and fixed the penalty at life
Imprisonment. Judge Carroll Cook, in
whose court the trial was held, was an
noyed at the verdict and expressed
himself that Nihill should be hanged
for the cold-blooded crime.

PARIS. Nov. 19.â Louis Ferrer, a
prominent Colombian, and a relative of
President Marroquin, has come out
strongly" in favor of Panama. He said,
in the course of an interview to-day,
that it was most desirable that the
departments of Cauca and Antioquia
be incorporated in the new republic,
owing to their long and loyal support
of the canal project agrainpt the oppo
sition of the other departments. Since
Panama was independent it was logical
that Cauca and Antioquia should share
in the benefits of its independence, as
otherwise their position wxmld be un
tenable, since their constant support of
the canal has estranged them from
Colombia. Senor Ferrer urges the con
solidation of Panama, Cauca and An
tioquia into one republic.
Senor Ferrer's two uncles represented
Cauca and Antioquia, respectively, in
the Colombian Senate and lost their
positions owing to their support of the
canal.
PANAMA. Nov. 19.â The Government
ef Panama will not consider any pro
posal from the Colombian departments
of Cauca and Antioquia to Join the
Panama republic. The reasons for such
refusals are clear. Panama would gain
nothing, but. on the contrary, might
become Involved in a troublesome if
not a dangerous war, as Colombia
could attack Cauca and Antioquia by
land.
Louis Ferrer Says Cauca and Antio
quia Should Be Taken In.

The republic of Panama 'agrees to se

and rights that are required in the

Other important provisions of the
convention are:
by several of the great powers. ,The
Minister especially begged the Papal
secretary to present his respectful salu-.
tation to Pope Pius X and expressed
the wish that the Vatican should recog

Article V. The republic of Panama

. The Panama Government, however. Is
allowed under this article to establish
at these ports such custom-houses and
guards as may be deemed necessary to
collect duties on importations designed
for other parts of the republic To the
United States Is given the right to make
use of the ports at the two extremities
cf the canal as places of anchorage in
order to make repairs, for loading, un
loading, depositing or transhipping
cargoes which are in transit or destined

INDEMNITIES TO LAND OWNERS.
Article VI further provides that all
damages caused to private land own

of the canal shall be appraised and de
termined by a Joint commission ap
pointed by the Governments of the

Article III. The republic of Panama
grants to the United States the right
to exercise the same power and au
thority over such lands "as if it were
sovereign" and to the exclusion of such
power by Panama.
Article II. The republic of Panama
cedes to the United States live miles
on each side of the canal and three ma

any other lands necessary to the con
struction or maintenance of the canal
and its auxiliaries.
Article I. The United States guaran

the republic of Panama.
PANAMA'S LIBERAL TERMS.
The first five articles of the Hay-
Bunau-Varilla treaty are to this ef
fect:
From various sources additional in
formation in regard to the terms and
provisions of the treaty has been ob
tained. Under the treaty the United
States guarantees and agrees to main
tain the independence of Panama. It
is said that this clause was inserted
in order to set at rest all questions as
to the recognition of Panama as an in
dependent nation by other govern
ments. The United States undertakes
to construct modern systems of sew
ers and water works for the cities of
Panama and Colon and has the right to
collect tolls for the period of fifty
years in order to repay the cost of con
struction, with interest. At the end of
fifty years the eewers and water works
become the property of Panama and
Colon.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 19.â The Pan
a.T.a commissioners, Dr. Amador and
Frederico Boyd, to-day consulted with
Minister Bunau-Varilla^md Frank D.
Pavcy Â°* New York, legal adviser to
the legation. It Is said that they read
over the treaty signed yesterday by
Hay and Bunau-Varllla end discussed
its terms and provisions In detail. It
met their hearty approval. The treaty
will be sent to Panama at once for
ratification.
The Commissioners sent a telegram
to the Junta in Panama asking for a
conference to-morrow, but the Panama
Government declined to grant the re
quest. It is expected, however, that a
representative delegation from Panama
will arrive to-morrow to confer with
the Commissioners on board the Can
ada.
COLON, Nov. 19.â Generals Reyes,
Holguin and Ospina, thÂ© Colombian
Peace Commissioners, arrived here at
5 o'clock this afternoon on board the
French steamship Canada. Orders
were issued by Admiral Coghlan that
the Commissioners were not to be al
lowed to come ashore. They were In
vited, however, to make their quarters
on board the gunboat Dixie, but they
refused to do so. _
American marines are guarding the
Canada and Panama troops are guard
ing the wharf at which she lies.
Representatives appointed by the
Government of Panama will* visit the
Colombian Commissioners to-morrow.
There is hardly a probability that any
sort of agreemnt will be reached. *So
far 'as can be learned the commission
has no credentials from the Bogota
Government, and if this is the case
the Commissioners probably will return
on the steamship which brought them.
There was great excitement on the
arrival of the Canada. Hundreds of
persons flocked to the neighborhood of
the wharf, but were prevented reach
ing the vessel by the marines.
-Captain Merriam of the UnlteAStates
auxiliary cruiser Dixie immediately
went aboard the Canada and invited
General Reyes and the other members
of the commission to come aboard the
Dixie, but the General and his com
panions declined the invitation. Ad
miral Coghlan, who had just arrived
from Panama, extended an invitation
to the Commissioners to board the,
Mayflower, but the Admiral's invita
tion also was declined.

W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â Despite
the opposition of the white citizens of
Florence, S." C, President Roosevelt has
decided to reappolnt Rev. Joshua E.
Wilson, a negro, postmaster at that
place. The cry of negro domination
has been raised by the white inhabi

Ing that a white man be named for the
postmastershlp when Wllsorrs term ex

examined into the situation and has de
cided to stand by the present post
master.
Wilson was appointed by President
McKlnley four years ago and has made
a good record, so the â¢ officers of the
Postofflce Department say. He Is pre

BERLIN, Nov. 19. â The Foreign Office here has express
ed entire satisfaction with the rapid progress of Panama
affairs and will congratulate the United States the day
when the first ship crosses the Isthmus, which, the officials say,
cannot come too soon. The German consular authorities im
mediately entered into relations with the de facto Government
of Panama when business required it, without waiting for in
structions from Berlin, and there is every prospect that the Ger
rran Government will recognize Panama formally and without
delay when the request is presented. The German press con
tinues to print the isthmian news prominently and the press ut
terances are singularly free from jealousy of the United States
or critical references to its attitude.

A GREATER OAKLAND.
OAKLAND'S movement for consolidation with Ala
meda and Berkeley is interesting from many points
of view. The trend of municipal development in
Great Britain and in our Eastern States has been toward the
consolidation of small communities so as to form a larger
unit of administrative government and at the same time
obtain a higher prestige as a metropolis. For some Teason
California municipalities have not hitherto been affected by
that trend of development and the Oakland movement there
fore will be watched by all students of municipal problems
to see whether it reveals any new impulse among the people
in that respect.
The movement in Great Britain and in the East was in
spired largely by economic considerations and by a desire
on the part of the public to have a more effective local gov
ernment than could possibly be attained by a small com
munity or by a considerable community divided into sev
eral small independent towns or villages. By reason of the
movement we have seen in recent years the extraordinary
development of such large cities as Greater Chicago, Greater
New York and Greater London, while a similar expansion
on a less scale has been carried out among hundreds of
communities of lesser note, both in this country and in
Great Britain. In no case, so far as we know, has there
been any dissatisfaction with the results of consolidation. It
is, therefore, the more surprising that the centralizing move
ment has as yet had little or no success in California.
The cities and towns along the eastern shore of, the bay
are in a good position to start the municipal expansion
movement for the State. It is evidently only a question of
time when they must form a single self-governing commu
nity, and it would seem they have now reached a stage of
development where the union might be made to the benefit of
all. Of course, there are local questions which will affect
the minds of citizens of Berkeley and Alameda and incline
them to maintain their present independence and isolation
but it is probable that every consideration of economy, and
efficiency of -government will be on the side of consolida
tion. . '
.Whatever, view, be taken by Alameda and Berkeley, it is
Here is another 6lde step: As your
opponent leads bring your right foot
around to the right in a semicircle un
til It is on a line with the left. At the
same time pivot on the ball of the left
foot, turning the body to the right.
The moment the right touches ground
throw the weight of. the body on it,
draw back the left and, If necessary,
take a step backward- If your adver
sary rushes he is likely to miss you
altogether or to trip across your left
leg. You will. In any case, be in a posi
tion to land with your right or left
1
! eprlnning the side step, only twenty-
Tour inches to the right of that former
rose. All this, of course, must be done
with lightning rapidity. With a little
practice you can Fide step quickly be
fore your opponent can recover from
his blow or rush. If he has ruehed he
will, of course, have moved his own
position. In any case, turn at once so
as to face him. The side step will have
thus carried you out of his way and
you will be ready to meet his next as
sault or to attack him before he realizes
where you have gone. This side step is
particularly useful when boxing or
fighting against a heavier or stronger
man than yourself.
A second side step Is to advance the
"left foot obliquely to the right (instead
of to one Bide) as your adversary leads
or rushes. Step Just far enough to one
side to avoid his body. Follow up the
left foot with the right, throwing the
weight of the body on the latter, and
pivoting on the ball of the left foot
(when the right has come up to it),
until you face your opponent; then
bracing yourself by falling at once into
the first "on guard" pose.
Be sure not to collide with him in
this move. Judge the distance so that
you will Just- miss his advancing body.
And remember that on speed, correct
balance and accuracy the whole suc
cess of the movement depends. Prac
tice these side steps against an imag
inary opponent when going through
your morning exercise Just after rising.
You will quickly "get the hang" of
them.
A variation of this last mentioned
side step is to step back obliquely to
the right, with the right foot (instead
of obliquely forward with the left),
bringing back the left foot at once to
position. Thus your opponent is likely
to overreach himself in his lead or
rush and lose his balance, leaving him
open to your attack.
for your face with his left. As he does
so throw your left foot about twenty
four inches to the left, letting it come
to the ground at that distance to the
left of the right foot and on a line wih
the latter. Turn the body to the right
at the same time, pivoting on the ball
of the right foot. By the time your left
foot touches ground you should be
standing at right angles to your former
position (see illustration). Your op
ponent's blow has whizzed past you,
or If he rushed he has tumbled across
your right leg. The moment you have
brought yourself to this position at
right angles to your former posture
cither use the left foot as a pivot to
wheel you Into eome new position, far
out of reach of the other man's rush,
or simply bring the right foot to a
position about eighteen inches behind
th<Â» left, wheeling to the left on the, ball
of the left foot at the same time until
;ou stand just as you stood Just before
It is planned to send these portable
rostrums to termini of electric roads,
which not only pass through large
towns and villages, but well settled
rural districts. Arriving at its destina
tion, the "knock-down" trailer will be
put together, hooked on to a trolley
car and taken to the first speaking
point. The portable switch, which Is a
combination of derailing frogs and
wooden, steel topped rails, will be
placed in position, and the platform
moved from the track. to the field. Tho

In some parts of the country half a

the speakers using the traveling plat
form, ending with a big open-air rally
at night. The platform will be covered
with an awnings and will carry a
speaker's desk, chairs and cases of
campaign, literature, and will be large
enough to accommodate a good-sized

This novelty is not the only one
promised for next year. A knock-down
"trailer" for trolley cars Is scheduled
to take a lively part In the political
battle. The shrewd campaign man
agers have grasped the possibilities
which lie in the electric streetcar lines
which operate in the rural districts in
many States. A mechanical genius has
Invented wfiat might b'e called a "port
able rostrum." It is a "knock-down"
or collapsible platform, provided with
light steel wheels of standard gauge,
and so made that it can be rapidly and
easily taken apart for shipment from
place to place by freight.
This platform carries' with it a
portable switch track, by which it can
be switched from the tracks of the trol
ley line Into the field selected for the
barbecue, fish fry or round-up. A
heavily insulated and flexible electric
cable, with a hooked pole, is to be part
of the equipment, designed to take the
current from the tr/)lley line for electric
lights â arc or Incandescentâ if a night
meeting is desired. ' Jointed poles and
insulated wire are to be used for in
stalling the temporary electric light
system.

bows to usâ his audience â and begins
his speech Just as if he were facing
a large hall crowded with yelling par
tisans. He will speak not more than
fifteen minutes and then he bows, steps
down and we're through with him. But
we have him and his speech, and our
apparatus is so nearly perfect that
every man in a fair-sized hall will be
able to hear every word he uttered,
while, at the same time, they all are
looking at his life-sized moving picture,
every motion fitting the corresponding
word and every word the proper mo
tion."
Mechanical "spellbinders" will take
the stump next year. The genial De
pew, the candid Hanna, the magnetic
Bryan and the caustic Tillman will
be seen and heard in hundreds of coun
try sehoolhouses and village halls. The
phonograph and moving picture ma
chine have been induced to work to
gether bo successfully that the clever
men who have "synchronized" the In
animate mimics say they act In per
fect harmony.
The man who has done this said:
"The first machines will be used in
next year's political campaign. The
big' oratorical guns of both parties are
to be 'phono-photoed," and every
crossroad village and little town in
close territory will have their first
chance to see and hear the great po
litical speakers of the day. Certain
spellbinders are always in such de
mend that they cannot be supplied.
Next year hundreds of operators will
be In readiness with machines to fill
all such wants, and the novelty alone
is certain to attract the crowds which

Use the left hand for "long distance"
blows for the face, for blows for the
wind and for parrying. Use the right
only for guarding or countering. Never
lead with it except at close quarters.
In "mix-ups" or when an opponent ven
tures too near you your light is a ter
rible weapon. But at long range a right
lead is liable to throw you off your bal
ance. Moreover, it does not reach bo
far as does the left. Remember all this.

Finer Points of Boxing.
Bogota has shown no title to our consideration in her
quarrels with her provinces, beyond regard for her sover
eignty tempered by watchfulness of our own rights on the
isthmus and by her proved inability to keep the peace by
honest and upright government. Having set pur face to
ward our duty in the premises, there can be no step back
ward. If we owe anything to Bogota we owe something,
also, to the people of the isthmus, who, relieved of their
restraint by a government that has no sympathy with their
aspirations and holds them to it only to despoil them, will
join the world in going forward. They have established a
de facto government, which exercises de facto jurisdiction
over the territory needful to our enterprise of constructing
a waterway between the oceans. The peaceful enjoyment
of that great facility must always depend much upon the
friendship and good feeling of the isthmians. It should be
plain to every American that we would forfeit these and
make additional trouble for ourselves, if we now permitted
them to be subjugated by the savage government from
which they seek to escape.
The Panaman revolution is the first in our time in that
region that has been undertaken for the establishment of
enlightened principles of government, and to put a people
in line with the civil progress of the world. It is just as
much our right to x recognize such a de facto government
and to sympathize with those who have created it as it
would be to do the same for any people who have defied
any other despotism and taken a stand for the rights of man.
1 Of course, the incident furnishes another opportunity for
the enemies of an isthmian canal to fight from ambush.
They did this when we were trying to get a canal by the
Nicaragua route and had to get a new treaty with Great
Britain modifying the Clayton-Bulwer convention. Then
the opposition press, workingjor the enemies of the canal,
daily beset President McKinley and Secretary Hay with
slander and caricature, pretending an exalted patriotism.
They caused the failure of the first Hay-Pauncefote treaty
and held the canal up for three years.
On the Nicaragua route it proved that we had three sov
ereignties to deal with in Great Britain, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica. The situation presented difficulties that were im
mensely multiplied by the hampering abuse of our admin-l
istration by the opposition in this country. Then President
McKinley turned to the less complicated proposition of the
Panama route. The Hay-Herran treaty was made, with
the full knowledge and assent of Marroquin and of every
public man in Colombia. But they all broke, faith and de
feated the treaty. This has caused the independent aspira
tions of Panama, Cauca and Antioquia. If Americans sup
port the purpose of Bogota to reduce those states again to
misgovernment they are supporting reaction and absolutism
and are putting a canal among the improbable things
THE several protests of Colombia are now before the
world. They are issued in forgetfulness of the fact
that more than two months ago Bogota furnished the
United States a casus belli. When the telegrams between
our State Department' and our Minister to Colombia were
intercepted, and their delivery prevented by that Govern
ment, we had the right to withdraw our Minister, cease
intercourse and demand an apology. That we did not do so
was due to a spirit of patience with a willful and semi-civil
ized state.
Under such circumstances it was apparent that Colombia
could not be trusted to observe her international obliga
tions, arising in a canal treaty, and that .our future experi
ences with her would be a continual torment and expense,
not justified by the natural situation. In the independence
of Panama and the desire of Cauca and Antioquia to join
her, there is revealed the internal struggle between progress
and civilization on one side and retrogression and savagery
on the other.
The three states that stand for progress contribute the
most of the public revenues. They want a financial system
that will protect their commerce. They don't want to be
part of a nation where everything is at so low an ebb that
$1200 of its money is equal to only $i of the money of civ
ilization. The three discontented states have an aggregate
population of 1,128,000, or nearly half that of the whole
country. But under Colombian polity their civil governors
and military comandantes are appointed by the Bogota
Government, and they, have but little of that independence
and control of their domestic affairs that are the preroga
tive of our States.
Side stepping, leading and getting out
of reach, and the gauging of distance,
are things that require constant, daily
practice, until they are thoroughly
learned. After that they become in
stinctive and your feet will carry you
in and out at the right time without
conscious effort on your part, just as
the expert dancec goes through waltz
or two-step without counting or taking
heed of each movement.
You will find that this branch of box
ing will do more than anything else to
relieve the foot-awkwardness so fre
quent to boyhood. The rapidly grow
ing boy is prone to find his feet always
in his way and to be sadly deficient In
gracefulness. When he has learned
footwork in boxing he also finds that
he has learned to move about grace
fully in other pursuits.
In our next lesson we will take up
swings, hooks, jolts, etc. They are
pood blows to learn, and are not diffi
cult. They are also the heaviest blows
in all the science of boxing.
Remember always that I shall be
glad to answer any questions you may
care to ask. or to give advice on any
point that puzzles you.
It will take you Borne time to perfect
yourself in the various tactics I have

"The Kaiser lately reviewed a feath

says the Berlin correspondent of an

has a pet magpie, which is full of mili

.There is the Kaiser sitting sternly In

with its martial stride, and there are
the officers of the regiment, with min

on all their faces. Who can be sure
of a magpie's tongue? He might have
turned upon his sovereign with some
expression of private Judgment worthy
of a Socialist editor. Who can doubt
that, after such offense, he would have
been tried by court-martial for lese ma

tattered kid of 13 or 14 years, hardly
promising or prepossessing, but terribly
in earnest, roused the fat old grocer
from his steam beer stupor into repeat
ing In sleepy astonishment, "You're a

;Â¦ "Dat's what I am," returned the lit
tle job-chaser. "I'se got a kid to take

of bravado that fitted illy with the wist

â¢^ HANG CHI TUNG and Yuan Shi Kai, two of the
I higher officials of China, who are at the same time
vÂ«^ among the few progressive advisers of the Emper
or's Government, are reported to be urging the necessity
of an alliance between Japan and China against the aggres
sions of Russia. This they advance as the only logical fruit
age of the recent rapprochement between the two Oriental
empires in the face of the impending depredations of the
Bear. Japan seems not unfavorably disposed toward the
project and only the blind adherence to obsolete ideas on the
part of the ruling councils in' the Flowery Kingdom seems
to stand in the way of the progressive measure. .
Nothing could be more natural than that the two repre
sentative Oriental nations should unite to protect common
race welfare and identical national interests. The trend of
the nations seems to be toward great family pacts. In the
labyrinth of latter day diplomacy Slav draws near to Slav,
Teuton seeks out Teuton, Latin approaches Latin. The col
umns, of peoples which marched out from that dim Aryan
land in the dawn of history are gradually drawing together
again into their separate tribes. Race ties are beginning to
determine twentieth century boundaries.
In the light of this great arraying of blood against blood
Japan cannot expect to profit greatly by any artificial ties
with a nation of the west. Should she draw nearer to Eng
land, for example, the events of a day, a change in the Eng
lish Ministry, a declaration of war against another of the
great powers on the part of either contracting party, might
snap the slender bonds and leave the little isle of the rising
sun without an ally.
True it is that in an alliance with China Japan would be
yoked with a nation which is unwieldy, antiquated, ca
pricious; but China has a potential power, which, if it could
be transformed into energy, would make the armed giants
of Europe seem drawfs in comparison. By a European al
liance Japan would be tied only to the selfish support of a
commercial diplomacy; by a pact between herself and China
she would be master of tremendous possibilities.
Now comes Colonel William Jennings
Bryan as an advocate of work. AH
aspirations for the Presidency being
cast aside the silver-tongued man from
the Platte Is reported to have delivered
himself of the following before a boys*
club in New Haven, Conn.:
"Don't think that happiness consists
In not having to work. If you have
sufficient money that you are not
obliged to work for your living, why,
your field for work Is only made the
larger; you then have others to work
for besides looking out for yourselves.
The most miserable man Is the man
who does not have to work physically.
He Is not only Impairing his physical
health, but he also lacks a. stimulus to
do the best mental work.
"All who have led a life of industry
know how true this Is. They know
that work is a blessing, not a . curse.
They should know that the thing which
curses labor is false ideas, erroneous
thoughts, ehaflng in the harness. A
man can just as easily make play of
work as youth can make work of play
on the gridiron and the diamond. The
busy man enjoys life and Us. emolu
ments, the idle man only gets a loafer's
reward."

AN ORIENTAL ALLIANCE.
An announcement that "the Home
lelgh bloodhounds will meet at Thrux
ton Manor, near Andover, at noon on
Thursday next to hunt a man" has
moved the London Times to admit that
in most countries hunting, now that
't Is done neither for food nor for safe
rj, has become artificial in exact pro
portion as It has become more nearly
to being merely a source of f pleasure.
Even In so "doggy" a country as Eng
land, however, there evidently lingers
the delusion that bloodhounds are es
pecially huge and savage creatures, for
the Times assumes with what seems
to be more of hope than certainty that
the man hunted near Andover Is to be
in no danger. That accomplished. It
proceeds to point out that the hunting
of carted stags, or even of preserved
foxes, Is a strangely , different thing
from the ancestral efforts to supply
the cave with meat, and that there la
in such sport, injury to the feelings of
the zoophiles apart, little more than
the pleasure of riding a horse â not
"hard riding," but carefully regulated
progression that Involves a minimum
of danger.

Because he claimed acquaintance
with several restaurant keepers on the
Barbary Coast and talked at length
upon "jinks and "times" he had with
the artists all the dear girls called him
a true bohemian. Therefore he was
careless about his dress and used to
drink steam beer with his meals â when
anybody whom he knew was with him
â and acted the part of the true bo
hemian to the best of his ability.
One night he took a party of the fair
ones who wanted, oh so much, to get
a glimpse of bohemia. up to the mar
ionette show on Broadway. How the
fluffy things did gurgle as they climbed
the ladder up to the little gallery and
what smothered exclamations of de
light they emitted when the curtain
went up and Orlando proceeded to woo
the lady with the maplewood face with
all the ardor that his jointed arms
would permit of. The bohemian put on
a wise expression with just a tinge of
the bored, as If he had seen these
things so many times that there was
nothing new or surprising to such an
old member of bohemia. Notwith
standing the signs, he smoked a cigar
ette to show how well he was known
by the management and to what
lengths an old habitue of the place
could go.
But Luigi, the man with the change
able voice, who reads the scores behind
the scenes, "peeked out during the In
termission and seeing suoh a distin
guished party of American ladies,
thought that he ought to interpret the
score In English as a mark of honor
to his visitors. So when In the course
of the old melodrama It became nec
essary for the fair heroine to berate
tbe giant who kept her in captivity up
In his gloomy castle, Luigi cleared his
throat.
The giant with the pasteboard crown
laughed a haughty laugh. Then In the
purest English the heroine drew her
self up to her full height of three feet
six inches and delivered herself:
"I teacha you, you â ?â¢ !â¢!, for why

Cannon, the honorable Speaker of the

anecdotes which Mr. Low tells of him
gives one an insight Into the peculiar
powers of the man. It was in the last
session of Congress. Following' the re
modeling of the White House, there was
an auction sale of old furniture, and
among other things a sideboard, which
had been presented to the wife of
President Hayes by the young women
of Cincinnati, was sent to the auction
room. It seemed to one Democratic
member that a ruthless indignity was
about to be committed and he Intro
duced a resolution demanding an inves
tigation of the heinous transaction.
When he had finished, and while some
of the Republican members were quak
ing whether it would be their duty to
impeach the President, "Uncle joe"
Cannon arose:
"Mr. Speaker," he declaimed, "we are
told that In the early days of the re
public Abigail Adams hung out her
laundry to dry in the East Room of
the White House. Good God. Mr.
Speaker, where is that clothesline
now?" After that and the uproarious
shfut which followed, no more was
heard of the sideboard.

THE coming banquet of the Merchants' Association is
; to consider- one proposition â the proper exhibit at
St. Louis to set for the position, capacity, resources
and achievements of San Francisco. It is a pleasure to find
our business men united on a matter of such immense im
portance to San Francisco.
Time was that this city did not. have to bestir itself to
maintain primacy of this side of the continent. But the
very development which the enterprise of San Francisco
promoted naturally raised up rivals, with whom we now
must reckon. We call them rivals in no unfriendly spirit,
since their rivalry is a needed stimulus to our own enter
prise. We cannot afford to sit down in front of a geography
and point to our position thereon. Boston did that, and
thought that with her geography and her East Indian wharf
she had tÂ». oerpetual monopoly on the trade of the Atlantic
seaboard. New York penetrated the countty to the far
thest West with improved transportation, and while her cap
ital and energy raised up Chicago and dotted the Missis
sippi Valley with such centers as Omaha and Kansas City,
in the end they all proved to be her outlying tributaries,
benefiting her in proportion to her own prosperity. There
is no reason, in the natural order of things, that San Fran
cisco should not hold the same relation to this side of the
continent.
Some of our energetic rivals declare that we don't make
noise enough about our achievements. We are content to
do great things without u-^ing pains to use the widely
heard music of the trump of fame. So it is said that while
in our Ferry building we have the most imposing structure
of its kind in the United States and furnishing to the tide
of travel its best facilities, we said but little about it, except
to raise unjustifiable doubts about the sufficiency of its
foundation. In our new Federal building, on Seventh and
Mission streets, we have a structure which, in nobility of
architecture and charms of interior finish, ranks with the
Congressional Library in Washington. Yet its corner
stone is laid* without ceremony and its progress is noted
only by growls about the foundation on which it rests.
Chicago's new postoffice is an architectural monstrosity,
ignoble and unsatisfactory. Yet, when its cornerstone was
laid the President of the United States was invited and, with
his Cabinet, graced the ceremony. Millions of people in
the world will never see the Chicago building, but they will
never cease to hear Chicago's boasting abo-t its ceremonial
inauguration. In the nations of Europe it is the custom for
rulers and the nobility to attend the cornerstone laying of
public buildings, and so Europeans will always identify the
Chicago ceremony with those which have such august at
tendance. : â¢; '.""
There is no doubt that San Francisco may help herself by
giving more eclat to what she does. But we are a busy and
absorbed people and have been content to do and let others
find it out. The Merchants' Association will do well to put
a little more brass band into our heads by giving emphasis
to. the value of more publicity. It may be safely said that
San Francisco and all California far more than come up to
all the brag in which our people have ever indulged. We
have the goodr> and should advertise them better.

A scientist more sanguine than explicit has discovered to
his own satisfaction that it is always summer on the sun.
This announcement, however, no more makes old Sol a de

in general estimation. What most of us are looking for on
the other side is a comparatively cool place.

perience to him it rather staggered
both of us. Certain it Is that the
knowledge of that fire came to me

call to duty?"
"You remember the big Baldwin Ho

man to a little group of fellow work
ers gathered about the comfortable
fireplace in the Press Club lounging
room.
"I can tell you a story about that
fire," he continued, "which will give
you something to think about for a

boat to Oakland and was soundly
sleeping when the fire broke out some
where about early daybreak.
"Shortly before 6 o'clock that morn

to report for duty at once and to get to
the scene of the fire with all speed.

that I awoke with a start. I hurriedly
dVessed myself and posted off for the
first boat to San Francisco.
"On train and boat I heard about the
big fire, but It was no news to me. As
soon as the boat landed I made all
haste up Market street and hustled
.about to see who was in charge of the
story. Sure enough, there was the
city editor.
" 'What are you doing here?* he que
ried, as if much surprised.
" 'Why, you sent for me,' I replied, a
bit disturbed.
" 'I did nothing of the kind,' was the
astounding retort.
" 'Well, If you didn't, who under the
heavens did?' I urged.

gratifying to have such a movement started in the State by
a city of the size antl prestige of Oakland. The expansion
of cities and the consolidation of small communities into
larger ones, where such enterprises caa be carried out under
favorable conditions, are undoubtedly beneficial and tend to
improve municipal life. California has hitherto stood aloof
from the general movement in that direction, and as a re
sult our cities do not make a showing of growth equal to
that of Eastern cities. Oakland, therefore, is doing good
service by agitating the issue, even if it go no farther for a
while. In the end. however, there will be but one city on the
other side of the bay, but that one will be a city of first-class
rank.

Playgoers will crowd the Columbia
Theater this afternoon and swell the
fund that is raised each year by the
Associated Theatrical Managers to help
the needy and distressed members of
the profession. A programme of great
diversity will be presented. There will
be vaudeville turns, tragedy, comedy
and farce. All the theaters have sent
their best talent to strengthen the per
formance.
The Orpheum will be represented by
the three Zolars, European grotesque
acrobats; Warren and Blanchard, the
comedian and the singer; the Brlttons,
colored singers and dancers, and the
"Village Choir" quartet. Warren is one
of the best singers in vaudeville. His
rich, mellow voice has been heard to
advantage at the Orpheum this week.
The "Village Choir" quartet has been
singing itself into public favor and is
well worth hearing.
All those who have seen "Ben Hur"
at the Grand Opera-house and have
gazed upon the graceful form of Wil
liam Kelly and heard him rendering
the lines from General Lew Wallace's
famous book will be delighted to hear
him render a description of the chariot
race. All those who heard Miss Har
nette Keyes sing the solo In the second
scene of the fourth act of "Ben Hur"
will be pleased to N hear har render
"Since First I Met Thee," by Ruben
steln. Miss Keyes has a well-trained
voice and has a big Eastern reputation
as a vocalist.
"A Queen's Messenger," a drama in
one act, by J. Hartley Manners, will
be the offering of the Columbia Thea
ter. Virginia Harned and William
Courtney compose the cast. This was
originally produced at the Haymarket
Theater, London, and will be presented
for the first time in America at the Co
lumbia this afternoon. It is a gem in
its way and will be heartily appre
ciated by theatergoers.
The sextet from "Lucia dl'Lammer
moor" will be rendered by the best
artists now singing at the Tivoll in
grand opera. The Alcazar stock com
pany will present the third act from
"Lady Bountiful," from the pen of the

Estella E. Fitzgerald Is suing Wil
liam H. Fitzgerald for divorce on the
ground of extreme cruelty. She says
that for a long time prior to the filing
of her suit he abused her in a shame
ful manner. She says her health has
been ruined because of his treatment
and that on more than one occasion
she had been beaten black and blue by
him. She says he once told her he
would never provide more than a bare
home for her and that she need never
expect anything more. Fitzgerald is
habitually cross and sullen, avers his
wife, and almost daily curses and re
viles her.
Laura M. Wichman, who fourteen
years ago was married to John Wich
man, a prominent candy manufac
turer and dealer in the Mission, secured
a divorce on the ground of extreme
cruelty in Judge Graham's court yes
terday. She testified that she had been
abused by her husband until she could
no longer stand It, and that he had fre
quently told her that he did not want
to live with her any longer. She cried
as she made the admission that Wich :
man had accused her of being an un
faithful wife, and had more times than
she could remember called ntrr the
vilest of names. Her testimony was
corroborated by that of Lotha F.
Meyer. Under a stipulation filed dur
ing the proceedings the community
property of the couple is to be equally
divided.
business meeting vas held, and reports
read by Miss Marian C. Voorsanger
ehotved the council to be in a flourish
ing condition. Mrs. Louis Hertz, presi
dent of the organization, presided. Tea
and other refreshments were served. The
meeting ns held in the Sunday-school
rooms of the Temple Emanu-El and
was â¢well attended.
. The speaker advocated the organiza
tion of a choral society. When these
things have been accomplished and
there is more harmony among the
musicians, he said, the residents of this
city would advance in music.
Professor Stewart was heartily ap
plauded for his paper. During the aft
ernoon there was singing by Miss Adele
Shaw. Mrs. Juliet Greninger, Mrs. Zil
pha Ruggles Jenkins, Miss L. C. Stone
and Miss Darby.
Previous to the lecture and concert a
Professor H. J. Stewart delivered an
interesting address on the "Musical
Xeeds of San Francisco" before the
Council of Jewish Women at the Tem
ple Emanu-El yesterday afternoon. In
the course of his paper he said that
there was not enough harmony among
the musicians of San Francisco, and
until the discords were obliterated the
standard of music in this city would
not advance.
He also said that there should be
more outdoor concerts for the people.
He believed these concerts were edu
cational in their nature, and although
the park band was doing its share it
was not sufficient for the demands
made upon it. Professor Stewart was
ot the opinion that there ought to be
chairs in music at the University of
California and at Stanford University.
He called attention to the fact that
Harvard and Yale colleges have musi
cal chairs, and he thought the subject
was important enough for the colleges
of California to take up. He eaid he
hoped to see the day when San Fran
cisco would have a concert hall like
Carnegie Hall in Pittsburg, Pa. An
other thing that is lacking in this city,
he said, is a musical library. He called
upon the Council of Jewish Women to
collect the old Hebrew melodies and
turn them over to the Free Public Li
brary so the student can go and exam
ine the priceless scores.

church. William J. Blggy, formerly a
Police Commissioner, said he was a
Roman Catholic and a regular attend

-' Judge S. E. Benson is acting for
Wilkins. Last night notice was served
on the. Sheriff by the J. M. Wilkins
Company advising â¢ him that he was
wrong in permitting an attachment to
be served on the property belonging
to that company, as the personal affairs
of Mr; and Mrs. WHkina were in no
way connected with the incorporation.
The Cliff House property has had but
three different proprietors. The orig
inal house was built in 1863 and opened
by,. Captain J. E. ; Foster, who; was its
manager for twenty years. Then came
Moss & Sheldon, who ran it for three
years. Then came Wilkins, who has
been irr charge for the last eighteen
years. The original structure burned
Christmas night, 1894, and Wilkins was
a heavy loser at that time as he car
ried comparatively / small insurance.
The present structure was .finished in
October, 1895. It has never been closed.
Mr. Wilkins, in speaking of the mat
ter, stated: "The promissory notes
which are the basis of this action are
both personal debts of my own and
are in no way connected with the in
terests of the J. M. Wilkins Company.
This company was Incorporated about
two years ago and owns all the. furni
ture and contents of the Cliff House,
Including barroom furniture nnd fix
tures, organ and stock of merchandise.
There are 25,000 shares of stock in this
concern, of which I hold 3000 shares,
and 2500 shares of this I have placed
up as a collateral, so in reality I own
but 2500 shares. The balance of stock
is practically all owned by B. Warner
Rice, who is. vice president and treas-'
urer of the company. I am president
and manager of the corporation*, for
Â¦tfhich services I receive a salary. Mrs.
Wilkins owns five shares. The business
of the house will be In no way inter*
fered with."
B. Warner Rice, In speaking of the
suit, said: "The J. M. Wilkins Com
pany, in which I hold the majority of
stock, is in no way connected with this
suit which has been brought against
Wilkins. The notes in question are his
own personal obligations and the com
pany has nothing to do with them. The
affairs the concern are in a flourish
ing condition. We are making money,
do not owe a dollar to any one and
have a fine balance in the bank to our
credit. I shall not let the business of
the house be stopped and Wilkins will
continue to manage the place so long as
I control the stock." ......
LAWYER GIVES VIEWS.
Two suits were brought yesterday
against J. M. Wilkins, proprietor of the
Cliff House, by John Sroufe to recover
an amount approximating $35,000, al
leged to be due on two notes given to
the plaintiff several years ago.
A writ of attachment in the sum of
$32,423 78 was served yesterday on Wil
kins, and keepers were sent out to the
Cliff House. Garnishments were placed
on a deposit box in the Western Na
tional Bank belonging to Wilkins and
also on funds in other banks and on
the stock in the Cliff House. ' .
The commencement of the alleged In
debtedness dates back about seventeen
years, when Wilkins first went to take
charge of the famous hostelry. Sroufe
advanced moneys and sold merchandise
to Wilkins and the sum has gradually
grown until it has reached the present
proportions. Attorney Charles A.
Shurtleff, who represents the plaintiff,
states that they do not in any way
wish to interfere with the business of
the Cliff House and have no desire to
injure Wilkins, but his client wants
money. So far as they are concerned
the business of the place will not be
interfered with. The house is still open
to the public, though the keepers are
in charge.

Would Care for Dibbern Estate.
Public Administrator John Fafnham
yesterday filed a petition for letters of
administration upon "the estate of j
Henry Dibbern, the merchant who died"
suddenly at the Palace Hotel Wednesday
morning. The petition recites that the
estate of the deceased is worth more
than $10,000 and that the names and ad
dresses of his heirs, if he left any. are
unknown to the petitioner.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â Henry Seton
Merrlman (Hugh Stowell Scott), tha
novelist. Is dead. He had been suffer
ing from appendicitis for a week.
Ten days later, says the plaintiff.
Manning called upon her and In the
presence of numerous persons asked
her mother, a . Mrs. Glascr of Mendo
clno Countv, If she had any objection
to Mm as a son-in-law. Mrs. Glaser.
it is alleged, told him she had none,
and thereupon Manning shook hand3
with everybody, kissed his prospective
bride, eÂ»d then Joined in a general d!s
cussion of the wedding. Mrs. McGlynn
says she even introduced him to the
ladies she had selected to act as her
bi idesmaids.
Now comes the harrowing part of the
tale. The widow says that since that
day she has not seen Manning, but sha
cays shb has heard about him. and
what the has heard has caused her
the keenest mental anguish. She says
that she has learned that the reason
lor the last month and a half her recre
ant lever has not been near her is that
hi has put in his time running about
with other women, married and unmar
ried, and of good reputation and other
wise, and has lavished his affections
upon them, greatly to her humiliation
and pain.
All the preparations were completed
and. accordine to the complaint. Mrs.
McGlynn, accompanied by a lady frienrl
and Manning, on August 20 took a trip
to the little bay town. Mrs. McGlynn
confidently expected that she would re
turn Mrs. Manning, and her belief she
says was strengthened when Manning,
after leavlns the train, took her di
rectly to the house of a clergyman.
But the weddins never came off, for,
alleges Mxs. McGlynn, Manning was
taken sick at the home of the. minister
and all three were compelled to return
to San Francisco.
Louise Mary McGlynn, a comely
widow, who claims that she was Jilted
by Patrick Manning, a wealthy mining
man, wants $20,000 as balm for her
wounded feelings. A suit for that
amount for breach of promise was filed
yesterday by Frank P. Haynes, Mrs.
McGlynn's attorney.
Mrs. McGlynn and Manning first met
in November of last year. They be
came great friends and before a year
had elapsed their friendship had rip
ened Into love. It waa in August of
this year, alleges Mrs. McQIynn, that
Manning first let her know that his
regard for her was something warmer
than mere friendship and asked her
to become his wife. She says she ac
cep;ed him, told all her friends of her
new found happiness, then made prep
arations for the wedding. The mar
riage was to have taken place in Napa.
ten days after the announcement of the
engagement; Â¦"' ' v
In his flight Kelly dropped several
bogus bills. When searched at the City
Prison more than thirty of - the bad
pieces of paper were found on his per
son. He made several other attempts
yesterday afternoon to pass off the
Confederate bills on other grocers and
fruit dealers In the same neighborhood,
but all these tradesmen were suspicious
and would take no chances.
Harry Kelly, a young man with an
air of prosperity, was arrested yester
day afternoon after a lively chase by
Patrolman Blrdsall at Sutter and La
guna streets and locked up pending an
investigation as to his operations and
movements within the last few days.
Kelly is accused of having passed off
numerous Confederate $20 bills on cor
ner grocery men and -secured good
United States coin in exchange.
Kelly numbers among his victims
four grocers and the number is likely
to be Increased ere long, as the police
think that they can trace many more
crimes of a similar nature to the* pre
possessing young man. Among his
dupes are H. Helnrichsen. Webster and
Sutter streets; C. H. Vensler, Hyde and
Geary streets, and Henry Schlen, Hyde
and Broadway. All these men were
handed $20 Confederate bills in payment
for merchandise and all gave good
money in return.
On last Thursday afternoon Kelly en
tered Vensler's store and purchased
a bottle of whisky. In return he gave
the bad $20 bill and was handed $19
in change. An hour later he appeared
at Schlen's place and went through the
same performance. Nothing more was
heard of Kelly till the following
Wednesday afternoon, when he went
Into Heinrichsen's store and asked for
two bottles of whisky. He requested
that the liquor be sent to a near by ad
dress and when the clerk arrived with
the articles Kelly was waiting for him
on the doorstep. He gave a bad $20 bill
In payment and received $18 in change.
Kelly's downfall came yesterday
afternoon when he walked into the
grocery at Laguna and Sutter streets
kept by W. E. Goetz. He asked the
clerk for a bdttle of whisky, and the
latter becoming suspicious, called In
Patrolman Birdsall. As soon as Kelly
saw the officer he started to run, but
made the grievous mistake of turning
into a near by blind alley, where he
was captured.

structing him not to permit the prize
fights scheduled for Friday night be

An attempt will be made to find a
suitable home for the unfortunate chil
dren, as their mother is not a fit guard
ian for them.
A sad case of cruelty and neglect on
the part of a drunken, heartless mother
was brought to the attention of the
police yesterday in a squalid and filthy
room at â¬20 Sixth street. The unnatural
woman is Mrs. Maggie Simmons, wlfa
of a teamster. She was locked up on
a charge of being drunk and her three
small children were given in charge of
the matron at the Emergency Hospital.
The youngest of the llttleones is but
7 months of age and the oldest of the
trio is hardly big enough to care for
herself, yet she has been looking after
the other two as best she could for two
weeks, during which time the mother
has been off on a prolonged spree.

Yesterday Detective Taylor took Ed
ward Bruno, a boy about 17 years of age,
from a shoe shop on Stockton street,
where he is employed, to the young girl,
as his description answered that given
by her, but she said he was not the
guilty person, for he had brown eyes.
Brune had Just served two terms In the
County Jail for battery, and Taylor dis
covered that" he had been away from the
shoe shop on Wednesday from noon till
2 o'clock. ThÂ« assault was alleged to
have been committed between X and 2
o'clock. Brune served his terms for at
tempting to assault young girls. He vfas
not detained, owing to the girl's failure
to identify him.
The police are still working to learn
the name of the youth who, it is alleged,
enticed Adelaide Christensen, a domestic
employed at 1715 Broderick street, into a
vacant house at California and Baker
streets on Wednesday afternoon, and, at
the point of a revolver, attempted to as
sault her. â

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19.â The Port
land men's poor fielding game and their
Inability to hit Hal! resulted In a vic
tory for Los Angeles to-day by the
score of 5 to 1. Los Angeles scored five
runs on as many hits, chiefly because
the visitors fumbled the ball miser
ably. McFarlan pitched good ball and
with proper support would have made
It a close score. Score:

Corbett weighs about 134 pounds. He
says he has been a total abstainer for
three months, and looKs the part.
Corbett is to flsht Eddie Hanlon be
fqre the Hayes Valley Club next month.
There are two conditions he demands
before he signs the articles â the fight
must take place in Mechanic^' Pavilion
and he must receive c bonus of 10 per
cent, as he is the champion. He will
discuss these matters to-day with Man
ager Levy.
Young Corbett, the feather-weight
champion boxer, accompanied by Harry
"Weeden, arrived in this* city at an early
hour yesterday morning, fresh from his
Eastern triumphs.
The triD across the continent upset
ths little champion and he went to bed
at the Palace l^otel immediately upon
his arrival. * Dr. McGettigan was sum
moned and found his patient merely
suffering, from the shaking up he re
ceived ca the way out here. Simple
remedies and a few hours' rest restored
him to his normal condition.
Several speeches were made at the
meeting last evening. When the time
came to elect a captain Stroud received
the unanimous vote of his fellow play
ers for the position.
Stroud played center in last week's
game, and has still one more year in
which to play. He played center on the
Oakland High School team until he
graduated, after which he took the
same position on the freshman team at
Berkeley. He made the varsity last
year, and has an excellent record on
the gridiron.
At a meeting of the. members of the
University of California football team
in Zinkand's last evening Benjamin K.
Stroud was elected* captain of the
eleven for the coming year.

have a good view of the ring. The gal

have been noted In his defense, as
shrewd sporting men see nothing to the
bout but Britt. The latter is in perfect
shape. The twenty rounds he went
with Seiger helped place him in condi

hands and his injured foot are in per
fect order and he promises his friends
he will go the distance at a lively clip.
Britt will be seconded by* "Spider"
Kelly, Tim McGrath and Curtis Rich
ardson. Canole will have Alec Greg
gains as his chief adviser. George
Gardner may als&> go behind him.
Harry Foley and Dave Barry will be
in Canole's corner.
Ring-goers will Journey down to
Colma to-night to see Jimmy Britt and
Martin Canole battle twenty-five
rounds for what virtually means the
lightweight championship. Britt claims
the title, which Is held by Gans, and
he will do his best to uphold it. In
Canole he will find one of the best men
in his class. Eastern critics look upon
Martin as a clever boxer, and betting
men. basing their Judgment on reports
received from the East? will play
Canole at the odds which Byitt's friends
have made. The betting is 2 to L with
Britt favorite.
Jack Welch will referee the battle.
He was selected yesterday by the prin
cipals after a short parley. Canole
wanted Welch and Willie Britt quick
ly accepted him. Welch has not ref
ereed a fight in many months, but he
is a competent Judge of boxing.
Referee Eddie Graney has gone Into
training for the bout. Eddie expect!"
some strenuous work when the big fel
iowg get together and is taking no
chances.
The sale of seats continues large at
CorbetfE. There is every indication
that there v.ill be more than a ?20.000

Fitz has got rid of his cold and now
feels like a two-year-old. He has been
playing a heavy tattoo on his punching
bag and starring partner for the last
two nnedca and the men are beginning
to feel the forc-e of Fitz's blows. Fitz
has had no trc-uble making weight and
in fact will so into the ring weighing
164 pound?.
Each day sees a large crowd of spec

works out daily at CrcHl's and Gardner
Is quartered at Larkspur. Gardner

the protection. George looks as big as
a house ar.d his admirers say he will
loom up heavier and bigger than the
blacksmith.
Public opinion seems to be divided on
the merits of Fitzsimmons and Gard
ner. Both men have large followings
and â¢each' is picked to win. Many be
lieve that Gardners youth and strength
will aid him in beating the Cornish

Fitz is still there with the punch and if
he lands on Gardner the latter will be
sent into dreamland.

TRACK NOTES.
D. Hall keeps moving right along. He
added two more winning mounts to 'his
list yesterday.
Dugan, an Oregon product, rode
Canejo when she finished last in a race
on Saturday, but for some reason Fer
rell took a trick at the whÂ°el yester
day. A well-known professor of math
ematics has been engaged at an enor
mous salary to figure out how many
pounds better Ferrell is than Dugan,
and expects to have finished his task
by Thanksgiving day. Canejo took the
running away from Loyal S on the
back stretch and won in . stake-horse
fashion from Galanthus, the second
choice. Jtollick, the 9 to 10 favorite,
showed no speed.
There was no holding Ben MacDhui
in the concluding mile purse run. The
Ryan horse was held at odds of 9 to 20
and led from start to finish. Away
poorly Byron Rose managed to get the
place anyway, those in front of him
stopping almost to a walk. Arcade,
carrying the colors- of W. B. Jennings,
finished a fair third. s
Billy Magrane's shifty mudlark, Matt
Hogan, had nothing to beat in the third
number and splashed . home an easy
winner over Berendos. Three to five
was about the best price obtainable.
Laureatea took the show.
Foley slipped away in front with C.
B. Campbell, leading Miracle II into
the stretch. Down the back stretch
it did not take Ferrell any longer to
close up his ground lost at the start
than it does for a train brakeman to
slam a door. This left the favorite
nothing to finish on. "Big Bill" Knapp
furnished a vigorous ride on Miracle II.
which was played from S down to 5,
and at the end won cleverly from C.
B. Campbell. The favorite ran third,
three lengths farther back.
Twelve moderate selling platers lined
up in the opening six furlong sprint
and the Montana contingent tried to
make some noise with Flourish. They
ran their coin through the board on
the big bay at 15 to 1. In a drive Alta
G. another 15 to 1 shot, beat him out
almost a length. Foul Play finished
third and Toto Gratiot, the lukewarm
choice, fourth.
DORICE WINS ALL THE WAY.
Avenger, the speedy colt from the
Schorr stable, opened favorite for the
two-year-old scramble, 'out there
seemed a lack of action and from 2
the price went to 13 to 5. Barney
Schreiber's Dorice . was backed from
3 to 2, and ridden by D. Hall won all
the war. Anirad, a 10 to 1 chance
from the Coffey stable, disposed of
Metlakatla for the place. Avenger met
with many mishaps.
FOLEY IN FRONT.
Rain and mud are not conducive to
tiptop sport in the racing line, but at
that three riders managed to paddle
across the line first on favorites in the
betting yesterday at Oakland track.
Outsiders captured the other three
events. The downfall of Horton, at
7 to 10,' was a stagge.rine blow to the
backers of the Burns handicap winner
of a year ago. The card throughout
was only a fair one, but attracted the
usual crowd.
Horton, which ruled a top heavy
choice for the mile and 100 yard run,
appeared to stand out as one of the
real mellow ones to speculate on. He
no doubt would have won but for a
stunt of Ferrell's at the post. When
Dick Dwyer sprung the barrier Ferrell
in some manner let Horton swerve, los
ing several lengths.

The decision will be eagerly awaited,
not only by those financially interested,
but by the legal luminaries of two con
tinents. The Katz- Walkinshaw suit
jt now known as "the percolation case"
end the Supreme Court strives vainly
to solve it. So deeply are the Justices
engaged that no ether opinion has been
handed down for. several days.
When the case came up for a hearing
in bank various attorneys appeared for
.scores of interested parties. After
ward, when the court had ordered the
case submitted, briefs of great number,
length and wisdom were filed. Inas
much as the geological savants are un
able to explain exactly how fluids pass
to and fro beneath the surface, of the
earth. It may be evident that the Jus
tices of the Supreme Court of Califor
nia have a right to puzzle over the an
swer to the question of ownership of
subterranean matter which is not sta
tionary- . Outside of the dispute over
the oil and water phases of the ques
tion, the mining men are . wondering
about detritus.
A petition for a rehearing was filed
in the Supreme Court within the time
allowed by lav.-. In this document the
question of percolation was the vital
point. The Supreme Court Immediately
decided to reconsider. That was more
than a year ago.
Could some one in Kings County
commence suit agrainst the fellow who
was erecting ia derrick in Sonoma? ; If
a man owned land beneath which was
a wealth of oil, should he not have a
right to get some of it? Perhaps the
neighbor who had bored the first well
had merely struck a branch of the
first man's deposit of petroleum. If the
.frst person who tapped an under
Â¦fround river owned the entire supply,
wouJd not the same argument apply to
the possession of the oil flowing in
tiny Ktreamlets through the terrestrial
crust?.
The owners of oil producing proper
ties became excited when they were
apprised of the decision of the Su
preme Court. They began asking one
another who had tapped other people's
eubterranean reservoirs of petroleum.
Could the pentleman who first dropped
his drill through the enveloping strata
claim all the oil in Kern County?
OIL MEN ARE ALARMED
-Justice Temple, then a member of the
Supreme Court, went to work on the
tangle and at last produced an opinion
which Justices McFarland, Van Dyke,
Harrison and Henshaw and Chief Jus
tice Beatty signed In token of assent.
It was declared that the trial court
had erred in granting a non-suit and
â¢that Mrs?. Katz had some merit in her
contentions. A new trial was ordered.
The case would have gone back to the
Superior Court for a retrial, but a new
difficulty arose.
The matter was finally referred to
4he courts for adjudication. The case
was hastily passed up to the Supreme
Court. There were all sorts of water
cases on record. There were dozens of
irrigation suits, riparian rights suits
and drainage 6uits, but when it came
to subterranean rivers the law was as
unproductive of Information as the
wastes of San Bernardino County are
of mangoes.
When Mrs. Walklnshaw's artesian
well commenced to be productive the
water supply in the Katz well began
to fall short. Mrs. Katz alleged that
Mrs. Walkinshaw had tapped her sub
marine river. Mrs. Walkinshaw alleged
that she owned whatever of the under
ground stream might be on her own
property. The ladies could not seem to
come to a mutual decision as to what
were their respective rights. Each ac
knowledged the claim of the other to a
portion of the earth, but both were in
doubt as to the ownership of the waters
under the earth.
In the present case two score of Cal
ifornia's eminent jurists have been en
gaged In the preparation of arguments.
Thousands of the State's capitalists are
Interested in the settlement of the dis
pute; and the Supreme Court sits medi
tatively knitting its brows.
It all had a small beginning down in
San Bernardino County. Leah J. Katz
was the owner of an artesian well.
Slargaret D. Walkinshaw, who was the
possessor of property adjoining that on
which the artesian well was located,
approved of this method, by which
water could be so easily secured, and
determined to emulate her neighbor'^
example. A well was bored In mother
earth and eventually Mrs. Walkinshaw
was setting daily a generous supply of
the original natural liquid.
TSOXJBLE ARISES.
The Justices of the Supreme Court of
tills State are puzzling over what is
eaJd to be the most perplexing problem
ever presented to an American tribunal.
The case is absolutely unique In the
history of the jurisprudence of the
United States. There is apparently no
authority for a decision in behalf of
either of the litigants.
The members of the State's court of
f.nal appeal have pulled down all the
dusty old tomes from the top shelves
in a vain endeavor to secure some light
on the subject over which they study.
"Draconian law, Roman law, English
law and "the law of the other civilized
Countries appear to be barren of in
formation which would tend to eluci
date the question. The Justices would
Cclve further into the Jurisprudence of

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 19.â With
whistles blowing to give warning of
her approach, the coast liner Geo. W.
Elder, in tow of the Ocklahama, crash
ed into the river steamer Kellogg late
this afternoon.
The Elder was being moved -from the
dock of'the -Willamette Iron and Steel
Works, where she had anew foremast
installed. Before passing through the
draw of the steel bridge the Kellogg
was noticed lying aty the south* end of
the Ains worth dockland 'the Elder's
whistle -was "blown for 'her to get out
of the way. "Â¦
The steamer Northwest' was moored
at the Bame dock,' just- below the Kel
logg, and it was impossible for her to
move" downstream. The Elder and her
big escort were carried on .the current
at a rapid pace- and the steamer In
front of them was caught in a trap.
The Elder crashed into her, splintering
the Kellogg's wheelhouse.
The Ocklahama managed to back oft
with her tow, but In doing so she threw
the Elder over against the pilling be
neath the bridge. No damage resulted
from this further than the breaking In

TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 19.â No doubt
now exists that the wonderful natural
gallery found several weeks ago at the
north end of Gabriola Island in Van
couver harbor is the cave described as
Malaspina's "gallery" in the Spanish
prints of over a century ago.
British Columbians familiar with
these old Spanish records have often
wonder\d if such a gallery as that de
scribedoy Malaspina ever existed. A
pleasure party last month came across
the cave in question. by. accident. The
gallery was found to be a. large cave
cut out of solid sandstone rock by the
action of the waves . driven by strong
north winds. The records at Nanaimo
and Victoria clearly indicated that the
discovery was none other than' the gal
lery described in Malaspina's records.
Professor Davidson of Stanford Uni
versity now writes to friends at Na
naimo, Inclosing a copy of the old
Spanish picture of Malaspina's gallery,
which corresponds in detail to the cavÂ«
recently found. Professor Davidson
writes:
"Malaspina himself was never in
those waters, but under his commis
sion when he 'had gone to the Philip
pine Islands there were two vessels sur
veying at Burrard Inlet. Vancouver
came across them June 30, 1792, and
was entertained by them."

K. W. Burton is a bad actor when he
has assimilated an unwonted amount
of the kind of liquid that is handed out
by the bartender of a combined saloon
and grocery store. This much
he admitted to Judge Cabaniss
yesterday. But there was other
evidence to sustain his claim that when
he eschewed the allurements of the
bartender he was a capable mechanic
and followed his work sedulously.
The testimony went to show that he
entered the saloon and grocery of Os
car Shoenfeld on Fulton street and be
cause the Martini cocktail he ordered
was not "dry" sufficiently to satisfy
his taste he rendered the establishment
a discouraging wreck. One plate glass
window, valued at $50, was kicked
out In fragments on the street, the
crockery on the lunch counter was
ground up into an , Indistinguishable
mass with the crackers and bologna,
and the scales on which the ordinary
disbursements of the grocery were
made to the customers were rendered
Inoperative.
Other -things might have happened
from Burton's outburst, but the "' pro

and temporarily put him Into a state

of the gas company have had trouble
with her before and it was only after
they had forced their way into her
place of business and taken out the
meter' that "she condescended to visit
the office and pay down the money
which she is accused of having subse

carried the weeping child tenderly out
of the courtroom. - v i. ; ' -i
The mother has a remarkable record.
After she was divorced from Gibson
she was married to an engraver named
Cunningham, who claimed that she
substituted the little girl who w as a
witness in the case as a child ofi nis.
He maintained that the real baby* was
a boy and had died. On the showing
he made he was granted a divorce.
Next she married a man named Judd
Trove, who runs a livery stable at
Mission and Twenty-second streets.
He claimed that she nearly ruined him
and he obtained a divorce from her.
Two years ago, when she ran a candy
Ftore out on Valencia street, she shot
three times at a policeman named
Brown, who tried to arrest her for dis
turbing the peace of the neighbors.
According to the testimony of the
office force of the gas company, the
woman persistently refused to return
the money and made insulting remarks
to several of tha force when they tried
to coax her back to reason. The de
fendant, bright-eyed and glowing, fol
lowed the witnesses with cross-ques
tioning so persistently that she had to
be warned several times against con
tempt of court. In such cases she ac
cused Judge Mogan or unfairness and
he was finally compelled to fine her $20
for violations of respect. The fine was
Imposed more as a deterrent than a
penalty and will probably never go Into
the record.
It was a caee of a woman against
the gas company yesterday that oc
cupied Judge Mogan. From 11 o'clock
In the morning until the twilight fell
he battled with his conviction that the
defendant, who gave her name as
Laura Trevor, should be committed for
contempt, but he managed to last out
until the closing Hours of the court,
and the woman went, free until this
morning, when argument in the case
will be heard. ;;',V T
The defendant Is something of- a re
markable woman in her way. which she
evinced early In the proceedings. She
Insisted on being her own attorney,
against the advice of Judge ; Mogan.
During the morning and afternoon ses
sions, through which * the ! case lasted,
all the colleagues of the able . Jurist
wandered in, and took fronf seats to
watch his discomfiture. Between his
desire. to be courteous and a determina
tion to maintain the dignity of his
court ho had a hard battle. The. wom
an was accused of the larceny of $3
from the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company. Many of the office force
sustained the allegation- of the- com
plaining witness, Robert Bowman, who
Is cashier for the company. He said
that on August 27 the woman came
there and asked for her gas bill. She
was given it by one of the bookkeepers
and, taking it to the cashier's desk,
put down $3, which the bill called tpr.
He allowed the money to remain on
his desk while he made out the receipt.
After he had made his entries and
handed the receipted bill to the de
fendant Bhe crabbed the money and
thereafter refused to return either.
Senator Robert T. Devlin of Sacra
mento, attorney for the Anti-Debris As
sociation, attempted to correct certain
alleged inaccuracies. made by speakers
during the heat of debate at the min
ers' convention on Wednesday last, but
the privilege of the floor was denied
him. 'Mr. Devlin attended th'e session
to hear the discussion on the resolution
requesting Congress to expend $500,000
under the direction of the California
Debris Commission for the purpose of
constructing impounding dams.
In discussing the matter last evening
Senator Devlin spoke as follows:
"I dropped in accidentally to listen to
the proceedings of the miners' conven
tion, and arrived just as Mr. Ralston
began his speech. There were certain
statements made by him that were in
accurate, and I thought the Miners'
Association would desire to know what
the facts were. With that object I rose
to ask the privilege of addressing the
body so as to set them Tight on these
points' but Senator Voorheis moved
the previous question. I tried to obtain
permission when the chairman put the
previous question, and after- the motion
had been decided asked the privilege
of saying a few words upon the subject,
stating that I was not a member of
the association, but as some statements
had been made that were erroneous I
presumed the association desired to
know the exact truth. This permission
was refused, and as they did not desire
to hear the other side I left, as I had
no daBlre to hinder them in their work.
HOW THEY ERRED.
"In the* first place, it was, stated that
the Anti-Debris Association had used
the Miners' Association In securing the
appropriations for building a dam on
the Yuba River, and now the Miners'
Association has found that such dams
would do them no good. The fact is
that the Hon. Tirey L. Ford went to
Washington as the representative of
the Miners' Association to secure the
passage of a bill appropiiating $l,"025,000
for the erection of dams for mining
purposes. He was very plainly told,
however, by several members of Con
gress that the United States Govern
ment would refuse to appropriate one
dollar for hydraulic mining or any oth
er private interest, and the only way
in which such an appropriation could
be secured was by the insertion of a
clause in the river and harbor bill on
the theory that the dams would im
prove the rivers by holding back the
debris- already, lodged therein by the
miners by hydraulic mining operations.
"We of the Sacramento Valley recog
nized. that the ejection of these dams
would be useful *o us in holding back
that "debris, provided hydraulic miners
should not be allowed to resume opera
tions, and Joined in securing appropria
tions for that purpose. The miners then
had the hope that they some day would
be able to obtain permission to resume
hydraulic mining. If they have given
up that hopeâ and if they are wise they
will do soâ that is their business, and
not ours.
ANOTHER ERROR CORRECTED.
"Again it was charged that the Anti-
Debris Association raised technicali
ties in court against permits issued by
the California Debris Commission. The
truth is that as attorney for the Anti-
Debris Association I agreed, in the case
of the county of Sutter against Jerry
Goodwin and others, to have the effect
of a permit passed on by the courts,
but when we came to trial the miners
withdrew all allegations relating to
such permit and the matter was not
before the court. In a later case, which
I conducted as attorney for the Anti-
Debris Association against the Polar
Star mine, the permit in effect was de
fective, but I stipulated that I would
take advantage of no defect and would
agree that it was a good permit, so as
to bring the question clearly before the
court. The miners said they desired
the courts to pass on the matter and
I did everything in my power to facil
itate the decision. The matter was
heard before Judge Davis of Yuba and
he. decided the mining company was
doing injury and they could not hide
behind a permit. They wished to ap
peal the case to the Supreme Court,
they said, but they failed to do so, and
I am only too anxious that they should,
bo that the matter shall be adjudicated
before the courts of last resort.
AS TO MINERS' DEEDS.
"Something was said about' compel
ling the miners to make a deed of their
mines to the Government to secure a
permit from the - California ipebris
Commission. This provision was in
serted by the miners themselves so as
to confer ostensible jurisdiction - upon
the United States Government. When
ever they wish we will consent that
they may strike that clause out of the
law. Â¦ : â¢ .
"Relative to suits brought by the
Anti-Debris Association, we have . no
power excetft that which any other
citizen has,, of applying to the courts
for relief and the grievance of the hy
draulic miners is not against us. but
against the laws of the land. If the
law does not justify us in the suits we
will not Judgment, and their
proposition practically amounts to; a
declaration that the people of-the val
ley must lie by and see:their property
destroyed without resorting to the
courts for protection. The truth in a
nutshell is that; many hydraulic min
ers caro nothing what injury they do
so long as their profit Is secured.
HYDRAULIC MINING 0PP033D.
"The Anti-Debris Association is- not
opposed to any other kind of mining
than 1 hydraylic and is only . opposed Â¦ to
hydraulic when it does injury. It
would be. only : too. glad to, see some
mode devised whereby ; hydraulic ; min
ing could , be 'conducted without injury
to the navigable rivers of the State,
but it regrets to say that in many.: in

bris would Â¦ Incur.', ;'-Â» .

Judge Fritz issued an attachment
yesterday against the person of Robert
W. Mitchell because he refused per
sistently to appear in court to prose
cute David Baird. He had the defend
ant arrested some weeks ago on the
charge of assaulting him with a dead
ly weaDon. Youns Baird is "a some
what notorious character who inherited
a large amount from his father's estate
and has since then been going the pace
that kills. On the charge on which he
was arrested he was/4ccused of forcing
Mitchell, who is the general agent on
the Pacific Coast of the New York Life
Insurance Company, to drink with him
at the Rubs House bar. Subsequently
Baird fired a bullet through the door
of the barroom and was . convicted of
discharging firearms within the' city
limits. Judge Fritz wants Mitchell to
prosecute, the other charge: or give
some legitimate reason for dropping it
Johanna Mahoney was allowed to go
at liberty on Monday by Judge Fritz
on condition that she would appear
each day in the week in a sober state.
The allowance was fringed around by
certain conditions that she would get
six months in the County Jail, "pro
vided she broke her contract. Yester
day she tumbled into Judge Conlan's
court in a painful state of inebriety,
with an additional charge of petty lar
ceny against her. Some woman friend
had found her wandering the streets
and had taken her to a room. She
evinced her gratitude by awakening
early in the morning arid decamping
with a bundle of clothes belonging to
her benefactress, which she sold to a
second-hand dealer and spent' the
money for liquor. Miss Mahoney; will
spend nine months in the County Jail
in consequence of her indiscretion.

fiee men. He was bound over yester
day, by Judge- Conlan to the Sdperibr
Court on the charge of burglary. Foi

the drug store of G. W. Burnett and
on the night of November 13 he was
caught coming out of the store with a

John O'Brien found himself without
money or credit a few nights ago and
with a thirst that would brook no de
lay. Accordingly he accosted Theodore
Dish, fresh from a career on the salt
seas, and demanded money. Dish had
a lone $5 piece in his pocket as the re
sult of a voyage to the Arctic looking
for whales and he wanted to keep it.
O'Brien took it away from him. The
hold-up occurred at Third and Market
streets, and as the robber sprinted
away with his booty he was followed
by Policeman Jack Tillman and two
citizens, who overhauled him. The ex
torted gold was found in O'Brien's
pocket and Judge Conlan held him yes
terday in $3000 bonds to answer to the
Superior Court on the charge of rob
bery.
P. J. Hastings was bound over to the
Superior Court yesterday by Judge
Conlan on the charge of assault with
intent to commit murder. According
to the defendant's story, he engaged
apartments at a' lodging-house at 32
East street, where Joseph Davis, the
complaining witness, occupies the
exalted position of night clerk. Hast
ings 6ays he was called upon to pay
60 cents for his room and when he
arose in the morning he ascertained
that the regular charge for such ac
commodations was 15 cents. In an ef
fort to recover the differential he tried
to scalp the night clerk with a case
knife he had in his possession. This
hasty method of redress may mean a
term in the penitentiary for him.
Charles Taylor, who looks like a
Jamaica "nigger," was convicted on
general principles yesterday in Judge
Conlan's court. The specific charge
against him was exhibiting a deadly
weapon. The testimony showed 1 " that
he invited his Honolulu lady at a Pa
clflc-street dance hall to go to supper
with him. She didn't really want to ac
company him, but he drew a razor and
displayed such possibilities with It that
she got her wraps and went along.
When she passed a policeman she broke
away and called the officer's attention
to her peril. The weapon was recover
ed from the sidewalk and the insistent
hospitaler lodged in Jail. Judge Con-
Ian thought that sirch strenuous invita
tions to a little supper for two should
be abrogated and Taylor will probably
spend some months at a resort where
meals are offered regularly in a more
seemly manner,
was in the warm arms of Justice and
hugged up tightly.
Ju^ge Cabaniss was inclined to take
a lenient view of the matter and after
all financial claims had been adjusted
satisfactorily he allowed the eruptive
defendant to seek his employment
dgam under a promise to avoid vol
canic lmblblngs in the future.

The steam schooner Charles Nelson
is still alongside the Sixteenth-street
drydock, where she is discharging her
cargo of lumber. She will not go on
the dock until all the freight is out of
her. Buch examination as can so far
be made reveals the fact that the ves
sel Is in pretty bad shape. Her engine
room is filled to a depth of four feet
with a combination of ashes and mud
and her machinery will require a lot
of overhauling. From present indica
tions the bill for repairs will be in .he
neighborhood of $20,000. Although the
amount of salvage claimed is $35,000. it
is thought that between $15,000 and
$20,000 wiy be all that the court will
allow.
Charles Nelson in Bad Shape.
The Sailors' Home, of which Ferem is
superintendent at a salary of nothing
a year and which he uses as a sailor
boarding-house on- strictly sailor
boarding-house lines, is a property
worth about $400,000.- It was leased by
the Government to the city at a rental
of $1 a year, to be used as a home. for
Eick and destitute seamen. The Ladles'
Seaman's Friend Society took charge
of the home and put Ferem In as su-
The articles of agreement under
which the sailor trust was formed are
said to be in the possession of Charles
McCarthy, who was appointed business
manager at a salary of $75 a month,
The agreement is said to be signed by
the following: John Ferem, Thomas
Murray & Son, Thomas Chandler, Fred
Hunt, Charles McCarthy, Jack O'Brien,
John Savory. Harry Hansen, George
Webb, Henry Lewis, Cane Bros., John
Cane. Henry Brown. Richard Graham.
Peter Holberg, John Curtin. William
Lane, Thomas Newman, Timothy Haw
kins and W. P. Herman.
AGREEMENT IS DEPOSITED.
Everything went lovely until it was
discovered that Ferem, taking full ad
vantage of the high figure to which
the ring had forced the blood money,
was shipping crews at Eureka and San
Diego independently of the ring. It
is also charged that he was taking
more than his agreed share of the local
business.
"When we found that Ferem Â¦was not
giving us a square deal," said John
Cane yesterday, "we decided that un
less we were crooked our share of the
business would get lighter and lighter.
I then went to a captain and asked
him how many men he wanted.
"Fourteen," he said. "Tell Ferem you
want ten," I told him, "and you and I
will divvy up on the other four."
Then came Captain John Barneson's
refusal to pay blood money. With the
aid of W. B. Swears, shipping master
for the Pacific Mail Company, he se
cured crews for several and
knocked the ring's scale all out of tune.
The ring went out of business and
blood money became uncollectable.
Hawkins, Herman, Savory and the
Canes wanted back their $50. It was
in the bank, and the bank book, they
claim, was in Ferem's possession.
When they filed the suit, they say, the
money was drawn from the bank and
divided, all the members of the ring
but the complaining quintet getting a
share. It is for their share they are
suing.
The schedule with which they started
called for $25 advance. $35 blood money,
51 boat hire. This for each man shipped.
Ferem was to get one-quarter of all
the business, the remaining three
quarters to be divided equally among
the other boarding-house masters.
Each member of the ring, as a prelim
inary, paid in $50 for the founding, of
a contingent fund, or "fall" fund as
pome of the franker of the members
prefer to call it. The $61 obtained for
each sailor was to be split up between
the boardins^ouse keeper, whose share
was $45; the shipping master, who got
$15. and the boatman, who was paid
$1 for taking the sailor aboard the ship.
The boarding-house keeper and ship
ping master were each to contribute $1
to the contingent fund.
"This fund was a necessity," said
John Cane yesterday, "for many rea
sons. Sailors sometimes change their
mind about going aboard a shiD and in
being persuaded are liable to get hurt
and it takes money to square things
if anything serious happens."
Of this blood money, say the plaintiffs
In the Justice Court suit, the ship cap
tains got no share. Under ordinary cir
cumstances the higher the blood money
the bigger the captain's "divvy," but
the Ferem ring controlled the beach
and as the skippers had to come to
some member of the combination there
was nothing to be gained by paying
any commission for the business.
FEBEM BREAKS AWAY.
The plaintiffs tell their story as fol
lows. Three months ago a score of
Bailor boarding-house keepers r.nfl ship
ping masters formed a combination
that was to be a sort of sailor trust.
Between them they expected to control
all the shipping of crews for deep water
ships and they proposed to make the
operation as expensive as possible for
the ship owner.
A suit filed recently in the Justices*
Court of this city Is a direct outcome
of this split In the hitherto fairly solid
end always secretive combination of
sailor boarding-house keepers and
shipping masters. In this suit Ferem
and others are the defendants in an
action for the recovery of $250, and at
tbe trial the plaintiffs promise to admit
the existence of a ring for the extor
tion of blood money in order to prove
that Ferem, as the head of it, not
only took the lion's share of the profits
but has frozen them out and refused
to return their contribution to the com
bination. The plaintiff is W. P. Her
man, who represents John Cane, Joseph
Cane, Timothy Hawkins and John Sa
vory, as well as himself.
STORY IS TOLD.
When British Consul Courtney Ben
nett charged John Ferem, superintend
ent of the Sailors' Home at this port,
v ith using his position for the acquire
ment of wealth through the medium of
â¢'blood money" extorted from the own
ers of British ships, the Consul is said
to have satisfied the Federal authori
ties that he had warrant full and plen
ty for making the accusation. The evi
dence is now in the hands of the State
Department, and according to advices
from Washington will be submitted to
Congress before long. Bennett had a
hard time securing testimony on ac
count of the esprit de corps which at
that time held Ferem's fellow-offenders
loyal to "Johnny at Home," as Ferem
is called by his brother traders in
pailormen. That time Is of the past,
however. The sailor traders are now
at outs and in the confusion of the
quarrel not a little additional light is
being shed on their methods of doing
business.

As the Sonoma backed into the
stream she narrowly escaped ramming
her Btern through the river steamer
T. C. Walker and "that a miss was
scored was more a matter of good luck
than careful navigation on the part of
the pilot of the Stockton boat. A strong
ebb tide was flowing and half a gale
of wind was piping 'from the south
east. Once started, the Sonoma had
to ke*>p going. Stopping or even slowing
down would have resulted in the wind
and tide carrying the heavily freighted
liner against Broadway wharf and
completely wrecking that structure.
The Walker was a whai-Ts length to
the southward when the Sonoma, with
her whistle blowing, started to back
into the stream. The Walker was
skirting the wharves considerably clos
er than the law allows. Instead cf
slowing down or turning out the river
steamer held on her course and when
her stern-wheel cleared the Sonoma's
after end there was barely a foot's
length between the vessels.

LIBELS FILED FOR
WAGES AND DAMAGES
Cargo of Lumber Levied Upon for
Detention of a Vessel at
Wharf.
In the United States District Court
yesterday Peter Layton. a colored sailor,
filed a libel against J. & W. R. Wing &
Co., to recover $868. balance alleged to
be due him on a whale cruising lay on
the bark Cape Pigeon Horn in 1891. The
bark was seized by the Russian Govern
ment in Russian waters for an alleged
Infraction of maritime law. and for that
ilfegal seizure the United States Govern
ment recovered in 1902 for the owners
$38,750 damages, out of which Layton
seeks his alleged share of $868.
In the same court George U. Hind and
others filed a libel against 100.000 feet of
lumber belonging to the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company and part of the cargo
of the* Robert R. Hind, to recover $980
as damages for fourteen days detention
and breach of charter party.
Will Return to Atlantic.
The steamships Pennsylvania, Indi
ana and Conemaugh are to be sent
back to the Atlantic. The Pennsylva
nia and Indiana came out here at the
time of the Klondike excitement. They
were chartered by the Government as
transports during the Spanish war and
since then have found more or less
regular occupation on this coast. The
Pennsylvania will probably take a
cargo it salmon from this port. The
Indiana and Conemaugh will go to
Honolulu from Puget Sound, where
they now are, and load sugar for New
York.
WHOLESALE . LIQUOR FIRM
SAYS IT WAS SWINDLED
Warrant Out for Arrest of C. Julius
Janssen on Charge of
A warrant was issued by Police Judge
Conlan yesterdav for the arrest of C.
Julius Janssen en a charge of forgery.
The complaining witness is M. Rothen
berg of Rothenberg & Co.. wholesale
liquor merchants, 423 Kearny street.
Rothenberg alleges that Janssen call
ed at his . store on Wednesday after
noon and chatted with him for a few
minutes about meeting his brother in
Eureka. He then pulled a draft for
$18 50 cut of his pocket and ask 3d
Rothenbprg to cash it, as the bank3
were closed. Rothenberg at first de
murred, but finally handed him the
coin and received the draft.
The draft was made payable In three
days after date to the Janssen Com
mission Company and was to . be
charged to the account of L. P. Jacob
son. On the back was an indorsement,
"Pay to the order of C. Julius Janssen,"
and purported to be signed "Janssen
Commission Company;" then it had
been indorsed by Janssen.
Rothenberg could not find the name
of "L. P. Jacobson" in the city di
rectory and he went to the Janssen
Company, but that firm said it knew
nothing about the draft and declined
to refund the money.
WILL DECIDE WHETHER
THE DRESS FITS OR NOT
Judge Van Nostrand Hears Suit of
DTessmaker Against Customer
Who Kefused to Pay.
The trial of the suit of Miss M.
Ostrander, a dressmaker, against Mrs.
Maude Waters, for the recovery of $66 75
balance due for a dress was begun yes
terday in Justice of the Peace Van Nos
trand's court.
The testimony developed that Mrs.
Waters refused to pay for the dress on
the ground that she was overcharged
and the dress did not fit. Miss Ostran
der declared on the stand that the dress
was a perfect fit.
"Is it not a fact." asked Mrs. Waters"
attorney, "that the dress was too wide?'
"Indeed not." replied the witness. * I
could not make it tight enough to suit
her."
There being contradictory testimony
as to the fit of the dress, it was agreed
that Mrs. Waters attire herself in the
garment and appear in court this morn
ing, when Judge Van Nostrand will use
his - artistic judgment in deciding
whether the dress Is all that it is
claimed to be.
Though the officers of the post hav*
tried to put a stop to the selling of
liquor to enlisted men at the Union
street entrance of the Presidio, tha
practice is still going on under the eyes
of the law.
The saloons are not licensed to re
tail liquor .within a certain distance of
the reservation, and police officers have
been placed at the entrances of the
various resort3. Either the officers are
paid by the proprietors or have re
ceived orders to make no arrests, for
they pay no attention to the business
being conducted behind the doors. A
strange . feature of the case Is that
when a civilian asks for a drink it is
refused him. as "the house is not
licensed to retail liquor." In these
cases the police are vigilant, but sol
diers are served with liquor with im
punity.
Private John Khlert of the Twenty
seventh Coast Artillery, who acciden
tally fell from a two-story window at
the Presidio two weeks ago, died from
the effects of his injuries Wednesday
afternoon at the General Hospital. The
funeral services will be solemnized this
afternoon In the chapel, after which
the interment will take place at the
post cemetery.

Judgment on a Bond.
United States Circuit Judge Morro-w
yesterday rendered Judgment In favor of
the United States against Ah Moon for
$4500. In 18S1 Ah Moon went into busi
ness as the Senate Cigar Company and
put up an Internal revenue bond for
$4500. Pfrter H. Hlnk beinsr the surety.
Shortly afterward Moon was arrested
for selling unstamped cigars and suit
was begun on the bond in 1882. A de
fault was entered last year, after the
case had been twenty years on the flies.
Decision Favors Orchardists.
Attorney General U. S. Webb has
rendered. an opinion to Governor Par
dee to the effect that the State Com
missioner of Horticulture has not the
authority to take possession of and de
stroy trees or vines In orchards or vine
yards which may, be affected with con
tagious or infectious diseases. The act
of 1897, the Attorney General says, pro
viding for county boards of horticul
ture and giving them authority, to
abate nuisances, applies only to trees
infested with scale Insects, codlin
moths and .other Insect pests, and has
ho reference to fruit tree diseases, and
there is, therefore, no officer in the
State authorized to destroy such dis
eased "orchards as a nuisance.

Thomas Bent, a sailor, who was tried
before a Jury in Judge Dunne's court
yesterday on a charge of assault with

advanced, but the market showed little
strength the latter part of the session. De
cember clewed unchanged at 79@79%c.

last week of 40.000- barrels, and the millers
report the domestic demand heavy but the ex
port demand light, aa the foreigners ara hold

Trade In fruits was quite active for a few
hours In the morning, but the market was
very dull during the greater part of the day.
Grapes had the most call, and although re
ceipts from all sections were liberal, prices
were well maintained and the market was
well cleaned up at the close. Offerings of the
Muscat variety in large ' open boxes were
eagerly sought by retailers, and occasional
lots of strictly fancy stock commanded a pre
mium over the quoted rates. Strawberries
and Raspberries were In light but ample sup
ply . and eold at a wide range as to quality.
Huckleberries were offering again. About 15
boxes came in from Point Arena and sales
were reported at 10c per pound. . Apples ar
rived freely from Humboldt County, and the
market was steady, although' rather quiet.
The other tree fruits were in ample supply
and prices were without quotable change..
The Citrus market was amply supplied with
all descriptions and prices stood about as pre
viously quoted. New crop Tangerines from
Oroville were offering at $1 50 per 20-lb box.
The steamer Sonoma, which sailed yesterday
for Australia and New Zealand, took out sev
eral carloads of Oranges and Lemons, which
were shipped direct from the growing dis
tricts. The Panama steamer brought up 360
cases Of Mexican Limes and 62 crates Pine
apples, which had not been marketed up to a
late hour.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Cheeee is weak at the. lower quotations al
ready noted, and supplies 'are as large as ever.
Butter remains without variation. There is
plenty here, and the demand is Just about
Eurnlcient to check any accumulation. The
situation lacks snap, howjafr.
Receipts were 27,900 lbs Butter. 025 cases
Eggs and 37.000 lbs Cheese.

45c for email and mixed colors; store, nom
inal; cold storage. 28#32 ftc; Eastern. 26<S29c
for cold storage. - .
It is anybody's market on Eggs. All sorts
of prices are quoted. It makes very little
difference as far as fresh ranch are concerned,
as there are practically none here. Stocks of
cold storage, too, are reported greatly reduced,
as drafts upon them recently have been heavy.
There was a street report yesterday that the
three great packing-houses of Swift & Co..
Armour & Co. and Cudahy, who control the
Egg market in the West, were trying to ab
sorb a controlling Interest in Eggs here as
we!l. but it could not be substantiated. The
trade eald that there were very few Eggs left
here to absorb.

A 'Prohibition - of Acceptance Ex
i . pected in a> Short\ .
Time.
Those -persons who show, eagerness
to secure foreign decorations" will be
called to a sudden halt In a very short
time by practically a. statement of
policy] on the part ; of Senators wtto.jdo
not believe in allowing Government of
ficers to accept such banbles-for alleged
services, which, in^ many instances,
have turned- out to be personal matters
of a most trivial nature. A bill has
been introduced - in the Senate by
Mr. Cockrell authorizing the accept
ance j of decorations from- the French
republic by John A. Ockerson, a mem
ber of the Mississippi River Commis
sion; Casper S. Crowninshield, commer
cial agent of the United States in Italy,
and Miss Anna Tolman Smith, trans
lator of the Bureau of -Education. No
special information has yet been re
ceived by the Senate as to the reasons
for conferring decorations on .these peo
ple, but this one bill has been sufficient
to cause a discussion of the. matter,
with the view of laying down principles
for the guidance of the Senate in all
such matters.
In the last Congress there was a de
luge of such bills. A large number of
them were passed by. the Senate, and
again by the House of Representatives
with amendments. They came back to
the Senate and by that time there
were many other bills of a similar na
ture.- Some Senators . commented on
the number of these measures as indi
cating, that 'Government' officials were
becoming- extremely ambitious .to se
cure foreign decorations. There was
much pressure on the part of Indiyidu
,eil Senators for the passage of these
bills; 5 but Senator Cullom, chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
took; the "matter In hand in a strong
way -by moving that all suelr measures
be sent back to his committee. There
they, went arid there they _ave ever
since slept in obscurity.
It 1 is likely -that the same course will
be pursued in the present Congress. It
was declared that it never contem
plated that . Congress should pass bills
for the acceptance of foreign 'decora
tions conferred for most trivial reasons.
Information has been given Senators
showing that many .of these .decora
tions have been. the result of personal
courtesy on the part of officials of the
GovernmentÂ»toward prominent foreign
ers, who," to. show their appreciation,
have gone to their governments to ask
that a decoration be conferred. In some
cases foreigners have been escorted
about this city and shown the sights
by Government officials who have been
rewarded by the proffer of. a decora
tion. The" sentiment is growing in Con
gress that mere official acts and the
personal 'service bringing Americans
Into contact with foreigners cannot be
urged as a basis for the passage of a
bill to permit them to accept these
decorations. Such applications In the
future are likely to be considered fa
vorably only In cases in which a for
eign government desires to compliment
an American official for some. notable,
achievement in science or otherwise.
Even in such cases Congress is likely
to proceed much- more slowly In the fu
ture than it has in the past. â Washing

FAVORS SAFETY STATION
ON MARKET STREET
SÂ£reet Committee Requests Board of
Works to Grant Necessary Per
mit for Improvements.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday requested the Board of Pub
lic Works to grant permission to
Charles Brown & Son and other store
keepers to erect a public safety station
at the junction of Market, Fourth, El
lis and Stockton streets. The work is
to be performed by the Board of
Works, but the expense,will be borne
by adjacent property owners. The
committee suggested that lights be
placed at each end of the station to
prevent accident by night. '
The committee recommended that
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway Company ' be granted an ex
tension of time until April 30, 1904, to
complete the steel footbridge on Nine
teenth street.
The committee adopted the assess
ment districts for grade changes on
Parnassus and Buena Vista avenues.
The committee ordered stone side
walks to be constructed on Ashbury
street south of Haight; a sewer in An
derson street, between Eugenia avenue
and Powhattan street; a sewer in
Ninth avenue near N street south, and
the grading of Eleventh avenue near
M street. -

FAIL TO FILE STATEMENT
OF ELECTION EXPENSES
Several Defeated Candidates Neglect
to Comply With the Purity
Law.
Several defeated candidates for of
fice at the last election neglected to
comply with the purity law requiring
sworn statements of their campaign
expenses. They are W. Broderick, who
ran for Auditor; W. J.- Hlnton, for
Treasurer; Maxwell McNutt, John
Stephens, Edward Gleason, for Super
visor, and W. W. Sanderson, for City
Attorney.
The law makes such neglect a mis
demeanor, but -it is. not thought" that
any action will be taken. The District
Attorney has power to bring action
against the delinquents. Their neglect
might militate against them in the fu
ture should they be elected or appoint
ed to office.
APPOINTS ATTACHES OF

The board ordered 'the immediate va
cation of premises at 19 and 21 Wash
ington alley, known as Fish alley and
belonging to George B. Keane. the

pictures of the exhibit

by the favorable comment her first ex
hibit received at the painters' and
sculptors' exhibit, appears with nine
sketches In oil of Eastern scenes. Be
tween them It would be hard to make
a choice, they are all so deserving.
Fall and springtime, with all their
varied coloring, are so beautifully de
picted that one wonders at the extent
of her art in painting roses and the des
olation of an Eastern winter.

gramme of music, which poured out
melodiously through the arches of the

attractiveness of the exhibit: The ex

the evenings of Wednesday, November

DISMISSAL OF COLLEGE
PROFESSOR IS DEMANDED
Irene D. Reeves, a teacher in the
Polytechnic High School, through her
attorney, Stephen V. Costello, filed a
suit yesterday for an Injunction re
straining the Board of Education from
carrying into effect a resolution adopt
ed Wednesday placing her on the un
assigned list without salary. She
claims that the resolution was adopted
after the discussion of false and ma
licious charges preferred against her
by Walter N. Bush, principal of the
schoql.
Irene D. Reeves has been a teacher
in the,- department almost continuously
since 18S0. She was out for a time, hav
ing been dismissed by the Board of
Education on charges preferred against
her by members of the department. At
torney Costello took her dismissal into
court, and she was restored and given
Judgment for back salary amounting
to J3000.

Scherf said Irwin had ordered him
not to pay any attention to a telephone
call from one Klnney, who said he
would inform the Poundmaster If cows
belonging to A. Marty, a milkman, got
into his fleMd. Klnney did telephone,
but Scherf paid no attention to it.
Klnney finally located Irwin and de
manded that the cows be impounded.
Scherf said he was subsequently hand
ed $5 by Marty, but he did not know
what it was for.
Former Poundmaster Fred A. Osborn
was the first witness . and he testified
that the receipts for fees during his
term were about the same in amount
as those collected by Irwin, who now
has twice the territory to cover.
The inquiry will be resumed next
Wednesday at 2 p.m.

The exhibition is one of the best that
has ever been seen in the city. AH four
Â¦walls of the gallery are studded with
productions that would grace any home.
They are hung low for the benefit of
art buyers and some of them suffer
from the glaring lights. Without any
Idea of buying, an art lover may spend
several hours viewing the display
without once becoming weary.
Most of the offerings are sketches in
oils or water colors. Two black and
white drawings of Haig Patiglan in an
obscure corner at the entrance Imme
diately attract attention. The master
piece Is an Egyptian sculptor walking
away from the Sphinx, which really
needs no title, so thoroughly is ex
pressed the wonder he feels In the
'bird's claws, the beast's body and the
iiuman face that Darwin or Huxley
rwould pause Lt the revelation. It is a
(Btory of evolution and unconscious
â¢.knowledge. Scarcely less remarkable
is a pen and ink by Patiglan, repre
senting the hooded figure of an Arab
Â¦walking past the Sphinx and deliber
ately Ignoring the smiling face which
tells him so much. Both of these
sketches are classics.
3HNTATTJRES ATTRACT NOTICE.
As one proceeds he is attracted by
ift. F. P. Piazzoni's "Pool," which was
{exhibited at the painters' and sculp
tors' exhibition, and a couple of L.
Â¦Maynard Dixoh's pictures representing
jdesert scenes. Both of these artists de
serve special mention. In the same
voice one may include Miss May Ses
einger, who has five miniatures of ex
quisite taste and coloring. The other
Â¦sketches of Plazzoni and Dixon give
â¢promise, but lack much in composition.
One of the features of the exhibit are
three portraits by Olga M. Ackerman.
'They are exquisitely shaded and have
the full Joy of living in the canvas.
Particularly effective is a face of a
woman framed . so delicately in the
shadow that eho Is startllngly real.
Whatever gods there be that reign
over high Olympus In these modern
iflays, they have been peculiarly unkind
in the weather they have dealt out for
the two latest exhibits of San Fran
cisco artists. The painters and sculp
tors of San Francisco gave an exhibi
tion last week that lasted from
.Wednesday until Saturday night. Low
ering skies and mire under foot pre
vented any appreciable attendance for
two days. Then the sun burst forth
and the courteous manager and his as
sistants had to tax all their energies
to provide for the rush.
The San . Francisco Art Association
at its annual fall exhibit Is suffering
under similar drawbacks of weather.
The display in the Searles gallery of
the Hopkins Art Institute, which was
opened last night for a private view to
patrone, did not attract the usual at
tendance. The rain deterred most of
the first nighters and deprived many
of them of picking up bargains for the
adornment of their houses.
A. Scherf testified that while deputy
poundmaster under Irwin he had been
directed by the latter not to issue the
official receipts for fees paid for the re
lease of animals, but to use a form of
receipt given him by Irwin. Scherf
produced two of such irregular receipts
for $7, the money for which Scherf said
was turned over to Irwin. Scherf said
Irwin had given books of irregular
blank receipts to all his deputies, with
In the year from May, 1902, to April,
1903, 94S unlicensed dogs were released,
the licenses upon' which woold amount
to $2370, but it could not be determined
whether licenses were taken out for
these dogs after their release. The ex
perts' recommended that a license be
taken out before an unlicensed dog be
released. The experts 'find a dis
crepancy In the statements of dead ani
mals delivered to the Reduction Works,
the Poundmaster's records showing 3324
and the records of the works 3302.
Supervisor Wilson contended that the
report of the experts cleared Irwin of
charges of misappropriation of funds
and maladministration of his office,
but the committee decided to take evi
dence on that point.
Henry Stern, president of the Pacific
Humane Society, testified .that he had
examined the Poundmaster's records
and found no record for the release of
two horses belonging to one Jensen, nor
of the release of some cows and a horse
belonging, to A. Lynch. Stern said he
found a record of $4 paid by i, Mrs.
George Maklnson for H the release of an
animal, but claimed that she had
paid $5.
Former Deptuy Poundmaster Danzt
testified that while working for Irwin
on commission he impounded nine cows
belonging to Lynch, who paid $9 for the
release, of which Danzt received, 54 50
for his commission. A horse belonging
to Lynch was released on payment of
$1, which Irwin and Danzt divided.
Two horses belonging to Jensen were
released at 53 a head, Danzt said.
RECEIPTS IRREGULAR.
MANY DOGS RELEASED.
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Finance, Police and License yesterday
resumed its investigation of the ad
ministration of Poundmaster H. O. Ir
win, with particular reference to
charges made by the Pacific Humane
Society' that ' Irwin had failed to make
return of fees collected.
Iryvln filed a demurrer to the charges
on the grounds that neither the Board
of Supervisors nor any committee
thereof has Jurisdiction of the subject
matter of the charges or over Irwin as
Poundmaster, and that the charge Is
ambiguous and unintelligible. Irwin
demanded that the charges be dis
missed, but the committee denied the
request. In : his answer to the com
plaint Irwin denies all' the charges
made by. the Pacific Humane Soclety :
and requests that its petition to be
given charge of the pound be denied.
The experts of the Finance Commit
tee filed a -report, in which they state.,
that the.bOQks kept by _ Irwin agree
with his monthly reports. The experts
ascertain that no extortionate charges
were made by. Irwin for the release of
dogs, but that in some cases animals
have been sold for less than the amount
of the charges against them. The ex
perts recommend that in order to pre
vent possible collusion between the
Poundmaster and purchaser that all
large stock at least should be appraised
before sold.
