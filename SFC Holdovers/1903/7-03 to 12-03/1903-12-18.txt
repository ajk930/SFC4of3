Naval Officer's Visit to Colombian Mil
itary Camp Near the Frontier.
COLON, Dec. 17.â The United States
cruiser Atlanta, Commander William
H. Turner, returned here last night
from the Gulf of Darien. She discov
ered, on December 15, a detachment of
Colombian troops numbering about 1500
men at Titum='i. on the western side
of tlie gulf, just north of the mouth of
the Atrato River. The commander of
the Atlanta sent ashore an officer, who
conversed with the Colombian com
mander. The latter protested energet
ically asainst the presence of Ameri
can warships in Colombian waters, as
war between Colombia and the United.
States had not been declared, and po
litely requested the Atlanta to leave
the gulf, because it belonged to Cov
lombla. Commander Turner Ignored
the request and the. Atlanta returned
to Colon to report to Rear Admiral
Coghlan. t-V.v*
The Colombians are clearly busy with
protective and strengthening measures.
Although they treated the Americans
courteously, they decidedly resented the
presence of the Atlanta's landing party.
The Colombian force was composed
partly c-f the men landed recently' at
the Atrato River by the Colombian
cruisers Cartagena and General Pin
zon. (
Early in the morning of December
15 the Atlanta sighted a small schooner
in the center of the Gulf of Darien and
followed her to | the western shore,
where the schoc-ner. attempted to hide
behind an islet. Lieutenant Harlan P.
Perrill of, the, Atlanta was ordered, to
board her and a whaleboat was low
ered and pulled toward the schooner. ;
Lieutenant Perrill's boat's crew-con
sisted of twelve men. They w'ere un
armed, excepting four revolvers. When
the whaleboat approached the schooner
fcur soldiers were seen seated., on. .the
side nearest the direction from which
the Americans came, with rifles lying"
handily across their, knees and point
ing ': toward the whaleboat. General
Novo, who is a Venezuelan by, birth
and" second. in" command of the Colom
bian 1 forces, stood upon the deck of the
schooner and insolently called, out in
broken English:- BHRpBBBHVwl

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. i 17.â The
reticence of the Foreign Office here has
increased since the dispatch of the re
ply of Russia to Japan, and the offi
cials decline to confirm or deny reports
of the character of the reply printed
abroad. The feeling in. diplomatic cir
cles is not quite so optimistic as it' has
been. It is believed the unfavorable
Impression apparently created on the
Japanese Government by the reply is
due to Russia's unwillingness to place
the settlement of the Korean and Man-
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily Tqjegraph says that according to
local mandarins the Peking Govern
ment has again warned the provincial
authorities to prepare .for immediate
hostilities owing 'to the offensive action
taken by Russia and her allies regard
ing Far Eastern affairs.
*>.'. SITUATION IS GRAVE.
â¢ TOKIO, Dec. 17.â The conference of
, the elder statesmen of Japan, including
1 ihe Marquis Ito and the Cabinet M'n
| isters, yesterday resulted, according to
a semi-official statement, in a deter
mination to present a strong front to
! Kussia in view of the Iatter's unsatis
factory reply to the Japanese proposals.
Another report says it is understood
that although the Russian reply was
considered highly unsatisfactory the
conference decided to make another
and probably last attempt to arrive at
a lrjf-ndly settlement. ;
The situation is considered grave.
Even the most sob<^r section of the
Japanese press declares it is high time
for action.
In addition to the Marquis Ito, Field
Marshal Yamagata, senior field mar
shal of the Japanese army, and former
Premier Count Matsukato, one of the
greatest financiers of modern Japan,
and twice Premier of Japan. Count
Inouye. former Japanese Embassador
to Korea, and at one time a finance

LONDON, Dec. 18.â A cable dispatch

elder statesmen of Japan indorsement
was given to the ' Government's deter
mination not to recede from the de
mands on Russia concerning the Far
East formulated on June 23, 1903. This
indicates, says the correspondent, the

LOS ANGELES, Dec. IT.â Trailed to I
their lodging place and brought to bay
Â¦within the v-allS of a small room, Jo
seph Choisser, aged 50, and Louis
Choisscr, aged 25, father and son. were
shot to death in a battle with Detec
tives Hawley, Murphy and Cowen at
10:30 o'clock to-night. The three offi
cers escaped from the close range but
short lived duel without injury- Both
of the Choissers were killed instantly.
Two telegrams were received by Chief
of Police Ellon" to-day from Equality,
Hardin County. Illinois, requesting the
arrest of Joe Choisser. One was from
YTeiderr.an BroE. & Co.. offering a re
ward of $50 for Chooser's arrest, and
the ether was from Sheriff W. T. La
mar of Hardin County, asking Chief
Ellon to look out for and arrest Chois
ser on the charge of obtaining money
bv false pretenses. There was no
charge against young Chc-isser. bo far
as known.
Detectives Hawley, Murphy and
Cowen were detailed on the case and
immediately began a search for Chois-
F?r. He was located late this after
noon ax the.Broxboro lodging house,
S23 VSTest Fifth street, where he and
his son had taken a room. The de
tectives watched the place for several
hours for Choisser. to. appear, but It
eeeir.s he had become aware of the
search for him and both he and his
son kept close to their 500m.
Shortly after 10 o'clock to-night the
detectives decided to search the lodg
ing house for the fugitives and were
directed to his room. Without the cer
emony of knocking for admittance the
detectives opened the door and walked
in. The elder Choisser was lying on
the bed and as the officers came, In he
reached for his pistol. Before he could
use the weapon Detective Hawley
w seized it ar.d wrested it from his hand.
Kvt the same moment Louis Choisser
opened fire upon the officers, which
they promptly' returned-' Joe Chois
ser was struck by a bullet from the of
ficers' pistols and killed instantly. The
fire from Louis Cnoisser's revolver be
came to hot that the officers retreated
into the hallway.
A moment later the young man threw
open the door and walked into the hall
with a revolver in each hand, firing as
he came. Aiming one of his revolvers
directly ot Detective Murphy's breast,
he fired, but missed the officer. Be
fore he could take aim for a second shot
both Murphy and Cowen fired, the two
bullets passing through the young
man'Â« breast. He died instantly.
Vfter the battle was over the officers
went intu the rocm again and found
th* elder Choisser lying dead upon the
bed. One bullet had passed through his
head and another had lodged in the
body.
When the clothing of the dead men
was searched mâ¢ w *Â» * ound on Louls
ChoiEser. Very little is known of the
men beyond the information conveyed
in the two telegrams from Equality. It
is thought they were horse traders pr
dealers in livestock.
The officers were taken by surprise
when young Choisser opened fire upon
as they, were not seeking his ar-
' They declare that they were
forced to ehcot to kill in self-defense.
The bodies were removed late to-night

CfALVESTON, Tex., Dec. 17.â A man
"claiming to be Charles Pierzon, an or
ganizer for the Socialist Labor party,
was arrested by the police to-night for
attempting to deliver an anarchist
speech in the street. He had gathered
a crowd of more than 300 persons and
was denouncing the President and the
Government and inciting a rising of the
laboring classes when the police placed
him under arrest. Judging from the
men who came to his assistance at the
police station the department believes
it has unearthed a plot of anarchists.
Several Sicilians, known to the police
as anarchists, avowed friendship for
the man, and the police have recovered
records and information which they
will not give out in detail. Rough plans
of several buildings have been found
and it Is said they are the plans of
homes of men prominent in the affairs
of the national Government, and the
executive mansion in Washington is in
cluded.
Communications wen- received from
Paterson, X. J., Chicago and New
York City, by the GalvÂ«ston anarchists
and an interpretation of one of them
appears to reveal a plot of anarchists
scattered throughout the United States,
with headquarters at Chicago. All of
the local . anarchists are being shad
owed and thÂ«> department has commu
nicated with the police departments of
Washington and New York.
- Two lists of names, with addresses of
prominent Â¦ personages, have, been
found. Pierzon refused to give any
explanation of his acts and defies the
police to prosecute him. He is a
swarthy young man, about 30 years of
age, apparently ' Well educated and
speaks Eng'isk fluently.
Galveston labor leaders have de
nounced him- as an enemy to the la
boring classes and will have nothing
to do with him. His sanity is not
questioned and he declares he Is sim
ply following his life's, ."work.

at large through the clemency of the
.pardon board. Dunlap was serving
'time for a bank robbery at Monmouth,
111., which occurred two years ago.
His criminal record extends back a
Fcore or more years.
Dunlap first came into prominence
'twenty years ago, when hÂ«Â» was sen
tenced to the penitentiary for the robr
bery of a bank at Northampton, Mass.
He was later pardoned and since that
time he has had many escapades.
Among his most daring exploits was
the robbery of the Manhattan Bank
in New York, where his booty is said
. to have amounted to nearly $1,000,
000.'

REPRESENTATIVES MAKE
PENSION APPROPRIATION
WASHINGTON. Dee. 17.â Governor
Taft has informed the War Depart
ment of the details of. his agreement
with the Vatican's representative for
the sale of the friar lands. It is In
contemplation to sell tihe lands for the
benefit of the Filipinos themselves, for
the money will go Into their own treas
ury. Payment will be ma<Je by bonds,
either turned over dirwtly to the friara
or sold by the Philippine Government
at the best price obtainable, the pro
ceeds being given to the orders. The
lands are to be sold as far as possible
; to the tenants who live upon them now
and on Ions time payments at a very
moderate rate, of interest on thÂ©. de- *
ferred payments.
The main purpose is to create the
greatest possible number of landlords
in the Philippines^ for It is believed
such a body would be a strong conserv
ator of peace and do much to discour
age further revolutionary movements.
The\ Question of the' withdrawal of
the friars has. It is said, at the War
Department, practically settled itself.
Of the government body of friars in
the islands at the outbreak of the war.
onfy 200 are said to have remained.
and nearly all. of these are at Manila.
It is not doiibted that the President
and Secretary 'Root will approve Gov
ernor Taft's arrangements, particu
larly as the people of the United States
are not to be- charged with any money
required to fcÂ«y friar lands.
ROME. Dec. 17.â Full particulars
concerning: the agreement reached be
tween Governor Taft and the friara
providing for the settlement of the
friar lands question in the Philippines
have not t*>ien received by the Vatican
authorities, only a mere announcement
that such an agreement had been
reached having been cabled from Ma
nila. Whetn the news was brought to
the Pope Jie seemed highly delighted
and exclaimed: "It is the best Christ
mas box I could have had." ' *
In all quarters Governor Taft and
Archbishop Guidi are being warmly
congratulated on their success in solv
ing the most intricate of the questions
intrusted to their diplomacy. It is de
clared that both have displayed the ut
most tact and equanimity. The excel
lent impression produced by Mr. Taft
during his sojourn in Rome in the
spring of 1902 has now been greatly in
creased, at the Vatican, the authorities
or whiicii expect that his presence in
"Washington as Secretary of "War will
greatly help the settlement of the re
maining questions in the Philippines.
Colonel Dodge Accuses Captain J. W.
I.. Phillips of Duplicating Accounts.
NEW YOJIK. Dec. 17. â Charges of
duplicating his pay accounts for the
months of October and November
were to-day preferred against Captain
John W. I. Phillips, Twenty-seventh
United States Infantry, by Colonel
Francis S. Dodge, chief paymaster of
the Department of the East. Colonel
Dodge has forwarded the papers in
the case to the paymaster general in
"Washington for further action.
Captain Phillips is on leave of ab
.sence from his regiment, which is now
stationed in the Philippines. Follow-,
ing immediately on the heels of suit
for divorce brought by the captain,
in which Mrs. Phillips brings counter 1
charges, the case has awakened unuSi
ual interest in army circles.

; WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â The Senate
to-day 'deibated.the isthmian canal ques
tion as affected by the President's rec
ognition of. the independence of the re
public of Panama. The discussion be
gan with a speech by Hoar on. his reso
lution of: inquiry^ and lasted several
hours. .In addition to Hoar's/address
there: were - speeches by Gorman and
Foraker. - . - j
Hoar confined his remarks to !his res
olution and they ware read from manu
script. He' held, that jthis country: had
not yet received full official informa
tion concerning the isthmian revolution,
and adversely criticized the conduct of
this /country, as shown .by what had
been given out. He compared the con
duct of the United States on the Isth
mian question to that of a policeman
who would manacle and hold a person
to be robbed and who would then insist
on having the spoils of the theft deliv
ered to himself.
Gorman's utterances- alleged the situ
ationjn Panama had been created to
make a campaign issue, and charged
Assistant'.; Secretary of State Loomis
with a violation of the proprieties in
discussing" >. the question at a banquet
in New, York. He also sa.id that unless
fyrther light-Svere thrown' upon the
subject 'he would oppose the Panama
treaty/ 'He referred to the action of
the executive, and declared that the
Senate should prevent the jeopardizing
of the business interests of the country.
SENATORS IX WARM DEBATE.
:. Foraker- took Hoar to task severely
for his remarks reflecting on the ad
ministration and his indiscretion in
speaking In open session concerning
executive matters. He defended the
administration for its attitude toward
the- Panama revolt, ju heated colloquy
took place between Â¦Ifaraker and Hoar,
during an effort Vy ;;t Hoar to explain
more f ully"riis\pQ6ltion in the matter.
.In addressing the Senate on his.reso
lutioii calling upon the President for
such information as may be in his pos
session relative to the status of the re
public of Panama when the treaty with
that country was negotiated, Hoar be
gan by saying that he was favorable to
the isthmian canal and desirous that
the present President of the United
States should build -the' great water-!
way.! But, anxious as he was for the
accomplishment of these ends, he was
even more anxious * that the cdnal
should , be built "without. taint or sus
picion of national dishonor." ' !
"What we want to know," he said,
"is: â¢ Did this Government, knowing
that a revolution' was about" to take
place, so arrange matters that Uia
revolution, whether peaceable or other
wise, should be permitted to go on
without interruption and whether our
national authorities took measures to
prevent Colombia stopping "it?"
Hoar said that it was no justification
of 'our course to say Colombia had
failed to ratify the treaty for the con
struction of the Panama canal.
In conclusion Hoar pleaded 1 all
the facts and, asked that they be sent
to the Senate through the usual official
channels.
GORMAN ASSAILS PRESIDENT.
Gorman took the floor as soon as
Hoar hadi concluded. He paid that
Democratic Senators generally were as
favorable to the construction of the
canal as Republicans. He congratu
lated the â¢country on the possession of
a Senator like Hoar, who, he said, was
following many examples of courage,
patriotism and disinterestedness in the
Senate. Gorman said the facts were all
that were desired, and he referred to
the extension of the .executive influ
ence, saying that this, influence had
been extended "the Senate Jiad
become practically the agent of the
executive." He criticized the selection
by the President of Commissioners
from the Senate to negotiate treaties
as a reprehensible practice, and de
clared that the Associated Press se
cured its suggestions as to informa
tion dbout events from the administra
tion. He also condemned executive
interference in State, politics.
But none of these transgressions
could be compared, he declared, to the
action of the executive in connection
with the affair in Panama. .
'"It is," he said, "the most flagrant
act of transgression that has ever
taken place in the history of the coun
try, and it should be resisted without
regard to party." .
CRITICIZES V LOOMIS' SPEECH.
Gorman adversely criticised the
speech made by Assistant Secretary of
State Loomis before the Quill Club of
New York a few nights ago. He said
that Loomis, > while excited by wine,
had "given information which the Sen
ate had not Â¦ had from the administra
tion or from any- other source.
"He. did ' not," - Gorman continued,
"tellthe country all the facts, but he
made the broad assertion ' that the
President was a bold and great man,
who" had the courage and the patriotism
to land marines and seize a part of the
territory of the republic , of [ polbmbla,
wh'ich we wereunder contract to guar
antee to that /country." This, 'In> the
light of the facts ; about us, 1 Is nothing
less, than usurpation." V
Gorman then discussed the President
as a "second Napoleon." .

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., "WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â Senator
Hoar and Mr. Scott, editor of the Port
land Oregonian, turned their backs on
one another in the Senate elevator to
day. The veteran editor from Oregon
was a guest of Senator Mitchell from
that State, and they met the sage of
Massachusetts In the elevator.
"Senator Hoar, let me present my
friend, Mr. Scott, editor of the Portland
Oregonian," said Mitchell.
"I -must decline to shake hands with
Mr. Scott," replied Hoar. "He insulted
my dear friend. Senator Morrill, some
years ago by saying that he remained
in the Senate long- after he was dead,
and refused to be buried to save funeral
expenses."
Mitchell and Scott were taken aback
by the outburst of Hoar, but Scott de
nied that he had ever insulted Morrill.
"You are the editor of the Oregonian,
and that paper did it," retorted Hoar.
"You are responsible for what appears
in the paper, are you not? I decline to
shake hands with you, sir."
Scott was now as angry as Senator
Hoar, and while there was little room
iri^the crowded elevator for him to turn
his bulky figure, he did so and retorted:
"I am responsible, and I turn my
back on you, sir."
By this time the elevator had reached
the Senate landing and Senator Hoar
made his exit.

Lieutenant Perrill explained that it
was not war, but a friendly visit. Gen
eral Novo, however, refused to give
him any information. An interpreter
who boarded the schooner learned that
she had seventy or'eighty armed men,
packed sardine-like in her hold.
â¢-The Atlanta then signaled to Li&u
tenant Perrill to return to his ship and
later.- the 'lieutenant returned to the
shore ; to vfcslt General Ortiz, the com
mander in "chief of the Colombians*.
Thjsjttlme he ? took .with, ; him a dozen
rifles^ concealed in the" bow of the
wh'aleboat, for an emergency. The
whaleboat was rowed steadily toward
the schooner, the excitement increasing
as she approached, but when Lieuten
ant Perrill went on shore-'GeTujrarOrtiz
appeared on- the beach and the excite
ment'subsided. 'Â¦ . â¢ Â¦-. â¢<-.
r General x5rtiz insisted, that Lieuten
ant-Per rill snouldihy the Colombian
flag-,at the bow -of the whaleboat, or
lower.Â«the American flag at Her stern,
because she was in Colombia a wateisj.
Lieiutenant .Perrill replied *th.-\t, he did
.nojVhave a Colombian flag and refusod
t^lower the Stars and Stripes. . Gen]
,ejral Ortiz v did not insist upon. his : so
doing;/ but he protested in , writing
against the presence j3t the Americans
lln Colombian waters. Lieutenant Per
rill accepted the protest and conveyed
it -to" Commander Turner, who handed
it to ,Rear Admiral Coghlan on his ar
rival here. ' .
' General Ortiz seemed uncertain at the
beginning : whether war .had been de
.clared. He left Cartagena on Decem
ber 2 and .some of the others declared
they had been in the gulf for a month
past conducting defensive and prepara
tory operations. The general's protest
reads. -partly as follows: . . . ,
; "Tothe captain of the Atlanta;: Dan
iel Ortiz, commandant general r of a di
vision of the Colombian army and first
adjutant , to General Reyes, protests
most energetically in the ;nam? of the
Colombian Government and all Colom
bians against the ' presence of Amer
ican warships In our waters. ,You are
citizens of ( a. powerful country, im
'mensely rich and possessing vast nurn
;bers of inhabitants.' On the contrary,
we are bankrupt and'our immense'ter
ritories are .'depopulated. Colombia, has
been bled 'by civil Avars, but
to-day_in-.the Manama* matter and re
garding yourselves, we belleva we have
right and' justice on our side. Do not
doubt it. -The god of nations will' be
on our 'side. 'Against . him squadron's
and cannon -.shall .not prevail. '. Every
man or. woman,' is capable
of rising to the heights of heroism.
VD. ORTIZ."'
General Ortiz sent another .communi
cation to. .Commander Turner asking
what .orders* the commander had from
Washington regarding the movements
of .1 Colombian warships in Colombian
waters, ; to which Commander Turner
answered, saying they would be treated
as would the vessels of any other pow
er with which the United States was
at peace.
After saying that he was satisfied
with* Commander Turner's . answer the
general said:. . . %Â¦Â¦Â£ ,..:V T . Â¦< Â¦
"I beg that}ypu-w.{h'fea\-e this port,!
because vtlr'e"^'a^r'9'surrbunding ; it r are

myself tp infortti y6u that the rebel de
partrt4ht ofc 'Par/atria' borders on Gauca'
at Tiburon. So long as war is not de
clared it seems to me only just and
natural that American warships should,
not enter the waters south of Tiburon."
Commander Turner disregarded this.
Having accomplished the purpose of,
his visit to the gulf, namely, to find the
Colombians, the Atlanta started for
Colon on the night of December 15.
"The Colombians carefully and sys :
tematically made efforts to avoid giv 1
ing any information as to what pur
poses had brought them to the gulf or
whether they were building roads to
ward the republic of Panama. But it
can be said that they are. awaiting
superior orders. In the meantime there
are strong probabilities that they are
building a road toward Panama. The
distance separating Tltumatl and Ya
viza is sixty miles.
The Colombians declared they had
2000 men between the mouth of the
Atrato and Tiburon well supplied with
food, clothing and ammunition. They
have also several pieces of ' artillery
mounted advantageously at coast
points. T.heir demeanor, though polite,
clearly showed hostility and deep cha
grin at having been discovered. Many
indications pointed to their intention
of bringing more men and supplies to
the gulf.

.polepn to shape its destinies and' to

'., proper functions ?"
Here Aldrich asked Gorman whether
it was , the "purpose or the recoricen
trated Democracy to defeat the treaty."
CHALLENGES A STATEMENT.
After some parley Gorman exclaimed:
"I say to the Senator from Rhode
Island that if the case stands as it is
now, with only the information the ad
ministration has furnished us to this
hour, then we regard it as a most ob
jectionable transaction. . And let me
say . to ! the Senator, when you talk
about responsibility, we can take the
responsibility and say to the adminis
tration without regard to party: 'Con
gress has directed you to do one of
t\v6- things,-- to construct the canal and
do it -.without delay; when you cannot
get it at Panama go to Nicaragua and
construct; it there and do it at once.'
Yet Mr.; Loomis in his speech has the
audacity to say the reason why they
did not go to Nicaragua and attempted
no negotiations with Costa Riea. or
Nicaragua,, as â¢.provided by the Spooner
act/ was because'" eminent- engineers
have said^Nicaragjia was not the prop
er route/; for the": construction Â°' the
: Â¦SThat[-staternent I challenge. It
cannot verified: But one member of
the committee!; expressed a doubt as to
the feasibility, of the Nicaragua route.
: "1 1 do not desire to do the President
of the -United 'States .any injustice. I
respect the. office. ,.,1 believe that who
ever oqcupies 'it ought to have fair con
sideration.' But' the executive must
have a respect for Congress and a spe
cial consideration for the Senate of the
United States when it comes to the
confirmation of treaties, for he cannot
make one without its consent. When
the attempt to "deprive us of all the
facts is made I resent it. And it is
not the first instance of such action
and of dictating to Congress. I resent
it and fi have resented it at the cost
of estranging some of my political as
sociates in the past when we had a
Democratic President of the United
States. I accord President 'Roosevelt
the same treatment."
FORAKER ARRAIGNS HOAR.
When Gorman had concluded, For
aker began^ a severe arraignment of
Hoar's position, saying that when he
read the newspaper accounts of the
Democratic caucus, which agreed that
caucus should be binding, he knew that
there, would be trouble; that the Demo
crats would vote as a unit on every
matter except when the vote interfered
with individual conscience. Foraker
said he had felt no great surprise when
the attack on the President had been
made on the Democratic side of the
chamber, but that he had been shocked
when the Senator from Massachusetts
made the character of speech he did
and that the country would be equally
surprised. He said Hear's speech
should have been made in executive
session, if at all. ' Â¦
Foraker declared that an attack had
been made, nottm the President alone,,
but on the country and .that at a time!
when the eyes of the world were upon;
us.
"I have no doubt," said Foraker,
"that the President acted with the.'
loftiest of motives and the highest ofc
ideals when he took the action he did';
in reference to the republic of Pan-;
ama," -, . . , . . , . .
Foraker 3aid he could think of no ac~
tion on the part of the President calling
for such remarks as those made by
Senator Hoar. Hoar,' interrupting,;
said: - . . - . ' .
t'The Senator from Ohio either wholly
misunderstands what I said or willfully
perverts my meaning." .
.HOAR MAKES EXPLANATION.
After a little further 'debate Hoar
obtained the floor.
"My Doint is this," said Hoar. *'I
say that the President has said to the
public and to the Senate that he dis
claims certain conduct as unworthy of
him and Ij called attention to the fact
that the documents which he s*ent in
failed to make that clear by not dis
tinctly disclaiming that he or the ad
ministration had notice of that revolu,
tlon or that our forces had prevented
the lawful Government from anticipat
ing that outbreak; that I believed 'from
my knowledge of the President that
his statement was actually true, and
therefore I asked him to supply the
lacking information by stating on"
what ground the administration pro
ceeded in taking the step. That, is all.
And I do not propose, after thirty-four
years of servico within these walls, to
trouble myself to contradict again an
imputation to me of any other meaning
of Indirectness or artifice on my part.
If the ' Senator from Ohio chooses to
charge me with it, of course I cannot
help it. He will do his duty."
"I am delighted," retorted Foraker,
"that the Senator from Massachusetts
is not afraid of anybody. I do not
know Of any reason .why he should be
afraid of anybody. He made a speech.
I. am undertaking to make some an
swer to it.
"Now, the President has said there
was no conference, "ho intrigue. And
yet the Senator from Massachusetts
demands that* the President shall sub
mit proof to him that he was telling the
truth when he made the statement
that he had not connived." â¢
COLLOQUY IS RESUMED.
Foraker then proceeded to review
briefly the history of the rising on the
isthmus, saying that the happenings
there were common '- knowledge to all
newspaper readers and to all persons
who had observed the fate of the canal
treaty in the Colombian Congress and
had any knowledge of human nature.
Foraker said: "- '{. >. .::Â¦ â¢
"No agent was sent to the President
and no agent was. sent to Panama,
which had a right to go into rebellion.
Weeks before she declared her inde
pendence it became known unofficially
that she would take the step."
The administration at Washington,
he said! was not unmindful of the sit-,
uation, - "and the President took the
steps indicated by the telegrams and
from which Senator Hoar derives such
conclusions." Â¦
Hoar was on his feet again and in
terrupted: â¢
'.VI distinctly said that I had no criti
cism to make on that score. I not only
disclaimed what the Senator Imputes to
me, ;, but made what was the strongest
argument I could think of,; to show all
concerned there was no criticism what
ever proposed."
"I am glad the Senator, has. reconsid
ered: and" concluded "to Interrupt me

PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 17.â As the re
sult of the fire which visited the lower
portion of the business section of the
city at midnight, three Chinese are
known to have lost their lives and
damage to the amount of at least $42,
0C0 was done.
Portions of the burned buildings were
occupied by Chinese opium smokers,
who in tha excitement and fright
caused by the fire and not comprehend
ing the danger fought desperately with
the firemen who dragged them from the
burning structures. Over fifty Chinese
were saved thus.
The police and Fire Department offi
cials express the belief that further
search will reveal the fact that there
were several more victims of the
flames.
The fire originated in a Chinese res
taurant and spread with great rapidity
through the structure, finally attacking
the buildings on either side. A joss
house with its expensive furniture was
among the Chinese losses by the fire.

The Everett police are investigating
his sanity and In the meantime com
municating with the Milwaukee police,
as Fredericks tells exactly where he
lived end worked.
TACOMA, Dec. 17.â A weird story is
told by Ernest Fredericks, who applied
for lodging at the Everett police sta
tion last night. He claims to have been
a prisoner on board a strange ship for
the past three years and that he was
put ashore at Everett. He says the
last thing he remembers about his
home in Milwaukee is that he â¢was
walking along the street one evening
In September, 1900. The next thing he
remembers he was on board ship. How
long after leaving Milwaukee this was
done he does not know. He thinks he
was shanghaied.
Ever since that time, Fredericks says,
he has been a prisoner on board some
strange steamer. He claims that he
was kept below deck and waited on of
ficers who sr>oke English. The mem
bers of the crew were all Chinese. He
could never learn the name of the ship
or the business she was engaged in.
Once or twice he saw the shores of
strange lands. On one occasion he
heard big guns fired over his head, but
could not learn what the trouble was.
Fart of the time the steamer was in
tropical seas and part of the time in
the cold zone.
Four days ago. Fredericks says, he
was transferred to a small ship. The
exchange was made at night near some
shore. He was kept a prisoner on the
second craft until he was landed from
a rowboat on the shore near Everett.

Charles Jump, who alleged that his
two children, Letha and Elmor, were
being restrained "by Mrs. Klllonberger
of 1773 Chase street in this city on
account of a $100 note he owed her,
gained possession of his offsprings
through a writ of habeas corpus this
afternoon. Judge Ellsworth in making
hfs decision said to Mrs. Klllonberyrer:
"This man may owe you the money,
madam, but such a thing as holding
human flesh and. blood for a debt is
monstrous and something the law does
not recognize. There is only one thing
for me to do, and that is to give the
children to their father, who is legally
entitled" to them."
In defense of her position Mrs. Kll
ienberger said to the Judge: "This
man came to me a stranger, three years
ago. . His wife had deserted him and
out the two children on the stage in
Seattle. He agreed to pay me ?10 a
mbnth for taking care of them. He has
borrowed $100, for which I hold his
note, besides which he owes me about
$50 more. The girl, he told me, should
never leave me and IJiave been paying
forvpiano lessons for her out of my
own pocket."
Mrs. Mabel Jump, the motlnr of the
children, sat in the rear of the court
room while the discussion went on be
fore the Judge. She is not Jump's .wife,
as he got a divorce from her oh the
ground of desertion about two years
ago. He said, however, that they were
to be married over again and in the
meantime he was trying to get his
children.
After the decision Mrs. KiUenberger
kissed the two children, to whom she
had been as a -mother, and left the
courtroom.
The charity entertainment cf the Cal
ifornia Liquor Dealers' Association at
the Grand Opera-house last night was
a pronounced success. Every seat in
the large theater was -occupied and
standing room was at a premium. A
large amount was netted for charity
and a merry Christmas Is assured for
many crippled and poor children, this
by the thoughtfulness of the associa
tion.
The benefit was the result of a de
termination made last year on the part
of the retail liquor dealers to dispense
with the distribution of what has been
commonly known as Christmas bottles
and respond to the call of charity. Each
year much money has been expended
by the liquor men in supplying these
packages for their patrons, and the
custom came to be abused as well as
the occasion of many difficulties. Last
year a few of the liquor dealers met
and decided on a plan in its stead.
They collected an amount of money
equal to the cost of their Christmas
gifts and donated it to the charitable
institutions of the city, giving particu
lar attention to those that sheltered
homeless and crippled children.
A few- months ago the movement be
came unanimous among the dealers and
it was decided to give a charity enter
tainment and to distribute tickets, pur
chased by themselves, instead of bot
tles among thefr patrons. The com
mittee in Charge of the affair consisted
of A. G. Hagedorn, chairman; William
Clack, secretary; D. B. Faktor, treas
urer; E. L., Wagner, P. J. Weniger, T.

In this morning's issue the Standard

fiance alike of the authority of j the
crown, the Cabinet and the Legislature.
It declares that the members of. the
commission are mostly wealthy protec

entitled to sit on a really strong royal
commission.

the Bethlehem steel plant.
Untermeyer asked what reason there
was that Schwab, owning no Beth
lehem stock at the time, should receive
530,000,000 in shipbuilding bonds . and
stock at the time of its settlement, to
â¢which Steele replied that it was in con
sideration for the risk Schwab -as
sumed in making the contract for the
purchase of Bethlehem stock, which
was immediately assigned to Morgan
& Co.
Steele said the purchase of the Beth
lehem plant was made in order that
the steel corporation might be able to
control the disposal of the Bethlehem
plant, its permanent ownership being
considered disadvantageous to the
steel corporation, and the desire being
to resell it to owners favorable to the
Fteel company, though no special pur
chaser was in view at this time. He
professed ignorance of the competi
tive or non-competitive status of the
Bethlehem and armor plants,
the latter of which was owned by the
steel syndicate.
ACCEITED SCHWAB'S FIGURES.
Steele testified that he accepted
Schwab s opinion of the value of the
plant and taken the contract for the
purchase of the stock at the price
Schwab had agreed to pay the original
owners, the understanding being that
Schwab should share any profits at the
resale of the plant.
Steele said that at the time he con
sidered the shipyard proposition a good
one and its stock a good investment,
expecting the common stock to earn
dividends from the start, and for that
reason he believed that the jrt,000,000 in
stock embraced in the purchase price
was an adequate return for the interest
and profits on the Morgan investment
of $7,246,000 for the year. Schwab had
not told him that these securities would
pive him control of the shipbuilding
company. Morgan & Co. had received
the 53,000,000 in stock, part of the pur
chase price, the stock being assigned in
blank.
Coming 1o the Harrip, Gates & Co.
agreement, which provided for the sale
of the Morgan and Schwab stock before
all other shipbuilding stock, .Steele said
that he knew of it at the time, having
seen a copy of it and discussed it with
Charles Gates of Harris, Gates & Co.,
but not with Schwab.
MORGAN'S STOCK INCLUDED.
Steele had previously been informed
by some party to the agreement (he
could not remember whether it was
Schwab or Pam) that th^re was an ar
rangement for the sale of the Schwab
stock, and had declined to have the
Morgan stock included. Subsequently
Gates left with him a copy of the
agreement, covering both the Morgan
and Schwab stock, to which Steele, aft
er consulting Perkins, had informally
aeceOd. His firm, he said, was not a
formal party to the agreement: had not
signed it and had not taken advantage
of it. The $5,000,000 in stock, he said,
had remained in the Morgan vaults
until soJd to Schwab. He hadjiot
thought of the agreement after his con
\ ersation with Gates until mention was
made. of it during the pending suit. The
agreement, he thought, was in the
nature of an offer to 'include the Mor
gan stock in the early sale, if the firm
so desired., not a hard and fast con
tract" that the stock must be sold first.
Steele made an explantion cf the
statement issued- by Morgan & Co. at
the time when mention was first made
of this agreement in the suit, the state
ment denying that Morgan & Co. were
â¢â¢parties" to any such agreement.
Charles Gates replied at the time, in
sisting that there was an, agreement
for the sale of the Morgan stock and
Eteele paid tribute ' to Gates' "good
faith" in issuing his statement.
Both Brandies of City Council Pass
Bill Providing for Expenditure ,

PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 17. â Mayor
Weaver to-day returned to the City
Council without his approval the loan
bill appropriating 516,000,000 for mu
nicipal improvements. Both branches
of the Council promptly passed the bill
over the veto.
The Mayor, in his veto message, said
that, while he would approve a large
number of items in the bill, he thought
that separate ordinances should be
drawn for each item, so that the vot
ers could pass upon each and not be
compelled to vote on the entire $16,

NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â Andrew Car
negie and John D. P/tckefeller, it is
eald on good authority. ha>ve come to
a definite agreement as to the future
of the United States Steel Corporation,
otherwise the steel trust.
The agreement eliminates J. Pierpont
Morgan and all of his directors from
the corporation and provides for a rad
ical reorganization of the personnel, by
vhich all of the merger offices would
be filled by Carnegie-Rockefeller men.
It is also agreed that there shall be a
further reduction of expenses.
The date agreed upon for the many
sweeping changes planned is not
known, but they undoubtedly will be
effected as soon as possible, probably
goon after January 1. It is said that
Rockefeller recently secured an enor
mous block of steel trust stock and
appealed to Carnegie to aid him in a
complete reorganization of the great
corporation.
At the time of the formation of the
trust Rockefeller put into it as his
share the Lake Superior iron mines on
a large valuation. Carnegie insisted on
having first mortgage bonds for the
Carnegie works, thereby retaining for
himself the whip hand in the affairs
'of the trust.

NEW YORK, Dec. 17,â After fleeing
with her Chinese Bweetl\eart across the
continent to escape the wrath of her
parents. Miss Roberta Lang of San
Francisco to-night married Lum Tan
Tse in Chinatown. A long string of red
lanterns glowed in front of the wedding
place and when the news reached the
Chinese Theater the cymbals clanged
loudly and drowned the noise of the
many who left their seats and went
over to congratulate the bride.
According to the story that was told
in Chinatown, Lum was playing in the
Chinese Theater in San Francisco, af
ter making a hit with Chinatown audi
ences in thir city. Miss Lang, withÂ«a
party of friends, went slumming and
with her was a young business man,
whom she expected to marry. The par
ty asked to be shown tfchind the scenes.
There she met Lum.
Miss Lang then became a Sunday
pchool teacher and Lum joined her
class. The Chinese actor was invited
to visit the girl at her home, but he was,
not well received by the girl's parents
and they eloped. They reached China
town to-day and arrangements were
made for a clergyman to wed them. The
details of the marriage were carefully
guarded by the bridegroom's friends,
for fear of police interference. '
E. H. Sehade, driver of a beer wagoiv,
was arrested late last night and his
name placed on the detinue book. He
is suspected of having started twq flres
in the neighborhood of Post and Lar
kin streets and of attempting to start
a third. He was seen" by' several per
sons at the time the fires broke out
and the police will hold, him till an in
vestigation is made.
The first blaze started in a house on
Post street court, off Post 1 street, be
tween Hyde and Larkin. It was ex
tinguished without the aid of the en- j
glnes. Upon investigation a large bun
dle of rags partly burned was found in
the basement, which led to the belief
that an incendiary had been at work.
Several persons saw Sehade in the
vicinity at the time.
Soon after fire broke out in the two
story frame dwelling occupied by L.
Glennon at 11 Meecttam place, a small
alley near Post street court. Before
the engines reached the scene of the
fire the flames had gutted the entire
building and caused considerable dam
age. Glennon and his family were not j
at home when the fire started and
many persons who were near the scene
say that Sehade was hanging about the
place before the blaze' was discovered.
Soon after Mrs. Abids. landlady of
the Aubrey apartment house, 962 Post
street, discovered Sehade In the attic
of the place, striking matches. She told
him to leave at once and as he was
passing through the hall he saw several
women guests'. He made a rush for
Mrs. Roger Cornell, wife of the Olym
pic Club athlete, and tried to seize her.
; Patrolman Langdon was summoned and
after hearing the story of several by
standers who had seen Sehade in the
neighborhood where the fires started,
locked the latter up pending, an investl-
I gation.
When searched at the City Prison a
I large sum of money was found on
Sehade, but nothing of an 'incendiary
character. He denies all the accusa
, tions, but is unable to give a satisfac
tory explanation of how he got into the
attic of the Aubrey Hotel.

Clarence E. Stillman, son of New

that name and nephew, of the Rocke
fellers, whose marriage to a nurse
several weeks ago in Maine caused
considerable gossip in society on the
Atlantic seaboard and was reported to
have been the main reason for the
young man coming West to seek a fu
ture home, has entered the employ
ment Of E. H. Harriman.
â¢It was reported some time ago that
Stillman Sr., somewhat displeased
with his son's matrimonial alliance,
was nevertheless determined to as
sist him and with that purpose in
view had telegraphed in advance of
his son's coming to E. H. Harriman,
who was then here, asking the rail
road magnate to provide a place for
the young man in the offices of the
Southern Pacific Company. The mat
ter was placed in the hands of Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt, who has
found a position for Stillman. in the
office of A. B. Worthlngton, recently
promoted to assistant to the general
manager. Worthington is regarded as
the best statistician in the employ of
the Harriman lines and a young man
who secures a place in his office* is
deemed very fortunate. Employment
there Is regarded as the stepping stone
to something higher in the railroad
world. Stillman, who is residing at
the Palace with his young bride, has
already had some experience in rail
road work, he having been previously
in the employ of James J. Hill of the
Great Northern, to which road he
went after leaving Harvard College.

POINT RICHMOND. Dec. 17.â A new
ferry is to be established which will
carry passengers and freight between
San Francisco and Point Richmond by
means of a line of small packet steam
ers, which will be operated by a com
pany incorporated under the name of '
the Glen Cove Transportation Com
pany of San Francisco. The 'course of
the new line will be around Point
Potrero and up the channel called Rich
mond Creek, -which will make the dis
tance to San Francisco about eight
miles. The promoters of the new sys
tem claim that they can cover this dis
tance in thirty minutes.
The company's wharf will be con
structed at the foot of Richmond ave
nue, opposite the new Santa Fe passen
ger depot. The channel. out to the bay,
which is now a shallow and tortuous
slough about two miles in length, will
be straightened and dredged to a depth
of eleven feet, lessening the distance
nearly one-half. The marsh land
through which the channel runs is the
property of the Tewksbury estate, of
which William Mintzer is manager, and
the land adjoining is owned by the
Nicholl company. The owners of both
these tracts of land confirm the story
of the new enterprise, in which they
have taken stock, and they are anxious"
to make It successful in the hope that
Congress may later make the channel
available for vessels of greater draught.
An hourly service to San. Francisco
will be welcomed by the 5000 inhabit
ants of Point Richmond, who are now
forced to depend upon the four trips
daily of the Santa Fe boat.

Fire department officials have un
covered what they consider evidence of
serious Import touching upon a mys
terious fire which occurred Sunday
night in a cottage at 1002 East Thirtieth
street, owned by Mrs. Kate L. Mer
rick and rented a short tim-? before the
fire by Miss Minnie L. Crane. Insur
ance for $900 was carried on furniture
supposed to be in the cottage. Fire
Warden George McDonald declares that
the house was vacant, except for a
trunkful of clothes, a cot and some
garments that hung on a line in tha
yards.
Further than that, McDonald as
serts that after the fire Mi.Â»s Crane
notified E. D. Judd, an Alamr da broker,
that the loss was total on her house
hold effects covered by that $D0o policy.
"Our investigations have disclosed a
very peculiar state of affairs, to say
the least," said Fire Warden McDon
ald to-day. "We have found that MI33
Crane had a policy or $900 on furniture
stored in San Francisco on December
10. Three days before the fire the
policy was transferred to cover furni
ture In the East Thirtieth sireet cot
tage. Then follows the mysterious
fires, three of them, breaking out si
multaneously In three different rooms
in the house. There was nothing in
side but the trunk and cot, and we
have not grot a trace yet of Miss Crane.
She has not come forward to claim
any of the damaged efrects in the
trunk. ,
"In that receptacle we found business?
cards and other papers Indicating that
Miss Crane and her mother had resided
In Stockton. To-day the fire depart
ment received a letter from Stockton
signed by M. A. Smith and charging
that last summer the Cranes obtained
$1000 insurance in that city for a mys
terious fire loss in a cottage they rent
ed, but only furnished with a couple
of trunks."
Warden McDonald has submitted the
matter to the Board of Insurance Un
derwriters.

There was an important political
gathering at the White Hou3e table
this afternoon, when the President en
tertained Secretary Root, Secretary
Cortelyou, Senator Lodge and former
Governor Crane. This luncheon may
be taken as a further confirmation of
the intention of the President to have
Crane for his campaign manager next
year.
The President depends very largely
on the political advice . of Senator
Lodge, Secretary Root and Secretary
Cortelyou, and it Is announced that,
although Secretary Root is to retire
from the Cabinet in January, he will
by no -means retire from the position
he has held ever since Mr. Roosevelt
entered public ljfe, of being an adviser
of the President. This was intimated
very strongly to-day and means that
the financial world, in any effort to
defeat Mr. Roosevelt, will not fiave
the support of Root, on which it 'has
been dbunting.
Governor Odell and Senator Platt
will have a conference to-morrow. The

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
JC. W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 17.â There
was a political a3 well as a social side
to the Cabinet dinner given by the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt to-night.
Senator Hanna was not present.
There were politicians in large num
bers at the table, however, and if the
chairman of the National Committee
could not attend, at least there was
present the possible future chairman
of the committee/ who will conduct the
campaign in 1S04. in the person of for
mer Governor Crane of Massachusetts.
Three States were represented by
their Governors or Governors-electâ
â Massachusetts, New York arid Ohio.
It is understood among politicians
here that while the Cabinet dinner was
ostensibly a purely social function,
with the wives of noted politicians also
as guests, the purpose of the President
was to draw together leading Repub
licans to discuss New York State and
national politics.
Governor Odell of. New York arrived
late this afternoon and was driven to
the White House, the guest of the
President. Senator Platt and the Gov
ernor soon had a long talk at the Ar
lington Hotel, and when it was over
both said it had been very satisfactory
and the Governor went back to the
White House.

story was dramatic in the extreme
and held' a larce crowd in the court
room.
While his wife was in the St. Helena
Sanatorium the doctor filed suit for a
divorce on the ground of desertion. The
papers were served on her and she did
not offer any battle in court. On the
contrary, she tried her best to save her
husband and believed" that if "at the
end of six months she was chastened"
he would remarry her. Judge Hebbard
granted Anthony a divorce on July 16,
1902, because the wife made no appear

On April 29.' 1903. the wife brought
suit to have the decree of divorce an

"that during the time said suit /or di

restrained of her liberty by said de
fendant and was held in confinement
by said defendant and was by said de
fendant prevented from obtaining
counsel and from making any defense
of the said suit for divorce."
She further j alleged that she was
given drugs while an inmate of the St.

improper conduct, and that the said
admissions were false, t .

that he had seen Dr. Anthony and his
wife, on the street during the pending
of the suit for divorce. This proof was
offered to show that Mrs. Anthony had
not deserted her husband. Mr. Stanton
said he knew of the divorce proceedings
and evinced surprise at seeing the hus
band and wife together. He said the
doctor became excited and told Stan
ton and the lady he was accompanying
that he would explain all some other
time. Both Stanton and the lady with
him were somewhat horrified at the
doctor's peculiar actions.
Dr. R. A. Buchanan was called as a
witness to tell of Mrs. Anthony's stay
in the branch of the St. Helena Sana
torium at 1436 Market street. He was
unable to give any relevant testimony
and was allowed to depart.
MRS. ANTHONY ON STAND.
. Mrs. Anthony, bsfpre her marriage
was a Mirs Weasels. She is a native of
South Africa and comes of one of the
leading families of that distant coun
try. She Is a cousin of President
Steyn, the great Boer leader, and one
of her uncles represented the Boer3 at
the .peace conference. It appears that
she met Dr. Anthony when he was a
missionary in South Africa. She fell in
love with him and used her influence
and money 'to elevate him. She took
him to Battle Creek, Mich., and he en
tered a preparatory school for the
study of medicine. Having completed
his studies he came to this city and
entered the Cooper Medical College
and upon graduating he was able,, by
the assistance of his wife, to take a
post-graduate course at Ann -Arbor,
Mich. Subsequently he went .to Africa
and was given charge of a big sanato
rium owned by the relatives of his wife.
About this time the Boer troubles be
gan and Dr. Anthony became mixed up
in them. He was charged with nigh
treason by the British Government and
came within an ace of being shot. It
was through the efforts of the woman
he is alleged to have wronged that he
secured his release.
Dr. Anthony came to . this country
and joined his wife and two children,
who had come to tKIs "city. "Dr. ' Â¦Â¦Â¦An-:
ithony is alleged to have begun his
cruel treatment of his wife while they
were living. at 813 Oak street. He ac
cused her of having acted "in an un
ladylike, manner" while coming 'to this
country. He ' accused her of kissing
men and being found in their apart
ments, all of wiiich she denies. -
FILES SUIT FOR DIVORCE.
It will be shown by Attorney Grant
Carpenter, who represents the unfortu
nate wife, that as soon as Dr. Anthony
secured a divorce from her he jour
neyed-to Yuma, Ariz., and married a
woman who had nursed the first wife.
The story of the husband's alleged
cruelty and the facts leading up to
their marriage have been told before,
but will be read again with interest.
COMES OF RICH FAMILY.
If credence can- be placed in the tes
timony givf n by Mrs. Christina J. An
thony in support of her plea to have a
decree of divorce secured by her hus
band, Dr. Richard S. Anthony, set
aside, the latter has . been extremely
cruel. to his spouse. 'The story of her
sufferings, unfolded by the woman, is
a sad one. , .
;Mr?.. Anthony accuses her husband
of sending her to a sanatorium and
keeping her 'under drugs In order that
he might secure a separation from her.
She charged that he wanted to send her
to an' insane asylum and nearly accom
plished his' purpose. She accuses him
of having compelled her to confess that
she had been guilty of acts of infidelity,
of which she was entirely innocent.
Throughout the giving of this sensa
tional" testimony the husband laughed
and seemed to enjoy it.

Robertson, who is known as one of
the most daring backwoodsmen in this
section of Montana, tracked Clifford on
a trail leading to Idaho Jjfter other of
ficers had given up the hunt.
Yesterday morning at 1 o'clock Rob
ertson crept up to a cabin on a ranch
far in the mountains and surprised the
outlaw in bed. Before Clifford; was ful
ly awake the Sheriff had him covered
with a revolver and handcuffed. The
officer tied the prisoner's legs together
and then got into bed with the desper
ado and slept beside him until morn
ing.
The Clifford-Ryan gang of rustlers
was one of the most notorious in Mon
tana and was composed of four men, all
of whom have now been captured by of
ficers.

Calmly Sleeps at the Side of
His Handcuffed Prisoner
TUCSON, Ariz.. Dec. 17.â Johnny
James, charged with the murder of
Tom Mlllis in Brewery Gulch, at Bis
bee, and Ricardo Sandoval. a highway
man and smuggler, both members of
the band of Tombstone jail-beakers,
are again behind the bars. Ranger Kel
ly reached Tombstone late to-night
having James in charge, and Sandoval
is in safety in the Mexican jail at
Naco, Sonora, just across the line,
where he was captured by rurales this
afternoon. James was captured late
yesterday afternoon by a rancher
named Boiner, who has a place in.
Ramsey Canyon, on the east slope .of
the Huachuca Mountains, twenty-five
miles southwest of Tombstone.
James and Sailor Brown had sepa
rated from the rest of the outlaws
Tuesday night and were traveling to
gether in the San Pedro Valley when
first seen. Deputy Sheriffs Page and
Shepherd, who were riding in advance
of the rest of the posse, saw the des
peradoes ahead and ordered them to
halt, not recognizing them but believ
ing them to be some of the escaped
prisoners. James and Brown paid no
attention to their orders, but made for
the undergrowth along the river, while
the deputy sheriffs opened fire.
According to James' story he did not
pee Brown again, as they became sepa
rated at this time. James, to avoid the
posse, turned up Ramsey Canyon and
made for the Huachuca Mountains.
Boiner had been seen by some of the
posse and warned to keep a lookout
for the outlaws. As soon as he saw
James he at once suspected him to be
one of the desperadoes. Boiner wore
a six-shooter and belt of cartridges,
and although some distance from the j
man in the stream ordered him to
throw up his hands. James was armed
v.ith a six-shooter, which he had se
cured at a prospector's tent, the owner
of which was absent, according to his
story, and when commanded to halt
ho opened fire and made for cover at
ih*- same time, but his feet were numb
from the cold water, the only cartridges
ho had were in his pun and after an
exchange of shots without effect he sur
rendered to Boiner, who took him to his
ranch in the canyon, tied him up over
night and turned him over to Ranger
Kelly, w'yo stopped in the morning to
learn whether any of the escaped pris
oners had passed that way.
Deputy Sheriff Templeton, returning
from Naco, reported to-night that five
Jail-breakers had crossed the line and
were surrounded in the San Jose Moun
tains, in Sonora, by a posse of rurales.
They are armed and will not be taken
without a fight.
The jailbreakers cornered in the
mountains are well fitted. This even-
Ing they raided a ranch acrcts the line
and secured rifles and ammunition.
They are camped around a fpring and
etrongly intrenched, but arc; supplied
with only few provisions "cured at
the ranch which they raided. The party
of rurales which has surrounded them
cumbers six and a messenger has bsen
to Naco asking for assistance from
both Naco and Magdalena, as a fight
cannot be avoided.

HELENA^ Mont., Dec. 17.â In the
trial of Isaac Gravelle, charged with
dynamiting the property of the North
ern Pacific Railway Company, it de
veloped to-day that the plot against the
railroad was hatched in the Deer Lodge
penitentiary years ago. An ex-convict
named Murphy testified that Gravelle,
who was then in the penitentiary, told
him that he and others had a scheme
for getting money from the railroad.
Most of the day was spent in taking
expert testimony in the hope of prov
ing that six of the threatening letters
received by the railroad company had
been written in the penitentiary and
smuggled out of the prison by Gravelle
when he was discharged last July. A
tablet was introduced in evidence and
the State counsel said he would prove
that Gravelle had borrowed the tablet
from a schoolgirl, for the purpose of
writing the letter. The tablet paper
was the same as that on which four
threatening letters were written.
Luther Mills, postmaster at Cascade,
was put on the stand during the after
noon session and he identified Gravelle
cs the man who came to the Cascade
postorliee on the evening of October 7
List and got several sheets of paper and
some envelopes. The paper had the
manufacturers brand. The witness
identified the threatening letter eont
the Great Northern. It and the en
vejope were the same style. he had sold
Gravelle. The paper found in the Â«"Â»at
of GraveJle after he was arrested. Siiila
said, was of the same sort he had sold
to the defendant.

"I can't tell.- 1 don't remember."
"When my little girls were~'taken
from me," Mrs. Anthony continued,
."my-; life was gone." I felt they were
taking a part of iny body from me. At
Continuing her testimony, the wit
ness said: "He said I was found in thfe
Auditorium , Hotel, Chicago, with a
gentleman. He said that wa3 sufficient
evidence for him to get a divorce from
me. His accusations horrified me. He
spoke about his children and said they
were his, and I was not fit to bring
them up, and he used words that I
don't care to repeat. He told me in a
letter that I was Insane. He accused
me of certain acts and tried hard to
"make me confess."
"Don't.you know how you were taken
to the St. Helena Sanatorium?" she
was asked. *
â¢ "I was told I was taken there in a
closed carriage," was her reply. :
>. "How "long were you there?"
not introduced, in evidence, but it wa3
shown that it came from a Miss Botha
in South Africa.
I Mrs.. Anthony told of her nervous
condition over her husband's impris
onment and said the suffering she un
derwent during the time he was in the
hands of the British undermined her
health and made her very weak. She
said the doctor's accusations affected
her very greatly and broke her up en
tirely. He told her, she testified, that
he had evidence which he secured in
Washington that she had "gone com
pletely to the dogs." She accused her
husband of forcing her back on a
lounge and hurting her back, and of
other cruel acts.
In order to prove that the husband
was in communication with his wife at
the time he was trying to secure a di
vorce from her on the ground of deser
tion, Attorney Carpenter read a sensa
tional letter in which Anthony accused
his wife of infidelity and tried to make
her confess that he was rlgbt in his
accusation. . Â¦ ' .
FORCED TO CONFESS.
"I told him that I was a faithful and
upright wife and was fit to take care
of my children. We lived together as
husband iand wife during the period
that my husband filed suit for divorce,
and when the decree was given by the
court I visited the newspaper offices at
my husband's request in order. to stop
the publication of stories that v/ould
hurt him."
Mrs. Anthony told of the. treatment
she received while living with her hus
band at 84 Webster street." She claims
that her husband treated her 'cruelly
and . at ' one - time told their daughter
Llllie that she was a bad woman. The
witness .' said she . appealed to her
daughter to disbelieve what her father
had said, and she was dragged from
the room by the doctor and tossed on
the bed; that the doctor sat on, her and
that a man who was staying at the
house as the doctor's guest tried- to
hold her feet, and she kicked him.
Further testimony in the case will be
taken next Tuesday. .
times I felt like rebelling against the
doctor because of his unjust charges,
but I was too weak. He would some
times be nice to me, arid at other times
very cruel. He would promise that If
he got the divorce and I was chaste
and good he would remarry me. When
he took me away from the house on
one occasion I objected, and he told me
if I did not stop my talk he would call
a policeman and have 'me locked up in
an insane asylum. My greatest fear
was that the doctor would send
me to an insane asylum. I wrote let
ters at his dictation confessing to acts
of impropriety. He brought letters to
me when I was in the St. Helena Sana
torium and forced me to write five and
six of them to Mr. Carpenter and to
other people. I was weak, and the
strain told on me. He promised me a
good home -if -I would obey him, and
said if I did not I would never see my
children again.

."My attorney has advised me to ab
stain from . talking about my case to
any one.'!, he said to a Call reporter;
"but I .do not mind stating that every
cent of the money I am accused of
taking was spent on the race track. No
womart got a dollar of it. I never
owned a race horse, and I never played
faro bank in San Francisco or any
where else."
"Do you intend to make a defense in
the courts?" he was asked.
"What do you think I hired an at
torney for?" was the counter query.
Inquiry throughout Berkeley and
Oakland failed to find substantiation of
the tales of riotous living told about
j McKowen. He was- a model of bache
lor propriety in Berkeley, where Mrs.
Grundy keeps a sharp eye on the un
married attaches of the college, and
beyond occasionally imbibing rather
freely of whisky .highballs at the Athe
nian Club he had done nothing in Oak
land that could incite the censure of
moralists. â¢
The board of regents will hold a spe
cial meeting at 2 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon in the Hopkins Art Institute,
when the McKowen episode is likely to
receive exhaustive consideration.
There was filed with the Recorder of
Alameda County yesterday afternoon
a deed conveying all of William Albert
McKowen's real and personal property
to. the University of California, and the
document bore the name of Attorney
C." A. Snook as. witness. This seeming
act of restitution does not actually
amount to much, for the available
earthly belongings of McKowen consist
of three lots of Berkeley realty and
some personal effects of Inconsiderable
value. â¢

RESCUES GIRL;
LOSES HIS LIFE
within the keeping of the Regents
themselves. Nearly $300,000 was raised
by taxation for the support of the uni
versity last year and the Regents drew
on the Controller for the lump sum
and it was turned over to their treas
urer, I. W. Hellman Jr. The university,
through the j Regents, receives ' heavy
sums, from many other sources, but
neither the Controller nor the State
Board^ of Examiners has a check on it.
An exception occurred when, for the
first time in many years, the Legis
lature at its last session included its
appropriation of $200,000 for the. uni
versity in the general appropriation act,
thus making its expenditure subject to
the provisions ofM that act, which in
clude auditing;" powers by the State
Board of Examiners. But flat appro
priations for the university made by
the Legislature as well as funds re
ceived from other sources are handled
by the Regents without . reference to
the Controller or examiners.
"As to specific examples of McKow
en's methods of accomplishing his
thefts I am not prepared to cite many.
One of the ways he stole memey was
to take it from the Lev! -Strauss schol
arship funds. McKowen also took
money turned over to him by Dr.
d'Ancpna for fees received from stu
dents in the Medical College. We are
not as yet advised ' whether the $1200
check from Mrs. Hearst which Mc-
Kowen gave to Bookmaker Davis was
intended for her scholarships fund or
for the anthropological department,
but that is, of course, non-essential at
this time.
"Preliminary investigations into the
condition of McKowen's books develop
that he was behind considerably in his
journal. That book was not up todate,
and this points to laxity and appar
ently to the theory that McKowen an
ticipated trouble. Specific accusations
will r.ot be filed against McKowen un
til after the finance committee has re
ceived a report from the expert who is
working on the books. Several days, at
least, must elapse before the records
have all been examined and their con
dition noted.
"Revelations concerning McKowen's
habits were a complete surprise to me.
I knew nothing abooit his gambling at
the racetracks or anywhere else. I
never suspected that he was thus en
gaged. The worst I ever heard in con
nection with McKowen was that he
drank at times."
"I .do not desire at this time to dis
cuss the subject whether I have hith
erto made any recommendations con
cerning any changes in- the system of
bookkeeping in the secretary's office.
It goes without saying that the sys
tem should be made a safe one. In'the
line of improvement it has been sug
gested that the treasurer might be
made a more active office of the Board
of Regents. At present the treasurer's
office is merely a depository for funds.
It has also been suggested that the ac
counts of the University of California
should pass through the hands of the
State Board of Examiners, but I am
not we.ll enough informed on that sub
ject to give an opinion.
"At the bottom of this trouble lays
the fact that McKowen had not been
compelled to bank the funds he re
ceived. If that had been required of
him this situation would not have been
reached. If there had been a bank bal
ance as a guide it would at least have
been very much more difficult for Mc-
Kowen to misappropriate the money
that came Into his hands.
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.
State Controller Colgan said to-night
that it was formerly the practice of
the Regents to keep much of, their
funds in the State treasury, but a Su
preme Court decision gave it entirely
CONTROLLERS OPINION.
Asked with reference to the state
ment of president Wheeler that the
system of bookkeeping practiced by the 1
Regents was obsolete, the Governor
said he was no bookkeeper, but it was
net improbable that the system was
out of date. He added that no matter
how perfect a system of bookkeeping
liiay be in any largo business, thero \u
necessarily some one man who in the
end must bÂ« trusted. He could see no
objection to supervision over the ac
counts of the university and of all oth
er State commissions and interests by
the State Board of Examiners. It could
not be expected that the Regents them
selves could give the time to the actual
work of overseeing the details of the
finances, a3 nil the Regents are men
of large affaiir and successful in the
management of their business interests.
It was a fact, he added, that the bus
iest man made the best Regent, for he
was able to grasp quickly and dispose
of big affairs. Governor Pardee said
he considered this a case calling for
the vigorous prosecution of the guilty.
He said the Regents would meet in San
Francisco on Saturday next and would
then take up the subject of McKowen's
defalcations.
which are annually received and ex
pended by the Regents of the State
University and their executive officers.
The constitution and laws of the State
place 'the Regents in full control of the
funds, and they in turn must trust to
the honor and ability of those whom
they employ \o do the detailed clerical
and executive work.
Governor Pardee, who is president of
the Board of Regents, to-night explained
the financial system of the university
and remarked ,it was not improbable
that the method of bookkeeping was
out of date. The Governor said, the
university is exempted almost entirely
from the provisions of the general law
requiring demands on State funds to go
through the State Board of Examiners.
The procedure is for the Board of Re
gents to make a demand on the State
Controller for the money raised by tax
ation for the support of the university.
This money is then deposited with the
treasurer of the Board of Regents and
warrants axe drawn on it by the Re
gents and are paid by the treasurer
of the Regents.
OBSOLETE BOOKKEEPING.
' SACRAMENTO, Dec.' 17.â The checks
placed on the expenditure of State
funds by the. State Controller and the
State Board of Examiners do not apply
to the hundreds of thousands of dollars
THE GOVERNOR TALKS.
That proper, vigilance has not been
exercised, in caring for "some of -the
financial interests of the State Univer
sity is shown 'in the litigation over a
claim of the Regents against the estate
of the late William C. Turner, a
wealthy pipneer of Merce'd County.
Turner died in 1894 and the_Regents
brought suit of foreclosure of mort
gage for $50,000 against Turner's es
tate. The matter dragged through the
courts and many appeals were taken
by both sides to the suit.
The Supreme Court finally decided
against the Regents of the university
on (he ground that a copy of the mort
gage had not been appended -to certain
of the legal court documents, and the.
attorney - for the Regents had also
failed to mention the book and pages
of the State records wherein the mort
gage had been duly recorded.
The Supreme Court said that the
claim was a good "unsecured" one, but
not a good "secured" one. The over
sight of the attorney for the Regents
resulted in the non-recc^very of the
funds loaned.
Later on an attempt was made to re
open, the case on the ground that the
Judge of the Superior Court who ren
dered a decision in the case was dis
qualified from hearing the cause on the
ground that he was a creditor of Tur
ner's estate and that he had appointed
the administrator who had rejected
the claim of the Regents. The subse
quent litigation, however, brought no
relief to the Regents of the University.
Â¦ A. Bonnheim of Sacramento, who en
dowed the Bonnheim scholarships at
the State University, said last night
there was no truth; in the report that
he sent checks- to. the holders, of the
scholarships because he distrusted Mc-
Kowen. ..
"I have'alw.ays sent the checks direct
to the, holders; of^ the scholarships,"
said ;Mi; Bonnheim* "I have,, known
McKoWen.^but did, not; suspect him. In
fact, I heard of, nothing derogatory to
his character until I read the accounts
in the newspapers, two days ago." .
RegentJ~Britton was in Sacramento
yesterday and visited Governor Pardee^
He said he had inquired into the Bonn
heim scholarships matter and found
that it was", straight so far as Mc-
Kowen was concerned.
ANOTHER CASE.

HIM DAMAGES
TEN DAYS MAY ELAPSE-BEFORE EXACT AMOUNT OF McKOWEN'S
SHORJIkGf; IS KNOWN BY REGENTS OF STATE UNIVERSITY
THE SAN FRANCISCO ,CALL; FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18. 1903.
' ' MRS. DIEVES DENTES.
Mrs. Lillian Di3ves '-ridow), whose
name was bandied ,wjth .that of Mc-
Kowen during- the earlier development
of the sensation, denied most emphati
cally yesterday that i her relationship
â¢with the embezzler had ever
beyond that' of casual friendship. She
had met him at the racetrack, Â«he ac
knowledged, but had never gone there
with him. ;; .. .
"It is not true," said Mrs. Dieves.
"that Mr. McKowen ever expended
large gums of .m/Â»neyup<?n me 'or that
he ever presented me with expensive
Jawelry. Indeed it -was Just tfie**>Uier
way. I gave him most of the jewelry he
wore. When I learned, that-, he was
keeping company with*other women- I
dropped his acquaintanceship. It istrpe
that we dined together several times,
but -our meals 'wereVvery- modest Â»nfl'
Then there was a widespread, report
that McKowen had maintained in lux
urious Ptyle a private domestic estab
lishment, but this, too, fell to pieces be
fore the process of investigation.
Among: the- rumors" that banished
ennui from lhe college town was one
to the effect that McKowen had once
owned a racing stable of his own, and
investigation of the story led to the
ruthless reduction of a bunch of bang
tail flyers to one single ca'i7-lagv? horse
of thÂ»* dobbin breed.' whrchthe secretary
had purchased and kept for the conve
nience of his landlady, Mrs. Smythe.
Another narrative that was probed
and found wanting, increased the sum
total of McKowen's pilferings to 175,000.
This bit of Munrhausehism was traced
to the imagination <tf a would-be wise
acre remotely connected with thesecre
tary's offlee.
"What effect has the exposure of Mc-
Kowen's peculations had upon the busi
ness affairs of the university?" Mr.
Henderson was asked.. .
"Well." he replied^ "the finance com
mittee has decided to suspend payment
at all bills except tor .labor until the
full amount of the -defalcation* is as
certained. ThÂ«> refunding of students*
deposits has been discontinued for a
few days, but the general liusinss of the
university will go oh as usual.? â¢
Baseless rumors disturbed the scho
lastic calm of Berkeley all of yester
day. They' flew thick and fast . and
their flight was not impeded by, facts,
for the informatio'n bureau at the uni
versity had very few of the, latter arti
cles to dispense. President ' Wheeler
spent the day on' this, side of the bay.
and if Acting Secretary Hendorson had
any original -intelligence . on hand he
was very chary in its promulgation.
He said that everything was in the.
hands of the two experts' tolling ..so
strenuously over the secretary' e-books,
and that they could not get a reliable
line on the actual condition ofrafCiirs
until they have probed an^iK&ed a'few
da>-6 longer. . , .;,'Â»' V 1.
RUMOR IS INDUSTRIOUS.
NICE QUESTION. ;
This bond business was the subject
of a conference yesterday, between
Rc-ent Foster. Attorney Snook and.the
manager of the Pacific Surety Com
pany, and it is understood that no
definite conclusion was ' arrived at.
Some attorneys maintain that,, the
surety company can be held responsi
ble for whatever defalcations .were
made by McKowen while he was s=erv
ing as acting secretaryâ another ques
tion which must depend for solution
upon the report of the bookkeeping ex
perts.
Indeed upon completion of the task
undertaken by fhe bookkeeping experts
depends almost everything connected
with the great embezzlement. Until It
Is positively known' how much money
McKowen pilfered and how Tie man
aged to pilfer it the hands of the Re
gents and the tongues of their finance
committee are tied.
Auditor J. J. Herr, who for several
years has annually inspected Mc-
Ko wen's accounts and approved them,
will arrive to-day from . LoV Aqgeles,
but it is expected that he, too. -must
be in the ranks of the bewildered until
the secretary's methods of cwindlirtg
are more fully disclosed. Sir. Herr'evf
dently approved all the accounts that
he found correct, but that is net paying
that all the accounts Jn McKowen's
hands were Fubmitted trt him or that
all the moneys received in the secre
tary's office were duly recorded -in the
secretary's bonks. Which again reflects
slipshodneFS upon the general super
visorial system pursued by the business
management of the big university.
Among yesterday's developments was
one to the effect that McKowen ivas
n<* under bond when his wrongdoing
came to light. He was acting secre
tary of the Board .of Regents until last
July, and in that- capacity was under
a S5000 bond, furnished by the Pacific
Surety Company, for the faithful dts
charg* of his duties. But with July
there camÂ« to him promotion to the
full secretaryship and the bond was
not renewed to cover-.his new. title and
responsibilities. So as secretary he was
ivlthout bond, a fact which does not
detract from the supervisorial negli
gence herein V* ore -altyded to. Â¦ Â»
This delicate distinction between rob
bing the person or the. public may ob
trude itself when McKowen's defehse
is attempted by. his legal advisers.. To
one of his sympathetic visitors yester
day the prisoner declared that he in
tends to offer no defense; but will plead
jruilty as charged and taKe his pun
ishment without murmur. But that
Â¦was prior to his interview with Attor
ney H. M. Wrisht of this city, who is
associated with Attorney Peter F.
Dunne in the case.
In this connection it may not be amiss
to state that no complaint has been
formally filed against McKowen, and
that Attorney C. E. Snook, represent
ing the Board of University Regents,
says no such Ptqps will be taken until
the report of the bookkeeping experts
has been received and acted upon. 'At
torney Wright, on the oth?r hand, gave
assurance that pending completion of
the inquiry no effort will be made by
him to obtain McKo wen's;, release
through habeas corpus proceedmgs.
McKowen himself is evidently content
to stay in durance until he appears in
court.
Ijr apart from the Btc:a appropriation
for maintenance of the universiti'. But
if he used the general fund to make
good hi? obligations to the student win
ners of the scholarships, then lie sure'"
embezzled money subscribed /by the
taxpayers and ivas guilty of pilfering
public funds.

ALFRED DREYFUS, WHOSE
-TRIUMPH OVER Â£ ARMY
STAFF IS COMPLETE.
It "was plainly indicated to the Minis
ter that the explanation sent by the
Porte was far from satisfactory, and
that if it had been presented in the
hope of tempering the vigorous policy
already begun by the State Department
to obtain reparation and apology the
hope was a vain one. Although the
visit frcm an official standpoint was
anything but satisfactory, the Minister
was received with cordiality personally,
as he is thoroughly persona grata to
the- State Department officials.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Dec. 17. â The
American Vice Consul to Alexandretta
telegraphs that Attarian. the natural
ized Amr-rican whose arrest caused
Consul Davis to leave Alexandretta. has
declined the transportation tendered
h'irn by the authorities until the latter
refund him th* money, amounting to
$2500. seized at the time of his arrest.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â Further ad
vices from Minister Leishman, at Con
stantinople, to the State* Department
Fhow that he has made an energetic
protest to the Porte against the action
of the Turkish officials at Alexandretta.
Irishman's last cablegram further sus
tairs Consul Davis in his action, and
the State Department, consequently, is
not disposed to regard favorably any
complaints from the Porte against his
defense of naturalized American clti-
When Chekib Bey. the Turkish Minis
ter, called at the State Department this
afternoon with a telegram from the
Sublime Porte to the effect that Consul
Davis had treated the police in a rough
'iay he was politely informed that his
explanation did not agree with the facts
as the State Department had learr.ed
them.
MITCHELLS AGENT.
The indictment against William M.
The indictment against former State
Senator Lowe charges him with alleged
conspiracy to bribe a United States
Senator. Two counts, each of $500. are
named in the bill. It is charged that
these amounts were paid to Lowe by
Postmaster John C. Mitchell in consid
eration cf Lowe's indorsement of
Mitchell's candidacy to Senator Dei
trich for the appointment of Postmas
ter at Alma.
General Colby was indicted for al
leged embezzlement for amounts ag
gregating $3000 of Government funds
paid to him in trust by the State of
Nebraska and others for equipment be
longing to the United States army.
Postmaster J. C. Mitchell is indicted
for conspiracy to defraud the Govern
ment by the sale outside of his post
office of large quantities of postage
stamps in order to increase the receipts
of the office at Alma, and thus succeed
ed in raising the classification of the
office and securing an increase of sal
ary.
The indictments against Senator
Dietrich and State Senator Lowe are
in addition to those returned against
them a week ago.
Senator Dietrich is charged with the
alleged violation of section 3739 of the
Revised Statues, which provides that
no member or delegate to Congress
shall "directly or indirecUy, himself or
by any other person in trust for him or
for his use or benefit or on his account,
undertake, execute, hold or enjoy in
whole or in part, any contract or agree
ment made or entered into on behalf of
the United 'states, by any officer or
person authorized to make contracts
on behalf of the United States."
The indictment charges that Senator
Dietrich leased to the Government on
April 24. 1901, a building at Hastings,
Xebr., to be used for a postofflce, at an
annual rental of $1300. There is one
count, which covers the amount re
ceived for rental on the building from
the date of its lease to the Government
up to the present time, equal to a sum
Flightly in excess of $2000.
t TWO COUNTS AGAINST LOWE.
OMAHA, Nebr., Dec. 17.â The United
States Grand Jury to-day made its re
port to the court, returning nineteen
true bills. They include indictments
against United States Senator Charles
H. Dietrich, for alleged illegal leasing
of a building to the Government to be
used as a postofllce; former Adjutant
General Leonard W. Colby, for the al
leged embezzlement of Government
funds; Daniel Gair.es of Bassett, Nebr.,
for alleged perjury in swearing falsely
to homestead entries; former State
Senator Elliott Lowe, for alleged con
spiracy to bribe a United States Sena
tor; Postmaster John C. Mitchell of
Alma, charging- him with the illegal
sale of postage stamps; William M. Ir
win, on a charge of acting as agent for
Mitchell, and against R. M. Allen, pres
ident of the Standard Cattle Company,
for the alleged illegal fencing of Gov
ernment lands.
The other indictments were similar
to that against Allen, but do not in
volve extensive tracts of land.
VIOLATES SECTION' 3739.
This admission caused excitement
and General Counsel M. D. Grover of
the Northern Pacific and Great North
ern took the stand to explain the sit
uation.
W r aterhouse â I mean they will not
take it at the same rate. They would
not make the same through rate to a
tramp sailing ship or tramp steamer
that arrived in the harbor of Seattle
or Tacoma that they would to the regu
lar lines.
Chairman Knappâ The Northern Pa
cific has an arrangement with you
under which it will not carry any hemp
except that you bring it over in your
steamers?
Chairman Kr.appâ Why not?
Waterhouse â Because they have a
contract with our line which prohibits
them from taking it.
Chairman Knappâ You don't mean
quite that, do you?
Waterhouseâ Yes, sir; I mean that.
v Docs it not come to this, then,"
asked Chairman Knapp, "that you
want the Northern Pacific road to car
ry hemp from Seattle to St. Faul for
37Â»i cents when it is brought over by
your steamers, but if brought over on
a tramp. steamer you want the railrcad
to charge twice as much as its propor
tion?"
Waterhouseâ If brought over on a
tramp steamer they won't take it.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission to-day
gave a hearing on its proposed require
ment that after January 1, 1904, the
tariffs in export and import traffic be
published and filed with .the commis
sion, the same as domestic tariffs. .
During the session an admission was
made by. Frank Waterhouse, represent
ative from the Boston Steamship Com
pany of Seattle, of a discriminating
contract between that company and
the Northern Pacific Company. Wa
terhouse was discussing the 75-cent
through rate on hemp from Manila tQ
St. Paul, equally divided between the
water line and the railroad. - Â¦

some of its denizens to an exhibition of suppressed and
undesirable traits.
It seems almost a criminal waste of time and a use
less expenditure of the money of'the State to send to the
penitentiary the two boys, aged 17 years and 15 years
respectively, who were captured the other day while
plying their trade as highwaymen on the water front.
They certainly know now as much as they would learn
in San Quentin, and a post-graduate course in crime for
them would be as if painting the lily.
Remarkable Blind Man.
That the loss of one sense uuickens
the activity of others Is shown by the
story of George Hebble, a blind mu

When seen at his home Mr. Hebble
told a Plttsburg Gazette correspondent
how his remarkable gift of recollection
was developed. "I never could under

just as easy to remember things as to
remember where things are. For in

that It Is in a certain pigeonhole or

me that it should be just as easy to re
member a thing as to remember where
that thing is. That is the whole secret
of a good memory.

SENATOR BAILEY of Texas is a picturesque fig
ure in the Senate. He is rich, learned and im
pulsive. The latter quality led him to make an
attack %n Senator Beveridgeof Indiana in a moment
of exaltation that did not advance him in the scale of
statesmanship nor in the esteem of his colleagues. He
is a debater of the high horse variety, and when he takes
the floor the welkin stuffs its ears with cotton and waits
till the clouds of-sound roll by.
The other day he took the floor against Cuban recip
rocity and ripped it up, back and front, leaving it looking
like a bee tree that has been split- to get at the honey.
When he finished the bill passed the Senate by the
votes of such Democratic Senators as Blackburn, Mc-
Crcary, Cockrell, Stone, Bacon, Clay and many others.

published in his several; journals.

World's Fair Notes.
Work Is progressing rapidly on Bra
zil's pavilion at the World's Fair. It
will be one of the largest and finest
foreign Govarnment buildings. It will
cost $130,000.
In the reproduction of Jerusalem at
the World's Fair already more than
200 distinct buildings have been erected.
The site covers twelve acres and all
buildings will be ready for use when
the Exposition opens April 30.
The installation of the sculpture on
the Palace of Electricity^.t the World'3
Fair has brought out all of the archi
tectural beauty of that mammoth
structure, and it will be universally ad
mired by the World's Fair visitors.
The builders at the World's Fair are
now concentrating their efforts on the
Pike. Several of the largest conces
sions are already constructed and
scores of others are being built in rec
ord breaking time. The Pike has been
paved Its entire length with .vitrified
brick.
With December at the World'* Fair
began the Installation of exhibits.
Nearly all of the great exhibit palaces
are finished and have been turned over
to the exhibits departments. Only the
Mines, Manufactures and Forestry,
Fish and Game buildings are incom
plete, and January 1 will see these last
three finished. The work of installation
will reach its height In February.
How "Bughouse" Was Born.
"Did you ever know the origin of the
word 'bughouse'?" said Tom Ernst, a
prominent member of the Musicians'
Union, to some friends. "Well, a few
years ago I was playing clarionet in
the orchestra of Â» theater in
Oakland. We had a little old German
playing viola, who loved only his instru
ment and himself. He was altogether
too quiet to suit the drummer, who was
always up to something, from tying
some one's instrument up and hanging
It In the flies, to nailing a plug hat to
the wall â which he once .did because
the cornet player had the temerity to
wear it.
"It was the season for the big brown
electric light bugs, as they are called,
and the chance to do something to the
viola player was not to be lost to Mr.
Drummer. He gathered a dozen or two
of the big beetles, and before the musi
cians arrived one evening squeezed them
through the sound-holes into the viola.
Nothing happened until the leader
dropped his baton for the first note of
the overture, and then â whang! went
the bugs as the bow struck the strings.
The little German If not 'bughouse' was
not far off. He nearly fell off his seat,
and on partly recovering composure be
gan swearing loudly In German. When
the overture ended the only explana
tion that could be obtained for his er
ratic conduct was, 'You take me and
my fiddle for bughouse, hey? r "
'A' Unique Symbol
President John H. Finley of the Col
lege of the City of New York writes
Interestingly in the Christmas issue of
Harper's "Weekly about the amusing
conflict which has gone on in Cuba be
tween the old, aristocratic traditions
Inherited from Spain and the newly
adopted principles erf democracy. One
significant Incident which is recalled
by Dr. Finley is particularly diverting.
He had cone to the cathedral at Ha
vana to be present at a special service
and was watching the procession of
acolytes, priests and Bishops &s it left
the altar. In the rear walked the Arch
bishop, In purple vestments, conversing
with the President, clad in the plain
garments of America's official habit.
"But it was the leader cf the proces
sion," writes Dr. Finley, "whose office
attracted my attention. ' A tall, pale
faced young priest was bearing, sol
emnly and with important air, a great
silver salver, and on It â not some ven
erated ecclesiastical symbol, not thÂ«
gilded emblem of kingly majesty and
prerogative, nor even the martial in
signia of a vi eroy, but the plain, un
adorned, somewhat ruffled, tall, black
silk hat of the President of the repub

glove and his)' where the padding
slopes sharply in toward the wrist on
the outer (or left) side of the left hand.
Catching his glove at this point, push
his hand and arm far to the left. Do
this as the weight of his body rests on
the ball of his left foot (as it will in de
livering the blow). His balance will be
thrown forward and will, for the in
stant, depend on one point â the ball of
the left foot. His left arm will also be
rigid. Therefore, the sharp twist to
the left imparted to his arm by your
cross-parry will send his whole body
spinning around to the right (to' your
left), the ball of his left foot serving as
a pivot.
He will, before he can recover him
self, face clear over to your left, leav
ing his left side exposed.
Then you can either land on the left
side of his Jaw or on his heart or kid
neys with_ your right, or else you can
(if you are quick enough) plant right
and left hand blows on him before he
can get back into position.
As you will readily see, -it is neces
sary to try the cross-parry during the
fraction of a second while the other
man's weight is on his left foot and
while his left arm Is far extended. To
do this it is sometimes well to step
back Just far enough to be out of his
reach, before his blow has advanced to
its full length, for the cross-parry must
be applied while its victim's arm is ex
tended.
There was once a sailor named George
La Blanche who left the sea for the
prize-ring. He was not one of the great
est fighters the world has ever seen. But
he invented and â¢ put into practice a
blow which made him famous and
which still goes by his name. This blow
has since been ruled out and is not per
mitted in public boxing matches or
fights. I do not know why, for it re
quires speed, skill and strength, and I
can see nothing unfair about it. I shall
teach it to you now. You will not be
allowed to use it in a "formal" bout,
but it is a good thing to know and will
come in very handy if ever you are
called on to defend yourself in earnest.
La Blanche was In a fight some years
ago and was not faring particularly
well. His adversary rushed him. La
Blanche whirled suddenly about. Be
fore half 'the spectators could take in
the significance of what had occurred
there was a prostrate, unconscious
man lying in a heap on the canvas
floor, while George La Blanche stood
calmly awaiting the referee's decision.
Now, this is what La Blanche had
done: As his adversary led for his face
with the left La - Blanche whirled about
to the right, using the ball of the left
foot as a pivot, lifting his right foot
slightly from the ground and throwing
enough impetus into the revolution to
bring him clear around in a complete
circle. As he whirled he' threw out his
right arm, extending it to full length
and holding it as rigid as an Iron bar.
Around he came, and as his body
whirled past the place toward which
his antagonist was rushing La
Blanche's right fist caught him on the
side of the head. That is all there was
to that fight.
In practicing with your sparring part
ner let him keep his right arm raised
alongside his head to catch the blow.
The moment you hit him, on complet
ing the pivot, bring the right foot to
the ground and brace yourself or the
impact may topple you over. Even
should your fist miss him some part
of your forearm will land on the side
of his head or face and the effect will
be not unlike that produced by a blo.w
from a baseball bat.
If you merely wish to avoid his rush
and do not want to counter on him,
pivot on your right foot instead of on
your left. That will take you out of
his reach. Let me warn you again to
be careful how you employ this pivot
blow in a friendly bout.

The last blow we shall tako up to
day was invented by "Kid" McCoy and
used by him in knocking out Steve
O'Donnell, three years ago.
Swing for your opponent's face with
your left. If you land, or-if he blocks
the blow, try again until he draws back
and the swing goes past his face. Now,
bring back the hand toward the left

Jourtiey. This return must be very
rapia, and the body must turn slightly
at the same time in order to give
strength to the blow, which would
otherwise be merely a slap.
Let the left go past his face, remem
ber, and then bring it back, landing it
against the left side of . his jaw, the
arm being bent and the Impetus sup
plied by the shoulder. and body. It Is
not difficult and can be used to great

Collia P. Huntington, world leader in
railroad finance, a genius for organiza
tion and a controlling factor for many
years in the great Wall street game,
was called to time once and so com
pletely floored by a humble employe of
the Southern Pacific Company that the
story is one of the sacred traditions
In local railroad annals.
During one of Huntington's visits to
the coast some time before his death a
clerk from the general auditor's office
was sent to the president with a busi
ness message. Blank, the clerk, had no
trouble in reaching Huntington's quar
ters, but upon entering found the great
financier stretched out on a lounge,
sound asleep. Blank figured that It
would' not do to arouse the slumbering
magnate, so he waited. An hour elapsed
before Huntington awakened.
"Young man, how long have you been
waiting?" demanded Huntington, after
Blank stated his errand.
"An hour, Mr. Huntington," was the
reply.
"Well, sir; why didn't you wake me.
sir?" asked the multi-millionaire. "The
Southern Pacific Company cannot af
ford to have you waste an hour of your
time. Suppose every one of the 25,000
men on the payrolls wasted an hour a
day, where would we land?"
"I had thought of that," responded
Blank, "but I concluded that if the
Southern Pacific Company could afford
to lose an hour of your time at the sal
ary you are getting, Mr. Huntington,
it could stand my wait until you had
finished your nap." â¢
SINCE the policy of reserving large tracts as naÂ»
tional parks for scenic purposes was adopted by
the Government there has been little or no consid
eration of the economic side of the matter. The parks
are administered by regular soldiers, an officer being
considered as superintendent, and the parks have been
protected against grazing, and to a degree from fire.
There has come to pass now the need of some adjust
ment of the rights of private owners of lands, acquired
long -before the reservations were made, and who are
deprived of all beneficial use of their property, and the
adjustment also ci certain rights founded in public
needs.
The first park reservation made in this State was the
one known as the Yosemite National Park, which saddles
the Sierra, taking in an enormous tract, and in that part
of it lying between the Merced and Tuolumne rivers -in
cluding more .private property than it does public do
main. When this reservation .was made it was delimited
by the map and not by inspection. For, this reason much
territory was included that has no scenic value whatever.
This is especially true of the portion mentioned between
the two rivers, which no one was ever known to visit
for enjoyment of the scenery.
Within the reservation are hydraulic powers, on the
streams, and an enormous water supply present in nat
ural reservoirs, and possible by creating artificial reser
voirs to hold the great fall of storm waters without im
pairing the normal flow of the streams throughout the
year. The Secretary of the Interior is clothed with dis
cretionary power to grant privileges in the Yosemite,
Sequoia and General Grant national parks, in this State,
"for electrical plants, 'poles and lines for the generation
and distribution of electrical power, and for telephone
and telegraph purposes, and for canals, ditches, pipes and
pipe lines, flumes, tunnels or other water conduits, and
for water plants, dams and reservoirs, used to promote
irrigation, or mining or quarrying, or the supplying of
water for domestic, public or any other beneficial uses,"
provided that such permit shall not be incompatible with
the public interest. The Secretary of the Interior is un
derstood to decline, in all cases, to exercise this discre
tion, on the ground that such economic uses will impair
scenery and enhance the cost of administration of the
parks, and on the further ground that the use of such
privileges will be profitable to those who make the
necessary investments.
As far as the matter of cost is concerned the parks
arc patrolled by soldiers of the regular army, and the
cost is only their pay and subsistence, which would be
the same if they were stewed in barracks instead of hav
ing the freedom of the mountains. No doubt Congress
in bestowing the discretion upon the;' Secretary had in
view the fact that these reservations included certain
great economic resources, the use of which is necessary
to the life of the people, as, for instance, electrical power
and potable water, and that permission to use meant
their profitable use to somebody. If a 'pole line or a
water ditch impair natural scenery, its impairment by a
passable road is much greater. Yet roads must be made
to enable people to get in sight of the scenery, which
otherwise will remain like the moonshine or sunshine in
"Mazeppa" â "in lonely luster."
No doubt the Secretary intends to make it plain that
a re-examination of these hastily made reservations is
necessary, in order to reform their lines and conform
them at once to the preservation of natural scenery and
the use of economic resources where there is no scenery
to impair. It is a vital question to so many people in
this State that it is quite necessary that our members of
Congress address themselves to a speedy solution.
THE NATIONAL PARKS. *
Secretary McKowen, the thieving official of the Uni
versity of California, squandered his stolen thousands

who have trusted employes in this neighborhood have
yet to expert their books.
Mummies as Fuel.
BY MALCOL.M McDOW'EUU
(Author of "shop Talks on the Wonders of the
Crafts.")
<Copj"ri6ht, 1908, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Some of the old boys who saw en
gineering service when they were dig
ging the Suez canal are wondering
If the firemen on the Panama cut will
use embalmed fuel. They remember
that in Egypt Tihen they were scoop
ing out the sand to make an island of
Africa coal was a scarce commodity
at times, and the steam raisers had to
fall back upon whatever was burn
able. Some of the irreverant ones
discovered that the mummies of cats
and other animals which were held
sacred by the ancient Egyptians made
a pretty hot fire. That started the
joke ivhich had more truth than hu
mor in it: "Here, Bill," yelled the En
glish engineer to his fireman, "chuck
In i~ king; those plebeians won't get
up enough steam 10 take you to the
top of the gTade." The contractors
nho supplied fuel to the railroad were
none too particular and when cat
mummies were not handy they didn't
scruple to break up human mummies.
Word has come to the engineers
and firemen* who are part of the out
fits of American contractors who
probably will be put to work digging
the Panama canal that the ancient
inhabitants of the isthmus used to
make mummies of their dead, and
some of them declare they will locate
a few dried up Montezumas and feed
them into the firebox.
But the chances are that most of
the steam used on the isthmus cut will
be raised by liquid fuel â crude oil
from the Beaumont field of Texas.
American contractors have a habit of
anticipating things, and some of them
who have already decided that they
will "be in" on the great work have
outlined a pipe line scheme which
contemplates tank steamers to carry
the oil, a pumping plant, storage tanks
and a pipe line extending the entire
length of the works.
Oil for fuel has been pushing its way
forward in spite of all opposition.
Ocean greyhounds are using it; !t is
sprayed into the flre boxes of locomo
tives, and its use for steam purposes
Is rapidly extending. It is figured out
that there is as much fuel value in two
tens of cryie oil as in three tons of
coal at $3 50 a ton. and that weight for
Â¦weight forty cubic feet of oil is equiva
lent to seventy feet of coal. This last
comparison gives oil an enormous ad
vantage in the matter of storage
aboard steamships and on locomotives.
Thus a steamship which carries in her
bunkers 45CK) tons of coal would only
carry S000 tons of oil, and the oil could
be stored in the double bottom of the
ehip, giving all the coal bunker space
to the cargj.
Crude oil is burned under boilers in
several ways. The ordinary method is
the injection method, the oil being
Fprayed into the combustion chamber
by a jet of steam or compressed air. If
steam Is used, air, to aid combustion,
is introduced at the same time. In an
other process the liquid fuel percolates
upward through a porous bed, accom
panied by heated air, and sometimes by
Btcam. Recently an oil burning device
has been used which spurts the oil un
der a high pressure into the furnace,
and still another vaporizes the oil by
means of a email retort which is heated
in the furnace.
(All ports of extravagant claims are
mad<Â» by the fuel oil men as to the val
ue of liquid fuel. They have claimed
that one pound of crude oil will evap
orate forty-Fix pounds of water. But
" practical tests by practical men indi
cate that under ordinary everyday
working conditions fuel oil will evap
" orate from fifteen to sixteen pounds of
water to a pound of oil. Under like
conditions a pound of anthracite evap
orates 9.7 pounds of water and a pound
of soft coal 10.14 pounds.
The evaporated duty and calorific
value of fuels are not always true
guides to the man who uses steam.
The list of fuels for industrial pur
poses is a long one. and includes hard
and soft coal, charcoal, wood, coke,
natural gas, fuel gas. crude petroleum,
the residuum from petroleum distilla
tion, itsphaltum. coal tar, resin, bri
quettes â compressed lumps of pow
dered coal mixed with some binding
compound â corncobs, twisted hay,
pine cones, sawdust and refuse in
woodworking plants, fish; garbage,
greasy refuse from packing-houses
and rendering plants, peat, cotton
waste and, in the Bessemer converter,
just plain air.
Switzerland has come forward with
an idea which is American, because it
was originated by Dr. E. J. Constan3
of New York, at present professor of
chemistry in the Federal Polytechni
cuns at Zurich. He proposes to re
form the whole coal trade of Switzer
land by selling coal according to its
heat-producing value instead of by
dead weight- The Swiss Government
has authorized the institution of a fed
eral testing station for fuel, for Switz
erland, producing no coal and having
no navigable- rivers to the seacoast,
must import all her coal by rail. So
Switzerland is going to test all kinds
of fuels and to enlighten the Swiss
public through periodical publications
on the subject.

T'hE robbery of the university by its secretary is
not exactly a clap of thunder from a clear sky.
The thief had been going the pace for some time,
and his doings were so public as to provoke caution
had the affairs of the institution been under strict ob
servation by the Regents. Nothing is easier than lock
ing the stable after the horse is stolen, and "I told you
so" is always said too late. The Regents are all men
of affairs, foremast among the citizens of the State,
but that has not prevented the robbery of an institution
the most worthy and the most needy in the State.
Is it not true that in selecting Regents our Governors
have made the mistake of choosing men whose constant
direct and personal at'tention to the university is im
possible by reason of the greatness and the absorbing
nature of their own affairs?
The president has upon him executive duties requir
ing all of his time. These make necessary his general
contact with our public men and all of our material in
terests. He must be the representative of the university
at public gatherings, and of necessity has to travel much
and appear on great occasions far away to fitly represent
the culture and purpose of the University of California.
The busy Regents, pressed for time in their own mat
ters, though specially charged with committee duties
relating to the finances, are in just the condition to be
misled by an adroit scoundrel, such as. the secretary
seems to have been. Superse.rviceable, ready to relieve
others of work and to oversee and report upon the
things that they should do, he was placed in the exact
position where his champagne thirst would naturally
seek quenching outside of his beer income.-
Now that the exposure has come through his reck
less use of long immunity from any check, the discovery
is made that should long ago have been made by those
whose business it was to make it. The bookkeeping
turns out to be archaic. No proper system of checks
upon the secretary existed. He received and handled
money which, under a proper system, should never
have come into his hands. He was permitted to sow of
the wind and reap of the whirlwind without let or
hindrance.
The Call has often said that on the directing boards
of State institutions there should be an element com
posed of citizens especially skilled and highly interested
in the work of the institution to be managed. Penologists
with business ideas should be among the managers of
prisons; experts in juvenile training and devoted to it
should be in contact with the reform schools, and so on
up to the State University. In its regency should be
men, if possible, of university training and with such
leisure in their own affairs as to have time left to look
into the bookkeeping and watch the income and outgo of
every penny of income. It is true that the Regents have
an auditor, a paid officer, but no good has come of pass
ing to him the responsibility that belonged to them,
for neither he nor they noticed the defective book
keeping, the slipshod ways and the door left open to
dishonesty until inadvertence of the criminal himself
exposed it all.
The theft soon mounted up/to $60,000, and may go
higher. But whatever its amount it may still be a cheap
price to pay for a thorough reformation in the business
methods and safeguards of the university. In effecting
this the fact should not be lost sight of that gentlemen
whose vast affairs require that they be constantly alert
to prevent just such crimes happening in their own
business have no time left to keep watch against them
in the business of the university.
The criminal himself is undeserving of sympathy.
Since he was a boy he had been a beneficiary of the
institution. He had no one dependent upon him; his
official income was ample for his honest needs, and,
above that, was sufficient to have laid for him the foun
dation of fortune. All of this opportunity he threw
away. He was an ingrate to his benefactors and disloyal
to his trust. Now he takes himself for a text and
preaches morality to others. The most useful lesson he
can teach is by suffering the extreme penalty of his of
fense. It is for others to point out the moral taught
by his downfall.
Those who have trusts in keeping for others have
only one safe method to follow, and that is pointed out
by the rules of honor and honesty that are known to all
men, gentle and simple alike. The desire for a life of
pleasure enjoyed by dishonest courses is the maggot that
destroys character and purpose. The end is always sure.
It is disgrace, punishment, sometimes suicide and al
ways despair. No doubt many a man is deterred from
taking the first step by the constant vigilance of those
whose business it is to watch his work, and it is unwise
and grievous that such oversight is so often omitted.

Coulter, who was a member of the po
lice force in the latter part erf the fif
ties. Coulter was a bluff, old fellow,
who had seen many days on board ship
and understood more about ropes and
sails than he did about target practice,
yet he made a remarkable record while
on the force.
Early Qne morning; while under the
shadow of some trees on the Battery
street side of the Postoffice, he saw
three men breaking into a store at the
corner of Battery and Jackson. As
soon as he had satisfied himself that
a burglary was being committed, he
crept up on the men, revolver in hand,
and called upon them to surrender.
The men did not surrender, but started
off on, a dead run In three different di
rections, oni? going north on Battery
street and the two others running one
up and the other down Jackson street.
Coulter immediately flred,. first at the
one on Battery street, then at the one
up Jackson street and then at the one
running do\vn that street. Each shot
was followed by an exclamation of
pain. Before assistance arrived Coulter
investigated. One went to the Morgue,
the other two to the prison hospital and
Coulter was the police hero of the
time. The dead burglar proved to be
one Morris, a brother of "Tipperary
Bill," who was under the ban of the
Vigilance Committee of '56.
THE UNIVERSITY ROBBED.
of the ideas of Hon. William Randolph Hearst of New
York, who wears the head of the party on his shoulders.
I am but an humble instrument, with no more relation
to 'the cause of what I utter, than a water pipe has to
the creation of the water that flows through it. I am
simply a job of oratorical plumbing, a patchwork of
pipe and soft solder. The affluent spring which supplies
the ineffably lofty and fluid thought which passes
through me is in the other house. Attend now, Senators,
while my oratorical works work on the supply of thought
which gushes in a ceaseless stream from Mr. Hearst."
That would be doing the proper thing, for we insist
that it is wrong to compel Mr. Hearst to call public atten
tion in his own paper to the source of Bailey's speech
in himself. His shrinking modesty approaches the mak
ing of such a revelation with painful diffidence, and it
is wrong in Bailey and others to' compel him to stop
the machinery of his thought factory and bank the fires
while he calls attention to his output.

The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday administered a snub to the
Board of Public Works by placing on
file a letter received from the last
named body requesting that the. Board
of Supervisors pass a resolution au
thorizing the construction of basalt
block runways by John Garber on San
some street, between Vallejo and Green.
The committee decided that the Board
of Supervisors has no Jurisdiction in
the matter, and it lies with the Board
of Works alone to take action. The
committee had in mind the fact that
an ordinance was passed by the Board
of Supervisors granting permission to
St. Mary's Help Hospital for a spur
track on Filbert street, but the or
dinance has been persistently ignored
by the Board of Public Works, which
has thus far refused to grant the per
mit.
The committee reported in favor of
granting permission to the Associated
Oil Company to construct an eight-inch
pipe line along certain streets for the
transportation of fuel oil from its
pumping plant on Berry street to the
oil storage tanks of the San Francisco
Gas Company, at Townsend and Third
streets.
The petition of the Western Pacific
Company for a franchise along Six
teenth and other streets was laid over
for one week at the request of the com
pany's attorney.
Similar action was taken with the
petition of the San Francisco Labor
Council that when a franchise is grant
ed to any railroad company that a con
dition be imposed that no Asiatics shall
be employed In the construction of thj
road.
The i>etitions of the'Wilmerding and
Lick District Improvement Club that
Kansas street, between Eighteenth and
Mariposa, be ordered closed as a matter
of public benefit; of Hiram Cook, call-
Ing attention to the fact that no work
has been done on the extension of
Nineteenth avenue, although an appro
priation has been made therefor, and- of
Flinn & Treacy for permission to blast
on the property In the block bounded
by Uranus, Ashbury and Seventeenth
streets were all referred to the Board
of Public Works for investigation and
report. Similar action was taken with
the petition that the name of Central
avenue be changed to Presidio avenue.
The committee reported in favor of
accepting the land from Charles Pat
ton for the extension of East Park
street to Andover avenue, -

The mandolin musicale given by
Samuel Adelstein and his class at
Steinway Hall last night was quite an

A large number of bright pupils of

day afternoon from the principals of

entitled to enter upon high school
courses. Graduating exercises *were
held at some of the schools. Following
is a list of the graduates and some of
the programmes rendered:

The sums expended during November
were for repairs to basalt and cobble
streets, 52729 17: cleaning and repair-
Ing sewers, $5260 73; cleaning streets,
J12.743 sr..
The board decided yesterday to bar
ricade wooden sidewalks where the
owners have been directed to put down
new concrete walks. They are on the
south side of Twenty-second street,
Â¦between San Jose avenue anil Guerrero
street; southeast corner of Twenty
second and Mission streets and on the
south side of Eighteenth street, be
tween Dolores and Guerrero streets.
The proceedings are preliminary to
actions against property owners who
refuse to repair their sidewalks to com
pel compliance with an ordinance in
view of the recent verdict against the
board for $5000 damages recovered by
a woman who was injured on Buchan
an street.
Tho report of A. J. Donovan, chief
of the bureau of streets, on the opera
tions of the department durir*^ Novem
ber was filed yesterday with :he Board
of Public Works. The report says that
Fjvrial attention will In future be given
to the repair of bituminous streets in
the downtown district and a crew of
men will be kept there until all the
roadways are thoroughly repaired. The
report continues:
As to the repair of Market street,
work has not been instituted owing to
the problem of how and to what ex
tent repairs shall be made. These mat
ters are under consideration by the
board, and pending their conclusion
work will not be undertaken.
Some of the streets will require Sun
day work, as traffic during the week
is eo continuous that It is impossible
to proceed with the work. Folsom
street has received a thorough over
hauling between Third an-1 Eighth
streets and Is now in good condition
for the winter save for a few small
patches of old material that will break
after a heavy rain.
During the month far better work
was done by all street sweeping and
cleaning contractors than for the month
previous. Owing to the great amount
of building sand dropped upon the
streets by the wagons of grading con
tractors sprinkling was ordered on
Market street and south of Market
street. In sprinkling districts 1 and 2
the appropriation for sprinkling will
likely be entirely inadequate for the
remainder of the fiscal year.
The class of '03 of the State Normal
School held its graduating exercisea
yesterday afternoon at ,the school on
Powell street between Sacramento and
Clay streets. The student body gave
an entertainment to the ! outgoing
class.
The rooms of the school were dec
orated in an artistic manner. The
class colors, green and pink, were
draped in pretty profusion, intermin
gled with which were myriads of
American flags and Japanese lanterns,
the colors blending perfectly and giv
ing the place a picturesque appear
ance. There were eight young iadles
in the outgoing class who irtre given
their diplomas.
It is safe to say that a more comely
aggregation of young ladles never
graduated from the Normal School.
The hall was crowded with the friends
and parents of the young ladies and
the student body of the school.
An excellent programme, in which
were several original farces by the
pupils, was rendered, and the after
noon was passed off in a merry man
ner. The farces were exceedingly
good and provoked much merriment
inasmuch as they dealt with charac
ters and scenes in and around the
school.
Miss Susan Towt, president of the
graduating class, had charge of the
programme, which was as follows:
Farce, "Reunion of Eight Old Maids
of the Class of '04"; solo. Miss Lynch;
farce, "The Successful Schoolmarm" ;
Japanese love song, school sextette;
farce, "A Conversation in the Girls'
Room"; class prophecy, Miss F. Mo

Miss Donohue; senior song.
Those who received their diplomas
were: Misses Susan Towt, Salinas; Flor

on the evening of January 2, 1904.
WORKS BOARD
GETS A SNUB
Parry admitted that the commission
might decide to delegate a machinist
to attend to the duties of timekeeper
in addition to his own duties. Parry
said it would be to the interest of the
department to do so as there was not
enough work for the timekeeper to
keep a man at it steadily. Asked if
it was not intended to appoint Glee
son and whether Gleeson in fact was
not already filling the position Parry
replied:
"Well, I saw Gleeson around here
(the Fire Commission's office) to-day,"
but no further information was vouch
safed by Parry.
The place to which Boland was cer
tified became vacant by the promotion
of Philip S. O'Biien to be a Deputy
Tax Collector to succeed Hiram Gold
stein, deceased. O'Brien stood second
on the list of ordinary clerks and was
appointed as such. Requisition was
Immediately made by the Fire Com
mission for a clerk from the .same list
and Boland's name was certified.
Secretary McCarthy said that he
made the requisition on the order of
the commission, but Commissioner
Parry says that there was s.ime mis
take and the requisition should never
have gone in.
At the last meeting of tho commis
sion no action was taken and the mat
ter was placed in the hands ot Parry
ostensibly to make a report on the dif
ference between an "experienced" clerk
and an "ordinary" clerk. The ieal rea
son for postponement, howevtr, is that
Parry is to make arrangements where
by the requisition on the ordinary
clerks' list may be withdrawn and an
other requisition made on the "ma
chinists' " list. Parry is favorable to
Gleeson, who !s first on the list, and
will sacrifice Boland in order to make
a place for his favorite.
When Parry was seen regarding the
change of heart on the part of the
commission he was somewhat evasive
in his replies regarding what the com
mission intended to do in the matter.
Parry said that the requisition for an
ordinary clerk was not authorized by
the commission and It should never
have been sent.
The Board of Fire Commissioners,
through one of its members, John S.
Parry, is at present engaged in juggling
with civil service and incidentally is
doing a little politics in the matter of
the appointment of a timekeeper and
assistant in the Fire Department cor
poration yard.
Complaint was filed Wednesday with
the Civil Service Commission by Ed
ward M. Boland, an eligible on the or
dinary clerk's list, who was certified
last Friday for appointment on the
requisition of the Fire Commission,
that the commission had so far refused
to honor the requisition. Boland said
it looked as though there was a little
scheme on foot to keep him out of the
position and appoint in his stead Wil
liam Gleeson, who stands first on the
eligible list of machinists. Bcland was
informed that the commission had cer
tified his name for the place and that
it knew of no other contemulated ac
tion on the part of the Fire Commis
sion.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1903.
RIVERHEAD, R. I.. Dec. 17.â Tuthlll
Reeve, the demented farmer who yesterday
shot and killed a deputy sheriff while the lat
ter wu -trylnsr to serve an execution for debt
at his home near here, surrendered to-day after
an all-night siege.
The petition of the creditors of the
estate of John Wolf, the liquor man,
for a revocation of the order admitting
his will to probate was given a par
tial hearing in the Probate Court yes
terday and the case was continued un
til next Tuesday. -The evidence taken
yesterday tended to show that Wolf's
alleged death was not fully established.
Wolf disappeared in 1898. At that
time he was executor of the estate of
Sarah M. Flerson, and when he left he
took part of the estate with him. Some
months ago Mary Wolf, his wife, of
fered for probate a will made by him
and it was admitted, after she had
shown that a deputy coroner at Seattle
had identified the remains of a man
who had drowned himself in the waters
of the Sound as those of Wolf. Some
weeks later David B. Paktor and Ed
ward Aigeltinger, Wolf's bondsmen,
who were sued by the creditors of the
Pierson estate, filed a petition to re
voke the order admitting the Wolf will
to probate, claiming they had
proof that Wolf had been seen In va
rious parts of the country long after
the discovery of his supposed remains
in the Sound country.
This proof was offered yesterday in
the testimony' of J. M. Downing, J. A.
Wessels and Felix Cohn. Downing,
who was once employed by Wolf as

DO NOT WEAR A LONG FACE.
It Is a Great Handicap in AH Busi-
ness and Social Relations.
The man who looks as if he had lost
his last friend is in no danger of being Â¦
crushed by the jam of new ones un-
less he "cheers up." People are not
g-oing out of their way nowadays to
associate with the man of mournful and
melancholy appearance. They are
afraid he will tell them his troubles
and they steer clear of him, as they all
have plenty of their own.
The most universal cause of the for-
lorn and hopeless appearance to-day is
dyepepsia. It unfits a man for every
duty of life and causes him to become
despondent and grloomy and necessarily
his looks drr not belie his feeling*. He
appears caÂ«t down and dejected and
becomes a burden to himself and hu-
manky in general.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
dyspeptic's rertain relief. They do the
work that his stomach is unable to
do and by relieving that organ of its
burdens permit it to regain its health
end strength and again become active
and useful in its functions. They con-
tain all the essential ingredients that
enter into the digestive fluids and se-
e cretions of the stomach and they act-
ually take up the work and do it Just
as a healthy, pound stomach would.
By this means a man can go right
ahead with his work and eat enough
to keep him in proper working condi-
tion. His Fvstem is not deprived of
Its necessary nourishment as it is in
the rase of the "Ftarvatic-n cure" or
the employment of some of the first
class chicken foods now on the market.
Ftarvation, even if it wore a good thing,
could rot be continued long enough to
effect a euro: for a disc-rdered and
worn out stomach Is not going to be-
come Btrore and healthy in two ot
three dav*.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act nat-
urally because they contain natural di-
gestive?. The principal component
parts are aseptic pepsin, malt diastase
and other ingredients with like proper-
tics that do the work regardless of the
condition of the ptomach. There is no
unnatural or violent disturbance of the
digestive organs as the result of their
action. Tn fact, the existence of the
Ftomach is entirely forgotten as soon
as they have had time to begin their
operations. They also possess very
curative and healing properties and as-
siFt the stomach in getting well, while
relieving it of its work. They perform
the duties of both nurse and physician.
Stuart's Dyspepsia TaWets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and there is very little danger of any
druggist trying to sell you something
rise in Its place that is "Just as good."
They are so well established and have
done bo much goc-d in the world that
their name has become a household
word: so the usual warning, "Accept
no substitute." is unnecessary in the
case of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I

The Salvation Army has made so many
converts in Stockholm in recent years
that fourteen steamers were required to
convoy thÂ« members to the suburban
meeting/ place at General Booths last
vlrit.
The representatives of the Yosem
ite, San and Hayes Valley
Athletic clubs agreed before the Su
pervisors' Police Committee yester
day to arrange a monster benefit for
Frank McConnell, the pugilist who
was injured in a bout with "Spider"
Welch. Mrs. McConnell, the mother
of the boy, had complained that she
received no cash from a former bene
fit given by the Yosemite Club, which,
however, paid $100.0 in doctor's bills.
Harry Corbett, E. C. Harrington
and Morris Lsvy agreed to take the
matter up with the understanding that
the entire proceeds shall be turned
over to Mrs. McConnell. Tho con
testants are to receive no pay. The
benefit will probably be given on the
night succeeding: the Corbett-Hanlon
bout at Mechanics' Pavilion.

Accused of Stealing Chickens.
C. Bennett was arrested yesterday
afternoon by Detective Tom Gibson
on a "John Doe" warrant from Solano
Counts*. A letter received by Captain
Martin from W. W. R. Reeves, deputy
sheriff at Fairfleld. states that Ben
nett is wanted there for stealing
chickens throughout the county and
consigning them to various commis
sion merchants In this city. He will
be held ponding the arrival of an of
ficer to take him back.
The results of the civil service ex
aminations of lieutenants of police for
promotion to captaincies afforded a
theme for considerable discussion
among-the policemen yesterday. There
is only one vacancy at present. It was
caused by the death of Captain B,ird
sall. Lieutenant Duke having obtain
ed the highest percentage, would In
the natural order of thing3 fill the
vacancy.
The charter, however, gives the "Po-*
lice Commissioners the power to se
lect any one of the three highest on
the list certified to by the Civil Ser
vice Commissioners to fill a vacancy.
Lieutenants Burnett and Gleeson fol
low Duke in the order named and the
fortunate one can be selected from
these three. The Police Commission
ers, for some reason, recently asked
the opinion of City and County Attor
ney Lane on this provision of the
charter and he told them they had this
power of selection.
Mrs. Herman Zeeb and her three
young children were placed in the De

Mr?. Zeeb's husband claims to have
formerly been an officer in the German
army, and he arrived in San Francisco
ten >;ear$ ago. While the husband is
able to earn a living as a laborer, he is
reputed to spend his earnings â¢ for I
liquor and fails to look after his family.
Time and time again the Zeeb family
have been ejected by Sheriff's deputies
from houses where they have failed to
pay their rent, and this fate overtook*
the family yesterday at 11 Sherwood
place. The woman and her children
were found on the streets and sent to
the hospital for care.
An effort will be made to-day to have
the three children of the Zeebs sent to

CHICAGO, Dec. 17.â Owners of the
American Baseball League at their an
nual meeting to-day rescinded the foul
strike rule adopted last year as an ex
periment. They declared in favor of a
schedule of 134 games in order to meet
the extension of the National League
schedule. The playing season will open
on April 15.
The National League officially de
clared in favor of the foul-strike rule,
and it is the belief that trouble will be
experienced before a rule satisfactory
to both leagues can be agreed on.
The affairs of the Pacific Coast
League came up for discussion during
the meeting- but the question was re
ferred to President Johnson, who was
given power to act for the American
League in any attempt that might be
made to get the independent league on
the coast to join with the organiza
tions cast- of the Rocky Mountains.

Fred Bogan*s most^notable ring con

BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 17.â Fred Bogan,
one of the famous California light
weights of his time, will soon come
Into possession of $50,000 in cash. He
was in Butte for a short time to-day,
but left on the afternoon train for San
Francisco, where he is to receive the
money. Bogan has settled down in Bel
grade, and as soon as he receives his
fortune he will erect a hotel in that
prosperous little town in the Gallatin
Valley.
Bogan was not made .aware of his
gcod luck until after an extended
search had been made for him. About
three months ago he located at Bel
grade, and an attorney came from San
Francisco to negotiate with him. There
was some talk of a law suit among the
heirs, but a compromise was reached
and Bogan agreed to take $50,000 for
his interest.
The estate to which he is an heir has
been appraised at J5.000.000. It consists
mostly of business property in the cen
tral portion of San Francisco. The es
tate was left by Charles Bogan, an un

among the California argonauts, he
having arrived in the Golden State in

Joseph Oldliam Prophesies That San
Francisco Will Supply Them to
European Nations.
Joseph R. Oldham, naval architect,
gave a lecture last night, his subject
being "Errors in Ship Design and
Construction," before the students of
' the drawing department of the Hum
boldt Evening High School.
The lecturer said that here on thi3
very spot will the center of civiliza
tion be located. Here, he said, will
be built the greatest ships that ever
floated, to be expo/ted to the nations
of the Old World. Even in a year or
two from now, ' said Mr. Oldham. It
must be acknowledged by the nations
of Europe that at least two of the
finest warships afloat were built at
San Francisco. No better work, he
said, was ever seen than that now
being done at the Union Iron Works.
Mr. Oldham wished to admonish
his young hearers to strive to be
worthy of such great achievements,
to do their duty, to be strong and of
good courage, for good courage, he
reminded them, was next to honor.
The lectures which will be given In
the drawing department of the school
this evening will be "Variable Speed
Control of Machine Tools," by W. F.
Hynes; "Electrical Engineering," by
E. B. Parsons; "Gas Engines," by W.
Bates, and. "Engine Tests," /by P.

NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The Maxim &
Gay Company, turf correspondents and
accountants, wore barred from the use
of the mail? by a fraud order made
effective to-day and issued from the
offke of the Assistant Attorney General
of the Postoffice Department. The
firms circulars and advertisements are
worded in most attractive fashion and
havp been given the widest range of
publicity. On its letterheads and ad
vertisements the company refers to any
banker In Nt-w York. New Orleans.
Chicago, Saratoga or Washington. It
makes most ailurir.g promises of win
rirg for its client? large sums of money
from a small initial Investment. Ac
cording: to these advertisements, the
company Js capitalized at 550,000. Th'S
name of the president and manager is
given as <3rajiam Rice.
Among other statements made frrr the
benefit cf possible investors is that of
the indorsement of the daily press
everywhere, a statement which has
been found by the Postoffice Depart
ment officials to be false. The plan of
operation was to agree to invest a cer
tain sum of money for a client. The
firm was to play this at the track on
horses of its own selection, the firm to
receive 23 per cent of the winnings as
a commission. It is believed this firm
has made a great deal cf money from
credulous persons throughout the coun
try.

CXDER THE OFFICIAL BAV
The Restaurant Keepers' Associa
tion and the Cooks' and Waiters"
Union have compromised their differ
ences and the agreement for the com
ing year will be signed by both par
ties. The -agreement is substantially
like the old one. THe association
yielded to the demand for union
houses, but the clause relative to the
hiring of men through the offices of
the unions was stricken out.
F. A. Krone, proprietor of the Pop
ular Restaurant on Geary street, and
M. Johnson, who recently resigned
from the association, have opened up
their restaurants as independent
houses. Krone demands the right to
be "captain of .the ship." Johnson
says he will be "the only walking del
egate of this shop."
There was a large crowd of union
pickets in front of Johnson's restau
rant yesterday and they loudly shout
ed that it was "an unfair house." A
squad of policemen were kept busy
keeping the crowds moving and pre
venting disturbances. The boycott is
on in full force and the pickets are
trying to keep the hungry away from
the eating-house.
The cloakmakers are still out and
also using boycotting tactics to injure
the various cloak houses. There was
a clash in front of the Pacific Cloak
and Suit House yesterday and eight
men were arrested. They are William
Reed. E. E. Silner, Francis Morgan, '
Frank Silversteln, Arthur J. Duffy, j
William Plusker, Meyer Blaskfleld
and Loui3 Eaton.
The pickets employed by the Cloak
makers' Union marched up and down
crying that the house was unfair and
other pickets took up the cry that it
was a "fair house." This continued
for some time and then Â¦ both sides
came to blows. The police separated
the combatants and took eight into
custody.

MAN OF MEANS
- Harry Corbett, who is an excellent
judge of piic-CF, when asked what the
opening betting would be. said: "If the
admirers of Young Corbett believe him
to be in condition for a hard fight I
think the Denver man will open an 8 to
10 choice. ;The price will probably fluc
tuate between that and even money,
according to tho condition of the two
men as they appear in training."
Young Corbett eased up in his boxing
yesterday after the fierce work of the
previous day. He went through his va
rious exercises, except the work with
the glove?;
Eddie Hanlon is accustoming himself
to hard knocks at Alameda, giving and
taking severe blows. in training. .East
ern writers are of the opinion that if
he carries the war to Corbett and fights
him in the manner he fought Yanger
the champion will retain his title,
as that is his favorite style. Both
boxers will be in such improved form
over that shown at their last meeting
that a comparison cannot b? drawn.
Corbett will, if anything, 'be in better
form than when he fought McGovern.
Hanlon will be better than at any pre
vious time in his career, and if he has
Corbett in distress at any stage of the
journey he will not give him a chance
to recover, as he did last February.
With Fitzsimmons," Jim Corbett,
Gardner, Johnson, Ferguson, Seiger,
Weinig and a host of good old has
beens laid away on the shelf, the box
ing promoters have few attractive
fights in sight. For this reason it is
expected a determined effort will be
made to match the winner of this fight
with Britt. The featherweights will
weigh in at 6 o'clock at 129 pounds. This
will mean a ringside weight of 131
pounds. As Britt fights at 133 pounds
ringside, there is but little room for ar
gument.
Britt is five feet six inches tall and
has- a reach of sixty-five and a half
inches.
Corbett is five feet three inches tall
and his reach is sixty-five inches. '
Hanlon is five feet five inches tall
and measures sixty-seven inches from
tip to tip.
Terry McGowan Is five feet three and
a half Inches tall and has a reach of
sixty-five and a half inches.
The Young Corbett-Eddie Hanlon
championship boxing bout, which is set
for the 29th inst., is already creating a
lot of discussion. It will undoubtedly
be a heavy betting affair, as the East
ern bookmakers are expected to back
Corbett to a man, while Hanlon has an
army of friends to make good his end of
the wagering.
BERKELEY, Dec. 17.â The Univer
sity of California officials havs finally
and definitely decided that the eleven
will not play the proposed ?ame of
football on New Year's day with the
University of Minnesota. Manager
Ezra Dccoto telegraphed to ihe Min
nesota managers to-day that it was
now too late to do any more negotiat
ing and that California would not play
under any consideration. No answer
had been received to this telegram up
to a late hour to-night. No change
will be made in this decision whether
one is received or not. Manager Decoto
said to-night:
"The University of California will
not- meet the University- of Minnesota
on New Year's day under av.y consid
eration. I finally telegraphed to that
college to-day and under no circum
stances will we reconsider o<:r decision.
The time for reconsideration has
passed. We opened negotiations with
the Eastern college some time ago and
we offered them everything they could
ask in reason. They kept asking" more
until we could not grant it. Now it has
reached a time where proper prepara
tion for the garfXfe cannot he made.' We
have not the time to put our team in
proper shape, we have not the time
to do the proper advertising and we
have not the time to do anything that
is necessary to give the patrons of the
game a satisfactory exhibition. The
Minnesota people kept us waiting too
long and 1 we have simply broken off
negotiations. There will be do game."
The slake is limited to ninety-six en
tries, many dogs of class .be'.ns in the
running. The first brace will go i" to
the hands of the .slipper to-morrow
morning at 11:30 o'clock.

Mr. Nolan is trying to figure out what
he will do with the strange pet. He
is a fierce one and refuses to make
friends with any one. The only thing
he will do Is eat. He is possessed of
an appetite that is beyond description
and he puts all kind of edibles under
his belt.
Sargent had a lively experience with
the beast. He captured him near Gil
roy en Tuesday evening after a bitter
fight. Sargent was on a hunting trip
and ran across the cat in a quail's nest.
The animal did not observe the ap
proach of the hunter and the latter
made up his mind to capture the ani
mal.
He made a grab for him, but the
beast fought back. He sprang at Sar
gent and the latter was having a fierce
fight when Gec<;e Baumgarten arrived
on the scene and the two men finally
managed to tie the cat and put him
into a cage.
The beast is an exceptionally large
one. of a spotted gray color and very
lively. Nolan is at present undecided
as to what he will do with his Christ
mas gift. Several people hav? offered
to buy him for exhibition purposes, but
so far Nolan has refused all ths offers.
Joseph Nolan, the well-known sports
man and shoe merchant, is re
ceiving hl3 Christmas presents
at an early date this year. On
Wednesday evening an expressman
arrived at his place of business with a
bulky package. Nolan thought it might
be an automobile or perhaps a swell
music box. When he tore off the
wrappings he jumped ten feet by actual
count, for instead of a pieca of mer
chandise the little token proved to be
a wildcat, which was even more fero
cious than his name implies.
On a little card attached to the cage
was a brief note to Mr. Nolan from
James A. Sargent of San Jose. In a
few words Mr. Sargent explained how
he had captured the animal at the risk
of his life and hoped the token would
be gratefully received and kt-pt as a
remembrance.

The first steeplechase of the season
is down for decision to-day.
Reeves, winner of the fifth event,
was bid up from 5500 to $1000 by Al
Koenigsberj. Lamasney Bros, retained
the colt. -
The hand books about town were
snowed in, it is said, with Ebony
money.
Wright, who rode Rasp, escaped
with a severe shaking up.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAYV
Burns had the mount on Saintly, fa
vorite for the fifth selection. It was
through no fault of his the brown
gelding did not register first. Saintly
was away from the barrier none too
well, but v*hen in his stride did, not
seem to fancy the footing. Reeves,
with Foley up and 5 to 1, moved along
from fourth position, winning easily at
the finish from Fort Wayne, the early
pacemaker. Florinel, a 12 to 1 shot,
annexed the show.
An accident in the final seven-furlong
selling niece altered the complexion of
things. Soon after the start Rasp, with
a green boy named Wright in the sad
dle, was bumped and thrown, serious
ly interfering with Idogo, the favorite,
as well as with Pat Morrissey and
Constable, two other well-backed ones.
The winner turned up in Elfin King, a
12 to 1 shot, ridden by Willie Haack,
which downed Pat Morrissey nearly
three lengths.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Although three favorites came
through all right, long shots cut quite
a figure in the afternoon's sport. Kick
ufnbob, Reeves and Elfin King, all at
healthy prices, were the three unan
nounced and unexpected arrivals. The
card was an ordinary one, but attract
ed a large crowd.
Adirondack, with Birkenruth up,
closed favorite for the opening seven
furlong run. He was inclined to run
out on the turns, and fell easy prey to
Kickumbob, a 15 to 1 shot. Jed Lewis
rode a first-class race on the winner.
Invictus took the show.
At odds of 3 to 5, Hainault, with
Charley Kelly on his back, made a gal
lop of the Futurity course sprint fol
lowing. The other starters comprised
for the most part two-year-olds and
Hainault won at his leisure. Lady
For.se led Brick Fowler out for place
honors.
A well-defined plunge was made on
Ebony to take the seven-furlong run
for maiden two-year-olds and after
events justified the unloading. Charley
Connell rode Sir Appleby and did so in
a manner that would indicate the lad
had forgotten how to spell horse. Tom
my Burns piloted Ebony and won from
Neko with all brakes set. Sir Appleby,
under his light draught power, was
third.
SAINTLY IS BEATEN*.
Sidney Bender's gelding Lord Mel
bourne is a useful piece of racing hard
ware, more especially so when there
happens to be any moisture on the
track.
On "Wednesday he defeated a fair
field, splashing home as he pleased and
repealed the trick yesterday in the
mile and seventy-yard selling affair.
- It >\vas figured that Diderot would be
a dangerous contender, which enabled
the friends of his lordship to obtain as
good as 3 to 2 in the ring. There was
nothing to it from the start. Ollphant
hustled the Bender entry to the front
and he won all the way, beating Si
lurian and Lacy Crawford with appar
ent ease. The going was not sloppy
enough for Diderot, and when Tommy
Burns took him out on the dry going
through the stretch he faded away.
Frank Doss appears to be camping
on the trail of the winners. He tilted
the winner on the preceding day, and
yesterday boosted the selling price
from $800 to $1200. On each occasion
Sidney Bender bid the usual $5 neces
sary to retain.

Recently, according to the complaint,
Mrs. Pchnabel showed a desire to han
dle the property herself, much to the
disgust of her son, and he states that
he fears that if the property is deeded
back to her by Hatch she will put an
end to h!s allowance and make a
chanpre in her plan to give it to her
children upon her death. Â¦ â¢
A suit for an injunction restraining
Jackson Hatch from conveying back to
Clara Schnabel the property " he has
held in trust for her since November,
1896, was filed yesterday by E. C.
Schnabel. her son. He alleges that if
his mother gets back the control of the
property he may lose the income of 560
a month he has enjoyed since Hatch
took control of it, and bases his suit
on the ground that his mother, in mak
ing the trust deed, provided that it
6hould remain under Hatch's control
until her death, at which time it was to
be distributed to her four children in
equal shares.
The suit reveals the fact that the
plaintiff is the only one of the Schnabel
children whj is dissatisfied. The other
three. E. H. Schnabel, Emma Koenig
and Erna Sachse, have refused to join
with him in his efforts to prevent Mrs.
Schnabel from again securing the con
trol of the property left her by her hus
band. Ernest Schnabel, and are made
defendants In the suit. Their inter
ests, however, are Identical with those
of the plaintiff, each being a beneficiary
to the extent of $60 a month under the
present arrangements.
It appears that the Schnabel estate
consists of realty of great value in this
city, Los Angeles and Santa Clara
County. In deeding it to Hatch Mrs.
Schnabel provided that he should hold
It in trust until her death, or until
such time as she determined to termi
nate the trust. During the existence of
the trust he was to receive $75 a month
for. his services and was to make her a
monthly allowance of $260 out of the In
come from the property. He was also
to pay each of her four children $60 a
month.
Desire for the custody of Ah Young,
a pretty Chinese girl about 14 years of
agf, was the cause of a legal struggle
in the probate court yesterday. Don
a!d;na Cameron, superintendent of the
Chinese Presbyterian Home, wants the
custody of the little Oriental, and so
does Lum Quoia. also known as Choo
Bing Quoia, who claims to be the step
mother of the young girl. Because of
the absence of an interpreter satisfac
tory to both sides the matter was put
over until Tuesday, December 29.
Choo Bing Quoia, the alleged step
mother of Ah Young, lives at 711 Com
mercial street. Three weeks ago the
little girl, who has lived with her for
some time, ran away and took refuge
ot the mission, claiming that she had
been abused. Since then numerous at
tempts to get her away from the mis
sionaries have been made, but without
avail, the Uttle. girl preferring to re
main at tho home. Miss Cameron
claims that the child is more than 14
years of agp and capable of selecting
her own guardian, but Choo Bing Quoia
claims that ?he is only 13 and not en
titled to a choice.
What l^nds interest to the ca.Â«e is the
fact that the little maid is r>ossessed of
means. Her father. Chew Bing Quoia,
xvho died last Jun<>, was a contractor.
It was popularly supposed that his
widow lived in China, but when his
will was offered for probate the woman
who now claims the right to have the
custody of Ah Young came forward
and announced herself as the widow
ar.d claimed his estate by the terms of
the will. Most of the estate, which con
sists principally of cash, came into her
hand?, and she would have received all
of it but for the appearance through
Attorney Vogelsang of the widow in
China. The lawyer claims that the San
Francisco -widow was but a servant of
the contractor and not entitled to any
of his wealth.

William Conley and Edward Terry
went out for a ride in the Ashbury
Park-district the other day. They had
an empty delivery wagon and appar
ently had no definite Idea of what they
were going to fill it with. A policeman
watched them long and earnestly, but
they saw him first and drove along
without attempting to secure a cargo.
Finally the policeman placed them un
der arrest. Their record was looked
into and it was discovered that Con
ley had served a long term at San
Quentln for burglary. Both men had
been convicted several times of mis
demeanors and served terms In the
County Jail. Judge Mogan told them
plainly yesterday that he .was satisfied
they were thieves and that they took
the wagon out to Ashbury Park for the
purpose of oarrying away any plunder
they mights secure. He Instructed the
police to ascertain if any depredations
had been committed in that section of
the city and If, there have been any
he will give the two prisoners the limit
in the County Jail. 'Â¦
Mary Hannon came down Howard
street Monday evening In an independ
ent frame of mind. In crescendo tones
she declared that she did not care for
the laws, the police, the public, the
heavens or the earth or the waters that
are under the earth. She said she had
a job. At the corner of Fourth street
the observant gaze of a policeman rest
ed on Mary. He had only been on the
force fourteen years, but even to him
it was apparent that she had been lap
ping up more liquid Incentive to crime
than was consistent with the peace and
dignity of the city. So he halted Mary
in the middle of an apostrophe and
gave her a ride In a nice blue wagon.
When she appeared before Judge Mo
gan yesterday she had lost In a large
measure her spirit of independence, but
she still maintained that she had a job,
and offered several newspaper clippings
as documentary evidence of the fact.
She said she was a stenographer. Some
delver into days that are gone pro
duced from the police records the fact
that Mary had formerly nerved two
terms in the County Jail for outbreaks
similar to that of Wednesday night, so
Judge Mogan sentenced her to another
three months \n the same resort. Mary
now has a job on the square.

Edward Smith has spent the last four
nights on Market street trying to dis
pose of "phony" rings to pedestrians.
Hig industry was rewarded by his be
ing arrested for vagrancy. He told
Judge Mogan yesterday that he was
a miner from Keswick and had reached
the city with $40, which he spent. In
addition to a debilitated stomach and
a throbbing head he secured, In return

Joseph McKay, who tried to hide his
identity under the name of Joseph
Murphy, came before Judge Mogan yes
terday on the charge of malicious mis
chief. He was accused of having tried
to batter down the door of a lodging
house at 256 Minna street, owned by
Mrs. Whitted. Failing in this purpose
he took a club and smashed half a
dozen windows. There was no ap
parent reason for his action, as the
landlady did not know him. He told
Judge Mogan that he had no recollec
tion of the occurrence and believed he
was temporarily deranged. Judge Mo
gan concluded that a rest cure would
do his mind good and will sentence him
to-day. McKay belongs to a famous
family of crooks and he and his brother
are now being held to the Superior
Court on the charge of highway rob
bery. Both' of them have been arrested
half a dozen times on felony charges,
but have managed to escape conviction.
The inmates of the Napa State Hos
pital for the Insane may not be as ra
tional in a general sense as their fel
low beings outside of that institution,
but on the special topic of turkey their
process of reasoning cannot be ques
tioned. Owing to the lack of funds and
the high price of birds, turkey was not
served at the Thanksgiving dinner at
the asylum in this year of grace. The
patients and the help noted the defi
ciency in the dinner. The comment took
on the form of remonstrance and there
was a disposition to hold the State ad
ministration responsible for the failure.
The subject was discussed at a meet
ing of the State Commission In Lunacy
day before yesterday, and the Commis
sioners advised Dr. Elmer E. Stone,
superintendent of the Napa Asylum,
to go ahead, regardless of expense, and
provide a bounteous supply of turkeys
for Christmas dinner at the asylum.
Dr. Stone, now having authority to ex
ceed the regular allowance in this spe
cial instance, proposes to go ahead with
preparations for the Christmas feast.
He is on the lookout for turkeys and
will capture them, dead or alive.
j The directors of the Veterans' Home
noted with some surprise that the
Thanksgiving dinner at that institu
tion cost $700, as the price of turkey
ranged from 24 to 30 cents a pound. A
proposition to go slow on preparations
for the Christmas dinner did not ap
peal to the board's sense Of piety or
patriotism. It was determined to du
plicate the Thanksgiving feast so far
as turkevs were concerned and to add
several other good things to the feast.

Beron, the left fielder of the Fifteenth
Infantry, in the first of the seventh
made long throws from deep left to the
home plate. Bennett on third played
an errorless game, getting two put-outs
on very hard throws. The work of
Bankston and Henderson was first
class all through. The work of Banks
ton In critical times was all that couid
be asked of any one, although the. ball
was damp at times.
Lieutenant Elliott, who is manager
for the team, was so pleased with the
work that he took them as his guests
to the Alcazar Theater last night to
witness the military play, "The Girl
I Left Behind Me."
The target practice which has been
going on at the Presidio bluffs since
Monday was concluded, yesterday aft
ernoon. The trials were eminently sat
isfactory in every particular, and bar
ring a little fog the weather was good.
Yesterday morning Major Todd, Cap
tain Burgess and Lieutenant Covington
superintended the work. The weather
was perfect and all conditions were of
the most favorable order. All the rapid
firing guns were put into practice, and
the results meet the approval of all con

Thomas is scheduled to sail from San
Francisco for the Philippines on the 1st
of January. Either of these boats will
take Christmas boxes free of charge if
they are for officers or enlisted men of
the army, navy or marine corps. Each
box should be plainly addressed to the
individual for whom it Is intended, giv
ing his ship if he be in the navy, or his

boxes should be sent care of the depot

TEAM DOES GOOD WORK.
a year he and his wife have been sep
arated an-1 divorce proceedings are
pending between them in the Santa
Rosa courts. He has been ordered by
the civil court to make provision for
the support of the little girl, the issue
of the marriage, but his pleas of pov
erty have sufficed to keep him from
being jailed for not complying with
the order. At the hearing of the crim
inal charge yesterday the defendant,
told of ill-health, so that he was not
able to make any money out of his real
estate business, and said that he was
compelled to borrow money to pay his
own expenses. The attorney for his
wife, the complaining witness, told the
court that when the defendant was in
Petaluma he wore diamonds, but when
he came to San Francisco he hid his
jewels. Tii<2 counsel for the defendant
branded this statement as maliciously
false and intimated that the utterer of
it was a notorious liar, any way.
"Where did you get those clothes?"
asked the special prosecutor of the de
fendant, Hargreaves explained that
their acquisition antedated the begin
ning of his matrimonial difficulties.
The attorney's eye happened to catch
sight of a low overcoat left on a chair
by the defendant. "Where did you get
that overcoat?" The defendant admit
ted that it was a recent purchase
which cost him $5. "Your Honor,"
said the special prosecutor, "this man
has money to buy overcoats for him
self, but he says he cannot keep his
little girl from going hungry. Why, on
his real estate circulars he has the
words printed 'Money to loan.' Why
doesn't he borrow some money from
himself and give it to his little girl for
proper clothing and food?" The argu
ment struck Judge Mogan as conclus
ive and he ordered the father to pungle
before Christmas on pain of going to
a dungeon cell for the holiday season.
Samuel C. Hargreaves will have to
secure $10 somehow and pay it over for
the support of his 10-year-old daughter,
Mignon, some time before Santa Claus
appears, or otherwise he will spend his
Christmas in jail. The father says it is
almost an impossible task, as he is so
steeped in poverty that, compared to
him, Lazarus might be considered a
trust magnate. But Judge Mogan has
spoken and his word is as the law of
the Medes. The judgment was ren
dered yesterday when the father ap
peared in rourt to answer to a warrant
charging nim with failure to provide
for a minor child. The defendant is
a real estato dealer at Fetaluma. For
hat which he had when brought to the
prison was missing. It was embarrass
ing, because it was the only one he had
with him, and nothing is more impair
ing to a man's dignity than to be
obliged to tread the streets without any
headgear. He spoke to the jailer, and
a thorough search for the hat was
made. Â¦ It was finally found, tucked
snugly away under the waistcoat of
Herbert Wood, who had sought 'the
shelter of the prison as a lodger. Both
men were before Judge Cabaniss -yes
terday. Wood said he had no i/itention
of stealing Isaacs' hat. He was merely
introducing a variation on the old
game, "Thi'mble. thimble, who's got the
thimble." He will sleep for the next
fifteen nights in jail, but not as a vol
untary lodger.

The British ship Kensington, which
arrived yesterday, seventy-seven days
from Newcastle, Australia, narrowly
escaped destruction in a cyclone nine
days after starting across the Pacific.
She left Newcastle September 30, and
was fairly well treated by the weather
until latitude 31.30 south, longitude
1GS.20 east, was reached. This was on
October 9. The barometer dropped to
2S.S7 and a full-sized cyclone came tear
ing out of the northeast. The storm
continued for sixteen hours, during
which time the Kensington's deck was
filled to the rails with tumbling, surg
ing water. Two ports were washed
away and the starboard side of the
charihouse was stove In. Other damage
was done, but considering the velocity
of the gale the vessel escaped with re
markably few bruises. Fine weather
followed the cyclone and -continued
with the Kensington until she reached
this port.
Her cargo consisted of 2727 tons of
coal. Captain Borland reports that
October 3 he was in company with the
British ship Alice off Lord Howe Isl
and.

A speedy hearing will be given in the
Superior Ccurt to the injunction pro
ceedings brought by some of the whole
sale produce dealers to restrain the
Board of Harbor Commissioners from
preventing them from doing business
on the State wharves.
The action of the Harbor Commis
sioners in revoking certain permits of
the wholesale dealers for violation of
the Woodward law is the sole matter
to be adjudicated by the courts. Presi
dent Spear of the commission said yes
terday that the matter was now in
the hands of the attorney for the
beard and a speedy settlement was
locked for.
"We do not desire to be harsh in this
matter." said President Spear, "but we
do not propose to have a lot of delay by
legal tactics. Either our action is right
or we are in th<Â» wrong, and we want
to know it as quickly as possible for
th*Â» benefit of the public."
W. H. DaviF, attorney for the Harbor
Commissioner?, paid yesterday that the
only question to be decided by the
courts waf a very simple one.
â¢â¢Complaint was made to the Com
missioners," said Attorney Davis, "that
the Woodward law had been violated
by certain of the produce dealers. The
dealers were summoned to appear be
fore the board and answer to the com
plaints. They did appear and a hear
ing was given to them. The result of
that hearing was that nine of the per
mits of the dealers were revoked.
"Some of the dealers then brought
injunction proceedings before the Supe
rior Court to restrain the Commission
ers from interfering with the dealers in
doing business on the State wharves.
"The complaint of the dealers simply
charged that they had not been sum
moned to appear and had not been
given a hearing by the Commissioners,
as required by the Woodward law.
They do not attack the constitution
ality of the law.
"We have filed our answer to the in
junction proceedings, and claim that
the dealers were duly summoned and
piven a hearing. The matter can be de
cided by the courts in an hour.
"I have arranged with Attorney J. B.
Reinstein. who represents the dealers,
to meet Superior Judge Sloss next Sat
urday morning and ask the Judge to
pet a date for the hearing of the pro
ceedings. If Judge Sloss finds his cal
endar is too crowded I will ask the
Presiding Judge of the Superior Court
to assign the cause to another court.
"I hope that the matter can be taken
up in the course of the coming week,
so that we can get a speedy decision."
L. G. Sresovich of the L. R. Srcso
vich Company stated yesterday that his
firm had been misrepresented In the
proceedings before the Harbor Commis
sioners.
"I have a permit from the board,"
said Sresovich, "but I have not done
business on the wharves for many
years. Personally I do not care for the
permit, and if the Commissioners de-
Eire to revoke it they can do so. I
don't care for it anyway." ,
~ The funeral of the late Dr. Jchn Wes
ley Hamilton took place yesterday at
Odd Fellows' Cemetery,' when- a large
number of the deceased's friends gath
ered to pay their last respect?.
The,. chapel was crowded with men
and women of the profession
and of private life, ami th.^ eulogies
delivered were deep in admiration of
the departed.
In Dr. Hamilton's will is the sentence:
"I am a believer in God and immortal
life," and the words of Rev. Jay Wil
liam Hudson, pastor of the Second
Unitarian Church, who read the ser
vice, were in sympathy with the belief
of the dead.
The service began with Rev. Mr.
Hudson reading Ingersoll's "Address at
a Child's Grave," following which the
reverend gentleman read passages from
the New Testament, and before the
committal spoke of the clnsms sen
tence in the late Dr. Hamilton'.* will in
which he declared his belief in God
and tha future life.
Miss ZIta Fahey then rendered "Lead,
Kindly Light," and then Dr. D. Maclean
delivered a beautiful eulogy, raying in
part:
"Dr. Hamilton will be missed from
that institution he so much honorsd.
He had the confidence of his associates
and the love and respect of his stu
dents. He was a forceful teacher,
capable of expressing his thyushts in
vigorous language and Imparting hs
ripe and ever maturing knowledge and
experience. The Creator creatod great
er men, but never a better man.*'
Miss Fahey sang the beautiful hymn.
"Nearer My God to Thee." vli>6 H. M.
Owens voiced feeling sentlmc-nts.of re
gard for the departed..
Mr. Owens said that they had as
sembled, associates, friends and stu
dents, to pay the last and solemn du
ties they owed their friend. The Cali
fornia Medical College had been one of
his cherished children from its incep
tion. In his career as a physician Dr.
Hamilton was distinguished by his k<?Â£n
wit, a bright and vigorous style and a
bright range of subjects. His ability
was appreciated by a wid? circie of'pa
tients, friends and colaborers. No man
who ever went to Dr. John Wesley
Hamilton naked but that he clothed
him, hungry but that he gave him food;
thirsty but what he gave him drink.
No student ever had to forego the
pleasure of graduating on account of
being behind in his fees, for Dr. Ham
ilton ever held out a helping haod.
Mrs. Hamilton>. widow of Dr. Ham
ilton, and Mrs. Dr. M. V. Higgins, the
doctor's daughter, were present at the
services at the cemetery.
The pallbearers were the following
students of the California Medical Col
lege: C. A. Hascall, W. S. Bryon, \V.
W. Wimer. J. F. Traveres. Walter
Cheeney. J. Higgins. W. J. Lawrence,
George Grunwell. The entire faculty
acted as honorary pallbearers-.

VFW YORK. Dec. 17â Today's quiet stock ;
tr.a'ket xvas not materially difTf rÂ«>nt In charac- i
te*- from that Of yesterday. The transactions j
wrre lareÂ»!y conducted In a few spe-ialtieg and ;
the dealings in those were supposed to have |
their orUrtn in the board room. The simula
tion in Amalgamated Copier was still active ;
and that stock Â»kÂ« the vehicle fur a large part ,
of the opÂ« rations of the profwsicnal traders. ,
The larjre foreign demand for co[.fÂ«r was "- i
KiKT>e1 as the motive of the buying. The Mock j
reacted sharp 1 * >' â¢Â«* the * aUer P art of the day Â¦
and this was effective, together with the weak- Â«
ness developed in Brooklyn Transit, in forcing |
the whole list to a lower level.
The selling of Brooklyn Rapid Transit waÂ« :
<;u:te obvicruKly profit taking on the recent con- j
ndÂ«rs.ble rising In the stock with a large specu
lative following. Ae Sugar has moved upward ;
lor many days in expectation of the Cuban re- i
clproclty action, the movement to take profits |
xvsa fully norroal. The balance of the day's j
principal business was done in United States
Ptee! preferred. The rtock was conspicuous j
throughout. The understanding that the struc- I
tural Fteel pool h2d agref-d to maintain prices
was favorably interpreted and there was much 1
current quotation cf more hopcf-jl views of the I
outlook in the trade. The day's news had vari- !
nun favorable features, but the central stock ]
list failed to respond. The Bale of tlO.OnO.OUO
cf Atcbison bonds cost thÂ« stock a point in its
priie. although the awakened capacity of the
market to absorb new bond issu's was not a
â¢ .- .. . i- Â¦ : factor. The incident was mide
the occasion icr Â»-orne renewed conjecture as to
how far the lncreas^-d facilities of the money |
market whirh are expecttd to develop after the
new year rill be encroached upon by require
ment* by railroad borrowings. The sterling ex
â¬;ha!ijre merket moved strongly away from thp
gold imiÂ»orT iwijnt. Demand for remittance for
year-end obligations continued large and the
Â»?uppjy of cotton bill* Fhcwcd some dimunitlcn.
The promiM- of easy money conditions deprived
â¢!Â¦â¢ movement in the txchanpe market of any
disturbing Influenc*?. The reported intention to
fhut down anthracite proouction for the wec-k
Bt holidays was locked upon as evidence cf the
continued unfavorable condition In that trade,
and the coolers were somewhat pressed for
eale. The rate of Increase 'of railroad grops
â¢stmUX* for the firft wÂ»<>k in December for
roads thus far rcpvttas has risen to near fi per
cent, rempared with a rate of increase of Ies3
than 3 per cent for the fourth week In Novem
ber, efmrared with last year's corresponding
periods. .

CHICAGO, Dec. 17.â Wheat opened firm In
sympathy with a similar feeling â¢ from Liver
pool. Some emphasis was added by small re
ceipts In the Northwest. The firmness in the
foreign market was partly due to bad weather
reports from Argentina, but a cablegram to
a Chicago commission firm from Rosario said
that the weather was Improving and Jhat lit
tle damage had been done to the wheat crop.
At the same time the Me bull Interest here
manifested a tendency to dispose of holdings.
This fact exerted considerable Influence upon
email holders. As a -â¢ Â»eult of the combination
of circumstances a good deal of long wheat
came out and an easier tone developed. May
Belling off to 81^6'SlHc, after opening a shade
lower to a shade higher at 81%c to 81%c. The
high point of the day was reached shortly after
the opening, when May touched 81 %c. The
market held steady at the decline for a time
and during the latter part of the session a
better tone was manifested on reports of an
active export business. The cash business
phowed marked improvement and this helped
the speculative trade. The close was steady,
with May unchanged at M-'MiMViC.
Corn did not hold up as well as of late.
The weather continued fine and reports from
Nebraska said that farmers were disposed to
sell tholr cash corn a little more freely. May
closed Mt@Vio lowier at 43Â»Â£e.
After a pteady opening oats eased off in
sympathy with corn. May closed a shade
lower at 3C%c.
Hogs were In much emaller supply than ex
pected, and this act, coupled with an advance
of CiglCc in their price, resulted in a good
deal of covering in provisions by local shorts.
There was also a good demand from English
houses. Packers were moderate sellers on the

and the death penalty will no doubt
be imposed, as the Jury made no rec
ommendation for mercy.
A jury in Judge Lawior's department
of the Superior Court last evening, aft
er deliberating for twenty-five minutes,
returned \ a verdict of murder in the
first degree against Henry Milton, alias
Lupton. who held up and robbed James
Gilleece on the morning of April 15 on
Eleventh street, between Mission and
Market.
Shortly ' after midnight on April 15
Gilleece, an aged saloon-keeper on
Ninth street, closed his establishment
and started homeward. "While passing
a dark alley on Eleventh street he wa3
confronted by Milton and ordered to
throw ud his hands. The old man, in
stead of complying with the demand,
grabbed* his assailant and a struggle
ensued. Milton then fired a shot at his
victim, causing him to release his hold.
At this juncture Patrolmen D. J. Keo
hane and T. F. Slattery. who were in
the neighborhood, arrived on the scene
and the desperate criminal snapped his
revolver at the officers, but the car
tridges failed to explode. After a hand
to-hand battle Milton wad finally over
powered and taken to the City Prison.
Gilleece was removed to the Central
Emergency Hospital and subsequently
died at another institution from the ef
fect of his wound.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 17.â Mrs. Harry L.
Smith and her two young sons were burned to
death by a fire In their home at . Oaklane.
Mrs. i Klizabeth Shellmlre was badly burned
while endeavoring to awaken them.
-Mrs. Rodgers was confined to her
bed yesterday, claiming to be suffering
from her injuries. She denied that she
ever struck the wife of Louis F. Mar
e-hall. She asserts that when the men
came upon her she thought they were
footpads and she tried to run away,
but they followed her and struck her
to the ground.
Mrs. Rodgers believes that the Mar
shalls tried to injure her because of a
quarrel they had with E. J. Smith,
her brother-in-law. She claims she
could not have scratched Mrs. Mar
shall, because her nails are too short,
she having bitten them for year.s.
The Marshalls are well-known race
track men. Louis Marshall said last
night that he and his brother called
upon Mrs. Rodgers Wednesday even
ing to remonstrate with her for strik
ing Louis' wife. They did not find
her in, but met her on the corner and
immediately upon seeing them she
struck at them with her umbrella.
Louis says he did not strike Mrs.
Rodgers nor did his brother do so.
Louis Marshall claims that the rea
son Mrs. Rodgers assaulted his wife
was because of a quarrel she had w^th
her brother-in-law over the manage
men of the racehorse Mansard. He
claims that Mansard is Mrs. Rodgers 1
property and that he and Jennings
cleared up $59,000 in Chicago on the
race the animal won there, "which
made Mrs. Rodgers Jealous."
The case of Louis F. and George A.
Marshall, the brothers who are ac
cused by Mrs. Harry Rodgers of hav
ing wa'-laid and beaten her last Wed
nesday night, came up in the Police
Court yesterday, but was postponed
until- next Wednesday morning be
cause of the inability of the prosecut
ing witness to appear in court- Mrs.
Louis F. Marshall attempted to secure
a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Rodg
ers, but Judge Conlon. declined to issue
it while the present case is pending..
Mrs. Marshall alleges that Mrs. Rodg
ers struck her at the race track.
Mrs. Sadie Rodgers Has Louis F. and
George A. 3Iarshall Arrested for

Leon D. Neate, ex-night clerk at the
â¢Plymouth Hotel, - Bush and Jones
streets, who was arrested on Wednes
day by Detectives Dinan and Wren for
stealing .Jewelry and other articles
from rooms of the guests at the hotel,*
will have at least three charges of
burglary booked against hlniT~ The
three complaining witnesses will be
Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Brown and Her
bert Thompson.
Neate denied yesterday that he ever
had any intention of poisoning Nathan
Carr, the. pawnbroker at 51â¬ \' z Dupont
street,, but averred that the poisqned
cocktail v was for himself. He had a
presentiment that he was to be ar
rested and - purchased' the strychnine
to be prepared for death rather than
for disgrace. If the detectives had*been
half an â¢ hour longer in making their
appearance, he said, they would have
found his dead body.
Against this statement it is pointed
out as peculiar that Neate, shortly be
fore he went out for the cocktails,
asked Carr. to show him the inside of
the safe in the store. Carr 1 thought the
request a most unusual one, but com
plied with it. The police think it is
just possible, that Neate might have
had a thought in his mind to poison
Carr, and v rob the safe ef its contents.
Attorney -W. J. . Herrin, son, of the
proprietress of the hotel, had: a long
talk .with' Neate in' the city prison
yesterday. . Neate admitted to him
that he had stolen articles from dif
ferent rooms and had sold most.of the
plunder to Carr. He said he had been
assisted by a bellboy, but the police
do not believe him . and are satisfied
that Neate was alone in the thefts."He
sold the stolen jewelry to Carr under
the name *of Bryant."
Neate came to the city last August
and had been employed as night clerk
in the hotel for three months. In his
pockets a letter was found that he had
written to Ben Burridge, 78S Clayton
street. He asked Burridge for a loan,
as he was "dead broke" and promised
to repay him double the amount. He
also wrote that his father and mother
had come to the city and had taken
up their residence at 1032 Van Nes3
avenue. "This latter statement, the de
tectives say, is untrue.

Was " Intended for Himself
