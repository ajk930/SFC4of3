BUDAPEST, Hungary. Nov. 4.â Count
Steven TIsza's first appearance la the ca

of the Hungarian Diet to-day showed
that the opposition Is determined to
maintain its obstructive tactics. The new
Ministers waited two hours while opposi
tion members made speeches on the sub
ject of Count Apponyi's resignation of the
presidency of the House. Finally Count
Tisza at the head of the Cabinet entered
the House and demanded that the Em
peror's letter appointing him Premier
should be read so that he could proceed
with business. This was the signal for
turbulent scenes. Amid the uproar the
clerk of the House read the Emperor's
letter, but he was quite inaudible. Count

but in the general tumult he could not be
heard, and the sitting was suspended.

i
y TT Q ASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â The
Bag State Department to-day re
m Ml J celved a prompt request from
the representatives of the
revolutionary Government at
Panama that the United States recognize
the new State of Panama, but pending
official advices from the United States
Consular officer that a new Government
has been established and Is a de facto
government, the State Department de
clined to commit itself. However, atten
tion was called to the fact that It was the
invariable policy of the United States to
deal with the de facto Government in any
country. This statement is taken as fa
vorable to recognition should the new
Panama Government have an active ex
istence.
Early this mornlnsr news was received
of the shelling of Panama by the Colom
bian gunboat Bogota, and â¢ Instructions
were at once cabled to the United States
Vice Consul there to protest against this
bombardment, while the commander of
the cruiser Boston was directed to pre
vent the Bogota resuming firing. It early
became apparent that this Government In
tended to take active steps to protect life
and property on the isthmus and to take
an advanced position. Instructions were
cabled to* commanders of warships on the
way to the isthmus, or already there, to
resort to any necessary measures to pre
vent bloodshed.
NAVAL ORDERS INTERCEPTED.
The situation at the two ends of the
railway, Panama and Colon, Is anoma
lous, and late to-night it developed that
the Colon situation was the result of
plans of the Navy Department miscarry
ing.
The dispatches to the Nashville, which
should have reached her immediately
upon her arrival at Colon on November
2. were intercepted and were not received
by Commander Hubbard until after trie
Colombian gunboat Carthagena arrived
at Colon with 600 . Colombian troops
aboard, when It was too late to prevent
her entrance to the harbor. The execu
tion of the original scheme would have
eliminated the Carthagena from the sit
uation at Colon and the present unfortu
nate complications would have been
averted.
To-morrow, it is expected, further ef
forts will be made on the part of "the new
Government of Panama to obtain recog
nition at the hands of the United States'.
LANDING OF BLUE JACKETS.

REBEL SUCCESS EXPECTED.
United States Takes Prompt Steps to
Protect Interests.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â United States
Vice-consul- Ehrman at Panama cabled
the State Department under to-day's date
that the Colombian Government warship
Bogota was shelling the city. One Chi
nese had been killed. Ehrman was in
structed to protest against . the bombard
ment.
If the Consul's protest is not sufficient
the commander of the United States gun
boat Boston, which Is by this time on her
way to Panama from. San Juan del Sur,
600 miles distant, will promptly seize the
Colombian gunboat, if necessary, to stop
the bombardment.
The bombardment Is In violation of all
the rules of war, beginning as it did with
out the required notice. Moreover, the
United States Government takes the
ground that It certainly Interferes with
the freedom of transit across the Isth
mus, which this Government Is treaty
bound to maintain.
The greatest activity was exhibited in
the State and Navy departments this
morning and there were frequent consul
tations between the officials, the naval of
ficers particularly being Intent on work-
Ing out the details of the plan for protec
tion of the Isthmian traffic, outlined by
the State Department.
it is quite evident that the navy is mak

years,, and the. fact. Is not disguised that
all the information that has come from
secret agents point to the .ultimate suc
cess of the revolution. But meanwhile
extremely delicate questions are to be an

The Prefect of Colon to-day received
the following letter from the- commander
of the Nashville:
"Sir: The condition of affairs at Pan
ama, I am advised, is such that any
movement of the Colombian troops now
at Colon to that neighborhood must bring
about a conflict and threaten the free and
uninterrupted transit of the Isthmus,
which the Government of the United
States is pledged to maintain. I have,
therefore, the honor to notifv you that
I have directed the superintendent of the
railroad that he must not transport on
his line troops either of the Government
or of the opposition party.
"Trusting that this action on my part
will meet with your cordial acquiescence,
I have the honor to be, very respectfully.

COLON, Colombia, Nov. 4.âWith
out the firing of a gun and amid
scenes of great enthusiasm, the
independence of the isthmus and
the department of Panama was
declared last evening.
The city of Panama Is now in the hands
of revolutionists and no serious attempt
has been made to recapture It. The Co
lombian gunboat Bogota arrived in the
harbor after the declaration of Independ
ence and threw a few shells Into the city
without doing damage to life or property.
Perfect order prevails In Colon to-night
and transisthmlan trains are running as
usual, without interruption. In Panama
the flag of the new republic, in colors of
red, white and blue, floats over the Gov
ernment buildings.
The movement' for independence has
been in progress since the rejection by
the Congress in Bogota of the Hay-Her
ran canal treaty, but its sudden ripening
last night was due to the news of the
unexpected arrival at Colon of the Co
lombian gunboat Carthagena, with Gen
erals Tovar and Amaya and a. number of
troops.
BACKED BY LEADING MEN.
The movement has been promoted by
prominent and wealthy isthmians and
Governor Obaldla of the Department of
Panama, who arrived at Panama at 5:30
o'clock last evening, on computing the
troops and citizens in favor of independ
ence found that they numbered at least
1500. The advocates of independence, in
both Panama and Colon, are now jubi
lant.
The presence of the United States gun
boat Nashville at Colon is believed to
have resulted in the avoidance of serious
trouble. \ As the result of a conference
here, Colonel Torres, commanding the
troops, has sent on a special train to
Panama a representative to confer with
General Tovar, whose unconditional re
lease is demanded.
In reliable quarters it is believed that
peaceful results will follow a proposal
made to Colonel Torres that the American
troops shall return to the Nashville If
he guarantee to maintain order. This
proposal was to-night accepted by Col
onel Torres.
BRITISH MARINES MAY LAND.
The British Consul has suggested that,
if requested, a contingent of marines will
be sent to.Celon from the British cruiser
Amphion, now at Panama. It Is believed
that the Nashville will be hardly suffi
cient for all emergencies. It Is reported
that the United States gunboat Dixie will
soon arrive here. Public alarm In Colon
is 4 now somewhat abated, ihe act of
Independence has just been signed at Pa
nama. Â«-* *-. .
During the . excitement this afternoon
The woman who was in the plot was
Ellen Eagan, employed by Lewis. He re
fused her demands for money, and she
conspired with De Vau to kill Lewis, but
accomplices revealed the plot to Jerome,
NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â In the office of
District Attorney Jerome to-night, after
the arrest of one man and the detention
of a young and pretty woman, a story
vras told of a conspiracy to murder a
business man of some prominence.
Edward de Vau, 23 years old, whose
home is in Nova Scotia and who says his
occupation is that of private detective. Is
under arrest charged with having con
spired to murder Samuel Lewis, a manu
facturer of clothing at 117 Mercer street.
De Vau was arrested at the time when
he believed his accomplices were commit
ting the murder. He has refused to con
fess his crime and also has refused to
deny his guilt. He is an enigma to the
police.
In the opinion of District Attorney Je
rome and of the police and detectives who
have brought about the arrest of De Vau,
Lewis owes his life to the refusal of Wal
ter Nelson to take part in what probably
would have been a murder. The bludgeon
which was to have broken the skull of
the selected victim had been purchased.
De Vau's motive for the killing of Lewis
may have been robbery, as he explained,
but there are good reasons for believing
he was actuated more by jealousy and
a desire to put out of the way a man
whom he believed to be in love with the.
woman loved by himself than by the hope
of enriching himself.
Special Diiratch to The Call.
As the territory In question is a region

by perpetual ice and snow neither this
Government nor Canada cares much
about this strip, but there is a remote
possibility that future developments will

tion of sovereignty over the whole region
was not settled now.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4â An important
fact In conection with the recent delib
eration of the Alaskan boundary tribunal
appeared to-day when It became known
that a stretch of territory 140 miles in
length is still in dispute and is likely to
remain for some time. The significance
of the matter was not appreciated by the
Government until within the last two or
three days owing to an error in the trans
mission of the summary of the tribunal
award as cabled from London. A close
reading of this summary made it appear
that the members of the tribunal were
unable to determine, on account of a lack
of data, the exact course the boundary
should take along the short distance be
tween Kate's Needle and Devil's Thumb,
mountain peaks belonging to the main
range between British Columbia and Alas
ka. It now appears that the territory
still unawarded stretches north and
south more than 140 miles between Kate's
Needle and Devil's Paw.

TERRITORY
IN DISPUTE
The names of the murdered Armenians
were Agram Grigorian and Slgran Szml
cian. Their companion who escaped as
sassination was Reuben Glaberlaln.
It is believed that the identity of the as
sassin may remain unsolved unless he has
been previously In the hands of the po
lice, when the scars on his face may ren
der Identification easy.-
A member of th4 Armenian revolution
ary committee said to-night to the Asso
ciated Press correspondent: "The mur
derer is undoubtedly an Armenian, but
he Is not one of our people. He looks
like a man from the interior districts."
The costume of the assassin was of a
curious mixture. A new light overcoat
and a new black derby hat gave him a
respectable exterior, but his serge suit
was extremely ragged and his shoes were
much worn. His shirt was shabby, while
his underclothes were new and of fine
quality. In his pockets he carried a cloth
cap, apparently that said to have been
bought by the slayer of Sagouni on the
night of the latter's assassination. It is
evident that the plan of the assassin In
making his escape had been to discard
his overcoat and the derby hat and to
wear the cap. which would have given
him the appearance of a disreputable
street loafer, but his escape being cut off.
he determined to commit suicide rather
than to submit to capture. This series of
crimes has brought terror to the Armen
ians, who fear to leave their houses ex
cept under police protection.
The police, while believing that the mur
derer of Sagouni and the assassin of the
Armenians to-day are Identical, fearing: a
continuance of the murderous vendetta,
point to the ease with which the assassin
escaped them after the killing of Sagoun!.
It Indicates, they say, that the murderer
was harbored and given another set of
clothing by accomplices.
LONDON, Nov., 4.â The dramatic mur
der of Sagatel Sagouni, president of the
Armenian Revolutionary Society in Lon
don, on the night of October 26 was fol
lowed this afternoon by the assassination
of two more delegates to the Armenian
convention here. The suicide of the
assassin, though he has not yet been
identified, gives good reason to believe
that he also was the slayer of Sagouni-
The murders were carried out in the most
daring manner, more so than was the
assassination of Sagouni. They took
place In the early afternoon close to the
Armenian headquarters at Peckharn Rye.
The two victims were shot down from be
hind at close range. The murderer fired
twice at a third member of the group, but
missed him and then attempted tt>
fiee. Seeing that bis escape was cut off.
he drew another revolver and shot himself
with his left hand. It la considered a
significant fact that the assassin of Sa
gouni was also left-handed. .
The Government has received a reply
Jrom the Brazil.an Minister of Foreign
Affairs to the protest against the Rivera
Incident. Baron de Rio Eranco says he
laments that such trouble took place and
he will make an investigation. He an

frith the custody of Gcrnez. had gone to

pest; but the President replied: "I have

According to official dispatches from

Thomas R. A^eed. a tenant of Thome's,
explained at the time the old man de
parted that he had seen his landlord
packing a traveling bag; that Thorne had
drawn money from the bank, and had
intimated he intended to go East to find
Mrs. Crocker. The message from the ab
sentee verifies Reed's statement in every
particular. It also substantiates the po
lice theory.
Thorne, in addition to unfolding the se
cret of his latest venture within range
of Cupid's darts wrote that he was en-
Joying the best of health.
Charles V. S. Thorne, an eccentric oc
togenarian, who left his home at 1106 East
Twenty-fourth street on October 5 with
out announcing his departure, has bob
bed up in Des Moines, Iowa, as the hus
band of Mrs. Frances E. Crocker that
was. In a brief message to Attorney Gil
bert Wyman, -who had charge of the old
man's affairs, Thorne tells the story of
his matrimonial move, the fifth in a life
that has passed the eightieth milestone.
As soon as Wyman received word from
his aged client the po+ice were notified.
It had been reported two weeks ago that
Thorne had mysteriously disappeared.
The detectives, after investigation, de
clared that from numerous letters the,y
had found in Thome's residence they
were satisfied he had gone East on a
marrying expedition. Correspondence
with Mrs. Crocker was brought to light,
and ample evidence was disclosed to show
that the peculiar East Oaklander had set
out to win another bride.

If New York or Chicago bad a chance to
ties, but to-day that work was
dedicated to the use of the public, and
the. only wagon road tunnel in the Sta^p
was declared finished and a success.
There were special exercises for this
event, and the. people of Contra Costa
County and the people of Alameda Coun
ty, who have been more closely united by
this event, assembled to congratulate one
another. Supervisors, Mayors, public of
ficials and private! citizens met, first at
the tunnel at the summit of the ridge and
later in Oakland, and finally at the ban
quet table. The rain of the night before
and the threatening sky did not dampen
the ardor of those who had laborer! so
long and so earnestly for this result. The
affair was in charge of the tunnel com
mittee of the Merchants' Exchange and
the Boards of Supervisors of the two
counties. <
The exercises were, attended by a large
party of guests from Alameda County,
who were first taken on a tour of inspec
tion to the tunnel, where a basket lunch
was served, after which the party re
paired to Idora Park, where the formal
dedicatory exercises were held.
The Alameda County delegation left the
headquarters of the Merchants* Exchange
at 9:30 o'clock this morning, many of the
guests arriving late, as they thought that
the dedication would be postponed on ac
count of the threatening weather. It was
necessary to notify a number by tele
phone that the programme would be car
ried out rain or shine, and this delayed
the start nearly half an hour.
The party occupied three large buses,
and on the way to the tunnel Supervisor
H. D. Rowe pointed out the difficulties
which were overcome in building the new
road and called, attention to the great
amount of work which had been accom
plished In the last three months.
INSPECTION MADE.
On arriving at the tunnel the-ijarty was
given time to Inspect the work of the en
gineers, after which refreshments were
served. During the lunch, which was
spread In picnic fashion. Secretary Wil
bur Walker of the Merchants' Exchange
proposed the following tc-ast: "The Inter
county tunnelâ may it be the forerunner
of many similar children of prosperity."
George H. Smith then called for three
cheers for the tunnel committee and the
Boards of Supervisors of both counties,
and the cheers were glven^wlth a will.
The members of the party who visited
the tunnel this morning were:
Supervisor H. D. Rowe, J. F. W. Sohst, Wil

J. F. W. Sohst, chairman of the tunnel
committee, opened the literary pro
gramme with a short history of the work
done by the Merchants'. Exchange In be
half of the tunnel.. He said In part:
The barrier which has kept Alameda and
Contra Costa counties apart for more than half
a century and hindered our development has
been removed by the Inter-county tunnel, and
the present generation and those to come after
us will, enjoy the fruit which p iblic spirited
citizens have prepared for them.

For almost a quarter of a century the
road lay on the hillside uncompleted and
the Contra Costa County residents con
tinued to use the old roads and meet
with disaster and injury until the Mer
chants' Exchange of Oakland took the
matter in hand. They found It neces
sary to secure the passage of a special
law that would permit counties to build
inter-county tunnels. This was done and
then it was found that more of the tun
nel was in Contra Costa County than in
Alameda. The exchange then undertook
to raise by private subscription enough
money in Oakland to make the cost of
the same to the little county across tho
hills as to the larger county to the. east.
This was done and nearly $12,000 raised,
of which $10,000 was paid to the Contra
Costa Supervisors and the balance ex
pended upon the Alameda County side of
the hill. The subscriptions to this fund
were:
acquire & scenic road like the one Ratilng up
to the tunnel each would pay a million dollars
or more for it. How does It come to our city?
No public meetings. No petition to the City
Council. No bond election. Nj issuing of
bonds. "Without spendinn one cent, this mag
nificent improvement is dropped into Oakland's
lap
Mr. Sohst, as chairman of the tunnel
committee, then formally turned the tun
nel over to President Theodore Gier of
the Merchants' Exchange, who accepted
It in the name of the exchange and then
presented the completed work to the Su
pervisors of Contra Costa and Alameda
counties.
The address of the day was delivered
by Senator E. K. Taylor of Alameda,
who pointed out the beneilt the tunnel
would be to the two counties. Short
speeches were mpde by Supervisors
Mitchell and Rowe of Alameda County
and Chairman Wightman of the Cqntra
Costa County Board of Supervisors.
The history of the inter-county tunnel
Is an interesting one, extending back to
the early '70s. In those days the popu
lous part of Contra Costa County was
in the agricultural valleys in the Interior.
It was the desire of the farmers of that
section to reach tide water at Oakland,
ami several roads were built across the
hills. But these roads were run upon
lines that Involved the greatest economy
of construction and grades were not care
fully considered. But stages were run
from Oakland to various parts of the
neighboring county and travel and traffic
came from the Alameda County side of
the hills.
Then it was that the late L. W. Kenne
dy conceived the idea of building a toll
road across these hills with a tunnel that
would permit of easy grade upon each
side. He organized a private company
for the purpose and the road was built to
the mouth of the proposed tunnel. Work
was begun upon the hole in the hill, but
a rush of water was struck to the extent
that it collapsed the tunnel and the com
pany at the same time.

CUPID'S URGING
FORCES JOURNEY
Nelson was to have appeared in court
on the first Monday of October. Instead
h<Â» says that he came to the Pacific Coast
in quest of a man who owed him money.
He will not give the man's name nor the
amount, and the police are disinclined to
believe the story, as it does not seem pos
sible that Nelson would be willing to for
te5t $5000 which had been put up by his
friends had he not some reason for wish
ing to escape justice. Nelson says that
his wife and child are residing at the
present time at jO7 Eleventh street, Oak
land. An investigation last night dis
closed the fact that th^re is no such num
ber In either Kast or West Oakland.
FICTITIOUS ADDRESS.
In explanation of the arrest Nelson says
that some time ago his brother, John O.
Nelson, was arrested and convicted on a
charge of murder in the 6econd degree.
While the case was on appeal the defend
ant, who was out on bonds, went to Okla
homa and was prevented from appearing
flt the next session of the court by the
Kansas floods. Nelson, who is in jail here,
claims that he had incurred the displeas
ure of Circuit Judge Thomas Flannelly by
criticising him severely In his petition for
an appeal, and that the Judge had a war.
rant sworn out for his arrest on a charge
of having obstructed justice by secreting
a prisoner. He was released on $j000
bonds, and says that he soon afterward
went to St. Louis to promote an oil
Fcheme.
Nelson cays he was an attorney in Cof
feevllle, Kan. He has many letters from
prominent persons, but most of them are
in relation to the advancement of some
enterprise. He is a glib talker and does
not belie the circular in that respect.
Since leaving Kansas he has grown a
mustache and chin whiskers. It was
clever work on the part of the detective
in recognizing him, for Tils appearance
has changed considerably. He boasts of
his family connections and of high social
relation* in the plaeÂ« from which he
comes.
XELSON'S EXPLANATION.
Nelson pave t>on<Js hrrÂ© in the rum of $0000
for his appearance at the District Criminal
Court of Montgomery Countr, Kejis. He fail
ed to appear and his bond has been forfeited
and a t*n<*h warrant issued. Nelson Us a good
talker, and always has tome scheme on loot.
He will talk law. horse or any old thing, and
is fairly well jx>sted on the sreneral topics
of the day. He /ias a wife and & little girl
with h!m.
At thÂ» request of the Sheriff of Mont
gomery County, Kansas, David R. Nel
son, who claims to be an attorney, was
arrested yesterday afternoon and is now
held at the City Prison. The arrest was
made by Detective Tim BaHey at Clay
and Drumm streets. Bailey recognized
Nelson from a circular received by the
local police department. The specific
charge for which the prisoner la wanted
is not known, owing to the fact that
Captain of Detectives Martin has been
unable to receive additional details, but
It is supposed to be a grave one. The
circular on which the arrest was made
contains the following:
With nearly an Inch of rain as the rec
ord for Â¦ the opening of the first
storm of the winter, residents of the
Frultvale district within the city limits
have increased their clamor for protec
tion against the storm water drained upon
the streets from the outside hill slopes.
A condition, peculiar to the double-headed
government, city and county, that Oak
land bends under, is met in the efforts of
City Engineer P. C. Turner, backed by
the City Council and the administration,
to afford the desired relief.
All of the storm water that runs in tor
rents into the low places, stretching east
ward from Nineteenth avenue, through
the Twenty-third-avenue business district
and on toward Fruitvale, is from rainfall
on the sloping watershed that Is entirely
outside of municipal jurisdiction and en
tirely within, the County Board of Su
pervisors' political domain.
Appeal has been made to the board for
the relief by appropriation for construc
tion of a storm water drainage system,
tho county to contribute the greater por
tion of the money. But that appeal has
been met first by a construction of the
law blocking the work, then an attempt
to induce each Supervisor to make an ap
propriation from road district funds to
cover the needed amount. Down to date
the movement has lagged. There has not
been the spontaneous response that the
East Oaklanders would desire to be made
by the Supervisors.
The section most seriously affected Is
along East Fourteenth street, a connec
tion for the main traveled San Leandro
road into Oakland. Because City En
gineer Turner has been active in trying
to remedy conditions he has been the
target for criticism from county officials,
who asserted that he was not warranted
in so-called Interference. Sentiment has
been strongly aroused In East Oakland
concerning the apparent delay in reach
ing a settlement of the financial difficulty.
So far as the city of Oakland Is con
cerned it is estimated that the taxpay
ers contribute 70 per cent to the county
roads funds, of which not one dollar is
expended within the city limits. This is
the result of liberal transfers by the
Board of Supervisors from the general
fund of the county to the various district
road funds.

TOWN AND GOWN
APPROVES BONDS
PHOENIX. Ariz., Nov. 4.â President B.
P. Kipley, Second Vice President Paul
Morton, Third Vice President J. W. Kon
drick and other officials of the Santa FÂ«
system arrived here early this, morning,
spent a few hours in Phoenix and- Mesa
City and continued their journey to Pres
cott and other northern points. The visit
is mainly for the purpose of Inspecting
the Santa Fe lines and connections In tha
Southwest. Judging from, the personnel
of the* gentlemen with whom the officials
were in conference it is supposed one mat
ter under consideration was the feasibil
ity of the construction of a branch of the
Santa Fe system from Mesa City to Gold
fleld, twenty miles long, cutting off that
much in the wagon haul necessary in tak
ing freight to the sito uf the Tonto stor
age dam, soon to be constructed. The
visit also give3 rise to further speculation
respecting the plans of the Santa Fa to
construct Its main line from a point in
New Mexico through the Gila and Salt
River valleys to Phoenix, thence north
west to the Colorado River south of Tha
Needlea. Should this be done, as is gen
erally believed it would be within the
next two or three years, the road wtlukl
avoid the heavy grades on tho present
line running through Northern Arizona.
That mental treatment of disease Is preva
lent as a fact is shown by the prominence of
the mind curlst, the Christian Scientist ana
the like. It is also more or less prominent
in osteopathy. Tha reasons for the spread
of this is largely due to the growing recogni
tion of the importance of suggestion as <t
means of influencing the physical conduct of
the body and also to the fact that regular
practitioners, who have heretofore been rather
conservative in adopting mental suggestion as
a treatment, are now coming into the fold.
Hypnotlsnj is getting more and more prevalent
as a means of treatment and Is being recog
nized by scientific men everywhere. Proba
bly some day, not very far away, mental sug
gestion and psychology will be part of the
regular equipment of all medical men.
So much for the practical work. On the
con-practical side, the advantage will be in
favor of increased opportunities for research.
The abnormal cases that a. regular physician
often finds will add to the science of psychol
ogy. It *-will finally tend to offset a certain
narrowness of view, as if the body were the
whole man. In this way the physicians' own
estimate of human nature will be altered, his
powers of sympathy enlarged and his whole
work given greater value.
Dr. Stratton also said that psychology
had recently developed more on the ex
perimental side than ever before and that
the researches were of inestimable value
to the practice of medicine. For the gen
eral background for medical study he ad
vocated the study of biology, which, he
said, is coming into closer contact with
psychology all the time.

The evening exercises were held at the
Ebell Society parlors, where the Mer
chants' Exchange gave a banquet In
honor of the opening of the tunnel. Nearly
every member of the exchange was pres
ent and there were a large number of ln
lnted guests.
After the banquet A. Jones introduced
the toastmaster of the evening. President
Theodore Gier of the Merchants' Ex
change, who gave a brief outline of the
work done by the exchange in the enter
prise, and then introduced Secretary Wil
bur Walker, who related the history of
the tunnel. He told of the collections
for the work made by the tunnel commit
tee, totaling $11,853 40.
Mayor Warren Olney was Introduced
and he congratulated the tunnel commit
tee on the great work which, through
their efforts, had been completed. The
Mayor said, in part:
"On behalf of the citizens of Oakland
I wish to thank you for the work you
have done in the removal of the barrier
between the two counties. When I was
invited to speak here this evening I was
informed that I might choose my own
subject. I do not think that I could
choose a better or more appropriate one
than the subject of 'Good Roads,' and I
have faith enough in the people of this
city to believe that in the near future
the city and county of Oakland, If you
please, will present such attractions that
our neighbors will be willing to build
good roads in order to reach our city."
Judge Henry A. Melvin responded to
the toast "All Roads Will Lead to Oak
land."
Hon. W. R- Davis, a former Mayor of
Oakland, spoke of the city twenty years
ago, to-day and in the future. " J. D.

county to the members of the Merchants'
I Exchange and the tunnel committee.

G. M. Stratton, professor of psychology

increasing recognition of the importance
of suggestion in the treatment of mental
diseases and the growing influence of the

LONDON, Nov. 4.â The British Govern

Office Is to leave any policing that may
be necessary to the United States.
British Government Not to Interfere
at the Isthmus.
TRTJSTS TO UNITED STATES.
The revolution at Panama had been foreseen
for some time. It was brought on undeniably
by the failure o* the Colombian Congress to
ratify the canal treaty. The Department of
Panama Is naturally much interested in hav
ing the canal dug. It means prosperity for a
province which la now not only impoverished,
but not even stlf-suportlng. What Panama,
left to ftself, will do for funds Is a question.
Every twa weeks the Federal Government at
Ec^ota hag had to send money to Panama tn
crder to defray the expenses of the local ad
ministration. With this source of supply cut
off famine looms up as Inevitable.
Aside from the loss of money, a civil war at
this time would completely devitalize the
country. And yet. I don't see how the Bogota
Government can avoid it. It certainly will not
concede autonomy to Panama. The only way
In sight would seem to me to be the entering of
negotiations of the Government of Colombia,
with the Government of the United States for
a new canal treaty.

ma. Captain Shurtleff said that he had
just concluded that he was to settle down
for a stay of several weeks in San Diego
bay, when he received the orders to sail.
He had given directions that the fires
should be drawn beneath the boilers and
that certain portions of the machinery bÂ«
overhauled. These orders were being
carried out when the rush orders to get
to sea arrived. It was necessary to ship
several sailors here to make up the com
plement and stores and water had to be
taken aboard. The captain says that he
expected to be back in this city before the
holidays.
The proclamation was unanimously ap
proved by the council. Everybody is sign-
Ing the act of Independence. The provi
sional government of Panama has noti
fied the agents of the steamship compa
nies not to accept Colombian passengers
for Colombian ports unless they can show
passports.
Colonel Torres agrees, if General Tovar
so advises, to embark the troops now at
Colon on the royal mall steamer Orinoco,
sailing for Carthagena to-morrow. The
presence of these troops here is now the
only difficulty In the way of the provi
sional government. All the troops have
moved a mile outside the town. Colom

Uoved by the necessity of satisfying obliga

municipal council of the District cf Panama,
faithfully Interpreting the sentiments of the
people It represents, declares in solemn form
that the people within Its jurisdiction shall
from to-day and forevermore separate them
eelves from the republic of Colombia, and.
limiting to It the State of Panama, shall
create with the other populations of the State
of Panama who accept separation a repub
lic, this republic to have an Independent,
democratic and representative government to
assure the happiness of the natives and other
inhabitants of the Isthmian territory. In or
der particularly to give effect to this resolu
tion the people of Panama will have to eman
cipate themselves from the Government of
Colombia and found a nationality free from
the interference of foreign powers.
The municipality of the District of Panama,
In Its own name and that of other municipal
councils, commends the administration and
direction of affairs pending the constitution
of the new republic, to a junta composed of
Jose Augustin Arango. Ftederico Boyd and
Tomas Arias, to whom shall be delegated all
powers necessary for the fulfillment of the
duties commended to them in the name of
the country.
The municipality decides to call to Its open
council the population of the district and to
submit for Its sanction this action, which Is
signed by the dignitaries and members of -the
corporation.
PANAMA. Nov. 4.â Following Is an ex
tract from the document proclaiming the
independence of the isthmus of Panama:
This afternoon (Tuesday) at 3 o'clock the
municipality cf Panama assembled with the
exclusive purpose of deliberating on the sit
uation of the country and deciding on the
most convenient m&cner by which to promote
the tranquillity, development and greatness of
the populations constituting tie topographic
and political entity denominated the Isthmus
of Panama.
The councilors considered the historic eventfl
by virtue of which Panama divorced It3 des
tinies from those of Spain and spontaneously
united Its fortunes to those of the republic of
Colombia. Addresses were made establishing
the fact that in the union of the Isthmus with
old Colombia modern Colombia has not re
ceived the benefits which It expected. Par
ticular mention was made of the sre.it and
prolonged grievances from which the Isthmus
suffered under all governments of the nation
since the union. Instead of being treated In
a patriotic manner these grievances Increased
every day in number and Importance and were
forced with a blindness that killed in the
people of the Isthmus the affection they had
for their alliance with Colombia,

also is not doubted that Commander

been displayed.
Continued Froa. Page 1, Column 5.
The revolutionists finally decided upon
5 o'clock as the hour to proclaim the Inde
pendence of the isthmus, but a change oc
curred in the plans and word Â¦was sent to
Santa Ana, where over 2000 men had con
gregated, for the revolutionists to dis
perse until 7 o'clock, but they were al
ready marching toward the Plaza Chiri
qui. cheering enthusiastically for the In
pendence of the isthmus. Thereupon
the dismal was given to General Huertas
of thr revolutionary forces, who. In the
name of the republic of Panama, arrest
ed GÂ«-::cral Tovar and his staff and es
corted them to the police headquarters,
amidst wid crsi.-rir.s- for tne new repub
lic, for Dr. Amador and the other leaders
of the revolution. ,
The flag of the republic of Panama was
then formally hoisted. It consists of four
squares. The first upper square to the
left is blue; the first lower square to the
left is white, with a blue star in the cen
ter; the second upper square Is white,
with a red star In the center, and the
second lower square is red.
The cause of the re\-olution may be
briefly summed up a3 being the result
of the action of the Congress of Colom
bia In Bogota In rejecting the Hay-Her
ran canal trerty. The Panamalans are,
almost to a man, in favor of the con
struction of the canal by the United
States, and it repeatedly had been proph
esied before and after the meeting of
Congress that Panama would secede if
the treaty were rejected and probably
would come to terms with the United
States for the building of :he Â«reat Isth
mian waterway.
The revolutionary junta is composed of
Jose Augustln Arango Frederico Boyd
and Tomas Arias, who have charge of
the Government. The composition of the
provisional Cabinet Is as follows:
Minister of the Government, Eusbis
Morales.
Minister of Finance, Dr. Emanuel Ama

Minister of Foreign Relations, F. V.

While Dr. Amador was in conference
yesterday with Government Â¦ generals the
officer who Is in command of the Govern
ment warship Bogota sent an ultimatum
to the revolutionists, giving them three
hours in which to restore the Colombian
Government, the time to expire at 10 p. m.
yesterday, but before receiving an answer
the Bogota began the bombardment of
Panama. Her flre was answered by the
guns of the town- forts and by those of
the gunboat Padilla, which had declared
in favor of the revolution. Shortly after

on the cruiser Carthegena, some of the
revolutionists became discouraged and it
seemed likely that the movement would
collapse. The more determined leaders of
the revolutionists called on Dr. Amador
and urged the taking of immediate ac
tion, while others advised postponing the
uprising. Dr. Amador was full of enthu
siasm and would" not listen to any pro
posals to postpone the outbreak until
later than Tuesday evening. This was
the situation throughout the afternoon
of Tuesday, when all of the revolutionists
were anxiously awaiting orders from Dr.
Amador.
PARIS. Nov. 4.â The Panama Canal
Company has received full advices on the
subject of the revolution In Panama. Will
iam Nelson Cromwell, general American
counsel for the Panama Canal Company,
who is now in this city, declined to make
a statement, but it is learned that the
company is not disturbed by the develop
ments in Panama, as the state of revolu
tion which exists does not affect the un
deniable rights of the company. More
over, even If the movement for indepen
dence is successful, it is pointed out that
the United States has formally recog
nized the legality of the company's con
cession and It Is not likely to throw over
the agreement made witn it, especially
when the relations with France would,
the company claims, thereby be affected.
The Foreign Office has received a dis
patch from Panama giving brief details
of the revolutionary rising there yester
day and saying that the general com
manding the Colombian forces at Panama
and the civil governor of that place were
among the notabilities held prisoners.
The revolutionary gathering occurred
at the Town Hall of Panama and was
bloodless. As the French Consul for
warded his dispatch the revolutionary
leaders of Panama were in session, draw-
Ing up a proclamation of independence,
declaring the separation of the isthmus
of Panama from Colombia.
The grave reDorts received from Pana
ma are being given the most serious at
tention of the officials here, owing to the
number of French residents on the isth
mus and the extent of French property
interests there, but thus far the Govern
ment has not taken action, as it does not
consfder that the revolutionary movement
seriously imperils French personal or
property rights. An official pointed out
that If any of these rights were imperiled,
France undoubtedly would take action.
The French Government continues to
consider the Panama canal as being a
purely private enterprise, but as entitled
to the same governmental protection as
any other property interest of French cit
izens. The officials say they have no pres
ent apprehension that the canal compa
ny's or any other property rights will be
injured by the uprising, as the indepen
dence of Panama cannot become effec
tive unless the powers recognize the new
ly established sovereignty. The case of
Roumania throwing off Turkish sover
eignty is cited. Roumania not becoming;
independent until the powers recognized
the new sovereignty.

The Times this morning say3 that Co
lombia seems to have brought the revo
lution on her head by wanton procrastina

in such Interesting circumstances may

j to protect the military property and that
the other commanders will take the same
action when they arrive.
With the Atlanta, Dixon and Nashvilie
theft will be a naval force on the gulf
elde of the Isthmus sufficient to meet any
probable emergency. The presence of the
*â¢Â» Colombian Government troops at
Colon makes the situation there at pres
i ent more difficult than on the Panama
t side. It is the opinion cf some of the of
' Scials here, however, that these troops,
having been deprived of their general of
; fleers by capture, will surrender without
j bloodshed, and. perhaps, join the revolu
i tion; but if the Government troops hold
out and maintain possession of Colon, it
probably will oblige the United States to
take temporary possession cf the rail
way again, as traffic cannot be mairi-
J tained with one end of the line in pos
session of the Government forces and the
I other in the hands of the revolutionists.
The effect of such seizure of the road
would be to prevent the movement of any
body cf troops carrying arms from one
side of the isthmus to the other. It is
fortunate for the revolutionists that they
; were in practical possession of the isth
j mus when the first of the United States
j r.aval forces arrived, for one cf the stand*
: ing rules of the navy in such cases is to
> maintain the status quo.
During the day a telegram was received
| at the State Department from the New
i York management cf the Panama Rail
1 road Company f tating that the property
', cf that company was in danger and ask
j ing for protection. In addition a message
j came from the cable company, saying, in
; effect, that there was no telegraphic corn
j municaticn for points in Colombia out
side cf Panama and Colon by way of the
isthmus. It is assumed that the revolu
tionists had cut the inland communica
tions so as to prevent the Government at
Bogota obtaining knowledge as to what
was occurring on the isthmus and it was
expected that the effect would bÂ© to em
barrass the Colombian Government in its
military movement.
There arc at the stations named on the
Atlantic coast, approximately, the follow
ing number cf marines: Norfolk, 20);
League Island, 300; New York, 200; Wash
ington, SCO; Boston, 200; Portsmouth, N.
H., 100; Annapolis, 150. In a case of emer
gency 800 or more of these could be spared
for sen-ice on the isthmus and should a
greater emergency arise arrangements
necessarily would be completed making
practically the entire force available for
duty in Panama. At Port Royal and
Charleston only small detachments are
stationed, just sufficient to meet the needs
of those two stations. On the Pacific
; Coast the marine force has been reduced
: to a email number.
Dr. Thomas Herran, the Colombian
Chnrge. is yet without official advices
frcrn the isthmus or Bogota concerning
the revolution. He said:
"When 1 receive information from my
Government I shall have something to
say. I co not believe the officials in Bo
gota have yet heard of the revolt, for \
a.s the Government officials en the Isth
mus were arrested without warning there
is probably no person there to keep Bo

WASHINGTON", Nov. 4.â The Japanese
Minister has received an official state
ment regarding the alleged dealings be
tween the officials of the Japanese con

Trias, as reported by General MacArthur
In December, 1300. The statement says
that the subject was Investigated by the
Japanese. Government and it was learned
that Hoajo of the Japanese consulate at
Manila met Trias accidentally on a pleas
ure trip and was introduced to him by a
fellow traveler. In conversation Trias
said that the insurgents were In need of
arms and ammunition; that If they could
obtain a supply sufficient for the equip
ment of from S00O to 10,000 men it would
be an easy matter to drive the American
troops out cf the islands and ultimately
to secure independence, and that If Japan
would assist the Insurgents by supplying
arms and ammunition the right to estab
lish a permanent coaling station, freedom
of trade and railway franchises would be
conceded. He then Inquired how Hoajo
thought the Japanese Government would
regard such a proposition.
Hoajo said that he had no authority to
discuss the matter in his official capacity,
but that his private opinion was that It
would be absolutely impossible for Japan
to consider such a proposition, or to ren
der any assistance whatever to the in
surgents, and he added he thought the
wisest course was submission to Ameri
can authority.
The United States Minister at Tokio
was notified of the facts revealed by the
investigation and of the resultant action
and the reply received from him was that
the United States Government regarded
the incident as finally closed.

AND âOTHERS.
The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devoto their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
Fcieniific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the znbn to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of Etudy and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and* that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there "is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â <{ Syrup of Figs" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
o5 on a customer a preparation under the name of ''Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or . return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name o! the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co" â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the'best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Mr. Raymond J. Morris. Deputy Sheriff of Floyd County. In a letter
from New Albany. Indiana, says:
"Last winter I contracted a most distressing cold. It affected my hearing,
my eyes run and my head was all stopped up and I coughed until my throat was
raw and sore. A druggist who was a personal friend asked me to try Ptruna
and I reluctantly did so. Usually all patent medicines nauseated me, but I was
pleased to find that this was an exception and that it soon relieved me. Within
eight days I was cured and in addition felt better and stronger than I had done
for some time. Since that time I have used it off and on and find that it not only
cures colds and all catarrhaf affections but that it acts as a splendid appetizer.
If the system becomes worn out or the nerves unstrung, Peruna ccts as a f.ns
tonic, relieves the tension and induces rest and renewed health. It is a fine
remedy calculated to relieve young and old. and I heartily endorse it."â Raymond

Point Lobos Improvement Club to
â¢ Ask" Board' of Public Works to
Better District. <
The Point-Lobos Improvement Club met
last night /at Richmond Hall, corner of
Fourth avenue and Clement street. H.
U. Jaudln presided.
A large number of the property owners
of the district were present and street im
provement was discussed. The advisabil
ity of narrowing the sidewalks and bl
tuminizing Clement street from First ave
nue to Sixth street was discussed. Com
mittees appointed to interview the various
property owners of the street reported
that they had met with much opposition
on the part of some. The objections were
that the levy on the property owner would
be more than ho could at this time stand.
After; much discussion the matter was
laid over.
Eetltlons were drawn up to be presented
to the Board of Public Works asking that
bltuxni&ized crossings be put in at the
corners of Clement and Second," Third,
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth avenues, and
that brick cesspools be constructed at the
corners above mentioned, where there axe
none existing now.
A petition for a new fire alarm box at
the corner of Second avenue and C street
will be presented to the Board of Fire
Commissioners.
The officers of the club are: H. TJ. Jau
dln, president; G. M. Baum, first vice
president; "William M. do Wolf, second
vice president; P. J. Ward, treasurer; J.
J. Cassldy, financial secretary; Dr. H. A.

G. A. Blank, G. S. Baum, William M. de
Wolf. Dr. H. A- Xiemeyer, J. J. Cassldy
(secretary), 656 Ninth avenue, executive
committee.
THE finish of the count shows that
the Republicans elect seven Super
visors, the Auditor, Treasurer, Tax
Col ector. County Clerk and City
Attorney. The Democrats elect ten Su
pervisors, the Sheriff, Asspssor, Recorder,
Public Administrator, District Attorney,
Coroner and the two Police Judges. The
Union Labor party elects the Mayor and
one Supervisor.
Returns show that Franklin K. Lane
carried one precinct in the city. That
precinct is v the Thirteenth of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District and is known as
the Almshouse precinct. The vote stands:
Lane 78. Schmitz 55 and Crocker 42. Lane's
the man that swept the precinct.
Â¦ The three Grand Army men nominated
by the Republican convention were de
featedâHorace Wilson for Supervisor,
TVilliam E. Lutz for Public Administrator
ei.d General E. S. Salomon for District
Attorney. "Wilson and Lutz belong to
George H. Thomas Post. General Salo
mon is a member of Garfleld Post. Every
veteran in the field fell on the firing line.
The Bahrs volunteers did not cover
themselves with glory in the engagement
la?t Tuesday. Their conduct in the field
fiwws the danger of depending upon raw
and undisciplined troops. The volunteers
Ftarted to the front vrithout supplies or
ammunition. There were so many con
r.'.ftins orders and so much confusion that
tho alignment of the forces was not es
tablished until the polls had closed and
the battle was over. The roster of the
army is somewhere at campaign head
quarters.
In the election last Tuesday Henry J.
Crocker carried the Thtrty-nfth, Thlrty
peventh. Thirty-eighth. Fortieth, Forty
first, Forty-second. Forty-third and For
ty-fourth Assembly districts. The Call
predicted that he would win in all these
districts and also in the Thirty-ninth.
The last named district, however, gave a
small plurality for Schmitz.
LANES BACKING.
The Call predicted that Bchmltz would
carry the Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth, Thirty
first. Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thlrty
eixlh and Forty-filth districts. He car
ried all these, together with the Twenty
e'.ghth. Thirty-fourth and Thirty-ninth.
Martin Kelly is a back number. He failed
to carry the Twenty-eighth for Lane. As
predicted in The Call, Lane did not carry
one Assembly district, but it is impossible
at this time to determine which contribu
ted most to this Inglorious finish, his
morning newspaper or his evening organ.
Crocker ran ahead of Lane in every As
sembly district of the city but one. In
the Thirtieth District Lane ran slightly
ahead of his Republican competitor.
The Fortieth District wins the Republi
can banner. It gave Crocker more votes
than it gave for Schmitz and Lane com
bined. Crocker received 1646 votes. Lane
715 and Bchmitz C8.
In the Forty-flirt District, where- Crock
er, Schmitz and Lane reside, the vote was
light. Crocker received 1213, Schmitz 1049
and Lone C37.
Future events will determine whether
the liquor dealers of San Francisco acted
wisely in bringing the trade Into politics.
They were strongly advised by eminent
dealers to keep out and withhold any
kind of action that would tend to force
the issue on the existing political parties
of this State.

Zjoee by Paying a Check.
A man about 83 years of age went into
the store of Carroll, Til ton & Co., 811
Market street, yesterday morning and
asked them . to cash a check for $27 for
him. The check was drawn on the San
Francisco National Bank, signed by John
C. Lemner and made payable to John
Whitney. He got J24 . on . the check and
the firm found it was worthless. The po
lice were notified. .
A small army of officeholders is des
tined to lose positions as a result of
Mayor Schroitz's re-election, since he will
control a majority of the members of
the 'various boards and commissions be
ginning from. January 8 next. The up
heavals will be especially heavy in the
Boards of Health and of Public Works,
where Casey had formed combinations
against Schmitz, who had appointed him
Commissioner of Works.
Probably the first act of the new Com
missioner of Works will be to form Â¦ an
alliance with Commissioner Herbert
Schmitz, the Mayor's brother, and de
pose Casey, as president of the Board of
Works, In- that event Casey will no
longer be ex-oflicio member of the Board
of Health, and Mayor Schmitz therefore
will also assume control of tho last named
board. 'Yi'^'-'v ....
In all likelihood Health Officer O'Brien
will be superseded by Dt. John F. Dillon,
who was defeated for. Coroner. Dillon
would have been . appointed long ago if
Casey * had etood . by Schmitz. Among
others In the Department of Health -who
will feel the keen edge of the official ax
are City Chemist Green, Superintendent
W. J. Kelly of the Almshouse, Dr. B.
McElroy, resident physician of thÂ© City
and County Hospital, and Chief Surgeon
Bunnell of the Emergency Hospitals.
Nicholas Jortall, secretary of the Board
of Public Works who owes his â¢appoint
ment to Casey t will take the Initiative
in separating himself from a salary of
$150 per month. He stated yesterday that
he would succumb to the inevitable and
resign from the position on December 31
next. Others who are In Jeopardy are
City Engineer Grunsky and City j Archi
tect Cuthbertson. )
The term of Registrar "Walsh will ex
pire on January 8 next, and Schmitz will
name his successor. Powel Fredrick, who
wai defeated, for County Clerk, can have
the position if he wants it, or he may be
appointed to succeed Jortall as secretary
of the Board of Public "Works.
Of course, there is a large number of
minor positions not governed by civil ser
vice that will be vacated to make room
for Schmitz's appointees.
The fact that ten Democratlo Super
visors were elected Insures the retention
ofXTharleB "W. Fay as clerk and the pres

sand by the official count. The plurality
on the rest of the Republican State ticket
wlil likely be 4000 to 5000 less than that
lor Herrick. The total vote for Johnson
was less than that for any Democratic
candidate for Governor for years.
The Senate stands 29 Republicans, 4
Democrats; majority 25. The House stands
S3 Republicans, 21 Democrats; majority 6S.
The majority on joint ballot for the re
election of Senator Hanna will be 93.
These figures will not be changed by the
official returns. The counties carried by
the Democrats were all in the rural dis
tricts, all the larger cities being in the
counties that gave Republican plural

county that they had two years ago ex
cept Sandusky, which Is 1 strongly Demo
cratic, and they carried other counties
that they did not two years ago or any
other year.
Secretary Richardson of the Democratic
State Committee said that the result In

moves Johnson as a dominant factor in
Democratic politics and that the Mayor
will not control the .next State convention.
Mr. Richardson is a Johnson man.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 4. â Returns
"which are complete, save a few scattered
precincts in remote parts of the State,
give Governor Beckham (D.) for Governor
a majority of 30,408 over Morris Belknap,
his Republican opponent In yesterday's
balloting. The missing precincts are in
both Republican and Democratic strong
holds, so the assertion seems warranted
that the Governor's final and official ma
jority will not be less than 30,000. This
is the largest majority given to a Demo
cratic Gubernatorial candidate in fifteen
years.
Returns from the mountainous counties
comprising the Eleventh District give
Belknap a majority of 15,353, with two or
three precincts yet to be heard from.
This indicates a falling off in the Repub
lican vote, as this district usually returns
about 20,000 majority for that party.
The Socialist and Labor parties had full
tickets In the field, but their vote was
small. Â¦
RICHARD CROKER.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â Such comment as
the afternoon papers make on the result
of the election yesterday in New York
expresses regret at Tammany's victory.
The Pall Mall Gazette says it gives the
world a lesson that "purity Â«is not inhe
rent in a democratic form of govern
ment."
The St. James Gazette bitterly assails
Tammany, saying the result "is one
which every honest person must deeply
lament and proves how powerless is true
opinion to make its weight felt under a
republican system when it is confronted
by the machinery of unscrupulous men."

At the chateau a signal was given as

Senator John T. Morgan of Alabama
takes. the ground that the result of yes
terday's elections forecasts the nomina
tion of Gorman and McClellan as the
Democratic Presidential ticket next year.
"The result in Maryland," said Senator
Morgan, "is a great satisfaction to Sena
tor Gorman's friends and it does not
seem probable now that he can be beaten
for the nomination. Mr. McClellan's great
victory in New York makes him a na
tional character in the Democratic party
at once. With a good, clean administra
tion of the city's affairs, which I have
every reason to believe he will give, he
will be a 3trong man for Mr. Gorman's
running mate. Senator Gorman now has
the South almost solidly with him and
the indorsement which he received in his
own State on the race question, close to
the hearts of all Southern people, puts
him far in the lead for the head of the
Democratic ticket."
"I regard the result of yesterday's elec
tion in Maryland as a protest against any
further radical action intended to disturb
the business interests of the country."
This was Gorman's brief comment to
day on the Democratic victory in his
State.
Maryland election of yesterday as
the only one having any bearing on the
Presidential contest of next year and all
Qf Senator Gorman's friends now say
that it puts- him prominently to the front
among the candidates for the Democratic
nomination. Senator Morgan of Alabama
predicted to-night that the ticket would
be Gorman and McClellan, with the race
issue a prominent factor in the campaign.
Senator Gorman's friends say he staked
his claims for Democratic nomination on
the result la Maryland this year, which
he considered as very important as bear
ing upon the selection of the Democratic
candidate. If he had lost in his own
State he would have withdrawn from the
contest. Since he won Democrats
and Republicans alike consider that it
puts him fairly in the field as the leading
candidate at this time.

"Who was the first President?" asked
the Commissioner.
"Washingtin." was the quick reply. ,
"Yes; that is correct," said the Com
missioner, encouragingly.
The Italian evidently was not sure, for
he immediately supplemented his answer
as follows:
"Gen'ral Washingtlnâ Georga, Washing

IT is to be hoped that Secretary Cortelyou's indorsement
of Commissioner Sargent's recommendation for the
abolition of the noisome detention shed for immigrants
at this port will result in the making of the proposed im

shames our civilization, was built down to the supposed
level of Asiatic coolies. To it must go all immigrants who
arc under examination to determine their right to land.
Chinese ladies and gentlemen, and there are such, must go
there to take pot luck with the lower class of their country
men. It has proved to be far from safe against escapes, and
those detained there have good reason to complain of their
treatment. A decent depot on Angel Island will offer no
facilities for escape, and will better represent the civilization
which is the boast of our people. â¢
The location of a Federal quarantine station on the isl

date a clean, decent and roomy immigrant depot, without

A Sheriff of New hitherto innocent of any indica

The extent of the deception practiced can be seen by
comparing the letter Lane wrote for the Examiner on Mon
day with that of yesterday. On Monday Lane said: "In
my 'opinion this contest is entirely between Mr. Schmitz
and myself. 1 believe Mr. Crocker will take third place be
cause he is practically without any vote south of Market
street and because he has been deserted by practically
every Republican politician who has any following whatso
ever in the city. * * * Take from my vote for Gov
ernor, which was 3.1,000, a full 10.000, which is two-thirds of
the total labor union vote cast two years ago, and there
still remains 23,000, which is probably enough to elect me."
By statements of that kind made persistently throughout
the campaign Lane induced many a good conservative citi
zen to cast a vote for him, and it now appears Lane knew
from the beginning that such votes would be . futile. " We
know not what name Mr. Lane may give to such political
practices: they may have their origin in his strange sense
of his personal obligation to his party and the city; but in
effect they amount to no more, no less, than obtaining votes
by false pretenses, and those who were deceived by them
have good right to complain of the deception.
YESTERDAY Mr. Franklin Lane in a letter to the Ex
aminer, written apparently as soon as the returns had
made known his defeat, said: "I have, nothing to re
gret about this fight except the defeat. It was my judgment
at the beginning of the campaign that there was no. possi
bility of success. I accepted the nomination in this belief.
Upon the day that I accepted a group of my friends met in
my office and I told them I would accept it out of a sense
of duty to my party and of obligation to the city, but that
I had no expectation whatever of success."
No one will care at this stage of the game to question
Mr. Lane's peculiar sense of duty, nor his extraordinary
idea of his obligations to the city, but to many of his sup
porters that statement, coming on the morning after elec
tion, must have been more depressing than defeat itself.
Thousands of men voted for Lane under the impression that
he was an honest candidate, honestly expecting to win. Re
peatedly during the campaign he asserted an assurance of
coming victory! Over and over again, on the stump and
in letters to the public, he declared himself sanguine of suc
cess, lie invited votes on the ground that a vote for him
was the surest way of providing good government for the
city, and he unquestionably obtained a good many votes
in that way. The voters who were thus 1 induced to throw
away their ballots, as it were, have now a right to ask
whether they were fairly dealt with by a man who admits
that he was making a bluff all the time and knew from the
start he was but a dummy candidate.

The working energy of the body fs some
thing enormous. ThÂ«* muscles of the jaw
can exert a force of 534 pounds. Tho heart
is a most remarkable worker, :vlthough its
work is, not. as is often stated, continu
ous. As a matter of fact, the periods of
rest are longer than the periods of work,
and the heart ns a whole works no longer
than a man who labors nine hours a day.
ThÂ« total work of the heart is not less
than 150 foot tons a day. This means
work equal to lifting 150 tons one foot, or
one ton 150 feet. A day's work for a la
boring man is 300 foot tons. The muscles
by which the body is supplied with air
the respiratory muscles, do a work of
twenty-one foot tons a day. It is estimat
ed that the human body as a whole per

How long can a human being live with

only fifteen survived. This case, how

The lungs are simply a turned in or
'tucked in" portion of the body and their
membrane covering is merely a modifica
tion of the same Rtructures (epithelial
cell?) which form the skin. The lungs,
although they occupy comparatively little
space, are so constructed as to present an
enormou? surface. This increase of sur
face is pained by the adoption of a sim
ple and ingenious mechanical device found
In many parts of the body, notably In the
brain and the intestines. It consists of a
"crimping" or wrinkling of
the surface. By a device of this kind the
lung*, with a total cubical contents or
only a few hundred inches, present
a surface of about 1000 square feetâ
that is. an area equal to the floor of a
room forty feet square. The trachea, or
windpipe, the passage leading to the
lung*, divides and subdivides into smaller
openings, which finally lead to the min
ute chambers where the work of the
Iudrs is done. These air cells, or lobules,
as they are called, vary from 1-16 to
2-200 of an inch in diameter and number
about G0(\000.000.
The skin covers an area of about twenty
square feet, and is perforated by about
T.OiO.000 perspiratory ducts or porfs. each
of which is a complex little apparatus for
the collection and outpouring of the per
spiration.
To the wonders of the body there is
absolutely no end. The following figures
Illustrate some interesting facts and par
ticulars.
E&tor Health Culture Magazine. New York.
The fact that the human body is so in
finitely beyond any other object known
to man in complexity. In mechanical per
fection and in the number of Its parts
makes it quite impossible to give any
clear Idea of it by likening it to other ob
jects. For Instance, man is frequently
compared to a steam engine. And in a
certain sense such a comparison is en
lightening, for, just as a steam engine
is a mechanism for converting the energy
latent in coal and water and air into
energy manifest as heat and work, so the
human body is merely a mechanism for
the transformation of food, water and air
into heat and work. But beyond this the
comparison could not be carried. In the
first place, the body is so much more per
fect as a piece of mechanism that the loss
of energy in conversion is about one-tenth
that lost in the finest steam engine.
Again, as to complexity. If all the steam
engines of all the world were. to be com
bined into one great mechanism, that ma
chine would be crude and simple in com
parison with the human body.

To return to the general result, it makes sure a Repub
lican national victory next year. New Jersey, Colorado and
Nebraska. Ohio and Iowa settle that. Mr. Bryan carried in
the South, in iqoo, Alabama. Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky. Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Caro
lina. South Carolina. Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, and
in the North only Idaho, Montana and Nevada, getting 151
electoral votes in all, of which only nine were from the
North. These nine seem assured to Roosevelt next year.
The Democrats may have Delaware, Maryland and New
York, with all of Bryan's Northern votes, and yet have only
108 to Roosevelt's 249. So these elections show no prob
able or possible change in the administration next year.
When Judge Wallace removed the old Board of Super
visors, under our consolidation act, which preceded the
charter. Rainey. a most experienced professional boss, when
interviewed, said that he approved of it and hoped the Su
preme Court would affirm it, for lie wanted to know where
the whole power of the city government met in one man,
for he would elect that man. It is a significant sidelight on
Tuesday's result that Mr. Rainey supported Mayor Schmitz.
The charter created the one-man power for which he had
been hunting, and out of all the candidates he selected the
one that seemed to him the most useful in his business.
The charter of Greater New York is on the same plan.
Tammany wanted the oiie-man government and got its man
in Mayor Van Wyck. But the charter gave such lush op
portunity fcr graft and loot, and Bill Devery and his ban
dits improved it so openly, that in a spasm of reaction
Low was elected. Now the sickening enormities of Devery
are forgotten and the people have let Tammany at the fiesh
pots again, and there is no reason to hope that Mayor
McClellan's exercise of one-man power will rise above its
source. Already the shouts ring from the Bronx to Castle
Garden that it is to he "a wide open town."
THE success of Tammany in New York is the opening
gambit in the political^chcss of 1904. But it must be
studied in the light of the general results of Tuesday's
balloting. Mayor Low had probably given New York the
first example of decent government it has had in a score
of years. But District Attorney Jerome, who finally sup
ported him, uttered sentence upon him before the nomina
| tion by declaring him to be cold and unsympathetic, . too
self-contained for American politics.
That counts in a fight. The late S. S. Cox was^a fine
mixer. He had Presidential aspirations once. On an occa
sion he drew a fellow member of Congress into his lap
with many expressions of fondness and confidence, finally
saying, "Is there anything I can ever do for you?" The reply
was, "Yes, Sam; let me sit in your lap when you're Presi
dent." New York evidently wants a man whose lap is' at the
disposal of his constituency.
Co-ordinating the result there with that in other States,
there are two points in ,the political firmament from which
Democratic stars may fall next year, Tammany and Mary
land. Tom Johnson and Tomijohnsonism fell in Ohio un
der a solar plexus blow administered by Senator Hanna.
That State has given about the largest Republican majority
in a State election since the Civil War, and returns Mr.
Hanna to the Senate by such an overwhelming vote that the
opposition is among the scattering. This retires Mr. John
eon as a Presidential candidate and strikes a blow at his
kind of political mountebanking that will no doubt have an
admonitory and corrective effect upon the Democratic party.
Mr. Gorman makes a showing in Maryland that will put
music in his bugle on the color line issue, but he will be
powerless without Tammany. Will the Sachems and the
Wiskinskies accept him? That seems to be in doubt. It
is intimated that reaction from Bryanism has carried Tam
many so far into conservatism as to make Mr. Cleveland its
preferred candidate. That means that if he will not run he
will say who shall.
The political flower garden of Mr. William Randolph
Hearst got badly frosted. It is true that his New York
paper supported the Tammany ticket, but Tammany wants
tigers and not tomcats. In^San Francisco the Examiner
makes a sorry showing. While we do not pretend that the
election of Mayor Schmitz is complimentary to the field of
newspapers, the defeat of Lane is a revelation of the weak
ness of the Examiner that cannot be overlooked. When it
opposed Lane for Governor he carried the city, receiving
33,000 votes. But when it supported him for Mayor by
roar and roorback, by tooth and nail and all of its political
resources of hammer and tongs, he makes a bad third in the
run, getting less than half the votes he had when it fought
Tiim. Its daily jackdawing of "Lane's the man" and its lam
pooning of other candidates produced no dividends. It
would seem as though the people struck at Hearst through
Lane, and wjiile the shield suffered the Presidential can
didate behind it got a smell of the mold above the rose that
may weaken even his colossal egotism.
The people of the city now know what the charter means.
Its. intention was to provide one-man government and one
man responsibility. There were many who thought this un
wise. But the professional politicians never doubted its
wisdom. ....
The promise contained in that statement is not weakened
by the implied admission of past mistakes and failures. On
the contrary, it is distinctly strengthened by them, for the
admissions serve to show that the Mayor ha3 learned some
thing by experience, and will avoid some 'at least of the mis
takes that disappointed even his own expectations of his first
term. .
How far the Mayor will profit by the teachings of . the
past and rid himself of those influences that did so much
to discredit his first term remains to be seen. He may be
sure, however, that he will have the cordial support of The
.Call in all that he undertakes Jor the public good. A simi
lar support indeed may be promised from almost the whole
conservative element of the people. What is desired is good
government, an administration of public affairs such as will
conduce to the public welfare and individual prosperity, and
in a vast measure' it rests with the Mayor whether or not'
such administration shall be given.
Mayor Schmitz is no longer an inexperienced official.
He has been tried in office and a plurality of his fellow citi
zens have expressed at the polls a continued confidence in
him. It is nothing more than right, therefore, that he should
have ample support from all in his efforts to make his sec
ond term a full reparation for the mistakes of the first. His
statement made to the public through The Call has an un
questionable ring of sincerity, and will be received with a high
expectation of a faithful endeavor on his part to live up to
the spirit of its promise and its pledge.
MAYOR SCHMITZ bore himself well on the evening
following the election when the returns had made
certain his re-election for a second term. He had
no harsh words to say of his opponents, nor did he display
any excessive exultation over his victory. His statement to
the public, published in The Call of yesterday, was doubtless
read with gratification, not onljr by his political supporters,
but by all who have the interests of the city at heart and
wish the new administration well.
The Mayor admits that his first term of office has been
to some 'extent unsatisfactory to himself, and he hopes for
better things in the term that now approaches. As he him
self said in his statement to The Call: "I have no hard
feelings against those who opposed my re-election, and I
will endeavor Â«to. give the people of -San Francisco a good,
clean administration. I have tried to do this, and would
have done much better if I had had the proper support, but
now that I have the' confidence of the people I hope to carry
out my intentions." Â¦
Inch by inch they drew nearer and the
goose flesh which raised itself on "Beech"
would have served the purpose of a nut
meg grater. With a trembling hand the
lieutenant raised the latch of the door
and, counting one, two, three, slid it back
upon its rollers.
There was an unearthly scream.
"Beech" hid behind the door and the
three policemen threw themselves flat on
the floor to escape the shower of bullets.
Then with a hissing like a steam roller
a long black shadow of a cat leaped over
the prostrate forms and was gone down
the echoing corridors.

tice knows "Beech," the elevator man.
He has a word and a smile for all and
will even beam upon the prisoner whom
ho is lifting up to the iron door on the
top floor In a manner which invites him
to stay a while.'
The other night "Beech" had a late
trick on the elevator and about 3 o'clock
in the morning, when all was still in the
hall and justice reigned supreme, he
seized the fleeting moment to snatch a
little sleep. "Beech" dozed peacefully.
But hark! A noise in the property
roomâsuspicious footfalls and muffled
noises from the room, where the Police
Pepartment stores all that is sacred.
"Beech" sprang to his feet and listened,
his nerves all a-tingle. Could any thief
dare to invade the sacred precincts of the
citadel of justice itself and carry off his
loot from under the very noses of the
arms of the law? The honor of the de
partment rested upon "Beech."
Noiselessly he stole into the Central
station and whispered the thrilling newa
to the lieutenant at the desk. Two pa
trolmen were summoned post haste and
the four crept up to the door of the prop
erty room. Their teeth were gritted and
the cold steel of their revolvers shone in
the light of the electric lamp on the
corner.

the Idea that the European Is in any re
spect worse than the American. He la
differentâ that is all. He has one stand
ard. We have another. In married life
those two standards do not usually blend.
Home life in Europe is as beautiful as
here and the marriage ties as sacred. But
temperament and environment are ail im
portant factors in married life, and those
of the American differ from the Euro
pean's.
Titles year by year grow more value
less. Examples of misery from the inter

These two items will, I believe, check

Wl i n a super quantity cl piacst ,
and energy and an abundance ;
of practical kno*ied,gÂ» of
miniag. acquired on the cold
frontier of the United States'
mest northern territory, two women â one
a native daughter cf California and the
other wÂ»n known throughout the wide
western mining sections of the northern
hemisphere â are about to undertake a
gigantic scheme f-jr developing one of the
richest g-?id producing portions of Alaska.
Mrs. Isab^r.e M. Healy. whose name Js
prominently i-ientified with the early his
tory cf Dawsor. RXtd Nose, and Mrs. M.
C. Gilmcre. who has spent several years
in the Northwest In search of gold, cf
which she has already successfully mined
a fortune, departed from this city for
New Tork on last evening's train on a
rnissica that Involves a deal cf enter
prise, money and business tact. They are
bound for the Eastern metropolis for the
purpose cf Interesting capita! in a pro
ject which includes the building of a rail
road from the Bay of Good Hope inland
along the Imnachuck River to the min
ing tewn of During., a distance of some
thing like twenty miles; the establishing
of a steamship line from the bay south
ward to Nome, the development cf thirty
claims along thÂ» Imnachuck River which
are owned by tbe two ambitious women
and for the Inaugurating cf a general |
trading business in that far away terri
tory.
PIONEER OF DAWSON.
Business undertakings are net new to
Mrs. Healx and Mrs. GUmore. The for
mer ventured into Alaska with her hus
band in 133, when th? Yukon district had
a population of a few hundred men. She
witnessed that small population rapidly
swell to thousands. an<i watched Daw
sen, with a few canvas tents, thrive until
its location oa the territorial map was
marked by substantial fcusigess buildings, j
the spires .of chcrches and the brewn I
painted roofs of numerous schoois. With j
the pioneers cf thÂ« new mining world
Mrs. Healy acquired valuableanlning pos- j
sessions and as the commerce of the j
town developed so did her Interests Ia Its
mercantile Institutions.'
Three years ago. when the first rush for
Nome began. Mrs. Healy journeyed thith
er and, aided by her knowledge of min
ing, she was soon in possession of some
cf the richest claims In that district- It ,
was there that Mrs.- Healy first met Mrs. {
Gllmcre, who had been attracted north Â¦
by the stories of the great gold discover
ies. Together- these plucky women later,
when the news cf rich finds along the
Imnachuck River reached Nome, has
tened northward and within a few
months* time they had located thirty val
uable claims along 1 the banks of that
stream. With money at their disposal
they rapidly proceeded with the openfng
up. cf their properties, known as the
Polar Bear group, and their efforts were
soon rewarded by rich strikes. \
CLAIMS SICH US' GOLD. :
Fully appreciating the magnitude of
their new undertaking and the need cf
modern conveniences for operating their
claims. Mrs. Healy and Mrs. Giiniore con
ceived the Idea, of organizing a company
which could build railroads, establish
Â¦teassship connections with Nome and the
more civilized world farther smith and
cngagÂ« In general trading teat would not
only be of financial benefit to their own
Interests, but those cf others who had
Joined them at the Uttle town of Deertag.
"With dirt from the shafts and tfce drifts
cf their claims yielding as high as C4 a
pan and the ground getting richer as the
work progressed the two women tastily
developed their plans for the greater un
dertaking and several weeks agÂ» they
left Deering for San Francisco and
reached here about eight days ago. WcCe
tarrying la Seattle for a few days the
message came from Deering thqt the
claims adjoining- theirs had been opened
and were panning as high as IT?.
Other women have figured prominently
In the mining Interests of Alaska, but
Mrs. Healy and Mrs. Gilmare are the first
of their sex to ccnÂ» out of that wild but
rich country with a project .mvolvteg
commercial enterprises of a magnitude
tuxt demands attention frcia the moseyed
men of the Eastern financial center.

Of their undertaking they are mest
hopeful and look forward to returning to
Deerteg next spring with ample assurance
of proceeding with their plans. Discussing

PORTLAND. Or.. Nov. 4. -At a meet
ing of the committee of the Chamber of
Commerce toâ iay. ft was frequently said
in the various speeches thac the Southern
Pariftc was hindering the development of
Oregon, and it was freely advised that
relief be so::zht from the next Legislature
ari that seme of the railroad statutes of
Texas bÂ« adopted. It tm pointed out
that each *ea.son. for at least the last six
years past, there has been a shortage ia
cars. This lack cf facilities has increased
each year until the present time, when it
has reached such a. stage that the railroad
com pan y has recently bÂ«sen forced to
nTÂ£jk-Â» prohibitory rates en lumber from
certain districts that the bulk of the de
mani for cars may be shut off.
In explanation of the shortage the rail
.roa-i company has stated that much of it*
rolling rtcck has t*Â« employed upon the
Ogcen-Lucin cut-cfT. where it was neces
sary to divert from the regular lines of
business large numbers of engines and
cars. The transportation committee
*Â»enied to think that there are other rea
sons for the shortage of cars. They admit
ted the possibility that the cut-eff work
might be in a measure responsible, but it
was intimated that because of the fact
that ths Santa Fe is building near the
southern route cf the Southern PaciSc.
many cars that should be in service here
had been taken to that district, that the
cempany might be better enabled to tsht
against the inrcais cf the opposition

Vie Bitters. Hundreds have found
true. It alwaj-s cares Indiges-
tion, Constipation, Biliousness,
Dyspepsia or Malaria, Fever and

added to the list who will make the trip

up their slates. The difference will be
that there will not be the little hand

prohibiting pool selling.

BACES IN THE EAST.
XEW TORK. Nov. 4.â It is promised
that the Jockey ranks at the winter meet-
Ing of the "N*Â«w California Jockey Club will
be swelled considerably by many of the
Amerlran riders who have been meeting
with pronounced success on European
tracks. One rider, who has as good a-?
promised to visit the coast when he re
turns from France, is George Thompson.
In the past season Thompson ptood second
on the ll?t In Prance. His success has been
pronounced in his long: stay abroad. John
Thompson, a brother of the jockey, is In
New York and Is authority for the state- 1
ment that George will ride at the Ban
Francisco tracks when he returns to j
America.
Charlie Van Dusen is another who has
been supgested as a more than likely vis
itor to his native land this winter. Van
Dusen has previously spent his winters
at New Orleans, but it was announced at
Aqueduct a few days ago that he had an
nounced his intention of visiting the
coast this year. Charlie Gray, who met
with sutcfs In Austria, is another who
will purely be at the Oakland meeting.
havlr.fr made definite arrangements for
the trip.
Gray has been in this country for somo !
time now, and his qualifications as a rider
ore well known in San Francisco. He
rode McChesney to victory in the Harlem
National, and while In the East this sea
son he has given a g-ood account of him
self in the saddle. Steve Lawlor In
duced Gray to come East, and also
brought little Hlfrglnx from Chicago. Hlg
grlns. after he had been rldinjr a week,
w.-is crowding the leaders in the Jockey
Rst, and but for an accident, in which he
broke his left foot, his percentage would
have doubtless been remarkably close to
the top of the winning list. Higpins Is
back !r. the saddle ajFrain and riding with
all the cleverness he displayed earlier.
He i? the best of the present "lightweight
division in the ea?t and Is one booked for
the San Francisco tracke.
CLEVER JOCKEYS COMING.
Kvory effort has been made to Induce
Fuller to po to the San Francisco tracks,
and if It was not for the contract held
by Archie Zimmer he would accept an of
fer. However. Zimmer will race a string of
his own at New Orleans and will take the
olever rider with him. It was at New Or
leans last winter that Fuller came first
into prominence, and his season about
New York has been phenomenal. He has
more stakes to his credit than any other
Jockey and has eclipsed most of the for
mer records of famous Jockeys. Zimmer
has :Â» contract that runs two years more
and is said to have made over $100,000 this
year, while Fuller has earned almost as
much for himself. Hicks, the colored
rider from New Orleans, Is another who
has r*een named In the lot booked for
San Francisco who will not bo on hand.
Hicks is under contract to A. J. Plicque,
who, like Zimmer. will race a stable of
horses at New Orleans.
With these two exceptions, a vast ma
jority of the l>est Jockeys who have put
In the season about the New York tracks
will spr-nd the winter either at San Fran
cisco or Los Angeles.
George Odom pMH talk* of retiring from
the saddle, but will surely visit the Far
West before doing so. Odom has grown
considerably In the past year and he can
hardly do less than 113 pounds.
Jockey John Butlman, who vrfll go to
San Franciscn. recentlv received a letter
from his younger brother informing him
that he would better look to his laurels
or he would eclipse him In tht saddle.
Bullman expects the "kid," as he calls
him. to make a first-class Jockey, and
cays !f the youngster shows promise this :
season at the San Francisco winter meet
ing he will bring him East next spring
and cive him a chance with the best of
them.
AHTJMADA IN KYLE'S STBING. '
When "Doc" Kyle ships his good stake i
performer Ahuirada to San Francisco he
will have in the same car several horses ;
from the stable of J. G. Follansbee and '
IT. H. Kraft. This string promises to
be a formidable one and will be added to .
before the shipping day comes.
Frank Regan will Wave on the same
train with Kyle. He expects to have at '
least eight horses ready to race. Both '
of these trainers will have stake per- '
formers in their care, and in fact there '
are no horses leaving for the coast with
out liberal stake engagements, even to '
the yearlings that are for the most part '
only partly tried. On the other hand '
there are some youngsters booked for '
San Francisco that are alreadv well de
veloped, and quarters In 23'i seconds pro- '
nounces th<=m as worthy of consideration '
In the early two-year-old fixtures. 1
W. M. Barrick, who has only mpt with "
moderate success during the metropolitan <
ecason, will have a try at San Francisco. *
At present McMeekln is about the best
one In his string. Van Ness was recently 1
sold and Smart Set has been some dis- "
tance from a race all season. He has 1
betn improving somewhat recently, how- 1
ever, and may be taken to the coa6t- I
In the lot Regan will take will be the
good two-year-old Dick Turpin. Others
wili be Oarsman, Nevermore, Namtor j
and a couple of highly tried yearlings. 1

period of the. baseball season. Los An

by the score of 7 to 2. xne fielding of
the home team was perfect, while only
one error marred the record of the vis
itors. Gray was effective throughout the
game, but Cooper nad a period of weak
ness in the seventh, when the locals bat
ted out six runs. Cravath accomplished
the extraordinary feat of batting the ball
over the fence twice for home runs. Ray
mond and Eager made their first appear

tured the fans by their splendid work.
Raymond did some particularly spectacu

NEW YORK, Nov. 4.-Efforts are beinjr
made to have Jim Jeffries fight in San
Francisco before the summer comes
again. Joe Egan, Jeffries' secretary, re
ceived a dispatch to-day from the Colma
Athletic Club offering a purse of $20,0SO
for a twenty-round bout between Jeffries
and Sam McVey. the big California
negro. Jeffries, without much hesitation,
said he would not consider It. "I have
made up my mind never to fight a nesrro
again as long as there are white men in
the field." he said. "Then again, McVey
is not to be regarded as a championship
possibility. His last fight resulted in de
feat by Jack Johnson. The latter is a
little fellow, compared to McVey. so I
don't see where the latter figures at all."
Jeffries Befuses to Fight McVey.

by Keefe, the youngest pitcher in the
California league, went up against the
veteran. Jay Hughes, to-day and the re
sult was a shutout for the Seattle team.
The game was one of the best and fast
est of the season. It was a game in
which it was easily to be discerned that
both teams were out for blood and the
second place. As a pitcher's contest, hon
ors were about even, although- there was
perhaps a trifle more polish on the de
livery of Hughes. His team mates could
not hit Keefe when hits were needed and
the Senators gained a victory. Score:

Ham Iberg was in great form through

Portlands did make a bunch of three runs
and all in the first Inning. He had them
under the spell of his magic slow float

up by the fielders were the salvation of
the visitors.
The field was in bad condition after the
heavy rain of the night before and it was
with difficulty the fielders traveled over

visitors and two by the natives. . All of
these helped to keep runs away from the

mad infatuation for the Pickerell woman.
who goes under the name of Harry Liv
ingstone, Is Pearl "Waldron. who last night
shot . herself, inflicting a wound which
will probably prove fatal. In March, 1502,
Hazel Walters, a young woman of respec
table parentage, committed suicide by
swallowing carbolic acid. Her discovery
that Uvtnsrstone was a woman caused
her to take her life. It Is not known
whether such a discovery was responsi
ble for Miss Waldron's attempt to end
her life, though it is certain her attach
ment for the Pickerell woman is what
led up to her effort at self-destruction.
Miss Waldron was found in Denny Park
late last nizht stretched on the grass
with a bullet wound in her chest. A 32
caliber revolver, partly wrapped in a silk
handkerchief, lay alongside her. She was
in a semi-conscious condition and was
removed to the Wayside Mission Hos
pital. By dint of much persuasion. Dr.
JoJtnscn prevailed upon her to give her
name and address. After doing so she
requested that Harry Livingstone, who
she said resided at 2212 First avenue, be
communicated with. The address is that
of the Pickerell woman and the name
her alias. Dr. Johnscn is of the opinion
that the chances for the woman's recov
er:.- are exceedingly slight. The bullet
evidently r>enetrated the cavity of tba
chest and is thought to have lodged dan
gerously near if It did not enter some
vital organ.

President Wheeler, In a historical re
view of the older American colleges, then
discussed the movement toward public
controt of such institutions, showing: that
the larger ones among them have now
come so fully to appreciate the essential
responsibility to public sentiment and
public needs, that in spite of the outward
form of their government they may be
said, nevertheless, in some very real
senses to be public institutions and under
public control. President Wheeler con
cluded as. follows:
Long aÂ» your rac-untains stand, here stands
the University of Arizona â in teaching. Influ
ence and examole, clear^ine and pure as th*
sur_Â«hine t. K at r-urges ycur nil's: in sympathy

j the difficulties and complications which I
! on every hand beset the president of a \

BACKHANDED STEALING.

: blackmail and backhanded stealing, but is toi

i tcience. who dazedly conform to thÂ» vulgar no- \
; tion that seme way or other public, money 'â¢

i that man has used public money wherewith t>> :
i *ett!e private aco>unts: he ha3 treated a pcbllc '

Among other difficulties one haa teen alleged
I to inhere tn the position of a university under :
i public control which may fa some circurn- [

thereto. A State university should lend no aid ;

The ceremony was performed in the
marble room, where in one corner Miss

pink and white chrysanthemums, over
which were white doves with streamers of
white tulle following their flight. Doves
were similarly arranged with chrysan

ter cf the room. Large clusters of the
same Cowers covered the incandescent
lights around the room and were twined
In all chandeliers. Two long garlands of
chrysanthemums formed an aisle with
tali branches of the flowers placed short
distances apart along the way.
At 9 o'clock music heralded the ap

There are two kinds of
emulsions of cod liver oil â
Scott's and all the others.
Not. one of the latter is as
valuable as Scott's Emulsion
and there's a reason for it
Only the purest ingredients
enter our Emulsion and its
quality never varies. That is
why it helps when all others
fail.
There's not much oil in
the market now; it's scarce
and high in price. But seal
oil and other inferior oils are
cheap and plentiful. That's
why you can buy^so many
substitutes for Scott's Emul-
sion at a lower price.
We guarantee our Emul-
sion to be the best remedy
for weak lungs, low vitality
and wasting conditions. Who
guarantees the others ?
We Tl sesd you a trmplf free, upon request.

At Honduras also the officers of the San
Juan found evidences of discontent, and
all along the coast the people seem to be
weary of the peace which has reigned
with un-Central American monotony for
an unusually long period.
Among the San Juan's passengers was
John Jenkins, Consul General to Salvador.
Arthur Seegmiller, who came up on the
San Juan, has been engaged as foreman
on the Guayaquil and CJuito Railroad.
The road has been built as far as Gua
mote and has been abandoned owing to
the expense of construction.
The San Juan sighted several water
spouts along the coast. She brought thir
ty-three passengers, 860 tons of cargo and
treasure valued at $40,500. Her passengers
included the following named: Hettie
Hopper, John Jenkins, William C. Wade.
Guy S. Putnam, Amalie Bloedel, Vincent
Carroll, E. G. Bogl, John C. Charles, Her
man Schneider and James M. Pearson.
While there had been no outbreak
at the Isthmus when the liner left, evi
dences of a pending revolution were plain
ly visible, and the majority of the people
were apparently only awaiting the ap
pearance of a leader to declare themselves
and back up their declaration of inde
pendence with a fight.
THE Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship San Juan, Captain Urry, ar
rived early yesterday morning
from Panama and way ports.
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5,
When Crowley discovered the body he
immediately summoned the different
members of the family to the 5pot. after
which the body was cut down. After it
had been released for perhaps half an
hour it was discovered by one of the
two women who had been called in that
the body was still warm. Dr. Shumate,
who resides near the Crowley residence.
was summoned, but when he arrived he
pronounced the woman dead.
The relatives of the woman pleaded
that the body be left in their hands, and
the Deputy Ccroner, who arrived on the
scene, acceded to their request.
Tho deceased was born in England in
JS-S3 and leaves no children. Mrs. Crowley
owned considerable property in this city.
Including the home in which she lived.
Mrr. Eliraoah Crowloy. O yean of age.
committed BUldde by hanging yesterday
af ft moon at hor home, L'sQ Clay street.
Mrs. Crowley and her husband. William
Crowley. hal lived tug-other at the num
ber given ft.r the last thirty ytars, and
during that :ime there had been no quar
rels between the two that could have
lod to the woman's suicide.
Friends and relatives of Mrs. Crowley
yay that for some time she had been in
poor health, and that during; the last few
months had shewn sigr.s of Insanity. Six
v.e< ks ago The v.as taken to the French
Hospital, where ?he was treated for her
ailrr.er.t5, and after two weeks of treat
ment she returned home. The recent signs
of inpuiisy, however. Induced her hus
band to make arrangements for her re
moval to another hospital. Last Tuesday
he engaged a room for her at St. Luke's,
to which ulrice she was to be taken in a
few days.
Crowley left his home yesterday after
noon at 1 o'clock and. returning at 4,
found his v.-ife's dead body hanging by a
rre tied to the back porch about twelve
feet from the ground.
Indications show that the woman had
stood on a box and after fastening the
rope aruund her neck kicked the box
from under hir.
THE MYSTERIOUS FOUR.
Mr. Bulger at this Juncture said:
"The ship's articles show that there
were twenty-four men in the crew, eleven
adult and two child passengers and two
stowaways, making a total of thirty
nine. Now there were twelve on one
raft and nine on another and eighteen
in the captain's boat. Who were those
four people lost from your boat?"
"I don't know, sir. I knew none of
the passengers," replied Ravens.
The inspectors were unable to judge
whether the second officer's figuring was
wrong, or whether there were really four
people unaccounted for.
The investigation was continued until
to-day at 1 d. m. *
SAILORS JUMPED IN.
Why did you place those passengers in that
boat, instead of putting seamen in her?
When I lowered her, I aung out for men to
Jump in and hold her to the ship's side and
they Jumped in. I thought the sailors would
be of morn service in lowering the boat than
the passengers. I didn't order them in. they
Jumped in of their own accord.
Continuing, Ravens said:
My room was right over the propeller and
when the ship struck I felt the wheel stop.
Whether It started again or not I can't say,
but it didn't start again while I was in there.
It took me five minutes to dress myself and
the engines did not start in that time.
There were nine men on the life raft and
all but four succumbed. The water covered
the raft up to the knees of the men. Those
who could stand up lived, but the weaker ones
had to crouch on their hands and knees, the
waves washing continually over them. They
â¢were practically drowned. But four of us
were saved and all were sailors. There were
two or three passengers on my raft.
I think I was stationed with the captain.
You wouldn't have known what boat to feo
to. then, in case of sudden disaster, causing
tin- fibuiu'onment of the ship in the night time?
I fhould have gone to the starboard boat.
T do not know what boat I belonged to.
You, as second mate of the ship, did not
know what boat you belonged to?
One of . the sailors. I asked him why he
lowtred w'thout my orders and he replied
that he d!dr/t do it. I then told him to let
go the aftc tackle. I expected to jump into
the boat as soon as she was loose.
Was tlif- Bhlp going at this time?
I don't think so.
Ccvildn'* you have saved the boat if you
had gene down the tackle?
' Nc. because she was unhooked by the waves
right away.
What boat were you stationed at?
LOWERING OF BOAT.
Questions by Inspector Bulger and an
swers by Second Officer Ravens then
came as follows:
If there were eighteen men in the captain's
boat and twenty-one on deck, where did those
four who were lost from your boat come from?
I don't know. sir. I knew nothing of the
number aboard.
"Why didn't you have those men out of the
boat when you left to cross the deck?
I wanted them to hold her to the ship's
Fide.
Who lowered the boat?
When the ship struck I came on deck and
Bounded the hold for water. I found that she
had made four and a half feet. The captain
and I walked over to tho starboard boat and
I had it swung over the side. The captain
said. "Ravens you take charge of this boat."
I lowered my boat to the rail of the main deck
and put four men in it to hold it to the ship's
tide and keep it from being broken. I had
but two sailors to assist me. I walked to the
other sido of the ship to sec how many persons
would be left for my boat. When I returned
one of the sailors had lowered away the boat
and the four men in it were thrown into the
water as she capsized. . *
When the investigation was resumed
yesterday Second Officer Ravens occupied
the stand. He said he did not know the
compass deviation and had never used
any sounding apparatus but the lead and
line, as he bad no orders from the cap
tain to use the patent sounding tubes.
He had never changed the ship's course
without the captain's order. Ravens con
tinued:
Ravens said that he did not know where
his station was in case of sudden disaster
and that he did not know the deviation
of the compasses on board. He said that
the engines were stopped when the ves
sel struck. His room was right over the
propeller and he Bays that he heard it
stop, contradicting the testimony of the
engineer.
DIDN'T KNOW HIS STATION.
Did the steamer South Portland, which
was wrecked off Cape Blanco last month,
carry thirty-nine souls or forty-three?
The ship's articles place the number at
thirty-nine, and Captain* Mclntyre and
Mate Bruce both testified that that was
the number aboard.
According to the testimony given by
Second Officer Ravens yesterday before
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger there were
four passengers drowned by the capsiz
ing of his boat when she was launched.
If this is the case the captain was car
rying more passengers on his vessel than
the law allowed and has been endeavor
ing to shield the fact from the inspec
tors.
These men whom Ravens claims went
overboard from his boat "were drowned
before any of the life rafts were launch
ed. When he left the ship there were
eleven men on his raft. Two of these
swam over to Mate Bruce's raft, leaving
Ravens nine men and increasing Bruce's
load to twelve. In the boat launched by
tho captain there were eighteen souls,
making the total of thirty-one, as given
in the ship's papers and testifled'to by the
master and mate.
Who were these other four men and
where did they come from? is the ques
tion that battled the inspectors yesterday
afternoon. Whether Olticer Ravens was
mixed in his figures or whether the ship
was carrying more passengers than the
law allowed and master is endeavor
ing to keep in from the inspectors is yet
to be brought out.

What is wanted of soap
for the skin is to wash it
clean and not hurt it.
Pure soap does that. This
is why we want pure soap;
and when we say pure,
we mean without alkali.
Pears' is pure; no free
alkali You can trust a
soap that has no biting in
it, that's Pears'.

The. north continues to send down liberal
shipments of FeedstufTs, but the market shows
no weakness, and, In fact,' Middlings are 50c
higher on the Inside quotation. The showery
weather tends to weaken Hay somewhat. The
circular of Somers & Co. says;
"Shipments of Hay are still on the decrease,
the total for the week Just ended amounting to
but 1300 tons. 100 tons less than for the week
preceding. In spite of such light arrivals the
market shows but little change, the demand
being exceedingly limited. -A certain quantity
of Hay Is being shipped coastwise right along,
but for the moment the town trade is exceed?
lngly dull and all the retail dealers are com
plaining. The majority of shipments by water
still continue to be Alfalfa, so that practically
all demands for Hay must be satisfied by rail.
The shortaere of cars Is becoming moro" pro
nounced and, from what we can learn, will
continue for the. next month or so. Town ware
houses are being emptied and as soon as there
19 any increase In the demand locally we will
surely see some little excitement on the mar
ket.
"Choice Wheat Hay continues to be a rather
Bcarcn article, the shortage of cars being more
marked In the Llvermore and Holllater dis
tricts, from which two points we draw the
most of our choice grades. Alfalfa continues
to come quite plentifully and straw Is now be
ing shipped more freely."

Chicago Grain Market:
CHICAGO, Nov. 4.â News in the wheat pit
was bearish. English cables being lower, out
side markets weak and local receipts Increased.
There was a disposition throughout the day
among the local traders to sell December, one
of tbe chief Incentives to Â«uch action being
the decline In the price of that delivery at St.
Louis. Opening on December was a shade to
%c lower at 70%@7l>%c, and with lib
eral offerings and but a small demand the
price declined gradually. Reports of damage
to the crops- In Argentina caused a slight
rally toward the noon hour and the market
held quite steady until the last half hour,
when a eudden decline occurred on selling by
Armour, who has been a heavy seller the past
two days. December sold oft to 78%@78%c
and closed at 78%c. a loss of 1%@1%c.
Corn ruled firm the greater part of thÂ« day,
but eased off later. December closed a shade
lower at 43%&43%c.
Oats were weak In sympathy with wheat.
December closed a shade lower at 34%ti35c.
Provisions eased off some In sympathy with
the decline In price of holding. January pork
closed 2%c lower, lard a shade lower and ribs
were off 2%@5c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Aside from a fair demand for choice table
Grapes, trad* In the fruit market was quiet
during the early morntns hours, owing to thÂ«
wet weather. Suitably packed Grapes were In
demand for shipment on the Portland steamer
and tine Tokay and Cornlchon sold for that
purpose at 75c per crate. Prices of the other
varieties ranged from 50c to 65o per crate. The
local demand for large boxes was brisk, as
retailers were stocking up. expecting that thÂ«
rain would lessen to-.iay's receipts. Small
orchard boxes of Tokay gold at 7. r >c per box.
while large boxes of Tokay, Cornlchon and
Black Ferera were steady at $1 25.- The Mus
cat variety had the most call and cleaned up
well at $1 75@2. There were liberal receipts
of Figs from Sonoma County, most of which
came to hand late and in poor, condition,
having been exposed to the rain while in tran
sit. Prices were easier and .there was quite
a surplus unsold at the close." The other trea
fruits were without quotable change. Straw

end correspondingly less money bring required
to carry them, speculation is likely to be en
â¢â¢ouraged thereby. Confidence it gradually re-
owing to the belief that liquidation is

vhich r*cent shocks have been stood is prac
tical evidence of the foundness of this belief.
The outlook, therefore, is. for a more active

These are harr.r>Â«-rÂ«d by development* in Iron

in irÂ«n and stÂ«^l products. Outside of the*e

great railroad systems continue on their

road managers, however, are awaiting with
keen interest the Northfrn Fecuritieg decision
from the Supreme i.'ourt in December, and are
already reported a* feeking other methods of

"Though occasional Â«UsturbÂ«nc-ef. such as
the copper war and the run on St. L^uis
banking institution*, k^ep the stock market
in a Â£tÂ»mewhat nervous condition, the general
trÂ»nÂ«l in financial circles is toward further
iinptwem^nt. This is d<iÂ» to th* belief that
the forced liquidating movement has about
reached ire en<l. snd that no further serious
trouble is looked for from that source. It 1r
known that important points of weakness have

Is generally admitted now that the country

FUPP'y has overtaken demand, and that the
latter can only be revived by the ordinary and
inevitable methods of concession. This ap
plies nÂ«t only to Wall Ftre^t but to thÂ» whole
business world. Wall yfreet ha* Fireply sppre
bÂ»nd*d this fact first : it has fores-Â»en the In
Â«-vttable and adjusted itself to events as usual
8lmr*t before their occurrence. It is quite
probable, therefore, that if no further strictly
Wall ttreet difficulties develop the stock mar
ket will be comparatively indifferent to bu*i
nest contraction simrly because it has been
discounted. These remarks, however, apply
cnly to standard securities. Already these
fhow a very decided tendency to cut away
from low priced and doubtful properties, anl

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
In stocks this morning, with same show of
etrength, but neither lasted the day out. The
market had fallen back Into a professional
rut Jn the afternoon and prices were quite
below Monday's closing. In a few prominent
Flocks the decline reached a point, but the
whole movement was trivial and the market
Insignificant. The professionals, who had the
market to themselves, bid up prices in the
morpiiig In the hr>i>* that some outside demand
would be attracted by the engagements of
gold for Import. Their idea was that j>os
cibly buying had been strained on Monday
on ins: to the Tuesday holiday. The stocks
of the New- York corrwatlons also shot up
this morning under operations by professional
traders, who based their transactions on ex
pectations of po55lble results of yesterday's
elections. Tfce opening advance was in part
manipulated a* Â«at shown by the free selling
tn realize. The movement in these stocks
dated back to !ast week, when there was a
lieht accumulation based on the coming elec
tion. A batch of fairly favorable railroad
earnings had some effect in helping the open
ing advance, but the railroads were a minor,
feature in the market all day. The check
to the advance began in the United States
Steel soourities. Both the common and pre
ferred stock sagged to within a small fraction
of the rrevious low record. The bonds also
weakened sharply and lost two points on the
early advance. The cause of the weakness
and the eource of the selling were not very
rlear. but much of the selling was attributed
to London account and gave rise to some ru
mors of financial troubles in London, which
were not verified. The reported Intention of
iron manufacturer* to cut prices of pig iron
Ft ill further had a rlepressine effect in the
iron market and steel group. It is feared that
such a cut may be followed by a reduction In
the prices nf finished shapes. Current reports
of conditions in the trade were very dis
couraging and new orders were eaid to be at
the minimum.
The downward course of sterling exchange
was halted and the prtce of gold was marked
up in London. Money was reported in good
supply there, however, leaving the question
open of an advance In the bank rate to
morrow, which would be otherwise expected.
The outgo of currency from here to the interior
continues unabated, the total of $1. 100.000 be
in* made up of a *700.000 shipment to New
Orleans and MOO.noo to Chicago. This is
without allowance for the loss by the banks
to the tub-treasury since Friday of $3,466,000.
At this rate a further import of gold will be
looked to as an offset. The announcement
that one of the smaller trust companies In St.
Louis ha* decided to go into liquidation was
without effect in the early market and the
disturbed conditions en the isthmus of Panama
also seemed to be ignored. The market closed
dull and heavy-
The early evidence of firmness in the bond
market rave plaeÂ«* to a heavy tone. Total
tales. $2,525,000.
United States 3s and the old 4s declined

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
gation of Fein. v
Frank Hecht, third vice president of the
club, testified that Fein had persuaded
him to take out fraudulent papers and
then later had taken both the papers and
the Grand Jury summons from him.
Schwartz said he was one out of about
600 men who were taken to the Court of
Appeals room-to be naturalized on Octo
ber 8, 1902, and that all of them were un
der instructions from Fein and other of
ficers of the Hebrew Jefferson Club to do
as they did.
Schwartz said that he was not entitled
to naturalization papers, but that he was
persuaded to apply for them at the insti-
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 4â At the trial to-day
of Adolph Fein, Ferdinand Schwartz, sec
ond vice president of the Jefferson Club,
told of the part he had played, he said,
at the instigation of Fein, first vice presi
dent of the club, in the naturalization
frauds.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. Nov. 4.-In
the trial of Senator Farrla, charged with
bribery, former Lieutenant Governor
John A. Lee took the stand to-day. He
said he asked Farris to help defeat the
bill to repeal the law prohibiting the use
of alum in baking powders. Farris, wit
ness testified, said it could be easily dona
by holding the bill In committee, but that
the bill was an important one to the
Royal Baking-powder Company and that
the boys of the committee needed money.
He wanted $7000, of which $1000 was to go
to each of six members of the committee
on criminal Jurisprudence pf the Senate
and $1000 to the Senator who Introduced
the bill.
Lee arranged by telephone and tele
graph, he said, with Daniel J. Kelly to
get the money. A check for $8500 was re
ceived by Lee and deposited In the Ameri
can Exchange Bank of St. Louis. The bill
was defeated and he drew out $7000 of the
money and gave it to Senator Farris in
his room at the Laclede Hotel. Farris
divided the money into packages of $1000
each. Lee' got $1500 for his Interest in the
matter.
The dead, all of whom were workmen
employed by the naval ordnance depart
ment, are Fred Ward, Stony Point;
George Morehead, Tompkins Cove; Fred
E. Locke, Peekskill; Patrick Curran, West
Haverstraw; Fred Brown, Haverstraw,
and James Connelly* Peekskill. The
bodies were frightfully mangled, frag
ments being hurled for hundreds of feet.
The Island, which has been used as an
arsenal for years, is on the Hudson River,
forty miles from New York, and shells
and ammunition of all kinds were store!
there.
IONA ISLAND, N. Y., Nov. 4.â Six men
were killed and ten slightly injured this
afternoon by an explosion at the United
States naval arsenal, one, of the largest
magazines in the United States, which is
located here. The explosion occurred
while the men were drawing the explosive
charges from a consignment of old shells
recently sent here from the battleship
Massachusetts. Three massive shell
houses were totally destroyed, and a rain
of fragments of projectiles of all sizes
was scattered in every direction.
Â¦ The force of the explosion, or series of
explosions, broke windows at Peekskill,
three miles below on the opposite side
of the Hudson, and the detonation was
heard for many miles. Adjacent buildings,
including two storehouses for fixed ammu
nition, were riddled with the fragments,
and the quarters of the eleven marines
composing the garrison were completely
demolished.

MANY IMPROVEMENTS
AT THE LICK HOUSE
The Santa Fe Railroad is having rock
work of practically a similar nature done
on a basis of 75 cents per ton of 2000
pounds. In the bid under discussion' the
bidders take for a basis ..the long ton,
which is 2240 pounds, and. this would
bring up the value on. this ratio to 84
cents. It Is this difference between 84
cents and $1 09 that Is causing- the debate.
One hundred thousand tons of rock will
be required for the work. In the work
that the Santa Fe Railroad is having done
their contract does not call for any rip
rapping, while in the King street bulk
head this will be required at the water
line. But even with the additional cost
of this proposition it has not been made
clerfr to the Commissioners how such a
difference can exist between the lowest
bid offered by the contractors and the es
timate of the Commissioners' engineer.
Kirkpatrick could not understand this.
He' wanted It explained fully before he
could give any sanction to the awardment
of the contract.
The awarding of the contract for the
new King street sea wall bids fair to
bring up some lively discussions before
the Sea Wall Commission. Commissioner
Kirkpatrick, who has been away for some
time, was present at the meeting yester
day, and when the question was laid be
fore him he at once asked that the sub
ject be deferred for further consideration
until he could have ample time to look
into the matter. President Spear and Sec
retary Mackenzie concurred In this sug
gestion, and the question was laid over
until the regular meeting on next Wednes
day.
It appears that Lot D. Norton, the en
gineer for the Harbor Commissioners, had
estimated the cost of the improvements
to be $100,000. In response to bids to do
this work the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf
Company put in the lowest bid, which was
$111,000. being $11,000 in excess of the orig
inal estimate.

toned his vest to get the gold Lewis
pulled himself together and grappled with
Murphy. Lewis was thrown to the

the United States District Court asking
that he be declared an Involuntary bank
rupt. They allege that he owes more than
$15,000, and that on October 29 of this year
he committed an act of insolvency by suf
fering F. J. Bettencourt. George Cleveland
and other creditors to obtain a preference
over other of his creditors by means of
attachment suits on hrs property. Chong
Wo has left the country and his property
Is In the custody of a Justice of the Peace
In Pajaro. As the stock is of a perishable
nature the petitioning creditors ask that
United States Marshal John H. Shine be
placed In charge.
The latter petition has been taken under
advisement.
He Has Gone, and a Pajaro Justice
Has His Estate in
Charge.
CTHONQ WO'S CREDITORS
AFTER HIS PROPERTY
The women were not daunted by the
sight of blood and sailed into the fight
with vigor. Most of them came out badly
scratched and bleeding. During the pro
gress of, the melee every table in the
place was upset and nearly every dish
and article of crockery broken. Two or
three mirrors were shattered and both
glass doors were smashed.
Police Officer Connor heard the racket
and hastened to the scene/ Before he ar
rived nearly all who were able had taken
flight, but he succeeded in arresting Ben
jamin Wilson and Clarence Estelle and
charged them with disturbing the peace.
Both had been badly battered.
There were about forty people in the
house when a colored man entered and
seated himself at a table beside a whffe
man. The white man resented this and
was sustained by other Caucasians. Then
several colored men and women who
were seated by themselves in the rear of
the eating house arose and the fight was
on. About twenty people who did not
care to participate made for the street,
while the others remained and took a
hand in the hostilities. Coffee cups, cat
sup bottles and fists were the principal
weapons. j.
A race war broke out in Lund's restau
rant, at 215 Grant avenue, early yester
day morning, and before Police Officer
Robert Connor, who ran to the place,
could interfere, several heads were ,cut
with bottles and coffee cups. Two arrests
were made. The trouble was between
negroes and whites and was fast and
furious while it lasted. Not only were
men "engaged in the fracas, but women
took a hand and fought with all the fe
rocity of their male companions. When
the trouble ceased the restaurant was in
a sorry condition. More than $100 damage
had been done.
Discussing the decision yesterday, Pres
ident Arthur Holland and General Coun
sel Tirev I,. Ford of the United Rail
roads stated that the press dispatches
were simply a repetition of the advices
the company had received, and they add
ed that while the advance in wages would
materially add to the company's expenses
and possibly lead to some retrenchment
the company will abide by the decision
and readjust its pay schedule as soon as
possible.
The demand of the men was for an
advance in pay of 33Vs per cent, but they
will receive but 10 per cent, or about 2
cents additional on each trip, which, how
ever, will mean something like $2 75 a
day for those who have been in the ser
vice of the company for more than two
years and $2 62Vfc for those who have
served a shorter period. No decrease in
the hours Is granted- by the arbitrators,
but in the extra allowance of pay the
conductors and gripmen feel that they
have gained at least one important point
and the more desirable one of the two
for which they contended. The decision
of the board is effective until May 1 next
year, and in the meantime there Is little
likelihood of any further trouble.
Yesterday morning's dispatches convey
ing the news that the board of arbitra
tion had granted an advance of 10 per
cent in the pay of men who had been
in the employ of the company for two
years and an Increase of 6, per cent to
those who have served less than that
period were read eagerly by the men, and
especially by those who, under an agree
ment made at the beginning of the arbi
tration, will receive extra pay from May
1, the date upon which the advance is
effective. Under this ruling a large num
ber will receive sums ranging from $20
to $40, which the company will pay to
them at the end of the present month.
General satisfaction exists among the
members of the Carmen's Union over the
decision handed down by the board of
arbitration in the case concerning the dif
ferences of the carmen with the United
Railroads. Although the men were not
awarded all that they appealed for, Presi
dent Cornelius stated yesterday that they
would abide strictly by the findings of the
arbitrators.
The order authorizes the Union Iron
"Works to borrow from time to time such
moneys as It may require in the conduct
of its business, and to pledge or assign
the personal property In its possession to
the lender of such moneys and the mon
eys due to It on contracts. The Union
Iron Works may make new contracts and
take new orders for work. Either party
or the receiver, or any party directly in
terested in the property or having liens
thereon "may from time to time apply to
this court for modification of this order
and decree, or for orders or decrees sup
plemental hereto or amendatory hereof."
CONTROLS ITS PROPERTY.
Nothing herein contained shall be held to
impair the title or possession by, or of. the
Union Iron Works of its present cash, billa
or accounts receivable, materials now on hand
or ordered, or which may hereafter be ordered
or received for completion of contracts, or en
tered Into, or amounts due, or to come due on
account of such existing; contracts, or to give
the receiver control of them or any rl*ht or
title thereto; all of which assets shall be held
as the Individual property of the Union Iron
Works, subject to the rlg-hts, liens, equities
and Interests of the creditors of the corpora
tion. Nor shall anything: In this order con
tained molest or interfere with the business
operations of the Union Iron Works as the
same are now being conducted.
It is further ordered that the receiver
do not transfer or cause to be transferred
into his own name any shares of the
capital stock of the Union Iron Works
until further order of the court, and he
is restrained from transferring upon the
books of the Union Iron Works any
shares of its capital stock standing in the
name of the United States Shipbuilding
Company, or in the name of any person
holding the same in trust for that com
pany. He is also restrained from voting
the stock. The order goes on to say:
MAY NOT TRANSFER.
Judge Morrow's order filed yesterday
afternoon ratifies the appointment of Re
ceiver James Smith Jr. and goes on to say
that the present application for the deliv
ery to the receiver of possession of the
land, plant, buildings, machinery, tools
and personal property leased to the Union
Iron Works by the United States. Ship
building Company for the term of one
year, expiring on August 11, 1903, is denied
on account of pending contracts on war
vessels in the United States. The order
allows the works to retain the property
until the completion of the vessels now
under construction.
Mr. Lindley added: "Its existence is
merely perfunctory, yet it is engaged in
the manufacturing business, building all
classes of ships and other machinery, and
the most urotltable of Us work is" t.nat
with which the Government has no con
cern. If there was any beneficial interest
resting in the Union Iron Works as ; t
corporate entity, the receiver is the sole
owner of all the stock of the company
arn should be permitted, in his capacity
of stockholder, to control its manage
ment, but under the order presented by
Mr. Pillsbury there is no one to whom
the Union Iron Works Company can ac
count for the profits, and unless the re
ceiver Is recognized, the business may be
wrecked in the Interest of the parties
who wrecked the United States Shipbuild
ing Company."
Mr. Lindley said of the Union Iron
Works Company, quoting the words of
Judge Beatty: "It has a respectable
name, but its condition is that of. genteel
poverty."
A RESPECTABLE NAME.
NOT PERMITTED TO BOBROW.
Mountford Wilson said that it had been
shown at the hearing' that the receiver
was not permitted to borrow money in
this Jurisdiction. The banks wanted to
be able to rely upon the accounts collect
able and the stock of goods on hand as
their security, knowing that the Union
Iron Works will have possession and con
trol of those and other accounts when
they come in.
Mr. Pillsbury said that the Bath Iron
Works was in exactly the same condi
tion as the Union Iron Works and he- had,
therefore, in the order presented to Judge
Morrow, followed the exact language of
Judge Putnam in that case, except with
regard to two 'or three matters stated by
Judge Beatty In his decision.
Curtis H. Lindley informed the court
that the order as prepared by Mr. Pills
bury had eliminated the profits of the
general business and Mr. Pillsbury replied
that it had been shown by the testimony
that there would be no profits Until the
present contracts were completed.
"in the meantime," continued Mr.
Pillsbury, "the Union Iron Works has to
borrow large amounts of money to keep
going. The testimony has not shown
that there will be any profits for a year
or more. I am afraid that if an account
ing should be ordered now it would in
ject a complication into the situation.
It might affect the financial standing of
the Union Iron Works.- I understand
that the banks are ready to advance
money on the condition that the status
quo be maintained."
marks before Judge Morrow, said that he
had framed the order In accordance with
Judge Beatty's decision and to allow the
corporation to borrow money on its as
sets. He said that the receiver waÂ« not
prepared to furnish the money and that
the banks In this city desired to have tho
local status established before they would
be willing to advance any money to the
Union Iron Works people. k
Mr. Pillsbury, in the course of his re-
