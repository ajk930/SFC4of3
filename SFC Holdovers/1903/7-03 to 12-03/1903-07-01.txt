to-night, enters very fully into the merits
of the contVoVery. After showing that
the corporation is without funds, that
the directors are unable to raise money
upon the corporation credit to meet ma
turing obligations, and that It, therefore.
Is Insolvent, the Judge goes on to say:
'--'.'It would appear that the directors of
the company have abdicated their powers,
and that the company is drifting along
without any guidance. Not only are the
directors not' striving to relieve the com
pany from embarrassments, but they are
advising â¢ "the stockholders to submit to
numerous . extortions . to procure funds,
and threatening foreclosure to those
bondholders who refuse to relinquish the
security of their mortgages. These peo
ple are entitled to. the protection of the
court and that protection can be had
only by the interference of the court and
the appointment of a receiver."

partner In a mining deal. That Is the re
port which was brought back to this city
to-day by Attorney John H. Foley, Who
went to Sonora to investigate the killing.
Brown remains In Jail in Atllla, Mexico,
and as a result of the action of the Amer
ican colonv there the Judge who tried
and acquitted him has beÂ«n removed from
office and a new trial ordered.
Foley reports that the shooting of Swen
sen occurred after he had discovered that
Brown had disposed of the mining, inter
ests In which both were Interested with
out SwCnsen'B consent; that Brown hoped
to marry a Mexican girl, although he had
a wife liere, and that Brown hoped by the
shooting of Swenaen to dg able to show
that not only, was the shooting accidental,
but that Swensen had left Los Angeles
to cacaoc" a suit for divorce. .<*'">â¢
It is known that Swensen knew nothing
of the Bale of the mining- property: that
he did not leave Los Angeles to escape a

wife and several children here, he having
been legally married several years ago.
The mine which caused the tragedy is now
considered one of the richest in that part

The case is attracting a great deal of
attention among surgeons. They assert
it is a most remarkable case, as the bul
let passed entirely through the young
woman's skull. One portion of her brain
is entirely gone, while her tongue is com
pletely paralyzed. Her limbs are cold
to the knees.' The surgeons said immedi
ately after the shooting that she could
not live two hours, but she has already
lived seventy-two hours.

Ozolgosz. too, has been closely watched,
for he threatened to leave the country,
not because of anything he had done, but
in order to escape the odium his broth
er's crime attached to him. He drtads
the notoriety of the ease and says he
would rather go to some other country,
but the authorities are more than aniious
to prosecute Belter to convince Czolgosa
that he is not to be hounded by those who
know of his relationship with McKinley's
assassin. '
LAS A;Â«OELES. June S0.-In the eus
tody cf United States Marshal Chandler
cf Cleveland, Ohio, handcuffed and shack
led because he gave the officer all possl-
W* trouble during the trip "from Cleve
land. Frank Belter arrived here to-day to
rnswer charges of forcing money orders.
Behind that charge there is said to be
cue- of blackraatl, at which the United
States authorities tiavÂ« not taken cognis
ance, but they may do bo later.
TttÂ« complainant is a brother of Leon
Crolgoes, the a.<Â«sasaln of President Me-
Klnley. and he only appealed to the au
ihoritle* *rfcen the demands of the man
pow under arrest became more than he
could bear. Caolgoss appears to b# a de
cent fellow, who it striving to eu til vq mvÂ»
d<*r an assumed name the odium ! cast
uiMn him by he declares was the
insane art Â«f hU brother. He has as.
sumed the name of John Hoffman and
as sucb he* been sending money back to
bis aged mother in Cleveland, he asserts,
to assist her in educating . the younger
members cf the family.
Before he came here he knew Frank
Belter in Cleveland and after the tragedy
in Buffalo he dectares Belter has .been
pursuing him, demanding money as the
price of his silence, otherwise threatening
to expose him to public scorn. For a time
it was fftrough Setter that Csolgoss made
his remittances home, but subsequently
he made them djrect. In some manner
8rtter secured poseeftaion of the money
order* which he was sending and it Is
alleged forged the Indorsement to them,
collected the money and kept It.
This went 09 for quite a whll# and then
young Cxolgofs discovered what was be
ing done. Reluctantly he reported the
matter to the postal authorities and when
he told who he was they communicated
with Washington and secret service men
were placed on the ca*e. They 'are said
to have secured positive evidence of the
duplicity of Seiter and his arrest followed.
He was indicted at the last session of the
United States Grand Jury here and was
returned here to-day to answer to that
indictment.

S That is all I, have to ask you. I hope' the
American public will find by your answer that
you are a true man, a rrfan resolved to do his
duty -and keep 'his 'word. .
."I merely wait to ask. you now, was that a
lie or the truth?* Were you lying to God when
you were consecrated Bishop i of ; New York'
You -know as. well as I'do that the blaspheml
ous memoirs, the ' mass and the bun- worship
are held -by our common church" to be "erron
eous and strange doctrlrre." Will you do what
you promised, calling on God td help you or
will you â¢ not? - - . ' , .
I wish. to remind' you of one thing before I
leave.. When you were consecrated to' the lilgh
of flee of bishop, you were asked: "Are you
ready with all faithful diligence to banish and
drive away from the church arl erroneous and
strange doctrines contrary tor-God's word.' and
both privately, and openly to call upon and en
courage others to do the same?" Solemnly in
the presence of God and the congregation at
the most serious, moment tot your life, you re
plied: "I . am ready,- the \Lord- being my
helper." .
I had no idea of making a commotlbn ' in
this city." Traveling for rest I attended public
worship, not the â¢ worship of God, but of a
senseless bun, at the Church of St; . Mary the
Virgin on Sunday -week, and I felt compelled
to call your attention . and thai of the pub
lic to the ldalotry of whlch'I am the witness.
Your, reply was net worthy of ' a ; Christian or
a gentleman, Â¦ and I. have no doubt but by this
time you are heartily ashamed .of it. For
my part 1* condoned a' letter, â¢ evidently writ
ten In a moment of hot-headed passion.
I am. If God spares me, to return to 'this
country; early In the- new year and conduct
a campaign against Idolatry here and in other
cities of. the United States... My American
friends do not regard me as an impertinent
interloper,:but are glad. to Join hands with one
of the Anglo-Saxon race- from whfehever side

NEW" YORK;.. June 30.â The Rev. R. *C..
Filllngham, vicar of- Hexton, England',
apostle of anti-ritualism, who sailed for
England- to-day,- has sent another letter
to Bishop Henry Cv Patter., in which" he
says: ."'.Â¦'.â¢Â¦
"Mr. Hill ehot me. He presenied a let
ter of endorsement to me for a 'place In
the department. I was reading the let
ter when he shot me. I had asked him
About his brother's wife's death. I re
gretted her death very much. Mrs. Hill
was a good woman. I have no idea why
he shot me. May the Lord bless and for
give him. I cannot say more."
The tragedy was the result of a griev
ance Hill had against Love for discharg
ing him a year ago. Hill said after the
shooting:
"I shot Love because he did not treat
me right. I did not shoot myself."
J. W. Stephens, an employe of the de
partment, who was working near by
Love's private office,' rushed in and made
an attempt to take the pistol away from
Hill. In the struggle the pistol was dis
charged and Hill was wounded in the
breast. He was picked up and carried to
the Austin Sanitarium. He will die. Love
gradually sank and died an hour after
being shot. Just before dying Comp
troller Love made the following state
ment:

Hill, an ex-employe of the Comptroller's

sented Love a letter 'recommending Hill
for a position in the department. While
Love was reading the letter. Hill, without
a word of warning:, drew a 44-calIbre pis
tol and fired at the Comptroller's breast.
The ball took effect just below the left

"FLOATERS" NOT WANTED.
In the afternoon Manager Chapman
took the stand. He testified that the com
pany always endeavored to secure em
ployes who were polite, honest and care
ful. The large number of applicants and
the small number of vacancies made this
fairly easy for the company. The rule
in engaging men was that they must
be fully five feet seven and a half inches
In height and they ought to weigh -over
150 pounds.
The corporation in engaging men was
careful to get a pood identification of
them to guard the company against
"iioaters." He explained that "floaters"
were men who went from one city to
the other and after they have securea the
confidence of. the company" they . were
working for they would commence to sys
tematically rob the corporation. Men
were rewarded for meritorious services.
Should a man save the life of a child
or avert a serious accident, he was gen
erally presented with $25. About $100 had
been paid out this way In the last year.
Chapman started in street car railroad
ing In 1SS3 by driving a horse car. In
1S05 he learned to operate an electric car
and picked up the duties very quickly.

The first witness called by Livernash
was T. J. Sullivan of the Bartenders' In
ternational League. He testified that the
minimum wage of bartenders was $55 a
month for six days of ten .hours each a
week, with overtime to be paid at the rate
of time and a half. He knew of bartend- '
ers who earned as much as $125 a month.
All wages had been raised. $10 a month in
his organization five months ago.
Sullivan was followed by Charles A.
Kelley, business agent of the Longshore-*
men's Union. The minimum pay of long
shoremen on docks was 40 cents an hour
and the maximum 55 cents. The mini
mum for overtime" was 53 cents an hour
and the maximum $i. On deep water and j
corporation docks nine hours constituted '
a day's work and on other docks ten
hours. The men, he said, were dissatis
fied, with the present rates of wages, ow
ing to the unsteadiness of the employ
ment. Sometimes a man would only work
two days in a week and then again he
might work a week straight.
Coleman Meagher. business agent of the
Rammers' Union, furnished the only com-
Among other things the manager eald
that he had learned to use the controller
of an electric car in half an hourâ that
the man of ordinary intelligence could run
a car In one day and thoroughly operate
the brake in two days. He also consid
ered the ordinance passed by the Board of
Supervisors compelling all men to be stu
dents seven days before being allowed to
run a car an injustice to some men, as
they are capable of filling the position In
three days. He landed a bomb in the
carmen's camp before leaving the witness
stand by testifying that the intelligence
and capability necessary for a man to
run a car was about equal to that of a
man who trundled a wheelbarrow full of
bricks up to a building.
BARTENDERS' SALARIES.
the last named testified in ref
erence to the degree of skill necessary for
a man to make a good motorman in San
Francisco. Chapman had been recalled
by L/ivernash for this purpose. This was
all In connection with the taking of tes
timony in the arbitration proceedings be
tween the United Railroads and its em
ployes.
FOR hours yesterday afternoon E.
J. Llvernash and General Manager
George H. Chapman of the United
Railroads faced each other, while
This closed Manager Chapman's testi
mony for the day. Owing to the carmen's
gathering to-day at the' Chutes there will
be no testimony "taken until to-morrow
at 10 -o'clock. On Friday -there will be
only a moraine session.
"No,' I don't. One' man sjmply turns a
crank and moves .a car and .the other
picks up a barrow by the -handles and
moves it up -to the building. We have
men who Worked as bricklayers arid they
make eood carmen. Any "man who ca-n
trundle a barrow ".of .brick* can run "a
car." . . Â¦
"Well," continued Ltverna.sh, "does It
not require a certain amount of skill to
trundle a wheelbarrow* full of "bricks?"
"No, I don't think it requires much skill
to do that," answered Chapman.
"Don't you think, Mr.. Chapman', that it
takes more skill to operate a "car on the
Fillmore street grade than to wheel a baj
row full of bricks.?" '
"If I saw the. man and I thought he
was capable; I would," Chapman replied.
"Supposing a man worked- a week â
would you think, him capable to operate
a car-on the Fillmore. Haipht. Jackson, or
Castro lines.?" ask-ed Uverna'sh.
"Yes," Manager Chapman replied: "I
consider the seven-day' ordinance an In

cannot learn to run a car in eight or ten.

I see no reason why the latter should

"Js.lt possible for motoxmen to become

"Yes, sir," Chapman replied promptly.
"Does It not take a certain amount of
skill -to runa car?" Liverhas'h asked.
"No, ir dbes not require skill; only a
certain amount of experience is neces
sary," was the reply."
DEPENDS ON THE MAN.
He learned to use. the controller in half
an hour, he said. -Any man of ordinary
Intelllgence'oughfc tcr be competent to run
a car after* three days' practice, he said".
"Mr. Chapman, are "you willing to en
trust the lives of people of San Francisco
In the hands of a man who learned how
to operate a controller in half an hour?"
asked LJyernash. . â¢
"It depends on who. the man is," Chap
man cautiously replied. '. ' '
"Well, would you be willing, to. entrust
the lives of people to a man of one" week's
experience on such a grade as the Fill

MILWAUKEE, Wls.. June 30.-Mrs. F.

of the F. F. Evans Company, reported to
the police to-day that she had been sand

last night. Mrs. Evans says that she had
gone to Chicago Monday to draw her $25â

Bank of. that city. After paying some
debts she had started back on an even
ins train with $16,000 In cash and a cer
tificate of deposit for $2500. On the way
she went into the toilet room of the car.
where another woman entered and struck
her on the head with a blunt instrument.

Still another writes oft the resolutely
patriotic spirit of the Japanese In con
nection with International affair.- and the
fact that their spirit has been fanned by
the Anglo-Japanese alliane. It admits
that there are some who deny the po
tency of that alliance, but claims that
the Japanese nation as a whole is in per
fect consonance with the alliance, which
was established with thie firm determina
tion to maintain that status quo in the
Jar East which is now being menaced by
Russian tactics. The old proposal of an
exchange between Russia and Japan of
Manchuria for Korea has been advanced
and a number of professors of the Imper
ial University are said to have approach
ed Baron Komura to protest against the
proposition.
Other papers are taking up the question
from various points of view, but all indi
cate a common resentment at the Rus
sian attitude that seems to be of a deep
er and more ominous character than ever
before. The Nlroku prints a significant
article in which it says:
An ominous change of tone pervades
the Japanese press. The Japan Gazette
eays in revicwir.gr the Journals that It is
rmw shown that the patience of the press
Is exhausted in regard to Russia in Man

Russia. TRÂ«* petition, according to the
Yokohama paper, is signed by nob'.es and
a larpe number of prominent men.

regarding the visit of General Kuropat

Japan devotes much space to comment
on the visit of the War Minister, who is
generally considered to have no political
mission.

a sediment or settling 1 indicates an un-
healthy condition of the kidneys; .If IX

that the kidneys and bladder are out of
order.
WHAT TO DO:
There Is comfort In the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish In curing rheuma-
tism, pain In the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold wa-
ter and scalding pain In passing it. or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant ne-
cessity of being compelled to go often dur-
ing the day. and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for Its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists In flfty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.

It was the decision of the c'ommittee
that Miss Berger should receive the'hon
or. That she is deserving is shown by her
school record. During the past term she
has, in addition to pursuing her" studle3,
worked outside of school hours for her
board and lodging. In her classes, she
was always at the head, and one- af tfte
most ambitious students who ever came
under the notice pf {he faculty. It lias
been* declared by; jhe faculty that if Miss
Berger possessed a fault in her school
work, it was that of working too hard.
She was one of five members of the class
of twenty-one who graduated with honors
and each meniber of her class feela sure'
that the honor conferred upon, her Is'rich
ly deserved. In case Miss Befger accepts
she will enter the State University. as a
student In the college of social science v
class to pursue studios In one of the uni
versities of the State. In other words,
a sufficient sum will be given worthy and
ambitious scholars to insure thein entry
and support while taking* a university
course. The committee appointed for th'ls
purpose consisted of Supervising Princi
pal E. Morris Cox, John P. Plover, Mrs.
Thomas J. Geary, Dr. D. H. Leppo an'd

Uncle JJpnry Rrrlved on the Oakland
batUe grounds yesterday- afternoon, shy
the senices of the reliable Danny Sliay.
Before the game was finished . Lynch, an.
otfcer of the company, was forced to. re
tire because he became too eloquent to
suit the plain taste, of O'Connell, so the
Oakland Cripples got In and beat Uncie's
gathering to a piÂ»!p. Score, 9 tp 5.
The Cripples had quite a ball team
themselves. Instead of some amateur at
short. Brick Devereaux filled the bill and
the versatile Josh rteilly," who plays on
everybody's ball team at times, galloped
around to the third sack. So tho Cripples
wera pretty well off In the way of talent
&Â£ compared with other times. Â¦
It was a pretty rank exhibition of ball
all the way through. Nearly every one con-
S tracked the error habit and all the time
â¢ome blunder or another was happening.
Three easy flies were dropped in the out
. field and two more were misjudged, all
of tbese mistakes costing runs.
" The Cripples started in right away as
though they would annihilate Llndsey.
They landed on his offerings for three
hits and in a twinkling a pair of runs
had crossed the plate. " It might have
been twice as many, only O'Hara was
called out for not touching first, after
knocking out a nice three-bagger.
San Francisco woke up and made "one
in the third. Then in the next round they
rot. busy again and took the kinks out of
* few more of Cooper's alleged myster
ious offerings. Two runs were the- result,
which, put the locals one to the good on
the score.
But this blissful condition did not last
long. With two gone in the fifth, the
Cripples came through with another pair.
In the eighth and ninth they again start
ed in. to touch up Lindsey. Then the lat
ter's support began -to weaken and in all
the Cripples got five more runs, making
the final score 9 to 5.
Cooper got tired of throwing up the
curves and in the fifth-, he quit. Graham,
his brother southpaw, relieved him and
held the locals down nearly all the time.
In only one inning did they score and that
would not have happened had errors kept
aloof.
Lynch was called out on strikes in the
fifth and he Immediately became Indig
nant and began to tell the umpire what
a good man he was. The latter ordered
thÂ© player off the grdunds.. Krug was put
In to finish the game at short and Jimmy
Whalen had to be hauled from the bench
and sent out *o left field. The score:

Bachelder
Has Returned
. Just Back From Oregon and Wash-
ington-He Tells What Happened
to Four of His Friends Who Had
Brtght's Disease and DIabetes-On
Hearing of His Recovery Last Year
They. Too, Went on the Fulton
Compounds.*
FJ. BACHELDER, the Taclflc Court *Â«c-l
â¢ of th* Setb Thomas Clock Co. 203 Kear-
ny tt., this city, has Just returned from another
of hi. Northern trips. He was a victim of
Bright Â« Disease, but -wan cured last year by
FultorÂ«e Compound. He was told of it by ThrÂ«
Klrkpatrl-k, the caoitallst, and was no Â«ur-
priMd and gratified at hia r*cover>- that he in
turn told everybody he could hear of who had
either of thoie diseases. On his fall trip north
last year he Micounterpd four friends who were
willing listeners to his ' One was
thÂ» editor at a well-known Oregon daily an-
other wÂ«Â« an express â¢messeriKer on she 6 R
and If. Co.. a third was a commercial traveler
for a Portland house- and the last was a whole
eale Jeweler in .Seattle. ThÂ« three first had
BrlKhts Disease, the editor, particularly belne
â¢o badly off he could hardly talk, due to uraJf
mio poisoning, while the last one was a case of
Diabetes.
Bachelder now tells us the result* to date in
each oase. He met the traveling man at Day
ton. He stated that be was on the mend in
fact, "ru improving rapidly." a lirtle later
he waa caJled over to a car door by the exnre.,
messenger of the O. R. and N. Co.. who related
a elmilar experience. His wife did not at first
, want him to take the . Compouna, believing
Brisrhfs Disease to be Incurable, but both he
and his wife were now eati-fled that'he would
recover. The newnr>aperman. who was In
*uch an extreme condition, was improving nice
ly, and Bachelder told us -we would probably
hear of the ca*e through the columns of his pa-
per. The fourth the wholesale jeweler who
had Diabetes, had run down to an a'larm-
ing dejrree and was very thin when he went on
th* Compound, although a large man ordina-
rily. Bachelder found him well and again en-
Joying his old proportions and very grateful for
the suggestion that had undoubtedly tiaved his
Hie- VLJUlf Â«MPKÂ»Â«55B)B
Such experiences as .the above- were unknown
up to the date of the discovery of the Fulton
Compounds. We again announce to tbe wortd
tbe curability of Blight's Disease and Dlabeteg.

proof conclusive that upon Thursday
prior to the collapse of Eppinger & Com
pany, Superintendent James Deming and
Bookkeeper Edmund Freund marked thÂ°e
lot numbers on various piles to corre
spond with warehouse receipts held by
the American" National Bank. â¢
Deming held the book and did the dic
tating and Freund the. marking. This
was done at 7 o'clock in the morning.
Two hours later Charles Gove and Rooert
Williams, representatives ot the San
Francisco -Board of Trade, made their .ap
pearance to inspect the wheat ot the
bank They found the lots and numbers
compared aid marked the piles as belong
ing to that bank. This proves that there

* ACT OF INSOLVENCY.
NEW ALLEGATIONS.
THE proceedings In the United
'States District Court in bank
ruptcy against the Pacific Coast
Warehouse Company, otherwise
the Epplngers and Ettlinger, were
discontinued yesterday, as foreshadowed
in The Call yesterday morning. The at
torneys for the creditors decided that it
was better to file a petition in Insolvency
in the State courts against the warehouse
company. This was done, the petitioners
being Isaac Kohn. the San Francisco
Savings, Union, the Nevada National
Bank, the Colusa Bank and the Bank of
Yolo.
An order to show cause why the "Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company should not be I
declared an insolvent debtor was asked
for by the petitioners, and that* a surren
der of its property and estate be made for
the benefit of its creditors.
This was yesterday's sole transaction
of moment in connection with the pro
ceedings to recover from the Epplngers
and Ettllnger. To-morrow the Grand
Jury will resume Its effort* to discover
who Is responsible for tho theft of grain
pledged for $300,000 from the Epplngers
apd Ettlnger warehouses at Crockett.
Seme stories concerning the* evidence that
has been unearthed at Crockett and else
where through the efforts of Detective
Tom Gibson, Constable Moiles and the
private detectives were current yester
day, having in them much of interest.
.PEBJTTRY. IS RUMORED.
One story :s that the Grand Jury has
sufficient evidence of perjury to warrant
Â°an indictment against one of the recent
employes of the warehouse company and
that this Is talked of by the Jurors.
Another is that the disappearance of
Superintendent James Deming and his
sudden reappearance in Crockett and in
this city wgjs not wholly due to the E>>
pingers and Ettlinger. although the part-*
ners of the broken grain firm "stood to
pro/It before the Grand Jury if Demlng's
evidence concerning the conduct- of their
business could be kept out. But there is
a circwmstajitial story that wiH be de
.veloped before the Grand Jury to-morrow,
so it is rumored, that will explain 'why
others: were .willing that Deming .should
not be ibund: J
The substance- of this is tl\at Detective
Glbso.n and associates are in possession of
testimony that wheat claimed by the
American National Bank under ware
house receipts issued in Ap'rll last was not
received in the warehouses until June'l,
and that two days before the failure <Â»f
the firm of Eppinger & *Co was announced
Superintendent Deming and Bookkeeper
Freund, employed by the, Epplngers,
marked the lot with the brand of the
American National Bank. This important
happening, if it can be demonstrated by
witnesses to be true, will be seized on by
the other bariker creditors, who are striv
ing to get a share of the gnaln. The
American National Bank claims, $60,000
worth of this grain and the total value in
warehouse is only about $90,0u0.
WHY DEMING. RETURNED.
Now it Is explained by the friends c of
Superintendent James Deming that the
reason he has. returned from his hiding
place in Oregon so soon is that rumor
reached him that the- lipplngers are to
make him a .Â«capegoat -for their deeds.
The story, as it reached the ears of Dem
ing, in Portland, was that the Epplngers
were saying that Deming reported to
them the grain In warehouse and that
they took his word and Issued warehouse
receipts on the amounts reported. Dem
ing did not wish to stand in. that attitude
toward the creditors, who are constantly
growing angrier Â«s the details .of," the acts
of Eppinger & Co. .become morÂ« clearly
defined. Wlien the wheat was marked as
the proper t-y of the American National
Back, 'as previously related, Messrs. *Gove
and Williams, now witnesses before the
Grand 'Jury, were present. â¢ Five thousand
'sacks were labeled, so goes the â¢ story,
two clays only before the failure of the
ho&se. â¢ .',.
A new story of . interest, to those who
had dealings with Ep'plnger & Co. deals
with a way which was found to "pinch"
the farmer's. When sacks .were weighed
in from the cars instructions were given
to strike off two pounds from each sack's
weight. In the warehouses the sacks af
terward gained weight from moisture,
which was another gain. Then still an
other squeeze'ls reported when the grain,
was shipped. -It is alleged to be the fact
that' the cargo of a ship about due in
Sydney/ Nt S. W., from the Eppinger
Â¦warehouses. wlÂ«l show a shortage of fifty
five tons of wheat and th'at another car
go, as will be testified before the Grand
Jury, will "be shown to have a similar
lack. . This was effected bv having four
sacks of wheat tallied up every few min
utes during the loading of a vessel as
five sacks.

in Jhe State courts against the Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company in essential
details is as follows:

r~\ COTLAXD has been taking a second thought
of the Carnegie gift -of $10,000,000 to her uni-
versities and has found the subject a perplexing
one. When first" the gift was bestowed, it was be-
Jievc'd the income would mean a clear addition to
the revenues of the universities and would extend
the scope of their usefulness." The results have dis
appointed that expectation. The income derived
from student fees is rapidly falling by reason of the
numbers who apply for assistance. from the Carnegie
fund, and fears are felt that eventually the entire, in
come will be expended in support of students .fully
able to take .care of themselves and that there will be
little or no extension of university advantages to a
larger number of students.
The situation was recently summed up by Professor
Story of the University of Glasgow, who in a gradu
tion address to the students is reported as having
?aid-: "They did not know as yet what permanent
effect, if any, the great Carnegie benefaction was,
through its payment of fees, to have, on the number
of students, attending the university. What effect it
was to produce on their character was, he feared, less
uncertain. In the -winter session of 1901-1902 the
fees paid by the students (male) themselves were
Â£6510; those paid by the Carnegie trustees were Â£6239.
In the session of 1902-1903 those paid by the students
were Â£6359, and those paid by the trust Â£7350 â show
ing an increase over the previous year of about Â£1000,
and" also showing that the majority 6f the students
had become be'neficiaries of the trust, and had either
been living hith'erto in unsuspected neediness or were
now reaping the harvest of a c^op sown for such as
they. The same downward grade from independence
to indebtedness marked the summer session of last
year. In it the fees from students were Â£1500, and
from the trustee's Â£2923."
It appears from that statement that the Scottish
students having been provided, with a means to get
university education without cost to themselves have
SCOTTISH STUDENTS.
MAYOR "OLN-BY of Oakland .has suggested
that die -people of.' -that city T.csunie' their
right' of way. over the sidewalks. In all citicj*
thcr,c j.s a corrstaut tendencx tp permanently. . en
crdach .on the sidewalks.: -The interest of tlie public"
in the free way. is surrendered by degrees until in
some places its .very ex.i-stence seems to be forgot
ten. The evil of which' the. .Mayor of Oakland has
taken notice has existed in older States and has
grown to such proportions that the courts have to be
invoiced to curb it. **Y. 4" ' :r < â¢- â¢
In Chicago it has been ". tlie .practice to permit
the projection of bay windows and even the .en
croachment of house walls over the -sidewalks;, and
the city has derived revenue from such permits.
There was always a doubt of the power of a city
government tp grant such .permits, or 'even to close"
a street that is once dedicated to public .use. .The.
Supreme Court of Illinois .has decided recently the
right of encroachment on. the sidewalk to be' non
existent and beyond tfhe power of municipal gov
ernment to confer. The co.urt lays i down a* stern,
rule of la.w that the people/may inalienably enjoy the
use of the foundation or ground of the streets and
sidewalks, every inch of it to travel on, and are en
titled also to enjoy the air, liglit and rainfall on every
portion of it. . " .
When one citizen monopolizes to himself the. ex
clusive occupancy of'any.pertion of this public space,
for the use of his wall or wjndow, he. is doing some
thing which, if its right be* conceded,' means that he
may, in the same manner and on the same terms,
monopolize the use of the. whole sidewalk or all of
the street. Under this decision any citizen can ap
ply to the courts for remedy againsjt Jhe illegal oc
cupancy of street -or sidewalk, and the occupie'r can
not plead a permit from a city government . which
that government had no right to grant, 'nor can he
recover money paid for such. privilege.

negroes were forced into involuntary service Â° .
There are th'mgs in human relations that law can
not regulate. As the negro race gets further away |
from slavery it loses the discipline of that institu- j
tion, which had many beneficial features, and does
not acquire the restraint that should take its plac'e.
The deprivation of political rights has been followed*
by an expression 6f irresponsibility, in the form of
Vcrime committed by negroes, and* this by a savage
lynching of blacks by whites. The use of the forms
of law to subject negroes to peonage, which is more
general in the S6j:th than the Xprth suspects, so So
phisticates criminal statistics that the country has no
reliable information upon which to base an esti
mate of the percentage of crime against * them.
Whether our thirteen million negroes commit more
than their share of sr.-ious crfrnes . is not known,
and under present- conditions cannot be known.
One thing appears to be certain â the Northern Â°ne
j-jroes, long donrcsticattd in this section, are as or- I
derly as their white neighbors and show no undue
percentage of crime. Xhe flagra.nt offenses com
mitted by members of the race" in the North are al
most entirely the acts of Southern negroes, who
have crossed Mason and Dixon's line. This has
been true of the unspeakable offenses that were
punished by lynching in Colorado and Kansas.
It would seem that one need not seek far for the
cause of good order among the Northern negroes.
They have all the political rights that the whites en
joy, and have before them constantly the good ex
ample of law and order in the community. They are
at work like the white people around them, and their
children are in school. They support churches and
other institutions of religion and morality. They
have no more social equality with the whites than
there is in the South. But they are greeted without
â¢Â¦harshness and feel the touch of human sympathy for
their welfare. They improve by the atmosphere of
order and law which is around them.
Of "course it must be admitted that much in their
condition comes from their being a minority of the
population, while in the South the race suffers wher
ever it is in the majority and is subjected to the
violent control .of white men. Its subjection to peon
age and the perversion of la*w to reduce it to involun
tary servitude are symptoms that may well be
studied by sociologists. Arc these not the signs of
returning slavery? Is nature at work, or destiny, or
fate? The neglect of the negro, following upon
emancipation, has produced a generation of them in
parts of the South not much more advanced than
were their wihd ancestors in Africa. Booker Wash
ington finds that class of negroes a very hard for
mation, almost too hard even for his philosophy. It
would be better if the various "black belts" in the
South could be broken ' up and their black people
dispersed and scattered so that they would be minori
ties in white communities. RS
. The North desires to trust the South in respect to
the negro problem. But with a dozen lynchings in
as many days and a dozen more instances of negro
peonage in the South, the confidence of the, North
will require something more inspiring than the pro
fane ravings of Tillman.
/ I Â¦Â» HE lynching of negroes is. on the increase.
I The country begins to appreciate that *itÂ° has
Â¦*Â¦ a race problem on hand, the most serious that
has faced any nation. Two or three years ago The Call
discovered the misuse of the forms of law in .several
Southern^ States whereby negroes were charged wii'h
some. petty offense, and, being promptly convicted,
were turned over to planters or contractors to obe
worked under the lash during the "term of their sen-:
tence.
This system was in vogue extensively, and" prob
ably is yet, but by more recent revelations it seems
that it is not considered necessary to resort to the
forms of law in to subject-'negrdes to involun
tary servitude. The Federal courts have recently se
cured convictions in the South* for subjection of
negroes to peonage. In one case a 'hegro had be
come indebted to a white 0 man, who . caught and
whipped him and compelled him Jo serve him. tn
another case the pretext of debt was omitted and

Special Correspondence *"of The Call.* *
WE have had occasion to tell the sectaries
who attack Mbrmonism, and even assume
that'a professor of that faith is without civil
rights, that the pe'culiar institution of Utah" will â be
more likely to wane if let alone. Attacks from with
out cause solidarity within. :Nothing flourishes un
der "persecution like religion,! no matter what kind it
is. The point .to the advice â¢ that Ephraim be let,
alone, Â°for 0 he' was- joined to his \dols, was
that Ephraim was more likely to quit idolatry if
he. were not pestered and persecuted- about it. .". *
0 No one persecuted Abraham out of the noti'qn of
making a raud man and worshiping- the thing as a
god. He had a streak of comrnon "sense and human'
nature in him, and- perhaps' of humor, too, and he
saw how idiotic it was to endow with supernatural
power that which he had made with his own hands.
But if some one had ccyne along and called him a
flathead and ordered him to cease the worship of
images Abraham would have gone on making and
worshiping idols though he "might have hanged for
it All men are religious, for religion is every man's
conception* of his relation to the universe, and we be
lieve that ru> tribe has been found that is without
ideas as to the universe and how the members there
of came to be a part of it.
Ikniay be truthfully said that the legends of man's
origin differ mostly in the diction in which they are
tcJd by the different races. Each bears traces of an
attempt to account for something by pure invention.
The Book of Mormon is sucli an invention, Sidney
Rigdon and the other "witnesses" to the contrary
notwithstanding. But the essentials of the Mormon
crefd are the essentials in all creeds, and there is in
that "form of faith no peculiar excellence that should
Â¦make it outrun any other form. Those who object
to it as a religious institution and propose to re
prove it as such are simply planting it deeper and
giving it energy to resist the storms of time through
an infinitely prolonged future.- . In the. reasonable
view there can be no objection to Mormonism as a
religion. The creed does not conflict with* good citi
zenship, and belief in it is consistent with social law.
The offensive, feature in M'ormonism is that the
church is a government, and. the Hierarchy has not
yet outgrown the itch for wieldipg civil authority,
inherited from the hig.h and mighty days when Brig
ham Young "was prophet of the Lord, head of the
church and civil Governor of Utah Territory. If' we
let the religion that is .in Mormonism' alone and deal
with -its pretensions as a government,' and as a gov
ernment in business,. we will prune its : offensive fea
tures* more rapidly. The institution- is not hurt by
going at 1^ with Scripture texts and attempting to"
uproot jts superstitions by offering others in their
piece. But "when it is opposed as a civil government
thai is in business and in politics for what there is
in them, then human nature fights its pretensions.
c This was proved 'recently in that thriving Mormon
town, Brigham City, which nestles at the. foot . of
the Wahsatch Mo.uhtams t a", few. miles west of.Og

professors look upon the development of that -spirit*
as an evil.and are deploring.it. .Thus Professor Story
is quoted as saying: "The eleemosynary system
seemed tp grow.. in .attraction for ingenious youth,

The entertainment of such views will strike Amer

based upon, a five-cent fare and ivalf rates for

$175,000- to 1200.000.

POWER FOR .RQAJX
The conversion of, the cat>le road .Into on
electric â¢ road and the utilization 'of. the cabie
conduit to receive the conducturs of .electricity
.Is* shown on plans subntined with rhe repoit.
â¢ The construction of the road westerly frarn
Fifth avenue Is somÂ«what-morÂ«v expe'nslve as a
conduit electric road than it wiÂ»u4d be" If tx
tendvd .ori' the overhead" trolley iyitem. The
underground conductors" '-are, .' however, recom
mended for this section* to unify, the sys'em.
The construction of rhls section on. .the over

about $85,000. 'â¢ '. ' . '

Upon oplratlon of the Geary-street fran
chise iÂ» November 0 of this " year the municl
.pality can, in all probability, enter into j>w
session und-make "use^of theÂ° road-beds now on
Geary street and on Point Lobos avenue. On
this assumption the proposed street railway
has been planned along the route directed by
ordinance. It Is proposed to convert thÂ« cabl'j
road into an electric railway with underground!
conductors of electricity frovn the easterly ter
mination of Geary street at 'Market to Fifth
avenue, and to extend the "same along Point
L.obos to" Tenth avenue, and t.Jj'ence -alon;j
Tenth avenue to the park &Â» a conduit elicCrlc
road of new construction. . , '
UNDERGROUND SYSTEM.
The route prescribed by ordinance Is alotirf
Tenth avenue and alone -Point hobos avenue
and Geary street to Market street.
Ordinance No. 7W leaves the BÂ£ard ot. Su
pervisors free to suggest buch type of road
and method", of operation *s is deemed bÂ«*:t
suited to fxlsllnff conditions. The gradients
on the .proposed line of rstil'read are such jis
to make cÂ«>erwUbn by electrically .transmitted
power possible.. The advantage of 'the electri
cal system of operation over: the cable system
is so well recognised tha^ In all new Installa
tions ol street railways, electricity it- at the
present daÂ£ given the preference over cable:.
Operatioc by this municipality of a street
railway on Geary street has aftewly received
some consideration and has been previously
reported upon under date of October 25, 1WA,
apd on MAyS. 1!K>2.- H la ifot necessary V J

The ninth -^was the flrstof the'sensa
tional rounds. Hanlon sent a right to the
Jsrw and. followed up his advantage. Yan
ger's head rockad from side to side and
tlie spectators scented' victory for the
Callfornian. Y.anger turned suddenly on
Hanlon and rained blows on him. It was
giye. and take until the gong sent them
to* their copners. *â¢
: YANOER "THE AGGRESSOR.
I While .Yan&er was' the aggressor*
throughout, trying all the -time, Hanlon
was always pressing forward at him '-as -
though driven' b.y 'some great power, and
never- giving way an Inch. The- pace '
throughout/was terrific but neither boxer ,
showed a'nj* marked aigns of weakness.' .
- YangeY was the- better boxer" and ring
general, timing, bis blows to a nicety, and
never ..making a mls.take as to distance."
He was the cooles^ man in the house sev
eral times when, the .Pavilion was in an
uproa.r. Oh ocCa.slon" he stood apd took
all the blows' "H.anlon had and then .turn
ed, on ' the r latter, suddenly and ,be"at him
ba-ck tor the ropes'. The weakest point In
Yanger'a defense was hjs inability 'in,
stop a a Jeft hook for the" head. . tfn ducked
away" from it several times, but it gen--,
erally Tound Its', mark.- Hanlbri did not.
try this blow as often as it was thought'"
he would. â¢ This is apparently the blow'
with whloh to stop Yanger.
-Yanper commenced- forcing matters
from the start, trying every trick and de-'
vice of the boxer to get inside Hanlori's
gnard. He had the best of the first
round, but near the end he received a
right on the ear that staggered him.
Yanger fairly lifted Hanlon off his feet
with a right to the body in the second
round. This started a slugging match
which was ended by the bell. /
Yanger continued to try for. an opening
in the third round, but with little success."
Ilanlon had the better of another slugg
ing match. Hanlon tried uppercuttlng in
the fourth but did no damage. Yanger
took a turn at uppercutting in the fifth.
Yanger showed to great advantage In the
sixth.' seventh and eighth. In the latter
round Hanlon claimed a foul which was
not allowed. - â*.
Hanlon assimilated an amount of. pun
ishment whith â¢ seemed â¢ incredible. His
left eye was badly cut ahd discolored
;from. 'the trip* hammer-like rfghts of
Yanger. Hanlon's body alsoÂ° showed j a
big red welt Just above the waist line.
While .Yanger's blosvs'beat onÂ°ftanlon'the
jatter. unmanked his battery, only 'at ln
lervals. Wher* heÂ° cleared for. action he
invariably fought â¢ Yanger to a stand-
Jstill. '
t"â^qDDIE JIANLOX, the little Cali-
fornlan boxer, fought the re
doubtable Benny Yanger a twen-
ty-round draw^ last night in Me
chanics' Pavilion. The fight was
replete with sensational features, being
one of the most stubbornly contested
ring battles ever seen here between mtn
of any weight.
Yanger outpointed Hanlon in the num-
; ber cf clean blows delivered, but when
the Californfan abandoned his peculiar
crouch and stood up and fought ho snared
the honors of the. occasion with the Chi
cago boy. Hanlon's marked improvement
! since his fight- with: Young Corbett "was
commented, on by, the -specta
Â¦ torsi He fought In more open "style and*
was much more effective when once in
: motion.
i After the flsht Yanger claimed he in
ijured his band during the contest and
.was .at a disadvantage with a boy. so
.strong and. so; aggressive Â«s Hanlon.* He c
;did not" seem .to. save the injured m'erri

A curious fact in connection with the
case- is that unless one of the men dies,
no punishment can be inflicted upon Filas.
There is nothmg. in the statutes relating
to thÂ« Government wards providing for
punishment In a case "of assault to mur

at h?iS o'clock, at which time everything
was safe on the premises. All tbe girl?
employed by him,- about forty, and -others

jlevelopments. The hearing was the re
sult of a petition made In April. 1302. by
Edmond R. Lyons to* be permitted to go
through bankruptcy. Lyons* petition
showed liabilities of $30,000 and no assets.
Two of Lyons' creditors. Littauer Broth
ers and Revillon Freres. objected to
Lyons* discharge in bankruptcy. Con
gressman Littauer is # the head of Litt
auer Brothers. These* two firms put in
the objection . that the bankrupt, with
fraudulent intent, had concealed or fail
ed to keep books of account and records
from whU-ft. his. true financial condition
might be. ascertained.
When Lyons was on the stand interest
ing testimony was brought out regardlns

said His contracts with the Government
trere'for Jiuckskln gauntlets, muskrat

Ia*t evening. L Society had contemplated
"Aiji pleasant a'.performance

m hive marked the close of a brilliant
theatrical season In the capital city. His

later, but his only appearance-was at the

especially in view of the fact. that, fol
lowing closely in the wake of the man
agement's, explanation, it was bruited
about that the actor had suddenly re
called an engagement at the Yanger-Han
lon fight in this city. The anger of 'the
Sacramentans, who had paid fancy prices
for "seats at the Clunie, and made extra
ordinary preparations for showing their
best clothes Jbefore the for a
time was beyond i bounds. That such
treatment was not to be tolerated with

the prevailing opinion* and protesting be

tion to the Board of Supervisors calling
its attention to the manner In which the
scavenger service is carried on in this
city. It reauests the board to take up
the matter and make a general reforma
tion. It suggests that a system similar
to that used in Berlin. Germany, be intro
duced. In that city, two tightly closed
metal receptacles, one for ashes and one
for garbage, are used. They are re
moved bodily every morning by the gar
bage collector and replaced by two similar
receptacles.

The de.ma.nd for choice fruit fot shipment
north on the Sound steamer was brisk and thn
market Â« was active durinj? the â¢ early morning
howrs. Cho'ice " shipping Peaches were very
scarce ahji prices ranged higher. Prices " of
Apricots were no- higher, there being enough
to : ge>. around. TherVwere very few Cherries
shipped, the northern States being' well sup
.plled with local stock. The receipts -of Cher
rle"? were Â¦ light, Â£ but Included a lot of poor and
soft stock irr bulk that had. to be disposed -'of.
quickly. Offerings of Plums and Prunes con
sisted chiefly of culls, which moved slowly.
Good stock -was in fair request, and . occasional
lots commanded a slight premfum ; .over -the
quptatlons, c -'Apples o were-.ln heavy- receipt and
dull, owing to fhe poor quality of -most ef the
receipts. .Peaches -In baskets were 'scarce and
ruled firm' at th* previously quqtetl rates, but
other fruits similarly paeked, were c ln free-sup
ply, and Â¦ rather easy. Apricots In b.ii-lk met
with a good demand from canners and cleaned
up readily. Figs were ' in abundant ' supply
and rosier. ' Melons and Grapes- moved off well
at. the previously quoted' rates. Another car
of WaKermelons cam* In from.Ooachella. Ber
ries x and ? Currants ' were" â¢ in free supply an.J
easy' for the general run of offerings. Prices;
however, had but little variation.
