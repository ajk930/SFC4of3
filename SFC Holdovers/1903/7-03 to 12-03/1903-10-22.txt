The wrecking of the Conetable de
Rlchemont was due to a peculiar mistake.
The rock on which she struck was mis
taken for, a- ship and the vessel, ap
proached it for the purpose of hailing and
requesting. provisions, of which the Con
etable de Rlchemont; was , very short. It
Is thought that the vessel can be saved
yet with the assistance of a tug.
The boat containing the boatswain and
seven of the crew separated from the one
containing Captain Raubt October 14 and
took a southerly direotion. It is thought
that the boat will reach Hawaii safely, as
the light reflected from the crater of
Mauna Loa will serve as a guide from afar.
The other missing boat, containing the
first mate and seven of the crew, drifted
off in a northerly direction, where It will
likely cross the path of the Oriental
steamers and be picked up. The French
Consul here -has requested the Federal
authorities to send out the United States
tug Iroquols in. search of the missing
boats.
HONOLULU, Oct. 2Lâ The French bark
Conetable de Rlchemont has been lost, on
French Frigate Shoals and sixteen of her
crew are missing. Captain Raubt with
the carpenter, cook and three seamen
reached Kaual on Sunday in a small
boat and arrived here this morning. Cap
tain Raubt reports that his ship struck
the shoals at 4 a. m. on October 10 in a
dead calm and had to be abanodned twen
ty-four hours later. Two boats with slx
teen men are missing, one In charge of
the first mate, who is the son of the cap
tain, with seven men, and the other con
taining the boatswain and seven men.
These two boats are without provisions
nnd a searching expedition may be or
ganized to look for the shipwrecked men.
The Conetable de Rlchemont was bound
from Hongkong to a South American
rort.

Laderman agreed to assist in the theft
of the Jewels on condition that there be
no killing. He secreted himself In the
garden of the woman's villa. When Fou
geres' maid came into the house she was
bound and gagged by Giriat, who then
treated Fougeres in the same manner.
After handing Laderman the Jewels Giriat
strangled Fougeres, whom she hated.
Then, in order to dispose of the witness to
the crime, she strangled the maid. Giriat
then asked Laderman to bind and gag her.
This he did before leaving the villa with
the Jewels.

At first the mysterious deaths were not
understood and all occurred , after the
eating of cabbage. Then a farmer In
"White County, In gathering cabbages,
discovered a worm about two inches long
and about the size of a needle. He says
that when he touched the cabbage the
worm on it shot out its tongue like
a snake and acted in every way like a
reptile. Becoming alarmed, he sent the
worm to the State Chemist, who reported
that it contained enough poison to kill
fifteen persons. Â£ i- , V ; v '
The worms are so small that It is hard
for housewives to find them when pre
paring cabbage for cooking, and many
have been cooked in this way. The cab
bage crop Is great in this section, but
the discovery of the poisonous worm has
made K a complete loss. Up to this time
no scheme has been devised for getting
rid of the worm, or reptile, that has been
the cause of so many deaths.
GAINESVILLE, Ga., Oct. 2L-<3reat loss
of life is reported in the counties of
Northeast Georgia, due to eating cabbage
saturated with poison by a strange worm.
During the past few weeks persons
coming here from White, Townes, Union,
Dawson,, Forsythe and other counties
6urrounding them have reported scores of
deaths from this cause.
Special Disi>atch to The Call
pendence cf Great Britain as a result of
the disappointment felt at the alleged be
trayal cf Canadian Interests in the Alas

over the West are denouncing the decis-
Jon in warra terms and most of them de
â¢ ellne to believe that Canada got anything
like a fair deal in thp judicial considera
tion of the questions submitted to the ar
bitration tribunal.
Mayor Thomas F. Neelands of Van
couver said to-day In a public statement:
'â¢While the present bitterness may not
. result in the annexation of Canada with
' t "the United States, it certainly seems to
rr.e -to- be paving tne way toward that, or
et least to Canadian independence of the
mother country. Independence would
probably be the best medium between the
extremes of the imperialist on the one
hnnd and the ar.nexatior.ist on the other."
Rev. Elliott S. Rowe, D. D., who, with
t}Tf? Chief Justice of Brttirfi Columbia, has
jusl been conducting a Government In
quiry into labor disputes, said this after
noon:
. -."I think the award was an outrage on
â¢ Carfaca. I am a strong Britisher and al
â¢ nays have been, but if the imperial au
. t^orities are going to give away the coun
try in smell sections as they have done in
this case, we might as well go over to
Ite United States in a body and be done
with it. We might then have some say
In the government of the country and the
â¢ disposal of its territory. _,'. : '.
_; "It looks to me very much as if we had
won the case and lost the territory. There
Is nothing, in my opinion, that could be
done that would more strongly favor the
annexation sentiment than this award.
There Is one result which the award
ehould produce. That is the immediate
construction of a line cf railway into the
Klondike through Canadian territory.
Whether this will consist of a spur to the
rorth cf the Grand Trunk Pacific or some
other line time alone will tell."
. The Dally Province, the largest after

of the lowering of the boats. The. first I
saw of him was when I saw him In the

short distance away. When we were in
the, davits there were five passengers In
our boat. Our boat turned over when we
struck the water, and when I came up
I cot into the boat again. The way the
boat happened to get loose from, the
steamer was by one rope which ran
through the tackle becoming loose on the
other davit I did not see any one with
a life preserver on. I went to get one for
a lady and could not find any."
PORTLAND, Or., Oct 21.â While enter-
Ing the harbor last night, about 9 o'clock,
the steamer Regulator ran into the
steamship Elba, which was moored at
the Oceanic docks. As a consequence tha.
Regulator Is laid up for repairs. The
railing on her starboard sjde was broken,
a bttt on the hurricane Ceck was crushed
Into ' kindling wood, her roof was badly
damaged and she sustained several other
minor Injuries.
! There were about sixty passengers on
the steamer and ..had any of them been
on deck they probably would have been
killed. >
A. heavy fog overhung the river last
night and the steamer got out of her
course. For an hour previous to the acci
dent she was creeping along at a snail's
pace, feeling her way. This Is one reason
that the collision did not result more
seriously. Had she been going at* her
ordinary pace her entire starboard side
would have been carried away, and
many of the passengers undoubtedly
would â¢ have been precipitated into the
river.'
The damages will amount to about $500.

y^LAMEDA, Oct 21.â Leslie F. Baker,
Â¦fT who "reached shore safely In the
*^^ boat with the captain and others
from the wrecked steamer, is the son of
Mr. and Mra. F. G. Baker of 1207 Grand
street, Alameda. He was on his way
home from the Northwest, where he had
spent three months with two companions
on horse ranges In Oregon, Washington
and British Columbia. Baker graduated
with the June class of this year from
the Alameda High School. While attends
ing that institution he was active In ath
letic affairs and was an expert baseball
and football player and bicycle rider. His
parents believe that the outdoor life he
lived while on the ranges well fitted him
to withstand the hardships that the sur
vivors of the lost vessel suffered.
Young Baker wrote to his mother from
Portland Saturday, informing her of his
Intention to leave Sunday morning by the

Jt TEW YORK, Oct. 21.â Known as the
-A/ Miller, . the Bteamer
X South Portland, just wrecked on
the Pacific Coast, was seized eleven years
ago by the Federal authorities in this
port on suspicion of being a filibuster.
She. was boarded on the strength of a
statement that the cargo she carried was
contrabrand, consisting of munitions . of
war for insurgents in Venezuela, ,headÂ«d
by Joaquin ' Crespo. The Minister from
Venezuela Insisted that Francisco Gbn
zalos, as' agent for Crespo, shipped the
war materials, but the Government had
to recede > from" its position, and in April,
1894, 'Â¦Â¦' a verdict of $600 was rendered
against the United States for Illegally
detaining the ship.
Captain John O'Brien, known as "Dy
namite." who achieved considerable fame
as a blockade runner In Cuban waters,
commanded the Miller.
SOUTH PORTLAND
ONCE WAS HELD
AS FILIBUSTER
Second Mate Ravens Is an intelligent
seaman and he told a plain, straightfor
ward and convincing story of the wreck
and the incidents before and after the
catastrophe. He said:
"We had an uneventful voyage, from
Portland up to the time we struck off
Cape Blanco, Monday morning the fog
was thick, but we proceeded on our way
at the usual rate of speed. Â»I was on the
bridge at 3 o'clock In the arterncon, when
I was relieved by the first mate. The
captain came on deck and took the log
book below. When he returned he told
A BEAVE MAFS STORY.
It was the keen eye of Captain J. C.
Eagles. In command of the Epokane, that
first discovered something on the ocean
a tnlle to the eastward that looked as if
It might be a raft containing men. This
â¢was twel\"e miles off shore and fifteen
miles b*low Cape Blanco. Earlier in the
morning he had passed a hatch and a
hoathook marked with the name of the
South Portland, and these gave him the
first, suspicion of disaster. From that
time on the officer on the bridge kept a
Fharp lookout for possible survivors, and
when the captain went on watch he al
most immediately descried the raft and
Its exhausted occupants.
Captain Eagles did everything in his
power for the stricken men who had
battled bo rallantly with death and won.
When the Spokane docked at 6:15 last
night at the Broadway wharf his
kindly care was ex'ldent m the appear
ance of the rescued mate and sailors,
who showed little traces of their terrible
experience.
When it had about gained the zenith
"one of the watchers made out about j a
mile to the westward the spars of some
craft. The four wretched castaways got
upon their feet and shouted "until their
voices failed them. The ship passed on
to the south and then was seen to stand
by. It was a moment of excruciating
agony and suspense to the shipwrecked
four en the raft. To the north the weary
ryes of Second Mate Ravens saw another
set of spars. With mute lips and staring
f>es, the four watched while a boat, with
R. D. McGillivery, the first officer of the
Bpokane, In the bow and four pair of
sturdy a'rms bending the oars, appeared
on thÂ« cre^t of the sea and headed In
their direction. It was only a few min
utes before the castaways, were aboard
the Spokane and were given dry clothing,
plenty to eat and drink and a warm, dry
berth In which to forget their harrowing
experience In the sleep of utter exhaus
tion.
CASTAWAYS SEE A SHIP.
Ttie long . night, . unlit by a single star
or ray of light, came to an end at last
and dawn broke. The caunt wayfarers
with death kept their haggard eyes
*tr%incd to the horizon, despairingly
searching for a flutter of" canvas . or a
puff of smoke to apprise them Â» that -on
thai broad expanse of restless water
there were ships ami men and succor^for
their roiserj'.- They had no ' means of
knowing their location nor how far they
might have drifted from the T beaten track
of ocean going commerce. .The sun showed
dimly through. the fog at first and then,
rising higher and dispelling the mi*t. beat
down upon the head of the menaced mari
ners, , increasing the tortures of their
thirst.
For nearly twenty hours the four sur
vivors buffeted the angry waves, their
comrades dropping off one by one, dying
of exposure and exhaustion and welcom
ing the" end of their : sufferings. All
through that long night the rough waters
snapped at their lives, catching and' pull-
Ing down into the green depths more than
hiilf-of-. the liUU band. -First to succumb
â¢was Abe H. Maddox, a waiter, who stood
only two hours of the buffeting, and died
with his cold fingers clasping the edge of
the hatch. His body was tossed over
board to lighten the raft .
Two hours later the messboy, Manuel
Rios by name, was discovered dead, and
his body was consigned to the waves.
Next one Â«f ' the passengers. Judged to
be .J; 6. -Lahey, gasped away his life
through the salt and spray washing over
him. Another passenger, who may have
been Paul Rainmuth, followed the beck
oning band of death. George Jackson,
the second cook, was the last to die. He
was .so weak at last that he could not
Bit upright on the raft and the four sur
vivors were too much exhausted to sup
port him longer. As each man died his
body m*as thrown to the waves In order
to lighten dhe burden of the raft. Dur
ing most xTf the night the survivors stood
in water up to their waists. As each
Â¦white face disappeared over the side the
craft, raised In the water and when
the nardv four were rescued they were
able to sit -on the raft without the water
covering ihieir- heads. â¢ .'
During all the hours of their helpless
drifting they had no . water. When they
reached to cast off the body of the dead
cook one fcf the sailors found In the pocket
of his' Jacket three apples. These were
divided as evenly as possible and
*agerjy> devoured : by the four famished
men. â¢ ...Â¦'â¢â¢ 'â¢ â¢

a nd â¢ cast '- loose from "Â« the rapidly shaking
snip. ,
In answer to a question concerning Cap
tain Mclntyre, Ravens refused to be
drawn into a discussion regarding his
superior officer. He would say nothing
further than that Mclntyre left his ship
before the passengers or crew were pro
vided for and rowed away Into the fog.
Ravens was the last man to leave the
doomed vessel and he thinks that about
an hour elapsed between the time the ship
struck and the moment when the last raft
was cut adrift.
The three seamen rescued with Ravens
told the wune story as the mate. They
were very happy- at being saved after
having: lost all hope. They said that none
of them could have survived the waves
and exposure for more than a few hours
longer.
"When morning broke the fog Ufted
6lowly and we kept a sharp lookout Short
ly before noon we saw the spars of two
ships to the west. We shouted until our
voices gave out and then we saw first one
and then the other stand by. We ascer
tained afterward that they were tfie
James Dollar and the .Spofcane. After a
Itfng wait as it seemed to us, we saw a
boat coming toward us and maybe you
think we weren't glad. We were able to
walk up the ladder of the Spokane with
out assistance. Captain Eagles treated
us the best he could and gave us every
thing we needed."
'Time and again the raft capsized and
turned over on us. but we four mannged
to retrain our frail hold on It each time.
I think the raft turned turtle at least
twenty times during the night. There
was not a heavy sea running or wÂ« should
all have been wasned away.
"The fog was so dense that we could
see nothing ab^ut us and night came down
on a hopeless band. There were no rock
ets nor guns on board of the South Port
land with! which we could notify those
on ehore, or on passing craf f, of our dan
gerous situation and we had little expec
tation of being picked up In the darkness.
One of the waiters died from exposure
after we had been afloat about two hours.
Soon after another on the raft succumbed.
Before morning five had gone overboard,
dead, there being no attempt made to
keep their bodies because the raft was
terribly overweighted.
HELP COMES AT LAST.
"When we first launched the raft the
carpenter, steward and a seaman were
thrown Into the eea by Its capsizing. I
threw them a bench and a hatch and the
carpenter and steward were still floating
when we drifted away. We were caught
In the fog and soon lost sight of the ship
and the other raft. I think the vessel
must have gone down soon after we left
her. as she was filling fest. We left no
body on board.
"The first mate took command and gave
orders to start the engines, hoping to be
able to beach the ship, which was sinking
fast. I measured the water* In the bilge
and found four feet right after the crash.
We tried for fifteen minutes ' to j get the
ship under way. but were unsuccessful.
The first mate started to launch the life
raft while I got what assistance I could
from the crew and passengers to con
struct a raft to hold those who would be
unable to embark on the life raft. We
tore down two strong-backs and nailed
hatches across these, I had intended to
nail hatches on both sides of the strong
backs, which would have made a much
more seaworthy raft, but the -first mate
-called to me from the water, where he
was to hurry and. embark as the ship
was about to ! sink.
me we were off Umpflua River. "When I
went below I -made my own reckonings
and determined we were between Umpqua
River and Cape Blanco.
"I was in my berth asleep when I felt
a Jar. It did not feel as if we had struck,
but more as If the engines had stopped
suddenly. I Jumped to my feet and looked
at my watch. It was 4:25. I got on deck
as quickly as I could and met the first
mate on the bridge. He told me we were
on a reof. The captain came on deck
and ordered the lifeboats manned. I took
charge of lowering the starboard boat
and the captain took the port boat.
There was absolutely no excitement or
disorder among the crew or oassengers.
"Four people piled Into the boat I was
launching and it capsized, throwing them
Into the water. All of them were drowned.
One of tlfe davit ropes t>roke and thÂ«
boat drifted away. The captain got into
the port boat with about twelve of the
crew and some passengers. This also
capsized, but they succeeded in" righting
it and seven of the occupants, Including
the captain, regained their places. The
captain and those in the boat rowed away
from the ship, leaving us all behind.
TBTES, TO 6AVB SHIP.
draught was- thirteen feet forward and
sixteen and a half feet aft. This is a foot
less than she drew on the last outbound
trjp. I inspected the vessel and her cargo
was carefully stowed. There was not the
least bit of a list either to' starboard or
port, and the cargo could not possibly
have shifted so that the vessel was down
at the bow when she sank."
Brown & McCabe, the stevedoring firm
which loaded the South Portland, are em
phatic In declaring that the cargo was
properly- stowed and could not possibly
have shifted unless the vessel got into
hard collision with some other craft.
"The story that she was overloaded is
foolish," said McCabe. The Lloyd rating
of the yessel at" 585 tons net carrying ca
pacity Is, according to all who know the
ship, an error.
- "The lost vessel was a big carrier and
had a capacity almost equal to that of
the Columbia of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation fleet," said j i one prominent
stevedore,, and he added that the South
Portland seldom left this port with less
than 1200 tons of cargo. All of the cargo
carried by the steamer was shipped from
thrs port and the aggregate tonnage was
1026.â Of this, 500 tons were wheat, 150 tons
oats and 386 .- tons barley. This was the
lightest cargo the South Portland has
earned for a long time. On the trip prior
tffthe "'one when she went on the rocks
the vessel had a cargo j of 1120 tons.

expected to be pitched on the rocks. Just
at the" break of day we saw two islands
and we felt confident that the shore was
not. far Â«way. Had It"' not 'been for the
captain and chief! officer not one of us
would have been saved, as they were cool
and deliberate throughout it .all.."
The tug Columbia has returned t here
after being outside' thirty-six hours in a
thick fog and rough sea, searching for
the life raft from the steamer South Port
land. Captain James Magee said that he
had all he could do to look after hi3 own
vessel In this weather among the rocks
where the South Portland sank. The life
saving crew is outside at Cape Arago, but
unable to reach \ the wreck in the foggy
weather. The telephone line went down
to Port Orford,- cutting off communication
with that point at 4:50 this afternoon.
Communication will probably be opened in
the morning.

HYDE DENIES FRAUD.
I PORTLAND, Oct. 21. â Uncle Sam is
digging up a stupendous lieu land graft
on the Pacific Coast. He has already
delved far enough to convince him that
a lieu land ring has been carrying on a
flagrant business in every well timbered
area on the Pacific slope. This ring has
not only acquired "base" lands by "dum
mies," but it has- debauched State land
officials, making therm partners in the
business; it has maintained in the Gen
eral Land Office at Washington agents
v/hose duty was . to "leak" information
about proposed reserves; it has cast its
spell over field officers of the General
Land Office who mapped out boundaries
of proposed reserves and has Induced
these officers, by the glitter of gold, to
conform those boundaries to its own in
terests. Â¦
The central figures of this colossal con
spiracy are alleged to be F. A. Hyde &
Co. of San Francisco, brokers and deal
ers in; real estate and lieu land scrip.
The company consists of F. A. Hyde, re
puted to be the author of the lieu land
law, and John A. ' Benson,' who was in
volved many years ago in the notoriously
fraudulent Benson , surveys of California.
One day last week W. J. Burns, a Secret
Service agent and A. B. Pugh, Assistant
Attorney General in the Treasury Depart
ment at Washington, arrived at the Hotel
Portland. The -mission of . the visitors
was to secure from person's in Portland,
who have Innocently or. knowingly been
agents of the ring, evidence that will
help the Government In prosecuting the
Instigators of the conspiracy. The j
strangers interviewed a number of men !
who had been paid for the "use of their,
names in applications for $tate school
land; also notaries public who are ac
cused of certifying to fraudulent affida
vits. Men who had applied for school
land in 1898 and had sold their rights for
$5 were- called before the. visitors. They
had sold, they said, to somebody who had
uold to another somebody. But ultimately
it . transpired that the last "somebody" in
each case was one J.H. Schneider. This
man for many years was employed by
Hyde & Co. as agent. Only last year he
quit the" firm, and. forth with he began to
divulge secrets within the hearing of un
corrupted Federal officials. Thousands
of acres of school land,- it is alleged,
were thus acquired by Hyde, & Co.
The : lands went Into forest reserves.
They v were bought for that purpose.: The
reserves were "c-cated for that , purpose.
The conspirators 'k knew where ' they
wanted reserves. Reserves in Oregon and
California were proposed at their Instiga
tion, laid *off acording to their desires
and created to their satisfaction. Then
they trooped Into the local Land - Office
Agents Examine Men Who Were
Paid for Services.
INQUIRY AT PORTLAND.
The claims in question had been sus
pended by the Department of the In
terior because it was alleged certain
agreements had been made by the locator
prior to filing to sell to Charles Cun
ningham and other sheep and cattle
ranchers In that country. v-Jh?'CF-
It was . alleged toy the agents of the
Interior Department that the claims were
located for no other purpose than to se
cure patents and to sell to the "sheep
king", of Oregon, as Cunningham is
otlled. .
For many years allegations have been
made that big ranchers in the We3t
have been accustomed to , have their
herders file on homesteads, and. after
paying expenses and $200 profit to the
filer, buy the claim to add to their range.
The charge was made against Thomp
son, that he made propositions to persons
who had filed on public lands, and whose
claims had been held up. that he would
assure the safe conduct of their cases
through the tortuous channels of the
United States land offices to a patent for
$50 a quarter section.
. PORTLAND, Oct. 21.â Asa B. Thomp
son, Receiver of the United States Land
Ofllce at La Grande, is said to have been

manding money from locators to insure
their cases being carried through.

with their "dummies." They took what
lands they : wanted and persons outside
the ring came "too late."
A common plan of operation on the part
of speculators is to buy State lands In
closed-ln areas, which are liable to be
come parts of fprest reserves. These, it
is said, they often secure for one or two
dollars an acre, whereas, when' the res
ervations are created, the value is in
creased to $5 or $6 per acre. Governor
Chamberlain of Oregon is now in "Wash
ington conferring with -the Secretary of
the Interior concerning these land trans
fers. He claims that the State has lost
a considerable sum - in this way and is
endeavoring to secure 'a settlement which
will reimburse .the State." Secretary
Hitchcock declines to discuss the case,
but says that he will make a statement
later. j Â¦ t 0
The methods of the speculators are va
ried, but the most common proceeding-Is
to secure patented lands within forest
reservations and then exchange them for
more valuable lands on the outside. Per
sons living on the western slope have
charged that some forest reservations
have been created with this end in view,
the land holders within them being re
sponsible for â¢ creating the sentiment
which led to their establishment This
charge is among those now being inves
tlcated. .
Many entries of land under the timber
and e tone act are regarded with suspi
cion, the officials believing that the entry
men have taken the lands for speculative
purposes rather than for "their own use
and benefit," as the law requires. It is
generally believed that many thousands
of acres of the public domain have thus
fallen into the hands of speculators and
charges of conspiracy are freely made,
yet, so far no, definite effort at prosecu
tion has been^undertaken.
A great numoer of land entries in all
three of the coast States have been held
up for Investigation, but so . far no test
case has been brought.
WASHINGTON, Oct 21.â Only, general
confirmation can be secured here of the
report of extensive fraudulent practices in
securing public lands on the Pacific
Coast. ThÂ© Department of tha Interior
officials have been convinced for over, a
year that there were various combinations
of speculators seeking control of the pub

Morgan.
NE"W YORK, Oct a.â Lewis Nixon,
who fronx a naval constructor became a
builder of warships and the president of
thÂ« United State* Shipbuilding Company,
was the principal witness to-day at the
continuation of the hearing before Ex
aminer Henry D. Oliphant as to the af
fairs cf the defunct corporation named.
He did not finish his recital, but in the
Â¦ three hours that he was on the stand
he went over much of the history of the
corporation and the acts of the men prom
inent in its history. He confirmed the
claim cf the bondholders that Max Pam,
counsel for Charles M. Schwab, had sug
gested a number cf directors for the com
bination, and said that the proposed ex
penditure of $2,802,000 for improvements at
the Bethlehem Steel Works had been ap
proved by the directors over his protest
and the warning that the action might
in the end leave the corporation without
funds and wreck It.
â¢ Nixon gwore that, after this, expendi
ture was approved, he made several at
tempts to brine about a meeting of thÂ©
directors and that Schwab had finally
told him that he had instructed the direc
tors to remain away from a meeting.
â¢ An Â«ffnrt was made to show that the
directors elected at the suggestion of Pam
had not been stockholders, but, like the
yourxg men of the Corporation Trust Com
paxy of New Jersey, who served in the
early days of the combination, had been
given shares enough to qualify, but Nixon
had no personal knowledge of the trans
action.
Nixon testiSed that, by resolution of the
directors passed in December last, Pam
was giv^en a salary of $1S.OOO a year,
which was dated back to the preceding
September. He also testiSed that, be-
Fldes his bonus as an underwriter and
the rums paid for the Bethlehem prop
erty, Schwab received a share of the pro
motion ir.oney_ part of which he gave to
Charles Gates' of the brokerage firm of
Harris. Gates & Co.
Samuel Untermeyer, for the bondhold
ers, endeavored to prove by the witness
that during the negotiations for the pur
chase of the constituent plants no one
looked after the interests of the ship
building companies, but that the unsup
ported figures and reports of John W.
Young, the promoter, were accepted.
Nixon taid that no Independent ap
praisement or investigation had been
made and they disclaimed all responsi
bility for the negotiations and financial
rart of the combination plan.
FALSE PROPECTUS ISSUED.
It was broupht out In tho testimony of
Nixon that misleading statements as to
the personnel of the directorate had been
made in the prospectus iseufd in July,
UX8, and that Young: had taken the op
tions in his name. According to Nixon,
FfrTccy was observed In payfrg the vend
ors only because Promoter Young did not
want them to know what was being paid
for each plant. There has been much
mystery over the cutting of the checks
piven to the vendors and It is possible
that the explanation of Nixon will clear
it away.
Charles Canda was the only other wit
ness of the day. taking the Ftand before
Nixon was called. He testified that the
Canda Manufacturing^ Company, for
which $1,100,000 in cash and securities was
paid, had a plant at Cartaret, N. J., built
for the manufacture of carwheels, but
that at the time of Its purchase it was
turning out some experimental work In
motor carriages. He said that the plant
would have been useful in connection with
Fome of the operations of the shipbuild
ing combination. â¢ *

The original check was produced by
Guthrie and, after identification by the
witness and a wrangle between counsel,
was offered In evidence. The check was
for $7,131,791 48, and was drawn in favor
of D. Leroy Dresser and Lewis Nixon by
C. M. Schwab, by his attorney, Oliver
Wren.
KOBE PBOFITS FOB "*SCHWAB.
The witness could not explain why,
while the agreement called for $7,246,000,
the check was for $7,191,791 43. Untermeyer
asked if there was any one at the meet
ing at the office of J. P. Morgan & Co. to
protect the Interests of the shipbuilding
company, and the witness said he and
Dresser were there -representing the com
pany. The witness said he had read the ;
agreement and seen the stock. He did not
examine the stock and understood it was
later taken to one of the trust companies i
Nixon testified that Schwab had said
that he wanted some of the promotion
profits. If there were any, in order that
he might give somo of them to Gates of
Harris, Gates & Co. Schwab said that
those who Tiad aided in the underwriting
Ehould have some of the promotion profits
The witness said he talked this over with
Young, who said he would arrange to
give Schwab $100,000 in bonds and either
$100,000 or $300,000 in stock. This commit
ment must have been in addition to the
stock bonus which Schwab received as an
underwriter. The witnees took to Schwab
a paper on the subject. His recollection
was that Gates was to get $50,000 in bonds
from Schwab.
"I did not have the check long enough
to see who signed it," said Nixon. "I do
not even know who received the check."
Nixon could not remember -where he had
signed an agreement with J. P. Morgan
& Co. for the sale in cash of the Bethle
hem Company. He had signed many pa
pers at Dresser's office. The agreement
had never been explained to him, and he
could not understand why he had been a
party to It. The witness said he had act
ed to the best interests of the shipbuild
ing company, and with no idea of any
gain for himself. He could not explain
why, after the agreement to purchase
Bethlehem from Schwab for $10,000,000 in
bonds, $10,000,000 In preferred stock and
$10,000,000 in common stock had been made,
an agreement was made with Morgan &
Co. to buy the plant for $7,200,000 in cash
and $5,000,000 in stock. Nixon told of the
passage of the check for $7,200,000 at the
office of Morgan & Co. .. :.*.<,r
Nothing was said as to why Morgan &
Co. were to receive the stock. Dresser
said he was willing to pay the price.
"When we saw Mr. Schwab again," con
tinued Nixon, "he Â«aid -we would have to
give him. $10,000,000 of each kind of stock,
besides the bonds. Schwab said he had
to give $2,500,000 of each kind of stock to
J. P. Morgan & Co." Vj:,;
Mr. Untermeyer wanted to know if
Schwab had represented that the Bethle
hem plant had earned $1,400,000 after pay
ing the interest on mortgages. The ques
tion was objected to by Guthrie. The
witness said he understood the 'sum men
tioned to have been net earnings. Schwab
told the witness that he had paid $7.
400,000 for the plant. This sum. with the
earnings which had not been taken from
the business, amounted to $9,000,000, the
sum for which Schwab said he would sell.
Dresser said $9,000,000 was a large sum
to raise at that time. The question of
securities then came up, and Schwab
agreed to take $10,000,000 in bonds at W. Â¦
j The robbery of the Parker Jewels
caused a profound sensation. Mrs. Par
ker probably has one of the finest collec
tions of Jewels in the Territory and or
dinarily keeps them in her vault at the
First National Bank, On the night of
August 1 she and her husband gave a din
ner to a party of friends at the Alexander
Young Hotel, which was formally opened
on that night. On returning to her home
Mrs. â¢ Parker put the Jewelry she had
worn, valued at $50,000, in her Jewel case.
The next afternoon she went to her moun
tain residence on Mount Tantalus and
did not open the Jewel case until her ar
rival there. Not all of the Jewels had
been stolen and It was at first thought
that the missing Jewels bad been inad
vertently mislaid, but after J a thorough
search the conclusion' was reached that
the jewel* had been stolen and the mat
ter was reported to the police. Detectives

bination, and through him. thÂ© witness
met J. W. Young. The witness said the
first plan of consolidation was handled
by H. "W. Poor & Co., but was brought
out/on a bad day and failed. The wit
ness said he knew C. M. Schwab, who
told of hla purchase' of the Bethlehem
Company. The first direct proposal that
the Bethlehem Company be purchased by
thc^United States Shipbuilding Company
was made in June, 1902. The witness then
told of the meeting at the Lawyers' Club
In June. 1902, already detaileaTby E>. Le

HONOLULU. Oct. 2Lâ After nearly
three months of detective work the thief,
who on tho night of August 1 atola $11,

Parker has been Identified in the person
of Benjamin Gallagher, a coachman m
the employ of the Parkers.- All of the
stolen Jewels eave onÂ« have beeÂ© . recov
ered. The missing gem is a blue diamond
valued at $4500, and is believed to have
been sent to the -Padflo -Coast to be sold.
Owing to the fact that Gallagher was an

had always borne a good reputation the

heretofore held a high In the estima

with whom it has come in contact officially or
otherwise: and now that it is. brought .into
closer relationship . to the regular army by
reason of recent legislation/ and will undoubt
edly be associated more closely in fleidNand
.eamp and subjected to more rigid I Inspections
by its officers. It Is Imuortant that the atten
tion of officers and men of the guard he direct
ed to the defects that have manifested â¢ them
selves, to the end that they may be remedied-
Let every officer and man do his utmost to
maintain and Increase the efficiency of the or

Guard of - California will not fear Â¦ comparison
with any military organization In field or camp;
but will be prepared for the ready and success

11. At Â«acÂ»> headquarters and armory com
plete sets of all orders must be kept, each in
Its . own series. Orders are not issued to be
glanced over and tossed aside, but to be
obeyed and preserved for reference. The atten

near future for the purpose of discussing mat

that needed improvements be made and all or

10. The paper work Is an essential part of
the proper administration of a command. Igno
rance or neglect of Its details on the part of
officers often works hardships upon the en
listed men. For Instance, many men have been
deprived of their well-earned opportunity 'of
competing for prizes at target practice simply
on account of t*e Inability of obtaining the
official records of their high standing. Officers

military body. In all walks of life there is
and of necessity must be a higher authority,
and that higher authority must be treateJ
with respect. This is true of civil pursuits,
and is particularly applicable to- the military
profession. An officer and the office he fills
ehould be shown that deference and respect
which are required by military laws and cus
toms the world over. There Is no loss of self
respect In observing the rules of military de

indicates ttot only a proper respect for them
and for one's superiors, but a healthy respect
for one's self.

pline Is indifferently maintained; that the
proper relations between officers; and enlisted
men when on duty is not observed; that field
officers do not devote the necessary, time and
attention to those under their command; that
regimental and brigade commanders do not
exercise due supervision over the theoretical
and practical instruction of their commands;
that . the requisite care and attention to neoea
sary details Is not displayed in keeping rec
ords nor in rendering reports and returns; that
staff and department officers are not In touch
with the details of thalr departments and are
inattentive to the few duties they are called
upon to perform. In short, there seems to be a
general laxity pervading the guard which it
detrimental' to its efficiency and will retard IU
Improvement unless Immediately checked.

Teacher Is Accused of Cruelty.
FRESNO. Oct. 21.â Marion D. Holmes,
principal of the Lowell School in this city,
was arrested to-day on a charge of cruel
ly beating the 10-year-old son of C. D.
Olmstead, a plasterer. The boy was sent
by his teacher yesterday to Holmes for
punishment, and the principal. It Is said,
laid him on a sofa and whipped him with
a "cat o" nine tails." It is alleged that
he cut the boy's side till the blood flowed,
and a physician had afterward to be call
ed in to dress the wounds. A great deal
of indignation has been expressed over
the affair.
Bancher Mysteriously Disappears.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 21. â F. E. David, a
rancher at Morgan Hill, has mysteriously
disappeared from his home at that place.
He had just finished caring his fruit and
the hard work is believed to have affected
his mind. No other theory can be ad
vanced for his disappearance.
NEW YORK Oct. 21.â Peace has been
declared between the Democrats of Brook
lyn and the Democratic organization of
New York over the question, of candidates
for Comptroller and President of the
Board of Aldermen.
Whether the result was brought about
by the surrender of Hugh McLaughlin to
McCarren and Murphy, or through con
cessions from Tammany in promises of
patronage is not known, but whatever the
baSis of(the agreement may be, McLaugh
lin and his campaign committee will work
in harmony with the Tammany commit
tee. The only discordant note was sound
ed by Martin W. Littleton, candidate for
Borough President, who Insists on main
taining the attitude taken by him a week
ago, when he declared against the nomi
nations of Grout and Fornes.
McLaiighlln's, x decision closes probably
the most exciting phase of "the present
campaign for municipal offices In .this
city. When Charles F. Murphy, leader of
Tammany Hall, let it be known that It
was his intention to indorse Grout and
Fornes for the offices held by them under,
the Low administration, Hugh McLaugh
lin declared that he would not support
men who had lent their aid to the fusion
movement two years ago, and at the city
Democratic convention there was a dra
matic scene when the 'spokesmen for the
aged Brooklyn leader made their protest
against Murphy's programme. Tammany
had a majority of the votes, however, and
the Brooklyn objections were not heeded.
Both Grout and Fornes were dropped by
the fuslonists after the Democratic con
vention and now they are on only the
Democratic ticket. â¢. .'Â¦Â» " â¢. r'-.-' .;

WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â The State De
partment officials are disposed to ( attach
little credence to the reports that come
from the Far East of a purpose on the
part of Russia to defeat the operation
of the new treaty .between the United
States and China, so far as it relates to
the opening of ports in Manchuria to our
commerce. It is pointed out that the re
ports are particularly inspired by a de
sire to cause friction between the United
States and Russia. As an act of cour
tesy and in view of Russia's considerable
Manchurlan interests, a draft of ; this
treaty, before signature, was unofficially
submitted to the Russian agents in China
and by them communicated to the Rus
sian Foreign Office. Through entirely re
liable channels the United States was as
sured that the treaty was not objection
able to Russia. -. .
The full text of article XII of the com
mercial treaty between the United States
and China referred to In the dispatch from
St. Petersburg- follows:
Â¦ The Chinese Government having. In 1800,
opened the navigable inland waters of the
empire to commerce and .. all Â¦ steam â
native or foreign â that" may t>e registered for
the purpose of conveyance of passengers and
lawful merchandise, it is now agreed by the
Chinese Government that: such commerce is
open to the vessels of every type belonging to
the .cltUens, firms and corporations of the
United States, and that : they may . freely en
gage In it on equal terms. with those granted
to the subject* of China or any power having

ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 21.â The Novy
krai of Port Arthur, commenting on the
commercial treaty between the United
Btates and China, declares that article
XII (opening ports in Manchuria to United
States trade) strikes at the very heart
of Russian interests in Manchuria, and
says it is convinced the- treaty will be
ratified only after material modification,
as it affects part of the 1 territory which,
by virtue of- existing relations, is not
free so long as Russia 'has not definitely
come to an understanding with China re
garding her rights. ' \
"Moreover," the Novykrai adds, "prior
to her present* occupation Russia had
special treaty relations with China re
garding this territory, giving her the right
to build railways and guaranteeing ', that
no similar privileges would be granted to
others."

LONDON, Oct. 21.â A report was in cir
culation on the Stock Exchange to-day
that the negotiations between Russia anfl
Japan had been broken off, but the For
eign Office officials said they had not
heard anything confirmatory of the ru
mor. This statement was made subse
quent to the visit paid by Baron Hayashi
to the Foreign Minister, Lansdowne, this
afternoon. The officials of the Foreign
Office added that the report " was con
trary to the general trend of its informa
tion.
A dispatch to Reuter's "Telegraph Com
pany from Tokio says : ' Â¦
"Russian military activity on the Ko
rean frontiers is unabated. The import
ant newspapers take a gloomy view. They
are Inclined to believe Russia does not In
tend to fulfill her repeated promises and
declarations, in which case it will be in
cumbent upon Japan to take decisive
steps for the sake of her very existence.

the Indian "cuss words and whisky and

owed the Indian something more than
those things for what he had taken from
him. The speaker appealed to his hear

owed the Indian a debt of the past.

a formidable list of no. less than seven
teen divorces. It would not be well for
thÂ« Indian, he said, to read such a record
because he delights In copying the white

Mrs. Bernard Tobey, residing at Ashby
"station, Berkeley, has reported to her
husband, and he to the police to-day, that
Fhe was ttood up at Ashby station Sun
day evening by a man with a pistol, who
compelled her to yield $60 in gold that was
hidden in one of her stockings.
Mrs. Tobey, according to her husband's
repetition of his spouse's narrative, had
been followed from the local train by
this bold robber at 8 o'clock in the even
ing, and he had demanded her money.
The woman denied that ehe had any. but
the insistent footpad declared that he
knew she had, for he had seen her hide
the ro!n In her stocking while she was on
the train.
Still refusing to yield. Mrs. Tobey saw
herself suddenly made the aiming target
for a pistol, followed by a threat to kill
her unless ehe should surrender the hid
den gold. Upon that the woman gave up
the three $20 pieces that comprised the
hoard. Â¦>:;;Â¦
Tobey explained that he lived at Crock
ett, that Mrs. Totx>y had gone there Sun
day to visit him, and at that time he had
friven Jier the money ehe claims to have
l<st on her return to Berkeley. The wife
subsequently wrote to her husband, who
:<>-day went to the Oakland police to ask
Cor an investigation. The woman said
:-he thought the robber had followed her
from Crockett Sunday afternoon and had
v.atched her on the train when she con
â¢" aled the money.
A squad of Inspectors from the Health
Department invaded Madison Square
Garden to-day and ordered sweeping
changes in the methods of quartering the
Zlon guards and a part of the "host" of
4000 there. An order was posted that only
a certain number of persons could sleep
.in each room, and that there must be
better .ventilation. The Inspectors also
visited the kitchens and watched the
preparation of the meals. The fact that
forty-three members of 'Dowie's follow
ers whom ho brought here were sick to
day led the Health Department to take
action, bo Commissioner Lederle said.
GILFORD, N.H., Oct. 21.â Mrs. Angeline
Jewett, a convert to the doctrine of John
Alexander Dowie. has sold her farm here
for $1500 and of the proceeds has sent $1400
to Dowie. Mrs. Jewett declares she be
lieves in Dowie and declared "God showed
me that it was best to dispose, of this
farm and send him the money."
"Just to show that I am in favor with
the Christian merchant princes of this
city," said Dowie,, "1 will announce the
money wliich has come to me this morn
ing alone. These sums are from men un
known to me, but who evidently believe
I am right. One sends me a check for
$5000. another a check for $1000, another
for $1500 and another gave me $200. These
contributions were unsolicited. They
were accompanied by the kindest words."
For the first time to-day Dowie ordered
reporters excluded and those who were
seated at the reporters' table were es
corted to the door- on Dowie's orders to
his guards to "clear the tainted vipers
out of here. Be careful how you handle
them, not to get any of their filth on
you. Now get out, you mean dogs, you
yellow scoundrels of -the press. We 'will
have no more of you here. I am paying
for this place, you liars. This is my
building. Hurry up, guards. The sight
of them disgusts me. Don't waste any
restoration talk on the liars. It is useless.
They have sold their souls to the, devil.
I never hope to convert a reporter. .They
would be backsliders."
William A, Brady, the theatrical man*,
ager and husband of Grace George; Lo
renzo Winter, a broker, and Channing
Pollock, a. press agent, were arrested, on
charges of disorderly conduct.
Dowie called for special prayers at the
early meeting J in Madisdn . Square > Gar
den to-day fbr those of his follow
ing who are ill. At least forty-three
are said to be unable to leave their
boarding-houses on account of sick
ness. The conditions in the garden have
been called to the attention of the Board
of Health, and officers paid an official
visit to Dowie's "army" to-day and will
do all possible to preserve sanitary con
ditions in these quarters.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â Thirty-one thou
sand persons, according to the estimates
of the police, tried to get into Madison-
Square Garden to see John Alexander
Dowie 'to-night. Â¦Â¦' About one-third that
number had obtained admittance when
at 8 o'clock the doors were closed. When
the ottfer 20,000 found themselves shut out
the "wildest disorder prevailed and the po
lice, 400 strong, were for a time utterly
unable to cope with the mad rush of the
crowd. Men and women were knocked
down and trampled upon and many nar
rowly escaped death in the,crush.
Several times Inspector Walsh sent In
calls for extra reserves and it was not un
til the meeting was suddenly terminated
by Dowie, shortly after 9 o'clock, that
anything could.be done with the crowd.
In the surging of <he throng Grace
George, the actress, who was on her -way
to a theater where she was playing, was
swept off her feet and trampled upon and
her clothing was badly torn. 8he accused
the police of having handled her roughly.
Mrs. William J. Buckley of Newark, N.
J., was caught in the crush and fell faint
ing to the street. She was badly bruised.
Inspector . Walsh was near the woman
when she fell and. with the aid of fifteen
policemen, he rescued and carried her to
safety.
When Venter disappeared for a day
Mrs. Miller that was admitted the exist
ence of the license, but said she had not
wedded Venter because he was subject to
nervous attacks. . :Â» ;; â¢. â¢
After numerous vicissitudes that Indi
cate the truth of the familiar adage about
the course of true love, Mrs. Laura Etta
Miller has become the wife of John C.
Venter, the peculiar point of interest in
connection with the matter being the fact
that a marriage Jlcenae Issued January
9, 1903, nearly two years ago, was brought
into service. The long delayed wedding
was solemnized last Thursday by the
Rev. E. R. Dille. Mr. and Mrs. Venter
will continue to reside at 5867 Marshall
street, Golden Gate, Mrs. Venter's home
for several years.
Announcement that the couple have
been made man and wife recalls the mys
terious disappearance a month ago of
Venter from the then Miller residence,
where he had long been a boarder, the
strange letters that *he sent to friends,
Mrs. Miller's fears of suicide or foul play
and the pricking of a mystery by Ven
ter's sudden reappearance. At that time
the story came to light of the marriage
lloense, which had been Issued so long
before and never used. On top of that
was the voluntary statement to-day that
three days after the authorization was
Issued the then Mrs. Miller had torn the
document Into pieces. But she had care
fully preserved the fragments, for the
same license was used at the wedding,
the pieces having been carefully pasted
and the document made whole again.
Venter is an employe of Wells. Fargo *
Co.'s express, having served that corpo
ration for twenty-nve years. At the res
idence to-night the couple had explana
tions to make, which run as follows:
"We have been lawfully married and
the license issued to Mr. Venter In Jan
uary. 1902, was used. It was a legal paper
and the fact that It was of such a date
cuts no figure, Mrs. Venter does not care
to go Into details as to the reasons why
the license was not used at the time it
was Issued. She also says she has not
denied the marriage, but has refused to
affirm It until ehe was given an oppor
tunity to consult with Mr. Venter."

The imbrcglio over this "rummage
sale" threatens to be the death of other
"rummage sales." Dr. C. F. Gladding, a
member of the Health Board, Inspected
the merchandise at the Trinity ladies'
sale yesterday at the request of people
of West Berkeley and declared it unfit for
use. The ladles retorted that they had
the approval of Dr. F. W. Paine to sell
the goods. But Dr. Gladding still says
it's unhealthy and to prevent others be
ing held in West Berkeley he proposes to
have the Trustees pass a prohibitive ordi
nance against all "rummage sales:"
"Sam" Fisher, the West Berkeley sa
loonkeeper who wrecked u. "rummage
sale," swore at the ladies of the Trinity
Methodist Church and tried to knock out
two of their male escorts Monday night
near his saloon, was arrested this morn
ing by Deputy Marshal Carey on a war
rant charging him with disturbing tne
peace. The constable took Fisher before
Justice Edgar, who laid him under a bail
of $200 and set his trial for November 10.
Fisher begged for delay, as he Intended to
visit his sister In thÂ« East and had al
ready purchased the tickets for the trip,
so Justice Edgar put the trial off for
three weeks.
Fisher .was not the roaring bull of
Bashan in the courtroom tha.t he was the
night he attacked the men and women of
Trinity Church. He was at once penitent
and defiant, accusing and ~elf-accuslngi
In one breath he spoke of his Borrowâ in
another he was ready to prove that he
was more sinned against than sinning.
"I am not a fighting man," eaid Fisher,
â¢'and I didn't mean to abuse anybody. I
didn't know what I was doing. Here's
my honorable discharge from the Ameri
can army to prove that I'm of good char
acter."
Fisher exhibited hie discharge to prove
that he had it.
"I wouldn't have done It, maybe," he
said, changing his tune a little, "if tHe
women hadn't provoked nu to it. They
said some fresh things and made me mad.
Then the two men Jumped on mo and
tried to throw me out. Of course that
made me madder and I accidentally broke
a pane of srlass. I didn't hurt anybody
and didn't mean to."
Fisher not only faces a jail sentence
with no alternative, which Justice Edgar
likes to give, but he is.very'likely to lose
his ealoon license. The Town Trustees
have all eald that if the charges of mis
conduct against Fisher are sustained
they will vote to revoke his license.

"The trouble was that proper investiga
tion was not made by the representatives
of the State board. Several of the arrest
ed ones have all of their credentials and
certificates, and It was unpardonable neg
lect that permitted them to be arrested.
The State board has not only placed the
arrested men In an embarrassing position,
but has shown that they have not made
proper examination into affairs before
they caused the complaints to be Issued.
They allowed men who had compiled with
the law in every particular to be arrested
and the word to go out that they were
not regular practitioners. The board has
certainly made Itself liable, but what will
be done is as yet undetermined."

"something" Is remains uncertain, and
the arrested dentists do not care to go
Into details in advance, but they are talk-
Ing mysteriously about how the State
Board of Dental Examiners has laid that
organization "liable."
Certain it is that the State board Is go-
Ing to discover Just what the arrested
dentists think about hasty arrests, even
if the threat of damage salts for Injured
reputations Is not carried out.

GUATMAS, Mexico, Oct. 21.â The Mexi
can Government authorities at Guaymas
have just been advised of a recent raid
of the town of San Lucas, Sonora, by
bandits who made their headquarters in
the Sierra Madre Mountains and who
â¢were led by a noted outlaw named Guada
lupe Arenas. The band rode into the
town about 3 o'clock en Monday after
noon, tied their horses in front of An
tonio Martinez's pardens, where they ask
ed for mescal, while the residents of the
trrwn looked on, too frightened to resist.
There were ten desperadoes besides Are
nas in the band, and after drinkins all
of the mescal in the place they became
incensed and began to shoot up the town.
" They rode through the streets tiring into
the .doorways and windows of houses.
Auzencio Meler.dex and Jesus Zalvidar,
born merchants of the town, were killed
by Volloys poured into the doorways of
their stores. The populace became terrl
flc-d and the women fled to the little
church in the town, where they prayed
for deliverance, while the men gathered
flround on the outside armed with rifles,
shotguns, revolvers and some with axes,
or any other weapons of defense which
They could procure. The Prefect of Po
lice assumed command of the volunteers
organized to protect the town and when
flie bandits attacked the party they met
.with a determined resistance. In the fight
which followed Arenas, the leader of the
outlaws, encaged in a hand-to-hand con
flict with Louis v-navez. the Prefect of
police, who feil< d the outlaw leader with
an "ax. striking him a terrible blow on
'tlie head. When they saw their leader
fall the bandits became demoralized and
retired, fleeing to the mountains and to
ward Fan Andreas. These who fled to
ward the neighboring town were pursued
and captured, but five cf the band es
eaped. Arenas, the leader of the band,
will die, while summary justice will un

Robert S. Smith, president of the Union

burg Clearing-house Association, said:
I was assured last night by President Lang
fltt that every depositor would get every dol

try banks which do business through the Fed
eral National may be temporarily embarrassed,
but even at that, it will be only temporarily.

When the business depression came on. the

to sharp declines on the Pittsburg Ex

sold from 115 down to 85, but it was
forced up to 101. All day yesterday it
sagged, and the closing quotation was 85,
a number of transactions having been
made at 80. J. A. Langfltt, president of
the Federal National Bank, in a signed
statement, says:
The Federal National Bank has finally yield.
W to the cocnblntd assaults of its stockhold

until arrangements can be made to discharge
all depositors' claims. The question of re
opening will then be decided
Borne such action as this has been
within the possibilities for the past few
days, forecasted by the determined raid
upon the institution's stock on the Pitts
burg Btock Exchange. However, the pos

Langfltt, to the effect that the bank was
not in need of money and that its losses
would not affect Its capital or surplus,
did much toward allaying distrust on the
part of. Its depositors, thus preventing a

JAMES B. CUNNINGHAM. Receiver.
During the hearing Bryan introduced a
mass of correspondence between himself,
and Bennett from the year 1896 to 1900.
He read a number of the letters aloud, in
order to show that Bennett repeatedly
made offers of financial assistance to him.
On four occasions, according to the wit
ness, Bennett sent him money to aid
him, the amount in all aggregating $3500.
He related that in May, 1900, Bennett
came to Lincoln, Neb., to discuss the
provisions of his will and told Bryan
that he wished him to accept a bequest of
$50,000, believing that he would need it
later. A suggestion made by Bryan at
that time was to the effect that if Ben
nett so desired, he could embody it in a
request to Mrs. Bennett in a letter to be
left with the will. He further suggested
that the money be left in trust to himself
to distribute among educational and
philanthropic institutions. After Bennett
returned East he executed his will and
sent a copy to Bryan of what, he said,
was the letter which he left for Mrs.
Bennett, with his will.
When Bryan's statement had been con
cluded, Judge Stoddard said that the will
would be contested by Mrs. Bennett of
Bryan sought to secure the money, be
lieving that Bryan had no equitable
right to it.
Bryan, in reply, said, that not one cent
of the money would he allow either his
wife or his children to receive unless
Mrs. Bennett were willing. He, however,
did intend to, ask the court to decide the
validity of the bequest, so that in case
It was declared legal he could distribute
the money among educational and char
itable institutions.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Oct. 2L â As a
climax to the hearing of' the application
of the probating of the will of the late
Philo S. Bennett, accompanying which
was a sealed letter which William J.
Bryan to-day testified was a request that
be accept $50,000, Judge Stoddard, who
represents Mrs. Bennett, declared that if
Bryan insisted upon receiving the fund
his client would contest the will.
He declined to say whether there would
be other removals, but it is understod
that, while a few others may follow,
there may not be any wholesale dismis
sals. It is said that there are three or
four other employes upon whose conduct
there is some reflection and whose cases
hang in the balance. They were not im
plicated so much as those whose cases
were acted upon to-day and some of them
may remain permanently in the postal
service, though, possibly, not in their
present positions.
"Weis, the New York clerk who has been,

dential relations with George W. Beav
ers, late superintendent of the salary and
allowance division, and he is charged
with having acted as a medium through
which other clerks in the New York post
offlce were communicated with.
In reply to questions, Mr. Payne said
the removals were the result of disclo
sures made, to the Brlstow report.
"I have read the report," he said, "and
am free to say that my, action to-day was
the resiijt of its perusal."
C. B. Terry, a clerk in the division of sup
rlies, has been removed for making false affi
davits; attempting to obtain money from clerks
under the guise that he could influence their
promotion and general Inefficiency.
Louis Kempfner. superintendent of the reg
istry system, has been removed for incom
petent and negligent administration; for waste
ful and unnecessary extravagance In sending
expensive manifold registration books to a
large number of small fourth-class postofflces
and for violating the revenue laws by a sys
tem of petty smuggling.
Michael W. Lewis has been removed .from
the office of superintendent of supplies because
the recent investigation showÂ» that he in
fluenced the awarding- of contracts (or sup
plies to favored bidders : that he has been
extravagant and wasteful In the administra
tion of his office and that he has paid ex
cessive prices for supplies to favored con
tractors.

OUn ASSOCIATION.
For details of "what has been accomplished
during the past year I shall refer you to the
report of the chairman of the executive coun
cil, within whose province the active work of
the association lies,, more particularly, and the
reports of the various committees.
Our membership continues to show a healthy
and gratifying increase, and has risen beyond
7000. The work of our protective committee
has been puished with the vigor and Intelligence
which has characterized it for years past. Your
committee on uniform laws has continued its
valuable work, and we look forward to the
time when tho law of negotiable Instruments
Hhall he the same in all of our States. The
work being done by our committee on educa
tion, is only equaled <by the undeveloped field
before it. There may have been, doubts at
times In the minds of some of our members
as -to the value of this work, but the results
achieved, as set forth in. tha committee's re
port, leave no further room for question. What
more eloouent tribute to this work could be
paid than that which I received In a recent
letter from one of our prominent members,
reading: "Already four Of the most prominent
men in Instituting 'our chapter have been
raised from 'the ranks* to officials In the banks
with which they are connected."
i Your fidelity committee has devoted Itself
with painstaking care and assiduity for several
years to the protection of your members
against the unfaithfulness of employes and to
the establishing of a uniform and fair form of
bond, at reduced rates, which has resulted In
the saving of -many thousands of dollars to our
members. The work of . the committee- has
brought it to the- point of outlining the future
feasibilities . in the establishment of. a "bank
ers' guaranty fund." This would seem to be
the- logical conclusion of this work, and unless
such a plan be adopted, the committee has,
probably, accomplished 'all it can do: The
success' which similar funds have met with in
England and the establishment of them by
large banks and other corporations attest
their practicality. I cannot too strongly urge
upon you the careful Â¦ consideration of the re
port of the committee" on this most important
matter. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ '. .
In reviewins the various subjects touched
upon, 1 have not hesitated to criticize, where I
have felt it necesary, and to display a danger
signal 'where ft "seemed to be required, bat
while, counseling conservatism, I would not
have you count me a pessimist. Banking has
developed '. into a ' profession and not a mere
trade. .W,e are ' insisting upon a more â¢ ade
quate preparation for business, .tor a larger
education; a 'deeper knowledge ol principles
and economics and a fuller appreciation of the
principles which should govern the relations of
"men In- banklnsr .'and commercial life. The
achievements of our association in protective,
educational and" legislative work accentuate
the possibilities of organized effort and our
growth in membership and influence are the
tangible returns of the seeds which we have
gown. May our future years continue to be
filled with 'the further, fruition of our efforts.
Who can recount the friendship formed and
tell of the memories of pleasant . intercourse
graven deep in our hearts, â¢ for which we .are
Indebted to our beloved association? -These
may not be weighed end measured. by scale and
rule, but still would alone be sufficient reason
for our existence. . Â» ' Â¦ .
. Let us turn our faces, then, to the bright
future of our country â¢ and our association.
When the rising : sun -to-day first touched .the
easternmost border of . our country it ; looked
down upon,the richest and most prosperous na
tion in the world, and when to-night It shall
have cast its last rays on the Golden Gate and
passed on to Hawaii and the Philippines li wilt
leave behind the most enlightened and progres
sive people It has ever shone upon â we of our
great republic. . . . .

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
Recommendations of Importance to
Financial World Are Made.
The report of the executive council was
submitted by Chairman K. S. Swinney.
It gave in detail the work accomplished
by the association during the last year.
In substance it read: The membership
during the last year has increased, as
veil as the income of the association.
The main item of expense was that in
curred by the protective committee In the
running down and breaking up of danger
ous criminals.
The committee on education has been
showing good effects and its expenses
have decreased.
The committee on fidelity insurance of
fers the following resolution as an amend
ment to article III of the constitution of
the American Bankers' Association by the
addition of section 2: \ (* ;:
Section 2. The executive council shall ap
point a board of five trustees for the man
agement and administration of a fund to be
known as the American Bankers' Guaranty
Fund. Said fund shall be established for the
purpose of enabling such of the members of
this association and their employes as may
elect to ' become subscribers and contributors
thereto, and to avail themselves of the advan
tages thereof to provide by means of a gen
eral co-operation among said members and
their employes, a fund from which said mem
bers may be reimbursed for losses arising from
the dishonest acts of their employes. Said
board of trustees shall establish rules and reg
ulations for the government and management
.of said fund and the rules and regulations
adopted by the trustees shall be binding upon
all the contributors to and beneficiaries of said
fund. . r- ' - - . Â¦
Vacancies In the said board of trustees shall
be filled by the executive council., and -It shall
be the duty of the council to annually appoint
an auditing committee to audit the books and
accounts of said trustees; but nothing herein
contained shall be construed as creating - any
.financial lability, by the association on account
of said fund. ._ .
The council,, after considering the ilia
which mlcht arise should the association
adopt the amendment, recommended that
it be not. adopted.
Lewis E. Pearson, vice president of the
New .Vork 'National. Exchange Bank, of
fers, the. following resolution:
Resolved, That this association adopt a bank
money order system and that the president ap
point a committee of five to devise a plan
whereby^ members _can be .furnished uniform
bank money orders with . proper advertising
matter in connection with the same at a mini
mum cost.
The report . of this committee shall be ren
dered to the executive council, which Is here
by empowered and requested to authorize such
expenditures as shall in their Judgment be
proper to enable the committee to carry out Its
recommendations.
The council recommends the adoption
of the above resolution.
; A resolution has been submitted by
Stephen ,M. Grlswold, president of. the
Union Bank of Brooklyn, N. Y., as fol
lows: .':.â¢?". : .'V.V'" V â¢
Whereas, The practice of paying Interest on

grown to the extent of impairing the prosperity
ot . many of the banks of our country, be it

vention 'that .conservative banking demands
that no such Interest shall be paid.
' Resolved, That the foregoing resolution b* re
ferred to i the executive council for considera
tion p.nd action. -
Â¦ This resolution will be placed before the
convention. '
It has been the custom to appropriate
the sum of $5000 to be; used to help defray
the exaenses of - the convention In the
city in which it is held, and this custom
was "" carried out here. The bankers of
San / Francisco: refused to accept tK&
money and insisted on paying all of the
expenses of -the convention. â¢

conclusion, u It always does, and In the final
adherence to the tsold standard .laid . a â¢ new
corner-stone of prosperity. And what has en
abled us to build on. Oils foundation thÂ» wide

crops, as the fountain source, lending 1 a new
Impetus to the wheel* of industry. Insuring
abundant employment for labor- In. our fields,
our mines.' our .factories .and our railroads. A
conjunction of these reawakened enencle* sent
pulsating -through our- arteries of commerce an
Increased demand and production, .responsive
to each other. Good times have come again to
our farmers and our manufacturers, and our
railroads have been burdened with our cropa
and products and the return merchandise pur
chased-with their proceeds. â¢â¢;â¢
The unprecedented prosperity of the past few
years, growing out of these conditions, brought
us last fall to a climajc of high prices for com
modities and securities of all kinds. The same,
sunshine which brings to Its full fruition, our
rich harvests also testers the tares, unless they
be plucked up. So among * the ! substantial
edifices of our prosperity have sprung up art^
ficial commercial structures, which. have failed
signally to stand the test of time. Oversan
gulne people, some probably not overscrupulous
(but there are few people more capable of
making trouble than your full-fledged, unadul
terated optimist), swept away with the craze
for making money or anxious to profit by this
craie In others, had been capitalizing and re
capitalizing schemes of all kinds and inducing
people with paper profits to underwrite flota
tions which they were as unable to carry as
Gulliver was to lift himself by his boot straps.
The boom had gone too far and the pessimists
predicted open disaster, the natural reaction
set" In. money was in demand at Increasing
rates extended credits were being withdrawn,
collaterals and securities were cl08el y J*=ru
tinUed and a general housecleanlng begun
where it was moÂ«t needed, in the weeding out
of overcapitalisation and inflated securities.
We have gone through a period of liquidation
in speculative circles of the most drastic chap,
acterwithout serious results Â«cept to the few
who have got too far beyond their depth. The
process Is not yet complete and the way is
etm strewn with cripple, and "indigestible"
"cur-ties, but that general business conditions
are round no one can doubt. That we shall
have an ebb and flow in the tides of Industry
is as Srtain as the cycle of the seasons, and
he i>SrÂ£ o? tfcUe tides comes from our mother
earth to the tillers of our toil and, as seed time
and harvest yield returns, so shall our pros

A WORD OF CAUTION
Let us review, briefly, the attitude and rela-.
tion of *5ne of our banking Institutions to
ithe conditions and incidents "*Â«â¢ d B JÂ°JJÂ£ d
the methods pursued by them In the "- 1 J?!??"
tion of their business. I refer especially to
Ihe vtclous policy of paying high rates for de
Â¦posUf particularly savings and time deposits.
The incidents of 1803 and the next few subse-
Ju'nt rearY left their indelible tmsre*. upon
the mlndÂ« of most of our older bankers, but
th^re are not wanting signs that these lessons
have bÂ£n forgotten. If there Is any class
of men more than others who should ne\er
take epeculatlve risks it Is those who are
handling the earnings and savings of others.,
and the seeking of deooslts at high rates ot
interest, which can only be earned by specula
tive investments, is a menace to sound banK
lng Havings depositors for safety of princi
pal* rather than alluring Interest rates, which
are nccepsarily coupled with greater hazards,
should . carefully shun such institutions, of
which there are. however, happily, but few.
Our banks, lndissolubly linked with the com
mercial interests of our country, have been as
a whole eminently conservative, and the pres
ent confidence In their stability and sound
ness attests the ability and fidelity with which
you, their representatives, have discharged
your great responsibilities.
HAVE WE OVERTAXED OUR WEALTH?
. The vast increase In our national wealth Is
unmistakably attested by the enormous In
crease In bank deposits. In the aggregate value
of our marketable securities, of manufactured
products and our industrial plants. That we
have successfully 6tood the liquidation through
which we have passed U another unmistakable
evidence of our wealth, but, after all, have we
not been attemptlnc to develop our resources,
even in a ligltlmale way, more rapidly .than
our capital would conservatively permit of?
Our steady increase of population, heajthy as
It Is. is almost inflnitesslmal compared with
the field before us In undeveloped resources of
our country. The population which our coun

CURRENCY.
The changes have been rung on it and
rightly. I fear you would be reluctant to ad
mit you know more about it than your Bible,
but I suspect you think you do all the tamp.
and if there Is anything about which a banker
thinks he knows more and probably knows less
it is the currency. The conditions existing in
this 'country differentiate the currency problem
for us from that of any other country that has
ever bad a paper currency, and every man's
views are more or less theory when he has had
no opportunity of demonstrating them practi
cally. What part has the currency problem
played in tbe stirring commercial events to
which I have alluded? The vast majority or
us feel assured we have had so far all the
currency we have needed and that an increase
of It Just at this time would lend a further
undesirable stimulus Â¦ to speculation. The
enormous production of gold in the last
few years (about which we are to
have some very Interesting ficures from
one of Â¦ our distinguished guests) - has
been either lost sleht of. or. If studied,
will 'furnish food for thought. The advantages
claimed for the bank circulation of other
countries over our bond secured notes have
much merit from a scientific standpoint and
would have more- -from a practical standpoint
if the clement of risk could be eliminated
which has brought disaster in some Instances â
notably In that of the Australian banks some
years ago. The practical question is, could it
be satisfactorily grafted on to our banking
eyEtem. and. If .so. how? The Idea of a "cen
tral bank" or a "branch banking system" la
repugnant to our conception of free govern
ment and institutions, and. unless I mistake
the temper of our . peoDle, . will never be ac
cepted. Neither will any form of currency be
accepted which does not carry with it the
same confidence of security which ! our bank
notes now enjoy.
The discussion of the matter from an aca
demic standpoint can be prolonged indefinitely
but what th* practical banker wants is details
which will carry conviction to bis mind as to
how such a currency can be so guarded as
tp fulfill the. conditions outlined. What we
need is a currency to be used, not for the
purroso of creating new liabilities but to en
able us to move our crops without distress and
to liquidate comfortably liabilities already cre
ated. W* shall, probably, arrive at nome so
lution of this question, first. In the shape of a
-limited circulation, so highly taxed as to'per
mit -only of Its temporary use, from time to
time, and be governed further by the results
cf this experiment. I should use here the
popular term of "emergency circulation." but
for a recent protest from a friend in discuss
ing this BUbect. which suggests the paraphrase
United States than at any previous period in
our history. Taking the country altogether,
there la no scarcity of money. Including United
States and national bank notes, to meet any
legitimate demands of business. Compared
with September 1 a year ago the national
banking circulation has Increased (52,827,551.
The general stock of money * In the United
States September 1, 1903, was as follows:
$l,2tS7,~33,tU9 gold coin, including bullion In
Treasury; $5o5,Â£53,494 standard silver dollars;
$101,867,228 subsidiary rtlver; $17,970,000
Treasury notes of 1S90; $34^681.016 United
States notes; $418,587,975 national bank notes.
Total, $2,708,693,662.
At the same date there was In circulation
$Â«2O^75.159 gold coin; $394,135,919 gold eer
tlficates; $72,959,612 standard silver dollars;
$155,923,384 sliver certificates; $92,870,952 sub
sidiary silver: $17,850,254 Treasury notes of
1S9O; $335,377,568 United States notes: $399.
3*4,930 national bank notes. . Total. $3.2S8,
902,178, making a circulation per capita of
$29 60, compared with $28 65 September 1,
19C2.
In the opinion of your committee the most
serious need is the reform of the Eubtreasury
system In such wise that the money with
drawn from the banks for custom duties, as
well as internal revenues, shall be deposited
in the banks and thus be made available for
use In the community from which It has been
withdrawn. "Such a reform could be Inaugu
rated by giving to ttie Secretary of the Treas
ury discretionary authority to permit deposits
to the extent of 50 per cent of the capital and
surplus of national banks of customs receipts,
as well as Internal revenue receipts guaran
teed by securities acceptable to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Such an arrangement would
render impossible the embarrassments which
have frequently occurred . as .the result of
Treasury accumulations.
Regarding the question of circulation, the
first and most Important requirement Is the
Immediate repeal Of the present^ limitations
of $3,000,000 per month upon the .withdrawal
of circulation, so that the expansion and con
traction will . be automatic and . governed by
the surrounding, situations. Under the present
restrictions many banks are unwilling to Issue
currency for temporary and legitimate needs,
which they would Issue If .they felt certain
that their currency could be J retired when no
longer needed.
Emergency circulation could, within careful
limitations, be safely permitted upon the act
ual deposit with the Treasury Department of
securities acceptable to the Secretary of the
Treasury. And upon such deposits circulation
could be Issued promptly to meet actual emer
gencies, which would not be possible If time
were taken for the examination of sreneral as
sets by the Secretary of the Treasury and
Comptroller of the Currency. A tax of 6 per
cent per annum should be Imposed upon such
emergency circulation to insure and hasten its
return to the issuing bank: this tax to be set
sside as a safety fund to secure the United
States Treasury for the redemption of notes so
issued. This emergency circulation should be
issued without. any distinguishing mark from
other national bank circulation except to sub
stitute the words "secured by bonds approved
by the Secretary of the Treasury." Instead of
the words. "Bonds of the United States." for.
being amply secured, there should be no dis
crimination against it beyond the 6 per cent
tax.
To further liberalize the circulation, your
committee recommends that the United States
tax on circulation should be uniform on the
issue of currency based on all classes of United
States Government bonds.
In the Judgment of your committee these
modifications of law can be authorized with
out damage or discredit to the national bank
circulation, but your committee cannot recom
mend arty step that will tend toward a return
to the miscellaneous circulation which pre
vailed in the country before the war. or any
step which, will disregard the history of finance
among th* commercial nations of the world,
nor can'lt recommend that any note should.be
Issued without the certainty of Its redemption
in standard coin of the United States.

In tbÂ» foregoing report I am impelled to
dissent from the recommendat^m for the repeat
of the Jaw restricting the redemption of . na
tional Dank circulation to $3,00O.0CO a month,
for the reason chiefly that it seems to me to
be Inconsistent ' to* in the same report recom
mend a- method for an increased circulation
and to insert a provision urging a means by
which the circulation may be at any time di
minished.
With the exception of this dissent the fore

The report of the committee on fidelity

cussion on the part of many of the dele

the necessity of the banks of the associa

accepting . bonds from fidelity .and guar
antee companies. The report of the com
mittee suggested an amendment to the
constitution of the association by which
the banks could accomplish this end, but
the executive council had reported against
its adoption. I â¢ -
The ' members of the association that
favored the adoption of the resolution to
enable the banks to do their own bonding
were opposed by delegates who repre
sented fidelity and securlty.companies, the
latter seeing that the adoption of the
resolution meant a loss of business to
their corporations.

SUB-TREASURY SYSTEM,
The natural function of a bank Is to gather
the money of the community that it serves
and distribute it in loans on good security
among those who need It. and the bank that
performs this â¢ function with the greatest care
and success best eerves the Interest of its
people. The money of the country should
stay in the channels of trade, and â¢ th*. miser
who gathers Ms gold and hoards It is a .para
site on the body politic, but when the Govern
lijenf by taxation gathers money In advance
and in excess of Its needa. and .withdraws the
came from the channels of --trade, it 1st doing
exactly what the miser does. No other intelli
gent people would have eo long rested pas
sively under such a syBtenr, and we should
voice - our demands for a reformation of this
pernicious practice In no uncertain tones.-
. Tbe disposition of a secretary to minimize
this difficulty should not depend upon an In
dividual construction of the law. but tha
statutes on the subject should be made so
plain as to make the duties of the Secretary
ministerial only, and so regulate the operations
of the Government as to meet Us requirements
without friction with the general finances of
W A m d7Â£ussion of the currency brings us
Irresistibly to the consideration of this anti
quated method of handling Government funds.
and the report of our currency committee,
heretofore referred to. accentuates the neces
sity for dealing with this subject as a question
to be first disposed of. precedent to the under
taking of any currency reform. The demoraliz
ing effect of the annual talk regarding the
locking up of money In the treasury s almost
worse than the actual withdrawal of the funds.
Remove the cause of the discussion and ths
ending of It will be quite as .beneficial the
actual freeing of the money. I hope it maj
bÂ« your pleasure to push vigorously the reform
recommended by the committee in this respect.
INDUSTRIALS
A consideration of "our present development
and conditions would not be complete without
reference to our corporations of the present
day standing as they necessarily do In -such
Intimate relatlon*hlp to banking
In the formation of our great industrial cor
porations we have been confronted with new
and strange conditions, so experimental in
character that we can. aÂ» yet, reach no con
clusion as to what will be their destiny.
Eliminating those of a fraudulent or fictitious
character . nearly all of them have been sub
ject to criticism in the matter of capitaliza
tion, and the weak point, I might say, with all
of them has been the failure to provide a
reasonable working capital. A considerable
number of minor corporations with local credit
were able to secure on a legitimate basis an
aggregate of bank accommodation largely, .in
excess of that which could bo secured by many
of the .consolidated corporations -into which
theÂ«e minor concerns have been merged. The
necessities for enlargements and Improvements
have not been adequately provided tor and the
working canttal has often -been further, im
paired by the illegitimate declaration of divi
dends. That the follU-a and peccadillqfl of
these enterprises have not brought nnre serious
consequences to the whole body, politic . is , a
cause of congratulation, but it la a subject
for regret that there have . been so . many. In
nocent sufferers from their operations.
RAILROADS.
There has been a greater creation of securities
In the consolidation of many of our railroads
than aetual values apparently Justify, and
where this has been the case we naturally
cannot lend our approval, but the concentra
tion of management' and' control ha* brought
about a stability of rates which has created
an established value for their legitimate ee
curlties without hardship to the patrons of
the roads. It Is a serious question . whether
the aggregate market value of all of our rail-,
road securities equals tbe amounts originally
expended in ' the construction of them with
even a moderate return upon the Investments.
The reduction in the cost of transportation
by reason of the great improvement Jn- the
physical conditions of the roads . has made it
possible to move freight profitably at rates
which would have formerly been ' considered
impossible I do not mean ' to suseest that
the roads should be left entirely free- in . the
matter of fixing rates, but the reasonable con
centration of their management should rather
facilitate their control In this respect by con
servative legislative enactment., The enor
mous increase of business developed by our
prosperous condition has so^. overtaxed exist
ing facilities as to necessitate extensive â¢ lm r
provements, which have brought tha Toads into
the market with borrowings which -have,seri
ously taxed our resources; but where these
improvements have been undertaken on a legit
imate basis there is apparently little reason to
apprehend any difficulty in carrying them to
a successful completion and utilization.
PUBLICITY.
A word on this subject, -as If relates to all
public corporations.. Some criticism has recent
ly been made. of the publication of the weekly
New York bank statement. I use , the incident
merely to^point a moral. . The form and meth
od of making this statement has â¢ been, more
or less, a subject of discussion for come time
past. If the form . and method - of publication
Is not as - accurate as it should be, make it
what It should be.. but do not suppress It. The
publication, occasionally, of an individual bank
statement. . which it subsequently develops is
not legitimate, would be a poor excuse for the
suppression of bank statements In general,, and
I thick a suggestion . that we do away with
bank statements would be unanimously vetoed.
Bank statements. In general,, convey, fair and
intelligent information as to the status of the
banks and, if ' the. same publicity, from -.other
public corporations could be required, . a most
important service * would ; be rendered - to . the
public. The great Insurance companies, which
look to' the public for support,' recognize the
wisdom of publicity by publishing full detailed
reports.' And where this principle Is not volun
tarily recognized the States by wise legislation
have protected the public by the establishment
of departments for the supervision of the,com
panies. = " The Â¦Â¦ Government â¢ has â¢ now* taken ". up

Association convened yester

San Francisco has had many gather

but. It .Is no exaggeration to say that
rever In the history of this city has bo
many men of financial standing* In the
country been Been here.
It Is not easy to conceive the magnitude
of the wealth represented by the men
that act as custodians of the finances of
the American people. That the bankers
fcave been Â¦well trained to the idea that
"time Is money" was Ehown In yester
day's proceedings, for not a minute was
wasted.
The convention reflected the methods of
bankers. Everything moved with precis
ion and compactness and a vass amount
of work was accomplished at the first

There xras no elaborate decoration of
the theater. A few American flaes were
draped around the boxes and the tables
on the stage. Bunches of flowers were
numerous. j ls*>i
When President Caldwell Hardy, called
the meeting to order, the theater was
filled en the lower floor and many vis

made- by tha executive council at the- Denver
meeting in August. 1S9S. and adopted by the
association. "That a commute* of this asso
ciation be appointed to inquire Into tn* rates
of surety bonds and to recommend a standard
form of policy, and to consider any plan or
plans that may be submitted." wo havÂ« en
deavored to carry out tbe wishes of the coun
cil and the association to tbe best of our
ability.
The commute* in this work has endeavored
to be absolutely fair with all parties Inter
ested, and has endeavored to consider without
partiality the equitable rights of the employes,
the employers and. the fidelity companies. -. and
in Its reports has endeavored to point, out the
true conditions as they have been found to ex
ist from the carefully gathered statistics re
ported to us confidentially by, the banks of th*
country. "We are satisfied the Information we
have is the moat reliable of any to be had in
the United States.
The committee wishes to emphasise the fact
that since Its appointment in 1808. and the
careful study of Its reports by many of the
members th* rates for writing bonds have
become -more uniform and have been reduced
fully 25 per cent, resulting in the annual sav
ing to the members of the association alone of
$132X68 50, a sura of money almost doub*a
the annual dues of this association, to say
nothing of the benefits the efforts of this com
mittee have been to non-members, which would
easily equal that of the saving in premium to
the members. * ... ' Â¦ -'.- Â¦''-,
We have had prepared by the best legal
talent the American Bankers' Association
copyrighted form of bond. This bond. wÂ» be
lieve Is the best form of bond written to-day.
It Is' equitable to the Insurer and the Insured,
and gives protection to tha bank. â¢ We ar*
convinced of its merits, as there has never
been to the knowledge of this committee, a
contested loss on this form of bond, and there
have been cases where, on the same risk, other
forms have been contested and the associa
tion form paid. â..'.,
Another proof that our form of bond is su
perior Is th* fact that all fidelity companies.
with three exceptions, exact a higher rate
than on their own form for obvious reasons.
We need to advance no stronger argument why
our members should use the association's
Another proof of Its merits is that 40 per
cent of th* members of tbe, association hava
adopted It after a careful examination of Its
provisions by their attorneys. This Is the
only bond written that has to stand upon It*
own merits as fidelity companies never *n>r
to write It unless the banks Insist upon hav-
An advantage to members who us* th* as
sociation form of bond is that it Is being uni
versally adopted and thereby secures uniform
ity to banks In case of litigation.
The Comptroller of Currency and the Danlc
ing departments of many of the States, insist,
and the laws of some of the States require,
that banks bond their- employes, not only -for
the protection of their stockholders, but for
the protection of their Customers as well.
The apparent desire of corporate fidelity in
surance or bonding companies to discriminate
against the American Bankers' Association
copyrighted form of bond has led
this committee to recommend that
the American Bankers' Association es
tablish what may be known as the Ameri
can Bankers' Guarantee Fund, under the man
agement of a board of trustees to be appointed
by the executive council to guarantee the fidel
ity of the employes of those banks only
that are members of the association.
From our reports we have learned that our
members ar* carrying J133.706.570 In bonds.
and are paying annual premiums of Â»3SS.
773 33 against a. loes averaging for toe past
ten years not to exceed J15.000 per annum.
We " are convinced- that the bankers of this
country ar* paytag an excessive rate for this
Insurance and our convictions are supported
by statistics of English companies covering
periods of thirty-seven and thirty-eight years
respectively. W* are convinced that tt Is not
good policy for the American Bankers' Asso
ciation to single out and authorize the sec
retary, or any on* the association might see
fit to appoint, to solicit business for some par
ticular bonding company, as is now being
done by many State associations, for a com
mission which Is paid into the treasury of
the organization. This method carries a moral
guarantee at best, of any company that may
be selected and places the association in a
position which in time might bring serious
'"your committee, having carefully studied
conditions here and abroad, and having gath
ered statistics as complete as possible, reported
to the executive council and the New Orleans
convention that unless it was the purpose o'
the" association to put the Information to some
practical use, the committee be discharged. It
was decided by the executive council that this
committee continue Us labors for another year,
and that its report be published In pamphlet
form and sent to the members of the associa
tion calling the attention of the members
especially to this report and asking for their
approval or disapproval. Not having a com
plete list of our members, we sent our report
to all backers of the United States, and in an
swer to our inquiries received replies from
forty-two hundred and fourteen (4214) mem
bers or about two-thirds of this association,
reporting favorably to the association taking
up the work: three hundred and ninety-three
(333) reporting unfavorably, while two thou

less than one-thirdâ mostly private bankers and
bond brokers â were Indifferent and did not an

association we received twenty-seven hundred
and sixty-nine (27G9) replies, and of this num
ber twenty-seven hundred and- fifteen (27}3)
favored the scheme, while fifty-four 154) op
posed It. A majority of those banks not mem

Th* executive council at New Orleans de

corporations, and owing to the conflictin* laws
of the different States, under aavlce.of the best

one safe and practical way to bond employes

earthed In the bed of the Calloway irri
gation canal the remains of an animal of
gigantic size, somewhat resembling a
horse, but quite ' different in many ways
from the modern equine* The specimens
of the find were sent to Dr. J. C. Mer
riam, palaeontologist , of the. State. Uni
versity. It . Is presumed to be a relic of
the tertiary age. Further epecimens of
the fossil are being unearthed ana sent
to the university.
In regard to the Bakersfleld fossil Dr.
Merriam said : to-night:
"1/ have not examined the remains yet
and so don't know what they, are of. The
bones are only partially unpacked.'. They
may be those of a common horse or some
prehistoric animal,^in- which "case I would
.not care to commit myself until I have
examined them. In any case they are not
particularly - valuable, except for their
completeness."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 2L
The saloons that line Park avenue, the
approach to the racetrack at Emeryville,
are allowing too many children behind
the swinging doors and the California So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children has made a preliminary investi
gation into the matter.
The proprietors of most of these saloons
live behind or over their places of busi
ness, and it is a fact that they allow
their own children the freedom of the
drinking portion of the building, to which
the Bodcty takes exception. The society
thinks that the surroundings are not such
as to help the rearing of children in a
proper way and if the parents themselves
do not take enough interest In their off
spring to bring them up away from the
ealoon Influence the society deems ft
within Its province to make a decided
move In that direction Itself.
Miss Helen Swett, secretary of the Ala
rnesla County branch of this society, has
made an examination into the conditions
that exist and has consulted with Marshal
Lane of Emeryville and Principal Mal
lock of the Emeryville school. These two
have agreed to assist her in her efforts to
change this condition. If the evj^is not
remedied Miss Swett threatens to appeal
to the courts and through guardianship
proceedings secure control of the children
and keep them away from the saJooas
Miss Swett said:
Wright had previously suggested that
doctors ought really to teach their pa
tients more than uiey do, and that they
might look upon thir professions a little
morÂ© from an ethical standpoint, per
haps. But when he got to the â¢ subject
of euthanasia he admitted frankly .that
it was simply a dream. As a dream,
however, he had no hesitancy in advocat
ing the doctrine. He said the city might
be divided into districts and every appli
cation should be considered most careful
ly, not merely by physicians, but by some
eminent clergymen selected for the pur
pose, and, of course, there should be the
consent of relatives and the consentâ even
the requestâ of the patient himelf.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â "Where prolon
gation of life Is simply prolongation' of
hopeless agony, it seems to me that it
would be proper, that such a patient
should quietly, decently and modestly be
allowed to end his suffering. It seems to
me that such a course would be a step
forward in civilization and a step further
away from barbarism."
In these words Rev. Merle St. C. Wright
of the Lenox-avenue Unitarian Church
placed himself on record to-night as fa
voring "euthanasia," which, In . medical
parlance, is the putting of Incurables to
death. The suggestion was made before
the New York State Medical Association,
which held its annual' dinner in Hotel
Manhattan to-night, and, while it caused
much surprise because of its source, It
was received with none the less hearty
applause. - i "--,:Â¦Â¦-

"Without going Into details, but just to show
the size' to which, the money .order business of
this country has grown, I will mention the
fact. that. the postofflce now. does a daily.busi
ness of more , than $1,200,000. averaging about
$7 . per , order. Â¦ As ' to â¢ the : express companies, .
reliable figures can be had from the brief Is
sued by the American Express Company In Its
suit with the Government on .the war revenue
tax ' seme Â¦ years ago, and .from .which I quote
the following:: "In the Vear. ending. December
31, '1898, money, orders were sold Â¦ by all Â¦ ex
press ' companies .to the. number of 10,135.032.
aggregating a. total amount of S120.O40.2T7 65.
The .exoress money.. order â¢ averages 111; 84 .- per
order and tbe 'average rate was' 10 cents per
order." It has'been estimated -that a clean
profit of $3,000,000 is annually, made by the
Government and the exbres* companies in the
selling - of â¢ these . orders ; and. the business _.ls
steadily growing. 1 ;Â¦ â¢ -_- Â¦ i Â¦ . - .- â¢ -
In view of these if acts it is but, natural that
there -should have' been; a general ' agitation
among, the. banks .of : America to- recover; this
money ', order ' business. â¢ - In " 189-1 the Texas
Bankers' '< Association adopted , what ; was called
the "reciprocal draft," for the purpose of com
peting ; with Â¦ the ; poetofflce ; and express \com
paniee. i This was '. a special form furnished
to ' Â¦ members Â¦ by ; the Â¦Â¦ association, : . ' limited : In
amount to v $200 . and cashed without. discount
by any' member. The association- expended
oonelderable money In ' supplying . the forms
and advertising matter. A "number of banks
expended* an f additional 1 amount' to advertise
it. Efforts to popularize , this instrument
proved futile. 1 the public seeming slow, to recog
nire a: "draft" as equal to. a "money order."
The Georgia ; Bankers' ' Assoclatldn In 1896,
two years, afterward, adopted- what was called
a - Vclrcular check," which." likewise,' ran its
course. ..It hag been thought by, the friends

the -Bankers' Association took the matter. up we
found Â¦ that - the contested claims dropped to

that the time had arrived when, the banks

Bartlett insisted that the . resolution
recommended by the committee be voted
upon, but he was frowned down.
F. G. BIgelow, vice president of the
Bankers' Association and president of the
First National Bank of Milwaukee, Wis.,
declared that the association had no right
to enter the insurance field and" that the
matter ought to be further considered by
bankers all over the country. He' wanted
the report of the committee referred to
the Incoming executive. council.
C. Q. Chandler of Kansas City opposed
the motion to set the matter over for an
other year. He wanted the question set
tled at this convention and took a fling
at the surety companies by saying,' "We
want no motions railroaded through by
representatives of surety companies from
Baltimore." An attempt was made to
have the meeting adjourned, but it failed
of the requisite support. . A vote. was tak

The Missouri Hankers' Association, which

Informed . that Kansas and California havÂ« a
bank money order system of some kind. Wash
ington, Nebraska, New York. Michigan, Lovis
iana, Tennessee and .Virginia have, already
adopted, â¢ or contemplate adopting.' a money or

seen that the Idea is a popular one, and !t will
not be long before many other Stales will ; be
giving: these money orders a trial. I believe
that .to a large extent â¢ the State associations
will succeed with these orders, bat it is my
fixed opinion that until a money-order sysurni
can be devised' whereby. Its orders wiU be asked
not -almost everywhere^â but everywhere as
readily as are the orders issued by the post
office and the express companies, the postofnee
and express companies will not be very, much
annoyed by our- competition. The business ob

prising State associations will not grow to any

some plan wnioh will make the money orders
Issued by the little batiks . of Ty Ty, Ga., and
Lickskillet. Tex.. Just as good as the, orders, Is-,

as 'good' as an order issued- by any -other bank.
The wise .and \ progressive leaders , of . these

IN THE SALOONS
On the lower floor a delightful supper
was served, where the nicest kind of
thing* were said by the visitors about
California hospitality and good fellow
ship and prodigality of entertainment.
The hour of the vocal concert was one
of rarest pleasure, as the guests could
stroll at will in the drawins-room and
Â¦tfll hear the sweet melodies floating from
above. The instrumental programme,
while hugely enjoyed, was not distinctly
heard save by those near the Searles gal
lery. This was distinctly a loss to the
*rucsts who lingered In the main hallway,
as the music was charmingly rendered,
notably the. horn solo (with a fiute obll
pato) by Ernest Schlott. His rendition of
Gounod's "Serenade" was indeed a reve
lation.

into the main hall and were strolling
through the treasure rooms on the lower
floor. \ Â¦*Â£".Â¦.Â¦
Alternating with these splendidly ren

City by the Sea, were the honored guests
of the directors of the Hopkins Institute
of Art. at whose bidding were gathered
more than 2000 people. What with beauty
and wealth, art, music and "thousands of
lights, the reception was one to live long
in the mists of the memory.
Ever beautiful in its conception and in
its furnishings, the institute permits of
but small latitude for the decorator, but
between the doorways gigantic baskets
had been hung with fine effect, drooping
vines fell tenderly from these airy
spheres, while on the cabinets and beside
them in the southern drawing-rooms min

attempt than this would indeed become
that crime of modernityâ "painting the

At an early hour guests began to fill the
upper galleries, from which a splendid

OTTO SPAMER
WINS THRONG
WITH VIOLIN
There were empty seats not a few last
night at Lyric Hall, but no gaps In tha
applause that met Otto Spamer, the vio
linist. This second appearance of the
fiddler showed him in an almost singu
larly more favorable . light thatr~at the
symphony concerts, the % more grateful
acoustics of Lyric Hall doubtless con
tributing to the effect. Mr. Spanner's pro
gramme Included a notaole variety of
styles, ranging from tha pure classicism
of the Bach "Chaconne" to the pyrotech
nic marvels of the Paganlni-Wllhelmj
concerto In D major. To say thai Mr.
Spamer was at his best In the Each num
ber Is to give high praise. His rendering
of this violin epic was indeed notable,
dignified, broad, smooth and fluently com
petent on the technical slae. Sympathy,
poise and distinguished tonal . beauty
marked the rendering of the little Wil
helmj "Romance." In whicn the violinist
was again/ delightful. The Chopin-Sar
asate "Nocturne" again found him curi
ously wanting In sympathy and authority.
In the Wieniawskl "Airs Russes" Mr.
Spamer'a clean and brilliant double-stop
ping welcomely Imposed Itself on the at
tention, the Intonation as throughout
being wholly admirable, do. too. In the
spirited and dramatic rendering of the
Paganinl-Wllhelmj concertoâ It seems, in
deed, that this player plays more easily
a scale of sixths or octaves than of single
notes. Not that this limits his technical
genius, but it is Its most notabl? feature.
The heartiest applause greeted the fiddler,
who has evidently established himself a3

"Crude California oil is heated to 180 or 190 de
grees. The heavier the oil the better the job, as the
low gravity oil contains the most asphaltum. This
causes the soil to pack and make a fine roadbed or
dressing for the levee. In the majority of cases the
embankments around the islands are used for roads,
as they are high and dry. By oiling them two pur
poses are served, as good roads mean much to the
farmers in both winter and summer. On Grand
Island quite a stretch of levee has been oiled and a
contract has been let to oil the levees on Roberts
Island.".
The work is going on under .contract. The' Sen
tinel reports that about fifty miles of levees have
been oiled in Yolo County. The coming of the rains
will cause a halt. The rainy season will test the
value of the experiment, which is novel.
The levees have annually been weakened. not only
by the wash of the waters but also by gophers and
burrowing squirrels. The ground has been powdered
very easily, by the passage of teams over.: it.
Crevasses are frequently caused by water, running
first-into the holes made by gophers and squirrels. It'
is supposed that the oil \ will drive these animals
away and will harden by solidifying the tops of the
levees and so prevent the land from annually blowing
away, as duÂ£t. -
vBarges are used to move the oil. An average: day.
of work is the oiling of a mile<of embankment. :* The
cost is regulated by, the, Â¦ amount of material used,
THE people of San Joaqutn County believe that
they have hit upon a plan that will prove to be
of inestimable value to the owners of reclaimed
lands and to island farmers. This is to treat the
levees with oil in a manner similar to that employed
on roads in many parts of the State. The Lodi Sen
tinel describes the process:

For a few days at least, while the bankers of the
United States are our guests, San Francisco is the
financial capital of the nation. And while the men of

safe, profitable and permanent investment in the city
that opens its Golden Gate to vast eastern empire*
of splendid prospect.
THE recent publication of the "Cambridge Mod
ern History: The United States," a'work com
piled by eminent historians and jurists both of
this country and of Europe, fills an important place
in literature. After all the years of crimination and
recrimination on the part of greater and lesser his
torians on both sides of the water, it-is full time for
an impartial study of the whole period of British and
American conflict. American love of fair play assures
a hearty reception by the American people, and Amer
ican educators especially, for a history of our people
which is in the nature of an international committee
report on the great points of dispute.
The cause of patriotism is/not, promoted by the
promulgation of falsehoods. The catholic spirit of
the late Lord Acton, who projected the Cambridge
series of histories, and of his successors who are now
carrying on the work, has provided a history of the
United States which is as impartial as the narrow per
spective of history will, allqw^ Of the thirteen coh
tributors to the work only four are British. ' The
crucial; periods in America's relations to the mother
country are reviewed by men of; first-class authority
on both sides, and their conflicting views upon con
troversial subjects are set forth side by- side for im
partial judgment %
In this age of ? ruth seeking it is fitting that past
differences between nations as well as those of the
present should be rectified.by joint tribunals of the
contesting parties. It is go-d ' therefore to have our
own historic quarrels investigated by impartial
specialists. In all fairness to our friends across the
.water as well as to ourselves we must recognize that
the time has corrie for, eliminating* the old bitterness
from our .popular, histories and making a serious effort
to learn the whole truth concerning the history of
the republic.. The Cambridge v.-ork will materially
help - in â¢ that direction,: and the welcome it has re
ceived in this country is an evidenced of' a 'â¢ growth
among our people of-a culture far superior to jingo
ism or provincialism. ' ,-

Â¦x tt t IIILE it is natural that Canadians should
\f\f be disappointed by the Alaskan boundary
* * award, there is no reason for expecting that
anyimng serious will follow affecting the relations
of the Dominion to the British empire. The feeling
exists principally in the personal political following
cf Sir Wilfrid Laurier and in British Columbia.
The people of that western province are very alert
and enterprising, in their push and vigor much re
sembling their neighbors on the Pacific Coast of the
United States. They are of the frontier and pioneer
element, self-centered and of independent spirit. But >
when they view the result more calmly they will see
hem little it touches their very great and permanent
interests. They have great natural resources in
stock-raising, mineral, timber and the raw materials
of manufacture, and in exploiting these will find
ample cxerpse' for their rare energies. As they are
mostly of English blood, they should rejoice that
Lord Alverstone has dignified their country and their
race by giving a decision in accordance with his
conscientious view of fact and equity, though seem
ingly against the material interests of his- own coun
try. The newspaper comment is not virulent,
though uttered in the language of disappointment,
and as for the street corner gossip in British Colum
bia about recession from the Dominion and the em
pire, it is merely effervescent.
The decision removes the last possible cause of
friction between the United States and Great Brit
ain, and puts any strife between the two so remote
as not to interest this or many succeeding genera
tions. One thing may be counted upon as sure. by
the British Columbians. This arbitration was en
tered into to extirpate the possibility of war, 'and, as
far as the United States is concerned, its result will
not be turned into a fresher and greater cause of war
by encouraging any secession or annexation move
ment in the western province. We want Canada for
a good neighbor only. True, there are some enthu
siastic Americans who think our manifest destiny
is to own the earth, but the vast majority of our
countrymen arc quite content with what we have.
Looked at in the light of the case and evidence
submitted, the boundary award conforms to justice.
It may well be that the expectation of a different re
sult entertained by British Columbians had its origin
in the belief that imperial considerations would move
Lord Alverstone to decide for them, regardless of
what the facts might be. That is apt to be the colo
nial feeling in such matters, and it no doubt in
fluenced Sir Wilfrid Laurier in setting up claims that
good lawyers, even in Canada, declared to be without
foundation. Laurier is a politician. His whole career
h*s been as a politician. From the moment of his
graduation as a lawyer he has been in politics and
not in the practice of his profession. He used this
boundary issue to strengthen himself in politics, and
it remains to be seen whether he will gain more by
claiming beyond reason than he would have gained
by a more moderate course.
The press of the United States takes the result
without exultation, and Â«s to be commended for ab
staining from adding fuel to the Canadian fire. It
is to be remembered that when the temporary
boundary was arranged as a modus vivendi the op
position press attacked Secretary Hay with extreme
virulence. Now that he and President Roosevelt
have proved the wisdom of moderation, â¢ and have
won ?.ll points of consequence to their country/ it is
too ranch to expect that their critics will do them
jnstke.

The general plan was to take water,
from the Feather River south of Ther
malito and to carry it along a ridge of
land on the west side of the river. Sur
veys were made and rights of way were
secured for the main line and for the lat
erals that were to distribute the water to
the farma In the county to be served.
The proposition was really tho revival of
one made about twelve years ago by T.
R. Flemlrg of Biggs. He succeeded In
having 12.W0 acres pledged to take the
water. The Butte County Canal Com
pany had pledges for about 4000 acres.
The directors of the Butte County Canal
Company, at a meeting in this city, de
cided to abandon the project of construct
ing an irrigation ditch. The reason as
signed for- this determination Is that
enough land owners in Butte County
having property along the line cannot be
Induced to sign contracts to bring their
lands under the ditch. The estimated
cost of construction Is $200,000 approxi
mately. Farmers were to pay $1 50 per
annum per acre for the first ten*,years
and $1 per acre per annum thereafter. E>.
C. McCallum was the leading mover for
the ditch.

onstrations and assumptions, Dowie started on his
church building career as a spiritual healer of physi
cal ills. He assumed unto himself the fetching title
of Elijah for theatrical effect. He teaches that man,
by getting into harmony with the spiritual, becomes
master of the material, but her; shrewdly maintains
that only one 'man has accomplished that feat, and
that man is Dowie, reinevnation of Elijah by di
vine crHination.
Once Avell established with a comfortable support
of devoted disciples, Dowie followed 'the identical
footsteps of the early Mormon elders and began to
incorporate a sociological element into his manu
factured creed. If the only true faith of salvation is
to have permanency, it must first build a new Jeru
salem, where the faithful might dwell in a sociologi
cal millennium. Like Nauvoo rose the new Zion
city. Community property is not of its scheme to
thr extent which was attempted in the Mormon
church, but community morals and community faith
are the main anchors of the Illinois Utopia. Above
all, about all, is John Alexander Dowie, the re
incarnate.
THE descent upon New York of John Alexander
Dowie, professed successor of Elijah, with
3000 disciples from Zion .City, is one of the pe
culiar religious anachronisms of -the age. Though
Dowie and his followers have been the butt of the
Eastern press and the subjects of copious fulmina
ttons from Eastern pulpits, his crusade against vice
in Gotham calls the attention of both the sociologist
and theologian to this, his self-constituted sect. \
'From the time that Christianity had its inception
down to the present day its history has been marked
by one never failing characteristic. In inverse ratio
to the temporary laxity and indifference to things
religious of the majority, which has occurred in reg
ularly recurrent cycles, there has been the remark
able energy of the few, which has approached fan
aticism in its ardor. The minority feels that the
moral conscience of the majority is in its keeping.
The fifteenth century witnessed the crusades of the
Â¦Rr.ssites and the Walloons. To the careless or
thodoxy of the English Cavaliers was set in bitter
opposition the fiery dogmatism of the Puritan. .John
Wesley arose in wrath against the wine-bibbing
E:shcn* of the eighteenth century. So likewise in
our cwn century of prevalent skepticism and infidel
ity hsve there arisen scores of prophets who have
! LeciÂ» the founders of creeds of more or less stability.
DOWIE, PSYCHIC CONJURER.
A young man profitably employed in a congenial
environment, enjoying the good will of his fejlows
and the confidence of his superiors, disappeared sud
denly a few days pgo to : live, it is thought, a life of
seclusion in the forests. He has pondered too se
riously, perhaps, over the sometimes very excellent
admonition to take to the tall trees.
Although the company will not atate the
conditions of the agreement between it
self and Gourley, It is generally under
stood that concessions were made to the
Chicago man as an inducement to draw
him into the combine.
Gourley controls several shingle mills in
.Humboldt | County and his defiance was
accepted as the forerunner of a bitter
warfare between the shingle interests of
the coast. Apparently, however, Gourley
and his rivals have come to a satisfactory
arrangement, for yesterday the .Pacific
Redwood Shingle Company advanced the
price of redwood shingles to fl 65, and
later- it was announced that the outside
concerns, including Gourley, had joined
the combine.
.The Pacific Redwood Shingle Company,
an organization composed of the majority
of the mills in Northern California and
which has for a long time controlled the
shingle trade on the coast, baa/ at last
gained a firm footing In the Eastern sec
tion 1 of tbe country. Recently, with a
view of forcing all the California shingle
mills into its concern, the, Pacific Red
wood Shingle Company , cut the price of
its product from/ $1 80 a thousand to SI 45
and.' gave its competitors to understand
that it : was ; prepared to~ make a further
cut in the event of the outside mills re
fusing to enter the combine. Two weeks
ago ; Arthur, Gourley, a wealthy lumber
man of Chicago, who is regarded as one
of the heaviest dealers in shingles In this
country, arrived here and '."a- few days
later he and the , representatives of the
local company 1 were holding conferences.
Gourley had been fighting the California*
combine for some time and immediately
after his â¢ arrival he publicly announced
thai he /was prepared to go beyond the
rival's cut with a still lower one, and that
under no circumstances would he join the
combination.

' The Board of Education held its regular
weekly meeting yesterday afternoon^
Mrs. M. L* Dimmicfc was transfenred
from the Fremont School back to the

Kennedy was transferred from the W In
field Scott School to the Emerson, and
Mrs. Mildred Thomas from the Emerson

The exposure made, by The Call of that inconsis
tency, has served to remind the people of the worth
lessness of the utterances of the yellow organ. That
point, however, is a matter of little interest to intel
ligent people^ and of no moment whatever .to the
campaign. The vital issue is that of ' electing a
Mayor into whose hands the people. may safely place
the vast powers of the mayoralty under the charter,
aud of electing along with him a Board of Super
visors and a set of administrative officers who will
aid him in his efforts to provide the city with a
thoroughly .efficient and economical government in
all departments.
Whatever views may be held concerning the per
sonal merits of this or that candidate, there can be
no disputing the fact that back of Mr. Lane and of
Mayor Schmitz are certain forces that make for dis
content and strive for factional and too often mere
personal interests. On the other hand; back of Mr.
Crocker and his colleagues on the Republican ticket
stand the conservative elements of the people, capital-,
ists, business men and workingmen, whose joint
labors tend to the prosperity of the community and
the welfare of all. That fact in itself is sufficient to
incline thoughtful men who have been accustomed,
to act as independents In local politics to cast their
votes for the Republican ticket.
The people have had experience with one term of
Mayor Schmitz and can therefore readily forecast
what another term of his administration will be like.
In his first term he has quarreled with some of the
most earnest of those who supported him in his con
test for the place, and. has been something like a
mountebank in office,â at one-time declaring himself
a Republican and desirous of a Republican nomina
tion, at-another time hurrying away from "his offi
cial duties to stump the New York tenderloin for
a Democratic candidate for Congress, and then re
turning home to declare himself once more , the
champion of labor, the foe of Democracy and the an
tagonist of Republicanism.
Back of him, but plainly visible throughout his ad
ministration, has been Abe Rucf, who is perhaps as
good a specimen as could be found in the city of the
type of "workingman" that Schmitz favors. The
charges and y countercharges which the rival factions
of the administration have made against one another
may not all be true, but there has been enough of
double dealing on both sides to make it evident that
neither is devoted to the welfare of the city nor to
the interests of workingmen, but has been animated
solely by a desire to profit by the spoils of office.
The beginning of a new era in San Francisco
calls for the service in municipal office of menlof high
character. ' The Republican convention, which was
thoroughly representative of the rank and file of the
party, nominated men who are representative of the
best elements of our citizenship. A partisan organ
reckless in its, irresponsibility may denounce Repub
lican candidates to-day as it denounced Democratic
candidates a year ago, but fair-minded men are not'
going to be influenced by statements from such
a source. Even were the men whom the yellow or
gan now denounces unknown to the community they
would suffer little beyond a feeling of disgust from
attacks of that kind. It happens, however, that the
Republican ticket is composed of men of high stand
ing and of wide repute in the city, so the voters can
readily understand why the yellow organ now assails
them even as it once assailed Mr. Lane and his col
leagues on the ticket of "McNab, the avowed enemy
of labor."
It is the duty of the progressive men of San Fran
cisco to be on guard at this juncture. We must elect
the right man to every office at stake, and especially
to the office of Mayor. Factional government can
never be good government, and in the present situ
ation neither the Democratic nor the Union Labor,
candidates can even pretend to represent anything
more than a faction. The one way to .assure pros
perity so far as municipal affairs are concerned is
to vote the party of prosperity for Henry J. Crocker
and the whole ticket.
WITH a gaudy inconsistency which is doubts
less as amusing to its editors as to the pub
lic, the organ that, once denounced the
Democratic candidate for Mayor as "McNab's man,"
nearly every other candidate on the Democratic
ticket as a "McNab henchman," and McNab' himself
as an "avowed enemy of labor," is now urging the
election of the whole ticket from top to bottom, on
the ground that the men who compose it are . the
stanch friends of workingmen and' the only possible^
saviors of the city. >. . '

a a Â«^"f HUNDRED yards distant rusty masses of ironstone preceded
â¢ * f I an undulation in the flat country, and toward the base of ope
f| tall block Lord Winstone descried an object which made him
JL ; rub his .eyes . with frank amazement. '
"Near the foot of the rock, his back against it, and shadowed entirely
from the sun's light by a natural grotto in the stone, sat an enormous
man or ape. Its stature was colossal, though smaller by far tlnn
the natives of Mapora had described; its naked body was bright green;
its hands were folded over its breast; its misshaped head was bent for-
ward, and wild, snaky hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly around it.
while pressed upon its crown was a wreath of flowers. '
. "In the midst of this stranee kingdom, silent, motionless and alone,
with uncouth face and distorted limbs, reigned this huze green monster
in mortal shape. .
"Lord Winstone got out his field glasses, without which he never
hunted, and trained them on the grotto. He stared awhile, and thenfiis
breath left his lunes in a sraso of surprise, ai he returned the glasses to
their case and pushed forward."
Without doubt the reader will gasp with equal amazement and no less
- curiosity that such strange things can exist even in the Africa of to-day,
but Eden Philpotts knows absolutely whereof he speaks when he made
the great Elephant Spirit of the Dark Continent one of the big teaturea

mysteryâ and still it glows on with undiminished brightness. It cannot
be destroyed and it cannot be extinguished. Wonderful as is the newly
discovered radium, of which there is less than one pound in the whole

SAN MATEO. Oct. 21.â Negotiations arÂ»
pending for the transfer of the Hotel
Mateo property to a rich syndicate of
capitalists, who will . erect a mammoth
tourist hotel In this city. Two different
parties are trying: to close a deal for the
control of the property, one by purchaae,
the other by lease, both with the avowed
purpose of building a large, modern hotel
without delay.
The property is owned by Mrs. Mary
A. Lee, widow of the late John Lee, and
comprises upward of four acres, lying
within a block of the principal business
street. The improvements include six
cottages and a clubhouse. The price de
manded Is $65,000. It Is the game prop
erty upon which the Hotel Mateo, which
was burned last winter, formerly stood.
Two weeks aco Attorney Edward Gates
of the United Railroads and F. J. Me-
Williams of San Francisco brought Mrs.
Lee a letter from F. J. Chapman, super
intendent of the same company, and ne
gotiations began. While they were yet
under consideration Dr. George Shlels
of San Francisco, representing another
syndicate, announced that he desired to
leaee the property. Mrs. Lee would pre
fer tn lease it on account of her minor
children, but has not yet determined
which offer sha will accept.
If the railway company completes its
deal the management will, it is stated,
erect a hundred-room building to cost not
less than $100,000. On tne other hand, it
Is given out that the Shiels syndicate
will put up a much larger and more pre
tentious building, which will cater to the
wealthy tourist trade only. In either
event it is now conceded that this city
will soon have under way a hotel that
will be commensurate with its growing

Gibson was put on the case on June 12,
and after working on it some time till
Jacob' and' Herman Eppinger were in
dicted by the Grand Jury he went to
Port Costa, where he has spent most of
his time since the indictments were pro
cured. He- haa been constantly there for
the last threo weeks. Gibson says he
has been ably assisted in his work of
unraveling the tangle,' of the firm's af
fairs at Port Costa by Detective Bell of
Morse's agency and Constable Moiles of
that town.
Detective T. B. Gibson has c Aluded
his work at the. warehouses of Epplnger
Bros, at Port Costa and yesterday two
large , cases containing a portion j of the
evidence against Jacob and Herman Ep
pinger. indicted for obtaining money by
false pretenses, were delivered at the
property clerk's office at the Hall of
Justice-
The report of the City Architect for
September was filed and shows that per
mits for 108 new buildings, aggregating
a cost of J7S8.6S0, and for thirty-three al
terations costing SS7.600 were issued. The
fees collected amounted to 11134.
Edward^ J. Coffey was appointed fore
man of street cleaning at $4 per daj: T.
J. Carter, plumber, at $5 per day, and
E. W. Boland. clerk In the architect's
office, at S100 per month.
The acceptance of Cumberland street,
between Guerrero and Dolores, was de
ferred because complaints have been
made regarding the character of the work.
The board overruled a protest against
the building of a sewer in South Park
and Center place on the report of the
City Engineer that the streets named are
public.
The board formally adopted the resolu
tion serving notices on R. Hermann and
the . Presidio Railway Company to re
move within ten days certain obstructions
on Lyon street from Beach street to the
bay. It is the Intention to open Lyon
street along the easterly line of the Pre
sidio and if the obstructions are not re
moved the board will tear them down.
The board adopted the recommendations
of the City Engineer changing grades
along the bay shore route for which a
franchise has been granted to the South
era Pacific Company. The proposed
changes differ in some respects from those
previously filed, owing to a number of
changes in the project which have been
made from time to time. The. streets on
which the grades will be changed Include

The Board of Public A^rks yesterday
decided to communicate with the Board
of Supervisors relative to a "complaint
made by George Renner, manager of the
Draymen's Association, that the United
Railroads is failing to keep In repair its
portion of certain streets adjacent to the
car tracks. Renner alleged that the fol
lowing named streets were in bad condi
tion in the portions along the tracks:
Market street fromJ^^nsome to the fer
ries; Kearny street., from Market to
Broadway; Bush street from Kearnv to
Montgomery avenue; Montgomery avenue
from Washington to Union streets; Sac
ramento street from Sansome to Front.
Loughery's motion that the pound be
intrusted to the Police Department was
seconded by McCleilan, tmt it was de
cided to postpone action until next Wed
nesday at 2 p. m., to give Irwin an op
portunity to submit his financial report.
G. Gunzendorfer, attorney for Irwin, ob
jected to the intention of the Pacific Hu
mane Society to present evidence regard
ing a financial statement to be filed by
the poundkeeper, claiming that sworn
charges had not been made. Branden
stein said that large stock were not be
ing impounded by Irwln and there was
evidence that the pound Is Inadequately
handled.
Wilson objected to the pound being load
ed on the Police Department and It should
be first ascertained if the plan had worked
well in other cities.
John Partridge, president of the Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
aaid he hud no objection to the police
managing the pound, although his society
has offered to resume its former manage
ment of thÂ« pound.
Police Commissioner Howell thought the
department could handle the pound by
placing a ranking officer in charge and
such other men as would be necessary.
Brandenstein held that the Mayor derived
his power to appoint a poundkeeper from
an ordinance of the Board of Supervisors,
which could be rescinded if the board so
decided.
"It strikes me that the pound is a mat
ter for public supervision," eaid Branden
stein. "If it is found that the plan does
not work well other arrangements could
be made."
The joint Supervisors' Committee on
Finance. Streets and Police yesterday con
sidered the 'advisability of taking the
management of the public < pound from
H. O. Irwln, the Mayor's appointee, and
placing it under the control of the Police
Commission.
Chief of PoHce Wittman said he knew
of no objection to the Police Department
taking charge of the public pound, ex
cept that it would entail additional work.
Chairman BrandenÂ»tÂ«in said an additional
appropriation of $6000 yearly would be al
lowed for the purpose.
Mrs. Monsen said she was complimented
by several of the members of the Tuesday
Club on her handling of the subject and
familiarity with Ibsen's leading charac
ters, and she could not understand how
any Â¦ dissatisfaction 6hould be expressed.
Some of the members of the club say
thpre are other members who incline
more to such stories as "Lovey Mary"
a?id, "Mrs. "VViggs of the Cabbage Patch"
than to Ibsen and other deep authors, but
that they should have found out what the
lecture was likely to be before they at
tended. While a number of the club
probably enjoyed the Ibsen readings, It is
said that a majority probably caxe much
more for the talks on Mexico at last
week's meetings, with the refreshments,
such as Tamales and Spanish beans,
which contributed to giving a distinctive
ly. Mexican flavor to the event.

"I am afraid." said one of the members

women of the Tuesday Club, and more
especially tfce newer members, did not
know much about Ibsen, and so were not
in a position to appreciate Mrs. Monsen's

What Powerful Food Can Do.
It ia evidently a scientific and powerful
food that can take confirmed invalids oat

"After doctoring two years for terrible
stomach trouble I concluded that It vras
incurable." says a young woman of Fil-
morf, 11L "I was confined to my rooms
all the. time and expected to be an invalid
the rest of my life, having given up, all
hope of ever being well again, and yet I
recovered entirely and quickly by eating a
few' epoonfuls of Grape-Xuts food every
rfcal in place of the improper food that
Â¦had ruined my stomach.
.âAn aunt recommended this food to me
so highly I finally decided that to be hon-
Yst to myself I should give it a fair trial
and the rt-gult has certainly been marvel-
ous. At the time I began eating Grape-
Nuts I weighed 105 pounds, but now I
weigh 159. a gain of 54 pounds. My
ftnength and activity are wonderful and I
have truly found the way to get well und

body the action of the delicious food

it seems like a miracle." Name given by

Suspend Operations on tho Bam.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. ZL â After having
expended many thousands of dollars in
the construction of a dam "on Lagulnltas
Creek, the Marin County Water Company
has suspended operations. The dam was
situated at a point on the stream several
miles* from San Rafael, and when com
pleted would have cost C5.0CO. Scarcity
of water is attributed as the cause of the
discontinuance of the work.
s. It was subsequently learned that Hop
kins was short in his accounts with Vin
cent, and that when the shortage had
been discovered last Monday Hopkins ac
knowledged the shortage and had made
restitution to the' extent of what money
he had in bank.
Careful search by the police has failed
to reveal the whereabouts of Hopkins,
and while some are Inclined to think' that
he has fled from the city, others are firm
in thpir belief that he brooded over the
knowledge that he had been discovered
taking funds that did not. belong to him
and decided to end his trouble by suicide.
There was another letter instructing the
landlady what to do with his personal ef
fects, and still another directed to Leon
V. Shaw of Vallejo, inclosing his resig
nation as an officer of .the State Chris
tian Endeavor Union.
I SA*** DIEGO, Oct. 21.â Fletcher 9. Hop

Union, being chairman of the department
having, charge of the - work among . the
sailors, is missing under 'circumstances'
that indicate that he may have commit
ted suicide. Tuesday night he said that
he was going to the lodgeroom of the
Odd Fellows to take an additional degree,
but he did not reach there. This morn
ing M. A. Vincent, a groceryman, for
whom Hopkins had been working, found
a letter with $3 in gold In it at the store.
The letter announced that the money was
all that Hopkins had and that it belonged
more to Vincent than to himself. An ex
amination of. Hopkins' room showed that
all of his personal effects were there and
that he had left a note bidding good-by
to his friends and thanking them for past
kindnesses. ,-
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Deceased was a native of Oakland.' aged
23 years. Upon direction of Coroner Le
land the relatives were allowed to remove
the body to an undertaking establishment.
Rose King, a comely colored aomestlc
24 'years of age, in the employ of C. W.
Gould, 1713 Green street, was found life
less in the laundry room of the house yes
terday afternoon. A gas tube, one end of
which was affixed to an open gas jet and
the other in the mouth of the deceased,
testified to tha cause of death. Helen
Gould, a daughter of C. W. Gould, upon
her return from school was unable to
gain an entrance to the bouse and. be
coming alarmed, repaired to her father's
store at 314 Washington street. In com
pany with her parent she returned to tha
house. AfttÂ»r a door had been forcea an
Investigation was made and the body dis
covered. Deceased had been employed by
Mr. Gould for two years, but he is un
able to assign a cause for the rash act.
H. W. Kirske. a friend of the Vogels,
is of the opinion that the dead woman
was slightly demented, as* she had been
acting in a peculiar manner, but this Is
denied bV the husband.
Two women afflicted with suicidal mania
ended their lives yesterday, one by send
ing a bullet into bar brain, the other by
the Inhalation of illuminating gas.
The dead body of Mrs. Lizzie Vogel.
wife of Morris Vogel, a cloak maker, was
found soon after 4 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon bv a driver for Cerclat & Co.'s
French laundry, who called at the house,
70S Gough street, to. deliver a bundle. The
laundryman, receiving no response to re
peated knockinsrs, opened the door and
was horrified to find Mrs. Vogel lying on
a lounge dead, with a gaping bullet ho la
over the right temple. A 3S-caliber re
volver of cheap manufacture was clutched
tightly in her right hand.
The police and Coroner's office were at
once notified and an investigation was
made. The case was clearly one of sui
cide, but a search of the rooms failed to
bring to light any farewell message that
would tend to cast any light on the trag
edy. ,
Morris Vogel, the husband of the dead
woman, who is in the employ of Kragen
& Baumgarten, 463 Mission street, stated
that he had last seen his wife alive at
noon and at that time she seemed to be
content and happy. There were no do
mestic difficulties and the couple dwelt
happily together.

TWO WOMEN END
THEIR EXISTENCE
When Billy Roche, who Is In thla city
with Seiger, beard of the good showing
made by Callaghan he challenged Han-
Ion on his behalf. Callaghan weighs less
than 130 pounds, but he Is willing to fight
Hanlon at that weight.
Although Corbett forced the fighting at
all times, Callahan had the better of the
first four rounds. Corbett had much dif
ficulty In landing. Nearly every tiro* hÂ«
went after Callahan the latter would meet
him with a straight left or a righthand
uppercut. In the third round Callahan
made Corbet t's nose bleed.
There was no choice between tha men
in the fifth round, which was stubbornly
fought. The sixth, however, was all Cor
bett's. Callahan slipped and as ho was
regaining his feet Corbett struck him a
terrific blow on the Jugular, which almost
knocked him out. From then to the end
of the round Corbett rained blows on his
groggy opponent, but failed to knock
him out.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 21. â Champiox
"Young" Corbett and Tim Callahan, tha
latter of this city, fought six rounds to
night at the National Athletic Club, In
which Corbett finally jjot the better of
the go, after a hard contest. The fight
ers were in excellent condition for the
tattle. .
ROBS EMPLOYER
AND IS CAUGHT
Regarding his failure to put â¢ out Joe
Grim recently, lie eaid he knocked him
down, twenty-seven times. He could
have stopped him in the earlier stages of
ithe fight, but let him stay. He was then
Ufraid of hurting his bands, and the bout
went the full six rounds.
He is also casting about for a sparring
partner. If Jack Johnson, ' who fights
â¢McVey on Tuesday, is available he may
secure him.
Bob Fitzslramons, } accompanied by Ws
wife, and 5-year-old daughter, and a big:
white bulldog, arrived /yesterday from
the East. Fitz and . his party are gruests
at the Adams Hoj^t^
The ex-champion- was met by Louis
Metzger, Dick Adams and other friends.
To all of them he expressed the opinion
that he was never in better health, and
that he would round Into form rapidly
wltn training.
"I weigh 177 pounds now." said Fits.
"Gardner and I are to weigh in at 168 at
6 o'clock on the day of our fight. I
could get down fo that weight In two
days, if necessary. I will post my 11000
forfeit with Eddie Graney to-morrow. I
would do so to-night if I knew where he
could be* found. I wanted to fight
Gardner at 158 pounds for the ' middle
weight championship, winner to take all.
but he would not agree to that. I would
have made the weight, although few peo
ple think J could do so." " '
Fitz will decide upon training quarters
to-day.' He favors the ocean beach, and
has two locations In view. One of these
Is Sheehan's.

There was nothing spectacular nor even
interesting in the nine ..slow rounds. A
handful of people gathered on the bleach
ers and shouted words of encouragement
at young McKay. Words do not win ball
games. The young man might have won
but for Truck's two-bagger. At any rate,
Truck fattened his average and also land
ed the game for Mike.
It was "one" on the .boarda.when the
Senators came up for their licks in the
eighth.- Hildebrand got to first on an er
ror and'.Cy Townsend let four bad ones
go by. McLaughlin sacrificed them up
ami Truck landed with his fourth hit for
the dayâ a two-cushion swipe out to leftâ
and both runners scampered In.
The Cripples were right after them in
the same round, but they quit one run to
the bad. O'Hara hit and Mosklman tore
off a double down the left field foul line.
Schwartz filed out to center and O'Hara
beat the throw to the. plate with the last
one for the Cripples. The score:

Nona B, favorite for the first sculling

Henderson had the mount and drew the
calmest water, missing the strong ebb

Miracle, third. . : \
There were nine starters in the five fur
long handicap for two-year-olds, with the
Baldwin pair, Felipe Lugo and Ban
quero, ruling favorite at 7 to, 10.- The for
mer colt picked up 115 pounds and, , with
Lee'on his back, made a runaway race of
it, winning by.half a head In 1:01. Chan
dler landed Annie Marie in the place
nearly a length before Lustig, the
Schreiber entry. The^winner runs like a
youngster of some class. Fox Lane was
pocketed soon after the start, losing all
chance. , . , i
"Big Bill" Knapp cleaned up In the mile

"led for seven-eighths of a mile before

The 7 to 10 favorite, , George Dewey,
moved along in time .to finish second, a
length In' advance of Dwlght Way.
Lester Relff's- turquoise blue and black
cap colors", paraded to advantage for the
first time in the last event. He had en
tered Best Man, and, with L. Spencer up,
the big gelding downed his field quite im
pressively at odds of 2 to 1. In fact.the
ring held almost' every one of the starters
at Â£ or 2^, not an unusual book. Estado
ran second and Marcsa, the 8 to 5 choice,
third. The winner received substantial
backing. - F. E. MULHOLLAND.

"LOS ANGELES, Oot. 21.â It is not diffi
cult to) distinguish ladies' day from ordi
nary racing days at Agricultural Park.
Whenever the gate is free to the fair sex
the crowd resembles a~*Burns handicap
gathering at Ingleslde or' Oakland. De
spite the fact that admission tickets are
freely, distributed, the attendance was
again. light this afternoon'. The sport it
self was about up to the standard set
here,- but two j first choices tacking onto
first money. Rosle Woodburn, a "2 to ,1
favorite, took the" 2:27 trot in a tamely
fought contest waking little interest.
j The Chanslor selling stake 'a^ seven fur
longs, worth $570 to the winner, furnished
a ' mild ' surprise inasmuch . that few
thought E. M.* Brattain would, go the
route. | Grail, racing in the colors of Cae
sar Young, carried the public money at
odds of 6 to 5, and the mare never had a
look in; E. M., Brattain, with the colors
up of Johnny Mellln, didn't pack so much
of the public's wealth. Miracle Ilanfl
Cainbaceres were all well supported. At
the start E. M. Brattain, ridden by Pow
ell, : took the . bit between his teeth and
away he went, half a dozen lengths in
front. He was never pres3ed, scoring by
two lengths from Kenther's Heather
Heath, wretchedly piloted by Kunz. M.
P. Tarpey was third.

CHRONIC SORES
Signs of Polluted Blood.
There is nothing so repulsive looking and disgusting as an old sore.'
You worry over it till the brain grows weary and work with it until the
patience is exhausted, and the very sight of the old festering, sickly looking
place makes' you irritable, despondent and desperate.
A chronic sore is the very best evidence that your blood is in an unhealthy
and impoverished condition, that your constitution is breaking down under
the effects of some serious disorder. The taking of strong medicines, like.
mercury or potash, will sometimes so pollute and vitiate the blood and inw
pair the general system that the merest scratch or bruise results in obstinate
non-healing sores of the most offensive character.
Often an inherited taintbreaks out in frightful eating sores upon the limbs
or face in old age or middle life. a sore refuses to heal the blood
is always at fault, and, while antiseptic "washes, salves, soaps and powders;
can do much to keep down the inflammation and cleanse the sore, it will
never heal permanently till the blood itself has been purified and the deadly
germs and poisons destroyed, and with S. S. S. this can be accomplishedâ -the
*sGa**+ j^^\ X*"^t Pouted blood is purified and invigorated, and when
r#*Â»i| g!g^ fC7Â» "ch.pure blood is again circulating freely, throughout
V^fcw V!V) *k e body the flesh around the old sore begins to take
NZ5j Â£*Â¦Â¦>*/Â£*Â¦Â¦â¢)/ P 1 ?* 1 natural color, the discharge of matter ceases
arid" the place heals over.
S. S. S. is both a blood purifier and tonic that puts your blood in order ;
and at the same time tones up the system and builds up the general health.
If you have a chronic sore , write us. No charge for medical advice.

coarse advice. Despite the uproar, the
Republican candidate for Mayor faced his
audience and commanded attention. As
soon as he began to speak the Schmitz
crowd gave him attention and even those
who were opposed to Mr. Crocker's candi
dacy were forced to applaud. him for his
nranly speech. In part^ Mr. Crocker spoke
as follows: -!*Â¦
This Is a sure sign that there are three can

With all due respect to factional differences;
with all due regard to party feeling, the ele

and mark it well, will be the man whom the
voters have, after a careful consideration, de

the best government. (Applause.)
This Is not going to be any snapshot propo

John F. Merrill, vice president and man
ager fpr the lirm of Holbrook, Merrill &
Stetson, last night gave the following as
his views on the stanch business and
executive ability of Henry J. Crocker:
I am working for Henry J. Crocker with the
utmost faith and belief in his thorough abil
ity as a business man. and one capable ef
handling any municipal office intrusted to
him in an able way. I am sorry that Mr.
Holbrook has just left for home, for I know
that he would be glad to put in a hot shot for
Mr. Crocker, whom all of us are working for
and expect to see elected. If Mr. Wheeler
is going to vote for Lane, and is now support
ing him. which I was not before aware of, he
is the exception in this house. The Crocker
banner flies on all of our buildings and deco
rates, all of our teams. And there are many
other business people near us who feel the
sante way. , In fact. I think ail of the busi
ness men In the city know Henry Crocker as
a business man. and a good, honest one. HIS
father was that before him.
I know nothing of Mr. â¢ Lane, or of his
knowledge or business or municipal affairs,
but of Henry Crockor's ability I do know, and
I thick his experience has been euch aa to
stand him in good stead, when he occupies the
Mayor's chair. Hla record has been a clean
one as a man brought â¢ up among us. and I
happen to know â¢ that he has always had the
city's best Interests very closely at heart.
I know that I would be very willing to
trust my own business affairs with him and I
think many others feel the same way. Mr.
Wheeler U a department manager . for us. and
not the manager of this business, as incor
rectly stated In the Bulletin â but then you
know ivhat the Bulletin is and what it is
doing. I am the manager of this business, and
I will say right here, that as a business man
1 feel we will do the right thing when wÂ«
elect Henry J. Crocker as Mayor.

highest office, spent a lively night last
night. He addressed four different meet
ings, being greeted each time by large
crowds. . *
His first appearance 'was at Apollo Hall,
S10 Pacific street. School Director Alfred
Roncovieri acted as chairman and deliv
ered the opening address. Â«He urged the
voters to vote the straight Labor party
ticket at the coming .election. Several
candidates fcr office made short speeches.
Vlayor Schmitz was given a rousing wel
come and made a short talk. The Mayor
next ' went a) Teutonla Hall at 1322 How
ard street. A large audience of the
Mission voters ~was there to gTeet him.
The greatest meeting , of the evening
was held ; at Saratoga Hall, on Geary

Dillon. -Waiter Holman, ; J. . J. Connolly
and.E. J.Deaver.
.V The "hall was packed and when the
Mayor put'in his appearance the audience
burst into repeated cheers. In part
Schmitz said: *
A man would be very stupid If he could not
read Â¦ the .â¢ significance of- this welcome. It
seems to me very :Â¦ strange that, though every
meeting that I attend is overflowed to the hall
doors, the papers still say that very few voters
turn out to hear me and most fit the audience
is made up of boya. It la also strange, that. we
have no paper in our cause, but the crowds of
people turn out Just the same to hear our can-
Tbe 'people want men of reliability.' men
whom they â¢ can Â¦ trust and - not men of pledge*
who ' accomplish nothing. - I care not Â¦ to have
my name written Â¦ in- the i black â¢ headlines . : of
any paper; ; what I want ' is to have my name
written deep,in>the hearts of the people. : v> Â¦'
Two ' yeara ago they said ! if I.* 1 an unknown

Our next Mayor. Henry J. Crocker (applause),
. a Jast told you that this is his second ap
pe&r&r.ce be: ore this club. We expect to see
our next Mayor at all times, as we know what
ever i.c Ask for within reason we will get.
We know we will always find him In his cham
bers in the new City- Hall.
Now, before we came here to-night every one
of us consulted each other and we advised
each other to consider what Mayer we should
indorse. Well, we came to the cÂ«nclusion that
there is no better man than Henry J. Crocker
end the Mayor to be elected In this city ani
county should be a Republican. (Applause.)
We hava seen what the Bulletin has been
r&ylng about Mr. Crocker; we have also eeen
the attacks in the Examiner, but we pay no
ettesUon to them. We Just remember what
the Republicans have given us tlnce we came
to this city. WÂ« found out that the Republi
cans afways treated us right. We might go to
th* Democrats or the Union Lebcr party and
ask for something and they would say to us,
"We are poor and must make some money
â¢while In offloe," end then wÂ« tare to dig down
in Â©or pockets. Not so with the Republican
party. That party Is responsible and they don't
want our money: they want our rapport. (Ap
plause.) And they want to help us In our
tucinMs interests. (Applause.) We don't
llottbt that all th* other parties will fight es.
Tfeai Is politics and w* have the same thing
In ocr own country. W* &r* citizens and gen
erally rtwSj th* situation, and when we prom
ise eaytnlng to any party we generally keep
cur proznls*. Our promise Is our bond. The
reason why we sir* for Henry J. Crocker for
Mayor Is because he will appreciate cur sup
port and he 1* a representative of the Repub
lican party. (Great applause.)
Mr. Crocker "was compelled to take

CHEEES FOB LANE.
Democratic Candidate for Mayor Ad-
dresses Two Good Audiences.
Franklin K. Lane addressed two large
audtagces last night, and was well re
ceived at both meetings.
He spoke first to the voters of the
Forty-fifth Assembly district, at Wash
ington Square Hall, corner of Stockton
and Union streets. H# opened his rÂ«
marks by saying:
I am always glad to address an audience of
workingmen and mechanics because what I
say to them I know they believe. The wagÂ»
earner Is thÂ« man who haa the principal Inter
est at stake In this campaign, and he Is thÂ«
man who 13 the winner when the management
of the municipality Is in/the hands of honest
men. who work hard to 'give an honest inter
pretation to the laws of that municipality.
What you workingmen want Is what you
are entitled to. ajid you want nothing morÂ».
and you want to receive this Justice without
being obliged to bow down to the civil service
commission for It. or to be compelled to put
your hands In your pockets and be forced to
pay for It. Ton may think that It In not pos
sibly for a man In a political position to own
himself, but you are mistaken. I come hero
to talk to you upon the subject of having a
clean government, and tUat Is the platform
on which I stand. If you don't want a clean
government, then I don't want your votes. I
did not seek the nomination to this office. Z
was pressed to take It. and in accepting It
I did not take it with the idea of my own In
terests at heart, but I took it because I want
to try and serve a loyal people, who are striv
ing, aiming and lighting to uphold and main
tain a decent, honest, respectable government.
It is not Lane himself you are voting for. it Is
the principle of the true Democracy, the hon
est Democratic principles of Thomas Jeffer
son. I believe, and it shall be my endeavor,
to do the things that the law of this munici
pality says should be done.
Other speeches were made by T. Carey
Friedlander, Judge Cabanlss, John Con
nor, William Broderick, P. J. Curtis, Dr.
Washington Dodge, Edmond Godchaux,
Dr. T. B. W. Leland and M. J. Hynes.
The second meeting Lane attended was
held at Pioneer *Hall, in the Twenty
ninth Assembly district. As he stepped
up ' to the rostrum he took a drink of
water, and in response to an Inquiry from
one of the audience asking why he didn't
have beer, he replied by stating:
We are not buying any' man's vote for a
glass of beer. We appeal to their heads and
not to their palates. I feel very proud of
this great gathering of the worklngmen. and
they certainly look good to me.
The Democrats who deserted our ranks a
few years ago under a false theory and mis
taken ideas are coming back to us In big
numbers. The workingmen who Joined the so
called Union Labor party now realize that he
has been used. Tou may fool him once, but
you can't fool htm a second time. I am ap
pealing to the intelligence of the people, not
to any prejudice of any section, whether the
man resides north or south of Market street.
The people now demand a pure and clean
government. This curious cosmopolitan place
is a great city, and it is going to be a greater
city one of the most foremost in the world;
foremost because It is the first city to abso
lutely shake eft bossism which it shook oft
long before any Eastern city haa dona so. We
want a government where the man in a polit
ical position owns himself, and is his own
boss not a man who when asked a question
doe*' not dare to give an answer until he takes
down the long-distance telephone and Is
obliged to consult with the powers behind the
throne before he dares to give out hlÂ« reply.
We do not want that kind of stuff. We want
thÂ» office of the Mayor. In the City Hall to bÂ«
open to the adjustment and consideration of
every man. whether he be the mechanic, the
laborer the lawyer the business man or the
banker- to be open to every loyal, honest cit
izen of this great commonwealth.

| jj rang in his ears. He started early
H last evening' to address the voters
If of the city and before midnight he
had delivered half a dozen speeches and
was ready tor more. As a campaigner
Mr. Crocker has few equals. His smiling
face and modest bearing von him, many
votes last night. He met with one rebuff
and that was over in the Thirty-second
District. Mayor Schmlte had many pym
patUzers In the hall and they did their
utmost to break up the meeting. Small
boy* were in the majority and they Â¦were
aided by hoodlums. * However, during
Mr. Crocker's speech he was given earnes t
attention. The fact that there were peo
ple In the house opposed to his candidacy
spurred him. to renewed endeavors. Zie
delivered -a manly talk and even those
that wer* there to cheer for the labor
candidate applauded him.
At other meetings he was accorded the
closes^ attention and was received with
enthusiasm. Mr. Crocker is well satisfied
â¢with the apj>earance of his fight and Is
confident that he will be elected by an
overwhelming majority.
Young Men's Christian Association Hall,
on Mission street,' last night in the course
of his strenuous campaigning, he found a
]<irgo audience awaiting him. The mo
mc-nt he appeared in the doorway he was
greeted with applause. He had to force
his way through the compact throng,
siul when he took his seat on the plat
form the chet-rlng was renewed. Assem
b:j-man 'E. D. Knight presided. He intro
duced Judge Bahrs, candidate for Asses
sor, ard the Judge made his apologies for
not epfaklng, as his voice was too weak.
His son did the talking, and won many
v.otts for his father. William K. Lutz,
candidate for Public Administrator, im
presred Upon his auditors the necessity
of electing an upright citizen. He said
he ccul(? not sing a laughing song and
vas no comedian, but he was a veteran
of the War of the Rebellion and had lived
In this community for many years. Judge
Joachimson. candidate for Police Judge;
Fred Eggers, candidate for Supervisor,
and numerous other candidates addresse*
the big meeting. -~ Â¦;
John S. Partridge appealed to the citi
zens of the Thirty-fifth Assembly Dis
trict to stand by the Republican ticket. In
the course of his speech he said:
"Fully five thousand nun, members of
the Building Trades, have announced
themselves for Henry J. Croker. (Ap
plause.) Gentlemen, we .all ought to be
for Crocker. Mtn who 'toll with their
hands, think with their head, they know
that the national administration has
given them prosperity, and that same
party should be given a chance to show
that it can do the same thing in munici
pal affairs."
Henry J. Crocker was given a hearty
greeting when he was Introduced. Some
boys In the gallery attempted to interrupt
him, but the candidate for Mayor good
naturedly appealed to them to keep quiet,
and in an instant the hall was hushed,
only to echo again with applause for Mr.
Crocker. He said in cart: .
i*\< wili have t0 a PÂ°lÂ°*ize a little to-night,
i&uief. ana rwitUmen. lor my late arrival. I
nave been campaigning to-night and have ad
o^Tl t nu . mber o* rnÂ«tlngs. I promised to
appear at all the meetings, and I am keeping
tn<it r>rc?r.i*e. | am neVrr irt a hurry. I ai
ways try to take my time and always try to
be right before I go ahead. That is thÂ« rule
I want to follow in this campaign.
I have heard what your chairman has said,
irat victory seems to b* coining our way. But
gentlemen, let me impress upon you that now
is the time for you to take on" your coats and
work for the ticket. I know this from expe
rience. I have had much experience as a
w heel horse but never as a leader. So I say
take oft your coats and work hard. That Is
Mnat I am goinj to do. As I said last night,
when told by one of the speakers that victory
wag certainly ours. I was sorry, because I
had rot yet begun to fight. We are going to
win this year because we have a united Re
publican party behind us. This is a good sign
and means a great deal to the party, as next
year we will have a national fight and I am
cure we will achieve another great victory.
I know this, gentlemen, because I went down
to-day among the glass works and factories
and found that the men were earning good,
legitimate wages, and they are .looking with
earn>st Interest to the proposition that con
fronts San- Francisco.- . " >.-v-.--j
We propose, to beautify our city and as long
as tome of the appropriations are a. long
tlma in coming to San Francisco, thia city
proposes, to do the work hÂ«rse!f..-;and. she pro
poses to do the work in the most legitimate
manner possible. And what Is" the. result?
Every thinking voter, no matter what his pol
itics ace, no matter what his situation is In
life, no matter what his condition Is, must
think dwply on what Is before us the next
two years. \ â¢ J
I don't desire to be egotistical and I don't
want to inject my personality into this fight,
but It Is the wish of the people to elect a
man whose word has never been questioned;
whofe integrity has never been in doubt even
by the opposition. If I am elected to this
great office, and you must remember that this
is the most important position within the gift
of the people, and It is no matter to be trifled
with. I will do my whole duty to the people
who elect me.
I can take that offlcc above party lines. I
havs no strings on me. no political boss to
control me. and I can give all of my time
and attention to civic duties. (Applause.)
In the Old World, and especially In Ger
many, it Is ' compulsory for a man to give
three yean of his life to the German army.
Thea Trhy should It not be possible for a
man to do the same thing for his own city?
It was here that I earned my money; all my
Interests are here, and I feel that 1 can give
two years of my life in advancing this city.
I know there are many grave questions con
fronting the. city. There is a great deal to
be said about the cotnm' â¢ ""oners to be ap
pointed. It Is almost lip^-'tble to tell what
a man can do. but if I /a. 1 .ace this audience
and tell you that I wLi do the very best I
can and do It with the men who. If elected,
will back me up, you should be satisfied. You
would not have a man make any pledges other
than I have made to you. I thank you for
your kind attention. (Great applause.) â¢ .
There were more speeches and Mr.
Crocker took his leave amid the cheers
of the crowd.
After winning over the voters of the
Mission, Mr. Crocker came down town
and addressed the retail fruit dealers, who
held a meeting in the basement of Pio
neer Hall. Upstairs the Democrats were
holding a rally and by mistake Mr. Crock
er entered while his opponent was talk
ing. He was recognized by a friend, who
said: "Mr. Crocker, this is no place for
you," and he instantly replied that it was,
as he had a right to listen to what his
friends on the other Bide had to say in
support of their candidacy. He then went
downstairs and the cheers that greeted
him must have caused the Democrats
above to wonder whether the roof was
falling in.
"While waiting for Mr. Crocker's appear
ance Julius Kahn spoke in his behalf. In
part' the Congressman said:
I know Henry J. Crocker. I know him to be
a decent, honest and honorable man. T know
that every one of you Â¦ can receive fair and
Just treatment from him. A good many people
have an idea tÂ»\at because Mr. Crocker has
means he la an aristocrat. That Is not so. He
is one of the plain people. Any man can ap
proach him. You need not be afraid to go up
to him and extend the "glad hand" to him.
lie U always glad to see his constituents.
H* has a warm heart and a kind word for
the people. â¢ He la in every sense of the wora
"all right." (Applause.) I feel satisfied that
pn the 8d of .November men like yourselves,
/who have the Interests of this community at
'heart, who have little stores, who want to
tee San Francisco prosperous, who want to
tee thft city advance and Improve, will go to
the polls and vote for the man who will give
to the people of San Francisco a good, honest,
t-.zrlffts and faithful administration.* (Great
applause and cheers for Henry J. Crocker.)
Mr. Crocker was introduced at this
juncture and said a few words to the as
semblage. He spoke aa follows:
I want tÂ» thank you for waiting a few
minutes for me. I want to thank you. for I
know you are among my enthusiastic friends
on the other side of the city. I want to thank
the people for the reception I have had and I
wantTtosay that if I am elected I will do the
best I can fcr the city. San Francisco is my
home. Baa Francisco is rrowlnr. Ban Fran
cisco has given me a great deal, and I pro
pose. If elected, to give the next two years of

applause.) Â¦ .
Cheers were given for Mr. Crocker as ne

HENRY J. CROCKER Is everywhere
greeted as the next Mayor of San
Francisco. He Is gaining; so rapidly
In popular favor that the Gavin Mc-
Nab press Is resorting to despicable
and ellly falsehood in efforts to turn
sentiment against him. The Bulletin
claims the distinction of discovering a
business man who is opposed to the elec
tion of Mr. Crocker. Considerable space is
given In that paper to the identification of
the* alleged business man. The voters, with
the assistance of the Bulletin and the city
directory, are able to locate the individual
as a resident of San Francisco, but they
never heard of him prior to this cam
paign. The current of public sentiment is
strongly In favor of Ur. Crocker. The
tide in his favor comes at the right time
âtwelve days before the election. Lane
is gaining some recruits from the Schmltz
camp, but all his efforts to break the
solid Republican column have failed,
fact. Lane's supporters are gloomy and
despondent. The candidate himself wants
the contest settled by arbitration rather
than by popular election. "^SpM
SCHMITZ MONEY IS PLENTY.
Schmitz's manager is spending money
like a drunken sailor. It is estimated by
careful observers that the sum- of $25,000
has already been expended in 'this cam
paign In behalf of .Schmitz's candldaey
for re-election. Schmitz could not afford
to give a dollar in aid of the campaign
for the bonds, but he has money galore
for his own electioneering. Everywhere
one hears the remark: "Where does Ruef
get all the money that he Is putting into
the fight for Schmitz?"

The first serious setback, however, was
encountered off the river Platte, where

straits, having lost her maintopmast
and carried away her foremast near the
deck. The Alice Marie had all she could
do to take care of herself and was un
able to render any assistance. To Cap

Harriman was complacent so long as
Santa Ana was the only point beyond the
bounds aimed at by the Huntlngton-Hell
man syndicate, but then came Riverside,
Redlands, Pomona and Santa Barbara al
most certain. The Santa Fe people found
their famous kite-shaped track threatened
by. the inroad of the electric lines, and it
was next to officially given out that San
Diego would ere long be hitched to the
interurban system. . .
The j Ventura-Bakersfield Electric and
Steam enterprise is a Southern Pacific
move, and may yet become the weapon
with which Harriman hopes to bring
JIuntlrigton to terms.
. Differences over the entrance to San
Pedro and the harbor front there were
amicably adjusted, and it was thought
then that the millionaires had had their
tilt and were satisfied for the future to
divide with each other and share alike.
Then came the talk about beyond the
county extensions -of the electric roads.'
and soon following them' the other rumor
that the Southern Pacific had in mind the
electrizing of its Santa Monica line, re
building of the long wharf, and that its
Monrovia. line might be fitted with over
head wires and made to carry electric as
well as steam cars. So it is said the Hunt
ington-Harriman peace is not permanent.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â The announced
purpose of Henry E. Huntington to ex
tend the Pacific Electric Railway system
to points beyond the limits of Los An
geles County Is equivalent to another
declaration of war on the E. H. Harri
man-Southern Pacific Interests, if not the
Santa Fe as well, and the assertion is
made in railroad and financial circles that
the one, if not both, railroad interests
have signified their readiness for a con
flict. ,

sleeping cars via Salt Lake City and the Denver & Rio Grande Railway to â Denver, and the Burling- jj
â¢ton Route to Omaha, Chicago and Boston. Stops for sight-seeing will be made at Salt Lake City and jjj
Denver. The stop at Salt Lake City wilhbe sufficient to see all of the many interesting sights. If
If you want to "see the country" oifyour way East this is the excursion to join. It i3 personally con- |j
ducted, being in charge of one of -the Burlington's most experienced men. He has made the overland i J
journey a score of times or more, is familiar with all the points of interest along the line and is qualified
to give passengers a great deal of useful and reliable information, besides being of great assistance |j
in other ways. â¢. Ladies traveling alone or with children will especially appreciate this feature. i j

CHICAGO, Oct. 21. â There was good demand
from commission houses for both December
and May wheat early In the session and with
offerings quite light the market took on a
strong tone, December advancing, to 81c after
opening a shade to %S%c higher -at 8O-8TÂ®
80%c. The rally was helped, by the firm out
side markets and by reports from the North
west of a big business there yesterday for
shipments EaÂ«t, together with a fair export
business reported at New York. Shorts cov
ered freely near the early hours and prices
held strong until toward noon, when 1 * reversal
of sentiment occurred. Several prominent com-*
mission houses were liberal sellers during the
latter part of the day and tht-ir action was fol
lowed by many pit traders j who were influ
enced by the prospects of increased receipts in
the Northwest with a lessening of the cash
premiums The market was weak late In the
day December selling down to 80c and closing
at 86%c. a low of %@%c.
forn ruled fairly but trading was
Ilpht and mostly for local account. After sell
ing between 43%Â©43%ck and 44c, December
closed %c hlgner at 43%e. -.
There was a good general demand for both
December and May oats, and the market held
firm the entire session. December closing up
%c at 35%e. after ranging between 35@35?6c.
Proxisions were firm early on covering of
shorts In lard, supposed to be for foreign ac
count and an improved cash demand from
shippers. Realizing by local longs and selling
by smaller packers caused a loss of the open
ing firmness, and the market closed steady,
pork 5C lower, January lard unchanged and
rib* 5c hljher.
The leading future* ranged as follows:

Some descriptions of fruit arrived rather late
In the day. having been delayed by the fofr,
but the. market was amply supplied with most
kinds and prices showed but slight variation.
Table Grapes in crates were easy, there being
no inquiry for shipping, while small boxes were
firmer under light receipt*. The previous high
prices of large open boxes drew in large sup
plies, and as a result the market weakened.
Some special lots of the Muscat variety sold
at $1 60. but the general run of offerings sold
within the quoted range. The quotations for
Wine Grapes were obtained only in a small
way for strictly fancy stock. Poor quality of
ferings of Zlnfandel, which constituted the
bulk of the receipts, were offering at $15^16
per ton. TnÂ« . Apple market was quiet, but
prices were unchanared. The market was over
loaded with poor stock, which lessened the sale
of the better grades. A small conslsn.ment of
Peaches in carriers was received from Santa
Clara. , The fruit was of good quality and
sold well at $1 25 per box. The other tree
fruits stood about the tame as previously
quoted. Melons were dull owing to the cool
weather, and large lines of poor Nutmegs werÂ«
offering below the quoted rates, with few
takers. - â¢>

Report of Raisir: Crop of Smyrna
NEW YORK. Oct. 2Lâ The news before the
eper.ing of the stock market to-day of the sus
pension of the Federal National Bank of Pitts
burg caused fears . of a violent break in the
market. There were, some heavy offerings Just
at the opening In some of the leading stocks,
and declines rtn to a point in a few cases.
Pressure wan severe upon United States Steel
preferred, causing a loss of Ihi-volats. Fears
I for the result in th<? market were the ! more
acute owing to the part played in yesterday's
considerable recovery by the published a*sur
ancc-s that the Federal National Bank was not
in need of assistance. It was believed, there
fore, that the threatened institution had weath
ered the gtorm. The news this morning- caused
hssty measures for supporting prices this morn
ing. The effmiveness of these became very
promptly manifested, but the recovery was
viewed with somo suspicion, owing to the be
lief In the artificial nature of thÂ« demand.
Thote on the floor were surprised at the ease
with which th<? decline was checked, and it
was Â»>asy to perceive that offerings of stocks
In th<Â» market were very light. The buying
was thereupon renewed with vigor and the
market carried upward quite comprehensively
to the extent of a |x>int or more. Prices re
tracted their course during th^ latter part of
th<? day and the closing was rather easy and at
net dec-lines for the day. except whVre the early
gains had been above the average.- The laie
downward movement was not fully explained by
ar.y published dpvelopments. The demand Trom
ehorU was- satisfied to some extent. on the ad
vance, thus subtracting from the support of
the market. Pome fears were entertained that
there might be a new factor In the Pittsburg
trouble, carried over to-day by reason of the
decision of the banks not to call maturing
loans there and other measures of precaution.
The cause assigned by small banks which had
bÂ»en offered a high rate of interest by the
failed bank to attract those deposits was a re
sult from a condition known to have become
sufficiently cÂ«neral to become the subject of
widespread criticism.
Notwithstanding the late reaction In the mar
ket. Its tone was accepted as rather convincing
evidenr* O f a measurable restoration of con
fidence, in view of the factor* to be contended
with. To thÂ«uÂ» must bÂ« added the threatening
aspect of Isbor conditions with the Manhattan
Eleveted. The market <Ji<i not take well to

collieries will close for about a week, owing
to the quick succession of holidays within that

A dismissal of the suit for divorce
brought by pretty 19-year-old Marguerite
Heck Mackintosh against \ Charles J.
Mackintosh, chief engineer of the ferry
steamer San Jose, was filed yesterday. A
few minutes later Attorney Stephen V.
Costello, on behalf of the young lady, filed
a new action, in which the charges of
cruelty preferred In the first action are
repeated. In explanation, Attorney Cos
tello said that the 'couple had become
reconciled through the efforts of friends
a few days after the first action, had been
commenced, hence the dismissal of the
suit. The filing of the new action. It is
charged, was due to the fact that Mackin
tosh did not keep his promise to behave,
and a few days after they made up he
again abused his wife. . '
Mrs. Mackintosh has had a merry time
of it since her graduation from a private
school in San Jose In May of la%t year,
and If her statements be true her troubles
are due to Mackintosh, j Ha was chief en
gineer on a vessel plying between this
port and Seattle. After graduating, Mar-,
guerlte Heck, one of the most popular
and beautiful pupils at tho San Jose
school, took a trip to Seattle. She sailed
on the steamer on which Mackintosh was
engineer, met him and straightway fell
in love with him. Her charms won
Mackintosh, and when the steamer stop
ped at Seattle they hied themselves to a
minister and became one. Their happiness
was short-lived, for, according to the
young wife's 'suit, he commenced abusing
her within a few weeks after the mar
riage. She stood his alleged abuse until
October of this year, when she left him
and returned to her mother. Ten days
ago she filed an action for divorce, and
also asked for a restraining: order "pre
venting him from interfering with her
peace, alleging that he had called at .the
home of her mother and threatened her.
It is now said that the day following the
filing of the suit Mackintosh, appealed to
her to return to him, promising to treat
her differently. He said that because of
the suit he had beÂ«n ostracized by his
friends and was in danger of losing his
position. His friends also importuned her
on his behalf, and, much against her
wishes, she consented to return, only to
find that they could not agree.

George W^ Rumble, the wildcat mining
operator, arrested for fraudulently using?
the mails, will be taken before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock next
Tuesday morning at 10 -o'clock for pre-.
limlnary examination. The more the
postal authorities have delved into the
history of his transactions the more they
find concerning the enormous profits real
ized by him oat of his swindling schemes.
Exceeding simplicity and plausibility
marked his plan, and nothing could have
prevented his swindling the public until
the crack of doom had it not been for the
Interference of the postoffice people and
the revelations made by his arrest and
expected to be made in the progress of
his trial.
Postoffice Inspector James O'Connell
had been on the trail of Rumble for a
year in gathering evidence and preparing
a "case" that would insure the conviction
of the bunko operator. He found that
whenever Rumble wanted to "work" a
particular locality for purchasers of his
worthless mining stock he used to remit
to his victims (2 each month as a dividend
on each $100 invested. By peddling out the
money In this way he could keep himself
solvent and could continue the payment
of dividends for four years and two
months before the original $100 received
by him had bÂ«n disbursed in dividends.
Like the $35 suit clubs that went to pieces
several years ago, the profit came in with
the "new blood," or new victims. 'But
Rumble did not adhere to this business
like plan. He used to pay the dividends
regularly for several months, and then
endeavor to induce his victims to allow
the dividends to be applied to the pur
chase of additional stock, on the assump
tion that the more profitable an Invest
ment Is the more money should be put
Into it. '
As an evidence of the profitable nature
â¢of the business to Rumble, Inspector
O'Connell cites the fact that out of the
city of Elmlra, N. Y., alone since last
June Rumble has received J52.0CO In gold
coin from the sale of his wildcat stock.

and Dr. I* D. Baclgalupi, autopsy sur
geon. ' The Rev. Father Robert F. Sesnon

lamp herself. The case will be concluded
this morning.
RUMBLE WORKS
POCKET MINES
1 In the United States Circuit Court yes
terday morning the taking of testimony
in the case of Patrick W. Riordan, Arch
bishop of : San 'Francisco, against Mrs.
Belle "W7 Sprague and Richard SpraguÂ«,
her husband, was begun. The day's ses
sion was devoted to the exploitation of
two documents of vital Importance In the
trial. One of them was what is known
as the fountain agreement and the other
the community property agreement. Ry
land ,T. 1 Wallace, Mrs. Sprague and Qar
rot McEnerney were examir.e-1 on behaK
of the plaintlft^with reference to these
two documents and the circumstances un
der which they had been executed.
It appeared that James Mervyn Dona
hue had bequeathed a large sum of money
to various charitable organizations of the
various creeds, and that in order to avoid
coming into conflict with the law prohib
iting, the bequest of more than one-third
of j an estate to any religious denomina
tions the fountain agreement was ex
ecuted by Ryland T. Wallace and Arch
bishop Riordan to the effect that if the
courts should adjudge that the $25,000 leg
acy for the Donahue fountain on Market
street was a charitable donation so that it
might cut into the. bequests left the Ro
man Catholic organizations,' Mrs. Sprague
would -make up -any deficiency In the
Catholic bequest that' might be created
thereby. , . Â¦ -,
Ryland T. Wallace, brother of Mrs.
Sprague, testified that at the time, he
made the fountain agreement he was not
acting within the scope,' of the power of
attorney, held by him from Mrs. Sprague
while she was absent in Europe, and that
therefore It should not be considered as
her act. It was alleged further. by. the de
fendants that there was no consideration
for that agreement and that it was void
for that reason. The community Agree
ment provided that both Mrs. Sprague
and tlie Archbishop should consider two
thirds of the whole estate us community
property and the remaining one-tnlrd os
t^z soj trate estate of the tsa'Ator, James
Mervyn Donahue. - 1 ' â¢ -
It appears that In the distribution of the
bequests heretofore had the Protestant
charities received the whole amount of
the bequests, thus leaving a large de
ficiency In the bequests for the Roman
Catholic institutions, and this appears to
be one of. the pivotal factors in the pres
ent litigation.
