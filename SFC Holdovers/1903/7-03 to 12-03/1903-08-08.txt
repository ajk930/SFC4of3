;At 2 o'clock this morning detectives set
out In small .boats, and with the aid of
lanterns peered beneath the wharves, as
it was considered probable that he had
taken advantage of this opportunity ' to
evade his pursuers.
Another rumor spread that
Howard had been seen in the city and
during the night had dodged down East
street, where he was soon lost to view.
The police were sent also to make in
vestigation in the neighborhood, but
found no tangible proof of thÂ© presence
of the escape.
Duke immediately <y>mmunicated with
the Central station and a number of, de

for the suspect At an" early hour this
morning the police were scouring, the vi

been seen and also all along the water

visited, the detectives making a thorough
search.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 7.
â Detective Max P.
Fisher met Convict Fa
hey face to face to-night
and a recognition was exchanged.
Before 'the detective could draw
his revolver from his pocket Fa
hey cohered him with a pistol, and
with an oath commanded him to
throw up his hands. Fahey es
caped, but not until the detective
had fired five shots at him. A man
who the detective believes was
Convict Miller was with Fahey;
and escaped also.
At midnight Chief Sullivan and
Detectives Fisher and Fitzgerald
and. Deputy Sheriff Wittenbrock
left the city in carriages for a
point near the American River
bridge, where they will search for
Fahey and the man believed to be
Miller. Fisher in his exciting en
counter flashed his snap light
full in the face of Fahey, and rec
ognized him as the man sent up for
a long term in the Folsom peniten
tiary from Sacramento. The de
tective also fully * recognized the
voice as that of \Fahey.
Circumstances of a convincing
nature led the officers to believe
that Fahey and Miller came to
Sacramento before daybreak this
morning in a cart stolen from
Charles Darling, a resident of the
neighborhood of Alder Creek, be
low Folsom. A man was held up
at an early morning hour within
the city limits by two men, one of
whom carried a revolver, and
his pockets rifled. This act -was
also credited to the two escaped
convicts.
East of the passenger depot is a
large lumber pile, braced up by
heavy pillars, which form an abut
ment reaching within a foot of the
track on which to-night stood
some freight cars, waiting to be
picked up by a late train for Ore
gon. The space which intervenes
between these pillars forms a
refuge which tramps frequent
when they desire to board a train
moving out of. the depot.
Detective Fisher believed Fa
hey, who for many years lived in
Sacramento, would select this
j)lace if he intended to board a
night train and elude the officers,
who have been scouring the local
ity for him to-day. In company
with Deputy Sheriff Wittenbrock
Detective Fisher to-night visited
the gloomy spot in the railroad
yards. On one side of the narrow
passageway loomed the lumber
piles; on the other stood the
freight cars, while the passage was
blocked by the pillars to such an
extent that a man had to -squeeze
his way past them fronibne open
space into the other.
Fisher got into the first space and
tripped over a man who had sprawled
there. He pulled his pocket light and
sent Its rays piercing into the space di
vided by the next pillar. As he did so
he saw the face and form of Fahey In
the shadow of the pillar and he could
detect a man beyond him, whom he is
certain was convict Miller. Tho latter
shouted to Fahey: "Watch out. that's
Fisher."
But Fahey needed no warnlnj. In an
instant he had a revolver leveled at
Fisher and from his set lips came hissing
tho order, coupled with a foul epithet,
"Throw up your hands."
Fisher's answer was to reach for his
ff~*\ AVISVILLE, Aug. 7.
B \ B â An unidentified man
ja yj? was killed near here
*^^^ about 3 :3O o'clock this
afternoon ; by Constable Hainline
and Deputy Sheriff Johnson, who
supposed that he was Howard, the
escaped convict. The testimony
taken at the Coroner's inquest to
night shows that the man's death
was due to his own folly, as he
was repeatedly commanded to
halt before the fatal shot was fired.
For two days the whole country
has been on the alert for Howard,
who is supposed to be in hiding
along Putali Creek or near the old
canal.. \ About -noon to-day a
stranger called at the farm, of F.
W.- Palmer, three miles .west of
Davisville. He asked' for lunch
and "was: given something, to eat.
He inquired about the crops, and
also asked the way to Sacramento..
\Vlieir th'rouglV \ eating".- lunch. . he
walked- off hurriedly; but in a di
rection < opposite to. Sacramento.
The appearance and action of- the
man were such as to arouse the
suspicion of Palmer, and as soon
as the suspect was out of sight
Palmer called up Constable Hain
line and notified him of the inci
dents.' The closely clipped hair
and short, v stubby beard of the
stranger indicated that he might
be^Howard.
Constable Hainline consulted
with Deputy Sheriff Johnson, and
they decided to investigate. They
drove out to Palmer's house and
learned wliat he knew about the
man. They then drove up the
creek about a mile and tied their
horse to a tree.
..They soon found the trail of
the man and saw by tracks^in the
muddy bankg where he had en
tered the creek. After^ following
the creek a short distance, and
just as they were about to reach a
bend, they heard a shot a short
distance away. Johnson remarked,
"Is the fellow shooting at us?"
Hainline replied, "I guess he is
shooting fish."
Just about that time the officers
came in sight of the suspect. He
was naked and in about two feet
of water, and was .apparently tak
ingia bath. He held something in
his hand, which the. officers took
for a pistol. They werethen about
three hundred yards away, and
Deputy Johnson suggested that, as
he was only armed Â¦ with Â¦' a re
volver, they make an effort to
get closer to him.
* The officers walked very, fast
until they were within 200 yards
of him. They then shouted to Him
to drop his hands and that they
were officers. Instead of dojng so
lie started to run. The officers
pursued for fifty yards, both of
them continuously commanding
him to halt. He was .traveling in
the direction of a clump of wil
lows, where the officers suspected
that heVhad a rifle concealed. Both
officers were armed with rifles and
they fired. Only one shot took ef
fect. A bullet passed through the
fleshy part, of the :* suspect's ieft
arm. Whatever he \ was holding
in .his hand he dropped in the
A T 3 o'clock this morning
Xj| a man supposed to be the
J &' escaped convict Howard
was arrested and placed
in the "tanks" of the City Prison.
The arrest was made during an
exciting search of the water front
by the police, acting upon informa
tion received that Howard had
eluded his pursuers in the interior
and was well on his way toward
this city. Whether or not the sus
pect is the much-wanted convict
will be established to-day when
his photograph and measurements
under the Bertillon system will be
available.

they reached there a shot was fired at
them from the McClellan place. This

claimed the shooting was done at. a target
without knowledge of the presence of the

when they went to the creek to swim;
that Howard was sent for a gun, which
was given to Martine, and that George

POWER COMPANY CEASES
OPERATIONS IN HUMBOLDT
Project Is Abandoned Because of an
Insufficiency of Water in the
Van Duzen River. *
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 7.â The Humboldt
Light and Power Company, whicu was in
corporated a few months ago for the pur
pose of taking power frcm the Van Duzen
River at Brldgeville, Humboldt County,
with which to supply the various towns in
that vicinity with lighting and motive
power, has ceased operations. The com
pany, after finking considerable money
in the enterprise, has now abandoned the
project. The reason advanced for the
abandonment of the project is an insuf
riency of water in the Van Duzen River.
Previous estimate* of the quantity of
v.-ater at hand were deemed satisfactory.
There was a considerable quantity of
lumber, â¢ which had been hauled to the
scene of operations to be used in con
struction, and this has been sold to pri
vate parties.

GETS HER GOLD
BAG ANARCHIST
FOR EXTORTION
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7.â At 1:06 o'clock
thJs afternoon the special train bearing
Henry P. Lowe drew in at La Grande
station, having completed a run from
the Atlantic to. the. Pacific Coast, a
distance of more than 3200 miles, In
the fastest time on record. Mr. Lowe
left New York Tuesday. August 4, at 2:33
p. m., and arrived in this city 70 hours
and "1 minutes later, or an hour and thir
ty-nine minutes-less than three days. The
run from Chicago was made over the lines
of the Santa Fe, a distance of 2256 miles.
The time from Chicago to Los Angeles
was 52 hours and 51 minutes, an average
speed of 42.7 miles an hour, including all
stops. This run clipped seven hours and
live minutes off all previous records. .
The record breaking run finished by. Lowe
was undertaken with _the object of .reach
ing the bedside of his little 11-year-old
daughter, who was lying seriously ill
in this city. The child died early Tues
day morning;, but Mr. Lowe was not ad
vised of her death until well on his
way. As all arrangements had been
lr.ade for the special train and schedules
prepared for by the railroad the trip was
continued as originally planned, except
that it was made in ten hours' less time
than scheduled from Chicago to Los An
geles. â¢ Â¦/.Â¦
SCHEDULE BEATEN.
When the Santa Fe special left Chicago
om Wednesday at 10:15 a. m. it was intend
ed that the run to Los Angeles should be
made at a speed of 35 miles per hour-in
cluding stops. As the train passed
through Missouri and Kansas it was
found that faster time than the schedule
provided for could be made. Orders were
then given to make as fast time as was
consistent with safety. The special
began to gain at once. At La Junta,
Colorado, it was more than an hour
ahead of its schedule, and when Al
buquerque. N. M., was reached, at 5:45
last evening, this gain had been increased
to 3 hours and 15 minutes. It was then
figured by Santa Fe officials in this city
that if the same rale of gain was main
tained for the remaining nine hundred
miles the train would arrive at Los Ange
les about six o'clock this evening. When
once started across the Arizona desert,
however, all previous records were easily
exceeded and as the train reeled off mile
after mile, hours instead of minutes were
pained. At S:55 this morning, at which
time Seligman. Arizona, was reached,
the flying special was 7 hours and 5 min
utes ahead of schedule. Across the Mo
jave Desert speed was Increased and
Barstow was reached at 9:53 a. m.. 8 hours
and 22 minute3 ahead of time. A stop of
five minutes was made at Barstow in or~
der to change engines. From this point
the train turned south and crossed the
&$n Bernardino range of mountains and
whirled through El Cajon Pass at a ter
rific pace. Reaching San Bernardino 9
hours and 20 minutes ahead of time, the
special had a. clear track t*) Los Angeles,
a distance of 63 miles. The run over thiÂ»
last stretch of track was a record-break
er, the speed at times being as fast as
75 miles an hour. At 1:06 the giant engine
No. W56 whirled into La Grande station
and the journey was completed."
CROWD SEES FINISH. â¢
A large crowd bad gathered to witness
the finish of the most remarkable journey
in the history of American railroads.
Lowe entered a carriage that was in wait
ing and was rapidly driven to the West
minster Hotel, where he joined his wife,
who has been prostrated since the death
of her child.
The. previous record for a transconti
nental run was made by C. R. Peacock,
a director of the United States Steel Cor
poration. On March 27, 1IKC1, Peacock rn-
EaRed a special train to carry him to At
lantic City. N. J., # where a special meet
ing of the directors of the Steel Corpora
tion was- to take place in four days. The
run from Los Angeles to Chicago over
the Santa Fe railroad was made In 57
hours 56 minuter. This record, which was
then thought to be a remarkable one.
stood until to-day, when it was excelled
by the Lowe special by four hours and 56
minute}!.
Lowo was seÂ«Â»n at the Westminster
Hotel to-night. He was in an extremely
nervous state and was not disposed to
discus? his" record breaking run across the
continent. He first saidjhe had not re
ceived word of his child's death until he
reached Los Angelen, but later exhibited
a telegram that had Intercepted him at
La Junta, Colo., apprising him of the sad
happening.
H<Â» took occasion to say that he was not
in any way connected with the United
States Steel Corporation: that he was si
mining man, with a residence in Denver,
and had not at any time been connected
with the steel corporation. He was at a
loss to understand how such a story got
started, and wished to have it corrected.
I/owe said he will not take his daugh
ter's body East, at Ifapt for the present.
"In fact," said he, "w* have made no
plan*. My wife is almost prostrated with
grief, and 1 am not In a condition to say
now what I Intend doing."

Seized for Threats

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 7.â C.
Crelghton, after a month's sojourn in San
Bernardino, left hurriedly yesterday
evening, taking with him $500 belonging
t.6 . Mrs. Amanda Perry, ' a middle-aged
widow. When Crelghton arrived here he
'was flashily clad, wore diamonds, and
talked continually of his * gold mines on
the Colorado desert. He formed the ac
quaintance of Mrs. Perry, and, affecting
to be infatuated with her, proposed mar
riage. She accepted and the two seemed
very devoted. -
Yesterday Creighton- went to Mrs. Perry
in embarrassment, saying that he needed
$500 to close a business venture. His
mines were worth $100,000, but they were
bonded . and he had no ready cash on
hand. He begged a loan for ten days
and Mrs. Perry "favored her loved one
by mortgaging her little home for $500
and giving him the money.
Last night Crelghton disappeared and
there, seems to be no likelihood of his
returning. The officers have been notified
and are doing their best to locate him..
BEATS -PREVIOUS RUNS.
Railroad Officials Say the Special
Made Remarkable Time.
TOPEKA. Kan?.. Aug. 7.â General Pas
senger Agent W. J. Black of the Santa
Fe said to-night regarding the Lowe spe
cial train:
"The Santa Fe has made some notable
runs across the continent in the past few
yeafs. -but the Ix)we special has beaten
all records heretofore made. The Peacock
special in March. 1900, Ijos Angeles to
Chicago, a distance of 2265 miles, was
fifty-seven hours and flfty-slx minutes.
The Nellie. Bly; ppecial in January, 1890,
made the. run from San Francisco to Chi
cago, a distance of 2577 miles, in exactly
sixty-nine hours. At that time this was
considered a remarkable performance.
The Lowe special has clipped five hours
and â¢ seventeen minutes off the record
made by the Peacock special.
"Considering the congested condition
of the railroads generally at this time
and the further fact that the Santa FÂ«
is handling a large movement of G. A. R,
business to Los Angeles and San Francis
co on special trains and extra sections of
regular trains, the record made by the
Lowe special is a remarkable one in every
sense.
"It will be long before any other train
can approach or exceed this record."
Windstorm Hits Tucson.
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 7.â A heavy, rain
storm prevailed here this' evening. It
was preceded by an extraordinarily heavy
wind, .which did considerable damage in
the city. The boys' dormitory at the
University of Arizona, one mile north of
the city, was damaged to the extent of
$2500. The roof was torn off and one wing
blown down. " Two students were in" the
building at the time,, but escaped 'with
slight injuries.
POINT RICHMOND, Aug. Z-PJerre
Debray, the French butler, arrested on
complaint of William .Mlntzer. manager
0 the Tewksbury estate, for an alleged
attempt at extortion of $5000 under threats
to murder the Mintzer family, is, accord
ing to his own confession, an anarchist.
To Constable John Bouquet the young
house servant to-day admitted his al
legiance to the doctrines of destruction
and declared with some bravado that he
followed the principles of the iconoclastic
brotherhood. Debray's admissions .were
the result of questioning by the officers
at Martinez after they had translated
into English a lot of letters found among
Debray's effects. They were written to
him by a brother In France. The mes
sages breathed anarchism so strongly
that the prisoner was Interviewed on the
subject.
"I am wh/t my brother Is," he re
sponded. ..'-,..Â¦'
That satisfied the officers. To make
positive evidence of the similarity of the
lettersâ the one that Mintzer received, in
which the blackmailing demand was
made, and the message Debray, wrote in
reply to the decoyâ they were submitted
to-day to a handwriting expert in San
Francisco. After examination the expert
reported to Constable Bouquet and Mint
zer that the same hand penned both let

style, cut, brand and watermark. De

tenced this afternoon, Martin and Trot
ter to serve thirty days in prison, the
maximum penalty under the law, and
Charles to pay a fine.
Negro Disturbers Sentenced.
According to the prisoner's story, he
started out Saturday night and followed
the South Fork of the American River
and for two days had nothing to eat. He
then ran across a cabin fh the woods and
procured food. He claims he stayed near
the river Monday night, but next day,
Tuesday, forded the stream and hid In
the brush until nightfall. That night, to
use his own words, he "hiked near forty
miles." Undoubtedly much of the time
the prlÂ»caer was out of his bearings and
traveled in a circle. He admitted to the
TRAVELS IN A CIRCLE.
Speaking of Case, who is known to have
been his close companion during his wan
derings, Seavis stoutly maintained that
he had hot seen Case since last Saturday
night at about 10:30 o'clock, or just after
the fight at the Grand Victory mine. Ther
officers believe Seavis Is lying and that
Case was not far off last night
"Guard Klendendorf tried to get aw<y
from me a couple of times," remarked the
negro, "and I told him if he tried it again
I would shoot him."
The midnight train last night had on
board District Attorney Arthur Seymour
and Court Reporter Warren E. Doane of
Sacramento, who had been apprised of
the capture immediately after it took
place. Upon their arrival in Auburn Dis
trict Attorney Seymour proceeded to the
jail, where he had an Interview with
Seavis. Regarding the facts leading up
to the prison outbreak and the conspiracy
growing out of the same, very little in
formation was given out by Seymour as
the result of his Interview with the con
vict, it being his desire, and the desire of
tho officers, to get at the Inside of these
matters as^quietly as possible and with
little publicity at present.
SOBRY HE WAS NOT KILLED.
Seavis talked to a representative of The
Call about his various wanderings. He
stated that he wished Keena and Coan
had shot a little higher up and killed him.
as he preferred death to being returned
to the prison. In conversation with Un
der Sheriff May, Seavis said: "I'm up
against .It; this is my last break; but I will
take my medicine like a man." He seems
to think his fate will be the hangman's
noose. In another part of the conversa
tion Seavis remarked with great disdain,
referring to the first fight: "There was
some poor ! shooting at Pilot Hill. I did
some shooting, but did not hit any one. I
saw the horse fall at Pilot Hill and shot
at a man behind a rock, but I shot too
high. If the men at the prison had had
any nerve there would not have been
anything to it."
The prisoner admitted, after some ques
tioning, that he drew a rifle on the guard
at the outer prison gate. He also ad
mitted that he was one of the first con
victs to enter the armory to procure
weapons. He said he yelled at the guard
to drop his rifle or he would kill him.
Tte guard promptly obeyed.

night after being wounded In both legs
by the shotguns of^ Sheriff Keena and
Deputy Sheriff Lee Coan at the railroad
station, was returned to his old quarters
at Folsom prison this morning. Sheriff
Keena, Under Sheriff Coan. and Sheriff
Mansfield of Ban Mateo County started
for the prison shortly after 8 o'clock In a
surrey: with the negro aboard, safely
handcuffed.
AUBURN, Aug. 7.â Seavis, the no
torious and much sought after
negro convict, who was landed
The report came in here this morning
that five of the convicts had been seen at
Morris Kelly's ranch, between Auburn
and Folsom, but an investigation showed
the story to>c untrue.
Seavis suffered considerable pain during
the night from the shot In his legs. The
pellets were not removed, but the limbs
were dressed by the physicians. This
morning he made no particular complaint
of suffering when he started off for th*
penitentiary.
. It was reported to the officer shortly
after the negro was taken that two small
boys had seen a man hanging around a
pile of railroad ties not far from the spot
where the shooting took place and that
he soon afterward disappeared. It is
possible it was Case, the sick convict,
who has been the close partner of Seavis
all along. As the Reno local passenger
passed through Auburn at 1 o'clock this
morning Dr. J. F. White and Art Smith
noticed a man riding under the trucks. It
is believed that he was one of the con
victs.
During the shooting at the Auburn de
pot Seavis showed a decidedly yellow
streak. It is true he fired three times at
Deputy Coan with a revolver, but when
the officers filled his leg full of buckshot
he squealed and cried for mercy. ThÂ«
crowd that gathered Just after the fusil
lade was qulet'and orderly, but naturally
filled with a great desire to see the noto
rious convict.
SHOWS A YELLOW STREAK.
During a conversation this morning at
the Jail Seavis tried to- convince the offi
cers that he threw his rifle In the Ameri-
Ican River while fording It. His story is
not believed. . It is thought the weapon
will be found in the brush between the
river and Newcastle. . Â«^
officers that he did not know where he
was going. As near as the officers can
learn, as Seavis did not know the names
of the stations along the railroad In this
county, he must have forded the Ameri
can River about opposite Loomis or Pen
ryn Thursday afternoon. He walked
either to Lioomls or Penryn. and about
7:30 p. m. boarded freight No. 214. east
bound. It is known he got oft at New
castle to look around, as the trainmen
saw him standing on the ground close to
one of the cars. Seavis admits that he
did not board the freight for the first time
at Newcastle, but ona or two stations
west. ' ' ' V\\'

A small army of men is now gathering
on the hill, and the watch probably will

jirevaiis that one of the men is Case, who
is an opium fiend, and that he is trying to
get into Chinatown to get some of the
drug. '
The search was continued and several
more shots were fired into the brush, in
which it is thought the men have taken
refuge, but without result.
By this time a score of citizens from
town had gathered on the hill, and again
the fugitives were seen breaking through
the brush at the lower end of the orchard.
Shots were again fired, but all trace of
the men was lost.

men break from the brush and run
through an orchard. The men fired at
the fleeing figures, but did not bring the
runaways down.

Edward W. York died at noon at the
temporary hospital. Fifteen of the in
jured were this afternoon - taken to the
Harper Hospital in Detroit for treatment.
The circus 'people have pitched their
.tents and camped near the scene of the
wreck. The dining-room of. Hotel Riche
lieu was used as an operating room by
the surgeons. A score of wives and
daughters of the residents volunteered
and worked with the surgeons all the
morning. Many of the Injured were fas
tened down in the wreckage so that they
had to be chopped and pried out.
Tho circus travels In two trains of
about fifteen cars each. After last night's
exhibition at Charlotte the two trains
left for Lapeer over the Grand Trunl^,
the second section leaving a half hour
after the. first. It was 3:45 o'clock when
the first section pulled into the west side
of the Grand Trunk yards here. A red
light was hung on the rear car to stop
the second section. Engineer Probst of
Battle Creek, who was running the en
gine of the roar train, says he saw this
light and applied the air brakes. To his
horror they refused to work. He reversed
his engine, hut the' momentum of the
train behind him was too great and with
a crash that aroused all of the town near
the yards the two trains met. .
Fireman Colter and Brakeman Benedict,
when they saw that a collision could not
be averted, jumped. Engineer Probst re
mained at his post, vainly trying to get
the brakes to work until his train wag
within loss than a hundred feet of train
No. 1. Then he, too, jumped when he
was within but a very few seconds of sure
death In the crush. He was shaken up,
as were tho fireman and brakeman, but
not badly. None of the crews of cither
train was hurt.
CARS TELESCOPED.
Three cars of the stationary first sec
tion were telescoped and the engine and
live cars of . the moving train were de
molished. The rear car of the first sec
tion was a caboose, In which the train
men were sleeping, and the next two were
filled with sleeping circus employes. The
greatest loss of life was in the caboose.
One of the wrecked cars of the second
section was occupied by five elephants and
several camels. One of the elephants and
two camels were killed outright, while
the other animals and their trainers
escaped. With tho exception of this car
COLORED MISSIONARY
ROBBED OF COLLECTIONS
Held Up on Railroad Track and Re
lieved of Money Meant to
Convert Heathen.
WOODLAND, Aug. 7.-David Swack
hanner. a colored Baptist missionary, re
ports tha.t he was held up and robbed
by two men on the railroad track about
a mile and a half below Merritt station.
Swackhanner has been engaged In mis
sionary work in Sacramento for two
weeks. On Thursday he left that city.
He was traveling along the railroad and
at the Doint where he was robbed the
county road crosses the railroad.
The two men hailed him. They. . were
dressed in khaki suits, wore leggins and
carried carbine rifles. They wore white
belts, which were filled with cartridges.
One of the men. of dark complexion, was
about 40 years of age. and his' dark mus
tache appeared /to be dyed. The other
was apparently 35 years of age, his hair
was sandy and his face waa clean shaved.
The robbery occurred about 12:30 o'clock.
Mr. Swackhanner was relieved of $9,
which represented his net. collections for
missionary work in Sacramento for two
weeks.
After the robbery the two men left the
road and started across fields in a south
easterly- direction, ranging between Da
visville and Sacramento.
The missionary continued his journey
along the railroad in the direction of
Woodland. After traveling about two
miles he met Under Sheriff Brown and
Deputy Sheriff Griffin, who are out
searching for Howard. He says they
would not believe his story. . ... .
none of the menagerie was wrecked, the
demolished cars containing canvas or
wagons. As soon as they recovered from
the first shock the trainers rushed among
the cages, quieting the animals that were
excited. An elephant in the wrecked car
behaved with surprising calmness and
was led out of the wreck without trouble.
A wrecking crew is kept in the yards
here and It was on the scene In a very
few minutes. All physicians and trained
nurses in the town were sent for and the
Hotel Richelieu was converted into a tem
porary hospital. Scores of volunteers
with stretchers were soon ffi readiness to
carry the injured away us fast as the
rescuers could extricate them. The dead,
many of them so terribly mangled that
identification seemed well-nigh Impossible,
were laid on the ground a short distance
from the scene. By 6 o'clock a corps of
twelve physicians was operating on the
injured and dressing their wounds in the
temporary hospital. Four of the injured
died at the hospital before 8:30 o'clock.
When the wrecked train crews had fin
ished pulling together the broken cars
twelve dead men were lying on the
grass awaiting removal to the morgue. A
majority of them were killed while asleep.
The* circus performers were on the rear of
the moving train and escaped injury.
NO ESTIMATE OF LOSS.
' "Wallace Brothers say their loss will be
very heavy, but have given no estimate of
it as yet. The official report on the acci
dent issued by Superintendent Brownlee
declared positively that the airbrakes
have been tested since the accident and
found to be in perfect condition and there
is evidence that they were not applied.
One of the officials, In dese'riblng the ac
cident and its cause, said that he believed
that Engineer Probst had exhausted his
air in checking his train several times
between Lansing and Durand and failed
to charge his tank again. The head brake
man and 'fireman, who were on the en
gine, bear out Engineer Probst's state
ment that the brakes refused to work.
The bodies of the dead have been placed
in coffins and are belngr shipped to their
homes as rapidly as possible.
DETROIT, Aug. 7.â Twenty-two of the
Injured circus men were brought to De
troit this afternoon in a special hospital
train and taken to Harper Hospital. At

Two Sections Crash Together
With Appalling */,-;, l\
Results.
Constable Rivera of Redlands, who ia
an old-time settler in the district, says
that almost twenty years ago a prisoner,
James Wharton- by name, escaped from
the Los Angeles Jail. He effected his es
cape bv filing the ball from his chain
while at. work in the courtyard. He made
his way east to this city, where he was
shortly afterward detected by officers.
Before- they could capture him; however,
he stole a horse, and when last seen
was making his way along the road to
old San Bernardino. The horse returned
home next day, but Wharton was never
seen again! Those who saw him last said
that he still wore his chain, and there
can be little doubt that the skeleton found
to-day is that of the escape of twenty
years ago. The \bones were found three
and a half feet under the earth. How
they . came there or how Wharton met
death is a mystery.
SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 7.-A human
skeleton was - unearthed on the Barton
tract east of this city this afternoon by
workmen in the employ of a ditch com
pany. Partly wrapped about the bones
was a heavy iron chain, while the neck
wore a heavy collar of sheet Iron riveted
together. .

Thousands are already leaving the Vene
tian provinces to attend the coronation
of "their Pope." .
The Government, to avoid untoward in
cidents, â¢ has ordered the piazza and the
neighborhood of St. Peter's and the ba
silica to be occupied by the military, and
has forbidden an anti-clerical manifesta
tion proposed by the Socialists .and Re
publicans for that day.
The Pope's first allocution, to be deliv

looked forward to with great interest.
Don Carlos, the Spanish pretender, who
is a personal friend -of Pius X, has said
to his followers that he would not now
have the papacy against him, as he did
under the pontificate of Leo, who was
godfather of King Alfonso, and has even
gone so far as to say that he hoped the
accession of the Pope would help him to
the throne.

Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
hummed up in a sentence, it may be said
that the rasa In trade and industry is satis
factorily secured, while the future, despite
pome mainly sentimental drawbacks, is highly
promising. Divided geographically it is to be
noted that the East feels the effect of a spec
ulative liquidation and the dulling effects on
manufacturing of high prices of raw mate
rial, or of strikes, while the West and South
contemplate the i>rcfpects of good yields of
staple crops and remunerative prices for the
came with confidence and even optimism.
Staple prices are drifting lower. Food
products certainly tend lower.
Other developments in actual trade and
manufacture are favorable. There are mere
buyers of dry goods and clothing, hats, fhoes
and hardware in Western markets, and In
nearly ail lines business is claimed to be <qual
to or In excess of last year, so far. The dry"
tÂ«od* searon has or^ned well at New York in
all llneÂ» except cotton goods. For the first
time In weeks something approaching life is
*een in the iron trade.
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.-R. G. Dun &
Co.'s Weekly Review of Trade lo-morrow
will saj-:
Trade advices from nearly every, section con
tinued to show as favorable conditions as a
year a#r> and ia many lines the volume of
transactions hag been increased. ..Jobbers re
!>ort fail ' business openjac with excellent pros
pects, and manufacturing plants are well oc
cupied with the exception of cotton mills. Dis
tribution cf merchandise is so hekvy that.rail
way oquipment already proves inadequate, al
though crops are not the factor that they will
li*" in a few weeks. Earnings In July exceeded
last year's by 1Z7 per cent, and those of 1901
t>.v 20.2 fer cent. On ihr whole, news from the
larm? is less favorable, but no serious curtail
ment is assured, and many sections make very
bright reports. A decline of 1.5 per cent in
commodities in July is evidence that prices
are less inflated, since the change was mainly
in moats and other food, which have been rul
lcg at an abnormal position.
Consumption of iron and steel is on a large
tcale and in many departments the past week
iiaa witnessed the signing of numerous con
tracts, but there is a tendency to deliver pur
chases beyond early needs. . This conservatism
is not surprising In view of the uncertainty
regarding the security and financial markets,
together with considerable Interruption to
structural work throush labor controversies.
The rate of consumption and the moderate sixe
of orders, however, indicate that stocks are
running 1 low. which encourages furnace men
and mill operators to hold quotations fairly
fcteaiy. A moderate tonnage of pigiron has
been ordered and in partly finished products
the best feature juft now is the bidding for
agricultural implt merit makers. More pigiron

less pressure for tin plates, the peculiar
weather extending the canning season and giv

is full occupation in a!l branches of thin in
dustry and in merchant pipe also the mills

No change is noticed in the attitude of cotton
poods buyers, who arpear determined to post
jione business until the readjustment of prices
for raw material. Owing to the gradual re
duction in mill stocks there is a similar dis
jxwition to delay undertaking new contracts
and the result is further addicted to idle ma.

;CHICO, Aug. 7.â Approximately one
half of the business portion of Biggs, in
Southern Butte County, was destroyed by
fire this afternoon, entailing ' a loss of
over $40,000 and sweeping away the most
substantial part of the town. The flre
started hi a small clothing and furnish

Eller of Sacramento and conducted by
Joseph Kehfeld. The latter was cooking
a meal on a gasoline stove and the gaso
line tank exploded.
Â¦ Within five minutes the fire was spread
ing with great rapidity both' east and
west, for this establishment was mid
way of the principal business block.
Though fully 300 men assembled to en
deavor to tight the fire, there was no
fire apparatus with which to accomplish
anything and all that could be done was
to form a bucket brigade and try to save
the business block on the opposite side
of the street, which was done after a
most determined .fight lasting about' two
hours.

Dr. Miles* Heart Cure
Cured Me.
The effect of excessive cmokiog shown by
ruch symptoms as heart pains, heartburn,
smotherine spells, shortness of breath, flut-
tering and palpitation, is most serious. If
your neart is in any way affected you should
at once begin the use of Dr. Miles' Heart
Cure which enriches the blood, regulate! the
heart's action and improves the circulation.
"I am a local newspaper man and
have been an inveterate smoker since my
boyhood. A little over a year ago I first
noticed symptoms of heart trouble, palpita-
tion and acute pains and a peculiar, I might
say, indescribable feeling across my chest
Local physicians said I had 'tobacco heart.*
I quit smoking for a while and took regular
dose, of digitalis and bclladona with some
relief but the same old symptoms were still
there. A friend of mine here recently died
of what the doctor said was valvular disease
of the heart. Knowing that his symptoms
were similar to mine I felt that ray time too
was limited, although I am still a voung
man, in my thirty-ninth year. In Skulman
& Stone's drag store here Dr. Miles' New
Heart Cure was recommended. I began
taking it and I can positively state that its
effect is marvelous. I have just finished my
third bottle and feel like a 'kid' and believe
I am cured. This letter is the spontaneous
utterance of one who wishes to thank yon
for benefits received."â Wm. N. Grant,

OGDEN, Utah, Aug. 7.â William Majors,
a miner from Golconda, Nev., was shot
by a robber on an eastbound freight at
5 o'clock this morning at Cawdor, a sta
tion a few miles west of Ogden, on the
Southern Pacific. Majors was riding on
the platform of a steel coal car, when
suddenly the robber made his appearance
and, pointing a revolver at him, demand
ed his money. At first Majors treated the
demand as a joke and brushed the revol
ver aside, when It was accidentally dis
charged. The two men then clinched and
In the struggle which followed all the
shots of the revolver were discharged and
Majors was rendered helpless by two
woundsâ one In his right leg above the
knee and one in the left hip. His assail
ant then robbed him of a gold watch and
$5 in money and left the train.
Majors was brought to the hospital at
Ogden, where it was found that his
wounds were serious, but hopes are given
for his recovery. The Sheriff and police
have a good description of Majors'-as

rested at Brlgham City.

MINEB IS WOUNDED
AND BOBBED ON TRAIN
This court is of the opinion that the trans
portation of the goods on the high seas was an
act preliminary to Importation and not any
part of the Importation. Had the vessel with
its cargo been lost at sea. It is clear that the
sugars would not have been imported into the
United States, nor would they have been im
ported had they been thrown overboard during
the stress of weather."
The same arguments were advanced by
the collector and the plaintiff In* the Porto
Rlcan sugar matter, and the collector was
again overruled, Judge Ray stating:
It would seem that merchandise Is to be
deemed imported on the day when It arrived
at the port of entry and not before. The de
murrer of the defendant must be overruled
with costs. So ruled.
NEW YORK. Aug. 7.â Judge Ray in the
United States Circuit Court handed down
two decisions to-day overruling the de
murrers taken by George . R. Bidwell
when Collector of the Port in the suit of
the American Sugar Refining Company
to recover duties upon- certain sugars
brought from Panay in the Philippines
and from Porto Rico.
The refining company sued for $58,075,
with interest from October 11, 1E99, In the
matter of the Philippine sugar and for
$21,716 on the Porto Rico sugar, and for
terest from April IS, 1S99. The allegations
of the plaintiff say that the amounts "were
illegally extracted andÂ«:ollected. The ac
tion was begun in the Supreme Court and
removed to the United States Circuit

ground, in the Panay matter, that when
the sugar was shipped on March 14, 1809,
the Philippine Islands were foreign terri

Archibald Treat, the well-known sports
man, has proved the star angler of the
week. While trolling on Lake Tahoe, near
Brockway, some days since he hooked a
twenty-eight and a half inch trout weigh
ing nine and a half pounds. After a
thirty-minute battle he landed his prize,
lie was using a star spinner with a light
brook trout tackle. Experts say 4 the
trout is of the Salmo Tahoensis species.

Wolters stated that the cables had been
attached to the building without the con
sent of the owner, Claus Spreckels, and
without a knowledge of the details of the
proposed construction. Casey said that
the board had contended with the same
trouble in that proper plans and specifica
tions had never been furnished. Wolters
again formally notified the board that Mr.
Spreckels Insisted that the cables be re
moved at ones.
board held that It had no Jurisdiction to
do so, as It was a private matter over
which It had no control. It was suggest
ed that the only remedy lay in suing out
a restraining writ in the courts. Wolters
asked if the board would take any action
if a complaint was tiled that the arch as
It now stands is a menace to life and
limb, and President Casey said that
would be another matter.

TWO Fefsions of the Executive

yesterday to discuss topics con-,
nected with suspension of work on

L'> remove the pedestals and all other ma

At the session of the Executive Commit

pedestals, however, will be shifted from

A POLISH CUSTOM f
By KOWALSKI y g
Call Art Supplement, August 9, 1903 }'
"The "Wedding Party," by Kowalski, illustrates the Polish form of a Â£
custom which exists in almost every civilized and many semi-dvilized Â©
countries. Â£
In the agricultural districts of Poland, where horses are most necea- 'A
sary to cover long distances over the broad steppes, it is most natural Â¦
that the wedding procession should take the form of a "promenade en ?
voiture." It is such a scene, full of life and gayety, that is depicted In Â©
the picture reproduced in the art supplement. Laughing faces, bright o
/ color and lively movement combine to give the scene a character of Joy- "
ousness and a "go" seldom found in pictorial representations. Â¦
"The Wedding Party," which is at present exhibited at the Chicago 2
_ Art Institute, is the property of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bosenbaum of Chi- Â©
cago, and is held in high favor. H

distinctly of the sardonic school. While all the world
is growling at what it terms crafty and unscrupu
lous robbery perpetrated by Russia in Manchuria the
cunning bear leases from Korea a patch of land for
a purpose not very clear even in its announcement.
This looks like Japan's cue for another protest.
WHILE there is a good deal of interest felt in
the coming contest for the America's cup,
and while the opinion prevails that the two
competitors will be well matched and represent the
highest achievement in the art of constructing marine
racing michines, there is nevertheless evident a
growing discontent with the present method of com
peting for the cup. The argument is that the com
peting boats are not "yachts" in any rightful sense
and that their construction is of no benefit whatever
to genuine yachting.
The dissatisfaction is finding expression in the
press of the larger cities of the East, and notably in
that of New York. The Tribune after noting that
discontent with the "racing machines" is spreading
and is more notable this summer than ever before,
says: "The feeling is becoming pretty general among
yachtsmen, we think, not to speak of the larger pub
lic that possesses some nautical understanding and
experience, that a reversion to an earlier type ought
to be brought about"
The New York Times says: "The acquiescence of
the New York Yacht Club in what we may, with
undue deference to the current slang, to which no
deference whatever is really due, call the .'big single-*
sticker proposition,' is at the source, is the source, of
all our aquatic woes. The object of yacht races is,
theoretically, to improve the breed, of that noble
animal, the yacht. The result of these races of
twenty years, according to the testimony of all the
experts, is simply to degrade the breed of the animal
in question. It is, we understand, entirely admitted,
on both sides, that a vessel which has a fair chance,
under these new conditions, of winning or of losing
the America's cup cannot possibly fulfill the diction
ary definition of a 'yacht/ which is that of 'a vessel
built and sailed for pleasure.'"
Such expressions of dissatisfaction are so common

CAPITAL in California has been diverted from
mining to the development of our other val
uableresources to the abridgment of mining
development. The policy of the Government in pre
venting the use of our best water powers, which are
on those parts of streams that lie within forest or
park reservations, has also obsoleted many mines
which have no fuel accessible, but could be profitably
worked by electric power.
These causes combined, and their absence in other
mining States, have resulted in our being excelled,
from time to time, in our annual output of gold. But
when they are removed, and especially when the use
of the excluded water powers is permitted, California
may easily lead the gold States once more. But it is
interesting to note that in the East this is still treated
as the leader of the mining States. It is known there
that mining development in Montana, Utah and
Colorado is largely by the experience acquired in
California, and when men think of gold they think
of California with it.
Our commissioners to the St. Louis Exposition
have caused it to be announced that California will
prepare for that occasion a complete mining exhibit
that will be kept together as a permanent illustration
of our mineral resources and the methods of their
conversion. The Eastern press generally comments
upon this as intensely satisfactory to the whole coun
try, correctly assuming' that this State can be relied

regarding it as the foremost feature we. have to offer.
They will find that it excels the world, but they will

asking assistance in locating her son.
George Satter, 19 years of age. She said
her son came to this city from Fargo, N.

to her regularly till April. Since that time
she has not heard from him.

FLORENCE CRITTENTON MISSIONâ
M., City. The Florence Crlttenton Home
is an organization chartered by special
act of the United States Government for
the purpose of reaching 'and leading into
better lives unfortunate girls and women.
It consists of a chain of more than fifty
homes, located in different cities, as well
as one each In Japan and France, besides
numerous circles, the members of which
visit the haunts of sin and encourage the
girls to forsake the evil life. About 80 per
cent of those reached are permanently re
formed. The first home was opened at 21
Bleecker fctreet. New York City, eighteen
years ago by Mr. Crittenton, the founder
and president, and named for his little
daughter Florence. The headquarters of

AUTOMOBILEâ J. C, Vallejo. Cal. The
fastest mile made with an automobile on
a straight away track was made Novem
ber 16. 1901. by Hy. Fouraier with a forty
horsepower gasoline machine over the
Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn, N. T.; time
51 4-5 seconds. The same man, with same
machine, made a mile on a circular track
October 10, 1901, on the Empire City track,
Yonkers. N. Y.; time 1:06 4-5. The world's
record for a mile on an elliptic track was
made June 20, 1303. at Indianapolis In
69 3-5 seconds.
WHEN the officers of the American squadron
were officially entertained in London mem
bers of the British Ministry talked freely
with them about the Monroe doctrine. They desired
that its extension be considered, so as to assert the
paramount right of the United States in this hemi
sphere to exercise control over the financial obli
gations and international responsibility of Latin-
America, and compel proper international conduct
without the necessity of intervention by Europe.
We can inMio respect undertake to guarantee the
Latin-American states beyond protecting the integ
rity of their soil and sovereignty. But inasmuch as
that makes war upon them futile as a remedial meas
ure some other way must be found to teach them the
icternati&nal manners of civilization. International
law does not recognize a peaceful blockade. A blockade
concerns the commercial rights of neutrals. No
neutral ship or cargo can be prevented entering a
seaport unless there has been a declaration of war.
This was recognized by the concerted powers in the
Venezuela blockade, and while that adventure forced
the adjustment by arbitration of the issues which
caused it it really settled nothing.
One recourse is left, which the United States should
hasten to recognize. Suppose that after arbitration
Venezuela refuse, as she may, the award and de
cline payment, a repetition of the blockade will be
futile. How can the award be enforced? There is
but one way and that is by occupation of her seaports
and administration of her custom-houses until the
amount is collected in duties. She will have one side
step left, which will be the repeal of her tariff, assum
ing to leave no duties to be collected. But as this
will be part of the offense of evasion the powers con
cerned will be warranted in ignoring it and enforcing
the imposts as they existed when the ports were oc
cupied.
A large number of those Latin-American govern
ments are vicious and predatory to a degree that for
feits any consideration that might be felt for honest
members of the family of nations. Their dishonesty
forbids that we in any respect become their guaran
tors. At the same time we bear before the world a
most painful responsibility if the Monroe doctrine
work to absolve them from all honorable observance
of international obligations. They must be made to
understand that this will not be permitted! To per
mit it makes us the protector of piracy.
Those countries need and continually invite the
investment of foreign capital. If the issues which
arise out of such investment are between individuals
governments are not concerned. But if a citizen of a
Latin-American state injure a foreign investor or
damage the person of a foreign national, and the ex
ecutive protect him in it, the act becomes the act of
the nation and it must respond. In default of a civ
ilized system of jurisprudence in many of those states
it is the f2rt that the courts are the creatures of the
President's will, and their denials of justice to for
eigners are almost invariably dictated by the execu
tive. Such acts cannot be overlooked by the civilized
nations.
Upon the whole we are inclined to think that one
or two examples' of the seizure of custom-houses and
collection of revenues to meet arbitral judgments
will bring those bandit governments to their senses
and make them understand that the Monroe doctrine
is not a skull and crossbones flag.

SECURING A PATENT â Engineer,
City. There is nothing to prevent you
from taking the steps to secure a patent
without the aid of an attorney, but if
your invention is a valuable one you may,
from lack of experience In such matters,
make a mistake that would cost you your
patent, for there are sharpers who are
constantly on the alert for mistakes of
that kind. They steal a man's invention
and have it patented. It is safest to en
gage the services of one posted in such
matters.

AN illustration of the extent to which the rush
of railway traffic with an inadequate supply of
rolling stock and an' insufficient roadbed has
endangered our railway transportation is afforded in
the recently published bulletin of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, giving the list of accidents and
fatalities for the months of January, February and
March of this year. It makes a' showing something
like the record of a war and demonstrates the neces
sity of the adoption of a much better system of safe
guards than is now in use on most of our roads.
By what is known as the "accident law" of March,
lOQi, railroads are required to make reports to the
commissidn of all accidents on their lines, together
with a statement of the losses, fatalities and injuries
that result. The reports show that during'the tlvree
months under review there were 1650 collisions and
1 181 derailments, making a total of 2831 accidents.
Of the. collisions 291 .and of the derailments 125
affected passenger trains. As a result of the acci
dents .300 persons were killed and 2843 injured. Acci
dents of other kinds, including those sustained by
employes while at work and by passengers in getting
on or off the cars, bring the total number of casual
ties up to 837 killed and 11,481 injured.
Some of the accidents could hardly have been
guarded against by the company. Such was notably
the case' of a collision of which the bulletin says:
"The visual signa-ls (automatic semaphore block sig
nals) with which the road is equipped for the preven
tion of collisions were in this case concededly ade
quate and in good working order, but the engineman
appears to have been oblivious to all signals for a
period of two or three or more minutes, and as the
train was running very fast this length of time suf
ficed for him to pass three or four warning red lights
and therefore to collide with a passenger train in
advance, causing a terrible wreck. * * * The
engineman was killed in the collision and no ex
planation of his conduct was forthcoming, but it ap
pears he was in good mental and physical health so
far as is known."
In another set of accidents there was gross care
lessness: The bulletin says of one case of that kind:
"The use of flags, torpedoes and fusees was depended
on to protect a train from reaf collision at a time
when, in consequence of a deep snow on the ground,
the use of the block system was demanded by con
siderations of more than ordinary gravity. Deep
snow with the walking of the flagman and
often interferes with the effectiveness of torpedoes;
and if the snow is blown about by the wind or dis
turbed by the moving train the engineman may have
his view of the flagman's flag or lantern obstructed."
Of course in a country with such an enormous
railway mileage as ours there will always be acci
dents, but it would seem that railway managers
might improve on the conditions that now prevail.
A total of nearly 3000 collisions and derailments
within three months is a little too high an accident
list even for a people who are so reckless in their
desire, for speed.

NEWSPAPERSâ J. C Vallejo, CaL
The newspaper publishers raised the price

The parties who are prospecting in the
vicinity of Indian Springs, Shasta County,
preliminary to dredging for gold have met
with difficulties which they did not fore
see: TiV.V;:'
They are prospecting with a drill and a few
days ago they struck a large quantity of
water, much to their surprise. This has re
tarded their work in a measure and will neces
sitate the installation of new and larger ma
chinery, which will be done immediately. An
order has been given for a powerful engine
which will be capable of handling all the
water they may have to contend with. ThÂ«
presumption is that there Is a false bedrock
beneath the surface and that It Is the bedrock
which Is producing the water. There have
been -several similar Instances In the history
of the State and those . who have the ; work
In charge have not become In the least " dis
couraged. They will continue prospecting and
they have the belief that they will strike
gravel shortly below the false bedrock.
According to the Log Angeles Journal
there are fully 500 mining companies rep

rate of flees, but there are many, with offices

a list of such could be given which are not

The Lincoln mine, so says the Amador
Ledger, is about to be closed:
A meeting of the director* of this company
was held early In the week, at which It was
dctlnltely decided to close down. The work of
taking up the track is now In progress. This
may take a counle of weeks to finish, at the
enti of which time the property will revert to
idleness. The company have expended In the
neighborhood of $200,000 in prospecting. They
have searched it thoroughly and used good
judgment and economy in all the operations.
They do not feel justified In continuing thÂ«
work. T. J. Clavering, representing the own
ers of the Lincoln, was present, also Mr. Stent,
a large stockholder, after whom the town of
Stent, In Tuolumne, was named. A proposi
tion was made to consolidate the L.i:iii"In and
Mahahoy properties and continue work. This
was favorably considered at first but finally
It waji deemed inadvisable to press it under
existing conditions.

As a result of a run of five days John Xeale's

cent ground when a frame building has been
removed and water Is available lor use la

among old-timers that Mr. Neale. who haa ex
tracted much gold from the premises In the
past few years, has not yet encountered the
riohent streak of' gravel. This opinion is
shared by Mr. Neale. who expects a '49 clean
up when he uncovers the. old creek channel. .
The Tuolumne Independent reports the
following deals for mining properties in
Tuolumne County:
William Sharwood and Carroll McTarnahan
have entered into an agreement with William
Floyd to sell their two-thirds Interest In a
quartz mine south of and adjacent to the
Grizzly mine. George Collins of Carter* has sold
to Mrs. Annie Belle Smith all his half Interest
In the Annie Belle gold-mining claim on Mount
Eaton. William Hartman of Carters has sold
to Bias Kollch of Columbia a one-third interest
In the Old Home placer mine, near Yankee

STATISTICS FOB STATE.
Statistician Charles G. Yale of the State
Mining Bureau will have the annual re
turns concerning the mineral output of
California completed in the next fort
night. Many of the counties have their
statistics in. The showing may be af
fected by the labor troubles, that serious
ly interfered with the output of copper at
the mines of the Mountain Copper Com
pany at Keswick, where for months there
were difficulties. The greatest interest
may attach to the output of the oil mines.
It Is asserted by the secretary of the Cal
ifornia Petroleum Miners' Association
that the consumption of petroleum in Cal
ifornia will reach 20,000,000 barrels during
the year 1903. At this time the consump
tion of oil is running close to the produc
tion in certain sections; in others, where
the facilities for transportation are not
good, the tankage continues heavy. The
statistics to be sent out by the State Min
ing Bureau apply to the year 1102. There
is no question that the production of oil
during the present year will far surpass
that of 1902. - The figures about to be re
ceived will show more accurately than
any other returns Just what the output
was last year, and will dispel some theo
ries on that subject.
According to the Seattle Times the out
put of gold In Nome for the present year
promises to amount to $15,000,000. The as
say-office In Seattle, which has been es
tabHshed only five years, has handled
American and Canadian gold amounting
to $73,000,000 according to the same author
ity. Says the Times:
The poor favor with which the pesos
recently coined in this city and in Phila
delphia as the basis for the currency of the
Philippine i-.ands have been received by
the Filipinos will not, so say the officials
of the' United States Mint in this city, in
terfere with carrying out the full coinage
authorized by act of Congress. That act
calls for making pesos to the amount of
75,000,060. The mintage of these new pieces
in San Francisco to date amounts to $5,
900,000. In Philadelphia a very much less
quantity has been turned out from the
mint. An Important consideration to
mine owners In the United 'States la
whether the Government will continue to
buy silver bullion for the Filipino coins.
The purchase of such bullion, as contem
plated under the act of Congress, to pro
vide all the pesos that are needed involves
the expenditure of something like $30,000.
000. California is not largely concerned in
this marketing of silver, but "Colorado
and Utah have a large stake in it. h ;Â¦Â«>
If the surmises of the officials of the
Mint in San Franclsco v are accurate and
the mintage shall go on without inter
ruption, the sale of more than 120,000,000
of silver to be turned into pesos for the
use of the Filipinos is assured. The coins
are new to the Filipinos and therefore
are probably regarded with more or less
distrust. But they are intended to make
a" uniform basis for the transaction of
island business and so insure a greater
measure of stability than could be expect
ed where Spanish, Mexican and American
coins are in simultaneous use. It is sup
posed that the Filipinos will soon get
used to the new pesos and be pleased
eventually to have a uniform currency.
On one Bide of the coins are the American
flag and the eagle; on the other side is a
Filipino emblem. The effect of the Fili
pino side of the coin is' somewhat marred
by the mixture of Spanish and English
in the designation of value. Instead of "uno
peso" the coin is imprinted with "one
peso." As business in the islands increases
there will undoubtedly be a tlemattd for
more coins and the silver purchases will
be increased.
THEATERSâ L. F. S.. City. The seat
ing capacity of San Francisco theaters
was published in this department July 9,
1303.
porter had exhausted all the political cross-examina
tion, the Senator volunteered the statement: "While
I was abroad I was much interested in European
farming. They are good farmers over there, but
when you come to compare their labor and prod
ucts â " There the words failed, but the reporter
adds: "The Senator shook his head, intimating that
nothing can compare with the American farmer."
We may therefor* safely conclude that if Gorman
gets into the fight he will try to catch the farmer
vote as an offset to the cowboy.
Of other issues he said: 'The negro question is not
political. It has got beyond that. It will have no
bearing on the next campaign in a strictly political
sense. It will not make the South more solid, for
the South is too solid now. As to trusts, every one
knows that they are unnatural and unhealthy. As to
regulating them, they seem to be regulating them
selves. They all have incorporated in them the
seeds of death. I understand that since I have been
away Wall street has been. turned upside down by
trying to handle them."
Returning to the subject of Democratic prospects
the Senator said: "Democracy must get back to old
ideas and abandon the false ones it has been follow
ing. In the coming campaign I will take my place
uS soldier in the Democratic ranks and fight as hard
as I can. I will not be the head of the Democratic
National Committee. If Cleveland be nominated I
will support him as I would any other candidate. I
have never quarreled with Cleveland; we have only
differed. I never have political quarrels, but some
times I have political disagreements."
That is the sum and substance of the various inter
views, and the public can draw its own conclusions
as to whether Gorman is a candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination. One other point is worth noting.
At the close of one of the interviews, when the re-
SENATOR GORMAN returned from Europe in
time to reach New York just as his Presidential
boom was being exploited in the press. As a
consequence he was met by a host of reporters and
called upon to define his position. It is scarcely nec
essary to say the Senator was evasive, for that is the
settled policy of all Democratic leaders at this time,
but nevertheless his methods of evasion were quite
different from those of his rivals and may be studied
with interest
Cleveland, Parker and the others when asked to
state whether or no they will be candidates decline
to be interviewed. Parker indeed said he has no
opinions on any political issue at this time and that
he cannot consent to be interviewed upon any point
whatever. Gorman is more adroit. He does not de
cline to be interviewed. On the contrary, he talks
easily and readily; he replies to every question put to
him; he makes no request that his words shall not be
printed; he offers no explanations. Talking thus
with freedom and seeming candor, it is not difficult
for any reporter to get a two column interview with
him, but when his utterances are read over the reader
perceives that after all the aStute Marylander has
really said nothing of importance nor even intimated
anything. In fact in his free and easy talking he has
been more non-committal than Judge Parker, who so
emphatically insists that he will not talk at all.
Summing up the statements as given in half a dozen
Eastern papers on theday after his arrival at, New
York, Gorman said that during his stay in Europe
he had heard little of American politics and had
given np though^ to the subject. He professed to be
ignorant even of the political situation in Maryland
and declared he could not say what course he would
take in regard to it. When told that the Democratic
politicians were awaiting his return to "fix up a
slate" he replied: "Well, I will soon be with them,
but I do not know anything about the matter now."
Concerning national politics he said: "I haven't
been considering any individual for the Democratic
nomination, and that includes myself. ; One can't tell
anything about it. The convention is almost a year
off. It is the party that must be considered, not men.
We seem to be getting away from a number of false
ideas that the party has been chasing around after in
the past few years. The issues of the campaign are
likely to be reformation' of the tariff, economy of
Federal administration and economy in public places.
It is by no means certain that the Postoffice scandal
will hurt the Republican party. The people may
forget all about it before the election. Moreover
the Republicans may make capital of it by pointing
out how they detected it and suppressed it. Neither
can we be certain about the issue of economy. The
people may not care about that either. There used
to be a howl when Congress appropriated large sums,
but that is past now. People don't think of it any
more. We can have a billion-dollar Congress these
days without hearing a word about it."

and come from such high sources that it is not likely
they will be overlooked by those who have the au
thority to fix the terms under which the cup is to be
competed for in future. Consequently we may see
this year the last of the racing machine matches. As
the Times puts it: "The reaf conclusion appears^o be
that if the New York .Yacht Club should see its way
to revert to the original scheme of racing schooners
only for the America's cup it would confer an im
mense benefit and advantage upon the 'Anglo-
Saxon' 'yachting' world"
GORMAN'S VIEWS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1903.
Former Lieutenant Governor Lee of Missouri
wept on the witness stand the other day as he told
of the dishonesty which ruled the State while he was
in office and in which he was besmirched. It is
strange to what expedients some men will resort to
make others laugh.
A Berkeley, professor of- an investigating turn of
mind recently discovered in a deep - shaft hidden
within a Shasta County cave the skeleton of a woman
who had probably been thrown down the shaft over
one ; hundred years ago. Even with this evidence of
the antiquity of our people and the extremely ad
vanced state of our customs our Eastern rivals may
still insist that we are of mushroom growth and yet
in our callow youth.
Shafts of ice ten inches long fell recently in thun
derous storm in Colorado. This ought to suggest a
splendid opportunity for a missionary field for the
Promotion Committee of California. While one
man's gain is not necessarily another's loss in
economics there is nothing to indicate that one man's
loss may not be another's gain in climate.

The National Association of Butter
makers of America may hold its 1905 con
vention in this city. The California Pro
motion Committee, assisted by a number
of the most prominent butter-makers and
dairymen of the State, has been working
for some time to have the butter-makers
meet here and in all probability they will
be successful in their efforts.
The association will convene In Sioux
City this year and in St. Louis next year.
A short time ago W. F. Jenses of To
peka, Kans., visited this State, and after
studying the climate and conditions, made
a most favorable report to the members
of the association in the East. They are
all anxious to see California and In all
probability they will be glad of a chance
to assemble here in 1905.

Since then others prominent in working
for the welfare of California, like the
Sacramento Valley Development Associa,
tion. have taken up the fight for the for
ests. On the other hand, opposition has
been offered to the forest reserve exten
sion by the timber magnates, who are
accumulating vast areas of California
timber lands, from which they propose
to cut off the trees, leaving the mountain
sides bare. In various ways a strong op
position has been worked up against for
est, reserves in this State.
'Officers of the California Water and
Forest Association say that there is evi
dently a large amount of misunderstand
ing in certain counties relative to the
facts. It has therefore been determined
to get out literature, to be mailed to at
least 10,000 individuals In certain locali
ties, who are interested as property own
ers In the welfare of California and who
will be directly affected by the denudation
of the Slerran slopes. A pamphlet is now
In preparation which will be sent out in
about a fortnight and which will contain
much information and will present a
strong argument in behalf of protecting
the California forests from extinction.
The California "Water and Forest Asso
ciation is about to start upon a cam
paign of education in the counties where
a strong movement has been put on foot
to oppose the national Governmental pol
icy of the extension and permanent main
tenance of forest reserves in California.
The national administration was moved
in the direction of extending In. this
State, at least temporarily, the boundaries
of the forest reservations by information
received from California. The primary
Impulse to the movement for the preser
vation of the forests standing upon the
western slopes of the Sierra was given by
the Water and Forest Association in con
vention.

Helen Brewer is a steel ship of 15S0 tons

Glasgow. She sailed under the Hawaiian
flag until the annexation of the Territory
gave her the right to fly the Stars and
Stripes.
She left Sourabaya February 28 and on
March 3 went ashore about thirteen
miles from her starting place. She was
ficated March 5 and the day following re
sumed her voyage. She Etranded on mud
bottom and is thought to have sustained
no injury when she went ashore. Her
commander is Captain D. Mahany. While
not a speedy vessel, she has a reputation
for making fair passages and her present
tardiness is regarded as serious.

pected to prove the best of the tourna
ment. George Baker and Charles Dun
lap are the two players who will meet
to settle the question of supremacy and
decide who shall be the first winner of the
new challenge cup. On form Baker ap
pears to have the better chance of win
ning. Dunlap played fine tennis last Sun
day. If he can play as good a game* to
morrow he- stands a fine chance of win
ning. Baker at his best Is somewhat
stronger than Dunlap, but the college
crack has not been showing his best form
of late.
WHEN the California Associa
tion Football League opens the

of .the French Association Football Club
are Andrew J. Camovls, president; George
H. Royer, vice president; Einilo J. Pier
ron, secretary; Andrew A. Glarner, treas
urer. ' . .
There wilj also be a try-out to-morrow
to decide who shall be the representative
of the Pacific Association In the single
shell. The races will begin at 11 a. m.
The Alameda Boat Club, being the hold
er of the senior barge championship, will
send a crew of four men to Astoria with
out the ordeal of a try-out. The four will
be E. B. Thornlng, Sydney Pollard and
two others yet to be chosen.
OVER the old Mission Bay course
to-morrow there will be a try-out
between barge crews representing
the Ariel and South End rowing clubs and
the Dolphin and Oylmpic boat clubs.
The oarsmen will race over a mile and
a half course with a turn, and the crews
taking the first two places will go to the
ninth annual aquatic carnival at Astoria
as the representatives of the Pacific As
sociation of the Amateur Athletic Union.
The Ariel crew, will be the same as that
which took part In the senior barge race
at the annual championship regatta on
Lake Merritt on July 4, being made up as
follows: Alex Keegan, bow; E. L. Smith,
No. 2; E. J. Lynch, No. 3, and Charles
Wilson, stroke.
The Dolphin representatives will prob
ably be the intermediate barge crew
which rowed at Lake Merritt, viz.: T. R.
DIxon, H. Swellund, Thomas Harris and
William Harria. The South End crew will
probably be stroked by J. P. Foley.
If the Oylmpic Boat Club should at-,
tempt to enter Its Intermediate crew in
the try-out it would be rejected on ac
count of Its failure to compete in the
Lako Merritt events, for which it was en
tered, but the Junior Olympic crew might
try to win a place. It Is made up of
Charles Stewart, Roy Wilson, R. W. Ma
son and Francis Boland.
Joe Corbett Is steadily improving in his
work. He does better at every, perform
ance. But he has been pitching In hard
\luck for all that during the past month.
In that thirteen-inning game on . Thurs
day Joe had everything -that is the lot of
the slab man to possess, yet he lost
through the errors and dummy playing of
his supporters.
Dillon and his batting average are much
talked about among the fans at the pres
ent time. The Los Angeles first baseman
is hitting the ball, at . about a .380 clip.
This is the best record ever made in Cal
ifornia. At this time last' season ,Mc-
Crcedlo 'was leading the league a,nd hla
average was about .325. It was thought
to be a good one then. ..
Of course, they have still a long way to
go ere they will be within striking dis
tance of San Francisco or Los Angeles,
but at the present time they are in dan
ger of heading Mike Fisher's Senators If
they can keep on winning as they, have
been doing the past month. It will be no
surprise to see either of the two teams
in the first division when the September
campaign is ushered in.
Both Portland and Seattle have made
all their headway simply by strengthen
ing their teams when they saw it was the
only thing left for them to do. At the
present time both clubs are well equipped
for a flght with any of them. They have
the talent, and they are being well han
dled, so nothing but the best kind of ball
playing_on*the part of the headline teams
will stop them now that they have, struck
their gait.
Mike Fisher's team is all in for the time
being and perhaps for keeps unless he
manages to corral a couple of good pitch
ers who will not collapse In the tight
places. Those youngsters of Mike's can
not go the route; that Is certain, from
their recent performances. It is an old
adago that you cannot win a pennant by
having your slab artists batted all over
the lot â¢ by every otKer team in the
league.
Black, the new one whom Mike rescued
from the bush league, is a Chicago ama
teur. He came out here last April and
signed with the Butte team of the Pa
c'.fic National League. For some reason
he was never tried out and the Butte
management let him go after feeding him
for a few weeks. Fisher is to be con
gratulated If he makes a good man out
of Black. , â
THE two northern teams of the Pa
cific Coast League, Portland and
Seattle, are attracting more atten
tion from the baseball public at present
than any of the other four clubs of the
league. The marvelous Jump made by
these tail enders is the- sensation of the
hour. They have steadily climbed from
almost hopeless positions and are now
where they can make a fight with the
three leading clubs.

Charles Muller has resigned from the
regatta committee of the California
Yacht Club. His place has been filled by
William McBain Jr., secretary of the
club. The delegates for 1903 from the
California Yacht Club to the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association are Commo
dore George M. Shaw, Allen M. Clay and
R. R. l'Hommedieu.
Last Sunday being an open day on the
programme of the California Yacht Club,
many of the boats remained at their
moorings all day. The yachts that did go
out for a cruise enjoyed a strong breeze.
Robert Vincent's yawl lola and Louis Ro
senfeld's sloop Jessie E cruised to Para
dise Cove, where they dropped anchor.
The "yawl Idler, sailed by August R. F.
Brandes, anchored In California Cove,
San Pablo Bay. Lee Gale's sloop Secret
dropped her hook off California City and
A. M. Clay's sloop Pactolus cruised in the
upper bay.
The main topmast of the yawl lola has
teen cut down nine feet, though her sail
spread has not been reduced. She now
has the appearance of an able, weatherly
boat for outside cruising.
The sloop Verona, owned by Harry
Brindle, has been added to the roll of the
California Yacht Club.
The members of the California Yacht
Club will sail this afternoon to California
Cove, near San Pablo Point. To-morrow
clam chowder will be prepared on the
beach and there will be sculling and row
ing races for small boats, swimming con
tests and a tug-of-war. Commodore
George M. Shaw will be on board the flag
ship Idler for the first time for several
weeks. The sloops Pactolus and Secret
have been on the beach near the club
house during the week, having their im
mersed surfaces scraped, cleaned and
copper-painted.
THE Corinthians start to-day on
their annual cruise up the Sacra
mento River, upon which they
will be absent one week, returning to
their moorings in Tiburon Cove on Sun
day, the ICth inst. The San Francisco
fleet returns to-morrow from its annual
up-river cruise, upon which the sloops
Thetis. Surprise and Challenger Btarted
on Saturday, July 25. The Challenger re
turned to her moorings at Sausallto on
Saturday last, on which day the sloops
Ariel and Queen left Sausalito to Join the
fleet on the cruise.

At the last meeting of these two clubs,
en July 13, the San Francisco County
cricketers beat the Alameda eleven by
147 runs for the loss of only three wick
ets, B. Kortlang being 79 not out when
the Innings was called. Though the Ala
meda team may not be defeated so, easily
to-morrow, there seems little chance of
its turning the tables on Its formidable
antagonists.
B. Kortlanc'B score of 31 not out last
Sunday against the Pacific eleven has
raised his batting average. It now reads:
Seven times, at bat, 4 times not out; total,
2S0 runs; average, 93.23. Harold B. Rich
ardson's score of 44 runs last Sunday not
being up to his average, his average for
the season Is somewhat lower than it

quite handily, beating William Roth, the
ex-Stanford player. Mrs. Elston has been
the woman champion for several years.
Many of the younger players of the
California Club are coming to the front
with a rush. Herbert Long is probably
the most promising of the lot. Long has
an excellent style, but hia headwork la
not good. Practice and experience will
eliminate this fault. Harry Ro'fe is an
other young player who. is making rapid
strides. He lacks Long's style, but \a
steadier. Beyfuss is also a youngster of
promise. He is greatly handicapped by
his lack of size. When he gets his growth
he will undoubtedly figure in the cham
pionship class. Dr. Lovegrove is prob
ably the mosX persistent player on the
courts. The doctor has entered every
tournament during the year. Last Sun
day he won his first tournament match.
In the same manner the doctor stayed
with chess until he won the coast cham
pionship. While this la not expected of
him in tennis, he will surely develop into
a good player.

card. A number of Futurity candidates
will be given a chance at open competi
tion. The coursing will commence upon
the arrival of the 10:15 a. m. train. Tha
likely -winners look to be:
Milo Kane, a coursing man of Colorado
Springs, is preparing to come West with
a string of eight greyhounds.
C. A. Lyons of Sherman, Tex., also
has his eyes on the rich stakes here. Ha
is expected out next month with a string
of twenty-four dogs.
Gus Gllfeather of this city is Judging
at the Butte meeting. Carrie G won tha
32-dog open stake at Butte last Sunday,
beating Lear King in the deciding course.
The regular monthly meeting of tha
California Coursing Committee, the gov
erning body of the sport on this coast,
will be held next Thursday night In Its
office in the Chronicle building.
The coursing at Ingleslde Park to-day
will commence at 11 o'clock. The first

The stake was decided at St. Louis last
year and was won by Roman Athlete,
wnfch was sent on from here with Sac
ramento Boy and other crack hounds. As
this meetinsr will be more easy of ac
cess it is expected there will be a strong
representation from California. The stake
this year will be doubly interesting from
the fact that a valuable cup la offered
for the first time in addition to the biÂ«
money which will go to the winner.
The coursine men of the Middle West
are trying to induce P. J. Reilly of this
city to judge their circuit of meetings
this autumn, kludge Reilly has not as
yet consented to act.
F. L. Nicholls of Butte believes ha
has in imported Parton the best grey
hound in America. He is by Mellor Moor-

Waterloo cup winner. Mr. Nicholls has
been told that his dog Is fast enoush to

Sends Two Men Over the Plate in
THE Cripples came so near being
whitewashed yesterday at Recre
ation Park by their old enemy.
Dr. Newton, that when Francks came
in with the tally which saved them
ho nearly fell down crc he reached the
rubber. It seemed unnatural to make
a run oft Newton. The Angels were flush
with both tallies and hits. Score. 8 to 1.
Those southern club-wielders seemed to
enjoy the brand Dr. Mosklman had and
they alighted on his offerings many times
and often severely. Tho game v/as clean
ly fielded as soon as it was well under
way and "most" of the runs came over
accompanied by many a good solid swat
to the outfields.
As soon as the game was about a min
ute old tho finish of the Oakland bunch
could be easily discerned through the
clouds of many innings yet to como. The
doctor was hit hard and with regularity
from the start. The Angels never let up
on him for any length of time.
Not a chance did the Cripples have* of
getting a run off Newton till the last
Tound, when he eased up Ions enough to
allow Francks and Murdock to single.
Then he forgot himself long enough to
execute a wild pitch. A long fly to deep
center by Schwartz allowed Francks to
sneak in with the Cripples' lone run. Out
of revenge the Angel fielders doubled up
Murdock as he made a dash for the third
cushion. The score: , . " "I/.

had an. estate valued at $2500. No time
was lost by the Administrator and prepa

There have been several disagreements
between the Judson Company and Its em
ployes at different times, but none of them
have ever assumed very great propor
tions, and this Is one of the most serious
strikes that the company has ever ex
perienced. All of the different depart
ments of the company^ works at Emery
ville are run upon, strict ; Eastern union
rates and wages except the rolling mill.
The employes In this department com
municated with their Eastern unions and
discovered that the men at the Judson
Works were being paid from 2 to 4 cents' a
ton less than in the East. Two weeks
ago they formulated a. new 'schedule,
based<i:pon the Eastern rates, and sub
mitted it to the managers of the com
pany. The new schedule was'refusedrand
thereupon the men in the roling mill de
partment walked out.
There has been no trouble at the works,
and all' other departments are at work
as usual. It Is not likely that. the strike
will be a protracted one, and the indica
tions are that It will be settled very
shortly. . . . : .
The rolling mill employes of the Judson
Manufacturing Company have quit work
to the number of nearly 200 owing to. a

The State Board of Health has issued
a circular calling attention to the fact
that rats spread disease and advising
their destruction. The communication
states that Investigation has shown that
rodents are one of the most prolific causes
of the spread of disease; that they 'are
filthy in their mode of life and migratory
in their habits. The circular continues:
We often wonder how a family contracted
diphtheria or scarlet fever or some other con
tagious disease. There is no doubt that often
times this 1* the explanation: Rats hav* come
In contact, with the perms in some place and
brought them to the house. We often seÂ« chil
dren take fruit that has been gnawed by rats,
bite out the patt, then eat the rest. In this
way th? disease is taken d'rect. More often
the fferms are left as duet, which rises by
sweeping or even walking on the floor and are
breathed in with the. air. ,
A united systematic effort should be made
to kill them off. City and town authorities
should take up the work, but It should not be
left to them alone. Every family should trap
and nolson them until there. Kre none left. A
war of extermination should be waged against
them, and many a dear one saved from the
grave. Poisoning can be safely done, and the
health officers of the State will be glad to give
instructions for thos* who wish it. We can
not urge, too cuongly upon the poople. espe
cially of the cities, to rid themselves of this
great danger.

OAKLAND. Aug. 7.â Louis E.
Flemming, superintendent of fire
alarm and police telegraph, was
removed from his position by the
Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners this afternoon. George R.
Babcock. a prominent electrical engineer
of this city, was elected to the office. The
action was on unanimous vote of the
three members. /
The board listened to the reading of a
communication from Flemming, in which
he requested that a hearing be given him
before action was taken in his case. After
Secretary Fawcett had completed the
reading President J. E.. McElroy of the
board announced:
"The board has considered the subject
matter of this communication and it will
be filed."
That Flemming has been slated for dis
missal has been current gossip at the
City Hall since the present administration
assumed office. Trouble arose very early
during the term because of objectidhs
that were made by Chairman John L.
Howard of the Council Auditing and Fi
nance Committee to the way Flemming
carried on the work of his department.
The principal complaint was with relation
to irregularities in the records of city

As superintendent of the city's electri

Examination of the accounts satisfied
city officials that the records were Im

Lieutenant Courtney, accompanied by
Lieutenant Edle, called at the Tevls villa
by invitation, and it is asserted that the
latter sat on the arm of a chair wh^eh
Miss Baxter was occupying. Whether he
accidentally lost his balance and fell
against Miss Baxter Is not stated. Lieu

Mrs. Tevls and her sister went before
the naval inquisitors and gave their ver

The insult alleged to have been offered
by Edie to Mies Baxter, and, through
her to her married sister, was In itself
trivial and would never have been known

a* honorable and glorious as ha* been its
history In the past. Hli earnest solicitude and
h**t wishes will *>ver follow ths fortunes of
the army. NELSON A. MILES.
Lieutenant General. Commanding.
The evt-nts of rec-nt yearn hav* placed uprn
the army a new obligation and an opportunity
for a broader rxempllflcatlon of tt*t country'*
principles. . The United Ptates army Is now
brought into dally communication with mil
lions of people to whom Its Individual mem
bers of every grade are th* exponent* of
American civilization. A s'riotie duty and a
great honor are now presented to e\Â»ery officer
and i-oldler. namely, to exemplify to those
with whom he comes In contact our country's
principle* of equal Â»nrl exact Justice. Immu
nity from violence, equality before the law
and the y-fnr^Tul us" and po^sfFslon of his own.
Marked change* at different tfmÂ»s havÂ» oc
curred in the utrensrth and organization of the
army, resulting from diverse influences, and
various fxperiment* have- been trlÂ»d. Time
has rectified- errors In the past and will do eo
In the future.
All honorable activity and life for the army
must exist within the well-defined lines of
patriotism., untarnished honor, sterling integ
rity. Impartial Justice, obedience to rightful
authority and Incessant warfare against arm
ed enemies. Always to maintain truth, honor
and Justice requires the highest moral courage
and is equally as Important as fortitude In
battle. Drill, discipline and instruction are
but preparatory for the perfection and ef
ficiency of the army.
In thÂ» discharge of Its manifold duties the
army has confronted enemies representing ev
â¢ry stage of human development, from the
highest civilization yet obtained to savagery
and barbarism. It has ever been its duty
to observe In war those chlvalrlc and humane
principles by which Inevitable horrors are so
greatly mitigated, while by unyielding prose
cution of warfare egalnst armed forces its
valor has been demonstrated.
Since Its organization the army has been
charged with a great variety of responsibilities,
all subordinate to defending the country and
maintaining the rights of Its citizens.
The commander* of the army succeeding
Washington have, by their example. Influence
and orders, engendered and maintained the
highest degree of efficiency, discipline and pat
riotism.
During the darkest hours of our history the
first commander of the American forces dem
onstrated the grandeur and nobility of his
character by combating the evil Influences
then pervading the army ard by manifesting
the etrongest confidence and faith In the ulti
mate Justice and integrity of his government.
His words of wisdom uttered at Newburg 12<>
years ago hadi the influence of Inspiring
"unexampled patriotism and patient virtue,
rising superior to the pressure of the most
complicated sufferings." It is one of the glo
ries of our country that the army has main
tained those principles for more than a cen
tury.
WASHINGTON'S INFLUENCE
Unswerving devotion to our Government and
the principles upon which it was established
and has been maintained Is essential to the
efficiency of the national forces, and especially
i* this so in a democratic government, where
the Individual, In order to be a perfect soldier,
must first be a true citizen. The boast that
every soldier of a great' nation carried a mar
shal's baton in his knapsack Is In a higher
sense mure than equaled in significance by the
fact that every American scldier personifies
sovereign citizenship and may by his own con
duct exemplify impartial Justice to those who
have never experienced it and the results of the
highest liberty to those who have been
Strangers to it. thereby aiding to secure for his
country a moral influence not otherwise at
tainable.
The time and occasion are considered oppor
tune for expressing to the army a few thoughts
concerning its past and that which may affect
its future welfare. It Is from the beat lm
presElons and influences of the past that the
most desirable results may be realized In the
future.
In relinquishing the command of the army
of the United States, to which he was as
signed by the President October 2. 18U5, he
hÂ«reby acknowledges his appreciation of the
fidelity manifested by the officers and soldiers
during the past eventful years.
To those who were hie companions and as
sociates during one of the greatest of all wars
he takes pleasure in expressing his gratifica
tion that they have lived through the trials
and dangers of long service to witness the re
sults of their fortitude, heroism and unselfish
devotion to the welfare of their country. They
have also in a most commendable manner ex
emplified to the younger generation of soldiers
those principles of discipline and patriotism
which make the army the protector and de
fender and never the menace of the nation and
its liberties.

address on the occasion of his retirement

about Alex Truman, the leader of the op

The Union Labor forces under the

({ our men against the rank and file of the
!Â»arty and against Eugene E. Schmitz. the
honored Mavor of thi* city, in an effort to pre
vent his nomination and with the hope of kill
ing the Labor party by making its success Im
possible. ,
This is the real nnd only reason for trying
to split the Union Labor party.
Men of San Francisco, sympathisers with our
causÂ«* will you stand for this betrayal?
Will you stand to see our chosen leader and
champion "knifed" eo that the plot may be
larrled out and our party swallowed up by
fusion wrtth another? Shall we put the stamp
of our approval on the basest political ingrati
tude which has ever marked the history San

We do not skulk behind a mask, sandbag
in hand, to slay the man who has been the
benefactor and tried and true friend of organ

A hot battle for control of the Union

Last night President J. F. Forderer of
the City Trustees and City Trustees Dr.
Henry M. Pond and William M. Bowers
participated In â¢ the meeting of the ex
ecutive committee when the applications
of Herman Eppinger Jr. and Robert B.
Mott and the application of P. N. Ber
lnger for local franchises were considered.
Since that meeting the members of the
committee of fifty have less faith than
ever in the offer,of Eppingcr and Mott
to establish a local train and ferry ser
vice. Members of the executive commit
tee say that they were unable to draw
from the applicants any tangible informa
tion as to who were behind them and
how they were situated financially to
carry out a project that it is estimated
would cost from one to three millions of
dollars. It is doubtful whether the com
mittee^ of fifty will recommend the City
Trustees to take any serious notice of
the proposal made by Eppinger and Mntt.
Herman Eppinger Jr. and his standing
in the financial world were thoroughly In
vestigated in San Francisco to-day by
Major Charles I... Tilden, chairman of the
committee of fiftv, who will report the
result to that body.
PARTICIPATE IN MEETING.
In order that their recommendations
shall meet the approval of the City Trus
tees and that there shall b<| no weighty
reason why any of the same should be
rejected by them when submitted, the
eommitteemen have been conferring with
the members of the municipal body with
a view to finding what they would favor.
It is not expected that any of the recom
mendations which the committee will
submit will be overlooked by the City
Trustees, but to insure harmony the
eommitteemen have taken them into their
confidence.
It is generally understood that Manager
Kruttschnitt will be /satisfied with twenty
five-year franchises and that the Southern
Pacific Company will concede the estab
lishment of a two and a half cent fare
within the city limits. What has stumped
the Southern Pacific officials thus far in
the negotiations is'the stiff demand made
by the committee that the company be
required to pay Into the city treasury a
certain fixed amount for the privileges
conveyed in the franchises.
Upon Investigation it was found that
most of the commltteemen had other en
gagements for that^iour, and by the con
sent of both the representatives of Ala
meda and the Southern Pacific the con
ference went over until next Monday aft
ernoon at 1 o'clock. Manager Krutt
schnitt expects by that time to be in a
position to come to some definite conclu
sion with the committee so that body
can report back to the committee of fif
ty, which is to hold a session Monday
night.
Five of the executive committee, Chair
man Frank Otis, T. G. Danlells, Joseph
Knowland, Charles R. Smith and Major
Charles L Tllden, went to San Francisco
to meet Manager Kruttschnitt. Secretary
Charles S. Neal and S. M: Haslett were
absentees from the committee. After the
delegation reached Tilden's office Manager
Kruttschnitt . sent word that as he had
been ' unable to obtain certain figures
bearing on the traffic in Alameda, which
he Intended to use in his arguments with
the commltteemen; it would be impossible
for him to go until such time as he had
secured the data he wanted. He informed
the committee that he believed that he
would have the figures In the morning
and asked the members if they could as
semble in Tilden's office at 10 o'clock.
CONFERENCE POSTPONED.,
ALAMEDA, Aug. 7,â Manager Julius
Kruttschnitt ..was not prepared to-day to
confer with the executive â¢ committee of
the committee of fifty with respect to
the applications of the Southern Pacific
Company for two local franchises, and
this evening members of the committee
met and -informally discussed with the
City Trustees the result of the proceed
ings thus far and to ascertain the pulse
of the members of the municipal body as
to the probable stand they will take when
the committee of fifty submits its final
recommendations. r- >J Â¦ . Vv

Meat Market.
Â¦ Receipts of Potatoes were moderate and the
market- continued active at steady prices under
'a Kood demand, both- for local consumption
and shipping account. Several small consign
ments of Sweet Potatoes were received and sold
quickly at the previously quoted rates. The
crop of early Onions is almost exhausted In
some of the growing sections and receipts are
consequently light. The market ruled firm at
the recently advanced quotations.
There was not much change in vegetables.
Tomatoes arrived freely, but continued to meet
with a steady demand, and choice lots readily
commanded the top rate. The eight boxes of
bav Tomatoes that came in on Thursday were
sold at 65Â©75c per box. Choice Green Corn
was steady, but the receipts Included much
poor etock, which, dragged at the minimum
quotations. String, Wax and Lima Beans were
In ample supply, but moved off well at sus
tained prices. The market was still heavily
supplied with Cucumbers. Summer Squash,
Eggr Plant and Green Peppers, and dealers
were cutting prices in order to force sales.

NEW YORK STOCK LIST
Exchange and renewal of financial difficulties
there. Even this did not disturb the ap
parent equanimity of the market. The tone
was heavy and slugrgieh all day. but the char
acter of the market was very different from
the acute weakness shown in the later stages
of the recent decline. What the cause of the
improvement was did not become known, al
though rumors to account for the change were
abundant. It was believed that w-me large
settlements had been effected by the taking
over of Important holdings of various stocks
by private agreement, thus relieving some
weak .points in the situation. Yesterday's
demonstration of buying power was accepted
Â«Â« evidence that important financial interests
were prepared to afford support to the market
if necessary to prevent it running Into de
moralization. Yesterday's supposition that a
vigorous upward movement of prices had been
determined upon by the financial powers that
be was seen to be without foundation. But
this did not prevent a feeling of comfort over
the check to the headlong downward course
of prices and the consequent contraction of
credits, which was threatening disaster. One
of the developments of the day was a Btronger
tone in the foreign exchange market, which
seemed rapidly approaching the gold-import
point In the last two days. It is an anomaly
of the situation that the firmer tone of ex
change afforded some relief to sentiment. The
heavy offerings of the last few days have
not been against commercial export."", but have
been of bankers' loan bills, which it was
feared represented an urgent pressure for
credits that could not be satisfied at home.
The lighter offerings of this class of bills to
day was reviewed with satisfaction.
To-morrow's bank statement promises to
chow a email loss in cash, the receipts on
balance from the interior being so much
smaller than last week as not to wlpÂ« out the
lo?s by the banks to the sub-treasury of $3.
5UJ).OOO. It will be remembered that the banks
gained upward of $7,000,000 last week. The
outlook for loans is obscure and there is
nothing to indicate that the week'r liquida
tion in stocks will be any more reflected in
the loan item than was the disappointing case
last week.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 7.â Wheat had a. sharp set
back from the advance it made yesterday and
the market ruled weak the greater part of the
session.* Opening prices were weak on a Se
vere decline at Paris, together with excellent
harvest weather in the Northwest, and Sep
tember was off %c to #c at 79%@79%c. There
was quite general selling at the start, with
some of the- large commission houses and some
local longs prominent in that side of the mar
ket, and after touching 80c September started
on the down grade, and although there were
so me reactions the general t tendency < was
downward. The Northwest- and St. Louis
markets were lower, which added to the de
pression here. After selling down. to , : .78Hc
September rallied somewhat, but the close was
weak and %@?ic lower at 79%c, which, with
local receipts of 135 cars. 15 of contract grade,
made total receipts for the three points of 264
cars.
Notwithstanding the weakness j in . wheat,
corn prices held comparatively firm, but trad
ing was of small volume. The weather gen
erally was more favorable and the movement
was freer, cables were strong, and but for the
decline in wheat the market would have made
a good advance. After selling between 52c
and 62%c September closed unchanged at
62%c. < ,-Â¦ S Â¦ Â¦
Oats ruled fairly active and held steady in
spite of the weakness In wheat. Liberal ship
ments of contract oats - was a help to prices.
The close was steady, with 'September %o
lower at S4%c, after ranging between 34 %c
and 34t4c. - .- - .
Provisions sold off sharply early in the day,
duÂ« to offerings from outside sources and some
selling by packers, but later a fair demand de
veloped for lard and thd whole list responded
in the upturn. Trading was quiet .on the
whole. September pork closed 20c - rawer, at.
$13 27%; September lard was 2%c higher at
$7 92%, and September ribs were off 10c to
12%c at ?6 86@7 87%.

the other hand It was apparent lhat support
was forthcoralng for the market on declines
and there was no renewal of *.hÂ« tone of
demoralization such ea characterized, the mar

Even the resumption of liquidation In apots.
which *-as easily perceptible, was taken calmly
by the markK, which developed no appear

*Â«"!ling of tome of the Western grain-carriers,
New York Central and the cperlaltle:. Pres
rure was renewed on Vlnrlnia-Carrllnj Chem

has suffered exceedingly from lack of

signed them.

held a meeting last night and after much
discussion they adopted a set of resolu
tions. In which they state that from now
on all journeymen boatbuilders will have
to do the work assigned them by their
employers and there will be no such thing
as different trades under the head of boat
builders.
BOATBTJILDERS MUST DO
WORK ASSIGNED THEM

The Supervisors' street committee yes
terday recommended that an extension of
ninety days be granted to the Barber As
phalt Company within which to complete
its contract to widen and repave Third

plained the day before that the delay waa
ruinous to business objected to any ex
tension of time, but afterward consented.
In order to expedite, the 'work General
Manager Chapman stated that he had
ordered the cars to run out Mission street
and down Fourth to the depot until the
improvement is completed, j ,
.The committee also directed the corpor
ations maintaining poles on Third street
to remove and reset immediately such
poles as obstruct and impede the progress
of the work, and the gas and electric
company maintaining gas mains and elec
tric wire conduits between Brannan and
Townsend streets, on Third, to change the
location of the same. The Board of Pub
lic Works waa directed to see that the
provisions of the resolution' are carried
out. Gratz Brown of the Barber Asphalt

MAN ON HIS RETURN
"They laughed at me," said Welch,
"and when I again asked them if they In
tended to move on they walked across the
street and stood laughing at me. I went
across to them, and knowing that they
would return as soon as I went away I
asked If they intended to move on, if not
I would arrest them. Cornelius said in a
sneering way, *Oh. no, you won't.' and I
at once placed him and Kean under ar
rest."
Cornelius said that when the officer
asked them to move on he and Kean
walked to the'edge of the sidewalk. When
he again requested them to move on they
walked across the street, and were sur
prised when he followed them and placed
them under arrest.
Richard Cornelius, president of the Car

released on $5 cash bail each.
The officer says that Cornelius and
Kean were standing in front of the em
ployment office of Murray & Ready, 634
Clay street, talking with three other men.
They were blocking the sidewalk and he
asked them to move on. The three men
did so, but Cornelius and Kean did not
move. Welch again asked them to move
on, and they stepped to the edge of the
sidewalk.

to Russia. Upon her departure on the
long trip she says she received assur

abroad he wrote her. several letters ap
pealing to her- to return and become his
wife. Finally succumbing to his entreat

ever accompanied Dillard to the races.
He confessed that many times Dillard
was not in his office and that the file
room was not closed to very many peo
ple. The following cross-examination by
Shortrldge brought the witness very near
the edge of ill temper and developed the
fact that the rumor of scandal in the
office of Collector Lynch had appeared
before Dillard's alleged crime:
"Did you ever tell Mr. Dillard that to hasten
the making out of certificates he would get $5?"
"Two years ago a- newspaper reporter told
me that complaint" had come in that Dillard
was charging $5 for making out certificates.
I told Dillard that if there was a scandal he
would leave the office."
"Did not MUs Monnet receive a dollar once
for ctrlklng out a clause in an affidavit?"
"She did not." _ .âÂ« " ,.
"Did not Dr. Gardner once offer $25 to Mr.
Dillard for the purpose of hastening thÂ« mak
ing out of some papers?"
"Not to my knowledge."
A. L. Farlsh, Chief Deputy United
States Marshal, testified to the efforts
leading -to Dillard's arrest.
The case will be resumed on Monday.

Gardner's name Is fresh in the public
press owing to the recent disclosures in
reference to the Copper King Company,
of which he was a prominent stockholder.
W. H. Daly, who a few months ago sud
denly disappeared from his haunts around
the Palace and who was manager of the
Copper King Company mine, was a friend
of Gardner and was sent out by the latter
to superintend the mine. Sir Christopher
Furness. an EnpMsh stockholder, sent oujt
experts to examine the-mine, and as a re
pult of their report Daly was to have been
railed upon to resign. He took time by
the forelock and disappeared. Sir Chris

men are said to have lost thousands of
dollars In their investment in the Copper

his racing colors are a familiar sight both
on the English and French racetracks.
His trainer, Eugene Leigh, in France is

Carri*- Swain was married to Frank

THOMAS GETS UNEASY.
On cross-examination Burt Thomas,
This encomium, rendered in a strong
North German accent, was part of the
expert testimony/of Carl Eisenschimmel
given upon the alleged forgeries of Wil
liam, H. Dillard in the United States Dis
trict Court yesterday afternoon. Not half
so exhilarating is John Lynch's capital
C as the "dissertation on chlrography with
which Expert Eisenschimmel regaled
Judge and jury before the bar of justice.
The handwriting expert, called to the
stand by Attorney Woodworth, took the
chair with a mien of carefully repressed
erudition. Scarcely had the attorney for
the prosecution ventured a question when
the Drofessor uncorked the vials of his
knowledge, and attorneys, witnesses and
even his Honor on the dais had to seek
high places above the flood.
"Are those signatures on the fourteen
Chinese certificates I hand you and upon
the alleged spurious letter genuine or
fraudulent?" inquired Attorney Wood
worth In a tense whisper. The expert
waved at some charts.
LETTEBS HAVE PENDULUMS.
"Why those- are clumsy and amateurish
forgeries. Upon three points, first â â "
' "Are those charts there enlargements
of photographs or photographs of en
largements or enlarged photographs of
photographs?" broke in Attorney Short
ridge for the defense.
"On three points, first the signatures
of Mr, Lynch as supposed to be penned
by Mr. Dillartl have entirely different
muscular co-ordination."
Professor Eisenschimmel held up a pro
testing finger when Woodworth attempt
ed to stop him. . â¢
"Now on the upward strokes of the l's
and the capital J there is a' pendulum."
Mr. Shortrldge broke in with a suave
smile.
"I would like to ask the District At
torney if the witness said a 'pendulum'
or an 'apnendix?' "
His Honor breasted the rising storm.
He said:
"Mr. Shortridge, if I, may observe, you
have by this time interposed enough ob
jections to counsel's questions and wit
ness' answers to cover any possible tech
nicality."
"But what I desire to know, if it please
your Honor," responded the ever ready
oounsel for defense, "Is this regular testi
mony?"
"It is."
"Then may I retire?" pleaded Short
ridge.
Disorder resigned for a few moments,
but the upshot of it all was that the
professor pronounced, both as an expert
and as a private citize'n. that the signa
tures submitted to him by Attorney
Woodworth . were manifest forgeries.
Shortrldge will cross-examine him, on
Monday. ...
"Collector Lynch's capital C is brim
ming over with life and animal spirits
vigorous, exhilarating." >Â¦
James E. Truax, a barber at 7 Stock

Elizabeth Richards', who is suing for di
vorce Alexander . O. Richards, re
cently comDromised his contest of the
Â¦will of his aunt, Caroline E. Cogswell, for
$10,000, petitioned the Superior Court yes
terday to set aside her default to Rich
ards' cross-complaint. In an affidavit
made by R. C. Porter,, her attorney, and
filed with the petition, the statement is
made that Charles H. Bane, ; Richards'
attorney, failed to keep his promise to
allow Mrs. Richards further time in
which to answer, and entered her default.
Porter claims that Bane made the prom
ise upon his oath as a member of a secret
order, and that therefore the entering of
the, default was a breach of faith.

A. Juchemich a divorce from John H.
Juchemich for cruelty.
Corienne A. .Bartlett, who was married
to Ward S. . Bartlett at Honolulu, Decem
ber 17, 1893, sued him for divorce yester
day. She sues on three grounds, namelyâ
cruelty, intemperance and failure to pro
vide. For more than the year last past,
she says, he has by reason of his intem
perance, failed to provide for her and that
during that time he has added to her
misery by cursing and abusing her and
accusing her of being an unfaithful wife.
