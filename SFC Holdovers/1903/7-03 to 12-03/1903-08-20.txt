HISTOBY.OF FLAGS.
Stewart arrived at the reviewing stand
on Van Ness avenue he found that Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles bad preceded him.
General Stewart gave General Miles a
cordial greeting and told him to consider
that he was an honored guest.
When General John C. Black marched
past Che reviewing stand with the Illinois
Department the commander in chief left
the platform and hurried along the ave
nue and overtook General Black. He
took his comrade by the arm and escorted
him .back to the reviewing stand amid
thundering applause.
In line was George H. Thomas Post No.
5 of Chicago, fifty-four marching, and
after them came sixty-four members of
Ulysses S. Grant Post No. 28 of Chicago.
There were veterans from Pike County,
Springfield and Quincy, 111. Some marched
arm in arm, some carried umbrellas at a
carry, some were weighted down with
years and carried heavy canes to help
them in the march.
Major General MacArthur, commander
of* the Department of California, marched
at the head of the Wisconsin 'veterans.
He was in civilian uniform and no one.
unless he knew him. would have pointed
him out as the distinguished soldier that
he Is. At his side were General Lyon,
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin, and General Amos Cobb. ex-
Chlef Justice of the Supreme Court of
Nebraska. Commander J. P. Rundle was
tn charge of the contingent and be had
Captain Henry of Eau Claire as his aid.
Thirty-five battle flags wera carried by
the Pennsylvania representatives. All
along the line of march the precious
relics of the great war were viewed witn.
interest. They formed a hollow square
and were guarded by 500 soldiers from the
department. The history of these flags
entitled them to the ovation they received
as they were borne aloft by the proud
color guard. Post No. Z of Philadelphia,
one of the largest In the department,
whose members have attended all the Na
tional Encampments, and who in the
early days of the organization appeared
before the national body to exemplify tha
work of the order, sent twenty battle
flags. General E. D. Baker Pest No. 8.
another crack post, Contributed twelve
battle flags. Members of Post No. l^S of
Allegheny City marched with three batilo
flags. A Union bunting flag was carried
aloft and attracted lots of attention. It
was taken from the knapsack of a dead
Confederate at Fort Hudson. The knap
sack was burning and the flag was
slightly scorched. The flags were carried
by th# boys from the Keystone -State and
proved an attractive feature of th* pa
rade.
Mrs. Eleanor Martin Entertains tha

General Nelson A. Miles was the guest
of honor at an elaborate dinner last night,
given by Mrs. Eleanor Martin at her res
idence at 2M0 Broadway. The beautiful
home was magnificently decorated witn
American flags, arranged in a most artis
tic manner. . â¢
The banquet board was decked wltn
American Beauty roses, Intermingled wltn
the stars and stripes. Shimmering glass
ware and rare old silver added to the or
nateness of the general embellishment.
General Miles was in a fine vein of
humor and at the request of his hostess
gave a graphic description of his tour
around the world.
Those invited to meet the distinguished
visitor were Colonel and Mrs. Walter 8.

THE Nelson A. Miles Command
No. 244. Spanian War Veterans,
held a rousing reception at
Pythian Castle last night. Gen
eral Miles was the guest oC
honor. The hall was crowded to suffo
cation with artmirera of the .retired com
mander In chief of the United States
army. The general had previously ac
cepted an Invitation to dine with some
former comrades and friends, and It was
after 10 o'clock when he entered the hall.
He was accompanied by General G. W.
Baird and Colonel H. H. Adams. AÂ» the
distinguished party passed down the cen
ter aisle the Immense throne arose and
cheered the general over and over again,
and It was a long time before Captain
Curaon could auiet the enthusiastic as
semblage and formally Introduce the
guest of honor.
As the general stepped forward he re
ceived a .tremendous ovation. His speech
mainly dwelt upon the subject of citizen
ship and loyalty to the flag. He said tn
part:
Another event of special Interest was
the reception given In the parlors of the
Lick Houe(S by the Woman's Relief Corps,
Department of Washington and Alaska,
assisted by the commanders of the G. A.
R. of the same department. A feature
of the .affair was a well-selected musical
programme rendered by Professor H. T.
Worbes of Spokane and Mrs. Burnett of
Berkeley.
Governor Pardee and his staff, In car
riages, endeavored to make the* rounds of
all the social gatherings, but for want of
time failed to reach a number of them.
At those he did visit he was received with
all the attention due Jhe chief represen
tative of California.
Hardly had the national officers arrived
and taken their seats on the floral deco
rated platform before the presence of
Governor Pardee and his military staff
was formally announced. Both the Gov
ernor and Adjutant General Stone ad
dressed the assemblage, and in the course
of their remarks etrongly emphasized the
cordial feeling that the State and city
entertains for its distinguished visitors.
As the Chief Executive of the State bade
his adieu and passed out of the hall tho
audience rose and accorded him an enthu
siastic ovation.
Nearly all the department headquarters
wtie converted Into places of reception
and entertfc"fciment last evening, and be
tween the hours of 8 and 10 they were
thro:ieed with well-gowned women and
their escort*. In all there were sixty-one
1 unctions in full swing at the same hours.
More notable of these special events
wits the reception And entertainment
jriven by the Ladles of the G. A. R.. De
partment of California, In honor of the
national officers of the organization, at
I'tilon Square Hall, the seating capacity
of which was hardly equal to the occa
sion. Department President Mrs. M. J.
Griffiths presided and delivered the ad
dress of welcome, to which Mrs. Anna
Hall, the national president, responded.
Recitations and music combined to make
the evenings entertainment a delightful
one.
Social Functions Bound Out the Day
of Celebration.
FETE NIGHT OF VISITORS.
General Stewart offered the Woman's
Relief Corps his heartiest felicitations
and expressed his gratitude for the honor
extended him by the corps.
Then the Knickerbocker Quartet Eang
and an orchestra played spirited music.
The entire scene was animated, patriotic
and dignified, with the prevailing spirit
of love of country and respect and admi
ration for the nation's guardians of 1S61-
C5.
In the midst of a presentation a cheer
went up at the doors and then a volley
of cheers echoed throughout the build
ing, the outburst of enthusiasm being for
Governor Pardee as he entered, led by
General Stone and followed by his aides
de-camp.
When the general took his position bo

bearing the inscription. "Woman's

golden electric lighted bulbs, the who'.e of

officials here regard the arrest of Ger
man and other merchants at Cludad'Bol

Castro's demand for the repayment of
taxes already paid to the late Insurgent

also believed that President Caatro will
no doubt cause the release of the prison

convention Is scheduled to convene at
9:30 o'clock this mcrnins a^d will be called
to order by the commander in chief. Gen
eral Stewart. It has been a rule of the
convention for a number of years to
v*aive the calling of the roll of delegates,
end It Is probable that there will be no
departure from this custom to-day. A
prayer offered by the chaplain In chief
will be followed Immediately by the re
ceiving of reports from the various na
tional officers, the commander in chief
reading his and the other officers, includ
ing the chairman of the different stand
ing: committees, submitting theirs in
printed form.
Then will follow the appointing, by
General Stewart, of a committee on rules
and regulations, of which the chairman
will no doubt be former Commander in
Chief Robert Beath of Philadelphia, who
has held the position for about twenty
four years.
WILL APPOINT OFFICERS.
It is expected that this business will
consume the greater part of the forenoon
session, and at the call to order in the
afternoon the convention â¢will proceed at
ence to the election of officers, five of
whom are to be chosen as follows: Com
mander in chief, senior vice commander
in chief, junior vice commander in chief,
chaplain in chief and surgeon in chief.
The other national officers, including ad
jutant general, quartermaster general, in
spector general, judge advocate general,
tenior aid de camp and chief of staff and
assistant adjutant general and the chair
men cf the different national committees,
are appointive and will be selected later
in the day by the new commander.
As yet nothing has arisen to suggest
any opposition to the election of General
Flack by acclamation and the election of
Colonel C. Mason Kinne of this city to
the position of senior vice commander in
< hief is certain, although a number of
friends of General Shafter, who recall
Colonel Kinne's opposition to the depart
ment commander's recent candidacy,
have been threatening to spring another
local candidate for the second position in
< ommand. After the election of officers
is disposed of the convention will settle
Â¦'own to the consideration of various bus
tsen matters. Among the national offi
ers it is thought that the session will be
,>. s-liort one. The most important matter
â¢â¢-..it will come vp for consideration will
â¢ the selection of a plac* for encamp
ment r.rxt year and it is regarded as al
most a foregone conclusion that Boston
Â¦rill be chosen.

So uniformly successful has Dr. Pierce't
Favorite Prescription proven in all forms
of Female Weakness, Prolapsus, or Falling
of Womb, and Lencorrhea, that, after over
a third of a century's experience in curing
the wont cases of these distressing and
debilitating ailments'. Dr. Pierce now feels
fully warranted in offering to pay $500 in
cash for any case of these diseases which
he cannot cure.
It Stands Aloxe. â The "Favorite Pre-
scription" stands alone, as the one and
only remedy for these distressingly com-
mon forms of weakness, possessed of such
positively specific curative properties as to
warrant its makers in proposing:, and
binding themselves to forfeit, as we, the
undersigned proprietors of that wonderful
remedy hereby do, to pay the sum of $500
in legal money of the United States in any
case of tbe above diseases in which after a
fair and reasonable trial of onr treatment,
we fail to cere. No other medicine for
the core of woman's peculiar ailments is
backed by such a remarkable guarantee ;
no other medicine for woman's ills is pos-
sessed of the unparalleled curative prop-
erties that would warrant its manufacturers
in making such an offer ; no other remedy
has sneb a record of cure* on which to base
such a remarkable offer.
Therefore, insist on having Dr. Pierre's
Favorite Prescription and turn your bacic
on any unscrupulous dealer who would
insult your intelligence by attempting; to
foist upon yon some inferior substitute,
under the plea that "it is jnst as good."
Insist on having the article which has a
record of a third of a century of cures and
which is backed by those willing to forfeit
$500 if they cannot cure you.
In cases attended by a lencorrbeal drain

S BOGOTA.. Colombia, Friday. Aug. 14.â
A bill is ready authorizing the Govern

the United States upon a fixed basis and
also providing for modifying the national
constitution.

majority of tne band escaped.
partment circles the news that the Co
lombian Congress intends to ratify the
canal treaty Mn an amended form or to
propose a ;new treaty is not regarded as
changing the* situation at Bogota. It has
all along been declared, both at the State
Department and the "White House, that
substantial- amendment of the treaty In
any part would mean its death. There is
no indication here that this view is not
still held by the President and Secretary
Hav.
Information received by Dr. Herran, the
Colombian Charge d'Affaires here, Indi
cates an intention on the part of the
Colombian Senate to resume considera
tion of the subject of a Panama canal
.treaty in place of the one disapproved by
that body on the 12th inst. This shows
a decided change in the turn of events
and leads Herran to hope that a meas
ure yet will be passed by the Colombian
Congress which will form the basis for
the ratification of a treaty between the
United States of Colombia and the United
States of America for the construction of
an Isthmian canal. Dr. Herran's infor
mation is that on the 13th Inst., the day
after the disapproval of the treaty by
the Senate, that body voted to appoint
a committee of three members to act
jointly with a committee from the House
of Representatives for the formation of
a measure having for its object the rati
fication, of a treaty between the two
countries by the executive of Colombia
after the two houses of the Colombian
Congress have passed an enabling act out
lining the terms and conditions on which
a treaty should be drawn. The President
of Colombia by this act would have full
power in the premises and the treaty
would not have to be afterward sub
mitted to -the Coiomblan Congress.
Dr. Herran was not surprised at the
news. He admitted that the previous ca
blegram announcing the rejection of the
treaty contained the words: "Another
proposition is under consideration." Dr.
Herran, after further reading of the ca
blegram announcing rejection now con
tends that the Spanish word used should
be translated "disapproved," rather than
"rejected." Of the news from Bogota to
night Dr. Herran said:
! This shows that the Senate has not aban
doned the idea of canal leglslat on of some sort
at its present session. I take It that the con
ference committee will asree upon^modifications
to the Hay-Herran treaty, which the Colom
bian Coneress will Insist upon, and that the
canal bill will be passed incorporating the pro
visions of the canal treaty which are satisfac
tory to Congress, and empowering; the President
to ratify such treaty.

In the meantime tne Russian squadron
will not proceed to Constantinople, as has
been reported, but will rendezvous at the

above the' entrance of the Bosphorus.
For the present this squadron has no or
ders to assume an aggressive course. Its
action will depend on Turkey's fulfillment
of the t*rms of Russia's final demands
In connection with the assassination of
Consul Rostkovski: The punishment of
a number of the persons implicated Is
not considered to be full compliance with
the terms of the demands, which include
an adequate indemnity.
Besides the Rostkovski incident, the
proposed joint naval action before Sa
lonica Is due to the. earnest representa
tions of the foreign Consuls at Salonica,
who set forth that their lives are In dan
ger. The first representation on the sub
ject reached the French authorities sev
eral weeks ago, and since then other Con
suls have made similar representations.
The assassination of M. Rostkovski is
giving such emphasis to the statements
of the Consuls that consideration of a
joint naval demonstration of sufficient
strength to Impress Turkey with the nec
essity for taking decisive action looking
to the maintenance of order in Macedo
nia is now In progress. The exchange of
communications has shown that Russia
and Austria continue to co-operate fully
In the action taken toward Turkey.
PARIS, Aug. 19.â It was learned In offi
cial Quarters to-day that the action of
Russia in ordering a naval squadron to
Turkish waters may be speedily followed
by an important joint naval action on
the part of the powers. Communications
are at present being: exchanged between
the powers relative to a Joint naval dem
onstration before Salonica. The final de
termination will depend largely on Rus
sia, but if a joint demonstration shall be
determined on the fleets of France and
Austria will certainly co-operate and it
Is probable that the fleets of all the Eu

them and without the assistance of
sperm. He reasoned that artificial par
thenogenesis might be practiced on the
eggs of other animals and set to work
on experiments with the result that his
efforts were justified. His most success
ful experiments were carried on with lim
peta found at Pacific . Grove, from the
eggs of which he produced the young..
The results of Dr. Loeb's experiments
and hla. observations upon them- are con
tained In a bulletin issued at the Univer
sity of California to-day. It reads as fol
lows:
After the discover!' of the fact that the un
fertilized eggs of a sea urchin can be caused
to develop by merely extracting water from
them and without the addition of sperm tho
question arose whether artificial Partheno
genesis is confined to a few species or whether
it Is as general as the phenomenon of sexual
reproduction Itself. If the latter could be
shown to be the case it would be of importance
In two directions. It would suggest the possi
bility that the artificial physical or . chemical
me an> by which the unfertilized eggs can be
caused to develop have something in . common
with the means by which the *perra causes
the development of the eggs. Thus the ex
periments on artificial parthenogenesis might
pave the way for the solution of the problem
of fertilization. Second, if it be possible ever
to gain any positive evidence for ablogenesls
the experiments on artificial parthenogenesis
may have sonw bearing on this problem.
It can, of course, not be expected that the
eggs of each* of the numerous forms of ani
mals can bâ¬#txamlned in regard to the possi
bility of artificial parthenogenesis. If it can
only be shown that the eggs of each form on,
which the experiment has been tried can be
caused to develop without sperm by physical
or chemical means we may conclude with some
probability that the eggs of the animals of the
same group not yet tested would behave in the
same way, although the technical difficulties
may be greater in one form than in another.
The forms thus far experimented upon aa
belong to two groups, echinoderms and anne
lids. No species of these two groups whose
eggs have been subjected to the test for arti
ficial parthenogenesis have proved refractory.
I had long Intended to see whether the unfer
tilized eggs of mollusks could not be caused by
physico-chemical means to develop, but at
Wood's Holl no forma with separate sexes
were obtainable. Meanwhile Arlola reported,
that he had tried In vain at Naples to produce
artificial parthenogenesis In a mollusk. "Den
talium Entails." It must be said, however,
that this author, through a blunder on his.
part did not use the right solutions, and hence
his experiments could not be successful. Pro
fessor Kostaneckl recently published a short
paper announcing that he had succeeded In
producing the first segmentations in a mol
lusc, "Mactra." by the method employed by
me on sea urchins. The fact that he did not 1
succeed in causing the eggs i to reach the
larval stage he ascribed to the possibility that
he did not use the optimal concentration for
thla form.
I have recently had an opportunity to try
some experiments on the limpets at Pacific
Grove, namely. "Lottia glgantea" (owt limpet)
and three other limpets, some or all of which
are species of Acmaea. In each of these forma
I iucceeded in producing swimming larvae
from the unfertilized eggs by submitting them
for two hours to sea water the concentration of
â¢which had been tncreaaed by the addition of
potassium chlortde or sodium chloride. The
optimal concentration differs somewhat for
each species. In from two to three hours after
the eggs were taken out of the hypertonic so
lutions and nut back into normal sea water
segmentation beiran. which waÂ» very regular
at least in the two and 'our cell stages. For
the eight cell stase I did not obtain
any satisfactory observations. In from
twenty to twenty-four hour* swimming
larvae were found. In most cases the Utter
developed within forty-elsht hours; la one
species only <!ld I fin<* larvae which showed a
tendency to live longer, fteath was caused or
at least accompanied by a tendency of the cella
to fall apart and to disintegrate. In older cul
tures were found a comparatively large num-
What the cause of this disintegration was I
am not yet able to state. It iÂ» probable that
the eggs had not yet reached their full matur
ity at the time of my experimentation. I am
inclined to conclude this from the fact that I
did not succeed In fertillxtn* the eggs of "Lot
tla" (on which the majority of experiments
were carried out) wtth sperm of their own or
any other species. It Is perhaps worthy of
note that the Â«K83 which could -not bÂ£ fer
tilized with sperm could be caused to develop
by a physical agency such as the extraction of
water from the egg. This refractory behavior
of the eggs toward sperm was in one rÂ»spect
welcome in these experiments, aa it added to
the feeling of security that the precautions
against thÂ«. contamination of the eggs with
sperm were adequate.' In the control experi
ments no segmented egg or swimming larvae
was found. ..... .- .
Treatment of the eggs with acid led only to
a beginning of segmentation. Mechanical agi
tation as far as tried had no effect. I can
therefore state that on the basis of these ex
periments and taollusks may now be added to
the list of animals in which it is possible by
physico-chemical means to cause the unfer
tilized eggs to develop Into- swimming Urvaa.
The experiments will be continued.
The general consensus of opinion among
the diplomatists Is that there is nothing
in the present situation' to warrant the be
lief that it will -develop Into a general
conflagration, as the powers are co-oper
ating generally to preserve the- peace -of
Europe. The situation in the Far. East,
especially the national agitation in Jap
an, Is regarded "by some diplomats as be
ing as threatening as the Balkan situa
tion. The Japanese officials hardly at
tempt to conceal their, belief that their
Government would act 'in the Far East

embroilment of Russia in the*Balkans.
Dispatches received to-day from Yoko

which they - have hitherto observed re

of Russia. Both the papers mentioned are
newspapers of moderate tone.
sador here to-day received a dispatch
from Rome that an Italian
squadron had been ordered to- Macedonian
water to "watch events." No explanation
was given of the reasons underlying the
orders and the embassy officials were/un
able to say whether it was a result of
Russia sending a- squadron to Turkish
waters. It was regarded as probable that
the Foreign Office had received advices
showing that Italian interests, which are
important at Salonica and In its . neigh
borhood, are menaced and that it was
deemed wise to have a strong force handy
to convince the Turks of the inadvlsabil
lty of affecting such interests by any hos
tile act. It was added that the presence
of the Italian fleet would deter the Turks
from committing outrages on Inoffensive
Christians. '

to humor them in order to prevent con

templates making still more Important de
mands than contained in the recent note
of M. Zlnovoff, the Russian Embassador,
such as the appointment of a Christian
Governor General of Macedonia. This
idea, however, does not find Support In
diplomatic quarters, where the convic
tion prevails that Russia is working In
full agreement with Austria. Turkey is
expected to accept the Russian demands,
with the possible exception of the ap-'
poJntment of European officers to com
mand the gendarmerie. This Is likely to
arouse opposition and it is believed that
Russian anticipation thereof led to the
dispatch of the squadron, the presence of

The remeasurement was made at the
request of Sir Thomas Lipton.â The dif
ference In the measurement was caused
by the lowering of .the throat halyard
block three feet, thus adding to the length
of the topmast and decreasing the sail
area..
Secretary George McCormack was asked
to-night if the measuring was the result
of any dissatisfaction on the part of Sir
Thomas Lipton with the figures obtained
by Mr. Mower.
"Not at all," said Mr. McCormacki
"simply Sir Thomas altered his boat by
lowering the throat halyard block. He
then asked , for a remeasurement and got
It. That's all."
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.-H was an
nounced at the New York Yacht
Club late to-night that C. D.
Mower, the official measurer, had
remeasured Sir Thomas Lipton's chal
lenger, Shamrock III, off Sandy Hook to
day and that as a consequence the chal
lenger will be in receipt of an additional
allowance of twelve seconds In the races,
making a total allowance of one minute
and fifty-seven seconds, against the pre
vious estimate of one minute and forty
five seconds.
The new measurement revealed the fact
that a mistake' had been made in measur
ing the length of the topmast. When
Mr. Mower ran his tape over the vessel
again to-day he found the throat halyard
block was three feet lower than . his
figures of yesterday showed. This made
the length of the topmast greater by
three feet, reducing 1 the size of the main
sail and thus decreasing the sail area.
The new measurement brings the racing
length of the Shamrock III down to 104.4
Instead of 104.77; ecual to a time allow-,
ance of twelve seconds.
"There never was any Jockeying. I do
not consider it an honest way of getting
people to bet their money. Except in a
few cases when Mr. â¢Fife has wanted to
sail alongside of the Shamrock I we have
always done the best we could, and I have
always wanted to see her do ifer best."
Sir Thomas, added Jokingly: "The Sham
rock III will win the first race by either
six or seven minutes. I'm not quite cer
tain which; the second race by four min
utes and a half. You will have to ask me
about the third race later."
A flood of letters, cablegrams and tele
grams reached the Erin to-day from all
parts of the world, bringing wishes' for
the success of Sir Thomas and the Sham
rock III. One cablegram came from
Images, Portugal, from Lord Charles
Beresford, saying all the officers and men
of the channel fleet sent hearty good
wishes and hoped to hear the Shamrock
III had won by a length. Other.mes
sages came from the Durban Yachting
Club of South Africa; the Yacht Racing
Association of Perth, Western Australia;
the Royal Yacht Squadron of New, Zeal
and, and from nearly every yacht club
In Canada.
Among the notables who will probably
â¢be guests of Sir Thomas on the Erin dur
ing the races are Adjutant General and
Mrs. Corbin; Paymaster General Bates,
U. 8. A.; Hon. Charles Russell; Captain
Brownson, commander of the Naval Acad
emy; General and Mrs. Chaffee, Mr. and
Mrs. tJohn D. Crimmlns, Mr. and Mrs. T.
A. Edison,' Mrs. Jefferson Davis Hayes
Jr. and Mrs. John A. Flagler, Senator and
Mrs. Kearns of Utah, Governor Odell;
Lady Sweetenham,- wife of the Governor
of the Straits ' Settlement; â¢ Lieutenant
Commander Isani T. Takeshlka of the
Japanese â¢ Navy, former Lieutenant Gov
ernor Woodruff, Commander John C.
Cameron,' captain, of the Oceanic," and
Captain McKlnstrey of the Teutonic. â¢
In reply to a question whether or not
there was any basis for suspicion that
the challenger had not been permitted to
show all her speed in her trials with the
Shamrock I, Sir Thomas said: â¢ V
. receive the Earl and Countess of
Shaftsbury and others" of Sir" Thomas'
guests from the Oceanic, after which she
returned to Sandy Hook with Sir Thomas
and the party on board and lay there dur
ing 1 the night. C. Oliver Iselin, the man
aging member of the Reliance syndicate,
and his advisers passed the night on
board the Reliance's tender, Sunbeam, at
anchor near the Reliance.
When asked for a prophecy of the result
of to-morrow's race. Sir Thomas said:
"I am more- confident of winning than
ever. My confidence is shared by every
man on the fleet and other admirers of
the Shamrock III. Designer Fife is sat
isfied with the tuning up that the Sham
rock III has received and Captain Wringe
is confident." ...

Sir ' Thomas Will En

Guests.
In neither of his previous attempts to
carry off the precious "mug" did Sir
Thomas sail . on a challenger. To-night
he was in doubt whether to sail in the
challenger to-morrow. His friends on the
Erin urged him not to do so for fear of
an accident. According to the rules the
first race will be fifteen nautical miles to
windward or leeward and return, depend
ing upon the direction of the wind. After
that . each alternate race will be over a
triangular course, ten miles to the leg.
The next race will be sailed on Saturday
and the. third next Tuesday and thereaft
er every other day until the series Is com
pleted. The winner of three out of five
will be the victor. According to the
rules if the course is not covered within
the time allowance, five and a half
hours, it is do race.
The weather prediction for to-morrow
is not alluring, the forecaster promising
a breeze of from three to nine knots. A
seven-knot breeze will be necessary to
carry the boats over the course in the al
lotted time. For the first time the chal
lenger and defender to-day sailed in'com
pany off Sandy Hook, when both boats
were taken out for final trial ppins. Some
observers thought the Shamrock III
heeled a little more and seemed to carry a
larger stern wave,
The, Reliance was, first to get away from
her mooring within the Horseshoe and
passed out by the point of the Hook at
10 a. m. There was a fine ten-knot' breeze
from the .Â¦ south-southeast and, sailing
close hauled, she went out through the
main' ship channel and Georges channel
to the* Sandy Hook lightship, about eight
miles, at a fast pace.
Shamrock III left Sandy Hook fifteen
minutes later and 1 , followed the defender
out through the channel to the lightship.
Both yachts carried lower sails' and club
topsails. The Reliance turned" at the
lightship and ran back toward the chan
nel, meeting the Shamrock III on the
way out. The two - yachts passed / each
other at a distance of a mile. Shamrock
III proceeded as far as the lightship, hove
to and waited the arrival of the Oceanic,
bound in, and then followed the big liner
in under mainsail a/id Jib. ; ;
The Earl and Countess of Shaftesbury,
the, latter of whom was sponsor for the
Shamrock HI at her launching, were on
board the Oceanic, and as the big steamer
passed the crew of the Shamrock cheered
the Countess. Both of the yachts re
turned to their moorings at Sandy Hook
after having been absent an hour and' a
quarter, the Reliance reaching hers about
fifteen minutes- in, advance of the Sham
rock. For the: remainder of the day bÂ»th
boats swung at their moorings, while the
crew overhauled their, sails and got every
thing in readiness for the race..
Like greyhounds in leash, the big racers
are moored to-night inside Sandy Hook
ready for the fray to-morrow. Both were
given their final trial spins to-day. De
spite the big time allowance the defender
must concede to the challenger, the
friends of the Reliance are extremely con
fident that Sir Thomas is again doomed
to defeat. The confidence in the Ameri
can boat is reflected in the betting, where
the odds are 2 to 1 on the Reliance. The
friends of the British boat, on the other
hand, profess the greatest faith in the
ability of Fife"s latest creation to "lift
the cup." *
which ever witnessed an International
cup race will go out to witness the initial
race for the blue ribbon of the sea. *As
in the two preceding series, the Govern
ment-will police the course with revenue
cutters and the most stringent rules will
be laid down to prevent interference by
the excursion fleet with the big single
stickers.
ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J., Aug. 19. â Sir Thomas Lipton came down on the Erin
to-day. He said late this evening : "I feel more sure of beating them than I did last night.
I believe we will win without the necessity of our time allowance. I feel confident that to
morrow Shamrock III will mark the first step toward lifting the cup."
Sir Thomas said he had received cablegrams of hope that he would "lift the cup" from Ad
miral Lord Charles Beresford and Vice Admiral and commanding officers of the Channel squad
ron at Lagos, from the Natal Yacht Club at Durban, from the Royal Yacht â¢ squadron in New
Zealand and from the Yacht Racing Association of Europe.

HOTEL DIRECTORS HOLD
AJT EXCITING V MEETING
Police Officer Is Summoned and Sits
at Door Expecting to Be

SAN JOSE, Aug. 19.â There was a big
row at the meeting of the directors of
the Hotel Vendome to-day and so fierce
did the argument become that a police
officer was summoned, and for several
hours he sat at the door, waiting to be
called. Gus Lion, one of the directors,
objected to the dividend which was re
cently declared and wanted a statement
of the hotel's business. He contended
that the hotel debts should be paid be
fore a dividend. This precipitated the
trouble.
L'. Lion, a well known banker of this
tity and father of Gus Lion, "sided with
his son at the election of directors. Later
Gus Lion was. unseated as a director and
J. H. Hendry elected In his place: L.
Lion denounced the directors in, strong
terms and threatened to throw them all
out of the rQpm. i
Then It was that President Joseph

Finally a recess was taken In order to
quiet things. L. Lion declared he would

AH the old board of directors and offi

One veteran in the Nebraska contin
gent proved himself an old campaigner.
He carried a campstool under his! arm
and every time the long column came
to a halt he would give the signal > to
pause and with dignity he would unfold
his campstool and seat himself. He look
ed so comfortable while seated under the
triumphal arch that one of his .comrades
fanned him. This action caused the spec
tators to laugh. Another veteran,, flifding
his shoes too tight, removed them and
slung them over his broom and marched
through the streets In his stocking feet.
This navel sight caused many smiles, but
the visitor from the pine woods of Michi
gan took no heed of the good natured
chaffing he received. A number of vet
erans were forced to leave the, ranks, at
the, safety station by reason of "their fee
bleness. They occupied the stone seats
and watched their comrades j pass, - ex
changing comments and applauding the
marchers. ; .â¢/Â¦Â¦Â¦
AN OLD CAMPAIGNER.
Probably the most striking incident of
the entire procession was the appearance
of two veterans from Virginia and North
Carolina, two States that seceded in 1861.

The Vermonters looked striking in their
evergreen adornments. There were many
in lino and the men from the maple su
gar State were loudly cheered. Seven
veterans carried letters which when read
in a line spelled out the nameof their
State. %
. M. \V. Cartwright, Chief of Police of
New. York, was mounted on Chief Witt
man's splendid horse, which the latter
loaned to the visitor. Chief Cartwright
keenly watched the manner in which the
local police handled the crowd and was
generous in his praise of the department.
John S. Coster was in - charge of the big
representation from the Empire State.
At the head of the Connecticut contin
gent was a standard bearer, who carried
a huge nutmeg. Behind him came a big
delegation. Many of the veterans carried
flowers which were presented to them
during the march by members of New
England societies who reside here.
Jerry Struntz, a veteran who haila'from
Pasadena, a member of the New York
regiment, Â¦ waited in a wheel chair to ac
company his comrades. Just as he was
being wheeled into line, the rubber tire
on his front wheel became dislodged and
for a few minutes it looked as if Struntz
would.be unable to appear in the parade.
A .bicycle expert in. -the crowd repaired
the wheel in quick time., -land happy
Struntz was wheeled along by. his com
rades. He was showered with bouquets
and he generously turned them over to
his comrades. . . â¢
At the, right of the first arch stood an
old lady 5 . She leaned against the wire
and won: the hearts of every one near
her by her kindly, nature. Even the big
blue-coated policeman exchanged chaff
with her and made her comfortable. The
old lady held a silken flag and as .the
brave boys of 1S61 passed her, she re
membered that her husband was one of
them and that her brothers had fought
under Old Glory and she waved the flag:
and smiled with happiness. Her cheeks
were stained with tears, but she did not
mind that people were looking at
All she wanted to do was to hare a

' State was on the march. The Third Ar
tillery band of the Presidio,- under the
leadership of Armand Putz., discoursed
patriotic music. The bandsmen captured
the prize for marching at the notable
I competition held in Salt Lake City a few
years ago and- the crowds easily distin
guished them to be regulars by the man
ner, in which they stepped out.
â¢-Memorial Post was headed by a pretty
little girl who rode a hdrse. On the. back
,of the maiden was a shield, containing
a splenuld ' picture of the late President

banners, and as they marched they sang
"John Brown's Body. 1 -', Mayor Warren
Olney or Oakland marched with this post

they made a creditable showing 1 .

DELEGRTES RUSH
FROM THE HALL
When the airbrakes were applied and
the wheels stopped at Mill Valley an ova
tion awaited those on board. From high
Tamalpais red fire burned and cast a
ruddy glow over the mountain top.
Everybody in the pretty little place was
Engineer Charles E. Stocker was at the
controller and Conductor George Lewis
was in charge of the train. From the
time the power was turned on the tars
moved smoothly considering the speed at
tained, and the stretch of country to Mill
Valley was covered In less than nine min
utes. There was not a single hitch or in
cident that would bring disappointment
to the company or to those who have con
ducted the work. Nor has there been any
thing of this nature since the first car
was sent over the rails lafet Saturday. The
train rode like a flash and as steadily as
a yacht In placid waters. The rumble
and jar that usually attend transporta
tion were not there. Nothing more per
fect than the operation of this train could
have been expected.
When the San Francisco party arrived
last night a train of five newly construct
ed cars was awaiting them at the ferry.
Among those who boarded tho train were
General Manager W. R. Rank, Assistant
Superintendent E. L. Braswell, General
Passenger Agent George W. Heintz, the
Boards of Trustees of San Rafael, Sausa
lito and Mill Valley and many railroad
and business men from the city. A sort
of generaj Invitation was then extended to
residents along the line and before "all
aboard" was shouted fully 200 passengers
occupied seats. President Johq 3 Martin
was unable to make the trip.
A PERFECT TRIAL TRIP.
For the last year and a half the work
of transforming the North Shore road
from a steam line to an electrical one be
tween San Rafael and Sausalito has been
In progress. A. H. Babcock. a man, of
wide experience and- knowledge of electric
roads, was placed in charge, and to him
is due most of the credit for the good re
sults that attended the maiden trip last
night. Babcock superintended the con
struction of the power-house, as well as
that of the road. He had new Ideas re
garding what was practical In undertak
ings of this sort and all of his plans
worked out so well that the road is con
sidered one of the most excellent of its
kind in the world. Â¦
Â¦ - *^ LECTRICITY as a factor in gen-
I j eral railroading was introduced
|\ into California for the first time
H *g] ast night. A train of five cars,
propelled by electric power and
laden with officials and Invited guests,
rode smoothly and swiftly over the rails
of the North Shore Company from Sau
salito to Mill Valley, and the trial was a
success In every particular. To-day reg
ular trips will be made over the com
pleted track and within one month steam
locomotives will be a thing of the past
between Sausalito and San Rafael.
The road will employ Its old engineers
as motormen.. The reason given- for this
is that they are acquainted , with trie
road and understand' the operation of the
air brakes perfectly. Each has' been
given thorough instructions, and many
are already competent. Many applica
tions for positions were made by San
Francisco streetcar, men but they were
rejected and the company will adhere
strictly to this rule. The equipment of
the road has been increased by 9. motor
cars and 25 new coaches and there are
more .to come. One of Babcock's most
capable assistants in s the work, of "con
struction was W. W. Mason,, formerly
with the Boston Elevated Railroad. He
is now foreman of the car shops. Frank
ENGINEERS AS MOTORMEN.
The road itself is a beauty. A third
rail runs adjacent to the track and this,
fed every 60 yards by aluminum wires,
contributes the fluid that operates the
train. The third rail is raised from the
ground and touches rods that extend from
the trucks of the cars. At crossings this
rail is so protected that no one may be
injured by It. In the open the road Is
fenced and large sign boards announce
the danger of trespassing . on the road
bed. The introduction of aluminum wire
as a conductor of the current is new but
Babcock is positive that it is preferable
to copper wire. Until the road enters
San Rafael, which will ha within .four
weeks, the narrow gauge trains will con
tinue to run to Sausalito. â
Each train is composed of five broad
gauge coaches. The first and last cars
are each equipped with two one- hundred
twenty-five horsepower motors which op
erate at the same time, giving five hun
dred horsepower to the train. Injury to
one machine would not affect the others
and there are controllers and air brake
equipments on each end of both cars.
Every device known to electrical . science
has been adopted on the cars and nothing:
was overlooked in making the rolling
stock the finest of its kind. There will
be little change In the time table of the
company except that trains will run
faster and more frequently.
EXCELLENCE OF THE ROAD.
After a fifteen minutes' stop the train
returned to Sausalito. where more gruests
were taken on board, and then the trip
was made to the powerhouse at Alto. A
steam train, placed at the disposal of the
visitors by . the company,, covered the
ground, from the main line to the house.
For, half an hour* those present listened
to an explanation of. the manner in which
the power was received and utilized, and.
inspected the works. The electricity for
use of the line is supplied from Yuba
River. 160 miles distant, by the Bay Coun
ties Power Company. Forty thousand
volts reach Alto on three wires, and this
immense quantity Is first reduced to a
voltage of 5000 on three transformers, and
a direct current of 500 volts, which sup
plies the trains, is produced by three mo
tor generators. To overcome the Jar and
loss that might occur when trains are
stopped and started the electric fluid is
gathered Into a storage battery room,
consisting of 288 large cells. When
charged this battery has a capacity of
supplying power for the road from twen
ty to thirty minutes should anything
happen to the motors or machinery.
In the event that the power from Yuba
Hiver should be turned off . there is a
steam engine capable of operating two
large dynamos â one of 700 horsepower and
the other of 1300â that no hindrance to
traffic shall occur. Fire is one of the.
worries of those who have charge of
powerhouses. To avoid this the switch
rooms are practically sealed vaults en
tered by manholes in which any blaze
might be confined. The entire building is
subdivided by terra cotta walls and the
roof is of slate. In the tower where the
terrific current enters there is a light
ning arrester, and every precaution has
been taken against fire. The connections
with the Yuba power plant will not be
made for about two days. At present the
electricity is generated by dynamos ope
rated by the stationary engine. The whole
thing was designed, by Babcock with a
view to safety, and so fine has his calcu
lation been that but VÂ£ per cent of the
power is lost after It reaches the power
house and passes through the transform-*
ers. -,;â¢'., â¢ -

The present prices are set by the mill
ers, who are freely buying wheat with
which to resume milling operations. Their
mills have been shut down for months.
The agents of the mills are having some
difficulty in buying wheat, but in most
cases the mills will start up between now
and September 1. Several grain ships
now waiting for cargoes at, Sound ports
will have to be held until September be
fore loading.
The price of wheat is now higher than
ever known at the beginning of the har
vest in the Palouse country. Though the
crop Is .lighter than last year's the ag
gregate amount received for it will be
much greater. The millers say that a
larger percentage of the crop will be
ground Into flour than ever before and
that the exports of flour from Puget
Sound during the coming year will be the
greatest known.
. TACOMA, Aug. 19.â Farmers of Eastern
Washington hope before spring to receive
a dollar per bushel for their wheat. They
are accordingly holding back the sales,
though buyers are offering 70 cents for
club and 73 cents for bluestem. The
farmers feel certain that the pi Ice will
advance at once to 75 cents, and those
who contracted before the harvest to sell
their crop at 60 cents are much chagrined.
Exporters are not buying, declaring that
present prices are 5 cents above what
they can afford to pay for the Liverpool
market.

FAILURE IS DUE

Riley is one of the hardest cases the
police have ever dealt with and that Mrs.
Parkhurst's name should be so closely
connected with his has occasioned great
surprise to her family and friends. Park
hurst has said nothing against his wife,
but he hopes to be revenged on Riley,
whom he had befriended and who so
treacherously broke up his home.
Rtley was released from Salem peniten
tiary August 1, after, having served a
term for highway robbery committed in
Portland, and through the kindness of
Mrs. Parkhurst's husband Riley visited
the Parkhurst home, where he was kind
ly treated. On Tuesday, August 4, Park
hurst, his wife and Riley attended a ball
and started to return home about la. m.
When they arrived at Salmon street Ri
ley suddenly turned and dealt Parkhurst
a terrible blow on the head, knocking him
down and seriously injuring him. Before
Parkhurst could regain his feet a car
riage drove up and Riley and Mrs. Park
hurst hurriedly entered it. The carriage
drove off in the darkness, leaving Park
hurst alone, maimed and bleeding.
Parkhurst first reported the case to the
police as a hold-up, then as a kidnaping,
but the facts soon became public. The
affair caused great excitement.
Since then detectives have been search
ing Jar and near for Riley and the wom
an. It has now been learned that Mrs.
Parkhurst during all this time has been

still at large, although a warrant is out
for his arrest for assaulting Parkhurst
on the night of the elopement.
If Mrs. Parkhurst knows where Riley

[Â¦iiiwi !Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ iiwim i Â¦Â¦mi in win ii ilium Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦iimiiâiÂ«iÂ« Â¦Â¦One of the curiosities of modern news was involved
in a recent item which recited that in the existing
bloody disturbances in Bulgaria the terrorized Chris

It sometimes happens that at long intervals some
thing in the environment of ardent but impecunious
young swains happens to make the course of true love
run smooth. More than fifty young persons of lov

Colorado Springs. Every youngster of sparking pro
clivities should paste the item in his hat and argue
that the icecream sold at Colorado Springs is no dif

JUMPING BEANâ N. O. M-. City. The
Jumping bean, or devil bean, sometimes
called the Mexican bean, is the seed of a
Mexican plant Infested by the larva of a
small moth. The uneasy movement of
the Imprisoned larva when it is warmed
makes the seed roll about on a flat sur
face and sometimes the larva makes the
seed Jump. The larva pupates in Jan
uary and February and thÂ© moth soon
after issues through a hole previously cut
by the larva. The trees bearing the bean
grow wild in but one State In Mexico
and produce a berry containing three
beans, but only one contains a larva.
There is no indication as to how the larva
enters that one bean.
PERSONAL MENTION.
Housekeepers will have to put the kettle on and do
their own canning if this thing go much further.
In canned fruits and vegetables California has to
compete with commercial dishonesty, domestic and
imported. Therefore it should be the aim of the pro
ducers and preservers of this State to strictly observe
the rules of commercial honor. Then a world, tired
of being poisoned in its food, will turn with con
fidence to our products, and they will hold a market
against all competitors.
It has long been known that great quantities of pig
livers are exported in barrels from this country to
Germany. Those who knew it supposed that the Ger
mans had a lasting appetite for pig liver and were
feeding it on the American product But now it seems
that these livers are turned into pate de foie gras, by
the use of dangerous drugs and silk rags! Our im
ported truffles are made of unvulcanized rubber and
leather, and the most innocent of that kind of im
ported delicatessen is made of potatoes, flavored with
ether.
r= If half the world does not know how the other
half lives, it must be that the whole world does not
know what it eat?. Having risen from a high-priced
meal of painted turnip, vaselined fish, lobster made
of cuttlefish, rubber truffles and goose liver pate made
of hog liver and black silk, washed down with im
ported wine made of dried-apple juice and gypsum,
the average American citizen can surely boast of a
bomb-proof stomach if he can manage to live out
half his span.
"Imparting a greenish color to oysters is another
adulteration. An oyster requires about one month
in the beds to acquire the greenish color. As this is
too long a time, the dealers help them along with
an artificial color. The chemists in the Paris munici
pal laboratories have shown that tomato jelly is adul
terated with turnips and powdered pepper contains a
large admixture of powdered hardtack."
"Chopped artificial truffles are made of black rub
ber, si'.k or softened leather, and even whole truffles
are made out of roasted potatoes, which are flavored
by adding ether. They are said to sell well.
â¢'Fish, spoiled in spite of ice and borax, is treated
with salt of zinc, aluminum and other metals. Rub
bing the fish with vaseline to give it a fresh look and
coloring the gills with fresh blood or eosin â a coal
tar color â is resorted to. The latter is also used to
intensify the red color of inferior crabs.
THE CALL recently published a remarkable dis
covery made by a retail dealer in Pennsylvania.
Among other foodstuffs he was a purveyor of
canned tomatoes. Upon examining his stock he found
the contents of his cans to be a mixture of green
tomatoes, turnips and potatoes, dyed to a proper ripe
tomato complexion with red paint. This mixture is
another added to the many proofs of the recklessness
and ingenuity of the American adulterator of foods.
But that is not the worst of it. Americans, hearing
much about the paternalism and autocratic methods of
foreign Governments, jump to the conclusion that peo
ple so well raised and disciplined as they must be un
der such Governments arc incapable of like injurious
sophistication of food, and so purchase at a high price
and consume with childlike trust the preserved pro
ducts which are imported.
This confidence gets a rude jolt by a report just
made to the State Department by our Consul General
to Germany, in which he. says: "An ordinary liver
patty is made into "Strassburger* pate de foie gras, a
goose liver patty, by means of borax or salicylic acid
and of finely chopped and cleverly distributed pieces
of black silk, representing {ruffles. Cosmos, a Ger
man paper, guarantees the fact that under the label of
canned lobsters the soft parts of the cuttlefish and
crabs are sold.
"'In Paris snails are popular, and the adulterators
mix them with lungs of cattle and^ horses. Even en
tirely artificial snails are manufactured. The shells,
recoated with fat and slime, are filled with lungs and
then sold as 'Burgundy' snails. Lovers of fresh
rooster combs are imposed upon by a substitute cut
out of hogs' intestines.
SOME DELICATESSEN.
LAKE TAHOEâ M. A. R.. Los Angeles.
Cal. What is now known as Lake Tahoe
was at one time called Lake Blgler. The
lake Is in two States. California and Ne
vada. When it was first discovered it
was supposed to be- wholly In California
and was named Blgler for its one time
Governor. When the boundary line was
drawn it was discovered that the lake
was a part of the State of Nevada. The
people of that State objected to the name
Blgter, and after a number of confer
ences between California and Nevada rep
resentatives the name was changed to
the Indian one, Tahoe.
OUTSIDE of Paris itself, the recent terrible dis
aster on. the Metropolitan Electric Railway
has nowhere more powerfully affected the
public mind than in New York. In that city the
calamity is looked upon as a lesson of warning and
there is every reason to believe it will be heeded.
While it is not certain what caused the accident,
enough is known to confirm the belief that electric
lines operating in tunnels are always dangerous and
that extra care must at all times be exercised to guaÂ»d
against fire.
In the discussion now going on in New York over
the equipment and operation of subway electric lines
in that city it is recalled that more than a year and
a half ago George Westinghouse wrote to the New
York Times a letter, in which he said: "It should be
borne in mind that the electric energy required to
operate a heavy train is sufficient to melt a consider
able bar of iron, or to start a dangerous fire if any
thing goes wrong upon a car of ordinary combustible
construction. The destruction of a car upon a street
or upon a level is one thing, but such an occurrence
upon an elevated railway or in a tunnel can have
consequences the contemplation of which should lead
to wise regulations governing the construction and
use of electrically propelled trains, and. thereby insure
to the public the rapid development of electric, trac
tion. In Liverpool, during the past month, an elec
tric train, while running in a short tunnel, Was set
afire by the electric current and totally destroyed,
with considerable loss of life."
The warning contained in the letter was not much
heeded, but the disaster at Paris is too appalling to be
overlooked or ignored and already a searching in
quiry is being made concerning the nature of the pre
cautions provided by American electric lines that
operate in tunnels or subways. The result of the in
vestigations has not been altogether satisfactory. The
Philadelphia Public Ledger in reviewing them says:
"It was announced a few days ago that the Pennsyl
vania Railroad would construct fireproof cars for its
tunnels in New York City. The cars under construc
tion for the New York City subway, it is said, are
not to be absolutely fireproof; they are to be sheathed
with metal only as far as the window sills on the 6*ut
side. The New York, New Haven and Hartford
Railroad is sheathing its passenger cars completely."
The agitation of the question will, of course, com
pel the various subway lines to - adopt better safe
guards than they would otherwise have done, even if
they do not make them thoroughly effective. To that
extent then American cities will profit by the calamity
of Paris and they will have to thank the press for in
sisting that the warning be heeded by electric com
panies.

YOSEMITE VALLEYâ A. B. C. Bishop.
Cal. Yosemite Valley was set apart a 9 a
National Park In 1S64.
DESPITE the gameness shown by Sir Thomas
Lipton in his struggles for the America's cup,
and the general keenness of men in all sorts
of contests between well matched competitors, there
is unquestionably much less popular interest in the
races this year than in former years. The decline in
excitement may be due somewhat to Lipton's good
nature,' for when the challenger takes the issue blandly
the defenders are very apt to be equally good-natured
about it. When Dunraven came over with his fight
ing blood at fever heat we were all about as eager as
himself, but this year it is not at all uncommon to
hear even yachting men say they would not be sorry
if the cup were taken by the challenger for once, be
cause it would give more interest to the sport here
after.
There are, however, other factors in the problem
that have contributed to the decline in popular interest
in the matches. One of these is the growing convic
tion that after all it is not so much an international
contest as a mere racing event between the New York
Yacht Club and a British club. When the Boston
yachtsmen were excluded from the competition for
the cup two years ago it was everywhere recognized
that America as a nation was out of it, and that the
cup in its present hands is not open for general com
petition. The impression created by the exclusion of
the Boston yacht was distinctly adverse to the New
York club, and at the time there were a good many
persons who expressed a wish that Lipton would win
in order that the cup might once more be placed as
a trophy to be competed for not by two yachts only,
but by as many as chose to enter the contest.
Another cause of declining interest is the abandon
ment on each side of a distinctive national type of
yacht. The present competitors are neither of them
distinctively British nor American. Even in the case
of the crews and the captains, there is no longer a
strictly national distinction. Each side has sought the
best it could get in the way of hull, masts, sails, crews
and skippers. That, of course, is all right in a contest
between rival clubs, but it diminishes the national
issue and correspondingly lessens popular interest.
Concerning the comparative points of similarity be
tween the rival yachts, experts differ. Some assert
they are strictly of the same type, while others,
conceding that they do not present rival national
types, maintain that they do present distinct types of
yachts common to both nations. On the one side the
New York Sun says: "The two models are now as
much alike as any two peas that ever were shelled.
Both are fairly deep and fairly, wide. Both have a
minimum of underbody and a maximum of overhang.
Both carry an abundance of outside ballast. Both
have enormous sail plans, with high lower masts and
tall topmasts. Both have club topsails, whose yards
stand straight up alongside the topmasts and act as
prolongations of those spars. Both are built as light
and easy of hull as engineering skill can make them
in view of the tremendous strains to be withstood.
Both have standing bowsprits and set their jibs on
jibstays. Each has a mainsail with the foot laced
to the boom. Neither one carries a sprit topsail to be
hoisted from the deck. Both steer with a wheel."
On the other side the Boston Herald says: "Even
to the ordinary observer we think there would be
quite a marked difference between the appearance of
the Reliance and the Shamrock III were both ex
posed at the same time in drydock. True, both are
keel craft of the fin variety, with an immense amount
of lead on the outside to give them the necessary
stability to carry their enormous sail spread, but the
lines of the hulls are far from being similar, and this
is particularly true in the forward sections of the two
sloops. The race is not to be a test between an
American shoal center-board sloop and a deep Eng
lish keel craft, but it will, nevertheless, be a test of
types, and types which any yachtsman will recognize
as being quite widely different in many essentials."
Where experts on the spot differ it is not for judges
on this side of the continent to decide. There is a
further cause of complaint. It is said that in perfect
ing the racing machine the builders have departed
from what is called the true j r achf type, and that the
construction of these machines does not in any way
advance the art of yacht building, nor suggest any im
provement that would be of advantage to a man de
siring a pleasure craft. Such complaints have been
both frequent and loud ever since the Shamrock III
reached American waters, and it is not improbable
that there will never be another challenger of this
kind, as the holder of the cup may, in deference to
what seems to be the prevailing opinion of yachts
men, so fix the terms of future competitions that
racing machines will be barred and none but genuine
yachts permitted to compete.
Be that as it may, the Shamrock III represents the
best that British money can obtain in the way of a
racing machine constructed in a British shipyard and
the Reliance represents the best that has yet been
produced in America. That in 'itself will be sufficient
to arouse the sporting spirit of our people* and while
there has been a great deal of indifference so far, the
actual Tacing will unquestionably have the effect of
awakening interest. It matters not whether they be
: true yachts or not, or truly national or not; now that
the day has come to match them, and one flies the
American flag, while the other displays the Union
Jack, there will surely be big crowds in every city in
the United States and Great Britain waiting for the
bulletins, ready to cheer the victor.

them. The first step having been taken in the direc
tion of a good prison system, it is reasonable to ex
pect that other steps will follow in due season.
A* feature of note in the agitation which led the
Legislature to act so promptly is the work done by
a country editor, a woman at that, Mrs. Myrick of
Americus, v/ho. not only demanded reform through
her paper, but went to the State Capitol and de
manded it of the Legislature when she found she
could not get it from the Prison Commissioners. It
appears that when she went to the prison officials
about the matter she met with scant welcome and was
told with brutal frankness that the clamor against the
whipping of women was silly. She is quoted as say
ing: "Warden Moore told me that Mamie de Cris was
not the first white woman to be lashed at the State
farm; that other women had received much worse
punishment and that the woman did not get half
what she deserved. 'Jake' Moore said that other
white women had been whipped and the people did
not raise such a howl, and he was unable to under
stand why so much noise had been made about this
affair, when Allagood and Dr. Adams were doing
only their duty."
The Commissioners were a little more courteous
and less frank than their subordinates, but even they
would promise nothing. Mrs. Myrick says they de
clared they would not let the newspapers "bulldoze
them into condemning the whipping." Well, the
whipping has been condemned by the Legislature.
The women and the newspapers have won their fight,
and among other good results it is probable the
Prison Commissioners and wardens will be a little
more respectful when a country editor calls upon
them. At least they will if the editor happens to
have the vim and vigor of Mrs. Myrick.
SOME ANSWERS
TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1903.
A dissatisfied husband and wife from Missouri have
matie San Francisco the scene of their prospective
Ftrujrglc for divorce, the wife asking for the decree.
This is evidently one of those cases when the gentle
man had to show her and couldn't Or perhaps his
career on the sea of matrimony was altogether too
spectacular for the lady. .
OUT of the suffering of the unfortunate woman
who was whipped on a convict farm a few
days ago, or rather out of the intense indig
nation aroused by the report of it, Georgia is to get
something in the way of prison reform that will be
beneficial to her convicts and creditable to herself.
It happens that the Legislature is in session, and in
response to the cry of the women of the State it has
promptly enacted a law forbidding the use of the lash
upon any woman convict, whether white or black, and
furthermore has passed a convict bill which will go
far toward mitigating the evils of the convict lease
system by requiring that all convicts sentenced to five
years or more shall be set to work on public roads
instead of being leased out to private parties.
The reform measures fall far short of what they
should be and Georgia will have to go far before she
reaches the American level in the matter of treating
prisoners, but it is nevertheless gratifying to note that
the Legislature has done something to protect con
victs against the greed of those who lease them and
the barbarity of those .who are put in authority over
GEORGIA AND HER CONVICTS.
It is consoling that while every endeavor is being
made by the people of the city to welcome the heroes
of forty years ago as they deserve and to show them
what manner of men we are in our products, the
police are herding that other product of our civiliza
tion, the pickpocket, and in his unwelcome variety are
locking him behind bars to keep others out of his
harm's way.
Thousands. of Croatian peasants are reported to be
in revolt and have expressed their rebellion by an
insult to the, Hungarian flag. This is the necessary
prelude to what will probably be a material reduction
in the population of Croatia. Perhaps the relation of
supply and demand in Croatian peasants has been dis
turbed and can be restored only by cannon shot.
President Castro, free from rebellion, immune from
the assaults of foreign victims, national and indi
vidual, is now amusing himself by imprisoning mer
chants upon pretexts so absurd as to appear only to
ridicule. He is probably trying to illustrate the char
acter of the. Governments which the United States is
pleased to tolerate as republics.
Charles M. Schwab, late of steel trust fame, has
denied emphatically that he is interested in the or
ganization of a proposed gigantic combination of
tailors. For all of which we should give thanks. With
nine such tailors as Mr. Schwab would be the
proverbial man in their making would be a grotesque
wonder.

\^ crowded book Shelves with "literature" which nobody ever reads.
Why? Because not one writer in a hundred knows a good story when
he sees it. It takes something more than a grammar, a speller and a dic-
tionary to make "word pictures." It is the ability to compress a human
comedy into a "thumbnail sketch" or put a tragedy into a nutshell that
makes "literary genius." Better than all else, it's the only quality that
sells books. Just take a peep at this little extract from a book that the
whole country is talking about and you'll realize, perhaps for the first
time, what a tremendous lot can be said in 250 words:
"At 3 o'clock the elevator made another trip to the top floor and
Zllis rushed over to the unfriendly doorbell. This time there was stub-
aorn determination in his face. The singing ceased and a roar of laughter
followed the hush of a moment or two.
" 'Come in!' called a hearty voice, and Ellis strode firmly into the
studio.
"'You are just in time for a 'nightcap,' Ellis,' cried Harrison, rush-
ing to the footman's side. Ellis, stolidly facing the young man, lifted
his hand. .' " "*#'
" 'No* thank you, sir,' he said respectfully. 'Mr. Montgomery, if
you'll excuse me for breaking in, I'd like to give you three messages
I've brought here to-night.'
"You're a faithful old chap," said Subway Smith, thickly. 'Hanged
if I'd do A. D. T. work till 3 a. m. for anybody.' . >~"
" 'I came at 10, Mr. Montgomery, with a message from Mr. Brew-
ster, wishing you many happy returns of the day and with a check from
him for $1000. Here's the check, sir. I'll give my messages in the or-

"'Good Lord!" . '^. ,
" 'This -time I bring a message from Rawles. the butler, asking you to
come to Mr. Brewster's house at onceâ if you can, sirâ I mean if you
will, sir,' Ellis interjected, apologetically. Then with his gaze directed
steadily over the heads of the subdued 'Little Sons of the Rich' he added,
impressively: '/ ,/-
" 'Mr.. Brewster is dead, sir.'" .^v:
Can you imagine anything more graphic? The suspense is so keen
that it hurts. And yet that is only the closing incident of the first chap-
ter of "Brewster's Millions." which begins in the next Sunday Call. In
point of fact, "Brewster's Millions" is absolutely unlike anything that
has ever beerr written before, for In it a perfectly adorable youne fellow
,ias to spend a million a year, get his money's worth and yet have abso-
lutely nothing to show for it at the end of that time inorder that he may
inherit six million more.- Sounds fascinating, doesn't it? Well, it is
more than that.
But the popular craze for literature of the bright, snappy, uo-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stories of the best sort. And what better
reading could you get? A eood short story is a complete novel in con-

the church in a time of extraordinary need.
The Grand Council therefore thanks God for
the incalculable service rendered to the holy
cause cf religion and to the human race by
the late sovereign Pontiff. It thanks him in
particular for the remarkable stimulus given
Catholic faith and piety among Catholics by
the works of Leo. for the spirit of conciliation

JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., Aug. 19.â The
trial of State Senator William P. Sullivan,
under indictment on the charge of solicit
ing a bribe of $4500 from a representative
of baking powder interests for three votes
in favor of the bill to repeal the anti-alum
law, was begun here to-day before Spe
cial Judge H. C. Timmons. JThe jury was
secured without delay. It is made up of
seven farmers, two carpenters, a State
house employe, a clerk, and an engineer.
Whitney Layton, representative of the
baking powder interests, the witness upon
whom the prosecution depends chiefly,
after testifying to the fact that he at
tended the Legislature last winter trying
to secure the repeal of the pure food bill,
said:
"I met Senator Sullivan in the large
back room of the Senate cloakroom. He
said we needed three votes to get the bill
: that we wanted passed. He said that for
the sum of J4500 he could carry two other
votes and his own for the repeal of the
law."
.. "Who were the other Senators?"
"He gave me to understand that Sena
tor Smith was one of the others. He said
he would see Smith and go into the mat
ter further."
Layton then told of Sullivan, Smith and
himself going to the Madison House, and
added:
"Just then Senator Farris came in and
Senator Smith stepped over and joined
Senator Farris. I talked to Senator
Smith later after Smith had talked wfth
Farris."

Of Fast Heart Lasted
160 Hours.
Doctors Didn't Know
What To Do.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure and
â¢ Nervine Cured Me.
"For seven years I have been troubled
with what the doctors called a 'fast heart,*
going: -t once from the usual beat to twice as
fast, which in a short time would exhauit me
terribly and only after treatment by a physi-
cian it would get back to normal speed.
These attacks increased in frequency and
severity until December, 1901, when they
came on once a week. Each attack would
lay me up a day or more. The attack begin- â¢
ning January 13th, 1902, lasted 160 hours
(almost a week) my heart beat almost one
hundred and fitly per minute and some
times more. During this week rav physician
consulted with four other doctors, but all to no
purpose. My heart finally slowed up, and it
was then a serious question with my family
what to do next; as tor me, I was too far gone
to care much what happened. Dr. Miles' al-
manac said, "write for advice" and my son
wrote, receiving a nice reply. A neighbor told
us he had used your remedies with great ben-
efit. I took courage, began the use of Dr.MUes'
New Heart Cure and Restorative Nervine
until I had taken eleven bottles of the Heart
Cure and seven bottles of the Restorative
Nervine. I had two slight attacks after I
began the use of your medicine the last one
lasting only thirty minutes. For more than
three months my heart has run without a
flurry. I am cured, and Dr. Miles' Remedies
did the work. I have been postmaster here
for more than ten years."â M. T. Cantrell,

This is the proposition: You want to fur-

you dislike trading in an out-and-out install*

We offer you the way.
We loan you the money, charging simply
the regular banking rate of interest â six per
cent. You go then to one of the big, first-
class furniture stores where the stock is big
and fresh, and where satisfaction is certain;
and when you have made your selections pay;

The installment stores charge you ten per
cent above their cash prices for time. All you
pay us is six per cent. The actual saving to
you is FOUR PER CENT.
For instance: If your purchases amount to
$100.00 we will charge you $106.00â which is a
six per cent advance; then you pay us $20.00
cash and the balance in monthly payments
amounting to $8.60 each month. If your pur-
chases amount to $75.00 we will charge you

The champions and the cliallengers ap
peared to be in prime form. Play began
at top speed. .The first set went to the
champions. Both teams fought hard for
the second set. and it was full v of bril
liant rallies, but the British players took
the lead and were never headed. In the
third the Americans fought gamely, but
they were no match for the clever Eng
lishmen.
Next to the doubles in importance was
the match in singles between R. F. Do
herty and Krelgh Collins. Each player
had played in the hard doubles match in
the morning, besides disposing of a man
in singles in the early afternoon, but in
spite of this handicap both put up a very
creditable game. Doherty took the first
set, 6-2, but Collins was always at the
net In the second set and played so well
that he won, 6-2. Doherty took the lead
in the third set, 5-4, and 40-30, but Collins
ran the game out, and eighteen games
were played before the Britisher played
the set to his credit. In the fourth set
Doherty forced himself more and ran out
quite easily, 6-3. Summary:

NEWPORT, R. I., Aug. >19.-The Do
hertys retain their, hold on the national
doubles championship to-day - by a bril
liant straight set victory over Collins and
Waidner, the challengers. H. L. Doherty
was the most effective of the four. The
Western team played* much, better tennis
than yesterday, when they- defeated the
Eastern champions. Ward and Ware.
Another perfect day cheered the play
erB and spectators alike. The betting fa
vored the Dohertys. The Dohertys suc
cessfully defended their title as Ameri
can tennis champions, winning in straight
sets from Collins and Waidner, 7-5, 6-3,
6-3. Â¦ -â¢. - . 'Â«*Â¦-.. Â¦ J
Defeat Clever Western
Team, Collins. and
Waidner. x
The work of the team . has improved
about 500 per cent since showing here on
the last trip. They can run bases and
they can hit and field the ball like
real champs. Then they have developed
the useful habit of yelling at the umpire
every time he has to give a decision.
This shows they Â¦ want to win a few
games and the man with the indicator
has to look sharp else they speak their
minds.
The principal trouble with the home
stickers yesterday was their inability to 1
get jerry to the offerings .of Southpaw
Shields at the time hits meant a great
deal more than money to - them. He
pitched a fine quality of ball from the
start and, barring a little wildness in one
or two innings, was perfect. Then his
support was the best that is ever tended
a slab artist, not one of his backers
throwing him down on a single chance.
Herr, for the home team, was also in
the going some himself, but in the ninth
Inning they happened to wallop him when
the. time was" right for tallies. Hollings
worth led off with a double to the score
board and Shea drove him In with a hit
to short center, winning the game. The
score:

In the outfield Blake, a new man from
the Eastern league, is in charge of cen
ter. The other two fly chasers. Spec
Hurlburt and Nadeau, were ..with the
team on the former trip here. So, all the
way through, the nine is a pretty swell
combination of talent and will make them
all go some to win ere the season comes
to an end.
The Portland team, with a new bunch
of faces and a new lease of life, trotted
about the green at the Eighth street lot
yesterday afternoon with that air of con
fidence and that swagger attitude which
plainly bespeaks the real cream cheese
in any kind of a sporting event. These
men of the north, who have been earning
reputations for valor on the native field,
showed yesterday they were there. Never
did the home team ' seem able to cope
with them and the game finished Port
land 2, San Francisco 1.
'Tis a different team ' altogether which
now represents the metropolis of the
northwest. The infield is all changed,
with the exception of-Anderson at second,
and there is no need of changing him.
Colonel Van Buren now does the act on
the first station; Hollingsworth, of light
foot fame, is stationed at short, and
Francis, who comes from the Eastern
league with a record as a ball player a
yard long, has the honor of receiving all
basemen who slide into third.

record. Summary:
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Dan Patch broke
the world's record to-day for. pacers by
pacing a mile in 1:59 at Brighton Beach.
It was a magnificent performance and
seemed an impossibility, the wind and
track considered.
. There was a stiff breeze blowing, which
struck the horse fairly in the face. The
track was a little slow, but the effect of
the wind was discounted by sending a
runner in front -while the second runner
galloped alongside. In view of the ad
verse condition the. announcement was
made that Dan Patch would go against
the track record of 2:00?i, but also would
try to beat the champion record of l:59Vi,
held since 1897 by Star Pointer. "
When the unbeaten pacer (for Dan
Patch never lost a race) appeare.d on the
track he was loudly cheered and after a
few preliminary warm-ups he got the
word. With a swift, frictionless stride,
he shot from the wire and seemed to be
determined to push his nose into the fly
ing sulky in front of him. which the
thoroughbred in the shafts was steadily
pulling ahead. On swept the famous
pacer to the quarter in 29V4 and when the
half-mile pole was flashed past in 58>i a
great cheer went up from the vast crowd.
Then came the difficult top turn and
the slowest quarter of the mile ensued,
the three-quarters being done in 1:29%.
But down the stretch as swift and steady
as a locomotive he came, and as he shot
under the wire the watches stopped at
1:59.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 19.â

Must Face Accusers.
I received th* three sealed bids yesterday,
but was not at that time aware that the garb
age men had formed a mercer and raised the
rates. One of the envelopes enclosing a bid
bora on the outside the words. "Doe cne
scent." I did not smell the rat then, but later
I detected the meaning of It all. It was not
a very fragrant pun. but It might hava been
worse. It Is possible that we may have the
jrarbage removed from the schools hereafter by
the city's teams. . .
It develon^d last night when the bids
for removlne the waste material from
the Dubllc schools were opened that the
scavengers of Alameda had evidently
heard of the business tactics pursued by
John D. Rockefeller. Andrew Carnegie
and other famed financiers .of modern
times and that they had formed a com
bine to gather In more coin for gather
ing 1n banana skins, orange peels, muti
lated sandwiches, scrap paper, lead pen
cil shavings, fractured slate pencils and
the assorted debris that Is srenerally to
be found about educational institutions.
The lowest bid submitted last night was
ten times greater than what the Board
of Education has been payinjr for two
years for having the same work done.
Heretofore a scavenger has been allowed
{3 50 a month for removing the garbage
from all of the public school premises.
Last night Luigl Farnando & Co. offered
to take tbe contract for $35 a month. B.
Flndle 9c. Co. would do the work for $33 50,
and A. Mussi wanted S-io a month to dis
pose of the garbage. All of the bids were
rejected, and Secretary Hughes was or
dered to make other arrangements to have
the waste material taken away. In speak
ing of the scavengers' trust Hughes said:
ATiAMEDA, Aug. 19.â Local scavengers
have^ organized a trust and as a result
of their first move to increaaa their divi
dends the garbage men have got them
selves into bad odor with tho members
of the Board of Education. Secretary
Charles C. Hughes of that body has been
instructed to break the refuse merger If
he can. "While he realizes that It may
prove onÂ© of the strongest' tasks he haa
ever tackled, Hughes asserts that he will
stay, the efforts of the garbage monopo
lists or feel after he has done his best
like a man in the "dumps."

111S Broadway. Aug." 13.
Public interest in Mayor Olney's mes
sage on the subject of a municipal water
tupply has been awakened to an extent
rarefy manifested over official documents
vt that character. On all eides the ex.
jiression of approval of the paper as an
able, firm and straight from the shoulder
exposition has bt*n strong. These opin
ions are given from many sources and
are unar.lmous concerning the 6plendid
ability shown in the clear and concise
j^rtser.taticn of the water situation, no
ir.atur what might be individual belief
concerning: any or all of the projects pro
posed for the people's considepACloo.
For the present the public is concerned
in the final action that will be taken by
the Contra Costa Water Company. The
ten days' limit placed upon the provi
sional offer of J3,3CrJ.O00 for such of its
l^ant as mipht be required to serve Oak
land will expire a week from to-morrow.
Though President William J. Dingee of
the water company has been freely
quoted as declaring that his company
would not consider the tender, definite
action toward other channels must be de
ferred until the expiration of the time
limit. With an unofficial understanding
that the Contra Costa Water Company
wlll not break its si'ence since the Mayor
first tried to open negotiations on the
pubject of a selling: price, the special
bond committee will be able to take pre
liminary eteps at once to begin active
Investigation of the messape.
' The work will be directed, it is practi
cally understood, to a careful consider
ation of the Bay Cities Water Company's
proposal to Install a system at the south
ern boundary of the city capable of de
livering at least 20,000.000 gallons of water
daily, with a gross capacity for 25,000,000
g-allons per dlcm.
That preposition has been concretely
presented In a voluminous and compre
hensive contract, provisional, of course,
together with a mass of engineering
plans, maps and data, which will be
available to the city's experts.
It is expected that the municipal Â¦water
supply proposition will be ready for sub
mission to the people at a special bond
ing election within one hundred days.

from the water off the south side of Bay

He was about 6 feet 2 inches In height,
dark complexloned. with dark hair, wore
a dark woolep coat and vest, blue over

NEW OPEN-AIR GREEK THEATER ON CAMPUS OF THE UNIVER
SITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND PROFESSOR ANEJ STUDENTS WHO
ARE ARRANGING FOR THREE. DAYS' DRAMATIC FESTIVAL.
By - reducing the number in a class you
prevent overcrowding and Rive a teacher some
chance to impart knowledge. s^pbAm;
To remedy this condition of affairs we must
have some new school buildings as soon aa
possible.
The Board of Education. has under con
sideration the applications of between 2G0
and 360 non-residents for permission to
enter the public schools as pupils. Ac
tion on these requests has been deferred
until, tho enrollment of resident attend
ants shall have been completed. The
board exacts a tuition fee from all non
residents who are granted the privilege
of entering the Oakland public schools.
This rule can only apply this year to
primary and grammar school pupils and
such high school students as shall come
from districts where high schools are es
tablished. Those applicants who reside in
districts not provided' with high school
facilities must be accommodated without
expense of tuition fees.
Superintendent of Schools McClymonds
has 'received cqmplete reports from the
several .schools of the city showing that
organization' for the present schools term
has been effected. There has been heavy
crowding at ' the Durant School. The
others are well. filled, there being through
out the department an average enrollment
of forty-eight members to a class, exclu
sive >of the high' schools. Superintendent
McClymonds declares that the maximum
limit, the way outside figure, should show
not more than fifty members .to a class,
that anything approximating proper at
tention by the teachers might be given
to the pupils in their charge.
The Superintendent said;
It is this lares class enrollment that la dis
turbing I us; Our facilities are so inadequate
that we are compelled to form much larger
.classes than we should care to organize. A
teacher cannot exercise the . individual over
sight that is required to do good, work unless
the number of pupils Is kept within reasonable
bounds. IMP^SfV'SM

The play has only been given twice
In modern. times. It was revived for the
first time., after its abandonment by the
ancients, in 1SS3 in England, when Sir
Humbert Perry wrote thfi music for it.
Ten years later it was flayed by the
students at Harvard University, so now
it Is reserved for the University of Cali
fornia to produce it for the third time.
On the second day of the festival Ra
cine's famous tragedy, "Phedre," one of
the masterpieces of the French dramatic
genius, will be presented. It will be In
charge of a committee consisting of
Marlus J. Spinello, Charles H. j Howard
and Carlos Bransby. all members of the
department. of Romanic languages.
An old English play will be given on
the third day, though it has not yet been
selected. It may be the blur.k verse
tragedy "Ion," by Sir. William Noon Tal

WASHINGTON. Aug. 19.â The Postmas
ter General signed to-day the protocol
to the postal treaty between the United
States and Cuba, made necessary by the
amendments made by the Cuban Senate.
The treaty becomes effective without rati
lication by the Senate of the United
States, but the Cuban laws require the
action of the Senate of that island # and
one- of the amendments made embraces a
statement of that fact. Another provides
for the prompt transmission of the mails
of one country by the other, subject only
to sanitary regulations. These alterations
are specified in the protocol, and they
have been accepted by the postal authori
ties of this country. The treaty will now
be forwarded to the President for his
signature.

The auenchinp of the fire in the hold
of the W. G. Irwin did not end the trou
bles of the brig, however. The steamer
Del Norte, while Meiggs wharf
last night at 10:30 bound for Crescent
City, collided with the Irwln. The steam
er carried away the bowsprit cathead of
the windjammer, but suffered no appre
ciable damage herself and was able to
proceed on her voyage without returning
to port.
While the flames and smoke were still
pouring from the vessel's decks, the "tug
Governor Irwln, which had gone to the
threatened boat's assistance, was busy
pumping water into the hold, and after
over two hours' work the flames were
extinguished.
The loss of the cargo, which was not
insured, will aggregate about $7000.
The brig William G. Irwln, 331 tons, was
built in 1S81 at Port Townsend by Turner.
Rundell & Co. She is owned by the Ta
coma and Roche Harbor Lime Company.
Most of the cargo on board at the time
of the fire was consigned to this com
pany.
During Monday night all hands were
kept busy battening down the hatches
for the purpose of smothering the fire.
On the morning of August 18 the hatches
were again taken up and the fire was
found to have gained considerable head
way, having already attacked the ship's
sides and bottom. The life boats were
launched and towed astern. At 8 p. m.
of the same day, all hands went below
and got out the fifty cases of giant pow
der, which were immediately thrown over
board. During the excitement which
prevailed the crew showed excellent con
duct and worked heroically.
In a heavy sea the brig squared away
for this port, but yesterday morning was
forced to anchor off the coast a few
miles south of the heads, flying a distress
signal. At 8 o'clock in the morning the
steamer ICavarro came alongside, passed
a line and towed the disabled vessel into
the bay, arriving off Meiggs wharf short
ly after 10 o'clock.
10 o'clock on fire. The brig sailed
with a mixed cargo of merchandise, in
cluding fifty cases of giant powder and
four tanks of easoline and a quantity of
oil. The boat was in command of Cap
tain Garthley and the crew consisted of
eight men.
Shortly before 10 o'clock on the morn
ing of Monday, August 17, while Second
Mate Barkfield was in charge, he noticed
that smoke was coming from the forward
hatch, and immediately reported the mat
ter to the captain. All hands were called
on deck and a thorough search of the
vessel's hold was made. The fire was
found to be in the lime stacks, Just to
starboard of the forward hatch, and ef
fcrts to quench the flames were unavail
able.
THE brig William G. Irwln, which
left this port Saturday bound for
Roche Harbor, was towed into
the bay yesterday shortly after
CLEVELAND. Ohio. <Augr. 19.â The
names of the alleged murderer and his
victim in last night's double tragedy was
learned to-day. The man was William
Leutbecher, 28 years old, and the young
woman Martha Faehnnch. The; cause
given for the tragedy is the opposition of
the Faehnrich family to Leutbecher's at
tentions to Martha. â ;
Miss Faehnrich was a clerk in her
brother's grocery and it is supposed
that Leutbecher called upon her last
night and induced her to go for a walk.
While in a lonely locality and not far
from the girl's home it is believed Leut
becher shot Miss Faehnrich and then
killed himself. .

The Xew officers of the company who have

There iÂ£ no Intention of making wholesale

It is possible rather than probable that it
muy be otherwise now, but, Judging them from
the light of past or present, it Is to be regretted
that the enforced publicity which has been
given to these Initial experiments, which art
essentially experiments and nothing else, may
lead to quite unfounded expectations. .Â¦ - â¢
It Is the practice of all scientific men. Indeed
of all prudent men, not to make public the
results of their work until these are certain.
This consideration, and not any desire to with
hold from the public matters in which the
public Is Interested, has dictated the policy
thus far punmed here. The fullest publicity
consistent with the national Interestâ the pres
ent experiments have for their object the de
velopment of a machine for war purposes â will
be given to this work if it reaches, a- stage
which warrants publication. Â¦â¢Â¦' - : ,-- Â¦

In my previous trials success has only been
reached alter initial failures, which alone have
taught the way to it, and I know no reason
why prospective trials should be an excep

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. Aug. 10.â
To, the Press: The present experiments being
made In mechanical flight have been carried
on partly with funds provided by the Hoard
of Ordnance and Fortifications and partly from
private sources and from an endowment cf the
Smithsonian Institution. The experiments are
carried on with the approval of the Board of
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.
The public's Interest In them may lead to an
unfounded expectation as to their Immediate
rtnults. without an explanation which Is here
briefly given...
Those trials, with seme conducted with steam
driven flying machines, are believed to be the
first in the history of invention where bodies
far heavier than the air itself are sustained in

mechanical means.

Hostetter's Stomach Bitters is
without an equal. It will not
gripe nor shock the system, and
make you feel sick all over like
most cathartics do, but has a firm
and gentle effect on the consti-
pated bowels, stimulating and as-
sisting them in the proper per-
formance of their functions. Then
an occasional dose is all that is
needed to keep the bowels regular
and the stomach strong. A trial
will convince you of its value.

of the market waÂ« rather weak. The low
prices stimulated the demand for shipping, and
buying for that purpose was moderately active.

steady rates. Sweet Potatoes were in light re

were in free supply and moved slowly at un
steady prices.

a brlÂ«<k demand for vegetables and prices of

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Handlers of Feedstuffs continue to report a

The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Hay shipments have been increasing dur

week preceding of 400 tons. Under the pres
sure of such heavy arrivals, matters have
been dragging somewhat, but prices have been
held up remarkably well. Choice grade Wheat
Hay sells Itself, but the medium grades have
to be worked off because of their abundance.
Ordinarily this would bring a decided lowering
of price?, but as the bulk of present ship-,
ments are shipped on purchases. It can be
readily understood why every- one holds firmly
for the prices of 'last month.
"Owing to the general fear of early rain*,
much Hay is seeking storage room; private
barns are being utilized in many districts and
many lots that were purchased for immediate
shipment will be put away for winter delivery.
We believe the fields will be cleaned much
earlier than usual, and that we will have to
draw from warehouse stocks shortly after the
first of October. This will probably occasion
a much earlier advance' in prices than was
generally exoectrd, and a fairly strong' fall
market can be reasonably anticipated.
"Export trade continues without chanee In
any way. no orders of any great size having
been placed here for some time. Town trade
is brisk, as la usual' this time of year, with
1 many large consumers filling their barns for
winter."

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Aug. 19.â There was a fairly
steady opening In wheat, due to reports of
continued wet weather in the United Kingdom,
and September opened a shade lower to a
ehade higher at S0%@80%c. Local longs
showed a disposition early in the day to buy
back some of the wheat they .had sold out
during the past few days and were encouraged
in that by the action of cash houses, which
bought freely of the September delivery. This
demand resulted In a better tone during the
first half hour, when September sold up to
61 %c. but later In the day reporU of good
weather In the Northwest, together with a
better field than had been expected, caused
heavy liquidation and prices declined rapidly.
A break of 2c In the price of the cash com
modity at Minneapolis, heavy receipts at all
primary points and light clearances added to
the weakness and started a stampede to sell
by local longs which resulted in September
declining to 7!Â»%c. Covering by shorts during
the last half-hour caused a sharp rally and
the close was near the top, with September
%G4c hirher at 81 Vic.
There was some covering in corn early In
the session on the firmness In wheat, and with
light offerings the market became firmer.
September closed a shade higher it lilVic.
Oats were Independently strong throughout
the entire day. September closed J4o higher
at 344c.
Provisions were without support and con
tinued selling by longs forced prices to a
lower level. Trading was dull the entire day.
The close was weak, with September pork
down 15c, lard was oft 74@10c, while ribs
were down 5c.

regular session of Congress Is Improbable. The
selling was much concentrated, a single com
mirel.-n houne disposing of many thousand
shares during the day. The personality of thj
firm and Its oast employment by one of the
great financial groups caused considerable sig
nificance to be attached to this selling. The
further reduction In prices of Southern pig lruii
had its greatest effect en Tennessee Coal, but
the iron and eteel stocks all shared in the day's
weakness. The concentrated selling referred to
largely converged on Amalgamated Copper an-1
Rock Island was a leader in the reaction. The
low temperatures In the corn belt and the ne
cessity of early warm weather to ln6ure. the
crcp from frost were considerably dwelt upon.
There was a considerable covering movement
at the beginning of the last hour, but the
tears made a iresn onslaught and forced a weak
closing at the lowest of the day. Declines in
the active list ran from 1 to 4 points. Some
early strength In the bond market gave Â¦ way
to heaviness in sympathy with stocks. Total

Trade in the fruit market was active under
a continued strong demand for local consump
tion and a steady inquiry for shipment on the
Puget Sound steamer. Fine Pears In wrap
pers, good hard Peaches and Grapes In crates
were eagerly Bought after for shipment and
readily commanded full figures. Receipts of
fruit from the river districts were light and
canners war* paying high prices for choice
Pears. Fancy Apples moved freely, but trashy
stock, which was plentiful, dragged at easy
rates. / Peaches In small packages continued
firm and cleaned up well, but offerings in bulk
were easy, as there was only one canner on the
market. Plums In boxes and crates were easy,
supplies being heavy and the shipping demand
light. Canning Plums were very scarce, and
what little came In sold readily at full figures.
Figs were more plentiful than for some ' time,
but moved off well at fairly steady prices. Nec
tarines were offering again and met with
prompt sale. Cantaloupes were in free supply
and easy, while Nutmeg Melons were very firm
In the morning, but weakened upon the receipt
of freBh supplies later In the day. Water
melons were pretty well cleaned up and sales
of flnellarge Melons were readily effected at
higher rates. Strawberries and Blackberries
were generally poor and soft and prices ranged
lower, with some very poor offerings selling be
low the quotations. Raspberries were in light
supply and firm at a* sharp advance.
â¢There is -nothing new to report in citrus
rrults. supplies of all descriptions being plenti
ful and the demand light. Ripe Bananas were
more plentiful and sold at a wide range as to
size of bunch. Pineapples were Â¦" steady at
firmer rates. â¢ Â¦ <

Though there is more Butter on the market
than last' week, the extra demand due to the
O. A. R. Encampment keeps the market firm
at the advanced prices.
Cheese rules steady at the old quotations.
Eggs are firm and somewhat higher, with
moderate stock. The demand is nothing extra,
however. , ,

the middle of- the day yesterday on account

Blushing is not an. art, neither is it a
sign of ill-breeding, as some unkind.peo
ple maintain. The fact is, it is just as
natural for some persons to. blush as it
is for others to turn pale. The same laws
of nature which govern the one rule gov
ern the other. The capillaries, or small
blood vessels which connect the arteries
and veins of the body, form, particularly
over the cheeks, a network so fine that it
is necessary to employ a microscope to
distinguish : them. Ordlnatily the blood
passes through these vessels In normal
quantities, leaving only the natural' com
plexion. But when some sudden emotion
take.s possession of -the heart its action
increases and an electric thrill Instantly
leaps to the- cheeks. The thrill is nothing
more than the rush of blood through* the
invisible capillaries just beneath the del
icate transparent surface of the skin.
The causes that bring about this condi
tion in the circulating system are called
mental stimuli. They consist of joy, an
ger, shame and many other emotions.
' Sudden \horror, remorse or fear, on the
contrary the nerves which con
trol the blood vessels, and' the face be
comes white. I Blushing and pallor result
from the Budden action of the mind on
the Â¦ nervosu system. " So If the mind be
forewarned and prepared " for emotions,
both habits can at least be partially over
come. But when the nervous system la
highly strung It would be a lifelong. It
not a futile task to endeavor to effect a
perfect cure. It is the. sensitive, nervous
girl wtfo blushes easily, while the Â¦ girl
stolid by nature, or who by conventional
education has her nerves under perfect
control, seldom Â¦ blushes.â St. James Ga

BEAL ESTATE TBANSACTIONS.
Councilman Howard and Fitzgerald re
quested that a statement be prepared for
the future . use of the Council touching
the assessments.
Councilman .Wallace, in making the mo
tion to deny the application, said he did
so because of the City Attorney/a opinion
and because the. company was doing all of
Its business in this city, jle considered the
assessment of $300 on Its franchise in San
Francisco, to ,be a subterfuge.
The water company's application to
have an assessment of $147,000 on solvent
credits was granted, on the ground thai
the figure represented the amount in liti
gation over water bills. An Item of $16,
650, money in bank, was also stricken
from the Â» rolls. '
The assessment on the West Oakland
railroad yards was reduced from $250,000
to $200,000 on real estate and from $50,000
to $40,000 on improvements. On Central
Pacific property at the . foot of Broadway
the assessment on real. estate was re
duced from $158,000 to $100,000, and on im
provements from $75,000 to $50,000. ;An.as
sessment of ; $50,000 on the block signal
system, was reduced to ?7BQ0. ( An assess
ment of $25,000 on one-half pf a franchise
on. the freight ferry : was' reduced to- $5,
but a like aasesmenfc on the, harbor ferry
system, with . terminus at the i foot of
Broadway, was not touched.
â¢ Division Superintendent W. . S. Palmer
appeared for the railroad, company. Dur
ing the discussion to-night Mr. Palmer
contended that the bulk of the property
along the water front other than that
owned by the railroad company was as
sessed at one-half and, In some cases, an
eighth as much as the company's hold
ings.
The City Council to-night, sitting as a
Board of Equalization, denied tha appli
catlpn of tho Contra Costa 'Water Com
pany to have the assessment of J1.05O.00O
on its franchises in the city of Oakland
cat off the rolls. This- action was taken
on an opinion filed by City Attorney Mc-
Elroy, who. said:
â¢The right to exist as a corporation 13
a franchise. The right to collect rates or
compensation for the use of water lÂ»y vir
tue of the constitution is. also a franchiso
and cannot be exercised except by author
ity of and in the manner prescribed by
law. The manner prescribed by law is
set forth in article XIV, section 1, and
by reason of the action of the legislative
body of this city, namely, Ita Council, an
ordinance was passed fixing water rates.
In my opinion the Contra Costa "Water
Company exercises a franchise in the city
of Oakland by reason of said legislative
act of said Council, authorized by the
constitution of the. State of California,
and said franchise is assessable by the
Assessor of the city of Oakland. Cal."

The trial of the suit of Maud Van
Buren against the Mountain Copper Com
pany. (Ltd.) was ended yesterday after
noon when the Jury returned a verdict
awarding the plaintiff damages in the
sum of $6760 for the death of her hus
band, John Van Buren. who was killed on
February 25, 1900, by a cave underground.
This was the second trial of the case,
the former 1ury having awarded Mrs. Van
Buren 515.000 damages, but a new. trial
wae granted by the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals.
The evidence was practically the same
on both occasions. It was shown that
John Van Buren was not a miner, but en
gaged as a laborer on the surface. Not
withstanding that fact, he was gut to
work a few days later in a stope which
was insufficiently timbered. Many wit
nesses testified that pieces of rock
"scaled" from the roof of the excavation,
bo much so that the foreman of one gang
of men ordered them out of tÂ»e dangerous
stope into a safer place. Ten minutes
later the "cave" occurred, killing Van
Buren and his seven fellow workmen.
Mrs. Van Buren was left destitute with
three minor children to suport.

MAUD VAN BX7REN WINS
.. HER SUIT FOR DAMAGES
Those in the secrets of the management
say that it has been definitely decided
that the addition to be built on the Cos
mos Club property will be exactly like
the part of which the walls have been
completed. It Is learned through a relia
ble source that the owners of the prop
erty on the southwest corner of Powell
and Post streets have offered to lease the
land on which present buildings stand,
the duration of the lease to-be twenty
years; and also to erect, on a lease basis
of six per cent of the cost of the build
ing, a structure to adjoin the St. Franci3
Hotel and to be like it in every regard,
connected with the St. Francis and, dur
ing the lease, to be an integral part of It.
This proposition has been made to the
parties back of the St. Francis Hotel and
it meets with favor, but no definite ac
tion has been taken. The addition pro
posed would give the St. Francis I-Iottt
nearly oi# thousand rooms in total and
make it one of the most imposing hotel
Structures in the world. â¢- .
There is a strong possibility that the
St. Francis Hotel, on Powell and Geary
streets, will be enlarged not only to take
in the, lot Juat north of the present struct
ure, which has been acquired by pur
chase, but that it will be extended the
same height and on the same . architect
ural, lines as the present large beginning,
until It takes in the entire frontage on
Powell street from Geary to Post and
running back on both Geary and Post
streets.

FALL FROM SCAFFOLDS
The City Engineer recommended the es
tablishment of grades on Twenty-first
avenue northerly from Lake street, and
filed a map showing the location of_a pro
posed right of way for an intercepting
sewer for the drainage of the blocks
northerly from Lake street, Sixteenth to
Twenty- fourth .avenues.
Regarding the petition of property
owners . that Buchanan and Webster
streets be graded between Hermann and
Market, the City Engineer reported that
the cost would be far in excess of one
half the assessed valuation of abutting
property and suggests that provision be
made for doing the work and assessing
the cost to a district.
Resolutions for private contracts were
adopted for the bituminlzlng of Twenty
third street between Dolores and Chatta
nooga; Twenty-fifth street between Fol
som and Treat avenue; Twenty-fourth
street between Vermont and San Bruno
avenue; Harrison street between Twen
ty-fourth and Twenty-fifth.
The specifications for the sprinkling,
repair and . maintenance of Point . Lobos
avenue were approved.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
declared forfeited the check for $240 de
posited .by Walter Cole after a contract
had been awarded to him to construct
sewers in the vicinity of Persia and
China avenues. Cole failed to enter into
the contract and consequently the check
was ordered deposited in the city treas
ury . In accordance with section 17, chap
ter 1, article 6 or the charter." This Is
the first instance on record of a check
having been confiscated ' by the city for
failure to assume a contract.-.
The board formally denied the applica
tion' of the Pioneer Automobile Company
for -a permit to erect a building four and
a half feet in excess of the legal height
at the corner of Golden Gate avenue and
Octavla street, although the Supervisors
had granted a permit by special ordi
nance which the Board of Public Works
holds is Illegal.
The" contract for macadamizing Arling
ton street was awarded to the San Fran
cisco Construction Company.
Another reason given by Mayor Schmitz
for not taking immediate action is that
Newhallhas only four and a half months
more to serve and he fails to see why
there should be any wild scrambling for
the office. Certain influences are at work
to force the .Mayor to take Newhall's
scalp, but his Honor is in no hurry to
grind the political axe9 of outside parties
who have failed to show any particular
Interest In his own welfare. .
"No officer of the city and county shall
absent himself from the State: but he
may once only during his term of office
so absent himself for a period of not more
than sixty days upon the written per
mission of the Mayor so to do. Viola
tion of this section shall be sufficient
cause for the removal of any officer vio
lating the same."
. Under the latter section official proof
would have to be produced that Newhall
had been absent from the State for more
than 'sixty , days. While proceedings for
his removal, which would be slow at best,
were under way he might return to the
city and In the event that he desired
to retain- the office could seek refuge be
hind the first section quoted on the plea
that hÂ« had not been absent sixty days
without leave. Under that section New
ball would have until October 18 next to
come within its provisions. The point Is
a fine one, and Mayor Schmltz realizes
its force.
Mayor Schmltz stated yesterday that
he would not take up the matter , of Po
lice Commissioner . NewhaJl jj overstaying
his leave of absence for probably a month
and would probably not take action In
the premises at all. Newhall's leave of
Bixty days expired last Tuesday and he
had all day yesterday to put in an ap
pearance, but did not do so. â¢ . ;Â¦
The language of the charter Is rather
ambiguous regarding the absence of city
officials, Mayor Schmitz thinks. He* points
to section 10 of article XVI headed "Mis
cellaneous," which says:
"An office becomes vacant when the in
cumbent â¢ â¢ â¢ shall have been absent
from the State without leave for more
than sixty consecutive days." .
Â¦According to this language. It would
appear that Newhall would have to re
main away for an additional sixty-one
days in order tb be rendered amenable
to the section quoted, as he has had per
mission to be absent from the State for
sixty days, which has Just expired.
