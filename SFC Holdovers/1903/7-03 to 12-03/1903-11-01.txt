Tbls satisfied Kanatto; then be sent for
M* picture book, the gift already rn.cn
ftantC, and went through it with Win
atcrae, page by page, like a child. His
LerdsMp had to tell the story of each
beast, and when the animal described
was one with which Kanatto was familiar
It was amusing to see his attention and
bis readiness to catch the narrator in a
falsehood or inaccuracy if possible. This,
however, he could not do, and after the
descriptions of the rhinoceros, lion, bush
antelope, elephant and zebra, he uttered
grunts of satisfaction, sometimes turning
back to them, caid "Tell again."
Further gifts concluded the night's en
, tertalnment and at dawn the expedition,
much refreshed by its halt on the high
ground, was ready to Bet for the river.
Kasatto offered an additional regiment
of fighting men. for the Ruaha bounded
bts country, and upon the other side of it
dwelt his enemiesâ the tribe of Slaga-
Mlga, who must now be Melflrum's ene
mies also, but Roy assured the monarch
that an escort to the boundaries of Ma
pora territory waa all his queen required.
Her enterprise was one of peace; she only
derlred to Eee a wondrous land which no
white queen had ever seen before; but
her heart was warm to all her fellow
zsanerchs and ehe bad no quarrel with
any among them.
Z>on this assertion Kanatto spoke with
tb'f; wisdom of experience, declared unl
vereal peace impossible to human nature
and warned the Queen of the Silver Sun
rise not to put her trust in the Maga-Mlga
} Â«r their monarch.
"The floor cf Unyah's dwelling is built
cf Ma;Â»ora 6kulls," he eald grimly, "but
T can wait; I am patient; his head will
ccme to me presently, and to-morrow I
will drink malwa out of the pan that to
day holds his lying brains."
"When we return from our Journey, If
the thought pleases you, and my Queen
allowE It. I will visit again the Elephant
Spirit." declared Lord Wlnstone, "and
Etind to you warnings and prophecies con
cerning this enemy of the Mapora."
Xanatto expressed great gratification
at this promise and bid the exepdltlon
farewell with a cordiality quite genuine
and far warmer than Uiat with which hs
bad welcomed it-
The way* led by high lands and deep
ra vines to the bed of the & can tic Ruaha
River, and the chart Indicated a- possi
bility of using that stream for a distance
of at least a hundred miles, if not more,
supposing canoes of eufSclent slz* and
stability were discoverable. The Mapora
had no canoÂ«s. for they employed the
river but seldom. They declared, how
ever, that their enemies possessed them:
but as to the Qualities of the Ruaha as
a navigable Etreaxn they could give little
information.
Long before the river was reached the
rainy season had begun and the same
dreary ohenomena were presented day
after day to a miserable and depressed
er^Pipany. The mornings often dawned
fine, though sullen clouds of mist now cov
ered most of the higher peaks and moun
tain crowns of the land and continued
to do so, replenished daily with cold tor
.rentlal rains. These usually began after
'f. o'clock and were often accompanied by'
tremendous thunder and lightning and a
sort cf livid darkness. The high lands
speedily became impassable under these
conditions and the wco(is < if less comfor
table, were less dangerous to life.
f Three days after leaving Kanatto two
of Meldrum's Zanzibarls died. Including
Ealem, whose wounds had only recently
healed. The poor creatures dropped out
of the racks Insensible and e\-ident!y sue-'
cumbed to sheer cold. Indeea tho whole
expeÂ£tlon suffered severely, for most of
the carriers wore the lightest clothes,
many from choice going almost Â° naked,
and now the temperature was often less
than CO degrees at nightfall, and the brav
est men axnonxr them grew -.cowed:- and
frightened. â¢ - . â¢â¢ -\-v : ;X'' ' 5Â£?vv?i
But after ten days cf loaff niarches the
Ruaha was reached without further. mis-'
fortune, and under its 'densely wooded
banks a temperature more congenial to
the natives from Zanzibar and the Soudan
was encountered.. The' awful rains,. how-
ever, regularly reduced camp to. a 'scene
of dire misery, end firewoou teas only pro-,

has no quarrel."
Then Bessie made answer: â¢Â¦.-'/-
"I desire no quarrel with Unyahâ far
from it. I have heard of his greatness
and majesty and power and am willing
to be his friend. We captured Unyah
perceiving him to be a very great man.
but not knowing that be was a king of
the MagSi-Mlga. We captured him think
ing that he~ would bear our messages of
friendship and good will to the King, but
behold this U bettsr still, for the King
himself comes among us and we welcome
him with rare gifts and will make a feast
for him before the day is over. The white
Qusen has corn* from afar off and ts at
peaos with all men. She brings but fifty
tubes of thunder medicine and fears not
to trust herself with the monarchs of the
land.
To-day ah* ts harm, ts-moiTOW shs has
AapartÂ«d. . Bhe has no enemies: she Is not
oonoÂ«rn*d with the feuds of the Uapera
and the Uaga-Mlga any more than 1 sha
Is concerned with the feuds of the buffalo
and Hon. She comes In peace and desires
that Unyah will permit her to pass
through his kingdom In peace, that bs
will 'grant her good store of canoes to
proceed .along his river ways, and that he
will pi^clalm among his people that the
Queen of the Silver Sunrise Is his friend.
"These messages I had designed to send
by the first of Unyah's subjects who fell
Into my power and so I sent my servants
to lay in wait and capture a man or wom
an of the Maga-MJga; but it is willed by
fate that we monarchs should meet face
to face and I am glad, most ancient and
famous King, that It Is eo."
The old man's face exhibited many va
rying emotions as these amiable senti
ments were conveyed to him piecemeal by
the assistance of two interpreters. At
the end of the speech he rose, bowed
twice, then, taking a crimson feather
from his wild bonnet, presented It to Bes
sie. She likewise bowed and placed the
feather In a big white Panama hat which
she usually wore.
Then Unyah spoke again:
"The Queen of the Silver Sunrls* Is
wiser than her years and Unyah, who nas
has lived through a hundred rains and
seen more new moons than there are
hairs In his head, will make a friendship
and a compact and will lend the queen
ten great canoes and will bestow upon her
people twenty days' rations of millet and
plantain ;~and Unyah will send gifts to the
white queen; for though his head Is red
with blood and he has walked In blood to
his knees, yet he has no love for war, but
would rather be a man of peace and see
no spear shaken upon his coming and no
war cry lifted against his warriors."
Then the Mapora soldier who acted as
Interpreter had something to say on his
own account, and he Implored Winston*
to permit him and h!s friends to convey
the defenseless Unyah to Kanatto. Ha
explained that the white queen could not
by any possibility be the friend of both
monarchs. and' be swore by all the oath*
he knew that once of th* friends of
Kanatto were well into the territory of
his rival they would surely be surround
ed, betrayed and destroyed. To trust
Unyah was to trust a hyena. Not to
destroy him now or give him to his hun
gry enemy was to release the snake un
der the ' heel, to pardon the stinging
wasp, to rescue the drowning beast of
prey. Â¦'. '.
But Lord Winston* naturally felt In
disposed to listen to these suggestions,
and King Unyah, being now quite satis
fled of his safety, ottered of his own free
will to stay as the guest of the 'travelers
until his messenger could reach his capi
tal, situated some miles up the river, and
bring therefrom the necessary, cjanoes and
stores. The difficulty centered' with the
Mapora aborigines, for Kanatto's people
were already clamoring to depart, and
If one escaped and got Inland half a
day's march, news of Unyah's capture
would reach his rival and a rapid raid
result. The King himself speedily show
ed means of escape from this difficulty.
"Cross to my side of the Ruaha and
you are safe," he said. "A mile below
here the stream narrows somewhat, and
It may be possible to get a .ew canoes,
which will suffice to take your party to
the other side. Do this to-morrow; but
meanwhile I will send my servant la
his canoe. Give him a day's start of
the Mapora and he will rejoin us In forca
before they can do us any hurt. Besides
they have no canoes, and If they attempt
to reach us your thunder medicine will
pour their blood upon the river. With
my men shall come one from the far
coast land who is skilled In Swahlll; then
may we speak without need of this good
and sinewy warrior, servant of Kanatto."

ference terminated for the time being.

Literary Section"P'raps dat Raalt, he kill Abdullah or

hunter.
"Very likely, Indeed, Blackbird, but he

ammunition most likely, perhaps both.
The/ want to get out of danger and push
on until they can find some powerful
friends; then they'll come back and dig
up the spoil, no doubt."
Lord WInstone's theory proved correct,
and both boxes of ammunition appeared
three feet below the earth. These by his
direction were covered up again as speed
ily as possible, a hasty meal was taken
and all were soon upon the march again.
The progress of the robbers waa now
sufficiently obvious, for they took no
trouble to conceal it, and upon- reaching a
belt of rough land, mostly underbrush,
.the party opened out and proceeded in a
line, each In sight of his neighbor. Black

Winstone at the right hand of the col

A cry from one of the scouts attracted
Lord Winstone' s attention, and, ap
proaching, he discovered that the man
had found a large, new made mound, al
most' grave-like in Its shape. It was hid
den in a little patch of brush, and two
rough native spades of wood lay beside It.
"They've burled something! Quick with
the spades! We must be away in half an
hour at latest."
"Dey very fullâ full to the froat wld

"They're off." said Winstone. "I should
calculate they've got the Â»tart of us by
about four mile3, or a little more if any
thing; and an they'll probably put in
about ten miles to-day; we must go four

smoke yonder. Then we'll see what their

The Zanzibarls grunted satisfaction at
this programme. One or two among .them
Were suffering agonies from undigested
hippopotamus, but they put on a stoical
front, and soon, over fairly open ground,
the party was plodding forward at the
rate cf nearly three miles an hour.
In an hour and a half they reached the
deserted camp to find evidences of a
feast. Two cans, of tinned milk, which
were among the purloined stores, had
been opened and emptied, and the re
mains cf a bush antelope indicated that
Raait and his party had enjoyed a heavy
meal of meat.
Blackbird grinned and pointed to the
bones.
- Then, while yet- the sun- was below the,
horizon, the party- wtnt forward, topped
the hill and found the sticks In a Una
that pointed almost due south. The pre
caution proved unnecessary, however, for
pursuers wtre astir before pursued, and
the runaways, unconscious of, the near ap
proach of danger, still dawdled at their
morning meal, as a thin column of- smoke,
rising like a blue thread into the gray
air, testified. But even as they looked
it waned and died away.
Lest the smoke of their fires should'
serve as a signal to Raalt and his ac
complices. Lord Winstone went without
his cup of coffee on the' following morn
ing, and the. men of his contingent were
content to make .a cold breakfast of
plantain flour and water. Some revisited

â¢which, required two men to carry it (and
which he knew it would be impossible
to hÂ«=nr further than the Â¦ limit -of the

also received ivory, together with a most
pressing offer to remain with Unyah as
his head man. Acquainted with this
proposition he made answer:

The matter ended with a display of
much bad feeling between the different
bodies of men, a circumstance in some
respects serious, as it was necessary that
all should work together for at least an

Two days passed, and still the petty
thefts continued. Then came a crowning
disaster, and with it the sensational ex
planation of the whole mystery.
Seventy miles of the tortuous Ruaha
River had now been traversed, and an
excellent rate of progress maintained,
considering the numerous rapids and
falls. Then the nature of the Burround
ing country began to change: the pre
vailing forest thinned somewhat; Inter
vals of grass land became more frequent,
and once or twice herds of zebra, ante
lope and other gregarious beasts were
seen, though at considerable distances.

drew toward its close with the advent of
May, physical conditions soon promised
to be more pleasant in Â«very respect.

A system of barefaced peculation was

large ones It would have been impossible
to carry forward and still conceal. Man
after man, both Zanzlbaris and the na

complaints, but -threats and the use of
spies similarly failed to find the thief or

Then it was that an incident involving
loss of life and unexpected treachery
within the ranks darkened the days ot

the true and tremendous significance of
the event or they had endured far deeper
anxiety and mental suffering than was
the case.
Steady and uneventful progress waa

advancing company; then tha Mapora,
vanished and were seen no more, for their
lands were past.
."We'll go hunting, notwithstanding."
said his lordship. "There'll be a slight
variation in the quality of the sport,
that's all. ' The rascals probably mean to\

Meldrum agreed with his friend's sug

the neighborhood, made a careful search

Thus, when the dawn came, he would
know his way and be able to proceed by
compass on a course, as direct as possi

With guns and torches, he left the fires
and proceeded twenty yards upward to the
point of tha light bill on which the camp
was pitched. From here, with his glass,
he swept the dark scene below, hoping,

ken the glimmering: campflre of the fugi

of sudden and terrible catastrophe, of a
sleep whose waking would be death.
Â¦ For a fire Lord Winstone looked, there
fore, and his scrutiny waa at length re
warded. After some time, like a dim red
star on the inky darkness spread beneath
the sky, he detected a little spot of flame.
To calculate Its remoteness was beyond
yie watcher's power. It might have been
any distance between three and ten miles
from the hill; but its position greatly
pleased the discoverer, for the lofty point

Where tha edges of a lofty sand 'dune
covered with mimosa scrub and coarse
grass broke abruptly Into a low shelf
overhanging the marshy margins of a pool
there was evidence of an accident. The
overhanging shelf had broken away un
der feet of beast or men, and a raw stain
1ft the abraded sandy rock revealed a frac
ture of extremely recent date.
Below Lord WinstonÂ© found exactly
whit he sought in the damp sand at the
water's edge, for here appeared the print
of -a naked foot, while a yard beyond it
was a deep and sharp indentation evi
dently caused by the pressure of some
regularly shaped object.
Blackbird, who had served English mas
ters on more than one big sporting expe
dition .to Somallland, Killma Njaro and
elsewhere,. now spoke and read the signs
before him without difficulty.

No further evidence of the runaways
rewarded Lord wfnstone on that day. A
good twelve miles was traversed before
dusk, then his Lordship got* a shot at a
young hippopotamus and camp was
pitched on a little hillock above the
plains. Here a borna . was constructed,
flree lighted and a rough sleeping place
of dry brushwood erected for the Eng
lishman. A steak from the young hippo
potamus turned out excellent fare and tho
Zanzlbaris, long strangers to flesh, con
sumed enormous Quantities of the men.
Soon after dark the. hollow, metallic
growl of a lion was heard,- and a glance
In the ' direction of the sound showed
two little green lamps that shone steadily
together, scarcely thirty yards., from the
hedge of the boma. A redhot firebrand
hurled in his direction sent the beast off
with another angry growl; and the cir
cumstance reminded Lord Winstone of a
duty necessary before he finally turned
in. . .
Bessie . herself reported some crave
losses. While she slept, her 'tent had
been entered, doubtless by Bungani, and
a leathern dressing case, containing
brushes, combs, bottles, needles and
thread, and many little odds and ends,
had been abstracted. " ; ,
The poor girl was crying, for greater

Meldrum's Golden Fetich.
"Nothing else mattered really," â¢' she
During the night, tha Arab, Raalt. with
two Zanzlbarisâ Mabruki .(whose family

had disappeared. "Bessie's, Kaffir boy,
Bungani, was also invisible 1 , and, what
appeared even more serlqus, the default
ing- quartet had carried with them five
rifles, two boxes of ammunition, one box
of trinkets, two bales of cloth and num
berless trifle*.
Lord Winstone was up betimes on th,e
morning .of his little expedition, but not
before bad news had run like wildfire
from one end of the camp to the other.

Personally. I don't attach any value to

"But It noble eport. sar, hunting de
Raalt in de bush." .
"I don't agree with you. I'd soonsr
shoot a lion than a Zanzibar Arab any
day. He's a much finer beast, look at
him how you will."
A man on the left of the line suddenly
raised a shout and the rest closed In upon
him to make a startling discovery. Hang
ing before the party, bound by his neck,
wrists and ankles to a tree, appeared a
naked body of. the wretched Kaffir boy.
Bessie's special attendant.
The unfortunate Bunganl was quit? un
conscious and apparently dead. His head
hung forward, every muscle waa relaxed
and marks of heavy blows were apparent
on his breast and face. Already, above
him in the tree, black vultures with naked
necks and eyes like gems, hopped clum
sily, waiting; while the lad's discoverer
had frightened two hyenas from before
him as he approached the spot.
"He's not dead, all the same." said
Winstone, "or those brute* up there
wouldn't have waited. They know, aa
well as a doctor, when the heart has
pulsed its last and they never peclc aa
eye that can see them."
The unhappy Bunganl wu released,
Â¦tretched on hla back in the shade, rub

whisky from WInstone's pocket pistol.
Whereupon he showed signs of returning
consciousness, and within half an hour,
after further doses from the spirit flask,
had recovered sufficiently to sit up and
recognize those about him.
Every moment was precious, and ir

from the Kaffir thus miraculously re

on with Blackbird and six others, lead

Bunganl was strong enoug-h to eat a lit

What the boy could say confirmed pre

Ing place at the entranca of Bessie's tent,
had awakened to find a knlfa at hla
breast, had turned coward in the terror
of the moment, had crept to tha tide of
the blankets where Bessie lay sleeping
soundly and had taken the treasure from
its usual place beside her. Already over
laden, Raalt hesitated a moment with tha
bag In his hand, but his cupidity proved
too great for the necessary sacririce. and
not content with the little oilskin packet,
Â¦which held the talisman, he had stolen
the bag itself and ail that it contained.
Bungani was tfien given his choice of
flying with Raaft and the ofiurs or hav
ing his throat cut; and he naturally chd.4e
the former alternative. He was heavily
burdened and forced to keep pace with
the men.. _
Their design, as he learned, was .^an
ticipate the main expedition and reach tha
country of one Narratambo by land be
fore the tlothla- should do so. Once there
they hoped, to win the chief and peopÂ«
at \.hfi country. and overwhelm Meldrum '7
" forces.
Not far from Narratambo's territory
Raalt had a brother on a big s!ave-rai<J
"ing expedition, and the rascal had elabo
rated a cunning plot by which he might
ultimately join forces with the Arabs in
the north, attack Narratambo's forces,
when they could "no lunger bo of service
to' him. and so, in the luns run. acquire
for himself the total wealth of the,,
s.aughtertd English.
As for Bungani, he had himself to thank
for his pnsent critical condition. Soon
after the burial of the ammunition boxts
he had conceived the idea of e^capins and
returning to the expedition, but his effort
was' Ill-timed and Raalt himselfâ a man
as fleet of foot aa a springbokâ fairly ran
him down In the open.
As the Kaffir could be of little further
use, Abdullah suggested putting a bullet j
through his head, but Raalt saw no rea
son to waste a good cartridge and Bun
ganl was therefore condemned to a linger
ing end and fastened to the tree until
wild beasts should destroy him. Thus the
cruelty of the Arab had outwitted its own
object and his intended victim was still
alive to testify against him.
Lord Winstone now pushed on with all
possible speed. The country grew wilder,
but not more difficult, as he proceeded
and while hour followed hour his anxinvis
eyes pierced the distance upon asceCS.r.z
each elevation, for now he believed him
self to be at close Quarters with ths rob
ber trio. . .
He had proceeded six miles from tha
spot where Bungani was found when tÂ»
his amazement, at the edge of a Ul&k
jungle of tall yellow gassea and scrub,
his sight fell full upon two Winchester
rifles and Bessie's leather dressing case.
There was no mistake and having been
informed of Its contents by the owner of
the bag, Lord Wnistono was now able to
check all that it held.
Bessie's property proved Intact, save la
one particular; the golden fetich had van
ished. Seeing tha importance that Raalt
had attached to the talisman ha doubt
less deemed It more precious than any
thing else In the bag and had hidden it
about his person. Then, however, other
appearances attracted hi3 Lordship.
The high grass was crushed down close
at hand; a gory turban lay on It; there
were also Indications of a struggle and
wet blood spattered the ground in sev
eral directions.
His first thought was that the thieves
had fallen out among themselves and that
Raalt, now within one day's march of
his destination, had treacherously turned
upon his accomplices; but a horrified
shout from Blackbird soon drew him Into
the brake. The negro had found the so
lution of the mystery.
"Me Card, massa! Snakes an* little ap
ples! De man Raaltâ him hereâ him dead
âhim killâ him eat by liona, sar! O golly
boo! Bery uncomferable time dat Marse
Raalt hab. Him pain in him 'tomach for
certain!"
The nature- of the Arab's horrible death
was manifest. Trudging forward jksith
two guns In one hand, the dresslngtrasa
'in the other, he had skirted the jungle
jj and been suddenly stricken down by a
hidden beast without one chance of fight.,-
Then the wretch had been dragged Into ML
lair at the heart of the brake and tha*
hungry brute had straightway fallen upon
its human meal.
The man's skull was smashed and his
neck broken by the lion's charge, and
now he lay horribly mutilated. The soft
poctlons of his frame below the ribs were
all gone: his abdomen was entirely eaten,
his scanty loin cloth torn away, hla left
band bitten off and devoured.
Whether Raalt's couu-anions had made
any effort to save him was doubtful. The
evidence pointed to a sudden flight on
their part, for two more guns were found
close at hand, together with two cases of
stores and coods. Both men had van
ished, and with them they had evidently
taken but one rifle.
"They were terrified by the sudden at
tack on their leader, flung down their
burdens and ran for their lives," decided
Winstone.
Then Blackbird touched his arm.
"De l^on not far off. sar. Him paw
marks here, and dey red an' wet still."
"Begad! It was the approach of our
party that frightened him away, no doubt.
This is an o!d lair. Look at those ante
lope bones. Well, well, our task ia done
. I suppose. Hunt very carefully through
every inch of grass and all around for
that blessed golden toy, and look In this
poor brute's loin cloth and turban, which
were all the. clothes he appears to have
troubled himself of late. We shar,.Â£ever
be forgiven if we don't bring baeC the
disk, Keep awake, too, for your owa
sakes. There are lions very close."
But most careful search, though it
brought to light the remaining rifle and
sundry other articles dropped by Abdul-
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Attracted by his screams they rushed in
a body- to his rescue with shouts and
yells; but though they frightened a lion
from its prey, they came too late to have
their comrade. The muscles of his back
were literally torn off the man. and he
perished before his friends could carry
him back or summon aid.
A halt of three days was called, and
general barter for food entered into with
the friendly aborigines; while a Bmall ex
pedition of twelve men, under Lord Win
stone, was told off for a two days' hunt
ing 1 triD in order that the camp might be
supplied with a little fresh meat, of
which it stood much in need.
The expedition had only lost one man
from fever during the past three weeks,
but the rains were responsible for a good
deal of debility. Ten of the Zanzlbaris
and Soudanese, though not actually
prostrated, were nearly useless from
weakness, and among the white men
both Tracy Fain and Lord Winstone were
Invalids. The latter, however, declared
himself quite equal to a couple of days'
sport, and while Roy remained in cemp
and looked after his oousin, the hunter
chose his men and perfected a plan of
attack on the big game of the district.
Heavy antelope were of course desired,
but Winstone in his secret heart hoped
for sport of a different nature as well.
Lions were plentiful, and on the first
night of the temporary halt a luckless
Maga-Mlga, straying beyond the bo'ma
around the boatmen's camp after the
fires were lighted, ' had been stricken
down and destroyed within thirty yards
of his friends.
The Maga-Mlga. on the contrary, must
soon be going back with their canoes;
and to abstract the effects of the expe
dition would be easy enough for them, be
cause they had only to bury their stolen
goods in the ground and blaze a tree
hard by the spot. That done they could
pathtr ur. the treasure at their ease upon
the homeward Journey.
Ac an answer to this, the other side
again protested their innocence, and re
minded Meldrum that they had no con
trol either of stores or goods: that they
slept at night in a camp of their own
making some distance from the expedl-
Raalt, representing his party, pointed
out that the Zanzlbaris must be guilt
kss. for how could they conceal anything
now that their scanty kits had been ex
amined? Again, if they hid tha stolen
articles by the wayside on the march,
they did evil to no purpose, for they
might never return by this route. Indeed,
it was most improbable that they would
do so.
AM private kits were publicly examined
without result and then a conference was
htld between representatives of the dif
ferent interests. Raalt, the Arab head
man, spoke for the Zanzibarl bearers and
Soudanese; v.-hile two leaders from the
boatmen stood for Unyah's people and Roy
Meldrum himself presided. But a long
and unsatisfactory wrangle was the only
result of the investigation.
the Maga-Miga were loud in their protes
tations of Innocence and Implored their
white leaders to search them and the
scanty property they carried for the van
ished articles.
said, "but I Mow what store Roy and
his cousin set on the disk. Mr. Fain will
never forgive me."
"Hang Mr. Fain," said Lord Winstone
shortly. ".That's thy least important
thing of the lot. First /our own comfort
is involved, which nobody can regret
more than I do; secondly, we've lost five
guns, which is frightfully serious, in my
opinion; thirdly, we've been robbed by
our own menâ a nice for the
aborigines. Raaht is at the bottom of
this. I never met an honest Arab yet."
"Us must get on the varmint's track
if us can. He's got some rascally plan in
his ugly" head, though what 'tis you'm
more like to know than me.. The camoes
be all right, so he'm ashore somewhere,
I reckon. Perhaps he's got friends in
camp yet, as'U tell what his game be, if
us can squeeze the truth out of 'em."
But Dan found himself mistaken. The
raid took everybody by surprise, and
even Lord Winstone, after a lengthy in
quiry, was constrained to admit the van
ished Raalt had no friends left behind
him. Kow that he was gone twenty of
his own men brought forward . stories to
tell against him. He was a mischief
maker; he never spoke well of the white
men behind '.heir backs; he had sounded
more than one of the coast bearers as
to the advisability of throwing off the
yoke and mastering their leaders while
they slept. Now, not : one among them
knew of the vanished rascal's destina
tion, or the nature -of his enterprise.
.With Winstone went Blackbird as gun
bearer, and the two men walked a hun
dred yards ahead of their armed squad.
A wild but easy country for traveling
rolled around them in light forest, bush
and grass. Reed swamps also occurred
and as they met the efflux of the tribu
tary and began \ to follow its banks in
land, evidences of big game became most
frequent, though no sign of the robbers
rewarded a sharp lookout.
Before a brief midday halt, however,
Blackbird's keen eyes made a discovery
that created some excitement and acted
as an Incentive to additional exertion at
By 9 o'clock in the morning the two* de
tachments set off. "Their constitution had
been carefully considered, and only the
most active and hardy volunteers, were
chosen, for great speed had to be main
tained and forced marches would be the
order of the day.
They proceeded in different directions to
the points at which the tributaries ran
into the main stream, and it was then
arranged that each party should work up
a side of the triangle until they met, near
its apex. At the same time scouts were
to be thrown out, though never beyond
the sound of gun fire from T their main
party; and thus it was hoped to cover as
much ground as possible and overtake or

stream as Its base, these tributaries
formed a rough triangle of country, and
now two parties set forth, one under con

Lord WinBtone.

discovery: that the travelers had come
out Into the world to make friends of the
mighty ones of the earth, and that On
gasse had naturally teen among those thÂ«
Queen of the Silver Sunrise most desired
to propitiate and honor.
"It 1Â» our wish to pass in peace through
your kingdom." concluded Lord Winstone
"We then desire to proceed, if it Is well,
through the land called Lunda to the Lua
pula River, that flows between the great
waters."
"And then?"
"Then we desire to see the country ot
the Batoncas; and then, if all is still well,
we shall return to our own land."
"It will take many moons."
"Ongasse Is always right It wilL"
Subsequently the King informed Mel
drum that two days later he and a band
of his warriors were marching some fifty
miles to the western quarter of his terri
tory. There had been trouble on the fron
tiers with a strong tribe in the Lunda
countryâ the Massegl. Already the Nan
gattos were in force against the enemy,
but it was felt that the presence of the
King and his picked troops would be nec
essary to restore peace.
"Our road is your road." explained hla
Majesty. "We will travel henceforth at
friends. The road is good."
A map of the country was shown to
Ongasse after Fain had carefully printed
the King's name upon his territory in red
Ink. This pleased the monarch much. He
traced their route and showed Meldrum
that the proposed escort wouM extend
over about sixty miles of country, but aa
it was explained to /Roy that such a
march would occupy ten days, he realized
that the Nangattos would go somewhat
too fast for his' own carriers.
This was a difficulty speedily sur
mounted, however, fop Ongasse promptly
ordered off thirty of his own men to share
the. burdens of the expedition and thua
accelerate Its progress.
#1 You will have rich and rare gifts for
me, I know full well.' 1 he said, "but keep
them until we reach our Journey's end.
Then it may be that you will love me
more than at present, so that the gifts
will be still better. And I will give you
great store of food, that you may not
starve in the hungry kingdom of the Mas
segi before you reach the river."
Amicable relations were thus estab

good cause to bless fortune. Indeed. Dar

Though the element of personal rtsi
and . anxiety lacked from this combined
progress, it was not without Incidents re
quiring careful adjustment . Tact often
saved friction and the heads of respective
companies continued on excellent terms,
but the rank and file quarreled not a lit
tle. And on the third day of the march
came news of the theft of a rifle and a
cartridge belt One Ben Soud. a Soudan
ese, had slept with his weapons beside
him and awakened to find them gone.
He had promptly thrashed two Nangattoa
and, in his turn, been roughly mauled by
a dozen others.
Ongasse took the matter rery seriously
when rigid search failed to find the cul
prit, who had doubtless hidden his treas
ure on the night of the theft The King's
concern at this circumstance appeared
perfectly genuine, and he decreed that
one course of action alone would serve
to unite the forces in friendly bonds and
prevent further misunderstandings and
mischief.
"I have asked my wise men." he said,
"and my medicine womanâ she who la
carried' by bearers, and who sleeps not
under the stars, but lies beneath a tent
of leopard skin. I have asked them all
and they speak with one voice. There
must be blood brotherhood performed be
tween myself and the white queen's head
counselor. Between hei and me there
can be no blood brotherhood, in that she
is a woman and I am a man.'*
"It Is well," answered Bessie, mightily
relieved to learn some more or less un
pleasant ordeal had been escaped. "I
will appoint my own dear Bana Mkuba
to represent me, great King." -
A halt of one day was called and the
ceremony ' of Blood Brotherhood enacted
with all fitting pomp and circumstance.
The aged medicine woman, who lived in
a leopard skin tent and was carried by
bearers upon the march, proved to be a
power in the ceremony; for though a fee
ble and ailing crone apparently, she yet
rose toi- great heights of tragic signifi
cance during the operation, attired her
self for it in amazing raiment and herself
handled the knife and poured the salt.
Unluckily for Meldrum, the Nangattos*
particular , ritual of Blood Brotherhood
was not aa simple or Inoffensive aa that
of many tribes. Their rite followed the
procedure of the Congo savages, and in
volved sundry operations that Roy view
wlth much Inward disgust But ' he
flinched not, and conducted himself with
all proper propriety and self-control from

The day began In rejoicings and beat-
Ing of drums and dances; then a sort of
rough dais waa spread with fresh green
leaves, and around It there gathered the
prominent representatives of both par
ties.
A special seat within sight of the oper
ation was arranged for Bessie, and about
her collected Tracy Fain, Lord Winstone,
Hook and Omar Laluzi, the remaining
Arab head man; while in an. outer ring
the Zanzibaris stood with the Soudanese
and formed the lesser part of a circle
which was completed by the natives.
On the other side Ongasse'a general of
ficers and wise men assembled; then the
priestess appeared. She was attired, like
a. veritable harpy, in rags and feathers,
with red paint on her hideous breasts and
withered face, and a petticoat of cloth
woven from reeds and daubed with many
colors.

quired Ong-asse, shortly.
"We did not come upon your land until

who knew the dialect, having had a couplÂ«

Tanganyika. "We are here as friends, and

"You come with some intent to steal oi

"Yet there is time. She sends you by

The gift was a purple umbrella with

presented to the King.
"I will go and make ready <o meet

thank your White Queen, and I will eat
with her and drink with her before the

He retired, making quite unregal haste,

"We're In luck." said Â¦Winstone. "Here's

stone was this:
"Horrid little imp! How does he 'dare
to say 6uch a thing?"
What Lord Winstone replied to the king
ran in a different fashion.
i "The Queen of the Silver Sunrise would
have gladly wedded with the king of the
Nangattos: but, alas! she has given her
word to Bana Mkuba, and In our coun
try a aueen's word Is more sacred than
a. common man's oath. She cannot wed
any other than Bana Mkuba."
"Then tell her to kill Bana Mkuba. His
life Is hers If she is a queen."
Winstone did not take the trouble to
translate this sinister suggestion.
"She loves Bana Mkuba wlt;h her whole
leart In our country no woman has more
than one husband, even though she be
j. queen, and no man has more than one
wife." ' â¢
"A strange .country! Then tell Bana
Mkub#. that I will give him twenty wives
If he will suffer the .white queen to wed
me." ' ; â¢
"It is -useless, King Ongasse; our people
love In a way unlike your . people. : Two
hundred of your most beautiful maidens
would not take the place of the white
jueen In Bana Mkuba's heart"
"A man must have a small heart If he
:an only be good to one woman."
"Before .marriage all white men think
jne wife will be enough."
"And after?'.'
"Afterward I believe they often find
>ne wife is too many." answered his
L/ordship", who was a bachelor*
"Ha! ha! You are a wise man. And as
for your big prince there. I will give him
jood store of cattle and lands, and I will
rive him four of my own wive3 and make
ilm u mighty leader among my people If
ie yields the queen to me. Now, tell him
:hat"
Lord Winstone interpreted the offer,
ind Meldrum's face grew fiery red
through Its tan and freckles. . .
"Tell him I'll knock his ugly black
head off In half a "minute! His wives, In-
Jeed! And Bessie to marry him! Irapu
lent little monkey!"
The other translated:
"Bana Mkuba grows hot, Ongasse, ac
:ordlng to the custom of his country. Ho
those who forget to worship them, and
give their bodies to their enemies and the
vultures. Be kind to your great, roaring
gods and feed them well, and give them
sweet water to drink and ripe plantains
to 'eat. else they will talk fire at you.
too, and it will be ill with you, and the
hyenas. will have a strange taste upon
their tongues."
"You speak very wisely, and I thank
you. Farewell. We shall never forget
your goodness," concluded Lord Win
stone.
"Farewell. I am glad you came to my
country, but I do not want you to come
back again unless your Thunder Gods
tell you to do so."
So the palaver ended, and the expedi
tion wound forward upon its way. Good
progress was made, and at the end of
August, or rather less than eight months
from the beginning of their -ou-ney. Mel
drum's little band reached the Stevenson
road.
They had now traveled about 650 miles
and a distance of 300 at least still sepa
rated them from the Wambaslâ that" trib
utary of the Luapula River on which the
Batoncaa had their stronghild.
.â¢ Death and disaster had . thinned their
. numbers; Raalt was gone, with not a few
of the Zanzibaris and Soudaneseâ seven
in all, but the leaders of the expedition,
-though each had suffered*- more or less,
were for the most part little the worse.
Bessie had surprised everybody and de
lighted Roy by her splendid pluck and
sustained physical health. Her poor don
key had not been so fortunate, for he fell
very lame in the off hind leg. and for two
days in the billy country she walked to
rest him. Now he had recovered and was
once more invaluable to his rider.
A high rate of fair health had been
maintained from the outset t and Fain
pointed out that the regularity of good
food might be thanked for that fortunate
fact In most cases of Central African
travel one of the great, Indeed the great
est, perils results from the danger of
starvation. Thus far, however, that aw
ful calamity had not threatened Mel
drum's expedition and it still carried am
ple ' reserves of tinned goods, soup and
milk.
As for the' Individual members of the
party, all pulled well enough with Roy,
and he waa an Ideal leader, the life .of the
expedition, always cheery and cheerful,
. always with sufficient reserves of good,
spirits and pluck to Impart both where
there appeared signs of falling hope or of
courage broken under suffering. -
The lesser evils evenâ the evils of sting
ing and biting and poisoning, the evils of
Insect life, of the noisome creeping things
. that bury themselves In a tired man's
flesh while he sleeps, and rot thereâ these
plagues were not enough to quench his
â¢Unconquerable spirit
Lord Winstone represented the brains
of the party, and with Roy and Bessie he
got on uncommonly .well; but Dan Hook
was frightened of him, while between his
Lordship and Fain there had arisen a
very evident lack of sympathy.
Tracy Faln's part, up to this stage in
the expedition, was not of a nature to
excite special attention or require partic
ular description. He snapped and snarled
a good deal and was heartily disliked by
the carriers and soldiers, to whom he nl-
ways spoke with insolent and short
sighted disrespect In truth he was not
nappy, and his nebulous Idea of acquiring
the diamonds for himself became less and
less promising as he regarded it in tho
light of his present experiences. Not that
he had altered his real attitude toward
Roy; indeed, the old contempt quickly
ripened into hatred after Bessie Ogllvie
bad made her choice.
All that was worst in the man now ran
riot in secret, when darkness fell upon
the camp and only the red eyes of the
fires, the monotonous tread -of the sen
tries."or the roar of a hungry beast dis-.
turbed the night At such times he suf
fered his passion to shake him while Win
stone and Meldrum slept; at such times
he felt a kinship with- the lion 'and
yearned to fall headlong upon his inno
cent foe.
But these ebullitions were hidden from
the mortal eye. In public Fain preserved
scrupulous politeness, studied Bessie and
his cousin, shirked no trial or difficulty
In which they "had to participate and
bore his share of the burden and heat
of the'day without flinching.
Definite plans for the future he had
none. He cherished his secret still, but
lost heart about performing the act of
. villainy from no prompting to rectitude
and honor, but because he doubted much
if his scheme would prove 0 possible of
execution. ;
Bo far as Bessie was concerned, ho stlil
hungered for her in secret, and even de
bated the possibilities of creating a divi
sion in the camp to aid him; but he was
too unpopular to win followe.**, and not
made of the stuff to achieve his pur
pose against odds by oourage and fotce
of character.
"Life Is precarious here; Jt hangs en a
thread for all of us. He may be the
next" That was Tracy Faln's cecret
thought And so, he watched and waited,
eating his heart out; and more than once
it was not fever but passion that Mel
drum saw In his eyes when he commis
erated with the man, bid him be pf stout
heart and take more quinine.
The Stevenson road was du'.y passed and
good progress made. Then there came a
dayâ early In Septemberâ when the expe
dition found itself in the Urungu coun
try, at the confines of a powerful mon
arch's territory, and before tho capital
ot a potentate who could place full 20,000
spears in the field. *
Meldrum/s road lay directly through this
gentleman's kingdom, and as the friend
ship of Ongasse must be absolutely neces
sary before further progress could be
made a strong position was chosen, camp
pitched, and zarebas of extra stoutness
erected in case of difficulties.
"To-morrow we will pay him a friendly
call if he doesn't take the initiative," said
Roy. "He's got a big town, by Jove!"
As he spoke his eyes roamed over the
capita] of the Nangattos, where it spread
with gray and â¢ golden thatches" set In
green acres of plantain Â«.nd encircled by
the silver arm of a little river. A mile
separated the expedition from the village,
and - Roy's j camp* was situated on -. rising
ground at an elevation of some 500 feet
above the valley.
-CHAPTER XVIL *
THE BLOOD BROTHERHOOD. .
King Ongasse slept but 111 that night,
and his head turned many times upon ltd
little wooden ' pillow. He was a young
monarch, barely 25' years of age, but a
man of some Intelligence, and the expedi
tion now camped over against him caused
him much uneasiness, for he waa not un
familiar with firearms in. the hands of re
morseless Arabs,^nd' he, knew that they
meant death and misery and destruction.
That he could easily, wipe out the little
band above him on the mountainside he
had no shadow of doubt, however, and
the only problem in his mind as he waited
uneasily for dawn was a question of pol
icy and a dim uncertainty concerning the
strange people who ' thus thrust them
selves into the lion's Jawa. *
They came In such small force that he
found It hard to believe they designed any
act. of aggression, while, on the other
more than one of the carriers Incurred
a bad spear wound by wandering off
alone into the plantain patches.
Farther on, when the end of August
was nearly reached, and it became a
question of days only to the Stevenson
road, the natives assumed the offensive
and threatened serious trouble. They
regularly deserted their villages before
the column, and so saved the output of
beads and grass wire; but they per
sisted in unfriendly actions, assem
bled In large numbers on the uplands
and hills through which Meldrum's
party was progressing, and harassed
the rear with threats and insults.
Several Individuals of this tribe had
been captured and sent back to their
companions with gifts and protestations
of friendship; but they continued un
amiable, and at last, after a more than
usually trying day with gathering crowds
of the aborigines on either side of the
expedition, Winstone advised Meldrum to
deal more sharply with them and try tho
effect of a little counter demonstration.
Accordingly, on the following morning,
about the hour that luncheon was taken,
the Soudanese were drawn up in fighting
trim and with them the four Englishmen,
ten Zanzibaris and the two Arabsâ a de
tachment of twenty-five guns.
"Fire!" rang out the great voice of Roy;
then twenty-four rifles bellowed out to
gether and a little storm of lead hissed
into and shrieked over the enemy, where
they were massed some 150 yards distant.
Five . men fell instantly and a mighty
shriek of amazement and horror rose
from the host. Others among them ap
peared to be wounded and these were lift
ed between their friends and conveyed
away as speedily as possible, while the
crowd hastily climbed up the hills out of
harm's way. :
Then It was that Lord Winstone, who
had not yet fired, took his Winchester,
calculated the range, as only a man with
his experience could do, and fired thrice
at the head of the retreating force.
They were now nearly half a mlfe dis
tant, and Winstone felt doubtful of a
workmanlike shot at that range; but for
tune favored him, and instantly upon the
treble report of the repeating rifle, a man,
viewed through a field glass by Fain,
threw up his arms, dropped his weapons
and fell amid his companions.'
"By God,' they don't know who's hit
'em," cried Tracy. "Ah! now they see the
smoke," he added, "and they're off like
hares. They've dropped their wounded,
too, the cowardly wretches! They evi
dently feel that as long as they're in sight
they're in range." /Â¦..-.
"I hope so," answered his Lordship.
"We must do nothing to disabuse them
of that opinion. Tho j shot waa good
enough to try, and now it has come off,
we'll reap the moral effect. They'll be
civil at any rate. To-morrow we'll burn
the villageâ only one. That, too, will
serve to teach them manners." m
A pleasant peace and freedom from anx
iety succeeded upon this incident, and
next morning, as good as his word, Win
stone advised the destruction of a village
which had been vacated as usual on tlia
approach of the expedition. ' ' Â¦-
Three prisoners were fortunately cap
tured here â an old, lame man and his two
wives. By these folks renewed messages'
of friendship were sent to. the people, and
' it was made clear that the strangers did
not come as slave raiders, -but as peace
ful hunters traveling for pleasure.
They desired nothing but peace and
plenty. They came witH gifts in their
hands and expected to be treated with
hospitality and friendliness; but if the
tribes wanted war, then war it should be,
and the thunder tubes w6uld flash by
night and by day until' there* was not an
other soldier or fighting man' left among
the people.
Lastly, Meldrum explained that if the
tribf a would stop in their villages ' he
would greet them as a brother and buy
what 'they could sell and be to them a
good friend; but that if they fled away
before him, as though he was a man of
war instead of a man of peace, he would
continue to fire their homes, ravage their
cultivation 0 and destroy the things that
were held precious to them.
Bessie was introduced to the decrepit
personage and endeavors made to con
vince him and his wives that she was a
white queen from afar, now traveling in
friendship with all queens, kings, mon
archs and chiefs whatsoever.
This, In part, they apprehended, and
when Bessie herself heaped gifts upon
them of a sort that, as Fain declared,
would probably get the poor souls
knocked on the head by the first stronger
savage who met them, their fear lessened
and they departed with evident delight to
dangle the toys b.efore their kinsfolk and
great men.
The value of this series of actions-be
came apparent two days later, when a
considerable encampment was reached
Just before dark. Instead of the usual
weird loneliness, as of a village of the
dead, bonfires blazed,, torches were passed
from hand to hand and the leaders of the
place headed' by their chief in person
came forward and greeted the travelers.
Their fear was evidently considerable,*
but efforts were successfully made to set
them at their ease and a few gifts, with
half a bale of cloth for the chief's worn
enklnd, speedily created a feeling of con
fidence and trust. This Meldrum and
Winstone did their utmost to ripen.
A feast was spread for the white folks,
and large stores of pouftry and grain laid
at '-their disposal. Food in considerable
quantities was also sent out to the camp
and many quarts of malwa were drained
that night by the thirsty Zanzibaris. In
deed, they became too jovial for safety
and a few broke bounds, but returned
penitent from the native village at dawn.
Upon the following day a great war
dance was celebrated in honor of the
travelers, and on the succeeding morning
they proceeded on their way once more,
having won the friendship of their former
enemies and received from the chiet a
passport, In the shape of a painted shell,
which he promised .them would prove
protection sufficient to the entire expedi
tipn until they, reached "the great track
between the waters." Beyond that ex
tended country unknown to him, and he
marveled at the courage of the white
wanderers, who could thus brave the per
ils of strange kingdoms and pass forward
and onward without fear bf death.
"It is the Thunder God," explained
Lord Winstone. "Without him we are
even as you are; but he wakes while we
sleep, his eyes are always open to guard
us from danger; he. knows who are
friends and who are .enemies. .He lifts up
his voice and spits forth . his words by .
night. and by day; and fcis voice is fire
and cloud, and his words are death." .
s "You say hÂ« never sleeps?"
"Never. ' We are mortal and must
sleep, for after toll and food our eyes
close, as yours do; but our Thunder Gods
are awake, and the light of the campflres
gleams in their watchful eyes; and they
whisper" together where we have placed
them. And If danger threaten from sav
age beast or men, our Thunder Gods laup
to our hands, and we awake and clasp
them and face the most terrible foe that
earth can bring against us without fear,
because we know man is powerless
against us." . â¢
The chief nodded.
"Be good to your Thupder Gods," he
said, "for I have known gods turn upon
and by a side shot at the lioness dropped
her dead within fifty yards of her lord.
In the distance the Zanzibari, finding him
self apparently unequal to shooting
straight, had rushed to the dead zebra,
clubbed bis weapon and brained the young
lions with successive blows. Now he ar
rived in hifch glee with a dead cub in
each hand.
At this moment a cry of araaiement at
tracted Lord Winitone's attention to the
dying lion, and he found Blackbird and
the carrier regarding the moribund brute
with unutterable horror. Cast up in froth
and blood' before it lay a human hand
with a silver ring: upon the middle finger;
and the dying lion had also disgorged a
lengthy scraD of scarlet cloth, torn from
the dead Arab's waist belt, and evidently
bolted with the rest of Its awful meal.
"Him cat Raalt!" gasped" Blackbird.
"By God, yes! and more, than Raalt!"
cried Winstone. "A knife â quick!"
His sharp eye had discovered a square
black object attached to the sanguinary
scrap of cloth.
"The Golden Fetich, by all that's hor
rible!" he cried. "The wretch fastened
it to his* loin cloth for safety, and from
there it went straight- into the lion's
belly. Providence â Providence is respon
sible for this! Now I also shall be forced
to maintain that the trinket has a value
at present hidden from us. Time will
show. But the skin of this lion I keep at
any cost."
The Golden Fetish proved to bÂ« quite
uninjured by its singular adventure, and
a couple of hours later, laden with the
big lion's skin and some zebra and lion
meat, which Is excellent fare, the party
returned ' to camp and feasted royally.
But it needs not be said that the lion of
the fetish formed no part of their re
past, for, as Blackbird declared:
"Him eat Raalt. an* if we eat him, we
get Raalt him wicked spirit In us."
"Exactly so," acquiesced his master.
"You stick to the cubs, for lion cub Is
Jolly good, eatingâ better than veal, in my
Judgment."
The' night .passed without sign of the
runaway Zanzibaris 'and when, early on
the following morning, Winstone's de
tachment fell in with that of Dan Hook,
it transpired that no sign of either Ab
dullah or Mabruki had rewarded them.
Together the parties turned their faces
backward to the Ruaha River, and. three
days later, reached camp without further
adveture. Good sport had waited on the
rifles of Winstone and his hunter, how
ever, and into camp were brought ra
tions of meat sufficient for four days.
The ammunition, unearthed by the way,
together with nearly all the stolen prop
erty, was also restored to its rightful
owners.
CHAPTER XVL
A DOSE OF THUNDER MEDICINE.
The expedition pushed steadily forward
up river, and three days after its Jour
ney renewed, a starved, ulcer-bitten
wretch struggled into camp and" flung
himself at the feet of Roy Meldrum. It
was the man Mabrukl, and, bidden to
speak, he quickly told the sequel of the
last chapter.
When Raalt was stricken down by the
lion, both Zanzibaris, -casting their goods
from them and even discarding their
rifles in their terror, fled for dear life
from the scene.
For two days they wandered helplessly
about, and on - one occasion were nearly
slain at the hands of a small body of na
tives armed with spears and bows who
fired upon them and wounded Abdullah
in the back; but from this peril they es
caped and at last, by absolute chance,
round themselves again at the spot where
Raalt met his death.
Then they discovered that a tall pile of
(tones evidently concealed the corpse of
Lhc- faithless Arab, that their guns and
poods had all vanished, and that the car
casses or rather clean-picked skeletons of
tMro lions lay close at hand.
Convinced of the truth, they carefully
followed the signs of the punitive party
backward to tho river.
On the third day Abdullah Sokp'to ha4
died of the arrow wound in his back, "but
Mabruki pushed forward, and, after ter
rible marches through the wood and
wastes succeeded in regaining the expe
dition.
"And now," he said, "I pray you shoot
me, if you will, but suffer me to die with
a full belly, that I may know what it is
to eat once more. I did wrong and I was
punished for it. I listened to the wicked
man and lived to see a terrible .death
overtake him. And Abdullah died very
thirsty and very hungry. But suffer me
to die full. Yet, do as you will and kill
me hungry as I am if you think I have
not been punished enough. . Mambu kwa
mvngu. Who can escape his appointed
crld?"
The man was fed and presently for
given; while it is interesting to note that
more than, once in after times Meldrum
bad cause for congratulation upon his len
iency; for Mabrukl speedily regained
health and strength, as did also the Kaf
fir boy, Bungani, and both lived* to dis
tinguish themselves favorably. For long
the latter was deprived- of the old privi
leges, but Bessie begged for* him many
Lrres, pointed out the nature of his temp
tation, . and itinhided Roy that the poor
little wretch lied been'forc.el to choose
between treachery and death.
"Besides." -thÂ» said,"" he tried to come
back to rne," Â£o Bungani found .himself
rciisiattd. and 'his dog-like fidelity to his
mistress was -never known : to waver
again. â¢
Within a" month the navigable limits
ot the Ruaha were reached, and, with
presents in proportion to their services.
King Unyah's warriors â¢ and boatmen
leparted, Meldrum's route now.extended'
through Urori couatry, well to "the south
east of Lake Leopold.
Nearly two months had passed since
the farewÂ«ll to Unyah; it was now
June, and the rainy season had ended;
whjle the'' Increasing heat of the hours
if day made it..-; desirable" to pursue
x path on. high.ground or over the foot
hills of rnountalns where possible. Tho
icxt Important point to ..iako for. upon
the Journey was' that track or .route
mown as 'the Stevenson road, between
.he great lakes Tanganyika and Nyassa.
[t was desired to hit this some distance
lbove the center t of Ntlnga, and- to do
charts showed that it would be neces
sary to keep northerly Â« round fhe Yo
tnalema Mountains, or take a 'direct
:ourse over ttiem. - *
The former plan was deemed the wiser,
md with about 200. miles between him
md the Stevenson road Meldru*m and his
band set forth through tho Urori country,
ind preserved a steady rate of progress
taring an uneventful month.
Various minor incidents matked each
lay, but the advance did not- suffer,
md some of the recent delay was amply
uoned for by a regular daily progress
jf four miles. For the most part, small
tribes occupied .the district but as a rule
they proved friendly enough, and very
Rilling: to barter the usual* plantains
ind goats for*, fair exchange in beaUs
ind trinklets. Some, however, did not
:rust tho travelers, but fled incontinent
ly at their approach. In these' cases'
the expedition helped itself, though
lah and Mabrukl in their frantic fligh't,
revealed no sign of the Golden Fetich,
and neither Raalt's shattered corpse noi
â¢ gory turban could furnish the curiosity.
It was true that one of his follower*
might be carrying the thins; but that ap
peared unlikely seeing lta portability, and
the hteh esteem in which it was held by
the Arab.
However, there was nothing more to
da but pile a heap of stones over . the
dead man. push on to the meeting; place
,wlth Dan Hook, and then return as quick
ly m possible to camp. The" rear guard,
â¢with Buneani. arrived Just as Winstone
was- preparing to continue hbi march, but
upon their appearance he changed his
mind and determined to camp about a
mile from the lair of the lion for the
night.
Then it was that several hours of Oay
llght being still available and evidences
of game appearing on every side. Win
stone and the negro set out. to shoot an
antelope or two if possible. They started
exactly an hour after the discovery of
Raalt's corpse, and an adventure, ever
afterward described by both hunters as
the most extraordinary within their ex
perience, almost immediately befell them.
The patch of Jungle extended westerly
for a considerable distance, and leaving
It at the spot where Raalt had been
destroyed, Winstone. Blackbird and>a. gun
bearer proceeded along its edge untlj a
sharp corner some 200 yards from the
starting point was reached. Round this
his Lordship peeped cautiously, then fell
flat on his stomarh and signaled to the
men behind him to do likewise.
What he had seen was a herd of zebra,
ten or a dozen In number. The wind was
from them, and ignorant of danger they
were trotting briekly alcng together. On
their present course they would pass
within fifty yards of the sportsman, and
Lord Winstone, quickly discarding a
heavier weapon, took his double-barreled*
express rifle and mode rjidy. But belore
the beasts reached him they came into
contact with anrther enemy.
Suddenly from the edge of the Jungle
grass, fifty yards ahead, a tawny streak
leaped out ar.d shot like an arrow into
the little herd. With ierrfble squeals the
brutes stampeded and fled with thunder
ing hoofs: but one was down, to rise no
more. and a tremendous ' male lion
crouched upon It. * . - .
For a few moments the beast kicked
frantically, then the lion struck him
twice with a 6ledge hammer paw ami
apparently broke his neck, for the zebra's
hind quarter* suddenly trembled, then it
ceas<d to kick, straightened out and grew
still. Thereupon the conqueror, in no
haste to feed himself, apparently, lifted
wp hln gory head and roared twice.
"Him full up himself an' him call his
missis and de pickaninnies," whispered
the hunter. "See! him eat nuffing, but
lave it all."
An answering roar soon echoed from,
the reeds, and a Tull-grown lioness with
two cubs, no larger than big cats, arrived
to rejoice In the banquet. The little cuba
set to work promptly licking blood, and
the mother selected the." inside of the ze
bra's thigh for her point of attack.
'"Him full already! Him no hungry at
all." declared Blackbird, pointing at the
lion.
"We must bag the pair If we can," an
swfred the leader. "That' a .a particular
ly fine male, from his nose to his tall-tip,
if I'm a judge."
Blackbird handed his master the four
bore once more', and Lord Winstone,
though within range, prepared to utilize
a squat shrub twenty feet nearer \ his
game, and crept forward on his stomach
until behind the bush.
The lioness had her haunches turned
toward him. and presented an uncertain
shot as she crouched at her food and tore
at the meat: the lion, who had evidently
satisfied his appetite elsewhere, ro.ied
over on his side at a little distance from
his family, curled up one giant paw like
a cat and began washing his muzzle and
cleansing it from the gore of the slaugh
tered zebra, .
In this position he offered a tolerably
easy shot, but Winstone, pushing forward
by inches, got so near before he took aim
that he could hear the contented brute
purring, with a harsh noise like a saw
cutting hard wood. He knew thatt he
would have to deal with both lions, and
desired, therefore, to make the dispatch
of the male an absolute certainty at the
first shot.
Suddenly a thin streak of flame leaped
forward from the distant edge of the jun
gle beyond Lord Winstone, and the crack
of a Winchester woke a dozen echoes
over the undulating country. His
Lordship had his own finger on trigger at
th'e moment, but did not fire until th.e re
sult of the first shot became apparent.
One of the party, contrary to orders, had
gone hunting on his own account, and
now, ignorant of the nature of the sport
and his own danger, had opened fire at a
range of 300 yards upon the lions.
An awful roar greeted the shot and
the lioness sprang a foot into the air
like a frightened cat. She had been struck
In the foot, but not Injured. The lion
rose instantly and ran to her, while she
held up her wounded paw and snarled
with agony and rage. Then the distant
sportsman fired again, but this time he.,
missed altogether, though only by a few '
Inches, and the bullet struck up the sand .
within a hand's breadth of the lion.
The great brute answered this attack
with another roar and faced around In
the direction of the discharge, but as he
did so, at the critical moment before he
leaped toward his enemy,' Lord Winstone
fired.
The Hon was hit heavily, but not killed.
It staggered forward, but recovered It
self, turned and approached the second
assailant. Lone before It reached him,
however, the great brute's 'powers "were
broken, its hind legs ceased to be of user,
and It struggled and scratched forward,
dragging its body toward the hunter .by
the *use of Jts front paws alone.
The lioness approached at the same .
time-, but by leaps' and bounds, and the
rnaddened brute was within ten yards of
them, when Blackbird and his master fired

DARING EXPERTS WHO WILL RACE HERE
California, and a prominent member of
the California Club of Los Angeles. He
Is the president .of two oil companies
and a director in a number of other
large institutions in this State. \ He is
also a large property holder and a prom
inent man socially in the southern end
of the State, and in coming to San Fran
cisco to race he is doing so as the rep
â¢resentative of the Automobile Club of
Southern California, which is to hold a
big racing meet In Los Angeles < on
November' 20th and 21st
Next to" Mr.Â° Garbutt the most proml-:
nent racing man on the Pacifl* Coast is
Mr. Walter Grothe. Mr. Grothe and Mr.
Garbutt have met in many races, and
"while the latter has so far succeeded in
"carrying off the honor's, Mr/ Grothe has
.Just arrived from the factory with a
1904 model touring car which he
Is having stripped, not alone of the ton
neau and one front seat, but has re
moved the entire body from the chassis
and is rigging a temporary seat and a
wind-splitting nose, the same as those
used by Mr. Garbutt.
Mr. Grothe's car, which Is supposed to
be some faster than Mr. Garbutt's, will
give him an excellent opportunity to
carry off the honors In the San Francisco
races.
Grothe's and Garbutt's cars
weigh about 1600 pounds each. They
are rated at ten horsepower by the mak
ers, and are expected, notwithstanding
the difference In horsepower, to give Mr.
Oldfleld an exciting race In the various
events in which the three will meet in
competition, .
Mr. George P. Whlttell of San Fran
cisco has a specially built forty horse
power racing machine, which cost
him. $12,000. Mr. Whlttell Is expected
.to divide the honors with Mr. Oldfield,
Mr. Garbutt and Mr\.Grotho In the races
at Ingelslde. He holds the record at
present for the fastest mile made on the
Pacific Coast This was made at Del
Monte, California, at the recent race
meet held there, the time being 1:16. He
Is having his car stripped of every
pound, of extra weight,* has had special
racing gears made for it and Is expected
to run at much faster time than his pre
.ylous records.
. Mr. Whlttell Is being watched very
closely by the local racing talent, as he
Is a young man of remarkable nerve and
skill In operating his machine, and he
would, not* surprise the knowing ones if
he carried off first honors m the coming
meet'for California amateurs.
In addition to the above there Is a
thirty - five horsepower car belonging
to Mr. Merrltt. a prominent man of.
Los Angeles, on which* the chauf
feur has been working for some time,
to get it in the very best condition for
the races at San Francisco and Los
Angeles. This car is, the same make
as the machine " that won the Gordon
Bennett cud in Ireland, and Is look
ed upon as the dangerous dark horse.
It is claimed to have run seventy miles
an hour on the straightaway, but what
It will be able to do on the track remains
to be seen.
Besides the foregoing. Mr. E. Courtney
Ford of thia city, will enter many of the
races against the big machines with a
new racer, which has Just arrived In
San Francisco. The machine la specially
geared and admirably constructed with
light framÂ« and wheels, so that its weight
is brought. down to. about .800, pounds. It
has a four-cylinder engino, and as Mr.
Ford is one ' of the most experienced j
Oldfleld. however, has taken up these
two machines and has done remarkable
jrerk C n the tract He has won every
fT^HE coming .automobile race meet on
j November 6 and 7 at the Ingleslde
j track will be the greatest event
j of Its kind ever held in the West.
Among the entries that are ex
pected to make very ft it time and
to distinguish themselves in the rac.ee
are Barney Oldfleld, the world's cham
pion track rider. The championship
was won by - him making a mile In
tS 4-6 eeconds on the first racing ma
chine he ever drove.- This machine was
a freak built by Oldfleld. ex-B!cycla
Champion Cooper and a mechanic by 'he
name of Ford, at Detroit, Mich. It bad
no eprings and no compensating gear on
the rear axle, no change ppeed gears, and
was steered with anÂ«er.ormous lever run
ning across the top of the steering bar,
where the wheel Is usually attached.
This machine 'was finally ruled off the
tracks In the J3aFt, after which Cooper
arranged for the use of his present ras
ing machine known as the "Baby Bullet,"
which Is a machine cf forty horsepower,
weighing ISOO'pounds, and the "Bullet No.
2." which Is claimed to have eighty horse
power and weighs about S000 pounds.
These were th<Â» two machines sent by
the Automobile Cljib of America to Ire
land to compete for the Gordon Bennett
cup.
They were epeclally built 'by Alexan
der Wlnton at enormous expense for this
particular event. The showing, however,
in the Irish race was not what was ex
pected of them, cwine to the difficulty
of keeping their large amount of machin
e.y in proper v.rklng order. Both Alex
ander Wlnton and Mr. Owen, who went
to Ireland to compete In that event, re
turned to America very much <Jlscour
â¢ ped at their lack of success.
race he has entered in the United States
with the exception' of one or two where
the machines were not working satisfac
torily, which was no fault of the cham
pirn. Oldneld is no doubt the most dar-
Irg track racer that ever drove an auto-'
mobile in any country. He makes .the
turns at better than a mile a minute
while comfortably smoking a cigar, an-1
if anybody gets in his way he takes his
mind off the machine long enough to ex
press his feelings in language as forcible
as the EDeed he attains.
In one rec*nt event he is reported as
slackening down, the machine with the
Idea of thrashing the man who Interfered
with -what he conslderoi his righ: of way
on the track. It occurred to hl.n, hov
evÂ«r, that it would be better to" put off
this proceeding until after the race, eo he
let out the big machine, drove like t. mad
man, and after winning was talked out
of thrashing his competitor.
In addition to Oldfleld. it Is expected
that there will be a number of other spe
cial Eastern racing men, and that he will
have to do his best work If he wins
against some of the Pacific Cotst ama
teurs.
Frank A. Garbutt of Los Angeles is
the â¢ amateur champion, having never
been defeated. He has made far and
away the best' record of any amateur in
the world in track racing. He will not
race for money as does Oldfleld, but In
competing for money with Oldfleld, if he
should beat him he would take trophies
instead of the cash prizes offered. Mr.
Garbutt drives his touring car In
all his races and has made his records
heretofore by stripping his machine of
its tonneau, which means the two rear
seats, and one of 'the front seats, and
equipping it with a wind splitting nose
to reduce the resistance at high speed.
He is chairman of the racing commit
tee of the Automobile Club of Southern

was arranged that the defendant should
surrender himself Into the custody of the
Constable and be brought over to the
Supreme Court, but unfortunately, the
prisoner and Constable could not find
each other. The prisoner came "over on
an early boat, and went to the Supreme
Court to find the Constable, bo .that he
might be brought Into court In proper
shape. He admitted to the clerk of the
court that he was the prisoner and was
looking .for the Constable to take him Into
custody. Thereupon our seven judge*
filed solemnly into court. We most re
spectfully arose and saluted them, and
our venerable Chief Justice announced
that the purpose of a writ of habeas
corpus was to release a prisoner, but as
the defendant In the case seeme* to be
at large there was no prisoner to release,
and dismissed the writ. >" -
So we filed out of court and talked to
the prisoner afterward. I told him dis
tinctly and positively that 5f he were
again arrested and the Auto Club under
took to defend him, he must be brought
into court In chains. Since then we
have left the Marin â¢ County ordinance
alone. In fact, we do not think much of
Marin County, anyhow. It may do for
some people who are satisfied with an
cient methods of locomotion, but for au
tomobilists the hills are too steep and
the level roads too few. All we ask is
The Supreme Court granted a hearing
on the writ, and on the morning set, It
As to county ordinances, I am pleased
to eay that they have not so far been op
pressive, except in the county of Marin,
which has an ordinance that practically
excludes automobiles. The first ordinance
that thev passed required every automo
bile to be brought to a full stop. within
300 feet of any person riding, driving or
leading a horse or other domestic animal.
One- of our members was arrested for
violating this provision. His case was
taken before the Superior* Court on a writ
of habeas corpus and the club took up
the matter. Our attorney suggested to the
court that -it would be slow work for an
automobile to go past a funeral proces
sion, and that he must stop if he should
meet a little crlrl leading a pet lamb on
the road, but the learned Judge conclud
ed that the ordinance was reasonable and
proper, nevertheless. So we then carried
the rase to the Supreme Court of the
State. Meanwhile our prisoner was let
free on hall.

six months before an order can be filled
he does not know how he will, feel at the
end of that period, and so does not order
at all. When the manufacturers get so far
ahead of orders that they can place ma
chines here on sale there will be many
more sales.
When automobiles were first Introduced
It was considered wonderful that they
should go at all. Now we expect them not
only to go. but to go with ease, quietude
and certainty. Many more machines would

that up to This time the perfect automo
bile has not 'been "Invented. I am happy
to .say, however, that I have a unanimous
opinion from the dealers in San Francisco
that the ultimate and perfect conception
of an automobile has at last appeared and.
will Bhortfy be offered to the public. Each
dealer has the only genuine article, all
others being a fraud upon the public.
The main difficulties in the way of auto
mobiling aÂ« a sport in California and else
where has been that they have heretofore
been In such an experimental state that
those who Invested early became disgust
ed with their troubles, and otherB were
timid about purchasing. However, there
have been wonderful Improvements in the
last few yea:s. Manufacturers are learn
ing th.eir mistakes. They are lessening
the weleht, increasing the power and effi
ciency and automob'.ling Is becoming truly
a sport Instead of haref labor.

of self-respectlnr and law-abiding" auto
moblllstsk I could name almost with cer
tainty the Individual or Individuals who
have been the cause of every restrictive
ordinance around the Bay of Baa Fran
cisco.
Our chief pleasure ground. In San Fran
cisco Is the Golden Gate Park, and we
are excluded from the greater part there
of. I have pleaded with the Park Com
missioners for a year, for greater privi
leges, but I ret the same answer:
"80mÂ© of your people are making us
trouble by total disregard of our park
ordinance."
I said to one Commissioner:
"Why don't you arrest them?"
Then he would change his tactics, and
â¢instead of running away, he would balk
â¢T.d refuse to move a step, In- which he
displayed almost human intelligence, for
it always occurred far from settlement.
There Is hardly a town around the bay
where I have not arrived In a procession
led by a mule or an old white horse, next
a peddler's wagon or some old sulky sim
ply as an object to which to attach a tow
line, and next myself steering the demon,
the entire outfit, surrounded by all the,
idle boys In town, marching* to the
rhythm of jeers and cat calls.
My last experience and that which dis
gusted me most was a trip which I made
from the outskirts of Oakland down Tele
graph avenue, led by an ancient pair of
Bkates and fifth wagon, which was the
only thing that I could secure for towing.
I learned then how popular- 1 was. I never
knew that I had so many acquaintances.
They came from the highways and by
ways. They suddenly appeared on the
porches of the various residences and the
worst is that they all knew me by name.
I was sorry then that I had ever been in
veigled Into becomiog the president of
an automobile club. I looked neither right
nor left, but when I got In safely upder
shelter I told the owner of the shop that
he might have ray automobile and he has
It yet. To be sure, he has never run it, but

frame.
There Is nothing to compare with the

cf an automobile. I always tried to look
humble when I met my friends, but I as
eumed no disguises when I passed my
enemies. ThÂ»>y could plainly see my con
tempt for the common people who still
tfrove horses. However, the latter had
their revenge when, in a few months, my
obedient beatt and eervant took matters
into his own hands and became the mas
ter, and I the most humble servant. The
trouble was, I never knew what my new
tuaster intended doing. I tried my best to
keep peace with him; I was careful not to
overtax his strength; I gave him food ami
water frequently end had him well
rroomed at night I tried In every way
to treat him as an equal, but he devel
oped a most alarming and vicious dispo
sition, which at times became positively
dangerous. He would run me down hills

one's essay o*Â» snakes in Ireland, which
read. "There are no snakes in Ireland."

usage that it Is reasonable to Â«uppoae :

"But, granting that It is correct to call;
him a chauffeur, it ought to be logical'
that there ehould be one way of spelling
the term. In reality raere are many vari
ants. The word is epelled like Sam Wel
lcr'B name, 'according "to the taste of the.
epeilcr.' Thus we have 'chaffeur,' 'chau
fer* and 'chafeur,* none of which* are
. eorrf-ct. but all of which have occurred
in what would otherwise be above criti
cism as automobile literature.

at least he would resent being called one. â¢
Is he a companion? Sometimes a demo
cratic, whole-hearted automobile owner
will accr-pt h!m as such, but more gen-,
eraily he draws a social line, which is

"Of course, a great deal depends on
the kind of man who engages himself as

these things Incline one to the belief

very difficult for even an experienced

dressmaker in the female menage. But

The future of the* chauffeur as a class
Is an unknown, quantity. 0 It Is probable
that the tendency will be to fix his re- .
xnuneratlon at a pulnt which will tend to '
fix hjs social status. At present It de
pands altogether upon the financial
stafffllng o/ the employer what the cha'uf- .
f eur. gets for bis .services. In the future .
it is likely that the money question will
biÂ» a fixed quantity, or at least dependent -
only on the ability of the man. O'f pourse,
experience, knowledge of mechanical de
tail and general handjness will -continue
to demand a considerable* figure. But
probably not nearly as much difference
will be noticed between the hleh grade
chauffeur of the future and the ordinary
one, as Is the case to-day. : \
'The status of the chauffeur is further
complicated at presetft by the place
which he occupies in fiction and on _the
stage. Nine-tenths of the fiction wh*lch
has been written on automoblllng throws
a romantic glamour about the person of a
chauffeur. He is. either a lord in dis
guise or a gentleman athelete under a
cloud, or something of that sort, *nd the
always beautiful youitg lady whom he
drives invariably falls in love" with him.

limited stale can be traced back to the
year 1890, and even a great deal further
back for the Initial advent of the first
automobile, the general manufacture of
motor vehicles began to claim the atten
tion of the public most notably In the
year 1S96 or thereabout. Â¦
Since that time, with but a few thriv-
Ing factories existing, the Industry has
yearly progressed at a remarkable pace
until now hundreds of plants engaged In
the building of automobiles are flourish
lnÂ»" throughout the entire country, and
distinct powers employed generally for
the propulsion of automobiles, via: Elee
tricky, steam and gasoline. The first
power is electric energy stored In a stor
age battery carried in vehicle, while the
second and third are respectively steam
generated In small boiler in machine with
gasoline used as fuel and power secured
fr Â°m the explosion of gases In firing
chambers of a hydrocarbon or gasoline
engine.

â¢ Then, as people began to learn more
â¢.bout the automobile and saw its-practj-
cablllty for long runs through the coun-
try, a keen demand sprang up foT a
larger and more capable vehicle, oonse-
fluently the manufacturers endeavored to
create something that would fill : this
want. and. as a result, a two seated ma-
chine of the surrey type was offered. It
was soon found, however, that this type .
was not built strong enough to carry the
motive power necessary to .drive a ma-
chine of this kind on- indifferent roads for
long distances, and that, it was'lacking in
cbmfortf and as a result, the tonneau-
type with heavy power aa now in vogue
soon followed.

ADVU&TISEimSTS^The time may come in the life of every child when not only the happi
ness but even the life of the child may depend upon implicit obedience.
Nearly every one can recall instances when such has been the case. Few
there are who do not know of many cases where a child would have been
saved much pain had he learned to obey.
If it be granted that obedience must be secured, the question will arise
as to or not it should be obtained through fear. This is the l&west form of
obedience. It is the least desirable. In some cases, however, as with young
children, this may be the only kind which a parent is able to secure. It
is the only kind of obedience which appeals to many people at any time.
The fear of punishment is the only deterrent which prevents many from
breaking the laws of God and man. However, no parent should be satisfied
to 6top with that obedience which is the result of fear of the consequences
of disobedience. If it is not replaced by a higher form of obedience there is
likely to remain in the child's heart a latent feeling of hostility, which may
some time break forth and burn and blast the brightest hopes of the fond
parent
Perhaps the easiest way to train young children to habits of obedience
is by the use of some certain punishment This need r.ot be corporal punish
ment.
It is only necessary that the child should understand that improper acts
will certainly be followed by some unpleasantness or disadvantage.
Much can also be accomplished by a proper use of rewards. This ia a
more difficult plan than the last mentioned. It requires more skill, better
knowledge and greater delicacy of perception and discrimination. *
Even better results will be secured by the careful use of such higher
incentives as will appeal to the child.
Great care must be taken lest obedierjee appear to be bought Thli Is
the great danger in the use of any system of rewards. Where a child ia
rewarded systematically he is not only apt to expect it, but is apt to de
mand the promise of the reward before he is ready to give willing com
pliance with directions. From this there is likely to result a system of brib
ing, which is one of the -surest ways to ruin the best of children. f
Even though it may be necessary to start with obedience through fear
or other low incentives, the effort should be made to pass from these to
obedience to circumstances. The child should soon learn that it is not
merely arbitrary authority to which he is compelled to give compliance. As
soon as he is able to comprehend it he should be shown that, not only
from him, but from every person, circumstances demand obedience. When
a child understands that even the parents must be obedient to circum
stances over which they have no control, . every vestige of antagonism ' will
s j=Â£^rf=j S the child grows older he will discover that his success and
kr$M?$# both at home and in school, depend upon
Pw/WBravl T>Tom^ t obedience. As he grows to manhood he will learn
|f^/Â£jraÂ»| tÂ»t he cannot live peacefully unless he is willing to yield
*r/'S^Wdh Â° bcdience ' not onJ y to the authority in the family, but to
at thC sch Â° o1 ar ' d the community as well. One of the
Uaa^aHsrass^a greatest of all parental responsibilities, then, is that of fix
ing in every child the habit of unquestioning obedience to
proper authority.
generally disappear. The less arbitrary a parent U with all saw Am
youngest children, the greater real power the parent will hzrt ovtr then?
One of thevery highest forms of obedlenca is that which Is inni^Tb
love of the parent However before a child can be reached br sndhThl^
incentive he. .must have reached quite a moral pUne. A very voeni ehS3
cannot reasonably be expected to have reached such a plan*. Thai oarent U
most successful who gets the child to so lov* and trust him thai
,him is sufficient inducement to lead the child to givt cheerfal and iSd!
obedience, not only to commands, but also to the Implied wiaa of tSToareSt

the loving parent will probably W. "Do this now; I wfll te rj you Vh?
later." Sometimes, with, an older child. It may be well to explain the main
reason for requiring certain things. The child will soon learn that it b the
parents' love which prompts such consideration.
Obedience through a sense of duty is tha highest form of obedlencai
Not until a child has reached a very high moral plane is It reasonable to ex
pect that he will be at all influenced by his sense of what Is right Too
many parents fail to realize the truth of this statement They therefore ex
pect too much of their children. While they should aim to so train their
children that they will be largelv Influenced bv a sense of love and duty,
they should not fail to remember that this is asking a great deal of any
one, and especially of a child. Comparatively few adults ever reach, and
still less permanently retain, such an exalted position. However, it is toward
such a plane that we should direct oar children. Better than this, if we can
occupy the citadel we may beckon to them and urge them to come up and
occupy It with us. Surely the parent whose children are ready to give
prompt, cheerful obedience because of love for parents or regard for what
u right must be considered most fortunate.
Much has been said by others of the necessity of training a child to obey
all who are' older than himself. Is this best? Will it not produce a slav
ish feeling which will greatly injtwt the child's character? Let it be agreed
that every child should give respectful consideration to his elders, because of
their age and experience. Let all acknowledge that no child should fail
to show must respectful reverence toward his grandparents and his other
relatives.- However, in spite of this, it would seem best that the child should
not feel the absolute necessity of giving â¢ implicit obedience to any save
his parents or to those acting in their stead.
While, with young children, the fear of punishment and the desin for
reward must be used to secure obedience, they should be replaced by
higher Incentives as soon as it is possible to do so. By the time the child
has reached the age of six or seven it may be explained that obedience is

lower animals arrive at maturity in a short time, and because of instinct
they are able to take care of themselves quite early in life. It is not so with
children. To them God has given but little instinct -In place of instinct he
hasÂ»given them a wonderful power of improvement. In a few days tha
â¢young bird is able to leave the nest, and no longer requires the care of* the
parent bird. Not so with the child. Years of patience, kindness and care are
spent in supplying the wants of children. Many nights of terrible anguish
'are spent .by many in watching over a child" before it is safe to trust it to
go out to fight life's battles such explanations, and by such other
means." the child may be taugM that the experience and wisdom of the'pareni

To these' causes of doubt and more potent than all must be added the

These questions are particularly pertinent'at this -season of the year
when so many are starting: out in new occup^tioirs-^'anclAwhen upon
the city streets are others looking .for something. to "dci;"^Sj2^*f|fi9^i
question "is: Are they looking for a position of arc they looking for'
a work? \
Upon the face of it most of us would prefer a position. It sounds
â¢o much more erenteel. It suggests an office somewhat removed from
grimy benches or nqisv machinery. To be able^to say, "John got a
position in New York or Chicago, or in some good concern here at
home/' gives a pleasant sense of relief from all responsibility for
John, at least for a time. But" I would rather have it said of a son of
mine. "He's .found his w.ork in God's world," than to have it said,
"He's got a. position. . ' .
The difference is rfarht here. In .the case of a position one usually
builds upon another's" foundations. Somebody has worked and plan
"ned and forecasted thÂ£ future and had the courage of initiative, and
you simply enter into *his # labors. From this point of view, at least,
captains of industry, the men who make work for others, belong
among the greatest benefactors of modern society. When to-day a
man gets a job or a position it usually, means that, had not somebody
else gone ahead and blazed, the way in' the* industrial or professional
world, he himself would probably stand with idle" hands in the market
place lamenting. "No man hath hired me." On the other hand he who
sees before* him a definite work, -a* new line of investigation, an inven
tion to perfect and patent, a worthy crusade to lead, a wilderness to be
made to blossom as the rose, waste places in human life to be re
deemedâmen with tasks oo their hands like these find life most rest
ful and rewarding. They are the Â» Governor Tafts and the Booker
Washington* and the Lord Curzons.
But what of the people who work all day long with spindle .or
spade? Have they also a work to do? Assuredly, every man of us,
whether he wear broadcloth or overalls, is bound to leave the world
better than he found it That is what he was sent Into It for â not to
heap up gold, not tret a soft position, not simply to earn waarcs^but to
instill purity, courage; 'gentleness Into his fellows. In the spirit of that

â¢rate aim they had secured on thÂ« lost tar

irrevocably spoiled.
"What do you think, sir?" asked Cap
tain Haines, looking up at Captain BÂ«n
nett
"Get your" quadrant deflection at thÂ«
auxiliary target and we'll try a shot and
see how far our aim Is wrong," was thÂ«
answer.
The next process in this mimic game of
war was the most Interesting and excit
ing demonstration of the perfection that
has been attained in modern ordnance.
The Quadrant was brought and adjusted
to the breech of the gun as It stood point
ed toward the original target hidden in
the fog four miles away, and the angla of
the sight pointed toward the haystack not
more than two miles from the gun and
fully a mile to the right. Thus by keep
ing the quadrant at the same tangent all
through the* firing, while the sight was
pointed at the haystack, the cannon it
self would remain accurately aimed at the
line of kneeling Infantry dummies that
had been swallowed up In the haze, and
the next move In the game was to bom
bard the "enemy" with the whole battery
aimed from the* same quadrant without
being able to see more than half the dis
tance toward the "enemy" itself.
"Got the quadrant deflection, sir." an
nounced the corporal of gun No. 1 in an
incredibly short space of time.
"Got the deflection, sir." repeated Cap
tain Haincs to Captain Bennett.
Turning to the "wigwag" men whÂ» with
their field glasses and signal fix* had
taken up their position on top of a hay
stack a hundred feet or so to the right
of the firing line, Captain Bennett Issued
the order.
"Call up the first battery and tell them
to omit the gun pit and proceed to the
next event. Men at the target Join the
range pary at once. 6olng to shoot at
the ballistlo figure."
The order was duly "wigwagged" to
the nearest members of First Battery,
acting as the range party, who had ad
vanced into the for just to pick up this
very order and transmit it at once to the
main body. two miles farther on in U*Â«
lee of the dummy Infantry.
*. For a few minutes it looked as If the
fog would prevent even this absolutely
necessary feature- of the maneuvers to
be carried back, but presently Captala

"Gun No. 1 ""quadrant eleyatlon three .
- degrees .two minutes, with percussion
'shrapnel,* time .fuse 19 seconds. Load!"
shouted Captain Haines. Like an echo
Lieutenant Brtpe repeated. the command.
: Again there was a scuffle of feet and a
rush to the caisson in t.he rear, and in a
moment 'two. men were back at' the. gun
again. with what looked like a small bag
full of musty 'macaroni, but which in
reality Is the deadly new smokeless pow
' der, and .a shell, which is Uke unto noth
ing ever used in. battle in the olden days.
"â¢ Just think of having a" shell Cred at you
with the time accurately punched on.it to
explode in your very face, whether you
were one or three or flve xnllee away. And
yet that is exactly what" these new per
cussion shrapnel really. do. . .
In outward appearance it u Just JiiÂ«
any other cigar-shaped sheU, but its su
perior deadllness is shown in a circular
line of little holes around the sharp point
like the thread on a screw. It is here that
one of the gunners, whose special work 1*
is to do that and nothlns; else, punches
' the time called for by the captain of the
battery for all the world like a. streetcar
. conductor punching the time on a trans
fer. And if the. fuse is in rood condition
the shrapnel, true to the punch mark, ex
plodes at five or six or eight or ten seo
onds or whatever the allotted time may
be and scatters the hundreds of small shot
compactly packed within its steel sheel
and creates fearful death and destruc
tionâthat is, if the riddled canv*a of the
thin line of kneelinr infantry after the
"battle" was any indication of the slaurh

dummies had been truly flesh and blood

Captain Bennett as he caugljtthe flatter

. â¢ "Minus, 30. impact!" called out the wir
war man on top of the haystack, which,
. interpreted, means that the shell ex
.ploded thirty yards in front of the tarret.
"Minus 80 impact I" called out Captain
â¢â¢"Bennett, passing the word on to .Captain
. Haines. "Deflect a little to the left,, cap- j

Merely ret the range." .
"All right, sir. No. 3, quadrant eleva

Â¦ ordered Captain Haines and repeated
. warnlngly, "careful, now, don't move that

.And again the process of almost instan
taneous loading .was rone through with
and again s punch marked shell -went rip
ping through the air in .deadly impact
against a target which none of the men
who were shooting at it could tee by a
good two miles.
"Gad! I'm afraid we've hit it," saTd
Captain Beanett. rerretfully, while the
whistles of the shell still filled the air
and stung the er.rs, and then even before
the wigwag signals telling of the damacÂ»
done were received he ordered:
"Take a little more deflection."
The news that came back throurh the
for verified his worst fears. The tarret
had not only been riddled but it had been
utterly demolished. That Is marvelous
shooting, but it was not what the cap
tain wanted. With calm confidence after
the first shot had demonstrated how ac
curately they had gauged their range in
their first and only peep at the target
through the rift in the scudding fog, he
desired only that the runners grata
it just to show what splendid marksmen
they were, for or no for. And now the
second shot had unceremoniously ended
the first event of the day, unless they
ceased firing long enough to allow the
range party to erect a new target. This
Captain Bennett decided not to do.
"Wigwag to go on with the second
event," he ordered, which meant that the
guns would simply be trained a little to
the left to bear upon a line of dummy
cavalry instead of the kneelinr infantry.
And in. the fog whicn, though it had
begun to raise somewhat, still hung close
to the ground, this could only be arrived
at by fine mathematics, since it waa
known absolutely what distance separ
ated the two classes of targets.
But even as the range was secured In
this manner the fog rose and the runners
were given a continuous. If very dim,
view of the objects they were to shoot at,
and in a few minutes the firing became
general from one end of the battery to
the other.
"Don't aim to hit the targets," cau
tioned Captain Bennett, as the first shell
burst dangerously close to what 'would
have been a line of horsemen riding in
single file In real life. "I merely want
to test the accuracy and deflection of the
shells them^'Wes." and. then turning to
the writer, he added: "The ammunition
â¢ Is old and defective and this practice Is
designed particularly to find out Just
what proportion la available," and then,
with eyes glued on the far distant dum
my cavalry, he cried out. "Time your fuse
a little finer. That last shell burst too
low. It is supposed to explode thirty feet
In the air In order to scatter at the wid
est angle." and finally, when the next
shot screeched on Its way and burst with
a deafening report, "Ah: that shot was
perfect."
The photograph on this p^ge shows
Â¦3 what happened to the targets to arouse
the captain's enthusiasm. The firing waa
â¢ a huge soccess and set a new standard
of marksmanship for American gunners.

7If you have the wood and intend pencil
ing the design 'yourself, the first thing to
decide is whether you want the pattern '
to show dark against the background, or
Instead to darken the ground, in order
to have the flowers or figures stand out in
light tones, upon it In a way this Is of
come importance, for if you fancy. the lat
ter course the stalks or branches/in case
it Is a flower pattern, must" be drawn in
double outline, so that each line become*
part! of th* ground when you. fill 1 it -la;
otherwise all the stalk will be merged la
the background.
In all instances light upon dark Is the
most effective method, although If you
are but a beginner you will find- It muca
more difficult, for greater care is re-
Qulred to shade the Cowers, as you can't
cover mistakes by touching it up a bit
here and there, and a dot or unsightly

There is but one thing to remember in
selecting the ground and that Is to keep
it subservient, to the main design and not
chosen so as;' to -give a broken up appear
ance to the whole, or to worry the eyt- in
Iookjng at it. If the pattern runs in a
decided direction it is far better to
"scrub" In a relief, for it can scarcely be
called one thing or another, ' ti. i
Take the broad side of the "point" and
move rapidly from left to right, literally
"scrub along, and the result will be a light
and dark effect, particularly desirable for
fully two-thirds of poker work.
" Another excellent ground which obtains
an even tone over the entire surface is,
lines burned at sharp angles to each
other. Instead of working up and down
or left and right all the Urn* each set
of four or five lines are blended, one into
another, but so evenly in tone that they
merge, into a smooth, dark ground.

This waist was madp in a very pale,
e.hade of fese, and Its mat'erjal was a very
soft silk resembling. -liberty. It was cuV
with ashirred yoke, while across the bust
there was draped a little tichii of pretty '
lace. This was caught on ej'ther shoulder
with a largfe pink shell button, and again
upon the watat unti.l \\ festooned the
front of, the waist in little loops of lace." â¢
The 'sleeves y/ere very Jarge below ther'
elbow, but, instead of. dropping,' they were ''
iitiffened so as to set out amartly. At the
wrist, or a little above It, the Bleeve3
were cut off short and Into the sleeve
there was set a fall of, lace which waa
Considerably deeper" at the back of '.the
hand than on top. A big pink shell button
was on top of the wrist. *
The tendency the evening waist is to
<3o away with the sh'irt walBt 'effect and
to make the waist more on the order *of
the bodice. This is easily accomplished '
by fitting the .waist closely anq* by making
the sides as enug as the back. The front
can sag Â«ver so little over the belt, but it
must not by any means bag, for only a
very little fullness is allowed.

WINTER'S DRAWING
ROOM GOWNSTOE SUNDAY OALTj,
In this city and State. The Jesuits re
turned to California In 1852 and the follow
ing year opene*d Santa Clara College.
Later they built St. Ignatius Church and
College In this city, where the Parrott
building now stands. The Slater* of Char
ity, whoee mother house", Is at Emmets
burg, Md.". had, arrived' (four Bisters under
Mother Frances) in 1851 and* opened an
orphan asylum. The Sisters of Mercy, the
Sisters of Notre Dame, the Dominican*
Sisters aAd. the Presentation Nuns all 'es
tablished themselves here about this *time
and opened hospitals and schools for girls.
A college, for boys had also' been or
ganized under the charge of the clergy.
But in 1857 the Christian Brothers were
asked to take charge of the work, which
they did, and subsequently moved the in
stitution to Oakland, where they erected
the splendid building now known as St.
Mary's College, besides establishing the
Sacred Heart College on Eddy street, in
this city. Later the Franciscan Sisters,
the Bisters of the Holy Name, Mesdames
of the Sacred Heart and finally, quite re
cently, (he|LlttIe Sisters of the Poor all
began their special work here.
This city and archdiocese haa the dis
tinction of being the original home of the
Sisters of the Holy Family, founded by
Vicar General Prendergast, who made a
specialty of conducting kindergartens,
where little children are taught and where
working mothers can bring their children
while they- go out to earn their dally
bread. The sister* also conduct a number
of Sunday-schools and do an Immense
amount, of charitable and educational
work.
. The Toung Men's Institute is flso of
California orlglni It is designed for the
laity, for the purpose of interesting tl-ira
In church work and making them auzl i
rles. to the clergy. There Is also . the
League of the Cross,* a total abstinence
organization, which is doing a great work
In helping the younger generation to bo
both good patriot* and good Christians.
The change" of, the political control of
the country from Mexico to the United
States, and the discovery of gold, caused
a great Increase of population, many of
whom were Catholics, and many others
who afterward joined the church; and
every year of Archbishop Alemany's rule
saw new churches erected, new schools
and institution* opened and a greater and
greater extension of the church work. In
1868 the Catholio population of the Arch
diocese had outgrown the * possibility : of
one man properly managing It, and a new
diocese was created, including Northern
and Eastern California with Nevada and
Utah, Rev. O. V. O'Connel), an Irish
priest, was appointed to the new see with
Marysvllle as his residence. Subsequently
the episcopal residence was moved, tor
Grass Valley and then to Sacramento,
and later Eastern Nevada and Utah were
cut off and made Into the new diocaso of
Salt Lake.. Bishop O'Conngll, who .was
not 'a young man at the time of his ap
pointment, resigned and was succeeded
by Bjshop Monfcgue, who, dying at Sac
ramento In 189a, was macceeded by Bishop â¢
Grace, now in charge of that dioceae.
Mention has been made of the advent
of the Sisters of Charity, who opened an
orphan asylum on the present site of the
.Palace Hotel, but it* will be interesting'
to recall that their school, opened In 1852,
â¢at the. same locality, was the first Catho
lic school in the city. Subsequently
Notre Dame College for Girls was opened
at San Jose, and now there ore over
forty girls' schools in tho present limits
of the Archdiocese alone.
In 1S53, notwithstanding the division of
the diocese, the work became sc heavy
that Archbishop Alemany asked the Pope,
Leo XIII, to give him a coadjutor, or as
sistant and. In compliance with that re
quest, Father P. J- Rlordan, pastor.of one
of the largest parishes in Chicago, was
selected for the honor and labor, and
having been consecrated, he came to this
city and assumed the â¢ arduous duties of
the .position. One year later Archbishop
Alemany resigned his charge and retired
to his native la*hd, Spain, where be spent
the remaining years of hi* life In the
quiet and repose of a Dominican Mo
nastery, of which order, as already stated,
he was a 'member. He Is buried in his
native town o,f Vlch, and a beautiful mar
ble monument has been erected by Arch
bishop Rlordan over his grave.
Wlfen the present Archbishop assumed
control of th* archdiocese the Catholic
population ' was about 125,000. It had
churches and schools but It needed many
more, and above all' the surroundings of
the cathedral had become such that the
removal of the chief church of the arch
diocese to a more eligible locality -was
imperative, and he very shortly after
ward began the construction ef th* splen
did edifice en the corner of Van Ness ave
nue and O*Farrell street, the cornerstone
of which wss laid in 1887.
The cathedral completed, the* most
pressing need was for a seminary
where the young priests could be edu
cated, obviating the necessity â¢ and ex
pense of sending thejn to distant parts of
the United States to receive their ecclesi
astical education. He accordingly erect
ed, the fine seminary at Menlo Park and
put It In charge of tbe Sulpiclan Fathers,
who make a specialty of educating . can
didate* for the priesthood. It would take
more space than The Call can afford to go
lnto'detaHs concernlsg all that has been
done for the cause of religion and the ex
tension of the church, under Archbishop
Giordan. The evidences of hU work are
on all sides. Every institution shows
progress aÂ»d improvement. Bplsndld nÂ«w
buildings have been erected at the Boys'
.Orphan Asylum near San Rafael. New
â¢ churches have- gone up, not only In vari
. oua p^rtn of the city, but In all parts of
> the archdiocese. The Little plater* ef th*
Poor have come to take 'care of the aged
and a splendid building for their use, the
gift of a generous Catholic-, Is 'now being
erected in the western part of th* city.
The Faulist Fathers 'have been fnvlted.to
.take charge "of old St.. Mary's and do
missionary work over the State. The M*a
rlst Fathers minister to the wants of the
many French Catholics, the . Franciscans
conduct two churches for the Germans
(one a magnificent building with monas
tery and school adjoining) and the Bale
elan Fathers one for the Italians, while
a new church for the Slavonians, under
the care of the Jesuits, Is being erected.
Mendoclno County, which has suffered
for the want of priests, .has been put un
der the care of Capuclans. the pioneer* of
which order have lost arrived in the
State.
Besides the orders already named there
are the Brothers of Mai*y and Sisters of
St. Joseph, and the Ursuline Sisters en~
â¢gaged .-In charitable and educational
work. Almost all the churches are large
and substantial edifices built of brick
and stone, and even In the country dis
tricts. In small towns like San Mateo,
Tomalea and Point Richmond, the
churches are handsome edifices, artisti
cally decorated both Inside and out. and
a credit in every way to those responsi
ble for their erection. .All the work of
planning, directing and advising In an
archdiocese as large as this, however,
cannot but consume a good, deal of any
man's vitality, and last year Bishop
Rlordan asked for a coadjutor In his
â¢turn, and Bishop George Montgomery of
Los Angeles, who had formerly been a
priest In this city, where he Is beloved
and admired by Protestants and Catholic*
alike, was with the approval of the clergy
and laity alike selected for the honor,

will ho doubt go on with ever Increasing

But a few statistic*,, dry though figure*
usually are, will, give the best idea of the
progress that has been made since Bishop
Alemany became Archbishop. The onÂ»
diocese of Monterey has expanded into
three dioceses and one archdiocese; the
fifteen to twenty thousand Catholics to
850.000. of whom nearly 250.000 are In this
archdiocese alone. The little school started
by the jSsten of Charity Â¦*Â» Cx* *f*a2aos>

colleges and academies and sixty-three
parochial schools, .with over ttJXÂ» pupils.
The humble orphan asylum of the Sister*
of Charity Is now replaced by fifteen asy
lums for boys, girls or Infanta There is
a protectorate with â¢ a large farm for
wayward boys, a Magdalen home for on
fbrtunate girls; there axe eight hospitals,
foulr homes for the aged, three schools
for the Indians, a deaf mute school, three
seminaries ' for.'prlests (two conducted by
religious orders). In this archdiocese
alone there are- 143 churches and chapels,
besides a number of stations, attended by
t70 .priests, but In the territory covered
by 'the old Monterey diocese, for which,
the other statistics afe given, th,ere are
tU priests, three Bishops and two Arch
bishops, with 125 churches and coapels
besides stations where servtoes are held
occasionally. 'It Is truly a wonderful
record and one that should make -the
Catholics of California feel proud as they
celebrate the Golden . Jubilee of thel*
archdiocese t M Â» Sunday morning.
â¢â¢That tour conditions seems to me to bÂ«
exactly the sajne." said the Archbishop.
"Are you a Bishop?" asked his com',
panlon,. in surprise. â¢ tpâ Â«.
"Yes. I am the Archbjshop of San Fran-
Cisco," was the reply. -vviUtinn
It may be added that the Archbishop

had no greater admirer than his fellow

Walking down the street one day tro
Archbishop met a gentleman who did not
know him. personally, but who had oft. sn
f een him officiate in his clerical robes
The gentleman stopped him. under to*
Impression that he was only a PJ 1 " 1 : *", *
referring .to* a r-ew parish that had lat-iy
been established somewhere in the biaus. â¢
said:
"The Ar.chblshop ought to send a young
priest to such a large parish."
"Suppose the Archbishop has no young
priests, what is he to dot" asked the
Archbishop. â¢
"Why. you are a young marr**' b&\& h'.s
friend, "why .can't you go?"
During the smallpox epidemic in this
city some thirty-odd years ago the sick
were so numerous jhat it was found im
* possible to accommodate them all "at tho
penthouses erected for the occasion. The^
;6isters of Mercy, under Mother Russell,
volunteered to nurse the afflicted, and rp*
only labored 'during all the progress of
.the dread disease in the pesthouses, but
also In the private residences ;is well.
The Archbishoji *did all he' could to alle
viate the suffering of his fellow citizens,
regardless* of their religious sentiments,
and never spared himself when called to
attend the sick and' dying. He was a very
quiet man, and though broad and liberal
to others, led a very esthetic life. Jils
room contained no furniture but a small
bed and one Chair, and he was very par
ticular in observing all the fasts and
regulations of the church. Although an
Archbishop, he attended sick calls when
ever requested.
One evening he returned from a visit
to a sick person and,* not having finished
his prayers, entered the cathedral on
California street with his key through
the front door. Some one in the distance
Eaw a man entering the church, but was
unable to see who it was and immediately
concluded that it was a jj burglar. He
1 promptly notified the police' and a squad
was sent up td surround the cathedral.
Â¦ -The church was carefully examined with
out the supposed burglar being discovered
until finally the Archbishop came from
a corner where he was saying his prayers
and asked lf.lt was Impossible for a man
to even pray In San Francisco la quiet
Just when Archbishop Alemany re
ceived tho pallium, or Insignia of -his
' new office. Is doubtful, but it was not
' until 1S54, and meantime, he had moved
from Monterey to San Krandsco and had
taken up his residence at the* presbytery
of Bt. Francis Church on Vallejo street,
which thus became the first cathedral of
San Francisco.
] ' At that time there .were only-two Cath
o-lio churches In this city, the old Mis
| slon Dolores, on Dolores street, and St.
Francis, the latter a' cheap, frame bulld
i Ing which stood on the site of the present
church. The new Archbishop immediately
set to work to build his cathedral. Old
St. â¢ Mary's', ; now the Paullst Church, on
the corner of California and Dupont
; streets. St. Patrick's, with Its accom
panying orphan asylum, was .created
about this time also, on the present site
| of the Palace Hotel. The Dominicans
built St. Bridget's on Van Ness avenue,
, where a splendid new church Is now In
process of construction. The parish
records of St. Francis are of much nls
] torical Interest and contain the Â¦ames of
1 many identified with the growth and de
velopment of not only San Francisco, but
, .California and the whole coast. The first

prelate., was designated a. V* 1 "** <*

the. title of the Southern Bishopric.

RECOLLECTIONS AND
REFLECTIONS OF THOMAS FITCH

- West and all the legions which tha bugle
call of endangered liberty had summoned,
filed In grand procession In tho nation's
capital, bearing tattered, but triumphant
banners and bronzed faces and Jubilant
â¢ heartB. past tho places where the foreign
.= Ministers gazed. There was food for for
eign meditation In tha sight. The Conted
eracy was dead and these were Its execu
tioner*. Jefferson Davis paced his cell at
Fortress Monroe, and his armies were
scattered to the winds. Tha American
' experiment of self-government was an
established success. What Europe, deemed
to be Its dying struggles were only thÂ«
throes of a mighty second birth. It had"
sloughed Its viler attributes and though
'the pangs of parturition were mighty It
was a giant who arose purified from the
to*ln-V giant who to-day stretches his
â¢ mighty limbs from the Arctic to the
equator, from the Atlantic westward to
within sight of the shores of Asia, and

mean' his deposition. " " "
The existence of whplesale colonization
in a number of Assembly districts in
Manhattan and tne Bronx was revealed
to-day by the examination .of more than
1000 witnesses,, who were: summoned to va
rious police station's on subpenas issued
by State Superintendent of Elections Mor
gan. From the testimony of these wit
nesses it appeared that the illegal regls
.tratlon amounted to * several thousand.
No less than 350 cases were discovered in
the Fifteenth Assembly District alone. In
which 600 witnesses were examined by
one of the superintendent's deputies.
The usual step, of summoning witnesses
for examination-, in several houses
was taken in- accordance with a
plan arranged by Superintendent Morgan
and Boliee Commissioner Green. The As
sembly districts concerned are ' almost
wholly in the poorer districts In the east
and west sides of the city,' in whjch men
can easily rent rooms for a short time
without exciting suspicion. In nearly all
instances the witnesses testified that the
persons suspected did not Jive in the
houses from whleh they were "registered.
Arrests will follow the- attempt to voto
any of the persons accused: '

TOKIO; Oct. H.â Cablegrams from Jap
an have kept the United States In; touch
with; the recent grave developments of
the Russo-Japanese situation. Informa
â¢tion recelve'd from some of .the leading
diplomatic authorities shows lhat the
gravity of the situation has been by no
means exaggerated. At the present mo
ment, however, there . is prevalent a
strong desire In Japan to preservq peace,
i; possible. Without divulging the names
of authorities who have communicated
their views on thp situation, it may be
said that the ldfea of existence of a
"war party," so-called* in Japan is delu
sory and that the. Emperor, .the Cabinet
and his advisers are all in favor of an
honorable compromise of . th'e "i difficulty.
But it is argued that the conflict between
Russia, which has been described is " the
Japan and Russia: Will Struggle" f or
Supremacy in Far Bast. ,.
CONFLICT MUST COMB.
Fire Chief Estimated That
. at Least- Twenty. Per- '
song Perished! . â¢.
NDWt YORK,. Nor. Vâ Fir* â¢ early this
morning in the tenement', at .426" Eleventh
avenue, known . as "The House of *_All'
Nations," caused the death of from- fif
teen to twenty "persons." .At 4 o'cloclc
seventeen bodies "had been recovered and"
the ' fire chief estimated' that . at .least
twenty persons were killed. Most "of th? m.
died from 6uSC0ca.ti.on. Among the. num
ber, were several women Jind* children.
The flro is supposed" to have been of In
cendiary origin, and although . it burned
but a'.short time- the jsmoke was so densa
that whole families were "overcome. On
the, fifth floor eight bodtes we're recovered,
the stairway leading t& this "floor having
been burhed away.
In '.the dense "darkness a. terrible panic'
prevailed among- {he tenants of the houjiej
many'.of whom evidently had fallen over
the furniture "Jn their apartments and
met' death by" suffocation. '. . â¢
Police Commissioner Greene was on the
sc^ne and the polled re'serves. were'called
out; tcgether Ttyth ambulances from many
hosp:jals ; The police and firemen rescued j
many of* those women and children who
had been oycrcome In the desperate rush,
to the street. *
New America," "and Japan' for the mas
tery, of the .Pactflc must assuredly come
and must Inevitably leave a greater
forthcoming, conflict between Russia and
the United States, unless some halting
ground of Russian expansion" be found.
Japan is convinced that the first halting
ground should be Manchuria, and failing
that, that it must be Korea. There is
â¢ undoubtedly a strong feeling in * Japan
that If Russia be allowed to everrun
Manchuria and also, overrun Korea the
knell of the Japanese empire will have
been sounded. Therefore, while willing
to compromise oh a basis of the perma
nent open door .In Manchuria, the retenÂ«
tlon of- Manchuria by China aa an inte
gral part of her kingdom and the absolute
Integrity ot Korea, .Japan is not prepared
â¢to go -further^
: The present, p.rospects are for continued
negotiations, , but in the outlying dis
trict*. tb.o situation is liable to get out of
hand and a hostile crisis be thus at any
time precipitated.
In the meantime disturbing rumors of
Russian movements, following non-evacu
ation . on October 8 â¢ in defiance of ' the
treaty, ' continue" to unsettle trade. The
Japanese authorities -have taken every
precaution to be In readiness for any pos
sible contfngency, while holding confer-'
ences with the executive departments and
at the same time refraining from such
.aggressive . action as characterizes the
operations, of Russian men at the front.
Of. course, it Is problematical whether
sucli action is authorized by the real au
therities, but the effect is . exasperating to
the average Japanese.
Following are some of . the more im
portant features of the situation:
On October 7, the eve of the date set for
Russian evacuation pf Manchuria. " the
Chuwo, a Tpkio paper, created sensa
tion by publishing ; a report that Baron
Rosen, on returning from Porir'Arthur to
Tokip, presented to the Japanese Govern
ment a draft of a convention, stipulating*
1. That the question of withdrawing
from , Manchuria is to be regarded Â» as
purely a matter between China and Rus
sia, to be arranged : by. direct negotiation
between them, and not in any way to be
interfered with by Japan."

Wealthy Superintendent Dead.
The disturbance lasted eight Hours. At
its climax there were 675 volts of elec
tricityâenough to kill a manâ in the wires
without the battery attached. An hour
later the trouble had virtually disap
peared.
"It was the worst electrical disturb
ance in this city in thlrty-flve years,"
said Chief Operator Pettit of the Postal
Telegraph Company. "At times there
were no workable wires in any direction
and the cable service was seriously af
fected, both on the Atlantic and Pacific."
NEW YORK. Oct. 31.â A brilliant dis
play of the aurora borealis early to-day
interfered with the telegraphic service in
this vicinity. All cablegrams were ac
cepted subject to heavy delay. The
French Cable Company gives notice that,
owing to the extraordinary electric dis
turbances, It is informed by the European
administration that business will be sub
ject to heavy delay.
DULUTH, Minn.. Oct. 31.â The brilliant
northern lights Illuminated the heavens
for half an hour. The display was pro
nounced by many to be the most beautiful
ever seen In Duluth.
CHICAGO. Oct. 31.â Serious electric dis
turbances, said to have been due to the
aurora borealis, or the northern lights,
caused great Interference with telegraph
and telephone companies to-day. Tele
graph wires In all directions from Chi
cago felt the effect, it In some localities
causing a total cessation of business.
Long-distance telephone wires were sim
ilarly affected, communication being en
tirely suspended at tjmes. One report
said that huge waves with high force
passed through the earth, paralyzing the
strength of the wires.
SEATTLE, Oct. 31.â The display of au
rora borealis probably reached its climax
as viewed in the Puget Sound country.
The display lasted over two hours. The
city was illuminated as if by moonlight
through the display. The rays met in a
focus in the zenith. The coloring was
mostly brilliant emerald and blood red.
The effect was startling.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Oct. 3L-A remark
able display of the aurora borealis was
visible here early this morning, continu
ing for several hours. So intense was
the light that many were of the belief
that a large fire was raging north of the
city. Telegraph service throughout the
Northwest was badly crippled for some
time.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 31.â The Rev.
George M. Black- caused an uproar in a
Vancouver meeting last night in a discus
sion of the Alaskan boundary settlement.
He first startled the audience by saying
that Canadians should be sportsmen
enough to" accept the loss. _ He followed
this by remarking that Canada should
mind her own business and should med
dle with nothing across the Atlantic. He
said the disputed territory was of no
value anyway, and if the Americans
wanted it so badly the Canadian* might
Just as well give it to them. $
The chairman of the meeting bitterly
resented the remarks and suggested that
this was but a sample of the kind of ad
vice given Canadians by old country peo
ple, who showed just how little they know
or cared for the Interests of Canada.

In- caring for work horses I like to give
them a drink of water the first thing in
the morning, then some hay and finally
their grain the last thing before going to
breakfast. By letting them eat hay
awhile before feeding the grain they are
not quite. so hungry, and will not eat. so
fast. If there is something in the stom
ach the grain seems to digest better. The
horse will do more and remain in better
condition if worked steadily with short
stops than he will if hurried and allowed
j to stand still long at a time. The last
haif hour before quitting time he should
I have short stops .often, then when he
sets to the stable he can have some water.
At noon give hay while the driver gets
his dinner, then water and feed the grain.
Give a little water when they go out to
work if they -want it.
At night the horses should, have some
water when they come in. Then give hay
and afterward more water before they
have their grain. If one does not feed
the .same at each feeding the horses
should have the largest amount at. night,
when they are going to have a long rest.
I may seem over-cautious about giving
water, but the horse wants plenty of it,
only not too. much at a time. If you will
*watch horses in the yard you will see
them go and drink often and take a' little
at a time. In feeding horses one should

TACOMA, Oct. 31.â Heavy snow has
fallen over the Yukon country from Skag
way to Dawson. Navigation was entirely
stopped a few days ago and the opera
tion of the White Pass Railroad was con
tinued with difficulty. Landslides caused
damage at Juneau, Skagway dnd along
the White Pass Railroad.
On Thursday of last week an Immense
landslide came crashing down Swede Hill
at Juneau and swept three houses into
;the channel. Hundreds, of tons of rock
and trees were carried down by the slide,
which was caused by heavy rains. An
other landslide from Mount Juneau car
ried away a flume leading to a power
house, leaving Juneau in Cuter darkness.
This condition prevailed when the steam
ers arriving to-day left Juneau. . .
Mining operations in Silver Bow Basin
and other localities near Juneau were
stopped by the storm. From two to four
feet of snow covered the White Pass Rail
road, necessitating the use of rotary snow
plows. LÂ»ast year they were not needed
until November 22, a month later than
this year.
A rock slide struck' a freight train on
the White Pass Railroad, Knocking three
boxcars off the rails. Four snowslides
had to be moved before the trains could
run. Heavy snow prostrated the tele
graph lines to Dawson and the United
States. Lilly Bros." warehouse at Skag
way collapsed from the heavy fall of
snow, which was made heavier by a driv
ing rain that followed. A number of
other buildings were damaged. Electric
light and telephone wires were generally
broken by the weleht of the snow.
A week ago Dawson reported by wire
that a heavy snow was falling, with the
thermometer at 8 degrees above zero and
the river full of Ice. It was snowing hard
at every telegraph station between White
Horse and Dawson.

Prince Joachim Albrecht of Prussia Is
like other malp members of the royal
family, an officer, in the. German armyi
but he is much fonder of music than" of
war. He has written the music for a bal
let and is engaged upon an opera. He is
a regular attendant at the theater, and is
said to resemble. In character the late
Prince George, who devoted much of his
time to writing poetry. Some surprise
is expressed at the public and democratic
way in which a member of the royal
family has gone among the composers,
having his name "hilled" like any other,
and it is considered not unlikely that "tbe-

"Not long-ago." says Marshall P. Wild

of a temper, heard." while he was sitting
in his reception hall, the unmistakable
sound of a^fciss coming from the front
rooml at that moment occupied by his
youngest daughter and her young man.
Naturally this made the old gentleman
pretty angry, so up ha bounced and
hopped into the parlor.
"So I've caught you kissing; my daugh T
ter, have I?" he demanded testily.
The young man was a thoroughbred all
right, and he replied: "I trust there is no
mistake about it, sir. The light here is
none too bright, and I should be greatly
disappolnted if it should . turn out that
after all I was kissing the 'cook." â New

residence on Lanal has been struck by
three bolts of lightning and nearly de
stroyed. The building was badly dam
aged, three natives were injured and one
horse was killed by the electricity.* The
accident occurred during a heavy electri
cal storm that swept over that part of the
islands. Two natives had caught some
fish and taken them up to the house to
clean for dinner. The storm came up and
drove the men into the kitchen. Sudden
ly a bolt of lightning descended and
struck tho stovepipe, ran down the pipe
to the stove, Jumped from the . stove
to the floor, knocked a" hole through
the floor and found its way into the
ground. Both of, the men were injured
by the lightning, one of them sustaining
a severe shock on the back of the neck
and the other being hurt about the back.
Both were badly burned. That portion of
the house was also badly damaged, the
stovepipe and a portion of the roof and
floor being wrecked. Some time later a
second bolt of lightning struck the house.
The bolt descended a post in another part
of the building. A third shock injured
another man and killed a horse that were
going for shelter from the front part of
the homestead.

HONOLULU, Oct. 24.â A shocking trag
edy of the sea occurred at Honuapo last
week. Mrs. Kalei Kala, a young native
woman, was walking along the edge of
the reef there In company with her fath
er, who was fishing. In some manner the
woman lost her footing and fell into tho
deep water. Although a native, the wo
man, strange to relate, could not swim.
She cried for help, but before her father
could throw a line or anything to her
she was carried out into the deeper water.
The man could not swim or else he be
came panic stricken and ran crying for
help while the woman was left to her fate.
But the woman did not die by drowning.
A 'worse fate awaited her. As she was
going down the second time she was
seized by sharks. She uttered a shriek of
terror as she felt herself seized by the
sea wolves and dragged beneath the sur
face of the water. Nothing further was
seen of her. â¢

WASHINGTON. Oct. 31.â Various rec
ommendations to cure defects, in account-
Ing methods under which abuses in the
postal service have occurred are made by
Henry E. Castle, auditor for the post
office, in his annual report. He says, the
defects pointed out make infinitely greater
postal abuses than those already disclosed
not only possible but says. The report
says the aggregate transactions of the
postal service during the fiscal year were
$1,026,731,408, as follows: Revenues, $134,224,
443; expenditures, $137.754, ISO; total amount
of money orders issued, $338,865,584; 'money
orders paid, $364,856,894.
Mr. Castle says: "Presumptively there
is a 'double audit' of all governmental,
receipts and disbursements, but literally,
under existing laws and conditions, &0 per
cent of the postal transactions can have
no effect whatever in the postofflce. Less
than $150,000,000 of the billion annual
transactions cap have the shadow of a
'double audit.' As to claims for railway
mail transportation aggregating about
$40,000,000 a year, the report says the au
ditor must rely wholly on the bald state
ment of the departmental authorities that
the amounts certified are due and pay
able."
The auditor recommends that Congress
amend the laws so as to provide when
"any branch of the Government desires
to use a patented article In the public ser
vice some just method of deciding on the
value of the article, based on cost of
manufacture, reasonable profit and fair
royalty, and that the same be fixed as
the price to be paid therefor. The manu
facturer would, doubtless, in all cases, be
willing to accept the price thus estab
lished. He would have no motive for of
fering bribes to any official for approv
ing the sale and the Government would
secure the desired Improvement at a mini
mum cost. If the manufacturer should
refuse the price thus established provision
might be made for invalidating the patent
as to articles required for the public ser
vice."
This recommendation is based on the al
leged criminal practices for which trials
are now pending, which, in almost every
instance, the auditor says, have occurred
in the purchase of article covered by
patents, and as to which the general prin
ciple prevailing in purchasing Government
supplies on competitive bids cannot be en
forced.
Th rise in money rates has halted the
Investment absorption of bonds, but
caused little reaction in prices. Bonds
continue steady with good inquiry, and a
demand for safe investment in mortgage
securities. The purchase of some $25,000;000
of bonds of subsidiary companies of the
Pennsylvania company by cankers was
the event of the week in the bond mar
ket. United States 2a advanced M, the old
4s Vt pec cent, on the closing call of last
week.
Some complaint is heard of the manip
ulative character of occasional advance in
prices. But this, if true, does not detract
from the evidence of an improved specu
lative sentiment and of the cessation of
pressure to liquidate which defeated all
â¢manipulative efforts to advance prices
for a long time. Many high grade inac
tive stocks were sold down under forced
liquidation of small lots, to prices which
offered no indication of the value set upon
them by Investors of the figure at which
investors were willing to part with th"em
unless forced to do bo by tho need of
funds.
Operations in stocks have shrunk to a
few. special movements due. to causes af
fecting individual stocks. The quarrel
anxong' the copper interests in Montana
has been the basis for activity in Amalga
mated Copper, and United States Steel,
has been sombewhat affected by the infor
mation disclosed In the application to
plac* the second mortgage bonds in the
regular listed department at the Stock
Exchange. The Iron and steel stocks
and the railroad equipment stocks as a
class have been affected oy unimproved
conditions in that trade and by the large
decrease in net earnings for the last quar
ter reported by the Pressed Steel Car
Company. Railroad officials have -come
to admit for the first time some declining
tendency in traffic, and freight solicitors
are reported again in the field after a long
period of inactivity. Mercantile agencies
also report a cautious attitude on the part
of the merchants and a disinclination to
order ahead. There has not resulted aJiy
marked depression of the stock market as
a consequence of these developments.
IMPROVEMENT IN EVIDENCE.
The effect of these factors has been the
rise in the local rates for money, both on
call and on time. But the further effect
haa been a precipitate break in the rates
for foreign exchange to the import point,
which has spread the prsasure of the situ
ation into the foreign money markets.
Merchants have been heavy buyers of
cotton during the week. Impressed with
the fear of the formation of another cor
ner in our cotton market. The outgo of
wheat and corn also has expanded. The
rise in local money rates has checked the
demand for exchange to cover previous
sales, which have hitherto steadily ab
sorbed the supply of commercial bills as
fast as they came into the market. The
current demand for gold on the continent
is keen, the ilnal outcome of the exchange
situation is not certain, although it seems
clear that the New York money marke't
has secured control of the exchange situ
ation with power to get gold imports at
need.
FOREIGN MONEY MARKETS.
The tightening of the money market
this week has had a repressive influence
on the stock market and perhaps some
effect also in checking the broadening
tendency of the bond market, which had
begun to reach notable proportions. Vol
lowing the bank and trust company fail
ures at Baltimore and Pittsburg last week
came the news of a run on a St. Louis
trust company by some classes of Its de
positors and the enforcement of .the sixty
days' notice of withdrawal allowed to the
trust companies. This condition led to
large withdrawals of currency from New
York to reinforce . the poeition at St.
Ix>uls. At the same time the, heavy ship
ments to New Orleans for crop moving
purposes have continued and the long de
layed demand froni the West for moving
grain crops has set in.
On Wednesday the transfers of cur
rency out of New York through the SUb-
Treasury reached the unprecedented total
of $2,950,000, of which $2,100,000 was to St.
Louis, which was also the highest record
for a single day's shipment to any one
point. The emergency shipments to St.
Louis are believed to be a temporary
need, although the increasing activity of
the Western money markets may keep
the money there over the crop-moving
period. The spirit of distrust of banking
institutions revealed by the St. Louis
episode has induced conservatism in the
banking world in general, and a disposi
tion to conserve reserves.
BANK FAILURES.
NEW YORK. Oct. 31.â To-day's bank
statement proved to be the only thing: of
influence "in the stock market to-day. A
number of estimates are compiled every
Friday of the week's currency movement
from the bank officials themselves. Yes
terday none of these estimated were re
garded as reliable. These estimates
showed a cash outgo for the week of less
than $13,000,000 and some of them ran to
over $15,000,000. Lest Saturday the bank
statement in its item of cash reserves
failed to show tho estimated decrease of
$4,000,000. Under the workings of the aver
age system las't week's statement would
tend to be corrected in this week's state
ment. The conclusion Is unavoidable that
the actual showing of the cash reserve
item in the bank statement, if it correct
ly represents the actual condition of the
banks, muet be based upon money move
ments not yet disclosed to the public in
the afternoon on which the Friday esti
mates are based. To-day's statement falleS
to have a consoling effect on the stock
market, and a very languid upward move
ment cf prices resulted. It was partly
due to the fact that there was a skeptical
feeling yesterday as to whether the. for
midable decrease in cash would be re
flected in to-day's bank statement. TherÂ«
is a belief that the discrepancies in the
bank statement may be explained by cash
operations between the banks and trust
companies, which do not ap^onr in the
reports of currency movements. The In
crease in loans was not unexpected and is
attributed to preparations for November
settlements and to borrowings by Eastern
institutions in connection with their large
cash withdrawals. The closing was
steady, but very dull and with the ad
vancing tendency checked.

engineers assured him the impression was
the same as going at the rate of 130 miles.

and at the same tlice enlarged on the
good qualities of many of the exhibits.
The speaker dwelt at length on the
requisites of light and shade and declared
that the principal fault to be found in the
majority of the exhibited photographs
was that of heavy printing. He urged all
the photographers preeent to use every
means to secure lighter shades In print
ing portraits for thtlr patrons. !
Three hours were taken up with demon
strations of "Posing and Lighting Under
the Skylight," the lending operators in the
studios of San Francisco explaining their
varions methods. Subjects were seated
and the demonstrators showed the use of
shades In order to get the required artistic
results In photography. The lectures were
more clearly explained by the taking of
photographs and the development of
prints. \
"Practical Talks by Prominent Pho
tographers" took up the bulk of the after
noon. The addresses were short In each
case, but they covered every point In the
camera art. Those who addressed the
members of the association were E. W.
Moore, I. W. Taber, Louis Thors, H C
Vaughan, O. II. Boye, D. F. Mulletider
and L. F. Terkelson of Bushnell's gallery.
The "question box" then followed and
queries by members were answered by the
photographers who had given the conven
tion the results of their experiences.
The business of the convention then
closed and the members, after a brief ad-
JournmenC returned to the art gallery of
the Pavilion in order to receive a large
number of ladies and gentlemen, who in
spected the five thousand photographs and
pictures on exhibition.
When the exhibition closed the mem
bers of the association assembled in
Elks' Hall at Sutter and Grant avenue
and enjoyed an Informal banquet.
Music and song were Indulged In and
the affair was a feature of the gathering
in this city of the photographers.
To-day the visiting protographers will
enjoy a ride to the Cliff House and
through Golden Gate Park. This morn
ing at 10 o'clock a game of baseball will
be played between teams made up - of
photographers and representatives of the
business houses that supply the studios.

HONOLULU, Oct. 24.-Only three na

here a quarter of a century ago as plan
tation laborers all but three have been
returned, 220 of them leaving here Octo
ber 20 on the British steamer Isleworth
the fare being 11000 for the lot. Many
of them had money of their own in the
banks and these contributed toward the
passage money of those who had no funds

All suffered from cold, but no bad ef
fects resulted and all counted the sligfit
hardships as nothing compared to the re
sults achieved. They were able to ride
the entire .distance and spent a "day and
a night at the crater. Their descriptions
convey the roar of escaping flames, gases
and molten mineral from a score of flery
1 geysers which hurled their columns from,
200 to 600 feet Into the air to fall back Into
Â¦ the surrounding lake of liquid lava with
appalling noise.
The scene at night was bewildering In
its glory. A perpetual roar and rumble
from the arena fifty feet below, rivers
and lakes of fire reflecting, back the rising
torrents of Uame that revealed tho jag
ged, fire-worn cliffs, and then rolling col
umns of vapor In a hundred tints. A vast
aurora borealls above, a raging Inferno
beneath.
The crater proper Is approximately
three by seven miles In breadth and
length. Its highest cliffs rise nearly 1000
feet above the lowest level. About a mile
from the observers' camp a small Inner
crater, perhaps a quarter of a mile in
diameter, contains the troubled like of
flre where play continuously the .Incan
descent fountains.
This lake has overflowed its natural
rocky bounds and a broad stream of lava,
flashing in molten tints of every hue.
spreads increasingly over the floor, still
many hundred feet from the upper rim of
the crater proper. Rolling masses of
smoke, Incarnadined beneath, black as
the brow of Erebus above, hang over the
crater and are nightly viewed with awe
and admiration by watchers in Hllo, at
Kilauea, from all over the Islands and
from vessels far away at sea. New cones
constantly form and reform in the lara
lake and river, while immense bubbles of
lava blow and break with hideous gasps.
The present fountains are farther north
than the eruptions of 1S99. The stream
may overflow the southern lip, two miles
from the eruption, or may force Its way
through a weak spot in the crater rim or
lower yet on the southern slopes, general
ly conceded to be the weaker side of the
mountain.' Every vessel, and steamer
coming from the Island of Hawaii reports
a growing increase of activity with
brighter reflections of the fires visible be
low and at sea.

It absorbs the injurious gases which collect
In tha stomach and bowels; It disinfects tha
mouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one form or an.
other, but probably the best charcoal and tha
'most for the money is in Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal, and other harmless an.
tisepttcs in tablet form or rather in tha form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed' with honey.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smokins,
drinking or after eatlns onions' and other odor-
ous vegetable*.
effectually clears and improves ths
complexion, it whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic.

safest and most efficient disinfectant and pur-

taken into the human system for" the sam*

troduce the American plan of checking.
At its principal London terminal station,
where -fifty thousand passengers pass in
and out daily, an expert baggage master
was put in charge, with all the appliances
of an American baggage department. The
arrangement, was very thoroughly adver

the agent reported that the number of
pieces of baggage checked had averaged

have a right, to substitute another candi

HONOLULU, Oct. 24.â The- Federal
Grand Jury - will . November 9 begin to
investigate the actions of the House of
Representatives at the recent session of
the Legislature. The object is to ascer
tain what has become of the missing
vouchers of the House. The organic act
compels that all legislative documents
shall be turned ove/ to the Secretary of
the Territory, a Federal official. In this
way the Federal authorities can act in
the matter, and the investigation is made
under orders from Washington.
. When the legislative session ended all
papers, documents and vouchers -belong
ing to the Senate were turned over to
Secretary Carter in proper order. .The
House documents were In bad slf&pe, how
ever, many papers bÂ«ing missing, as well
as all the vouchers and hooks ~ of ac
counts. Scandals have been current as
to the uses -of the money at the disposal
of the House, and many legislators vhave
been more or less ' directly implicated.
The United States Marshal will subpena
every member of the House to appear
before the Federal Grand Jury on No
vember 9, some of the subpenas having
beep already served. The object of the
Federal ! authorities is to secure posses
sion of the missing documents, which are
Federal property. Beyond this it will not
go, as the use or misuse of Territorial
money is a matter for the attention of
the Territorial . Attorney General and a
Territorial Grand Jurj-. It has been
claimed that; the missing vouchers have
been destroyed as were those of the

Notes- on Railroads.
Dr. Parkhurst of New York, famous or notorious according to your point of view, has waited
long and patiently for a vindication of his crusades and of his purposes. It has come at last. He has
been roundly denounced, roasted \o a turn and, worse than both, has been placed in the same unholy
category as newspaper reporters by John * Alexander Dowie. Thus it happens that out of infamy
The bucolic stranger within our gates who cashed a worthless check for an unknown .man the
other day must have heafd some hayseed. speak of the advantages of money to burn and wanted some
of it. He should be hustled out of town as Â¦ soon as possible, as he sets a bad example to. the weak
and provides an unnecessary temptation to citizens who otherwise would respect other people's money.
A New York merchant, who has just returned from .'a long residence in the Orient, says with
some warmth and emphasis that we are neglecting our manifest opportunities in Manchuria. Our critic
unquestionably* is informed of Russia's persistent balking at the, door opened to us,'.and perhaps we may
not be wanting in wisdom if we hesitate to see whose fingers are jammed when an attempt is made to
close that door. â¢

The total mileage of railroads centering
In Chicago is above 80,000 miles, at a cap
italization of nearly five billion dollars.
The remarkable rise In railroads that
made it possible for Chicago to become
such a great city Is fully told by Joseph
Kirkland in his "Story of Chicago," now
being published by the Dominion Com
pany. Nothing In history can equal the
enterprise of the American people, as is
shown in this single industry.
In 1843. when the first locomotive drew
two coaches containing about twenty pas
sengers at a speed of about five miles an
hour over ten miles of tracx, it was truly
regarded as a marvelous event.
Now, however, the Illinois Central alone
runs 123 suburban trains dally ir. Chicago,
carrying nearly fifty thousand passengers.
Through the same depot there runs from
other roads entering there 316 trains dally,
with a traffic of nearly 100,000 passengers.

And there, through streaks of paint and
coat of tan, shone faintly the tattooed
letters "H. S."! . .
"Hal! .My little,, little boy!" murmured
Scott dazedly. Then his knees loosened
and. he fell across the body.
â¢Unmindful .of. his own fatal wounds,
Scott stood -staring wildly down at his
.dead foe. In falling," the blanket that had
become loosened during the struggle had
now come apart, revealing the savage's
bare chest.
Back and forth, silent but deadly, they
struggled up and down the tiny glade.
Both were giants. Both were powerful
beyond belief. But the strength of mad'
ness nerved Scott. Little by little the
Brule's head : was forced back. At last
there , was a dull "click" and the Sioux
collapsed in a heap on the earth. His
neck was broken.
The Impact knocked the rifle from the
Brule's hand and it fell with a soft thud
to the eround. .
Grappling furiously with his Insane as
sailant, the Brule managed to draw his
knife and. plunge It at least half a dozen
times into Scott's body. The old man,
though wounded unto death, relaxed not
one atom of his terrible grip on the sav
age.
In the fraction of a/econd, while I was
debating, the problem was solved. Un
able to restrain himself longer, Scott
dropped his rifle and with one incredibly
long bound was in the glade and at the
Indian's throat.

It was perhaps three minutes later that
a faint rustling that none but a Western
ear could have detected made me raise
my eyes. Beyond our thicket was a little
glade, perhaps twenty feet wide. The un
derbrush on. the far side rustled again
ever bo faintly, and the head and should
ers of an Indian appeared. He was a
tremendous fellow, in full war paint and
feathers. At a glance I read him for a
Brule Sioux. He was a scout sent ahead of
the main war party to spy out the ground
before the braves closed in on the settle

okee outpost without either of the heridl
tary foes having seen the other I do not
know to this day. But ,tbere~4ie was. He
could not see us, hidden as we were. After
one cautious look he stepped into the
glade. , -
The same moment Scott saw him I could,
tell by his almost noiseless gasp of Joy
that he recognized' the newcomer as a
Brule. I dared not fire on the Indian lest
the rest bo warned by the shot and the
ambush fall. I dared not let him go on
lest he discover some of our men in the
woods and give the alarm. What was to
be done?
â¢ â¢ â¢
"That's why I hopes they're Brules,"
he explained apologetically, and lapsed
into silence.
"Why?" I asked inadvertently. Then,
at once I remembered. It was a party of
Brule Sioux who had caused his life trag
edy.
"It was .the Brules that took him," he
said In reply. "Took himâ Just a baby he
wasâ and tortured him to death. And him
never havin" had even a cross word said
to him in his life!"
I made no reply and he rambled on:
"He was the grandest child that ever
was, that little Hal of mine. The liveliest
and the prettiest. His skin was like milk.
It was so white that his ma got real mad
once when I tattooed a big blue 'H. S.' on
his little white chest. I just did it to
please him, 'cause he'd seen the tattoo
marks on my arm (I follered the sea as a
young man), and begged me to make
some on him. He was as proud of them
marks as I'd be of a dl-mond. Poor little
Hal! My little, little boy!"
He muttered the last words in his beard,
apparently forgetting my presence. The
fiery blue eyes dimmed a moment, then
blazed with fresh fury.
"If only they're Brules I'll be satisfied."
As we crouched side by side in the 'un
dergrowth in the growing dawn he spoke
at last, more to himself than to me:
â¢ â¢ â¢
years he had lived on there, more than
â¢once traveling nearly a hundred miles on
the chance of joining a fight against the
Sioux. His one desire in life was to slay
as many Sioux as possible, and the score
had mounted high during the long stretch
of years.

"To stand for the American principle that supervision and not ownership is the true function of
government, be it city, county, State or nation. To maintain that public officers are servants and not
masters of the people. To end the labor question by adoption of the eight-hour day.
"To stand by the men who stand for plain justice for rich and poor alike, and to drive out of
power all who would trample on our lawful institutions, for their own individual aggrandizement." '
That is not a bad platform as a rule of action for the members of all parties. Our political insti
tutions began in the town-meeting of New England. It was copied from the old Saxon Wittengamote,
which was the germ of that, parliamentary system of government which, has perpetuated the British
empire, and is one of the three co-ordinate branches of our Federal Government. If it were- generally
adopted again it would' make a' proper and splendid school in which to train our foreign-born citizens in
line with our institutions, and would compel them into an association which would make it necessary
for them to use the English language if they desire any part in our politics.
WE have in California the compulsory primary election law. It has not been in operation long
enough to demonstrate the wisdom of the State taking control of political parties.^ In this
city it lias seldom brought to the primary polls even a large minority of any party. If the
statements of candidates are. to be taken as true, it has not resulted in the purification of
party politics. For instance, Lane and Schmitz were both nominated by the operation of that law, and
each stigmatizes the other as an enemy oi reform, the foe of purity and the intended destroyer of the
best interests of the city. The truthfulness of a man goes to his character and is largely decisive ot
his fitness for a public tnist. If they both tell the truth about each other, the primary election law has
not improved politics. If neither tell the truth, the conclusion is the same. .
Under the system a man cannot get his name on a ticket except through the primary. The con
vention system, which started in the open caucus, did somewhat limit the selection of candidates. But it
is not to be forgotten that the period of selfishness and corruption in American politics began with the
limitations on a man's right to make himself a candidate for office and to solicit the support of his fel
low-citizens. William H. Seward said that Virginia's long supremacy in national affairs was the result
cf 'her system of self-nomination. Her best men were attracted to public life by their ability to present
themselves for office and submit their claims to the judgment of their fellow-citizens, without asking
the consent of any caucus or convention. It is a far cry from that plan to our present network of re
strictions and prohibitions, that seem to be a check only on the best and fittest, but leave opportunity open
to the venal and corrupt. There is no question that the greatest freedom of choice is the best fnr a
popular form of government. When the law restricts that freedom and the elaborate legal machinery
of the primary presents, as it often does, two candidates for the same office and both unfit, the voter
has no choice outside the two. If self-nomination, as in old Virginia, were the rule, the voter would
have no excuse for snubbing the polls because no candidate deserved his trust. \
As a protest against these restrictions there has arisen in Clevland, Ohio, the "Split Ticket Asso
ciation," which may be constituted of the members of all parties. Its platform is this :
"To encourage independent voting, so the best men will be elected, regardless of party politics.
"To discourage the practice of electing men for more than two terms, and to oppose the idea of
allowing any person more than four years in the public service (local) except the civil service.
"To insist that public positions shall be given to others besides those who lh r e by politics alone."

A Sutter street youth who has not yet
attained the dignity of wearing trousers
Is the hero of a. unique adventure. An
older boy living next door informed him
one afternoon that if he should follow the
car tracks far enough he would find the
lump of gold from which the trolley wires
were made, and that then he might pur
chase every candy cigar in the confec
tionery store on the corner. The toddler
knew no easier road to unalloyed happi
ness, and eluding his mother's eye he set
out alone for the first time in hia life to
face the world in search of wealth.
The mother soon observed that her off
spring was among the missing, and set
out in pursuit. She descried him sitting
on the curb two blocks away. Fearful
that he might take a sudden notion to
get in front of a car, she ran toward him,
shouting promises of those rewards vis
ited upon the transgressing young. She
found the child gazing delightedly into a
chamois skin bag. Grasping him firmly
by the ear she marched him home, and
had applied the familiar slipper before
investigating his discovery.
What was her astonishment to find that
the bag contained $625 in gold.

Sad Story of Harold.
]r T is history that the city of San Francisco has had its worst government under the party repre
| sented by Mr. Lane.' This history is not written by Repub[ieans, but by their opponents. The
highest development of boss politics was under Mr. Lane's party. It was so ingenious that it
secured a partnership with men who figured as Republican bosses, v and between the two crowds'
San Francisco got government that is remembered as a man remembers bad luck or a serious fit
Since Mayor Ellert's excellent administration the Republican party has had but little voice in the
government of San Francisco. Sutro and the Phelan administrations and that of Mayor Schmitz have
been upon us since, arid have all been denounced and derided by the Democratic organs which .were
directly or indirectly responsible for them.
The opportunity is now given for the people to choose an administration that is not bossed by
anybody, and will have no strings on it. If ever a perfectly independent man ran for office in this town:
that man is Henry J. Crocker. Under the new charter the power of the Mayor over the government of
the city is vast and various. Put a professional, politician, who is aspiring and ambitious, and whose
scruples are blunted by aspiration and ambition, as is the case with all professional politicians, and he
but feebly resists the temptation to use this power for political instead of for public purposes. Both
Schmitz and lane are professional politicians. Lane got the start of Schmitz, but the Mayor has made
a good second, considering the short time he has been in training.
But the intention of the charter is to make it possible for a business man to be Mayor, to admin
ister the government according to the. most 'enlightened rules and ethics of business. The Republican
party, keenly sensitive to this spirit and purpose of the city's organic law, nominated a business man for
Mayor, and it is the duty of the people to elect him. Of course he has been attacked and defamed, per
sonally, and has been vilely abused by the two newspaper organs of. Mr. Lane. But this only proves our
premise that professional politicians desire to teach merely business men like Mr. Crocker to. retire from
public affairs and let the politicians run them. The abuse of him from such a source is a reason why
he should be supported by all men who resent the insolent policy of making business men fear to run the
gauntlet of a candidacy. .*Â¦"Â¦â¢'....
The people of this city want no more class politics such as Mayor Schmitz represents, and no
more boss politics as represented by Mr. Lane. They have positively no interest in making Mr. Lane's
election an opening popgun in Mr. Hearst's campaign for the Presidential nomination. They want a man
for Mayor for the purposes of the whole city, of all the people and not of a class, and to consider the
great future of San F'rancisco, instead of the future of a self-seeking, self-advertising, self-praising poli
tician. To accomplish all this, the election of Mr. Crocker is a necessity. The fight is straight between
him and Schmitz, and every vote for 'Lane increases Schmitz's chance of winning. We say these things
without personal prejudice or bias. The Republican, independent and high-minded Democratic voters of
the city have in their hands the power of decision. We are' persuaded that they will decide for Crocker,
as representing more of what they desire to accomplish than Schmitz and Lane rolled into one.

"The work of the California -Promotion
Committee is one in which college women
will have interest." said Mr. Wright, "be
cause it is practical, of a sociological and
economic nature and concerns every
phase of living. It will be especially in
teresting to college women living in this
State, because its success- concerns the
welfare of California. One of the most
inviting th'inga about California is the
fact that its merchants, business and pro
fessional men spend sums so large in the
aggregate to develop the State and to in
terest others in California.
'The results of the work are well Known
and the methods of the committee have
been followed with success by other or
ganizations. The merchants of Hawaii
sent a representative to San Francisco,
and now Hawaii has a Hawaiian Promo
tion Committee. The people erf Georgia-;
Dallas. Tex.; New Orleans and of four of
the great States of the South have con
ferred with the Promotion Committee and
are adopting its methods of work."
Typical letters were read from settlers
who had come and who were coming to
California.

"The work incident to extended order,"

Company drill followed in the following
order: Company C, Captain G. J. Petty;
B, Captain W. S. Grattan; A, Lieutenant
W. A. Varney; D, Captain F. V. Kess-
Ilng. The companies performed a consid
erable share of the drill regulations, in
cluding extended orders, all well executed
except the last. In a number of instances
In forming lines of squads the men did
not remember their numbers, causing con
fusion in assembling. The movement of
skirmishers would have been improved
upon had the guide been announced. With
this exception the drill was good. The
manual of arms in battalion and company
drill was very well executed, though a
little slow in cadence of movement.
WORK IS LOOTED.
Dr. F. S. Emmal has been appointed a
second lieutenant of the First Battalion,
artillery, and designated inspector of rifie
practice.
In hi? inspection report of the FiMt
Battalion, " artillery. N. G. C. Colonel
Thomas Wilhelm. U. S. A., says that hÂ«
made an Inspection and that the non-com
missioned staff, color guard and men gen
? vally miide a splendid appearance, being
very st*aÂ«"y in the ranks and nppÂ»aririt'
to appreciate the importance of the work
in hand. The shirts worn by the men
were somewhat out of uniform in texture,
but thf> clothing was good and well cared
for. The arms, Springfield rifles, were In
very good order. 'After Inspection drill
was called for, and the battalion, com
manded by Major H. P. Bush, went
through many movements prescribed by
the drill regulations. Most of these were
well executed, but in several Instances
the companies were not well directed.
Changing by thÂ» right flank failed in the
first effort; in several instances thÂ© sec
ond captain conducted his company im
properly to the ne.w position, but the er
ror was corrected before the close of the
drill; the guides were not always careful
to remember the points of rest; the ca
dence of step was a trifle short of that
required, and the company commanders
were advised that "right of companies'
rear into column cannot be executed from
column of fours."
Captain F. V. Kessling, who wan de
tailed from the First Battalion, artillery,
to attend the military movements at West
PoJnt recently, has returned and reported
lor duty.
Sergeant J. Whitney of Battery D, First
Battalion, artillery, haa been elected sec
ond lieutenant of that organization, Major
B. 8. Dorn presiding at the election.
CHANGES IN GUARD.
He said that ho would do all he could
to bring the guard of this Stato in closer
touch with the regular army, but that to
do this he would need the aid of every
member of the guard. After the Inspector
shall have talked to all the companies of
this regiment he will meet the regimental
officers and give them advice.
During the last week Colonel Wilhelm,
United States Inspector, visited three
companies of the Fifth Infantry in Oak
land. The companies were that of Aia
meda. Captain McDonald and Lieutenants
Smiley and Schroder; Company A of Oak
land. Captain Hunt. Lieutenants Pierson
and Poulter, and Company F, Captain
Covalt and Lieutenants Nickerson and
Johansen. There were present Colonel
Hayes, Major D. A. Smith, Captain Simp
eon and Lieutenant Strong of the staff.
After assembly the companies came to at
tention and the Inspector gave the men
a talk on the line of duty. He said that
the men presented a fine physical appear
ance, that there was every evidence of
intelligence and he felt sure that with
proper training they would make ftrst
class soldiers. He said that the officers
in order to have good companies must
commence with v.Jiat there is in the be
ginning of the book and not commence
at the middle.
He cautioned the officers in the matter
of taking care of the men, calling atten
tion to the fact that when one man is
eick it takes a well man to care for him
and that in that way the force of the or
ganization is impaired. He spoke of the
necessity of officers being good dls
cipliniarians. but not to the extent of be
ing a martinet. He then, addressing him
self to the men, called attention to the
fact that a. good soldier always takes a
pride in dress, arms and accoutrements
and then, he stated that all commanding
officers should be careful to obtain for
their commands all that belongs to each
company, whioh can always be secured
through the proper form of requisition.

Under the Roman Consuls, rings were
at first manufactured of iron, and worn
only by soldiers, and that upon the third
finger of the left hand, hence denominated
tho ring finger. Increasing wealth soon
superseded an ornament of this, inferior
metal by introducing rings of more costly
materials, and those made of gold were
afterward so very general that It Is re
lated after the celebrated battle of Can
nae Hannibal sent a bushel of them, to
the Senators at Carthage, of which he
had despoiled the slain and prisoners.
Under the Emperors, the common sol
diers, and even freedmen, wore gold rings,
although they were originally prohibited
unless personally given by the Emperor.
Tho petitions soliciting this privilege be
came, however, so I numerous that Jus
tinian was tired of their importunity, and
ultimately permitted all who thought
proper to bestow them. Rings have very
long taken a conspicuous part as love
tokens. Of all the sorts of rings which
have frequently been dispatched as mes
sengers of love that kind of double-hooped
one (half of which was often worn by
the lover, the. other half by his "soul's
delight") called the gemmow, or grimmal
ring, stands pre-eminent. Upward of
twenty instances might be quoted from
Shakespeare mentioning the use of this
kind of ring.â London Mirror.
The custom of wearing rings to adorn
the hand is of such remote date that all
attempts to trace Us origin are lost in the
obscurity of antiquity; but the primary
Intention of this practice, in early ages of
he world, appears to have been as an
emblem of authority and government; and
this was symbolically communicated by
delivering a ring to the person on whom
they were intended to be conferred. . In
conformity to this ancient usage the
Christian church employed the ring in the
ceremony of marriage (which was first
adopted by the Greek church) as a symbol
of the authority which the husband gave
to his wife over his household, and of the
earthly goods with which he thus en
dowed -her.

"But important letters don't go that way
generally. They turn up sometimes to ac
cuse a man. They find their way be

wo fellows get hold of them. If I wanted
to go into the blackmailing business I
could make plenty of money. I've found
letters and papers in cast-off clothing that
would make pretty startling reading for
"One can't buy cast-off clothing for
many years without meeting some queer
experience's," remarked an "old clothes
man" the other day as he fumbled
through the pocket3 of a suit, which he
had just purchased for 50 cents. "Of
course, I don't expect to find -anything â
nothing except, maybe, some eld letters.
But it pays to run through the pockets
and feel the lining. If a man who lets
his wife sell his cast-off clothes only knew
what got lost In the lining ot his coat
sometimes he wouldn't feel so* easy about
parting with, them. A man sticks import
ant letters ln his inside coat pocket and
some day when he wants them they are
not there. He hunts and fumes around,
but the letters don't turn up. Then he
thinks they -must have been torn up or
burned, and he forgets the matter.

"I have this day sold my house ln which
I live, 235 Broadway, to Elijah .Boardman

upper part to form part of the American
Hotel for JGO.OOO. t bought this property
on the 8th of March, 1821. I gave Jona
than Smith $25,000 for it. I make a large
proilt; but the rage for speculation is at
present so high that it will prove an ex
cellent purchase. Tho house belonging to
the Phoenix Insurance company, two or
three doors above Warren street, was sold
this day at aucUon for $40,000. The build
ing is worth little or nothing and the lot
is only 25x106; mine Is 37x120. and is very
cheap, compared with the other. I am
to retain possession until the loth of Octo
ber, unless I choose to give it up before.
I shall leave this delightful house with
feelings of deep regret. The splendid
rooms, the fine situation, my snug library,
woll arranged books, handsome pictures;
what will become of them? I have turned
myself out of doors; but $60,000 Is a great
deal of money."
About three weeks later Mr. Hone made
thjs additional entry in the diary: "I
bought this day from Samuel Ward ' for
$15,000 the lot corner of Broadway and
Great Jones street, twenty feet wide and
i one hundred and thirty feet deep. It is
my intention to build a house on thl3
lot for my residence, after I shall be
turned out of the house I now occupy."
He proceeded to put up that house at
once and moved Into it 1837, living there
until his death in 1851. Later it was occu
pied by various' business concerns, and
! latest by the East River Bank up to the
time of Us purchase and razing early last
year.â New York Commercial.

AN OLD DIABY SHOWS
GROWTH OF NEW YOBK
Land That Sold For Songs Before
"Many Washingtonians are extravagant
In getting rid of their cast-off clothing.
They have so many that they become a i
nuisance to them. Sell them to the first '
man who comes along Is the easiest way
for them to dispose of their useless be
longings. If the servants don't take them
away, we get a fine pick at them. For
from 50 cents to a dollar you get a suit
that will, when brushed, steamed, cleaned
and pressed, easily brings $3 to |5. The
clothes are not worn much, but just soiled
and mussed a little. The trousers are
stretched a little so they will bag at the
knees when used a few days at a time.
A man with plenty of money won't stand
that. He will order his wife or valet to
sell them.
"The greatest amount I ever found ln
money in one coat was a J10 bill, but sev
eral times I've found $2 and $3 bills,' and $1
bills by the score. Once I found a check
for $100, but as that was no good to me.
I returned it to the owner and received
Jl reward for my honesty. The best find,
however, was several years ago, when
I discovered a bunch of railroad coupons
between the lining and inside cloth of one
of these fancy vests. I suppose I might
have cashed the coupons and received
11000 for. them, but there was some risk to
such a proceeding. So I concluded to tucn
them over -to the owner and trust to his
"You know how easy It is for small
coins to work their way through a hole
In the lining of a vest and snuggle down
ln the corner of the cloth. Well, we pick
up quite a number of dimes and nlckles
in this way. Usually a vest is a small
silver mine. Probably the wife of the
man feels something there and thinks it
is only a button or some such thing, or
maybe a penny, and she won't bother in
trying to fish It out. But pennies don't
work down there nearly as readily as the
dimes and nickels do.
"In the same way a bill will get mixed
up in the lining of the Inside pocket and
finally disappear. The man probably
misses a five or ten dollar bill, and thinks
he must have lost it or spent It foolishly.
The matter escapes his mind, the" suit Is
thrown to "one side and some day it is
sold to the 'olel clothes man." It doesn't
escape us.' We go through every inch
of the lining, and examine the corners and
Inside carefully. The bills we find in the
course of a day will often more than pay
ub for what we have given for all of the
clothes.
some people. Love letters? Oh. yes: lots
of them. A man isn't half so careful
about these tender missives as he Is about
checks and coupons and such valuable
documents. But usually the love letters
are signed only by somebody's first name
and addressed to some 'dear' or 'darling.*
which won't give the writer away. Of,
course, when we get the clothes by hunt
ing up the address ln the directory we
can locate either the writer or the one
receiving It.
"I don't think that, as a rule. Wash
ington women sell their husband's cast-off
clothing any more without going through
all their pockets. Maybe they've got into
the habit of searching them, so that it
becomes a second nature to them. So it
is not in the pockets we find things. It's

Alpers claims that records of Foote' a
notarial office will show that the transfer
of the property from Hausman to him
was made, but said that Â»o far his at
torney had failed to 'find the book which
would confirm his ctaim. He says, how
ever, that when the trial comes off he will
produce the records to show his owner
ship of ttie property and the fact that
Hausman conveyed it to Rauor after he
had deeded it to Alpers.
The warrant for Hausman's arrest was
r.ot served yesterday, although he was
prepared to give bail. Several months ago
he was arrested on complaint of Alpers
for alleged felony embezzlement in con
nection with the funds of the National
Fertilizer Company. The charge was dis
missed by Police Judge Cabaniss.
Hausman said that the only convey
ances he had ever made to Alpers were
a bill of sale for the personal property
included in the plant and a deed for realty
in what is known as Butchertown, in
South San Francisco. He admitted get
ting a deed from Stetre to the property
named in the criminal complaint by Al
pers, but denied altogether that he had
cxe-cuted a deed to Alpers for the same
property. He refused to state what con
sideration he had paid Steere for the
transfer that is on record. He said that
he transferred to Rauer simply to clear
the title.
All this property Alpers claims to have
been the owner of by virtue of a deed
from Hausman, dated in August, 1902.
Previous to that time, he says, it was
ln the name of Charles W. Steere, and
he naively admits that its retention in
Steere's name since 1883 was due to the
fact that he was trying to evade his
debtors. He say6 that the property was
transferred from Steere to Hausman. who
was then his confidential clerk, because
he wished to avoid his creditors. The
Seed was made because his creditors had
ascertained that Steere was not the owner
of the property and were endeavoring to
have the property attached for debts of
Alpers.
He says that he had the transfer made
on the advice of his then attorney, Harry i
V Morehouse, who*e name appears as
a witnefs to the deed. At the same time,
Alpers claims a deed was executed from
Hausman to him. which was witnessed by
Morehouse. Neither deed was recorded,
although he claim? they were acknowl
edged on the same d^y by Henry .S. Foote,
now United States District Judge in In- ;
dlan Territory. Morehouse, he says, was ,
a witness to bom deeds. Morchouse's ,
signature as a witness was attached to j
the deed from Steere to Hausman. which j
was Dlaced on record on May 9 of the j
present '-ear. Tnere are two acknowlrds?- j
ments en the 'deed. In one of these the (
date of tne execution appears as August â¢
8 1902 The subsequent acknowledgment
is of "date May 7. 1903. The discrepancy I
is explained by Alpers by the fact that |
when the deed was executcu to which I
Morchoupe bore witness the real grantor, j
Steere. wat not present. He virtually i
admits that Steere's name was signed )5y .
himself and says that the attorney in .
sighing his name to the transfer was cog- j
nizant if this fact. On the same day. j
he says, and at the same time Hausman ]
made a oeed to him of al* the property. .
SOLD UNDER EXECUTION.
As o basis of his claim that Hausman
afterward defrauded him. he claims that |
HauÂ«man. acting as his connMental clerk, j
abstracted the de*>Â«l from Hausman to ;
Alpers from a safe in the office, leaving I
only the deed from Btcere to Hausman. j
Subsequently Rauer ol twined a judgment ;
against Alpers for $5000 and on ascertain- ;
ing that 'the Steere title really vested in
Alpers, sold cut the properly under an !
execution The purchaser waÂ« E. Conn. ,
In order to clear the title Rauer says j
that he got Hausman to convey to him j
umitr the deed from Steere. There were!
1 othtr liens on the real estate and after
I all claims had been closed up Cohn is said j
! to have paid Alpers JO00 for the property. ;
| which is valued approximately at $20,000. |
; Both sides are full of claims of unfair j
idcaling against one another. Hausman |
! claims that the issuance of the warrant
i for his arrest is the result of a business
i de-al concerning th^ purchase of a plant
owned originally by Alpers. who had a I
â¢ franchlse_for the removal of dead anl-
I mals. In consequence of disagreements
' Hausman says lie lost $2000 and this
| amount ho tried to recover by continuing i
j the business, despite the- opposition of I
: Alpers. He succeeded in recouping his i
J losses* by disposing of the plant to the
' San Francisco Sanitary Company, which
j succeeded to the franchise owned by
: Alpers.
I DENIES DEEDING TO AX.PERS.
Peculiar business methods, to say the
least, were disclosed by the Issuance of
a warrant In Police Judge Fritz's court
yesterday, when Charles Alpers, a sup
posed capitalist, charged & putative real
estate dealer namÂ«d F. H. Hausman with
felony. He specified the charge under the
statutory law as selling realty twice, first
to him and subsequently to Jake Bauer,
a bill collector. The value of the prop
erty Is said to be $20,000.
According to Alpers* statement, Haus
man was his confidential clerk in August,
1902. when a deed was executed from
Charles W. Steere to Hausman for pieces
of property in the city and county of
San Francisco as â¢follows: Lot on Lib
erty street: lot on the corner of Fran
cisco and Franklin streets; lot on Sixth
avenue in the Bernal Rancho tract: lot
on Valencia street, near Twenty-fifth; lot
on the corner of Twenty-fourth and Ellen
streets wllh adjoining property; land ln

Stuart's Dyspepsia" Tablets are for sale
by all drugrsists at 50 cents a box. The
druggist never fails to have them ln stock,
because the demand for them Is so great
and eo pronounced that he cannot afford
to be without them: People who could
not set them of one druggist would go
to another and would get ln the habit of
buying their other drugs there as well aa
their Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets relieve the j
stomach of its work by taking up the ]
work and doing It Just as one set or
tUtt of workmen relieves another. They Â¦
actually digest the food in just the same
manner and just the same time as the
digestive fluids of a sound stomach do. In
fact, when dissolved ln the stomach they
arc digestive fluids, for they contain
exactly the came constituents and ele-
ments as the gastic juice and other di-
Bestlve fluids of the stomach. No mat-
ter what the condition of the stomach is.
their work is just the same. They work
in their own natural way without regard
10 surraundlns conditions.
The. stomach being thus relieved by
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Is restored
and renewed by nature and the rest of
tbc human body does not suffer In the
least by reason of its failure to perform
Its wcrk.
A Wisconsin man says: "I suffered the
pangs of dyspepsia for ten years. I tried
every known remedy with Indifferent re-
sults until, I was told of the remarkable
cures of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I
nought a box, began taking them and
forgot I had a stomach. Thfee boxes
cured me completely. I have had no trou-
bie whatever for a year and have an ap-
petite like a harvest hand and can eat
anything that is set before me without
fear of bad results.",
There is such a thing as forbearance
ceasing to be a virtue, even'in the case of
one's stomach. There is no question but
that some stomachs will stand a great
deal more wear and tear and abuse than
other*, but they all have their limit and
when that limit Is reached the stomach
must be reckoned with as sure as fate.
The be Ft way and really the only effec-
tive way to treat your stomach when it
rebels Is to employ a substitute to do Its
work. This will give the weakened and
worn-out organ an opportunity to rest and
refrain its strength and health.
There Is Nothing to Prevent You Em-
ploying a Substitute to Do Its Work.

STRIKE?

ESSEX, la., Oct. 31.â John Murray
Dowle, crushed by the attack made "upon
him by his son, John Alexander' Dowle,
says : , ' ' ." ' '
1 The statement that I am not the father of
John Alexander Dowle is the greatest myth
efer uttered by the mouth of" man. It is
scandalous that my son should repudiate me
after I have done so much for him. He is
my son and was born, in lawful wedlock.. No
one can deny It. The records may be bad at
the Great Register Offices, Princess street,
Edinburgh, Scotland. ' r have always lived a
quiet, peaceful, Christian life and it breaks
my heart to have this trouble come toward the
end. .... ..'Â¦'. â¢ . ,
Judge Dowle, who Is respected by the
whole community, 'lives here, in his -little

missioner Kershaw estimates / that the

have ceased at Kalama and Wind River,
the take of the former plant being 6,128,000
eggs and "of the latter 2,490,000..
Commissioner Kershaw states that the
output of those two plants would have
been 20,000,000 . had , not racks ! been
washed out in September. The estimated
output of the Chinook, 'Wenatchee and
MethoW hatcheries" is 12,000,000. % - â¢ ' .
The output of the Oregon State hatch
eries will exceed 30,000,000, while thÂ© Gov

additional 15,000,000. The failure of the
sockeye run- on the- sound 'and the con-,

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 31.â At the prelimi

tice of the Peace of Redwood Township
at Guerneville, held at Healdsburg to
day, he was bound over to the Superior
Court. Since his arrest Brown has" been
at liberty on a bond of $2000.
y In his capacity as a Justice Brown re
cently issued a warant for the arrest of
a man known as Patrick Weir on com
plaint of Charles Hansen. The latter and
Weir had" trouble one afternoon on the
road between Cazadero and Guerneville.
After issuing the warrant Brown set out
to arrest the man and was accompanied
by Hansen. En route they secured the
services of Elisha Shortridge to assist
them- The man was found in a deserted
cabin in Oregon Canyon. As he lay asleep
on an improvised bed he was shot and
fatally wounded, death ensuing after sev
eral hours. A Coroner's jury subsequent
ly exonerated the men who were en
deavoring to take Weir prisoner, but
District Attorney Pond was not satisfied
with this verdict. He .swore to a com
plaint charging Brown with manslaugh
ter, the evidence taken at the Coroner's
inquest being sufficient in his estimation
to back the charge. Both Hansen and
Shortridge testified that Brown fired the
fatal shot, but this Is met with a denial
from the accused official. Brown is over
70 years of age and has been a respected
resident of Guerneville for many years.

Tho porch climber who has been op

a successful time. All the efforts of the
detective department to ascertain the
identy of the bold operator have been so
far futile. He is supposed to be the same
individual who was bo successful in his
work during 1 the last two winters.
His' failure to secure a sufficient recom
pense for his enterprise in entering the
Fowler residence, at 1220 Masonic avenue,
on Wednesday evening caused him to re
turn to the Western Addition, and the
place' selected was -the residence of J.~ S.
Martin, 2220 Sacramento street. While
the family was at dinner on Friday even-,
ing. between 6 . and 7 o'clock the porch
climber forced open one of the upstairs
windows. _ He thoroughly ' ransacked the
bedrooms and took away with him J12 in
cash, and a quantity of valuable jewelry.
The jewelry Included a string of gold
beads, gold brooch, gold breast pin, gold
scarf pin, child's pin set with turquoise,
child's breast pin, silver pin with tur
quoise setting, butterfly pin set with
pearls and a lady's gold ring.
The burglary was | discovered when a

up stairs after dinner. All the bureau

This has been one of the most unusual
Octobers experienced In many years.
There was .17 of an inch of rainfall dur
ing the entire month.
Mr. McAdle of the Weather Bureau said
yesterday: "From October 11 to 23 there
has been an area of high pressure lying
over the northwestern portion of the
country. I have very little hope of rain
while that condition lasts. In the last two
days, however, the indications have been
po.nt ir.p to its breaking up.
"Although the skies are clear, there is
a chance for rain. Everything is going
well tor a rainfall in the near future.
"The ra-'nfall of .17 of an inch is the
lowest we have had in October for sever
years. In October, 1S05. there wa3 very
little rainfall. What has made this Octo
ber particularly peculiar was the loner
dry spell preceding it. We have had no
rain outside of this .17 of an Inch' since
April*16 of this year. During 1 a period of
198 days there has been but two days of
rain. The average rainfall for the month
of October is 1.04 inches."

Farrell made a thorough search of the
neighborhood and came across two or
three men, but none answered the descrip
tion of the robber. The policeman was at
a disadvantage, as Brown did not know
in which direction the footpad had run.
Brown waa sent to the Central Emer
gency Hospital In the patrol wagon,
where the wound in his scalp was stitched
and dressed. -
Brown said that a well dressed man
about 28 years of age entered the saloon
shortly before midnight and stood at the
bar drinking j for some time. He invited
Brown to have a drink, and they sat at a
table near .the bar and had two or three
drinks together. Sflortly before 3 o'clock
Brown said he would have to close the
saloon, and the stranger rose quickly
from the table, turned out the three lights
at the bar and . turning to Brown said:
"Now, I warn you not to make any noise
and . I want you to hand me over your.
diamonds 1 .'.' v
Brown Jumped to his feet and grappled
with the stranger, who pulled a blackjack
out of his pocket and struck Brown on
the head with it, knocking him down.
The stranger, bent over Brown's prostrate
form and with his teeth bit off the dia
mdhd from. his shirt front, leaving the
screw in the shirt. The diamond was val
ued at $50. The stranger then ran out of
the saloon. Brown staggered to his feet
and blew the whistle.
A daring robbery was committed at the
saloon of Oscar Brown, 1695 Geary street,
early yesterday morning, the victim being
the proprietor. A few minutes before 3
o'clock Policeman J. J. Farrell's attention
was attracted by the blowing of a police
whistle. He hurried in the direction of
the whistle and found Brown standing on
the sidewalk, bleeding from a cut in his
scalp.

Smith urges all taxpayers to bring their
old bills with them when applying for the
new, as it will facilitate the work. Tax
payers may receive their bills by mail
by simply making a request of Tax Col
lector Smith to that effect. Smith will be
present to supervise personally the collec
tion of the taxes and to see that the tax
payers are courteously treated.
To-morrow the work of making out the
excess bills for those that have already
paid their personal property taxes will
commence. These bills will be sent by
maH. The taxes were collected on the old
rate of $1,608. on every $100 assessed valua
tion, but the raise of 30 per cent made by
the State Board of Equalization will ne
cessitate the collection from those that
have paid of about 21 cents additional on
every $100 valuation.
. Owing to the litigation In the Supreme
Court required to establish the legality of
the tax rate of 11.076 adopted last June,
Auditor Baehr was unable to place the
assessment books In the hands of Tax
Collector Smith on the second Monday in
â¢October, when the taxes became due and
payable. The delay will consequently give
but twenty-three working days, or until
November 30, for property-holders to set
tle their obligations -with the municipality,
as two. holidays-selection day and Thanks
giving dayâ intervene. On the date named
at 6 o'clock the taxes will become de
linquent.
Tax Collector Smith," realizing that the
time has been cut short, has made ar
rangements to accommodate the tax
payers so that they will not be in the
slightest manner inconvenienced. He will
have eeven windows, at each of which a
cashier and an assistant will be prepared
to receive the taxes; Forty more clerks
will be pressed into service to wait on
the public who desire their tax bills,
which have already been made out in
anticipation of a great rush.
Smith says that the amount of taxes
to bo collected on the first installment
alone approximates more than $3,000,000
and this must be collected in twenty-three
days. So perfect are the arrangements
that have bÂ«en made for the purpose that
Smith anticipates not the slightest dif
ficulty in accomplishing the feat.
Last year the delinquency was' the
smallest in the history of the office and
Smith is desirous of having even a smaller
delinquency than the record-breaker in
order that the taxpayers may avoid end
less trouble through the non-payment of
taxes.
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith, assiBted
by a corps of fifty clerks, will begin the
collection of taxes to-morrow and for the
next month his office will present a busy
appearance.

A committee of sewer cleaners visited
the office of the Board of Public Works
yesterday for the purpose of urging an
increase of their wages from 51 to J3 per
day.
In the absence of the Commissioners the
committee Informed Secretary Jortall that
the Board of Supervisors had made a spe
cific appropriation of $6300 In this year's
budget to cover the increase of ten sewer
one foreman and two additional
men. The committee stated that the
Board of Works had not complied with
the budget as adopted by the Supervisors,
as the increase had never been allowed
and the two extra men had not been ap
pointed.
Jortall explained that the increase had
never been ordered by the Board of Works
because its appropriation for material and
supplies had been cut by $14,000.
The committee reUred apparently not
{satisfied with the explanation, , although
Jortall promised to bring the matter to
the attention of his superiors.'
It is probable that if the attention of
the Board of Supervisors Is called to the
matter the Finance Committee will insti
tute an investigation, as It did in the case
of the unauathorized raise of salaries by
the Boards of Works and Health. In the
case of the sewer cleaners the Supervis
ors made a specific appropriation, which
was entirely ignored by the Board of
Works. ,-â¢' , ;*"%-.';

Thousands . of people ; lined the main
thoroughfare 'last night and cheered for
CHEEKS FOR CROCKER.
At Market and Twelfth streets the big
procession countermarched. There tho
scene of enthusiasm continued and the
immense crowd that had gathered shout
ed and cheered as the long line turned
and returned on Market street. People
of all conditions of life were out and wait
ed until after the last of the marching
throng and the transparencies had pass
ed. The laboring classes were much In
evidence. Â¦ Men of toll stepped from the
sidewalk and waved their acclaim.
Each of the candidates received more
than a hearty ovation and. it was clear
that the people were with them. There
was scarcely. a cry for candidates of other
parties, though there are often such In
demonstrations . of this kind: The ap
pearance of Crocker was the signal for
the outburst. The candidate for Mayor
bowed and smiled as he passed along.
Many. rushed near to the side of the car
riage and gave Crocker assurances of
support. He thanked them and seemed
quite pleased. with the greeting.
As the other candidates followed In the
countermarch they received the same en
couragement and in the same hearty man.'
ner. It was a scene that would Instill
hope Into the heart of any party organi
sation and demonstrated more than any
thing else the sentiments of the people on
political questions.
When the procession returned on the
other side of Market street there were
still thousands of people on the sidewalk
and thÂ« cheÂ«ring and waving, was re
newed. Flags waved from the sidewalk;
horns tooted - and music and the roll of
drums increased. the tumult. The glare
of the red fire fell â¢ on a crowd â¢ with
hands and hats in air.
The reception tendered Henry Lynch,
Republican candidate for Sheriff, amount
ed to an ovation. Many in the great
crowd had every reason to cheer Lynch
and to shout out, "We are for you, Hen
ry," for few if any have done as much
for the toilers of this city as has the Re
publican candidate for Sheriff. Great,
also, was the reception given Edward
Aigeltinger, candidate for Supervisor. His
record as a business man and as an em
ployer is known to hundreds of voters
and the mere appearance of the banners
bearing his name brought forth long,
loud and hearty cheers.

ing the banners of Henry H. "Lynch, the
Republican candidate for Sheriff. Many
of the wagons were filled with men carry
ing megaphones, and their cry was, "Vote

can ticket."
This part of the parade was brilliant
with red fire burning in dozens ] of the
wagons. - â¢
Marshal D. B. Faktor led the sixth di
vision, aided by George Dryden, Carl
Muller and Frank Browell. The end of
the division consisted of hundreds of men
carrying transparencies bearing the
legend, "Lynch Is Our Friend!" "Lynch"
Is the Workingman'ss Friend!"
BAHRS GETS AN OVATION.
The seventh division consisted of Judge
Bahrs, candidate on the Republican ticket
for Assessor, and a host of his friends,
calling themselves the Bahrs Volunteers.
Judge Bahrs was kept busy responding to
the applause of the crowds and he won a
host of friends by his pleasant greetings.
The Bahrs Volunteers carried transpar
encies with the motto, "His Record as a
Judge Is a Pledge of His Future Work!"
and the sentiment seemed to meet the ap
proval of thousands, judging by the
thouts that greeted the popular candidate
for Assessor.
The last division of the parade was com
posed of the members of the Golden Gate
Park and Driving Association, who turned
out solid for Edward H. Aigeltinger. Re
publican candidate for Supervisor. The
handsome driving buggies, sulkeys and
carriages were lavishly decorated with
the banners of Aigeltinger and horses and
drivers were bedecked with small flags.
The Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-sixth District clubs brought up the
rear of the rroeession.
Passing a given point the parade occu
pied a few minutes less than one hour and
the marchers grew more enthusiastic the
further they walked.
From the start to the finish Henry J.
Crocker and the various candidates on the
Republican ticket were given an ovation
such as It is the lot of few men to re
ceive.
On all eldes there was but one sentiment
expressed by the many thousands who
witnessed the parade and that sentiment
was that llcnry J. Crocker will be vic
toriously elected for Mayor on Tuesday
next.
"Crocker, Crocker, Crocker! Three
cheers for Crocker'." was the cry that
greeted the Republican candidate for
Mayor as the mammoth outpouring of
citizens, headed by a carriage conatlning
the banner bearer of the Republican party
passed the Claus Spreckles building. The
cheers called for were given with a will
and a tiger several times over and they
were repeated again and again after
Crocker had risen to his feet, doffed his
hat, bowed his acknowledgments and In a
short speech assured the gathered thou
sands that his election meant clean, hon
est government and a careful and Judi
cious handling of the sums to bo raised for
the greater San Francisco. Never in the
history of political campaigns in this city
has a reception been tendered to any can
didate such as was given Crocker. Like
one voice rose the vocal demonstrations
of those assembled at this point. Its vol
ume was such that it instilled into the
hearts of the few faint-hearted ones in
the crowd a feeling that defeat was im
possible and caused them to cheer like
mad for Crocker. It was Infectious also,
that good old Republican yell, and be
fore Its last echo had died away new
voices, imbued with the spirit of victory,
took it up and once again started the
cry "Crocker. Crocker, Crocker! Three
cheers for Crocker!"
So dense was the crowd in front of the
Claus Spreckela building that it was with
great difficulty that the carriage contain
ing the Republican candidate for Mayor
was able to make a few feet headway.
Ihe cordon of mounted police ; that pro
ceded the carriage tried its best to kmp
the way clear, but the admiring crowd
would not be denied. Time after time it
thronged to the side of the carriage, anx
ious to cheer its choice for Mayor and to
assure him that he was the selection of
those who had at heart the interests of
the city. It was a sight good to behold,

Crocker's Success
Will Float the
Bonds.
Present Attitude
of Real Estate
Dpalpr^ â¢
THERE is one aspect of the Mayor's
right that workingmen should con
sider very seriously, and that iÂ»
the sale of the bonds. The bankers,
of the State have declared that if SchmJti
is elected they will not purchase a dol
lar's worth of the bonds. Men with money
know that if Ruef gets control of the mu
nicipal government it will be unsafe to
invest their money.
Nothing is so timid as capital. Is it rea
sonable to suppose that with the grafting
and corrupt men whom Ruef will put In
the Commissions the bankers are going
to invest nearly $18,000,000 in the munici
pality? The bonds will be a drug on the
market. If Crocker is elected they will
find a ready sale; a sale means that all
that immense sum of money will be ex
pended in building the achoolhouses. the
library, the hospital and the sewers. This
will mean the employment : of thousands
of carpenters, painters, metal workers,
bricklayers, stone masons and unskilled
laborers of every kind.
Already work is becoming slack, and
money is tighter than it has been for four
or five years. To keep the great body of
workingmen employed- some great public
undertakings are absolutely necessary.
Laboring men should consider this care
fully. If Schmitz is elected capital will
not touch the- bonds. If Crocker is elect
ed the $13,000,000 will be expended in great
public Improvements and there will be
work for everybody.
It is also a well-known fact that the
Incumbency of Mayor Schmitz during the
last two years has kept millions of pri
vate capital out ef San Francisco. The
workingmen have not felt this because
times were good and there was plenty of
employment. But the tide has turned.
Times are going to be harder all over the
Union.
San Francisco can escape only if her
municipal government commands the con
fidence of men of money. A prominent
real estate dealer has a client who is only
awaiting the result of the election to In
vest over $1,000,000 in a large enterprise
here. Do the labor unions want Schmitz
more than they want steady employment?
AIGELTINGER LEGION.
bounds and swept him to certain victory.
The signals of victory are flying all
along the Republican line. The Important
duties now at hand are to bring the reg
istered Republicans to the polls and to
adopt an effective system of watching
the count. The new ballot law goes Into
practical effect next Tuesday and Re
publican voters should guard against
placing an X anywhere outside of the
Republican column. Vote the straight
ticket next Tuesday.
Ruef has fired the last round of ammu
nition In his arsenal. He found a news
paper willing to publish his list of rene
gades and his following is, not sufficient
to create any apprehension In the Repub
lican camp. Ruef is behind Schmitz.
Martin Kelly is behind Lane. The people
who despise bosses and have no respect
for boss-ridden candidates are for Henry
J. Crocker.
BECEIVED BY FRIENDS.
Driving Association's Parade Out' of
Regard for the Nominee.
The Golden Gate and the San Francisco
driving associations turned out in large
numbers for Supervisor Edward H. Algel*
tinger last night. It was one of the finest
and most extensive features of the pa
geant and was a good-sized parade by
itself. The driving clubs gave the candi
date for Supervisor a great testimonial of
their regard for him, and every vehicle
was decorated and covered with banners.
Algeltinger's efforts for good roads and
his past excellent record are appreciated
to the extent that there is scarcely a
member of either association that Is not
working for his election.
The Aigeltinger division of the parade
formed at the corner of Golden Gate and
Van Ness avenues. Before 8 o'clock moro
than fifty vehicles had collected, and the
signal to start was given. I. B. Dalzir!
was marshal and J. McTigue and F. W.
Thompson acted as aids. Then came three
buglers from the United States army.
Two large transparencies followed, In
which were displayed colored lights. One
of the transparencies announced that the
two associations were shoulder to shoul
der for the present Supervisor.
After the transparencies the members
of the associations rode in single file
First came a number of sulkies and road
carts, then a line of buggies, after which
were several four-in-hands drawn by
plumed horses. Then heavy carryalls and
transparencies loaded down with " men.
each carrying a tin horn or. a megaphone
drew up at the rear Â«f the driving asso
ciations' section. The teamsters were
represented by several large decorated
wagons, crowded with humanity and
glowing with red fire. Several other trades
had vehicles of some sort Â¦ in line and
contributed to the success of . the turn
out. Along the line. of. march the Super
visor's popularity -was attested by ths
applause which greeted the appearance
of his banners. . Â¦â¢_-. :
The action of the- driving associations
in appearing In last night's parade was
voluntary and done to manifest their con
sideration for what the candidate had
done for them since his entry into
office. Aigeltlnger stood for good govern
ment and good roads. It was due to him
that many of the pavements have been
repaired, but the good work is by no
means ended yet and will be continued
during the next term, for which he will
be surely elected to serve.

CROCKER'S GOOD SENSE.
In view ot the fact that the incoming
administration will have the expenditure
of a number of million dollars supplied by
the taxpayers for the purpose of acquir
ing a new sewer system, modern school
houses, a City and County Hospital and
the like, it would be to the credit of the
city could Crocker be elected, that, he
might bring to the disbursement of these
vast sums the good sense for which he
has long been noted in business circles.
One can never tell, though, how far com
mon sense or how far sentiment or preju
dice will prevail In a municipal election.â

to build for himself an easy, place' to fall

would speak at twenty-flve places. He re

"When the carriage was opposite the
Claus Spreckels building the Rough Rid
ers lined up and were saluted by Mr.
Crocker. The latter rose in his carriage
and thanked them for their splendid
showing and effort in his behalf. Mr.
Crocker called for three cheers for Grand
Marshal Hurlbut, and they were given
with a will. The procession proceeded
down to the Palace Hotel. Mr. Crocker
stepped out of the vehicle in the entrance
of the hotel and the members of the
Union League and Dirigo clubs gathered
around him, and he tnanked them for
their fine showing. He told them he ap
preciated their splendid work and would
always remember their kindness. He as
sured the members that a Republican vic
tory was certain next Tuesday. Â»
"Ladies and Gentlemen: Mr. Crocker
will speak Immediately after me, but I
want to address you for a minute. I
want to say that during this entire cam
paign I have been making addresses two
and three times a night south of Market
street and I want to tell you that I have
rot "been interrupted In my speeches.
Never in the history of San Francisco
has there been such enthusiasm for the
Republican party and for the next Mayor,
Henry J. Crocker (cheers) as there has
been south of Market street. (Applause.)
Never before in the history of San Fran
cisco have such big Republican meetings
been held. Out at Bernal He ghts and in
the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth As
sembly Districts, the crowds have been
big^ and enthusiastic. This all points to
v ctory for the Republican ticket and I
assure you Henry J. Crocker will be the
next Mayor of San Francisco." (Great
aP When e "!he cheering had subsided Mr
rrocker arose and was greeted with
cheeS ! When the enthusiasm had quieted
down he spoke as follows:
"The Republican party has honored me
very greatly by making me its nominee
for Mayor. I have pledged myself to the
people No one else has had any pledges
from me. If I am elected Mayor of this
city I will give you a good* clean, honest
administration and' I will try to do all I
can for the good of San Francisco. I will
devote my attention to the bond issue. I
will see that the money voted by the peo
ple of San Francisco is honestly expend
ed and the worklngmen are given their
share of the expenditure of the money,
and I am sure they will In return give
their labor to the betterment and improve
ment of the city. New sewera, parks and
public schools will tend to make our city
one of the greatest in the world. 1 thank
you." (Cheers.)
The carriage drove on and another siop
was made at the corner of Market and
Fourth Btreets. Mr. Van der Nalllen
spoke and Mr. Crocker followed. The
standard bearer was given another fine
reception, and he spoke as follows:
"I Btand for good government. I stand
for government for the people without
regard to class, and I promise you that
if I am elected I will give you a clean
administration."
"Mr. Eagan worked for years on the
water front, surrounded by union men of
old and established unions, employed by
those business men that are now backing
Mr. Crocker, and I challenge Mr. Eagan
to deny the fact that those worklngmen
that he worked with for years, in good
times and bad times, before elections and
after elections, received from those busi
ness men the highest wages, the shortest
hours, the fairest play and best treat
ment of any mechanics of their class in
the world. And deny if you dare that
they have always, been and are now the
finest men you ever saw in your life;
and that they always were and are now
allowed every privilege mat it Is possible
to allow worklngmen.
"Mr. Eagan himself was not a union
man at that time for the reason that the
class of work that he worked at and the
men of his class, who were very few,
had no union; but they were employed
by those same business men and received
the same treatment as the mechanics
referred to above. When the disturbances
that led to the formation of the Union
Labor party were going on Mr. Eagan
thought he saw a good opening through
which to elevate himself from a Buckley
Lamb into a great Labor Union advocate,
and forthwith his class were rounded up
ana formed into a union. ' They had great
difficulty In finding a name for their union
and I doubt very much if they have
found one yet." They called themselves

EMINENT leaders in the cause of organized labor are appealing

. and Ruef. The Call herewith publishes a contribution from O.
A. T veitRioe, who will vote for Mr. Crocker next Tuesday and then leave â¢
for Boston, where he will attend the twenty-third annual convention of
the American Federation of Labor, which convenes in Faneuil Hall,
â¢ November 9: .
Editor Call: This is a time for sober thought and wise action.
Brush aside all prejudice and passion and let us act as men, loyal to
ourselves and our home city. Our action next Tuesday will largely de
termine the progress of San Francisco and our own future welfare.
During the last year building contracts have fallen off five million
dollars frcm what was reasonably expected at the first of the year. To
day there are fifteen millions' worth of contracts awaiting the result of
.the election next Tuesday. These are facts and figures that can be
.proven by investigation at the various architects' offices in this city.
Wlfat is the reason? Did you ever stop to think?
If you have not, it is certainly high time that you should do so.
We are primarily interested in th'is question, because it means bread and
butter to us.
Do you know that capital is keeping shy of San Francisco? Did
. you ever stop to think that only one large contract has been let during
the last year â the Merchants' Exchange? Why is it that the tall build
ings of steel, stone, brick and concrete are not being erected? There
is but one answer. Capitalists do not consider San Francisco a safe
rJace for investment at the present time.
; Why?
Because we have been cursed during the last two years with a Mayor
who has served as a "scare-crow" to all investors.
The prattling parasite who preaches class hatred and scares away
investors from this great and glorious city is a public enemy. An .in
dividual, whether his name be Schmitz or Ruef, who by his official acts
and personal ambition for private gain, drives capital away from San
Francisco, steals our chances of employment.
. â¢ The men who compose the building industry of San Francisco have
. more at stake in the election next Tuesday, directly, than perhaps any
other class of our people.
It is capital that pa3'S for the labor, the material and the skill re
quired for the construction of large structures and well-finished dwell
ings; and this class of buildings are the ones that furnish steady employ
; merit. Keep the "scare-crow" at the head of our municipal government
.and the building mechanics will have a chance to while away their long
hours on Bush and Montgomery streets.
Are you- desirous of a repetition of the sad and trying days in the
. early nineties? Although a decade has passed, the serious struggles of i
that gloomy period are still fresh in your minds.
If you are desirous of progress and prosperity, cast your .vote next
Tuesday for Henry J. Crocker for Mayor.
I Have no' other interests in this election than the interests of the
thousands of mechanics and laborers whom I have served for years.
Â¦ .- Brothers, this is a time for cool and deliberate judgment.
â¢ You are union men. You ask for the union label when you pur
". chase your wearing apparel, your printing and your cigars. You are
willing to pay the price, but you expect to receive in return for your
" -money an article of honest merits. You despise a counterfeit label. You
condemn the use of the union label when it is placed on a counterfeit
â¢article, or '3 non-union made piece of gqpds. You condemn the mean
â¢wretch who carries a card and acts the part of a traitor. That is ex
actly what Schmitz has been doing in his official capacity for the last
. two yearsâ he has been acting the traitor. His administration reeks
" with scandal. Lnion men and their friends have been repeatedly turned
: down while pothouse politicians and Abe Ruef have prospered. Reraem- 7
' ber that during Schmitz-Ruefs administration honest cement contractors
and journe3-men have been arrested and dragged down to the Hall of
Justice for the. sole purpose of being held up. They petitioned, but their
-petitions were scorned. They argued, but their arguments were ridi
culed.- They were informed that they must "go to Ruef." The fact is
â¢that Ruef h2s been Mayor and Schmitz the deputy. Arc we to have two
years more of this Schmitz-Ruef regime? If so. then God help
. the working people of San Francisco, because it is beyond the power of
â¢unionism to 'help them.
' Labor- and capital are both necessary factors in the advancement of
civilization, but well trained, sober intelligence is the most prompt factor
in the onward march of mankind.
- â¢ A vote" for Henry J. Crocker for Mayor is a vote for your home and
.'family. .
A vote for Schmitz is a vote for Ruef and all the evils, corruption
_ arid vices known to history.
L?t us use our talentsâ God's giftsâ wisely and well, and posterity

pen! stood at our post of duty, valiant and strong, and we will lay a

was more like a triumphant procession.

pair and. with uplifted hat. cried. "Three
Cheers for the baby." The mother was
60 tickled that she immediately kissed the
precious youngster and whispered in his
ear that the next chief executive of San
Francisco would be Henry J. Crocker.
. Shortly after 8 o'clock the procession
started from the rooms of the Union
League Club in the Palace Hotel. Cap

the ticket.
As Mr. Crocker's carriage swung Into
Market street the cheering began, and it
cpread like wildfire all along ' the line.
In passing up the street Mr. Crocker rec-
ognJzed Gavin McNab, the Democratic
boss who put Franklin K. Lane up to be
sacrificed next Tuesday, and Gavin took
off his hat to the next Mayor. Mr. Crocker
returned the salute.
Red fire was burned in front of The
Call and Chronicle. Hundreds of people
stood in front of the big buildings and
yelled lustily for Mr. CrocKer.
The email boy grew very familiar by
yelling. "Hello. Henry." and "Three
cheers for Hen," and the candidate for
Mayor took it all good naturedly. There
were cries from Schmitz sympathizers and
Mr. Crocker would wave his hand and
smile. When one enthusiast asked,
"What's the matter with Schm'tz?" Mr!
Crocker came back promptly with the
answer. "He's all right; he's a friend of
mine."
The air was filled with shouts from the
Dirigo Club. The club turned out more
than one hundred members, who were
armed with megaphones, and they made
the welkin ring with their famous war
whoop:
Wah, whoo, waht
â¢Wah, whoo, wah!
Dirigo, Dirigo,
Wah. whoo, wah !
. A small boy threw a bunch of Schmitz
cards into the carriage and Mr. Crocker
surprised everybody by laughingly hold
ing one of the cards in his hand, and
every time some Schmltz supporter
showed bad taste in yelling for his man
Mr. Crocker would hold up the card: and
announce that "He was all right. But
come out to the City Hall and meet me."
"Can we get In?" yelled a bystander.
"You bet you can," replied Mr. Crocker,
"and you won't have to see any one else
first."
This caustic allusion to Ruef raised a
laugh in the crowd and the Schmltz man
fell back crestfallen.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell, who has been be
fore the public as candidate for Mayor
on more occasions than one, stood in the
middle of the street, and when Mr. Crock
er passed he ran out and raised his silk
hat. disclosing his gray hairs, yelling,
"Three cheers for Henry J. Crocker."
This was a strong indication that Mr.
Crocker was a popular candidate. Dr.
O'Donnell's cry was taken up by hundreds
of others and the air vibrated with the
enthusiastic shouts.
As the carriage passed the Phelan build-
Ing Mr. Crocker glanced. up at one of the
windows and as he saw the familiar faces
of his wife and children, a happy smile

Club turned out in large numbers to help
Algeltlnger win his fight for Supervisor.
Some of the fastest horses that appear
In the park were driven by their owners.
Mr. Aigeltlnger's banners were conspicu

Bouquets were thrown into. his. vehicle
by fair admirers of Mr. Crocker. The
fragrant flowers were turned over to Col

ard Jbearer. Mr. Crocker thanked the la
dies who honored him. Mr. Crocker
proved himself a winner â¢ with the fair
sex.' His handsome face won many cheers
from the ladles and, this is looked upon
as a good sign by the managers : of the
campaign. - The latter argue that- the fair
ones will urge their husbands, fathers,
brothers and sweethearts to support him.
' : AtFifth arid Market streets Mrj Crock
er made his first speech. " The procession
was halted and hundreds of people crowd

len was .the Â¦ first one to,' address .,the
crowd. â¢ . â¢â¢; * . --r : '
He raised -tyÂ« vai C e and in ringing tones,
said:
PH. McCARTHY, president of the Building Trades Council, has nailed as absolutely false the
# statement of C. M. Haybl, published in a morning paper, to the effect that he (Haybl) never
signed the membership roll of the Henry J. Crocker Workingmen's League; knew not the
purposes of the league and had no hand in its formation. In addition to the word of Mr. McCarthy,
which is good, to the effect that Haybl's statement is false, The Call publishes herewith a reproduc
tion of Haybl's signature, among the first on the roll of the Henry J. Crocker Workingmen's
League. To further put the brand of falsehood upon Haybl's statement The Call herewith publishes
an affidavit, executed by Bert E. Powers, a member of Felt and Composition Roofers' Union and
member and business agent of Building Material Team Drivers' Union, which*- proves that Haybl,
who is a metal polisher, not only signed the roll of membership of the Henry J. Crocker Working
men's League, but was an active worker in the formation of the league organized to further the in
terests of the Republican candidate for Mayor.
Mr. McCarthy's signed statement, branding Haybl's statement as false, follows:
Editor Call â Sir: The statement published in a morning paper signed by C. M. Haybl is a
political campaign lie from beginning to end, and carries no wtight with honest and sincere
union men. '
Mr. Haybl's enthusiasm, first in one causa and then in another, has exaggerated his stupidity.
My position with reference to the Building Trades Council is plainly set forth in my statement, re
ferred to. If Mr. Haybl had a clear understanding of the English language and any regard for the
truth he would not have expressed himself as he lias. P. H. McCARTHY.
The affidavit made by Bert E. Powers, corroborating Mr. McCarthy and proving Haybl the
disseminator of. falsehood, follows:
State of California, \ Â¦Â» Â¦
City and County of San Francisco. J . ' ,
B. E. Powers first being duly sworn deposes and says: That he is a resident of the City and
County of San Francisco, State of California, a member of Felt and Composition Roofers' Union
and Building Material Team Drivers' Union and the business agent of the latter organization.
That on or about the igthinst. deponent became interested in the formation of the Henry J.
Crocker Workingmen's League. j^:\
That on or about said time C. Ml Haybl not only signed said list of membership in said
league and knew the purposes of the league, but voluntarily assisted in the formation of the Henry J.
Crocker Workingmen's League by circulating one of said lists for signatures.

Two days ago Mrs. Callahan was sent
to St. Joseph's Hospital for treatment.
She told of the operation and her condi
tion was very serious. Dr. William J.
Hawkins at once secured a statement
from the woman in the presence of two
other physicians connected with the in
stitution. Mrs. Callahan said she realized
she was about to die and freely told of
the occasion of her illness. She says she
visited Mrs. Fuhiig at 1445 Ellis street on
Friday, October 11. The sum of $7 60 was
paid and the operation performed. She
called at the Ellis street address on three
other occasions, and, her condition be
coming alarming, solicited treatment of
Dr. Drossel. The last named advised her
to go immediately to the hospital, which
she did. Everything possible was done
to save her life, but she expired yester
day.
Dr. Hawkins notified Coroner Leland
and the body was moved to the morgue.
Detectives Cody and Anthony were de
tailed at once on the case and arrested
Mrs. Fuhrig at her home. ; When behind
the bars in the city prison the accused
woman denied her guilt and professed not
to know Mrs. Callahan, but the dying
woman's statement will weigh heavily
against her. Mrs. Fuhrig was arrested
on December 10, 1S98; December 14, 1898,
and on January 5, 1S99, in connection with
similar cases. She was once convicted of
murder, but escaped on a technicality of
the law. She is of German descent, about
47 years of age. Her last alleged victim Is
an Austrian, 20 years of age, and was
wedded to Callahan but a short time ago.
Mrs. Dora Fuhrig is again in the tolls
of the law and will probably be charged
with having caused the death of Mrs.
Annie Callahan, the young wife of Henry
T. Callahan, a grocer at 817 Montgomery
avenue. In a dying statement Mrs. Cal
lahan charges the notorious midwife with
having performed the fatal criminal op
eration.

STOCKTON, Oct. 31.-With the sanction
of the Attorney General, District Attor
ney Norton of San Joaquin County filed
complaints in two suits to oust the two
Justices and two Constables of O'Neil
Township, elected at the last election.
The contention of the District Attorney
is that under the State law calling for
two Justices and two Constables in town
ships having 6000 or more in population,
these men have been illegally elected, the
last previous census before election show-'
ing less than 5000 population.
The matter is further complicated by
the fact that the old officials claim to be
still entitled to hold their offices, and by
the fact that in the event the court de
clares one Justice and one Constable
should have been elected there will be
some difficulty in determining which Is
entitled to serve. The salaries of both
old and new officials are tied up and the
result of the suit will be awaited with "in
terest, both here and in other parts of
the State.
Among the passengers were a numbe,
of missionaries and their families. Dr
James E. Gardner, late fleet surgeon t
the Asiatic squadron, returned on tl.4
America. He has completed his foreign
service and has come home to be as
signed to other duty. Dr. "Gardner says
tho Japanese masses are very bitter to
ward Russia and would willingly go to
war. They are good fighters and Intense
ly patriotic, but the navy surgeon thinks
that In the long run the Russians would
overwhelm them. Dr. H. A. Stansfleld
of the marine hospital service, who has
been quarantine officer at Merivales, re
turned on the liner.

The Japanese liner America Maru, Cap

day from the Orient, passed through some
terrific weather between Hongkong and
Honolulu. For two days the steamship
was compelled to slow down and even
then the seas stirred up by a lusty north
easter bombarded her sides and, at fre
quent intervals, swept her decks. No se
rious damage was done, however, nobody
was hurt and the fine weather encoun
tered from Honolulu to this port more
than compensated for the unpleasantness
of the earlier part of the voyage.

The classification of theatrical material

" Versa; the word drama is misapplied and
ill the musical line the term "comic
"opera" covers everything (frequently a
multitude of sins and some crimes) from
a hodge-podge of specialties up. All this
niisnonicnclature makfea it difficult for the
publid to know from the announcements

Printers are a cause of excessive annoy
ance Just now to Miss Jessie Millward,
because they insist upon rechristening tlie
name of the new play In which she is
now starring. This comedy was originally
called "A Clean Slate" by its author, R.
C. Carton, but in the course of Miss Mill
ward's tour through several Canadian
cities, the play has been renamed by the
printers several times. In Ottawa, when
Miss Millward's business manager was
banded the proofs of the programme- in
order to correct any possible errors, he
found that Miss Millward was advertised
to appear in "A Clean Shave." This waa
speedily corrected, but in the same town
one of the newspapers printed the adver
tisement to read "A Clean Slave." In
Kingston, the printers made the adver
tisements announce that Miss Jessie Mill
ward would appear there in "A Clean
Skate." Inasmuch as Miss Millward
never touches anything stronger than
claret, this title was especially inconsid
erate. Now, although the printers are
Civen their copies of the ads and the pro
grammtfc in printed form, with the title
clearly designated as "A Clean Slate,"
Miss Millward invariably picks up the
newspapers with fear and trepidation
anxious less she find herself billed to ap
pear in some absurdly named . play not
at all suggestive of the dainty and refined
society comedy that "A Clean Slate"
really is.

he is now making the success of his life
in "The Office Boy." As a boy he was
known as "Daggy" Daniels. It was the
fashion in those days to wear skin-tight
trousers, double breasted vests and short
Jackets with a tremendous amount of
shoulder padding. Daniels was an ex

and "went the limit" of the prevailing
Btyle. It was alleged by his confreres
that his trousers were so tight that he
had to grease his legs to get them on.

In the present year there has been no
anticipation of interest, still the surplus
Is almost exhausted. September's falling
off in customs came largely in salt and
sugar. It is believed that these schedules
for October will also show a marked de
crease.
Expenses and revenues have run a neck
and neck race during the four months of
the present fiscal year and the Govern
ment officials are uneasy concerning the
poor showing made. The decrease in the
revenues has been wholly in the customs.
Increase in %xpendltures has occurred in
many of the departments. The appropria

exposition is responsible for part of the
increase.

CARL MUGKE'S FAMOUS PICTURE, "THE BETROTHAL."
THE BETROTHAL.
Sunday Call Art Supplement
\
A great artist once said that the . most successful
genre pictures have , always for their subject's some-
thing relating to love , or war. It is only natural that . '
love, which every living being is destined to experience,
should furnish subjects which attract, and the only as-
pect of the contrasting emotion of hate which is pot
despicable is war, and even that is ennobled only by a
love of country or a love of right.
Carl Mucke's picture, "The Betrothal," depicts the
action which is a formal acknowledgment of the exist-
ence of love, but at the same time the attitude of the
figures of the young man and woman, their expression
and their regard tell more than actions of srivinsr and
accepting the betrothal ring, which- is but a symbol.
The fact that the principal roles in the scene are
playe'd by a humble Dutch fisherman and his dulcinea
only serves to strength the sentiment of the picture be-
cause the sentiment of love is generally conceded to
have a stronger hold on the simple minds of the lowly
than upon minds distracted by multiplicity of consid-
erations which beset people in higher walks of life.

Multnomah tried three times to break
through Berkeley's line and were finally
forced to kick. From that time on Berke

Overall then made a great punt, but
again an offside play forced the ball back
in Berkeley's field. Once more did Overall
kick and this time the ball was stopped
on Multnomah's 25-yard line.
Overall th'en punted to the 20-yard line,
from which he kicked the goal, making
the score stand California 6, Multnomah 0.
Multnomah kicked off to California's
10-yard line and the ball was kept on. the
go until Overall was tackled In the center
of tha field. '
Multnomah kicked off to Berkeley's 25
yard line, Where the ball was fumbled
and was dropped on by Multnomah. The
visitors attempted to get around Califor
nia's right end, but in doing so dropped
the ball, which was recovered by Califor

MULTNOMAH put up a gune
fight on the University of Cali
fornia gridiron yesterday after
noon, but the splendid team work
and strong runners behind the California
line forced the visitors to leave the cam
pus without having scored a point. Score:
Berkeley, 11; Multnomah, 0.
It was a gala day for the University of
California and the bleachers were crowd
ed with noisy rooters and pretty co-eds
who tried to be noisy but couldn't.
From the time Stow, the Btrong left
guard of the California eleven, kicked off
in the first half to the umpire's whistle
at the close of the game, it was evident
the visitors were outclassed.
There were no spectacular runs, nor did
any one player distinguish himself with
grand stand playing. Throughout the
game it was one continual series of center
rushes and end runs for gains of from
five to ten yards each.
As the umpire called game Stow kicked
oft to Multnomah's, five-yard line, where
the ball was stopped before the runner
had fairly got under way.
Multnomah' kicked on the first down,
and Mini ran the ball to the center of the
field. California commenced battering
Multnomah's line, and after a number of
center rushes had the* ball on their op
ponents' 25-yard line. Kittrelle, playing
right half on the varsity team, made ', a

when Kittrell made an end run to Mult
nomah'a 20-yard line.
At the opening of the second half,
after Multnomah had kicked off to Berke
ley's 10-yard mark. Mini made the only
run of the day to the center of the field.
Berkeley changed her tactics somewhat
and made several good end runs.
MINI IS INJURED.
At the opening of the half Mini, who
had played left half for Berkeley, was
injured and substituted by Muther, who
made the second touchdown.
Overall tried hard to kick the goal, but
/the ball struck the side post and glanced
off, malting the score 11-0 In Berkeley's
favor.
After the second score there were but
five minutes in which to play, and during
that time the ball passed from one side
to the other several times. California
made a- great ! effort to score another
touchdown, but when time was called

FBESHMEN ABE PUT IN.
Stanford commenced again with pretty
much all of the freshmen champions. The
university team should have had things
all its own way, but after the ball had
been advanced for thirty or forty yards
Relance would come into the possession
of the pigskin through some error of its
opponents. Stanford Â¦ was held for downs
or forced to kick but four times during
the same..
Sprott kicked forty-five yards on the
start to Hamilton of Reliance, who car
ried the ball fifteen yards forward. The
clubmen fumbled and it was Stanford's
ball. Chalmers and Weller were sent
through the line for five ' and ten yard
gains and then the cardinal was set back
for offside playing. Weller made fifteen
yards through Reliance's left guard and
then was sent through again for a touch
down. Sprott missed the goal.
Stanford kicked over and Reliance sent
the pigskin back from the twenty-five
yard line. After two good gains the car
dinal was penalized. A kick was forced
and Sprott sent the ball outside for but
a short gain. Reliance was penalized for
offside playing and when Stanford got the
ball again it went straight through fpr
a touchdown. The goal was easy.
The cardinal might have made another
touchdown in the first half if Bansbach
had not forgotten the rules and tried the
Quarterback run when too close to the
enemy's, goal line. Stanford punted and
Reliance after failing to make any im
pression In the university line returned
the ball. Misinterpretation of signals by
the cardinal backs and penalizations
wasted the few remaining' minutes of the
half.
There . was a considerable amount of
slugging in the last half and both teams
were penalized frequently for holding and
offside play. This la a feature of tha
game to which Stanford needs to-pay par
ticular attention, for the team is losing
yards upon yards in every game by rea
son of penalties.
Steveneorr, Stanford's substitute left
end, 'won his way to favor with the root
ers/by Borne spectacular work. If he can
keep' up the gait he will undoubtedly
make the varsity. He smashed interfer
ence, tackled the opposing backs behind
the line, got down the field ahead of his
fellow linemen on punts and could be
seen In the middle. of every scrimmage.
Brennan, Bansbach and Smith also did
excellent work for the cardinal. Weller
was good for substantial gains yesterday,
but he will never get thtrough California's
line unless he goes at it with his head
d(lwn.
'Stanford is becoming speedier every
day. The main difficulty in yesterday's
game was the failure of the men to com
prehend the signals immediately. Two or
three times the backs went wrong and the
ball was left to take care of itself.
TEAMS ABE PENALIZED.
17 to 0 in a hard, snappy game on
the Stanford campu* The club eleven
was outclassed and succeeded in. making
its distance but once. Reliance, however,
was much weaker than when the teams
met last. >
Stanford made most of Its gains through
the 'Jlne. Two of the three touchdowns
were madÂ© In the first half. The entire
team was changed in the second half and
during th,e game, the cardinal played

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 3L-In an
Intensely exciting and decidedly
sensational football game Harvard
defeated the Carlisle Indians to
dav, 12 to 1L
The closeness of the score was made
possible by one of the most unique tricks
seen on a football field for many years.
Dillon at the start of the second half
received the Harvard kickoft on the five
yard line and then, hiding trie ball under
his Jersey behind his back, ran the length
of the field empty handed for a touch
down.
There is apparently no rule covering
this trick, so the play stood, and the score
was 11 to 0 in favor of the. Indians, as
they had already scored a goal from the
field in the first half.
Harvard then took a brace and pushed
the ball down the field for a touchdown.
The second Harvard score came a few
minutes later and was also made by
straight football. Marshall kicked both
goals.
The Cripples had the pleasure of mak
ing it four in Â». row from tha Senators
yesterday at Recreation Park. The pleas
ure was certainly all their own, for none
of the unfortunates at the park saw any
fun in the weird parade of a motley
throng of Cripples and Senators as they
wended their weary way over the home
plate. When they did finally settle their
differences the score was, Oakland 21,
Sacramento 13.
For two innings it was all right. . Then
the Cripples became possessed of a wild
notion of making as many 'runs as they
could and they promptly started to take
advantage of the easy ones Mr. Fitzgerald
threw over the oyster. It wa3 actually
crlminal for any crowd of ball players to
punl3h the offerings of a pitcher as the
Cripples did those of Fitzgerald. One
player after another would step up. to the
plate and hit the ball to some remote cor
ner of the lot.
-If the leather- did not drop safely the
Senatorial fielder's would err, so It .was
all the same to the Cripples. They go:
their runs anyhow. At last the agony of
that awful Inning came to a close and
the Cripples had amassed nine runs. Nor
did they stop there. In the next. round
Fitzgerald was again bombarded and In
the fourth Mike was forced to chase him
and. substituted a young ironmonger,
named McFarland. He did not fare much
better.
After the Cripples had waljoped his
curves to a fare-ye-well Mike wa* at a
loss for some one to toss 'em up a'hd he
tit last concluded to trot out Truck Egan.
Perhaps Truck could pitch In hl3 palmy
days, but yesterday he was no . terror.
The first thing that happened to him was
a home run by Moskiman. Anyhow, he
was game enough to finish out the con
test. Â¦ , â¢â¢ Â¦ .
In the meantime the Senators did fairly
well with the curves of Cooper and dur
ing eight Innings they managed to slap
the lefthander for six runs. In the ninth
they overdid themselves. Every one of
them seemed to have It in for the south
paw and one after the other would take
a ride on the ball, till seven tallies were
over the rubber. Happily it ended there
and the fans were at last allowed to go

PRINCETON" DEFEATS CORNELL*
Outclasses the LatteT in Every De
partment of the Game.
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 31â Princeton
defeated Cornell to-day by the score of
41 to 0. Princeton gained at will through
the center of the line and seldom failed
to work end runs for substantial gains.
Cornell was helpless when she had the
ball and succeeded in regaining it until
the second down only twice.* During the
entire game Cornell gained her first down
but five times, while Princeton was held
for down twice.
By sending Foulk around the end and
Miller through t the center Princeton
reached the four-yard line and Kafer
scored. Cornell's line weakened and a
second score followed on end run3 by
Kafer and center plunges by Cooney and
Miller. Dewitt made futile efforts to kick
goal, but after Burke's run of forty-two
yards he scored a field goal from the
twenty-seven yard line.
Although Princeton used a substitute
team in the second half, the task was
still easier. Kafer and Cooney scored In.
succession. Dewitt dropped a kick from
the twenty-seven-yard line. Foulk ran
forty-seven yards for a touchdown. Time
was called with the ball in Cornell's pos
session in the middle of the field.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31.â The Univer
sity of Pennsylvania defeated Bucknell
to-day, 47 to 6. Bucknell's touchdown was
made a few minutes before the close of
the game, after Pennsylvania had put In
seven substitutes.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Oct. 81.â On a
muddy field here this afternon the Haskell
Indians defeated the Missouri University
by a score of 12 to 0.
MADISON. Wis., Oct. 31.â Wisconsin's
chances for championship honors on the
gridiron evaporated this afternoon. Un
able to overcome the ble gains made by
the constant punting of Eckersall, Wis
consin was defeated by Chicago 15 to 6.
Time and time again when Chicago
seemed about to give way before the
heavy defensive work of Wisconsin,
Eckersall went back and sent the pigskin
sklmmering way down the field toward
Wisconsin's line. Time and again he
tried for goals from field and he suc
ceeded often enough to win for his team.
It was through Eckersall's drop kicks
that Chicago scored, none of her points
being grained on touchdowns.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 3Lâ Michigan and
Minnesota, after the hardest fought foot
ball games seen in the west in years, left
the prospective Western championship a
matter for conjecture by finishing with
a tie score, 6 to 6. FUUy 30,000 enthusias
tic) spectators witnessed the struggle on
Northrop field this afternoon. The scor
ing was done in the second half, and Min
nesota in crossing the goal line had a
struggle, not only against their opponents,
but against the call of time. The game
was all but lost when. Bekeman. a sub
stitute, was pushed over the Michigan
line and the score stood Michigan 6, Min
nesota 6. When the goal was kicked time
was called.

Experience is a dear teacher, as those who pin their /tthiZfl >Â§ lr

ful poison combined with Potash, is the treatment gen- /Â§[ ]T^r w^i
erally prescribed for Contagious Blood Poison, but failure /9f /> \ W
and disappointment is the invariable result. These min- jr\^/J^W \t
erals drive in the sores and eruptions, and apparently the fi^/Â£!yJiL >
disease is gone and the patient believes the. cnre penna- /-j^T &Â£^&i!$l
nent, but soon learns better when the old symptoms Â«r^N^~~ r^ nj
return almost as soon as the treatment is left off. You
must either keep the system saturated with mercury or endure the tortures â¢
of sore mouth, ulcerated throat and the mortification that one naturally â¢ â¢
feels when the body is covered with disgusting sores, rashes, copper-colored
splotches and other aggravating symptoms of this vile disease.
Mercury and Potash are poor crutches, and their use eventually breaks
down the constitution, ruins the digestion and cause the bones to decay.

with the title of the Inter-Continental

In hand. The ferryboats will take the
trains and their contents on board at
Dover, carry them "across the Channel
and deposit them at Calais. It Is expect
ed that the markets of Newcastle, Edin

i Cockroaches have invaded American
warships to such an extent that it has
been found necessary to institute a war
of extermination. A vigorous campaign
has been arranged with a view to making
the war short, sharp and decisive. An
expert cockroach killer has been engaged
as an auxiliary, who contracts to rid the
navy of the pests at the rate of $50 a
ship. He asked double that amount for
tho work, but the department deemed the
rate excessive and he finally agreed to
undertake the work at the figure stated.
Cockroaches are introduced on board the
warships principally by means of the sub
sistence stores, and they breed rapidly.

The Navy's Cockroaches.
With Miss Bessie Valleau, the clever
little player from Alameda. placed on thÂ«
"Ilftfen" mark, it seemed the others
hadn't a chance. Miss Valleau beat Mlsa
Hotchklss in straight sets in the semi
finals and after this looked a sure win
ner. Miss Hotchkiss was considered a
much better player than Miss Ratcliffe.
The fact is. however, that the best play
er is not always best qualified to give
a big handicap. While Miss Ratcliffe
possibly is not as good a player as Miss
Hotchkiss, she- demonstrated yesterday
that her steady game Is better suited to
handicap conditions than is the game o?
Miss Hotchkiss.
The final match was the closest and
moat exciting of the tournament. Each
had won a set and when Miss Valleau
led at 4-3 she looked to have more than
an even chance. Misa Ratcliffe kept get
ting the balls back and by steady play
ing finally won out, 7-5.
The cleverest match was that between
Miss Ratcliffe and Miss Edwards. Tho
The third of a series of handicap tennis
singles tournaments for the Jackman
cup was played yesterday on the park
courts. For the third time victory went

Edwards, Miss Hotchkiss and Miss Rat
cllffe were the three most neavlly handi
capped players. They played from "fif
teen" back of scratch. Miss Edwards won
the first tournament and Miss Hotchklss
the second.

three finished beyond the money. Little
Margaret showed first to the stretch, but
Roltairo had kept her tlp-tocing, and she
was not there vrhen the pinch came. Troy,

have those seventy-three babies to clothe
and feed, would like to have their friends
âand their friends' friends â call upon
them at their bargain counters and bring
pome pin money with them, for they need
ihe money and they need It badly. The

sumed for clothing, food and school
books, has made great inroads in the
funds. Any who doubt the divinity of its
mission should go out to the home and
look upon those seventy-three little ones,

In offering to make other women

telligent to teach others how to be
beautiful? Ladies, call and see for
yourselves. Hundreds of ladies may
be found during the day treating and

A distressing case of Fibroid Tumor,
\vhich baffled the skill of Boston doctors.
Airs. Hayes, of Boston, Mass., in
the following letter tells how she was
cured, after everything else ' failed, by
Lydia E Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
Mrs. Hayes' First Letter Appealing: to Mrs. Pinkbam for Help:
.. "Dear 3Ies. Pixkham:-t-I have been under Boston doctors' treat-
ment for a long time "without any relief. They tell me I have a fibroid
tumor. I cannot sit down without great pain, and the soreness extends
up my spine. I have bearing-down pains both back and front. My ab-
. domen is swollen, and I have had flowing spells for three years. My ap-
petite is not good. I cannot walk or be on my feet for any length of time.
"The symptoms of Fibroid Tumor given in your little book ac-
Â¦ curately describe my case, so I write to you for advice."â(Signed) Mrs.
E.. F. Hayes, 252 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Boston, Mass. !
Note the result of Mrs. Pinkham's adviceâal-
though she advised Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, to take
tier medicineâwhich she knew would help her â
her letter contained amass of additional instruc-
tions as to treatment, all of which helped to bring
about the happy result.
"Dear Mrs. Ptxkham: âSometime ago I wrote to you describ-
ing my symptoms and asked your advice. You replied, and I followed
all your directions carefully, and to-day I am a well woman.
u The use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound entirely
. expelled the tumor and strengthened my whole system. I can walk
miles now. â¢ *
" Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is worth five dol-
laTs a drop. I advise all women who are afflicted with tumors or
female trouble of any kind to give it a faithful trial."â(Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hates, 252 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Boston, Mass.
Mountains of gold could not purchase such testimony âor take
the place of the health and happiness which Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound brought to Mrs. Hayes.
Such testimony should be accepted by all women as convincing
evidence that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound stands
without a peer as a remedy for all the distressing ills of women; all
ovarian troubles; tumors; inflammations; ulceration, falling and dis-
placements of the womb; backache; irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation. Surely the volume and character of the testimonial let-
ters we are daily printing in the newspapers can leave no room for doubt.
â¢ Mrs. Hayes at her above address will gladly answer any letters
which sick women mav write for fuller information about her illness.
Her gratitude to Mrs. Pinkham and Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is so genuine and heartfelt that she thinks no trouble is too
gieat for her to take in return for her health and happiness.
Truly-is it said that it is Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-

The above incident, which is being quoted far and wide, is an indi
cation of a peculiar state of affairs that will soon be agitating this citv.
It my seem to have no connection whatever with school teaching, but
nevertheless New York is iust now embroiled in a campaign against
married vomen as school teachers. The war of discrimination has spread
arid spread, even to England, and promises to be taken up here in no
less startling manner before long. And yet, "Why should not the school
aeacher marry?" That is a question that even some of our own teachers
bare answered with amazing variance of opinion in the next Sunday
Call. Meanwhile New York declares married women are entirely unfit
for. teaching, and is rigidly enforcing a new rule against them. And
now can you conceive how that street-car incident quoted above has
anything to dp with this remarkable war of polite extermination? Well.
it has. and every woman in the West, whether married or single, will
want to read it next Sunday.
Besides this there are many other things, that not only the women
but the men as well will want to read. Fox instance, the "Art of De

to bring you good cheer while the wave of prosperity is receding.
Then there is the "Etiauette of the Swimming Girl." (You'll watch

gadty and method In the expenditure of
the vast axaounta of money heretofore set

before on account of the amount., of
money to be spent la public Improve

and Judiciously In a manner that will con
duce to the future as well as present wel
fare ef Its citizens and property holders.
For the full benefit of the expenditure to
be realized It wCl hare to be guided by a
man of wide experience and large affairs.
Tne Republican candidate for Mayor Is

SPEAK WELL OF CROCKER.
There's certainly a hot time politically
in San Francisco this week, and it is a
wild goie?s who will be tne next Mayor.
It looks like Crocker. Certainly he ought
to win. Under the charter the Mayor Is
pretty near the whole thing, as the de
partments are conducted by commissions,
and he appoints them. On account of
Ruef. whose puppet he is, Scbmitz Is un
speakable with a large share of the best
people of San Francisco, regardless of
party. The taxpayer, the merchant and
the manufacturer, the wage earner, who
is the fundamental bearer of the whole
burden, is amazed at -the insatiable maw
of Abe Ruef s job chasers. Lane Is hard
ly to be feared. While a good man him
self, though not a strong character, Gavin
McNab is the power behind the Demo
cratic procession, and San Francisco
hasn't Â«ny Use for the uncanny Scot
in public affairs. Nobody has a word
against Crocker, except that he is a rich
man. He enjoys the confidence cf every
one who knows him, and that is a large,
share of the population of San Francisco.
No one questions his integrity or ability.
He is a man of strong character, with
out political henchmen to obey or re
ward; is a trained business man of great
capacity for work and big enterprises,
and would make almost an Ideal Mayor.
If he Is not elected the Republicans will
alone be to blame. They have a ma
jority anyway, and with Schmltz draw
ing twice as many Democrats as he does

were well behaved and listened attentive- }

and that was on Sixth street, near Mar
ket, where they Interrupted Gould's !
speech with catcalls and cheers'" for
Schmltz, but when Lane was .Introduced
the disturbance ceased.
The opening: meeting was held at Ninth
and Mission," where" a small "crowd "iiut^"
rounded the wagon. Lane made a short
speech in whlph he rapped, Abe 'p^uef
soundly and v'ound up with a plea to. all
present to vote for an honest, clean gov
ernment. Tho next stop was made on City
Hall avenue, near Market Btreet. Lane
said In part: ''Fellow Citizens: What a !
difference there is in the campaigns/Look \
at this great street pageant passing by j
us now. with Its great rockets and red :
flre. Think wha^t it costs. We have no
money for any such display.- We are not J

to tell you what is for your best inter- '
eets in the handling of the affairs of this
municipality. Drop your partisanship and
vote for tha men who will give you a
straight, honest "Jurisdiction and rise

The next Btbp was made on Seventh and i
Market streets. Here tbfl Republican pro- i
cession was countermarching In full |
blast, and just as Cannon opened up the I
Lane meeting, the open carriage in which j
Bahrs was standing passed. Cannon drew .
attention to the candidate for the Asses-
I sorshlp by shouting: "There goes the j
King; all hail to Caesar." â¢
He repeated this same remark several
times, each time with more emphasis
than the last Frank Gould followed and,
although he yelled at the top of his
voice, a gang of Schmltz sympathizers
kept hooting and cheering and raising
such a rumpus generally that It came
within an ace of shutting up the meet
ing altogether, but Lane promptly came
to the front and, with a few words. [
quelled the disturbing element. He Bald. [
In part: "I 'have been talking against!
red pepper, against red flre, against
bands of music and against the rumble
of the street cars, and my voice is almost
gone. I want to talk to you, my friend?,
over there on the sidewalk who are
making the unseemly noise and disturb*
ing the meeting. I want to talk to you
man to man, hand to hand, and eye to
eye. and I want you to listen to me. .When
I am through you can have the fldor.
I believe In free, speech and eo do you.
You have your ideas In the campaign and
I have mine. Mark Twain once said:
'It la a difference of" opinion that mÂ»kes
horse races,' and It is also a difference of
opinion that makes politics. Now I want
to say to you that I did not seek this
nomination: it was forced upon me. I am
i fighting for the cause of Democracy In
somuch as It represents the city's wel
fare in the management to try and ef
fect a good clean government. If you
want this kind vote for me, otherwise
vote for the Abe Ruef kind.
"We have no money to spend In this
campaign. I came down here in a van
to talk to you against a glittering cam
paign, a procession of handsome equip
ages, automobiles, under the blase of red
lights and dazzling rockets.
"Walter MacArthur said Friday night
that thÂ«?re was no Union Labor party in
the field, and he Is right. That party has
ceased to exist and In its place the Abe
Ruef jÂ»rty has sprung up."
This ended the session and the other
intended meetings were abandoned as
Lane's voice was showing gTcat signs of
strain from the hard night's work and
the matter of holding a crowd wag dis
couraging.
Lane visited the Central police station
yesterday while the men were .preparing
to go out for duty at 3 o'clock. He went
into the dressing hall and spoke to them
. for a few minutes. He told them that he
was a candidate for the Mayoralty and
had. while City and County Attorney, al
ways looked after their Interests and
would continue to do so. His presence
was aulte unexpected and did not cause
much enthusiasm. After leavinjr the hall
he went upstairs and had a talk with
Captain Martin and concluded by visiting
the officials on duty at the City Prison.

"Special trains are becoming so fre
quent now that they attract little atten
tion except when they make record runs
for long distances, or unless there is some
trouble collecting payment for them,"
said a veteran railroad man. "Ten years
ago, when I was superintendent of one of
the big trunk lines running out of New
York, a special train was an event that
never failed to get mention in the news
papers. Station masters required ample
notice to get one in readiness, and there
was a great deal of fuss making arrange
ments all along the line. At any of the
big railroad terminals in any city now a
man can get a special engine and car to
chase a flyer almost as easy as he can
check his trunk. Only a few. minutes'
notice Is required, and right of way is
obtained for 100 or 200 miles along the line
without noticeably disturbing schedule
runs. A man who has to keep an import
ant business engagement, or â¢ a woman
hurrying to a sick husband, pays $100 or
double that sum for a special with as lit
tle concern as paying a supper check in a
small hotel. We live in a rapid and ex
travagant age, and grow accustomed to
such things."â Railroad Gazette.

first week's performance under the new
management of the Dewey Theater and
the indications are that this popular play
bouse has started on a season of unwont

Fiddles a Horsehair.
"There is a vast amount of horse talr
annually used In the United States for
making and repairing violin, violoncello
and bass viol bows." said a dealer in such
materials to the writer recently. "All ot
the hair comes from Germany and Rus
sia, in which countries the tails of horses
are generally allowed to grow much
longer than here. The foreign hair is also
coarser in texture and tougher than that
which grows on the American horse, and
these qualities make the imported article
more valuable than the domestic product
Is for the purpose. There are only two
kinds of horse hair suitable for ma-kins
bows, and they are of the wJiite and black
varieties. The former is used for violin
bows, and the latter, which Is heavier
and stronger, is the best material for
"making bows for 'cello and bass -viols.,
because it bites the larger strings better
The imported hair is put up In hanks of
thlrty-Blx inches long, which is five or six
Inches longer than the standard violin
bow A hank Is sufficient for one violin*
bow" while two hanks are required to hair
a 'cello or a bass viol bow, There are
about one and one-half ounces of hair in
a hank, which Is worth from 20 to CO
cents, according to the quality of the

A Sporting Prelate.
Australia has just lost one of its oldest
Inhabitants in the person of Mgr. O'Hea.
He was on the verge of 90. and had seen
Melbourne grow "from a little village into
the city of half a million Inhabitants th-it
it is to-day. Some lucky land specula
tions in the pre-goldfleld period made him
the owner of the Melbourne suburb ot Co
burg, and one of the richest men In Vic
toria. For many years he had contributed
Â£1000 per annum to the papal treasury,
and the late Pope Leo rewarded this tan
gible loyalty by making him a domestic
prelate of the Vatican. His great wealth
permitted him to be unconventional.
He was a dashing horseman and never
missed a "Melbourne Cup," the great
racing festival of the southern hemi
sphere. Rumor, indeed, alleged that he
ran horses f or that great trophy under an
assumed na.me. In summer he regularly
dressed in white from head to foot. He
attended so many Protestant gatherings,
and was so frequently seen arm in arm
with Church of England. Wesleyan and
Presbyterian clergymen that rigid Cath
olics had their doubts about his ortho
doxy, and some of them considered him
a crying scandal. As Catholic chaplain
to the Melbourne military forces he wore
a resplendent uniform at reviews and
pranced around on a magnificent steed.

looked quite insignificant beside hlm.-

Firing Positions.
Standing, kneeling, sitting and lytnsr
down are the four positions prescribed
for firing by the army regulations. The
lying position alone is prescribed for the
eight hundred and one thousand yard
ranges, while at all othÂ«r ranges up to
two hundred yards the lying and slttlns
positions are used. At one hundred and
two hundred yards the sitting and stand
ing positions are prescribed. Wherever
the sitting position ia prescribed the kneel
ing may be substituted, but for the ma
jority of persons the sitting Is by far the
better position of the two.

I RECTOR OF ST. JOHN'S
This distinction is very difficult of de
tection. So far as material, texture and
uses are concerned, the articles are iden
tical. The value of the artificial ruby is
about one-tenth of the natural.
It appears from the recoru that the de
gree of heat which v/ould be necessary to
weld pieces of genuine rubies would melt
them Into a volatile substance which
would escane, and for that reason the
process of manufacture contended for is'
impossible, though pieces of ruby may be
cemented with glass as stated. The mer
chandise In question is Identical in ma
terial, texture, and use with the genuine
ruby. Whether or not this becomes a
precious stone is unprofitable of Inquiry,
for in any event, being identical in ma
terial, texture, and use with a precious
stone, and not being provided for under
the provisions of paragraph 115, which
provides for manufactures of certain
enumerated precious stones, it becomes
dutiable, either directly or by similitude
to precious stones, under the provisions
of paragraph 435, at the rate of 10 per
cent ad valorem. â Xew York Tribune.
The only way the imitation can be dis
tinguished from the real Is that the for
mer, under powerful lenses, shows a num
ber of eccentric Hne3. These appear In
the manufactured, but never in the nat
ural ruby, and are accounted for by the
fact of the powerful pressure necessary
in the manufacture of the artificial arti
cle.
The article is made by a combination of
oxide of chrome and aluminum. This is
the natural combination of the true ruby.
The composition of this article and the
true ruby are identical. They have the
same degree of hardness, specific gravity
and color.
The process of manufacture of artificial
rubies has been known for a. quarter of a
century to certain scientists in Europe,
and for many years was preserved as a
secret by the French Academy of Sciences.
Within recent years, however, defections
on the part of the workmen, necessarily
entrusted with the secret of manufacture,
have Imported this information to others,
and the process of manufacture has be
come known and the subject of scientific
treatise and publications.
Customs officials of the Government are
learning something every day about arti
ficial gems and how they are made. An
expert knowledge is required to be able to
tell the difference between the artificial
and the genuine, says the Washington
Star. The Board of General Appraisers
in Xew York has recently had before it
the question of what rate of duty should
be assessed on artificial. rubies, which now
take the place of the genuine so often that
none but experts can tell the difference.
General Appraiser de Vries rendered an
opinion that the artificial rubies are prop
erly dutiable at 10 per cent ad valorem
as precious cut stones, but not set, either
directly or by similitude, under the pro
visions of section 7, paragraph 435, of the
Dingley act. The decision of Mr. de
Vries has been forwarder to the Treasury
Department.
The rubies *- . :tion were Invoiced
as "reconstr*. ..^ ibies." They were
consigned to a firm In St. Louis, which
took an appeal from the decision of the
Surveyor of the Port In that city that
they were dutiable at 20 per cent ad valo
rem. At the hearing of the case a mem
ber of the importing firm testified that the
artificial rubles were made of little chips
of rubies that come from the rough ruby
in the cutting of the latter, united to
gether with glass and put Into a kiln.
They are subjected to such a high degree
of heat, he said, that they are assembled
and combined together. These articles
are known as "doublets." The Board of
Appraisers, however, came to the conclu- !
sion that ttie articles in dftpute were not !
made that way and that they are really j
artificial rubies. |

The Judge was in a happy frame of
mind and gave Moore what he asked. He
sentenced him to serve 100 days and told
him that if he needed more to come back.
But Moore says he Is cured. Jail life,
he says, has its horrors, which he would
escape, and to this end he is now using
efforts to have a' petition properly pre
sented to the Governor for his release.
The entire governmental machinery of
the State of California is to be started**ap
In behalf of George Moore of Alameda,
who Is serving a 100 days' sentence in the
County Jail for drunkenne'ss and who has
directed a petition for executive clem
ency to Governor George C. Pardee.
Moore says he is the victim of too much
remorse and he believes that when the
Governor hears his tale of woe he will
stop the affairs of state long enough to
cut short the sentence.
Seventeen Cays ago Moore was arrest
ed in Alameda for being drunk. He ap
peared before Justice Tappan the next
morning in a repentant frame of mind
and with such feelings that he was will
ing to forego the taste of liquor for all
futura time. He pleaded guilty to the
charge and then asked his Honor to make
the sentence as long as possible In order
that he might fortify his resolution of
turning his back on the vile stuff and
become a total abstainer.

Deputy District Attorney Everett Brown
and Justice of the Peace Coburn of
Emeryville had hot words to-day over
the discharge of Moy Lee, charged with
assault with a deadly weapon. Brown
told the Justice that he disapproved of
his dismissal of the" case and Coburn tried
to get the Deputy District Attorney back
Into his presence to flne him for contempt.
Moy Lee owns a vegetable garden in
Emeryville and fired a shotgun at Vincent
O'Connor and some other boys who were
In the garden. The Chinaman claimed
that the boys were stealing his vegetables
and that he merely flred Into the air.
but he did not even have the opportunity
to make this statement before the Justice
to-day, for when the prosecution put in
Its case Attorney A. L. FTick moved that
the case be dismissed for want of evi
dence. Justice Coburn ordered the dis
missal and then the Deputy District At
torney walked out of the courtroom with
the' remark:
"We'll see If we can find a Justice in
the county who will hold a defendant
when sufficient cause has been shown."
That aroused the ire of Justice Coburn.
who announced that he considered that
statement intimidation of the court and
he tried to find the Deputy District At
torney, declaring that he would fine him
for contempt of court.
But the Deputy District Attorney was
already headed for Oakland with . th*
Deputy Town Marshal. As the Justice
has no court officer to enforce his Judicial
dignity, he was compelled to wait and
during the wait his wrath cooled a Jlt
tle. While he was waiting the Deputy
Marshal and the Deputy District Attorney
went to Oakland, where another warrant
was Issued for the Chinaman before Jus
tice Qulnn of Oakland. â¢â¢
The relations between the District At

ville are a little strained Just at present.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Oct. 31.
Oakland has far outgrown its police
force in the last few years. Many of the
beats have been so large that it has been
impossible for the men to cover them, and
it has been with the greatest difficulty
that the city has been policed. The new
municipal administration at once recog
nized this lack of men on the force and
allowed half a dozen new men, which will
tide the city over the present winter.
Never in the history of Oakland were
policemen appointed without regard to
politics until the present lot was added
to the force. It Is a fact that Mayor
Olney did not know the political affilia
tions of a single one of the applicants,
and the other two commissioners were
nearly if not quite as Ignorant upon this
question,- which is usually the all im
portant one In making appointments.
It is also a fact that most of the men who
were strongly Indorsed failed to pass the
examinations. These examinations were
strict but not severe. They were conducted
with absolute fairness, for some of the
meji who were favored by the commission
ers most heartily failed to pass. Before the
appointments were made, the men were
called before the commissioners in execu
tive session and questioned upon every
thing except politics, and then the ap
pointments were made. This is a record
for non-partisanship that has never been
made in Oakland before.
The names, bondsmen and beats of the
new men are as follows:
Henry Caldwell, upper Clinton, north
east of Seventeenth, bondsmen Henry H.
Buhring and John J. Ferguslftg; Roger F.
Ahern, a newly created district in the ex
treme northwestern portion of the city,
bondsmen William Walsh- and William
Mullins; John T. Fahy, Watts Tract,
bondsmen James McManus and J. F. Kel

bondsmen J. E. Greaney^ind H. W. Grlf

Tillotson, Clinton street, bondsmen Theo.

John J. Iris, the theatrical agent, relates
this Instance of Juvenile precocity.
"A proud father of a young hopeful ot :
5 was in the - habit of going out every .
evening after a glass of beer. The young- 'Â¦
ster soon grew inquisitive about these .
nightly outings and his father used to tell* :
him in baby talk: ' Â¦ 'Â¦-
" 'Papa doin* out for his walkie-walkie.* .
"The kid had a habit of looking: out of '
tha window to follow his father with his Â¦.
eyes as far as he could see. He didn't i
have far to look, for the man always
made a bee line for the corner saloon.
"Now, this young hopeful knew more
about the saloon than would naturally he
expected, and one evening when company .
was present one of the visitors asked him
where his father was. To the great
amusement of all he replied:.
" 'Papa's gone out for his Milwaukee.' "\

fort, Germany, writes: "The imports of dried,
baked and boiled fruit Into Germany for the
first half of the present year amounted to
34,070 metric tons (of 2204.6 pounds each),
against 17,757 and 20,067 metric tons, respec
tively, for the corresponding periods of 1902
and 'lOOl. Of this amount the United States
furnished 22,725 metric tons in 1903, against
9599 and 9937 metric, tons, respectively. In
1902 n.nd 1901. The United States, therefore,
supplied about 67 per cent of the total Im
ports of such fruit during the first half of
this year."

CASH WHEAT.
WHEAT â The foreign ' markets ' were not

very heavy. Â¦ .. . Â¦ v

say.: "It, was again extremely dull, with very
little activity reported "*1n the cash trade and
speculative operations Hnalnly of a scalping na

has , twp distinctly opposite features, the do

in all markets is still at a premium. The ex

provenunt. Stocks are email on the other
hand the price Is on. about an 80c basis, which
is not low. Russia., the Danubian- and India
are selling "Wheat to Europe at a rate never
b'efore 'known.. We -think crop prospects in
Australia and Argentina at .the moment indi
cate the largest production these countries
have ever had. It is therefore a little difficult
to see how the strength of our domestic situa
tion will be able to bring about the necessary
improvement in foreign markets on an advance
to keep us on export basis. There Is an In
creasing tendency to our primary movements,
and If we go off of an export basis we will
accumulate stocks rapidly. The movement
of our crop, particularly in the Northwest, has
been long delayed, and there are a good many
holes to fill up. though these are probably rap
idly being filled^ There is a lot of bullish
sentiment and talk and it has all merit in it,

As usual on Saturday/ the fruit market was
active, but supplies of all descriptions were
well up to requirements and prices bad but
slight auotable variance. > Stocks of Apples
were heavy and Included much poor stock,
which : lessened the â¢ sale - of superior quality
offerings and tended to weaken the market.
Pears and Quinces of good quality were steady,
while poor stock, which was plentiful, dragged
at low figures. Receipts of Figs were mod
erate, but proved too much, and there was a
sharp dron In' prices. Tahle Grapes were In
free supply and offerings in crates were rather
dull, owing to the lack of demand for shipping.
Small boxes were steady and large boxes sold
oft well at steady rates. The Muscat variety
had the most call and cleaned up well at $1Â®
1 25 per. box. Wine Grapes- were in ample
supply and dull, with prices largely nominal.
There was very little call for Melons and poor
stock was offered freely below the quotations.
Receipts of Strawberries were large and the
top quotations were obtained only in a small
way for strictly fancy ' stock. â¢ Raspberries
came to < hand rather ooor and the canners
secured a large portion of the receipts at the
minimum quotation. Huckleberries and Cran
berries continued firm. .
Prices of Citrus Fruits had no change worthy
of note. New crop Navel Oranges were offer
ing at $3 60 per box, but moved slowly. Ripe
Bananas were In rather limited supply and
ruled firm. Two carloads of the Central Ameri
can product were received, but were mostly
green and were not offered for sale.

BERKELEY ADVERTISEMENTS
BERKELEY REAL ESTATE.
ALLEN & ELLIS SPECIALS.
Notwithstanding the fact that we aw having
continued prosperity, and that Berkeley has It*
full share, jet there are always cases of prtfp-
erty owners who, by force of circumstances, are
compelled to sacrifice their holdings. A con-
tractor with limited capital cannot hold and
has to let go; cases of ill health, bad financial
management, removal, etc.
- We now have a few cases of this kind. Fa
that If you want a house of 6. 7 or 8 rooms
we can show you some real good places that
can be had for less than actual value â genuine
bargains. Places at prices ranging from $2500

Mystery and Wonder of Memory.
The newspapers are telling of the re
markable feat .of -a. postal clerk who, in a
civil service examination, did not make a
single error In' properly sorting 42.000 test
postal cards, â¢ each -representing a post
office in a certain territory assigned. This
was done at the , rate of thirty-three and
one-half cards a minute. Far more, note
worthy is the memory of an expert piano
player, who will- play an entire season's
concerts without a note of printed mpsic
before him.. Hia. memory is so t perfect
that hundreds of .thousands of notes must
be at the orderly and Instant disposal of
the will. And this is combined with a
multiplicity of synchronous recollections
of timbre, tempo, expression, eta.".- >
The mystery is at present past the hint-,
ing of any explanation, and this fact is
as beautiful as it Is appalling.* It shows
us ho.w,far we. are from any -real science
of psychology. Physicians t note the
strange thrusting of disease /among the
mechanisms of memory, the* morbid ef
fects of some neoplasm or injury ; to parts
of the convolutions <Jf the .brain whereby,
some memories are lost temporarily or
permanently, in part or completely, while
others' are unaffected. Even this leaves
us in amazement at the Inscrutable com
plexity and methods of the cellular ma
chine. - ;. â¢ /
But through these morbld'injurtes *we
catch tantalizing ; glimpses which " some
day, properly studied __ and followed up,
may bring some psychologic physician to
an unraveling of the mystery.â American

excess of the deposits by $25,980,900, the
.highest recorded during the year.
Comparisons of the estimates of loans
of individual banks show that there was
a net decrease by four of the largest in
stitutions of $3,400,000. In the item of cash
the net decrease by six banks was $5,
7.00,000.
The required reserve waa reduced $1,024,
500 through the decreased loans, and de
ducting this amount from the loss of cash
leaves $7,670,300 as tha decrease in surplus
ieserye to $10,274,150. , Computed on the
basis of deposits, less those of $37,156,800
of public funds, the surplus is $19,543,250. "
The discrepancy between the actual loss
as shown by the statement and the esti
mated loss may be explained by the op
eration of the average system. The move
ment of money to St., Louis and to Chi
cago was almost entirely confined to the
early part of the week, and the average
for the three days would call for but one
half of the 110,800,000 ; sent to these two
cities, or $5,400,000. The movement to New
Orleans also was largest early in tho
week, and the average would reduce this
$3,350,000 forwarded to that center to about
$1,500,000, making- the average outgo for
the week $7,000,000. The average of ship
ments to other points would bring the
total up to an amount very closely corre
sponding with the Iosb as officially given
in the bank return.
The loans were expanded by $4,409,500,
whereas a decided contraction was looked
for. This gain In loans seems to show
that the banks remitting to the interior
were not generally under the necessity of
contracting their loans for the purpose of
meeting these extraordinary requirements.
Doubtless part of the expansion in this
item reflected the replacement of foreign
loans which had been paid off within the
past fortnight, and possibly cJ_o some do
mestic negotiations.
The deposits were decreased $4,098,000,
which Is only $157,300 below the sum of
the loss of cash, less the gain In loans;
therefore the statement shows a good
balance. I ;
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â Tho Financier
says: Unusual interest was manifested
in the disclosures of the official statement
of the New York Associated Banks be
cause of the record-breaking: withdrawals
from those institutions of money through
treasury transfer and also by direct ship
ment to St. Louis, Chicago and New Or
leans, these amounting:, as estimated from
the traceable movements during: the week,
to $15,663,000. The statement showed.'how
ever, a decrease of but $8,694,800 cash,
while the estimates Indicated a net loss
on all movements of $15,340,000.

PARIS. Oct. 31.â One of the most inter
esting literary women of* Paris," Mme.
Gabiielle Reval, is one of the most do
mestic and lives a retired life with her
husband and child near the Bois da
Boulogne.
She caused a stir in the literary and '
educational worlds by writing a book
called "Sevrlennes," which described the
life of the young girls in the lyceea
(academies) of Franceâ Its Insignificance,
its limitations and its hypocrisy. This set
a good many people to thinking that a
young French girl's life should be en
larged in an educational way and not
confined so much to embroidery and fine
handwriting.
In this book, as in the one that fol
lowed it. Mme. Reval described a lycee
from life, for she had passed much of
her life in one. The second book was
called "The Lycees of Young Girls."
Then came a third, entitled "Ly
ceennes."
* The critics accuse Mme. Reval of being
too caustic, but they find much truth
in her descriptions and characterizations.
She has just issued a new book called
"Notre Dame dea Ardent3." which re
counts the pathetic story of a youn* #^rl

BERLIN, Oct. 31.â The German Govern
ment has decided to adopt still harsher
measures against the Poles, and to wound
them in their tenderest sensibilities. In
the priests' seminary In Posen, where
hitherto instruction in literature has been
given to young clerics In Polish, an order
has been issued that in the future the
German language shall be used.
. Archbishop Stablewskl is enraged, but
can do nothing, as the Government
threatens to close the seminary If he de
clines to submit. Hitherto a marriage
license has been filled out In Polish. In
future it must be in German. The same
holds good with birth and death certifi
cates.

in the afternoon, . when' I was exploring
the place under the guidance of Mme.

stand In mortal terror lest the proprietor
shall discover a shrub or plant neglected
or damaged. A 'young sapling had been
torn from Its roots j by a careless work
man in driving his cart full of earth* from
\>ne part of the estate to another. ,,Mme.

worst punishment I can give them," she
said, turning to me. "They know, that

LONDON, Oct. 31.â It is rumored

The professor, looking dispassionately
from the calm atmosphere of anthropol

lack of leaders of the highest Intelligence
in science, the arts, trade, and even poli
tics, in Great Britain he saw a want of
intelligence in the British merchant, pro
fessional man and workman. There was
a paucity of intelligent men to guide those
of moderate intelligence.
The mentally better stock, he said, was
not reproducing itself at the same rate
as formerly, and was less able but more
fertile. He continued:
"We are standing at the commencement
of an epoch which is marked by a great
dearth of ability. The remedy lies be
yond the reach of revised educational
systems. It is necessary that psychical
characters should not be manufactured
by the home, the school or the college,
but should be bred In the bone. For tho
last forty years the Intellectual classes
have ceased to give the nation a due pro
portion of good men." Nothing could cre
ate intelligence, he said; it must be bred.

The death of his crippled son by his first

he does not stay too long at the piano.
He smokes cigarettes constantly, and gen

surrounded by a group of friends his con

He bought back his father's estate and
several additional places and put money
into business enterprises in Warsaw to
encourage trade. But every time he went
to Poland he was besieged by his country
people, while the men In charge of "nl* af
fairs were cheating him outrageously in
his absence. So last year everything la
Poland was sold and Paderewakl says he
does not expect to go back there agaiu to
live.
this built all In one day."
While Mr. Paderewskl sits upstairs at
his piano all through the morning and
the afternoon Mme. Paderekski walks
over the estate, a big garden hat on her
head and her faithful pug dog Manon at
her heels. Manon has been over the
world with her and is seldom out of her
sight. She has taught her a number of
tricks, the most brilliant of which Is to
play the piano. The reaily artistic piano
playing in the house is done upstairs in
the studio and the two grand pianos in
the drawing-room are not often used ex
cept to show off Manon.
"Do you really want to see her play?"
she asked. She opened the piano and
Manon jumped up on the stool and did
play a tune. "Play on the bass," cried
her mistress, and the dog thumped obedi
ently on the bass, then gazed at us with
a triumphant air.
Mme. Paderewskl is very musical her
self and has followed her husband's career
since he was twenty, when she first met
him in Warsaw. She has Just begun to
learn to play the harp, and a beautiful
new one which her husband has given
her now stands in the gallery above the
billiard-room. The billiard-room is Pad
erewski's favorite spot in the house and
he plays the game every evening. "It Is
the only thing that takes the music out
of my head," he explained. He was
formerly fond of. horseback riding and
fencing, but they are no longer safe
pastimes for a small accident might prove
a disastrous injnry to his playing.
Mme. Paderewski comes of an old Pol

his father was exiled to Siberia by the

â¢ â¢ â¢
The play begins to-morrow evening a
season of four weeks at the Grand Opera
house. The box office record so far is
phenomenal.
The dramatist of the play,- WHlJarn
Young, is a well-known literary man. His
first play was "Jonqule," produced by Ed
win Booth at Booth's Theater, New
York. Then came "Pendragon," a trag
edy In blank verse, to which Lawrence
Barrett gave a superb production. A sim
ilar tragedy, "Ganelon," was also pro
duced by Lawrence Barrett. His "Rajah,"
which ran for 250 nights at the Madison
Square Theater, showed the versatility of
ibis genius. Among his other works was
the adaptation of Bernhardt's "Joan of
Arc," produced by Margaret Mather. Mr.
Young is said to have been especially
happy in his dramatization of "Ben Hur."
Not only does he appear to have caught
the spirit of General Wallace's novel, but
the dialogue Is written in the author's
dignified and picturesque style. Mr.
Young has handled the religious side of
the story with a sincere and delicate ap
preciation of the danger of intrusion upon
a sacred theme. There Is not a moment
in "Ben Hur" that could offend the most
sensitive Christian sentiment.
THE spectacular production of "Ben
Hur" will be the attraction this
week at the Grand Opera-house
A feature of "Ben Hur" that has attract
ed a great deal of attention is the inci
dental music, composed by Edgar Still
man Kelley, formerly professor of music
at Yale and at one time a resident of this
city. Mr. Kelley's musical setting, which
is played by an orchestra numbering
twenty-four musicians, adds materially to
the impressiveness of this extraordinary
spectacle. Mr. Kelley is considered an
authority on both sides of the Atlantic
on ancient and Oriental music, and here
gives free play to his Imagination.

"As regards the matter of my assistance
at the festivities in honor of the unveil
ing of the Richard Wagner monument I
must tell you that: Firstlyâ I sacrificed
my big fall musical festivals in'Amerlca In
order to assist with my modest means at
the great national fete, a material Moss
of $10,000, equaling 40,000 marks. Second

anything to do with other people's quar

never was opposed to the participation of
any artist in the affair. Fourthlyâ I con

row-minded and childish considerations.
Take an example by the' much abused

The great contralto received a number

of the Berlin W r agner Society. To this

HENRY WOLFSOHN, Mme. Schu
mann Heink's American man
ager, has received a letter from
the well-known prima donna, showing:
that the committee who arranged the fes
tival which took place In Berlin two
weeks ago in conjunction with the unveil
ing of the Wagner monument had any
thing but clear sailing.
Many months ago, upon the invitation
of the committee, Mme. Schumann-Heink
promised to sing at the ceremonies of the
unveiling the great Bayreuth master's
statue. It seems that an opposition, head
ed by the Wagner family and recruited
tq a' great extent by the followers of Mme.
Coslma Wagner, as well as the Wagner
Society of Berlin, tried to influence all
the artists who promised to assist, as
well as other well-known celebrities in the
musical world, to withdraw.

night?" I asked, apropos of nothing.
"It was the first time I myself was not
applauded every time I went on the stage
âand I didn't like It, either," the con
ductor naively confessed. "We were late,
true, and the audience between wrath and
giggles when we began, and of course
the conductor. Is to blame when anything
goes wrong! But we got them all right,
always do." Â»
Then a shrill "toot, toot," and we slid
easily into Palo Alto. The millionaire
was hungry, so was I, also the artist, and
with the hungry trainful we melted into
the restaurants. Mr. Duss took gluey
soup and sticky pie, with an heroic sim
plicity that one couldn't but admire him
for, and then we drove him up to the uni
versity.
On the way I asked: "Have you any
other hobby besides music?"
"It is not fair to call it a hobby," he
said simply; "music is my passion."
A cook and waiters will be aboard, but
this does not mean that Mme. Patti will
live In ; the car by any means. The ser
vants will only be necessary during tran
sit, as upon arrival at any town the
singer will Immediately go to the hotel.
Though the > diva's route is, as a rule,
an easy one, there are some heavy jumps
made necessary by the condition of the
towns at the time she will sing in them.
Thus, from 'Carnegie Hall, after her sec
ond concert : on November. 4, she will go
to Pittsburg and sing at tfie Duquesne
Gardens there on Friday, November 6.
Her next concert will be given at the
Philadelphia "Academy of Music on ' No
vember 9. and from there she will travel
as far as Montreal, to be heard in the
vast Arena there on November 12. The
trip is , necessary at this; time because
there is danger that later' In the season
so. big a place could not be properly
heated. .: ,

How Mme! Patti travels is thus inter
estingly told by her press man: The
itinerary of Mme. Patti's trip through
America is now fully settled. She left
Craig- Y-Nos October 18, gave a concert at
Liverpool October 24 and went aboard
the Etruria of the Cunard line on the
same day.
Robert Grau has taken the entire suite
on the lineY known as the Cabines de
luxe, which means the principal state
rooms on the hurricane deck. This is to
accommodate not simply Madame Patti,
but her suite of eight persons, who will
comprise, first of all, her maid, her com
panion, her private secretary, her man
ager (who will. look after, her personal
business interests during the tour),
three servants, and, of course, the Baron
himself, who, in the negotiations, ap
pears as one of the suite, but who dur
ing the trip will probably take charge
himself of the numberless points that
may come up in a matter so elaborate as
a Patti contract. For Instance, no one is
to occupy the diva's private car except
ing herself; any others are there by her
permission. The members of the com
pany will, of course, be relegated to
other cars. Then, wherever rooms are
taken, in the quietest hotel possible, the
same number of rooms must be kept va
cant overhead. This clause may seem
exacting, but it really Is not. The singer
must have rest whenever she pleases,
and nothing is more annoying to the or
dinarily nervous person than the' travel
ing overhead by strangers, who would
resent being requested to keep still, es
pecially as it may occur at all hours 6t
the night.
Then there is the carriage that must
be always at the depot ready to take her
to the hotel, the carriage that must be at
the hotel ready to take her to the thea
ter and the carriage that must be at the
theater to take her either back to the ho
tel or the depot when the concert is
over. These are Important matters, too,
for Btandlng in a draught for one min
ute might mean the loss of thousands of
dollars. In short, she must be taken
care of with even more consideration
than the most precious jewel in the
world. Otherwise, there comes the loss
of her services, which means loss to her
self and disaster to her managers.
So, while such provisions may seem
finical, they are in reality of first impor
tance. The statement that the Pullmans
are building a special car for the diva
ia entirely true. The ventilation and the
window hangings of this car will be
quite different from those In any others
that they make. Those who travel much
know the frequency of draughts and of
colds caught* while traveling. The car is
designed to prevent just that sort of
thing.

honor. I sing for the German master,
Richard Wagner, not for Herr Leichner,

John Samuel Duss, the Millionare Who Has a Big Orchestra for a Toy.
But Mr. Duss had not done with the
critics. "I like the critic who tells what
happens, doesn't advance theories," he
Bald. "One said the other day that this
orchestra played itself. Nonsense! An
orchestra can't any more play Itself
than ! The better they are the worse
they play. An orchestra of amateurs
with very little individuality of their own
will get on much better than an orchestra
like ours, for example."
"I have seen Richter and Sousa"â I
murmured doubtfully.
"Not a doubt of it," Mr. Duss decided
as to his own contention. "Then there is
the prejudiced critic. Why should any
one be prejudiced? A man came to me
in Des Moines after the concert and said
'Well, Mr. Duss. I liked the concert im
mensely. I must confess I was preju-'
djced before'â 'Prejudiced!' " and the Duss
fist flew out again and the men behind
smilingly wondered what the meek per
son in front had said to rouse such a
storm. "Then he began to explain. 'How
dare you explain!' I said. Then, he told
me, he a. newspaper man, that he haft
formed an opinion from the newspapers!"'
"What am I to say, Mr. Duss," I
laughed.
He laughed, too, and said then: "You
must say 'Duss' to rhyme with 'puss.' "
"Is it Jo^n?" I asked.
"Yea. Th'e name's Just half as bad as
'John Smith.' Impossible for a pro
gramme. The 'S,' worse still, stands for
'SamueL' "
Bayreuth, where the conductor has not
been, somehow came up then with Its
hidden orchestra.
"But I want to see the men," buss in
sisted. "True, the individuality of the
players always rather interferes with the
music I'd enjoy the trombone better if
the player didn't puff out his cheeks. I
don't like to see a man sit pigeon-toed"
âillustrating both. "But where every mo
tion agrees with the spirit of the music
it rather helps than hinders. Now it is
impossible for me to conduct In a rigid
fashion. Of course I'm not a great con
ductor, but I have my ideas. The Ger
mans â not as a nation â would never : go
wild over me. They like the solid, ponder
ous, heavy style of conducting. With the
French it is different, - all Jineese, airy,
light, off the fingertips," and I fancied
then that Mr. Duss* conducting must be
in the -French style.' *

"They went for you there, didn't they,
Eddy?" Mr. Duss continued, smiling over
at his young trumpeter.
"Eddy" smiled back- and began: "Butâ"
"Oh, you did the best you could," his
conductor affably said. "That particular
duck that came to criticize didn't know
his business, that was all. He said the
brass was too loud, singling out our
trumpeter there. It was simply a matter
of the acousticsâ they were so clear that
even every bit of the lip work cpuld be
heard. And you can't criticize without
you hear the band from all over the
house. It makes all the difference. Two
critics, both good, came to me after a
concert. One said, 'It was fine, but your
brass was too loud.' The other said. 'It
was fine, and your brass was balanced
like Seidl's.' 'Where did you sit?' I asked
the first man. He showed me â just where
the trombones pointed right at you."
"Seidl changed so much," Eddy recalled.
"At one time you couldn't get enough
tone for himâ he'd shout, 'Use your
third lung!' Then It seemed to hurt him,
the big sound, and we couldn't get It
down enough."
itâ it's all a matter of taste, though. Then
I'm cranky about the kettledrums. To
me they are almost always too loud. The

they sound like hotel gongs. They're only
a background. Why, this looks like Ger

quickly spinning past.
"Pretty cow thatâ doesn't give much
milk though." It was a bonny black and
white beast, standing with a clutter of
hens about Its feet.
"No?" I respectfully queried.
"Doesn't take an old stockman to tell
that," Mr. Duss smiled. "Too fat."
"Oh," I said.
"But about the kettledrumsâ you don't
mind my moving?" This to the artist, who
had expressed a desire to get the nose â
delicate and strongâ of the man before
him. "Get the left side, it's tho best," ho
advised, fraternally, quite without vanity,
promptly facing to the left.
"About those kettledrums?" I prompted.
"Well, they get In front too often.
They're only a background, an atmos
phere, after all. Of course, they're backed
up against a wall usually, and that pro
jects their sound. Halls differ, of course.
By the way, we haven't come across
many halls with better acoustics than
that good-for-nothing armory in Portland

The bright-faced youth addressed as

"No." He is the first trumpet, and a won.

stated, "and : a euphonium. .You' don't

"I'm sure you're very welcqme," I said.
"It was in the communistic colony of
that name in Pennsylvania that his first
work as a musical conductor became
known. Here he was born and reared, an
American of German descent. Later he
lived on a ranch in Nebraska, whence he
was recalled to the colony to take charge
of its schools, bringing a vrlfe, although
one of the tenets of his sect (the Separa
tists) was the discouragement of matri
mony, because it daily expected the sec
ond advent of the Savior.
"Mr. Duss was elected next to a posi
tion corresponding to that of an apostle
in the Mormon church, and finally,
through the death of those above him,
and the separating of others from the re
ligious body, he became the head of the
colony and its institutions. These he
found incumbered with heavy debts, even
the titles to the property not well assured.
This Is the period of his career where he
distinguished himself not only as re
ligious leader and preacher, but as finan
cier, promoter and lawyer, for he success
fully carried through immense litigations,
lasting ten years, restoring the former
r-plendid credit of the colony and estab
lishing new industries within it, for which
it became famous. All the time he was
studying music and leading the colony
band as a means of recreation, for music
had always been his master passion and
his great talent showed at an early age.
"It has been falsely stated, possibly
through jealousy or Ignorance, that his
phenomenal and almost instantaneous
success and rapidly achieved fame as an
orchestral conductor are due to his im
mense wealth, and that the real work
was done by substitutes. This is incor
rect. It takes more than money for a
man to be the successful 'mixer,' as
some Western papers have etyled Mr.
Duss, and to gain the confidence, respect
and admiration of a body of fifty famous
musicians. That he has gained these
and the affections of his men is evidenced
by the beautiful Jewel, a Greek cross set
with diamonds, rubies and emeralds,
which he wears on a ribbon around his
neck the gift of his orchestra.
"Mr. Dufs has In the last season received
the most cordial acknowledgments of his
practical knowledge of music in all its
branches, his great qualities as a leader,
requiring temperament and magnetism,
from the most authoritative critics and
tho press generally. He plays every
string and wind instrument and is thor
oughly conversant with the world's best
music. In appearance he reminds one of
the great conductor, Anton Seidl, if he
wore his hair as long, but he Is too Amer
ican and democratic for that, and he
might be mistaken at first sight for a suc
cessful business man of large affairs.
One of his big ventures during the spring
was the spectacular and musical produc
tion of 'Venice' at Madison Square Gar
den. It is hoped that he may live long
to stir the hearts and elevate and edu
cate the feelings of his countrymen by
the magic wand of his musician's baton."
"There was always the music?" I said,
nodding at the paper in my hand.
"Always," he replied. "It is so foolish
of the papers talking as if it were a new
thing with me. Why, I led a. small brass
band when I was 9 years old, and the
very minute I was footloose I began with
the orchestra,"
"Had you a good orchestra in 'Har
mony?' "
"Oh, well, one had to take what ma
terial there was and it is only a. small
place."
"Great fun to do what you want to do,
isn't it?" I asked, but little more than
you or I does Mr. Duss do what he would.
He -fell to talking almost immediately
of "the orchestra he would have if he
had the opportunity." Questioned as to
Its make-up, ho said naively;
"Oh, that is what I am not going to
tell you. All trades have their secrets,
and that is where one's individuality
ccmes in."
"I know a man "who wants sixteen
horns in his orchestra," I murmured
temptingly.
"Sixteen horns, sixteen horns," he mut
tered, "and there you see how foolish he
v;as to speak of it. I might steal the
ideaâ"
"Since hearing the great Metropolitan
Opera-house Symphony Orchestra one is
curious to know something more of the
personality and history of the gifted man
whose master mind can direct such a
body of individual artists and so harmo
nize the work of each and all as to bring
glorious results. 'Harmonie,' indeed,
has been the keynote of the life of J. S.
Dues.
"Whereas"â with a smileâ "I am here,
but with ten stormy years of fighting be
tween." Then Duss sat up and set his
lips. His eyes burned into black, and he
startled me by shoving his clenched fist
into a mass of imaginary face3. "What
do you think they said about me, your
newspapers? I had pulled things together
in the colony, reclaimed lands for them,
brought wealth where there was bank
ruptcy, order out of disorder, and' there
was nothing the papers did not accuse me
of. They said I had poisoned people, they
accused me of familiarity with women I
had never seen." Then he stopped with a
shrug. "Bah! but it Is all over now."
I waited while several fields raced past
the windows until I asked. "When did
you go back there?"
"In 1SS8," he replied. "But here is some
thing that tells as much about the thing
as is essential. It's all true, except that I
have been a lawyer. Never was."
He handed me, from a pocket full of
letters, the following, from a Middle West
journal of a day or two ago, that as It has
Mr. Duss' unqualified indorsement, is val

"Zaza" promises extremely well. Thero
is about the opera the same virile qual
ity, of music made because It must be
made, of the *"I'PagllaccI." possibly tha
most powerful example of the modern
Italian school. It is also very melodious
and Intensely dramatic in story. Tbe
libretto Is by Illica, of the best of modern
librettists.
The fame of It has reached even to New
York. The Times comments both upon
the iacts that "La Tosca" and "Andre
Chenler" were given last year, and t^at
we are to have this season tho aforesaid
novelties. Neither does It fail to draw
the unflattering comparison between tho
Metropolitan Opera-house and the Tivoll
Opera-house managements. It la well to
have one's blessings labeled occasionally,
lest we forget, and perhaps a New York
label carries more conviction than a loemi
ticket.
At least one of the novelties promised
for the season of grand opera at the Tlv
oli is* now on the way to production, the
"Zaza" of Leoncavallo. Just what this
means Is In danger of being forgotten by
a public lazily accustomed to the grit and
enterprise of the plucky littla opera
house. There are two novelties promised
this year, the "Zaza" aforesaid and tbe
"Adrian Lecouvreur" of Cilia. Neither of
these has yet been given in America.
Both are new even In their own countries.
New York gets never more than two new
operas during its season, with all tha ma
chinery of unlimited wealth behind It,
and even this evokes a chorus of compli
ment for the enterprise therein evinced.
Yet here, in the jumping off place, where
without the whole company tucked up Its
sleeves to the work the production would
be impossible, this absurd little place does
things all along the line like It3 ridicu
lously good "Tosca" and "Andre Che
nler" of last year, without- turning a hair.

;. " "And comes back to play at the Al
hambra in the ex-ening!" I muttered.
'â¢Who'd be a millionaire?"
: "And there may be a good deal to do
. i:i the interim," added the manager.
. "But couldn't you go down to Palo Alto?
We have a special going down and you
â¢ truld have then a good hour with Mr.
, Duss."
â¢ And that is why half past 11 o'clock on
" Tuesday found me at Third and Town
" reiid. In an almost new neck ribbon and
1 my nearest Paquln hat. for one doesn't
"meet a millionaire every day! Mr. Duss
had not arrjved. but the station was
.ciowded with fiddlers, trumpeters, drum
mers and their worshipful ilk. They were
: laughing, jesting, humming things, wait
1 Ind with the ease of old travelers, hand
some Otto Schafer towering above the
rest, and th*> apostle-like mane and head
of Belter, the horn player, giving a touch
of valuable local color to the picture. In
' Mcie trains screamed, puffed In, puffed
/out, but these spoiled guests of Million
aire Duss recked naught of timetables.
Manager Greenbaum arrived then to
'.create a diversion with a huge packet of
mail. "Two for you"â "Nothing to-day"
; â"Just a postal"â "Bills:"â came from the
' 'group that gathered about the new post
;"man like Hies about a honey pot, and
then came Mr. Duss to take possession of
. his half dozen Utters. He busied him
.solf with these for a few moments and
. then curtlyâ or shylyâ acknowledged the
introduction of the interviewer.
I should have given the millionaire a
ministry or lawyer's lot at first glance,
. reUhcr offensively prosperous. His coat
iind the rest of his garb disagreed in their
â¢nrodest stripe, his black overcoat had
bten newer and Mr. Duss' necktie, a rich
â¢ red. Mack and yellow blur, had never
.been exactly a virtuoso effort. His broad
1-nrnmed hat shaded a keen, nervous,
ckar-cut face, scored prettily heavily
{about the brow and lighted by a pair of
unusually handsome eyes behind steel-
Jramed pince-nez, slightly chipped. He
was. haired in business-like fashion, a
.scumbling of gray over the black, and
Â¦with only the necessary jewelry.
. Somehow the make-up suited him and
inspired liking. There was a carelessness
' 5hort of affectation and simplicity about
it -that led one to hope things of the Dues
"conducting and to like the man. At least
-here was a man who with enormous
Â¦wealth had magnificently chosen an or
chestra as his toy, and for the fun of con
ducting had left his happy home for days
to which the eight-hour programme Is a
pimple picnic. One liked again the quiet
camaraderie of his greeting to the friendly
salutations of his orchestra, in which one
noted no small element of respectâwheth
er for the man or his music I was then
unable to determine. So altogether I was
pleased when the "special" drew out of
the station with Mr. Duss on the oppo
site seat from me and a forty-minute chat
: in sight.
Â¦ It is to confess that the prospect did not
â¢'seem to present Itself in equally attrac
tive light to the leader. Mr. Duss, in
â¢ truth, looked bored, sleepy. His tallish,
slightish figure tumbled Into a tired
. heap in his seat. He fingered one
of hjs letters ner\-ously, decorated the
Â¦'postmark with an elaborate device and
gave me scarcely a glimpse of his hand
. some eyes with the monosyllables with
â¢ which he answered my first conventional
â¢.queries. 1 discovered later that a gen
eral doubt of the newspaper person ex
. plaimd at least something of his earlier
. attitude to this particular member of the
. craft, and when Mr. Duss handsomely as
sured me afterwardâ as we partook of the
-wonderful luncheon that Palo Alto affords
â that he had talked more to me than to
"any ten reporters all along the line," 1
felt not unreasonably flattered.
"You don't want to know anything about
'Harmony?' " I had first asked Mr. Duss
of the etrange colony of communists and
Â« religionists In which he made his huge
" fortune. "Every newspaper in the coun
try has had the story," he continued,
â¢ wearily.
"I've never seen it," I said, "and If you
don't mindâ"
â¢ "Well," he began, resignedly scoring his
envelope again, "the colony was founded
in 1SGS by Father Rapp. He was a priest
from Wurttemberg. Persecution drove

ribbon nor a single pack of rice provided
by the grumpy old fellow for the proper
dispatching of the warriors' brides. Why
couldn't he have thawed out enough to
have at least "dressed ship"? But the
brides didn't care. Their staterooms had
been made pretty with posies and they
had recovered their mates from "that

reception was given by the board of di

demonstrated to their guests the splendid
work done by our blind brethren. From a
social standpoint the reception was an
eminent success, but it reached further
than thatâ it manifested the efforts of
these good women to lead the blind to
help themselves and thereby get out of a
darkened life some of its wholesome
sweets. The following ladies received the

As to the women of our sainted mothers'
times, they performed their charities
without method, spasmodically and un
ecitntlflcally, you might say, and while
emanating from no warmer hearts, they
generate to-day from clearer headsâsim
ply because they are trained heads. And
that is tbe simple psychology of the
thingâ why the society woman of to-day
is not charitable and kind sporadically
and Intermittently. She goes about her
work with the methodlcs of a mechanic,
ha.8 her regular hours devoted to her hos
pital work, to her sewing class, or to her
library work for the blind, or her settle
ment work, besides the numerous other
hours devoted to committees on "ways
end means," that these benign benisons
of the poor and afflicted may continue to
exist. She has quite outgrown the inno
cent state of gullibility, and clever indeed
is the faker who can cajole the present
Charity worker ("charity" isn't a pleas
ant word to the ears of a recipient, Chris
tion worker is better, perhaps) Into be
stowing relief or aid unworthily. And
looking into presented cases Is no small
part of her time-taking labors. But she
does Itâ and she likewise attend her teas,
and her clubs, and her receptions, chatty,
chipper, cheery, for the light of love is
in her soul and the joy of activity aglow
in her eyes. She Is the society woman of
the day, for whom "age" will hold no ter
rors, for as the rears go by they be
queath to her a heritage of love, which,
radiating from her person like the rays
of the sun, keep her ever young and fair
thus hath she found the "eternal foun
tain of youth."
this was particularly true of
the women of the leisure class, they who,
through a clever selection of parents, or
of husbands, constituted the social struc
ture known generically as "society."
(What a desiccated, desecrated, degene
rated term that has come to be! And
yet, if one writes it "the smart set," there
are some Sanctimonies who see in the
phrase an unwonted suggestion of levity
or sportiveness. Won't some linguistic s=a
irarttan'invent some new and proper ap
pellationâand patent it against spurious
imitators ?)

is, when they were not actively

her maid of honor and her three attend
ants. "Were ever vestal virgins fairer?
The bride's gown was a pretty affair
of soft satin crepe, with a quaint bertha
of lace. Such a soft redding gown is
rather a pleasant deviation from the se
vere robe usually planned by ihe immov
able modiste. Somehow the gown of
Mips Bruce seemed to fit her personalityâ
as well as her personâ admirably.
Miss Van "Wyck, who, liy the way, is a
splendid type of Southern beauty, was
strikingly pretty in while chiffon and
blue ribbons. Miss Ethel Cooper. Miss
Lucie King and Miss Margaret Sinclair,
the maids, wore dainty frocks of pale
blue chiffon and carried white carnations.

Mrs. Eleanor Martin Is back amons us
The Downey Harveysâ that is, the fem
inine portionâ are having a merry time In
Paris, where they intend to remain until
the holidays. Miss Anita has been indus
triously acquiring an enviable French vo
cabulary, which, seriously, is an accom
plishment only^ too rare now among our
growing girls. However, If another lan
guage than our own cannot be thoroughly
mastered it probably Is better to put In
the extra effort on our utilitarian Eng
lish, as we use it rather often, and often
rather badly.
The wedding of Miss Alice Belau,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. O. Belau, and
Emery W. Elliot, son of Charles E. El
liot, was a very pretty affair. Dr. Brad
ford Leavitt performed the pleasant ser
vice of uniting the loving twain.
The bride, who is a girl of striking per
sonality, looKed every inch a bride in her
gown of white net over* silk. So, too, was
the maid, Miss Elsa Hoesch, a pretty pic
ture.
The young people will live at the Cali
fornia on their return from the nuptial
trip. /
for Manila, where she will be the guest
of General and Mrs. Luke "Wright. She
will tour China and Japan before her re
turn. If there be anything worth while
that Miss Voorhies misses in her pereg
rinations it would be worth noting it,
for she is intensely keen of conception
and appreciative of the worth of things.
Miss Maud Cluff is being feted extrav
agantly these days. Last week she was
the guest of honor at several functions,
and this week is again an honored guest.
The hostess at this function, Miss May
Sharon, manifested her individuality in
the manner of her entertaining. The
rooms In which her guests gathered had
been made to appear like an Oriental
drawing-room, with a wealth of rugs on
walls and floor, shadowy furnishings and
old lanterns. , The effect was charming,
suggesting the setting for an eastern ha
rem. 'Twas a lucky thing old Abdul
Hamid didn't look in or he would have
claimed the whole company his'n.
