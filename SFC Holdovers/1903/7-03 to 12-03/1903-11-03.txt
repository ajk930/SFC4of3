messages a number <rt posses attempted
to head him off, but he eluded thejn.
The latest news of the fugitive came
from Sargents, where it was said the
man, had left his horse and taken to
the hills, being pursued by parties from
Gilroy.
SALINAS, Nov. 2.â Sheriff J^esbitt was
notified from Coral de Tierra this even
ing to watch for a man who is accused
of horse stealing and burglary and who,
it is alleged, took a horse from his em
ployer, A. Braemer. The man has given
the various names of Delman, Belman
stein and Siegfried von Berkenfeld. One
identification makes him a former Ger
man student who left his home in the
fatherland on account of some trouble.
H. S. Allen, cltrk of the City School
Board, says his department would be run
in debt between $3'j0,O00 and $400,000 with
out the levy. The county and the school
district could tide over the difficulty by
Issuing warrants and bonds, but the ex
pense entailed would be great.
Among the members of the Multnomah
delegation in the State Legislature it is
generally taken for grarAed that Gover
nor Chamberlain will call a special ses
sion to remedy the defect in the tax law
passed last winter. Despite the Gover
nor's known reluctance to convene the
Legislature, the opinion is virtually unan
imous that the need of legislative action
is too great to .-e ignored and that the
fact will be recognized by the Governor.
PORTLAND. Or.. Nov. 2.â Unless a spe
cial sess:on of the Oregon Legislature is
held to legalize the January levy the city
of Portland and Multncmah County will
b t without finances fur the ensuing year.
"Without the January tax levy the city
government cannot exist; it must go to
pieces," ?aid - Mayor Wiiliams to-day.
â¢The charter for the city of Portland
makes It illegal for the city to go into
Uebi. The coin must be in the treasury.
City Councilman who wouid" vote to con
tract a. debt would, under the existing
law. be guiltv of malfeasance in office.
Inert will be about $50,000 -with which to
run the city government after January 1
next. This amount is oniy a drop in the
bucket and would Last but. two months."
Multnomah County is .already thirteen
months behind in its warrants and the
debt would increase at .the rate of $20,000

should be collected.

BUSY FIREBUGS
ALARM THE TOWN
Creffield and Brooks were anxious to
leave the Hurt House early in the after
noon, but a crowd hung around the place
all day, and neither cared to attempt
flight under . such ominous conditions.
Late in the afternoon, however, the
crowd began to dwindle and, choosing a
convenient opportunity. Brooks left the
place and walked hurriedly away. There
are reports to the effect that he is still
hiding at one of the four or five houses
in town in which the families in whole
or in part are "Holy Roller?," but the
general impression is to the contrary.
Crefiield took his leave an hour later. A
buggy appeared at the door of the Hurt
House, the apostle hurriedly entered it
and the conveyance was driven swiftly
away, going south. Its destination is
supposed to have been an East Side town,
where an overland train could be board
ed. Had the apostles remained in town it
is common belief that there would have
been further demonstrations. The public
believe Creffleld and Brooks were leading
the converts Into delusions and conditions
likely to produce insanity. The destruc
tion of furniture has not been confined
entirely to the Hurt House, but converts
in other immediate localities have burned
their earthly possessions. The apostles
taught their members to withdraw wholly
from the world and have nothing to do
with those who remained outside the
fold of the "Holy Rollers."
CORVALLIS. Or.. Nov. 2.â The flight of
Apostles Creffleld and Brooks from town
is the latest development in the sensation
caused here by the sect known as the
"Holy Rollers." They went without cer
emony. Creffleld, in a swiftly driven bug
gy, going south, and Brooks, it is sup
posed, departing on foot. Fear of bodily
harm, it is said, was the incentive for
their flight.
After successfully establishing their
sanity before the County Board on Sat
urday the so-called apostles returned to
the Hurt House. As they left the jail they
were teld of a strong public sentiment
against them and they were advised to
leave town. They laughed at the idea,
raying the Lord would protect his own.
Yesterday about noon Mr. Hurt, the
owner of the Hurt House, and a new
convert to -the sect, accompanied by his
son, visited the Sheriff and demanded
protection, adding that ff the county
authorities would ' not- protect the Holy
Rollers from outrage he would appeal to
the Governor. The Sheriff promised as
sistance and spent most of the night in
the Hurt House. Although a large crowd
Stood around the house all day until a
late'hour, no demonstration was made.
TACOMA, Wash.; Nov. i ; â A .riot oc
curred Saturday night at Pullman, Wash.,
and 250 students of the State* Agricultural
College gave City Marshal Baymiller and
his three deputies an unwelcome shower
bath because of their interference in the
annual contest for. supremacy between
sophomores and freshmen. - ;
The freshmen had decided to select
Halloween night to take the. sophomores
in hand to demonstrate their; superiority.
The sophomores were greatfy outnum
bered, but put up a plucky fight. The
freshmen had succeeded in tieing three of
their opponents when the offers arrived.
Securing a lire hose they turned a full
stream of cold water on th ; e struggling
mass of students. ,
Full of resentment the students turned
j in a body on the officers. In a few mo-
I ments the marshal and his deputies were
' soaked to the skin. A struggle for pos
session of the hose followed-? and during
the melee the hose was ruined with
knives. One deputy was carried to the
river's edge, but released upo.n his prom
ise to go home.
The students then hustled levery mov
able vehicle to a - common point on the
main street, despoiled the city watering
wagon of wheels and wound up the night
by filling the vehicle shed with cord
wood. * '

It was stated to-day by a member of

the custom for those having the contract
for printing the stamps to furnish to the

are known as proof sets. Contrary to the

ed on cardboard and are of no commercial
value, being simply specimens. In thi3
instance the contractor was the Govern
ment printing ofSce. and it is slated on
the highest authority that fewer sets
were called for than ever before. General
Bristow, under instructions from the
Postmaster General, has the, matter in

the member of the Cabinet referred to
that the custom of permitting persons to
have proof sets was a lor.g established
one.

has not been during my administration

BALTIMORE. Xov. 2.â Though the close
of the State campaign was announced on
Saturday nl?ht tho two candidates for
Governor did not relax their active labors
until late to-night. Edwin Warfleld, the
Democratic nominee, spent the entire day
in Howard County, his home county. Ste
venson A. Williams, the Republican can
didate, reached Baltimore to-day.
Chairman Murray A. Vandlver of the
Democratic State Central Committee and
Chairman John B. Rannai of the Repub
lican Committee have issued lengthy ad
dresses to their respective parties, in
which strong appeals are made to support
the party nominees.
At to-morrow's election the polls will
be open at 0 a. m. and close at 5 p. m..
the Australian secret system of voting
being in force. Eoth parties expect a full
vote and an orderly and chalet election.

There is a split in the Democracy, a fac
tion dividing from the regulars with a
full city and State ticket under the head
ing cf the "Independent party."
City Chairman Donnelly of the regular
Democrats, when asked for his opinion on
the outlook, -aid:
"The Regular Democratic ticket should
poll at least 40,000 votes in Philadelphia
to-morrow."
"The Republican candidates on the city
ticket should be elected by a majority of
at least 100,000."
The campaign has been a quiet one
throughout, there having been fewer
mass-meetings and less political oratory
than In many previous years. Senator
Penrose, chairman of the Republican
State organization, said to-day:
"The Republican State ticket should be
elected by a majority cf not less than 130,-
OCO and the figures may reach 175,000."
Insurance Commissioner Durham, who
is in control of the Republican organiza
tion in this city, said:
PHILADELPHIA. Xov. 2.â The general
opinion, as expressed by the- Republican
leaders. Is that Pennsylvania will to-mor
row give its usual off-year majority for
the Republican candidates. The Demo
cratic State chairman and other Demo
cratic State Uaders decline to give fig
ures, merely contenting themselves with
the prediction that a full Democratic vote
will be cast.
Majority for the Republican Ticket
May Reach 175,000.
PENNSYLVANIA'S OUTLOOK.
John R. McliÂ«an of Cincinnati through
a commissioner sent in $10,000 to bet at 10
to 9 on McClellan.
The polls will open to-morrow at 6 a. m.
and close at 5 p. m. The Indications are
for fine weather, a heavy vote and a close
finish.
Some of the Broadway hotels to-night
presented the most animated appearance
that the;- have given so I'ar during the
campaign, as betting men were about irf
crowds offering all sorts of beta for and
against the two candidates for the Mayor
alty. The prevailing odds were 10 to 3
on McClellan.
Tammany made its 'final preparations
for the struggle to-night by the distribu
tion of sinews of war to the amount of
between $130,000 and $200,000 to the district
leaders for election expenses.
An Interesting minor feature of the sit
uation^ was the declaration to-day by Dep
uty Attorney General T. C. C. Crain that
the destruction of the houses of 500 voters
in the fire at Coney Island yesterday, be
ing "an act of God," could not be used as
a pretext for depriving them of the right
to vote.
While abating nothing in confidence the
fusionist lpacier? claim no more than 30,-
OiM plurality for Low, .-ilthougn it is said
thnt their desert estimates point to a ma
jority of about half that figure. The
fu?ioni. c ts nui their faith on their ability
to carry Brooklyn by at least 2>,000.
which, with estimated pluralities of 3000
in the Brunx and 2000 In Richmond and a
drawn battle in Queens, -will suffice to
handsomely offset the conceded plurality
of 12,<)00 for McClellan in Manhattan.
EVEN DEVERY IS CONFIDENT.
Not to lag behrnd the other combatants
In confidence, William S. Devery an
nounces that he expects to poll not less
than 45 per cent of the total registered
vote. Devery was elated to-night when
Police Commissioner Greene consented to
have his returns telephoned to headquar
ters with those of Low and MeCleUan in
stead of being sent in by messenger with
those of the rest of the field. Considerable
interrst attaches to the size of the vote
that Devery will control and it may have
a serious influence on the results.
The usual reports of "colonization" on
a large scale are still industriously circu
lated and the campaign or State Superin
tendent Morgan to check illegal voting,
which was concluded to-day by the sum
moning of sex'eral hundred witnesses to
headquarters to testify to hundreds of
cases of illegal registration, has been the
most complete LnQCisition undertaken in
the history of the city. No less than
three thousand suspicious cases have been
investigated out of a total registration of
625.SS0, and It is probable that many ar
rests will be made to-morrow. Every
polling place will be under the close scru
tiny of the superintendent's, deputies, who
will have the assistance of the strongest
force of watchers ever placed at the polls,
organized by the Citizens* Union. With
these precautions it is predicted that ille
gal verting will be reduced to a minimum.
TAMMANY DISTRIBUTES COIN.

Charles FJ llurphy in his estimate' of 100,
000 plurality for HcClellan, based on the
reports of his district leaders, that to
night he published orders to go ahead
â¢with the preparations for a rousing cele
bration of the victory.
The estimate of John J. Delaney, ilc-
Clellan's , personal camraign manager,
places the plurality at S5.3D0. being 73,000
in Manhattan and the Bronx, 5M0 in
Brooklyn; 5o*Â»> in Queens and 1800 in Rich

NEW YORK, Nov. a. â Fusion and Tammany leaders were busy to
day making final arrangements for the manning of the polls to
morrow. The Fusionists showed stronger faith in their chances
of victory than_ever and there was an air of hopefulness at their head
quarters.
Interest in the elections outside of Mew York is divided between
Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Conditions iri Mary
land are so rnixed that both parties are at sea. The in dependent vote is
likely to decide the contest. The Democrats in Ohio concede the elec
tion of Myron T. Herrick, the Republican candidate for Governor. The
Republicans expect a large majority in the Legislature. Both sides are
confident in Massachusetts, although the election of the Democratic can
didate for Governor would cause surprise. In Rhode Island the Re
publicans are confident they will elect their entire State ticket.

piece of vandalism was of sufficient im

books of mortgages in .use twenty years

the books were not damaged or the per
son, If detected, could be prosecuted for
the mutilation of a public record. As it is
it has only been the outside of the books
that have been attacked. Some of them
are bo badly torn that the entire back on

most of the cases, however, the work of
destruction has not gone so far as this.

, evening at 6:20 o'clock he passed away in

CADETS ARRANGE BENEFIT
I FOR ST. COLUMBA'S PARISH
Dr. Sundberg told humorously of his ar
rival at Bagdad as a preface to his de
scription of the gross corruption which
prevail? among officials.
He said that "wlif-n he landed they would
not allow him to land." He had his pass
port, but the official on duty at the wharf
could not read it and said it would have
to po to Constantinople. As it would have,
taken five months before a reply could
possibly be received, and as It was essen
tial that he must land and not desiring
to remain on the wharf until a reply
should be "received from Constantinople,
he followed the custom of the country and
deposited a bulky roll in the official's
pocket and immediately the Consul was
;.!lowed to pass.
While he gave praise to the Turks for
their virtues of bravery and military
standing he said the majority of the rul
ing officials were corrupt. He described
outrages on young children which were
of a most terrible nature, and described
a mode of punishment at Bagdad. Of
â¢fenders. he said, were buried up to the
hrad. the head was covered with honey,
v.-hich attracted the ants and the insects,
which did the rest.
. The honesty cf the people was remark
able, but it mfffht. he said, have somÂ°
thing to do with the punishmri.t that is
meted out to offenders. For the first of
fense of theft the thief would be sen
tenced to have one of his hands cut off,
for a second offense he lost his head, and
the doctor said he never knew of a third
offense.
The doctor spoke of the slaves of the
past centuries and of the present period,
saving that they were .well treated and
the freemen did the hard work. Slaves,
he said, were kept for ornamental" pur
.poses. Religious freedom, he declared,
Â¦fxiists in name but not in reality. The
people of whom h^ spoke were intensely
honest. One might put down a purse of
gold on the roadside and leave it for hours
and on his return it would be found in
the very identical place where it had been
deposited.
SALUTARY PUNISHMENT.
Dr. Sundberg won the heartiest ap
j>Isuf* for the serio-humorous speech he
made in c-spousing the cause of the Chris
tiar.s who are compelled to submit to the
government of the Turk. In Bagdad,
where ho served as I'nited States Consul
some years ago. he found so many na
tion? represented th^re that there was a
confusion of languages, which, he said,
may have been accounted for by the prox
imity of the Tower of Babel.
Professor Landfield arose after the ad
dress of Rev. Mr. Dabovich and supple
mented his previous remarks with the
statement that Christian or missionary
interference might be the danger to the
peace of the Turk. If any man was in
tolerant, he said, it was the man who
Tried to convert the Turk, who has no
desire to be converted. Professor Land
n>!d thought that the Turk in that re
tpect ought to be given the benefit of
the doubt and allowed to work out his
own salvation.
The reverend gentleman illustrated the
high qualities of the Slavonian, his eml
nextce in art. in science and general learn
ing. 'The Slavonic race, he declared, was
progressive but never aggressive. He
paid a high tribute to the good influence
cf the women of the country.
HOW PEACE IS THREATENED.
.While the Turk, he said, was particular
In the observance of his religion and \yas
jealous of its safeguards, he was, never
theless, extremely liberal in that he did
not, as was generally supposed, interfere
with the religious convictions of others
s^o long as they paid their taxes, which
xvas of paramount importance.
The Rev. Sebastian Dabovich spoke
from the standpoint of an outsider â Sla
vonian, yet one who sympathized with
his kin.

BAN DIEGO, Nov. 2.â In the Superior
Court this afternoon Mrs. R. O. Butter
field commenced an action against the
American Lythia and Chemical Company
of New York and others for the annull
ment of certain deeds and transfers to the
lepidollte and amblygonite mines at Pala.
They have been owned in the past by
Mrs. Butterfield. N. G. Douglass, Frank
Salmons and others. In order to get them
developed the owners entered into certain
contracts by which they were to transfer
the property to W. H. Crane, who agretd
to finance the corporation, sell $100,000 in
stock at par. return $200,000 in stock to
the original owners, buy out some others,
pay certain claims against the mine and
put it en its fret in the form of a cor
poration.
It Is claimed by Mrs. Butterfield that
Crane has received the transfer for the
property, has formed the corporation and
lias deeded the property to the corpora
tion without doing any of the other things
promised. It Is also declared that the cor
poration intends to go on with the dis
position of the valuable ore which the
mine contains without letting any of the
original owner? in on the deal. The com
plaint is accompanied by a petition for
the appointment of a receiver and Frank
Salmons has been named to take charge
pending the settlement of the litigation.
Facial Dispatch to The Call.
The Council adopted a resolution direct-
Ing the ordinance and judiciary commft
tee to make a report on the status of the
water rates litigation, to determine the
necessity for further employment of spe
cial counsel m the case and to ascertain
what effect a decision by the Supreme
Court either for or against the city
would have upon the rate payers.
Meese desired to give the Second Ward
ers opportunity to present their bond. It
was said the company might decide to
commence operations under the original
ordinance which is in force. Attorney
Goodfellow intimated such a coarse might
be taken.
W. S. Goodfellow, representing the
crematory company, urged that the only
question at issue was whether the test
should be made. He believed /that the re
sult of the test would solve the question
whether the plant is a nuisance. Council
man Elliott said the Second Ward would
keep the crematory provided it were
moved to the western end of the ward.
Councilman Cuvellier urged the point:
"Shall we.sive the crematory people a
chance to show that their plant Is not a
nuisance?"
"Our objections to the crematory are
not as to odors but to the location. The
plant is a damage to our property and
has practically destroyed values within
the range of its influence. We know this
because we feel the effect of it. The city
has no right by reason of its police pow
ers to inflict damage on us. It is esti
mated that the returns from this con
tract to the company will be 585,000 a year.
We ask that this crematory be not per
mitted to operate on Its present location
in a residence section because it is not
good public policy."
The City Council to-night, by a 6 to 5
vote, again 'gave a setback, to Councilman
John L. Howard's . proposal to allow the
Pacific Incinerating Company to make a
thirty days' test of Its plant at Twenty
sixth and Magnolia streets before a com
mittee which should .determine whether
the crematory Is a sanitary method of de
stroying the citj'3 waste. The further de
lay was caused by the adoption of Coun
cilman Meese's resolution to grant the
protesting Second Ward residents two
weeks' time in which to furnish a 110,000
indemnity bond to protect, the city against
a. law suit by the inctnereUhiff company.
'Attorney Creeley for the protestants, how
ever, declared that the bond would only
be given with the understanding that the
present effort to make the experimental
test be dropped. The vote on Meese's mo
tion to delay was as follows:
Aysâ Aitken, Baccus, Elliott, Fitzger
ald, Me Adam, Meese.
Noesâ Cuvellier, Howard, Pendleton,
Wallace, Dornin.
Councilman Howard at the outset urged
the adoption of the test plan, saying:
"I have taken my 9 per cent of the
eloquence that has been dispensed and
the browbeating and threatening to some
extent that has gone on over this crema
tory question. The incinerating company
had nothing to do with the resolution I
have offered. It was presented to expe
dite the settlement of this question if
possible. If the report of the committee
shall show that the crematory cannot be
operated without giving offense I will not
vote for the ordinance contract."
Councilman Elliott declared an injustice
had been done by locating the crematory
In the Second Ward. Colonel John P.
Irish, in a lengthy address, reviewed the
history of the crematory fight and said:

If It were merely a trade among home

As there is no time stipulation In fran
chises as to when they shall be accepted
or rejected by the Southern Pacific, and
as the attorneys for the corporation as
sert that the measures as passed will not
be accepted, the Alameda franchise mat
ter appears as far from being settled as
it has at any time since the agitation
commenced, four months ago.
"You may drive a horse to water, but
you cannot make him drink. We will not
accept either of these franchises." This
was the way Attorney Foulds expressed
himself after the passage of the ordi
nances. Attorney Shay said:
"We came here with Instructions from
Mr. Kruttschnttt not to accept these
franchises unless they were in a form
satisfactory to us. The City Trustees and
the City Attorney were distinctly told by
Mr. Kruttschnltt that under no conditions
would the franchises be acceptable unless
they were grlven for the corporate life of
the roads, that is. thirty-three years for
the South Side and forty-four years for
the North Side line."
City Trustees Dr. II. M. Pond. "W. M.
Bowers, B. E. Combs and C. J. Hammond
voted for the passage of the ordinances
after the amendments fixing their exist
ence at twenty-five years were made.
President J. F. Forderer â¢ voted against
the passage of both measures.
Trustee Combs moved the passage of
both ordinances, with Trustee Hammond
seconding. E. J. Blandlng wanted final
action on the ordinances deferred until
the Southern Pacific Company could be
requested to move its tracks from Pacific
avenue west of Fifth street. He said
that the corporation owned land In that
vicinity and should be compelled to util
ize Its own realty for its tracks.
Attorney Shay wanted the stipulation
in the franchise for the south side line
requiring the Southern Pacific to take
up Its tracks on Railroad avenue between
Fifth and Eighth streets six months af
ter the acceptance or the franchise
stricken out. Shay's reason for asking
this was that the same stipulation was
embodied in the franchise for the north,
side line and was therefore unnecessary.
Blandlngs' and Says' requests were un
heeded by the City Trustees and the or
dinances were passed without further
alteration.

Â¦William Young, who dramatized Gen
eral Wallace's book, has done as well as
could be done with his material. He has
presented a series of thirteen tableaux
that Illustrate the story In lucid and pic
turesque fashion, and that gives hand
somest opportunity for the superb set
tings that have been bestowed upon the
drama by the management.
There Is no need of a Bernhardt or
Mansfield in the cast, so It signifies little
that they are'not in evidence. The actors,
however, are quite sufficient to the need
of looking picturesque, which Is almost
all that is demanded of them.
The first scene â and it is to be remem
bered that the curtain goes up on it
promptly at S o'clockâ is of the meeting
of the three wise men in the desert. Sin
gularly impressive Is the picture, the
gathering together of the light that
actors did their best last night,
but were humble of taking the applause
heaped up for the pictures entirely, the
mos.t splendid of their kind seen here.
Reverently they remind of grand opera,
irreverently of "The Black Crook," but
comparably of no other production. An
audience that left its carriages by the
score on Mission street and brought all
of its diamonds along, filled the Grand
Opera-house frcm top to toe, and did its
best to give credit where credit was due.
In default of scenery that crooks the
pregnant knee It went to the actors, who
were as good scenery indeed as the rest.
And, as was said before, they humbly
acknowledged for the scenic artist, the
costumer and themselves as part of the
gorgeous picture-book, the applause
meant for all.

gotten but one thing in their pro

SPLENDID PRODUCTION OF "BEN HUR"
WITNESSED BY FASHIONABLE AUDIENCE
The Central delighted an Immense house
last night with a splendid production of
the stirring historical drama, "At Valley
Forge." There is a wealth of color In
the. play, and the stage setting and cos
tumes are brilliantly picturesque. As the
name suggests the plot Is founded on in
cidents of the dark days of the American
struggle for independence. The hpro . is
a captain under. Lishthorse Harry Lee,
and he Is captured while making love In
side the British lines. He has a Tory
nobleman as- a rival in love and this en
emy seeks j to ha.ve- him shot as a spy.
The glrlln the case uses diplomacy until
the right., moment comes . and then she
sets her, lover free in a sensational man
ner. â¢ One of the climaxes of the play la
capped by a gorgeous tableau of "Wash
ington crossing the ice-blocked Delaware,
and the T audlence demanded the effective
scene half a dozen times. Herschel Mayall
made a spectacular hit as the revolution
ary herq. and In his dramatic defense of
the heroine in the closing act, as well as
In his duel'scene with his Tory rival, he
roused the gallerles-to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm. In the thankless rol/'of
the tyrannical . British officer .Henry Shu
mer had the most difficult character In
the cast,' and to his able work was due
largely the success of the strongest scenes
of the. play. Elmer Booth supplied the
greater part ; of the comedy clement In
his, fine representation of the. blundering
Hessian ' commander,- and .' Edwin T. Em
ery contributed to the amusement by his
clever," Impersonation, of the over-polite
representative of King George. Ernest
Howell, as-a patriot, used his. opportuni
ties 'â¢ to ; excellent advantage, and George
Nicholls won" applause -in his part of the
British soldier with American sympathies.
Charming Eugenia Thais. Lawtoni was at
her best irt the role of the self-sacrificing
heroine, whose fidelity la rewarded In the
good old way when her hero brings the
news of Washington's final -triumph at
Yorktown.'-'Georgle Woodthorpe also de
serves 1 special -mention for her. commend
able Â¦ â¢work'- in';.the"*ilkable-- character of
Aunt Tabby,- an outspoken -friend . of the
rebels. "At Valley Forge" will draw big
audiences \ all this week.
{I* '-. * jsJiCSLZcLl â¢
The comedy- season was inaugurated at
the Alcazar- last night with a very, clever
production iof " "Too * Much Johnson," in
Central.
From the minute the curtain goes up
until the last boom of the kettledrums
there Is a zip and zlm to the piece which
carries It alpng in beautiful style. None
of these cut-and-dried musical comedies
Is "The Storks"â a few songs strung on
foolish dialogue. It has songs and good
ones; it has pretty girls and lots of them;
it has color thrown on with a lavish
brush.
In fact, it Is the brilliant setting and
the well-drilled and well-groomed chorus
which carries the piece. Very few musi
cal frivolities come out to the coast with
the richness of stage setting and wealth
of cloth of gold that Manager Tillotson's
company has. The night scene In the
second act, where a blood orange moon
rises over the hills of Nod and real (Chi
nese punk) fireflies flit between the wings,
is as pretty a stage picture as has been
presented here in several seasons.
"The Storks," at the Columbia this
week. Is the brightest, fluffiest thing that
has come our of the East in many moons.
It is all froth and bright colored bubbles,
but as a chromatic spectacle It beats the
old-fashioned kaleidoscope. A blaze of
many bewildering shades, a bevy of pret
ty faces over pretty shoulders, bright
songs, lots of ginger, and there you have
"The Storks."
Columbia.
Next is pictured the Roman gal>ey.
where Ben Hur. now a slave. Is chained
to his oar with a score of others, rowing
for dear life. The picture is most inter
esting and valuable as a correct repro
duction of a Roman galley. The tribune
Arrius, whom one meets here, has a sort
of Sunday-school "Boy-stood-on-the-burn-
Ing-deck" delivery that indeed afflicts all
the lesser members of the fast. A dark
change then shows Arrius and Ben Hur
cast on a raft from the wrecked galley,
and Arrius' promise to Ben Hur to make
him his heir and give him his name. The
sea scene is excellently handled.
Simonides, quietly and impressively
impersonated by Stephen Wright, and
Esther, his daughter, a slight but pretty
interpretation by Miss Julia Hearne,
are seen in their palace at An
tloch. To them Ben Hur comes
and is told of the slavery . of
these two to his household. Miss, Hearne
is the daughter of her father, James A.
Hearne, and shows decided promise in
her work. Simonides' house changes to
the Grove of Daphneâ as the author says,
"nobody can describe it â only beware."
It was begun by Apollo and completed by
him. He prefers it to Olympus. People
go there for one lookâ just oneâ and never
come away. They have a saytiig that
tells it all: "Better be a worm and feed
on the mulberries of Daphne, than ,a
king's guest." The picture is sumptuous
ly realized. Dancing girls, fauns, shep
"herds, little loves and taller loves, in cos
tumes the most beautiful, crowd in until
the great stage is a whirl of lovely color,
a Roman Venusberg. For this ballet;
alone worth going far to see, there has
been music written by Edgar Stillman
Kelley that admirably carries ' out Â¦ the
spirit of the scene. The big chorus sings
well and there are dances of charming
and characteristic sort.
The fountain of Castalia, revealed by a
rising backdrop, serves as background to
Introduce Iras the Egyptian' and r her
father Balthasar. A sumptuous ; figure
Miss Xelletae Reed is as the Egyptian,
carrying out fully the Circe suggestion
of the author. Ilderim, again, 'by
Charles M. Collins, is another portrait of
Oriental splendor.
The tent of Iras, another 'fine picture/
and a Nile scene de luxe follow, and pre
cede the extraordinary illusion. World
famous, of the chariot race. Sixteen
horses, !Â».rnessed to four chariots, are
here seen skimming away at the rate of
apparently a mile a minute. "Whips hiss,
sparks fly, the beasts ! bend and " quiver
and lean to their work, the ; background
races by, with its thousands of painted
faces, and the illusion is complete. All
but. Sometimes the chariot wheels don't
go round! Only last'night has the scene
been tried with sixteen horses. Not even
on Broadway, In New York, were the
stage exigencies capable of this experi
ment. The scene as given here ' is cer
tainly unique. It was a complete tri
umph last night and the audience howled
for the winner with the Hebrews and Ro
mans on the stage.'
The last scenes Include a dream picture
of Calvary that Is another picture not to
flames about them Into their star being
of the last word in lighting marvels.
The second picture is on the roof of
Ben Hur's palace in Jerusalem, whence, a
picturesque view of the city is gained.
Here one is introduced to Bon Hur, phys
ically very adequately realized by Wil
liam J. Kelly, and Messala, whom all con
spire â with ncaven knows what warrant â
to pronounce "Messaila." Alphonse
Dethier in the latter role succeeds in
breaking through the scenery not infre
quently. He gets out of the plcturebook
more than once, strikes the human note
gratefully. Mr. Dethier will be remem
bered as the^ romantic hero ot "Corlan
ton," the Mormon drama that Salt Lake
City sent us last year. Then and now
this virile and graceful young actor
seemed and seems fitted for more exact
ing roles. He has eminently the romantic
accent, a fine presence and a delightful
voice. Mr. Xelly, who has the same qual
ities in slighter degree but with less sug
gestion of experience, was comparably
less satisfying as Ben Hur than Mr.
Dethier as Messala.
The music of . "Rubes and Roses" is
bright and catchy and there Is plenty of
it, affording all the leading characters an
opportunity for a solo. Maud Amber,
graceful and sweet voiced, made a great
hit^ with -her solo, "If My Heart Had
"Wings," and -It wa3 encored again and
again. This success was followed with.
Mr. Dillon as Hiram Catchem, constable
of Lake County, Indiana, was a funny
travesty on the hayseed peace officer.
His fun is spontaneous and is of the kind
that lasts.
"Rubes and Roses" brought to Fischer's
last night a packed house, -a delighted
audience and two new stars, who received
a royal California greeting, and who well
deserved it. The new people are Ben T.
Dillon and Georgia O'Ramey, and they
had Â£not been on the stage two minutes
before the people saw that they were
crackajacks in their line. Miss O'Ramey
was Susie Snowbird, a guileless maid
from the bucolic precincts of Grassville
of the SI Hoijkins variety, but a little
different, and the difference was charm
ing. She made the audience laugh with
out half trying, and at the close of the
first act she had to come up to the foot
lights and make a little speech of thanks,
which she did very modestly and very
gracefully.

SCENES FROM THE SPECTACULAR DRAMA. "BEN HUR," THAT WAS
PRODUCED AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE LAST NIGHT BY
KLAW & ERLANGER'S SPLENDID COMPANY.
Since the death of Miss Clark, ner estate
has been a bone of contention between
McNutt Â¦ and. the disinherited sisters. It
commenced [ when McNutt ap'plleti,
through his son, Attorney Maxwell Mc-
Nutt, for letters of special adminis'mtlnr.,
alleging the estate was in such a condi
tion that it required immediate cai*. liis
petition was never granted, for he with
drew it in the face of the vigorous oppo
sition of the attorneys for Mrs. Hart and
Mrs. Carter, Though the will was in Mc-
Nutt's possession during all these proceed
ings, he did not file it until the very lost
of the thirty days in which the law pro
vides a will shall be held after thÂ» death
of its maker.
which the members of the new stock com
pany demonstrated not only their versa
tility, but their ability to do ample justice
to the parts intrusted to them. Chief
among the funmakers Is James Durkin,
who as Augustus Billings has the brunt
of the comedy work on his shoulders,
which certainly are broad ones and equal
to the emergency. Durkin enters Into the
spirit of the part and the ease with which
he gets out of trying situations excites
the admiration and risibles of the audi
ence. Marie Howe made an unmistakable
hit as the irascible mother-in-law and
contributed in no small way to the humor
of the piece, which is of the Infectious
sort. Miss Adele Block made a pretty pic
ture as Mrs. Augustus Blllinss, but the
part is not one to give full swing to her
dramatic powers. George Osbourne was
as ever reliable as Francis Faddish and
his initial entrance on the stage put the
audience at ence Into good humor. Fran
ces Starr, the ingenue, was graceful and
charming as Leonora Faddish, and Harry
S. Hilllard gave a splendid interpretation
of the boy lover, Henry Mackintosh. Too
much cannot be said of Fred J. Butler,
whose Joseph Johnson wjfs a fine bit of
character acting. John B. Maher was
excellent as Leon Dathis, the Frenchman,
who wants to kill somebody. The small
parts were in capable hands and the piece
is undoubtedly In for a good week's run.
The will of Isabella D. Clark, who com
mitted suicide at McNntt'a Hospital on
September 10 last, is the subject of a con
test that was brought yesterday by her
sisters, Alice Ann Hart of this city and
Mary E. Carter of Paris. They ask 'that
it be refused probate on the ground that
Miss Clark was incompetent at the time
It was made, the day before her death,
and that it was procured through the un
due influence of Dr. W. F. McNutt, who
is named in the will as executor, and to
whom the decedent left her library. The
rest of the estate, estimated to be- worth
$230,000, is in the will bequeathed to Grace
E. Strohn, another sister of the deceased,
who resides in La. Grange County, Illinois.
The contestants allege that they were
not mentioned in their sister's will be
cause McNutt, "by harsh, cruel and uo
true accusations," poisoned her mind
against them. They say that during her
entire life she always displayed great love
and affection for them, but that McNutt,
during the five years she was an inmate
of his hospital, obtained great influence
over her. She was mentally weak, t'aty
say, begause ef her ailments and . wat*
easily susceptible. They claim that during
all the five years, except at very rare in
tervals, he would not allow them co visit
her, oi any other physician or person to
treat her. They accuse McNutt of te-Hinif
the patient that the contestants cared
nothing for her, and of repeated*/ inter
fering in her business and domestic af
fairs. They denounce his interference aa
unwarrantable, and say that but for it
the will would never have been made.

LXBUGBES, . -iusSSJSar.The standard bearer spoke for clean
government, for a greater San Francisco
and for the welfare of Its inhabitants.
Mr. Crocker's speech was not unlike those
he has made before in the campaign. He
made no promises that he is not able
to keep when elected to the office to which
he aspires.
In opening the meeting Chairman Ryan
appealed to the assembled voters to think
well before entering the voting booths
and to vote for Henry J. Crocker and
the whole Republican tlcKet. as the can
didates on that ticket represented good
government.
"My friends," he said, "it is about time
for all thinking voters to stop and con
sider what is best for their interests.
We should have a man as Mayor of the
city who represents the best interests of
the city; who has been all his life an
honorable and distinguished citizen; who
has been a business man. The cry has
gone out for eucb a man as Henry J.

The Republican Campaign Committee
r.as gone over the field, district by dis
trict, and is thoroughly convinced that
Henry J. Crocker will get 25,000 votes to
day and be elected Mayor of San Fran
cisco. The committee is fully aware of
the fact that there is a good deal of
thouting- in the Schmitz camp, but inves
tigation brings to light the fact that most
of the noise is made by boys and paid
c!aqu<rs.
Lane expect* the silent vqje and his
evening paper is exploring the cemeteries
for it. Crocker knows that the business
men generally and a large following of
the Â¦workingmen will support the Repub
lican ticket in to-day's contest. A care
ful review of the situation justifies the
committee in predicting the election of
Crocker by a handsome plurality. The
vote will not be as large as first esti
mated. Considerable of the Schmitz fol
lowing Is unregistered, as many of his
shouters ere boys.
The situation '.Â« thus sized up in the po
litical camps: Crocker will win in the Tljir
ty-fourth. Thirty-fifth. Thirty-seventh,
Thlrty-fighth. Thirty-ninth. Fortieth. For
.ty-n'rst Forty-second and Forty-third dis
tricts. Schmitz will win In the Twenty
ninth. Thirtieth. Thirty-first, Thirty-sec
ond, Thirty-sixth and Forty-fifth dis
tricts.
LANE'S CHANCES.
Lane eta.n<1s a good chance for carry
ing the Twenty-eighth District, as the old
boss. Martin KHly. who has always main
tained a strong grasp on that district. Is
behind Lane in this campaign. Sam
Rainey. the old-time Democratic boss, is
dow.g politics with Ruef and Schmitz and
may give Kelly a hard fight In the Twen
ty-* ighth. The Republicans do not con
code the district to Kelly. The Repub
licans will give Schmitz a hard battle in
the Thirty-third District. The Forty
fourth is a big district. The Crocker
forces and aJso the Schmitz forces are
well organized. Ruef is spending money
lavishly to capture this district for
Schmitz. The Republicans are confident
of very large pluralities in the Fortieth,
Forty-first and Forty-second districts. It
is expected that each of these districts
will give the Republican ticket one thou
sand plurality.
Lane addressed a large audience at tha
pavilion last night, an audience very
nearly as large as the onÂ© that James G.
Maguire spoke to the night before his de
feat. It is called to mind that Demo
crats went down the line after the bis
Maguire demonstration at the pavilion
and bet their money freely that Maguire
would carry San Francisco on the follow
ing day.
REPUBLICANS WINNERS.
It happened the next day that the Re
publican candidate carried the town by
2500 majority. Lane is now appealing to
disgruntled Republicans. He fulled to de
velop any strength with the literal Ger
man element on account of hi3 prohibi
tion record and he failed to attract work
ingmen to his standard because he is
labeled as the candidate of Garin McNab.
Confusion and delay will attend the
counting of the ballots under the new law.
Conflicting advice has been given to citi
zens. The Democratic managers are en
deavoring to Impress upon the minds of
the voters a belief that the X should not
be stamped inside the circle at the head
of a party column. This kind of sugges
tion is all right for the minority party
to give, but not for the majority party to
accept. Not a mother's ton on the Dem
ocratic ticket can be elected without the
assistance of Republican votes. The fig
ures of the laet Presidential election and
of the last gubernatorial election show
that the Republicans have a clear ma
jority of 4D0O in San Francisco, and it
proper support to the excellent ticket is.
given every man on the Republican ticket
will be elected to-day. No wonder then
that the Democratic Registrar of Voters
and the Democratic campaign committee
advise against stamping Inside the circle.
WILL WATCH COUNT.
The Republican campaign committee
has made complete preparations for a
careful watch of the count. There are
many indications that crooked work will
be attempted in the Forty-third, Forty
fourth and Forty-fifth districts. A sharp
lookout will be established and the cam
paign committee may succeed* In landing
perjurers and false voters in the pen
itentiary.
The Registrar of Voters is inclined to
the belief that the total vote 4 to-day will
not exceed C7.O00. The Republican vote is
pretty well registered. The district clubs
of the party are working with a proper
method of bringing the registered voters
to the polls.
Voters should pay no attention to cam
paign slanders to-day. All sorts of lies
and slanderous statements concerning Mr.
Crocker and the Republican campaign
leaders will be put in circulation. Much
of this kind of contemptible work has
already been done to bolster up the fail
ing fortunes of Lane, but The Cail does
not imply that Mr. Lane is responsible for
It. The Republican campaign committee
ha? conducted the contest on honorable
linfs and Mr. Crocker haÂ« won a legion
of friends by his clean, truthful and man
ly canvass.

BOYS CHEER FOB. J&BE.
The speaker was interrupted: j by shouts
for Schmltz and he replied: "Let any one
who wants to shout for Schmlt* give three
cheers for Ruef," and the small boys In
the crowd took up the dare and raised
their shrill voices for the man; behind the
throne.
Then a good Republican shouted "Three
cheers for Henry J. Crocker!" and the
united voices of. the friends qÂ£ good gov
ernment made the welkin ring.
Mr. Crocker got Into the wagon at this
time and the crowd Immediately recog
nized him; The reception given,' to him was
almost an ovation. It was many minutes
before he .could speak. He'walted and
waited and, as soon as he started again,
the cheers for this ' popully:. candidate
filled the air. The noise was. accentuated
by the discharge of a flashlight. When
the cheering had subsided Crocker
spoke as follows:

R. J. Ince, alias Thomas Gray, was ar

The detectives say that Ince came from
the East recently with Parker, who has
not yet been arrested, with the evident In
tention of playing a swindling game.
They got 2000 cards of the "Monarch Sup

assemblage for the support of the Repub
lican ticket. He told of the necessity of
such action and his words made a deep
and lasting impression 'on his auditors.
SUGGESTION TO LABOR.
Mr. Van der Naillen suggested to work
ingmen that the best thing they could do
was to strengthen their own organiza
tions and then senuÂ» for the various politi
cal parties and tell them what they
wanted and he f elf sure they would only
be too willing to obey their requests. Mr.
Van der Naillen also told of his being ap
pointed a member of the Board of Public
Works and of the compliment paid to him
by Mayor Schmltz, who told him he had
made a fine public official and was doing
his duty.
He charged Abe Ruef with getting him
ousted from his position. He said It was
because of Ruef's opposition that he was
not reappointed to the position. He told
of- the fine character of Henry J. Crocker.
He said he spoke for the Republican
ticket. He paid a high tribute to the men
who are on the ticket and appealed to the
workingmen to give the ticket their sup
port.
Maxwell McNutt. a candidate for Su
pervisor, was the next speaker intro
duced and he was given a kindly recep
tion. Mr. McNutt said he had addressed
thousands of voters during the campaign
and was deeply grateful for the generous
greetings extended to him. He assured
the voters that if he was elected Super
visor he would give his closest attention
and would endeavor to serve the whole
people fairly and squarely. â¢
Charles Alpers, a resident of the Mis
sion and a citizen who has always taken
a deep Interest in municipal affairs, next
addressed the crowd. Mr. Alpers afforded
great amusement by rhyming his re
marks. He also made a strong argument
In favor of the Republican ticket. He
said Mr. Crocker was the sort of a .man
that should be in the Mayor's chair and
If elected would give the people the kind
of government that they have clamored
for for the last few years.
Henry Manning, a friend of Henry H.
Lynch, candidate for Sheriff, was next
introduced by Mr. -Ryan and told of Mr.
Lynch's attitude toward labor. He told
how Mr, Lynch had given employment to
men that had been discharged from the
Sutter-street road while he was con
structing the Powell-street line. He nar
rated instances of Mr. Lynch's gener
osity and of the assistance he has al
ways rendered those in need. "Henry H.
Lynch." he said, "is the kind of a marl
we ought to elect. lip Is * good citizen
has a big heart and will give the people
a good, clean administration."
BAHRS' CAMPAIGN.
John J. Hourlgan took up the cudgels
for his friend, Judge George H. Bahrs
the strenuous campaigner, who Is a can
didate for Assessor. He apologized for
Mr. Bahrs absence by saying that the
Judge had attended three other meetings
and was detained. He told of the Bahrs
Volunteers, who, he said, numbered at
least 24,000, and he said if they did their
duty at the polls to-day Judge Bahrs'
from start to finish. I have ultimate
faith, as I have stated to the people
throughout this campaign. In the people
of San Francisco and in their own good
Judgment. I believe to-morrow will show
a glorious victory. I believe that the peo
ple of this city will elect a government
that goes with the charter and with the
bond issue. I believe that they will elect
the whole Eepublican ticket. (Applause.)
You people have done me the honor of
nominating me for this high office and in
return I will do you the honor of a clean
administration. The people to-morrow
are going to show where they will place
their confidence. I think you will use
wisdom and so to the polls and stand by
the ticket. I say you will go to the polls
and vote for a government that Is free
from entanglements." (Three cheers for
Henry J. Crocker. There were cries for
Schmitz and Mr. Crocker said:
"I say, ladles and gentlemen, that this
Is the first audience that Mr. Schmitz has
presented to me that has not been gen
tlemanly in character. I say even to the
Schmitz men that if the people elect me
Mayor of this city they will be proud of
the government I will give them.
REPRESENTS NO CLASS.
"I am no class candidate, ladies and
gentlemen. I have been brought up with
the name class that you have. I have
been taught to. earn my own living and
have been taught to be a gentleman
throughout. My schooling and education
have been no better than yours. My
habits in this world have only' been those
of a good citizen. I have gone through
this world with honor tQ myself and my
family. If I am elected at this time I
will try to live up to the standard which
our common schools teach us (Ad

"I say this without fear, that If I am
elected I can go into office and give the
city the same kind of an administration
that I have advocated in my addresses to
the people. I can give you a clean one and
I can go into office and have no side
shows.
"The Republican party for the first time
in years is united and It has divested Itself
of bosses. Some so-called Republicang
are going out and trading for votes They
are ,not Republicans and are not good

"In conclusion I want to say I have
been dea# and burled in this campaign
several times and even my opponents, ad
mit that I am one of the kind of neoDle
that don't stay dead. When I go Into a
fight of this kind, gentlemen, I go into
it to win. (Cries "You are a winner ")
"I say after one, month of campaigning
I have never lost my voice or my nerve
and I say again that if I am elected I
will five you an honorable administration
and It will be an energetic one. I thank
you. (Great cheering.) I w i sh to thank

Good citizeni have a choice between

Crocker is a vote for honest government
and against thievery.
Crocker. (Applause.) We want a busi
ness man at the head of the city. Why
should we always accept the represen
tative of Abe Ruef? Why should we put
into public office a professional politician?
Why not have a man In office who will
be true to you and true to every obliga
tion he makes when he is sworn In as
Mayor of San Francisco?
"My friends, 1 say It is the time for
you worklngmen to think. I say to you,
you must not follow false gods and false
idols, as they will prove false to you.
The present Mayor of San Francisco has
not only violated his promises but has
broken his pledges to the people and to
you, who are cheering for him here to
night. Two years ago, when Mayor
Schmitz started out for office, the unions
were undivided and came forward with
solid ranks and solid front for him. To
day we find a division in their ranks; we
find the unions supporting the three par
ties. The very moment that dissension
creeps into the organization it means the
disintegration of the union. Workingmen
represent the strength and muscle and
brawn of the land and If they stand to
gether they can rule all politics, and all
parties will come to them. (Applause.)
SCHMITZ IS OWNED.
"Then why accept any particular man
and place him at the head of the city gov
ernment when he must pay tribute to an
other, when in every act and every deed
he does he must seek the advice and coun
sel and the opinions of another man. who
was never elected to office? (Cries of 'Abe
Ruef.') Yes. my friends, that's the man
and when you elect .the Union Labor can
didate you are represented by him.
"To-morrow when you gjo to the polls
and cast your ballot you will cast your
vote for a man who loves his city and
who has Its improvement at heartâ Henry
J. Crocker. (Cheers for Crocker.)
"My friends, make no mistake. Remem
ber that Henry J. Crocker comes from
his place of business in order that the
fair name of the city that he loves so
well shall .be properly run. And remem
ber, my friends, that a city Is only splen
did in the splendor of her citizenship. So
I say to'you that Henry J. Crocker stands
for good, government and he stands for
everything that is decent In the city of
San Francisco. And I say to you to-mor
row night when the votes are counted the
next Mayor will be Henry J. Crocker.
(Great applause and cheers for Crocker.)
"I wish to take the opportunity of in
troducing as the next speaker Mr. Edgar
D. Peixotto." b
Mr. Peixotto had to wait a few minutes
until the cries for Crocker subsided be
fore attempting to speak. When quiet
was restored Mr. Peixotto spoke as fol
lows:
"Ladies and Gentlemen: This is indeed
a novelty in the Republican ranks, but we
are willing to meet you In our halls, in
our homes and on our streets. This is a
campaign that we want to make from our
housetops, from our parks, our streets or
anywhere else. Tou don't know what it
means to you. Are our citizens going to
be fools arid allow an artful politician to
control the city? If I put on my coat and
said It contained a union label and you
HENRY J. CROCKER closed his
campaign lasÂ£ night by address
ing three thousand voters who
crowded round an express
wagon, from which he spoke.
The outdoor meeting was held on Stock
ton street, opposite Union Square Park.
Its success was assured long before
Chairman Daniel Ryan called the meet
ing to order. The express wagon, with
Its glaring lights, and the brass band,
with its blare of trumpets, attracted
throngs to the spot. When Mr. Crocker
jumped into the wagon he was given an
old-time rally. Small boys attempted to
stampede the meeting for Schmitz by
yelling for the candidate of the Union
Labor party, but their feeble cries were
drowned by the mighty shouts for Henry
J. Crocker. â¢
Two immense crowds were addressed
during the course of the evening. The
first gathering filled Stockton street, near
Market, and when the isues of the cam
paign had been explained to them and
they had lost their voices yelling for the
Republican standard bearer, the wagon
was driven further up the street and an
other big crowd assembled.
The success of the two meetings
brought home to the minds of the cam
paign committee that outdoor meetings
In this Ideal weather were valuable to
the cause. Citizens on their way to places
of amusement paused to listen to the
orators and cheer for the ticket. Men
who did not care to be hedged in by the
walls of a big hall stood for an hour and
enjoyed the arguments set forth by the
various speakers. Friends of Henry H.
Lynch and Judge Bahrs raised their
voices for those two popular candidates.
Mr. Crocker was interrupted at the out
set of his speech by the noisy adherents
of Mayor Schmltz. Mr. Crocker appealed
to them for fair play and the disturbers
were shamed into being quiet. At an
other time newcomers attempted to cheer
for Schmltz, but they were startled by
the tremendous shout for Crocker that
rent the air and echoed in the distance.

Jointly interested with the Guggenhelma
in the famous Esperanza mine la Mexico.
Sunday night, however, they departed
for the couth, having learned that the
deal with thÂ© English company would go
through. They were prepared to take
over the mine on the advice of John Hays
Hammond and other representatives of
the Guggenheim syndicate's engineer
corps, who. It Is said, have already exam
ined the Dolores and are now with the
Guggenheim brothers In Colorado looking
over mining properties there.
Friday evening last there arrived here
from Mexico in a special car \V. K. Ryan.
son of Thomas F. Ryan, the New York
millionaire, and R. M. Dudley, both well
known mining men of Mexico, who are
connected with the Guggenheim syndi
cate, the American Smelter. Company and
other big enterprises. For two days they
were in conference with the owners of the
Dolores mine and frankly admitted that
the purpose of their visit was to buy the
property in the event of the Venture Cor
poration withdrawing ItB offer.
COME TO BUY MINE.
Several cays ago it was reported that
the Venture Corporation had decided to
forfeit its bond of purchase of Â£5,000 and
abandon the deal, and this rumor gained
strength when it was learned that other
persons were trying to secure the mine.
Gow was formerly the American repre
sentative of the last named corporation,
and when its shareholders learned of his
Interest in the Dolores mine they brought
suit In the United States court, claiming
a share in his holdings, basing their claim
on a written contract with Gow to the
effect that the company should enjoy the
profits of any mining venture undertaken
by him during his connection with their
company. During the pendency of this
suit, which was finally compromised by
Gow, who is said to have paid the Scotch
pecple something like Jl'XvJOO, the nego
tiations for the sale of the Dolores mine
were delayed.
About a year ago E. A. Wiltsee, former
ly of this city and resident manager of
the Venture Corporation, with a corps of
engineers made a thorough examination
of the Dolores mine, and shortly after,
in company with Frederick Baker, the
general manager cf the English concern,
came to this city and entered into nego
tiations with the owners for the purchase
of the property. Yesterday was the final
date for payment on the mine and in the
meantime local mining men, who were
acquainted with the property, have been
speculating en the ultimate result of the
transaction.
After mcr.ths of haggling over the- price
asd other conditions of sale, a famous
Mexican mining property, the Dolores
mine, has finally passed to the control of

was cabled by the foreign corporation to
the Anglo-Californian Bank. In which the
deeds to the property have been in escrow
for over a year, thus Insuring the trans
fer.
The sale of the Dolores mine carries
with it considerable local Interest In view
of the fact that the original owners of
the mine are local people, who practically
purchased the property for a song, and
with the aid of but little capital saw
their mine raoidly develop into what is
now considered cne of the richest in Mex
ico. It is situated in the northern part
of the State of Chihuahua, near the line
cf the Chihuahua and Pacific Railway,
and during the past few months has been
the subject of negotiations between its
owners and the representative of a num
ber of the larger mining firms of this
cour.tr>- and England. The bulk of its
stock was held by E. A. Stent, P. G.
Gow and George Beveridge, well-known
local mining men, A. D. Harrison and
James E. Bell of Catton. Bell & Co.,
Charles J. O'Kell and others of this city.
Of these Gow controlled 52 per cent of
the stock, a fact which has cost him no
end of litigation with the Scotch syndi
cate, which controls the Juniper mine.

The Lone meeting at Mechanics' Pa
vilion last night drew a tremendous
crowd that filled the building to Its ca
pacity.
The overflow adjourned to a vacant lot
across the street and there was address
ed by prominent candidates on the Demo
cratic ticket.
Lane arrived about 19 o'clock. His ap
pearance on the street was the sign for
a great ovation. Men and women arose
and cheered him, while many waved
small American flags.
He announced at the start that numer
ous outdoor speeches had played havoc
with his voice and begged bis audience
to be as quiet as possible, which request
they solemnly adhered to, except when
they burst Into applause, which fre
quently punctuated j his remarks. He
said in part:
"I cannot begin v to express to you my
feelings at this magnificent reception. I
have always been a friend to the public,
and I knew that many of you were
friends of mine, but I had nojdea I had
such an Immense number of people Inter
ested in me and the cause I represent. I
did not seek this nomination, but I am
proud to think that I accepted It. because
I am now confident that the people of
this city want to see me in the Mayor's
chair, and it is now up to you to carry
me there. If you put me there I am go
ing to give you a plain, honest, clean ad
ministration which will accord justice to
all who come to me to seek It. I own
myself and I have no bos3. I want to
see every citizen in this commonwealth
have his full rights. I believe in a gov
ernment that i3 not ruled by any class
party.
"The other day I addressed a great
(Crowd of worklngmen and the hall was
packed full. The next day It was stated
that I had thirty people present and they
were mostly small boys. The day fol
lowing I addressed a still greater crowd
and it was stated there were thirty-five
people present. I want to speak a word
to my Republican friends. I mean those
that want a clean administration of the
affairs of the municipality. I want to
ask them to break away from partisan
ship and support me in a cause that they
know is true and right, and a cause that
If upheld will result in the greatest ben
efits to all of those who have the welfare
of the city at heart.
"I have nothing to say in any way det
rimental to Mr. Crocker; he has the re
spect and esteem of the public at large,
but he cannot get the votes south of
Market street, and without those votes
he cannot be elected. I am confident I
will get votes in every district. It Is
not the glory of the proud position of
the Mayor that I am seeking; it is that
I want to serve my city and do all the
good I can for it. I am loyal to the
pepole and I know in this great fight
they will be loyal to me. This great
outpouring to-night shows me that the
Democrats who left our party are now
coming back to the ranks and are joining
in a great tidal wave that will sweep us
on to victory. Are you willing to turn
the administration of the government to
Abe Ruef? Do you want Abe Ruef to
say how and where the $17,<v>0,000 shall
be spent? No, of course you do not; you
want to see that every dollar of that
money will go into the exact channel for
which It was intended.
"Now, my friends, I want you to get
out of this mlanna and fog and come
out inÂ» the bright shining light of day.
Sacrifice partisanship In the name of hon
or. In the name of righteousness and
truth, and uphold the men who will fight
for those principles and who will give
to you justice and a true and honest ad
ministration of the city's" affairs."
Herbert Choynski was chairman of the
occasion. Speeches were also made by
Frank Gould. Thomas Hickey. Colonel
Thomas Barry. Charles Dwlght. Judge
James G. Magulre and Joseph E. O'Don
nell.
The Union Labor party held one of tHo
largest meetings of the campaign last
night at the Alhambra Theater. The
large hall was filled to the. doors with aa
enthusiastic crowd. Those who were, un
able to get into the theater stood in thÂ»
street in front of the place and listened
to the bands Ruef had hired and to thÂ«
hired orators of the Labor party.
It was evident that the large crowd as
sembled had come more out of curiosity
than for any particular desire to hear the
speakers rail at ths candidates of thÂ«
other tickets. The Socialist party candi
dates were the only ones that didn't get
rapped.
Ellery's Italian Band was hired for thÂ«
evening and succeeded by its fine* musio
in drawing a crowd. Bits of other talent,
mostly of the amateur order, appeared to
amuse the assemblage and endeavor to
hold them until the various candidates
could get a chance to gain their audi
ence.
It appeared as if the whole mass of
Lnion Labor voters was out In force,
and, if it was. the showing does not
augur well for the re-election of Eugena
Schmitz, for five thousand would cover
the number In the house and on thÂ«
street.
DEVOTO RAILS LONG.
The banner "knocker" speech was de
livered by James A. Devoto. It was a
repetition of his same old speech that has
grown time-worn and frayed at the edges
by the hard work it has been subjected
to during the campaign. The speaker
also brought in all of the slurs and mud
slings ever used by the other candidates
in their mad scramble for an office and a
few of the city's good dollars. Devoto
talked on everything but campaign issues.
After he had exhausted his vocabulary
of \iciou3 slurs he soared Into the fiowery
eloquence so delighted in by amateur
speakers and referred to the boundless
Pacific, the setting sun. the Golden Gate
and other high-sounding phraaes In a
vain attempt to impress hi3 audience wtt&
his greatness and the possibilities of the-
L nion Labor party. His speech, however
failed to impress, and the crowd howled
for more entertainment. A quartet was
called on the stage and by its er.deavora
the people were held so that another can
didate could get a chance at them
Powel Fredrick, candidate for the of
fice of County Clerk, was next called on.
He called the attention of the voters to
a i leged deflclt o{ between CO.000 and
J40.0CO in the office to which he aspires
He said that the office had been in the
hands of one political crowd for the last
ten years. The only way this evii could
be rectif.ed was to elect him to the offlce
SCHMITZ ARRIVES.
Mayor Schmitz arrived late and was
given a rouslr.gr reception. He made a
brief speech, going over the old issues
again. He asked the pecple to elect him
again, as the city was about to spend
J1S.COO.000 voted for its embellishment Ind
needed an honest man and honest Board
of Supervisors to control that vast sum
cf money. He pointed with pride to his
past administration and said that the
next one. If there was one. would be bet
ter. He promised to always be the friend
of the laboring man and said that he
would always be proud to be a friend of
the plain people from whose rank3 he had
sprung and who he would ever treat fair
ly and squarely.
"I shall ever have for my slogan " h*
said, "equal rights to all and special priT
ileges to none."
â¢This has been a hard campaign." hÂ»
continued, "and without the aid of a sin
gle newspaper we shall be victorious.
Let us roll up a majority that will startle
the whole country, and let it be heralded
forth that San Francisco has triumphed
for the cause of Justice and right. Get up
early and stamp your cross in the clrcls
at the head of the Union Labor ticket and
elect to offlce men that will servo you
faithfully and honestly.
"We will win by a big majority and
then equal rights will be given to all and
special privileges to none."
The meeting broke up with three cheers
for Schmitz and the noisy crowd cf boys
ar.d young men started dotfn the street
to march for their standard bearer.
Citizens should bear in mind that a
vote for lane Is in effect a vote for Bnef

J. W. Keys, who is attorney ad litem for
the minor children, stated to Judge Len
non that he did not understand perfectly
the account as filed by Attorney Cochran<s
for the guardian, Mrs. Mary Emily Page
Kettler. He declared that the account
contained errors and duplications.
Attorney Thomas P. Boyd. who was sub
stituted last week as attorney for Mrs.
Kettler, instead of Cochrane, put Mrs.
Kettler upon the stand to testify as to
Cochrane's method in handling the es
tate. She said she did not know of any
error in the statement and had relied upon
her att6rney and his brother. M. F. Coch
rane. as her counsel and financial ad
visers that all items were correct .
M. F. Cochrane had, it was stated, re
ceived J16S0 and expended $2105 80, for
which he had vouchers, thus leaving the
estate in debt to him. Attorney J. W.
Cochrane had never handled any money
of the estate. The court decided to have
another hearing of the matter next Mon
day.
The Kettler estate Is valued at between
$400,000 and $500,000. Many years ago J. C.
â¢â¢Beidman died and left a large fortune. A
life annuity he bequeathed to W. B.
Kettler. At his death the money was to
be for the benefit of his children. Kettler
died several years ago and left five chil
dren, the oldest at the present time being
14 years of age and the youngest 3 years.

One of the five regiments of the First

strengthen the right wing; the remaining
four were directed toward a strip of wood
on the right cf the division, in which the
firing had become very heavy and where,
according to the report of some of the
staff officers of the First Corps, Imme
diate aid was needed. Two regiments, the
One Hundred and Fifty-seventh New York
and the Sixty-first Ohio, were guided by
one of their officers, while the other two,
the Eighty-second Illinois and the Forty
fifth New York, were led by my chief
of staff. Lieutenant Colonel Otto of the
Fifty-eighth New York.
"It had meanwhile become quite dark,
the direction of the fight being indicated
by nothing but the sound of musketry.
The regiments entered the woods with the
greatest determination and drove the en

"It Is my pleasant duty to mention as
especially deserving, the names of Lieu

"Colonel Salomon Joined this brigade
with his regiment at the opening of the
campaign against Atlanta in the spring of i
1S64. During the fighting before Resaca,
Ga., on the 14th and 15th of May this
regiment behaved with great gallantry.
"Again at New Hope, Ga., on the 25th
of the same month, the Â¦ colonel led his
command with great coolness and cour
age against an enemy; after having ad
vanced against a severe fire of musketry
and artillery more than a mile.he held his
line close to the entrenched position of
the enemy, without a breastwork and
with a scant supply of ammunition.
"At the battle near Peach Tree Creek,
before Atlanta, Ga., on the 20th of July,
1S64, Colonel Salomon performed a most
gallant and meritorious part in impuls
ing the repeated onslaughts of the ene

his line for four hours, when the enemy
withdrew from his front with great loss.
"During the siege of Atlanta Colonel
Salomon was ever prominent for his en

Thus thousands of the individual members of tlie council, desiring to perpetuate that body
and to live in the security of its protcctu^g arm, have risen up as one man, free and independent
of the council, to elect Henry J. 'Crocked Mayor.
This action is taken for the purpose of driving from our city, home and fireside a govern
ment of graft, graft, graft.
You ask us why we support Crocker and not Lane. We answer because Crocker is .
stronger than Lane. f . Â¦
You ask us why Crocker is stronger than Lane. We answer, because two-years ago over
16,000 Democratic votes zvere taken outpf the lap of the Democratic party by appealing to the
prejudice and passion and hate of the mhsses and placed in the column of Schmitz, from which
vote Lane, at best, can only expect a smaU part. This is best shown by the reception accorded Lane
in those districts lieretofore intensely Democratic, and from which Crocker and no other Republi
can could expect more than his party strength. But in those districts to-day Crocker is stronger
than Lane.
We differ with Mr. Lane in his opinion of the division of the Republican voteâ rand in do
ing so occupy a better position to know than does Mr. Lane. Since our sole desire is to rid this
city of Schmitz, let us have the facts as they exist. i
When Lane ran for Governor thousands of Republicans were shouting against Pardee.
Pardee was bitterly denounced by certain elements supporting Lane.
Every man who denounced Pardee voted for Lane, and zvith all only 33,743 votes were
cast for Lane. Add together the vote cast tzvo years ago for Tobin ( 12,700) and Schmitz (21,
700), and it aggregates 34,400, practically the same vote received by Lane in the gubernatorial
fight. This shozvs conclusively that the Republican votes then fighting Pardee and now in the
Schmitz column zvere cast for Lane, leaving Pardce's 24,106 a.? the inalienable Republican vote
of San Francisco at that time, to which must be added the natural increase, which is Republican.
To which must be further added thousands of labor votes, not one of which Pardee gotâneces
sarily bringing the Crocker vote to 29/000 or 30,000.
It foil ozvs that a Republican vote cast for Lane is a vote for Schmitz, because Schmits 1
vote comes almost entirely from the Democratic party, therefore every citizen, Democrat or Re
publican, desirous of defeating Schmitz should cast his vote for Crocker â because no matter
hozv strong Lane's personal friends may endeavor to shozv him to be, he cannot come within sev
eral thousand votes of defeating Schmi{z; and it resolves itself into a matter of expediency that
in order to defeat Schmitz all good cit&ens must rally to Henry J. Crocker.

BY ALBERT PATSON TERHC.VE,
<AlhJetlc ICx^rt New York Ewnln* World.
Author of "Mu*cle Bulldtag," etc.)
A threat writer once said:
"During the accomplishment of any
thing that is really worth the doing, there
is a) way 6 at least one 'sticking point.' "
- In nothing is this more true than ln
lcarn'.r.K to box. There are three distinct
â¢â¢eticklrg places" in the path, of the boy
* ho is beginning to box.
The first ts learning what 1Â« known as
THE civilized world is impressed by the threatening fire
in the Vatican, becauses it reverses the idea that that
great structure, with its stores of art and sacred and
secular history, was fireproof. The building, with its ample
patio of gardens, stands on the Vatican Hill, and was erected
in 1145-53 by Pope Eugenius III as one of the Papal resi
dences. After the transfer of the Holy See from Avignon
to Rome it became the palace of the Pope, and the original
structure has been added to by successive Popes, until it is
the most remarkable assemblage of buildings in the world.
Its art treasures probably exceed those of any other collec
tion, and its literary store is a mine of, ecclesfastical and
secular history. There are kept the original manuscript of
the Scriptures, and the parchment treasures of many lands
and all ages. The destruction of the venerable pile would
inflict a loss upon the world.
Pope Pius X is a practical man, and will doubtless learn
from this threatening fire that modern means of fire-proofing
must be applied to prevent irreparable loss. It is a revela
tion of the housekeeping arrangements of the Papal resi
dence that the conflagration started from the kitchen stove
of one of the officers of the household. It would be a strange
result, by some held to be providential, if this accident
should be the means of an entente between the Papacy and
the kingdom of Italy. For the first time since the inclusion
of the states of the church in the kingdom the civil officers
of the city of Rome and of the King of Italy entered the
precincts of the Vatican, in interested co-operation with^jhe
Pope, to arrest the fire. According to the radical views of
some the civil officers should have been pleased to see the
whole pile burn. But, on the contrary, they manifested as
much anxiety as the Pope himself for the safety of the build
ing and its treasures. Out of this may well issue a result
which is believed in some quarters to be the purpose of the
new Pope, in the form of an understanding that will termi
nate the constructive imprisonment of the Holy Father.

IT appears that, in the face of the Russian pretense that
her presence in Manchuria is necessary to protect the
country from bandits, she has had in her employ the chief
bandit of that province, on whose head China had set a
price. The Chinese officers caught him and immediately
proceeded to separate him from* his head. At this Russia
took umbrage and made it an excuse for the armed re
occupation of Moukden. This was followed by a demand
that China behead the officer who had beheaded the robber!
This is a Western lesson in justice for the benefit of the be
nighted Chinese heathen!
Poor China cries out to the Western nations for help
and advice, confessing herself powerless to resist the mon
strous claims and immoral policy of Russia. Will she get it?
Is there that refined sense of justice in Europe, where lies
the right, to interfere, that the United States showed in go

The prize servant girl story comes from
Mare Island. It was told the other day
by the wife of a high naval official' to a
number of naval officers and their wives
who were traveling from the navy yard
to. this city on the naval tug Unadllla.
"I secured thl3 servant of mine in Phil
adelphia just two years ago." said the
victim of the kitchen mechanic. "Three
days after she arrived from the old coun
try she took service under me. She was
lamentably ignorant of the art of cook
ing, but I became attached to her and
when my husband was ordered West I
took her out with me.
"Kitty was the only servant I brought
out. She knew a little something about
cooking, so I thought we would be able
to get along for a time at least. Well,
one day, a miserably hot one. I told
Kitty that we would not bother about a
hot lunch, but would make a light meal
out of cake and a delicious watermelon
I had purchased in {own that morning.
About 1 o'clock I entered the dining room
with my husband and, calling Kitty from
the kitchen, told her we were ready for
lunch.
"She looked a bit flustered and. to my
surprise, said: "I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's
not ready."
" 'Ready.' I exclaimed, 'why, there is
nothing to prepare. You know I told you
we only wanted a little cake and the wa
termelon.*
" "I know that, ma'am.' she said, with
tears in her eyes, 'and here is the cake.
but the melon ain't ready. I've been

x Statuette 6500 Years Old.
In his article on the "Ten Temples of
Abydos" in Harper's Magazine for No
vember, Professor Flinders Petrie tells of
his discovery of a statuette of Ivory more
than 6500 years old, and how he managed
to preserve It.
"Groping In the thick brown organic
mud of this rubbish-hole." ?ays Professor
Fettle. "I lifted out one by one the price
less examples of glazed work and Ivory
of this earliest age of great artâ an art of
which we had never understod the excel
lence from the traces hitherto known. The
ivory was sadly rotted, and could scarcely
bo lifted without dropping asunder In
flakes. So when I found that I had
touched a piece it was left alone, and
other parts were cleared, until at last a
patch of' ground was left where scvÂ«.rvÂ»l
pieces of ivory had been observed. Cut
ting deep around this, I detachei tho
whole block of sixty or eighty pounds of
earth, and had It removed on a trav to
my storeroom. There it dried sraduÂ«Uy
for two or three weeks; and then with a
camel's-halr paint-brush I began to gently
dissect It and to trace the ivory rigttrts.
Not a single piece was broken or spoJ't
by thus working it out. and noble figures
of lions, a bear, a large ape and several
boys came, gradually to light. Suddenly
a patterned robe and then a marvellous
face appeared In the dust, and there came
forth from his 6000-year sleep one of the
finest portrait figures that have ever been
seen. A single photograph can give but
little Idea of the subtlety, of the face and
the expression, which changes with every

The true history of the capture of Ah
Sing la this: Officer John Oallaway. who
now patrols Market street during the
morning watch, was one of the squad,
and in order to capture a notorious gam
bling game that had previously defied
the squad disguised himself, unknown to
his comrades, in truly Chinese costume,
with the tan colored features. This was
done at a eostumers, and when so dis
guised Gallaway stepped out on the street
at 8 o'clock in the evening and went to
Chinatown, where his presence was no
ticed by the sergeant in charge on ac
count of his failure to ape the peculiar
Chinese shuffle In his gait. The disguised
"cop" made several tours through the
back alleyways, until he entered a notor
ious gambling Joint.
As soon as he was seen to enter the
squad raided the place and bagged thir
teen Mongolians. Including Gallaway. The
whole bunch were escorted to the station
house and locked up. including the dis
guised, who had a lot of lottery tickets
on his person. After being confined in
a cell for an hour or so Gallaway washed
the tan from his face and appeared at
the wicket door with one of his pleasant
smiles and asked the trusty to tell Desk
Sergeant Bldwell to come, as he wished
to speak to him. When Bidwell saw the
broad face of Gallaway In the wicket he
almast fainted from astonishment. A
short explanation convinced the prison
keeper of the ruse and Ah Sing was lib
erated under pledge not to give the thing
away to the newspaper reporters.
â¢ "The Chinatown squad wad highly
elated last night over the capture of Ah
Sing, one of the most notorious gamblers
In Chinatown." Such were the lines ap
pearing in the morning papers some time
ago. The true history of the arrest of
Ah Sing and how the Chinatown squad
had been fooled bv one of its own mem
bers never saw daylight, for the simple
reason that the sharp sleuths did not
wish their discomfiture to be known to
their comrades on the force.

This was as far as we ever got with
our "interview." What Monsieur de
Blowitz really thinks of womenâ the wo

main unknown, except as he pictured

I went to cee Monsieur de Blowitx with
the line already to cast, because the
greatest of all interviewers has an un

Esther Brooke, in an English magazine.
"It Is very kind for you to receive m*."
I safd, "for you. Monsieur de Blowlti,
more than any other person have every
reason to know whether the story of tha
influence of women In the affairs of na
tions Is true or only a pleasing myth."
He became grave at once, and lifting
his eyes upward he said impressively:
"Whatever man has accomplished,
whether it ba In art or In war, the secret
spring to all his endeavors has always
been woman. The motive power of thÂ«
world Is not Â«>teara. Is not the latest discov

It Is woman." Splendid! I thought; he will

But far in excess of this chemical action
<>t water in QtMMolvtng the rocks Is its me
cha.nic.il action. Some streams are iÂ»l
vays muddy. AH streams are muddy dur
ing high crater. By estimating the flow
fit a stream and the amount of sediment
carried alonÂ»r in every gallon of water at
different stages of Its flow, it Is possible
to get a fair estimate of the total amount
of material carried off from the drainage
basin In any given time. Such estimates
have bec-n very carefully made by the
United States Government with reference
to the Mississippi. Every one knows that
the lower M'ssisslppi Is very muddy, and
that a considerable amount of sediment
will settle in even a tumbkrful of water.
Indr-ed, the cities alor.g the Mississippi
and Its larc^r tributaries are often taunt
ed with drinking make-believe lemonade,
and It Is said that those who drink Mis
souri River water before It settles are
compelled to pick their teeth after every
glafs. while those who use it as-sert that
the settling of the sediment acts like a
filter, and purifies the water.
The actual investigations of Humphreys
and Abbott, the engineers who had the
work In charge, showed that In the lower
Mississippi one fifteen hundredth of the
water by weight was sediment, and that
In addition a large amount of gravel and
sand was constantly being pushed along
the bottom of the river. Altogether they
found <hat 750.0Ci0.000 cubic feet of tand,
earth and gravel were being carried every
year into the Gulf of Mexico by this
river alone. This would form a prism 268
feet in height, with a base of one square
mile, and would weigh the enormous
amount of 812.500.000,000 pounds. This
would make every year a railroad em
bankment fifty feet wide and twenty-six
feet high, more than 1000 miles long, or
a mountain a mile square and a mile high
every twenty years.
The water of nearly all our rivers and
lakes is "hard"; that is. it contains a
vmall per c*Â«nt nt limr and other soluble
eltmer.ts which it has removed from the
soil an it has filtered through. It is these
impurkieiÂ». affecting even the clearest
lookinjt water, which cause the accumu
lation of "fur" in*ide of boilers and tea
kettles and which counteract the effects
of soap in washing. It !s estimated that
In Europe forty-eight tons of lime, mag
resia. potash, soda, salt and sulphuric
ard phosphoric acid are annually leached
out of the poll from every square mile
of surface. England alone is estimated
to have removed from Its soil every year
fr.STO.CT) tons of solid matter which has
been dissolved and held in solution by
running water. By this process alone,
therefore, a foot in depth -of the rocks
of England ar.d Wales would be dissolved
and rarrir-d into the aea every 12.978 years.
Taking the world over, an average of 100
tons of rocky matter Is thus annually
dissolved by running water from every
square mile and carried into the ocean.
Most of the celebrated caves character
izing limestone regions have been formed
by the slow action of streams In dissolv
ing- the limestone rork. The Luray cave.?
of Virginia, the Mammoth Cave of Ken
tucky, the numerous caves in Southern
Indiana and the Ozark region In Missouri
and the ex -at Wind Cave in the Black
Hills of Western Dakota are well-known
illustrations. But in many cases this ea
larjt>-ment has gone on so far that the roof
of the long underground water channel
has falk-n in, leaving a rock-lined, de--:p,
open gorge through which the river is
flowing, sometimes above the surface and
sometimes In a still deeper underground
channel through which it has found its

nt in connection with the waves which

GRTI VT issues depend on the result of this day's balloting in San Francisco. The new char
ter was framed by experts in civil government; doctrinaires in reform and business men of
rpni1tp Tt , v^ expected that immediate results would follow its adoption, in more economi
cal and better government. Immediately following its. confirmation as the fundamental law
of the city there arose a "small party of politicians \vh| taught the people that they^vere the only
friends of the charter, and who claimed that its practical operation should be entrusted to them. This
was done, and from the hour that it became operative until now its administration has been in the
hands of those claimants. In politics they were anti-Republicans, and now they are divided into two
squads, and each is accusing the other of having used the charter for the benefit o{ the partisan or
ganizations and the aggrandizement of their political friends.
Each accuses the other of letting the charter lie dormant as an instrument through which to I
effectnhe public and general welfare, while diverting and using its powers for the restricted benefit of j
a few. This is their attitude toward the anti-Republican administration of the charter since the people;
o-.tve it "life and them authority. It is their own declaration, and the final result of the new charter, I
as seen bv these self-elected friends of that instrument, js a maze of crimination and recrimination j
charging its misuse and misapplication. Schmitz and Lane mutually charge each other with the in-j
lention to continue and perpetuate this misuse of the organic law. They to-day go to judgment; to bej
Â¦weighed and measured by the people in the light of their Â£own charges of maladministration, and their
averment that the system is to be continued by whichever dne is elected. The city is weary of this. \
The people feel deeply that there is fact at the bottom of the asserted misuse of the charter.
The men who trumpeted their mission as its friends have ffurnished the testimony on which this feel
ing is founded. There is also a wide conviction that the failure of the charter to produce the degree
of betterment in government which it was devised to secure is due to putting its powers in the hands
of professional politicians. This gave rise to the desire to intrust the government to a clean and clear
headed business man. which caused the nomination of Mr; Crocker for Mayor. The people want to
test the charter in such hands. Its self-chosen friends confess that where its powers have so far been
invoked they have been abused. The people want its dormant possibilities of better government in
spired with activity. They want an efficient test .of its potentiality as a sufficient cause of growth andj
greatftess in San Francisco. They want to settle now the issue whether a business man has the right i
to aspire to the headship of the town. All who have kept in touch with the current incidents of the j
campaign have noticed Mr. Crocker's abstention from personalities. They have seen his walk upon!
the level path of average good citizenship, where the majority of our people go and come. |
They have noted that he has claimed no special inspiration above the heads of his fellows, and
that he has claimed no mysterious predestination, and no election to a special mission. He has been
content to utter the desires of the average man for good government, for clean administration, for the
city's accomplishment of a great future projected from its great past. He has expressed his conviction i
that the charter is an ample garment to clothe a greater city, and has not claimed that he is the One!
and only man who can guide San Francisco forward to the mark of her high calling, but only that his i
nomination and election put upon him the duty of doing the wisest and best that he knows. From the i
masses have come abundant evidence that he is credited with the ability and the force to do this, and
that the average citizen turns to him with frank confidence.
Since the demonstration on Saturday night no good judge of the. popular purpose has doubted
his election. He has been the object of much spiteful abuse, of flagrant misrepresentation and of the
stock partisan accusations made by politicians, not to save the city from any risk, not to turn any im-i
pending peril from the public, not to effect any. good thing, but only to promote the fortunes of profes
sional politicians, who, divided into rival camps of spoilsmen, turn from detraction of him to belabor
each other. The people are tired of all this hypocrisy and pretense, of the exploitation of fads to divert
the people's attention from the admitted misuse of the charter, and the conversion of public authority!
into private gain. The supporters of Mr. Crocker are not confined to one party nor to one class. They '
are found in every section of the city and among all who labor, by hand, head and heart, to achieve
the destiny which they believe possible 'to San Francisco.
Therefore he says, with conviction and intent, that he will, as Mayor, regard his duty as run
ning to the service of ail the people, extending to each his just share of good and righteous administra-i
tion. His canvass has not been devoted to showing in abhorrent colors how bad and beastly somebody j
else is, but to expressing his faith in the people, his confidence in their judgment and his submission to;
their will. A vote for him is a liallot for sanity in government and for the right use of authority ad-j
ministered in a spirit of respect for all rights, and in the interest of that equality of all men which is the
inspiration and purpose of our free institutions.
"That night the oldest boy was killed
by a car and I remember what a time
we had to take the little body from the
parents and send It to the Morgue. The
head was badly crushed and they never
saw his face after he had left the house,
soon after the photograph Incident, smil
ing and happy, to sell his papers. But
the father had one consolationâ he
thought that we would have the lad's
picture in two days and could always
keep it.
"Afterward I would see the father
standing afternoon after afternoon at that
corner and turning homeward at night
with tears in his eyes when the prom

asked when the pictures would be com

and he replied- in an off-hand way that
he would be at the corner of Dupont and
Vallejo streets about three days from that
time.
The Aftermath.
While we are on the subject of faults
and obstacles let me caution you against
one flaw that has marred many an other
wise good boxer. That is the habit of
"snapping back." "Snapping back" Is
drawing back the hand and arm before
the blow you have just delivered has fair
ly landed. It is, of course, necessary to
grt back to guard at once just as soon as
your blow is delivered. But that blow
should be delivered with all the force you
intended to put into it before the arm Is
drawn back. Nervousness often leads a
man to snap back his arm to guard be
fore his blow has fairly reached its mark.
To fall Into this habit is ruinous to all
hopes of good boxing. I will speak of
other errors to be avoided later on. Now
for our leeson. which you will find in
next Friday's' issue.
There, will be other but far less Im
portant points to puzzle you as you pro
ceed. The three I have named are by far
the most difficult to overcome, and yet
each of the trio can be mastered with a
little practice.
Watch your sparring partner's work
and make him watch yours. When either
of you make a 'mistake stop and go over
the maneuvir again and again until you
get it correctly.* pon't let each other fall
into bad or slovenly habits of boxing, but
ke*-p each other "up to the mark."
Don't practice for a week or so and then
give it up. Nothing worth knowing was
ever learned in that time. Spar at it
dally, month after month. Spar three
rounds a day. No more than that.
At first spar two-minute rounds. Then,
as wind and muscle Improve, lengthen the
rounds to thro*- minutes each. But never
box longer than three minutes without
resting.
The "rests" between rounds should at
first be two minutes long. I>ater, shorten
these "rests" to one minute each.
More boys are injured during the "rests"
than in any actual boxing. For Instance,
you are overheated, perspiring and pant-
Ing. Your natural Instinct is to "cool off"
quickly. And that Is the very worst thing
you can do, for It leads to pneumonia,
rheumatism and a dozen other ills. As
soon as the rest begins wrap a coat about
you or some other thick covering, keep
out of a draught and run no risks of tak
ing cold.
When through your bout for the day
take a quick, cold rponge bath, then rub
yourself down vigorously with a rough
towel and dress as rapidly as possibly.
That is one of the great advantages of
choosing anothf-r boy of about your own
size as a "sparring partner." You can
help each other and at the same time im
prove by constant practice. It is always
well, when somewhat further advanced, to
box whenever you can with some one
who is a better boxer than you are. For
it is by boxing with better and not with
Inferior opponents that one becomes skill
ful.
The third "sticking point" comes when
a boy, having learned by rote all the
various leads, guards, blocks, counters,
etc.. of boxing, tries to apply those tricks
in a regular boxing match. Just as a
music pupil who has learned all the scales
cannot expect at once to become a dash
ir.g performer, no a boy who has the de
tails of boxing at hie fingers* ends must
practice those various details ovt-r and
over until he has them instinctively.
Then, when his opponent makes a certain
lead he will know, without stopping to
think, what is thÂ»Â» correct guard or coun
ter for It. He will also see openings in
the other's guard and will be quick to
take advantage of them.
Only by constant boxing can this in
stinct be gained.
To acquire this balance, throw yourself
repeatedly into the first position ("on
guard," as described in the last lesson),
lead with left and right, and continue tu
do this until such leads no longer result
in a tendency to make you topple over.
While still standing on guard. Jump for
ward, then backward, then to either side;
always landing in just the attitude in
which you were standing before you
mad*- the leap. This is not easy at first,
but a little practice will make it so. The
"boxing balance" being far different from
the ordinary balance, must be cultivated
until it, too, becomes second nature.
The second of the^ three "sticking
points" is sooner and more easily over
come. Every boy has an instinctive idea
of self-defense. When he has t^ken a
few boxing lessons, this primitive instinct
seems, for the time, to leave him. In
other words, he has lost his natural
knack of fighting, and he has not yet ac
quired the scientific method of boxing.
He feels awkward, almost helpless. In
a few more lesions, however, he will
adapt himself to the science he is learn
ing and will quickly become more formid
able than ever before. Then, in time, if
bli natural instincts at self-defense were
really good, th<>y will return and will
blend with the boxing skill he has
learned. The boy in whom these natural
and scientific instincts are best blended,
is the finest boxer and the most terrific
fighter. Such a boxer is Terry McGovern,
who. while a mere boy, fought his way
to the head of Tils profession. Another uf
thÂ»* same sort is Jim Jeffries.
go it is in boxing. Until you get your
txjxlng balance, you will be awkward and
will make little progress. But it will
come, with a little practice.
the "boxing balance." When you walk,
run or even stand you are unconsciously
maintaining a balance. You do not real
ize this, because it has become instinctive.
If some one pushes you hard and sud
denly, what happens? You lose your bal
ance. Instinctively, if you are at all
quick on your feet, you will recover this
balance. Otherwise you will fall. When
you first learned to walk, you lost your
balance most of the time. It was new to
you. You were obliged to think of it all
the time. A moment's. forgetfulneps or a
collision with any obstacle and down you
went. Gradually the balanc** became in
stinctive.

"Reliable Information just received by

Senator Warren suggests that the In

dians be permitted to leave their reser
vations to hunt in Wyoming. Under the
law each Indian outside of the State must
take out a gun license, which costs $50,
and go with a professional guide when
hunting. It is held that every Indian who
fails to do this violates the law and the
general Government, as guardian of the
redmen, is responsible to the State for
the payment of the license.
The chief engineer was then called in
and told the following story of the wreck:
"I was called up when the ship struck
and immediately went below to see if Bhe
was taking any water. Captain Mcln
tyre then came down and asked if she
was and I told him she was not. I got
her pumps all ready to start and had
them running five minutes when the cap
tain came down again. The vessel had
just started to leak through the bulkhead
forward and I took' the captain forward
and showed it to him. He told me to
keep her running and he would head her
for the beach. She was running all the
time. I told him I would run her until
she put the fires out -on me. The en
gineers and myself stayed below in the
engine room with the oilers and firemen
on watch until ordered by the first of
ficer to go on deck and abandon the ship.
"I eent my men on deck, stopped the
engines and raised the safety valves on
the boiler. I went on deck and found one
boat gone, the other drifting astern In
the fog. . I asked the first officer what
we were going to use, and he said the life
rafts were all that were left and they
would not hold us all. He said the only
thing to do was* to construct a. raft of
hatches, so the second mate and the men
on deck started to construct one. Bruce
then asked me If there was any steam
left In the boiler and if I could run her
while he tried to head her for the beach.
"I said there was and went dq,wn, low
ered the safety valve on the boiler and
ran her for about ten minutes. Then
the second assistant and myself went on
deck and left the engines running to see
how they were making out with the raft.
Men on the afterhouse were getting ready
to lower the ship's raft and I asked them
to wait till I stopped the engine so that
It would not; be broken up by the wheel.
"I went below, stopped the engines
and then came on deck again and assisted
ENGINEER WARD'S STORY.
"I did not."
I At this juncture Mr. Bulger said that
Tie would like to call in the engineer and
get the thing straightened out as to
whether the ship was moving, turning
around or not.
Captain Mclr.tyre had testified that the
South Portland's propeller was out of
water and the hub plainly visible before
any of the boats was launched and was
of no service in moving the vessel ahead.
Chief Engineer Ward says that when he
left the ship, just before she was ready to
sink, the propellor hub was not visible
out of the water and that only about six
i inches of the tips of its blades were to
be seen.
BRUCE ON THE STAND.
First Officer Bruce 'was first placed on
the stand at the opening of the investi
gation vesterday. His testimony was a
continuation of that given last Friday.
He told of the launching of the life rafts.
He then replied to the following ques
tions:
"Did you order the vessel headed to
the beach before you launched the life
raft?"
"I did."
"How, then, did it get around to the,
direction of the beach if her engine le
didn't have any steam?" "
"I headed her as near as I could."
"The engines, then, were unable to give
her headway?"
â¢â¢Not to any extent."
"Did she make any headway?" :
"I believe she did."
"If she had headway at that time, why
didn't she have headway at the time 1
when the boats were launched?"
"As far as I know she was stopped."
"If, then, there was no headway on the
ship and you could not get headway r by
running the engines, why did you ask
the engnie crew to stay in the engine ,
room?"
"I didn't ask them to stay in the en
gine room. They were all on deck at
this time. I asked the engineer if he
could give me steam and I'd head her
for the beach. He went down with one
man, I think the second assistant engin
eer, and gave me steam enough to get
her head around, but whether she got
any headway or not I couldn't say, she
was so down in the head."
"When you gave orders to abandon the
ship were the engines then working?"
"I don't believe they were. I couldn't
really say."
"Did you at any time after the ship
struck give any bell or word to the en
gineer until the time that you asked him
to run her for the beach?"
The engineer, in response to a question
by Captain Holies, said that he thought
that if the shi.o had been stopped and
all hands called to the boats all of
the passengers might have been saved.
He said that when he was called on deck
both boats were disappearing in the fog
and that Captain Mclntyre was gone with
them.
Ward stated that the wind was light
and the sea not heavy, a flat contradic
tion of the previous testimony given by
the captain and the first mate that the
wind was stiff and the sea choppy and
rough.
Chief Engineer James A. Ward of the
wrecked South Portland was on the
stand yesterday afternoon and flatly con
tradicted Mate Bruce's statement that the
ship was not going ahead at the time of
the launching "of the boats. He also
stated that the first assistant engineer,
Charles Huston, who was on watch at
the time the vessel struck, told him that
he had received no bell to sfop her and
that he had only got a slow bell. This
testimony was in direct contradiction to
that given by Mate Bruce at the investi
gation last Friday. Bruce claimed that
as soon as the ship struck he gave the
engineer a signal to stop the vessel. <
The engineer saUl that the boat was go
ing ahead from the time she struck until
the last hie raft was launched and full
speed ahead from the time the captain
entered the engine-room the second time.
During all the time the lifeboats were
being launched Ward says the boat was
going ahead, how fast he does not know,
but says that the engines were doing
their best. He also testified to the fact
that the movement of the boat must have
been perceptible from the deck, as the
vibration of the engines could be noticed.
Who cave the assistant tneineer the
slow bell and whether that was the only
one he received will never be known, for
he is dead having succumbed to exposure
while on the life raft*

General Booth, commander-in-chief of
the Salvationists throughout the world
Â«nd the father of Mrs. Booth-Tucker,
made a touching address in which he re
viewed the active and effective life work
of his daughter In connection with the
Falvation Army. He urged that a greater
devotion to the purposes of the Army
â¢rottld be the best memorial to Mrs
Booth-Tucker.
Thousands of persons from this city
and vicinity, mainly from the poorer and
middle classes, to whom Mrs-. Kmma
Booth-Tucker had devoted her life,
viewed the body of the d^ad Salvation
Army leader as it lay in state all day
to-day at th^ Salvation Army headquar

many floral tributes ami directly over It

To-morrow morning there will be a
farewell service, attended by members
of the Salvation Army and relatives of
the dead, after which the body will be
taken to Woodlawn Cemetery far inter

be'beard that his band was to be stopped
from killing game he sent a defiance to
Sheriff Miller.
Miller is the third Central Wyoming
Sheriff to be murdered wirTlin five years.
The report of the second battJe has not
been substantiated, and Governor Chat

report is true troops probably will be
ordered out.
IS A CARLISLE GRADUATE.
Not knowing that "her husband was
dead. Mrs. Miller, accompanied by a sur
geon and trained nurse, started for L>usk
last night on a special train, supposing
that the wounded would be taken thither.
Sheriff Miller and his posse of twelve
men, a number of them ranchmen picked
up en route, came up with the Indians
under Eagle Feather and Black Kettle,
a noted Sioux warrior, near the Beaver
Dams on Lightning Creek Just at dusk
on Saturday night. Inspired by Eagle
Feather's lead, the redskins opened fire
and for a few minutes a battle raged,
resolving Into a skirmish later. Sheriff
Mlllpr fell before Black Kettle's fire, with
a great wound in his thigh, and expired
a hnlf hour later from loss of blood,
niack Kettle was shot down immediately
and expired without a struggle.
Darkness came down while the battle
raged and the combatants located each
other by spurts of flame. Falkenburg
was struck in the n^ck, the bullet al
most severing his head from his body.
At last Eagle Feather was struck by two
bullets simultaneously, both of his legs
being pierced, and at his fall the surviv
ing members of the band surrendered or
fled in the darkness.
Six Indians were killed outright, ten
wounded and five captured. Eagle Feath
er lay where he fell, surrounded by the
dead, until morning, when, with the other
prisoners and the wounded, he was taken
to Newcastle. Davis and Hackney, with
the dead Sheriff and deputy, started for
town during the night.
LIGHTNING CREEK BATTLE.
iff Charles Falkenburg, rein
forced by a large party of their tribes
men, is reported to have taken place this
morning near the Horseshoe ranch. Nine
Indians are said to have been killed and
ten captured while the posse escaped
without loss or injury. The captives are
at the Horseshoe ranch, under guard.
Indian couriers have carried the news
of the battles to the agency and to other
bands of hunters, and it is feared that
a general rising will occur. A posse
under John Owen, a widely known Indian
tighter and scout, has gone from New
castle to intercept the flight of fugitives
toward the reservation, and posses have
taken the field from all towns in the
vicinity of the trouble.
Deputies Davis and Hackney arrived at
Newcastle at 1:30 o'clock this morning
with the bodies of Miller and Falken
burg, and later the remainder of the
posso came in with the prisoners and
twenty captured horses. Five wagon
loads of squaws, captured several days
ago, also are at Newcastle. The feeling
th^re is high and the prisoners may be
subjected to violence.

An Ohio lady tells a good food story
-Once years ago my sister, at that time
a woman of 25, became so ill from nerv-
ous exhaustion that for two years her life
was despaired of. She had suffered from
dyspepsia since a girl and the nervous
trouble of course aggravated that, until
it became impossible for her to eat or
take nourishment of any kind without in-
tense suffering.
"Like all persons affected with nervous
diseases, she also suffered from insomnia,
and it was nothinjr unusual for her to
flepp only three hours out of twenty-four.
All the years she had been a miserable
invalid her diet consisted almost entirely
of milk and eggs. Finally Grape-Xuts
came upon the market and she tried this
food for breakfast, four teaspoonfuls in
a pint of hot m!lk, and the change in her
condition was perfectly marvelous.
"She improved at once and her face
has now grown round and fat as I re-
membered It In rirlhood and the increase
in flesh has extended all over. She never
was weighed while an invalid, so we can-
not Â«ay just how much she has gained,
but it is wonderful. She now sleeps the
whele night through and all the miser-
sble weakness and aches in head and neck
are gen*. She Is again well and strong
and happy, when it looked as though she
would never have any happiness on this
earth again. All her neighbors look upon
her recovery as a miracle.

cur dfy is euch a strong advocate of
Grape-Nuts as a brain food that .he has
gained the nickname of 'Old Grape-Nuts/

Rollins ran a large .bill at Mollmeaux's

ore contained no trace of tungsten.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 2.â J. R. Rollins

Molllncaux's story is that Rollins

He staked numerous, claims and did a
rushing business selling them. To keep
up appearances he had a number of tons
shipped to Skagway for transhipment to

rounded up in a corral, and in the fight
which followed for their liberty #ne was

was never determined which bullet killed
the Mexican. It is told that Stewart cut
the Mexican open to ascertain whether

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 2.â Prize f.ghtfr.j?
and pugilistic contests for purses .'n Los
Angeles are barred. By a vote of 6 to 3
the City Council to-day adopted a strin
gent ordinance which practically prohibits
that so-called sport. There is no doubt
that the measure will be signed by Mayor
Snyder and, inasmuch as it contains an
emergency clause, as soon as It Is ap
proved by n!m it will immediately be
come effective. /
The ordinance Js the result of a strenu
ous crusade against pugilism, which has
been conducted here for several weeks,
and which had its origin* in certain brutal
exhibitions of questionable squareness.
The various religious organizations took
up the fight and they were assisted In a
measure by certain members of the sport-
Ing fraternity, for there has been a fac
tional fight among that class in which
much bitter feeling has been manifested.
Political and other pressure was exerted
In the effort to defeat the measure and as
a compromise it was suggested that the
prohibition of prize fighting be applied to
all except a certain section or rone In
the city and that therein certain restric
tions be placed upon the sport, but this
proposition was rejected and. despite the
efforts of fight promoters, the Council
adopted the ordinance, the first section
of which is as follows:
"It shall be unlawful for any person to
hold, conduct or engage in, or to be pres
ent as a spectator at. any boxing contest
or sparring exhibition In the city of L.os
Angeles: provided, however, that nothlns
in this section contained shall be con
strued so as to apply to any prize fight
or sparring exhibition prohibited by sec
tion 412 of the Penal Code of the State of
California, or to any private boxing, with
boxing gloves weighing not less than
eight ounces each, the backs of which aro
padded with soft material."
The other sections make It unlawful
for any person to rent a building for the
purpose of holding prize fights therein and
also for any person to attend a prize fight
in any capacity. The penalty is a fine of
from $100 to $500 and imprisonment for
from 30 to 100 days. The exception of pri
vate exhibitions may make possible small
fights, but while the ordinance Is in force
there can be no public mills here.
Robert Fitzsimmons has started train
ing for his twenty-round battle with

championship contests fought In this city.
Joe is used to hard knocks and is fairly
clever with his hands. Jim Casey, who
is called the "Irish giant." is also work
ing with Fitzsimmons. Bob uses Casey
for rough work on the canvas. He Is
able to throw Casey around as if he were
a small boy. The Corn'.shman's strength
Is remarkable. Fitz goes out on the road
each day and his wind is already good.
His eye Is clear and bright and he Is as
active and full of fight as in the days
when he made the best men in the coun
try acknowledge his fighting ability.
George Gardner is training in Sausallto.
He has Dave Barry to box with and uses
the hills for strengthening his legs and
Improving his wind. Gardner Is gaining
strength and is keeping to his original
weight. He possesses great confidence
and feels certain that he will relieve Fitz
simmons of the light heavy-weight cham
pionship. Gardner has Improved wonder
fully since last seen here. His victories
over clever Jack Root have made him feel
certain that he can defeat any man In
the world at his weleht.
Jimmy Britt and Charley Seiger are
working faithfully for their coming twen
ty-round bout. It will be remembered
that Britt injured his foot while prepar
ing for Seiger last month and the battle
was postponed until November 10. Britt
has recovered the use of his foot and is
doing hard work over at Croll's gardens,
Alameda. He is down to weight and ex
pects to go into the ring in perfect con
dition. Britt admits that Saiger is a
dangerous customer In the ring and he Is
leaving no stone unturned to be in the
best possible shape. Seiger proved that
he could make 133 pounds at 6 o'clock and
fight strong. This has boosted his chances
and his friends are now ready to back
him to beat Britt.
Johnnie Ritchie, one of the best feather
weights In the country, arrived In the city
yesterday, looking for a Dattle with
Frankie Neil or Abe Attell. Ritchie has

McLACHLAN WELL NOT
TRY TO SUCCEED BARD
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2.â Congressman
James McLachlan of this district will not
be a candidate before the next session of
the Legislature to succeed Thomas R,
Bard in the United States Senate. The
definite and positive statement was or
dered by him before an informal meeting
of the Seventh District Republican Con
gressional Committee to-day, prior to Mc-
Lachlan's departure for Washington to
attend the extra session of Congress.
Ever since the unofficial announcement
was made that Mr. Bard would not be a
candidate to succeed himself friends of
McLachlan have been trying to boom him
for the national Senate and for a time it
was supposed that these efforts were with
the consent of the Congressman, but his
announcement removes him entirely from
the race. He stated that he will endeavor
to secure renomination and re-election to
Congress and for the present he has no
higher ambition.
Accompanied by Congressman Victor
H. Metcalf and wife, McLachlan left this
evening for Washington. Metcalf has
been here several days quietly studying
the political situation for the purpose, it
Is said, of endeavoring to ascertain how
much support he may count upon from
this section in his own candidacy for the
Senate. He refused to discuss the matter,
however, just before his departure.

The Patrie asserts that an unwritten
chapter of the war will appear later, dis
closing the fact that the Boers relied on
the promises of Germany, but that Great
Britain succeeded in gaining German
neutrality. It will also be shown, the
Patrie adds, that the Boers had planned
to cripple British commerce by the fitting
out of privateers, "which Mr. Kruger pre
vented, not wishing to have resort to
such a supreme remedy."

Immediately after his visit to the State
Department Sir Ldang cabled to Peking
the answer of Secretary Hay to China's
appeal for assistance. The Peking au
thorities are aware by this time that un
til the ratification of. the American-Chi
nese treaty, which was signed on October
8. pledging to the world the opening of
Moukden and Antung, it will be impos
sible for this Government. In view of its
traditional policy of steering clear of for
eign alliances, to protest against Russia's
continued occupation of Manchuria. It
has been pointed out to China that, al
though the sympathy of the United States
is hers, the time for American interfer
ence has not yet come. It is expected
that the commercial treaty, which should
arrive in Washington this week, will be
ratified at the extra session of Congress,
when the United States will be prepared
to insist on a strict regard of her treaty
rights throughout China. The Peking
Government has been told that infringe
ment by Russia of American treaty rights
in Manchuria will give the Washington
Government an opportunity for at least
an expression of its desire for the preser
vation of the integrity of China.
Japan, it was learned to-night, has in
stituted an investigation regarding the
extent and character of Russia's reoccu
pation of Moukden. Takahira. the Jap
anese Minister, when asked to-night
whether Russia and Japan contemplated
an understanding by which thÂ«? oae would
obtain a free hand in Manchuria and' the
other important concessions in Korea, re
plied by calling attention to a recent of
ficial announcement from Tokio that the
negotiations at the Japanese capital be
tween Russian and Japanese officials
were, as far as Japan is concerned,
strictly in accord with the Anglo-Japanese
alliance. Takahira has not been advised
of any appeal from Russia to Japan, and
said to-night that his conference with
Secretary Hay to-day concerned another
matter.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â Sir
Chentung Liang Cheng, the
Chinese Minister here, acting
under instructions from his
Government at Peking, has
been particularly active recently in the
effort to interest the United States Gov
ernment in China's behalf in her Man
churlan troubles. He was at the State
Department in pursuance of that object,
the direct purpose being to see if any way
can be found by which the United States
Government may be able to, serve China
In this emergency.
It appears, however, that Secretary Hay
has not been enabled to hit upon any plan
of action that would promise to serve
China in this manner. There Is no ques
tion that the events reported as having
occurred at Moukden, including the re
occupatlon of that town, are not looked
upon with friendly eyes by the officials
here, but so long as the United States
Government secures and retains trade in
Mancnuria it will not be drawn into_Â»he
political complications of the present situ
ation.

Superintendent Greene says the disturb
ance-was the greatest since 1875. He and
Dildine conducted some interesting ex
periments and accurately measured the
atmospheric intensity. ,
â¢The greatest pressure measured at any
one time was 300 volts. This was the
maximum register of the voltmeter used.
There is no telling how much more pres
sure would have been registered had the
voltmeter t>een constructed to record a
higher figure.
The greatest range shown was 370 de
grees, swinging from negative to positive
polarity. These results are considered re
markable.'by electrical ; experts.
"We found," said Greene to-day, "that
the electricity from the overcharged at
mosphere, registered from twenty-three
millimeters positive back to the same fig
ure negative. The wire leading to Dickin
son, N. D., was cleared of all battery and
other artificial currents and subjected to
atmospheric tests. This line, was 560 miles
long and was successfully' operated at
numerous times by using only the elec
tricity which descended from the skies."

THREE ANNAPOLIS CADETS
ON TRIAL FOR HAZING
Victims of Their Pranks Testify Re

Court-Martial.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 2.â The pro

ed for the trial of the three midshipmen
of the flrst class, charged with hazing
members of the fourth class, began to
day in the office of the commandant of
midshipmen. The first midshipman to be
arraigned was John H. Lofland of Oska
loosa, Iowa, and his plea was not guilty.
All of to-day's session was occupied by
the hearing of witnesses for the prose
cution. As soon as the trial of Lofland
is completed the court will take up the
cases of Joseph D. Little of Springfield,
O., and Earle W. Chaffee of Rhineland,
Wis.

number of other fourth-class midshipmen.
AH of them, as is usual in cases of this
kind, showed the greatest reluctance to
say anything that might tend to injure
the accused midshipmen or even to ad
mit the existence of hazing.

London Globe Declares Politics In

Decision.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The release from
custody of James L. Lynchehaun by Fed
eral Commissioner Moores at Indianapolis
on Saturday, on the ground that, while
Lynchehaun's crime was brutal, it was
nevertheless of a political nature, is ad
versely commented upon by the afternoon
papers here, the Globe claiming that poli
tics influenced the decision. The Globe
says :
"The next assassin of a President will
plead Commissioner Moores" judgment
with irresistible force if he escapes across

have no cause for complaint if the re
sult throws out of sear the whole ma
chinery of extradition between the United
States and Great Britain."
The Pall Mall Gazette remarks: "By
the same reasoning used by Commissioner
Moores it would always be possible to
refuse the extradition of anarchists guilty
of most dastardly crimes."

Whalers are shaking their heads about
the lack of luck that is coming to the
schooner Morning Star, not long ago con
verted from a missionary ship into a blub
ber hunter. Missionaries are for some
reason unpopular with sailors. .The Morn
ing Star has been whaling all season and
is still clean. "And she will come home
clean," said a Â¦whaleman on the Beluga.
"She was packing missionaries too long
to have any luck left."

The Japanese steamship America Maru
on her outward voyage passed close to
Midway Island. As a treat for the iso
lated company of cable employes sta
tioned there. Captain Going lowered over
the side a huge box heavily ballasted
with fruit, wine, cigars, tobacco, maga
zines, newspapers and such other lux
uries as he thought would be welcome to
men living a Robinson Crusoe existence.
As the America steamed away a boat was
putting off from the Island to take the
box in tow. When the liner reached
Hongkong Captain Going received a ca
ble from the superintendent expressing
thanks for the box, but Informing him
that a sudden squall had compelled the
boat to put back and had driven the box
to sea. .

The Beluga's cargo included 30,000
pounds of bone, 8750 gallons of oil, 40
pounds of Ivory, 16 bear skins, 640 fox
ekins, 12 marten skins and 2 wolf skins.
In the early part of the voyage Hugh
Stattner, a fireman, fell down the en
gine room companionway and broke his
ankle. Captain Bodflsh reduced the
fracture and, although the limb is a little
crooked, Stattner seems perfectly satis
fied with the sailor surgery.
Bâ^ IE- whaling steamer Beluga,
which arrived Sunday night, 1?
days from Port Clarence,
brought one of the most valu
able cargoes that has come out
of the north in some time. It includes
whalebone, whale oil, ivory and furs and
represents a market value of nearly
$350,000. Unfortunately for the Beluga's
crew, however, the greater part of this
rich store was gathered by other vessels,
the steam whaler's share being limited to
the products from three whales caught
and killed by the Beluga's company. The
skipper. Captain Bodtish, and the en
gineers, whoso remuneration is fixed in
dependently of the catch, will be well
paid for their time, but what little may
be coming to the others, whose compen
sation depends upon the harvest, will bo
more- than offset by the amount they owe
the slop chest. .
The slop chest of a whaler possesses
something of the virtue of the philos
opher's stone. The shirt which in port
la worth $1, acquires a value of anywhere
from J4 to $6 after a little sojourn in this
"wonderful receptacle. Dollar shoes triple 1
in value; overalls assume the financial
importance of imported tweeds, and un
derwear of modest worth is disposed of at
figures into which the orifrtnal price could
be divided many times. Few of the men
that ship on whalers leave port with
much more wardrobe than the clothes in
which they stand. Blubber hunting takes
the odd looking craft into chilly latitudes
where warm clothing is a necessity. The
whaleman's necessity is the slop chest's
opportunity and the greater the necessity
the more closely does the slop chest re
semble the philosopher's stone. It takes
a big catch to overtake the slop chest.
The Beluga had some little trouble Vith
the ice during the early part of her cruise
off Turner Reef. Coming out of the north
ern waters, off Herrold Island, the young
ice was encountered and the Beluga re
quired all her steaming strength to force
her way through.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Or., Nov. 2.â Unless lift
draws are supplied the four bridges span
ningr the Willamette River at this point
no more vessels will be piloted to the
upper harbor after dark. This was the
ultimatum Issued by pilots of the local
harbor this morninsr.
If this new feature in the, controversy
between the pilots, United States engi
neers and city authorities is carried out
it means that no craft demanding the
services of a pilot will be able to pro
ceed farther upstream than the steel
bridge, except in broad daylight.
The pilots are not alone In this matter,
but have the support of some of the tow
boat owners. The stand Is a result of
thÂ© suit fought last week, which ended
In Pilot Harry Emken, Captain Mitchell
and the Willamette Columbia River Tow
ing Company being held responsible for
damage done to the Morrison-street
bridge through the steamer Elm Branch
colliding with that structure three years
ago. The pilots declare that at present
there is .not sufficient space between the
piers and spans of the bridges to admit
of a vessel being towed through them In
safety, and if they are to be held respon
sible for destruction when thus handicap
ped they will not accepC the risk.
Captain Daniels of the steamer Aber
deen asked for a pilot to take his vessel
this evening, but was informed that If
she was not ready before dark ha would
have to wait until to-morrow.

Shipping Intelligence.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 2.â Rear Admiral
Endicott, chief of the Bureau of Yards
and Docks, In his annual report to the
Secretary of the Navy, says several of
the yards, especially those at New York
and Norfolk,, are becoming congested,
owing to their limited area, and that
unless some' action is taken looking to
their relief, their efficiency will become
restricted.
The estimate* for the coming fiscal year,
it is explained, provide for contains the
work on drydocks at Charleston, New-
York and Norfolk and the steel floating
dock at Cavite, P. I., and that with the
exception of the estimate for the improve
ment of the water front at the New York
yard, $1,600,000, these are amonor the
largest items for which estimates are
submitted. Attention is called to the need
of more extensive accommodations for
the storage of torpedo boats and It is
suggested that the construction of a
Bmall drydock at Norfolk and other yards
for the docking of the largest number of
small boats of the navy would bo an
economical provision. Many works of
.Improvement are necessary at the
Charleston yard, if it is to be developed
into a station of moderate efficiency, says
the report; also at New Orleans.
Admiral Endicott says a drydock of the
largest capacity should be constructed at
once at Pensacola, which yard, he be
lieves, will be of undoubted importance
in the future. He adds that a new dry
dock ultimately will be required at the
Puget Sound yard. The great need of ad
ditional land for extending the yard at
New York and the need of a new general
storehouse and the improvement of the
additional land acquired at the Washing
ton yard are pointed out.

ALUMINUM WIRE
OUSTING COPPER
Used as Transmitter of Elec
trical Energy.
The Lighter Metal Is Extensively
Aluminum lines are now employed for
the three longest electrical transmissions
in North America. In the longest single
line, that from Electra power-house to
San Franclaco, a distance of 154 miles,
aluminum Is the only conductor used.
The 144-mlle transmission between Col
gate and Oakland Is carried out with
three, aluminum and three copper wires.
For the third transmission in point of
length that from Shawinigan Falla to
Montreal, a distance of eighty-five miles,
three aluminum conductors are employed.
From these examples It may be seen
that copper has lost its former place as
the only conductor to be seriously consid
ered for transmission circuits. Aluminum
has not only disputed this claim for cop
per, but has actually gained the most
conspicuous place in long transmission
lines. This victory of aluminum has been
wen ln hard competition. The decisive
factor has been that of cost for a cir
cuit of given length and resistance.
From the standpoint of cross-section*!
area aluminum Is Inferior to copper as an
electrical conductor. Comparing: wires of
equal sizes and lengths the aluminum ha;Â»
only 60 per cent of the conductivity of the
copper.. The Inferiority of aluminum la an
area is more than offset by Its superiority
over, copper ln terms of weight. One
pound of aluminum drawn Into a wire of
any length will have a sectional area 3.33
times as gr*at as one pound, of copper In
a wire of equal length. This follows from
ithe fact" that the weight of copper is 553
pounds; whfle that of aluminum is only
167 pounds per cubic foot, so that for
equal weights the bulk of the latter is
3.33 times that of the former metal. Hence
for equal resistances the weight of an alu
minum is only one-half as great as that
of a copper wire of the same length.
From this fact it la evident that when the
price per pound of aluminum is any less
than twice the like price of copper the
former Is the cheaper metal for a trans
mission line of any -required length and
electrical resistance.â Engineertaf Maga

The Potato market was quirt pending: the un
loading of the Oregon steamer, which arrived
with ;52O9 â¢' Sacks. The receipts from other
sources were unusually large, aKjrreRatlng over
8000 sacks.'" Three cars of Sweet Potatoes
were marketed and cleaned up readily at an
advance. Choice Onions of the Australian
Jtrown variety were firm at the top quotation
while other kinds were dull at unsteady rates!
Choice ofJwlnRS of Lima noana and Gree 1 '

wheat was of an extremely dragging nature

nlflcance. A number of factors conduced to
the extreme dullness. It was a holiday In
lA.ndon and to-morrow will be a holiday nere.
More time was given by brokers to betting
on 10-morroWs election than to the trading in
Mocks. The advancing tendency of the stocks
of New York corporations reflected the views
of operators on the effect of the supposed
outcome of to-morrow's election on the values
of those securitit*. Money continued to go
to the interior the sub-Treasury transferring
*C0u.0u0 to New Orleans and $000,000 to' Chl
i-ajfo. The movement to St. Louis was discon
tinued with a beneficial effect upon sentiment.
The rites for time money hardened decidedly
end not much business was done under 0 per
cent. Call loans, on the contrary, eased nota
bly, and fell to 2 per cent at the last. The
market for foreign exchange was fairly de
moralized and broke violently under offerings
of cotton bills with very light demand for re
mittance. A report which circulated that $1.
ooo.OW in gold had b*en engaged In London
for shipment to New York, although not offi
cially confirmed, waa generally credited, and
formed the basis of an expectation that fur
ther gold would come in. This was the dom
inant influence on the* market, which resulted
in advances reaching about a point on a num
ber of the Pacific*. Amalgamated Copper was
neglected and heavy, presumably on account
of the failure of the mediation committee to
effect a settlement on the Montana trouble.
The advance in money rates continued to
restrict the business In bonds, but prices were
fairly well maintained, gains alternating about
equally with lueses. Total sales. $l,S95,OU0.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2.
REAL' ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
â¢Jt is reported that the Southern Pacific
will build a branch railroad from the port
of (iuaymas, on the Gulf of California,
northeast to Naco, situated on the border
between Arizona and the State of Sonora,
Mexico. The principal object in building
this road Is to reach the Barranca coal
fields, which are owned by the Southern
Pacific. The road will connect with the
Sonora branch of the Southern Pacific at
Guaymas.
A company has been organized to build
a railway from Tlacotalpan, in the State
of Vera Cruz, to a point on the Vera
Cruz and Pacific Railroad by way of Las
Tuxtlas. Wealthy Mormons are inter
ested in a project to build a railroad sixty
miles long to connect their colonies, sit
uated in the State of. Chihuahua, Mexico,
with the Mexican Central Railroad. A
short line of railway is to be built from
I>as Charcas station, on the National
Railroad of Mexico, to the mines of the
Tiro General Company. The Oaxaca and
OJutla Railroad Company has obtained a
concession to build a branch line from a
point on Its main line to the town of
Zlmatlan. situated' in the State of Oaxaca.
American capitalists are Interested In a
number of other new railroad projects In
Mexico. New York men who are Inter
ested in the San Carlos Copper Company
have obtained a concession from the Mex
ican Government .to build a railroad from
Linares, a station situated on the gulf di
vision of the Mexican Central, to Soto la
Marina, situated on the gulf coast at the
mouth of the river of that name. This
proposed road will pass through the San
Jose mining district. Soto la Marina is
situated about midway between Tampico
and the mouth of the Rio Grande.
Luis Garcia Tereul has obtained a con
cession from the Mexican Government to
build and operate a railroad from San
Marcos, situated on the Mexican (Vera
Cruz) Railroad, to Rosendo Marquez, sit
uated on the Mexican Southern Railroad.
He has organized a company and con
struction of the new line will soon be
commenced.
The Mexican Government has long de
sired that a railroad be built through the
Isolated and remote region which this
line is to traverse. It will start at Doug
las, Arizona, where It will connect with
the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad,
and will run south to the great mining
camp at Cananea, Mexico. From Can
anea the v route of Â¦ the proposed road is ,
south down the valley of the Yaqui River
to a point near the of that stream
and thence southeast down the Pacific
coast of Mexico to the port of Altata,
touching at the port of Topolobampo,
where it will connect with the Kansas
City, Mexico and Orient Railroad. At
Altata the road will connect with the
short line of railway which runs from that
place to the city of Culiacan. The latter
road has been acquired by the projectors
of the new line. It was owned by Sebas
tian Camacho. The route from Culiacan
is down the Pacific coast to the Rio
Grande de Santiago River and thence up
the rich valley of that stream to the city
of Guadalajara. The length of the pro
posed road will be nearly 1500 miles. It
will traverse the richest mineral and ag
ricultural regions of Mexico. It is re
ported that the same interests will build
a road north from Douglas through Ari
zona to connect with Moffat'a Utah-Cali
fornia line.
AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 2.â A new group
of American capitalists are about to en
ter the railroad building: field of Mexico.
An application has been made to the
Mexican Government for a concession to
build and operate a line of railroad which
is to run from the border of Arizona south
and southeast to the city of Guadalajara
and probably to the City or Mexico. .The
new road will be called the Mexican and
Pacific Coast Line. The men principally
Interested In the project are David Mof
fat of Denver, Colo., and the principal
stockholders in the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company. Colonel Joseph A. Robert
son, an American manufacturer and min
ing man of Monterey, Mexico, who built
the Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad
In the face of many obstacles, is also ac
tively interested In the enterprise. The
Mexican Government will grant the con
cession for the new road iti the early part
of next January and will give a subsidy
of $15,000 per kilometer for each kilometer
of road constructed. The preliminary ar
rangements for the construction of the
road have been made. #

THE BETROTHAL.
Sunday Call Art Supplement
A great artist once said that the most successful
genre pictures have always for their subjects some-
thing relating to love or war. It is only natural that
love, which every living being is destined to experience,
should furnish subjects which attract, and the only as-
pect of the contrasting emotion of hate which is not
despicable is war, and even that is ennobled only by a
love of country or a love of right.
Carl Mucke's picture, "The Betrothal," depicts the
action which is a formal acknowledgment of the exist-
ence of love, but at the same time the attitude of the
figures of the young man and woman, their expression
and their regard tell more than actions of eivinsr and
accepting the betrothal ring, which is but a symbol.
The fact that the principal roles in the scene are
played by a humble Dutch fisherman and his dulcinea
only serves to strength the sentiment of the picture be-
cause the sentiment of love is generally conceded to
have a stronger hold on the simple minds of the lowly
than upon minds distracted by multiplicity of consid-
erations which beset people in higher walks of life.

story he drew a club or. an iron bar and

TROUBLE OVER CHILD.,
Mrs. Feld brought a suit for divorce
last April. She alleged cruelty .'and de
sertion. In support of these charges, she
said that her ' husband had frequently
beaten her and that on a number of oc
casions he had placed a revolver to her
head and â¢ threatened to blow her\bralns
out. She said her life was Â¦ one of terror;
and that she could endure her husband's
society no longer. 'Â¦. The . wife remained
in the country for some months and'after
her return, In July, resolved to again live
with her husband. ' This â¢ union * lasted
just two weeks, when she was obliged to
return -to her parents and on September
20 filed another suit for divorce, the other
having been withdrawn. J ' >.. .
Feld was appointed to the police force
about five years ago. Three years ago he
was brought before the Police. Comrhls
sloners on a serious charge and soon aft
erwards married Miss Alice Dirking." The
life of the couple seems to have been' one
of unhappiness. Even the patrolman's
mother, with whom both lived for some
time, admits that she was - required to
ask them to seek other shelter. Then they,
went to the home of Policeman Quarrals
at 2538 Geary street, but,- 'fy*' before, they
could not agree and were asked to move.
A child that was born one j year after
their marriage did not seem to ! bring'
about felicity and some â¢ months ago the
two decided to live apart. -
THREATENS .WIFE.
Fritz Durking, an insurance agent,
last night. The shooting occurred at
Durking's home. 11 Fair avenue, and
grew out of a long line of family troubles.
Feld and his wife have separated and the
latter is at present suing - for a divorce.
The policeman went to the Dirking house,
where his spouse is living at present,
and, being refused permission to see his
2-year-old child, caused the tragedy.
According" to the version of Mrs. Feld,
her jnother and her brother, the affair
was unprovoked. They' admit, however,
that Dirking was armed with a knife,
which was given to him for purposes of
self-defense by his young son, but' say
he received it after he had >â¢ been shot.
After the fatal shot had been fired Feld
entered the house, broke -into a room
-where his wife was and struggled wi{h
her. He entered with the revolver in his
hand, but replaced it. in his pocket. It is
claimed that he attempted to draw the
weapon and use .it afterward. ' but the
woman prevented him from doing so until
the police entered the house and. made the
arrest. Another revolver figured . in /the
case. It was brought out' by the boy for
the purpose of protecting his sister. Feld
will not make a statement. . .

Speaking on the 'Macedonian question
before the Channing "Auxiliary yesterday
afternoon, .Professor Jerome* B.' Landfield
of the University of California said that
the Turkish administration' in Macedonia
was very corrupt, especially as the ',offi
cials sent there were palace favorites giv
en their positions . that they might â¢ have
an opportunity to make their fortunes.
Professor Landfield said: that such a con
dition of affairs, however, j did not . differ
so materially from the corruption. in. the
government of some of America's cities.
'The acute situation in Macedonia, he
sa<d, had quieted down chiefly because the
Christian brigands have had withdrawn
from them the moral support of Austria
and Russia, whose Joint note to the Sul
tan had done much to restore order.
That, he said,' seemed a satisfactory so
lution of ,the Macedonian problem. He
was of the opinion that the Just treatment
of the Turkish agriculturists of the pe
ninsula could only, come by the restora
tion of the Turkish administrative au
thority, bad though it be. and by the im
provement of that administration by Eu
ropean diplomatic pressure at Constanti

about if the powers would lay aside their
self-interest , for the Â¦ good' of . alL

The trial attracted an immense crowd
to the courtroom, as the case was prose
cuted by District Attorney Fredericks in
person and as special prosecutors ap
peared former Governor Henry T. Gage
and Isidore B. Dockweiler. The interests
of the defendant were looked after . by
Attorneys Charles Silent and Jchn D.
Works. ; r
This was the result of an all day pre
liminary hearing in Judge Chambers' de
partment of the Police Court, and at Its
conclusion the court declined to continue
in force the bond on which Griffith had
been at liberty, but insisted upon the exe
cution of a new bond. Pending the filing
of this bond the defendant was placed
in custody of an' officer and for several
hours was as much under arrest as he
would have been had he been behind the
bars of a jail.
It had been reported that Mrs. Grif
fith would- not prosecute her husband, and
this report was particularly 'emphasized
when about two .weeks Â¦ ago; the two ar
ranged for_ a . property settlement by the
terms' of which Mrs. Griffith received
$62,500 cash, but all doubt " as to her in

PERSONAL MENTION.
The cross-examination was most vigor
ous, but it failed to shake her story. The
attorneys for the defense disclosed by
their questions that they will attempt to
prove that Griffith was temporarily in
sane from drink at the time of the shoot-
Ing. After she had been . excused Mrs.
Griffith fainted in the corridor of the
cpurtroom and the services of a physician
.were required. Other witnesses testified
to having founfl-the wounded woman and
what was donewlth her. When the prose
cution rested the defense stated that it
had. no evidence to introduce and the
court then set the bail of the defendant at
$15,000 and demanded a new bond as
'.stated. 1 ' Â¦ â¢; â¢

POLICEMAN WHO SHOT AND FATALLY WOUNDED HIS FATHER-IN
LAW LAST NIGHT WHILE TRYING TO FORCE HIS WAY INTO THE
LATTER'S HOME. AND HIS VICTIM.
The Associated Oil Company, through
the combination that was effected by it,
became the largest holder of popductlve
oil lands in California and also the largest
nroducer. Contracts were made: to sup
ply millions of barrels of oil per annum
to power and manufacturing plants, the
bulk of the business being in San Fran
cisco. It was supposed popularly that
the combination would bring about a
higher price for fuel oil. Some compa
nies that expected to share In- the ad
vance and that preferred to : J maintain
their identity as individual producers re
fused to join with the Associated Oil
Company. The price has not been much
increased since the -Associated Oil Com
pany came into existence.
The production that was possible was
practically almost unlimited. The local
consumption did not by any means call
for the opening of the greatest possible
number of wells that would produce rich
ly in either the Kern River or dther Kern
County fields. The amount of oil thrown
upon the market'could be easily, increased
largely. The knowledge of these facts
has been one factor in â¢keeping the mar
ket price of fuel oil down.
The Standard Oil Company, which is a
large consumer of oil In this State,
through its refinery, and also a large sell
er of oil, saw In the Associated Oil Com
pany Its strongest competitor for the bus
iness ! in California. It created a pipe
line from Bakersfleld that istcapable of
delivering at the Point Richmond works
20,000 barrels of oil daily. By this move
it placed itself in a stronger position in
the San Francisco market as'a seller of
the fuel oil, the cost of transporting oh
by pipe line being estimated at not more
than eight cents per barrel, while all
others who moved ollby. ralljhad to pay
upward of 30 cents per barrel for. trans
portation. This difference played into the
hands of the Southern Pacific Company,
which naturally wanted to ' get oil as
cheaply as possible and militated against
largely increasing earnings ,on the part
of the Associated Oil Company, which
circumstance had the same general bear
ing.
DISPATCH GIVES PRICE.
A press dispatch from Bakersfleld con
tains the assertion that for its holdings
the Reed Crude Oil receives,, $1,660,000 and
the San Joaquin Oil Company $840,000. The
Bear Flag Company, which was allied
with the Associated Oil Conjpany, parted
with its holdings of stock some time ago
and the fact was announcedfin The. Call.
It is now reported that the Kern Oil
Company has decided to â¢ distribute its
stock In the Associated Oil Company
among its individual stockholders, *ho
will be in a position to do. as they please
with it. The deal of yesterday was made
through the Union Trust Company. â¢
OTHER DEALS RUMORED.
While all those that are concerned as
principals in the proceedings that led to
the sale of millions of shares of Associ
ated Oil stock /are secretive it is said by
the wise ones; who are^ acquainted with
the methods of the Southern Pacific Com
pany that the transportation company
never contents itself with a minority hold
ing in any enterprise in which It engages.
It is also Intimated that other companies
that took the stock of the Associated Oil
Company for their properties are', in ne
gotiation for the sale of their sto<k hold
ings to the Southern Pacific Coynpany.
How far these negotiations have proceed
ed is not given out. The inference that Is
drawn from tho remarks of those who
ought to know is that the Southern Pa
cific Company has paved the way fpr get
ting control of a majority lnterest'in the
Associated Oil Company. *,
So far as the Southern Pacific Com
pany is concerned as a transportation
company the significance of the great
deal of yesterday a*nd what may grow out
of it and similar transactions lies in the
fact that the railroad people are taking
in oil fields as they used to get coal
fields for lh*lr own use. Oil pro
duced in California has been proven to bo
a much more economical fuel for locomo
tives than coal. A large annual^ saving
has been effected by both the South
ern Pacific and Santa Fe railroad peo
ple since they began to use, crude
petroleum on their engines. The Santa' Fe
has acquired large oil land holdings to in
sure itself all the oil fuel that it may need
at the bare cost of production, and to
make this certain paid a large advance
over the original cost of lands and wells
to own them. The Southern Pacific Com
pany is pursuing the same plan*
THE ASSOCIATED OIL.
Long negotiations were necessary to
obtain the consent of the stockholders of
all the companies, somewhat more than a
score in number, that were finally brought
under one control by the Associated Oil
Company. When such general; consent
had been secured the Associated Oil Com
pany took In all the stock, plants, fran
chises, leases, supplies of oil on hand and
contracts for supplying oil and- issued to
the -stockholders in the consolidated com
panies' shares of stock in payment for
their former holdings. These are, the se
curities that the Reed Crude Oil and the
San Joaquin Company yesterday parted
with.
Five million shares of the Btock of the
Associated Oil Company that were held
in equal parts Â«by the Reed Crude Oil and
the San Joaquin Oil Company passed into
the hands of the Southern Pacific Com
pany yesteiday. The deal took place in
this city and was based on a J Value of 30
cents a share, the railroad company pay
ing cash and securing the entirte holdings
of the two companies mentioned.
The feature of the affair that will at
tract the greatest attention is the fact
that the Southern Pacific Conipany has
started on a large scale to buy out for
cash the stock holdings ot the companies
that were welded into one great and sup
posedly permanent combination some time
ago by the Associated Oil Company. That
corporation started in business with capi
tal stock amounting to 540,000,000 for the
purpose of buying up all the stock plants
and everything appertaining to a large
number of oil companies doing business
in the Kern County fields and principally
In the Kern River district.

Wolb, who was detained by the police,
was released yesterday by Captain of De
tectives Martin. Schmidt is also wanted
by the police for. burglary committed in
robbing a grocery on Capp street.
If Schmidt is located and arrested the
police will charge him with manslaughter
for causing Mrs. Wilson's death and also
place charges of burglary and robbery
against him.
Schmidt roomed at the woman^tiJinuse,
and on Sunday afternoon he informed
Caspar Wolb, another roomer in the
house, that he was going to the place to
secure his clothing and other effects.
Schmidt and Wolb were in a saloon at
Eighteenth and Shotwell streets at the
time of this conversation. Schmidt left
Wolb and a few hours afterward the dead
body of Mrs. Wilson was found at the
foot of the stairs in her house.
WAS LAST SEEN SUNDAY.
The theory of the police is that
Schmidt went to the house of Mrs. Wil
son on Sunday evening in order to get his
clothes,- and that he demanded a wedding
dress from the woman, which he had
given her. Refused in his request, ;
Schmidt Is supposed to have seized the j
dress and cut it to pieces and that Mre.
Wilson then struggled with him for pos
session of the garment. In the struggle
that followed she undoubtedly received ,
a number of bruises and succumbed to'
heart failure, brought on. by the excite
ment. . â¢ â¢
CAUNOT LOCATE SCHMIDT.
Schmidt . undoubtedly , thought that he
had killed the woman. and fled and, up to
!act evening, detectives had been unable
to find him. Schmidt's companions on
the water front, where he worked as a
s-allor. informed the police yesterday that
they believed the missing man had com
mitted suicide, as he was of a morose
and despondent turn of mind when last
t^een on Sunday.
The investigation of the detectives yes
terday showed that Schmidt was arrested
f< ur years ago for petty larceny and was i
sentenced to one year in the County
Jail.
A few days Ego Schmidt, who was en
paped to be married to Mrs. Wilson, was
suspected of robbing a Pacific Mail
â¢ :â¢ amer employe. The theft was report
ed to the police and suspicion fastened on
rt< Jimidt.
The detectives located a stolen watch
in the possession of Mrs. Wilson. Last I
Saturday sht was interviewed by de- i
tcctives and was asked where she had j
secured the watch. She told the officers^!
that Schmidt had given it to her. She
surrendered the watch to the detectives I
axid Schmidt was not arrested, as the j
officers hoped to locate the rest of the !
articles stolen while Schmidt was work- j
ins at the Mail Dock.
Mrs. Wilson, on Saturday last, informed |
the police that she had broken off her |
engagement to marry Schmidt when she j
learned he was a thief, and that he had
then demanded the wedding dress he had '
given "to her. She was offered police pro
tection from Schmidt, but she replied
that if he annoyed her she would be
able to defend herself.
Mrs. Annie Wilson, "the woman who was
found dead in her house at 5 Capp street
last Sunday evening, and who was sup
posed to have been murdered by George
Charles Schmidt, alias "Pistol Jack," a
sailor, was not murdered.
An autopsy was held on the body of
Mrs. Wilson yesterday by Dr. Bacigalupi,
autopsy Eurg-eor., and he found that the
cause of the woman's death was heart
disease, evidently produced by excite
ment. The autopsy also revealed that
Mrs. "Wilson was suffering from disease
of the kidneys and liver, caused by alco
holism. There were a number of bruises
on her body, but none of these had any
connection with the woman's death.
In the case of James P. Lavin. immi
grant inspector, and Sister M. Angelique.
sister superior of the House of the Good
Shepherd, appellants, vs. Yvonne I>e
Fevre, Georgette Normand and Marie L^
Fevre that judgment of the Circuit Court
was modified with instructions to vacate
its order of deportation, discharge the
writ of habeas corpus and remand the
women to the custody of the immigrant
inspector for deportation to France.
The women were imported from France
for an Immoral purpose and at the port
of New York were denied a landing. They
then went to British Columbia and tried
to effect a landing at the port of Seattle.
They were held up by the Immigrant Bu
reau at that port. The Secretary of the
Treasury ordered their deportation Jo
France and the matter was brought into
tne Circuit Court on habeas corpus pro
ceedings. The Circuit Court overruled
the order of the Secretary of the Treas
ury and made an order that they Â»houll
be deported to British Columbia.
In the case of the United States of
America vs. Chesley C. Moses, a Wash
ington case, the judgment and decree of
the court below were reversed. The ac
tion was Drought to determine the valid
ity of the Federal eight-hour provision
In the statute, and the Circuit Court of
Appeals holds tnat It does not apply to
Alaska.
Judges. Grtbert. Rosa and Morrow, sit
ting as thÂ« United States Circuit Court
of Appeals, handed down three decision*
yesterday the most important ot which
affirms the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Montana in the case of F. Augustus
Helnze and F. Augustus Heinze, as the
administrator of the estate of James Lar
kln, deceased, and Clara A. I^arkin, ap
pellants, vs. the Butte and Boston Con
solidated Mining Company and others, ap
pclles. Judge Ross filed a ilissentins opin
ion. The majority opinion affirming the
judgment of the lowrr court is slg.ied fcy
Judges Gilbert and Morrow. In the cours d
of the opinion they say:
"We think that the possession which
the law Imputes to the holder of thÂ« legal
title is sufficient to maintain partition un
der this statute. â¢ â¢ â¢ No issue has beon
raised as to the complainant's title or
possession. â¢ â¢ â¢ Neither in their an
swer nor in thair cross bill do the ap
pellants allege an adverse possession of
the premises In controversy or of the in
terests claimed by the appellee corpora
tion. â¢ â¢ â¢ The cross bill was in the
nature of an original bill to remove a
cloud from the appellants' alleged title,
to declare a trust and to set aside a con
veyance. It contained all the necessary
averments of an original bill asking af
firmative relief. It presented a case of
equitable Jurisdiction. It would have sus
tained a decree If the complainant's bill
had been dismissed. It was before the
court for disposition as an original suit.
â¢ â¢ â¢ We agree with the views express
ed In the dissenting opinion filed In this
cause, that there Is no ground to disturb
the findings of fact made by the trial
court."
The suit was originally begun in 1S37
and was to determine the ownership of a
two-th!rds interest in the Butte and Bos
ton Consolidated mine in Montana, the
title being in the name of J. Sulli
van and others. Their title was not
attacked, but It was contended that
as they were not In physical pos
session the appellants, who were In
such possession, had the right to con
tinue to extract the ore and work the
mine. The decision of the Court of Ap
peals is that the title not having been at
tacked by the adverse parties, it carried
t*ith It possession, and that, thereforp.
Sullivan and his associates could not be
barred from their rights to enter upon
and receive their share of what was ex
tracted.
