A South Sea lifeboat went out to a dis
tressed bark off Weymouth. There were
no signs of life on, the , vessel and it is
supposed that her crew was drowned.
A Lloyds dispatch from Cowes, Isle of
Wight, reports that the American steam
yacht Enchantress was badly damaged in
the English Channel.
The breakwater of the new harbor in
course of construction at Dover has been
entirely swept away, Involving a loss of
many thousands of pounds sterling. The
channel steamers from France arrived
late this morning after perilously rid
ing out the storm for .six or seven hours.
Many lifeboat rescues were made and
several fatalities and many accidents
were recorded. Much wreckage is being
washed up all around the coast.
From Dungeness It is reported that a
Ketches crew, numbering eight men,
were all drowned.
At South Sea several bodies have, been
washed up. Poole, Whltestable and Ports
mouth all report wrecks and fatalities.
A derelict yacht has been towed into
Portsmouth. The fate of her crew is not
known.
Much damage has been done at Bath
and Hastings.
A vessel Is in distress off the Goodwin
Sands, where the lightship is adrift.
The lifeboats have been busy all along
the coast. The hop crops have suffered
great damage."
For some time telegraphic communica
tion was completely stopped and the land
lines are still In terrible shape. The tel
egraph companies report that the wires
and poles are down everywhere. Great
numbers of fine trees in the parks of Lon
don and other cities were torn uji by the
roots or stripped of their branches, and
the list of minor damages and casualties
Is amazing. In adUltion to the deaths
from' drowning reports from Inland give
many fatalities resulting from various
causes Incident to the storm.
Dispatches from France and Germany
indicate that widespread damage has been
caused by the storm on sea and land.
Telephone communication between Lon
don and Paris had not yet been restored
and there is much delay In telegraphic
dispatches owing">to the damage to the
continental land lines.
The suburbs of the metropolis are lit
tered with trees and branches which have
been blown down. The tents of the First
Army Corps, which was under canvas
preparatory to taking part in the maneu
vers, were almost blown to pieces. It
is possible that the whole force may be
recalled from Aldershot.
BREAKWATER DESTROYED.
TELEGRAPH LINES DOWN.
All the coast towns suffered more or
less, and the agricultural sections In the
Interior report Incalculable damage, ow
ing, to the late harvest. The beautiful
hop gardens of Kent have been ' ruined
and in many places the valleys of the
Thames and the Severn , are submerged,
quantities of sheep and cattle being
drowned.
LONDON, Sept. 13.â Stories of disasters
caused by Thursday's storm occupy col
umns of the morning papers. More than
fifty lives were lost and some sixty
wrecks are reported. Damage In this line
alone will amount to thousands of pounds
sterling. An enormous number of tele
graph and telephone wires are still down
throughout the United Kingdom.
While the details of the havoc wrought
by the storm are necessarily incomplete
reports come In from all parts of the
United Kingdom showing that the devas
tation was general. All sorts of vessels
were caught In the gale and many found
ered, several with their entire crews. A
great number cf minor craft is believed
to be lost and the bodies washing ashore
continue' to swell the terrible list of
fatalities.

But until It reaches a position in which
its-character and future, course can be
definitely discovered the commanders of
vessels sailing now to the southward will
be cautioned. Thus far no shipwrecks are
reported off our coast.
But the northwestward advance of the
storm which was indicated on Thursday
night' and even this morning has been
temporarily, retarded. Over the ocean
area from the Carolina and Georgia
coasts eastward to the meridian of Ber
muda, as to-night's reports show, the
barometeric' pressures were rather
strengthened* than weakened" and conse
quently the cyclone cannot at once over
come this bank of high pressure in its
effort and directly recurve toward Cape
Hatteras. It will therefore have to wait un
til this aerial obstruction in. its path is re
moved before the track to the northward
is cleared, and the storm may lose some
of its present energy and possibly It may
be diverted from its original northwester
ly course.
As its front impurged on the western
margin of the gulf stream a northeast
wind at Jupiter (on the Southeast Florida
coast) rose in the morning to a velocity
of thirty-two miles an hour and presum
ably continued to rise all day, though un
fortunately no telegraphic report 'could
be obtained from that important station
at New York, which apparently indicates
that the telegraphic wires on the adjacent
Florida coast were carried away by the
storm. It therefore appeared necessary
to extend the - storm warnings as far
north as Charleston.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Although still

"The question as to the manner of ex

of the Secretary of the Treasury that as

vigilance must be exercised to protect the
revenues of the Government. I am not
going to hold an investigation, but sim

a conclusion that will be satisfactory to
all parties concerned." â¢

BOSTON, Sept. 11.â The evening session
of the American Pomologlcal Society was
given over to a discussion of the subject
"Ideals In Pomology," led by Charles W.
Garfield of Grand Rapids, Mich. The
morning session of the society gave at
tention to the commercial side of the
fruit growing. Speakers from different
sections of the country gave their experi
ence -as to the qualities that should be
developed, and* representatives of the
United States and Canadian Departments
of Agriculture spoke of fruit inspection
and its relation to the growers. The re
port made by Dr. F. W. Pexamer of New
York recommended the award of a Wilder
medal, given for excellence ln a new vari
ety, to the "Hiley peach" of Georgia. The
officers proposed by the nominating com
mittee and unanimously elected are as
follows: â¢ 'â¢ .
President. J. H. Hale, South Glastonbury.
Conn.; first vice president, Charles W. Gar
fleld. Grand Raoids. Mich.; secretary, John
Craig, Ithaca, N. Y. ; treasurer, L. R. Taf t.
Agricultural College. Michigan.
The paper of W. A. McKinnon. chief of
the fruit division of the Canadian De
partment of Agriculture, called for con
siderable discussion. McKinnon spoke of
ihe new laws in tho Dominion providing
for the inspection of fruit for export. The
results, he said, have been very benefi
cial. Inspection has made packers care
ful and/now when a man buys a No. 1
package he knows that it means a high
quality. Several members of the society,
who followed McKinnon, advocated the
passage of a similar law in the United
TO the higher officials of the local
postofflce department the news of
the indictment of James W. Er
win, Superintendent of the San Francisco
special delivery system, was â¢ apparently
as much a surprise as it was to the gen
eral pubjlc. When it was first announced
at the postoffice the heads of departments
refused to credit it, and it was not until
it was fully confirmed that they accepted
It as a fact.
Erwin was one of the last men in the
service who was supposed to be impli
cated in anything even savoring of dis
honesty, or official indiscretion. He has
been a postofflce inspector since 18S7, hav
ing been appointed from Atlanta, Ga., un
der the first Cleveland administration,
and assigned to the New England di
vision, with headquarters in Boston. Pre
vious to that he had been a newspaper
man. A few years later he was trans
fered to to the Pacific division, and, with
the exception of brief absences, has re
mained here in various capacities ever
since.
On July 1, 1900, he was appointed su
perintendent of .the free rural delivery
system of the Pacific Coast, and retained
that position until relieved July 1 of this
year, when the department was turned
over to R. R. Munro, inspector in charge
for the Pacific division.
During the scandals in the postofflco
affairs of Cuba following the Spanish war
Erwin was selected by Fourth Assistant
Postmaster Barlow,, who is prosecuting
the present inquiry, to assist ln unearth
ing the frauds, and his work at that time
was highly commended. Later he was
sent to Manila to institute a delivery sys
tem, and accomplished this to the entire
satisfaction of his superior officers.
MUNBO LACKS INFOBMATION.
R. R. Munro, inspector in charge, under
whose supervision Erwin has been since
July 1, speaking of the indictment of his
subordinate, said yesterday:
I have heard nothing from Washington relat
ing to the charges against Erwin and I do not
expect to for some days, as whatever instruc
tions are forwarded will be sent by mall. Â¦Â»
I am not ln possession of sufficient informa
tion to warrant a discussion of the grounds
upon which the indictment was returned. I
took no part ln the investigation that resulted
in thÂ« indictment. Inspectors were sent di
rectly from Washington to conduct the inquiry
and merely submitted their credentials to me.
I gave thsm evory assistance in my power, but
was not privy to the result of their labors.
They had instructions to report directly to the
Washington authorities and did so.
The news of Krwin's Indictment was an en
tire surprise to me. He has always borne an
excellent reputation and has been singled out
for various important assignments, requiring
pronounced ability and integrity. I know noth
ing of his connection with the Postal Develop
ment and Improvement "Company, except that
he was a stociihc'der in the concern.
WOODWOKTH IS WAITING.
United States District Attorney Wood
worth knows nothing officially of the in
dictment and he does not expect to until
it shall reach him from Washington
through the mails. Speaking of the mat
ter yesterday he said:
Beyond what I have heard around the build
ing I know nothing of an indictment having
been returned against Inspector Erwin. Un
doubtedly I shall be notified by mail, and as
soon as I am I 'shall take the proper steps to
Insure his attendance Â«t Washington, where I
presume the trial will be held.
As I understand It. the indictment charges
fraudulent conspiracy, and in that case the
Grand Jury of the place where the minds of
the alleged conspirators met would have juris
diction. The contention, I presume, will be
that this understanding was reached at Wash
ington and consequently the Washington Grand
Jury would have the right to return an in
dictment. Â¦
Efforts have been made to connect ex-
Congressman Eugene F. Loud with the
sale to the Government by the local ofll
c5als of the device for recording on mall
boxes the time of the next collection of
letters. An afternoon paper printed a
purported dispatch from Washington
stating that dishonest practices were cur
rent In the local postoffice; that certain
employes were rated at higher positions
than they were getting salary for, and
that the difference between what they re
ceived and what the Government allowed
them was divided between a clique of men
at the head of which was "one certain
political influence." When seen last night
Loud said:
Undoubtedly I am the "one certain political
Influence" referred to. I presume the reason
I wa* not mentioned bjÂ» name was because
the publisher hc-ld in mind the provisions
against criminal libel. As far as the charges
of misconduct in the workings of the local
postoffice are concerned there is absolutely no
foundation for them. There could be no manip
ulation of salaries without the knowledge of
Postmaster Montague, and anybody who know*
him will utake his life on bis honesty. Neither
Is he a catspaw for a ring of other employes.
The workings of . the postof flcÂ« system abso
lutely preclude the possibility of such a method
of extortion being practiced.
ARE MADE IN REVENGE.
These Insinuations against me emanate
either from my political enemies in the State
or come from August W. Machen formerly
greneral superintendent of the free delivery
system; and his friends. I knew about them
before they were made public. I first incurred
the enmity of Machen four or five years ago
when I denounced him on the floor of the
Houso of Representatives for violating the law
by. creating a deficiency in his department
while Congress was in session. I have also
taken an active part In bringing about this in
vestigation that has resulted j so disastrously
for him. and naturally he is ready to do mÂ«
any injury he can.
I have heretofore refrained from public de
nials of these charges because I did not deem
them worthy of notice, but I take this occa
sion to Bay that all of these veiled accusa
tions made against me are utterly and un
qualifiedly false, and the result of the Inves
tigation has bo proved them.
Postmaster Montague was not to be
seen yesterday. He came to his office for
a few minutes in the morning and then
left for his summer home at Agnews. He
was in a state of almost utter collapse
at the developments in the Investigation
and his condition was such that his fam
ily decided to have him moved to the city.
He left Agnews at & o'clock in the after
noon for San Francisco. Inquiry at nis
home was answered by the statement
that he was not there, and It was stated
that his whereabouts was unknown. It
is thought that he is being cared for in
some private hospital.
BOYS ARE ARBESTED

Confess to .Having Placed a Bail
Across the Track at Baton
Tunnel.
TRINIDAD, Colo.. Sept. 11.â Paul Mur
phy and Ernest Smith, boys of Raton,
N. M., have been arrested by Special
Agent Rudd of the Santa Fe road,
charged with wrecking a train.
Last Sunday evening No. 2 passenger
train ran across a rail which had been
placed across the track just below the
Raton tunnel, derailing both engines.
The boys have confessed they placed the
rail on the track.
Continued From Page 1, Column 5.
The device was immediately adopted.
This occurred in October, 1S9D. It is al
leged that the price paid the company
fur the device was afterward increased
through Machen's efforts.
Beavers. Maehen and Erwin are the
three men indicted in connection with
this transaction and conspiracy to de
fraud the Government is trre specific
charge.
The inspectors say that Richardson was
eo frank and candid in his statements
and It was so apparent that he was an
unconscious tool of Â«thers in the deal that
it was thought better not to bring his
case before the Grand Jury, at least at
this time. He is understood to have tes
tified that Machen instructed him that
he must distribute the stock if he wished
to have his device adopted. He Is also
understood to have further said that
Beavers intimated that it would be well
to see Perry S. Heath, then First Assist
ant Postmaster General, whose name
Beavers Is said to have used very freely.
There apears to be no .direct testimony
that Heath received any of the stock,
however.
LOUD EXONERATED.
In connection with this company the
ram<? of ex-Representative Loud of Cali
fornia has been mentioned in the past,
but it is paid by officials in authority
that there is no testimony in the hands
of the Grand Jury implicating Loud in
any way. He is paid to have acted for
Richardscn. as is common for a Repre
sentative in Conffrc-ss to act for his con
stituents, and there is no evidence show
ing that he was a stockholder ln the San
Francisco company.
MeGiehan, Huntington and Machen
were indicted for conspiracy to defraud
the Government ln connection with the
contract to furnish package boxes to the
Government. McGiehan is said to have
obtained a contract to furnish boxes from
July l, 1K'3, to June 1. 1S97. Machen is
s-aid to have been instrumental in bring
ing- about an increase in the price paid
to McGiehan, who took Huntington in as
a partner before the expiration of the
contract. The extra compensation is said
to have been shared with Machen.
The official statement regarding the in
dictments follows:
The indictment against Beavers, Machen
and Erwin alleges in substance that the
I'ostai Device and Improvement Company
of San Francisco, formerly the Montague
Indicator and Letter Box Company, by
resolution of October 6, 1S99, set aside 1000
thares of its stock to be used in any le
gitimate way its president might think
proper in forwarding the Interests of the
company. Armed with this authority, the
president, Daniel 6. Richardson, accom
panied by Erwin, came to Washington.
Erwin was then a postoffice inspector
and the company was composed almost
entirely of postofflce employes in the
West. Erwin introduced Richardson to
ali ihe postofflce officials at Washington
and Beavers, Machen. Heath and others
examined the devices.
SECURE AN ORDER.
As a result an order for equipping 20S9
letter boxes with the device was secured.
About that time, on a suggestion from
Beavers, concurred in by Machen, the
name of the company was changed and- it
was arranged that all postofflce officials
should disappear from its management.
Beavers and Machen became the owners
of blocks cf the stock, both under as
sumed names. The company was then
systematically relieved of its obligations
in the way of paying freight, crating and
printing cards for the devices it was fur
nishing.
Out of the 1000 shares of stock set aside
as above mentioned most al lof it went
to different postofHce officials. The presi
dent of the company afterward came tq
Washington again with the request that
an increase be made in the compensation
the company was receiving for its device.
The- request was granted. Dividends were
afterward r>aid on the stock.
The indictment against McGiehan,
Huntington and Machen alleges that Mc-
Giehan was the person interested in the
profits from certain contracts from the
United States for furnishing packages
from July 1, 1833, to June 1, 1837; that in
pursuance of a scheme to defraud the
United States, Machen recommended to
his superiors that the compensation of
the contractor be Increased. In payment
for attaching a different support to the
boxes, which raised them higher from the
ground. This scheme was- put through
and afterward, when Huntington became
interested in the contracts with Mc-
Giehan they continued to receive the
extra compensation.
PAYMENTS IN DETAIL.
The indictment is in ten counts, the first
two counts charging the payment of $100
to Machen on September 1, 1&00; the third
and fourth counts alleging the payment
of t2lO on December 30, 1900; the fifth and
sixth counts the payment of $250 Febru
ary 4, 1S01; the seventh and eighth counts
the payment of $350 March 2, 1501; the
ninth and tenth counts the payment of
$225 on March 15. 1501.
Thft other indictment against McGiehan,
Huntington ar.d Machen is in fifteen
counts:, on the same facts as set forth in
the first indictment, these being conspir
acy to bribe an officer of the United
States.
The indictment against McGiehan and
Huntingdon for bribery alleges that Ma
then procured the payment of $1 25 on
each of the package boxes additional to
the contract, or for which the device
which lifted them higher from the ground,
when the sum paid for that attachment
should not have exceeded 73 cents. Mc-
Giehan agreed to pay Machen 50 cents
from each $1 25 with the concurrence of
Hunthigton. who was then interested in
the contracts with McGiehan, as the Co
lumbia Supply Company, for bis own per
sonal use.
SCHEMES TO DEFRAUD.
The Indictment against Scheble and Ma
chen alleges that Eugene D. Schebel of
Toledo became interested with the firm of
Maybury & Ellis of Detroit, of which
town Maybury is the Mayor, in securing
contracts with the United States for fur
nishing letter boxes; that in pursuance of
their scheme to defraud the Government,
Machen induced the department to order
large quantities of letter boxes for the ru
ral free delivery service; quantities ln ex
cess of what was needed or used; and that
Machen, In his official capacity, approved
the bills for the same. Maybury & Ellis
paid Seheble to the extent of his interest
in the company and he in turn paid large
turns to Machen.
The indictment Is in seventeen counts,
the first three charging the payment by
Scheble to Machen of J1500 on September
12. 1300; the fourth count charging this or
dering by Machen of 6000 letter boxes on
September 21. 1300; the fifth, sixth and
seventh counts charging the payment to
Machen cf CO on September 20, 1S00. The
eighth, ninth and tenth counts charge the
payment to Machen of $2000 on November
22, 19O0; the eleventh count charges the
payment to Machen of $1159 on November
Â£3. 1900; the twelfth, thirteenth and four
teenth counts charge tha payment of
$20* to Machen on February 11, 1901; the
fifteenth. sixteenth and seventeenth
count* charge the payment of $134 to
Machen on June 10. 1901. The other In
dictir.cr.ts against the defendants have
the same number of 'counts, on the same
fact*, the charge being conspiracy to
bribe an officer of the United States.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED.
Immediately following the presentation
of Colonel Drake's resolution Thomas
King Muir of Portland rose and read a
telegram from the Oregon State Miners'
Association, sending greetings to tho min
ing congress and .asking that Portland
be selected as the meetine place for 1904.
Muir proceeded' to say that Portland
wanted the American Mining Congress,
and that it wanted to entertain the mem
bers and delegates at a time when there
would be no diverting circumstances
which would tend to interfere with the
accomplishment of the best results by
the congress, as would be the case if Its
sessions were held in 1905 coincident with
the centennial. He said the citizens of
Portland wished to bo in a position to
devote themselves exclusively to the en
tertainment of those attendant upon the
mining congress and therefore he asked
that Portland be chosen for next year
rather than 1903.
The constitution and by-laws, which
were the special order for this morning's
session of the American Mining Congress,
were adopted in the afternoon, as sub
mitted, with the exception of two minor
changes. These consisted in the reduc
tion of the number of delegates to be ap
pointed by the Governor of a State from
fifteen to ten and the reduction of the
number of delegates to be appointed by a

FAVORS EAULEEB, DATE.
LEAD, S. D., Sept.. 1Lâ The adoption of
a constitution^ and by-laws, the adoption
of a resolution asking the Unltod States
Congress Â¦ to pass a law for the estab
lishment of a Department of Mines, with
a representative in the President's Cab
inet, and the reading of a letter from
Senator. Morgan of Alabama in response
to an - invitation from Secretary , Man on
to attend and address the congress, werÂ«
the principal features of to-day'3 sessions
of the American Mining Congress.
It developed to-day that the Oregon
delegation is not quite a unit on the mat
ter of holding next year's sessions of the
mining congress at Portland- : This be
came apparent when Frank V. Drake of
Portland asked the congress to adopt a
resolution to the effect that It Is the Bense
of the American Mining Congress that In
recognition of the enormous benefits
which have accrued to tne mining In
dustry of the country from the consum
mation of the Lewis and Clark expedition
in 1805, which resulted in the acquisition
by the United States of tha Territory
of Oregon, comprising the present States
of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and parts
of Montana, Wyoming and Dakota, those
States would contribute ln every way pos
sible to the success of the centennial cel
ebration of the Lewis and CJark Ex
position, to be held in .Portland in 1905,
and that in furtherance of this object
the congress also resolve to meet in
Portland for its annual session in 1905.
The resolution was referred to a com
mittee, which reported in favor of its
adoption with the clause referring to the
1905 meeting stricken out, and it was
adopted.

During the early part of this evening the
portions of the district which are lighted
by Le Belle Power and Light Company
were in darkness, the company for some
reason delaying to turn on the current.
Complaints were made at military head
quarters by the citizens, and It 13 saM

As a result of this and other similar
accidents General Bell announced to

that unused prospect holes must be either
filled or covered must be complied with at

delay would be permitted in this matter.

WXLIi HAVE A BUSY DAY.
To-day Assistant Secretary Armstrong
will inspect the Mint, the sub- Treasury
and the Custom-house and will confer
with certain officials as to the needs for
further protection on this coast for navi
gation.
While thÂ« latter subject 13 now under
control of Secretary Cortelyou, of the De

him to furnish Secretary Cortelyou with
important facts as to the absolute and
pressing need for more safeguards for
vessels plying on the Pacific Coast.
Assistant Secretary Armstrong Is but
29 years of age. He was born in Iowa
and was engaged for some years In news
paper work. He was a valued member of
the press In Chicago and also was Eastern

of persons coming from the Orient on
the same vessels.
Passengers arriving in San Francisco
from Honolulu are classed as "coast"
travelers. Articles In their possession
which the San Francisco customs officials
might declare dutiable are assumed to
have left Honolulu duty paid. In other
words, the articles are supposed to have
had the duty paid upon them when taken
into the Hawaiian Islands from foreign
ports.
The certification of a Honolulu passen
ger's stateroom effects will do away with
considerable delay on arrival* ln San
Francisco. A customs officer will be able
to quickly check the contents of valises
with the certified list, while the heavy
baggage of such passenger will be ex
empt from examination, having left Hon
olulu under seal.
Should tho stateroom effects of a Hono
lulu passenger not tally with the certi
fied list It will bÂ« clear proof that a
through passenger from the Orient has
enlisted the aid of such Honolulu pas
senger, for the purpose of smuggling, ard
detection will be easy for the customs
officials.
CATJSED MUCH ANNOYANCE.
Under the rule recently rescinded all
baggage of travelers from the Orient, to
gether with that belonging to Honolulu
passengers, was examined by the cus
toms officers at Honolulu, wheirsuch per
sons traveled on through steamships,
while passengers on vessels plying only be

not subject to examination. The obnox

delay and complications and the new or

the steamship companies to work ln har

ARMIES OF TURKEY AND BULGARIA
ON PEACE AND ON WAR FOOTINGS
SOUTHPORT. England. Sept. 11.â The
British Association for the Advancement
of Science to-day elected Premier Balfour
to be president of the meeting to be held
in 1904 at Cambridge, and has decided
that the meeting of 1905 shall be held In
South Africa.
Balfour Elected President.
SOFIA, Sept. 1Lâ The revolutionary
headquarters here ' has received
from Burg-ass news of fearful
atrocities committed by the Turkish and
Albanian soldiers in the vilayet of Adrl
anople. A squadron of Turkish cavalry
intercepted and slaughtered fugitives at
tempting to cross Into Bulgaria. Sixty
Bulgarians were killed within three kilo
metres of the frontier. The whole dis
trict of Losengrad Is filled with Albanian
troops, who are burning villages and
massacring the Inhabitants. They have
killed fifty persons and have slain fifteen
others in the village of Kula, twenty
two old people in the village of Ekleer,
eighteen families at Taspata and twenty
families at Asmldiglk.
Eighty families fleeing from various vil
lages toward the frontier have been lit
erally cut to pieces by Turkish soldiers
during the last few days. Hundreds of
old men, women and children from the
district of Losengrad have crossed the
frontier.
A large body of infantry and cavalry,
with three mountain batteries, attacked
an insurgent band in the mountains about
Vasiliko. The Insurgents waited the near
approach of the troops and then hurled
bombs at them. After two hours' fight
ing the Turks were forced to retire, with
the loss of twenty men killed and many
wounded. The loss of the insurgent
forces was light. . â¢ ,.
The first Indication of the Greeks aid
ing the Bulgarians against Turkey ap
pears In a circular addressed by the gen
eral staff of the eighth revolutionary dis
trict to the Greek towns and villages In
the vilayet of Adrlanople. It expresses
pleasure at hearing that the Greeks de
sire to join their Bulgarian brethren in
the fight for liberty, and invites the
Greeks to send delegates to formulate
plans for joint action. The mixed popu
lation of Greeks and Bulgarians in fif
teen villages of the district of Kostur
have Joined the Insurrection.
Further details of the village burnings
and massacres committed In the vilayet
of Monastir have been reported here from
reliable sources at Salonlca. The names
are given of thirty-four villages In the
Kaza and Okrida districts which have
been burned by the Turk^Â»
At Velgoshto, near Ortai&I, twelve men
and women perished in the flames. Sixty
peasants were killed in this neighborhood,
most of the bodies being left unburled.
Nine villages and a large forest have been
burned in the Kaza of Alen. At Podmo
chanl and Pokovionik many women and
children were killed. ": f
In the Kaza of Presba the soldiers sur
rounded a forest In which the women and
children from the villages of Louboino
and Bratlchino were concealed. They vio
lated the women and put many of them to
death. The monastery of St. Colm In the
Kaza of Valay has been plundered. The
town of Klissura Is filled with refugees
from the burned villages in the district.
Including many wounded women from the
neighborhood of Klissura and Neveska.
The large number of bodies lying unburled
and decomposirfe has caused an epidemic
among the Turkish troops, from which
many have died.
Reports are beginning to arrive from
Adrlanople which Indicate that the Turks
are employing similar measures to sup
press the outbreak in the vilayet as have
been used in Monastir, and it is feared
that when the Asiatic troops reach the
district even more appalling atrocities will
be committed.
Telegrams from Budapest announce
that the Austrian Government has
stopped Xhe transport of 15.000,000 Mann
licher rifle cartridges which Bulgaria
contracted for in Hungary.
It appears that the cartridge firm Is
unable to complete the order in the speci
fied time and borrowed cartridges from
the Government magazine, with the re
sult that the officials stopped the delivery
of them.
The Insurrection In Eastern Macedonia
is progressing slowly. General Zontcheff
has been engaged in three skirmishes
with the Turks in the district of Djlmoua.
The insurgents fought a band of Bashl
Bazouks between Poplda and Varltlsch,
In the district of Vails. The Bashl Ba
zouks lost eighty men. Next day the reg
ular troops pursued the insurgents Into a
forest,' but fell into an ambuscade, in
which many of them perished.
Many of the inhabitants of Monastir
and In the village cf Dobrokavl were
killed by Turkish artillery.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. ' 11.â An
. official dispatch received here an
nounces that the imperial troop3
recaptured Vasiliko on Sunday last after
the insurgents" occupying the place had
been attacked by 2000 Turkish troops with
two cannon.
The release of Abdul Kader, the natur
alized citizen of the United States, from
imprisonment at Tripoli. Syria, and the
dismissal of Reshld Pasha, the vail of
Beirut, are taken to Inalcate that the
granting, of the other demands of Minis
ter Leishmen will not be long delayed.
The American Consul at Beirut reports
that the situation there is Improving,
thanks to the confidence inspired by
Nazlm Pasha, who has succeeded Reshld
Pasha. Rumors of fresh outrages con
tinue to reach Constantinople, but these
reports are deliberately spread with the
object of creating the impression that Â£he
present situation at Beirut was provoked
by the arrival there of the United States
warships.
As a matter of fact a desperate state
of affairs ic chronic at Beirut. Insecur
ity has prevailed there for monthsâprac
tically throughout Reshid Pasha's ten
ure of office. The present Grand Visier
pix months. ago asked the Sultan to re
move Reshid Pasha, but the latter'a sup
porters at the palace were too powerless.
Reshld Pasha is alleged to have made a
large fortune by corrupt administration.
He owns extensive property in Cyprus.

Tolstoi's Seventy-Fifth Birthday.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 11.â Count
Tolstoi spent his seventy-fifth birthday In
strict privacy among his children at Tula.
He was In the best of health. The papers
printed glowing eulogies of the count on
the occasion of his birthday.
PARIS, Sept. 11.â The commander
of ' the French Mediterranean
squadron at Toulon has received
orders to hold in readiness to leave for
the Levant a naval division consisting of
the battleship Bennus, the armored
cruiser Latouche Treville, the second
class cruiser Du Chayla and the third
class cruiser Llnols, under the command
of Admiral Jaureguiberry. Â¦ ,
Reports received by the Foreign Office
here from Constantinople say there is re
newed agitation among the Mussulmans
within the city and fears are expressed of
a possible Mussulman attack on- the
Christian population. This agitation fol
lowed the appearance in the 1 Turkish pa
pers of accounts of the Bulgarians dyna
miting trains and blowing up the steam
boat Vaskapu. The Government consid
ered that official sanction of the publica
tion of the news was the best means to
avoid exaggerated stories of the explo
sions. As the Government had rigorously
suppressed any mention "of explosions
during the past twenty years the recent
publications caused widespread agitation.
The official report says the Mussulmans
are eager to avenge the outrages and
stales that the feeling is so intense that
if the Bulgarians commit any further de
struction the Mussulmans are likely to
take redress by attacking the Christian
population. Earnest representations on
the subject have been made to the Porte,
which has given assurances that all pre
cautions will be taken, and has reiterated
Its confidence that it will be able to con
trol the situation.

then had the course of the vessel altered.
As the schoner drew near he saw the
ship bottom up and the bleached arms of
living persons clinging to the capsized
thing. He distinguished, moreover, the
dark hair of a woman floating over the
seas as the waves ran and fell along the
bobbing keel.
Two men and the woman caught a ;ine
and held on. They were dragged aboard
like so many fish. Captain King decided,
from the weak and terribly emaciated
condition of those whom he had rescued
that it would be too great a risk to de
l>end upon the line to save other lives.
The men would surely be drowned if they
released their hold upon the wreck. With
celerity the Fielding's crew unlashed a
lx>at and put It overboard and the cap
taJn In i>erson took the five men into It
a:id carried them aboard ship.
The rescued persons were in a very
serious condition. They had been without
lood or water for four days and nights.
Their vessel, a small schooner, the name
cf which Captain King could not ascer
tain, had, five days before the wreck was
sighted, left the island of Gonalve. Hayti,
for the Island of MIrigoane, carrying sev
enteen persons, including the captain, and
was leaded with fruit and provisions of
native production. Her crew were all
French Haytian negroes.
CASTAWAYS ON SHIP'S KEEL
It Is believed here that Japan relies on
the United States to join her in making
urgent representations to induce the Rus
sian withdrawal without conditions,
which, it is repeated, were not suggested
when the promise to retire was made.
Viscour.t Hayashi. the Japanese Min
ister here, has not been notified as to the
attitude which the authorities at Tokio
will adopt. It Is said that Russia re
quires China to signify her acceptance of
all her demands, as a condition to the
evacuation of Manchuria, and that she
has made no move to withdraw from
Manchuria, though she has pledged her
word to complete the evacuation by Octo
ber 8.
This materially changes the optimistic
view token of the Far Eastern situation
which the Japanese based upon the first
reports of the Russian note. It is learned
that Japan has advised all her represen
tatives abroad of the details of the Rus
eian demands, which she now evidently
construes as a determination on the part
of Russia to maintain her grasp on Man
<. huria.
LONDON*, Sept. 11.â The British For
eign Office has received official confirma
tion of the London Times dispatch from
Peking, published September 10, saying

NEW YORK. Sept. 11.â Edwin D. Moers.
a wealthy young Califomian, was re
leased from Ludlow street Jail to-night
after being In custody for three months
under a suit for divorce and alimony
brought by his wife. Dorothy B. Moers.
J. C. Robinson, a friend of Moer's fam

which was deposited with a local trust
company with an arrangement under
which any sums recovered by Mrs. Moers
are to be paid to her by the trust com
pany. ". j ;
Moers' adventures have few parallels
outside of fiction, and also the career
of Mrs. Moers. He was to sail for Eu
rope on June 17 last with his mother.
On the preceding day he was arrested.
Previous to this Moers had come to New
York, concealed his identity and obtained
employment in the chorus of the "Mock

WASHINGTON. Sept. 11.â Now
that the United States has
been drawn into the vortex of
the Turkish crisis it proposes to be able
to wield as strong a hand In affairs at
the Sublime Porte as any European
power. The State Department Is anxious
that the American legation at Constanti
nople be elevated to an embassy with a
corresponding advance of the Turkish le
gation at Washington.
American diplomacy at the Porte suffers
materially, as Mr.Leishman is only a min
ister. He meets with vexatious delays in
seeing officials with whom he can confer
advantageously in a delicate situation
such as now exists. Were ne an Embas
sador, a personal representative of the
President of the United States, he would
be entitled to personal audiences with the
Sultan. Such is the prestige now enjoyed
by the European powers. -
President Roosevelt realizes the great
obstacle which lies In Irishman's low
rank. Several months ago after repeated
representations through the usual chan
nels, President Roosevelt sent a letter to
the Sultan through Mr. Leiahman, who
delivered it personally. The result was
a better agreement on the long pending
questions than the State Department had
expected to obtain.
Leishman in a cable to the State Depart
ment to-day explained the error which
led to his notifying the department that
Vice-Consul Megelsson had been killed.
Consul Ravndal filed to Lelshman a ci
pher message stating that Megelssen had
been shot at. "When the message was
received at the American legation by
Leishman and translated it read that Mr.
Megelssen had been "shot, assassinated."
The error Is explained by the fact that
the cipher symbol for the word "at" Is
with the exception of a digit the same
as for "assassinated."
The following bulletin was posted at
the Navy Department to-day:
"Rear Admiral Cotton telegraphs from
Beirut September 10, that the Governor
General of Damascus has been appointed
Acting Governor General at Beirut and
has expressed a desire to settle the case
of the American Vice-Consul satisfactor
ily to the United States. Beirut quiet,
business Improving, confidence Increas
ing."
A long cablegram reached the State De
partment from Minister Leishman on the
general Turkish situation which has not
yet been made public. The prestige of Mr.
Leishman at Constantinople has greatly
Increased since the appearance of the Eu
ropean squadron off Beirut, and the scope
of his representations to the Porte has
also increased In the last few days. It
Is understood that our Government will
push to an early conclusion all its pend
ing claims against Turkey.
Chekib Bey, the Turkish Minister, was
a caller at the State Department to-day,
bringing further reassuring advices that a
condition of complete peace has been es
tablished at Beirut.
Alaskan Commission as Guests.
LONDON. Sept. 11.â The Pilgrims' Club
will entertain the members of the Alas

BERLIN, Sept. 1Lâ The Lokal Anzeiger
to-day published a dispatch from Sofia,
Bulgaria, saying that Prince Ferdinand
has not yet returned to the captital and
that he is in seclusion at the castle of Eu
xineograd with several favorites, all the
approaches to the castle being strongly
guarded by soldiers. All the purveyors
for the royal establishment, it is added,
are searched. before entering the castle.

FERDINAND IN TEBEOE.
The same communication maintains
that there were only eight persons killed
and fifteen wounded in the affray at
Beirut, and that many fugitives to L&h
,anon are returning to their homes.
According to special dispatches from
Constantinople the Mussulmans sacked
Christian houses during the disorders at
Beirut and sensattonaK rumors of all
kinds are current, including a general
massacre at -Beirut, the imminent dyna
miting of public buildings and the poison-
Ing of the water supply at Constantino
ple. Â¦
From Vienna comes again an uncon
firmed reoort ttiat Boris Sarafoff, the
Macedonian leader, has been "murdered
near Monastir.
The Dally Mail's correspondent at Mon
astir, in a dispatch dated September 6,
claims that himself, British Vice Consul
McGregor and an American missionary
named Bond, are the Intended victims of
Turkish revenge because they reported
the Turkish atrocities. If their murder
could be compassed it would be fathered
upon the. Bulgarians.
The correspondent describes further the
atrocities by soldiers. In one case they
flayed a little girl's head, while In another
they dug the. flesh from under a woman's
arm with pocketknives in order to see the
working' of her lungs.
A Constantinople dispatch to the Dally
Mail, dated September 10, says the Porte
telegraphed to Washington asking to have
the American squadron recalled from Bei
rut, the request being refused. Minister
Leischmann declared that It would re
main until the departure of the late vail,
Rehsld Pasha.
Officials of the German Embassy here
to-day said that there was no truth in
the statement made by the Constantino
ple correspondent of the London Standard
to the effect that there was reason to
believe that â¢ Germany was encouraging
Turkey to rigorously suppress the Mace
donian Insurrection without regard for
European remonstrances. It was assert
ed at the Embassy that the essential
principle of German policy was to agree
to the proposal of Russia and Austria
and that . beyond so doing Germany had
not taken any steps in the Balkan situa
tion.
Private letters from Monastir state the
Wallachlan inhabitants of Krushevo fully
confirm the charges made by the Bulgari
ans that the Turkish soldiers and Bashi
Bazottks outraged and slaughtered de
fenseless women and children there, the
atrocities continuing two days and nights.
As the Wallachians hate the Bulgarians!
their testimony in this instance carries
considerable weight. I-IIlml Pasha has
admitted that thirty Bashl Bazouks were
concerned In the affair, Hilml says that
these Bashl Bazouks stole 400 cattle, all
of which have been restored to the own
ers, but the latter say that not a hoof has
been restored. .
The Turkish embassy in London. In Its
denial issued daily of Turkish dtroclties,
to-day declares it to be "absolutely false
that Ottoman troops are burning villages,
the truth being that it is the Bulgarians
who at the approach of the troops use
explosives to burn the villages before
leaving them and then accuse the Turk
ish troops of such abominable deeds."
The news that a French squadron is
going to the Levant Is also considered
ominous, and this step by the French
Government probably will be followed by
similar action en the part of other pow
ers.
LONDON, Sept. 11.â The powers are
evidently still exerting pressure
both at Constantinople and Sofia to
avert a Turko-Bulgarian war, apparently
with some temporary success, but mean
time an increasing terrible tale of atroci
ties committed in Macedonia shows that
the situation Is daily becoming aggra
vated.

load of powder set on a Frisco siding near
Beaumont by a freight crew which did
not want to handle it while switching got
beyond control and ran several miles on
a branch line toward Winfleld, colliding
with a train which had left that station
shortly before, and exploded, killing two

The explosion tore up several rods of
track and dismantled a locomotive. The
shock of the explosion shook the ground
for miles around. People In Eldorado ran
frem their houses, fearing that an earth
quake had come and that buildings would
collapse. Other towns in the vicinity wera
also shaken up.
The fire which threatened Camp Vaca
tion near Guerneville has taken a new
start. It burned over the beautiful Rus
sian River heights, but with the help of
many willing workers the cottages and
buildings at the summer resort were
saved. To-day's wind caused it to break
out again on the west side of the moun
tain and may do much damage to the re
sort. Camp Vacation is not in much dan

between It and the flre.
SANTA ROSA, Sept 11.â There are four
forest fires fiercely raging in Sonoma
County and many ranches and much prop

wind now blowing does not die down. This
morning about 7 o'clock a brush fire start
ed on the Bucchl ranch on Humbug
creek about eight miles east, of this city
and a etrone wind soon fanned it into a
huge forest blaze. A section of land
about flve miles in diameter has been
burned over. The ranch property has
been saved so far, but is threatened.
The fire which was raging on the So

Another fire started this afternoon on
the Bertoli ranch between the town of

HUNTINGTON" TO IMPBOVB
HIS FRESNO HOLDINGS
FRESNO, Sept. 11.â A. C. Balch. vice
president of the San Joaquin Power Com
pany and official representative of the in
terests of H. E. Huntington in this coun
ty, to-day announced that during the
coming year Huntington will spend $250,
000 In Improving his Fresno property. The
greater part of the- money will be used In
developing further electric power, the
present supply being inadequate to meet
the demand of further improvements.
Much work will be done in harnessing the
waters of the San Joaqutn to furnish ad
ditional power. The entire system for
distributing the electricity will be rebuilt
and all the latest appliances win be
put in.
The City Water Works will be extended
to Include territory even outside the city
limits, the present plan being to build a
suburban circuit, giving the people out
side the limits as good a supply as to be
obtained closer in. For the present the
extension work of the electric car line will
be discontinued. The property as it stands
consumes practically all the power avail
able and the extension of the system will
be postponed until the new lines from the
mountains are run in.
The Huntington scheme for harnessing
the waters of the San Joaquin is a gigantic
undertaking, and, if carried out, will give'
Fresno the greatest electric supply sys
tem in the world. The water rights on the

SAN JOSE, Sept. 11.â In the action of
Professor Barthel and other deposed
teachers of the city schools against the
Board of Education for reinstatement.
Judge Rhodes decided to-day that the
plaintiffs had been illegally removed from
their positions because one month's no
tice had not been given. This does not
mean reinstatement, though back salary
may be collected, for the board has re
cently removed the serving teachers in
the manner prescribed by the court rul
ing.
Teachers May Recover Back Salary.
James McConchie, a watchman, who
lives at 1746 Ellis street, had a narrow es
cape from death. He was In the shed
when the flre started and his exit was
cut off by the flanvs. He rushed to the
lower end of the shed at Fifth and
Townsend and his outcries were heard by
Policemen P. Hammond, Coleman and
Hynes.
The trio rushed across to the burning
structure and tried to break in the heavy
door. Â¦ Their united efforts â¢were unsuc
cessful and an ax was hurriedly brought
from engine No. 10 and an opening was
made. McConchie wis dragged 'forth in a
semi-conscious condition. His hands
were burned and he was suffering frpm
inhaling the smoke. He was sent to the
Emergency Hospital and was attended by
physicians and put to bed. While his in
juries are painful, he is in no danger.
George Brinkerhoff of Truck No. 1
was also affected by smoke and was sent
to the hospital for treatment.
Some of the wires of the train dispatch
er's department were destroyed by the
flre and the train service was handi
capped until they were replaced.
A second alarm was turned in and more
engines rushed to the scene. Two bat
teries operated on Townsend street and
several streams played on the burning
structure. During the height of the flre
the brakemen employed In the Southern
Pacific yards moved their locomotives on
the sidings and hauled the burning freight
cars farther up the track. Streams were
then turned on the cars and the flames
were extinguished.
Cnief Dougherty saw that it was impos
sible to save the shed, and he devoted
the energies of the department to pre
venting the fire from spreading. In this
he was successful, as the flre was confined
to shed I. Had the wind been blowing'
there is every probability that the entire
freight sheds of the railroad company
would have been destroyed.
The loss is heavy. The shed was loaded
with merchandise for Southern points as
far as New Orleans. What the lbss is
will not be ascertained until the bills of
lading are examined. The building was
simply a long shed and can be quickly
replaced. The freight cars were loaded
with merchandise and hay. Many were
destroyed and the others were so badly
damaged that they will havo to be re
built. â¢ -
An alarm was turned in by one of the
brakemen employed in the yard. When
he discovered the blaze it was in the cen
ter of shed I, which contains -the southern
overland freight. He rushed to the fire
alarm box at Sixth and Townsend streets
and turned in box 182. When the district
chief arrived the entire shed was envel
oped in flames and freight cars on the
side tracks were also ablaze.
Freight cars and freight sheds of the
Southern Pacific Company were destroyed
by fire shortly before midnight. The long
shed on Townsend street, between Fifth
and Sixth, was a total loss, and more
than fifty freight cars were burned. The
fire was a difficult one to handle, but Act
ing Chief Dougherty and his men had the
conflagration under control in quick or

The unfortunate attorney claims that
the first he knew of the disbarment pro
ceedings was the notice of Its accomplish
ment on May 21, 1903. It came as a stag
gering blow to himself and family, for
he had hoped that out In this Western
world the mortifying past might be for
gotten in the making of a new career and
a good name. But the haunting ghosts
of alleged misdeeds and the persistency
of those who have deemed it their duty
to proceed against him have accomplished
Hovey's defeat and left him a discour
aged, almost hopeless man.
Hovey made a statement, in which he
denies guilt of wrongdoing. He recites In
detail the various ramifications of the
cases in the Maine courts which led to
the proceedings against him. He declares
that he did not remain in> Maine to de
fend himself because he had been assured
that the cases against him would be
dropped, and his health failing, he-de
cided to remain in California. He was
admitted to the bar at San Francisco May
12, 1902, but soon thereafter came to this
city.
From Biddeford, Me., a certified copy of
a judgment had been> received showing
that Hovey had been disbarred there, the
charges being forgery .and perjury and
consequently with that Judgment standing
over him Hovey was not entitled to prac
tice in any other State. Rather than pro
ceed legally against him here, he was in
formed pf the receipt of the copy of the
judgment and .promptly withdrew from
the practice of his profession. He will
leave this part of the country.
Hovey's troubles cover a period of sev
eral vears and he claims to have been
hounded by bitter personal and political
enemies.
LOS ANGELES, Sept 11.â Facing thÂ©
absolute certainty of disbarment because
of misdeeds profesional and otherwise al
leged to have been committed by him at
his former home in Maine, Frank W.
Hovey, who for more than a year has
been practicing law in this 'city and who
had attained considerable prominence at
the Los Angeles County bar, has request
ed through the Car association the cancel
lation of his certificate aria will seek a
livelihood in other fields of endeavor. Had
he not taken this action the grievance
committeeof the Los Angeles County
Bar Association would have begun dis
barment proceedings from which there
could have been but one result.
Special Dispatch to The Call.

ary Society for this district unless rec
ommended by the conference.

CYANIDE OF -POTASSIUM
Repfoved by His Son for Intemperate
Habits, He Leaves Home
and Dies.
James B. Moulin killed himself yester
day because Â»he had been upbraided by
his son Louis for his dissipated habits.
The' suicide was 74 years old and a candy
maker. He had been out of employment
for some time and had been residing with
his son's family.
His son had reproved him several times
for drinking so much, and the old man
resented the reproof, and left his son's
house last Thursday morning, taking his
trunk with him. At 8 o'clock yesterday
morning his dead body was found lying
on the steps of 520 Natoma street, a
small pill box labeled "cyanide of po
tassium" and a flask half full of whisky
lying at* his feet. The whisky had the
strong characteristic odor of cyanide of
potassium.
The dead man was a native of France
and a widower.
Robs Printing 1 Office.
' The susnicious actions of a man on
Clay street, between Montgomery and
Sansome. last night attracted the atten
tion of Patrolman J. E. Reed and Special
Officer Frank Glllen. They followed tRe
man and were finally rewarded by catch
ing him coming out of the Shannon print
ing establishment. 509 Clay street. On
being searched a "jimmy" with which he
had forced an entrance to the printing
place was found in the prisoner's pocket.
The pocket also contained many nickels,
Â¦which it was afterward discovered had
been stolen from the telephone In Shan
non's office. The telephone had been
broken open by the fellow. At the prison
he gave his name as Patrick J. Nolan.
He is supposed to be the man who has
lately been committing numerous robber
ies in that particular quarter of the city.

fall that causes the contractors to rush ,the
delivery work. There. Is another and perhaps
more potent reason. In all contracts there is
a strike clause, providing that In case of any
labor trouble the companies will be under no"
obligations to take supplies during the exist
ence of such trouble. This provision has acted
as a spur to those furnishing supplies to get
them all on the ground as quickly as possible
while everything is moving along peacefully.

The Redding Searchlight says that the
Eastern parties interested In the Balak
lala mine, on Squaw Creek, Shasta Coun
ty, are coming out to inspect it. Seventy
five men and five drills are kept running
constantly on development work. Drifts
and upraises are being run in the lower
levels. The ore is being blocked out into
100-foot squares.
A queer circumstance is receiving the
attention of the Amador Ledger, which
says:
The~Keystone people have expended a large
amount of money in opening up their'prop
erty A hard-rock tunnel was run In a dis
tance of 430O feet, which tapped the ledge
some 000 feet below the old works. Twenty
men are employed. A drift is now being run
to tap the shoot below the shaft. In time
the company will erect a mill on the property.
The old Sierra Buttes keeps pegging away.
Fifty men are employed in working above
the No. 7 tunnel. Thirty stamps are kept
running. Richard Phelan is at the head of
the Buttes Saddle mine, which is opened up
by a long tunnel. It is expected that much
more work will be done there in the near
future. A local Sierra City company, com
prised of A. Thomas, C. Joat, J. Johnston and
others, is the owner of the William Tell mine.
They have the mine opened up by- a tunnel
and some very promising ore has been taken
out, with a good prospect of a mine ahead.
There is a ledge which averages from twenty
to thirty feet in the Poken Flat mine, while
the ore assays $15 to the ton. A roller mill
on the mine has crushed much ore and the
company feels encouraged. J. \V. Finney haÂ«
done a great amount of work at the Tele
graph mine, eight miles above Downieville.
At the Belcher gravel property fifteen men are
employed.
The Papoose mine, in Jim Crow Canyon,
owned by Wehe. Taylor & Morse, is under
bond to E. F. Harris, who Is running a tun
nel. One ledge has already been tapped and
there are several hundred feet of backs. I.
Copeland has run a long tunnel at the Buck
ingham mine In Jim Crow Canyon, to tap
the ledge under the old shaft Around Logan

Sierra City, a long tunnel has been run
to tap the ledge, a local company doing
the work. This summer considerable
work has been done on the tunnel at the
Colombo mine, near Sierra City. Some
timeâ ago a cave occurred and the ore
shoot was lost, but an effort is being,
made to, find it again. Messrs. Cook,
Spellenbcrg, Devlne and others have been
working the mine for a company. The
old Freeborough mine, near Poker Flat;
has been worked for years, and last
spring a fine run was made, over eighty
ounces of gold being taken out In two
weeks' time, the work being done with a
hand mortar. It la expected that the mill
will be running soon, as the old ditch has
been repaired. Hayes, Flint & Co. are the
owners of the Queen mine, near Logan
vllle. They have a\ tunnel Into the ledge.
It is expected that a San Francisco com
pany will take hold\of the property. Ten
men have been employed at the Moun
taineer mine, which .Is owned by T. Berg
er and operated by /an Eastern company.
An air compressor and pump were install
ed several months (ago and a shaft has
been sunk from tha tunnel, in which the
ledge is of good qublity.

The words "song recital" gain new
meaning when a singer like Denis O'Sulli- !
van is at the back of them. Last night
Stelnway Hall was crowded with an au
dience that? listened to a programme of
twenty-six songs (without encores) and at
the end clamored for more. Tho pro
gramme throughout was a delight. Illus
trating every phase of Mr. O' Sullivan's
versatile art. Irish songs, German songs,
Strauss and Esposito, songs grave and
gay, lively and severe, the singer seems
equally at home in them all. The Strauss
song3 were the chief novelties of the
evening, and If Strauss were always so
Interpreted there would be lrttle danger
of him being charged with unmuslcal
ness. r Particularly happy in its brimming
humor is "Fur Funfzehn Pfennige," a
complete comedy in Mr. O'Sulllvan's ren
dering. The "Herr Lenz" is also conspic
uous for its gayety, and the tender "Mor
gen" furnishes another mood. Two songs
by Hugo Wolf are new here, the "Anac
reon's Grab" and "Fussrelse," both pleas
ing, but not greatly original. As usual,
there was a group of child songs of Tau
bert and Liza Lehmann, and as gravely
classic as Mr. O'SulIivan can be In say
"The Two Grenadiers," he is here a child
among children. Â» V ' Â¦
When this gifted Irishman sings there
Is nothing between one and the song. It
is the heart of the song, its essence, he
strives to give, and so wonderfully suc
ceeds In giving. Perhaps, though, he is
more acutely in sympathy with his Irish
ballads, that of course formed a large
part of the programme. These he seems
to have been born singing. There was a
group given last night that was sung in
the House of Commons June 3 of this
year, when Mr. O'SulIivan was the guest
of the Irish party. It was the only occa
sion on which any songs have been heard
in the House, and one wonders how the
House dare permit it when one hears the
O'SulIivan sing "The Wearing of the
Green." 'Twere enough to make Fenians
of us all. This is unhappily the singer's
only recital, and he will leave here for
England next week.

One of the Chinese substitutes made a

Deputy Gamble made the following
i-tatemen; to a reporter: "I went to the
County Jail to take down the six re
mand cases to the Gaelic. Jailer Dasher
delivered them to me, and I compared the
photos that I had with the prisoners and
they were the right ones beyond a doubt.
1 took them to the steamer at 9 o'clock
and delivered them to the steerage stew
ard. At half past 12 I went to the steam
er again and was shown the six substi
tutes. Captain Schell of the Immigration
bureau asked me whether those were the
six men that I had placed on board the
Ft earner. I replied that they were not.
There could be no mistake about it They
were not the men I had taken there."
STOBY OF A DUMMY.
Hackman Martin, who had driven the
deputy and his prisoners to the Mall dock,
r.as sent for and declared that the six
men shown him were not thÂ© ones he
had delivered to the ship. He said that
he took Deputy Marshal Gamble and six
Chinese from the Jail to the steamer,
that the hack did not stop on the way
Â«nd that no change was made whatever.
"Are these the men you delivered on
board the Gaelic this morning?" was
;,sked of him by one of the Inspectors.
"No. sir; they are not," replied Deputy
Gamble promptly.
GAMBLE DENIES.
Persons well acquainted with the Mon
golian element reported to Mr. "Wood
worth recently that it was common talk
In Chinatown that J200 and $300 per head
were being paid certain unnamed per
sons for substituting for deported and re
manded Chinese -other Chinese who wish
ed to return to their native country with
out being obliged to pay steamer fare.
It was said that in some Instances the
substitution was made at the jail, and
on other occasions at some point between
thÂ« Jail and the steamer.
Xt the request of the United States At
torney, Charles Mehan, chief Inspector of
the Chinese bureau, detailed several of
his men yesterday morning to keep watch
tt the steamer and elsewhere for the ar
rival of the Deputy United States Mar
shal, whoever he might be, and the six
young Chinese men who had been re
manded by United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock to the custody of the
steamship company, Judge Heacock hav
ing decided that they were not natives
of the United States and therefore not
entitled to be landed. Deputy United
States Marshal Peter^Gamble came down
to the Mail dock at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning in a hack with six Chinese whom
he delivered to the custody of Steerage
Steward Leslie on board the Gaelic At
half past 12 o'clock, in response to a tel
ephone message from the Chinese bureau,
he went down to the dock and was shown
six Chinese men.
This eame was blocked, however, a few |
w-f-ks apo through the efforts of Wood
worth, who obtained a ruling from Unit
rd States Circuit Judge Morrow and
I'nited States District Judge de Haven to
the effect that they would refuse to issue
writs of habeas corpus unless it appeared
on the record that the applicant's claim
to land had been investigated by the Chi
nese Bureau and that larding had been
denied the applicant.
Contrary to all expectation, this ruling
seemed to have but little result. While
it effected the object sought, that of al
lowJrig' the officers of the bureau an op
portunity of taJting- the statement of th^
epplicant before he could be coached by
his friends en shore. It did not dam the
stream cf applications for habeas corpus
writs. Although United States Court
Commissioner Heacock, whose duty It Is
to take evidence in these cases, remanded
seven out of every ten who came before
him, the appetite for writs seemed un
abated. Then It was that the suspicion
of substitution arose.
CHI1TESE BSIBEBY.
JUDGES BLOCK THE GAME.
One of the foremost officials in investi
gating the affair and in preparing for the
sensational denouement of yesterday is
I'nited States Attorney Marshall B.
VVoodwonh. He has suspected for some
time jiest that the old game of substitu
tion was being played on a larg<^ scale.
He had observed that during the past
few weeks attorneys for the Chinese had
been very assiduous Sn applying for writs
of habeas corpus, the petitions alleging
that Chinese born In the United States
nnd returning to this country after visit
ing China were illegally deprived of their
liberty by the agents of the steamship
< Â¦'Â¦imi>anlos. Th^se casos on behalf of the
Government were handled by Second As
sistant United States Attorney Duncan
K. MrKinlay and Third Assistant Ben L.
McKlr.ley with so much success that
seven out oj every ten applicants were
ordered remanded to the custody of the
t camfhip company. It was thought at
first that the writs were sotten out for
tho purpose of having the immigrants
taken from thÂ«? ship to the County Jail
for the purpose of coaching them as to
the story to be afterward told in court
by them and their witnesses.
WOODWOETH SUSPECTS.
A flagrant case of the substitution of
six Chinese for six others who had been
denied a landing was unearthed yesterday
by the Federal authorities. The Jialf
dozen dummies are now In custody and
thÂ© b:x pretended native-born Chinese
who were to have sailed for China >es
terday on the steamship Gaelic are at
laxgv.
Deputy United States Marshal Peter
Gamble !a the official who delivered six
Chineee to Steerage Steward Leslie of the
Gaelic yesterday morning. He says that
not one of the six Chinese taken off the
steamer and now held as prisoners was
ever la his custody. He will early next
week make a statement to the Federal
Grand Jury with regard to his conduct
In the matter.
According to hi* statement the substi
tution must have taken place on board
the eteamer after he had delivered his six
prisoners to the steward and affVr he had
left the dock. Officers of the Chinese Bu
reau say that this !s an impossible
theory; that In order for It to be even
remotely plausible It would be necessary
that the six substitutes Ehould be smug
pled on board and the six deported pris
oners should walk down the gangplank
in full view of the Chinese inspectors and
customs officials, and this, they say, could
not have occurred.

ers' building, in which is situated the of
fice of the United States Marshal. The
white man took them up several flights
of stairs and locked them In a room.
Later in the day he took them down
stairs, piled them Into a hack, which con
veyed them to the Mall dock, where the
same white man delivered them on board
the steamer.
The Federal authorities had taken pre
cautions before the sailing of the Gaelic
to discover whetber any substitution was
going to be attempted. Officers were sta
tioned on the Mail dock at the gang
plank of the Gaelic and on board the
steamer. They say that the six Chinese
who were delivered by Gamble were
closely watched until they were locked up
on the steamer and the door of the room
was guarded. The officials say also that
the six substitutes now In their custody
are, beyond the possibility of any doubt,
the same six who were delivered by Dep
uty United States Marshal Gamble on
board the steamer and that no further
substitution was possible.
There is considerable doing among the

SIERRA IS LIVELY.
It is pretty well understood that this offer
of the Standard Company is only a preliminary
one and will be followed right up. In the
event of the wells proving- as rood as No.
3 and the price of this oil advancing. It is the
intention of the Final Company to extend the
pipe line to the beach where \-easelg can load
readily and Without the necessary expense In
cidental to handling: the output of the wells
o\er railroad lines.
The Bakersfield Californian tells of the
plans of the Standard Oil Company In the
direction of Increasing the flow of oil
through the great pipe line that leads
from Bakersfield to Point Richmond:
While the Standard's big pipe line is car
rying a good stream of oil continufcusly to
the tanks at Point Richmond the Standard,
is still considering means of increasing its
capacity and the company has not yet given
up the project mentioned before in these
columns of Increasing the number of relay
stations. Before this Is finally determined
upon, however, an experiment is to be made
on the first division out from Bakersfleld,
where it will be ascertained definitely what
will be the effect of intermediate stations.
At the pipe line camp known aa Kimberllna,
fourteen miles from Bakersfield and half way
to Pond, the company has erected a new tank
and with the same capacity as the others on
the line and connections are now being made
from the main line to this tank. With tho
oil repumped at this relay station It will be
determined accurately Just how much, if any.
the capacity of the line can be increased. It
is expected that the actual experiment will be
made within the next ten days and If the re
sult is satisfactory the distance between the
pumping stations will be decreased by the
addition of ten more relay plants, thus making
the distance between stations fourteen instead
of twenty-eight mile*.
Great things are going on among the
oil men. but the parties In interest keep
their own counsel. Certain influences
are striving hard to pick to pieces the bij?
combination known as the Associated Oil
Company. One corporation that belonged
to the association withdrew some time
ago. A second company's acts are now
the basis of a lawsuit, in which the offi
cers of the Associated Oil Company ap
pear as the plaintiffs. Between the As
rociatcd Oil Company and the Standard
Oil Company the struggle for absolute
control of the California market Is con
tinuing with persistency. Wits are
matched against wits and capital against
capital. The Standard Oil Company has
just made a large purchase of oil In San
Luis Obispo County, taking 120,000 barrels
from the Pival Oil Company. The con
tracts are on the basis of a 23 per cent
gravity oil, the price to be regulated by a
sliding scale or graduated list, according
to the actual gravity. The San Luis
Obispo Breeze says that the deal has been
under way for some time.
The Standard Company will go to work im
mediately on the 30,000-barrel tank which will
be built at Port Harford for the reception of
the oil. It is the Intention of the TÂ»cal com
pany to pipe the oil to Graciosa station a_nd
from there to Port Harford it will be handled
by the Standard Company over the narrow
gauge line and tn cars provided by the Stand
ard.

A Danger Period Through Which
Every Woman Must Pass.
Owing to jnodern methods of living, not one woman in a thousand
approaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train
of very annoying and sometimes painful symptoms. At this period a
woman indicates a tendency towards obesity or tumorous growths.
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart
until it seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, some-
timoe-with chills, as if the heart were going to stop forever, are only
few of the symptoms of a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are
crying out for assistance. The cry should- be heeded in time. Lydia
E. Pinkliam's Vegetable Compound was prepared to meet the needs
of woman's system at this trying period of her life, and all women who
"' use it pass through this trying period with comfort and safety.

WEBBXY CAIX ?1 PEB TEAS.Russia, it is said, is creating discord between
Japan and China, that out of the row she may gain
some profit. It setms idle to provoke a fight be
tween two fellows one of whom can't quarrel and
the other dare' not. Besides, Japan is looking di
rectly to the bear for her row.
An Oakland man, seduced by the alluring adver
tisement of a better way to live, issued by an enter
prising firm, tried the treatment and had one of his
ribs broken. He is now asking damages, and it does
seem that even in Oakland going about with broken
ribs certainly is not the better way to live.
Four desperate convicts attempted to escape a few
days ago and each was dangerously wounded by the
guards. It is almost unnecessary to say that the
break for liberty did not take place in a California
penitentiary- We have more consideration for our
caged malefactors. The incident and its satisfactory
conclusion took place in Alabama.
A gang of armed and drunken French soldiers at
tacked and injured some of Uncle Sam's soldiers a
few days ago in Peking and the French commander

ous consequence to any nation. <
COMMANDER PEARY has obtained financial
backing for another voyage of Arctic ex
ploration and the Navy Department has
granted him leave of absence to undertake the ven
ture. It is expected by the explorer and by his
friends that he will this time complete the long quest
by reaching the pole. In fact Mr. Darling, Acting
Secretary of the Navy, in granting the request for
leave, said: "The discovery of the pole should be your
main object. Nothing short of that will suffice."
Commander Peary therefore will have not only the
promptings of ambition but those of friendly and
official urging to impel him to make a supreme effort
this time to crown the long work of Arctic explora
tion by making his way to the pole if it be humanly
possible to do so.
The plan upon> which the new adventure is to be
carried out promises well so far as it can be judged
by the public, and it will be accepted with confidence
coming as it does from one so experienced and so
successful in Arctic exploration as Commander
Peary. Under its terms the expedition will start next
April and go direct to Cape York at the southeast
extremity of Greenland, where a number 6f Eskimos
will be taken on board, and the company will then
proceed to Cape Columbia, a point about 400 miles
distant from the pole, where a permanent camp will
be established as a base of supplies for the various
expeditions that may be made in the direction of the
pole itself. '" "r ;.
The line of advance proposed is based upon a con
viction of Commander Peary that while the travel
immediately after leaving Cape Columbia will be ex
ceedingly rough it will become less and less difficult as
one advances. Peary says: "It is my theory that the
further one gets across the ice and away from the
land the smoother the ice will be and that finally the
traveling will be comparatively easy."
In making the advance every care will be taken to
safeguard the explorers against the dangers of the
north. As far as practicable caches containing sup
plies of all kinds will be established at frequent inter
vals along the route. I It is the expectation that by
starting in April the r ~explorcrs will be able to force
their way to Cape Columbia before being compelled to
fix winter quarters. With the earliest return of light
in the spring an expedition will set out for the pole.
In his letter of application for leave of absence
Commander Peary in outlining his plan said of that
f chase of the exploration: "I should expect to accom-
PEARY AND THE POLE
The Globe predicts that at a not distant future the
West will imitate New England and substitute women
for men in nearly all rural industries,. but the opinion
will not be shared, by the people of the West. The
soil of New England is so barren that it cannot sup
port a family living up to the normal American stand
ard, and so it passes to the foreigner immigrant who
sets his wife and daughters to work; but that kind of
soil doesn't prevail west of the Hudson. It will be a
long time before the United States as a whole is af
fected by economic conditions that now exist in New
England, and until that time comes the Western man
will continue to run the farm machinery from gang
plow to hay rake, while his wife, and daughters "sit
in the parlor, sew a fine seam and live upon straw
berries, sugar and cream."
Possessing little or no capital and largely ignorant
of the uses of farm machinery, the incoming peasants
from Europe are working the lands of their New
England homes in the way to which they were accus
tomed in the Old World, and as a result the "hired
man," once so familiar in the country, is being
crowded out by women workers in the fields. In
most cases the women who work the fields are mem
bers of the family owning or at least occupying the
land, but it is not always so. It has been found that
the employment of women in the fields is in many
cases more economical than that of men, and they
are being substituted extensively in truck farms
around Boston.
Commenting upon the change the Boston- Globe
says: "It will mean a new race of farmers in New
England. It will mean a regeneration of the deserted
farm, but it will also mean a new social element in
New England life that sooner or later will make itself
felt and heard in the councils of State and nation. In
the long run wealth inheres in the soil. The Ameri
can boy may go to the city, dress well and apparently
help form a qertain social upper crust, but the for
eigner who puts his whole family, into the field, man,
woman and child, is slowly amassing the wealth. If
his children seem rude now they will be polished later.
Ignorance is not natural to any race."
OF late we have heard comparatively little of the
once loud complaining over the abandoned
farms of New England. It appears* the farms
are being once morq, occupied and cultivated and
there is no longer any fear that the rural districts will
revert to the wilderness. Now, however, there comes
a new complaint. The incoming occupants of the
farms arc not of the old type of farmers. Some are
rich people of the cities, who use the land for summer
homes or for game parks, while others are foreigners,
who are cultivating them by methods quite different
from anything to which New England has been accus
tomed.
WOMEN AS FARM HANDS.
When the high school boys of Haywards were re
fused a holiday a few days ago they thereupon threw
down their books, expressed defiance and walked out
of their classrooms. They seem now particularly well
situated to learn what is known in economic litera
ture as a lockout, a very different process from a
walkout.
THE original cause of the strike by telephone
linemen is entirely lost sight of in the crimes of
violence against person and property to which
some of the strikers have resorted. When they quit
their job they stood upon American rights. It is the
right of any man not to work. Bujt it is equally the
Tight of any man to work in any lawful occupation.
The law protects men in the right to quit work and
it should equally protect men who want to work.
What would be thought of a proposition to legally,
or by illegal force and violence, compel any free man
to work against his will? The common sense of
mankind would at once see it truly as tyranny, base
and intolerable. So the common sense of honest
mankind fees in the prevention of labor by union
strikers the basest of tyranny, made all the more intol-,
crable by the cowardly crimes by which it is enforced.
The striking linerr.en, by their mob attacks on hon
crit men who want to work, have compelled the spec
tacle, humiliating to an American, of workmen com
pelled to have constant police protection to keep
from being murdered. Nothing can inflict greater in
jury upon our country than this. It means that we
have among us an organized class of men who have
no regard for the rights of others and none whatever
for their own character as American citizens.
That they are defiant of the rights of the com
munity is proved by their criminal cutting of tele
phone wires and cables. That crime is a blow at the
community, aimed at its life. It is the crime of de
j-picable sneaks, committed covertly, in the dark, at
hours when it imperils the life of people in no way
parties to the issue raised between these criminals and
iheir late employer. It imposes inconvenience and
inflicts loss that are not felt by the telephone com
pany. The public has borne it in grim silence and has
Detrayed no impatience with the telephone company.
But the criminals who aim this blow at their late
employer must understand that their crimes have
alienated public sympathy from them, and every
decent citizen would gladlv- aid in inflicting upon them
punishment thst would fit their crime.
It is well for petty magistrates, who perjure them
selves and violate the law by favoring these enemies
of mankind who are brought before them red-handed,
to reflect that they will not be forgotten at the polls
by decent citizens, whose rights they fail to protect,
in order to curry favor with oath-bound criminals.

Special Information, supplied daily to

Press Clipping Bureau (Allen's), 230 Cali

A STATEMENT is published that bears upon
the arguments made in favor of making all
taxpayers furnish capital to invest in the
Geary-street Railroad. As the figures are traceable
to the public reports, that should be in the hands of
the Boar.d of Works, their verification is easy. The
statement quotes the report of the City Engineer on
the estimated earnings of the proposed street rail
road as follows:
Operating expenses $148,000
Maintenance of plant 30.000
Interest account 24.8SO
Sinking fund 17,750
Total $220,550
Estimated earnings \..... 200,000
Annual loS3 $20,550
This, however, is not the total loss which will fall
on the taxpayers if the bonds are made a lien on the
city. The road owned by a private corporation
would pay tax, royalty and license as follows annually:
Taxes $10,000
License 450
Royalty 8,400
Total $18,850
This added to the loss between receipts and expendi
tures makes an apparent annual loss of $39,400.
This official showing detracts somewhat from the
rosy tinting given to the proposition by its support
1 crs and puts them in the attitude of trying to induce
j the taxpayers to contribute capital for a non-paying
investment. If the official figures be correct and a
net loss be in prospect it is in every view wrong to
extort the capital for such an investment from all the
taxpayers of the .city. If, on the other hand, the
claim that the business will yield great iyofit be true
the enterprise can raise its own capital and should
carry its own bonds. So in the one case making the
bonds a lien on the city is an outrage upon the tax
payers and in the other it is unnecessary.
The Australian colonies are verging on bankruptcy,
caused in great part by building railroads bonded
upon all the taxpayers instead of upon the plants
themselves. Those colonies have populations ex
ceeding a million people in each. But the insidious
system proposed here has grown into a burden
greater than they can bear.
The people of San Francisco should insist that
such a mistake be not made here. It is useless to
say that if the bonds are a lien on the road alone no
one will buy them. That will simply show the enmity
of wicked and predatory capital. Mr. William Ran
dolph Hearst will buy them with his benevolent and
philanthropic millions, devoted so freely to the shep
herding of the human race. But if he will not buy
them, based on the road alone, why not? He has a
newspaper here in which to answer the question.
LADIES* CARDS-J. A. L-. Citv. A
lady's card should have the prefix Mrs.
or Miss. The eldest unmarried daughter
of a family should have her card read
simply, if her name i3 Mary Black. "Miss
Black." not "Miss Mary Black." .The
younger sisters if unmarried Bhould havo
the Christian name on the card. If there
are two unmarried ladies in a house, one
belnp the sister of the husband and tho
other his daughter, the sister does not
come in Â«.-- e class given above, but shÂ»
should have her vlsitinc cards written
according to her condition In society.
How they should be written would de
pend if there are other sisters or if she
is classed arnons the old mald3. Thft
daughter should write on her cards her
family name with the prefix Miss. It
might happen that both would, under
the rules of etiquette, be entitled to use
the prefix instead of the Christian name.
The fact that they reside in the sam*
house and bear the same family name
does not make the sister a member of her
brother's immediate family, and if ghÂ»
be the eldest daughter of thÂ» family of
which her brother is a direct member
she shouloT use, her visiting cards with
the prefix Miss, just the same as the eld
est daughter of her brotuer.

Baehr stated that he would sign the
demand of L. J. Welsh as concrete in
spector ast soon as the Board of Educa
tion drew it on the proper fund.
Superintendent of Schools Langdon and
School Director Woodward made a visit
of inspection yesterday to the Everett,
Fremont, Pacific Heights and Sherman
schools, and as a result the Board of
Education has decided that no addi
tional classes will be formed in the
schools named. It was reported to the
board that the classes were, rather over
crowded, but the Everett School was the
only one in which such was found to be
the case. Some of the classes had five
pupils and others three in excess of the
regular number and It was not deemed
advisable to form a new class, as it would
be difficult to classify pupils of so many
different grades.
In the other schools it was found that a
number of pupils on the waiting list
could not be accommodated at the pres
ent time and some arrangement will be
made whereby they will be able to attend
other schools in the vicinity.
Auditor Baehr yesterday refused to
audit demands on the school fund, aggre
gating some $1700. and passed by the
Board of Educatiin, on the ground that
the amount named would be an. overdraft
on the fund under the one-twelfth provi
sion of the charter. Baehr decided to
withhold payment of the demands until,
after all the teachers and laborers in the
School Department had been paid and he
ordered the demands to be sent back to
the Board of Education without his ap
proval. The latter body sent the demands
back to Baehr with a request that he give
his reasons in writing for refusing to
affix his signature thereto. The required
information will be forthcoming from
Baehr to-day.
JACKSONVILLE, Or.. Sept. 11.â The
Gold Hill dam across the Rogue River,
built to conserve the water for power
purposes, has revealed a bar of placer
gold In the bed of the stream whiclfcÂ»is
believed to contain $250,000. Alexander
Orrae, foreman of dam construction, was
discoverer of the gold-bearing gravel.
He panned out $100 In two and a half
hours, but as soon as the fact that gold
existed in the bar became known the
Condon Power Company, to whom the
dam belongs, refused to allow further
mining operations. Extensive prepara
tions are being made to work the prop
erty. The dam, which holds back the
waters of Rogue River at this point,
caused the formation of a gravel bar. and
It is in this that the placer gold has be<Â»n
found. It evidently came down the river
and lodged within easy reach of those
who have spent thousands of dollars In
perfecting the dam in order that electri
cal power might be supplied to the sur
rounding country.
The bed of Rogue River adjacent to the
dam is being thoroughly prospected, and
other large gold deposits are expected to
be found.

It is hardly necessary to go over all the defects,
diizdvantages, annoyances and irritations that are in
herent in any system of customs inspection 2000 mile3
from the port passengers desire to enter. One might
a* well establish the customs inspection for the Atlan
tic Coast, not at Boston, New York or Philadelphia,
bfÂ«i in Ireland. The fact that Honolulu is politically
a 1 art of the United States does not affect the com
merc.sl remoteness of the port from this city, not
does it overcome the natural effects of time and dis
tance. Inspection at that point is too far away to
serve any good purpose, and as a result it is chiefly
notable for its annoyances and for the number of pro
tests that have been sent to Washington against a
continuance of it.
A part of the work of investigation will be that of
inquiring into the needs of California in the way of
better provision for the safety of shipping. Upon
such matters it is hardly likely there will be any con
flict of testimony or difference of opinion among
those whom the visiting officials may question. It is
well known there is an urgent need for an improved
system of lightships, beacons, Ulioys, fog signals, etc.,
along the coast, and the investigators will readily find
ample evidence to sustain all that the city and the
State have asked for in that respect.
The issue with which the visit of the officials is
chiefly concerned is that involved in the claim of the
Collector of the Port of Honolulu to examine and
inspect at that port the baggage and personal effects
of all passengers who arrive there on their way to
San Francisco. The claim has doubtless some rea
sons to justify it, and yet it is certain that however
good such reasons may be they are more than offset
by those which are advanced by the objectors. Hono
lulu is about 2000 miles distant from San Francisco
and it is self evident that a customs inspection of bag
gage at that point cannot be made effective to pre
vent smuggling here, while it can and invariably does
cause an immense amount of annoyance to passen
gers.
The inefficiency of inspection at Honolulu for the
purpose of preventing smuggling at San Francisco
will be apparent to any one who reflects upon the
problem. As the would-be smuggler does not intend
to leave the ship at Honolulu he can remove the
dutiable articles from his baggage, secrete them about
his bed or some other place on the ship and then
pass his baggage up for inspection with impunity.
As soon as the inspection is over he can replace the
dutiable articles and come to this port serene in the
assurance that he has his certificate of inspection and
his permit to Jand and so can come ashore without
further 'rouble.
Inspection at Honolulu is therefore advantageous
to the would-be smuggler at San Francisco, but it is
a great annoyance to honest passengers. In the first
place while the ship waits at Honolulu most passen
gers would like to be free to see the city and some of
the fights of the island, but if they are detained on
shipboard to have their baggage inspected they are
deprived of that pleasure. That, however, is by no
means the end of their trouble, for when the inspec
tion hss been made the Honolulu officers place cus
| tome, seals on the trunks and boxes they have in
! spected and thus passengers are compelled to make
the voyage of 2000 miles without access to their bag
gage. Under any circumstances such restrictions
would be a nuisance, but when it is remembered that
the voyage from Honolulu to San Francisco is a jour
ney from the warmth of the tropics to one of the
coolest and breeziest points of the temperate zone it
will be seen that to exclude passengers from an op
portunity to change their clothing before arrival here
is tc subject them to risks of a serious injury to
health.
â¢-> ONSIDERABLE gratification will be felt in
I this city over the arrival of Robert B. Arm-
strong, First Assistant Secretary of the Treas
ury, and N. N. Stranahan, Collector of the Port of
New York, for the purpose of investigating at this
port a number of matters of which^here has been a
great deal of well founded complaint. t

plish the distance to the pole and return in about ioo
days or a little more, an average travel of about ten
miles a day. Returning, I should break the ship out
late in the season and return home. If ice conditions
the first year were such as to prevent reaching the
northern shore of Grant Land I should winter as far
north as practicable and force the ship to the desired
location the following year. In this event the expedi
tion would be gone two years."
The expedition, while it involves danger and hard
ship, is by no means such a perilous undertaking as
Arctic voyaging was in the days of Sir John Franklin
and his immediate successors. Experience has taught
how to avoid many of the difficulties that beset early
explorers and science and invention have devised and
constructed many appliances that lessen the work of
exploration. The new enterprise therefore has a rea
sonable basis for the hopes of those who undertake
it, and it may be we shall have the satisfaction of in
cluding among the triumphs or our republic that of
the discovery of the pole for which so many heroes
have sought in vain.

The punishment was imposed by Cap
tains O. F. Bolles and John K. Bulger,
United States Local Inspectors* of Steam
Vessels. It appeared that when they
were making their inspection of Jhe San
Pedro they found the fastenings of the
life boats in bad order, and when they
called for an inspection of the logbook in
order to learn whether the crew had been
drilled in unslinging and sending out the

February.
For neglecting these duties the statutes

John Schamberger, 545 Folsom street,
corroborated Eads. R. Carr, who at the
time of the shooting: lived at 532 Folsom
street, testified that he heard shooting
and when ho went outside Sample was
being taken away in the car. He picked
up a pair of brass knuckles from the side
walk close to two spots of blood and gave
them to a sergeant he met a few minutes
later. The brass knuckles were produced
and admitted for the purpose of identifi
cation. .
J. L.. Eads, 547_Folsom street, testified
that he heard a noise on the opposite Bide
of the street and looking out of his win
dow.whlch was open, he saw a man lying
on the sidewalk and two men about two
feet from him. Then he heard two shots
and the two men, who were standing, ran
in the direction of Second street. Just
as they started to run he heard a noise as
Jf something had been thrown against the
fence. In a few minutes Policemen Nob
mann and Clark returned from the direc
tion of Second street with two men. The
car came along and the man who lay on
the sidewalk was lifted up and placed on
the car. He was satisfied there were no
other men present at the time the shots
were fired except the man lying on the
sidewalk and the two men standing with
in two feet of him.
Martin Kelly, politician, testified that hft
was standing on the corner of Fremont and
Folsom streets waiting for the last car to
take him to the ferry and he told Sample
that there was some disturbance at First
and Folsom streets. Sample went in that
direction with his club in his hand.

Upon her return to the Orient the Japanese
liner Hongkong Maru will be given an official
trial trip. Under the Japanese law through
which the Hongkong Maru and her sisters, the
America and Nippon, are subsidized as mall
carriers, a trial test of the liners Ik made every
five years. At this trial the specifications un
der which the boats were built and by virtue
of which they carry the Japanese malls, are the
Ftandards by which they will be Judged and re
tained or discarded as mail boat.", according to
their performance. The trials take place at
Hongkong. In addition to paFsin* a rigorous
general survey, Hongkong Maru will be sent
nix times at full speed over a three-mile course
and by the mean result wljl her fleetness be
estimated. Theee three boats have been well
kept up and, in the opinion of experts, are bet
ter to-day than when they left the stocks. They
are first favorites with transpacific travelers
and the officials of the company have no fear
of their ability to even better the record made
at their original trial?. In addition to passing
the Japanese Government survey the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha liners are every year passed upon
and rated by the United States inspectors and
Lloyds' surveyors.

will be removed to prevent injury to the
hounds. The running will be diagonally
across the field. The soil is â¢ light and
sandy and cannot bake hard.
The managers of the meet expect a big
success. The dogs will be kenneled in the
racing stables at the track. The level
pastures near the cityy will afford good
training grounds for the dogs being pre
pared for the meeting.
It Is not a violent sport, and is espe
cially adapted to men who are no longer
youths. It Is played In the open air and
pleasant surroundings, and requires con
siderable skill. The rinks are situated
near the tennis courts, and are well at
tended, especially late in the afternoons.
The game was formally introduced In
Oakland on Admission day, and the
matches were witnessed by a large num
ber of interested spectators. The open-
Ing day was given over to an lnterclub
match between the San Francisco and
newly organized Oakland club. Although
the former won by quite a margin, the
Oakland players showed up exceptionally
well for their first tournament play. The
club has a good start, and. like the San
Francisco club, will soon have a large
membership list.
1 The tournament which has been In
progress for several weeks on the Golden
Gate Park rinks must be finished No
vember 14. Sixty-four players entered,
and as the first round, must be completed
to-day many matches will be played. At
the end of the day's play there will be
thirty-two men left to compete In the
second round.
The eleven matches which must be com
pleted this afternoon are as follows:

' Scottish bowline, like the other games
played in Golden Gate Park, is becoming
Immensely popular. The San ~ Francisco
club has a membership considerably over

year ago, and at first did not thrive. As
the on-lookers became better acquainted
with It the merits of the game soon be
came erident.

SCOTTISH BOWLING GAINS

Martin Glendon and Jesse Stovall went
to Cleveland and each looked like a star
at the pitching game there. Then Grant
Thatcher, whom -Charley Rellly had on
his staff, won his game for Brooklyn
cleverly and Manager Hanlon seemed to
like his style. Johnny Burns has not
been heard from since he signed with
the Detroit team., but he should make
good beyond the question of a doubt. On
the whole the talent from the Pacific
Coast has been going a few In the bis
leagues.
Thompson and Carrisch.the Helena bat
tery, were given a chance with the
mighty Pittsburg champions and they
made such a good showing that the pa
pers of that city raved over the young
sters. Then Pflester of the ill-fated San
Francisco team also pitched some good
ball for the great team. ...
When thft Seattle and Portland teams
took that brace a few weeks ago and
raised themselves about '100 per cent in
the standing the fans all thought the
Cripples were about due to remain at the
bottom of the heap. But what a change
has been wrought lately. Peter's Oak
land collection is right in the going and
is playing better ball at present than any
any other team save the Angels.
â¢ They have left the last place for the
time being at least. . They have done this
by playing the game In good form. Tho
team is by no means composed of an ag
gregation of stars, yet every man on the
lineup at the present time seems in the
game to win. The harmony that has
been so long lacking has at last made
its appearance and is making itself felt.
The < present. season has-been a wonder
for the development of .youngsters in the
two. big leagues. "Kids" from every part
of the country have made good in the
fast organizations. Take the California
players, for instance. Since the Pacific
National League went under a bunch of
men from that league have cast their
lots with the major organizations and
strange to say, they have all played bril
liantly. â¢
IT Is not the race for first place, but
the struggle to keep from doing the
honors as the PaclflV Coast Baseball
League's target bearers, that is the in
teresting one now to the fans. The men
who know the game and who have been
following it closely concede the pennant
to the Los Angeles team. But what nine
is going to cofne irt last? That is the
question at prdsent, and it Is a difficult
one to answer J considering the way the
talent is playing.
A. E. Bell, the new champion, has been
one of the leading players of the coast
for years and his victory was a well earn
ed one. He met and defeated all of the
best men in the tournament and in the
challenge match won without, the loss of
a set. Bell had two close calls, one in the
semi-final round and the other in the
final. In both matches his perfect condi
tion pulled him \hrough. The match be
tween Bell and Smith was the only one
in the tournament that required the full
five sets to settle the question of su
premacy. The "run in" game played by
both was exhausting and told more heav
ily on Smith. The latter's service was
effective while his strength lasted. Beil
serves a fast bail with a high bounce.
It is a hard ball to drive, but easy to
chop.
In the championship'match Freeman did
not play near the game he put up a year
ago. His overhead work was as effective
as ever, but in his other strokes he has
fallen off considerably. The ex-champion,
like George Whitney, has heart trouble,
caused by overexertlon and it Is doubtful
if he will ever compete in a champion
ship tournament again.
At the net Bell is undoubtedly the best
man on the coast, but in the back court
he Is wofully weak. His best stroke Is
his *mash. Bell's greatest weakness at
the het is his handling of low volleys.
In his match with Bell Murdock smashed
almost as well as his opponent. This has
always been the Alamedan's weakness
and consequently his clever work was a
surprise. Of the three players Smith Is
probably the strongest volleyer, but is
weaker in overhead work. The poor back
court work of most of the cracks, is at
tributable to an extent to the excessfve
heat. The heat caused the balls to be
come soMlvely as to make.it difficult to
execute a good ground stroke. Men like
MacGavin and Murdock found it hard
to drive because the ball became light
and instead of dropping sailed through
the air. .
THE annual coast championship
tennis tournament at San Rafael
was one of the most successful
ever held here. For the second time the
southern players swept all before them.
Last year all of the championships went
south and again this year the north has
been whitewashed. However, the local
players made a much better showing this
year than they did last and showed that
they are by no means outclassed by the
men lrom below.

The members of the San Rafael Golf
Club were on the links a great deal during
the holidays. In the ladies' putting con
test each holed out five balls from
the edge of three greens, making fifteen
balls in all. Mrs. A. A. Curtis and Mrs.
R. J. Davis tied for first place, with a
net score of 27. The scores were as fol
lows: Mrs. A. A. Curtfs, 29 less 12â27;

To-night the members of tho San Fran
cisco Yacht Club ylll give a dance in
their quarters at Sausalito and to-mor
row several parties will be taken out for
a da>'Â» cruise.
The sloops Queen, Nellie and Surprise
also left Sausalito on Saturday, proceed
ing through San Pablo and Suisun bays
to New York Slough: thence through the
San Joaquin River into the Mokelumne
River; thence through Georglana Slough
into the Old Sacramento River, and so
â¢lown to Valiejo and home. The sloop
Halcyon went up the Sacramento River
and came out by way of Georgiana
Sloujrh. The sloop Queen had on board
Dr. T. L. Hill, R. M. Welch. H. Gingg.
H. C. Toll and Allen Hayes. The weather
was so calm .during the day that most of
the sailing was done at night, there be
ing a bright moon. Many of the trees
on the banks of Georgiana Slough have
been cut down and the yachtsmen en
joyed a free wind through the slough.
The gloop Curlew, with J. M. Punnett
and G. T. S. White on board, was also
out on a holiday cruise. Valiejo was
reached by the yachtsmen . on .Tuesday
ard Sausalito on Wednesday evening.
In the SO-foot class Frank Stone's sloop
Presto was missed, ehÂ© having been un
able to get out of Tiburon Cove. Her
owner and crew believed there would be
no race. "W. G. Morrow's sloop Challen
ger not only beat all the 30-footers, but
made actually better time over the course
than any of the 86-footers or than the
44-footers Speedwell and Mexico. Her
time for the fourteen-mile course was
less than two and a half hours. Nixie
made the second best time, 35 seconds
more than two and a half hours. Edna
beat her old rival Emma, both In elapsed
and correct time and won the second
flag In the SS-foot class. Harpoon captur-
Jng the Mafcdonough Cup and the first
flag of the association.
In the six classes twenty-three boats
were entered and of these eighteen com
pleted the course. The big sloop Annie
entered In the 55-foot class, but. as she
had no competitor, did not Bail round the
course-. The sloop Rover was cruising- in
the channel during the afternoon, but
did not reach the starting-line In time.
The 6Chooncrs Chispa and White "Wings
were on the course during the races.
Many yachtsmen who did not Intend to
enter the races availed themselves of the
holidays to take long cruises. Commo
dore R. S. Brldgman of the San Francisco
Yacht Club and party In the sloop Thetis,
accompanied by "W. "W. Haley and friends
in the sloop Ariel, left Sausallto on the
5th inst. Thetis reached Paradise Cove,
but Ariel dropped back to the Sausalito
tide station. On Sunday Ariel joined
Thetis and both yachts sailed up Peta
luma Creek and through the drawbridge
to LakeviHe, with a good breeze. On the
way up the sloop Tnelma and the Califor
nia flagship Idler were passed in a blind
:-=lough. At Lakeville the sloop Espy was
joined. After lying: at anchor for two
hours the yachts Ariel and Thetis
dropped down to the drawbridge, where
they moored for the night. Early on
Monday morning the yawl Idler passed
*i netls, which did not raise anchor till
3 :30 p. m. Sausalito was reached on Mon
day evening.
It was suggested that as Discovery and
Neva were the only entries In the 25
foot class and both are in trim for rac
ing, they be permitted to sail the course
for the Macdonough Cup in their class.
Many yachterr.cn. would be glad to see
the race.
Rollo Smith, judge on the windward
stakeboat, reported that the yawl Royal
fouled the sloop Alice, which swerved at
the leeward mark, â¢with her jigger. Also
ihat the sloop Aeolus fouled the main
*heet of the sloop Truant. No cups,
flags nor certificates were affected by the
fouls.
Of the five boats entered in the twenty
f"i>t special class for the Law cup four
went over the course, two being San
Francisco yachts and two Corinthian. It
was a disappointment to many of the
yachtsmen that Discovery and Neva did
not reach the starting line, for an inter
â¢ stins- struggle was expected between
â¢hem. In the yawl class E. C. Clark's
Gjrpsie was beaten for first place for tho
iirst time in several years, Robert Vin
t ent's new boat, Iola. the standard of the
class, beating her nearest rival by more
than ten minutes actual sailing time and
1 y more than four minutes corrected time.
'. ho committee believed it would be nec
< Bsary to postpone the annual regatta,
shortly after that time a little breeze
came and increased in force so rapidly
ihat at 2 o'clock It was blowing freshly.
ALTHOUGH up to 1:30 p. m. on Ad
mission day it seemed hopeless to
hold a yacht race on the bay and
This is the third of a series of tourna
ments. The last event was won by Y. C.

sizing up the work of the football
men and prophesying who will be mem
bers of the varsity or freshmen teams.
The climate has had its effect on the tem
pers and condition of the men, for It has
made them sullen and sluggish, and tha
two days' vacation was welcomed with
delight
But the weather must change some time
and the holidays cannot go on forever, 9<>
from this time on there will be "energetic
work done. The coaches have be^n send
ing their pupils along rather gently bo far
but the serious business is about to begin.
The plan of having the men line up and
run with tho ball and fall upon it has
been followed out to the letter since train
ing began. The tackling and rough worlc
has been left for next week when tha
men's muscles will have become hardened.
The varsity players have been lining up
in the following fashion: Left-end. Dp
meritt; left tackle. Howard: left guard.
Stow: center, Stroud: right guard. Over
all; right tackle. Forse; right end. Hud
son; quarter-back, Geary; left half. Ris
ley; full-back, Boynton; right half. "Whip
pie. Muther. Klttrell and "White havÂ«
been alternating with the half3 and Steam
with the full-back.
At present it seems these men will b*
the choice of Coaches Whipple and Hall
for this year's team. The men are all
veterans and do not seem to have any
competitors, though a "phenom" is likely
to develop any time. The changes are
most likely to occur through the decisions
of Mini. More and Heitmuller In regard to
their playing. These men made records*
last year and the college wants them to
get into the game again. It may be. they
may not be able to withstand the weight
of much importuning, in which case tho
team will be greatly strengthened.
The freshmen squad has been devotins
more attention to the ba.ll and field than
the varsity. There are fifty of them, all
anxious to get a place on the team, which
accounts for their faithful trainine. It
Is Impossible to pick a team from tho
crowd yet so the coaches have been giv
ing them all a chance to show what they
can do. There are a number of good
players among them but none with a rec
ord that makes him stand out above his
fellows. Mini has been helping Coaches
Whipple and Hall show the freshmen how
to play the game this week.
Manager Decoto has arranged with tha
Stanford representatives the dates for the
two big games and some of the prelim
inary games. The freshmen intercolle
giate game will be played on October 17
and the varsity intercollegiate game on
November 14 in San Francisco. The first
freshmen game will be played with either
the Berkeley High School or the Oakland
High School on Saturday, the 13th inst.
The varsity will play its first same some
time near the end of the month with tha
Reliance team that Is being organized
by "Pete" Smith. A game has been
scheduled for October 24 on the campus
against the Chemawa Indians of Oregon.

BERKELEY, Sept 11. â ThÂ© hot
weather and two holidays this
week destroyed all chances fop
The problem of developing good purhers
and place kickers is at present occupying
a great deal of the coaches' time. Left
Tackle Sprott '06 is being tried out as a
goal kicker and promises to be a worthy
successor to "Bill" Traeger. whom he
supplanted on the varsity eleven. He
seems to have little difficulty in placing
the ball between the posts from as far
back as the thirty-yard line. Should he
succeed in combining speed with, ac
curacy he may prove a successful rival
of Captain Overall of Berkeley. "Sav
age" Dole '03, varsity halfback, and three
candidates for the freshman teamâ E.
Dole, a brother of the varsity half; "Wel
ler, a point-winner in the intercollegiate
field day last spring; and Sprott, a prom
ising quarterback from Portlandâ are
given a chance to punt every afternoon
and all are showing up well.
Treasurer Cowden of the Associated
Students has completed negotiations for a
game with the Chentawa Indian team
from Oregon. The Indians are said to
have a fast and clever eleven, so the con
test should be one of unusual Interest.
The date selected for the game is October
28. They will meet California the pre
vious Saturday.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 11.
Several of the warmest days of the
year have been numbered in the
week just closing and as a result pro
gress on the football field has been nec
essarily slow. The men have been put
through light work at punting and run
ning down on kicks, with some slightly
heavier work during the last two days.
Thursday afternoon the players lined up
for the first time this season.
The men have been divided up into two
squads, one under Coach Lanagan and
the other under Assistant Coach Slaker.
These two squads have in turn been sub
divided into sections A and B and will be
pitted against each other in daily â¢ scrim
mages. Signals were given out "Wednes
day afternoon and signal practice formed
a part of the afternoon's work. With
their first preliminary game but a week
away the varsity candidates have a hard
week's work ahead of them in order to
get in condition to make a creditable
showing.
The first game scheduled for the varsity
will occur on the 19th inst.. when it will
meet the Reliance Club eleven on the
campus gridiron. The outcome of that
game is purely a matter of conjecture, for
nothing is known of the comparative
strength of the two teams. Four line po
sitions and one back position have been
left vacant in the cardinal team as it ap
peared last year. "While all of the va
cancies will be hard to fill with men as
good as those who played last fall, the
greatest loss is that of Fullback McGH
vray. He was nearly always good for his
distance on a line buck and was easily
the best punter on the team.

SYRACUSE. N. Y.. Sept. 11.â With
turf conditions which were estimat
ed to make the course a good half
second slower than on Wednesday, when
he established a new world's trotting
record for geldings, 2:01%, Major Delmar
went a mile on the State Fair Grounds
track at 5 o'clock this" afternoon in
2:00Â»i. lowering 1 his previous record one
and a quarter seconds.
This remarkable exhibition of speed
was made In the presence of 15,000 per
sons, who cheered enthusiastically when
the result was announced, and it was
realized that Lou Dillon, the two-minute
trotter, alone stood between Major Del
mar and the world's trotting record, and
that by only a quarter of a second.
The early actions of Major Delmar did
not promise the splendid achievement
which was to follow. Twice McDonald
nodded his head as he drove Delmar
down the stretch, accompanied by a run
ner, and twice did the gelding break, first
at the eighth and then -at the quarter
pole, and waa returned for another start.
A pair of shadow goggles were removed
from Delmar's eyee, as It was thought
they had a tendency to make him rest
less, and McDonald again announced His
readiness for another trial.
This time there was no fluke. With the
regularity of clockwork Delmar settled
down to his work and interest In the
grand stand became Intense. The quarter
wa^ reached in :31Vi, the same time made
by Delmar in Wednesday's trial. Soon
after paESing the quarter pole the gelding
faltered slightly, but soon recovered him
self and reached the half In 1:01. having
gained three-quarters of a second over
his time on Wednesday. At the half Del
mar and his running mate were Joined by
a second runner and the real contest be
gan. Side by side flew the three horses.
Glances at watches showed that the third
quarter had been done in :29M and a
mighty cheer went up. Coming into the
stretch McDonald gave Delmar a light
touch with the whip and the gelding In
response made a magnificent spurt which
brought him under the wire In 2:00Â»i.

the first turn there was considerable
bumplnsr. In which Orfeo got all the worst
of it. being knocked back to the last
place. Then Wilson drove Corrlgan'a
gelding up and he reached the leaders in
next quarter of a mile. The early use to
which Orfeo had been put told when the
final effort came and he faltered, allow
ing Ancke to win unextended, with two
length to spare. The track was deep and
holding and the weather cloudy, sultry
and threatening. On account of the ordi
nary card the attendance was only fair,
although the racing was spirited and the
betting heavy. The talent failed to get
as good a break to-day as tney did yes
terday, not a favorite winning Sum

By the time the last race was called the
wind which had been blowing, died out
considerably and the water was smoother.
At the start, which was also accomplished
from the six furlong pole, Hiraebrand. on
Marena, caught the water first. Coxswain
Frawley though, on the favorite El Piloto,
displayed a complete knowledge, of the
course, steering in first by two or three
open boat lengths. In his wake came
Judge Voorhees, then Maresa.
J. W. Brooks, manager of the coming
Los Angeles race meeting, was a visitor
at the track to-day.
Frawley, on Tamm, backed from even
money to 3 to 5 favoritism to take the
first six furlong affair, delayed too long
en route and met with defeat. Chandler,
on Madame Bishop, a 4 to 1 chance,
sneaked away in the lea'd and lasted long
en route and met with defeat. Chandler,
the odds on favorite. The show went to
Loyal S.
There were seven starters In the fourth
number, another five furlong sprint.
Frawley, on Miss Divldend.a SVi to 1 shot,
jumped away in the lead at the start and
was never headed. At her heels finished
Mannle, a 10 to 1 outsider, and Cuidada, the
third choice. Doris and Dusty Rhodes
were nuoted at 8 to 5. Doris was
bumped at the start.
There was only one purse race on the
programme, aryl that had but three start
ers. Meehanus which was brought to
this State a fortnight ago with the Elra
wood Farm horses, was Installed a 4 to
5 favorite. He won by a neck in 1:40%
after an extended drive with David S.
Anvil never looked dangerous. Jackson,
on the winner, rode a clever race after
breaking a stirrup on the back stretch.
For the opening five furlong dash four
2-year-olds that had not won two races
went to the barrier. Charlie Schvroit
zer was held at 7 to 5. Pat Bulger 3 tr>

named fllly with little Lewis up got cut
oft* early- in the game, but came through
in the stretch, winning handily from Pat
Bulger and Schweitzer.
A five furlong spin for maidens followed
with the 2-year-old Czarette. ridden by
Hildebrand, an even money favorite. Hil
debrand got his mount away first to a
straggling start and won all the way. St.

SUCH an exhibition as was handed
out at Recreation Park yesterday
would not do In the lynchers'
league, or In any other bush organiza
tion In the baseball world. The talent
from Seattle were about at its worst, so
any one who was fortunate enough to be
absent can easily imagine how the game
was. Score: Oakland, 6; Seattle. 1.
The aUraction for the day was Mr.
Blewett, late of Tacoma, also New York
and Brooklyn and possibly some other
place. If he gave the best he had yester
day he deserrefl to be chased. He could
not throw a curve nor a swift ball. He
had no control In that left wing of his
end he fielded h!s position like same old
woman trying to break into the game.
Why the Cripples did not make a mil
lion runs is not known. Perhaps they can
tell, but at any rate they seemed content
with six. They made these In numerous
ways. Some by hitting:, others on errors
and come by stealing away from first to
the plate without any of the opposing
players Interfering with-thcir efforts.
The day was a terror. It was hot and
fultry and a haze hung over the diamond.
It was nearly impossible to see the out
fielders when they went after a ball.
There was no ginger nor life in the con
test and the fans were forced to leave the
place before the game was half finished.
They could not stand It longer-.
The Cripples played a good game. They
hit well and fielded perfectly until the
ninth inning, when Willie O'Hara let a
drive from the bat of Mohler pass
through him. Then Smith tore off a
three-cushioner and the little man came
In with the only run for Seattle. The
score:

SHEEPSHEAD BAY. S^pt. 11.â
Realizing the near approaching
close of the season at the Coney
Island Jockey Club race course, the at
tendance to-day was very lÂ£-rge. Two
stakes adorned the programme, one for
two-year-olds and the other for three
year-olds and upward. TIip last named
v.-as the Russc'.l handlcal at one and a
naif miles. There were but four start
era, yet one of the four was badly inter
fered with, and, while Caughnawaga won
for John Sanford, the victory was not as
clean cut as admirers of the stable
would have preferred. Burns had the
mount on Caushnawaga and his success
was coincident with the announcement
made during the day that his relation as
jockey for W. C. Whitney would cease
to-morrow and that hereafter he will ride
for Mr. Sanford.

PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 11.â The com
mittee of nine appointed from the Elks
of this city to investigate the cause of
the wreck of the Elks' excursion .train on
the Northern Pacific Railroad, near Che
halls, August 22, submitted its report to
day. The report says that the engine
pulling the excursion train was not a
first-class engine; that the engineer and
fireman were both extra men, neither of
them ever before having run the engine,
and that the cause of the accident was
low water In the boiler. The officials in
charge of the Northern Pacific Railroad
the day of the disaster are severely con
demned. The report closes by expressing
"regret that Brother A. D. Charlton.
assistant general passenger agent of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, was not in the
city the day <Jf the acccldent. We are
convinced that had he been In Portland or
anywhere upon the main line of the road
conditions after the accident would have
been different and much suffering and
anguish of mind would have been saved
to all concerned."

PORTLAND, 'Or., Sept. ll.-Edward Or
pin has confessed to Chief of Police Hunt
that since last April he has committed
hig-hway robbery seven times and has set
fire to at least as many buildings. His
action In setting fire to different buildings
has been the result of drunken revels, so
he says. He had no other motive than a
drunken desire to see the buildings burn.
Dissatisfaction over the amount of
booty secured from F. C. Fletcher, one of
his victims, led to his arrest. He got but
a dime from Fletcher, and several days
later was heard declaiming bitterly
against men who walk the streets with
no larger sums than 10 cents In their

CHARGES AGAINST COUNTY
ASSESSOR ARE WITHDRAWN
Controversy Over Collection of Per
sonal Property Taxes in San
Diego Is Amicably Settled.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 11.â The controversy
existing between the District Attorney
and County Assessor Rush, as the result
of the charge that the latter had de
frauded the county out of $3702 35 in the
collection of personal property taxes, was
ended to-day by a resolution of the Board
of Supervisors accepting a payment by
the Assessor of $500 in full of any and all
demands growing out of the matters
charged or which might arise therefrom.
The Assessor, in the settlement, agrees
that he will not collect such taxes when
there Is, In his opinion, sufficient real
estate owned by such persons to secure
the payment of the personal tax. .
The bone of contention was the Asses
sor's right to make such collections,
rather thari to permit them to be pro
posed and made by the Tax Collector,
thus involving escape from school taxes.
All charges in the complaint of improper
motives are withdrawn and the action Is
dismissed.

Fire yesterday afternoon destroyed the
San Bruno House at San Bruno, entailing
a loss of about $5000 on the building and
contents. The blaze was discovered short
ly after 4 o'clock on the roof of the build
in?, but owing to the lack of water fa
cilities and the fact that the fire had
gained considerable headway, all at
tempts to chock the flames proved inef
fectual and the structure and outhouses
were burned to the ground.
Passengers on the electric car which
left San Mateo at 4 o'clock noticed the
lire on the roof as the car passed San
Bruno and at that time no one around the
place seemed to be cognizant of the fact.
Owing to the speed of the car passing
the station there was no chance to give
the alarm. Some time afterward the dis
covery was made that the roof was in
flames, but it was then too late to save
anything of value, as the fire ppread with
great rapidity. The barn and outhouses
wore also soon ablaze and in less than an
hour nothing remained but a pile of smok
ing ruins. Owing to the proximity of the
burning buildings to the railroad station
it was feared for a time that that struc
ture was also doomed to destruction.
The San Bruno Hcuse was owned and
conducted by Andy McSweeney as a road
house and was one of the most popular
resorts on the road to San Mateo.
Owing to Lack of Water, Popular
Resort and Outhouses Are
Totally Destroyed.

The taking of the testimony in the case
of Victor Walkirez. charged with the
murder of Elizabeth Leroy. was finished
this evening, and the arguments befora
the jury will begin in the morning. Tes
timony put on in rebuttal to-day by the
prosecution was strongly against the in
sanity theory of the defense. Drs. O. D.
Hamlin. J. W. Robinson and J. T. Kltch-
Ings. experts on insanity cases, have been
observing the accused since the begin
ning of hla trial and said that in their
opinion he was sane and, in answer to a
hypothetical question, stated that they
believed him to have been sane on May
4. the day the murder was committed.
Dr. Kitchlngs was asked by the defensa
how he arrived at his conclusions. This
opened the door for him to give his ob
servations and reasoning. He stated that
he had been observing the accused; that
when his companion, Anna Ross, was on
the stand he had particularly noticed
Walkirez. His actions and glances to-Â«'
ward his attorneys, at times contradict
ing her statements of events which oc
curred at a time when It is pleaded ha
was insane, the doctor stated convinced
him that the prisoner recollected the oc
currences of that night, and which the
doctor believed he would not have done
had he been acting under temporary ab
erration.
Dr. Kitchlngs' answer took even a
wider range, and he attacked the fact of
epilepsy, from which Walkirez Is said to
be suffering, and stated that the fita
Walkirez had might have been merely
paroxysms without Indicating insanity.
Prior to the doctors being put on the
stand the defense had put on Jailer Har
ry Clark and several prisoners who saw
several fits Walkirez had when first
placed In jail.

R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
There is much activity in all classes of
business. An encouraging symptom is the
decreased complaint regarding collections,
accompanied by more discounting of
bills. Weather conditions have been fa
vorable for retail trade, distribution of
merchandise expanding, while there are
frequent reports of larger jobbing fall
business than last year. Some caution in
selecting goods owing to high prices is re
ported at the West, but this is chiefly
confined to textiles. Labor disputes de
crease, all but one of the unions having
signed the agreement In the local build
ing trades and several other settlements
having been effected through concessions
on both sides. Railway earnings in Aug
ust were 9.1 per cent larger than last
year and 15.4 per cent greater than in
1901. Owing to the lateness of the crop
there is little complaint of traffic conges
tion.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say: Trade conditions are
still uneven, but the general drift is to
ward improvement. A more assured feel
ing as to the corn crop outturn is mani
fest, conditions in most States having
Improved since September 1. State fairs
and low rate excursions have stimulated
Western distribution, while good pros
pects for corn, cotton, rice and sugar in
the South have made things cheerful In
that section. The lumber market shows
oontrast In the different sections. In the
West lumber and building material of ail
kinds Is active and firm, but at the East
the resumption of building operations
about strike-Infested cities has not been
sufficient to keep the markets strong.
The iron trade is rather pessimistic,
buyers persisting in holding off, but the
declines in Northern and Western Jron re
ported this week are largely sympathetic,
the result of the reported additional -cuts
in the Southern product.
He suggested that perhaps the United
States would decide to police these isl

LONDON, Sept. 11.â With reference to
the representations made to Washington
by the British Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Ra
rikes, regarding the seizure of two or
three islands off the northeast coast of
British North Borneo by the United
States gunboat Quiros, a Foreign Offlco
official said to-day:
"The case seems quite simple. The
Amercians seized the islands, which they
claim were Spanish. We believe them to
be British. 'Protest' Is a very strong
word to use in connection with our com
ments upon the subject."
NEWPORT. R. L, Sept. 11.â The British
Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Raikes, when seen
here to-day, expressed the opinion that
the incident growing out of the Beizure of
the islands off the coast of British North
Borneo by the United States gunboat
Quiros was of minor importance and one
that would be amicably settled. He stated
that he was not in a position to divulge
the exact nature of the representations
made to the Washington Government, as
the affair was a matter of state.
As ho understood the question it con
cerned a couple of small islands off the
coast of Borneo which had been made a
resort by pirate*. For the protection of
its commerce. Great Britain had driven
off these robbers of the sea and then po
liced the islands against their reoccupa
tlon by the outlaws. Mr. Raikes could not
say that the islands were even inhabited,
and so far as he knew they were not
likely to be a source of profit to any one.
Before Spain had relinquished control of
her possessions in that quarter of the
world to the United States that country
had offered no objection to the occupation
of thete islands by Great Britain, and his
country had only done as she had to pro
tect her commerce.
WASHINGTON'. Sept. 11.â The appoint
ment of an American-British boundary
commission to determine the boundary
lines off the coast of Borneo separating
the possessions In those waters of the
Islands belonging to the two countries
may bo the eventual solution of the in
quiry which the British Government has
addressed to the State Department as to
the sovereignty over certain of these
islands.
The communication received from the
British Charge d' Affaires regarding the
control to be exercised over these Islands,
which have frequently been a resort for
pirates. Is still under consideration at the
State Department, and Acting Secretary
Adee will consult with the Secretary of
the Navy before replying. So far as can
be learned there is nothing In the con
troversy over these islands which will
call for arbitration. <
The injured men were removed to the
City and County Hospital, where It was
fourd that Rcssi had sustained a fracture
of the skull, a fracture of the right arm
and Internal Injuries. He has a fighting
chanoe for life. Rasso's Injuries consist
of a badly wrenched back and possibly
Internal injuries.
The engineer, Edwin Bunnell, was ar
rested and locked up at the City Prison.
It is said the gateman at the crossing
failed to drop the gate on the approach of
the locomotive.
A Southern Pacific freight engine col
lided with a vegetable wagon at the cross
ing of Mission street, between Twenty
third and Twenty-fourth streets, at 1:30
this morning. Antonio Rossi, the owner
ot the wagon, who was driving, was
probably fatally Injured; Vlttorlo Rasso,
his helper, was seriously Injured, one of
the horses was killed, and the wagon de
molished.
We have met here for the purpose of con
demning the action of four ot our five City
Trustees. One week ago I could not be Induced
to believe that four men elected by the peopln
of A lame la to serve them would submit to sum
bulldozing tactics as have been employed by
the Southern Pacific in the matter of the fran
chises. I am appalled and I feel that the citi
zens of this city have been humiliated by their
servants. But I tell you, gentlemen, that
there are men in this city who will not be bull
dozed: who will stand for their rights, and. if
needs be, who will fight for their rights.
Dr. W. H. Robinson, another speaker,
said:
We may not understand our City Trustees.
I don't see why they should give these valuable
franchises away. I did not believe that the
City Trustees would offer these privileges to
the Southern Pacific for nothing. Xo sensible
man believes that the company intends to tear
up any of its tracks here. Mr. Kruttschnltt is
no fool. He understands his business or he
would not be where he Is. . I do not think that
the injunction proceedings we have begun will
prove effective. I cannot satisfy myself that
the City Trustees will grant these franchises
for fifty years. Under the circumstances I feel
that it is more honorable to make a straight
stand-up American flght and get licked than to
lie down.
Other speakers were Jacob Hoeck, Ben
J. Smith and E. H. Lancel.
Resolutions denouncing the attitude of
the City Trustees with respect to the lo
cal referendum ordinance were introduced
by F. W. Voogt and unanimously passed.
They were as follows:
Resolved, That the Board of Trustees of
the city of Alameda Is directly responsible tor
continuing the ceaseless agitation on this sub
ject by refusing to grant the petition applied
for; and be It further
Resolved. That we, citizens of Alameda. In
mass meeting assembled, do hereby Indelibly
set our stamp of Intense disapproval and un
qualified condemnation ' upon Alameda's Board
of City Trustee*, and we unhesitatingly charge
that no self-respecting body of public men,
acting in the Interests of the whole people,
would dare to assume their present position
and effrontery: and be It further
Resolved. That this meeting Is more than
ever convinced of the crying and unavoidable
necessity of the referendum method of set
tling and disposing of this matter of public
interest; and be it further
Resolved, That none of the censure herein
contained is Intended for Joseph V. Forderer.
chairman of the City Trustees, he having con
sistently and persistently stood or the law
and the referendum at all times.
Henry Rosenthal, president of the Board
of Trade, was chairman of the meeting,
which was attended x>y about seventy
five citizens, comprising- members of the
Board of Trade, of the local Social Demo
cratic party and others. After calling the
assemblage to order the chairman Bald:
ALAMEDA, Sept. 11.â "Let us find out
the price of tar; let us find o'nt the price
of feathers; let us find out the price of
rope. Give these City Trustees the tar;
give them the feathers, and then, if they
do not come to time and save the city
from the Southern Pacific monopoly, give
them the rope."
Such was the course advised by C. 11.
Bassett In an impassioned address deliv
ered at a meeting of the Board of Trade
held to-night for the purpose of discuss
ing the matter of the two local railroad
franchises. Bassett's words were re
ceived with applause by many of those
present, but later In the meeting F. W.
Voogt said that he believed the remarks
were not temperate and were made in a
moment of excitement.

Local trading In Potatoes was fairly active,
but the export demand was very light, and as
stocks were heavy, the market ruled weak at
previous prices. Sweet Potatoes were plentiful
and in good request. Onions were easy, with
very few sales reported at the top quotation.

The Government report, giving the average

was considered mildly bullish at Chicago, where
the market advanced from 81%c to 82c, and
fell back to 81 Vic. The report decreased the
preceding estimate- by about 10.000,000 or 15,-
OOO.OOO bushels, and makes the total crop about
620.000,000 bushels. The export demand was
still disappointing, but the milling demand was
as urgent an ever. Minneapolis reported tha

running to cover and the weather in the North
west not favorable. .

weakness that developed in wheat also had
its influence and the close Â¦ showed December

Receipts of fruit, were liberal and Included
much poor stock, which had a depressing ef
fect on the *ale of superior, quality of offer-
Ings. Receipts of strictly fancy fruit, however,
were comparatively light and continued to com
mand good prices. Peaches were firm and sales
of choice freestones from the mountain dis
tricts were reported at Jl per box. Receipts
of carriers were very light and prices ranged
higher. The canners were purchasing freely
of clingstones In bulk at the previously quoted
rate. Common Apples and cooking Pears were
abundant and dull. Fine wrapped Bartletta
were steady and occasional lots of strictly
fancy commanded a small premium over the
quotations. Quinces and Pomegranates were
In falr f request, but supplies were ample and
quotations stood about the same. There were
heavy receipts of Figs In all kinds of pack
apes and prices were irregular. Prunes were
In free supply, but moved off well at steady
prices. The canners secured a small quantity
at the quoted rate, but most of the receipts
In bulk were disposed of to the regular trad<>.
There was an abundance of all varieties of
table Grapes and prices had little variation.
Wine Orapes were offering freely and met with
a fair demand. Melons were firm and active
owing to the continued warm weather, and
Watermelons were quoted higher, with the
market practically bare. Nutmeg Melons and
Cantaloupes were in light receipt and 'sold off
well at higher rates. There were liberal re
ceipts of berries, particularly Raspberries, and
the market was quiet, except for strictly fancy
offerings. Surplus stocks of all varieties went
to the canners at the minimum quotations.
Huckleberries were plentiful, but ruled steady.
There were no changes in Citrus or Trop
ical fruits, although Lemons moved freely ow
ing to the scarcity of Mexican Limes. Th*
steamer that arrived on the preceding day
brought up 392 cases which had not been mar
keted up to a late hour, owing tonne steamer

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET\
Both Butter and Eggs are higher this week.
Supplies of freeh Eggs in the wholesale mar
kets are light. There Is plenty of Butter
around the markets, but It Is mostly soft,
owing to the recent hot weather. Fine, cool,
hard stock Is rather scarce, hence the higher
prices. Cheese remains the same as quoted
last. week.
Meats and Poultry show no' noteworthy
changes. Game Is dearer. There Is plenty
coming In. but It spoils quickly in the hot
weather and cannot be sold. Most kinds of
Fish \ are plentiful. The open season for
Salmon closed on Thursday and there will be
none on the market until October 16.
Vegetables are abundant and prices show
very little change. Fruits too. continue plen
tiful, with prices reasonable.

J.Lt. Byrne, United States Vice Consul
at Valencia; Spain, has forwarded the
following report concerning Spanish rai
sins, under date of August 17:
The high temperatures and protracted
drought referred to in my last report as threat
ening the otherwise brilliant prospects for a
heavy raisin crop continued all through the lat
ter half of July and first days of August, seri
ously, reducing the total yield of grapes, which
is now estimated to fall short of 500,000 hun
dred-weights, or 25.000 tons, the fruit being
also slightly below the average In size. Open
ing prices are, therefore, exceptionally high.
62 pesetas (about $S 50) per 100 klloa (22O.4
pounds) being to-day's quotation, which gives
the following- average equivalent values In
United States currency:
Falling Off Officially Reported to Be
25,000 Tons.
VALENCIA BAISIN CROP.
Four hundred colonies of the scutellista
have been distributed by J. Thomas of
Monrovia. All persons coincide in the
statement that the black scale has met
his mortal foe. Among those bearing tes
timony are -Horticultural Commissioners
Jeffrey and Strong and Horticultural In
spector C. A. Day. The colonies of the
Bcuiellista are active and thriving at many
Southern California points, at Glendora,
Azusa, Riverside, Santa Ana, Escondldo
Valley, etc.
Alexander Craw, Deputy Horticultural
Commissioner of California, has submitted
an interesting report of the thriving of th a
South African Internal parasite, the scut
ellista-cyanea p which wag imported to
destroy the black scale, one of the most
formidable of all enemies of the olive, the
orange and the lemon. Mr. Craw writes
to Horticultural Commissioner EUwood
Cooper that the South African organism
with the hyphenated name is doing great
"work. The parasite is regularly estab
lished and doing the business it was im
ported for In Montecito. Santa Barbara
County, at Mr. Gillespie's place In Ven
tura County, in lxÂ»s Angeles County, in
the olive grove of W. E. Hughes, a few
miles southwest from the city of Los An
geles, and at other- places in Southern
California. . W, E. Hughes furnished this
testimonial for the scutellista:
Â¦ I am glad to be able to report that the scu
tellista has made its appearance generally
throughout my orchard, thus proving its ability
to winter successfully in Southern California.
I recrard this as a matter of great importance
to 'the fruit growers of the State, aa it setms
to number the days of the black scale pext.
There can be no doubt as to the ability cf the
scutellista to destroy the black hc:%IÂ« rapidly,
when once it has' been generally distributed
throughout the Infested districts. I desire to
acknowledge my indebtedness for the benefits
which I have derived.
The show will continue until next Mon
day night. Performances are given every
afternoon and evening. That the resi
dents of this city appreciate the excel
lence of the circus is evidenced by tha
tremendous crowds that nil the tent at
each performance.
It Is worth the price of admission to
see the daring John Rooney double somer
sault off one horse's back onto another.
The trained seals are almost human in
their feats. Gonaro and Theol do some
odd contortions and are heartily applaud
ed. Forty clowns keep the spectators in
a merry mood by their funny cupers.
Probably the most interesting thing in
the entire circus is the collection of an
imals. Zebras, rhinoceroses, monkeys,
gnus, leopards, lions, tigers and a score
of other animals gaze out of cages at tho
moving crowds. The most attractive caga
is that which contains the tigress and
her young. The mother guards her young
with jealous care and no one dares ga
near.
"Gee whir, dis Is der best s howl e vet
seed In me life," murmured the small boy
as he munched popcorn and gazed with
wide open eyes at RJngllngs' tnre,e-rlnseii
circus last night The little fellow tried
to watch three \rings at one time and
strained his eyes before half the lengthy
programme- was presented. His experi
ence was not unlike that of thousands of
others who crowded the .'immense . tent.
Every ring had Its quota of clever per
formers and the platforms and 'arena
were filled with funny . clowns and per
forming animals. For more ' than two
hours the spectators were amused by the
marvelous sights presented. The big tenc
echoed with laughter and applause, and
every one but the man who could not
get in was content. - ;V." .
RlngUngs' circus has many features.
In fact; It Is all features. There is nut
an uninteresting minute during the per
formance, and the spectator wonders
what is coming next. He does not have
to wonder long, as the ringmaster signals
with his whistle and in a moment the
arena Is filled with other performers. The
acts are short, but excellent.

in taxes." f
If the Board of Supervisors in declaring
the combined city and State rates on the
third Monday of September to comply
with the State law has the power to so
reduce the rate of $1,076 that only the ap
propriation in the budget will be collected
on the increased valuation then one val
uation could be used. This ia another
point for legal interpretation by the City
Attorney, that is, as to whether the rate
can be reduced so as not to compel .prop
erty owners to pay in $1,200,000 to the city
treasury which the city never intended
should be done.
Attorney Lane and in all likelihood the
Board of Supervisors will at next Mon
day's meeting refer the disputed point
to Lane for his written opinion thereon.
Dodge also points to the fact that in 1S92,
when the State board raised San Fran
cisco's assessment 15 per cent, the raise
was entered in red ink In the column re
served for the State tax and the city's
rate was collected on the lower valuation
as returned by-' the Assessor. .
"The whole JdifHculty." says Assessor
Dodge, "appears to be that San Fran
cisco Is the only county which fixes the
city tax levy before the State levy Is
adopted. The charter requires that the
city rate be adopted on the last Monday
in June. The State law provides that tHe
levy for city and State purposes shall be
made on the third Monday in September.
If the latter course, were followed the
city would fix the rate so that no more
money than is required for the expenses
of the city government could be collected
Assessor Dodge, however, points to the
constitutional amendment adopted since
the issuance of the decision referred to,
which gives to San Francisco the right
to regulate its own municipal affairs.
Dodge is corroborated In this view by City
Baehr points to a Supreme Court
decision in the case of E. J. Baldwin
against the Tax Collector of Los
Angeles County to recover illegal taxes,
which recites that the State Board
of Equalization has power to increase
or lower the assessment roll of a county
so as to affect taxes for county purposes,
and further, that the manifest intention
of the law is that when the State board
raised the total value of the assessment
roll of Los Angeles County It was done
for all taxable purposes as well for coun
ty as for State.
BODGE QUOTES LAW.
Assessor Dodge also consulted with City
Attorney Lane and both officials agreed
that the raise of the State Board of
Equalization, should it stand, will affect,
the State tax only and the city rate will
be based on the lower valuation as re
turned by Assessor Dodge. Dodge and
Secretary Colgan of the State Board of
Equalization agreed that* such would be
the case. Dodge's valuation was $427,
641,648, which was raised by the Board of
Equalization to $545,Â£55,324.
Should the increased valuation be ac
cepted for both city and State purposes
it will mean the collection of additional
taxes on $118,213,676. the amount of the
increase, which at $1,076 on the $100 as
sessed valuation will result in putting
about $1,200,000 in the city treasury, for
which absolutely no provision was made
in the budget adopted last June by the
Board of Supervisors.
From investigations so far pursued by
Auditor Baehr that official is of the opin
ion, however, that but one valuation
should be entered on the assessment roll.
AFFECTS STATE TAX ONLY.
"The principle involved," said Assessor
Dodge, "is that the constitution guaran
tees that property cannot be confiscated
without due process, of law. In other
words, the taking away of property un
der the guise of taxation is unconstitu
tional."
A number of large property* owners
were in consultation yesterday with As
sessor Dodge for tho purpose of taking
steps to have the arbitrary raise of the
assessed valuation by the State Board of
K<,ualizatlon set aside by the . Federal
courts. The plan as agreed upon con
templates the institution of mandamus
proceedings to review the action of the
board with the object of showing that
the raise was unwarranted and that the
assessed valuation as fixed by Assessor
Dodge should stand.
As ground for the action a parallel case
was cited In the State of Illinois, where*
on application of the railroad the Fed
eral courts intervened and reviewed the
assessment as made by the State Board
of Equalization, which raised the assess
ment to a valuation of 100 cents upon the
stocks and bonds of the corporations.
The Federal courts thereupon fixed the
assessment far in excess of what the
railroads had paid taxes upon in the past,
but still at a lesser amount than the
Board of Equalization had raised it to.-
The suit will be instituted at once by
some property owner yet to be decided
upon. -
With reverent ceremony the remains of
the late Rev. Father Eugene O'Growney
were escorted yesterday morning from the
hall of the Knights of the Red Branch
to St. Mary's Cathedral by a detachment
of the League \>t the Cross Cadets and
priests and numerous friends of the la
mented divine.
The cathedral, which was draped' In
black, was crowded and the service was
impressive. The oaken casket was cov
ered with the flag of Ireland and the Stars
and Stripes, upon which rested a cross and
anchor of white flowers and a heart com
posed of immortelles sent by the O'Grow
ney branch of the Gaelic League, In which
the departed priest took so great and
strong an interest.
Among the "notable members of the
church present were Archbishop Riordan,
Archbishop Montgomery and Very Rev.
Father Prendergast. vicar general, and
fully fifty priests were seated in the sanc
tuary.
During the procession to the cathedral

A WOMAN TO BE PBETTY
Must Have Luxuriant and Glossy
Hair, No Matter What Color.
The finest contour of a female face, the
sweetest sznlle of a female mouth loses
something If the head Is crowned with
scant hair. Scant and falling hair, it is
now known, is caused by a parasite that
burrows Into the scalp to the root of the
hair, where it eaps the vitality. The lit-
tle white scales the germ throws up In
burrowing are called dandruff. To cure
dandruff permanently, then, and to stop
falling hair, that germ must be killed.
Newbro'a Herplcide, an entirely new re-
sult of the chemical laboratory, destroys
the dandruff germ. and. of course, stops
the falling: hair and prevents baldness.
Bold by leading drugpists. Send 10c In
'tumps for sample to The Herplclde Co.,
