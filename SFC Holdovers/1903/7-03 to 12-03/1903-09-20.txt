a covered passage where outbound carts
stopped to have their loads weighed, and
two windows looking out on a yard
crowded with the dealer's commodities.
At the far end of the yard was a wharf,
bordering a recess from a canal. On tha

"Then before you go to my house go to
the doctor's and- leave this for him.".
Mr. Bunton > enclosed th* documentâ tha
deed for the land ; which Dr. Paxton had
boughtâ in a large envelope, sealed and
addressed it,\ saying, "It's something the

leave It with the hired girlâ keep it and
give It to : ma I this evening." -
Harry Lawton, . the clerkâ "Harry" to
every, one; alwaysâ stood motionless until
he heard the merchant Jump Into his
buggy ;.and speak to the horse
that must take him to 'the bank before
closing hours. The crimson , flush that
overspread the clerk's pretty, womanish
skin as the merchant left the office sud
denly . blanched*.' Hi . paused, looked cau
tiously ; out Into the busy yard, then
walked . oof tly to ."â¢' small wardrobe In a
corner; of Â¦ the' office. From that he took
first, a street coat, which he put on in

inside pocket he carefully placed the min
ister's quarterly salary. Tha envelope ad.
dressed to Dr. Paxton ha thrust carelessly
Into a pocket of a light overcoat he neit
put on.,",- Then from tha. bottom of tha
wardrobe, hidden by loose .': papers, he
brought forth a valise. This he carried
to tha door and dropped on the sidewalk,
where Jit, was - invisible from the office.
When he had put on hU hat and gloves
said that the- -doctor
was very* tired when he came In and felt
disappointed when he got the call for a
distant visit. "I don't know which is tha
most used up, the horse or I," ha bad

But Dr. Paxton did not return In time
to look. In , at the MttÂ© Society, nor was

When he was gone she became calm.
"He'll not be hard on Daisy. He'll for
give them both. Harry couldn't have
meant to take the money. He's such a
sweet boy?" she said over and over.
And so she met her evenin* guests;
the fathers and mothers of families with
whom every interest of her life had be
gun, developed and matured. None of
these was surprised at the absence of rest
less rushing Ike Bunton: nor that Daisy
should have gone with him to Round Val

ton's home, where she frequently visited.
She had been looking ill lately, more than
one matron observed, and the visit would
freshen her ud.
But Harry was missed. Many asked
for him and said they hoped he would be
there. Their simple social doings wera
much dependent upon Harry. None so
apt as Harry at charades and all kinds
of games. Not even the minister was as
clever at riddles as Harry; and he was
as good as a professional at sleight-of
hand. .Even the young beaux admitted
his clevernessâ though he was go popular
with the belles. But he was not the kind

upon his growing fame as a newspaper
man, dutifully seconded bis sister Grace
In her neighborly - efforts to make the
guests not too much regret Harry's ab
sence.
Howard told Mrs. Bunton that his
father, the doctor, had not been horn* to
dinner. - He- had not seen him. Indeed, to
salute him as postmaster, for the doctor
had ! been called out of town Just before
supper and,. before Howard returned from
his work: He left word with the hired
girl that he would look In at the Buntona*
If he returned before 10 o'clock.
He rushed from the house, but in a few
minutes returned. "Yes. a thief!" he
said. "He stole the minister's salary to
take our daughter on her wedding Jour
ney!"
After a little- be spoke more quietly.
"Carrie," he said, "perhaps we can sava
her â ourselvesâ from public disgrace. See.
this dispatch means nothing to others
than us. *H. I* and Margie married.'
Margie.â Our pet name for her and only
ours. Seven o'clock. I can catch the

He went for his coat and hat.
"Isaac. Isaac, don't be hard on her!"
begged Mrs. Bunton.
"On her!" he answered. "No, not on
her. Listen. Carrie; we must keep this
secret. The folks will be coming soon.
Say I'm suddenly called away on busi
ness; that Daisy is with me. That'll sat
isfy all of 'em. If you care for my life's
peace of mind give no sign of this. Per
haps it need never be known publicly."
"Oh, Isaac, don't be hard on her," wepP
the mother.
There was a tone of appeal at the end,
for she saw in her husband's eyes signs
of storm. "Calling!" he exclaimed. "He
has no right to be calling 1 . I gave him
some business to attend to for meâbusi
ness that bad to . do with money." Ha
started uo with the last words, and said.
"I want to send the man. over to the par
sonage to ask Mr. Callman about some
thing."
There was a ring at the door, and. with
out waiting for the mala. Mr. Bunton
answered it. A tHesrram. He did not
open it until he had returned to the sit
ting room. Then he read it, and lot it
drop from his hand with * cry of rage.
"Married! To a sneaklns Rood for
naught!*' ....
Mrs. Bunton picked up the dispatch, but
hers was a cry of joy: "Oh thank God*
Daisy Is safe!"
She had never before seÂ«n the man who
now turned on her, the man to whom she
had been nearly twenty years married.
"Safe, and you thank God? I would have
thanked God had the cars crushed her
life out, as you feared, rather than this!
A silly! A pretty, witless thing that I
gave work toâ as I would give food to a
puppy that you likedâ to keep It from
starving. A smirking, mincing, dancing,

only son I am to have! A timid, lazy "
He stopped, and his expression of raga
turned to despair, as he whisperedâ "And,
perhaps a thief!"
"Oh," she said, with a sigh of relief,
"like as not Daisy met Harry and they're
calling somewhere. You know what a
hand Harry is for calling."
Husband and wife stared at each other,
neither speaking; but her eyes began to

Harry Was afraid you would be cross. I
knew you wouldn't. Why, papa, what's
the matter?"
For the first time since he had read
the telegram Isaac Bun.on felt something
in his heart that was not wholly anger;
something like pity for the girl, perhaps,
as he realized her perfect ignorance of
the character of the man wno now stood
behind her, smiling weakly, though he
was pale with fright. Perhaos, too, his
fa ncr heart was touched that she came
to him with the perfect confidence In
which they had always met; perhaps, too,
he recognized in her belief that what she
had done was right, because she had done
It, his own strongest trait reflected in her.
But in this emotion*, whatever the cause,
there was no pity for the rr.un. "Daisy."
he said. "I'm coiner to the hotel with you;
we can not talk here."
She looked at him, surprised at his tone.
"Papa, you ure not. cross? "Won't you
speak to Harry?"
Her father did r.ot answer, and she
pouted for a little time as thev walked
toward the hotel: but she soon save her

rV'-A BRAND FROM THE BURNING.
His knowledge of Harry's character led
Mr. Bunton to the largo city a little way
beyond the State border, and there he
easily found the trail of the man he was
now as anxious to find as he had been to
be rid of. He had not questioned himself
with particularity as to the course he
should follow when he should flnd Harry,
and demand the return of the fleedv* He
began to have fears he had not felt be
fore that the pursue* and harassed man
might demand payment for the deed, or
more hush money; he felt less certain of
successfully working on his cowardice,
his fear of arrest. The merchant was an
noyed with himself that he should enter
tain these doubts and fears. What if he
should not find Harry? A new deed could
be made and recorded, and the- Interests of
Howard and Grace Paxton protected.
That was his only object in this Journey
âwas it not? He had only their Interests
at heartâ was it not so? Why chase the
thief, then? But he went on to another
town, where, his Information made it
seem certain. Harry had gone. There,
after a considerable search, he learned at
a hotel that Harryâ he was traveling un
der a false name, but was so easily de
scribedâhad left but a few minutes be
fore, presumably to take a train. Mr.
Bunton hurried to the station, where he
made inquiries of a police officer, who
said. "I think the party you're after
boarded that train," pointing to a train
Just starting out. Mr. Bunton looked and
at a window of a patsing car saw Harry
On a sudden impulse he started forward
to beard the train, already moving swift
ly; but the offlcer caught his arm. saying,
"Excuse me, but this Is what I'm here
for. Tco many pepole are hurt trying to
do that."
Harry had seen Mr. Bunton make the
dash for the train, and sighed with great
relief when he saw him checked. He was
shaking with fear, though, for he had
been constantly apprehensive that he
would be overtaken and carried back to
face trial and imprisonment. He feared
this as another might fear death. His
personal vanity was as great as his
cowardice and always, since the merchant
had first threatened him. he had tortured
himself with fancies of what people
would say of him as a prisoner; what one
woman, who had remarked his soft whita
hands would say to himâ a prisoner at
hard, rough laborâ what another, who had
praised his hair, would say of him with
shaven head! What cruel things would'
the other prisoners say of himâ a fallen
society darling! The torment of these
thoughts, the misery his silly vanity made
him suffer in anticipation had supplied a
score of reasons why Mr. Bunton should
change his miftd, determine, after all, to
prosecute him: and his departure from
the last town had been hastened by the
fear of pursuit. When, then, he did see
Mr. Buntcn and In company with a police
officer, he was well nigh sick witb>- utter
hopelessness. He determined to tarry no
longer in that country, but to travel as
far and as fast as h,e could. >
The train had started in the evening,
but he rode in a day coach. The car waa
nearly full, but for some time he had no
seat companion. When a passenger en
tered and sat down by him his fears re
doubled: Mr. Bunton might have tele
graphed ahead to have him watched. He
pulled his overcoat up around his ears
and his hat far over his eyes, although
the old fashioned car was stove-heated,
and suffocatingly hot. When his seat fel
low good naturedly tried to enter into
conversation he pretended sleep and did
not answer.
The close air. his fatigue, tha rhythmic
rattling cf the wheels, at last brought
him to half-unconsciousness that he
drearily welcomed. How U ng this lasted
he never knewâ so little did he ever know
of that awful nlghtlâ but i ? was aroused
Into bewildered wakefulness by a heavy.
ominous Jolting of the car. the â¢ quick,
gasping cries of passengers, a long,
piercing shriek of the locomotive whistle.
Then there was a hideous crash, a fall for
what seemed to be minutes, and a cruel,
deafening; crushing shock, as If the
world Itself had met another world and
chaos mocked the order of the universe.
For a time there was no human sound;
only the hateful hissing of steam, the
cyrs, VI-fpdM'n and % v.'n'spered, "It will
be all right, Harry. There, put on your
rings," and she gave him two of the tlJ'ee
rings for which part of the Rev. Mr. Â»"!all
man's quarterly Ealary had been spent.
Mr. Bunton, when she left his Jide, had
turned his back and did not' look toward
his unhappy son-in-law until .Daisy had
left the room; Then' ~ he -said, and so
quietly that Harry looked up hopefully.
"I shall not- have you arrested and. sent
to prison if you promise to do- promotl/
and precisely all I tell you .to do."
"Yes. Mr.' Bunton, I'll do. anything you
soyâ anything!" ;>}
"You are to leave the State and n<jt re
turn, nor muke any appearance In Daisy's
suit for -divorce," " the ' merchant said.
"Also, you are never to speaK to any one
of yourâ your marriage."
Harry had- looked greatly relieved" at the
promise of immunity from arrest: but now
t.i> was fearful that' he could not comply
with the condition. "I've spent much of
the money that Iâ I borrowed, Mr. Bun
ton," he faltered. "How can I get away
and live until Iâ I find work?"
! " '"I am going to give you five hundred
dollars," Mr. Bunton said. Harry's face
brightened. ' "You understand . the condi
tions; you are to go away at once, stay
away, remain silent, and so long as you
do so I will not prosecute you. You under
stand that there are no statutes of limita
tion which apply to your offense. I can
have you arrested and put In prison any
time you fail in any of your promises.
And, Harryâ look at meâ I will do exactly
as I say about the prison. I need not re
peat that. You know me.'!
. No need to repeat it in truth. The poor
young man - was chilled through and
shakins? with fright every, time the word
prison or , arrest was spoken. Even the
thought of the $500 could not dispel his
ague of fear, though through his troubled
mind there danced details of the luxuries
' his . unexpected Â¦: fortune would purchase.
No need to repeat' the -threat, for already
he was eager to; start, fearful that -the
offer of immunity and* money would-be
withdrawn before he could Â¦ take advan
tage of it. He ' glanced apprehensively; at
the merchant and said softly. "Did you
Â¦wish me to start at once, sir?"
' "At once.'Â»-Is* that your valise?"
."Yes,' sir; we were goingâ somewhere
elseâ this afternoon. It's all packed."
* cup of tea, while he reharnessed the
corse.
The farmer whose sick child the doctor
attended, three miles out on the Red
House road, said to Howard Paxton:
"Doc never left baby till nigh onto 10
o'clock. 'I've had a long day/ he says,
â¢and will be r'.ad to get home.* says he.
â¢and so will the horse," *ayÂ» he. 'Baby's
doing finely,' says he, 'but I'll drive out
to-mcrrow. so's 1 cÂ«n charge you for two
visits,' says he, always having his Joke.
Wife asks him to stop all night in the
epare room, but Doc says he has a couple
of babies cf his own to home, meaning
you and your sister Grace, as we knowed,
end that he hadn't seen you since morn
ingânot even to hear you call him post
master. So he drove on*, the horse as
tired as him. and llke's not both on "em
asleep and not hearing the engine whis
tle. There's no flagman at that crossing
.efter 7 o'clock, so nobody knew how it
happened. But my wife tells me to come
and tell you a* we both recollects his lat
wordsâ lÂ«Â»ast wipe the iÂ»Â«t that we hÂ«ard
him sayâ was about you and your sister:
calling you. In a loving way, babiesâ as
fathers do sometimes, even when chil
dren be grown up."
The farmers view as to the manner in
â¢wtiich I>r. Paxton came to his death at
the railroad crossing on his way home
from the patieat on Red House road was
also adopted by coroner and po.ice. There
was no sign of foul play, and if the large
sum of money the doctor had dra\4n from
the bank that day was on his person at
the time of the fatal accident, as it
teemed certain it was. It waÂ« stolen, un
doubtedly, by some tramps who were the
first to tlnd the docior's bocy. This con
clusion became final when a tramp was
arrested trying to dispose of the doctor's
watch, taken from the body where It had
been tossed by the locomotive.
III-AN INTERRUPTED HONEYMOON.
Donald Bunton, the money-lending
fi.rir.er, regretted bis son's success in
town as postponing the day when, he be
lieved. Isaac would return to the farm
end take up Its and his father's growing
affairs. They had quarreled of late about
Isaac's business, Â«.*j>ecially since specu
lation had enured into it Isaac kn<vv
that his father was rich enough to have
spared him that day the money he ob
tained from L>r. Paxton. but the thought
of borrowing from him had not entered
his mind. He knew that a request to his
father for help would be fruitful only In
more acrimonious discussion. But if he
would return homeâ all would t>e his.
"When Isaac comes horn*." the faiiier
would say, "this county will put In Its
claira for the congress nomination. He'll
come back to the farm. He'll soon tire
of foolish town ways."
On that night Donald Bunton. dreaming
his only dream, as he sat In the lonely
dining-room after his lonely "upper, re
solved when next month's Thankogiv ng
day should agaJn_brlng_hii ion under thÂ«
old roof to be kinu.ier; to urge hi* own
age. his growing affairs rather than his
objection to' town life as a reason for
hastening the homecoming. He liked
Isaac's wife, and Daisy was the one per
son he indulged and petted. The house
6hould have grand improvement.* lor
Isaac. anJ for Daisy the home life should
be altered as* she commanded. He was
reused from h!s dreams by a knock at the
door, and when he opened it he cried
aloud: "Isaac, you've come back, my
con."
"Come back, father?'
"I meanâ I must have been dreaming.
It is lateâ past nineâ Â«h?" He gianc^d
from the clock to his son. on whose ta.ee
the wood ftre lifc-ht shone brightly.
"Isaac, what Is ii? Carrie. Daisy?"
He showed his father the telegram and
told him of the embezzltm.nt of the min
isu-r's salary. There was no need to tell
him cf Harry Lawton's character. The
old man had occasionally seen Harry in
the coal office, and had instinctively dls
likÂ«d the young man so violently that he
was h luso'.f surpris >d at it. In his mini
he always compared Harry to the weak
kneed colt, or the rickety calf, it was his
rule to sell or kill, young, as not being
worth the cost of raising.
When his son's etory was finished! the
old farmer leaned far ever in his chair.
g&Tirg steadily at the fire and several
minuses passed before he said, as if
th;nÂ»;r.g aloud. "The d.spatch was sent
fr L m ot;r station. I can learn all about
it from ihe station master, and likely get
a notion wtuie they are."
"That's it!" the son exclaimed. "When
I find him. I'll scare him into silence;
thrÂ«aien him with arrest. He's as easily
frightened as a girl."
"He must be bought oft," the farmer
declared.
Isaac started at the words.
"He must be paid to desert her so that
we can get the divorce. I can get it in
this county and keep It quiet, too."
"Father, I came away wiihjut any
money, and I could not draw -that Is "
"Money?" Interrupted the old man. He
did not notice his son's embarrassment,
but took from his pocket a package of
money. "1 was In town to-Â«lay, Isaac.
They told me at the bank that you'd be
in toon, but I couldn"t wait, as I'd prom
lsea to make a loan here to-day. I drew
$5003 at the bank and loaned 3-000 of it
here this afternoon. The other J3i>00 I
promised to a man from up county to
morrow. Pait of it will do him at pres
ent. I've money enough, and glad to
spend It to get our little girl shut of that
smirking cub!"
The r.ext morning Donald Bunton went
to the station early and talked to the
agent about some shipments. He rope to
go. after a method cal adjustment of the
business, but turned and said carelessly.
"Any news, Hiram?"
"Nothing paiticular this morning.
BQuire. Oh," he addtd, ' gi.es â¢ s me tr.end
oi Ike's was marned soinewhtres around
here yesterday."
The agent was talking to the station's
largest shipper, and an old friend. Un
der *uch circumstances telegraph mes
sages ate not always In v tola ..e. The
agent told the story: As the s.x-thlrty
train halted a passenger standing on a
car blaiform had handed a messaee to
the agent with the money to pay for it.
He. H.rain, had read it, "seeing as it was
for Isaac," and given it to the operator
to send.
"Who was it, you say, gave the mes
eag*?"
"Wa'n't no name signed to It. A c'.ty
Jake, with skin like a woman's, and a
little mustache all waxed up. Ike's
friends mutt have money to throw away
when they'll spend Â£5 cents Just to tell a
man that they're married."
"No telling what town folks will do.
Good-day, Hiram."
The six-thirty train? Its last previous
stopping ctace was Lime Ridge. That
was probably where they were married.
The ntxt considerable town beyond
Round Valley was Portage. That was
probably* where they were going. Soon
after hearing the station-master's story
Donald Dunton took train for Lime Ridge
and Isaac for Portajre.
Donald Bur.ton went to the office of the
Lime Ridge Justice, who. It chanced,
owed his place to the politically powerful
farmer He remained with the Justice
half an hour and left him. satisfied that
no one else would know, "for the pres
ent," of a marriage ceremony performed
in his cottage the evening before; nor
would tlie fact of the marr.age be made
of record "for the pre.ent."
Isaac Bunton reached Portage a little
before noon. This was a town of Beveral
thousand Inhabitants, a considerable ship
ping point on the canal, the county seat,
a busy, tprightly place with a pretentious
shopping f.reet, aiong which the mer
chant walked on the way to the principal
hotel. He had never in his life felt such
nearly uncontrollable anger as when he
hurried . along. " hopingâ and dreadingâ to
find Daisy at the hotel. He muttered to
himself that when he should see Lawton
he must refrain from violenceâ even in
speechâ if the main object of his expe
dition, a prompt, quiet dismissal of the
hustand, was to be accomplished. He
was training phrases it would be most
politic to use. when he saw them coming
out of a Jewelry store. Daisy was eager
ly examining their purchases, as they
tumid up In the streot&heau 1 of him. but
Mr. Bunton counted J500 into the clerk s
hands. "There Is ~~ a Y train," ' hÂ« said. "go-
Ing south .very soon. '\ You will, go on
that." â¢ * "-Â¦Â¦â¢;:
"May I tea Daisy?" Harry asked
faintly.
Mr. Bunton picked up the Tallse, an old
fashioned black leather caae, on whoe'e
metal clasp he chanced to notice the
owner's initials roughly scratched, and
handed It to Harry without a word. The
young man sighed; he had hoped for the
emotional satisfaction of a. parting from
his bride.* He believedâ knewâ that she
would promise to wait for him, would as-
sure him of her belief in his Innocence,
would, certainly weep and embrace him.
and ha would tell her that he was mak
ing the sacrifice for her sake, and then
tear himself away with a heroic speech."
His poor, unstable wits were framing
such a speech in the came fragmentary
way that he was thinking of the pleasure
he would buy with the money he still
held in his hands. But the significant ac
tion of the merchant recalled him to a
dismal sense of his peril. He put the
money in his pocket and walked out of
the room, carrying the black leather va
lise. .
Mr. Bunton waited for some time for
Daisy to appear. He expected that she
would' come as soon ts she heard 'the
noise -of the departure. â¢ He dreaded an
other Interview with her, since the rev
elation of her character the first inter
view had made. His experience with Har
ry, had been Just what he had expected,
for he, had never been in any doubt of
that young man's moral weakness." He
had read him, as he did most men. cor
rectly, except that If he had been called
upon to consider the matter he would
have thought that Harry did not have
courage to steal. He was confident that
his threat would effect its purpose with
him; that no prompting of
greed or want would embolden Harry to
attempt to assert himself as Daisy's hus
band or to becoma troublesome as a
threatening beggar after the divorce. But
Daisy? She had astounded him. He had
taken It for granted that his admission
of guilt would make her turn on her hus
band with indignant loathing. Her unex
pected attitude amazed and troubled him.
But/after the first relief that Daisy did
not at once appear and demand an expla
nation her father -began to feel nervous
that she did not appear. There was no
Â¦ound whatever from her room. Could
she have fainted? A sudden worse fear
sent him with a bound to the door. Ho
opened it and looked into the room.
Daisy was seated In a deep, old-fashioned
rocking chair, but so motionless that he
stepped forward fearsomely, lest his sud
den thought should prove to be true. Ho
smiled grimly, though, when he | stood
close by her side; her feet were resting
on the hearth of: a small box stove In
which a low wood fire was burning; her
right hand lay in her lap, loosely hold
ing a novel; her left hand rested over an
open box of candy oh the window sill,
and she slept peacefully. â¢
He stood by her side many minutes mo
tionless, silent: but there were tears In
his eyes. She was only 17 .'and she slept
bo quietly, looked much younger. He
could almost seeâ could fully realizeâ her
baby face, as he had often watched it in
Infant sleep, and he knew that he would
give all else that he valued on earth to
efface the last day of her lifeâ almost
wished that her profound sleep was her
last, profounder one. He sighed, per
haps, for the girl awoke, smiled, and said.
"Oh, Is It you, papa? Where is mamma?"
Then he sobbed, and she sat up with a
B'art, and said in a very different- tone,
"Where is Harry?"
"Gone? Where?" '.Â¦.-Â¦Â¦
"Gone away. He has left you."
"I don't .believe it!" she cried. Jump
ing to her feet !n a rage. "If he has you
have sent him away. You have frightened
him. He must come bacKâ I will sro to
him.";;.;; Â¦ *
Then her father said what he hoped he
would not have to say: "He has accepted
a bribe to desert you, Margie; and to es
cape the penalty of his. theft." '
"1 don't believe you! -You're lying to
me!" ' Â¦'-â¢. '"\-
"Margie! . Oh. Margie!? He stared at h!s
child, frightened: then sudden'y. held out
his hands to her. But sue turned from
him, and went to the window, where she
ftood tapping the pane with her fingers;
and would not answer when he spoke to
her. He did not reprove her. but said,
over and over, how unwortny Harry was
of her; how weak; foolish, yes. and crim
inal. He, her father, would forgrive herâ
had forgiven hnrâ for her mistake, the
error of her ignorance and inexperience;
and thev would all, ner mother, father,
grandfather, treat her as if this had not
happened. -It would be forgot by them
and no one else would know.
But she would not answer nor look at
him; nor when, soon after, her grand
father came and took her in his arms
and petted her, did she. speak to him. She
did not once speak on the!r Journey back
to Round Valley.
At the farm Mrs. Bunton was waiting
for them and Daisy ran to her weeping.
They were together In the mother's room
for an hour, while Isaac waited alone in
the cold, stiffly furnished parlor.
He had been sitting in the dark and
when his wife came to him he rose to
light a lamp\ but she took his hand quiet
ly and led him back to his chair, sea tins
herself near him and holding both of hU
hands as he told her every detail of his
story from the tlms he left her the even
ing before. It was a minute after he had
concluded before she said softly, "Isaac,
do you striousiy think that you and fath
er Bunton cah go on with this planâ get
a separation, a divorce?"
"Why not?" he asked in a surprised
"Why not!" she repeated. "Why, Isaac,
what can you be thinking of? Daisy will
never consent to this. She will never agree
to this: She will never agree to give up
Harry."
"Carrie! Give him up? He has given
her up. He has deserted her."
"She will find him wherever he Is. She
can never be convinced that he has de
serted herâ it would make no difference.
She loves him."
"Loves him!" he cried in angry amaze
ment. "The man Is a thief."
"She does not believe It. She loves him."
"Loves him! after he has taken a bribe
to run away from herâ the sneak!!'.
"She .does not believe that he has run
away. She loves him.'! Â¦
' "Carrie, In the .name, of Â¦ heaven, how
can you talk like that?" He threw her
hands away from him and started to his
feet. : . â¢Â¦>'
Â« "Listen, Isaac," she raid, patiently
drawing him to his chair again, but not
again taking his hands.. "You and father
Bunton have made your plans as if you
had a childâ a babyâ to deal with. Daisy
Is a woman. She is in love. No, don't
go away. You must hear me, or you will
only make matters worse, bring more
suffering, more trouble to us all. If you
do not understand what I, understand â
that Daisy can no more be made to see
any of this matter as you do than the
blind can be made to see, or the dead
to speak." Â¦
He felt her sob, and some of the anger
that had possessed him all day passed
from him, and he realized with a sudden
softness of his heart somethingâ not
muchâ of the tender consideration he
owed to the faithful, unquestioning love
which was here, which sometimes he for
got was so near to him. He drew her
â¢chair close to his and put h!s arm around
her and thought of the pretty little school
teacher she was when' he met and Impet
uously* wooed and won her. He had loved
her then; had believed that, he could not
live without her;- and she had loved him
â but he' was an honest,, brave fellow;
hopeful,, courageous. Independentâwor
thy of a good woman's ' love. "Carrie,"
he said, "It can't be possible that Daisy
cares so much for Harry that she will
not agree to our. plan to end .'this misera
ble business, ", when she has had a day or
t.vo to considerâ^o realize what a worth
less scamp he* is."
"I wish I could think so," she an-
It was not until he sat before the fir*
thinking of the sad news his wife had

time the deed to Dr. Paxton which Harry
Lawton still had with him, presumably.
It was to overtake Harry that he started
by the first train the next morning.
"Isaac." said the old farmer gravely,
"is it any business that I can do for you?
You should be at the funeral. If you can."
"I know, fatherâ thank you. But I must
attend to thl* myself."
"I know. Carrie. Of course. I am sorry,
but I can't go to the funeral. I must go
down the valley. There is some business.

She told the story of the accident at

met his death, and her hearers listened
with expressions of sorrow, for the doc

as well as his son's close friend. They

seated before the wood fire, when Isaac
startled the others by abruptly Jumping
to his feet and exclaiming. "Howard, you
say. had not seen his father since the
morning?"
"Oh. Isaac:" nhe exclaimed, tears start-

sadly. "Isaac I think there la something

THE SUN DAY CALL.'
2THE SUNDAY. CALL.
groaning of riven timber, the snapping of
Â¦teel, as th.e cars, which had dashed to
the bottom of a deep ravine, settled still
farther In their shapeless, twisted 'mass.
Then oame the first cry of pain; others,
and soon the ravine was filled with an
awful chorus of cries, prayers, com
mands, shrieks and groans. Some nas
sengers crawled from the wreck, unhurt,
unscratched even, but madmen; others
bruised, broken, bleeding, surveyed the
scene, and were calm commanders. These
organized the less calm into rescue gangs;
and soon their work was lighted by a
blaze that urged them on with fury of
endeavorâ the wreckage was afire!
Some time afterwardâ monthsâ when It
had ceased to be a sleeping and waking
nightmare to him, Harry Lawton be
lieved that he never lost consciousness.
His first thought was that the mass of
wreck was shifting, settling, and that a
pressure across his legs was becoming
greater. He moved his legs and cleared
them; a ehort piece of timber which
pinned the man in the scat with him
came partly over his chest, too, but he
squeezed out from under it. He crawled
through an opening, and found himself on
a pile of shapeless material that in the
dim light bore small resemblance to cars
â a torrent's driftwood, rather. He clam
bered down, and was neon standing in
Icy water up to his knees. It was then
that the scene began to glow; and some
fleeting thought of what the horror was,
what it was to be. flashed through his
mind, and he ottered a. scream so terrible
It frightened him, and he listened to hear
it repeated, not knowing that it was his
own voice. He dashed across the creek,
climbed a high bank and then turned
and looked back. He saw the broken
bridge, the lights of the express train
that had b topped on the opposite Bide;
saw men from that train hurrying to the
aid of the wreck; saw the flames leaping
high, to cut short the work they lighted.
Then he wondered how he came where
he was. turned and wandered away,
laughing at times, then crying, but al
ways wondering how and why he, poor
Harry Lawton. came to be wandering
through the fields at night, and so cold!
The train which Harry saw standing on
the opposite Bide of the river ravine was
the express, which had followed his train,
and which would have 6oon passed it on
a siding. Among the first express-train
passengers to clamber down the bank
and help In the work of rescue was Isaac
Bunton. He was practical, Btrong and
commanding; and was soon directing the
work: asking nothing of others in which
he did not help; cautioning all to be care
ful to preserve every article In or near
the bodies of the dead, and particularly
of those unfortunates who had been in
the cars where fire had done the saddest
havoc. Before daylight a train came with
surgeons, nurses and officials of the rail
road. A list of all the saved was made.
Harry Lawton's name was not among
those. Then the identification of the dead!
One poor blackened thing that had been a
human being was taken from what had
been the right side of the day coach, near
the middle of the car; no other passen
ger seemed to have been In that seat.
â¢â¢Anything to identify It by?" an official
asked. Isaac Bunton listened for the re
ply "Nothing but the handle of a valise,
gripped In the half-burnt nand. and the
metal oart of the valise clinging to the
handle." . .,
"There may be a name on the metai,
suggested Mr. Bunton.
An attendant cleaned the blackened
metal while another held cioÂ«e a light.
"The initials 'H. L.' are scratched on It.
6i "It was Harry Lawton of White River,"
said Mr. Bunton. "A short time before I
took the express I saw him seated in the
day coach, on the right hand side. of the
car and alone In the seat. I happen to
Know that he carried a valis* with the
initials of his name scratched on the
metal near the handle. He was a clerk in
m "Can you give me the name of any one
we should notifyâ as to the-Â«râ remains?
said the official.
"He had no relatives that I know of,
Mr. Bunton replied. "I shall take It as a
favor if you will see that the body has
proper burial, and communicate with me
in regard to the entire expense." He gave
the official his card.
The official read the card by the light
of a lantern he carried and bowed respect
fully, for the newspaper of his town had
just reported in a prominent article that
Mr. Isaac Bunton of White River was the
heavy purchaser of pig Iron, the timeiy
sale of which would enable the local fur
nace to proceed at once with the prom
ised addition to Its works, an improve
ment which would greatly benefit the
town. So the official respectfully said he
would attend to any matter Mr. Bunton
Intrusted to him, and Mr. Bunton went
to the train that was to carry him back
to his widowed daughter; thinking of the
horror of the fire In the wreck; the fire
Â¦which had destroyed the lives of so many;
consumed their baggage â even the
clothes they woreâ and everything their
baggage and pockets, contained. Such
a thine as a deed, for example.
Vâ THE SEA-FOOD MAN.
It was but two or three miles to the
little village nearest the scene of the train
WTeck, but It was after daylight when
Harry Lawton, half . dazed, weary and
frightened, reached it Already the news
of the disaster had aroused the inhabi
tants, and those who had not hurried to
the wreck were at work preparing the
church for use as a hospital, under in
structions sent by the Burgeons, who
found that many of the injured could not
at once be taken on the longer Journey
to the larger town some miles beyond.
Harry p purposeless, except as to get as
far as* possible from the scene, of the
wreck and his pursuing employer, would
have hurried raet the gathering at the
churchâ In whose burial ground, a few
days later, was placed a stone inscribed
with his nameâ but that a kindly old
dame EDoke to him.
"You are hurt, sir. Could you have
come from the accident?"
"I am not hurt," he replied.
"Why, mister, look!" and she touched
his cheek and pointed to the front of his
overcoat â both bloodstained. "Come," she
said, "there's no aoctor here, but we can
dress those cuts; they're not much, I
hope."
Harry followed her into the church,
where she bathed his wounds, cuts made
by flying splinters, while others stood
about and asked questions. He could not
have told much had he wanted to. He
gave his name as Harry Lambert, and
his home as the town he had left the
evening before, and said that he must
hurry on â it was Important. He grace
fully took the hot coffee offered, and with
bis cuts simply dressed by the good dame,
went on to the station; though his nurse
urged him to wait until the doctors came,
for there was one cut. deeper than the
others, that troubled her. It was noth
ing, he said; though as. he spoke the
woundâ It was on his right cheek, near
the corner of his mouthâ numbed his face
and tightened his lips oddly.
He was in New York the next day, in
a cheap little boarding-house, where a
woman brought him his meals, for he
could not leaye his bed. He was wholly
exhausted, and the hurt cheek pained
him, but he would be all right, he eald,
In a few days, and the woman seemed to
be glad to serve him, he was so gentle
and grateful. His manner with women
made many of them compassionate him,
and here, in the dingy boarding-house,
the hard-working mistress petted the
stranger and made much of him without
reasoning why. He would not have a
doctor. "And no reason you should,"
poor heart," the woman said, "for that
cut is nearly healed, and Is leaving a
dimple of a scar." I '
"But what is it doing to my lips?" Har
ry asked.
"Nothing," she replied. Then after a
pause, looking at him closely, VDidn't
you always smile, all the time?"
"Iâ Iâ guess not,", he said, and hit eyes
and bro.ws were not smiling now, though
his lips wereâ and always would bel
Harry found that he had, besides his
collection of Jewelry, nearly $300 In mon
ey, but no clothes except those he wore
in the train. They were !n bad condition,
and the overcoat, was pierced by splin
ters. Its front stained with^ his blood.
The woman said she could put It In- good
enough shape for him to wear when he
went to buy more clothes, and he began
emptying Its pockets, for her to take it.
In an Inside pocket he foundâ what had
not been in his mind since he took It to
deliver to Dr. Paxtonâ the deed. He
turned pale at the sight of it, and trem
bled bo that the paper dropped from his
hands. "What Is it. dear?" she asked in
alarm. .
He sat down weaklyâ overcome, for the
events of his last days in JVhite River
had already become vague In his bewil
dered mind, but the Bight of the docu
ment brought all his fears back with ex
aggerated force, and he, looked in such
dread that the womanâ she was not old.
nor unattractiveâ fastened the door and
sought to reassure him. "Tell me, Har
ry." she said. "I know there's some mys
tery. I'll not betray you. What is the
paper?" . ' ,
It was his nature to be confiding, and
especially to women, but his fear made
him cautious, even to this poor woman,
who, he knew, loved him.
"Not now." he said. 'Take the coat and
clean and mend it. and we'll go out for
some new clothes and a hat for you,
Katie. And well go for dinner, and to
the theater. I'd like to go. to one of the
bright, gay plays you've told me of.
He could not decide for a long time
what to do with the deed. He tried to
read its contents, but the tedious phrase
ology tired him and he could not under
stand its meaning. He thought to de
stroy it, but then, he thought that If Mr.
Bunton should ever overtake himâ he pic
tured him always as in pursuit with an
officer, as he had last aeen him at the
stationâ his failure to produce the deed
might make his punishment greater.
Then, with a fleeting boldness, he thought
that the paper might be a shield against
Mr. Bunton f s wrath. Anyway, he would
keep it conceajed; that would be the
safest way. He had the woman open the
lining of the overcoat when she returned
with It and sew the deed securely within.
They went to a theater that night, and
Harry was Intoxicated with the glory of
lights, music, scenes and beautiful wom
en. He had never dreamed that such vis-
Ions could be realized. His companion
called his attention to one woman who
had but a small part in the entertain
ment but for whom the audienceâ even
the others on the stageâ had lively re
gard. Her few entrances and conspicuous
scenes were loudly applauded, but she
took all these evidences of popularity
with her habitual pose of indifference.
She wore many rich Jewels, and her cos
tumes were notably richer than those of
more prominent performers. - 1 "- : - â¢ -'
"Yes," whispered Harry, "I've been no
ticing her all the time." f
"Oh, have you?" his companion said,
trying to laugh. But she was miserably,
unhappy during the rest of the perfonn
ar.ee.
Harry, fashionably dressed .now, haunt
, ed the theater and restaurant district of
Broadway. He found a society ready to
welcome him, and he had both the dis
position and the manner of i making
friends, which helped him to a place in
that society which, easy and careless as
is its scrutiny of credentials, some men
find closed to them. He was_not a spend
thrift, except in the matter*of purchases
for personal adornment, and his store of
money teok him farther than ten times
the amount might have taken another,
and he was soon established as a recog
nized character In the district. He was
called "Smiling Harry."" Whether he
wished to or not, he always smiled, for
the wound In his cheek, though it left but
a dimple of a scar, had, for lack of proper
surgical attention, brought about a slight
rictus, which fixed his weak, pretty mouth
in a perpetual smile. And this was more
conspicuous since, with a notion of con
cealing his Identity, he had shaved oft his
mustache. He did not make many friends
among men. though many asked him to
supper parties at the gay restaurants pat
ronized by the lesser women of the thea
ters and their escorts. He was such good
company, could do so many clever tricks
with one's rings or watch, and had a
simple store of old-fashioned riddles that
made his men companions laugh at him,
if not at his wit. One night the famous
beauty he had noticed at the theater
Joined the party where Harry sat at sup
per. She was coolly, perhaps one should
say Insolently, indifferent to the eager
welcome and attention of the other men,
but looked with undisguised Interest at
Harry. When he ended a story he was
telling, the woman, not smiling, leaned
over the table, touched the scar on hla
cheek with hei* finger tips and asked,
"Where did you get that?"
"I mustn't tell you where." he replied.
"But I'll tell you why: always to have a
smile for you."
He was never doubtful of himself with
women, and now smiled at her as frankly
as a child might have smiled at her for
her beauty. She kissed the tips of her
lingers and again touched the scar with
them. "You are the man they call Smil
ing Harry?" she asked.
"My name is Harry Lambert," he said.
"Have you seen meâ at the show?"
"Yes."
"Will you take supper here to-morrow
night with my crowd?"
"Yes."
A man now came over from the table
she had deserted, and she rose and left
the restaurant with him. The other men
at the table treated Harry with more
consideration after that.
Not only on the next night, but on
many others, Harry was a . guest at the
table of Georgle Franklynâ called by her
intimates "Babe." Always the same oth
er man was at the table, but otherwise
the party changed from night to night.
Sometimes Harry was Invited to Georgie's
apartments with a party for supper,
which was sent in from a neighboring
club at the order of the other man. Some
times be would call at her apartments in
the afternoon and they would drive
through the park In her brougham, she
enveloped In rich furs. Once she ordered
the coachman to stop at a restaurant 'in
the park, but as they drew near she saw
the other man entering the restaurant,
and gave a hasty order not to stop.
Harry's money, although he was more
often a guest than a host, was growing
low. \ One night he. was entertaining a
party of friends at' their favorite restau
rant when Georgia and her accustomed
escort entered and she asked, "May we
Join you?'t They were welcomed, but
Harry's heart sank as he saw the waiter
bring the expensive champagne the other
man always drank. When the check for
the amount of the supper bill was laid by
his side Harry turned pare, for it was
more by a considerable sum than he had.
The party was very lively and apparently
no one noticed the host's distress. But
soon Harry caught the eye of Georgle,
and Undirected his attention to her, hand,
with which she seemed to be carelessly
toying with a napkin on the table. It
was slowly pushed toward him, and pres
ently lay. before him. Georgle talked
,with unusual animation, holding general
attention, while Harry, as she plainly
wished him to, felt under the napkin.
Her purse was there, and he cautiously
slipped it into his pocket. Then, with a
sigh of relief, he glanced at her. She
looked like Daisy Bunton.
After that, when the other man was
engaged, or was away from the city,
Harry called at the theater for Georgle.
carried her satchel of jewelry to her
brougham, and drove away with her.
Those were happy months, and proud for
the poor fellow. He saw his name in
some of the gossip papers, always as
"Smiling Harry," and frequently asso
ciated with that of Babe Franklyn. He
moved from his mean room at Katie's,
declaring, when she sobbed that he would
return, no fear, for he loved hrr.
Late *ln the spring the thrater where
Georgie appeared closed and the company
went to London. Geors'e said she would
not go, but the otlnr man said he
thought she had better, go: a season in
London would improve hor art, he
thought: anywey. If sho didn't go she
had a proswet of a lonely summer, as
he would be abroad. So she sailed with
the company, after writing Harry a sor
rowful and misspelled letter, In which
she explained that she was so closely
â¢watched that she could not see' him
again; that she would gladly die for him,
if she had any other means of support,
and he must always remember his loving
and heart-broken Babe. She married an
English Duke toward the end of the
London season, arid finds it so hard to
support him, that sho has confided to
friends that she Is sorry she did not mar
ry Smiling Harry, who was much less ex
pensive, and, besides, loved her. \
Harry went back to Katie's and helped
about the boarding-house, but she
learned that he was spending the money
he got by pawning Jewelry Georgie gave
him In entertaining other friends, and
Katie sent him away in a rage.
Harry stll. had many friends in the dis
trict of his early triumphs, but they were
mostly young women of meager incomes,
rather accustomed to' receiving, than giv
ing entertainments, * and â¢ his resources
were low. They Were kindly, hearted and
frankly schemed to have, Harry Included
in supper Invitations, more â¢ especially
when to their experienced understanding
it was plain that without a supper so pro
vided Harry would go without any sup
per whatever. More than onfe of these
friends proposed honest marriage to
Harry; but he had never had a word of
the pro^i^ss of Daisy's divorce suit, and
he .was afraid to. make, any manner of
Inquiry, lest "Mr. Bunton should get track
of him and carry out. the purposeâwhat
ever it may have beenâ which started him
on the search Interrupted by the railway
wreck. So marriage was out of the ques
tion. Also it began to be out of the ques
tion for him to haunt the restaurants of
the district. Men^tired^ojC including him
in. their partles'.jat^tbeT^urgency, of- -the
.women;., he never, entertained; Â£thej very
waiters frowned on him, and In" more
than one place he was brusquely told that
the management had instructed that he
was not to be admitted. Harry then
sought other places, of a poorer kind, but
of much the same class; restaurants and
other resorts on the outskirts of the dis
trict, whose patrons, like him, had fallen
to that plane, or had but just achieved it
on an upward progress. There he met
wrecks and half wrecks, who, like' him,
were' drifting.' to' shoals and rocks of
squalor he^as yet i knew nothing "of, and
trim-looking craft that were trying their
sailing qualities in .that shady water, but
ambitious , for â¢ piratical cruises in the
open," 'sunny seas from which winds of
adversity. ..had. .driven, his. badly piloted
bark. Now his companions ' were per
formers in poor places of entertainment;
thieves, If easy opportunity encouraged
their enterprise; pickpockets and opera
tors of small confidence games.
With the criminal element he consort
ed willingly, but no urging could induce
him to Join In their enterprises; for his
fear of the police was Intense and ever
present But he liked the criminals; they
were generous when in luck, . and his
cheerful company was often sought by
them and paid for with a meal or a
night's lodging. He found some employ
ment, too. In the cheap amusement places,
doing his cleight of hand tricks, telling
his poor stories, and even singing the old
fashioned ballads of White River days.
But these engagements did not last long,
because the audiences at such places
where he appeared Insisted on taking him
only as a Joke, to be laughed at and de
rided, no matter how plaintive his song
or how sad his quavering notes. For
there was ever on his lips that quaint,
questioning smile, so when his value as
a butt and byword was exhausted he
was of no more use there as an entertain
er; and from these cheap but recognized
places he drifted to low resorts that pre
tended to be merely drinking saloons, but
were traps for the curious or unknowing.
There women harpies stole from the cas
ual patrons, or men drugged or used more
violent means to rob; and there for a
time Harryâ "Smiling Harry"â was one of
the attractions; and he sang as he was
ordered pathetic ballads, for those, with
his accompanying smile, drew most cus
tom from the chance seeker for novelty
and best answered the regular patrons'
standard of humor. But even there nov
elty was required and Harry's attraction
failed. As he had not the courage to
steal nor the wit to beg, he would have
starved had not a young woman, cm
ployed as an entertainer in one of the
cheap but decent places of amusement,
in which he, too, had worked, sought him
in his distress and offered him a home.
It was this woman,- Bessie Day, ' who
suggested to Harry an honest employ
ment. He became a night peddler of crabs
and lobsters. In the : evening Bessie
would /prepare his basket of wares, boll
the crabs and lobsters bought cheaply
Just before the ; markets' closing hours,
arrange them In a basket and cover them
with a' clean towel. When the theaters
were turning out their patrons Into the
streets of his old district, Harry went
forth with his offering to hungry and
thrifty buyers. His cry: "Sea food!" re
peated at frequent intervals, in his plaint
ive voice, became one of the familiar
sounds of the night. Harry liked the
work, because It took him Into the dis
trict which had for him more attraction
than anything else in his life. Sometimes
former companions would hail him and
buy liberally, joking over his new-found
Industry. Most he sold to men and wo-
men hurrying to their rooms for supper,
and among these he established a kind of
regular trade; not all profit, for "some,
when they had no money, would deem it
their right to take, with* a laugh,' from
the quaint character, who always smiled,
though what they took, with- dubious
promise to pay, was Harry's profit for a
night's work. Yet, with profit and loss,
the sea-food man helped at the end of
each week to pay the expenses at
"home." >
Bessie , was not Â¦ always employed, * and
-besides her. there was another in the fam
ily to be '.provided â¢ for, a hunchback
younger sister. Nora was a quiet, pale,
weakly little creature, sorrowfully striv
ing not to recognize the world her de
pendence upon' Bessie made her encoun
ter; loving â¢> the sister whose 'only virtue,
perhaps, was that she loved Nora; hoping
and praying that their* life, might be
changed for the "better; helping all that
her poor strength permitted In the duties
of. the 'pitiful- "home." When- Bessie was
at work Nora prepared Harry's basket
and started him on his night's round, and
called him "Brother Harry. '' .
VIâ LULLING A CONSCIENCE.
Dr. Paxton' had been \ as proud of his
motherless children as he was \ fond of
them. He would have liked to see Howard
enter his profession, but when the young
man was graduated from the high school
and asked to be allowed to try > out In
practice his* fancy for writlngthe doctor
gave his consent. Howard succeeded so
well in newspaper work that, even before
his father's death, he was -doing occa
sional editorial work, which was received
with so much favor it promised to ad
vance him to an editorial chairâ the goal
of his ambition. Grace, too, had her suc
cess, of which her father and Howard
were vastly proud. She was a student of
decorative designing and had already sold
a design for a menu card at a price which,
she boasted, paid for. all the postage re
quired to send It to the various printers
who had declined with thanks. v '
It was weeks after his father's death
before Howard could give any attention to
the business affairs which the lawyer had
In charge. Then it was but to understand
that the property, after all affairs were
settled, consisted only of the family resi
dence, upon which was the mortgage of
five thousand dollars. The lawyer was
eager to learn for whatpurpose Dr. Pax
ton. had obtained so large a sum on the
day of his death, but Howard could give
him no help In his inquiries. Police in
.vestigation of the matter resulted only In
the conclusion that the doctor's body had
been robbed of the large sum, and all
public interest in the subject ceased
abruptly in the general excitement caused
by the news of the awful railroad wreck/
In which, with a half hundred othersf,
Harry Lawton was supposed to have met
death. '
Engrossed In the first sharpness of their
grief and absorbed In the adjustment of
their lives to their^ new conditions, the
matter of- the mortgage and the ' money
obtained upon it passed from the conjec
ture of Grace and Howard nearly as
wholly as from the public mind. . In the:
following year Howard was advanced to
the promised editorial position, and soon
thereafter a department of paragraphs
and short verses appeared In the White
River Advocate which attracted more
than local attentionâ was copied from
even by the, great New York dailies.
These Howard carried home for Grace to
see â his. -work looked so much more im
portant there than In the columns of the
Advocate. Among those who congratu
lated Howard on his success was Isaac
Bunton. â¢ ''And always remember, How
ard," he said, "that if you want advice
or* help â in j any business " matter â you
must let me know." . Â«
Â¦'.^Thank^ you,"^ Howard "answered, "I
know that! can call on you, my father's
friend; -for; advice, -and > shall do so if
there's, any occasion."
He thought afterward that he might
have asked Mr. Bunton if he could sug
gest what business had caused his father
to give the mortgage; but restrained by
an aversion from opening a discussion
that was as painful, still as it seemed
futile, â¢ he . never made such Inquiries of
the merchant."
It was a subject, however, which was
much in Mr. Bunton's mind. When he
returned home, after passing a day at
the farm on his way back from the
wreck, the bank demanded more security
for the loan on his pig Iron purchase. An
additional $5000 was called for, as the
price of pig-iron had declined half a dol
lar, a ton.. Bunton went to the bank ner
vous and angry. "You know," he said,
"that It's not convenient for me to put
up any more Just now. But let me tell
you this: if you folks aren't disposed to
treat me fairly I'll go elsewhere.- A Pitts
burg bank will take ,eare of my account
and make me a further advance. You
know the one I meanâ the one that's go-
Ing to open a branch here."
This threat had its effect, and the presi
dent conciliated. "We don't want to in
convenience you, . Mj. Bunton," he said.
"We supposed that you could easily bor
row five thousand more from your fa
ther."
Bunton stared. It flashed upon him
that the banker took it for granted that
the five thousand dollars Farmer Bunton
drew from the bank was to loan to his
son, Isaac Bunton. "The bank does not
know that I got the money from Doc
Paxton," Bunton thought. "No one
knows!"
The hoom in Iron came, as he predicted,
and Isaac Bunton profited largely. After
closing this, his first . Important specula
tion, he determined to go to Howard
Paxton and offer to repurchase the min
ing land, with an explanation of how the
deed belonging to his father's estate was
destroyed In the wreck, with the faithless
messenger, Harry Lawton. But this plan
was postponed by another opportunity to
use all the capital he could command.
Next year's demand for Iron ore would
be great, and lake freights would be high.
Bunton went Into the speculation boldly,
again using all the money he had, or that
the bank would lend: and freight rates
rose from day to day. His operations at
tracted- the attention of some of the great
men in the Iron trade. It was one of these
who sent for him, and said, "Bunton,
what are you going to do with all these
freight charters?" -
"Sell 'em to you, when navigation opens
In the spring," answered the merchant
boldly.
. . "1 dare say we. shall be . after them."
the dealer replied. "We didn't know but
that some one was - going to open up
that mining land of yours. Oh!" he
added with a smile, as Bunton started,
"that's the game, eh? 1 I made a good
guess. Well, there's iron on ill Rides of
your land. It should be opened up. Have
you formed your company yet?"
The merchant laughed the matter aside.
Some months later the same man again
sent for him and said abruptly, "What do
you want for that Iron land of yours?"
"It's not for sale."
"Oh, come! You bought it for a songâ
we've looked that upâ and' you've not sold
it, nor organized a company to develop It.
That we know so much shows you how
interested we are in the matter. Now
name a price at which you'll let us have
it, or a control of it." j
"It's not /for sale," the merchant re-
plied, as before.
. ."Why, .^Bunton, > this " Isn't - business.
"We'll give you $25,000 for the land."
"I repeatâ the land Isn't for sale at any
price." #
"You are getting to be a pretty hard
bargainer. Wlil you name a price?" -
"No."
"Fifty thousand?"
"No." ',
The Iron man was flushed and eager,
but the merchant -was very quiet â though
unusually pale. The former walked up
and down the floor a number of. times be
fore he paused, and said: "I take it for
granted that you've had a hint of our
plans. I don't blame you for acting on
that. We want that land. I'll tell you
exactly how much we want it. This is
final. We'll give you $100,000 for a good
and clear title. to that land!"
The phrase, "good and clear title." was
used unconsciously, or with no other pur
pose than to give sonorous' emphasis to
the offer, but at the words Bunton started'
and his pale face flushed. "The matter
can be closed up in an' hour," the Iron
man continued, reading supposed, success
In' the other's face. "We've had the title
searched, and. your signature Is all that
we want now."
â¢'The property is not for sale," Bun
ton said; and added a little huskily, "at
least not now.'.'
After, this Interview Bunton determined
to inform Howard at once of his business
transaction with Dr. Paxton. He was
'troubled when he came to consider "what
explanation he. should make to Howard,
but he felt that no more excuse would-be
needed than the truthful one that he had
sent the deed to the doctor by Harry
Lawton. who had failed to deliver It.
Howard, enriched within a year of his
father's death, would not be inclined- to
ask\any particulars of the affair which
the man who had Induced his father to
make the lucky Investment did not ven
ture to 'give. But there was. another
thing which caused Bunton uneasinessâ
the fact that he had allowed the bank to,
suppose that the five thousand he had
obtained from the doctor 'had come from
his father. He felt bitterly toward the
bank". It was its niggard policy that
made it necessary for him to part with
the land, which was now worth a for
tune. And, too, it was its stupid assump
tion as to the source of the $3000 that had
first prompted him to delay. a settlement
with the heirs when he went Into . the
freight charter speculations. Well, there
was but one thing for him to do nowâ
make a transfer to the heirs of the land,
for, of course. It would be dishonest to
offer a return of the purchase price, even
I though Howard was ignorant of the
s wonderfully advanced value of the land/
But Howard was not Ignorant; nor was
any one else in the town, for the fact
that Isaac' Bunton had refused a very
large sum for some Michigan iron land
was a news item in the papers. Bunton
was congratulated when he went to the
bank, and before he could deny his own
ership he realized that he was in unu
sually good standing there; that" a re
quest he expected a reduction of his over
draft at the bank was not made. This
was fortunate; It permitted him to under
take, another enterprise of profit which
he feared he would have to abandon. So
he concluded to defer his business with
Howard, who would not suffer by the de
lay.
Time and again that settlement was
put off. Bunton rapidly, became an op
erator of note In iron and coal. Ills
knowledge of the market was keen, his
Judgment sound and hla movements bold.
Soon there j arose frequent occasions for
.visits to New York, for his affairs had
j become profitably Involved with iron men
* of national importance.' One of these said
to him once: "Bunton, lhat mining land
of yours, if things keep on developing at
their present rate, will be the key to a
deal in Iron that's going to be. the big
gest Industrial the world has ever, known.
You were a lucky man to get an Inkling

. - VII-OFP.TO NEW YORK.
Daisy Bunton Lawton was not one to
spare or govern her emotions. Her grief
and rage possessed her In quickly suc
ceeding, passionate outbursts, which her'
mother - and grandfather could not con
trol. When her father returned to the
farm, a few hours after his telegram tell
ing of the death of Harry, she refused
to see him, passionately exclaiming that
he wan the cruel cause of the death of
her husband. She became ill, and the
country doctor advised that she should '
be taken South for the winter. This ad
vice was readily adopted because Daisy
declared that, she would not yet see her
father.
' While his wife and child were In the
Bouth Isaac Bunton rented and prepared
for them a new home, a larger house in
the pretentious' part of town, the district
known as the Heights. The older and
richer families of White River, with
whom the Buntons bad had but little so
cial relation, congratulated him upon this
move. He heard expressions of satisfac
tion that they were to have the pleasure
of adding the ladles of his family to their
social circle. Knowledge of his financial
success was not confined to distant cities;
he was a prophet not without renown In
his own country, and his countrymen re
joiced In his prosperityâ likewise his coun
trywomenT
With newly enlightened views of his .
daughter's character, Isaac made much.
In his letters to his wife, of these cor
dial expressions on the part- of the aris
tocracy of White River; and his device
was not without results. Daisy noticed,
with a cynical enjoyment, the promised
social conquest of the Heights, and late
In the winter suddenly announced to her
mother that she would like to return
home and see what her father had really
done for her comfort and pleasure.
- The Heights experienced â¢ a . sensation
that winter. The Buntons entertained on
a scale, that was dazzling; parties boldly
given for the sole purpose of dancing, not
with that dissipation as a scarcely
acknowledged indulgence, and with pro
fessional musicians to play for the danc
ers; dinners, at which Daisy and her
mother appeared at their own table in
costumes theretofore known in White
River only through the Illustration of
fashionable events in the great cities; af
ternoon teas, where the ladles who
brought their sewinc found that they
Â¦were awkwardly overburdened. Daisy
was. the moving, spirit In these social in
novationsârevolutionsâand laughed at the
fears of her mother that the Heights
would be scandalized.
"Not while every one Is saying that papa
is sure to be. the richest man. in town,"
Daisy replied with a light laugh. "A year
ago we were glad to be invited by the
poorest people on the Heights; now the
richest are glad to be invited by us. It's
the only thing that amuses meâ to see
them make fools of themselves over me
because I am an heiress! I like to see
them toady, and laugh In their faces. It's
good fun.'.'
Had the only thing that amused Daisy
been . even more extravagant and" uncon
ventional. Judged by White River stand
ards. Mrs. Bunton would have offered no
protest, for the haunting fear of her days
and nights was a return of that awful
mood In which her daughter had shaken
their, hearts In the first days of her
widowhood. There were yet days when
she . would see neither her father nor
mother; when a passion of tears and la
mentations for her lost love would pros
trate her by their fury. Toward her
father her attitude of cool Indifference
never changed. Toward all other she was
capricious.
One of Daisy's caprices was directed
against the Paxtons; with unaccountable
obstinacy, unless it was that her pride
had been offended by the attention of one
John Worthlngton Jr. of New York, paid
to Grace Paxton. For a time after their
return from the South Daisy and her
mother saw much of Grace, on the old.
simple/terms of former years; for Grace's
mourning kept her from participating In
the Bun tons' newly Inaugurated gran
deur. But there came an abrupt end to
all visits between them. Refusing her
mother's request to call on the Paxtons
one evening In the old homely manner.
Daisy added. "And I don't see why we
should have Grace and Howard here any
more."
"Daisy I" her mother cried In dismay.
"Well, why?" the girl Insisted. "Even
when they're out j of mourning they'll
not entertain us as we entertain. Let
them come under the rule of our life here
âsocial entertainment Is an even ex
change."
"But the Paxtonsâ our oldest friends!"
pleaded the mother.
"Daisy's right." Interposed Mr. Bunton,
emphatically. "I don't see anything
Howard's ever done to make him worth
while."
Datsy had ' made her objection In a
capriceâ in pique, at mostâ but her father
epoke to plainly from deep prejudice that
the girl glanced at him curiously. She
would have changed her mind, perhaps,
and championed Grace and Howard had
not her father added, with a flash of an
ger even she did not care further to
arouse, "I'm tired of this silly praise you
hear all over town of young Paxton's
scribbling. I never want to see him here
again."
During the second year after his
father's- death Howard Paxton's success
as a writer assumed flattering propor
tions. The short articles and verses In
his signed department were more and
more copied, and paragraphs occasionally
appeared in the press concerning the
"White River Advocate man," as he was
usually called in such gossip. In the
White River Club, of which Grace Insist
ed he should become a member, as other
wise he would gradually cease to know
any one but her, he was always Intro
duced to strangers In that manner, to bis
great embarrassment.
. "It's an awful grind, Grace." he would
say to her, "to be pointed out as a town
curiosity and have every man you meet
look at you In a way that shows you he
is waiting for you to say something a la
'White River Advocate man.' "
"Just wait until I'm famous," cried
Grace. "Then you'll see a proper
haughty manner. When I've decorated
the Interior of & town hall or an opera,
house you'll not see me turning the roots
of my hafr red with blushes, the way you
do when any one speaks to you."
"I couldn't stand It at all If it wasn't
that when people meet me that way I al
ways think I'm some one else. When a
man says to me, 'I've enjoyed reading
your column so much, Mr. Paxton. I hopo

New .Yorker, who's. a brick."
-"What's the name of your brick?"
. "Worthlngton."
"First name, please." said Grace, gasp

Grace pretended to faint, sha mur

Howard. "I tell you he's as simple a

"Do you suppoe* there are two Joha

Howard began to look frightened.
"Now, Grace, don't you go and scold
me," he said humbly. **Tve went and

"Not at alL An 'awfully civil' man

Grace, looking at her brother furtively.

"See Broadway, and Fifth avenue, and

eagerly.
"Ob, if I told you you'd be as wise as
I am," Howard said; but In such a way
that his sister's heart beat fast, for their
possible migration to the big city was a
dream she sometimes dared to hope might
come true.

3The Hudson became another river, the
Palisades on the farther side became a
low. .wooded shore. The breeze which
came from the river seemed heavy with
scent of magnolia. The roan who paced
slowly up and down the piazza was young
again.
At his side there seemed to walk a wom
an, as beautiful and as young as the girl
who had Just left him. But ' the beauty
of this woman was of the South, and her
dress was of the fashion of forty years
ago. The measure of forgetfulness which
time had . granted the man slipped away,
and the, old keen heartache woke once
again to poignant life.
And the man, walking with memories
and ghosts in the pure, calm moonlight,
thanked God that the' heartache was alive
once more.
The girl stepped in through one of the
open windows and the man lit a cigar.
Perhaps it was the moonlight on the
water, perhaps it was the old waltz tune
which floated out of the windows of the
house, perhaps the old memories were
brought up so keenly by the story he had
told the girl on the piazza. Whatever the
cause, the effect was. to carry the mind
of the man back to another time" and an
other scene.
"I meant to have told you this even
ing,", eaid the girl. "Jack says you were
bo good about getting, him appointed to
the academy that we have both felt
grateful to you. But we neither of us

nel, with a little dry laugh. "I am always

the woman he loved was dead. Her
mother told him that It had been said
In the Village that he was Killed at Get

heard of him afterward the girl had died
of a broken heart.
"Memory of the woman he had loved
did not leave him. ' The 'man himself, in
his bitterest moments, never wished for
that.
"The man, as the old memories became
dulled after many years, began to wonder
if it was best for him to always live a soli

he was not in love with a beautiful young
girl whom he ' knew and * then j resolved to

The girl was looking with tear-dimmed
"This story begin in the same way, Miss
Edith. 'Once upon a time,' nearly forty
years ago, a young man was very much
in love with a very beautiful woman. The
two lived in a little Southern village on
the Mississippi River, and had been play
mates through childhood. It was an un
derstood thing between the families of the
two that the boy and girl should be mar

"One day a foolish little quarrel came up
between the two young people, and tt was
not made: up as soon as it, should have

any rate he was heartily sorry afterward
that he did not say he was wrong and
make peace In that way.
"Before the Quarrel wu made up, the
Civil War broke out, and the young man

The Boy. generally referred to by the

his uncle's estimate. In reality he could
not have told you, whether he was eating
chicken or ham sandwich, his mind being
absorbed by thoughts of momentous Im

"You're not eating." growled bis uncle.
"You've got something on your mindâ or
what you call youi\mlnd," he added with
the charming frankness of near rela
tives.
"Helen Vanderveer." blurted the Boy,
his nervousness in this crisis scattering
his diplomacy to the winds.
Uncle James laid down his fork as
hastily as though the tender pullet had
been a setting hen.
"Helen Vanderveer!" he shouted. "Are
you going to marry Into that set of tail

"You're foolish." said the lady, and
moved away.
After the last carriage had rolled away,
another was driven up and the bracelets
worn by the short-haired, hard-Jawed
man, so unceremoniously bundled in, were
not Justina-'s.
No one had seen that heavy, paralyzing
heart blow, nor heard the gasp as the vic
tim sank to hts knees. Some looked back
and shook their heads, unknowingly, to
see good old Dan tenderly supporting the
sufferer, while he called genially across
the hall to the detective, talking to Mr.
Macomber.
"Bracelets'."
The crowd began to thin with Dan's
rapid dispositions. A heavy-set man,
with his overcoat collar high turned to
his ears, pressed close upon the heels of
the Drayton party. There was a sudden
stoppage. Dan's watchful eye narrowed
sharply. The old servant's hand stola
cautiously up the back of the overcoat
beside him to touch the hair and lift It
slightly with an unfelt finger.
"Wig!" he growled to himself, "and
cropped. Byâ"
"Right along," sounded his pleasant
call, and with the movement his foot
went out. The gentleman beside him
stumbled and clicked his teeth with an
exclamation.
"Beg pardon!" said the butler, and
caught him gently around the body, but
with hands that ran searchingly and
pressed on curious hard knobs.
"Go on, please," entreated Dan calmly,
dropping his right arm and slipping to
the left and forward. "Not hurt, sir, I
hope."
A mumbled "No," with a shake of the
lowered head.
"Do move out." cried the butler more
loudly. "Sorry to seem to hurry yon, but
I want room for this gentleman. He's

She who a half hour ago was Justlna
Macomber, now to be known as Mrs. Al
mon Hartwell, stood, bright-eyed and
smiling, by her husband's side. Her hand
ached from many fervent grasps, her
round cheeks blushed from many kisses,
welcome and otherwise. She longed for
the moment when escape would be hers,
and with Almon's arm about her, they
might hear the shutting of another car
riage door, and speed away upon life's
happy Journey.
The man at the door was still busy, al
though that lull had come between gen
eral arrival and departure. At first his
broad, clean-shaven face had borne a grin
of polite welcome. Now it was grave and
worried, and he glanced frequently over
his shoulder to scan the throng crowding
the rooms behind.
Many knew the old family Indoor man,
and nodded at him familiarly, wondering
at his perturbed look. Then his mistress
came ud.
(Copyright, 1903, by T. C. McClure.)
."Why," confessed Miss Vanderveer
laughing and yet blushing a little, "I owe
it all to a sharp tongued old woman on
Hester street. Some of us were down
there slumming, and I carried an arm
ful of flowers. I offered her a rose and
what do you think she did with it?"
"Wore it next her heart forever more!"
said the Boy promptly.
"Not she! She threw it In the dirty
grate, and with arms akimbo delivered
an address: 'I've hearn about you rich
folks,' quoth she, 'how you come nosln'
'round poor folks* rooms, puffing your
selves up that you are teachin' us some
thin'! Teach, indeed! When you know
enough to till a workman's pail with a
decent dinner then, I'll hear to your llower
missions an' your. religions!' -*Â¦ "
"We got out of there promptly. The
others said they were simply paralyzed by
her Impudenee-^but her words stuck in
my head; I determined to show that old
woman somethingâ and I did. Afterward,
when I found out from you that your uncle
was an economical gourmet, I saw reason
to bless my secret lessons at the cooking
school. J I .am supposed," she added,
laughing, "to be with the De Peystera In
Philadelphia !" x
The Boy dropped the dishmop and
folded her In an ecstatic embrace, from
Which they were . finally aroused by a
sharp voice at the pantry door:
. ''Turn off that water, will you!"
The Boy leaped to the faucet, for the
forgotten dishwater in. tie sink was pour
ing over the edge, sputtering greasily
everywhere. But the gourmet apparently
did not mind.
"You seem to have come to a good
understanding!" he said dryly.
UNCLE JAMES' GREAT VICTORY
By Clinton Dangerfield.
"There was but onÂ© letter In the drawer.**
"You know more about that than I
do," she returned, pointedly. "I wish you
would sit down." Chalmers sat down. "1
have wished to sp t eak with you about this
matter â with your permission."
Chalmers wished she^ would not be so
cursedly courteous.
"It Is but natural that a man should
be demonstrative toward his own son,"
she begaJi. "I have thought you * re

Is true I do not wish It any more; It is
unfair to the bov"â
"Now I beg of you," began Chalmers.
Â¦ â "to be more kind to him? I fear I
am not very thoughtful of him; I mean
to be."
"You are." he- said. "Why did you
take charge of him? -Because you hated
me utterly?"
"I did not hate you. Perhaps," she said
slowly, "perhaps I did it because of the
love I once bore his father."
"I never told you I was his father."
"You brought him to this house to live
âif I would keep hir*."
"Might not that have been the impuls

"Why," she Bald with deliberation,
"men do make fools of themselves occa

"Why not I. then?"
"I asked you whose child he was andâ"
"When I had no ready answer you as

"You never denied it"
"My God! I can't!" cried Chalmers, ris

"That Is something to your credit," she
Chalmers, with eagerness In pose and

"I dine at home to-nightâ If you mean
that." she replied.
"Yes; and will you await dinner here?
"'As well bere as elsewhere." she ac
quiesced. Chalmers had a courtly way.
He motioned toward a chair near the lire,
and Mrs. Chalmers caught her breath, as
she alv.nys did when she observed in him
that tone and manner. She hoped Chal
mers' mind was on something else.
"Well, sir?" 6aid Chalmers, looking
over her head at Norman.
The boy had been standing quite apart,
watching them wistfully. When Chal
mers spoke he started.
"You want something?" asked Mrs.
Chalmers, looking coldly at him.
"I " he hesitated.
"Speak up." said Chalmers testily.
"I wondered ifâ to-night you would
mind If I had my dinner with youâ or
with the housekeeper: if you had rather
not " he continued hurriedly.
"Why with usâ or the housekeeper "
"The music and the gold braid andâ
every one so gay and "
Chalmers looked stoically at the fire,
but he felt very pitiful.
"You mean that you are lonesome?"
queried Mrs. Chalmers.
"Yes."
"You may dine withâ us," she returned,
shortly, and looked back at the fire, as
Chalmers had.
"Thank you," said \he boy.
"Er-wait herer-till dinner is served."
She indicated a cushion at her feet.
"I am going to the country to-morrow,"
said Chalmers stiffly. "I'll take you with
me if you choose. You can have a look at
the dogs â If you choose." .
"Thank you. sir." And at that moment
the music floated In from the street.
Norman began, boylike, to drum with his
fingers.
"That's fine!" he said. with, an uncon
scious enthusiasm. "Was my father a
hero?" Chalmers and his wife looked at
each other and then, contemptuously, at
the little boy. When his wife looked at
him Chalmers reddened and turned about.
"Xorman." he said, "if it will not dis
appoint you too much, will you dine with
us some other night?"
"Yea, Blr." And Norman rose.
"And. my boy. that trip to the country
to-morrowâ I shall be delighted to. have
you go."
"Thank you." Norman said again, with
a deprecatory smile.
"Norman." called Mrs. Chalmers, "since
Mr. Chalmers prefers that you do not
dine with us, 1 will tell you stories, here,
after you have had your tea â if â if â¢ you
wish It."
He wished it and left the room.
Man and wife were silent for a moment,
then Chalmers spoke.
"You did not mind that I dismissed him,
did you?"
"Why should 1 mind?"
"I will try and make It up to him to
morrow."
"And Iâ after dinner."
"Perhaps we have notâ considered the
boy enough."
"Perhaas I have not" â
"Oh. yes you have. I was thinking of
my own remissness."
"My father," ehe repeated. Then Mrs.
Chalmers seemed to assemble her wits.
"My fatherâ who loved you as his own
son, whoso memory great men celebrated
to-d'ay: my father, who loved my mother
and her children next to honor! A. hero
"For the last time," she said, hurriedly
and under her breath, "who Is bis

"I said Itâ might be any one: it might

would never have said It.
them both.
"Don't speak, don't speak," Chalmers
cried. He was holding out bis arms.
"What shall la do?" she murmured,
twisting her fingers and looking at Chal
mers' open arms and remembering the
feel of them about her in the old days.
"What ahall I do?" And then Norman
laughed. Just without the. library door.
They started as the same shaft struck
"There Is no doubt," she said, staring
at him. She hoped for something:, she
didn't know what.
"Let us be reconciled. When I be
lieved vou hated me I had no power to
plead, but now for God's sake, Dorothy"â
â¢ "I-I-"
"I told you you couldn't. Do you not

existence forever separated you from me,
I wanted you should have some compen
sation ?"
Chalmers grew excited and stammered
as ha spoke. "You did it for love of
me, because I 'seemed' to regret. You
cannot call It 'seeming* when every throb
of mv heart was for you."
"It throbbed for anotherâ there's the
boy you know.'*
"What satisfaction could I feel in the
dally presence of this wretched child?"
"None, perhaps. But I may be forgiven
for thinking that you still have left some
remnant of honorable and gentle feeling.

"You took the child in for love of me.

Bay It. Dorothy, say It!"
"For the love I had feltâ"
"Love cannot die In an hour. You bad
been my wife less than two yearsâ"
"And that boy was less than a year
old. I essure you. love can die in a min
ute under favorable circumstances."
"Suppose I were to tell you this boy Is
not mine?"
She started forward In her chair. If
love dies quickly the habit of hope dots
not. "Suppose I were to ask you. 'Whose
cblld 1st he?* " she answered hoarsely.
"Why. It might be â any one's."
"Norman once told me that a little boy
'might eat a bear,' " she replied. Mrs.
Chalmers was articulating with difficulty.
This was to be a Waterlooâ for somebody
on Narjoleon's side.
; "Dorothy, In Heaven's name â you love
me to-day as you did In that first year
of our married life. It is true, Dorothy, I
did ''not dare dream of that before, but
now I know It. I cannot let this hour
pass â give me one chanceâ the benefit of
the doubt. Oh, Dorothy!"
answered, crimping the hem of her gown.
"Since vou decided that the boy was
mine, why did you have him here 7"
"That," she said slowly, "Is one of those
things a man is constitutionally unable
to understand."
"Try to make me understand."
"Well, your eon must have my care,

"But I can't understand."

And he lay down apain upon his back,
with one foot cocked over his knee, his

"It's Mr. Chalmers' key." said Norman,
still In the curtains. "It belongs to the

THE HUSBAND
AND THE BOY"Oh. now don't try to soften the truth,"
she interrupted quickly. "I'm after facts
and I am not going to lay anything you
may say up against you."
"I haven't the least idea what it is
about, but I am glad that there is going
to be no animosity," Mowbray observed
politely. Then he settled himself to
listen. It was one of his virtues that he
never missed his cue.
Her r.cxt words came out rather ab
ruptly.
"I'm not especially plain, do you
think?"
Her tone was deprecating, but she
turned her face toward him In a man
ner as impersonal as if she were calling
his attention to the landscape. Then she
continued impartially:
"That is, I suppose I would be classed
as 'fair to middling?' "
He nodded assent with a gleam of mis
chief in his eye.
"To tell you the truth"â her tone had
dropped Into the personal, confidential
keyâ "I'm not at all conceited about my
looks, but I've always flattered myself
that I am rather Interesting?"
"Rather Interesting, I think we may
say," he agreed suavely.
"And I'm sure I'm affectionate and
fairly good tempered andâ andâ ".
Mowbray encouraged her by a nod.
"And domestic"
"I shall have to take your word for
that."
"Well, I am domestic I know I am!
So I want you to explain to me"â her
voice was growing tumultuous â "but first
promise on your honor that you'll never
tell how it is that I've reached the age
of 33 without ever baying had a pro

Mowbray threw himself back and roar
ed, while her arms came down off the
bench and she dropped her face upon her
hands and sat looking at him with the
puzzled air of a pupil at the feet of a
master.
"When you've done laughing," she be
gan with dignity.
"Pardon dear, a thousand pardons!"
He had never called her that before
and there was something in his voice
which bespoke a new hope and confidence,
but she was too engrossed In her pursuit
of self-knowledge to notice.
''I forgot to say that I'm sensible. Men
always like that, you know. Anyway,
they pretend to."
She finished in a way that suggested
that she had her doubt of their sincerity.
With a mighty effort her companion
swallowed his mirth and prepared to face
the situation with her.
"Is it because you haven't wanted any
one to ask you?" he Inquired diplomati
cally.
"No, Indeed!"
"And no man has evex told you that he
The ejaculation was full of enlighten
ment. Mowbray was beginning at last to
understand things that had always puz
zled him, as his next question showed.
"Would it be impertinfent to ask how
you have received these declarations?"
"Why, I Just listened! You see. It's
embarrassing. It makes one feel so ter
ribly conscious."
"What about the man?" Mowbray
asked quietly. "Doesn't it occur to you
that perhaps he might need a little en
couragementâthat perhaps he might 'be

For a moment there was silence be
tween them. The point of view was ut
terly new to Miss Farrar, and she was
obviously impressed by It.
"I never thought of that," she admitted
slowly. "I thought that sort of thing was
so in a man's lineâ his metier." She
laughed a bit ruefully.

But she was not to be diverted. "I am

must be a reason for this. There's Alice

heard her say that she had had nineteen

touched with awe. Then a skeptical

There was a faint suspicion of a blush
on Miss Fairar's smooth cheeks, but her
glance met Mowbray's w.th its usual un
swerving honesty.

âseveral of them! But that's not a-pro

tone. "Strange!"

The Journey had not been altogether in
vain. And while other passengers on that
train chatted gayly together, or read their
newspapers; or watched' the panorama of
forest and farmland and the twinkling
lights of villages, there was one young
man whose eyes and attention did not
wander from a photograph he held before
him.
â¢Three months later he was at one of
Mrs. Bloomer Billings' receptions. He did
might have been. Carrington knew that
no human being had been in that expanse
of sea while he was on the beach.
With almost feverish haste he ma-le a
print from the film. There was no doubt
about it. It was no freaK effect.'
The girl's face, which he had never seen
before, seemed to mock nlm in mystery.
Clad In a dainty bathing suit, she fitted
into thÂ«KDicture as if an artist hand had
posed her there, a dainty bit of indis
putably human l'fe that rounded out the
scene and perfected It. Fate had tossed
a romance into his vacation after all.
He recalled the events of the day.
Grayson and he had reached the inn just
before noon, tired by a 'tramp of a half
dozen miles from a fishing station farther
down the coast. Dinner, then a lest: the
snap shot, and the final two hours' fish

per and the train back to the city. All
this was clear enough." But how did the
mermaid creep info his camera? Car
rington stared at the laughing face In
blank perplexity. Only one point was
certain. It was the prettiest face he had
ever seen in his life.
A paper he had recently read in a scien
tific journal flashed across his mind. It
dealt with the photographic discovery of
a new light ray, invisible to the eye, but
duly recorded on the peculiarly sensitized
photographic plate.
"Nonsense!" ne promptly said. "That's
a flesh and blood girl. She has the face
of an angel, but angels don't wear bath
ing suits with all those frills."
Next day he jumped on a train and was
whisked to Berkeley Inn. He sought the
manager and showed him the picture.
"You recognize her, of course?" Car
rington asked with a careless air. '
"I should say I did." said the manager
with a smile. "That's the handsome one
of the Langford girls who werÂ» here a
month with their aunt. Went back to
town only a couple of days ago. Splen
did picture. Taken right here on the
beach, too," he added in a quizzical tone.
"I didn't know you were ncquainted."
Carrington rejected the conversational
tender. "Yes, t thfnk it's pretty good."
was all he said. But just before train
time he sought the porter and casually
asked him the destination of the Lang
ford baggage two days before.
"New York, sah," came the ready re
sponse. "Thank, you, sah."

Though their eyes drank in the beauty of
the Â»cene about themâ the gTeat stretches
of greensward, the trees and bushes that
were bursting into the tender green of the
â¢e&son as into a sort of client songâ
neither cf them was thinking of it.
Mies Farrar, indeed, was living over
ether days, inevitably brought back by
the warm breeze and the smell of grow
ing thing*â other springtimes when life
meant only the beautiful possibility of
love- And Mowbray was thinking of her
fcr.2 wondering if by any chance it would
be worth while to tell her. For in epite
cf her unquestionable attractiveness he
could not help feeling that he would

He sent a speculative glance toward
hex as she walked beside him looking

tr of a woman whose whole mind was
given to some engrossing. and persistent
thought.
"Let us sit for a while," she proposed
as they reached the top of a knoll, where,
under a solitary tree, a bench invited re

elbows p'.aced defiantly on the back of the
benchâan, attitude peculiar to her aggres
sive moods and one which Mowbray bad
learned to recognize as premonitory of an
intention to talk things out to a finish.
He wondered what It would be this time,
for he had long since dropped into his role
of mentor.
He waited patiently with eyes that
roved carelessly over the mansions on the
far elde of Fifth avenue, which in turn
Â»ent back a well-bred stare, knowing that
her feelings would soon reach the point

"Do I look to you like a person selected
by Fate to be distinguished among* wo

che demanded, turning toward him with
a directness which challenged a truthful
answer. He regarded her in a manner
Intended to convey that he was making
an expert examination.
"No." be admitted. "I can't say that
you do. That isâ" He stopped rather
yaguely.
Jack laughed good-naturedly.
"All right, old man; sail in. but hurry
up," he said.
Fivo minutes later George Carrington
had snatched his camera from the broad
hallway of the Berkeley Inn, snapped it
at the waterscape, and he and Jack
Grayaon were off on a fishing trip. It
was the last day of their vacation, spent
wandering down the const at random,
seldom two nights in tho same place.
The final day's sport over, Carrington
sped back to the city in a train, camera,
flBhing kit and grip beside him, tanned
and tired, but happy. Ho reached hia
apartments and thought of the last pic
ture of clouds and rocks and sea. He
must develop it forthwith, and he did.
"A vacation of Jolly good fun without
a romance," j he mused. "Nature, sun
shine, fresh air. a. good chum and good
fishing. | Nothing more to be desired."
The film sank in the developing fluid,
and in a few seconds the outlines- of . a
coast scene appeared. First came the
blotches of black, representing the high
lights, clouds and the crests of waves.
By an alchemy, which never ceases to be
marvelous, all the delicate gradations of
light and shade filled in .until the perfect
picture appeared.
Then occurred something which caused
Carrington to gasp in , astonishment and
almost drop the developing, tray. For
In the center of the picture, head and
shoulders visible above the crest of a
breaker, appeared the form of a young
woman, like a mermaid arising out of the
sea. There was a saucy tilt to the laugh
ing face, and the bare arms were out
stretched as a beckoning mermaid' a

Both were silent another moment. Re
sat eagerly, expectantly. Her eyes were
fixed on the floor, and as she slowly ex
tended her hand and placed the picture
In his he felt the warm touch of her fin
gertips.
"No less surprising was the picture my
sister took of me," she exclaimed ex
citedly. "The water and rocks were love
ly, but I was nowhere to be seen!"
"Now the mystery is no longer myste
rious!" laughed Carrington. "It's plain
enough. I saw another camera in the ho
tel office, but never thought until this in
stant that I might have picked tip the
wrong one. Tour sister took a picture
with mv camera and I took one with
hers." Suddenly he became silent, and.
after a moment or two stammered. "Iâ I
suppose this is your sister's property, hut
may I not keep it?"
The girl tossed her head and smiled !n
mock hesitation. She had been turning
the Picture around and around in her
hand. Then the smile and the warm blood
left her face in company and there was
an almost imperceptible tremor of the
long dark eyelashes. On the back of thÂ©
photograph she had read:
"My mermaid."
Again their eves met. but hers were
quickly withdrawn. Her hesitation was
â¢real now.
"I took a picture of the beach, but not
that one." he said slowly. "And yet that
is the one I found in my camera."
"Their eves met for an Instant, and
the girl flushed crimson. Silent and be
wildered she studied the photograph. Sud
denly she broke Into the laugh of thÂ»
waterwltch again.
"I have a picture I wonld like yoa to

He took the photograph from his pocket

unmounted print fell from her hand.

had not been idle during the autumn
months, and without being a Sherlock
Holmes he decided that he must get an
Invitation, and he did. Mrs. Billings was
a literary lady whose assemblages were
diverse and often astonishing. Artists
and writers attended them, musicians and
player folk, with a leavening of accepted
"society." They were truly heterogene
ous gatherings.
Eagerly Carrlngton scanned the room*.
A long-haired violinist had Just finished
a Beethoven sonata, Â»r.d there was much
clapping- of hands. Carrington was pre
sented to Mrs. Billings, who was sur
rounded by a bevy of pretty girls. A mo
ment of gallant conversation, and then
his face lit up with a sudden Joy that
eaused his hostess to look up in politely
suppressed wonder. In that group, now
in a setting of pink and white, but with
the same laughing face of the glistening
beach and wave, stood his Lady of the
Sea.
An hour later they sat together on Â¦

song.
ELIZABETH'S FIRST PROPOSAL
By Keith. Gordon
By Henry T^olens
CARRINGTON'5 MYSTIC MERMAID
Her cheeks were hot and her lips trem
bled.- A strong hand reached out and
took - hers in . a masterful way, and she
suddenly knew, that something which she
had never dreamedâ was true.
"But I asked you," she moaned, j when
at last she recovered her wonted serenity,
"I positively asked you!"
"You encouraged me," he corrected,
"and that's what they usually do, only
your method was brutally direct!"
It was when she began to flush again
that he added:':'! shall always have
something to tease you about, dearest!"
â¢ And the squirrel, which had been watch
ing them in the lingering hope that they
might possibly have brought him nuts,
like sensible people, gave up in disgust
and scurried away.
"I love you, Beth," he said simply, "and
I think you know the rest. Tell me that
you do!"
There was a palpable pause before M'ss
Fairr-.r replied. But at la^t her straight
forwanlmss prevailed.
"Sometimes I shake my head and look
rather shocked. Then they think that 1
Oisapprove of such conversations â think

largh and say, 'I have never had one!'
in a tone- which implies the reverse."
She finished this confession and looked
nt Mowbray out of the corner of -her eyes
in a way that drove the last vestige of
fear out of his mind. Thl3 naive woman,
the person whose dignity and coldness he
had stood aloof from in absolute, embar
rassment for so long. He could have
laughed at the absurdity of it. Â¦ Why had
she never shown him her real self before?
"I think I shall propose to you," he re
marked deliberately.
For a second she looked surprised and
then her eyes danced.
"Let It be in your best style," she plead
ed. "Remember, it's my first and I fear
it may be my last, tool"
He leaned toward he: and looked
straight into her eyes.
"It will be your lalst undoubtedly." His
voice was low and tense. For a long
moment he looked at herâ looked in a
way that first made her small ears burn
and then troubled her clear gaze, which
wavered and fell.
"What do you gay upon Â»uch occn
slons?" demanded Moworay, watching
the squine! that was again eying them
from, a distance.

.Johnny shook his Uox. remtniscently.
"The last t!me I played." he remarked,
"was with the bull bear from the Statesâ
the monster with the neck. I lost to him
âI Most a bit, I tell you." He thought of
the nugi.lst c trick he had' learned. "He
was a wonder,' that man," he said aloud.
"My son," said Pere Goultt, "he was.
That man with his two hands could throw
a buckâ perhaps a bull moose. Who
knows? You say well; he was a monster.
True."
Franco's shook his box. "You first."
said Goulet's daughter. "Each shall have
three throws, and I shall keep â what do
they say?â I shall keep tab. Your knife,
Francois." He tossed |t over" and she
held It, ready to notch the table as they
played.
"She Is mineâ she is mine!" cried
Francois.
"Aha!" yelled Francois with excite
ment, as he rolled his dice. He made a
iair throwâ a very fair one.
Gou'.et followed. "Sacre!" he ex
claimed In guttural tones. For his score
was low.
"You've got me, Francois," remarked
Johnny, as he emote his cubes upon the
tab!* ; "but no, you have not, either."
For he had done wellâ as well as man
could do. Maria, her face set to her task,
was cutting notches thick and fast.
"This time," announced Francois, "I
shall throw twice. It means luck and
avoids delay." He threw poorly at first,
but better on the -second trial. He was
exultant. It was not the first time he
had thrown, and his skill was great.
"Papa Gou".et," said he, "beat that if
you can. Give it your best twist if you
can." Goulet threw and' groaned. He, at
any rate, was a loser.
"She is mine, she is mine!" called
Francois. He smiled on Maria, and she
returned the smile. So entranced was he
by it that he did not notice the first
throw from Johnny's box until the dice
had come to a standstill. Then he
frowned.
"Vmf not so bad at this myself." said
Johnny. "Still, you can never tell."
He threw asrain. Barely had he done
so when Francois, with a mighty shout
of anger, lunped at him across the table
and nearly felled him. Johnny, with a
heightened color In his face, good na-
tnem. But now they hare sunk â I shall
never see them more."
The girl laughed. "Sunk," the exclaim
ed, "of a surety they have sunk. How
could they help it?" She drew his head
down and whispered to him. "They sank;
they could not help It. poor thlnga." She
drew a sharp breath Inward and burst
into a hysterical laugh. "They were load
edâthey were loaded diceâ of courss they
sank. Why not?"
"Loaded dice!" exclaimed Johnny.
"Surely." answered she. "The bull-bear
man â they belonged to him, when you
and others lost to himâ and he gave them
to me."
"Loaded!" exclaimed Johnny once again.
"Why, that's notâ" He stopped, for a
sudden llsht had broken In upon him.
"Loaded, and you gave them to me to
night to play the game."
"Yes," she answered breathlessly.
Johnny kissed her with vehemence.
"Then." he continued, "it was not a game
to-ntg-ht. Then I had won you long be
fore to-nizht."
She nodded. "Months, yea, years be
fore," she answered.
Johnny drew her toward him. "My little
wife." he said.
"Johnny Le Boutillier, my husband,"
answered she.
Side by nlde they plunged into the Great
North Trail.
"What has that to do with it?" retort
ed Michele. "A mother, bah! Yes. but
what is a mother? She had no old father.
Therefore, and only therefore, she mar
ried. And therefore yon should not.
Never marry- I do not expect to marry.
Come now. What's good enough for me
is good enough for you. Look at me."
Maria drove her other two admirers to
the frenzy point as well. Francois, the
jealous, the black browed, was easily
aroused and hard to appease. Thrice he
fought with Johnny Le Boutillier â fa
mous fights, too, by the light of torches,
with many men around the combatants
bared to the waist. Twice did Johnny Le
Boutillier go down and out.
At the next fight between Francois and
"There Is yet time," she Raid.
"I shall marry." she informed MlcheV,
"why not? Did not my mother mnrry"â
"Marry nothing," snapped old Michele,
losing sight of the facts in order to
prove his point. "What good young wo
man would marry and leave hÂ»r old
father? And beside*," he added, as
though making a guarded admission,
"even if she did marry, she had no old
fatherâ she had nobody but me. So we
married."
"She had a mother," insisted Maria
Goulet.
Tip there, where men are plenty and
women few and far between, the sight of
Michele's daughter came as a surprise.'
One held his breath, for she was a flower,
was Michele's daughterâ a wood flower
of the trail. She was worth while. And
there were many who understood that
and who hopelessly desired to wear this
flower some day. Most of them did not
bother Maria. She sent them off. Good
men, they were, tooâ a bit rough and
wild, good as men of the forest go.
But there were three who were very
close admirers. Each of these had sworn
to have Maria for his own. One was a
Canuck, pure and Flmple. Francois he
was, a good sort of chap, but with a tem
per. The next was an American, a man
with a French name, too. This was
Johnny Le BQUtillier. younger than
Francois and lighter In complexion. The
third admirer was" the greatest of them
all. His name was Michele Goulet. He
was Maria's father. Francois whispered
to himself that already she was his.
Johnny Le BoutUlier told her out and out
that she was his. And old Micheie Gou
let, he shook his flst and Insistedâ sacre!
âthat she didn't belong to anybody at
allâ that is, except to him. He informed
her that she cou'.d marry anybody she
chose, only .she must remain single al
ways and live with him. Francois, bah!
And Johnny Le Boutillier. bah, too!
What like were they? Oh, yes, they were
well enough in their wayâ but they were
not her kind. Maria smiledâ and on all
three.
But there is more, for there is Maria,
Michele's daughter. Another name too
often the subject cf mispronunciation.
One must cay Ave Maria beneath the
breath, and then he may know how to
cpeak of Michele's daughter. Otherwise
it were best to call herâ well. Miss Gou
let. But not now, though. That would
nrrer do, for at this time all la different.
But cne must not anticipate.
Goulet is the puide par excellence.
Across the Great North Trail he has es
corted many, many persons. The Presi
cent of the United States? Assuredly.
And many, many school teachers
throughout the long vacation. In the
printed itineraries of the railroads he Is
included, though not by name, in the list
cf "competent guides at every point." He
Is ail things to all men. He is sublime;
he Is the great Northwest. He Is Michele
Goulet. Can man say more?
This rame Gooley Is a Ctlt. Ah. of
course, to be sure. No one would think
otherwise. But he Is a different kind of
CcJt, is Gooleyâ for his name when spoken
is Mike iiooley, true enough, but when

Michele Gou.et then. A Frenchmanâ a
Frenchman to the marrow. One knows
that, finally, but only when his eye lights
upon this same Michele Gouiet- and one
Is elad. for In the lonely march through
the Great North Trail, and in the nights
around the camp fire, it is possible to lift
the voice in the midst of the great si
lenceâ to lift the voice in solemn song:â
Oh, Michele Goulet. Michele Goulet.
The greatest Man-ltcba ever knew.

She turned her back upon Johnny Le
Eoutilller. "Or Johnny Le Boutillier,"
she continued, "or Pere Goulet."
Pere Goulet growled, but Francois leap
ed to his feet.
"I am famous with the dice. he ex
claimed. "It is good. 1 asree."
"Maria Goulet." laughed Johnny Le
Boutllller, "you're a dead game sport. I
go you."
"Ah!" This from Franco'.s.
Maria had waited patiently for the re
marks to end. "I shall be fair. Franco's

has fought for me. He has won. too.

Francois leaped to his feet. "My angel!"

"Orâ I shall marry Johnny Le Boutll-

"Orâ I shall not marry. There!"

"Satisfied!" retorted Francois. "How

At length Maria spoke:
Johnny, Johnny, who had treasured a few
things up In his heart, was able, in the
language of his pugilistic friend, to "hand

but eight, nine times. Then It was John
ny's turn to stroll around. Assuredly.
But when Francois came around, after
some days, Maria did no't touch his
bruises with her finger. She laughed, and
Francois stormed.
But this could not go on forever. Fran

around his side of the barrel.
often brilliantly original.
On one especial occasion, â¢ warm after
noon late In June, when the houses and
yards were all quiet and the very dogs
lay still in the shade, the vicar led them
softly to the chicken yard, mystified them
by crawling through a broken glass
frame into the covered roost, crouching
along beneath the perches and going out
again by the legitimate door without
stopping to speak. This effectually
silenced the lieutenantâ the chicken house
seemed an old ruse to h.'m. and he was
Bnifflng in preparation for the expression
of his opinion. Out across the yard and
twice around an enormous hogshead they
walked solemnly. Such a prelude must
mean a great finale, and the head captain
felt decidedly cWlous. The vicar paused,
made a short detour for the purpose of
getting two empty boxes, piled them one
on the other, and lightly swung herself
Into the cask. A loud thud announced
her safe arrival at tho bottom, and
flushed with delight at the incomparable
secrecy of the thing the head captain
followed her. The lieutenant, grumbling
as usual, and very nearly hanging him
self In his sash, which caught on tne
edge, tumbled after, and standing close
together in the great barrel they grinned
consciously at each other.
The head captain broke the silence.
"Are we all here?" he demanded, his
voice waking strange and hollow echoes.
"Yes," replied the vicar delightedly,
bursting with pride. -
"Aye, aye!" said the lieutenant with
careful formality.
"Then listen here!" the head captain
spoke In a hoarse whisper. "Thls'll be a
dlnrrent way. This is going to be tne
real thing. Torday we're going to steal!"
The- vicar gasped. "Really steal?" she
whiskered.
"Steal what?" said the lieutenant with
a non-committal gruffness.
"Oh!" and she retired, practicing the
word. Yne others were much impressed
by her cleverness in discovering such a
fascinating title. â¢ It savored of wicked
and villain, to begin with; and. pursuing
the advantage of their previous Ignorance
of It, she Invented etvenl privileges and
perquisites of the office.
One of these was the right to sum
mon the band, when the head captain had
decided on an expedition, to any meet-
Ing place she saw fit; and, though lit a
great many ways her superiors found her
a. nuisance, the â¢ lieutenant In particular

could not but admit that her selection of

"Why, of course not, silly! There are

As for the vicarâ well, there were ob
stacles In the way of her presenting such
nn appearance as she would have liked.
In the first place there was not enough
Turkey red to po evenly round, and to
her disgust ehÂ» had been obliged to put
up with a scam three-quarters of a yard
ânot a wide Ftrip at that. What was by
courtesy called the vicar's waist was not
far from thr^e-cuarters of a yard in cir
cumference, which fact compelled her to
strain her cash tightly in order .to be able
to make even a small hard knot, to say
nothing of bows and ends. She had no
collar of any kindâ her frocks were gath
ered into bands at the neck. So the. vicar,
in a. wild attempt at masculinity, had pri
vately borrowed a hlch linen collar of
her uncle. The shirts in her uncle's
drawer had printed Inside them, "Wear a
eeventecn-and-a-half collar with this
shirt," so you will not be surprised to
learn that the vicar occasionally fell into
the collar, so to speak, and found herself
most effectually muzzled.
But the worst was her mask. Her hair
came down in a heavy bang almost to her
straight brown eyebrows; her round,
brown eyes were somewhat short sighted;
her eye-holes were too small. In conse
quence of these facts, whenever it was de
sirable or necessary to see an inch before
her nose she was obliged to push the
mask up over her bang, when It waved
straight out and up, and looked like some
high priest's mitre.
Her title was due to her uncle, who, to
do him Justice, was as Innocent of his in
fluence In the matter as of the loss of
bis collar.
"When a percent Isn't the bead of the
pirates, but Is an* officer Just the same,
and has some eay about things, what do
you call that?" she asked him abruptly
one day. He was reading at the time
and not unnaturally understood her to
My "the head of the parish."
"Why, that Is called a vicar, I suppose
jroo mean.** he answered.
"A vlcker! Does he have some say?"
(Copyright. 1903).
IT mxnt not have occurred to you to
find the head captain terrible to look
upon, had you seen him first without
fc'.s uniform. There seems to be some
thing essenOiIly paclrtc In the effect
of a broad tu:Â».-over Gingham collar, a
blue neck-ribbon and a wide straw hat.
But ccu!d you have encountered h!rtr in a
black cambric roatk with pinked edge*, a
broad sash of Turkey red wound tightly
about his waist, and that wide collar
turned up above his cars, you might have
sung another tune.
The lieutenant was distinctly less im
pressive. His sash, though not so long *%
the head captain's, was forever coming
untied and trailing behind him. and as he
often retreated rapidly he stumbled and
fell over it twice out of three times.
Moreover, he was not allowed to turn h!s
collar up except on Saturdays, and the
one bis sister had made for h!m from
wrapping paper had an exotic not to say
amateur theatrical effect that was far
from convincing. The eyeholes In his
xnask t too. were much too largeâshow
ing. Indeed, the greater part of both
cheeks, each of which was provided with
a. deep dimple. Seen in the daytime, he
was notâ to ppeak confidentiallyâ very
awesome.

"Aye,, aye, sir!"
"Go straight ahead and watch out for
us. Whistle three times If the coast Is
clear. Beware ofâ of anything you see!"
"Aye, aye. air!"
The lieutenant slunk off, a peculiar cau
tion in the slope of his shoulders and his
long, noiseless stride. He rounded the
barn and disappeared from sight. There
was a moment of suspense. Suddenly ha
appeared again, his hand raised warn
ingly.
"Sst, est!" he hissed.
Promptly they skipped behind the wood
house door. In. a moment a man's foot
steps were audible; somebody was swing
ing by the barn, whistling as he went. Ha
called out to the cook as he went by,
"Pretty hot, ain't It? Hey! I say It's
pretty hot."
He was gone. H* had absolutely no
idea of their presence. The first of the
delicious thrills had begun.
Presently three soft whistles broke the
silence. They glided out round the barn
and scaled the first fence.
"Which way, head captain?"
A dusty forefinger indicated the nelgh
"Secret way or door?"
"Secret way." :
They carried hurried glances about
them; nobody was in sight. At the corner
of- the barn the lieutenant again, per
formed scout duty, and his three whistles
brought them to 'a back entrance hardly
noticeable to the chance explorer of stable
yardsâ a low door Into a disused .cow
house.
Softly they stole in, softly peeped into ,
the barn.' It lay placid and empty,
smelling of leather and hay and horses,
with barrels of grain all about, odd bits
of harness and tins of wagon grease,
wisps of straw and broken tools scattered
over the floor. Broad bands of sunlight s
streaked everything. They crept through
a lane of barrels and mounted a rickety â¢
stair, heart in mouth. Who might be at
th$ top?-.
A moment's pause, and then the head
captain nodded.
"AH right, men," ha breathed.
They went carefully through the thick
hay that strewed the upper floor, avoid
ing the - cracks - and- pits that- loosened -
boards and decayed planking offered the
unwary foot. The perspiration dripped
from the vicar's round cheeks; she panted
with the heat

she seized it and hid It In her pocket.
Gimme another," she beared softly;
gimme that shiny little cup!"
If there had been any doubt as to the
heavenly reality of the thin*, it was all
over now. No more need the head cap
tain s swelling words fill out the barÂ© gaps
of the actual state of the case. Here
were the thlnics-this was no pretend
game. Here waa danger. here was crime,
here was glittering wealth all unguarded,
and no one knew but them!
The head captain first mastered himself.
H m, that's enoughâ from htre!" he
commanded with dreadful implication.
Come on. They'll kill us if they catch

Off in a different direction he led them,
having closed the box softly, and instead
of making for the stairs, stopped before
three square openings In the floor He lay
flat on his stomach and peered down one.
The vicar caught the idea before the
lieutenant. Light as a cat she dropped,
scrambled out of the manger and as a
step sounded in the outer barn, dragged
the lieutenant through in an agony of
apprehension, stumbled across the great
heap of stable refuse, and crouched, pal
pitating, behind the cow house door.
The head captain, whom crises calmed
and Immediate danger heartened, himself
crept back Into the stable to gather from
the sound of the steps the direction taken
by the intruder.
He was talking to thÂ« horse.
"Want some dinner? I'll bet you do.
Stealing hay. was you. That'll never do."
It was enough. Soon he would go up
stairs to count over the treasuresâ who
would ever have supposed that this sim
ple looking stableman bad known* for
years of such a trove?â and then woe to
the pirates!
"Come on, you! Run for youijllfe!" he
shot at them, and they tore across the
yard and over the back fence, and across
a vacant lot, panting, stumbling, mutter
ing to each other, the vicar crying with
excitement. The lieutenant caught his
foot. in his sash and fell miserably, mis
taking them for arms of the law, as they
loyally turned back to pick him up,' and
fighting them with feeblo punches. They
dragged him through a hedge and took
refuge In an old tool house.
Slowly they got back breath. - The de
licious horror of pursuit was lifted from
them.' It appeared that they were safe.
"You goin' hom* now?" laid the lieu
tenant huskily.
Home?. . Home? . Was the fellow mad?
The head captain vouchsafed no answer.
. "Forward, march!",,- ' â¢- :' .:
He strode out > of the tool house 'and
made for this barn. A large dog. barked
and a voice called:, /
r;"Dowh, Danny, down!"
They returned hastily and climbed la
boriously out .of a = little window on the
other side; of : the tool house, striking. a
bee-line for the adjoining property. The
treasure Jingled in .their pockets as they
ran stealthily Into this barn. The last
restraint was cast away; they were on
new territory.
It was a clean, spacious spot. Great
shadowy, white-draped carriages stood
along the sides; a smell of varnish and
new leather prevailed. On the walls hun*
fascinating garden tools; quaint-nosed
watering pots, coils of hose, a lawn foun
tain. All was still. The head captain
strode across the floor, extending his
hand with a majestic sweep. , Â¦
"All these thingsâ all of 'emâ anything
we want, we can take!" he muttered, but
not to them. Thev could plainly see he
was talking to himself. Wrapt in wild
dreams of unchecked depredation he
stamped about, fingering the garden hose,
prying behind the carriages, tossing his
head and breathing hard.
Suddenly came a step as of a man
walking on gravel. It drew nearer, near
er. For one awful moment the lieutenant
seemed in danger of thinking himself a
frighte.ned little boy in a strange barn;
he plucked at his sash nervously. The
next' instant two hands fell from oppo
site directions on his shoulders.
"Get into a carriageâ quick, quick,
quick!" hissed the head captain, and he
heard the vicar panting , as she shoved
him under the flap of the sheet that
draped a high-swung victoria.
Thump! thump! thump! went her heart,
and the lieutenant's breath whistled
through his teeth. Never in their lives
had "such straining excitement possessed
their every nerve. Oh, go on, go on, or
* . shall scream!
He sauntered by, he opened some door
at the rear. The latch al 1 but clicked,
when a hollow but unmistakable sneeze
burst from the head captain's surrey. Im
mediately the door opened again. The
man took a step back. All was deathly
still, the echoes of their " leader's fateful
sneeze alone thrilled the hearts of his an
guished followers.
"Humph!" muttered a deep voice,
"that's queer. Anybody out there?"
- Silence. Silence that buzzed and
hummed and roared in the lcar's ears.
"Queerâ I thought I heard â¢ â¢ â¢
Damn queer!" muttered the /man. The
lieutenant shuddered. That was a word
whose possibilities he hesitated to con
sider.' Piracy is bad enough, heaven
knows, but profanity is surely worse.
, Again the . latch clicked. After an art
ful pause the nose of the head captain
appeared. Inserted at an Inquiring angle
between the two sheets that draped the
surrey. " Cautiously he swung himself
down, cautiously he 'tiptoed toward the
others. -,- â¢â¢ Â¦
"Sat! sst! All safe!" he whispered.
They scrambled 'out, and a glance at his
reserved frown taught them that the re-
Cent sneeze must not be mentioned.
Like cats they crept up the stairs and
"Pshaw, no!" interrupted the head
captain. . "Not a baby thing like that! If
you dont know one. lieutenant, I'll make
"No. I'll say one," urged the lieutenant,
bajtlly. "Ill say one, captain, ru say
"What'll I say? What'll I say." he mut
tered, excitedly. "Not 'Hallow Be Thy
Name?' That's a long one."
"Now I lay " suggested the vicar
tremulously.
"Hats off, \my men." whispered the
head captain, hoarse with emotion, "and
we will say a prayer. Lieutenant," with
a noble renunciation In his expression,
"you may say the prayer!"
The lieutenant was touched and melted
from his sulky scorn.
The vicar conld not wait for any one
else's initiative, but began feverishly
pulling . up handf uls of hay and piling
them lightly over the dead pirate's boots.
The head captain covered tne man's body
with two hastily snatched armfuls, and
as the vicar's courage gave out at this
point., coolly laid a thin wisp directly over
the red face/ The pirate was buried. It
gave one a thrill to see hardly a dim out
line of his figure.
"That man." added the head captain, "Is
a dreadful bad fellow, I tell you. If he
was to catch us up here I don't knowâ I
don't know but he'd â here, come back,
lieutenant! Come back, I say!"
"If you take him off to bury h<m he'll
wake "
"Hush your noise!" interrupted the
bead captain angrily.
"He is dead." repeated the head cap
tain firmly. "Dead. I say. You shut up,
will you? And we must bury him."
The lieutenant looked sulky and chewed
the end of his sash. To be put down be
fore the vicar I It was hardly decent. And
she, in her usual and Irritating way,
grasped the situation immediately.
"We must bury him right off," she
whispered excitedly, "before that man
gets up here."
This seemed eminently probable. â¢ The
lieutenant looked alarmed. He took a
step or two on the loft floor and returned,
relieved.
"No, he ain't dead, either," he an
nounced, "he's only as ''
"This is a dead pirate. He died de
fendingâdefending his life. He will be
discovered if we leave him here."
"Aye. aye, sir."
only the head captain's great presence of
mind prevented their falling backward
down the flight, for there on tha bay be
fore them lay a man stretched at full
length, breathing heavily. His face was
a deep red in color and a strong, sweet
ish odor filled the loft. They turned about
at the head captain's gesture and waited
while he stole fearfully up and examined
the man. When he rejoined them there
was a new triumph in his eyes, a greater
exaltation In his hurried speech.
"Come here, lieutenant i" i
"Why. I suppose It is. I shouldn't w'on

too. Fortunately they found it all. Taka
that piece, Maggie, and give it to the man
when you see him."
The vicar sighed. Just then she fait,
with 'the poet, that homekeeplsg hearts
are happiest.
Some time during the hours of the next
morning, as she played quietly on th*
long piazza, she caught her mother's
voice, slightly raised to reach the cook's
ear:
The head captain and the lieutenant
threw themselves down under the pear
tree and fell Into a doze. The vicar,
grasping her treasure, stumbled up the
back stairs and took an informal nap on
the landing. It must hava been at this
time that the gold colored saucer slipped
from her hand, for when she woke on the
sofa In the upper hall it was nowhere
about.
"Who were they? "Who were they?**
the head captain repeated, scornfully.
"The idea! I gues,s you'd find out who
they were if they caught ym once!"
Tha lieutenant shot a sly glance at the
vicar. Did she know? You never could
tell. She pretended so.' She shivered at
the head captain's implication.
"Yes, sirree, I guess you'd find out
then." she assured him.
Suddenly the head captain's face fell.
â¢The treasure!" he gasped. "It's gone!"
In dismay they turned out their pock
ets. All those vessels of gold and silver
were lostâ lost in that last mad rush. All
but the shallow, gold-colored saucer in
the vicar's hand. They looked at it en
viously, but honor kept them silent. Ta
the vicar belonged the spoils.
"I don't see what good they were, any
how," began the lieutenant, morosely.
** "Good?* " mimicked the head captain,
enraged. M *OoodT " Why, didn't we
steal 'emX*
Slowly they took off their uniforms and
hid them under the back piazza. Slowly
the occasion faded Into the light of com
mon day; objects loÂ«t their mystery, the
barn and tool house Imperceptibly divest
ed themselves of all glamour. It was
only the back yard.
"My, but that was a close shave! X
thought they'd got us sure!" breathed the
head captain. .
"Wh-who wera they?" asked the lieu
tenant, round-eyed.
Gravely ha led tha way downstairs and
climbed abstractedly through tha littla
window. Something; was evidently on his
mind.
"The last time I saw that pirate," he
began.
Tha lieutenant tripped, and sat down
abruptly.
"Tlieâ the last time you saw him?" he
stammered.
"That's what I said," responded the
head captain shortly. "The last time I
saw him I didn't s'oosa I'd hava to bury
him. He'd Just got a lot of treasure and
stuff andâ Sat! Sst! For your lives!"
They scuttled off desperately. The
ground was new to them, and had It not
been for providential garbage barrels and
outhouses they could hardly have hoped
to conceal themselves from th'o man who
was raking up the yard. To avoid him
they dashed straight through his barn
and rounded a summer house without
perceiving a small tea party going on thera

sick terror and the abject amazement of

hedge, panted a doubtful moment in a

crowded dreams. On. on, on. Slip behind
that lilac clumpâ wait I Sstt Sst! Then
get along! Oh. hurry, hurry! Pick up

They dropped exhausted wider their

In England responsible positions are given to elderly men. It is con
sidered that they are safe, the v are sound, they will be inclined to do noth
ing rash. That is true enough. Thc American, however, does not want
that kind of man. He wants a man with youthful vigor, with ideas, a man
who has his way to make, not one who is content to glide from middle ace
to an elderly age by just keeping things going in a respectable, decorous way.
So young men in America are placed at the heads of departments. They
make mistakes. The employer, however, is wise enough to see the vounar
man can do something else besides make mistakes. . He forgets the occa
sional slip in recognizing merits in other directions. A young man. there
fore, feels Â¦ confidence placed in him. and he never relaxes energy in his
ardor to produce something better, more attractive, something that will lift
him up and make him worth a huge salary. â¢
The greatest of all reasons why,' in the long run, the American business
man gets ahead of John Bull is his appreciation of youth. "The American
young man is far more highly valued than is the young Englishman.. The
English youth, however, need not ccwnplain he does not receive the same
chance. He does not deserve it. The American youth has his fauIts^ â he
frequently jars on one's nerves-ybut he takes as keen an interest in his busi
ness as the English youth takes in cricket.'He is just. as eager for his firm, his
city, his country, to be on top as the English lad is for his county to be
successful at the wickets. He talks business. He has a watchful eve for im
provements. He loves the hurrvand scurry of trade. Trade is not a bore
to him. It is his life's blood. He does not grumble at his hours. He
works longer hours than the Englishman, but always with zest and deter
mination. He may be poor, but he will scrape money enough together to
give him a course at one of the universities. The universities are not ourelv
academic, like Oxford and Cambridge, for they strive after fitting a lad to
take his place as a business man.
English Appreciation of Soundness.
American Appreciation of Youth.
The Ai lerican business man makes it his duty to keep his finger on tha
pulse of popularity. He does not bring out an article to see if the public
will like it. He watches the trend of public fancy, and meets it more than
half way. Take the great department stores, such as one sees , in Chicago,
New York and St. Louis. Everything is done to cater to popular fancy.
Everything is done to make a visit to one of these stores pleasant and in
teresting. Thereis no badeerinsr of customers to buy; no attempt is made
to foist an article on a customer when something glse has been asked for.
There is no waiting, as in English drapery establishments, while packages
are wrapped up and stowed away before other packages are brought out.
The person vho sells is often a different person altbgether from the person
who wraps the packages up. "Ah," says the Englishman, "but I could not
keep a big staff to do this kind of work." Neither does the American keen>
a hig'staff. One of the most interesting things in American dry goods is the
corps of what are called "contingent girls." A contingent jrirl is one who
can sell anything. She is bright, attractive, has been in the ribbon depart
ment, the mantle department, the shoe department, the underwear depart
ment. Her knowledge is all-round. At different times in the year. 4 at dif
ferent times in the week, and even day, there are particular rushes in par
ticular departments. What the American does is to have a minimum staff,
and then uÂ«e the batch of contingent girls for whatever department the rush
may be in for the hour.- So you do not find, as in England, one depart
ment extremely busy, and the assistants of another department twiddling
their thumbs. If thc weather be sultry and summer garmcntsMemanded. the
contingent girls, or sufficient of them, are moved to that particular depart
ment. If the rush be for umbrellas and mackintoshes, because a spell of
wet weather has set in, they will be equally serviceable selling those articles.
The Watchfulness . of Americans.
now and then contracts will come back to England because of dissatisfac
tion with American material, the drift is undoubtedly toward a large recog
nition of American goods.
' It is my last wish to draw odious, comparisons. While, therefore. I
have given this instance, not favorable to the American, I candidly admit,
as one who has" traveled in thirty-four different countries, studying trade
conditions in -them* all,* that the American will always adapt himself to, the
requirements of each particular country. What is good enough for London
does, not mean that it is suitable for Calcutta. The American appreciates
that what is all right for Chicago won't do for Bombay. Whether it be elec
tric cars or whether it be cotton goods he adapts them to the particular
country and people for whom they are intended. He does not wait for
people to come to him and ask what he has to sell. He goes to them. He
convinces them that his wares are the best they can procure. British trade
in- the East â in India, in China, preponderates, mountains high,
over the meager amount of business the Americans are doing in these two
particular countries. The Americans, however, are there, and. judging from
proportionate increase in the respective volume of business, it is a fact that
the Americans are booming ahead. In Siberia I have met a dozen Ameri
cans engaged in pushing American goods, and only three Englishmenâ onÂ«
representing an American firm, another representing a French firm, and the
third in the employ of a Russian firm. Out on the wild steppes I have come
across the catalogues of American goods in the Russian language. Occa
sionally I have come across catalogues of English goods, but they have been
in English, which is about as serviceable as Chaldaic. v.: â¢ , .
Another reason the American is more successful than his English
brother is that he is more daring â I almost wrote he is more of a gambler.
The Englishman won't move unless he is sure of his footing. The Ameri
can is inclined to make a spring, neck or nothing, positive in his" heart,
though many men come croppers, that he will land safely on his feet. The
Englishman is disposed to take the attitude, "What was good enough for my
father is good enough for me." Nothing is good enough for the American,
save toxnething far better than he Has at present. He is alert and filled with
a wholesome discontent. The Englishman is slow moving, sure and safe,
end poÂ«Â«esses the belief that he is not on the earth to tear himself in pieces
for the sake of money.
This difference is the outcome of climate, environment and conditions of
society. Affairs are settled in England, and rapid changes do not commend
themselves â just as in the Eastern parts of the United States the same settle
ment is taking place, and there is now a hesitancy toward adopting the rip
and-tear and goaheadness so prevalent in the Western States. America is
young, and has all the impetuosity of youth. England is middle-aged, pros
perous, with a big banking account and disposed to take life easily.
The American business man has a faculty, which the Englishman* has
not. of keeping his best goods in his shop window. What I mean is that
all that is good in his firm, all the achievements, are advertised to the
world. A great Englis"h firm secures a contract for some great work in
some corner of the earth, and involving- millions of money. Little is said
about it in England. A three or four line paragraph may appear in 'the
newspapers. That is all. The Englishman reads the paragraph and forgets
it the next minute. In America there will be columns of interviews, illus
trations, and much talk about the irresistible advance of American / trade.
The blare of trumpets is altogether out of proportion to the triumph.
But it is useful for the American firm. It produces enthusiasm.
The Valucof Advertising R.ecognized.
The Americans know how to advertise. Large firms, such as the dry
goods stores in .New York and Chicago; give premiums for ideas. Any
thing that is good will be liberally paid for. At the head of most of the ad
vertising departments are experienced journalists drawing large salaries;
men who can present brightly and interestingly the attractions of the wares
for sale * Pick up an American magazine and read its pages of advertise
ments There you. will see art, inventiveness, candor, open dealing, the very
things which strike right to the mind of the reader. Pick up an English
magazine and look at the advertisements. Generally they will be heavy,
Â«todgy unattractive, the same month after month. I don't say the same
style of advertising is suitable for both countries. The Englishman is a
skeptic and advertisements are things he regards with a quizzical eye. The
American is more receptive. He is easier moved, and the two thingsâ good
advertising and the convincibility of the. American â argue good returns; for
the cost of advertising. ' . > _ â . ,
The adaptability of the American is a thing which all British business
men will do well to study. I have traveled in many parts of the world, and,
though British goods are to be seen in the most out of the way corners,
it is nevertheless a fact that a considerable volume of trade has been lost
*implv because the British manufacturer will not adapt himself to local cir
cumstances He is prone to say. "I make a good article, and I am not go
ing to make a bad one to suit anybody." British-made goods are the best.
For quality and endurability American articles are as yet a considerable way
behind In these days, however, of hot rivalry, quality and endurability are
not the only things to be considered. I believe that if they tried the Ameri
cans could produce equal â I will even go so far as to readily admit better â
articles than Britain turns out. The tendency, however, of the present day
in America is rather quantity than quality. If quality can be got. well and
goodâ but quantity at a cheap price is the main consideration. The Amer
ican recognizes that the purchaser is the person who decides, and if people
of the Ea*st want gaudy, good-looking material, though shoddy, he will make
it for them. He knows it is not pood. He does not â outside his advertis
ing page pretend it is. It is. however, what is wanted, and he is the man

[tfl^P-ffi.^o'ligil*;; For anybody to say of him, "He does not advertise," he
regards as a compliment.
On the other hand, the American business man is absorbed, heart and
soul, in his work. He love* to talk "shop." He loves to tell you all he
has done, and what his firm has done. This buoyancy of good spirits and
self-confidence do not induce the minimizing of anything. He has got the
exuberance of young manhood. He tells himself, and his newspapers tell
him, he is the most magnificent fellow in the world, that he invented every
thing, and that the rest of the world are played-out toddlers in his wake. Of
course he, is wrong. What the European student of American affairs finds
perplexing is the lack of proportion and perspective in appreciation of their
country's advancement by Americans themselves.
When, however, this is put aside, when all has been said about bragging,
there remains in the American character an enthusiasm, an absolute sure
ness of success which is part of the battle toward success itself. Failures in
business make the Englishman hesitate. Failures in the United States sat

"Brother Zeke," says he, "I shall certainly let your words
soak in. I want to be a number two red, hard, sound and'
clean sort of a man, and grade contract on delivery dny. (
Perhaps, as you say, the. rust has got into me and the "In-i

The Deacon knew that Brother Bill'had scraped together
considerable property, and, as he was a bachelor, itÂ»would
come to' him in case the broker-was removed by any sud-i
den dispensation. What he, really feared was* that this,
money might be fooled away in high living and specula-,

Well, one fall the Deacon decided to go to Chicago him
self to buy his winter goods, and naturally he hiked out
to Brother Bill's to stay, which was considerably cheaper
for him than the Palmer House, though, as he told us when
he got back, it made him sick to see the waste.
Well, when . Brother Bill got home, from business that
first night, the Deacon explained that every time he lit a
two-bit cigar he was depriving a Zulu of twenty-five helpful,
little tracts which might have "made a better man of him:
that fast horses were a snare and plug hats a wile of the
Enemy; that the Board of Trade was the Temple of Belial
and the brokers on it his sons and servants. . v ->
Brother Bill listened mighty patiently to him, and when
the Deacon had pumped out all the Scripture that was in
him and was beginning, to suck air, he sort of slunk into
the conversation like a setter pup that's been caught with
the feathers on his chops. $ ;,

The Deacon had a brother in Chicago whom he used to
call a sore trial. Brother Bill was a broker on the Board
of Trade, and, according to the Deacon, he was not only
engaged in a mighty sinful occupation, but he was a mighty^
poor steward of his sinful gains. Smoked two-bit cigars(
and wore a plug hat. Drank a little and cussed a Jittle arid*

"Yes." Bill went on. "and I'm ashamed of it. for you've
made me see things in a new light. Of course, after what
you've said. I know it would be an insult to offer you the
money. And. I feel now that it wouldn't be right to ;keep
it myself. I' must sleep on it aivd try to find the straight
thing to do."
I guess it really didn't interfere with Bill's sleep, but tht
Deacon sat up with the corpse of that two hundred dollars,
you bet. In the morning at breakfast he -asked Brother
Bill to explain all about this speculating business, what
made the market go tip and down, and" whqthcj real corn
or wheat or pork figured Hn- any stage of. a deal. Bill
looked fort of sad and dreamy-eyed, as" if* his conscience^
hadn't digested that two "hundred yet, but he was mighty*
obliging about '-explaining, everything to ZeJÂ»e,.; He had
changed his face for the one' which he wore ~wheh he sold
an easy customer ground -peas and chicory for O. G. Java,
and every now and then he gulped as if he was going to
start a hymn. When Bill told .him how pood and bad
weather sent the market, up and down he nodded and said
that that part of it was air right, because the weather was
of the Lord.
"Not on the Boardof Trade it isn't." Bill answered back;
"at least not to any marked^cxtent: it's from the weather
man or some liar ih'the,?Q,rq*belt. and. as the" weather man
usually reckons wrong. 1/ reckon there isn't any special in
spiration about it. The game is to guess what's going to
happen, not what has happened, and by the time the real
weather comes along everybody has guessed wrong and
knocked the market off a cent or two."
â¢That made the Deacon's chin whiskers droop a little, but
he began to ask questions again, and by and by he dis
covered that away behindâ about a hundred miles behind,
but that was close enough for the Deaconâ a deal in futures
there were real wheat and pork. Said then-' that'. he'd Jbeen
misinformed! and misled; that speculation was a legitimate
business, involving skill and sagacity: that his last scruple
was removed,. and that "he would accept the two hundred.
Bill brightened right ..up at. that and thanked him for put
ting it so clear and removing the doubts that had been
him. Said that he- ro'ulri:. srjcculate with a clear
conscience after listening to. the Deacon's able exposition
ofthe subject. , Was only sorry he. hadn't seen him to talk
it over before breakfast, as the two hundred had been fying
so-heavy on his mind all night that he'd got up early and
mailed 5 > check for/ it' to the Deacon's pastor and told him
to spend it on his poor. r

that you could, sec the town and have a good time without

The Deacon judged from Bill's expression that he had
got nipped and was going to try to unload the loss on him,
so he changed his face to- the one which he used when at
tending the funeral of any one who hadn't been a professor,
and came back quick and hard: . .. . ;
"I'm surprised,. AViljtam, that you should think I would,
accept money made. in gambling. Let this be a lesion to
you. How much did you lose?"
"Thai's the worst jof itâ I didn't lose; I made two hun

"Made two hiindrcd dollars!" echoed the Deacon, and

Tree work will not alone produce

will confer agility and lAheness. In addi

EVENINGS
will never be popular. It Is on-* thlnjr to
be well bred and stiff and another to be
well bred and cordial, and in this respect
the bachelor Is well qualified. Early in
her industrious life she learns that arms
length cordiality is by far thebest. With
the score of folks, blunt, rushing. scurry-
Ing workers frank, sincere manners never
fail to be appreciated and so she works
on the plan of winning. respec by ability,
friendship by personal worth and admira
tion by simplicity and sweetness.
One of the very best things In Miss
Bachelor's life is that money dounts but
very little. And isn't It lucky for her
that it doesn't? * ...
Â¦\Vhen she invites; guests to dine with
her, if sjie be -.wire,. 'she will study the
simple, the un'a : ffe*etcd, and let gorgeous
ness take care,'of tts'elf. .Tftere is no rea
son for her spending many pennies on
decorations and she would be more than
foolish to be much tut of pocket for ser
vants' hire, and when it -comes to squan
dering a fortune on singers, musicians
and what nots as a means of entertain
ment she has reached the very "pinnacle
of folly.* If her friends are too blase to
enjoy a jolly -llttle^ttfnner and a merry
evening afterward they had far better
stay at home. 'At least they aren't worth
.fussing and feathering over.
But one thing is certain. If Miss Bach
elor makes no' -great: pretenses, she Is
â¢bound to have-'no annoying -troubles. Of
course. If she fancies a low cut evening
frock it is perfectly proper, but at times
it is apt to look a trifle far fetched. A
simple gown, but such as the wife of the
millionaire next door might covet, is far
prettier, and lo and behold she is pre
pared to receive as dainty f rocked as tha
finest lady in the land.
And why try to add so many ejxtra
frills when It come? to. the dinner. A four
course one is ample and there* isn't the
slightest reason for feeling; as though it
looked mean and cheap. Besides, just at
AM besides, they're more cosy. Ever
so much more.soi 'There Is no dividing
off Into couples, as one may do at a large
function, but. Instead, conversation is
general, for it certainly . would bo the

The dinner, like all other dinners, must
come to an end, and It wind* up with cof
fee and fun. but the grand finale may be
Just as tlie hostess best likes. She may
rise and with two or threjj of .her girl
friends go to the drawing-room!- leaving

the may follow- the far prettler^and more

It comes right down to It, any transgres

cism isn't the most pleasant thing in tha
world and no woman enjoys it. but unless
she knows the golden rules and rigidly
adheres to thrm she will wake up sud
denly some clay and find herself utterly
beyond the pale of recognition.
JHer dinner over, the maid removes the
coffee cups and then her ladysSlp finds
It high time to exert herself to tmuM
her chosen few. While the talk should
be light It certainly never should be com
mon. Scandal, the flippant story and the
darker side of Ufa never should be
touched upon, but far better pleasant sal
lies, a witty story or a bit of clever imlr
tation.
There are simply scores of ways of can
celing obligations, snd Just because she
Is differently situated In life does not
necessarily mean that the bachelor must
owe a million debts, more or less. An
awfully easy way is to arrange a musl
cale to follow a dinner and so practically
kill two birds with one stone. A dozen

rarely fall to make a very pleasant finUn

TIME Is completely reversed for the
bachelor glrL Night Is her day. and
Â¦when she makes her hay she don't
do It by sunshine, but by the light of
the moon.
But Just the same she's exactly like any
â¢ther rtrL Instead of climbing wearily
Into her car. huddling Into a corner and
moodily thinking of a lonely dinner and
cherishing the alluring prospect of turn-
Ing In with the chickens, she sits up and
takes notice of every well-groomed wom
an about her. and at the same time plans
her evening furbelows, for it Is one of
the greatest reliefs in her busy life to
lay aside her professional garb aud put en
the pretty, fluffy house gown.
It goes without saying that the girl
bachelor is always a business girl cr a
professional woman, and one of the first
realizations that come to her Is that she
must dress herself suitably during the
day. Her work is all important then, and
she follows the inclination of her head
and not her heart. The "eternal fitness"
of things Is one of the codes of her life,
and the lives -jj> to it rigorously.
How would a young lawyer look in a
light eilk; a stager in a severe black suit;
a doctor In a sxv*-eping frock, with pretty
flying ends? Well, she wouldn't do much
of a busir.efsj=. The old saying, "clothes
don't make the man," may be true
enough, but they pretty nearly make the
woman. If a lawyer is clothed In a plain
black suit ehe looks as though she had
been in court before and as though the
law was tingling on the very ends of her
finger tips ready to be shaker, off at an
Instant's notice. Who would look twice
at a doctor rushing along with the trail
ing *kirts which fashion periodically pre
scribes? They are worn by ?hop girls and
any other girls, no matter what their occu
pation or manner of life may be, but one
fires a professional woman bent on eas
ing pain the credit of possessing enough
common sense to adopt the short skirt,
especially a* health and comfort so em
phatically demand it.
Bo the very lire t thing this Independent
girl does upon her arrival home is to
throw off her uniform of duty and let
her fancy run riot. It is her own busi
ness and decidedly no one else's what she
chooses to put on. and certainly she is
entitled to dress as daintily and as pret
tily as she pleases, not overstepping, of
course, the limit of good taste.
The world is a very harsh critic, and it
behooves every girl, particularly if she Is
alone, to have some slight regard for Its
conventionalities. She may know but lit
tle of Its rules and regulations and care
less, but ehe owes it In common justice
to herself to see that Mrs. Grundy lets
her severely alone.
Unfortunately for women, there never
has been a time, and from the looks of
things just now, never will be, when the
world will be entirely rid of scandal
mongers. Gossip, we might just as well
frankly admit, although we all hate to
like sixty, has a perennial Interest for
â¢ach and every one of us. It is all very
fine and daisy to flatter ourselves that
our interests in life are infinitely wider
than our neighbor's trifling doings, but
the fact remains Just the same thA if
we curb our tong-ues and speak no evil
we are wonders at listening to that which
f peaks no truth and works no righteous
ness.
And people do so love to take a hand
in a girls little affairs. They watch for
a time in absolute eilenre and then burst
forth wondering this and wondering that
until the innocent offender finds herself
the one absorbing topic of after-dinner
conversation. No actual harm in meant,
but nevertheless every time tale bearers
put their heads tog-ether they bave such
an astonishing array of newer and
ftronper facts that it takes but a short
time to tear a reputation to tatters. And
the trreat pity of it is that It ts all done
en the side and the girl in auestion is
penerally the last per;?on on the face of
the earth to hear or learn of the criti
cisms. "Â»"â¢'â¢*Â¦
Of course the bachelor sirl Â»>oes In so
ciety, and good rociety at that, for she
belongs to a class of her own making,
and she', above all people, knows full
Â¦well that hÂ«r mode of living and her
very independence makes it a positive
necessity to have but the very best of
friend?. "Birds of a feather flock to
gether" and she takes precious good care
to pick and choose her flock. Mme.
Grundy may not so much as iarkfn her

The ' granny muffs are lovely In their

trimming of any kind, and not decorated
by as much ' as a bunch of violets, they
are to be carried upon the arm or in the

Those women who have plain coat lin
ings of white or black or blue can make
them very lovely by a little hand embroi
dery, which can be put on with long
stitches that work easily and which give
excellent' results. Some of these stitch
eries-are very unique and show Russian
trees and queer little Russian animals.
The Russian tendency is everywhere
visible in the shape of Russian fancy
work and Russian embroidery carried
out in the dres9 designs. A sealskin coat,
one of the sort that is usually left un
adorned In Its plain beauty, was trimmed
with deep cuffs of brown panne, which
were embroidered in Russian designs ex
ecuted in green and gold. The embroidery,
though showy, is" far from difficult and
â¢b- tie executed by any woman who Is
from the very expensive fora by the Â«ye
of an expert, and there axe others that re
quire even more than the eye to tall toe
difference. --..." Â¦Â¦
And there is another kind of cheap fur
and this is not the reduced fur, but fur
which Is never expensive. There are ion*
cheap astrakans, some cheap gray fur",
some excellent and low priced black fu Â».
and these, if well made and nicely wo- 3.
are very whit as good for the woman w*.
dresses on a little a year as the more e_
pensive kinds.
la a very large fur store the other dÂ»
stood two women, both pretty, both we.
dressed, both stylish and both bearing the
stamp of ladyhood. They were looking a

One. whose attire was a little richer
than that worn by the other, was balanc
ing a muff upon her hand. It waa black,
with luster in every hair and a sheen
across it of silver. Its price was J1CC0.
"I will take it," she said.
The other woman held in her hand a
very handsome black muff, with a luster
in its texture and cut in large, alluring
shape. Its cost was $13. "It's a bar
gain," said she. "and I win take It"
The two muffs, worn with pretty gowns,
would have much the same look, though
the $18 muff will wear out long before tha
other one. But for a season or two it an
swers the purpose, and If cut In pumpkin,
in lemon, in granny or In pillow shape, it
is very smart Indeed.
The pillow muffs are- lovely, and one
feels inclined at sight to lie down upor.
them. They are very largo, very flat, and
they bear a striking resemblance to the
floral emblems upon which one reads tho
words "At Rest."
It seems a sin to suggest such a thing,
but one may sin occasionally in order
to look pretty. And what woman would
hesitate about such a small matter as
sacrilege when her cood looks are In tho
balance?
Lovely old pieces of fur, old fur coats
and muffs that have felt the finger of
time are taken and cut upâ ruthlessly
slaughteredâ into the making of finger
wide strips, which are used for the trim
ming of hats and dress skirts. Flounces
are bordered with these very " namM
strips of fur and belts are furred along
the edge. Not even the most optimistic
would suggest that these pin-wide strips
add anything to the warmth of the gar
ment, but that they add to the beauty
there is no doubt at all.
Ermine, more's the pity, la cut up and
is used upon evening bats and day hats.
It Is made Into nice little pudding bag
crowns and It is cut in pin stripes to
be mixed with chiffon bows and chiffon
paintings which are to be worn In the
winter when the snow files.
The long haired furs make nice border
ings and they give a richness to the gar
ment which you do. not always find when
the fur is short and stubby. Mink, for
this reason, does not .cut up so well into
inch-wide strips, though it does very nice
ly for bands upon skirt and for lapels for
sailor collars.
The sailor collar of fur is a thing that .
will be seen frequently. It is cut sailor J
fashion, or In Imitation of sailor fash- I
ion, sometimes with the ends squared and I
sometimes with the enÂ«a . rounded. And!
It Is cut in diamond shape with the points.? .

Â«-n >Â» HS. ARTHUR PAGET. leafier
I \/\ ct tn * Queen's set, has a new
V t I * our - ln - nand necktie.
I It is made of Persian lamb
fur and its width Is about four
ringers. It is lined with white satin and
it Is just long enough when tied to come
to the waist.
Mrs. Paget adjusts this Persian lamb
strip around her throat, over her fall
coat, ties it in four-ln-h&nd style, secures
It with a handsome boa clasp and lets
the ends hang to her belt. It gives a
pretty finish to her fall suit and sounds
the List note of the wearing of winter
fuis. '
The p^asona ire being aeverely rushed,
ox that there is little discussion; for, In
the s-.Vp windows, there are plenty of
furs and already my lady has begun to
lay in her winter supply. The first furs
are terribly expensive. But, oh, ' how
fresh tliey look, how perfect In color, bow
becoming, haw almost seductive In their
rich glossiness. It Is w%rth a few dol
lar* extra to buy furs In their season, be
fore they are shop worn and while the
gloss of the finisher Is upon them.
That It is to be a great fur season there
is no doubt at all. Furs have already
appeared in Lcndon and furs are begin
ning to tie seen everywhere. You get
glimpses of them on the occasional cold
days, when some ambitious and Impa
tient owner of a pretty boa or a collar
ette comes out with it just to give It an
airir.p. And you see furs of an evening
In the shape of the wide stoles and In
bands of fur that are lined and thrown
around the neck in boa fashion. Furs
ettm never wholly to be laid aside and
â¢ re among the things that are. worn as
late as possible and brought out as early
In the season as can possibly be mad*
convenient.
In ilie bewildering array of new furs
of: Â¦ red for inspection one notices the old
favorites made new in various ways. One
very remarkable feature in fall wear is
the manner in which furs are cut up and
n:ade into odd garments. Furs that are
aJmcst priceless are made into kimono
coats, straight front and back and with
kimono sleeve. And furs which would
have been deemed sacred in grandmoth
er s day are ruthlessly cut into strips for
the trimming of long coats.
The fur automobiles are among the de-
Eirable things, but they cost a great deal
of money and there is no such thing as
h bargain list. The fur auto coats that
come to the heels are selling for $2300 and
13UO0 and enc is fortunate to secure a good
cne at that price.
In seal coats there are some very nice
bargains, and. as seal will hold Its own
all winter, it is really as good a thing as
a woman can now buy. One of the best
Etal models is the little, tight-fitting
Jacket, snug front and back, and only hip
length. This is furnished with a very
wide rol.ing collar and with broad lapels.
The sleeves are cut Into a very large bell
shape.'. , >
A seal model which is being copied by
tl.oM- who can afford it is the three-quar
ter sea! coat, coming below the hips and
flttir.g very snugly. Its collar Is a wide
one that turns over In sailor fashion,
having the neck exposed, while Its
sleeves are coat sleeves with the full
klmor.o cuff, which Is very wide so as to
shnvi the dress sleeve.
Still another seal model is the seal auto
mobile, which is handsome enough to an
ewf-r as a dress garment and which will
be worn by those fortunate enough to
own it.
Persian lamb, baby lamb and all the
Fiagi s and ages of the Persian lamb will
be more widely the vogue than ever.
Lamb has the great advantage of fitting
the figure well without making It seem
too bulky and on this account it finds
favor with those who could not wear
mink, sable or any of the other thick
fiB'ics of fur. Lamb is also excellent as
a trimming, rating with astralcan, which
Is so ideal as a border and for the making
of a nice fur collar.
Chinchilla is still the daintiest of all fur.
trimmings and this year can be found In
very expensive grades, showing a great
variety of markings. And another fur
which is to be seen a great deal this sea
son is sable of all kinds, the Russian
article and the American, the real and
the imitation, sable that Is glossy and
priceless and sable than can be bought
for a few dollars on the fur counter.
Ermine is this season to be the fur of
ail pretty furs. It has come In with a
much greater popularity than ever be
fore and the rush for ermine will be un
precedented. Of course, this brings . up
the price and once more my lady Is called
upon to open ber purse strings to the ut
most, for ermine costs dollars where
other furs cost cents, and she who would
own a stole of ermine and ermine cuffs
and muff must be prepared to pay the
cost.

10Xaces From D. Samuels' Lace House.
$30 to $t!0 a garment and some splendid
Imitations are made that can be pur
chased for $3. and. strange as It may
Â¦cem. there are hosts of folks who
couldn't tell the difference between the
two to save their live?, although to any
one who has the faintest knowledge of
laces the difference la as plain as nisht
from day.
The emblematic effects In the Irish and
Limerick, in the genuine, are very valu
abFe and often- cost as. much as $S00 a yard.
For trimming linen surplices and linen
altar clothes point de Venise is generally
employed and is seldom used over twelve
inches in width, as it is too heavy for
greater depth. Oftentimes it is over
wrought for church purposea with gold
bullion and is then thought to be one of
the most elegant of all laces. Now and
then it is built up to give the effect of
ivory carvings and then it is about the
most expensive thing that one can pur
chase. A specimen six inches wide prot>
ably would be valued at $23 to $3) and bo
called very reasonable.
So is it any wonder that churches feel
like guarding their treasures? Trinity
Church has JCCOO worth of altar cloths
and changes. Grace has fully $3000. the
Synagogue $2500, and It is nothing Tor
Bome devout Catholic to epend from $W00
to $5000 yearly, and for single sets at that.
And, of course, some of the finest laces
in town are used in private chapels and
for private services. Mrs. Eleanor Mar
tin has some beautiful pieces for her
prledieu, as have also Mrs. Richard Tobin
and Mrs. John Parrott, but probably the
finest collection Is the property of Mrs.
Andrew Welsh. "Without a second's
thought afte gave $C0.00O to St. Ignatius
Church for Its frescoing and is always
giving freely of her bounty, as are also
a host of others.
Is scarcely a priest who can be mentioned
who does not own some individual pieces
of notable value.
The most popular surplice set is made
of'Burano thread, the product of the fam-^
ous school on the island of Burano, wheh
is under the patronage of Queen Mar-*
guerita. Generally the lace comes about
forty inches deep and costs in the neigh
borhood of $250. The point Duchesse ia
used for albs and surplices as well and
is one of the richest and most effective
that could be chosen for this purpose. The
only trouble arises from the fact that it
is very expensive, seldom coming in the
required width for less than $125 a yard,
and as a number of yards are necessary
to fashion the garment it makes them
very high priced.
Ecclesiastical designs mean a great
deal^o lacemakers, for they have learned
that T^^xpense is spared for the decora
tion of the house of God. One manufac
turer in Brussels paid the sum of $12,000
for a bit exactly two and a half inches
square and as soon as he had it in his pos
session promptly took it to pieces to find
out how it was made. The tiny scrap
was worth a great deal to him and he
was more than willing to pay the prioe.
Emanu-El Temple has an exquisite
sample of this lace which Is used on
great holidays, but it is too precious to be
displayed frequently.
Swiss laces are especially adapted for
surplices and cuffs and are not nearly as
costly. Beautiful pieces may be had Ixom
THERE are more valuable laces In
town than we wist of. In private
chapels and churches alone the
aggregate Euzn runs higher than
$150,000. and that Is but a very small
estimate, bo fancy what the total sum of
personal laces and the rare old bits that
nave been handed down from one genera
tion to another would amount to. Some
thing too immense to even dream of.
Comparatively speaking few people
fcave the least Idea what it costs to fit
tip a chancel. They fancy that .a little
linen and a scrap of lace is all that is
deemed necessary, but when they come
to settle the bill they grow a heap wiser.
Church laces are really divided into two
classes â the altar decorations and vest
ments. To be sure not all the churches
have occasion to use or display rare laces,
but the Catholic the Episcopalian and
the Jewish generally have their lockers
well filled and the more they have th*
tnore they want, for the Temple of God
cannot be too fittingly deeorated to please
them.
Bt. Ignatius Church has some wonder
fully famous specimens that are only
used on special feast days and then the
main altar is arrayed like Solomon in ail
Ms glory. St. Dominic's Church, U.e
French church, old St. Mary's and St.
Mary's Cathedral, the Spanish and the
Italian churches, Trinity and Grace Epis
copal and Emanu-El Synagogue have the
finest collections and frequently they run
Into thousands of dollars.
As a rule they consist mainly of an
tique "run" laces, both In linen and silk
lnterwTOURht with gold thread or bullion,
â¢which really was the old church idea of
the proper lace. So many gold and silver
offerings were given to the church that
the gold value was Introduced into the
laces themselves. And why shouldn't It
have been? Every thins on the altar was
of precious gold and silver, the very best
that money could buy. and the lace was
tfce one thing that failed to carry out th*
golden idea. .
Et. Dominic's Church has laces and
changes that amount to fully $M.O00. and
?vtn then* is not satisfied, and is reach
ing out and gathering In more year by
year. When one stops to consider that a
rare altar cover costs fully $2300 and the
more ordinary ones anywhere between
$500 and $1000â that is for the main altars
âand that the side ones are valued at
from JJSO to $000. It Is very easy to realize
bow rapidly they count up.
One way that ecclesiastical laces differ
from others is in the symbolic embellish
ments. Many of these expensive bits are
wrought with cross-bearing lambs,
crosses, chalices, wheat and grapes, sym
bolic of the Eucharist, while some of thÂ©
rarest ones picture kneeling saints and
madonnas. ,
Vestments figure largely in cnurchly
laces, and the private collections, which
are mainly pifts. amount to a goodly
eum. Four years Bgo, when Archbishop
Rlordar. went to Eurcpe. he placed his
laers in n *afe deposit vault for safe
keeping, but he wasn't content with that
elone. He took the trouble and expense
to bavc them Insured for $10,000, for he
knows, as well as many collectors, that
be posse fses the finest private accumula
tion of Irirh point laces that there Is in
America. His alb?, surplices and rochets
are perfect dreams of beauty, made of the
inimitable laces, the sheerest linens and
fashioned by exquisite hands.
And this co'.lection of his is perpetually
Increasing. Nearly every time he con
firms a class at the Sisters of the Holy
Famfry. at the Notre Dame Convent of
â¢t the Academy of the Sacred Heart the
sisters present him with a garment, rare
and fine, generally made by themselves.
Father Prendergast has a splendid col
leotion also, probably worth from $2500 to
$3000, the gift of his parishioners on the
occasion cl his Jubilee, and. In fact, there
THE SUISTD A Y C AXil*
WHAT IS COSTS TO FIT UP A CHANCEL.a bitter discussion with a conductor the
day before way back at the Missouri
River as to whether his boy should "pay.
fare. Instead of gracefully paying when
called on. he had abused the conductor,
who, may*be because there was a "spot
ter" sitting by, hdd felt compelled for
self-protection, to collect the half rate.
But in retaliation for the abuse the con
ductor had reported to the next conduc
tor a half fare in the Portland sleeper,
and thus started an endless chain of an
noyance that would haunt the traveler
all the way to the coast But sometimes
travelers will, study tact and forswear
abuse and its penalties.
Conductor Francis,, finishing the string
of loaded Pullmans; sat down in the
smoking-room ; of the last car with the
hind-end brakeman to straighten out his
collections. The headlight of the pusher
threw In a yellow dazzle of light on them
and the continuous cut of Its fire boomed
from the stack. Pat Francis, setting
down his lamp, began to sniff.
'.'Smell anything?" he asked presently
of his companion.
"No," answered < the brakeman, draw
ing his* head from the curtain hood un
der .which he had been looking out Into
the Â¦ storm. .
"Something here don't smell right,"
said ' Francis ; shortly, sorting his tickets.
"Where are we?" ...;..
"Getting out of the gorge."
Francis looked at his watch. "Is Jacfc

head rose strain out o~f the d\ist. He
wasn't thinking of women's- wiles as he
quietly roused the sleepers and asked for
their credentials. They were worn tired
looking womenf, haggard, a good many
of them, from catnaps snatched In the
specially devised discomfort chairs, while
their more' fortunate sisters slept peace
fully back in the hair-mattressed Pull
man berths. He was thinking solely, as
he mechanically went through the check-
Ing operation, of a cattleman in a can
vas coat, smooth face and red tie, who
should by rights be now half way down
the car. Just ahead of him. But the con
ductor Francis didn't look. His eyes never
rose byond the passenger under his nose,
for in front of a company detective the
hate, and the curiosity are all concealed;
the conductor Is strictly on drees parade
with a sting in his right arm that he
would like to land directly under the
spotter's ear.' . â¢ .
A shabby traveling manâ a cigar man
handed up a local ticket It i?as for
Antelope Gap. Pat Francis looked at it
for a minute before he punched It and
stuck it in his pocket.
* "We don't stop at Antelope Gap to
night," said he shortly. v .' :'
"Don't stop?"^echoed the cjgar , man,
wide awake in a .fraction of a second. :
"Vy, since ven7 Day tclt me you dit,"
Francis passed calmly on without at-'
tempting to controvert the confidence of
the drummer.
"Ain't yougod-do7" appealed the latter,
weakening a bit as he realized he was
against a quiet man and hard.
"Not on local transportation. Tickets!"
he continued to the, next
But the ctear man happily came of a
race that does not uncomplainingly sub
mit, and he kicked vociferously, as Pat
Francis expected he would. By the t'me
the excited salesman had woke everyr
body up in his end of the car and wprked
himself into a lather, Pat came at him
with a proposition.
â¢"Where are you going from Antelope?"
"Vild Hat." â¢ Â¦
, "What's the matter with going" up to
Wild Hat to-night and I'll give you a
train check back to Antelope on 2 to-mor

Bend?"
The injured man considered quickly, ac
cepted speedily. Two hundred miles for
nothing. "My frient! Haff a cigar, aber

ehort and snappy as a bear trap. He
could talk very differently at home to the
babiesâ but there was no suggestion of
kootsying in the tone that called for
transportation in the smoker. He passed
down the. aisle, pulling, hauling, shaking
the snorting brutes, -noting, punching,
checking under the rays of his lamp until
the last man was passed and he walked
Into the chair car. There, was only one
"go-back," a sleepy Italian who couldn't
even after he had been Jerked out of his
seat and turned upside down and inside
out, and shaken and cursedâ still he
couldn't find his ticket. So Pat Francis
passed him with the shocking intimation
which amounted to an assurance, that if
he didn't find It by the time he got back
he would throw him oft.
"Tickets!"
While the brakeman fished for a piece
of Â¦waste, the conductor moved his wet
overcoat a peg nearer the stove and
spread It out better, and listened to a
wild rumor old John Parker had picked
up about No. l's being turned Into a
strictly "limited" and carrying a "diner"
west of Bear Dance. Without wasting
any comment, Pat looked at his watclf
and listened to -the click of the truck
over the fish-plates under foot, and to
the angry, tremulous roar of the three
furnaces melting coal to, push No. 1 up
against the wind that curled like' a cork
screw down the long, narrow gorge.
Then he took the lantern from his
menial, and strode quickly through the
vestibule into the dirty light and foul
air of the smoker.
"He put up after a whileâ and you bet
that fare goes in with an embroidered re
port. Well, good luck. Patsy."
Pat Francis raised his lamp through the
fog and rain at the engineers. Jack Moore
coughed suddenly and twice with his hol
low whistle. The hind engine saluted
hoarsely; from the rear the pusher piped
Bhrill, and Bucks in the doorway watched
the panting train pull taut up the bend
in the swirling snow. And he knew as
he watched that nothing worth consider
ing would get away from Pat Francisâ
not a scheme, nor a cut-off nor a minute,
nor a revamped coupon ticket, j Pat, be
fore quitting at Benton: Pat up the gorge
and over the Horseback, was pretty sure
to catch everything inside the vestibules.
He swung up on the platform of the
baggage car as the train moved out and
shook the snow off his cap as he opened
the door. He eet his lamp on an up end
trunk, took off his overcoat and hung it
up. In tha front end of the car a pack
of hunting degs yelped a dismal chorus.
Old John Parker, the baggageman, was
checking up a pile of trunks that rose
tier on tier to the roof of the car. John
Parker wore a pair of disreputable iron
spectacles. Hit hair, 6cant where it
wasn't extinct, tumbled about his head
loose at both ends. His gray beard was
a good bit stronger in the fly than In
the hoist and it blew In the wind tmn
as a coach whip; but old John had be
hind his dirty spectacles a pair of eyes
Just as fine as st*>e!. Francis opened
his train box and asked the baggageman
why hÂ« didn't Kill those dogs, and get
ting no answerâ for John Parker was
checking hard and stopped only to shllt
his whiskers off the clipâ the conductor
got out his blue pencil and his black
pencil and filed them away, took up h's
punch and his trip checks and put them
in their proper pockets, shifted his tlnii
table from the box to still another pocket,
and picked up his lantern. The head
end brakeman coming in Just then wKli
a sash puller, Francis asked him to ciean
up the globe.
He listened grimly, for he thought he
could domino every play I Bucks could
make when it came to tricks for saving
time on the Wild Hat run. Yet it heart
ened even Pat Francis, uncompromising
and grim, to have his superintendent
there in the storm helping cut out the
work for such a particularly beaitly pull.
As Bucks broke away and started for
the door of the Wickiup, Morris Barker
âthe conductor who had Just brought the
train inâ saluted, walking out With, his
coat buttoned snug, in the comfortable
insolence of a man going home, Morrli
stepped to the edge of the platform to
exchange confidences with Pat Francis.
"Pat, there's a half-fare back in the
Portland sleeper. I heard Mclntyre say
at McCloud that some of Alfabet Smith's
men are working up here. Anyway
there's a cattleman in a canvas coat
In the chair car, smooth face, red tie, to
look out for. He, got on at Harding and
tried a ehort fare on me.| I sized him up
for a spotter."
"Why didn't you chuck him off?"
growled Pat Francis.
"Got your ticket, Tony?"
"No gotta" ticket"
"Money?"
"No gotta d* mnn."
"Come on then!" Francis gripped him
"Throw you off."
The Italian drew back to resist. They
parleyed a moment longer, only because
Francis was bluffing. If he had meant
to stop the train at any point he would
have said nothingâ simply dragged the
fellow out by the hair.
At last the Italian produced three dol
lars and a half. It was only enough to
check him to Red Cloud. He wanted
to go through, and the fare was eleven
dollars and twenty cents.
The silent conductor stuck the money
in his pocket and * drew his cash fare
slips. Just then the pusher whistled a
stop signal. Francis started, suddenly
furious at the sound. Shoving the slips
Into, his pocket he hurried to the vesti
bule and put his -head angrily out. Ahead
he Baw^only John Parker's lamp and
streamers. John had slid hia door be
fore Francis could open the vestibule.
That was why the conductor loved him,
A different start thatâ a-runnlng past
the wind Instead of Into It; a sluing that
brought excursionists up In a tumble as
the sleepers swung larlat-llko around the
canyon corners. It was only a case- of
hang-on after that, hanging on all the
way to Wild Hat; and then. Just as the
Columbian Pacific train passengers left
their breakfasts at Beaton, No. 1. gray
and grimy, rolled into the junction thir
ty-five minutes late and the agony was
over. The connection was safe, but no
body noticed who made It. everybody
was too much occupied with the sunshine
and the scenery to observe a pair of dis
reputable, haggard, streaked, hollow-eyed
tramps who made their way modestly
along the edge of the platform. It was
only Pat Francis and Moore, conductor
and engineer of No. L *
The agony was over for everybody but
Pat Francis. Ten days later Bucks, su
perintendent of the mountain division, sat
In bis den at the Wickiup, reading a let
ter from, the general manager:
Sir: On Thursday, June 2S. Conductor. P.

have beftn Just that much better off loaf-

their newspapers and ferries and street
cars. Pat Francis listened grimly. (A
ehort, stocky fellow, Pat Francis. Not
fat. but firm as a Bessemer bar. and with
considerably quicker play In his joints.)
Bo. although the Columbian Pacific con
nection looked especially doubtful tbat
sight, nevertheless there was Bucks, un
der a slouching Stetson and an Irish
frieze that caught all the water coming
fta way, standing at the drivers of the
head engine, while Jack Moore. In leather
heel to Jaw, went Into the slush- -under
her to touch up an eccentric with a repu
tation for cussedneas In a pinch. And a
minute later Bucks was walking back to
figure with the out conductor, Pat Fran
cis, t;ow to make schedule across to Wild
Hat, though, as they talked, each man
knew the other was not thinking at all
of how to make schedule, but thinkingâ
though never a word out loud of It, and
hell to face all the way up the gorge on
top of it â of how â with flesh and blo^d
and steel to beat schedule tbat night and
land the uncertain connection, in spite of
wind and weather and the bureau's fears
and thÂ» dispatcher's growls.
To begin with the night was bad. "A
holy fright," Pat Francis calleJ Jt. and
Pat had seen most of the bad nights In
the mountains for twenty-two jj years
steady. It was snowing and raining and
6leetlng that night, all at once; and blow-
Ingâ it blew the oil out of the guide cupÂ«.
From the platform of the Wickiupâ nobody
in the gorge would call it a depotâ from
the Wickiup platform at Medicine Bend
JCo. 1 seemed to roll into division that
eight one reeking sheet of alkali iceâ
soda and frost solid from lamp to lamp.
She was late, too, with a pair of the
best engines than ever climbed a moun
tain heading her. She had lost time
every mile cf the way from the plains,
and ehe was ordered west with another
double-head end a pusher all the way
over the Horseback. It was because there
was a Yellowstone excursion aboard.
The Columbian Pacific connection was on
that account especially desired; and that
night at 12 o'clock, mountain time, wl.h
No. 1 especially late into the bend, and
the track especially tad, and the pull
especially heavy. It lookedâ that Colum
lan Pacific connectionâ especially doubt
ful, except over In the dispatcher's of
fice, where they were being pounded to
zn&ke it by the excursion bureau.
Bucks was down that night. There
were many bad nights in the mountains,
but Bucks never missed any of them by
going to bed. On bad nights, Bucks, like
a. switchman's pipe, was always out He
âBucks â personally appeared at the
Wickiup to see that things went. The
men liked him because he was always
ready to do anything he asked them
to do. There was an esprit, a morale â
Â¦whatever you call Itâ and a loyalty to
Bucks personally, Â¦which made our men
take the chances that pay checks don't
THERE had been some talk at head-
Quarters about our conductors. It
was Intimated and freely from the
auditing department that the men
of the punch were not dividing
talrly with the company.
To this effect the general manager wrote
Bucks, superintendent of the mountain
division. Bucks filed the tetter away In
the stove. Another communication fared
Bo better. But there were some new peo
ple at headquarters; they had a record to
znake and they proposed to v.rite part
ef It on our Lacks. Bucks got another
letter; he threw it in the stove.

This Is the First of a Remarkable Series by This Talented Writer. Watch for
"The Trainman's Story"â Next Sunday.Professor J. C. Bose recently presented
to the Llnnean Society In London the re
sults of experiments which will show that
the peculiar movements of the leaflets of
the so-called "telegraph-plant" are due
to an electrical disturbance traveling as
a "current of action" In the plant Each
leaf consists of a large terminal leaflet
and two smaller lateral ones. The later
al leaflets spontaneously rise and fall Ilka
the arms ot a semaphore, the period of a
complete movement being about three
and a half minutes. Hence the name of
the plant, which is a species of "desmo

Oldest House In the World.
Not since humanity began delving into
the mysteries of the existence of primi
tive man has a discovery been made so
rich In Its suggestlveness of the home life
of prehistoric races as that made by the
United States Revenue cutter Bear on
her recent cruise to the Arctic Ocean. A
house built by human beings at least 5C00
years ago, and probably of an antiquity
far greater, was discovered by Alaskan
natives near Point Barrow, and many of
the utensils used by the people who mada
it a habitation were secured. Stone
hatchets, stone knives, and other stone
and bone Implements belonging to races
that flourished before the dawn of his
tory, have frequently been found, but
never before has a house in which they
lived been found preserved through the
wrecks of time and all the elemental
catastrophes that have strewn the sur
face of the earth with ruin and death.
Bucks smiled a far-off smile. "Tne

sent the' blood to the hearts and a chill

and . a severe oneâ No. . 2 was against it.
Before the frightened porters could open
the vestibules the passenger engines. were
working In the back motion, and No. 2
was scuttling down the Noose to get
the party and put his hand on his shoul

"Look here," said Bucks, and his words
snapped like firecrackers, "I want you

Toltec lies In the Powder Ranse, near
the foot of a great curve called 'the
Noose, because every time an engineer
slips the head of his train into It he is
glad to hold his breath till he gets it out.
The Toltec Noose is engineering mag
nificent; but It is railroading without
wordsâ unless \ one counts the wicked
words. Eagle Pass station, the head of
the Nooee, looks across an unspeakable
gulf directly down Into Toltec 600 feet
below and barely a mile away. But by
the rail we count seven miles around that
curve, and without any land grant per
quisites, either.
Every train that runs the Noose Is dou
ble-headed both ways, and now â this was
before â they add, to keep trainmen off the
relief scrap, a pusher.
That day there was no pusher behind
the Overland Freight, and No. 2"s crew,
as they pulled out of Toltec to climb the
loop, could plainly see above and across
the storming, struggling, choking engines
of the tea train as they neared with their
load the summit of EaelÂ« Pass.

man, darting from the caboose, ran up
the ladder like a cat and began setting

stand it. From one of the big tea cars
a dra wheat! parted like a tooth. The tea

When the Siamese girl gets up In thÂ»
morning she does not go to the) wash
stand to wash her face, for the simple
reason that Siamese houses' can boast no
such article of furniture. So she) Just
runs down to the foot of thÂ« ladderâfor
the house Is built on postsâ to a large Jar
of water with a cocoanut shell dipper.
There she washes her face by throwing
the water over her hands and rubbing?
them dver her face. She needs no towel,
for the water Is left to dry. She does not
brush her teeth, for they are stained black
by chewing the betel nut. Her hair does
not require combing, either, for It Is all
shaved except a. little tuft_on the top ol
away from Impending disaster. The
trainmen huddled again In the baggage
car door, with their eyes glued on the
runaways; the Noose is so perfect. a curve
that every foot of their flight could be
seen. It was' a race backward to save
the passenger train; but for every mile
they could crowd Into its wheels the run
aways were making two. Pat Francis
saw It first â saw it before they had cov
,ered half the distance back to Toltec.
They could never make the hill west of
the Noose; it wasn't in steam to beat
gravity. Moreover, if they crowded No. 2
too hard she might fly an elevation and
go Into the gulf. It Is one thing to run
down hill and another thing to fall down
-hill. The tea train was falling doVn hill.
Francis turned to bare-headed John
Parker and handed him his watch and
hls^money.
"What do you mean?" John Parker
choked - the words out because he knew
what he meant.
"Turn this stuff In to Bucks, John, if
I don't make it. It's all company money."
The brakeman, greenish and dazed,
steadied himself with a hand on the
Jamb; the baggageman stared wild-eyed
through his rusty lenses. "Pat," he fal
tered, "what do you mean?"
"I'll, drop off at the Toltee switch and
maybe I can open it to catch that string
âwe'll never make it this way, John,
In God's world."
"You might a'most as well jump out
into the canyon; you'll never live to use
a switch key, Patâ we're crowding a mile
a minute. â "
Francis looked at him steadily as he
pulled his ring and took a switch key
off the bunch.
"They're crowding 2. John."
The car slued under them. John Parker
tore oft his spectacles.
"Put, I'm a lighter man than youâ
give me the switch-key!" he cried, grip
ping the conductor's shoulder as he fol
lowed him out of the door to the plat

"No." /
"Your children are younger than mine,

"This is my train, John. Ask Bucks
to look after my Insurance."

shrieked a chorus; a cloud ilke smoke
followed the wreck down the mountain
side. And the good people of No. 2, the
pleasure-seekers that Pat Francis was
taking care ofâ $125 a monthâ saw It all
and tried to keep cool and think.
He lay prostrate across the road, a
bruised and dirty and bloody thing. John
Parker, stumbling on rlcketv knees,
reached him first, but he spoke again and
again befofe the blooishot eyes reluct

choking, spitting, gasping, clutching at
John Parker's bony arm. raised his head.
It fell back into the cinders. But he
doggedly raised It againâ and shook the
broken teeth from between his lipsâ and
lived. His face was like a section of
beefsteak, and the Iron lear thÂ»t struck

him. A few minutes afterward he lay In
the stateroom of the forward sleeper and
tried with his burning, swollen tongue to
talk to Brooklyn men who feelingly stared
at him, and to Brooklyn women who pret

who unsteadily swore at him as he fanned

THOMAS FITCH
The public opinion of that day concern

ritory was Inadvertently but aptly ex
pressed by a newly appointed bailiff of
the Territorial Supreme Court. He was
a long, lean gentleman, of great gravity
and dignity of demeanor, with a sonorous
voice, a most imposing manner and an
exalted idea of the importance of his of
fice. It was his duty at the beginning of
the term to -announce to the assembled
bar of the Territory that its highest judi
cial tribunal was open for business. No
particular formula had been prescribed
for such announcement, and it had not
occurred to "Baron Pumpernickel," as
the bailiff was nicknamed, that it would
be all sufficient to say to the lawyers and
litigants in waiting, "Gentlemen, the Su
preme Court." So, swelling with his im
portance,, the - baron stretched forth hla

a delegate In the constitutional conven

Among the lesser lights of the bar of
that day was Tom Cox. He was some
what too bibulous and too scattering to
achieve , a leading practice in Virginia
City, but in the neighboring district, of
which Washoe City was the county seat,
he was facile princeps.
He was a North Carolinian, a college
graduate, a student first, of divinity, later
of medicine and lastly of law. He was
a typical "forty-niner," for he had been
a miner, a lumberman and a teamster,
as well as a doctor, a preacher and a
lawyer. He was an all around sport and
as fond of fun as a boy. He was adroit
and eloauent at the bar or on the hust
ings, and it was his boast that he could
with equal facility draw a complicated
bill In equity without an erasure or an
interlineation, and that with a dragoon
revolver he- could shoot the head off a
chicken at twenty paces. He was as free
to borrow your ; money when you had any
as he was to loan you his ownâ when he
had anvâ and he never drew a solvent
breath from Monday morning to Satur
day night. He occupied a dilapidated one
story wooden building In Washoe City,
where he established his law office in the
front room, while in the' rear apartments
he located j his living rooms, where he
did his own cooking and lived sometimes

Their first view of the pleasant country
home that was to be theirs for two hap

any one less optimistic than a summer
boarder or a perennial candidate for of

promised them was bounded on the south
by a creamery, on the: east by a barn
yard, on the north' by the rear elevation
of a glue factory, and on the west by
a grindstone and a discouraged wheel
barrow. It was ten miles 'from a rail
road, fifteen miles from a stream of water
deep enough to float a seagoing mosqui
to, and. about three thousand miles from
any resemblance to the paradise described
In the advertisement. All the comforts of
home that It appeared to possess were of
the sort that a man leaves home to set
away from, j
' One of the things that they desired to
secure they were granted the first thing
off the bat, and that was early rising.
In fact, they rose several times the first
night to organize a posse for the pursuit
cf happiness and other things that In
sisted on occupying uie bed with them.
in the Intervals of this amusing pastime
Their hearts and their collars were high
with hope and gloss starch as they pic
tured to themselves the delights of a real
home in the country that they were soon
- to taste. . They would rise early In the
morning when all the world .was bathed
in sunshine and fresh buttermilk, and
list to the sweet carol of the birds and
eke the hired man as he fared forth to
tap the brindle heifer in the back pasture
or to commit assault and battery on the
sweet scented clover In the meadow abaft
the barn.. They dreamed sweet dreams of
the new mown eggs and. the fresh laid
honey tbat should gladden their sensitive
palates, of. milk Innocent of the corrod
ing touch of eau de Croton and of butter
that should be kind but firm. The wily
advertisement had spoken to them of
gentle but amusing pastimes, of tennis
and golf, even the unsuspecting croquet,
and in their unsuspecting young hearts
they believed it all. They bad not yet
learned that there are three varieties of
liars: Common or garden liars, poets and
men. who advertise.
In the, fullness of time and of his pock
etbook the longing came to George ,Van
Smlthers to go forth and let the great
heart of; Mother Nature beat against. his
own for a few consecutive beats. The
summer; is a good time for beats of all
kinds, but'George didn't know that when
he first began to foregather with the said
longing. During .the long, hard winter
George's calling and election .was to. reel
off ;< hosiery and refined underwear at a
genteel : haberdashery in - the busx ; city at
an assessed valuation of $16 per week.
When, the news was broken to him that
the hobbles were to be taken off for as
much as two weeks during the heated
term he had difficulty In expressing his
gratitude; after the two weeks were over
he could have sent his gratitude under
a 2-cent stamp with room to spare.
., After a prolonged wrestle with a' table
of logarithms masquerading as a railroad
and hotel guide , he decided on a quiet
place in the country, "tewns moderate,
all the t comforts of home," - that ' might
have ' been - an , exact _ reproduction of the
original 'Adam ' sanitarium In the garden
of Eden, if one could judge from the ad

mometer was working overtime and the
ice man warbled his cheerful lay as he
laid Â¦ the" householder's dally portion of
congealed bacteria on the slide of the
microscope and trundled his bill Into the
elevator. The asphalt melted patiently
away in the gentle but persistent -rays of
the sun even as the dividends of the
trust that laid it and the coal man sailed
away on his yacht to gather strength and
a new schedule of prices against the day
when a beneficent Providence should once
more place the caloric destiny of the hu
man race into his philanthropic hands." **
It was the season when the dwellers in
the cities fold up their household gods'
and their consciences and put them away
in camphor, and laden down with good
intentions and bales of greenbacks hie
them to the mountain and the seashore to
get next to nature. It was the time of
the year when every man feels the stir
of that longing of which the poet â who
had probably been on a vacation himselfâ
sings in those "touching" strains:
Oh, for a 'odge In some vast wilderness
Where I may loaf all -day and pleasure seek.
Feast upon canned goods, sleep on bags of hay.
And. pay, the landlord twenty bones a week.- .

They tasted the Joys of country life for
exactly five days, during the which they
amused themselves by comparing mos

At the end of that time they pooled their
surplus and journeyed back to town on
the bumpers of a freight train to take
a little rest in their hall bedrooms, where
nothing disturbed them save the stately
rustle of the cable cars and the deep,
regular breathing of the policeman on
the corner.
The breakfast was another grand con

ported the colonel for office. Determined
to vindicate or avenge his friends, the
colonel armed himself with a huge hick

rode Into Carson.^ Having hitched his
horse and quenched his thirst at the
Howling Wilderness saloon the colonel
strode over to the newspaper office. It
was the noon hour, and all the Appeal

beardless, fragile-looking young man, who

scrimmage did not come off.
There was much activity in the polit
ical arena In Nevada as elsewhere in the
late sixties, and In the absence of thea
ters and concerts the crowds who attend
ed upon the hustings were large and ap
preciative of a good point, whoever It
might hit. When the fourteenth amend
ment . was under discussion a candidate
for . Congress was expatiating upon the
dire results to flow from its adoption.
"Under it," said he, "if Nevada refuses
to admit Chinamen to vote her represent
ation in Congress will be reduced." "Ne
vada has but one member of Congress,"
retorted his opponent, "and I do not see
how we can reduce her representation un
less we elect you." , *' i .
There was a great meeting at Austin
called to listen to a Joint debate between
the Congressional " candidates. One of
these was a young man with a heavy
head of brick-auburn hair, which he part
ed In the middle, and a well developed
bump of self-esteem. . Austin was in the
eastern portion of Nevada, 160 miles from
the western section, with a desert wilder
ness: between. "My opponent," said on"*
of the speakers, "has been called . the
young Samson . of his party, , and I admit
the aptness of the comparison. Like
Samson he has a heavy head of hair in
which his strength mainly liesand which
he parts In the middle to avoid disturbing
the equilibrium of his intellect He has
come across the desert, which divides Aus
tin from Virginia City in order' to enligh
ten us; Philistines upon constitutional
law. Like Samson he has come up out
of â¢ the wilderness â¢ hoping to prevail
against us, and with the same weapon
that, was used by his predecessor." The
speaker did not say what the weapon was,
but the audience caught on.
Tens of thousands of the brightest,
bravest, most generous, enterprising and
energetic men on earth, the Knight Pala
dins, who challenged the brute forces of
nature to combat, the soldiers who, pos
sessed with the aura sacra fames, faced
the storm and the savage, the desert and
disease, swarmed around the base of
Mount Davidson and reached out to Au
rora, to Recce River, and to the moun
tains of the Humboldt. Crawling like
huge files over the bald ekulls of lofty
mountains, plodding across alkaline des
erts, which pulsed with deluding mirages
under the throbbing light, and smiting
with pick and hammer at the adamantine
doors of the earth's treasure chamber,
these pioneers engaged In their self-im
posed task.
Readier with rifle or revolver than with
scriptural quotations was the Kevadan of
those days and readier still with his coin
sack at the call of distress. Under the
blue shirt might be found sometimes a.
graduate of Yale, and sometimes a fugi
tive from Texas. No man assumed to bo
better than his neighbor and no man con
ceded his Inferiority to anybody. Frei
burg graduates and sheep herders, divin
ity students and Cornish miners, farmer
boys and ex-Judges of the Supreme Court
were all treasure seekers together, and
a. blow of a pick might make or unmake
fortunes and equalize the beggars and
the princes of this Aladdin's cave. Some
found fortunes and some found unmarked
graves upon the hillsides, and many have
become rich or renowned in other fields,
but not one among them all will remem
ber with other than affection the days
away back "In the sixties," when he
wrought the warp and spun the woof of
rainbows In the Sagebrush State. .
In those days only the upper levels of
the Cometock were yielding their treas

ered, the California and Consolidated Vir
ginia exhibited nothing but barren quartz
and hope, and those who at a later day
controlled the financial and political des
tinies of Nevada were working as labor
ers in the mines or mixing cocktails or
practicing as members of as brilliant a
bar as could be found in any community
of thrice its size in all the land.

THE SUNDAY CALIn
140 ' ?
Se thrust the Lime a hundred times and clearly won the prizeâ Â»
Just because his own strong juice got into Cuban's â¢yea.
The next thing on the programme was a jig by Happy Pat,
Who danced until his strength gave out and, exhausted, fell down flat.
There were many other things, my dears, to mark this gladsome day,
And every one that took a part won praise from Pumpkin gay.
"But one remains," the monarch said, in glancing o'er the host,
"Who needs must do a thing or two if he would have ray toast."
The venerable Grandpa Prune stepped forth and bowed with ease and grao*
Â¦And said: "0 Worthy King, yon know I'm the oldest of our race.
Forsooth, I am too aged to bo sprightly Ilk* thÂ« rest,
But to please your Gracious Majesty I shall try to do my best;
; Z cannot dance, I cannot sing: â that you all know well,
But if your. Majesty will allow I shall your fortune telL"
Old Grandpa hobbled to the King, who held out his jeweled hand
To have .his fortune told therewith by the wizard of the land.
6ld Prune looked at the lines awhile, and said with great surprise: .
"There dwells some place a Princess who has rich and lustrous eyes.
She is waiting to be wedded by the King of all the realm,
And she'd be quite a mate for you in guiding at the helm.-
It pains me, Gracious Majesty," Old Prune said with regret,
"To say that I do not know where this maiden can be met."
The King was all a-flutter, and with a firm command
He ordered General Pippin bold to scour the entire land.
"Fetch to me this Princess fair, and he who does succeed,
Shall ever be in favor high and shall never be in need.
Now, haste away, my Pippin good, and search both- far and near/rW)
And do not gaze upon me more until you bring her here.'*
General Pippin dashed away with purpose well defined,
With Crookneck Squash and Badish red trudging close behind.
The King' made ready to receive the Princess fair and fine,
And he felt very certain that he shoxsM see her in short time*
How, I think, my darling dears, ni stop and rest awhile, ,
.But next week you shall hear about more to make you smilt.
The next thing on the programme was a fencing contest fine
Between Old Spanish Onion and Nimble Cuban Lime,
The fencers used long, pointed reeds, and the laughter, sweets, was great
As little Xdme with confidence danced round bis older mate.
The scientific youngster struck at least one hundred blows
To every one old Onion struck â and such laughter, goodness knowil
â¢ â¢ â¢
Old Dr. Carrot scraped and bowed and hastened o'er the green
To where the fat old fellow lay in pain so sharp and keen.
The Doctor felt his pulse awhile and listened to his heart
And then assumed a wrinkled brow, which is the doctor's art.
"This case, 0 King, is serious," said the Doctor, bowing low,
"But I think I can fix him up within an hour or so."
He found the sharpest blade of grass, and from big Melon's side \
He- cut a fine triangle as the King looked on with pride.
While Water Melon wailed and moaned the surgeon with 1 great speed
Took out through the open place a badly damaged seed,
The patient soon recovered strengthâ with neither nurse nor drug:
And now, my dears, you know about the first big-melon plug.
But Onion, cool old fellow, smiled and never said a word, * <
But calmly waited for a chance to thrust his trusty sword.
He seemed so greatly overmatched that the monarch finally said:
" 'Twere meet that I should call a halt before my subject's deiid."
But old Onion, spunky fellow, with gameness stood his ground
While nimble little Cuban Lime danced 'round and 'round and 'round.
Old Onion's strength was failing fast, until he scarce could stand,
And finally the other knocked the sword from, out his hand.
"You're at my mercy !"Lime cried out, and his face flushed deep with pride,
And an instant later sent his sword into old Onion's side.
That thrust, my precious dumplingsâ strange as it may be,
Brought woe unto the nimble Lime and gave Onion victory.
When the point pierced Onion's side the juice flew out in stream
And some got into Cuban's eyes and some went to the green.
While the Lime was blinded, old Onion saw his chance
And took his sword up f*om the ground and started in to dance.
f>^g^_'>^4 BEN I left off last week, my sweets, King Pumpkin's
host had made
ji^a'/' tlM J^R A. palace rich and beautiful, with domes of every shade.
J-sW/fsWiK w So delighted was His Majesty with the work that had
JÂ£Â£jj~auÂ£&Â£Â£ been done
That he proclaimed a holiday and urged all on to fun.
He charged young Guernsey Parsnip to prepare a programme gay
And selected General Pippin as Officer of the Day.
"Methinks that I," said Pippin proud, "should have an aid or so,
For I can't be expected to do everything, you know."
Happy Pat Potato knelt before the jovial king
And said: "Make me Policeman and I'll w&tch everything.
O worthy sire, I'm well equipped, and the honor I should prize,
And there'd be no offender who'd escape my many eyes."
"Bight well," King Peter quickly said, "and the Master of the Suit
Will fit you out in. proper style from helmet down to boo.t."
Now ni speed on, my pretty ones, and tell you what- was done
To give King Peter pleasure and afford his subjects fun.
The first thing on the programme was a tribute to the King, WÂ»M
Who applauded very heartily, as did every other thing.
Our old friend Water Melon ran a race with Oxheart Beet
And the excitement of the contest was pitched to fever heat.
Just before the goal was reached big Melon tripped and fell
And bumped his side so painfully that he set up a yell.
He tried his very best to rise, but every effort failed him,
Till Dr. Carrot chanced along and the monarch quickly hailed him.;iÂ» ' ,
"It is my wish," the sovereign said, and, my pets, he was quite flurried,
"That Melon be attended, for indeed I am much worried,"

When Mr. and Mrs. William Jennings

young woman to prevent, and, failing in
that, at least to postpone for one year

The information filed against Trefren

release of mortgage on property . on Me
chanic street in this city. The property
in question was formerly owned by Tref

R. K. Sutton, gave the latter a mortgage
upon it. Afterward Trefren sold the prop

nected only Horn Toon and Wong Tin
with himself in the transaction. On
Tuesday Marshal Shine had another con
ference with Gamble, and after a session
of an hour and a half succeeded in get
ting the truth out of him with regard to
his white confederates. The Marshal said:
I said to him: . "I have been your friend
since your boyhood. Â¦" and I think you owe. it
to yourself, to your family, and certainly 'to
me to tell ma- the whole truth about this mat
ter. If I have to lose every man . In my of
fice I want to know the truth." I was conn
dent that Ptte Gamble never went in there and
put up that job himself. I was positive of
that. I had known him a long while and it
was the flret He that he had ever told me
when Iv said at the. start that he was Inno
cent. I said to him, "You know I have been
your friend, end if you are groins to let Dasha
and Burnett get the beat of you you'd better
quit right here. This, is your last chancÂ« to
talk.- I want not only the truth but the wholn
truth." Then he told me all about. Dasha
and Burnett and- Dempsey and how the eub
etltuttons were made at night in the County
JalL Thrn I* called In -Burns, Woodsworth

Ethel C. Clisby, hia widow, all of hia
$23,000 estate is the subject of a. contest
begun yesterday in the Superior Court.
The contestant is Annie M. Clisby, moth

The contest fs based on the ground that
the document was not wholly written,

that signed the will as witnesses, and
that their signatures were not affixed
thereto at the request of the deceased.

Miners and Indiana in the Wichita
Mountains Are I/ikely to Have
Serious Trouble.
GUTHIUE. O. T., Sept. 19.â Traveler* com.
irg from the Wichita Mountains report that
thr.re b darg-Â»r of the miners and Indians get
ting into frious trouble aa the refiait of the
latter objecting to the former working their
allotments for minerals. A few days ago
-Â»v*ral Indian police went Into the vicinity
tit Mount Sheridan and ordered some miners,
who aiv prospecting on the allotments, to
'8 rate thÂ» pla^e, but instead the miners
crabbed their rifles, and as thry outnumbered
the police the latter were compelled to leave
th<Â» ecene.
The individual Indians who own the allot
ments clash with the miner* nearly every day,
ar.d it is feared unless something it. done to
ronciliate the Indians trouble of a serious
nature car.net be averted.
' They said that they had been obliged
to talie Gamble into the scheme and allow
him to become a sharer In the proceeds
for two reasons; first, because it was dif
ficult to obtain substitutes In a.11 cases
who looked sufficiently like the genuine
to pars for them even on a superficial ex
amination, and second, because Gamble
became suspicious on one occasion and re
marked to Dasha, "Don't try to do that
again."*
The prisoners were taken yesterday
afternoon to the office of the United
States secret service in the Appraisers'
building and were transferred to the City
Prison last evening after the newspaper
men had become acquainted with the
facts. Bail was set at $2000 each and it
was stated that the men would furnish
bonds on Monday morning.
MARSHAL SHINE'S STATEMENT.
United States Marshal Shine made the
following statement last evening;
After Sheriff Lackmann and our pÂ»rty had
arrested the ; men we took them to a private
place and then one by one into a room in or
der to iret fctatementa from them. It took a
long; while to do this, but one by one they
broke down -and fc-ave va the whole story.
They told us in detail how the substitutions
xvero made. A Chinaman would come to the
jail in the night on their shift with the sub
stitute*. Â»nd the real prisoners would be al
loÂ»e<I to go out of the door. Burnett was
captain of the shift and his place was at the
front door: Darha was In the upper corridor,
and Dempsey was his associate. Two hundred
dollars for each Chinese thus allowed to es
cape was the fixed price, of which Gamble re
ceived- one-third ar.d the three Jailers the re
mainder. Gamble Â«u not In the combination
originally. They made It a point to get sub
stitutes resembling the Chinese *ln the jail so
that there would be less chance of any acci
dental detection.
When asked as to the status of Hack
man Tom Martin, who drove Gamble and
his substitutes in his hack from the Ap
praisers' building to the Mail dock, Mr.
Shine declared very earnestly that Mar
tin was "as straight as a string," that
Gamble had said the same thing, that
the Federal authorities believed him to
be thoroughly honest and altogether
blameless in the matter and that Dasha,
Burnett and Dempsey . had exonerated
the old hackman from any suspicion of
having- been connected with them.
STJBST1TU TIONS OUTSIDE.
Mr. Shine proceeded to explain further
that on only two occasions were.substi
tutions made outside the Jail; one being
some months ago, when two men were
substituted by Gamble between Â¦â¢ the . jail
and the steainp r, and on Friday, the 11th
of the present month, when six Chinese
were substituted at the Appraisers'
building. On this point, he said, Gam
ble's confession was that he took the six
original Chinese prisoners from' the Jail
and allowed them to escape on Broadway,
near Sansome. Then he proceeded alone
to the Appraisers' building, where he
found the six substitutes in , waiting.
These he placed in the prisoners' room
of the Marshal's office and afterward took
them downstairs and placed them In- Mr.
Martin's hack. The reason for making
the substitution outside of the jail was
that Jailer Burnett was absent on the
previous evening and an outside Deputy
Sheriff was detailed to take his place.
Dasha and Dempsey therefore did not
care to risk making the substitution un
der the circumstances.
JAILER DASHA. CALLED.
Mr. Shine Immediately after the six sub
stitutes had been taken ashore -from the
steamer Gaelic Bent tor Jailer. Dasha to
look at the six men and say whether they
were the same that he had turned over to
Gamble at the jail. Dasha replied that
they were not. Mr. Shine then asked him
where Tom Martin's hack stood when the
prisoners were put into it at the jail, and
Dasha replied that it stood opposite the
iront steps.
After Gamble had made hi^. confession
to the effect that the hack had not been
taken to the jail the Marshal stepped into
hig office and directed Deputy Marshal
Farish to call Dasha up by telephone and
ask him to repeat what he had already
said on that subject. Mr. Farish did so,
and Dasha repeated his previous answer
that the hack stood in front of the jail.
Then Farish asked him over the tele
phone if he had eeen the Chinese being
put Into the hack by Deputy Marshal
Gamble, and he replied In the affirma
tive.
"Are you sure you saw Pete putting
them in?" asked Farish.
"Ye?," replied Dasha
Reverting to Gamble's confession. Mr.
Shine said that his deputy had confessed
to him In private last Monday, but not so
freely or with so much of detail as he did

<~ol!ins. aged S5. was SuJTocated in a fire that
Â»tartÂ«-d early this morning: Â«t 211 Kast Fifth
â¢trcct.
When the neighbors assembled at the
house of Robert Stokes they found his
dead body lying in the doorway of the
kitchen, the feet extending out upon the
steps and a shotgun lying at his feet with
a cotton string tied to thÂ© trigger. He
had been shot in the mouth, the bullets
passing through the brain. On the bed
in the main bedroom lay the body of his
wife, Sarah Stokes, in her night robe.
She had also been shot in the upper part
of the face and had died instantly.
Informations were filed charging James
R. Stokes with having murdered both.
The District Attorney, Robert Duncan,
assisted by Attorney J. C. Ruddock, elect
ed to try the case of Sarah Stokes first,
and this second trial began last Wednes
day. The defense was conducted by John
LÂ». McNab. Â¦'
* The theory' of the defense was that
Robert Stokes first killed his wife and
then himself. The shotgun . found at the
feet of the dead man belonged to James
K. Stokes. The defendant admitted on
the stand that he had formerly had trou
ble with his brother Robert and they ha3
even fought, but that was months before
the tragedy. The case against the same
defendant for the- murder of Robert
Stokes. has not yet -been set for trial. The
jury in the case to-day was out only half
an 'hour.;
UKIAH, Sept. 19.â James :R. Stokes was
found guilty Qf murder In the Superior
Court here this afternoon and his punish
ment was fixed, by the jury at life im
prisonment. This was the second trial
of the case, the jury in the former trial
in Jufle having disagreed. The evidence
was wholly circumstantial.
James R. Stokes and his brother, Rob
ert Stokes, lived near each other on* a
mountain side, a few miles from the town
of Boonevllle, In this county. Their
wives wore sisters. In the early morning
of March 23, 1903, James R. Stokes went
to the house of a neighbor' and reported
that his. brother Robert and wife had
been murdered, or had committed sui
cide, in their own house. He asked that
the Coroner be sent for and the neighbor
hood aroused. Â¦ -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Rancher of Mendocino Must
Go to Penitentiary
. for Life.
James R. Stokes Con
victed in the Court
at Ukiah.
Gamble was born in Sonora, Tuolumne
County, forty-four years ago, and spent
his boyhood and young manhood there.
He was a butcher. He went to Modesto
twelve years ago and engaged in the
butcher business. Subsequently he' ran a.
livery stable there. In 1898 he came to
San Francisco and engaged In the butcher
business. When John H. Shine was ap
pointed United States Marshal for this
district he made Gamble, whom he had
known in Sonora,' a bailiff, and subse-;
quently promoted him to be a deputy
marshal. His services gave excellent sat
isfaction, and he was regarded as one of
the jnost competent men in the office.
Gamble was a man of keen susceptibil
ity, and the disloyalty he showed to Mar.
shal Shine, who had ever been a steadfast
friend of his, \s thought to have been the
predominating cause for his suicide. He
had a devdted wife, from whom he tried
to keep the full measure of his disgrace,
and she remained loyal as steel, even
when convinced against her will that he
had been culpable. All of his family
William P. Gamble untH a little more
than a week ago was regarded as a thor
oughly, honest man. He had friends in le
gion, and when it was first announced
that he was mixed up In the Chinese sub
stitution scandal there was a general out
cry that the changes were unfounded. A
few days later he confessed fully, impli
cating two Chinamen and Â¦ Thomas J.
Dempsey, William F. Dasha and, Thomas
J. Burnett, night jailers at the County
Jail. He told how he had secured the
custody of six young Chinamen confined
In the County Jail for deportation to take
them to the steamer Gaelic, which sailed
September 11.. On reaching Jackson and
Sansome streets he gave the prisoners. a
signal and they disappeared. He then
went to the Appraiser's building-, where Â¦
he met Horn Toon and "Wong Tin, who
had six decrepit Chinamen anxious to re-,
turn to their native country. These were
bundled into a hack and taken on board
the Gaelic by Gamble, who represented
that they were the six Chinese ordered
to be deported. The substitution was dis
covered by officials of the Chinese Inspec
tion Bureau and the exposure followed.
HIS FORMER CAREER.
STORY OF DISGRACE.
No writing of any kind was found-on
Gamble's body. The revolver with which
he shot himself was a new weapon and
was probably bought for the purpose.
When Marshal Shine dismissed him from
thÂ© service he made him turn over his
star and also insisted on taking- hia re
volver, fearing that its possession might
prove a temptation to commit suicide.
Gamble's depression over the exposure
that connected him with the substitution
case was noticeable to his family and
friends, but none of them, thought that
he would seek death as a relief for his
troubles. When he failed to appear at his
hotel Friday night his wife became
alarmed and communicated with United
States Marshal Shine and United States
District Attorney Woodworth, but they
could give her no information . of hia
whereabouts.
WEAPON IS NEW.
"It is asacrtcd that one member of the
family admitted yesterday morning that
in addition to these directions the envelope
contained a farewell hHter from Gamble
to hia wife, the contents 'of which he
urged her not to divulge. l>ater in the
day the members of the family denied the
authenticity of the reported statement
and asserted that beyond the note turned
over to the Coroner the envelope mailed
by Gamble contained nothing. i
. The letter was delivered shortly before
9 o'clock yesterday morning and Mrs.
Gamble immediately telephoned to F. W.
Crossctt, a brother-in-law of 'Gamble's
and an employe in theofflce of the freight
auditor of the Southern Pacific Company.
He repaired to the hotel and 'was handed
the note. He rode out to Buena Vista
Park alone and commenced a search for
the body of his brother-in-law. After
beating the brush for half an hour he
came upon the corpse. He went to a
nearby sanitarium and requested one of.
the attendants to notify the Coroner.
Then he returned and remained by the
body until the arrival of Deputy Coroner
Brown, who took charge of the remains.
They were subsequently turned over to
the family and removed to an undertak
ing establishment.

" My blood was all out of order, and I had to go

My tonsils were enlarged and my neck swollen
all out of shape; my throat was sore and I could
not cure it. My husband went for the- doctor,
but he gave me no encouragement. He helped
me a little, but it did not last long. He attended

LONDON. Sept. 19.â The Observer
this morning says that King Ed
ward in the course of his audi
ence with Premier Balfour yes
terday approved certain changes
in the Cabinet. Balfour will probably
make official announcement of the new
appointments to-morrow or Tuesday, but
this announctment is likely to be Incom
plete, as the Premier will ,not be able to |
perfect the construction of the
until the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Presi
dent of the Council, and Lord Balfour of
Burlelgh, Secretary for Scotland, shall
have decided what course they will adopt.
Regarding the eventual result of the up
heaval, the Spectator forecasts that Bal
four when he appeals to the country will
be beaten and be succeeded by a Rosebcry
Cabinet, which will not last long.
A curious phase of the situation is the
severe criticism regardless of party lines
bestowed on Balfour's action In publish-
Ins his views and selling them in pamphlet |
form. The Premier's keen tense of chiv
alry and honor Is far too deeply appre
ciated by all parties to ever permit the
suggestion that he purposely adopted the
doubtful practice. By Balfour's own ad
mission he is a "mere child in such mat
ters," and his inexperience in business af
fairs now appears to have put him at the
mercy of the publishers of the pamphlet,
who are coining money over the vital is
sue in national affairs. That Balfour will
devote his portion of the proceeds to some
charity is generally assumed, but It is re
gretted that he did not mention some
such intention in the preface of the
pamphlet. The Outlook, which Is a warm
supporter of the Premier, declares Bal
four's indiscretion "strikes a rude blow
at one's reverence for the traditions of
English public life when a public ser
vant's position seems to be used for pri
vate gain, no matter whose."
The Outlook adds that the fact that a
note was sent to the editors with the
pamphlet allowing them to quote only
1000 words textually is "one of the worst
features in this deplorable business."
The Spectator and other periodicals also
express concern on the latter point. The
Outlook estimates that the profits on 100,
000 copies alone will be 117,000, of which
Balfour will receive a large share. The
KEW GEEMAN LUTHERAN
CHTJECH TO BE DEDICATED
It Is reported that the Earl of Halsbury,
the Lord High Chancellor, will resign
owing to poor health, and that Attorney
General Flnlay will succeed him. The
EarH however, denies the report. ,
pamphlet promises to reach a sale of
1.000,000 copies.
It is learned from an authoritative
source that Balfour expects Chamberlain
to re-enter the Cabinet In the event that
an appeals to the country returns Balfour
to power. Both desire, however, that the
elections be postponed as long as possible
In order to give Chamberlain the oppor
tunity to impress his views on the people.
If the Government is returned, or if a
weak Liberal Ministry is retained in pow
er only a short time, Balfour expects that
he and Chamberlain will reorganize a
new Ministry. According to an authority
thoroughly cognizant with Chamberlain's
plans, Balfour might then find Chamber
lain unwilling to Join him.
"It has been Chamberlain's purpose,"
eald the person quoted, "to form a party
of his own, and he may take advantage
of the present opportunity to carry out
his intention. His reputation as the only
public man in England with a definite
policy, coupled with his strength of will
and ability, may enable him to achieve
his ambition. In case of the success at
the elections of his advanced programme
of preferential tariffs he would form hie
own Cabinet and probably displace Bal
four as Premier."

north of Grand Marais. By heroic work
the life-saving crew from the station* here
saved the entire crew of eighteen men
from the sinking ship, only to have their

three hours excited citizens of Grand
Marais watched the seamen in the life
and death struggle, which ended only
when two tugs saved the tossing surf boat
and brought Its exhausted occupants
safely into port.

11-year-old boy, one of the passengers,
were drowned while attempting to reach
shore. Seven or eight others were in

were taken ashore In boats.
The British steamer Topaz, with a car

N'APA. Sept. 10.â Henry T. Oxnard, the
sugar magnate and one of the most prominent
men of Southern California, will move his fa
mous ptork farm from Lexington. Ky., to the
Napa Valley. Last Sunday he was in Napa
advlslnp with A. 15. Spreckels on the subject.
Mr. Oxnard has practically if not actually
purchased over SCO acres near Napa and will
Immediately begin the expenditure of about
S1W.0CO In improvements thereon. He win
ebon commence the task of moving his thor
oughbreds from Kentucky to the.!r new home in
this valley. His decision to locate 'his farm
near Napa Is a great thing for this city and
the county, as it will be even more extensive
than the bis institution of Mr. Spreckels south
of town.
How extensively n general strike
would affect the building industry may
be recognised by the fact that Chicago
firms in the association alone have
contracts for marble work in buildings
in every section of the country, includ
ing the postpfflce building at San Fran
cisco, now neaiing completion.
CHICAGO, Sept. 19. â Work on nearly
every big building in the country in
course of construction is to be tied up
by a strike of marble workers. The
National Association of Marble Dealers,
comprising thirty-five of the largest
firms in the United States, has thrown
down the gauntlet to the workers by
announcing that they will be locked out
the first three days of next week, and
that, commencing on Thursday, an
open-factory policy will be pursued,
non-union as well as union men being
employed. Labor leaders do not be
lieve the marble workers will yield to
these conditions.

I need not say that I am in thorough accord
with the policies of President Roosevelt and
his administration, occupying common ground
with every Republican in the United States.
It is going to be unanimous next year.
The only issue between the parties in Ohio
this year having reference to taxation is
whether taxes raised fer the maintenance of
the State and its counties and municipalities
shall be raised In accord with methods long ap
proved, not only in the State of Ohio, but In
thn other States of the Union, and whether we
shall make such improvements by legislation
as experience has taught us can be safely
made for the benefit of all citizens of the
State; or whether we shall discard all recog
nized proper methods of taxation and adopt
the methods based upon the speculative theo
ries of Henry George and his followers.
Senator ' Foraker was next Introduced,
and he enlivened the audience by many
impromptu allusions to the incidents of
the day, as well as discussing pending
questions.
The audience was very demonstrative
at the Close of Senator Foraker's speech,
and broke out Into continuous cheering
when Governor Nash Introduced
Hanna as the next speaker. 'Senator
Hanna devoted the introductory part of
his speech to State affairs. Touching upon
national questions he said:
Mr. Clarke, whether he did it thoughtlessly
or intentionally, in a public utterance at Ak
r*i. O., I believe it was, made thin statement:
"This country Is on the verge of a financial
and Industrial collapse."
He sounded that note of danger. Why, God
only knows. But to my mind it was a crim
inal act, because the interests of the country
are concerned. They have never been In any
better shape than they are to-day.
There is nothing to interfere with the prog
ress of this course except to shake the confi
dence of tho people in the principles and poli
cies exercised by the party In power.
The only danger that can possibly come â and
I make this statement from the standpoint of a
business man â and I think I know business
better, at least, than my friend Clarke does,
anyway â the only danger that can possibly
come to the people of this country is through
their own act, by their own power and the will
to Change those policies which have made us
what we are to-day.
The whole country has its eyes upon Ohio,
knowing that this Is the skirmish battle for
liiC4, and I join in making the appeal to our
people, under these circumstances, to send a
word of greeting and confidence to the young
President at Washington and let him know that
Ohio falters not in the fight and will not this
time, and that we lead in the campaign of 1004.
The conditions, my . fellow-cltisens, in thU
country are normal. That Is to Say, they are
not abnormal. There is no reason why w'e
should not have long and continued periods of
prosperity in this country, because our natural
resources are beyond those ot any nation In the
world.
CHILLICOTHE, Ohio, Sept. 19.â The
Republican State campaign in . Ohio was
opened here to-day with a large parade,
followed by a meeting in Yocatenge Park,
at whj,ch Governor Nash presided.
Speeches were made by Senators Foraker
and Hanna ; Myron T. Herrick, candidate
for Governor; Warren M. Harding, candi
date for Lieutenant Governor, and others.
It is estimated that there were 20,000
people in and about Yocatenge Park when
Albert Douglass, recent candidate for the
gubernatorial nomination, delivered an
address of welcome and introduced Gov
ernor Nash as chairman. The Governor
congratulated the Republicans on their
auspicious demonstration and introduced
Colonel Herrick as the next Governor.
Colonel Herrick spoke in part as fol

OPEN CAMPAIGN
AT CHILLICOTHE
Secretary Shaw h.as represented the Dea
Moines Conference at the last two,Gen
eral Conferences and achieved national
prominence as one of the most powerful
debaters on tha floor of the conference.
Members of the conference generally
were aware that Secretary Shaw really
wished to go to Los Angeles; that he was
represented in this desire by J. M. Kit
tleman of Chicago and that the telegram
to Mann was brought out by a telegram
from Kettleman reporting that there was
formidable opposition to his candidacy.
- The opposition originated In the First
Â¦Church in Des Moines. When Secretary
Shaw removed to Washington ho took a
letter from that church In the usual form.
This letter was unexpectedly returned aV
the recent ' quarterly conference of the
First Church, the Secretary stating that
on second thought he preferred to retain
his membership and that of his family
in that church. Alnley, a lay delegate to
the Dts Moines conference, jumped to his
feet and exclaimed:
That is nothing but a political trick of
Shaw's to get himself elected as delegate to
the general -conference, and I want to say
right now that I shall vote against him.
The matter was kept as quiet as pos
sible, but the opposition increased to such
an extent as to put Secretary Shaw's
election out of the question.
DES MOINES, Iowa, Sept. 19.-Secre
tary Shaw has just been denied his cher
ished ambition to represent the Des
Moines District Conference at the Gen
eral Conference of the Methodist Epis
copal church In Los Angeles, arid thereby
hangs a tale. He was "turned down" at
the conference In Indlanola . to-day after
having: brought about a conflict that has
caused much ill-feeling. N' p
The Secretary received but one vote
and the announcement of that vote was
greeted with a "horse laugh" by the con
ference. But, in justice to the Secretary,
it should be said that a telegram convey
ing his refusal to be a candidate was in
the hands of L. M. Mann of Des Moines
and had been made known to the confer
ence.

lowing grounds:
That the action of the Dominican Gov

cepted in a friendly spirit by the United
State?.
That the United States Government
Â¦would not allow the establishment of any
coaling ports In Santo Domingo or the
cession of any portion of Santo Domln-
Ko territory to any European power.
That the United States will not permit
any nation to make exclusive use of Do
minican waters In time of peace, much
led in time of war; nor could the United
States allow any portion of Dominican
territory to be classed as neutral, nor
permit any portion of the country to con
flict with the concession granted to the
Clyde line, according to which all vessels
arriving from foreign ports are compelled
to pay port duties" excepting the Clyde

the first hour, some support being given
to steel ' and other Â¦ Industrials. The
amount of short covering was also very
extensive. After a brief reaction prices
again steadied and, following the publi

improved to the:close, which was steady

NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â The opening of
business on the Stock Exchange to-day
was the signal for another aggressive
drive against U. S. Steel common and
the industrial list generally. So fierce
was thÂ« attack that the decline in prices
embraced practically the entire list and
many stocks fotfhd new low levels. Steel
common going off a full point. Some of
the so-called gill edge industrials regis
tered severe losses, a case In point being
Westinghouse Electric, . which sold off
more than twenty points, with a loss of
almost half as much in the preferred
stock. Other issues that bore .tho brunt
of the J opening onslaught . Included Re
public Steel preferred. Sloss-Sheffleld, U.
S. Rubber preferred and Amalgamated
Copper. The railroad list also declined,
St. Paul. Rock Island, New York Central,
Canadian Pacific and Erie second prefer
red all making material recessions. The
break in the railers, however, resulted
from the heavy selling of Atchison stock
for a Western firm. which was recently
prominent on the buying side. The dem
onstration against Steel common was be
gun by a specialist who offered the stock
at 17%, and then down another fraction.
The traders took a hand and successfully
hammered it down to 17.

control, the outside demand for stocks
being too small to merit serious consid
eration. One of the redeeming features
of the week, as yet unexplained, was the
steady buying of certain high grade rail
way shares, chiefly Atchison, the Pa
cifies and a few others of this group, at
almost every recession. The absorption
of Atchison stocks revived the old story
of a change of control. The coal stocks
were not in rn"ch demand at any time.
Rumors of crop damages came thick and
fast and helped largely to depress prices
during the early week, but these, too.
proved false in large part. In fact, a
much more hopeful view regarding: crop
conditions rrevalled at the week's end
and resulted in considerable short cov
ering. â¢ ' Â¦ 5
The condition of the local national
banks, as disclosed by the recent call
of the Comptroller of the Currency, is re
garded as favorable, even though loans
and discounts are greater by 127,000,000
than they were at this time- last year.
The bond market displayed a great deal
of irregularity, but there wa9 little of in
terest to dealings outside of tha largo
transactions in V. S. Steel fives. Tha
general market followed tho course of
thia security closely. V. S. 2'a advanced
1 per cent. the old *'a registered
one-half per cent and the new 4"s one
quarter per cent. The old 4's coupon de
clined one-half per cent as compared with
the closing call of last week.

with Joaquln Miller, California's poet, who
later won such fame- In vpree.
Hack was running out of Virginia City when
Horace Greeley made the trip to Placervllle.
which is described by Mr. Clemens in "Rough-
Ing It."
Nearly every one on the coast and directly
cast of the mountains came to know my broth
er, either personally cr by reputation, as early
as the sixties, and gradually his reputation
crossed the divide and came through the Kast.
He was an adventurous fellow, but took no
chances when his coach was loaded. He died
ltl 1&S3.
Hank was born In Waddingto'n In 1S2S. He
was the eldest of a family of four children.
Our famiiy was of the same orlglr. as the good
Vermont stock in "Eben Holden." Grand
father and crandmother came from Vermont
in 1809, making- the Journey to WaddinKton
through the woods. When Hank first took the
Waddlngton-MagBPna route many shook their
heads and said he was toi young, but he
showed the doubters that he was a natural
driver. â¢ â¢ â¢
Hank always had a desire to drlvo Ptage
from the days r.hen .he wus a mere boy at
Waddington, and eouli# scarcely trudge around
and was only string enough to snap a whip
with great exertion of hiR little arms. When
he Wi-a only 12 years olu he drove stage from
Waddingtou to Jlassena. and I nra told by the
i.ldcr residents of the town that he was a good
driver, even at that early age.
Hank Monk was a New Yorker, having
been born In Waddington, St. Lawrence
County. He was a stage driver all his
life. He spent his early days driving a
stage between Waddington and Massena.
George A. Monk, a brother of the famous
stage driver, nor lives in Gouvernor, N.
Y., and a sister, Mrs. R. M. Kellogg, lives
In Hartford, Conn. George A. Monk has
a number of relics thut he will loan Ycr
ington and they will be added to the
World's Fair collection.
In speaking of the proposed exhibit.
Monk said:
ST. LOUIS.Â» Sept. 19.â That the stage
driver of the pioneer days played an. im
portant part in the development of the
great West and fairly won a place in the
national history is evidenced by the deep
interest that has been aroused by the.an
nouncement that the Hank Monk relics
will be exhibited by Nevada at th.2
World's Fair. St. Louis.
It has been announced that J. A. JTer
ington, Nevada's executive commis
sioner, has secured the old coach that
Hank Monk droveâ the one in which he
took Horace Greeley into Placervllle."on
time"â and will use it at the World's Fair
as the coach of state for Nevada.
In "Roughing It," Mark Twain's flrat
famous book, Hank Monk was Immortal
ized by the humorist, when he describee!
the celebrated drive by which Hank Monk
got the great editor into Placervllle in
time to keep a lecture engagement.
Mr. Clemens, at his picturesque Quarry
Farm, in Elmlra, N. Y., remembers well
the thrilling early days, and when infor
mation reached him of Yerington's in
tention to exhibit the Hank Monk re'.K-s
he said:
This announcement brings a weight of years
down ui>on my head. Thoee two names carry
me back thirty-two years â Hank Monk and
Verington. I think i wus present wnen ihe
watch was civtn to Monk, but one cannot ba
very sure of thing:* that happened In such an
cient times. I am only sure that I knew
Monk a little, and thai I knew lenngtun's
father well. I made one trio with Monk In
that old stase. I wish I could be in St. Louis
on my day next June and take one ride with
his ghest.

Tho commanderies of the Golden -State,
under the guiding hand of the Grand Com
mandery of this jurisdiction, are prepar
ing to extend a most generous and hos
pitable welcome to their fraters and their
friends from foreign jurisdictions and
they propose to make the coming triennial
conclave tho most famous ever recorded
In the annals of, Templar encampments.
The committee has ordered a souvenir
badge, that for beauty surpasses any
previously got up, and, as one of the
prominent members of the order said a
few days since, "When California Tem
plars say that they will do something
they are going to do it, and nothing will
stop them."
A feature of the many brilliant events
that are scheduled for the week is the
series of competitive drills, for which very
elaborate plans have been formed.
Trophies which will represent the finest
creation of the Jewelers' art and amount
in the aggregate to nearly $25,000, the larg
est amount every set aside for such a
purpose, will excite the ambition of com
peting commanderies and drill crops and
prove an Inspiration for excellence in drill.
"For each event in this competitive
series." said Captain Reuben P. Hurlburt,
chairman of the committee in charge of
the drills, "there will be three prizes, and
winners will have a chance to select ac
cording to merit, the best having first
choice."
A circular of Instructions in regard to
the competitive series has already been
sent to each commandery and a com
plete schedule of the movements will be
forwarded so as to reach the commandant
of each competing corps not less than
ninety days before starting for San Fran
cisco. It is proposed to classify the com
peting corps into three classes â first, drill
corps attending and competing from east
of the Rocky Mountains; second, corps
from west of the RocKies, and third, the
corps of San Francisco California No. 1
and Golden Gate No. 16. The competi
tive drill befween California and Golden
Gate CorDH will not be Identified with
the drills In which the corps from, abroad
will participate. These two Californian
corps will not compete for any of the
honors nor for any of the prizes that
will be offered to awaken the Interest
and enthuse the visiting drill corps. The
prize for which these two will contest
will be a special one, distinct from all
other trophies. Each drill corps in the
United States and in Canada has been
advised of what will' be done and an ap
peal has been made that each enter into
the contests.
DRILL AT INGLESIDE.
The first. to signify an intention to en
ter into tho competition is the drill corps
of Columbia Commandery of Washing
ton, D. C, which will come to this city
forty strong under the leadership of Com
mandant Wj B. Walker, one of the prom
inent citizens of the Distrfct of Columbia.
One of the distinguished visitors who will
accompany thla corps will be .Rear Ad
miral W. S. Schley (retired). Others who
will come with this organization are P.
IJ. Raymond, past potentate of the Shrin
ers; Judge Pratt and R. B. Nixon, a
thirty-third degree Mason and financial
secretary of the United States Senate.
This corps will come by. special train.
For conclave week the new St. Francis
Hotel has been secured for the Boston
and the Louisville commanderies. Tho
Palace has been engaged and all the large
hotels, public and private, have been se
cured for the accommodation of the great
concourse of people who will come here
withJthe Templars.
As it is Intended to have the competi
tive drill on an extensive scale, Ingleslde
track has been engaged for that pur
pose and It will be put In first class con

splendor surpass any that has been-; held
anywhere in the past fifteen years.-'-'From
letters that have been received here it
appears the interest is intensifying
tnroughout the country.
HOSPITABLE WELCOME.
In September, 1904, and for months
past the several commanderles and the
driil corps in various parts of ths grand
Jurisdiction have been making prepara
tions for the coming event. The Knights
are not of the class that delay until the
last moment in arranging for what is to
come, but they plan long in advance and
when the time comes they are ready to
move without bothering with the details,
which, when delayed, often cause great
inconvenience. To show what Interest is
being taken, even at this early date, it
is necessary only to state that at this
time commanderies have already secured
hotel accommodations to the number of
5000 people, which, of course, includes
hotels and private boarding-houses for the
Sir Knights and their families. From ad
vices that have already been received by
the executive committee in this city it is
safe to assert that In the grand parade
that T.ill take place during conclave week
not less than 10,000 Sir Knights in mag
nificent and costly uniforms will appear
in line. It is expected that this encamp
ment will not only eclipse the one that

F. O. Johanson keeps a hotel at 6 How
ard street. Being a man of cleanly hab
ita, he naturally desires to keep his house
In cood order. It being close to the wa
ter front, he tries to keep It "ship shape."
How to do so with a coal bunker next
door is a hard task, and because Johan
son has failed his boarders are leaving
him. One cannot run a hotel with profit,
even on the water front, without board
ers, and that is why "Mine Host" Johan
son has for the present assumed the role
of a litigant. Yesterday he filed a suit
for damages against the Western Fuel
Company, owner of the bunker adjoining
the Johanson House.
Johanson asks the court to award him
$5000. the amount of damage he claims
to have suffered because of the presence
of the bunkers. He says that day and
right, without regard to his or the needs
of his guests, the company persists in
hoisting huge buckets full of coal over
the bunkers and dropping the contents
a distance of sixty feet. Clouds of black,
choking dust, says Johanson, arise from
the bunkers after the fall of each bucket
and this dust enters the hotel through'

every door, crack and window In the place.
It dirties all his dishes, he. says, and
spoils the immaculate whltness of the
sheets and bedding he furnishes 1.1s
guests, which, he says, has given the
Johanson House a reputation for clean
liness second to none on the water front.
Not only does the dust do all this, says
Johanson. but it renders excessive the
laundry bills of his guests, with the re
sult that they are all leaving him and
seeking rest, food and recreation In places
where they can have their meals served
minus coal dustâ where they can be as
sured a clean shirt for a holiday and
where they can sleep without fear of be

TO BE HEARD TO-DAY
The press dispatches brought necessar
ily incomplete accounts of the proceed
ings of the American Mining Congress.
The principal interest naturally centered
in the advocacy of a national department
of mines and mining. The assembly in
dorsed the proposition, but unless some
good work is done the department is still
afar off. An authorized copy of the ad
dress of President John H. Richards has
been received. It is interesting as con
furnish some sround *Â«**Â«/Â»'!"*
tion of the mining Industry of the United
States. In a certain way these reasons
fu?nlsh some ground for work for future
P The e tfxt of one part of President Rich
ards'. address is as follows:
This congress must be the means of finally
of S a K r?c O U ltur a e and the recently created depar -
ment of commerce and labor. Â¦ - 1
â¢ew department was bound to come and we
hall its coming as a healthy manifestation of
The tended deferred to, became to that ex
tent it strengthens a weak point In our sys
tern of administrative government. But we
will say that mines and mining
should ha "e a. precedence; that the raw mate
rials which- are the first condition and indis
pensable prerequisite of all manufactures all
commerce all prosperity, and all civilization.
oS by 'right to have prior consideration at
the hands of our law K lvers in the Â«Â»tablUh
ment of these Industrial departments. Tho

Governments are placed In close touch with
thÂ°Â« great and Important source of produc
llon fnd thereby enabled to Intelligently carry
ouWans for Its development and protection.
, Â« Â« j t j s these powerful and efficient gov
ernmental organizations, whose energies are
being already directed Into industrial channels.
ih-It the United States must cope with In Its
.future striving 'lor the world's trade so that
it must become more and more the business
of this Government to equip its people to fight
their industrial .battles.
The department of agriculture has broad
nnÂ«l irarkets by . the systematic work of Its
aSentstn foreign countries: it has diffused
and popularized much needed information con
cerning crops, soils and tillage; it has assisted
the cultivator in fighting the p^sts that de
stroy his crops. It has invested agriculture
with a new dignity and helped to make It a
scientific occupation. We say that the mining
prospector has Just as good a right to scien
tific Information from the Government concern
ing mineral formations, the character of var
ious ores and their proper treatment for he.
too is a producer of the raw material that
Is a corditlon of all resultant production, and
this cooperation on the part of the Government
may give him just the Industrial chance that
: he needs. The farmer can get a bulletin from
the agricultural department that will tell him
how to supply -lacking ingredients in the soil,
and we assert that the average working miner,
the man who is, trying to make tne most of
-his Industrial -chances. - the intelligent producer
and good citizen that we all know, has an
equally Just claim to a bulletin from a depart
ment of mines and mining, supplying him
with the technical information in his Indus
trial field that may be vital to his success.
RICHARDS' ADDRESS.
The case against the concessions â¢will be pre

brothers have nearly completed their pipe

The maple room was very attractive

grouped. Around the walls was placed
the floral display.
The exhibit of George A. Pope of Bur

SCORES A SUCCESS
Chief Wittman expressed his regret that
the ordinance had been declared invalid,
as it would handicap the department and
result in an increase of drugg-ing and
robbing men of money and valuables. The
ordinance was a help to the department,
as it enabled officers who knew crooks
resorting to' the aid of drugs i in robbing
men to arrest them for having "knock
out drops" in their possession and send
them to jail for six months.
In the McClaln and Lorensen cases the arti
cle mentioned in the ordinances was definitely
described and the use of it was made criminal,
while under this ordinance the use, namely, the
possession of an indefinite number of articles
the great majority of which are clearly capable
of innocent use. constitutes the crime. I am
unable to find any correspondence between the
Lorensen and McClaln cases and the ordinance
here in question, and, under the law, as I un
derstand It, and the decision of the Supreme
Court in the casp of Wong Hane and thfl
Keamy case, I am satisfied that .the ordinance
upon which the complaint herein is based la
void and consequently that said complaint
charges no public offense.
Under this ordinance every assayer and met
allurgist would be guilty of crime in conducting
his profession, for countless chemicals falling
under the ban of this ordinance are required by
them for use, and must be kept In their posses
sion. In fact, there is hardly any business that
could be conducted without a violation of this
ordinance. Every ' restauranteur. grocer or sa
locn-keeper who has In stock spirits or wines of
any ktnd: every hospital where anesthetics and
narcotics of all kinds are kept; every home
opathic physician who carries such drugs with
him on his rounds of visits; every dentist in
whose office such drugs are a necessity, and
hundreds of others would daily violate this ordl.
nance. Bvery retail dealer or household pos
sessed of colognes or perfumes; every barber
shop using bay rum or perfume, and every dye
ing establishment could be conducted only in
violation of law.
It must be an extraordinarily exceptional case
that will permit a court to read into a statute
or ordinance what Is not therein contained. It
is the province of the legislative department of
the Government to legislate and of the courts
to pass upon the legality and constitutionality
of legislation. Courts have no power to legis
late. .
The Police Department sustained a se
vere blow yesterday when Judge Cook
rendered a decision declaring that the
ordinance passed on December 19, 1900,
known as the "knockout drops" ordi
nance, was invalid.
The cuestion arose on a writ of ha
beas corpus for the release of Allen Dale,
alias Baliard. an ex-convict, who was ar
rested for having ' "knockout drops" in
his possession. The writ was granted and
the prisoner was ordered released.
It was claimed for the petitioner that
under the ordinance, no criminal Intent
being required, every citizen would be
guilty of a misdemeanor who has in his
possession a bottle of spirituous liquor,
alcohol or any other of the thousands
of liquids and drugs that tend to produce
stupor or insensibility.
The other side contended that under the
decisions of the Supreme Court in the
cases of Lorensen and McClain the court
should read into this ordinance the words
"with criminal intent"
The Judge held as follows:
The Firmstone & Richards mining prop
erty In Plumas County, situated near
Greenevllle, has been sold to the Droege
brothers. The Plumas Independent says:
With this property and the New York and
Plumas Gold Mining Co. in operation, with
the Indian Valley and Southern Eureka a
future certainty, Greenville gives promise of
becoming a very lively town, situated not
more than three miles from those mines.
The Redding Free Press says:
The Bennincton group of mines, adjoining
the bis Iron Mountain mine on the north and
east, has been purchased by the Plttsburg and
Mount Shasta Gold Mining and Milling Com
pany of Pittsburg. Pa. The property was sold
by John Kean of Shasta. The company has
nothing to do with the Mount Shasta mine. It
proposes to immediately begin the extensive
development of the Bennington group, which
coneists of nine claims, four of which are the
well-known Dorset, Yorktown, Bennington and
King. The Little Nellie formerly belonged to
the group, but it is not included In the pur
chase. The ore will be extracted and shipped
to the Mountain Copper Company's smelter at
Keswick for treatment. The Iron Mountain
Railroad passes over the property and there
will be very little expense in getting the ore
to the smelter. There Is an abundance of
water and timber on the property.
Peter Walters, the discoverer of the Golden
Cross mine, is back from a long trip on the
desert, where he fcund some new 'niter fields.
The sami>les he shows are rich.
Very likely work will be resumed on the
Julian district's largest tunnel, otherwise
known as the Oro Blanco tunnel, r When
it is completed it will tap the Kentucky
S and the Cincinnati Belle mines. The
present tunnel depth Is 900 feet. Other
mines have been drained by it.
The Los Angeles Jurrnal publishes the
following concerning the alleged discov
ery of new niter beds:

According to the Scott Valley Advance
the King Solomon group of mines in Sis
klyou County, four miles from Cecilville
and near the South Fork of the Salmon
River, will be largely developed by the
new owners, who are Eastern men. Work
Â¦will be resumed on the McKinley mine,
on Humbug Creek. Many prospectors
are searching through Siskiyou County
for mines. A group of claims has been
located by John H. Harris of Etna at the
headwaters of Taylor Creek, fourteen
miles from Etna. Work is favorably pro

Nugget quartz claims Â¦ in the Callahan
mining district.
The shutdown is but temporary, and you are

sumed a little later they will be more vigor
ously prosecuted than they havÂ« been for two
years past. The directors" are to meet in San

ing a time will be definitely decided upon
when work will recommence, and ways and
means will be provided, btth Superintendent
Abadie and Foreman John Tredlnnick are to
attend the meeting; as their counsel on certain
points la desired. The Champion Company has
somÂ« very valuable ground, notably in the
Merrlfleld and Nevada City locations, but it will
take money to open them up properly. I am
not in a position to go into details, but you
can oublish that there is no likelihood of the
properties lylngr dormant more, than a few
weeks at most. Â¦
Nevada County miners are much inter

received severe lacerated wounds of the
scalp and risht arm. He was removed
to the City and County Hospital, where
Dr. McElroy stanched the flow of blood
and dressed the wounds. Had It not been
for the timely assistance of an employe
who dragged Sternitzky from under the

THÂ«E VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.,
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal Is the
safest and most efficient disinfectant and, pur-
ifier In nature, but few realize Its value when
taken Into the human system for the same
cleansing: purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more you take
of It the/ better; It Is -not a drug at all. but
simply absorbs the^jases and Impurities always
present In the stomach and Intestines and car- i
rles them out of the system.
Charcoal Bweetens the breath after smoking,
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
complexion, It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious eases which collect
In the stomach and bowels; It disinfects tha
mouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one form or an-
other, but probably the best charcoal and the
most for the money Is In Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal, and other harmless an-
tiseptics in tablet- form or rather in the form
of large pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed. with honey. â¢ :
. The dally use of J these . lozenges will soon
tell "in a much improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of It is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinued use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal' says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
sorbent Lozenges to all patients suffering from
'gas in stomach and bowels, and to clear the
conu-lexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is greatly bene-
fited -by the dally use of them: they cost but
twenty-flve cents a box at drug stors. -and al-
though' in some sence a 'patent preparation, yet
I beheie I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Absorbent Loxenges than In' any of
I Â«K. nr.llnarv charcnaY tablet*." â¢

If the board finds this to be the fact
the matter will have to be abandoned so
far as these proceedings are concerned.
Should the board determine that the le
gal number of signers remains upon the
petition the Supervisors will have the
power to reduce the size of the territory
deslred to be incorporated, and as a ma
jority of the board is unfavorable to the
scheme it may be that the limits will be
so contracted that they will contain less
than the requisite 503 inhabitants.
As to whether the territory shall be in
corporated or not is for the electors cf
that territory to decide at an election
called for the purpose of submitting this
very question. The board cannot say
that the territory shall or shall not in
corporate. It can say, however, how
much cf this territory shaJl be allowed
to become a municipality, and having this
power it ls understood that it win be ex
ercised to such an extent that incorpora
tion will be out of the question.
Those favorable to tho proceedings re
alize that It is possible that the board
may take such action and intimate that
the- matter may be taken into court to
determine the extent of the board's pow
ers. The present cutiook is for a stormy
session on Monday.
REDWOOD CITY. Sept. 19.â The pro
ceedings for the incorporation of the 'town

A large number of persons who orig
inally signed the petition for incorpora
tion have withdrawn their names there
from and those who are opposing the in
corporation claim that with these names
taken off less than the number required
by law remain.

Claim Is Made That

A SEARCHLIGHT throwing a beam
of light of the almost inconceiv
able Intensity of 316,000,000 candle
power Is one of the latest me
chanlco-scientiflc . achievements.
It is the work of Schuckert & Co., Nu
remberg, Germany. It has a diameter of
six feet six Inches and is fitted with an
Iris shutter, half-closed, as shown in the
accompanying picture.
This searchlight is electrically con
trolled by two levers, one of which gov
erns tbe motor mounted in the base of
the apparatus which operates the pro
jector Ir a vertical direction through a
train of gear wheels, while the other
starts or stops the electric motor which
controls the horizontal movement of the
bc-am of light.
The Iris shutter is used in order to make
the projector perfectly light-tight at any
moment desired, and it operates similarly
to this type of shutter as applied to mod
ern cameras. The leaves of the iris dia
phragm slide within a fixed diaphragm lo
calÂ«-d In the axis of the ray of light and
provided -with a fold. On some of the
German searchlights an apparatus known
as a "double dltperser" is provided in or
der to convert concentrated light rapidly
Into diffused light. This arrangement
consists of two parallel systems of cylin
drical lenses, which may be slid against !
one another, whereby the angle of disper- !
sion of the emitted ray can be varied at
will. By means of this apparatus the
angle of dispersion of the light can be
varied within limits of from two degrees ;
to forty-five degree*; If desired.
A new form of electric flashlight- has
lately been installed by the same concern '
In the lighthouse tower at Heligoland.
The searchlights or projectors used In
this installation are combined, as shown
in the accompanying views taken from
the Scientific American."
There ere three lower searchlights, ar
ranged 120 degrees apart, and another
mounted upon the top, all operated auto
matically and driven by electric motors.
The carbons, which art- fed by automatic
mechanism, arc placed In a horizontal no--
Fition, as is usual wjth most large search
lights. The intensity of the light is 30.000,
000 candle-power as a minimum, and the
maximum current used is 100 amperes.
The light flashes occur every five seconds
and they remain in one position anly one
tenth of a second.
The three searchlights mounted on the
lower revolving platform 120 degrees apart
have mirrors twenty-nine Inches In diam
eter and utilize a direct current of thirty
four amperes each, the platform revolv
ing at the rate of four revolutions per
minute. The current is supplied to the
tower lights by a lead iron-armored cov
ered cable connected with the power sta
tion. The powrr plant consists of two
steam engines directly connected to dy
namos of 216 ampere? capacity at a pres
sure of soventy-five volts.
This new electric beacon is to take the
place of the old petroleum light that so
long flashed out its danger signals at the

glacier, where its breadth is 2130 feet and
the height of its service above 8ea level
fuSO feet, a boring in the middle reached
rock at a depth of 500 feet. Taken along
with measurements of rate of movement,
surface melting and temperature, the ex
periment enabled the following conclu
sions to be drawn: First, the temperature
of the ice is at the melting point through
out the whole macs on the. tongue of the
glacier; second, the bed of the glacier is
trough-shaped; third, the Ice. moves more
slowly at the bottom than at the surface.
The bore holes were filled up with pieces
of wood, which will serve for many years
to come as Indexes of the rate of move

A special commission appointed by the
French Admiralty has been experimenting
with a view to obtaining conclusive data
as to what would be the effect on a bat
tleship when the guns in the fore turret
were fired. The battleship Henri IV was
selected for the purposes of these tests.
Sheep were cT^rlbuted at the posts which
in action would be occupied by the mem
bers of the crew serving the smaller guns
over which the big turret guns fire. After
the discharge the sheop were examined,
and though found to be stunned, were
otherwise uninjured. It was therefore
concluded . that as men have a greater
power of resistance than sheep, the gun
ners in the turret would experience no
Eerioua harm through the firing of the
guns. â¢Â¦;Â¦ Â¦Â¦''.';>
Sir William Ramsay, who, in conjunc

calculations show that the air contains

there is one part by weight df krypton

Henry Frowde has just acquired a se
ries of drawings on wooctmade by George
Crulkshank nearly fifty years ago to Illus
trate "Pilgrim's Progress." These draw
ings have never yet been published, and
they Â¦will form the chief feature of an edi
tion de luxe of Bunyan's masterpiece,
which Is to be Issued from the Oxford
University press In ths autumn. Some of
the drawings were cut on wood under the
artist's own direction, and others are now
being similarly prepared. Each is to be
printed from a separate plate on Japanese
paper.
For upward of thirty years these draw
ings have been in the possession of a
well-known collector, who was a friend
of Cruikshank. and they are said to be
thoroughly characteristic of the artist's
genius.

of forthcoming books chief interest at

logical rather than a llferary character.
This book, which la entitled "The Blood
Royal of Britain." Is announced by
Messrs. Jack of Edinburgh and London.
It contains the names of nearly 12,000 per
sons now living who are said to be de
scended from Edward IV and Henry VII
of England and James III of Scotland.
No fewer than 35.000 lines of descent are

Ruvtgny. and his volume is a folio of
more than 600 pages.
1 ho supposition that the grant to a syndicate is prompted by a revulsion from the policy of
governmental construction of railways is rendered the more probable because the finances of Aus
tralia are by no means so bad as have been reported, and it would not be difficult for the common
wealth to obtain the money required for the work if the government desired. Mr. Wise, Attorney
General for New South Wales, was recently in London, and while there gave a very reassuring ac
count of Australian finances, saying among other things : "It is wholly misleading and indeed un
true to say that any Australian State has been unable to meet its interest obligations without fresh
lxDrrowing. That there should be any serious discussion about the solvency of the Australian States
seems like a fantastic dream to any one who knows Australia. The State of New South Wales, with
which I am more immediately connected, pays annually in interest Â£2,793,000. The money has been
borrowed for public works which return a iiet revenue of Â£1,792,000. That leaves Â£1,000,000 a year
unprovided for by returns from public works. The public works have been used for developing land,
a great deal of which belongs to the State. As the crown lands give a net revenue of Â£1,200.000,
there is a clear Â£200,000 of profit from the loan expenditure over and above the interest charge."
â¢ 'Â¦ As Mr. Wise was in London as an agent of an Australian State it may be that his statement is
much more favorable to Australian finance than the facts justify, but when every allowance is made
for the partiality ofta politician there remains a good assurance that financially Australia is sound, and
consequently her resort to American methods of railroad building can mean nothing more than an
admission that State construction is inexpedient. . If that lesson be thoroughly learned, some
thing like a new era will open for the country, and the prosperity of the future will be far greater
than that of the past. , . ,
In seeking to bring about the construction of the road by a syndicate of capitalists instead of
by the government itself, the Australians give evidence of having profited by. their experience with
governmental ownership and operation of railroads. It seems they have had enough of that sort of
thing and are not eager for more. Many advantages arc expected to result from the opening of a line
across the island, and the people are willing to pay a big price for it, but it seems they prefer to pay
the price in an extraordinary land grant rather than to borrow money and go into a new socialistic
experiment on so vast a scale.
DESPITE the ill results of the prolonged drouth that affected nearly the whole country, de
spite the disturbed conditions of labor and capital, despite the increasing rate of taxation
and the slow progress of industry, the people of Australia are going ahead as boldly as if
there were no defect in their social organism and no obstacle ahead in the path of their
development. While the conservatives of the world have been waiting to hear of a collapse of their
enterprises and a bankruptcy of some of their States, they are making preparations for new ventures
and for the settlement of new areas of their unoccupied land.
The most important undertaking now under consideration by the Australians is that of the
construction of a railway which^with lines now in operation, will connect the Indian Ocean with the
South Pacific. The road will approximate 1200 miles in length and is* estimated to cost about
$30,000,000. Unlike most of tjie railway building in Australia the new road is not to be constructed
directly by the government, but by a syndicate to which the government will give a grant
of about 90,000,000 acres. The plan appears to be similar to that long ago adopted in this country
for the promotion of railway building across wide distances of unsettled territories.
A recent review of the enterprise in describing the country to be traversed by the projected
line says: "At the present time this vast area is undeveloped and almost without population. There
are not more than 5000 persons and these are mostly Asiatics. But much of the land is said to be ex
cellent. In a pamphlet issued by the government the scheme is declared to be 'a magnificent oppor
tunity for the capitalist to embark in one of the few truly great undertakings with a golden future in
prospect yet left to the Avorld to be achieved.' It is said to contair. some of the best pastoral land in
the country, a large proportion of which is admirably adapted to tropical agriculture. * * * Be
sides the land itself the concession carries to the contractors the right to all the gold and other
metals and minerals that may be discovered in the principality made over to them."

It is interesting that the enemies of President Roosevelt charge the fall of these air-founded
combinations to him and to the* vigor with which he has enforced the anti-trust laws. While it is
apparent that they collapsed of their own weakness, no or e would bteme the President if lie Iielped
the matter on by some vigorous kicks. The sort of deal represented by those water-logge I combi
nations is the most vicio :j form of speculation. It exists only in good times, when the public is in
a buoyant and optimistic temper, and appears as a disease of surfeit, like farcy in a horse. v If they
succeed in floating until a panic comes upon the country they prolong the pains of liquidation and
the period of starvation, so that it is just as well that they are collapsing now.
As for the President, his friends the people will take care of him. The trust organs, the New
York Sun and Harpers', are saying that every man who has lost in the fall of these fog houses will
fight Roosevelt. Very well, then every man who wants no more such mushroom sauce served up on
the country's business will stand by the President, and as there are more sensible men than fools in
the country the President will not suffer. The country has probably seen the last of actual organiza
tion of that kind of trusts, though they will long survive in the perfervid oratory of Lentz and
Tomjohnson and in the illuminated pages of those organs of sweetness and light which get their
inspiration and their fodder from Air. William Randolph Hearst.
Sure enough the people are robbed, but only that part of them that tried to get in and rob
others, for the great majority of the trusts organized two and three years ago have failed, and it is
estimated that four-fifths of them are in the hands of receivers to be wound up. When the" wreck is
complete it will be found that a very few combinations of capital have survived, and these because
there is some natural or valid commercial reason why they should. Those that fail go down be
cause they were not legitimate, but were mere over-capitalizations of unprofitable properties, put un
der the management of unskilled men and destined to fail. The only profit had out. of them was ob
tained by the promoter, provided there was actual money enough in the till to* pay his commission.
The loss goes to the fools who bought these stocks.
It is a great and gratifying evidence of the solidity of the business of the country that the
tumbling of four-fifths of these champignon castles has made no evil impression upon the financial
situation. By a natural metastasis some slight transfer of the disease has been carried over to legiti
mate stocks, which have suffered a decline for which there was no inherent reason. But this will soon
pass away. ,
TIME was, and not long ago, when the rapid organization of trusts, capitalized into the bil
lions, was viewed with alarm and held up as evidence that the country was going to the bow
wows. Every article of use or beauty was apparently going into trusts, from toothpicks
to beef, oil, water and wine; all were bound to become monopolized. Trust stocks were put
on Wall street to be taken by the public, and investors leap-frogged each other-to get at them. For
this the anti-trust shriekers were mostly to blame. They loudly insisted that every trust was a get
rich-quick scheme that was sure to succeed and gild itself on both sides by robbing the people, and
the people who wanted some of that bought the stock.

REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 19.â The Board
of Supervisors will on Monday consider
the bids for the new County Courthouse
building. Only two bids have been pre
sented, one by the Amcrican-Hawuiian
Engineering and Construction Company
for $132,845 and the other by William Pca
ccck for $142,259. These bids aro both in
excess, of the cost as estimated by the
architects. Dodge & Dollivcr, their price
being $125,000.
The difference between the bids and
architects' figures is attributed to tho in
crease in the price of labor and materials
since the time, some months ago, â¢ Â¦when
the estimated cost was made. It Is
thought the board will accept the loweet
bid or modify the plans in order to bring
the cost down to $125,000.

of JS51 on January 30, 1902; ?418 on April
?G. 1902, and $842 on October 8, 1902. The

STATE SENATOR
IS UNDER ARREST
Tork associated banks last week -ivas the
close correspondence between the de
crease of cash and tho loss in this item
as estimated upon the traceable move
ments of money during the week, the
official statement showing a deduction ot
J4.3tt7.000, while the estimates indicated
a loss of $4,523,600. This decrease in cash
was chiefly caused by absorptions by the
sub-treasury on account of the fiscal and
other operations. The customs payments
were large, amounting to $3,471,835, and
tho receipts by the treasury through
banks for those of their correspondents
which were retiring circulation were
fl.ffiO.OOO, while another extraordinary re
ceipt by the sub-treasury was $600,000
for acount of Pacific roads. These several
payments therefore aggregated $5,997,000,
and the offsetting receipts by the banks
from the sub-treasury were comparatively
small. Tho net Ios3 to the banks through
the sub-treasury absorptions was $4,155,
400. There was also a loss which, how
ever, was not large, caused by the Inte
rior movement, this resulting In a de
crease of $l,66G,G00 in cash. The receipts
of $1,258,400 new gold aided in reducing
the net decrease in cash for the week to
$4,623,600 as shown above. The deposits
of the banks fell off $8,713,300, which
was only $190,000 less than the sum. called
for the loss of cash and the reduction of
loans, therefore the statement very near
ly balanced. The required reserve was di
minished $2,178,325 through the decreased
deposits and deducting this sum. from the
Iofs of cash leaves $2,198,575 as the reduc
tion in surplus reserves. The loans were
reduced $4,527,000 during the week. This
was probably partly due to the liquida
tion of speculative accounts on the Stock
i Exchange caused by the somewhat unsel
i tling fall in steel and other shares. The
decrease in loans also resulted from the
operations of the Bank of Commerce and
the Western National Bank, which are
on the eve of merger. One feature was
an increase of 5063,100 in circulation fol
lowing a gain of $327,400 in this item in the
previous week. It may be noted that the
loans of the banks now exceed the depos
its by $12,573,600, the largest since the mid
dle of July. This, however. Is not an un
favorable factor. The daily averago of
clearings for the week was $170,000,000,
against $155,000,000 in the previous week,
reflecting more active business. Com
paring changes In the item of loans, six
of tin" larger banks indicate a loss of
$3,800,000 and the two institutions above
named show a decrease of $6,100,000. Five
of the banks lost $2,100,000 in cash, one of
which alone reduced this item by $2,300,000.

SAUL.T STE. MARIE, Mich., Sept. 13.-
The shut-down of the Consolidated Lake
Superior Company, throwing 3300 men out
of employment, has caused a panic in ttie
Canadian Soo, which is in a worse condi
tion than ever before In its history. Many
persons arc preparing to leave- that city
at once, while* merchants are curtailing
their stocks and preparing In every way
to get through the winter in the best pos
sible manner with the least expense. The
action of tho police department in swear
ing in a large number of deputies, includ
ing all tho conductors and motormen of
the street railway lines, has served to
stir up the anxiety of the people.
A special train left laat night up the
Algoma Central Railroad to bring in the
1600 or more men employed in the woods
and mines. Not a man of them will have
a penny with which to buy food or lodg
ing. The company will pay the men in
checks, which will be good for nothing
until money has been raised and depos
ited. The feelinpr ot the people Is that
with so large a number of men turned
loose in the city, hungry and with no
money, the situation will ko dangerous.
A guard has been placed around the of
fice of the paymaster of the company and
the people are making desperate efforts
to arrange means for feeding and hous
ing the men until they can be taken out
of town.

to answer the charge, because it had not
been filed by the legal guardian of the
boy, but by Thomas Kelly,, his uncle.
Langdon was not prepared to say

BOARD TO STOP
HEAVY BLASTING
Complaint of Potrero
Residents Is Pound
Justifiable.
Assistant Chief Engineer Mooser fllefi
yesterday with tho Board of Public Works
a report resardlng a complaint of prop
erty owners about the blasting in that
portion of the Potrcro district between
Indiana and Tennessee streets and south
erly from Eighteenth street. Tho report
recites that heavier blasting is being done
than should bo permitted, and It should
be required that excessive charges and
the simultaneous firing of the same be
stopped at once.. .The. report continues:
Excavation iÂ» pott beinz made in this dis
trict by tlire* contractors. E. Lantry & Sona.
the Iteal Estate and Development Company
and ths Southern Pacific Company. As far as
can be learned no complaint is made about
the work being: Upne by the Ueal Estate and
Development Company and the Southern Pa
cific Cuipoanv. There is. however,' very gen
eral complaint as to the Masting done by LÂ»n
try & Sox:s and they axe made with Rood
cauec. , .
Lantry & Sons are using 8tÂ«>am snovcis ana
loosening tlie material by hearjr blastln?.
Charges are placed In close proxtmlty to eacn
other and fired simultaneously with an elec
tric batten-. The result is a aevere lhaklne
of the ground, the explosion frequently throw
ine showers of rock, some of which falls *>n
houses .several hundred feet away. The Bhak
lwrMs so severe as to break window*, rack
buildings, crack ar.a break plaster on same, to
Bay nothing of the nervous shock suffered by
occupants of the bulldliws.
Other contractors workinc in the district
complain of showers of rock thrown on their
workmen. A resident on Tennessee street, be
tween Nineteenth and Twentieth, was struct
by a piece of falling rock, and another resi
dent on the Same block says^ that rocks wcigh
liiff four pounds have been thrown into bulld
ii.gs occupied by him.
The Board of Works, acting on the rec
ommendation contained in tho report,
will probably order the heavy blasting to
cease and that It be limited to reasonable
charges of explosives.

The efforts of Chief of Police Wittman
to prevent the blockading of streets by
arrtfctlns the members of the Socialist
party who nlshtly deliver harangues on
the political and other questions of\the
day on the street corners are in the fu
ture to be obstructed by the 'orators and
their followers. Yesterday a suit for an
injunction restraining the Chief from
making any more arrests of street ora
tors; was filed by a number of 'members
â¢f the Socialist party. They claim that
the police arc acting without- warrant or
legal right In making the orrests.
The s"it in brought by Gustavo von
Braun! William Costley, G. S. Hclmes,
Leslie Brown, Arthur. M.. Lewis. Lena II.
Lewis, G. W. Woodbey, J. E. Wyhs. I.
Shenkan and. P. J. Cowley. Their com
plaint is a lengthy document and recites
the fact that for the last three months
tho Chief of Police and his officers have
been making numerous arrests of street
speakers who are affiliated with the So
cialist party. They.- claim that neither
he nor " his ' officers have any right to
disturb them in their public meetings or
methods of informing the public at largo
of the condition of affairs, political or
otherwise, in this city and the country
at largo. They say they are almost con
tinually annoyed and harassed by the
Chief and his men, despite the fact that
the Police Judges refuse to convict them
and thnt the Superior Court haB decided
that a street speaker is no more guilty
of obstructing the streets than is a mer
chant who attracts crowds to the front
Of his store by an attractive window dis
play.
A few months a eo Judge Seawell ren
dered a decision on the point raised In
tho present case. He lupued an Injunc
tion on comr>lalnt of .William Costley,
one of the plaintiffs In yrEterday's ac
tion, restraining- the police from inter
fering with him in his capacity as street
orator, holding that Costley did no more
to obstruct the streets by talking In such
a. manner as to attract a crowd than did
the merchant who attracted a crowd to
his store bv making an attractive dis
play in his window. Judge Seawell also
said in his opinion that to countenance
the actions of the police. would be to place
a premium, on dullness, "for." he said,
"the arrest of a man whose sneech pos
sessed sufficient merit to attract a crowd,
simply because of the presence- of tho
crowd.- would mean that a man but a
few feet away whose speech attracted
but is. few. or none .at. all. could talk as
long as he pleased."
The joint Committee on Finance, Health
and Streets of the Board of Supervisors
held a meeting yesterday and adopted a
caustic' report for presentation to the
board at to-morrow's meeting strongly
disapproving the action of the Board of
Health and the Board of Public Works
in raising salaries of subordinates In their
departments in defiance of the plain terms
of tho municipal budget for thÂ« present
fiscal year.
The report' further recommends to tho
board that a resolution be adopted re
questing- the Board of Health and the
Board of Works to rescind their action in
raising salaries on their own account, and
to use th<Â» money for the specific purposes
designated in the budget.
The report begins by stating that the
committee has made an exhaustive Inves
tigation of the salary. ralGes, and takes
the two departments named to task for
ignoring the plain intent, both implied
and expressed, of the Supervisors In ap
propriating specific funds for the- various
municipal departments. The committee,
while realizing that the Health Board and
the Board of W<Â«rks have absolute au
thority over the expenditures of their re
epective appropriations, call3 attention to
the fact that the various sums allowed
the municipal departments were only
agreed upon after a thorough inqulry.into
the requirements, of thÂ© offices and were
based only upon their actual needs. The
report deplores the . fact that the two
boards under flre saw nt to override the
recommendations of the board as to the
disposition of public funds. '
The Health Board is also particularly
called to account for having used funds
appropriated by the Board of Supervisors
for the creation of additional positions
deemed necessary for the proper enforce
ment of sanitary regulations for tho rais
ing of salaries not contemplated by the
budget. The report concludes:
Your committee rerrets that the Board of
Supervisora has not the po-aÂ«r to repeal the
action of the Health Board and thÂ« Board of
rubllc Works in raising salaries for which no
j?rovlslon was made in the' budget. It can
only ask that thÂ« two boards named bÂ» re
quested to rescind of their own volition the
proceedings providing for raises in I eal&rleg
which this board did not countenance and tho
funds for which should bÂ«s devoted to other
purposes already designated.

Yesterday the company .had the time
checks of the men who have struck ready
for issuance, but the latter did not call
for'them, having, so it Is reported, been
advised by the strike committee not to
do. so.
F. Halton. auditor of tne U. B. R. E.,
who has charge of tne strike In the au
jsence of General -lanajjer Estes, stated
during the afternoon that another appeal
would be made to President Foster of the
road to-day ! to reinstate McDonald and If
th|Â» recuest was met with a refusal at
least SO per cent of the men still work-
Ing on the. road would to called out .uuon
day. The officials of the road claim that
they have no fear of a general strike.
Several reports received at Tiburon yes
terday, from points up the line were to
the effect that a number of new men
had joined the strikers and the committee
in. charge of the strl&e was exceedingly
Jubilant over what it considered indica
tions of a general walKout. President
Foster and the other officials of the road,
however, declared late yesterday that no
men had left the employ of the company
during the day and^that no -trouble was
being experienced in uie running of trains
and boats. President Foster said:
Reports have been given out to the effect
that we have received assurance! from various
labor organizations of San Francisco that we
can have all the men we want to take the
places of the strikers. I have had no commu
nications from the labor organizations on this
subject and the company - has made no over
tures to them regarding the filling of places.
We are, however, besieged by applicants for
work and will have little trouble In filling the
places vacated In the railroad shops when we
are prepared to do so. In any event, we do
not" purpose to reinstate Watchman McDonald,
ami umler no circumstances will we be com
pelled to confer with the United Brotherhood of
Railroad Employes or any other outside bodies
regarding how we shall conduct our business.
With all Its trains and boats operating
on schedule time and with its ability, up
to the present time, to handle freight de
livered at its wharves, the California
Northwestern Railway claims that it has
the strike on its road well in hand and
expects no further trouble. Yesterday
was a quiet one at Tiburon, a fact which
is attributed tb the desire of the men
who have quit their work to carry on
the strike in a peaceable manner and to
that' end they have taken every possible
precaution to prevent outsiders from mix
ing in their affairs and getting them Into
trouble.

CORNERSTONE IE LAID.
The three period* of California's history, be
ginning with the cesEion of this territory by
Mexico in 1Â«47. are of Interest to all Callfor
r.ians. Uegfnr.ing with the latter date we may
divide the history of the State into ! three
periods, which may be severally symbolized by
fold, wheat and fruit, which are the symbols
of our progress and prosperity. Previous to
the discover!' of gold our State attracted but
little attention from the world at large. Her
fair land had slept fcr ages unexplored under
a fur. which shone upon the rise and splendor
of thÂ« civilizations of *arth. and which had
Â¦et with the fading lights of their ruin; the
wild harbingers of spring had been yearly sung
in the wilderness unto the glories of this land,
but the advancement of other countries had
gcr.e unheeded by, and ita wild barbarism was
frÂ«-tted only by tome adventurous spirit, who
settled in the broad valleys cf the great river.-,
where the Â«moke that curled from his cabin
mingled with the untmted air of heaven and
marked the lonelinecs of his abode, and where
hi was content to drag out a monotonous ex
ist wiee, free from car*e, restraint* anil respon
sibilities of an exacting world. . But when the
excited mesyenjrers flew to the four points of
civilization, bearing messages of the discovery
of gold, drama-Itke. these scenes were changed
and, border-like, scattered the custom* of
centuries and planted that civilization' whose
eoclety and government was based upon the
unwritten laws and the instinctive justice of
the human race. Gold and silver ore typify
this ftrwt oart of California's history, j For
them the pioneers mad* their perilous Journeys;
without them our glorious State v/culd. In all
human probability, have remained unsettled for
many years, and many now prosperous Slates
lying between us ar.d the East would not yet
have galled their prepent etandlng-
Thoie who came to California in the early
days to F.eek for eold little dreamed for a mo
ment of t'.ie future destiny of our State: thr-y
came to seek for gold and did not Imagine
that the treeless valleys or the brown foothills
Tvere capable of bearire more valuable products
than tviid grasses or ths ttUJ cattle and horses
that roamed the plains: little did they think
that California would be made the granary of
the world: that the sails of commerce woull
p!y between the grrrat harbors of the Pacific
and tJie entire civilized vvcrld. May we not bs
li^ve that in their- wildest dreams they never
hellevrd that California at the bejclnninB Â°f the
tv.-T.tleth ctntury would bo situated geosraphi
rully In the center of the United States and its
Territories â the greater! nation known to
ancient or modem history â a nation that com
mands the respect and admiration of the entire
civilised world? Yet. tho germ of prosperity,

fo#tered end revered, until to-<iay our State,

EXCITING ' INCIDENTS IN THE OPENING FOOTBAU. GAME OF THE
-v' SEASON ON THE 'CAMPUS OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY BETWEEN
Â¦Â¦ THE RELIANCE AND THE. CARDINAL, ELEVENS. '
V early season's display. Reliance
and the Stanford varsity struggled la
boriously through two twenty-minuta
halves without either side scoring a point.
Long spaces of time were taken out for
rests and In vodferotrs squabbling. The
gaxno was heavy and painfully slow.
As affording a line on the present con
dition of the nucleus from which la to
be selected the Stanford eleven the con
test was of Interest. Considering the
time of the season, the men of the car
dinal seemed hi remarkably good physi
cal condition. They were aggressive in
the first half of the game and Quick to
get Into action considering that a scant
month has been spent In training bo far.
At present the team work is In a nsbu
lous stage of development, the line Is not
particularly strong at holding and serious
fumbling mars their work at critical
stages In the game.
MANY PLAYEBS TKTBD.
In the game yesterday Coach Lanagan
gave almost every man en tho ecuad a
chance to get Into the game. In fact. It
was virtually a freshman eleven which
faced Reliance In the latter part of the
last half. Either It Is too eaxly In the
season to take a snap Judgment or Stan
ford Is not going to have any. pre-emi
nently star players this year. With thÂ»
possible exception of the work of Sco
field and P. Tarpey, thers werÂ© no plays
above the ordinary. For Reliance Geiss
ler and Atkinson did some brilliant work
In advancing the ball in sharp, straight
rushes.
The game opened with the kick-off by
Stanford. Scrott sent the ball to Re
liance's 13-yard line. The sphere was run
In to the 35-yard chalk mark, where Re
liance found the line impregnable and
lost on downs. By a penalty for off-side
on the cart of Reliance and some end
runs by Dole, Stanford brought the ball
to the middle of the field.
After losing the sphere Stanford re
gained it at the 33-yard line and Sprott
tried a chance at Reliance goal by a place
kick, but went to one side. It was after
Reliance had kicked out and obtained the
ball on downs that Gelssler of the club
team did some brilliant work In straight
bucks through guard and tackle.
After covering territory which began
to advance the ball Into the cardinal side
of the field Rellanca gave up the ball
and it rested on their 20-yard line when
time was called.
BELIA2ICE FLAYS STRONGLY.
If the honors had been slightly In Stan
ford's favcr in tfie first half, they were
certainly all coming to Reliance in the
second. By the substitution of new and
raw men the cardinal team was so weak
ened that bi? Atkinson, the captain of
the club men, walked through the line
for the full distance time and again. In
the early part of the half Parker. thÂ«
Stanford fullback, made a good long punt.
Kicking was not the feature of the game
and was Indulged in but once or twics
by the Reliance men and scarcely more,
than that bv the collegians.
Near the end of the second half it was
Reliance's tnrn t<> try a goal from the
field, but at this Geissler failed signally.
The game was brought to a close with
the ball on Stanford's 13-yard line.

very little left fcr me to Â«ay. However, in ac
cepting this Klft. on behalf of .the city and
county of San Francisco, I do so with a feeling
of gratitude and pride. Gratitude for a wise
an>l noble und generous man and pride | n t h e
realization that the donor in a, pioneer.
. This is the second occasion during ray term
of office on -.vfcleh I have had the pleasure of
taking part In a dedication like thisâ onco
when another library was pre'sented by the
gentlemen who has Just preceded me and one
which has done great â¢ good , for thÂ« people
south of Market street. I mean the Fourth
street Library wjiich was donated by the lion
James D. Phelan. (Applause.) -.
Mayor Schmitz was not down on the
programme for a speech, but was called
upon by President Mann to say a few
words. The Mayor's reception was also a
cordial one.* He spoke in part as fol
lows: â¢ .' . ; tv-; ; /v>K.'s :; :
But our wants ere of a higher order than
those of the Diireer Indian and it Is one of
ths duties of a great municipality to provide
for those wants. All citizens, should vote for a
central library bulldinp, which ehall be the
feeding; Etream of the branches.
I am glad, therefore, to" congratulate the
Mission upon the substantial progress which I
<sm sure Is In store for this section of the city.
Beginning rrith the library, tho citizens cer
tainly will be as Just and as generous as its
donor an<S"irlve us a park and other Improve
ments in other sections of the city, which will
establish our worthiness to j administer the
tmrt which gocd fortune has put Into our
hands as warders by the Golden Gate.
MAYOR SCHMITZ APPLAUDED.
In the proposed bond election about to take
place th2 city will have an opportunity to'rikht
this wronc .and eee that the Mission Dolores
ehall have its share of public improvements.
The city itself will be' asked to emulate the
example of this generous citizen who has con
siderately selected the Mission for â¢ the new
branch library.
â¢ The missionary fathers were â¢ famed Â¦ for
their wisdom in selecting 6ites, and. here in
1776. within the sound of my voice,- they
founded their .mission, and we J are told that
twenty-five years, later they had under their
care 314 Indians and had raised herds of cat
tle, -horses and sheep and cultivated hundreds
of acres of wheat, barley and oats. But Amer
ican civilization supplanted - their work and it
Is now occupying their lands. Instead tt the
wigwams of S00 savases. there are now the
homes of thousands of cultivated men and
women. Although more than 125 years have
passed away, and this great city occupies the
site of these early Christian labors, there. Is
no permanent library building and no public
park. If the city fathers were as diligent as
the mission's fathers we would not be here to
expres* out wants. : .

Â¦ "There are obligations, personal and po

disregarded them I 1 would Â¦': be- an ingratc.
In due' time, and before any nomination is
made by the Republican convention I will
explain my attitude. When all the, facts
Mr. Ruef was asked to corsider this
query:
"As one of the leading promoters of the
United Republican' League, do you not
consider yourself In honor bound to "stand
by Senator Williams; John'. Lynch; "David
Rich, Thomas D.r Rlordan, "Dr. McNutt,
Henry : Ach -and others who- have given
you their confidence and support from
day to day and month to month In the
work of organizing the' Republican forces
for this campaign? Do you hold your per
sonal friendships and obligations above
your allegiance to the Republican party? 1 .'
Mr. Ruef replied: .
MAY SATISFY- CROCKER.
Mr. Ruef replied: "I-VfilJ make my posi
tion in this respect clear before tho nom
ination is made. I will not bolt'. the nom
ination. If I take part in the. convention
I will support the ticket from top to bot
tom. The attitude which. I shall take may
be acceptable" to Mr. Crocker. : Yes, I
know that the time has arrived for me to
fish or cut bait.'"
"In the event of Henry Crocker's nezn.
inatlon by the Republican convention
would you support him in- preference to
Eugene E. Schmitz, the nominee of the
Labor party?" .
A. Ruef was the only one of the active
promoters of the league that gave indirect
response. Ho replied: "My position Is a
peculiar one and I cannot at this time de
11 ne it. Again, I do not know that Mr.
Crocker Is to be the Republican rfomlnee
for Mayor."
The question was then addressed to Mr.
Ruef in this form: ' -;...,'
"Should Henry J. Crocker be nominated
for Mayor by the Republican convention
would' you "give him your- unreserved and
unqualified support?" Â¦ - Â¦â¢-â¢ .
Senator Williams. Uehry Ach, .Thomas
D, Riordan, John C. Lynch, David Rich
and Dr. McNutt replied readily and 'di
rectly in the affirmative. :">'< w .r;
At headquarters of the. TTnited Repub

favor. Hon. A. P. Williams," Dr: McNutt,
Thomas I). Rlordan, David Rich, A. "Ruef,
John 0. Lynch, Henry Ach. and. other,or
ganizers oi the league exchanged, views
relating to campaign prospects. The Call,
desiring to ascertain if Mr. Crocker's
nomination would enlist the active and
unqualified support of the active pro
moters of the league, asked Senator .Wil
liams and his associates of the organiza
tion to reply to this question:
RUEF NON-COMMITTAL. 5^.
It is common gossip in political circles
that Henry J. Crocker has developed suf
ficient strength to win the Republican
nomination for Mayor. ' There were sev
eral conferences of^.promlnent delegates
and party leaders yesterday. The aspira
tions, of Mr. Crocker were considered and
the judgment was expressed that he
would rally, the voting strength uf the
party at the polls and be elected Mayor
of San Francisco.

himself in the light ot an ingrate. There
Is no honorable course for A. Ruef qthÂ£r
than that of coming forward and pledg
ing;'to his fellow delegates in 'the' Repub-^
lican municipal convention and to his.as
sociates In the United 'Republican league
that he will support without reserve or
qualification the nominees of the Repub
lican'party In this local campaign: He
knew of his personal obligations to May
or Schmitz when he entered upon his du
ties as an organizer bf the 'league. His
withdrawal would have been all right at
that time, but the situation now Is alto
gether different. " Â¦ - ' '.â
"Ruef and I had a conversation in which
he predicted a Â¦ vote of at least 23,000 for
Schmitz. When asked his position' in the
fight he said that it was his duty to^tand
by his friend and that it was a personal
matter with him now. He sn.id he had
been a Republican and he expects always
to be such, but that at this election he
is between" two lires and surrounded by
peculiar circumstances. Ruef declared
that he thought his manhood would be
sullied should he turn agninst Schmitz
and that it was his obligation to stanii
by him." ' :
I-ast evening Mr. Ruef was questioned
on behalf cf The Call with n view of as
certaining whether he intends to loyally
support the Republican ticket or to be
tray his party ;at the eleventh hour, -.uef
was somewhat reluctant and evasive last
night, but he cannot define his position
in the campaign too soon to suit the Re
publican voters, the Republican press
and his Republican associates ' In the
United ' League. There is no longer any
middle course for him. He is one of the
organizers of the league. He. Is free to

RUNS AND HITS I5Y INNINGS.
Mike Fisher and Harry Hook ran an
other footrace after the sixth inning and
this time the magnate won out by many
feet. The score:
Then all was quiet and serene until the
seventh, when the home team managed to
squeeze in a tally with tho aid of Teeley
Raymond's hit. Irwin was passed and
Pabst and Delmas hit. With two gone
the youngster hammered the ball on the
nose and sent It far out to center field.
Irwln trotted over the rubber. Herr. who
was running for Pabst, was nailed ten
feet from the plate. In the eighth inning
the locals had tho baga full once more,
but Pabst could not make good with a
hit, so they all died and the last chance
was spoiled.
In the first inning the Senators began
to wallop the offerings of Hodson for
two runs. Casey opened the game with a
double and Hlldebrand laid down a clever
little bunt. Hodson was slow in getting
his mitts on the ball and even then he
did not handle it cleanly, so Hildy was
safe at flret. Doyle then went out and
both runners advanced a peg. Eagan
did nothing, but Town3end responded
with a drive to the outfield, which
brought both runners In and gave the
Senators a good start.
Top flies were the limit for the home
team yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park. That is, they were quite the thing
when the men were on bases. Sometimes
they would hit the ball, but not often, so
consequently the best they got was one
run out of eight hits. Score, Sacramento
4, San Francisco 1.
The Senators were much ; livelier and
they managed to clout in a run occasion
ally. They were ever on the alert to take
advantage of. any opening that might pre
sent itself and therefore to win the game
from Uncle's followers was not such a
difficult matter, though at that the Sac
ramento aggregation did not hand out a
championship articlo of ball by any
means. Â¦

by a Score of 16 to 0.
ThÂ© freshmen of the University c! Cal
ifornia won their first game of football of;
the season against the eleven from. thÂ»
Oakland High School yesterday at Berke
ley. The score was 15 for the freshznea
against a zero for the Oaklar.ders. but
that does not tell half the story, aa a I
the points were gained In the first half,
an indication that the team can't stand;
a heavy pressure or that the new men
put in to take the places of the state one*
are not as good as they ought to be.
Perhaps after another preliminary gamÂ«
or two the high school teams won't bo
able to cope with the "freshles."
It must be said of the Oakland High
School team that it put up the stiffeat
kind of an argument against odds. In
the first half the freshmen ran away with,
them, went through their line aa if it
were a sieve, ran around their ends and
had a good time generally. In tho gec
ond half the Oaklanders fought with tha
grim. - valor of a Saracen army. They
held those freshmen nearly every ttma
and whenever they laid hands on .the bail
held it for a long time. They even dirt
some running that nearly landed them
a figure on the Scoreboard.
The game' consisted of two twenty-rain
ute halves. Assistant Coach Pprcy Hall
looked after the pets of the university
and Harry Platt of the Reliance team
after the boys from Oakland, whom ha is
coaching. The elevens lined up with tho
men in the following positions:
Freshmen. Oakland.

Booth Fullback Robert*

Just after the third kttk-off occurred
the star play of the dayâ a sixty-five yard
run by Sanborn. the freshman left half.
Out of a scrimmage he shot with tho ball
and propelled himself as hard as he could
toward the Oakland goal. Two Oakland
men tackled himâ one missed, but the
other held the runner and downed him
on the fifteen-yard line, whence It was
easy enough for the "freshles" to steal
another touchdown, though they failed
to kick the goal. Kerns, the dashins
right half of the freshmen, made the
three downs. Score, 16 to 0.

THE Golden Gate race meeting,
which opened across the bay at
Emeryville track yesterday and
closed the same day, was one of
the most' unique in the history of
California racing.
It was not lacking in patronage, for
"paper" had been liberally sprinkled
among those with a fondness for the
turf. Fully 1500 people took advantage of
the cheap rate. Again there was no pauc
ity of pencilers to accept the public's
monetary offerings, for eight regular
books, two field and a combination book
lent a decidedly metropolitan air to
things. Good odds were laid and the ring
separated itself from six or seven thou
sand dollars. Most of the well played
horses stopped at no wayside taverns, but
hurried to the wire. Still the additional
six days of the meet will not be run.
Originally tne management did not fig
ure on any outside bookmakers cutting
in, and probably figured on cleaning up
a neat sum with four or possibly five
books doing business. The feeling against
syndicate affairs, however, has become so
intense that Thomas H. Williams, presi
dent of thÂ© New California Jockey Club,
declared that if the meeting was run at
Emeryville the ring must be open to all
reputable bookmakers at the usual rate
of $20 per race. After paying off the six
purses a small deficit was apparent.
SPORT IS HIGH CLASS. .
Aa the bookmakers outside of the "com
bine" , were, disinclined to listen to any
pro rata proposition, Messrs. W. M. Kent.
Caeaar Youn* and Bart Cavanaugh held
a conference after the races were . over
and declared the meeting off.
No fault could be found with the cal
iber of sport furnished, even if El Ori
ente happened to be the only successful
favorite. Iva Powell distinguished him
self by piloting three winners. Garnet
Ferguson and his Tricnds put a crimp in
the books when Lady Wadaworth, â¢ played
from 12 to 6, stalked home first in the
fifth event. Horace Egbert and F. E.
Mulholland officiated in the stand and Ed
ward Duke gave entire satisfaction with
the starting gate.
Penrose, driven by Hasten, took the
2:19 pace without a struggle, after which
came a five-furlong scramble. Hercules
went to the post favorite and led to the
paddock, when he blew up. Maresa, the
second choice, then' won comfortably,
with Educate downing Snark a nose for
the place.
Solely,, on his past record Ben MacDhul
was installed favorite for the mile selling
run'- lie lacked support and receded from
8 to 5 to fours. Ed Duke made a pretty
start, but MacDhui propped right after
the' barrier was released and was left.
David S. with Powell up, went out in
front and .won all the way. In a drive
Heather Honey led out Ultruda, the fa
vorite, for place honors.
EL ORIENTE A WINNER.
For the mile and a furlong: selling af
fair Dug Martin and El Orlento closed
equal choices 'in the bettinjr. At the start
Hllderbrand, on El Oriente, went away
with a wet sail and lasted just long

conditions Imposed by the man who
makes up the races favored Ed Corrlgan
at Hawthorne to-day, his horses captur
ing four of the six races. The feature
was the victory of McGee In the Fleetfoot
handicap, which the colt won by a short
head from Beau Ormonde. It was a sen
sational struggle at the end and the vic
tory was practically a fluke. McGee
seemed beaten off at the head of the
stretch. As the field swung at the stretch
turn Baker brought McGee through on
the Inside, saving much ground and en
abling him to win by a scant head. So
close was the betting that McGee, Golden
Rule and The Kentucklan went to the
post equal favorites at 7 to 2, and all of
the horses in the race were played.

COURT DECIDES AGAINST
CLAIM OF ALLEGED WIDOW
women of the Golden Gate
I Tennis Club participated in some
I lively turnament play yesterday on
the public courts. As play was
confined to the second and third
classes the matches, although exciting
and hotly contested, were not of a high
class.
In the second class the cups were car
ried off by a new team. Miss Anita Bey
fuss and Miss Gretta Lindstrom. Miss
Vera Beyfuss and Miss Hazel Naylor by
winning the third class trophies yester
day gain permanent possession of them.
They won the previous tournament and
as the cups were to be won twice they
now belong to the winners.
By far the best match was that in
which Miss Anita Beyfus3 and Miss Lind
strom were opposed to Miss Dorothy
Weed and Miss Alice Naylor. The latter
were the cup holders and the former were
considered their most dangerous oppo
nents. After each had won and lost a set
6-2 Miss Beyfuss and Miss L4ndstrom
took the third and deciding one, which
went to deuce. The winners were steadier
than their opponents and won by getting
the balls back. Miss Weed played an ag
gressive game, but sacrificed direction
for speed. The score was 6-2, 6-2, 7-5.
Miss Anna Alberger and Miss Karin
Llndstrom won all their matches easily
until they reached the finals, where they
were beaten in straight sets.
In the third class one of the teams de
faulted and the only match played re
sulted in a victory for Miss Vera Bey
fuss and Miss Hazel Naylor, who beat
Mrs. Whitney and Miss Mearns 8-6, 6-2.
The second class resulted as follows:
Preliminary roundâ Miss Anna Alberger and
Miss Knrin Llndstrom beat MIfs A. Sea and
MIsp Lubbln, t>-2. C-0; Mirs Dorothy Weed
and Miss Alice Naylor beat Miss Ida Mearns
and THUs V. Crocker. 7-5, 0-2.

Miss Weed and Miss Naylor, C-'J. 2-6. 7-5.
Finalsâ Miss Beyfuss and Miss Lindslrom
beat Miss Alberger and Miss K. Llndstrom.
6-2, 6-3.
Many of the players who will partici
pate In the tournament to-day were out
for practice. Guy Lytton and Charles
Dunlap played a tie match with Charles
Griffin and J. M. Baker, the score being
7-5, 2-6. George Janes and Dunlap beat
George Finch and Charles Teller 6-2, 6-4.
M. Ix)ng and Teller beat J. R. Lewis and
J. B. Adams 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. Finch and Ad

Many of the California Club players
braved the foe and wind and put in the
afternoon before the nets. A fast doubles
was played by Dr. Sumner Hardy and
Harry Holfe and Sidney Salisbury and

sets, the last of which was close. Hardy
somewhat outclasses the others and won

The trial of the contest of the will of
SUinislao Antoldi brought by his cousin,
Carolina Casagrande, came to an end In
Judge Coffey's court yesterday. Without
leaving the bench the court decided that
sufficient evidence to support the claims
of the contestant had not been produced,
and he directed the entry of an order
denying the petition of the contestant for
a revocation of the order admitting the
will to probate.
Antoldi. who was a well-known commis
sion merchant, died two years ago. He
â¢was worth $30,000, and in a will made by
him on September 26, 1833. he bequeathed
it all to Marguerite Morblo, his godchild
and granddaughter of the late Adoiph Su
tro. The will was written on a letterhead
containing printed matter. It contained
two date lines, one partly printed and the
other entirely In the handwriting of thf
deceased. It was riled June 11 of last
year by Attorney Garret McEnerney, who
took the precaution of having it photo
graphed and of having the photograph
certified to before allowing it to get out
of his custody. This proved a wise pre
caution, for several months later a con
test was brought on the ground that the
document had been tampered with in the
office of the County Clerk and the wholly
written date line interpolated, therein. If
the charge had been sustained by the evi
dence the will would have been declared
Invalid, for the Supreme Court has .de
cided that a holographic will, such as this
purported to be, was invalid if any part
of the document was in any but the hand
writing of the testator.
In addition to the certified photographic
copy of the will, which was in itself evi
dence enough to prove the allegation of
the contestant foundationless, McEnerney
produced witnesses who testified that they
had examined the will the day it was filed
and saw the disputed llrje. He also showed
that from the time It was filed up to Aug.
ust 18 of this year the will had not been
bandied by any one except A. D. Spllvalo,
attorney for the contestant and a repre
sentative of the Public Administrator.
The evidence for the contestant was fur
nUhed by A. D. Spllvalo. his eon and John
Corbett. his clerk. They all swore that
they had seen the document a few days
after it was filed and that to the best of
their knowledge it did not contain the
written date line. Handwriting Expert
Ames also testified for the contestant. He
said that in his Judgment as an expert
who/had given evidence in 1300 cases
where handwriting was disputed the al
leged Interpolated line was not written by
the dseeaeed.

i& Mrs. Tupman, a prominent lady |Â§|
of Richmond, Va., a great sufferer with
woman's troubles, tells of her cure by
Lydia E* Pinkham's 'Vegetable Compound.
" Deaii Mrs. Pikkham : â For some years I suffered with backache,
sevÂ«?re bearing-down pains, leucorrhoea, and falling of the womb. I
tried man}* remedies, but nothing gave any positive relief.
" I commenced taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
in June, 190L When I had taken the first half bottle, I felt a vast im-
provement, and have now taken ten bottles -with the result that I feel
like a new woman. When I commenced taking the Vegetable Com-
pound I felt all worn out and was fast approaching complete nervous
collapse. I weighed only 98 pounds. Now I weigh 109i poundi. and
r.:n improving every day. I gladly testify to the benefits received." â
K. C. TuraxAX, 423 West 30th St., Richmond, Va.
Whci a medicine has been successful in more than a million
cases, is it justice to yourself to say, without trying- it, "I do not
believe it would help me " ?
Surely you cannot wish to remain weak and sick and discour-
aged, exhausted with each day's work. You have some derange-
ment of the feminine organism, and Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound will help you just as surely as it has others.
Mrs. W. H. Pelham, Jr., 108 E. Baker St., Richmond, Va., says :
" Deah Mrs. Pixkham :â I must say that I do not believe there is ai

"Gold thimbles." said the Jeweler, "are
rarely to be seen nowadays. Time was
when every young woman had one. They
were a regulation birthday or Christmas
present. But the young American girl of
to-day would be disgusted with the gift
of a gold thimble. She would much rather
have one of those long, red .automobiles
or e good saddle horse. The word thimble
In the past was thumble. It was worn,

It Is not apparent why so many men resorted
to this method of separating from the service,
aÂ«d if the depressing result could In any way
be attributed to American methods it would
certainly justify the deepest solicitude on the
part of all concerned In the'milltary admin
istration qf the army. As a matter of faet,
however, the American soldier I? so well pro
vided for in respect to all his material neces
sities and his personal appearance and is to
carefully safeguarded in respect to all matters
of dis<Hp!lnÂ« that a conclusion arises spon
taneously in the minds of experienced investi
gators to the effect that desertion, to a large
extent, la incidental to human nature, rather
than an excresrlon of npeclflc defects in the
military system and as tuch is not within the
scope of ordinary methods of control.
In the light of paat experience and conditions
it p*ems apparent that the United States as a
nation must accept desertion as a necessary
evil until enlightened public opinion can be In
duced to believe that it not only affects the
army as an organization, but. In remote con
sequences, is a menace to the stability of our
institutions through its corrupting effect upon
the military ideajs of the population that must
fuxnleh the forces upon which the republic
tnust always rely in time of war.
One thousand three hundred and forty-three
men deserted during thÂ« fiscal year. Of this
number Â¥14. were lrom the garrisons of the
department and represented approximately
19.42 per cent of the main strength therco' for
the year. The remaining 430 were from re
cruits, casuals and regiments x>asslng to and
from the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â General Mac-
Arthur, commanding the Department of
California, in his annual report says the
importance of an artillery reserve for the
Pacific Coast cannot be overestimated and
recommends that' the entire organized
militia of all arms located within easy
distance of San Francisco be invited to
participate In a course of coast artillery
training at the Presidio. He has the fol
lowing to say on desertions:
The faculty committee on students' af
fairs has not yet discussed the rush, but
wlien It docs something surprising will
happen. The committee has. the names
of many of the students who participated
in the free fight, furnished by Professor
Charles A. Noble, who was present.' Pro
fessor C. L. Cory, chairman of the com
mittee, refused to discuss the affair to
day, saying merely: -J" 7
"There will be an investigation into the
conduct of the students yesterday, but
no action. will be taken until the students'
affairs committee meets."
President Wheeler also refused to. dis
cuss the situation, on the ground that it
is the duty of the, students' affairs com
mittee to investigate all such matters.
It Is hard to conceive of any one, particu
larly a university man, using acid among a
crowd of men, but it seems there is such a
person. I was guarding the ballot box at ths
time It happened. As the sophomores closed
in on us I happened to look up a moment and
Juet then the acid fell Into my eye.
Some of the Â«ophomores actwi like ruffians.
They didn't seem to know any bounds. Why,
three of them caught a freshman named
Kerns and I yesterday morning in North Hail
and beat us severely. They left Kerns in a
bad plight. They would have tied us up only
there was not rope to be had. â¢
The chances of Frank C. Mclnncs of
Vallejo, the young freshman whose eye
was injured in the sophomore-freshman
rush yesterday at the University of Cali
fornia, losing cr retaining the sight of the
injured member are about even. Dr. E.
J. Boycs of Oakland, the specialist to
whom he was taken, told his patient to
day that he would be unable to Bay
whether he could save the Injured eye un
til the bandages are removed, in a day or
so. Mclnnes had a very narrow escape
from having his entire eye burned out.
Just a little more and he would have re
ceived the whole dose In that delicate
member. As it happened, only a drop en
tered the eye, and even this was ailutcd
by the water with which he quickly
bathed it. Mclnnes said to-day:
If I hadn't dashed water Into my eye right
away I would have been blind. That was all
that saved me. I havn'e been able to find out
yet what kind of acid It was and the doctors
are. not sure, though all the symptom*! point
to vitriol.

Bo this day Is one of grateful commemora
tion rather than of sad -lament, this hour an
hour of consjlatlon rather than of grief. Grief
at our profound bereavement we Indeed have,
for we have actually lost the converse of our
admirable and revered brother, and long as he
had been here, we yet feel as though we had
lcet him too soon, so intact did he still appear,
both In body and in mind, so stable In a quiet
maturity that kept its powers of Judgment
and even of acquisition quite unlmpared.
Professor William C. Merrill in hla
eulogy said that "Dr. Kellogg: was a Ro
man," for his nature, being sympathetic
with Roman ideals, his character was
profoundly affected by his intellectual
contact with the works of that great peo
ple, which in turn had affected the con
duct of his whole life. Professor Willard
B. Rising read the biography of Dr. Kel
logg's life and Columbus Bartlett's tribute
waa delivered by his eon, Louis de Fonte
nay Bartlett. A quartet, consisting tJT
Charles Elston, Howard Merrill, "Walter
de Leon and Melvln G. Jeffries, rendered
two songs.
DAY OF COMMEMORATION.
Tor thres and thirty years he had been our
devoted servant. In these hours of commem
oration, to be sure, we must not and cannot
forget the part played by a projmlnent asso
ciate of Professor Kellogg in the California
college. Dr. Horatio Stebbins, the last presi
dent of the board of trustees, without whose
planning, wisdom and public skill the accep
tance of the proposals made by the trustees
would probably not have been gained from
the State. But Professor Kellogg was our
founder in a yet more intimate and still
deeper sens>. It was in his person first that
the great, the vital principle of comprehensive
humane culture, essential as the organizing:
factor in the life of the institution, paaaed
forward from the narrower field It held in
the college into the vastly enlarged ono
afforded by the university. Fortunate was It
for him, fortunate for us, his successors, mofct
fortunate for the State and Its coming genera
tions of youth, that hla two eminent col
leagues, John and Joseph Le Conte, though
appointed to represent the sciences of nature,
were both men of genuine and disciplined love
of man. â¢Â¦
The exercises began at 3 o'clock, just
after the faculty had marched in a body
into Hearst Hall from the apartments be
low and taken peats on and about the
platform. President Wheeler presided and
introduced the speakers after delivering
a brief eulogy of the dead. The com
memorative address wa3 delivered by
Professor George Holmes Howison, who
said in part:
We ere once more essrmbled after what
eeeme, indeed, but a Bhort surcease of sor
row, to give expression to our Â«?nnÂ« of a\ great
loseâ a bereavement of the university and the
community alike. It Is only a brief two years
since we gathered here to honor the memory
of Joseph Le Conte, and now we are sum
moned, too eoon for our wishes, to note the
passing and commemorate the services of Mar
tin Kelk'Ks:. the lalt of the three bright
tpirits to whom the wiee Judgment of our first
board of regents committed the serious tasK
of inaugurating the internal life of the uni
versity.
The gathering was peculiarly represen
tative. There were men from every sta
tion In life, but notably two, who were
associate and student, respectively, with
Dr. Kellogg when he began his career in
California nearly fifty years ago. These
men were the Rev. Samuel \\\ Willty of
San FranciBco, one of the founders of the
College of California and the first execu
tive officer of the greater university, and
Benjamin Tracey of Sacramento, with
one exception the earliest graduate of the
university. But there were many more
old friends of the deceased educator pres
ent, among them Warring Wilkinson of
the State Deaf and Blind Asylum; J. B.
McChesney, Judge John Garber, the Rev.
F. S. Hosmer and the Rev. J. K. McLean.
Besides these well known peop'.e there
was present almost the entire faculty
of the university in cap and gown.

Friends who revered him through long
years of association, and friends, not so
old, but cheriphing him for his kind per

cises in honor of the late Dr. Martin Kel
logg, once president of the University of

The handsome new home cf the San
Mateo Athletic Club was fittingly dedi
cated last night to athletics. Member?
of the Olympic Club took a prominent
part in thÂ« exercises. A large delegation
of its best wrestlers, boxers and gymnasts
cave interesting exhibitions. The crowd
which tilled the spacious gymnasium
grew enthusiastic over the clever work.
President F. P. Howard of the new in
stitution opened the evening's entertain
ment with a short addrcs3. In the course
of his remarks he thanked the Olympic
<."lub for Its assistance. He said the San
Mateo Athletic Ciub had struggled for
what it had accomplished. By small be
ginnings and slow progress njjalnst grea.:
obstaclcs a few men cf determined princi
ples had brought the club to its prosant
condition. It was. proposed to i?sue bonds
for the purpose of making further im
provements, such as instituting handball
nl>>s, tennis courts and other Maoris, tie
took occasion to thank the reaiacnt.s for
their help and contributions. He then ln
ttoduced William Urear Harrison, presi
dent of the Olympic Ciub. who expressed
his Joy at seeing an athletic club in Sa:i
Mateo, He advised tho members no: to
go into debt by issuing bonds, but sug
gested that a committee of laxlios be ap
pointed to secure contributions from the
wealthy residents of the county. Mr.
Harrison also took occasion to lecture the
fair sex on their health.
The wrestling bouts Â¦were extremely In
teresting. Cornell and Phillips prese'itJ
a realistic contest and the fair sex be
came nervous, fearing the pair might in
jure themselves.
The Press Club quartet, composed of
A. E. McMillan, R. E. Kecnc, R. H
Hunt and G., R. King, scored a hit with
selections. Schlitter and Cornell on the
Roman rlng3 won many plaudits. Misa
Choridah Simpson, the well known singer,
received hearty app^aur.e and many en
cores for her sweet sthging. Members of
the Olympic Club under the direction of
Robert Leando swung fire clubs with
skill. The boxing bouts were fast and in
teresting. Leonard and Cairns; Murry
and Altken and Sam Berber and Jimmy
Britt put up fast exhibitions. R. H. Hunt
sang himrelf into favor. There were pyr
emids by Olympic Club men and a clever
Dutch act by Moriarlty and Penaiuna.
The programme was under the direc
tion of Captain D. W. Donnelly. John J.
Gleason, leader of the Olympic Club, also
assisted. The officers of the new club are
F. P. Howard, president; J. T. Cronin,
vice president; H. J. Bettelheim. secre
tary; D. TV- Donnelly, captain; L. B. Doe,
T. R. Turner, C. J. Brown, C. N. Kirk

The Columbia Park boys entertained the
guests of the club who visited San Mateo
by electric car with songs.
All three members of the executl\*e
committee In charge of the strike, Ken
nison, Parker and Davis, are now con
fined in the military guardhouse, and
other men have taken charge of the
strike.
A guard was thrown around the meeting
place and the officers announced that
every man, before he would be allowed
to depart, would have to submit to an
examination. No specific charge has
been placed against the prisoners. They
are held under the same conditions as the
other men who have been arrested since
the arrival of the militia in the district.
This aiternoon Peterson filed a com
plaint against Lieutenant Harting and
tihrriff itobertson armed with a warrant
v/ent to the military headquarters and
demanded the surrender of the officer.
-Adjutant General Sherman M. Bell, to
whom the warrant was presented, exam
ined it and returned'it to the Sheriff with
the remark that it was of no value theje.
He then iE3ued an order rescinding the
parses' cf Sheriff Robertson and his dep
uties, so that they are now denied admis
sion through the guard lines.

Preparations are now being made for

for testing the effect of radium on skin
diseases, including growths of a cancer

NEW YORK, Sept. 19.-\Vorking in ex
jjeriments together. Dr. George P. Kunz,
honorary curator of the American Mu
seum of Natural History, and Dr. Charles
BaskcrvlUe of. the University of North
Carolina believe they have made a val
uable discovery in connection with the
mysterious substance known as radium.
This discovery . is that by mixing ra
dium with natural ~-.liemite, pulverized,
the activity and power of the former sub
.stance are multiplied a hundred fold and
probably (no instrument has been devised
ior im-usunngr the increase ol activity} a
thousand ro!d. That, at least, is the tem
poiary Â«.uÂ«.ct of the mixing of the two
substances. Time must tell whether one
will i-uIHfi- the other.

thrre is in wi'.lemitc a sutstance which
Is Â«s yet unrecognized as> a distinct ele

is taken for wanted that the one sub

the other.

Chicago was somewhat lower. The letter of
Bolton, De Ryyter & Co. said:
"Market little easier. There was no particu
lar feature to local operations and no change
in general conditions. Packers still seem dis
posed to support prices in view of an expected
increase in demand. Receipts cf hogs little
in excess of last year. There is no change in
the local situation. Demand for meats from
South is of late a little disappointing."
There was nothing new in this market.

Provisions were weak and followed corn.
October pork closed S5c lower; lard was off 10c
and ribs were 5c higher.
CHICAGO, Sept. 10. â The fine weather and
the bearish feeling In other markets and free
selling by the Northwest accentuated the weak
ness in wheat. Longs sold out. some because
they had profits, others cwing to the action of
corn and on general bearish conditions. Decem
ber started *ic to *4c lower at S0*io to 80% c,
and other steady cables and small receipts,
which Induced commisslcnhouses to buy early,
sold up to 80*i@S0%c. BBl the advance was
short lived and when the selling started there
was little support. Stop orders were made on
the downward course and contributed to the
weakness. December touched 79*4c and an Im
portant firm took on sufficient to bring about a
small reaction. The close was barely steady,
with December at 7f)%c, a Iohs of .%c.
Corn conditions were similar to those which
effected the weakness in wheat and prices con
tinued to give way before the flood of offerings
which came from all directions. December
closed at 49*fcc. a net loss of l*4c.
The oats market was weak, in sympathy with
corn.- December closed at 38c, a loss of %@%c.

CORNâ There U no change in the situation
here. The Chicago letter of Bolton. De Ruy
ter & Co. says: "Damage by recent frosts Is
entirely a matter of theory, but the One
weather throughout the West is a fact that Is
apparent. Corn Is largely weather, and it
naturally occasioned quite general selling.
There Is nothing in cash situation to. stimu
late speculative ' cohfldence or to materially
arlvancrt prices. Indications are that with good
wrather receipts will Increase. Corn Is in
much the eame position as Wheat, inasmuch
as it has had a sharp break. With good
weather we doubt if any , continued advance
can be maintained and think we would sell
Corn on hard spots. Winters says: 'It still
looks as though Corn should be sold on the
rivlllee.' "

BARLEY â The weak closed on a quiet and
unchanged cash market, with lower futures.
CASH BARLEY. " .
There was a drop of 3c in futures in this
market, with the bears hammering prices to
get them down to an export basis. Whether
they will be able to do this remains to be
Â«een, as the country holders are very firm
and the millers are active seekers for sup
plies In the country. As yet cash quotations
remain unchanged. The supply throughout
the State is light.
CASH WHEAT.
WHEAT â The foreign markets showed little
change. Chicago reported excellent buying.
The Chicago letter of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co.
nald: "There is no change In the general
conditions. Cables are fairly steady and fine
weather prevails throughout the West. There
was little export business at the decline. Cash
markets on tho whole are rather less snappish
than for some time past. 'World's shipments
are estimated to be quite large. The market
has had four days of declining prices and
about 1 cents per bushel break. Under nor
mal conditions it ehould have some reaction.
Our views on the tendency, however, do not
change. With a fair movement from the in
terior, and export demand on Its present basis,
cr oven with a small increase, we are in
clined to think prices are likely to drag and
that wheat should be sold on the rallies. We
are now at the beginning of a period when
ftoeks Increase and bull markets are usually
hard to maintain. Our Mr. Bangs says: 'Bulls
are a rather demoralized set. and some of the
most pronounced are out of the market at
present, awaiting the expected movement in
the Northwest. To-day is the first day for
eigners hava shown any Interest and have
taken any wheat. Possibly their buying may
stop any further decline, but it is the on'y
thing which will tighten our market, wllh
present existing feeling. Corn was heavy
and this only added to weak feeling in
whfcat.' "

A large portion of the receipts of Raspber
ries and Strawberries arrived too late for the
regular trade and had to be sold below, the
quotations. Available suppplies cleaned up
quickly in the morning and there was a r harp
advance in prices of Raspberries. Blackberries
and Huckleberries were steady. There was

As usual on Saturday the local demand for
fruits was brisk and the market was quite ac
tive during the greater part of the day. Ap
ples and Pears stood hs previously quoted,
with fancy in good request and steady and
common offerings abundant and dull. Prunes,
Quince3 'and Pomegranates ruled steady at
previous prices. The canncrs were offering $15
per ton for Quinces, but no sales were reported
at that figure. ' Peaches were plentiful and
fancy stock was not taken as freely by the
local trade as on the preceding day, tho high
prices having checked the demand somewhat.
Saljvays in bulk moved rather slowly, the 'tan
ners being indifferent buyers. A few small
lots of Clingstones in bulk cold to the canners
at $30 per ton. Figs arrived freely in all kinds
of packages and continued to sell at a wide
range. Table Grapes were in free supply and
in fair request. The Seedless variety were a
little easier, but continued to move off well.
Offerings of Isabella in crates were liberal and
included much poor stock, which dragged at
easy rates. There was a limited demand for
choice offerings of other varieties in crates for
shipment on the Portland steamer, but sup
plies were too large to permit any advance in
prices. The canners 'purchased several lots of
river Muscat in bulk at $25 per ton. Wine
Grapes moved freely and occasional lots con
taining a large percentage of sugar command
ed a small premium over the quotations.
There were liberal receipts of Watermelons
and as the demand was rather slack prices
had a further decline. Nutmeg melons were
nnnly held in the early morning at 75c@$l per
box, but the light receipts proved excessive at
those prices and the best offerings could be
bought in the afternoon at 40@50c per box.
Cantaloupes, too, were easier and only a small
percentage of the receipts brought the maxi
mum quotation: There was quite a surplus
of both kinds unsold at the close.

LONDON. Sept. 19.â Ever since the
r.&rce of Rothschild became great
in the worid of finance the three
branches of the family In Ger
many. France and England have
had another Important distinction in com
mon. The Rothschild women Europe over
are, and were generations ago, good to
look &t, kindly of disposition, simple of
speech and big 'of brain. Gudula Schnaf
fer Mayer, mother of the first rich Roths
child, started this fashion in the family.
She was a good old lady who lived in a
Lack street in the Frankfort ghetto long
after her sons were striding on toward
fortune. Back of her house, still pre
served, is the little shop where her hus
band commenced 'the business that formed
a. foundation for her sons' great enter
prises.
Frau Gudula could never be induced to
have her home among the Jews of Frank
fort, and ehe held a tradition unto her
death that if she waxed proud and am
bitious as her sons waxed rich their luck
would turn and the money leave the fam
ily. So she made herself comfortable and
lived on alone in the house where her
t-hildren were born. She did many chari
ties and mixed freely among the im
portant people of Frankfort, who became,
as years passed, the friends of her chii
dren. But she made them accept her as
ehe was or not at all. Her fashionable
daughters-in-law came in their carriages
to the ghetto and the old lady, worthy
mother of so valiant a house, let them in
i-.ers-lf and Iti them out again. Frau Gu
cuia was known among the chosen people
lor years after her death as one of the
particular mothers in Israel. The name
to generally cpr'ied to her during her life
time. Mother Mayer, clung to her memory.
Mother Mayer, who never knew the
gentler title, "Rothschild" (red shieia),
adopted as It was by her successful eon
from the elgn that hung above his first
business house, has bequeathed many of
her fine qualities to the ladies Rothschild
of to-day. Those born Rothschilds are
women cf much the same type as she.
The present Baron's wife was his cousiu,
er.d there is no more zeaJous worker for
poor Jews in London than she. By a curi
ous coincidence the women who have be
come Rothschilds by marriage have nu
â¢ merous traits of character In common
Vith these "of tE^TtothscHna^KToodT 'â¢--
royalties and rich folk than any similar
function ever held in London.
INVENTED THE "WEEK END."
Lady Rothschild, wife of the head of
the Rothschild family in England, has
achieved one success as an entertainer
which places her quite outside the rank
of English hostesses. Not even the
Duchess of Devonshire can take to her
self the credit for the setting of such a
fashion as the "week end." Lady Roths
child undoubtedly made the Friday-night
to-Monday-mornlng visit in the country
the diversion It now is for the English
aristocracy. From the aristocracy it
went to the middle classes and thence to
the lower, so that her ladyship has prac
tically done a kindness to 'the entire na
tion. Tring Park is occupied by Lord
Rothschild and his family only two
months out of the year, but the great
show place Is open for week end house
parties almost year in and year out. Lord
Rothschild delights to gather, his political
and business friends about him on these
occasions and everybody who is "any
body" some time or other attends a
Rothschild week end party.
Lady Rothschild is the frequent hostess
of royalty, both at Tring Park and at 178
Piccadilly, the magnificent town residence
of the family adjoining Apsley House, the
home of Wellington. But no matter what
the occasion, Lady Rothschild maintains
a rigid simplicity of dress. Her favorite
evening costume is gray satin, voile or
chiffon, and her Jewelry rarely exceeds
two pieces. One of these is a diamond
spray hair ornament and the other a
string of pearls. The pearls, fitting close
ly about the neck, are of great value
and are graduated until the center one is
reached. It is a huge, pear-shaped thing
and is one of the many priceless gems in
the Rothschild family.
Lady Rothschild shares one taste in
common with the King of England. Her
favorite flower, and Lord Rothschild's as
well, is the Malmaison carnation. This
carnation is frequently used in decorating
the King's private dinner table. On one
occasion tvhen the King and Queen at
tended a ball given at the RothschiM
town residence, Lady Rothschild used her
ingenuity and contrived decorations which
the then Prince of Wales said were as
beautiful as anything he had" ever seen
in a London house. Blooming peach trees
were "planted" throughout the mansion
and both the color and scent of the blos
soms were so accurately reproduced that
it seemed as if one were in a peach

day, and to. the amazement of all the rest
of the House continued the use of it
throughout the summer session. Although
a. young man of great activity, the Hon."
Walter Rothschild is not strong. His del
icate health has made it necessary for
him to travel a great deal, and in the an
nual trips he makes to the south of Eu
rope and other ' civilized ', countries his
mother is his companion. ' Lady Roths
child, hnwov*'. does not - accompany her

Tring Park, greatest of the residences
of the Rothschilds, was built by the pres
ent Lord Rothschild to suit his own
fancy. It is a mammoth building, square
and comfortable. . It is stored with art
treasures, although "the most precious
Rothschild - pictures are in Piccadilly:
The ' conservatories and private zoo j are
Tring Park's claim to" highest distinction.
The zoo, next to" the Duke of Bedford's,
is.theflnest collection of. its kind in Eng

to the Baron himself. Tring Park is one
of a' circle of Rothschild residences run

I KNOWS HER OWN MIND. - â¢
! Miss'Allce de Rothschild., who inherited
her vast 'wealth from her : brother, the
late .Baron -Ferdinand de Rothschild, Is
perhaps , the cleverest of the Rothschild
women.. She is a wit and an after-dinner
speaker ; of - no small reputation. Good
natured 'though she is to a degree. Miss
Alice .has a. tongue that 'spares not. Since
her brother's death she superintends the
running {of 'her vast estates with a vigor

daughter of the late Sir Anthony de
Rothschildâ she who "'is president of the
National Union of Women Workers â dis
jtvntses charity enough for the entire
Kothschild connection and both ?he and
her lovely sister. Mrs. liliot Yorke. are
ardent workers in the cause of temper
ance. Miss Alice de Rothschild, also a
cousin of Lord Rothschild, is the spinster
of the family and persona grata with the
Queen cf England. She is what is known
as a thoroughly good sort, although fam
ous neither for the suavity of Lady Roths
ihild and Mrs. "Leo" nor for the public
l.hilanthrcpies of Lady Battersea and
Mrs. Eliot Yorke. 'Of the younger gen
t ration of Rothschilds, Lady Crewe and
Lady Sybil Grant, the daughters of Lord
Rofaebety. are the leading lights. The
tnythcr of these ladies was Hannah
Rothschild, who was tremendously rich;
and. furthermore, there is a general sup
position that Miss Alice Rothschild, who
inherited her vast wealth from the King's
irlend. "Ferdy" Rothschild, will leave it
to the "Rosebery girls." Neither Lady
Crewe nor Lady Sybil Grant is beautiful,
Lut they are clever, good-natured wom
en, who, like Lady Rothschild, have a
cenuine repugnance to publicity of any
kind.
Then there is pretty Mrs. Clive Beh

who married her kinsman. Mrs. Behreris
is her mother's partner in all labor con

friend of the newspapers. Although she
never on any occasion permits the publi
cation of her photograph, she goes out of
her way to give desired information. In
her unwillingness to have her picture go
the rounds. Lady Rothschild is like all
the ladies of the Rothschild family. Lady
Sybil Grant was not photographed in any
newspaper until just previous to her mar
riage, when she yielded to the pressure
brought to bear on the family.
DEVOUT WORSHIPER.
Lady Rothschild is a devout attendant
at a modest house of worship In Bays
water and when recently 'â¢ some ' of th"e
brethren collected the Jewish hymns writ
ten in lat? years they dedicated the
volume to Lady Rothschild. Her lady
ship is fond of walking about London and
often "takes the tube" downtown and
thence a bus to "the city," where some of
her charities are located.
But above society and above charity
Lady Rothschilds particular hobby is her
son. the Hon. Walter Rothschild. This
young man, who will some day be Lord
Rothschild, is no lover of smart society.
He is said to look like a farmer, and cer
tainly he loves country pursuits better
than town. He. too, enjoys his father's
well equipped dairy at Tring. although his
own famous zoological musuem takes pre
cedence of the dairy. The Hon. Walter is
a great traveler and has personally col
lected strange animals from all quarters
of the globe. The latest addition to his
museum Is an assortment of 1000 strange
fleas. He has offered $5000 for ' a '. peculiar
rpecimen of the flea family, known as the
Arctic flea, hitherto uncaught by â¢ any
Englishman. Mr. Rothschild long since
commissioned an Arctic whaler to hunt
for this little insect and when tlie cax>-
LONDON', Sept. 19.-Mrs. Henry Hig
gins, formerly Mrs. Breese of New
York, and Miss Parsons of Colum
bus, O., has been doing Bome~smart
entertaining at her pretty town house
near Portman Square. She has now, how
ever, gone with her family to their place
in the country near London and will have
a number of, house parties. Mrs. Higgins'
eldest daughter, Miss Eloise Breese, is
making quite a stir since her recent de
but. She is an excellent .talker., and. aa.
extraordinarily good horsewoman. The
younger Miss Breese willbe out soon and
Mrs. Higgins' boy, who comes between
the sisters, is now. of age.
Mrs. Higgins is as strictly "In it" as
any American woman in London. She is
an intimate friend of Lady de Grey, Lady
Charles Beresford and others of "the
opera set." Until her marriage with Mr.
Higgins, five years ago, the then Mrs.
Breese, rich and pretty, was besieged
with offers of marriage. Her vogue in
Rome and in Paris was one which smart
people remember. She could have had a

Lady Constance expects to return to Eng

appeals to her. more than any of Eng

heiress to her sister, the little Barones3
Cromartie, who holds her title in Her own
right, and who is a "literary lady." Lady
Constance evidently jntends to imitate her
sister in that particular. She is going to

Sutherland and Argyle, and these gentle

to a point that placed her apart

a succession of remarkable impersona

that Mrs. Flske was solely a gTeat ex

The fact that her earlier experiences in
the theater were in the classic drama, in
association with the great among the
players of those earlier years, and that
such experiences must have instilled the

The error was seen when Mrs. Flske
originated In English the part of Mary of
Magdala In the Heyse drama, In which
she will be seen in this city during the
present season. William Winter, the dean
of American critics, said In the New York

"That is more serious. It is the low
tone of appreciation for the best songs
that prevails â of course, comparatively.
And again, happily, it is changing every
day for the better. But the indifference
and Ignorance of the public as to the best
of song art is directly due to the vicious
system of song royalties that is ram
pant. Edward Lloyd, for example, got
never less than Â£500 a year for singing
'Theâ Unholy! City.' Antoinette Sterling
used to make an annual Â£700 for singing
'The Lost Chord.' Well,. then, the public
naturally said to Itselfâ not knowing of
thisâ 'these songs must be good, for these
great singers sing them,' and went home
to put them on every piano rack in the
country. Then the poor song writers, with
Albani and. such people in such reper
toires, wrote songs to fit themâ venal, of
course, but, unfortunately, all but Inevi
table. The whole song standard is low
ered in consequence. I have the honor to
be," and Mr. O'Sullivan shook a proud
head, "one of the smallest royalty singers
In England. But there's Plunkett Greene
and a few others to keep up the fight."
"Trust an Irishman to be In some sort
of fight," I laughed.
"Ah, I must tell you about the Sligo fes
tival," the Irishman then laughed. "I go
down to sing there every year, j and last
year at the little affair; they had a 'thrifle'
of a singing 1 contest, they made me make
a 'spache' "â he actually said! "Well, I
went for the people, starting with his

gedian in the Staats Theater at Meinln
gen. Why, he* couldn't help singing! He
brought the other Wolf song, too, the
'Fussreise,' I gave the other night. That
embodies to me the whole spirit of the
morning."
"You must have some splendid recitals
in London?"
"H'm!" the singer said, "not so many
as we should have. There are two things
in London that make a singer's life not
wholly a happy oneâ that's if lie cares
for his work. The charity coricert Is one.
There's a perfect plague of them. Some
titled this or the other will write a hon
eyed note Insisting that you sing for the
benefit of a home for tongue-tied cocka
toos or hump-backed kangaroos in which
she Is interested. The dear duchess her
self-does not uull a penny out of her
august pocket, by the way. And some
times one cannot refuse. The objects are
so ludicrous, too, frequently, and the
more sentimental the more successful. I
remember, for example, a benefit for
homeless clogs that netted a clean Â£685,
while in the same week a benefit for a
broken down old singer, Anna Cole, made
just Â£15. It is the same way with actors.
Little Dan Leno, the cleverest low com
edian on the English stage, is now in an
asylum through overwork, said to be
largely due to the excessive demands
made upon him by so-called charitable
Institutions."
"And the other reason why the singer's
life is not all beer and skittles in Lon
don?"
"'Predilection' all right," I nodded.".
"I have a predilection," with proud rep
etition, "for Ernani, Figaro, Ratcliffe,
Baron Scarpia, Geradâ oh, I can't think,"
with his hands thrown up. "I have sing
forty-six roles."
"Iago, of course?"
"Oh, I mooch like Iago. But Maurel you
should hear. Yous aimerlez bcaucoua
A bubbling "Oul! oul!" answered me.
I translated.
"I have a predilection, no?" Gregoretti
looked at me. ;
"I am rather rltardâ Is It not?" Grego
retti cried as he came Into Mr. Leahy's
office at the Tlvoii a moment or two after
I arrived there on my baritone hunt. He
held out a fervent Italian hand, and
every bit of his dental jewelry beamed
on me. "I am very glad know you. I
thank you for what you write about me.
You have been very kind,", all this with
a well-rehearsed and artless fluency.
"And you have been very clever," I
echo, smiling back. This Is an Infectious
ly good-humored person. To begin, then.
I asked: "Do you know Salassa? We like
him very much here?" To Gregoretti,
the fine old artist's legitimate successor,
the question was obviously natural.
"No; but by name," he replied, and I
noted then the clean, careful and musi
cal cut of such English as Gregoretti has.
"I know you like him. When you write
about me, you speak of him,, is it not?"
and the singer leaned back with Joyful
pride in himself. "You excuse me if I
speak English; I practice with you."
"What parts do you specially like to
sing?" I asked.
" 'Specially, 'specially?" Gregoretti quot
ed, bewildered.
"Parlez francais?" *â¢

youâ so onâ it's the shame it is for all
this talent hero to be m-glected for the
salce of a few guineas and a scrap of in

And this year, would you think it, they
had a splendid little festivalâ choruses,
bands, violin soles, songs. All sorts of
music, they had, frorn rale ould Gaelic
patter songs to a Paiaestrina eight-part
motet. The motet v;as sung by an old
fellow that looked like Moses, an ancient
grandam, two little snub-no?<ed girls and
others, and was led by a one-legged prac
tical plumber. They were all factory folk
from Nev-Ty, and I tell you they sang
wonderfully.
"I wanted the thing more to give the
people something to think of besides poli
tics," this patriot Gael went on, "to keep
the men out of saloons and to give the
girl children a chance to come in contact
with things fine and pretty. And it was
charming to see the factory girls in their
simple little dresses singing alongside rich
young women with every external refine
ment. But I nearly blubbered when the
school children sangâ babies of 12 to 15.
It's as pitiful as a bird cry. There's
a pathos unexplainable about the child
voice. The only thing that sav?<l
me was a joke, and I grabbed: for it like

gallant Irish bard shall take precedence.
I left Mr. O'Sullivan with the clean
tincture of a delicate brogue in my ears.
to fall Jnto an engaging whirlwind of
French, Italian, courageous English and
a fluent volapuk of Gregoretti gesture.
The day was warm, the interview a mat
ter of perspiration and prayer, and since
then I have been carrying round an An
glo-Italo-French-HIbernian brogue that
threatens hopelessly to dislocate my vo
cabulary- And if this were all! But sap
ristl! this ragtime libretto persists in fit
ting Itself to the- haunting phrase of the
Brahms finale that Mr. Sche-el gave us
last Tuesday, when It is not two-stepping
it to the tune of the current "Trovatore."
Such is the dire result of mixing one's
interviews, then taking a symphony con
cert on top â all this to explain humbly, it
should be said, the lingual olla podrida
that impends.
As it was certainly Gregoretti who told
me that ho had stubbed the "fingers of
his foot" on Monday evening in the
"Trovatore," bo I am equally convinced
that It was Denis O'SullIvan who dis
coursed so eloquently to me upon song
singing last Tuesday. It was naturally to
him, a born singer of songs, that I should
go for some of its secrets, as it was to
go to the TlvoII barytone for operatic
fish to fry- Therefore to him I safely
ascribe the following song wisdom, deliv
ered in earnest, nervous English except
when Ireland's music came up, when the
O'Sullivan phrase and accent warmed Into
a cordial, fragrant brogue.
After the "good mornings"â it was in
the offices of the O'Sullivan estate, where
this particular scion of the name was
doing his un-Celtic best to become an ab
sentee landlord of San Franciscoâ I ven
tured to congratulate the singer on his
fine vocal trim, as it was evidenced at
his recital of last week.
"Yet." he said, "I have never sung so
well here, I am deplorably conscious, as
I have sung in London. I am always un
fortunate In finding I have a throat here.
People must thinkâ I feelâ the London
criticisms of my work awtully exaggerat
ed In their praise."
"That is the last thing the London
critic Is usually accused of," I replied,
"nor do I believe there tfi any one to think
you overpraised. To me the criticisms
are simply Just, for â permit me â It Is only
when a Max Helnrich or some other such
rare artist comes along that one gets the
body and soul of a song as you give them.
But I do want to know a little about how
you pet at It, if I may?"
"I don't thought"â no! that must
have been Adamoâ "I think I have hard
ly any settled method," the barytone
laughed, "though possibly my experience
of 'finding' a song Is practically the same
Vx most cases. I " and the art dream

"Oh, he is only fairly well known in
Germany, practically not at all In Eng

London last season by Dr. Wullner

and Mr. O'Sullivan's tone blazed with
admiration, "to me comprises in himself

have a sort of instinct for finding a good
song, to begin with. There is" something
about itâ a veritable magnetism that
seems to attract through the very covers!
Yes, I find I buy very little trash, though
I read at least one or two new songs
every day. For one thing I read very
readily at sightâ my eyes are very quick,
I can see almost through to the next
page it sometimes seems to me, and you
can see how this helps In getting at the
ensemble of a song. The atmosphere I
get almost immediately. I really very sel
the first reading."
"But there is a whole continent between
that and the final rendering?"
"Just as there is between the negative
and the finished photograph," the bary
tone put it. "There's the developing, the
printing, the polishing up, everything
that goes to make the finished picture
from the spontaneous thing that the first
flash of the sun splashed on the glass.
Curiously. I'm not conscious of the tech
nical difficulties of the song at first. Those
impose themselves later. Then with its
every reading there is a loss of spon
taneity until the singing becomes not in
stinctive but purely mechanical. In the
final rendering the. scng Is the me
chanical, conscious expression of what
was at first an intuitive perception of Its
values."
"And you act out your songs, I know, in
etudying them?"
"I act too much In singing them?" Mr.
O'Sullivan quickly queried back.
"Not for a moment," I heartily replied.
"I do act while I study," the singer
laughingly confessed, "shout, throw my
arms about, make faces and walk all
over the shoo. I think it helps you to
get the drama of a song for one thing.
Then, for another. It frees your muscles
from restraint that is going to make it
self felt in your sineinjj."
"It must have been great fun studying
the Strauss 'Fur Funzehn Pfennige'?"
"It was," the barytone agreed, then re
marked: "I^s very difficult, all sorts of
tonal hurdl<4=, queer scales" â and he ran
up and down one In a rich la, la, until
avid ears hung in at the door and I
wanted to call the Interview off. "There's
another Strauss, magnificent thing, that
I wanted to sing, "Die Rattenfanger.' In
deed, personally, I should like to have
made my programme wholly of Strauss,
Hugo Wolf, Welngartner perhaps, and,
say, somÂ« of the less well known songs
of Schubert. There's a perfect mine of
themâ songs of Osslan. Hector's Abs

stuff."

Then in a polyglot lingo Gregoretti
showed his thoughtful side in an eloquent
exposition of operatic conditions in Italy.
How the Socialist' party, in view of the
poverty of the country, has declared It
self against the subventioning of thea
ters. How there is another clique that
is all in favor of the retaining: of the
subvention traditions. How these two
parties make themselves evident In the
atrical audiences by applauding and hiss
ing certain- singers for no other reason
than that the other side does the other
thing. How in consequence the independ
ent,'with a Socialist on one side and a
subventlonist on the other, one applaud
ing, the other hissing, does not know
what to do. How in Rome the great
Argentina Theater, once the recipient of
200,000 francs for a four months' season
yearly, now gets nothing. How the the
aters are everywhere closing.
"And it is better for the poor when
theaters are opened." Gregoretti con
cluded. "Ladies want the gloves and a
new dress, want always to change,
n'est-ce pas? And make it better for
merchants and better for theaters and
better fcr si.igers."
"What do the King and Queen think
about the situation?"
- "No care," laughed Gregorettfi "like

"Exactly," with profound relief, sitting
down thankfully. "I am very glad to
sing."
"That I'm sure of," I testified. "And
with whom did you study?"
"At Rome I studied, with the sister of
Tamberllk, once time greatest tenor of
the world! He died now. He was plus
grand que Tamagno. Then I have stud
ied also with Bartolini. He modest, you
understand, not much known, but gret

Tamberllk's fame and Bartolini's modes
ty Gregoretti opened wide his soft and
fiery brown eyes and lifted his black
brows. There is much eye play among his
vocabulary and I laughingly mimicked
his elance here. His return look showed
him amiably conscious of his visual gym
nastics. He is all amiability, and looks it
In every healthy, good natured line of
his big, fine figure to the incorrigible
dimple in his chin.
"I wished very much to come here,
ouf!" he went on then. ~ "I have been
twice to South Amerlque, but not North.
It is like Russie here. Audiences the
same, very enthusiasm."
"I thought that the Italian audiences
were the most enthusiastic."
"Not now, once time," Gregoretti cor
rected. "Here much more so. They are
affectionate, expansive. If you are nub.
"Never. I like for to move. I cannot
sing like this," and Gregoretti stood up
stiffly like a little tin soldier.
"Then you have always been an opera

"No; I was once an engineer of me

covered. "I have made a section of study
of enginery at a mecanisme establish

Gregoretti strode over to Mr. Leahy's

"Engineering books you throw away,"
I said, in turn throwing away imaginary
volumes. >-_*
"It is the Thomas 'Hamlet?' V
"Yes," subscribed the singer. "I think
it better for America than for Italy. You

"You sing also Falstari?"
"Non; I feel still troppo â too down,"
said the singer, measuring about a foot

Time w&6 when a maiden was agreeably
received by society when she was nega,
tlvcly eligible â not poor, not unhandsome,
not underbred. But to-day the girl who
shines must be a positive quantity; she
must be. first of all, unhampered by a
puny purse. That goes without saying.
rÂ«.r the luxuries of dress and housing and
entertaining have, wjth our present stand
ards, become necessities. But she must
possess positive personal qualities; she
must first and above all things be a wom
anly woman â one who can lend a sympa
thetic car to a tale of woe and at the same
time enter joyously into the fraternity of
pood fellowship, this term used in it's
true sense of untrammcled and untraves
tlÂ«-d friendship. Then, too, she must be
tactful, tender and clever. And it is the
appreciation of the clever maid that has
brought about the renunciation of the old
order of things where girlsâ the girls of
â¢â¢â¢ur grandmothers' daysâ weren't supposed

hhe possesses opinions, and, what is more,
t-he expresses them. And it is just this
expression, unrestrained by false and silly
blue laws, that has developed in the suc
cessful society girl of to-day a charming
confrere, a sympathetic friend, a wise
counselor; and when she marriesâ and this
is contrary to many oft expressed but
wroncly conceived opinions â she performs
the functions of wife, friend and mother
with ho:ior to herself and happiness to
:.<>r husband and children. It is of this
type of society girl whose engagement
was announced on Wednesday â Miss Ber-
Die Drown.
Purely intellectual work has been taken
