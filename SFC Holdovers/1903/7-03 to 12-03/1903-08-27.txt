The Nunlvak's crew claim they were

refers to them as "a bunch of kickers."
The Nunivak was formerly used as a

The men have refused to leave the ship

TACOMA, "Wash... Aug. 26.â The Nome

the small Yukon steamship Nunivak tell
stories of hardships and sufferings during
the seven weeks that the Nunivak was
slcwly working her way through the
Bering Sea and- down the Alaskan coast
to Puget Sound. From July 3 until last
night the steamer. had been at the mercy
of the weather and\ieavy seas. Accounts
agree that on several occasions food was
short. Two anchors were lost overboard.
At another time one of the vessel's life
boats was cut loose and sent adrift. One
of the crew was compelled to jump over
board, swim to the boat and bring it
back. Several times the Nunivak ran on
mud fiats close into the shore and dur
ing the change of tide was high and dry.
When she left St Michael she had' but
three days' provisions aboard, necessi

supplies were procured from a fishing

was replenished with ducks and a supply

WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â Public Print
er Palmer late this afternoon issued an
order that all per diem and piece work
employes of the Government printing of
fice must immediately take the regular
oath of office*, which embodies a vow to
support the constitution of the United
States. Palmer admits that the order did
not originate with him, but that he was
directed to promulgate It. He will not
discuss the matter in detail, but says
that the initiative came from an official
high In position.
By those familiar with the situation
this is held to mean that instructions to
the Public Printer came from President
Roosevelt through Secretary Cortelyou
of the Department of Commerce and La
bor. This order by the Public Printer is
the direct outgrowth of the Miller case.
Heretofore only salaried employes of the
Government printing office and a number
of minor officials on the per diem scale
have been required to take the oath of
office. Hereafter every employe of that
branch of the service will be required to
take the oath. This means that there

Special Dispatch to The CalL
General Velutini, Venezuela's Minister
to Paris, has, it is understood, signed
"ad referendum," an agreement covering
these points. Persons here who know
President Castro's character, declare that
his hatred for everything foreign in the
way of "control" will lead .iim to reject
the agreement and the question Is askedâ
If he does so, how will the foreign claims
against Venezuela be paid?
The Banque de Paris and its associates
would receive for obtaining the consent
of the various creditors and furnishing
45,500,000 francs In cash, ten per cent, pay
able in scrip of the entire sum of 218,000
000 francs.
This 12,000,000 would beconie collectable
In proportion to customs receipts by
agents who would have an international
character and wouid be. appointed with
the concurrence of all; the powers inter
ested in the loans now existing and would
be deposited in a special bank â¢ of , new
loan.'". Tlio' sum of 138,000,000 francs would
be^ handed to. the holders of former, loans
and the* balance - out, 58,200^000 francs,
would "be purchased by the Banque\de
Paris and its syndicate at the rate of
eighty per cent and be transmitted in
gold to thie Venezuelan Government, giv-.
ing the latter 46,500,000 francs which would
put It in a position to pay the awards of
the mixed tribunals.
Venezuela's debts amount to 258.000,000
francs, quoted at present at from twenty
three to thirty per cent. It la proposed
to offer to holders of the different debts
the opportunity to exchange their scrip
at two-fifths of -its value tor the scrip of
a new debt, which Is to bear interest at
5.48 per cent and to be redeemable in
fifty years. The amount of the new debt
to be created under the proposed plan
would be about 218,000,000 francs, for the
service of which 12,000,000 francs would
suffice, a sum inferior to that now carried
on the Venezuelan budget.

"Tesavtus the volcano opened like a huge
mouth, oat of which belched a fiery
etresm of lava, which ran down the side
of the mountain and at first seemed to
menace the observatory. This building
however, is protected in the direction of
the stream by a rnound of lava twenty
teet high, which was thrown out during
the eruptions of 1S35 and 1300.
The eruption occurred without any
"tarring whatever. There was no earth
quake, detonation or rain of ashes â noth
ing but a clear stream of lava and red
hot stones, which were thrown to a height
of 700 feet, producing an extremely beau
tiful effect seen from Naples. The stream
ol lava, which is fifteen feet broad, at 11
o'clock had covered a distance of 2700 feet.
It deviated later from the direction of the
observatory, which is no longer menaced.
The only danger is for the new electric
tramway up the volcano, which, however,
has thus far not been touched. The erup
tion already seems to be decreasing, and
it is hoped no damage will result from It.
The spectators far enough away not to be
frightened stood entranced at the specta

seized by panic when the eruption began
and rushed down from the sides of the

to the villages of Portici and Resina,

that the Question bu referred to the Na

CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â John F. Finnerty,'
president of the United Irish League of
America, has issued an address regarding
the "land bill victory," in which he says:
Ireland, in the' passage of the land purchase
bill, has achieved a brilliant and also a sub
stantial victory r but the greatest victory Is'
yet to be wonj As the commercial reforms of
17S0 preceded the independent Irish Parlia
ment of 1782, .so does the land purchase bill
stand as the procursor.of the restoration of
that Parliament (with up-to-date reforms), so
infamously destroyed by England In 1800. I
am tn" principle an Irish Separatist, and will
so remain to the last; but I recognize the ben
efit that must come to Ireland by the presence
of a native Legislature, making laws for the
Irish nation In . Dublin or some other great
city of the Island. Total separation would call
for an Irish fleet, an Irish army; an Irish
treasury overflowing with golden millions, and
at least one powerful ally, like. France, Ger
many or America. I will leave to the Judg
ment of my fellow-countrymen and fellow-cltl
zens how soon all these requirements are
either probable" or possible in Ireland. The
alternative of an independent Parliament ' la
an honorable compromise, but not a "final set
tlement." ,' . . . â¢. .

Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â The race tu-mor-
ow is to be fifteen miles to windward or
leeward and return, the same as that
which the defender won such signal tri
umph in Saturday's event. These rivals
already have been tried in almost every
phase of weather save that of a heavy
wind and tumbled sea, but even should
this condition obtain, there are few who
would not still pintheir faith to Reliance.
Yachtsmen hail her as the speediest cut
ter that eVer went adrift. To her spread
ers there was to-day rove two sets of
halyards, one on each side, and if she
wins to-morrow's event, which will be the
last in the scries, two huge American /lags
will be hoisted on these halyards imme
diately she sweeps across the finish line
and still another will be flung to the wind
from her topmast head.
It is apparent that Sir Thomas Lipton is
much discouraged to-night, and though he
still bravely keeps a stiff upper lip, it is
clear enough that even his indomitable
spirit has flagged under this long series
of defeats.
"It is hard," he eaid, "after all these
years of working and planning and striv
ing for that cup that 1 cannot get a single
race; but," with a touch of his old-time
cheerfulness of heart, "we did better in
Qta s-econd race than we did in the first,
and if we continue to improve me way
Jet win."
MAY NOT CHALLENGE AGAIN.
It was rumored that Sir Thomas was so
much discouraged aver the outlook that
he had dismissed all idea of challenging
*Mjain. He was asked about this report
to-day.
"i cannot talk about that now," he re
plied.
Speaking of his future plans. Sir Thom
as that after the races he would take
the nrst and third Shamrocks back with
him, it-aving the second here.
"When I arrived I said if the Americans
wanted to put their Reliance, Constitu
tion and Columbia against my - three
Shamrocks 1 would agree, but as only two
oi the Shamrocks are now In condition
I could enter these, lea.vipg out Ehamrock
41. 1 do not know if any such regatta
lias been seriously considered and 1 do
not know whether it would ;be. possible
for me to stay for such an event, as I
ajn in a hurry to return." -
local weather bureau is In receipt
of the loiiowing special forecast for
Thursday's race from Washington:
"To. Observer, New York: The wind
over the international yacht course Thurs
day will be light to fresh northeast, shift
ing -in the afternoon to east and south
east," with probably cloudy weather."
. An. alleged wireless report from the
jutht Erin, which is equipped with the
Deforest wireless system , published in a,
fc}ornir.g paper, to the effect that Sham
roqk- III was seriously damaged during"
? esterday's storm and that there was a
possibility cf Sir Thomas asking for a
postponement, caused considerable excite
ment in yachting circles. Investigation
proved that the statement was without
foundation. Shamrock rode out yester
day bp squall without the slightest damage,
although the big anchor was dropped as
an additional precaution.
NO EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE.
0 There was no particular evidence at
Sandy Hook to-day of last night's blow
t-xcept the broken bowsprit of the Ger
alda.
C. O. Isclin, aboard the Sunbeam, the
defender's tender, said that as far* as he
knew there was no material damage to
any one. Iselin. Captain Barr and Design
er Herreshoff of Reliance had a long con
ference to-day, but Iselin refused to say
anything for publication as to its charac
ter.
The time allowance under which Re
liance, Constitution and Columbia have
â¢sailed in the preliminary races this year
was made known to-day. Those times
have betn kept secret. Reliance allowed
Constitution one minute and forty-sir
seconds and Columbia two minutes and
forty-one seconds In all races.
By these times it is figured that Con
stitution won two races from Reliance;
but Columbia failed to score. Reliance!
sustained no damage whatever in yester-i
day's squall.
The Shamrock III put up her mainsail
and her club topsail this afternoon, but
<11<J not leave her anchorage to go out.
She stretched and dried them. ,
On the Reliance ihere was not a move
and Mr. Mower, the club measurer, sim
ply put the tape to the new gaff and de
clared it" the same length a*s the old, so
that fher measurement was the same aa
before. . . .
The" wind .at Sandy Hook at midnight,
southeast about three miles an hour. The
sky is cloudy and the prospects for a race
to-morrow appear poor.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 26.â The
Johnson programme was /carried
out completely at the Democratic
State Convention to-day. After
the opposition had obstructed the
proceedings with minority reports for
some hours the name of John L. Zimmer
man cf Springfield was not presented for
the gubernatorial nomination, and then
every nomination on t'he State ticket was
made by acclamation without opposition.
Even after the chair announced that the
name of Tom L. Johnson was the only
one before the convention for Governor
there were some dissenting Zimmerman
votes on the motion to make the nomina
tion unanimous, but the Zimmerman men
quit after the selections for Governor and
Senator were made. Still the opposition
by various obstructive movements kept
the convention in continuous session for
about seven hours.
While minority reports were presented
from the committee, the only fight that
worried the Johnson managers was on the
Senatorship. The only ballots forced on
the dominant el^nent were in that con
test. The minority report on rules and
order of business, which was intended to.
omit the indorsement of a Senatorial can
didate, was defeated by a vote of 211 yeas
to 446 nays, and that was considered a
test vote between Johnson and Zimmer
man after all the contested seats had been
decided In fn.vor of the former.
LENTZ ACCUSES JOHNSON.
On naming the man for Senator the
Johnson, men were divided among them,
selves. Mayor Johnson and ex-Congress
man Lentz have been very close, person
ally and politically, for years, but a most
Intensely bitter feeling existed between
them to-day, at least en the part of Lentz,
who openly accused Johnson of favoring
for Senator a man who had voted against
Bryan. The Zimmerman men had intend
ed voting for Clarke, the Johnson candi
date for Senator, as they said he repre
sented their conservative views, b\it when
Lentz opened a fight on Johnson' on the
Senatorial candidate the Zimmerman men
resumed their obstructive tactics and
voted for Lentz for Senator, thus driving
the Johnson men to the second ballot. .
After the first ballot, which resulted,
Clarke 335. Lentz 222. Saltzgaber 125, Baker
11 and Russell 14, the Johnson men made
a terrific effort on the floor of the conven
tion to name Clarke on the second ballot.
The vote for Saltzgaber represented the
ultra-silver men, who were the most ar
dent supporters of Johnson, but who said
they would support no man who had voted
against Bryan. M. E. Ingalls of Cincin
nati had been indorsed by the Hamilton
CÂ«ynty delegation for Senator and was
the choice of the Zimmerman men. but
Ingalls and the unseated Hamilton Coun
ty delegates, although in the city, did not
attend the convention.
CLEVELAND CONSPICUOUS.
John H. .Clarke, who will "canvass the
State with Mayor Johnson and other
Democratic candidates, has been a prom
inent attorney at Youngstown for many
years, but he is now located in Cleveland,
which city has four prominent candidates,
the Republican as well as the Democratic
candidates for Senator and Governor.
Next to the commanding presence of
Mayor Johnson was the part of Clarke in
the convention. He made two masterly
speeches, one presenting the name of
Johnson and the other in accepting the
Senatorial nomination. After the conven
tion many delegates said his first speech
nominated Clarke as well as Johnson. In
his second speech Clarke Intimated that
he would ask Senator Hanna for joint de.
bates during the campaign, and that
caused a great demonstration.
Ex-Representative Frank B. Niles, the
running mate of Johnson for Lieutenant
Governor, is a'.so Baid to be a speaker
who will contribute largely to the discus
sion of pending issues.
With the single exception of the Sena
torial Indorsement the Johnson men con
trolled the convention to-day as firmly
as the district and committee meetings
yesterday. The convention was aa dis
tinctly with Bryan on National as with
Johnson on State issues. The speeches of
both Temporary Chairman Saltzgaber and
Permanent Chairman ( J. H. Goeke insist
ed that if the Democratic party is to
change its policy to suit the times the
change must.be made by the friends of
the party, and not by its enemies.
The result of the convention leaves the
party organization 18 to 3 in the hands of
the Bryan-Johnson element for next
year's convention, when delegates to the
Democratic National Convention are to
be selected.

LONDON, Aug. 26.â According to a "dis
patch from Belgrade, Servib, many of the
soldiers belonging to the reserve, called
out by Turkey, are" refusing to. join the
colors, as the troops in- the- 'field haive not
received any pay for months.
In taking more ertefgetlc measures for
the suppression of the revolution Turkey
is acting in accordance with the advice
of the powers. The forthcoming confer
ence of Kinc Edward with Emperor;
Frances" Joseph and . King George" of,

Czar and Emperor William to Vienna will
enable the monarchs to discuss Balkan:
affairs thoroughly, and before the con-i
elusion of the conferences Turkey pro
posts so far as possible to restore order,
so that international action will be un
necessary. An official of the Turkish em
bassy here said to-day: ...
"The Calling out of, additional troops
by Turkey Is due -solely to the decision
to suppress the insurrection at once. It
Is not in anticipation of war with. Bul
garia. Turkey has. no Intention of de
claring war, In spite of rumors to the con
trary and Bulgaria, warned by the pow
ers, does not seem at this moment to
contemplate hostilities. We knowwhat

situation may change to-morrow, but in
the meantime Turkey proposes to lose no

ROME, Aug. 26.â The burial of Menotti
Garibaldi took place to-day and was a
most impressive spectacle. During the
night the body was carried on the gun
carriage on which it left Rome last night,
escorted by cavalry, across the Cam
pagna Romana. Amid the darkness
would appear from time to time groups
of peasants, carrying torches, lanterns
and characteristic lamps with three
wicks, who knelt along the road" and
called on God to bless the remains of
their benefactor. A group of cowboys of
the Campagna Romana, mounted on
prairie ponies, and carrying long iron
tipped lances for guiding Â¦ the cattle,
joined the escort around the coffin. As
the dawn- burst over the Campagna 'a
group of horsemen came dashing up from
the opposite direction. Their leader, who

A DETERMINED effort is to be

have suggested that he did, but if such

Heywocd's death by asphyxiation at his
j home. 1400 Hayes street, four weeks ago
was attended by considerable mystery
and has provoked much comment among
his more intimate friends. There have
been several rumors afloat concerning cer-
I tain financial transactions In which he
j Is said to have been Involved and to which
j his sudden death is attributed, but these
! stories are emphatically denied by those
! who pretend to be acquainted with his
i private affairs.
That the capitalist was worried over
! domestic troubles for several days prior
to his death there Is everyweason for on
lleving, for he confided them to frienus.
A strange Incident, occurring just prijr
to his preparations for the xnd, also sup
ports iiit theory of domestic troubles and
strengthens the suspicions of his widow
that hÂ«- made a will later than the one
that hi.s been offered for probate. Si
MYSTEBIOTJS MESSAGE.
On the evening of the day before the
remains of Heywood were found the wife
of a well-known attorney living across
the bay was summoned to her telephone
by an Inquiry for her husband. She In
formed the person nz the other enc,
whose voice was that of a woman, that
her husband was not at home and sug
gest ed tl at he could be found at his of
fice in tiiis city on the following morning
ft J o'clock. The response was that ihat
hour would be too late. A further co'i
vcrFauon developed the fact that the at
torney was wanted by Franklin Heywood
in San Francisco to draw up a will and
his presence was needed right away.
Forty-eight hours later the attorney, who
had been Informed of the telephone mes
sage by his wife, read of the death of
Heywood in the morning papers.
On August 12 a will of Heywood's was
filed for probate. It bore the date of.
twenty-four days prior to the death of
the capitalist. It recited the fact that
Hvywood and his wife had been separated
for fourteen years and she was given a
monthly allowance of $150 for life. Tne
estate, which Is valued at about $250,0000.
was left in trust to the deceased's broth
ers and Attorney H. A. Powell, who were
Instructed to pay over to the widow i*;e
allowance mentioned above, which she
had been receiving ever since the separa
tion occurred, and a similar amount was
ordered i>aid each month to Agnes Maud
Heywood. an aduj ted daughter. " >s -^
WILL IGNORED WIFE.
SOUGHT RECONCILIATION.
Several weeks Drlor to his death Hey-
The will provided that upon the death
of Mrs. Heywood the estate should be
divided, one half going to the adopted
daughter and the other half to the broth
ers and sister of the deceased, share and
share alike. Several small bequests were
made to friends and former employes of
the dead man. A further provision of the
will was that should the daughter die be
fore the widow the former's share should
: goto the relatives of the capitalist, other
\ than Mrs. Heywood.
Although these provisions of the win
plainly intimated that Heywood was de
termined that his wife should not share
in the estate and that his love for her
had waned during their long separation,
evidence is In possession of the friends of
the deceased and those of Mrs. Heywood,
clearly showing that Heywood's love for
hlÂ» wife had revived within him and had
promoted him, within a very few hours
before his death, to seek a reconciliation.
The estrangement of husband and wife
occurred about thirteen years ago and
has since been attributed by the friends
of both to the adoption of the child, who
is now known as Agnes Maud Heywood
and who Is on the brink of womanhood.
Mr. and Mrs. Heywood agreed to sepa
rate, and did so. the child remaining un
der the protection of her foster father,
who gave his wife a monthly allowance
and frequently, during the long years
that separated them, he wrote to his wife
letters, the words of which conveyed to
her -his spirit of kindness.
Asked concerning .'the'./itory of Hey/
wood's apparent inclination to ; make a
new will Miss Heywood said she* had
Miss Heywood, when questioned last
evening, admitted that an attempt had
been made by Heywood to effect a recon
ciliation with his wife and when she was
asked If it was not true that the reunion
determined on the act of herself, she re
plied:
Tes, it did, but I told Mr. Heywood that I
was not prepared to give my consent to the
plan and I will say now that I -would never
consent to It. The idea that, I was to blame
for. 'the estrangement, of. Mr. and Mrs. Hey
wood. however, la all wrong, for I was only 15
months old .when they agreed to live apart.' I
have not heard of any proposed contest and I
don't think there will be one.
MISS .' HEYWOOD TALKS.
' I have been Informed of his message to the
Oakland lawyer and regard It as, very signifi
cant in view of the friendly relations that had
suddenly developed between^the husband and
his wife. It is true that he had been trying
to bring about a reconciliation. Possibly a
will may yet be found and if it Is we will
under the law. have twelv# months in which
to offer It for probate.
The refusal of the daughter to encour
age Heywood's plan for reconciliation
and his discouragement over the situa
tion is suggested as a probable solution
of the mystery that surrounds the cap
italist's suicide, and it Is one that en
courages the friends of the widow in
suspecting that Heywood made a will Just
before he took his life. In discussing the
peculiar situation Judge Fox, who repre
sents Mrs. Heywood and who c*ked sev
eral significant questions of witnesses in
court on Tuesday when the probating
of the will was In progress, relative to
the possibility of a later will, said yes
terday: ,
It has been reported that Mrs. Heywood in
tends to contest the will of her late husband,
but -up to the present time she has made no
iÂ«uch declaration: Her separation from her
husband wan â¢ effected by contract, which was
carefully drawn with regard to her community
property rights. TheÂ»e ehe may Insist upon in
thus matter, for it cannot be .denied that there
is a community Interest in the estate of Frank
lin Heywood. As to a will, it is true that the
suspicion has existed that . Heywood did exe
cute one Just prior io his death.
DAUGHTER INTERVENES.
It is known that Heywood had learned
from his wife's own lips, In fact, he had
admitted it to friends, that she was will
ing to return to him, provided that the
adopted daughter was agreeable to the
plan. IVIth this hope about to be realized,
the friends airain ask why Heywood de
strored himself.
The following day was the date on
which the female voice asked ot the tel
ephone for the Oakland attorney and
added that his services were wanted to
draw up a will. In view of the fact, as
has â¢ been established by the records of
the probate court, that Heywooi had only
twenty-four days before made R will in
which he Ignored his wife, there neces
sarily is provoked much speculation among
his. friends as to whether he reajly did
make another will, even though he failed
to cet the services of an attorney. And
if he did his v friends naturally ask what
motive prompted him to make It. other
than a desire to make amends for the
wrong he confessed his wife had suffered
at his hands.
ENCOURAGED BY WIFE.
"I have been to blame In this matter,"
Heywood Is quoted as saying to his
friend, "and I want to rectify the wrong
I have done my wife."
wood confided to a number of his friends
the fact that he was endeavoring to ef
fect a reconciliation with his wife and
was progressing most favorably. He said
his plan was to bring Mrs. Heywood and
the adopted daughter together with a
view to paving the way for a family re
union. Three or four days -before his
death Heywood called on a friend and
Informed him that he had succeeded in
his plan In so far as a meeting of the
wife and the daughter were concerned
and the latter had joined Mrs. Heywood
on a pleasure trip to Santa Cruz. As a
matter of fact the two women were in
Santa Cruz when the dead body of Hey
wocd was found at his home in this city.
After this call Heywood visited his
friend again later and told him that he
had questioned the daughter relative to
the^plan to have Mrs. Heywoofl return to
him, but that Miss Heywood had an
swered that she was not yet prepared to
give her consent to such a proposition.
Heywood appeared quite blue .over the
daughter's stubborn stand and did not
try to conceal the fact from his friend.
At 10:45 the 12-inch rifle at Fort Leavitt
opened on the section of the- fleet which
steamed" In rapidly from sea Ward from
the direction of.Whitehead Passage. The
battleships, lying in a direct line from
Cushlngs over Ram Islands, opened flre.
From Portland Head to the Two Lights
all the searchlights were trained on the
entrance to the' harbor, and soon were
seen slinking under the smoke the tor
pedo-boat destroyers of the fleet.
They were readily picked up by the
searchlights on . Fort Williams as they
reached Portland Head, and Immediately
there broke out the din of the rapid tiring
guns. The destroyers kept on and came
to a standstill in the channel. It looked
as if the, movement was an attack on
the mine fields. While the destroyers
were removing the mlne3, their names
were distinguished. Lying opposite Cape
Cottage was the Lawrence, farther up
the channel vas the Truxton. while the
Whipple ran up to Fort Scammel and
came to a standstill there. After lying
some time in the channel the destroyers
ran back Â¦ toward the sea.
Several small beats attempted a land
ing. When they were discovered a gen
eral call 'to arms was sounded and the
entire garrison f urned out, . driving the
invaders back.
PORTLAND. Me.. Aug. 27.â The enemy's
fleet made the second demonstration
against the harbor two hours before mid
night, the evident purpose of which was
to countermine the harbor. Two vessels,
one of which was a torpedo boat destroy
er, surrendered during the engagement.
An attempt at landing was defeated. The
attack ended at 1:15, the vessels withdraw
ing to Halfway Rock, where at 1 o'clock
eight had gathered. AH light* were shown
on the ships after the demonstration.
The Fort Leavitt batteries opened flre
on two cruisers opposite the Two Lights
and ab9ut a mile from the fort, with the
searchlights covering the vessels during:
the firing. It was thought that an attempt
would be made at landing.' -
A large ship was reported opposite Fort
Leavitt, pouring broadside after broad
side into the fort. The Fort Leavitt bat
teries replied and four shots were fired
from Fort Preble mortars. Fort Wil
liams picked up a big cruiser at 11 o'clock
and opened tire on her, being answered in
kind by the ship.
Four big' ships at 11 o'clock could be
discerned firing- at Forts McKinley .and
Leavitt. These ships could be seen plainly
and It was supposed that there were oth
ers following.
At.ll;10 a large ship came up Into the
harbor showing - the signal of surrender.
The second vessel to surrender, which
proved to be a destroyer, was seen enter
ing the harbor slowly at 11:15. She came
to anchor off Preble.

When the Catharina sailed she carried
a heavy deck load end had a heavy list.
On June 6 and 7 heavy southerly
gales prevailed off the coast of Washing

tion vitally affecting 400 shi.'^le mills In
Western Washington will be taken at a
meeting of the Washington Shingle Manu
facturers' Association, which is now in
session at Seattle. Though no public an
nouncement has been made, it developed
to-night that the St/ife Lumbermen's As
sociation, a strong organization, has
stepped into the breach and demanded the
righj. to aid the shingle manufacturers to
thoroughly organize, thereby making it
possitfle to restrict the output of shingles
at certain* reasons of the year and thus
eave the industry from possible collapse
in consequence of overproduction.
President White and Secretary Bcckman
of tie Shingle Manufacturers' Association
have notified the manufacturers thai the
object of the present meeljng is to either
form a ne*- association or entirely change
the old one. To this end the shingle man
ufacturer* will be requested to listen to a
plan outlined by a committee from ths
Lumbermen's Association, having as its
object the combination of all the ehlngle
mi'ls in the State for the purpose of rc-
Ftrictiag: the output when necessary and
preventing: price fluctuations, which have
been the source of gTeat trouble during
the past rear. The lumbermen have not
yet unfolded thfir p!Â»n. but state that ft
Â«tCI require until next' January to inaugu
rate It. since every mill in the State will
hav* to be visited and the project fully
explained. An the conditions surrounding
the manufacture of Fhingles are now un
satisfactory, it Is believed that the pro
posed plan will be adopted.

SAN JOSE, Au*. 56.â Louis Matty, a
young mai well known in this city, was
burned O death this afternoon in a
forest fire at Wrights In the Santa. Cruz
mountains. The fire was discovered al
most in the center of the little village
and It soon threatened the Wrights'
Hotel conducted by Antonoin Matty,
father of the deceased. Every person in
tcnn turned out to fight the fire, and the
blaze was Clverted to the east and north
cf the place. The brush was thick in
that section and the fire spread rapidly.
Louis Matty and Bob Borrelll, a part
ner of Matty's in the livery business at
Wrights, led the fire fighters to where
the flames were fiercest. When they had
fought their way to a point about a half
mile northerly from Wrights, Borrelli
lost sight of Matty for a few minutes.
He then heard Matty call for help and
endeavored to reach him. but .could not
because of the intervening lino of flre.

Â£pec.al Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Nev., Aue. 26.â Four of the
guards of Folsom prison, all of whom
are well acquainted with the escaped con
victs, arrived here to-day, and it is hoped
that with the assistance of the local po
lice some definite news of- the fugitives
will be heard in the near future. The
party consisted of H. A. Wilkinson, a
nephew of the Warden of Folsom prison;
T. F. Ryan, T. Lewis and J. R. Smith,
the latter being one of the guards that
was in the battle at Pilot Hill and later
followed the trail of the escapes until
recalled to the prison. The guards are
all* heavily armed and are ready to take
the field against the outlaws. They were
met at the depot by Sheriff Hayes, and
after a hurried interview with him Wil
kinson and Ryan boarded a Virginia and
Truckee train and went to Virginia City,
where it was thought that' two of the
convicts were. in the hands of the Sheriff
of Storey CountyJ
Guards Lewis and Smith were escorted
to the city bastile, where Convicts Woods
and Murphy were confined. j Upon reach
ing the Jail the guards were recognized
by the convicts,, who greeted them with.
"Hello! I suppose you fellows are after
us?" The guards held a few moments'
conversation with the men and then" went
to work to pick up the trail of the miss
ing convicts. They first visited the scenes
of the other captures, and then- went to
East Reno about two miles from here.
They intend to thoroughly inspect the dif
ferent gangs employed on the construc
tion work of the railroad. If no clew
is found there they will return to Reno
and make another start, in company with
Scout Crais and the local officers.
Wilkinson and Ryan returned from Vir
ginia City to-night, after having turned
loose tfie suspects arrested there. The
man thought to be Eidridge to
be an innocent stranger. They will spend
two or three days In this section scout
ing and if a clew is discovered will stay
with it to the end, but It unsuccessful
they will escort Woods and Murphy, who
are confined in the Reno jail, to Folsom
prison Saturday evening.
The officers here are jubilant over the
arrival of the Folsom guards, for, being
familiar with the men wanted, they think
that more of the escanes will eoon be
in the hands of the law. It is almost
certain that several of the escapes are
still In this section.
The Reno officials have by no means
given un the chase, nor are they dis-,.
couraged. There is a large force of men
in the field day and night, although most
of the work outside of the city Is being
done at night, as the methods used by
the>escapes In California show that most
of their traveling was done at night The
posses here expect to profit by that
knowledge. Scouting jmrtlea are scat
tered around in the neighborhood of Reno,
and as a precaution against harm to in
nocent Darties have ordered that every
one not engaged in the hunt remain oft
the hills or outskirts of town at night.
Convict Woods is now aulet and re
served, but Murphy still talks to the Jail
ers. -Â¦ When the prisoners were captured
they had between them about $5 50. This
money they are spending for extra meals,
tobacco, etc., as they say they have no
more use for money now that they see
the walls of Folsom prison in sight.
Word was received here this evening
that Monday night an unknown man at
tempted to steal a horse from a farm
about five miles south of town. The
stranger first tried to get a horse from
the barn, but was frightened away. He
then attempted to catch a horse that wa3
in a corral near the barn, but was driven
off by a shot fired by one of the ranch
hands. Two officers were sent to the
scene this evening to look into the mat
ter. It is thought that the prowler may
have been Convict Miller, who came near
being caught by Deputy Sheriffs Maxwell
and Sharkey last Sunday night.

I know thare are' many who have rendered
high services to the Institution, but I believe,
taking all things Into consideration, there Is
no' man whose service can be matched against
that of Dr. Kellogg. He stood always for the
highest and best things.. His voice and his
influence were always for what Is clean, de
cent, orderly. Those who eought his counsel
found that he was wise beyo-nd the ordinary
measure of human wisdom; those who shared
his closer confidences knew that he was tender
and kind and faithful, and that he wished no
man evil, but sought good for all.
CHINESE ARRESTED ON
CHARGE OF BURGLARY
. The news of the death of President Kelloge
has bowed the entire university community in
frrltt. He wa* a much beloved man.
For forty-three yearsâ that I*, from the very
beginning: of the university in tha form of the
little college In Oakland â he was more In
timately connected with the whole life Â«f the
institution than any othtr man. His person
ality represents its entire history. He served
the university for two periods, once In 1SSS,
again from 1800 to 1S03 as its acting: presi
dent; from 1882 to 1899 he was Its president.
He was a quiet man, and It may be that men
have not always known how great and how
fundamental In their character were his ssr
vires to the university.
He carried burdens, the weight of which
few men knew. He would carry burdens and
not repine; he could be buffeted and not com
plain. And yet he was a finely sensitive man.
It was always the high cause he represented
and not his personal comfort or his pride that
lay nearest his heart and governed his actions.
He loved the university with a great love. He
had sacrificed for It and tolled for It and suf
fered for It. He had a fine sense for the dig
nity of a ur.iverÂ«ity and the respect due It
and its standards and he was willing to stand
between It and the turmoil that beset it from
without and standing there to be patient and
Bteadfast and true. â¢â¢ .
â¢BERKELEY, Aug. 26.-Presldent Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the University of
California paid the following tribute to
his predecessor, the late Martin Kellogg:

STANFORD UNIVERSE Y. Aug. 26.â
Dr. Pierre Joseph Frien. assistant pro
fessor of the Romanic languages depart
ment, has resigned his position at Stan
ford in order to go to the University of
Washington. Professor Fri' n has left for
SMttle, where he will be the head of
the department of Roman!.? languages in
the northern college.
Resigns Position at Stanford.
acting president and president of the Uni
versity of California was coincident with
a period cf remarkable growth in the in
stitution, which more^than kept pace
with the progress of the oldest and beBt
schools in the East. He had a principal
part in the reorganization of the colleges
and courses, with the, advantages- of the
elective system;' and IA the adoption of
the policy of accrediting student gradu
ates of the high schools of the - State,
which has done much toward the in
crease of attendance at the University.
Though well occupied with his official
and academic duties, Professor Kellogg
found time to make some valuable con
tributions to educational literature, and'
his works are standard in many parts of
the country.
He was a member of the American
Philological Association and of the Cali
fornia Historical Society. In 1893 his
alma mater, Yale, conferred upon him
tne degree of LL. D. .
After five years of faithful service in
the presidential chair, In September, 1898,
he tendered his resignation, which wag
not accepted, however, until March of the
following year, when Professor Benjamin
Ide Wheeler was chosen to succeed him.
Professor Kellogg was then honored by
the Regents with the appointment as pro
fessor emeritus pf Latin, which he held at
the time of his death.
In 1SES Professor Kellogg went on a trip
abroad for a much needed rest, returning
In 1890. In 1839, with Mrs. Kellogg, he
made a trip around the world. \
Professor Kellogg's time of - service as
Professor Kellogg's first chair was that
of ancient languages, and later Latin lan
guage and literature. From 1870 to 1885 he
was the dean of the academic faculties o'
the university, and In the latter year, on
the resignation of President Reid, he was
chosen chairman of the academic faculties
and performed the duties of president un
til the arrival of President Holden, when
he resumed his usual work. In 1S90, on
President Davis' withdrawal from the
university. Professor Kellogg was at once
chosen by the academic senate as presi
dent pro tempore. The Board of Regents,
recognizing his fitness for the position,
confirmed this action and assigned to him
the duties of president, with a seat In the
board. Two years later he was duly elect
ed to the presidency and formally induct
ed Into office on charter day, March 23,
1893. . .
CAREER AT BERKELEY.
During the next four years he filled
charges in the Congregational churches a.t
Grass Valley and in Shasta and in 1?59
accepted the professorship . of Latin and
mathematics in the College of California.
This was the first institution in the State
to establish full and independent college
courses on the lines then in favor . in
Eastern colleges, which were beginning
to see the wisdom of the plan followed by
the University of Virginia, as laid down
by Jefferson.
The College of California in 1868 was
merged into the then new State Univer
sity and In recognition of the part he had
had in the merger, as well as his marked
ability, the Regents elected him one of
the first two professors of the new in
stitution, Professor John Le Conte being
the other. . N
He entered Yale in due course and grad
uated therefrom with the degree of A. B.
in 1850, being about 22 years of age, and
was chosen valedictorian of his class.
After graduation he taught for a time In
the High School at Woodbury, Conn., and
then, having decided to study theology,
he entered the Union Theological Semi
nary at New York, whence he was grad
uated in 1851. In 1853 the degree of master
of arts was conferred upon him by his
alma mater. After studying for a while
at Andover, Mass., he then went to Yale
as resident licentiate, where he remained
until 1855, when he was ordained to the
ministry and left for California to work
as a home missionary.
GRADUATE OF YALE.
Until he was sixteen years of age Mar
tin lived at home and had such opportu
nities for instruction as were afforded
by the district winter school and the
higher school taught for a few months
each year by undergraduates of the
neighboring colleges. During two winters
later he attended better schools in near
by towns and then went to Williston
Seminary to prepare for college.
Martin Kellogg, whose name and work
were so closely associated with the Incep
tion and upbuilding of the University of
California, was born in Vernon, Connec
ticut, March 15, 1S2S. His father and
grandfather were farmers 'and his own
boyhood was passed on the farm. They
were, however, people of education and
one uncle. Rev. Ebenezer Kellogg, a grad
uate of Yale in 1610, was for more, than
thirty years professor of ancl*nt lan
guages in Williams College, Massachu
setts. Another Ebenezer Kellogg, sreat
grandfather of Martin Kellogg, graduat
ed from Yale in 1757, and was for more
than fifty years pastor at North Bolton
(.later Vernon), Connecticut.
His mother, Eliza White, was a direct
descendant of the Elder John White who
emigrated with Rev. Thomas Hooker
from Cambridge to Hartford in 1636. Both
families furnished their quota in succes
sive generations of substantial and use
ful citizens.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 26.â
Professor Henry Rushton Fairclough,
head of the department of Latin, ar
rived at the university this morning from
a yÂ« ar's travel spent in classical research
work In Europe. He visited both Eng
land and the Continent during his eab
batical year's leave. Professor Fairclough
achieved considerable prominence in con
nection with the presentation of the An
tigone In the original Greek by the
Stanford Greek department last year. He
was largely responsible for the success
of the production, having superintended
the work of preparation.
Professor Fairclough Returns.
t> "^X-PRESIDENT Martin Keljogg
of the University of California
passed away peacefully at the
Sanitarium at 11:43
o'clock yesterday morning. He
entered the sanitarium several weeks ago
to have a surgical operation performed.
He rallied from the effects of the knife
at first and the attending physicians
thought he had an excellent chance of
recovery. His weakened constitution
caused by the burden of years gave way,
however, and several days ago It was
known that he would succumb. The dis
tinguished educator leaves a wife, . who
watched by his side in the sanitarium. -
"This is a bad piece of business," paid
Boyd to-day. "They were trying to hush
up the matter. I was not notified of the
true condition cf Gilligan. or McGrath
would never have been able to skip. As
It Is now he has a big start on us and
may get away."
Two months ago Gilligan, who was
about 30 years of age, was appointed
Poundmaster for the municipality of
Sausalito, and he proved to be a moft
efficient officer. About two weeks ago
Gillican had n small dog in the pound
and McGrath took a great fancy to the
animal. Gilligan promised the canine to
his friend, provided it was not redeemed
within the required time. The dog was
not taJsen cut in time and McGrath be
came its master. Subsequently the own
er appeared and wanted his pet. He paid
Gilligan the necessary fees and the ca
nine was restored to him, but without
the knowledge cf McGrath. The two men
met Sunday. August 1G. and McGrath ac
cused Gillig-an of selling the dog. An
â¢altercation followed and McGrath knock
f6 his opponent down. Gilligan's head
struck the Ftor.e sidewalk and his skull
.was fractured.
The officer* of Sausalito did not arrest
McGrath. neither was the Sheriff's office
in San Rafael notified. Gilligan received
medical attention in his own room that
niijrht, but his condition became serious
and hÂ»* was removed to the San Fran
cisco hoepital ' the following day. Mc-
Grath was still allowed his freedom and
soon after he .left town. He has not been
Been in Sausalito for nearly a week.
After he hart gone the District Attor
ney was notified and issued a warrant,
,hut n* effort was made to locate Mc-
Grath until to-day. Sheriff Taylor has
now taken the matter in hand and is
"much incensed that he was not notified
before. District Attorney Boyd is also
angry.
SAUSALJTO. Aug. 26.â Arther E. Gilli
gan died this morning in St. Mary's Hos
pitaJ. San Francisco, and a warrant has
been issued for the arrest of Francis H.
McGrath on the charge of manslaughter.
McGrath is accused of having fatally in
jured Gillipan during a quarrel.
Both Gilligan and McGrath were resi
dent* of SausaJito and were popular in
Martn County. Up to a very short time
ago thev were fast friends. They were
comrades in the Spanish war. fought to
gether in the Philippines' and after their
discharge took up their abode in Sausa
lito. For a long time they occupied the
Fame apartments.
Special Dlsi>atch to The Call.
It must be borne in mind - there are 1S13
platform men alone In our service. If each
member procured five rent statements, as re
quested, we should have In this record 0X75
statements. It appears that employes and non
employes and women as well circulated these
statements and that the union was not able
to procure but a few hundred rent Increases to
sustain their contention, and even then, as
Is shown by Mr. Sloan's affidavit, they are not
altogether reliable.
In the matter of the statements filed by the
union entitled "Explanation as to savings,"
the United Railroads has no sur-rebuttal tes
timony to Introduce and in perfectly willing
to let the matter stand where the union has
left it. We only beg to direct the attention of
tho arbiters to these facts that are disclosed
by the record.
Tho United Railroads Company In it* evi
dence produced the 'statements of 378 enrmen
who had saved sums ranging from a sum not
stated up to $3800. The union attempted to
secure admission from their witnesses that no
part of such savings were made, sine* the
strike of 1002. The union produced In answer
to these 378 statements, but upon examination
it appears ' that over 100 of them show that
they are still saving out - of their earnings
turns ranging from $5 to $20 per month and In
totals ranging as high as ?l?0. We are per
fectly willing to let this matter rest as the
union has left it.
Â¦ Superintendent Chapman was recalled
and testified. that the time-tables arranged
by Mr. Clapp were -impracticable and
forced and -could not be used by the
United Railroads in the operation of its
system. " Â¦
CommentB made' by. division superin
tendents upon the statements made by
the men were read in evidence.- They
were based on the length of time It took
the employes to qualify as house and'
track men.
An adjournment was then taken until
10 o'clock this morning.
RENTS NOT INCREASED.
In addition to this we deeire to file as United
Railroads' exhibit No. 105 the circular of In
structions Issued by the Carmen's Union to its
members directing them to obtain live of their
rent statements tilled out. And we direct the
attention of the board to the fact that the
Instructions do not ask the carmen to secure
five neighbors at haphazard and so give to
this board knowledge of the average condi
tions prevailing. The instructions ask for
"five neighbors who have had their rent
raised," and states that the union wants to
show as great a number of Increases In rent
as possible. The instructions are mandatory
and say Don't (In large type). "Don't fall to
attend to this at once, as It Is of importance,"
and Is signed "J. H. Bowling. Secretary and
Treasurer."
The United Railroads now flies its exhibit
No. 1*9, being a book of photographs of car
men's houses and homes In Ban Francisco.
The purpose of this exhibit is to show to ths
board of arbiters the character of dwellings
occupied by Ban Francisco carmen so that in
making comparisons of rent with Eastern cit
ies It may appear that there Is a wide differ
ence between the character of the carmen's
home in San Francisco and the homes of
similar laborers In the East. The photo
graphs also demonstrate that carmen's wage*
In San FranelFCO do not preclude them from
living In very comfortable and very beautiful
homes.
RAILROAD'S SIDE.
After affidavits signed by John S. Done
gan, E. J. Livernash, William H. Gould
and others were read the Carmen's Union
closed its case.
Attorney Moore, then made the follow
ing statement:
In sur-rebuttal we ask the board of arbl
trailln to observe that no rules have been ob
served by the carmen in reference to rebut
tal; that mainly air the testimony ofttred by
the Carmen's Union as, rebuttal has been on
its case in chief and was of a character that
would be ruled out if the cause was in court
and not before an arbitration board.
â¢ I give it as my opinion, based on extensive
Inquiries concerning local labor conditions, that
should the United Railroads dismiss its present
platform men and seek to replace them at an
average of $2 50 a day for a ten-hour day, that
corporation would be unable to obtain men
with whom to fill the vacant places.
In his affidavit Bowling said " he had
made, 4aqulry-an^waÂ«. led to say-,, that
the local labor market was far from be
ing congested and had less than the nor
mal supply of men- possessing fitness for
platform service on street railways-
Michael Casey makes the following
statement:
Attorney Moore moved to strike out the
affidavits of J. H. Bowling, secretary of
the Carmen's Union, and Michael Casey,
president of the Board of Public Works,
on the ground that they were /iot In re
buttal. Moore said they sounded like the
voice of Jacob, supported by the hand of
Esau. *'I admire the perfect English and
am surprised that these gentlemen- should
use It. It sounds like Livernaah," eaid
Moore sarcastically.
SOUNDS LIKE LIVEBNASH.
I am satisfied thnt $."Â« a day in California
will purchase less than f2 a day In New York.
If that be true, then the man who receives 4
in Nf-w York li really paid a higher wage.
I do know that prices to-day In the city of
San Francisco are higher than they were one
year ago.
The obligation incumbent on employers :s
denned by an eminent authority to be, "To
Kive to every one that which Is Just." Doubt
less before we ca.n decide whether wages are
adequate, many things have to be considered,
but first men and employers should remember
this, that to exercise pressure for the Bake

A letter written by Park Commissioner
Frank J. Sulllvar. was put in evidence.
It contained the following extract:
CARMEN UNDEEPAID.
An affidavit made by P. H. McCarthy,
president of the Building Trades' Council,
was read. Following is an extract!
.Â¦Â¦When these facts are fully considered and
applied to the prtse-nt important controversy
as to the wageu and houis of a certain branch
of labor in San Francieco, only one conclusion
can bi rpaelud and that is that the carmen
of this city are overworked and underpaid
when the status of all classes is considered.
They perform important and responsible duties;
life and iirooeny depend upon their fidelity
to duty, and they receive In return for their
*ervlcÂ«s about sixty per cent of, what other
laborers are given whose duties call for the
exercise of Intelligence and faithfulness, and
under the increased cost of living, which cur
rent orlces show to he from twtnty to forty
per cent, have less than any other craft of
equally skilled labor to show as a result of
their labor.

"I can cheerfully recommend Dr. MiW
Anti-Pain Pills as first-class in every respect.
They have done wonders for me. I was a
soldier in the late war and am subject to and
hare my share of the aches and pains from
the hardship tÂ£at usually falls to the lot of
the soldiers who saw service. Anti-Pain Pills
never fail to relieve the rheumatic twinges,
headacne or other pains. A number of old
comrades in this vicinity who have used Dr.
Miles' Restorative Tonic, Nervine and Nerve
and Liver Pills epeak highly of their virtues
in every respect. My health is greatly im-
proved, thanks to your Restorative Nervine,
with the exception of an old wound which
troubles tag somewhat" â Timothy J.

Rheumatic twinges, headache, and the
pains of a disordered Etomach are frequent
reminders of the strain and hardships of aa
army campaign. In all such cases tne nerves
are affected too seriously to right themselves,
and prompt treatment is necessary. The best
treatment consists of Dr. Miles' Restorative
Nervine, which restores vitality to the nerves
and helps them to throw off various disorders
which bring about pain and suffering. There
is nothing so good for the stomach and bow-
els as Dr. Miles' Nerve and Liver Pills. They
act directly upon the nerves of the digestive
organs, speedily restoring them to normal
activity.

C. P. Beam has won a reputation surpassing that of any other artist ||
in this country as a painter of fruit. "Just Gathered" is characteristic of H
his best style, which does not depend upon imitative ability alone for its H
excellence, but combines qualities of effect, composition and color bar- Â¦ j4
mony, which give his works a pictorial interest not usually found in still- M
In this picture the plums lie in the grass as if they had been freshly r I
plucked from the tree, with the bloom still on them, while a ray of sun- h
light falling on some of them and on a portion of the grass gives effect fj
and variety of color to the composition. There is something infinitely \\
more pleasing in this suggestion of a natural environment than to the U
conventional arrangement of a still life with a meaningless background, M
which is so common in most representations of fruit and flowers. - |
' -"Just Gathered" was formerly owned by Catherine M. White of II- . f
linois, who bequeathed it to the Chicago Art Institute, in whose penna- f
ncnt collection it now is. It was selected by a committee appointed by the I
art institute, along with a picture by William Hart, from a number of- Â»
fored in the bequest. |

BAR ASSOCIATION
OPENS MEETING
A thorough canvass should be made of every
block in the city for Republicans who have not
registered. This work can be most effectively
accomplished by volunteer service. If Repub
licans will devote only a little time to thie
every Republican In Â£an Francisco will be in
duced to register and we will achieve a victory
in November.
Now is the timo to register. It takes only a
few moments at the registration office at the
City Hall. The office is open from 8:30 a. m.
to 5 d. m.
Reports were received from every dis
trict showing that there was a disposition
on the part of the better element of Re
publicans who had not supported the
league tickets at the recent primary elec
tion to support and vote the Republican
ticket in November; that In most in
stances the feeling, was not against the
league and what it advocates, but was
mainly directed against individuals, and
tffat as Republicans they were now satis
fled with the result.
â¢The meeting adjourned subject to call.
THERE was a very full meeting of
the committee on organliation of
the United Republican League in
the rooms of the organization last
evening. Matters of great import
ance were discussed and preparations for
the coming campaign were made. T7ie
vice-presidents and executive committee
met in close session and outlined plans
for the election of a full Republican
ticket. â¢
The committee on organization was rep
resented by Thomas P. Riordan, Abe

It was decided that the representatives
to the central body confer with the exec
utive members of all district clubs with a
view to making a thorough canvass in
every precinct to see that every Republi
can is registered for the coming bond and
municipal elections.
Schools of instruction will be established
in each district to ttach the citizens how
to mark the new ballot. This work Is
deemed very important and all officers
and members of the executlva committee
of the district clubs will take part.
The committee on publication prepared
the following notice:
Xow is the time to see that all your Republi
can friends who did not register for the last
election are registered for the coining bond and
municipal elections.
During the uast year there have been many
changes of residences, new homes have been
built, new hotels, boarding and apartment
houses have been erected in various sections of
the city In all of these will be found Republi
cans who are not registered. Citizens who have
changed their residences since the last election
must register. Personal appeals should be
made and the Importance of registration urged.
MISS LAUGHTON

How refreshing the letter must be to
the delegates of the Republican conven
tion. Reading closely one perceives that
the eager Mayor keeps th^door open for
bolting. He does not say "accept," but
uses the term "not refuse." as follows:
If. with this statement of my position and
Â«M<* the laws of our land cive to ever}' citi
zfA of our republic.

cere ly, EUGEXE E. SCHMITZ.
The foregoing letter is addressed to the
Mayor's friends in the Republican con
vention. The Call is not able at this time
to present the Mayor's letter to his
friends in the Democratic convention. Xo
doubt our versatile chief executive, if per
mitted, would prepare and subscribe to
the Democratic platform as readily as
he would support a Republican platform
of his own manufacture.
rd a protection to capital and to labor alike
nd gives to the Â«agf-Â»arnpr an organized
pportunlty to .iÂ«ro> The political equality
To My Friends In the Republican Conven
tion: I desire to thar.k you for your efforts
to recur* for me the nomination for Mayor in
Jour â¢invention. I ewe it to you. however, to
drftne rr.y position before you proceed further.
I pfopos* to accept the nomination of the
t'nloo Labor party if it Is tfndered to me. and
to go before the people on that ticket and as
thÂ» candidate of that party, relying for pue
cess upon my ft?adfast friends, the wage
v orkers of San Krancisco, and upon the vote*
Â«~f the fair-minded and independent citizens
who believ# that I have honestly, conserva
tively and consistently endeavored to do my
duty t-r the whole people without regard to
i las?. gtati<-*n or creed, and that I have fairly
<srri.d out my prorriFe of "Equal rights to
ail aJid rpecial pnv'lrges to none" 8Â«d my
pledpc-s to deal justly by and to protect equal
ly capital and labor employer and employe
alike.
If with this statement of my position and
nfter my nominsU,-?! by the Union Labor par
ty, your convention should Â«*Â« fit to Indorse
my candidacy, and if your platform ehall be
>-uch that I can conscientiously support tt. I
vhould not refuse a nomination at the hands
of tte party to whoff df-clared national prln
<:r>s ar.d policies I have ever given my
ttrongeet adherence.
But I am firmly convinced that the necessi
ties of the times are such that strong; and firm
rr.tn who believe in the peaceful advancement
of the Toiling msj-Eea and in the Just and
equal treatment of vested interests and of
labor, organized and unorganized, should take
Th!fi stand f.rmly for the principles which they
profess. I believe that the existence of the
Tnion Labor party, under prudent and con
Â¦erratly* guidance, constitutes a safeguard
to his friends in the Republican
convention le certainly a rare contribution
to local political history. His friends are
not addressed by name, henco the public
is in the dark concerning their identity.
There Is no suggestion as to their number,
so It is left to local conjecture whether
the friends of the Mayor among the dele
gates to thÂ« Republican convention num
ber a baker's dozen or only twelve. These
?ancles, however, are merely Incidental.
The letter Itself should be presented so
that readers of all shades of political be
lief may understand, or try to under
stand, what the Mayor means.
The Call speaks advisedly when It in
vites readers of every tinge of political
opinion to read the Mayor's epistle, be
cause our Mayor during his brief and
somewhat inglorious career as chief ex
ecutive of San Francisco has joined and
deserted ail the existing political organi
zations and Is looking hopefully to the
future for other fields of action.
SCHMITZS HUMOROUS EFFORT.
Here is the Mayor's letter to his friends:
SAN FRANCISCO. August 25. 1903.
ONE possessing the ordinary sense
of humor must enjoy some of the
features cf the present municipal
campaign. Mayor Schmitz's letter
Declines Help of Phan
tom Friends Among
Republicans.
Urgent Appeal Is Made
to Citizens to Be
Registered^
His Latest Contribution
Gives Chance for
â¢ Questioning.
United Republican League
Holds a Special
Session.
Reading between the lines of Mayor
Schmitz's friendly communication to his
unidentified supporters in the Republican
convention one perceives a promise that
the "toiling masses" will not trouble the
capitalists if the Mayor is on watch. This
promise, to say the least, is premature.
The Mayor should get his own nomina
tion from the Union Labor party befor^
venturing further on this line of action.
Mayor Schmitz indeed is a handsome
man. No one with an eye for the beau
tiful can deny that fact, but the fight for
Mayor is not a "beauty contest." The
taxpayers and wageworkers want a man
In the executive office at the City Hall
who can accomplish something in the
way of public improvement. A$ jth!/igs
are going now it Is all talk and promise
and no work. Millions go for salaries,
while the streets- are unpaved and un
swept. The Mayor and his brothers of
the Schmitz family lend adornment to the
city, but in the sense of public utlllty
they are failures. The relation existing
between the Schmitzs and the municipal
treasury is doubtless delightful, but it
cannot last forever. This is a world of
change and progress. The Mayor, how
ever, is so versatile and adjustable that
he can readily adapt himself to changed
conditions, political or otherwise.
PROMISES ARE PREMATURE.
Let Mayor Schmitz now be frank and
straightforward to his friends in the Re
publican convention, and later on, If the
spirit prompts him, let him adopt, some
other method of dealing with his friends
in the Democratic camp. What seems
to be essential now is that the Mayor
should state how much money he received
for making speeches and lending his
beautiful personal presence in aid of a
Democratic nominee for Congress in New
York. Mind you, Mr. Mayor, The Call
does not insinuate that you worked for
scab wages, and neither is it the purpose
of the inquiry to ascertain if Mr. Hearst
paid more than the goods were worth.
The information is asked for in order to
ascertain how much it cost to bring a
strong adherent of the national policies
of the Republican party into the Demo
cratic Congressional camp.
Incidentally Mayor Schmitz might tell
how much Parry's coat of whitewash
cost, and what sum was required to put
Mershon In good standing. Trivial little
tilings like these and other incidents con
nected with amounts of money expended
at the recent primaries would not con
cern the oublic were it not for the fact
that the Mayor is posing as everybody's
friend and every political partj-'s cham
pion. Further along the Mayor may be
cabled upon to state, if he knows, from
what source and from whom the money
came to enable him to make his automo
bile fight on the day of the primary elec
tion.
FRANKNESS IS ASKED.
The reference of Mayor Schmitz to his
Ft rang adherence to the national â¢ princi
ples and policies of the Republican party
must be supplemented with something
like a record. As the Mayor is writing
open and promiscuous letters and gen
erally taking the public into his confi
dence It Is pertinent that he be asked
to reply to several specific questions. Let
the Mayor tell his "friends" in the Re
publican convention why he went to New
York and made a speaking campaign in
support of W. R. Hearst, the Democratic
nominee for CongTess. Is such work a
fair example of "strong adherence to na
tional principles of the Republican party?"
Why did the Mayor oppose Julius Kahn,
the Republican nominee in the Fourth
Congressional District of California?
Why did the Mayor oppose E. F. Loud,
the Republican nominee for Congress in
the Fifth Congressional District of this
State? Why did he give his support to
the Democratic nominees Livernash and
Wynne? Did strong adherence to the
national policies of the Republican party
constrain the Mayor to fight Republican
nominees?

THE MAN YOU LOVE.
IT has been said repeatedly that any woman, who is not positively
deformed, can, with tact and delicacy, win any man she sets her heart
upon, butâ can she? How many women have smilingly accepted
the compliment of the assertion in public, only to ponder the ques-
tion anxiously, oft times hopelessly, in the privacy of the boudoir.
What an old, old. problem it is. to be sure, but oh, how appallingly
new to most of the Rentier sex who will read these lines. Matrimony
â the right man â a comfortable, happy home. It is the one creat prob-
lem of a woman's life from the cradle to the grave. Thev are the ideal*
that women have always cherished, always will. And how many, or
rather, how few. realize their ideals.
It is p problem that few men can understand, or, worst of all. ever :
try to understand. Man. with his lordly assumption of all the oreroe-
atives of life worth havine. may woo and win where and when he H3t- i
eth. But to woman â passive, receptive woman â what is eiven? She ;
must wait her lover's cominsr. She may not seek, as man does, that which
pleases her most. And out of the lovers who choose to woo she/must '
make what poor selection is afforded her, and, buryinsr the ideal. srK'e all [
the fluttering, clinjjins: hope of the future to shapinpr the real' into i
something akin to the sod of her dreams. â¢
And in this world of sham and sho^. of the mad chase for wealth,
the problem has become vastly more vexatious than it ever was before. :
Even though it has been lone accepted as something akin to a ioke. it Â¦
happens all too often in real life that she loves the poor man. and must
choose between him and a wealthier though less undesirable suitor. \
Perverse woman, say the knowing and the worldly: but onlv the j?irl i
who has been confronted with such a problem can realize the heartburn- :
ing. the sublime emotional tragedy of it all. Whichever way she chooses 'â¢
some great pa* of the ideal is shattered and â what then? !
Every wonmn who reads is sacking the answer to just such a ques- :
Hon. Just a few of those who w r '*c have tried to answer it for her. :
Such a one is the "Half-Hour-Storiette" x in the next Sunday Call, en- i
? titled "When Jabberwock Rode." Curious title.' isn't it? Well, it is a j
curious story, and one that answe rs the problem as â well, read it and !
see if you would answer it that way. If you are a weman it is ten ;
chances "to one you would or â would you?
Perhaps, after all. you wouldn't, for there is another story that solves :
the riddle in ? different wav. It is called "Betwixt Dad and Toe." but Â« Â¦
the problem before the girl is not exactly what you would infer from i
that titleâ indeed not bv a great deal/ Nor can you guess what man- :
ner of finesse she used to brin<jr about a happy endtl?gâ the onlv sort an
ardent girl will ever accent. Still another is "Under the Car of the :
Juggernaut." but the srirl in this story did* not have things as much her :
own way as you mijrht think she did frcm such a title. Or does that , :
title convey as clear a' conrrntiÂ° n Â°f what a remarkable storv this is â¢
a 5 a v.-ell selected title should? You'll be able to decide that question. :

' Mnm J |B H||| -^ u Â¦ - ' MmmamammmMmmmmmnuHmmmmmatmmjwam^ / iMayor Harrison of Chicago, several times chosen
cs the chief executive of the Windy City and va
riously mentioned for offices of emolument and dig
nity in the nation, has announced that at the expira
tion of his term he will retire and seek rest. It is al
wayj encouraging that when one of our office-holders
determines to find quiet and peace of mind the rest
of us are sure to find it. This is one of the amenities
of American public life.
The people of Nevada are earning our esteem and
eternal gratitude. The manner in which they are
harvesting our crop of escaped convicts is good^o
the California soul. While we regret exceedingly to
let anything get away from us, even a savage human
brute, it makes us glad to secure the return of. what
we have lost by our painstaking and courageous
neighbors. It is interesting also to observe that in
this strenuous work Nevada has not yet found the
co-operation of the militia an essential to success.
CARNEGIE'S gift of $2,500,000 of 5 per cent
bonds to Dumferline, his native town, for
the purpose of "introducing sweetness and
light into the monotonous lives of the toiling masses"
is altogether the nearest approach to originality in
the way of a public benefit that he has yet accom
plished. It is to be noted that the money is not de
voted to any speciTic form of conferring sweetness
and light, nor to any particular kind of light and
sweetness. Virtually the donation* serves as an en
dowment for an experimental school of public philan
thropy. The trustees of the fund are at liberty to
try whatever methods they deem best and may
change them at any time.
In delivering the fund to # the trustees Mr. Carnegie
exhorted them to not to be afraid of making mis
takes, but to go ahead trying various plans as they
may be suggested from time to time. "The problem
before you," he said, "involves no question but that
of determining what can be done in towns to bene
fit the masses by money in the hands of the most
public-spirited citizens." He went on to say that if
the experimenters could demonstrate that such help
could be given successfully they would "open new
fields for the use of wealth."
Thus Dumferline is to become an experimental
station in philanthropy, and the world will watch
with more than ordinary interest the results of the
early experiments. . It is to be hoped the trustees
are men of original and inventive -minds and will
devise schemes worthy cf the attention that will be
given them. It is a foregone conclusion that the tax
payers will try to get the revenues used in such a
way as to lighten the burdens of taxation to some
extent. The trustees will have to fight against that
proposition. Next there will be the invariable rush
of '"grafters" seeking to get the money directed in
some channel that will benefit them. , Against those
also the experimenters will have to contend. Again,
there will be well-to-do. citizens who will try to have
the money expended in civic luxuries for their
class rather than tor the toiling masses; and, finally,
there will be many of the toilers themselves who
will try to get an Unfair share of the donations. It
is an old saying that it is harder to give money
away wisely than to .earn it, and doubtless the trus
tees when they enter upon their experimenting will
find ample proof of the. truth of fr
DUMFERLINE EXPERIMENTS.
It is reported that Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria entertains a serious intention of abdicating as
King of Hungary. While the report is probably un
true, one could not censure the aged monarch, or
anybody else who values his life, from getting as far
away as possible, either in person or influence, from
the bloody scenes of the Balkans. The slaughter
of the Turks and of the Macedonian "liberators" fur
nishes good reading if nobody else is hurt.
Were nothing more needed than to bring the fac
tional leaders together the task would be easy to the
astute Marylander, for he is a past master of the art
of handling political machines. It happens, however,
that something more than the machines will be need
ed in the coming campaign. Democracy demoralized
and discredited must be reformed through and
through before it can command the support of the
conservative elements of the people, and without the
support of a considerable percentage of that element
it has no possible chance of electing its candidate.
Gorman must, therefore, form a platform which will
hold together the stalwarts that have followed Bryan
and at the same time win over large numbers of men
of the class that made Cleveland's election possible.
That is the issue before him and this winter he is to
have an opportunity to meet it and solve it if he can.
A moderate man himself, with no decided convic
tions one way or another, Senator Gorman naturally
believes that what Democracy needs most just now
is a mild and conciliatory policy with respect to every
issue in sight. He appears to be especially desirous
of conciliating those large combinations of capital
whose newspaper organs have displayed an open an
tagonism to Roosevelt, and it seems he has already
succeeded to a considerable extent. The -Washing
ton correspondent of the Boston Transcript in dis
cussing Gorman's course says: "It is said that in
many high finance circles he would be regarded as a
'safer man' at the helm than the present President,
whose renomination. is assured. That this would
lead to the actual identification of high finance with
a Democratic candidate is unlikely, but that it would
greatly lessen the usual enthusiasm of business circles
for the Republican ticket .and so check the flow of
contribution in that direction is entirely probable.
The Democrats would have gained something by
SENATOR GORMAN is to have the opportu
nity of his life this winter. Holding a command
ing position among the Democratic members of
Congress it is within the reach of an able manager
of men to so control and direct them as to induce
them to adopt and maintain a definite policy of ac
tion with respect to the legislation of the session.
Should he succeed in formulating a statesmanlike
programme and in bringing his Democratic col
leagues into a cordial support of it, the chances are
that he would go into the national convention with
a prestige above all rivals and so obtain the nomina
tion for the Presidency on a platform that would
give him a reasonable chance of winning.
It is well known that Gorman is a colorless politi
cian. He is not a free trader, he is not a high pro
tectionist. He is not a Cleveland Democrat, neither
is he a Bryan Democrat. He stood with his party in
1896 and in 1900, but he did not affiliate with the
men in control at that time. He holds, therefore, a
middle of the road position between the two fac
tions and if he be adroit enough may succeed in
bringing the following of both sides over to his sup
port.
THE GORMAN CAMPAIGN
Noises of - threatened war upon Russia are hum
ming through the cables from Japan. It would not
be uninteresting to know if the little brown man of
the East takes himself seriously in these demonstra
tions of a militant spirit. A bantam rooster is an
amusing object in his fighting moods, but when one
looks at his spurs and thinks of the bear one i is
tempted to believe that there can be something worse
than the Spanish-American war.
Within a very few months four hunters, mistaken for
deer, ha\c been shot to death by their friends While
this may seem to the compiler of mortality statistics
a most lamentable showing, the rest of us have
takien courage and congratulation to ourselves in the
fact that State laws provide a closed season in which
deer may not be. hunted and human beings may not
be killed as a pastime.
The \videsprea4. demand for reform in public ac
counting, which his become a public issue in the
politics: of liinois, Ohio and other Sates, includes
this, demand that public utility bonds rest entirely
upoh the income of the property for which they are
issued. Indeed, it is not saying too much to say that
everyo-here the old and expensive plan of making
such boz{& or the plants which they purchase in any
respect a burden on the general taxpayer is obsolete,
and dries 'like Oakland and San Francisco surely
will not ipvolTe themselves in a plan that is utterly
discredited by experience.
In Kansas City, Mo., the people are just reaping
the harvest of that mistake. In 1895 that city issued
bonds and took the water works. In the first year
of their operation by the municipality the income
an d<> salaries and wages were the same as for the
previous year under private ownership, the income
being $397,627 end the salaries and wages $78^298.
At o a crecer.t meeting of the Improvement Associa
tion Judge Brcmback submitted the subsequent sta
tistics which show that, in the six years since, the
inccaTie has increased only 13 per cent while salaries
and wages have increased 93 per cent, and that the
plant is out of repair, extensions are required and
there are no earnings to make them, and more bonds
must be issued to bring the supply up to the de
mand.
The figures also show that there has been no de
crease in rates to the householder. To offset this,
however, Mr. Reed submitted figures to prove that,
while the householder has had no reduction and is
paying the same rate that was exacted by the private
water company, the large corporations, like the
stockyards and packing companies, get their water
at one-fourth the rate paid by the householderl
Whatever comfort there is in that is the only solace
of the householder. The conclusion of the meeting
was that "city water management stands forth before
the voters and taxpayers as a horrible example,
warning them not to allow themselves to be misled
into further municipal ownership experiments"; and
the -rity water plant is referred to by the press of the
city as "the water works elephant"
While the rate remains the same to the house
holder, his property is taxed to make good to the
general fund the drain of the bonds and the excesses
of city administration of the plant.
Kansas City has a population of 163,752. Oakland
has 80,000. It is a good time for Oakland to begin
right and stay right and know what she is doing.
-jr' t E have endeavored to present the argument
.VA/jn favor of starting right in the issue oi
Â¦ V municipal bonds ior the purchase of public
uu..i.ci. Wherever that argument has been pre
icn^ed-'it'is admitted to be unanswerable. If it be
possible to secure a business administration under
public ownership it must be by making every public
plant support :ts cost by paying the principal and
interest of its boad issue and the cost of administra
tion, beMerraect, repair and enlargement. Then the
i<eopfe ran see every year a balance sheet that shows
them precisely where they stand. This is impossible
when sinking fnr.d and interest, or other items, arc
charged 'pi to tie general iand, or when bonds have
to be issued, as hi* been done in Xcw York, for en
largement and betterment, and made a burden on the
general iund. â¢

Â«^ ONSULAR Reports for August contains a
| report from Consul Britain of Kehl on Araer
\-*S ican dried fruits in Germany and one from
Consul Ridgely of Nantes. on the opening for dried
fruits in France-, Neither gives a detailed statement
of the situation* but each contains information of
interest to American fruit producers and especially
to those of California-. ; Moreover, despite their brev
ity,, the reports can be read with satisfaction, for they
give promise of the coming of a time when we shall
have a large and profitable market for our fruits in
those countries-.
Of the German market Consul Britain says* "For
this part of Germany, namely, Baden and Alsace
Lorraine, I find the outlook for increased sales most
encouraging-. From the leading importer in the
western part of Germany I learn that California
prunes and 3pricots are rapidly supplanting the pro
ducts or France and Germany* The California fruit
is cheaper and it* flesh is brighter and more solid/'
Consul Ridgely says of the outlook in France:
"There U a growing market in all western and north
western France for American dried fruits (the prunes
of Southern California being most in request) and
the demand is unusually active this year because ot
the almost complete failure of the French crop. * * *
The merchants here are interested in California
prunes, dried apricots and dried apples; they wish
particularly to hear from California firms that will
export those products direct to Nantes, as they do
not care to do business through the middlemen at
Antwerp, Hamburg and Liverpool."
A word of advice is given by Consul Britain with
respect to packing and shipping. He says: "Speak
ing of the packing and drying, my informant tells
me that he has no fault to find except with the man
ner in which the boxes are put together. He says
there would be less breakage if the bo^es were dove
tailed instead of being simply nailed. Regarding
the time in transit, he says he hÂ»3 experienced con
siderable annoyance and some loss of trade in con
sequence of shipments being delayed en route from
California. One shipment was over ten weeks on
the way; the buyers think the goods were held in
New York several weeks."
The suggestions deserve the attention of packers
and shippers. Dovetailed boxes would probably cost
more than those nailed together, but it might be
found profitable to make use of them for shipments
to foreign countries. The delay of goods in transit
3t New York could doubtless be overcome by the
exercise ofijudicious prodding from this end of the
line. In short the European market seems worth
having, and if so then of course it is worth work
incc for. ' ,

In the developments of the trial of Whitaker

in life a splendid success in playing*with other peo
ple's money;, he can make the world stand aghast at
his gigantie failure-.

â¢ State Mineralogist Aubury gives notice
in a circular letter to owners of Califor
nia mines that collectors of samples of
minerals to be exhibited are in the field
and the co-operation of the mine owners
is asked for that a good show may be
Insured. Minerals for exhibition can be
sent to the State Mining Bureau free of
charge by express if the weight is twenty
pounds or under; by freight if the weight
exceeds twenty pounds.
It is supposed that the show of Cali
fornia shrubbery and trees will make 'a
striking appearance at St. Louis for the
reason of its peculiarity and because the
California building will be placed on a
hill where it will be seen all over the
grounds. The shrubbery and trees will
also teli the truth about the climate of
San Francisco to millions of spectators
who will view them while the exposition
lasts:
President Ai B. Spreckels of the Board
of Park Commissioners has notified the
California Commissioners to the St. Louis
Exposition that all the plants that are
needed for the institution of a typical
collection of the characteristic growths
of California to surround the California
building on the exposition grounds at St.
Louis -will be supplied by ' Golden Gate
Park. Mr. Spreckels writes that the
Park board has decided to grant the re
quest that was made for such specimens
from Golden Gate Park and that Super
intendent McLaren has been instructed
to give all assistance neeessary to the St;
Louis Commissioners.
As a result of this definition of a Cali
fornia resident student a great many stu
dents have been obliged to pay the feo
this. year, although they had not done so
previously. Many have paid under pro
test, and their cases will be acted upon
at the next meeting of the board of trus
tees. Their action will be awaited with]
considerable interest by thÂ© students.
In case any Injustice arises from this rulinÂ«
the proper remedy is to be obtained by present-
Ing his case In the form of a petition to the
board of trustees, which will consider UnÂ»
matter In the case of students wishing to
enter for tha corolnr year, at Its meeting on
August 29. DAVID S. JORDAN,
President.
As a result of this attempt tp evade the
registrar the board of trustees of the uni
versity have denned what students shall
be considered exempt from payment of
the registration fee. President Jordan ha3
posted the following bulletin on the sub
ject:
ThÂ« board of trustees have directed that stu
dents shall be registered from the place from
which, they originally enter the university; that
is a man cannot gain or lose his residence by
entering a school. Only these students should
be regarded as residents of California who
were originally registered from that Stat*.
The following is their resolution covering this
matter: "That all students not having lived in
the State of California for at least one year
before their first registration as students shall
be presumed to be non-residents so long a-Â»
they may remain connected with the univer
sity as students: that this regulation applies
to old as well as to new students. That tha
treasurer of the university shall collect tha
registration fees before the registration of stu
dents."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 28.â
An order has been Issued from the presi
dent's office in regard to tie payment of
registration fees by certain classes of stu
dents, and considerable displeasure is be
ing expressed by those students, who have
been compelled under the new rising to
pay a $10 or $13 registration fÂ«e they have
heretofore escaped paying. Since the
passage of the Stanford constitutional
amendment California residents have been
exempt from the payment of registration
fees. Immediately following the adoption
of the amendment there was a wonderful'
increase in the number of students regia
tering as residents of California.
Special Dispatch to The Call
At the afternoon session of the board
C. L. Ortman, Assessor of Ban Joaquin
County, appeared. He said San Joaquin
had as rich lands as any county in the
State, but the farming lands have de
preciated in value, just as they have de
preciated all over the State. Of late a
considerable area has been planted to
fruit and vines, particularly In the vicin
ity of Lodt.
Alameda County sent a strong delega
tion to oppose a raise, but the session
of the board was uneventful. Assessor
Henry P- Dalton and his chief deputy.
Thomas Robinson, were the only protest
ants called upon. In 1902 the assessed
valuation of Alameda County was I88.S99,
997, while this year's returns show $103,
874.8S1. an increase of Il6.974.8S4 for the
year. This advance Is due to the en
hanced value of real estate and improve
ments principally^ All cities and towns
in the county show a healthful Increase
In assessment, save IJvermore. . There
a loss of little more than $13,000 Is found.
Assessor Dalton said this was due to a
falling off In personal- property returns.
Some mortgages held by Oakland Savings
banks show a falling off of 14 per cent
In assessments, but neither Dalton nor
the board having any means of telling
what mortgages these are, the former
was unable to account for the loss.
The matter was taken under â¢ advise
ment*
Assessor J. F. Campbell, A. E. Clary,
chairman of the Board of Supervisors,
and C* S. Abbott appeared before the
board In the Interest ot Stanislaus
County.
Stanislaus assessment roll for 1903 Is
$11,237,685. an increase of $430,020 over the
valuation of last year.
Assessor Campbell stated that litigation
over water rights had much to do with
retarding the sale and development of
lands In the county.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 26.-AJameda
County was before the State Board of
Equalization to-day fff show .cause why
the assessed valuation as returned by
the Assessor should not be raised.
The Mayor proposes to be the npminee of the
Union Labor party and to accept the Republican en
dorsement, provided he is permitted to write the Re
publican platform-.
It will be seen, then, that he puts a condition to
his acceptance of Republican support and frees him
self from all obligations for such support
His administration will be a Union Labor adminis
tration and the compensation of Republicans i5 to
be the pleasure of supporting him.
That is no unfair statement of the terms Mayor
Schmitz offers-. It is true he says he is a Republican
in national politics, but his record refutes the state
ment. Thus he say9 in his letter to his "friends in
the Republican convention"* ''If your platform
shall be such that I can conscientiously support it,
I should not refuse a nomination at the hands of a
party to whose declared national principles and
policies I have ever given my strongest adherence-."
That statement comes queerly from a man who in
the last congressional campaign made a journey from
San Francisco to New York to urge the election of
a Democratic candidate for Congress-. Does Mayor
Schmitz really believe he was giving his "strongest
adherence'* to the declared national principles and
policies of the Republican party when he was stump
ing the New York tenderloin for Hearst?
Setting that issue 'aside for the time^ the question
for the Republican party to considej is whether it
can afford to take Mayor Schmitz on his own terms
and ribbon him with a premium at his own estimate
of his merits-. A man must be quite great and in
high favor with gods and men to occupy such a
position as he claims-. The Mayor has proven him
self prudent in some situations during his term* and
of this he makes the most in his letter* b.y presenting
himself as the master of labor and the muzzier of its
tendenc}' to threaten capital*.
This is an appeal for the support of capital by pro*
claiming a power to keep labor in the traces and
restrain it from doing damage,.
Perhaps the Republican party will consider the
need ot such a high sheriff set over the element
which the Mayor says he can control to be greater
than its .need of organic vitality and individuality.
If so it will take the Mayor at his own estimate and
abandon its independent function as a political party.
On the other hand there may be those in the party
who will revolt at the dictation of the conditions
â¢ under which they are to be permitted to vote for the
I Mayor* Some may not revolt at playing second
fiddle, but the Mayor insists that the second fiddler
must use a soaped bow.
of the success of Mr. Livernash, who; by a precisely
similar move, got the Democratic endorsement for
Congress while holding himself entirely free of obli
gations for the favor.
THE letter of Mayor Schmitz to his friends in
the Republican Convention would be more re
markable if.it were original It is the. reflection

<That Gorman intends. to make the best use he can
of his opportunity is already apparent. He has de
clared himself adverse to any factional opposition to
a currency bill, he has 'diminished the cry for free
trade down to a suggestion of tariff reform, he has
declared that trusts are not an issue and has asserted
the importance to Democracy of getting rid of the
old issues of 1 896V that he will do his uttermost to
get his Democratic colleagues in Congress to accept
the policy 'of moderation is certain. His campaign
has been virtually begun and one of the most inter
esting features of tbfe coming session will be the
struggle between him and the radicals of his party.

Robert J. Paterson, as trustee of the
estate of Fred J. Bertolani, filed a com- {
plaint in the United States District j
Court yesterday against John Cnopius
Jr. and Leon de Geus of the firm of j
Cnopius & r>e Geus of Santa Rosa. The
complaint alleges that on February 6 j
of the present year Bertolani, being at j
the time Insolvent, paid to Cnopius &
Dc Geus the sum of $3182, the whole j
amount of his indebtedness to them, and
a fo assigned to them his grocery ,
and contents on Fourth street, Santa !
Rosa, valued at $SO0O. It la alleged that '
the payment and transfer were made by
Ecrtolani for the purpose of preferring
Cnopius & l>e Geus over the other cred- :
Itors and that Cnopius & De.Geus were j
aware that Bertolani was an insolvent. Â¦
It Is further alleged that the defendants '
did not pay Bertolani a reasonable con
rtderatJon for the stock and fixtures of
the grocery.
The complaint avers that twenty- J
five creditors have proved claims I
aggregating $1201 against Bertolani \
and that they are unsecured, and !
complainant asks that an order ;
be made commanding the defend- j
ants to hold the property In trust for the ;
plaintiff as trustee of the estate of Ber- :
tolani, bankrupt; that they be required \
to account for the property or its value !
and to deliver the same to the plaintiff.
D. S. District Judge de .Â»iaven yester- j
day made an order commanding the
United States Marshal to take charge of
the stock of the Ely Stern Company,
bankrupt. In the company's stores at
767 and 840 Market street and 137 '
Stockton street. It appears from the I
papers in the case that the Ely Stern |
Company made an assignment to Reuben j
Cohen, but that he failed to qualify as !
assignee and did not file an inventory
as required by law. It is alleged that
acting &s Euch assignee he disposed of
a large portion of thft property. On
August Is Judge de Haven made an
order restraining Cohen from disposing
of any part of the property or procseds.
Notwithstanding this order Cohen, it is
alleged, paid the claims of certain of the
employes out of the proceeds of sales. It
is â¢ further Bet forth that between mid
night of August 24 and T, o'clock on
the morning of the 25th Cohen removed

The ho!d-un in John Bohner's saJoon,
et 300 Turk street, live minutes before
midnight on Tucsdav night is acknowl
edged by the police to have been one of
the most daring and coolest on record.
JEven at that hour of the night there are,
as a rule, many people passing the cor
ner and electric cars are running both
on Turk and Leavcnworth streets. As
a matter of fact a car stopped on the
corner at the time of the hold-up and
one of the victims, Bruce D. KInnis, re
marked to the footpad who was operat
ing inside the eAdoij, "You had better
hurry up. as a car has stopped outside."
"I know it," coolly retorted the foot
pad, "but I suppose you want & chance to
rap rcy face, and you wont get It."
"Xo, I don't," said Kinnis. "but my
arms 'are retting tired with being held
up so Ions:."
The footpad who remained on guard
outside was apparently nervous, as he
would frequently look into the saloon and
i-ay "Do hurry up, friend," but he was
told' by his friend, who was coolly gath
ering in the coin and Jewelry, not to
worry.
Detectives Wren and Bailey -worked on
case for several hours, but could get
no trace of the two footpads. Each had
his face covered with a large polka dot
handkerchief and the only description the
officers had to work upon was the size
rt the men and the clothes they wore.
The officers are satisfied that the one who
lined Banner and his customers up and
M-arche8 them is an old hand at the busi
ness. Bohncr afktd him not to take all
of his coin, but to leave him Fomethlng
for change, and he cald: "All right; I'll
cave you a few nickels."
The footpads secured from Bohner a
run metal watch and $25; from Kinnis. a
fold watch, chain and charm; from James
j . Simpson, 23 cents; from Charles H.
loander. a gold filled watch; from Charles
\' . Rust. 5 cents, and from Henry

The Eppinger case was up again be
fore Referee Milton Green yesterday.
Deputy Grain Inspector Gove of the Mer
chants' Exchange was the principal' wit
ness. From him the surprising- Intelli
gence was gleaned that between his first
visit to the Crockett warehouse on. May
19 and a second visit on June 1 a block
Of barley known as lot No. 550 has sud
denly turned into a block of wheat. How
this remarkable transformation had tak
en place the witness did not make fully
clear, but he testified that the change
had taken place.
Both afternoon and morning' sessions
were devoted to trying to locate the title
of the property in the possession of the
bankrupt firm in the Crockett warehouse.
â¢As usual, the big array of legal talent
was on hand, as well as parties having
Interests in the defunct firm. Attorneys
Chickering and Gregory represented the
American National Bank, Attorneys
Freldenrich, Lilienthal and Alfred Sutro
appeared for the creditors, Henry Ach
for the Eppingers, Max Blum for M. Blum
& Co. and Vice President T. E. Fields
and Attorney Gavin McNab for the Bank
of Monterey.
Afthe morning session Chief Grain In
spector Bunker of the Merchants'' Ex
change was called. He stated that in
May he hail gone up to Crockett and
had inspected or looked at certain parcels
of wheat from a schedule that Mr. Bowles
of the American National Bank had given
him. The wheat in question he had lo
cated in the warehouse, the same being:
pointed out to him by Mr. Demming. He
returned his reports to Mr. Bowles, and
that was the last he saw of them.
Mr. Gove occupied practically the en
tire afternoon session. All the attorneys
present took a hand in questioning' him,
with only a fair showing of results. The
witness had made several trips to Crock
ett, but had always relied when there
entirely upon the word of Mr. Demming
for the number of bags in the different
lots of wheat in the schedule that had
been furnished to him. He had seen the
different lots and had properly designated
them" himself, but he had never counted
any of the bass in them. He took Mr.
Demming's word absolutely.
He made a visit there on May 19, and
one on June I. During the intervening
period the only change noted by him was
the change of the lot 550 of barley into
lot 550 of wheat. On June 4 he went
there again. This time he found some
shortages in some of the different piles.
He could not say how manyâ perhaps
there were ten or twelve piles that were
shortâ he was not positive. He did not
count them, but he judged by observa
tion only. He could not . remember the
exact amount of shortages; Mr.. Dem
ming was Dresent at all his visits.
The witness stated that when he made
his first visit there he had a list of the
wheat he was to inspect made out by
Mr. Bunker, and he also carried a letter
with him signed by Mr. Eppinger. which
he presented to Mr. Demming. The list
he referred to embraced about thirty-six
lots.
Regarding the marking of the wheat.
Gove stated that some was marked in
ink and some in blue pencil. Dust would
cover bags so that in a couple of months'
time the marks would become almost in
visible. No chancre was made in mark
ing on the bags between May 19 and June
1, but on June 4 he noticed that a great
deal of re-marking had taken place.
Edwin Freund was called, but threw no
light on the subject. He was only em
ployed In the offlce. He seldom went into
the warehouse and then what he did was
under Demming's instructions. He could
not sav that during the year 1903 there
had been any wheat in the warehouse
belonging to others than the Eppingers.
He had not seen the receipts because
they were made out in San Francisco.
The hearing was adjourned until next
Wednesday at 10 o'clock.

ed against Mlas Dolbeer.
.|-^ EL, MONTE, Aug. 26.â The weath-
er hns been brilliant to-day, a
jj little warm for the golfers but
'1-^ delightful for the gallery. In the
morning Dr. C. H. Walter of the
Linda Vista Golf Club of San Jose and C.
Ejx Orr of the Pasadena Country Club
drove oft from the first tee" in the final
match, over thirty-six holes, for the Del
Monte cup for men. Orr*s ball . waÂ«
"sliced" and landed In the road, while
Dr. Walter "topped" his ball.
Dr. Walter played a steady game,
scarcely ever getting off the course. He
drove almost as long a ball as his op
ponent and approached well, while his
putting was remarkably accurate. At the
close of the morning's play he was 4 up.
He entered on the last eighteen holes in
the afternodh. with an excellent prospect
of victory'. All he had to do was to halve
fifteen holes with his adversary and he
was safe. He halved the first hole, but
Orr took the next four holes, making the
match all even at the twenty-third hole.
At the thirty-second hole Orr was 2 up.
The thirty-third hole was halved. Walter
won the thirty-fourth hole, his opponent's
score telng 1 up and two to play. The
thirty-fifth hole was halved, making the
score 1 up and 1 to play. At the last hole
Orr holed out from the edge of the green,
winning the hole and match.
The two players were followed by near
ly all the golfers now staying at the Hotel
del Monte, the keen struggle being much
enjoyed.
Robert Johnstone of the San Francisco
Golf Club, Alexander Bell of the San Ra
fael Golf Club and George Smith of the
Oakland Golf Club reached Del Monte

Third race, trotting, 2:15 class, heats three
SUMMARY,
Dr. Hammond, the crack trotting pros
pect, will not be seen at Sacramento. Af
ter his engagement here the Doctor will
tia\el over the Washington and Oregon
circuit, where it is thought he can lower
the colors of Sweet Marie, now carrying
everything before her in that part of the
country.
Of course the $1500 Pacific Slope stakes
for 2:3u class pacers was the feature evÂ«.-nt
ot the day. Ben F, the Pleasanton hor&e,
capitally driven by Chadbourne. made a
straight heat affair of this, too, wiggling
around the ellipse twice in 2:ll*j. Before
i he first heat Ben brought $20, Rajah $5,
Miss Georgle $3, Jonesa Basler $3 and the
field $3. Miss Georgie was^ the only one
possessing speed enough to give the fav
orite a brush, Cecil tbrice landing the
game mare in the place. The friends of
Captain Goodall expected big things of
Rajah, but the gelding stepped on his
peaigree in the first heat and ran Into the
distance judge's red bunting. Colonel C
stepped three clever heata.
Apparently little interest attached to
the 2:15 trot, for which a field of but five
came down for the word, as the betting
was extremely light. Ole, the luke
warm favorite, took the first two heats
reeled off, and it looked all over but the
shouting. Then McDonald appeared to
have studied out what Hollo needed and a
liberal use of the persuader landed the
three following heats, Ole tiring badly.
Jloilo trotted the third heat in 2:15. In
what early pooling was done Ole sold a
$2J to $5 favorite over the field. After his
win of the third heat the betting condi
tions were just reversed, Iloilo selling
against the other four. The gray mare
Louise Croner went one good heat.
After ZCany and May Ayers had been
driven to beat ":30 the 2:30 class trot was
called. The chestnut gelding Deputy,
handled by C. W. Whitehead, sold a 2 to
1 favorite over the field and won in
ttraight heats. Telephone had\ quite a
following, but was distanced In the fir.n
htat, giving Hurlick no chance to ring
him up after that. Rosy "Woodburn w;'.s
the contender in each of the three licats
trotted, forcing the winner out in 2:15 In
the second.
The old stand at Kenilworth Park did
net creak and groan under the weight of
the load it had to carry as In the days
of old, when every farmer brought his
largest pumpkin to town "by gosh," but
Â»t*H it was well filled, with the fair sex
predominating. There were carriages and
traps of all descriptions scattered here
and there about the grounds. Around the
pool boxes was a healthy gathering of
speculators, though it must be said they
were a bit dull about unlimbering and the
betting could have been more brisk.
Warm weather and a fast track left
rrothing wanting in that respect.
The suave and much maligned book
maker with his quiet little sixty per cent
book was not there. Instead Tom Hur
lick peddled out $2 pari mutuel tickets
and Oeorge Tuttle in the auction box at
tended to the wants of the bigger bet
tors. A. A. Cohen of Alameda acted as
presiding and starting judge, with R. S.
Brown and Dr. McClay as associates.
Much time was lost between heats and
more was consumed in useless scoring.
For this reason visitors from San Fran
cisco were compelled to leave for home
before the finish of the 2:15 trot. If the
officials would Snforce the rules relating
to punctuality, it would give great satis
faction to all.
TETALUMA. Augr. 26.â It has possibly
remained for Ix>u Dillon, the wonderful
California mare and now Queen of the
Turf, to revivify interest in the harness
horse. The four-day meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Trotting Horse Breeders' As
sociation which commenced at Petaluma
to-day, attracted an attendance that must
assuredly have been gratifying to the
management.

filly Sweet Gretchen, daughter of Flying

to the fact that for at least a hundred
yards after the start Sals, an added
starter, ridden by Creamer, who has re
cently been engaged to ride by E. II.
Thomas, so badly hampered R. T. Wil
son's colt that'he never had a chance and
finished far in the rear. Leonidas, who
made his first appearance since he won
the stallion stake at Morris Park in the
spring, ran a creditable race and was
beaten only in the last few strides by
Sweet Gretchen, ridden by Fuller.

however, captured the purse. Miss Go

fifty yards from the wire, but Kindred
came with a grand burst of speed and
just managed to get his neck in front of
the favorite. The weather was- clear, the

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26.â Two former
national leaguers, . both of the Brooklyn team,
opposed each other from the pitcher's eminence
In this afternoon's game. Doctor Newton beat
Jay Hughes because he was steadier at crit
ical nointg and because the team behind him
fielded and ran bases better. Both were hit
hard at times. Hughes was unfortunate In
letting the locals get most of theirs in two
innings, resulting in nine runs, while Newton
scattered them all along the route. Dolan got
a clean "home run hit In the sixth, sending
Andrews in ahead of him. Jud Smith was
hit on his right forearm by a pitched ball and
retired. Wheeler going to third, Dillon to sec
ond and Hurlburt to first. Attendance 1500.

was cast to the winds. Butler and Fitzgerald
were both retired in the fourth. Brown went
in for Sacramento and Loucka for Portland.
Both had their troubles, five hits being made off

Herr seemed all right while the game,
was young. Up to the seventh he had the
Cripples blanked and they seemed des
tined to be shut out. But in the seventh,
with men on first and second, Mr. Hille
brand showed he could come through
when the time was ripe and he proceeded
to bang out a hit to right field. Mr.
Neany neglected to Intercept the course
of the rapidly traveling sphere and so
two runs came in, tying up the score.
In ,the next round Mr. Herr filled' the
bases immediately. He first walked Mur
doch. Francks and Messerly sacrificed
and were safe on misplays. "With the
bases full Cooper hit safely and a pair
of the runners made the trip to the plate.
In the ninth round they began to get
after Herr again, and. before it all ended
two more had made the circuit and the
fun was at an end.
The natives had a swell chance to get
back a good many runs and perhaps win
the game outright in the last inning. The
ba*ses were all decorated with a Frisco
player and only one man was gone. Hen
was up and smote the air thrice. So did
Danny Shay. These feats were . the last
performed in the game. The score: *]
Mr. Herr did nicely at Recreation Park
yesterday afternoon till the critical mo
ment was at hand, when he was not
there. Victory seemed due to alight once
more in the camp of the home team and
everything went along nicely until the
eighth was at hand. After that, the win
ning combination was broken up and the
Cripples brought home the honors. Score,

BERKELEV. Auk. 2Â«.â Max Thelen, presi
dent of the Associated Students, announces in
the Dally CaUfomlan to-day that the executive
committee of the Associated Students has de
cided to reorganize the glee club and the rules
governing the membership. As now consti
tuted, he says, the club does not represent the
best musical talent of the university and the
deportment of its members is not above re
proach. The executive committee proposes
that the eingera be selected by a competent
committee of musicians, whose recommendation
will be equivalent to giving the candidate
membership tn the club. In the past a can
didate may have 6uceessfully passed the ex
amining committee, but he ran the chance of
being subsequently rejected when he applied
for admission Into" the club, with the result
that the quality of the singing has declined
In artistic value. Â¦ The deportment of the mem
bers when on the road will be governed by
the new rule* and a . violation of these will
mean dismissal.

The Board of Public Works this after
noon adopted a resolution of protest
against the application of the Southern
Pacific Company to the United States
Board of Harbor Engineers to change the
pierhead and bulkhead' Â«Â»nes in the north
arm of the estuary in order that the
company may make Its proposed fill of
the trestles across the estuary at First
and Seventh streets. -
The company purposes to cut the width
of the waterway from 900 feet to 200 feet
by filline on each side of the trestles
for a distance of 350 feet. This move,
the opponents claim, wojild destroy-ap
proximately 3000- feet of available harbor
frontage along each side of the estuary
arm. Besides it is urged that there would
be a serious interference with the proper
hydraulic action 6f the tides upon Lake
Merritt by the reduction of the width of
the- water channel. It is also represented
that the flushing of the main lake sewer
would be seriously disturbed.
These were some of the principal ob
jections raised to-day at the special meet

To Give Entertainment.
Attack has been made on the flre alarm"
and police telegraph system of this .city,
which is one of the most Important safe
guards for the protection of citizens and
property In the municipal service. Wires
connecting the police patrol boxes with (
the Central police station have been cut'
by miscreants, and this made useless a
number of the call boxes and seriously in
terfered with the policing of the city.
Failure last night of boxes to properly
operate caused an Investigation to be
made to-day by Superintendent Babcock
of the city's electrical department. The
search" for trouble located three cut lines
running from poles at Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-second streets and San Pablo ave
nue. The wires had been severed, and the
cuts showed that the work was not acci
dental, because other wires on the poles
were not disturbed. Only those that ran
directly from the boxes were thus parted,
thereby causing the box to go out of Ber
vice.
Reports were filed to-night with the po
lice concerning the malicious act.
Hitherto the wire-cutting that has been
prevalent since the beginning of the tele
phone company's strike of linemen has
been confined to wires and cables used by
ttite company. Last night's affair Is new
because of the danger. in the cutting out
of communication with" police headquar
ters. So serious Is the matter that special
instructions have been issued to all pa
trolmen to be vigilant In their watch for
the "perpetrators of the mischief. The re
ports have also been given special consid
eration by the police officials with a view
toward Immediate precautionary steps.
Coming on top of the slashing of a large
underground cable at Twelfth and Clay
streets Tuesday night, the episode has
strong bearing on the linemen's strike in
Oakland. The telephone officials feel' that
the cable cutting was done by somebody
familiar with the location of the wires as
well as with the necessary work to make
a good job of the separation.
' By Tuesday night's .offense nearly 1400
telephones were disconnected from the
main station. Repairs to the'severad ca
ble were made by a force of expert elec
tricians from San Francisco.

Judge George Samuels resumed the hear,
ing to-day in the case of Charles E. Ar
nold and his wi.e, Eloise Arnold, who are
charged by Mrs. Mary E. Robinson, pro
prietress of a lodging-house at Broadway
and Twelfth streets, with the theft of dia
monds valued at $1000. What with the flit
ting about in the case of numerous pri
vate detectives, men and women, much
eavesdropping and the story of the recov
ery of Mrs. Robinson's missing gold watch
and chain from a stovepipe hole in the
room formerly occupied by the Arnolds,
there was much basis for the severe
cross-examination by Attorney M. C.
Chapman, the Arnolds' counsel, of the
complaining landlady.
The testimony about the finding of the
Jewelry was admitted provisionally by
Judge Samuels, and he makes it incum
bent upon the prosecution to connect the
taking of the watch and chain with the
Arnolds. "i ,
The watch, according to Mrs. Robinson,
was found by a woman detective, one of
a number employed from a private agency
to uncover the mystery of the missing
diamonds.
Attorney Chapman has advanced a the
ory that the watch was put In the hiding
place by a person interested In making a
showing to Mrs. Robinson. The lawyer
said in court this afternoon that he would
prove that at the time Mrs. Robinson
claims to have lost her gems Mrs. Arnold
was in San Francisco, while her husband
was at his place of business.
The examination will be resumed to
morrow.

Another man whose name could not be
ascertained, he having hurried from the
saloon as soon as the robbers departed,
was relieved of 10 cents, and Â¦ the thugs,
taking a bottle of whisky, backed out of
the saloon, covering their frightened vic
tims with their revolvers. -Reaching the
street they hurried away and were soon
lost in the darkness.
The door had hardly closed behind the
desperate robbers when Sere rushed Into
Seventh street and lustily blew his police
whistle. Policeman Harrison responded
in a minuie, but the perpetrators of the
bold crime had made good their escape.
From the description given of the rob
bers it Is certain that they are the same
men that stripped the proprietor and six
customers of the saloon at the corner of
Leavenworth and Turk streets of their
valuables Tuesday night.
Detectives are working vigorously on
the case, but are unable to get even a
clew upon which to base hopes of a pos
sible capture. It is apparent that the
thugs are versed in their calling and leave
no trails behind.
The two daring robbers who successful
ly held up the saloon at Turk and Leav
enworth streets Tuesflay night madÂ© an
other successful raid this morning short
ly after 1 o'clock on the 'grocery and bar
of John Sere at 170 Seventh street. The
burglars presented revolvers as they
noiselessly entered the place and after
securing $167. a gold watch and a bottle
of whisky left as suddenly as they en
tered. . ', â¢ .
Both men wore red handkerchiefs over
their faces as masks. They entered the
saloon while the proprietor and three
customers were, playing a game of pool..
Both men held "revolvers. One remained
near the door of the place and kept their
victims covered while the other went â¢be
hind the bar and opened the cash register.
After emptying the register, the burglar
commanded Sere to throw up his hands.
He did so and was relieved 'of what mon
ey he had on his person, which, together
with what was in the register, amounted
to $65.
Then the burglar turned his attention
to G. La Cruse, one of the men in the
place at the time. La Cruse was relieved
of $31 and a valuable gold watch and
chain. J. Hurard, another customer, waa
forced to give up $71 and some jewelry.

at the Matthew residence. 2000 Lincoln
street, and the body Trill be cent to-mor
row to Hollister for burial.
"He complained of a strange clutching
feeling in his brain." she said. ' "When
we were coming from the train last night
I noticed that his face was flushed. I
said to him, 'You don't look very happy
for a man about to be married,' and he
replied, 'I'm very tired.' Then ne drew
his pistol from his pocket and said, 'Well,
good-by, Margy.* and shot himself. I
didn't believe he meant to kill himself.
Even when I saw the flash and saw him
fall I didn't believe It.
"While we were coming across the bay
he said a strange thing: 'I know when I
get over there your father won't let ma
marry you.' He thought his life had been
a failure and feared to face my people,
though I told him his fear was only im
aginary. One day on the boat he said,
â¢If I jump over will you save me?' I said.
â¢Yes, of course.' and then he seemed, to
forget all about it. I know he was very
much discouraged lately and he would
often walk the floor for hours and cry."
Melville R. Matthew. Miss Matthew'a
brother, corroborated his sister's state
ments regarding McCloud's mental con
dition. Chester Marliave of 2037 Lincoln
street testified that he saw McCloud draw
his pistol and shoot himself and ran to his
assistance.
The inquest into the death of Wayne
McCloud; the young newspaper man who
killed himself with a pistol last night
while in the company of Miss Margaret
L. Matthew, his fiancee, was held this
afternoon at 5 o'clock. The verdict of the
jury was that the unfortunate young man
had come to his death by hi* own hand
while temporarily deranged.
Miss Matthew's testimony was given
through the medium of a deposition pri
vately taken by Coroner Mehrmann, aj
she- was still too shocked to submit to an
examination in public. She said she no
ticed McCloud acting peculiarly several
months ago. While he was nearly al
ways cheerful he sometimes became de
spondent. She thought he was deranged,
but believed he would recover if he had a
long rest and she advised his giving up his
v>rork on the San Francisco Examiner.

There on March 10, and among the cloth
ing was an undervest. in a small pouch of
which were two rings, one with a diamond
end the other a pearl setting. After she
missed the gems the owner went to the
laundry and tried to recover them but
failed. A month later Soon, the prosecu
tion claimed, tried to sell the diamond
ring to B. Ljfsner. a Washington-street
jeweler, for $200, saying: It had belonged
to his wife. Later tire Chinese approached
Detectives Kyte and Quigley. who were in
citizens' dress, and was arrested. At that
time, according to the testimony. Soon
said he had found the ring in the dirt in
front of the laundry. During the trial his
story was that he had recovered the cir
clet from the rear of the washhouse.
Concerning thtir verdict J. L. McCarthy
said: "The testimony from the Chinese,
through an interpreter, was that he did
not intend to sell the rings, but was try
ing to ascertain their value, so as to get
a reward. The testimony of the detectives
as to the ability of the man to talk Eng
1'is-h was contradictory. There was in the
minds cf the Jury a reasonable doubt as
to the intention of the Chinese to steal the
rings. Of course, there was no doubt that
he had. the rings, but the proof was not
adequate that he intended to sell them.
Mr. Walsh's remarks were not warranted.
I suppose he was hot, but I guess he wi}l
get over it."
"Before this Jury is discharged I desire
*.o eay that 1 consider this verdict infa
mous. It Is Just such verdicts as this
that cause the reign of anarchy and
lynching throughout this country."

Yesterday afternoon General Passenger

bility of maknig improvements.
Amor.g other matters settled rt was de
cided that a separate room shall be
ass-igned for agents of Eastern roads
â¢where they can purchase tickets. At the
jircpent time they have to wait at the
counter the same as other purchasers for
their turn in buying tickets. In this way
sometimes there would be two or three
clerks from the fame office waiting to
buy tickets. Under the new rule this will
all be done away with.

The complaints allege that the chute
was too shallow for the purposes In
tended; that there were holes and water
in it and that the company negligently
failed to provide the usual safeguards.
To have seven ribs on one side broken
and torn loose, to have in addition the
bones of the right shoulder and arm and
the collar bone broken and cracked and
to be yet alive and well, though -crippled
and disabled permanently, is the luck of
Colin Newton, an 18-year-old boy, who
was employed In a logging camp near
Scotia. Humboldt County. The accident
occurred on April 23, 1903, and was caused
by a large log Jumping out of a chute
and flying against a tree sixteen Inches In
diameter. The tree burst Into pieces' like
an explosive shell and several of the
fragments struck young Newton^ who
was standing fifteen or twenty feet
away from the chute. Other, fragments
struck Robert Miller, a 20-year-old youth,
who was standing near Newton, and dis
abled him.
Newton and Miller entered suits in the
Superior Court of Humboldt County
against the Pacific Lumber Company to
recover 115,250 damages for Newton and
$12,250, damages for Miller. The suits
were transferred yesterday to the United
States Circuit Court in tnis city, Newton
and, Miller- being natives of Nova Scotia.
For the pyrpose of the litigation William
Newton was appointed guardian of tho
two complainants.
As a result of an autopsy, performed
yesterday afternoon by Autopsy Surgeon
Bacigalupi on the boJy of Martin L.
Bowers, the bridge builder, heretofore al
leged by relatives to have been poisoned,
the theory of murder has been dispelled.
An examination of the vital organs dis
closed the fact that tuberculosis had tak
en a firm hold on the left lung, and there
Â¦was fatty degeneration of the kidneys.
The contents of the stomach were sent
to the City Chemist for analysis, .al
though there appears to be no doubt that
death w us due to natural causes.
Mrs. Marta Bowers, vridow of the de
based, when seen at her home. 370 Clem
entina street, yesterday afternoon, was
prostrated over the death cf her husband
and the unenviable notoriety occasioned
by the allegations made by his brother
and his sister-in-lawâ which directed sus
picion to her as being the murderess of
Bowes s. Mrs. Bowers characterized the
alienations ns malicious falsehoods, and
s-aid that hor relatives have no doubt be
come cognizant of the fact that Bowers
and h?rj*<?lf had some money in the
lank, which was accumulated during
their mr-rricd life, and that they want
pome of it. She mairta'.ns that her re-
Jaticns with the dead man were harmoni
ous end that their wedded life was
happy.
Harry Bowers and hJs wife called at the
Coroner's office yesterday and asked that
the officials take action to step thj pay
ment of the money in the Hibernia Bank
to the widov.-. They were informed that
the Coroner had no jurisdiction in the
matter. Their eaeer haste to put in a
cl<a:n for the worldly possessions cf their
dead relative, coupled with their unseem
ly haste in charging the widow with mur
der, seems to indicate greater worry over
money than over death.
Detective Tcm Oolcman was detailed on
the case and is making investigation, al
though convinced by the autopsysarid the
circumstances surrounding the case that
there is no need of a police investigation.

NEW YOIIK STOCK LIST,
Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2Q.â Nothing worthy of
comment was accomplished by to-day's meager
bidding in stock*, either In the way of dis
tribution of securities or price changes. Â¦ The
.volume of dealings fell another notch toward
absolute Ftagnation with a total for the day
of only aliout 200. (KX) thareo. and the cases in
which lh* price variations I reached a point
were very few. lt was observed that the tele
phone calls on the exchange and the annun
ciator calls to members by number were extra
ordinarily few. which is regarded as evidence
that very little business originated outside the
exchange. Even the professional operators of
larger caliber are going away for delayed
vacations which have been prevented hereto
fort by the troubled state of thÂ« market and
the smaller class of room traders have tlu
n-arket to themselves. It Is the complaint
among these that when they offer prices
down they are unable to force any renewal
or liquidation, and that they soon meet sup
porting orders, while If they attempt a turn
en the long side of Uw n:arket they are un
able to find a eatisfactory market to realize on
at any aJvar.ce in prices. The undertone of
to-day's market was heavy, but the only ap
parent reason for this was that yesterday Â«
movement was upward, thus taxing the limits
of the small traders In the decline. Attention
or the financial districts is centered on the
m^nry murket rather than up stocks
To-day's <ilflclal admission that the effort*
of the- Cons ilidaied Lakes Superior Compan>
to *e<-ure subscriptions to its bond issue had
railed was uÂ«icth<"- Â«xample of the extreme
dlfOcutty m i-reÂ«ont of inducing capital to
a^ume any fixed form. There lÂ» continued
unwillingness to lend money on time and rates

over 1G0.00O tor.s. With this amount, and the
liberal shipments now being forwarded from
British Columbia, and Washington, there is no
probability of a shortage in our fuel require
ments'for some time. The 27 vessels arriving
here from Australia within the last six weeks
have reduced the Colonial list for this port
very materially, as new names are not being
added to replace the names being taken off.
Furthermore this port is not a desirable one to
seek for outward business with 54 disengaged
ve5sels seeking charters. Then again Foreign
Coals will be dropped from the free list and
become again dutiable on January IB, 19O4.
lt is generally believed that the administration
will not modify the present situation, yet im

or 1000 less than for the week preceding. The
cry for cars is not heard as much, 'so it lÂ«
quite evident that many districts are being
somewhat cleaned up. From Holllster and Llv
ermore comes the report that almost everything
is under cover and Contra Costa County re
ports practically all the available storage room
filled, also that the amount to yet be marketed
from the fields is comparatively small. Stock
ton reports that there is yet a good bit of hay
to be marketed, but thin district seems to
stand alone in thU respect. It would seem
from this that the present range of prices can
not continue but for a short time and that as
soon as the fields* are entirely cleaned there
should be a sharp advance in prices. â¢ . â¢
"Export trade has been a bit quiet during tne
past week pr two but the country demand con
tinues quite active in ail sections. It is from
this latter trade that we may expect consider
able business throughout the entire year.
"Choice Wheat Hay is still in good demand
here and in not very great supply. Some occa
sional cars are being sold at an advance over
the regular quotations."

CHICAGO. Aug. 28. â The weather here and
abroad exerted much influence on the wheat
market, and this, together with strong outside
markets, created an urgent demand. There
was an absefrce of heavy selling orders, and
while profit taking on the moderate advances
prevented any soaring, the bullish feeling- in
creased throughout the session, finally prices
being about best. September opening at KOVi
to 80%c, % to %c better, than yesterday's
close, advanced with but a temporary break
to 80%c. until It touched 60%c, Just before
the cloae,' which was a shade easier at 80%@
80%c. a gain of %Â©%c. December closed- a
quarter cent higher at 82%c Both the North
west and Southwest were buyers In this mar
ket. Cash markets were all strong.
. Predictions of cold weather in the corn belt
following yesterday's heavy rains. caused free
covering and resulted in Â» firmer tone in the

Al Elklns had little difficulty in beating
"Walter Walker. to a standstill In the' first
round. Jim Malcolm ! proved a . better
slugger than Charles Kelly and was given
the decision. Tom Sullivan knocked Joe
Fountain out in two rounds.
Paul Martin, the amateur featherweight
champion boxer t>f the coast, successfully
defended 'his title against Lew Powell last
night before the Bay City Athletic Club.
The fight was probably the best of Ha
kind ever seen In the amateur arena and
the immense crowd was in suspense dur
ing every- moment of. the herce struggle.
Powell started to rush his man in the
Initial round and for a time he looked a
winner. Martin's cleverness, however,
stood by him and he ducked many a vi
cious swing that would have put him down
and out. In the second Martin began to
force the fighting and he maintained the
lead from that time on. Powell was as
game as a pebble and fought every min
ute of the time. Martin had the better of
the last two rounds by a wide margin and
was given the decision amid the cheers of
the spectators.
The rest of the programme was in keep
ing with the main event, every fight being
a warm one and full of incidents. Dick
Highland won from Jim Linegar in two
rounds of the hottest kind of fighting. Joe
Thomas finished George Platt, the navy
champion in four rounds, both men fight

Duffy Bros., plumbers, filed a formal j
complaint with the Board of Public
Works yesterday that the charges for the
construction of a side sewer in Fourth
Â¦ street, between Folsom and Clementina,
were exorbitant. On that account the
firm petitioned . that the board invite
bids for the construction of another side
sewer running from the St. Francis Hotel
along Geary street to Powell, represent
ing that the work could be done by pri
vate contract at a less figure than that
charged by the Board of Works for .simi
lar work.
When Duffy Bros, some time ago asked
that the sewer In Fourth street be con
structed they deposited the sum of $250
to cover the estimated cost of the work.
After the work was completed a bill was
rendered the firm showing. that the work
cost J30S S2, leaving a balance due the
city of $53 82. The bill as itemized fol
lows:

Less deposit. February 10. 1002 230 CO
Balance due city and county $59 $2
Duffy Bros, demurred to the additional
charge on the ground that they had re
ceived * a bid, from the City Street Im
provement-Company, which agreed to do
the work for $1 15 a running foot, which
for 182 feet would amount to only $209 30.
Duffy Bros, claim that the cost of the
work should have been only $1S2 and have
put In a counter claim for $68, .the balance
of the deposit of $250, which they allege
is due them. :
The Board of Works decided, however,
to advertise for bids for the new side
sewer for the St. Francis Hotel. It Is the
intention of Duffy Bros, to put in a nomi
nal bid and do the work themselves, with
a view to expending less money than the
board would. V â¢*
The case of J. J. Connolly, a plasterer,
who was suspended by President Casey on
the report of Head Janitor Syron that
Connolly was not at his post of duty
when he should have been, was partially
considered. Connolly was present with
several witnesses to prove his side of the
case. iSyron made a statement in which
he referred to some trouble which he
and Connolly had had In Commissioner
Schmitz's office. said he had been
ordered to take the time of the mechanics
in the board's employ. . Schmitz insisted
that Syron should have reported to him
and Syron stated that he tried to do so,
but Schmitz was absent from his office.
Connolly frequently rose to interrupt
Syron, but was finally pacified by being
told he could go back to work at once.
Tho matter will come up again this morn
ing for final action on the suspension.

cost estimate of the ' work the proceed

bids will havÂ« to be invited.

ALL WERE OVEBCOME.
On the floor between one of the beds
and the walls lay the dead body of the
twelve-year-old boy, Casslmero Chavez.
He was dressed with the exception of his
TWO lives went out yesterday as
the result of carbon monoxide poi
soning and that of a third was
nearly sacrificed to the insidious
fumes of a partly cpened gas jet.
The victims cf the 4 tragedy were Solo
mon Chavez, Casslmira Chavez, his wife,
and her half brother, Cassimero Chavez.
The three were discovered in a room in
the International Hotel on Kearney street
at 9:3) o'clock yesterday morning by Mrs.
Mitchell, the housekeeper at the hotel.
The ' boy was dead, the husband fatally
poisoned and the wife partly overcome by
the noxious fumes' that poured from a
slightly optned gas jet In the room.
In making the rounds to ascertain what
rooms had been occupied and needed at
tention Mrs. Mitchell tried the doer of
room -22.- which was -occupied by the
Chavezes. She discovered that the body
of one of the â¢ occupants . impeded the
opening of the door. She notified Mana
ger F. J. Walker, who forced aside . the
prone body of Mrs. Chavez and gained
entrance to. the room.
From the Investigation 1 madeby Detec
tive Freel and Deputy Coroner Meehah
tfte officials have concluded that the
deaths were due to accidental asphyxia
tion by gas and that the hotel manage
ment was not to blame in the matter.
A remarkable feature of the case Is tho
small volume of gas thaf is supposed to
have caused death.. "According to the em
ployes of the hotel, several people entered
the room after the discovery of the trag
edy without-noticing the odor of escaping
gas and the key was only slightly turned
on. Mrs. Chavez withstood the asphyxia
tion without any particularly serious re
sults and her life was- not- endangered,
while her husband Â¦ and brother suc
cumbed. Â«
SMALL VOLTJME OF GAS.
Mrs. Chavez is unable to speak English
She told what she knew of the -tragedy
through an Interpreter. She said that
Sunday and Monday night she had turned
out tne gas. but that on Tuesday night
she retired before her^husband and was
asleep before the light was put out She
does not remember anything further re
garding the occurrences of the night until
she found herself in the Emergency Hos
pital. She is utterly, destitute and unable
to speak. English.- The doctors fear the

CLAIM CHARGE
IS EXORBITANT
A, good many interesting points are
likely to arise, and perhaps a new field
at industry may be developed in Napa
County. Veterans other than Mc-
Donnell possess a little money and
the courts may find that they
need some one to care for tljeir
persons and estates. Next Saturday the
president and treasurer of the board of
directors will appear in Judge GesforiTs
court in Napa City.
A strong effort will be made to show
that in justice and equity the old and
bonded institution that cares for the sol
dier's life and provides him the com
forts of his declining years should be
awarded control of his money without
questioning the ability or integrity of the
gruardian named by the court. It Trill be
contended that ;he home was slighted and
the purposes of its creation were over
looked.
The act of Congress relating to pensions
of deceased veterans is clear. The get
approved July 1, 1SO2, provides:
balance of pension money remaining in
the hands of the treasurer cf the home at the
Â«late of the pensioner'* death .-ha)! be paid
to Ais widow, minor children or dependent
mother or father In the order named, and
bhould no widow, minor child or dependent
parent be discovered within one year from the
time of the death of the pensioner, said bal
ance 6hall be rÂ«aid to the post fund to be used
for the common benefit of the members of the
home, aubject to future reclamation by rela
tives v.;:ixs. five years.
A few weeks ago Thomas McDonnell,
who dwells at the Veterans' Home, Napa
County, California, was taken to the hos-Â»
pltal of that Institution. He had in his
possession $3S0. The medical director, not
wishing to place that amount in the of
fice safe, forwarded it to the treasurer
in San Francisco, where it was placed in
bank to the credit of the aforesaid Mc-
Donnell. The books of the treasurer
that an additional sum approximating $500
Ftands to the credit of McDonnell. When
l?.e Information reached Yountville that
McDonnell had that much money steps
were taken to get the Napa County Su
perior Court to declare Â¦ him incompetent
and appoint a guardian to take charge
of his estate. There was a hearing in
court and the Judge appointed a man
named Roberts to take care of the vet
eran's money. With magnanimity. that is
eurprising. the court allowed the home,
which is maintained by the Federal and
State governments, to have charge of the
person of McDonnell. The records show
that McDonnell went to. the. home fifteen
years ago. He has saved something -of
his pension every month. There is now
in *>ank to his credit $1077. Other proceed,
ings of a. similar character having been
instituted in Napa County, the directors
of the home deemed it wise to retain the
legal services Â»f Frank L. Coombs to rep
resent the board of management. The ques
tion at Issue will go to the Supreme Court
of this State, or perhaps to a higher trib
unal. 0

Regarding Health Officer, O'Brien's in
crease from $250. to $275 per month; Assist
ant Secretary Cameron said that O'Brien
had private office hours, but was always
at the call of the Health Board. O'Brien
.was' always at the health office from 10:30
a. m. to 12:45 p. m:, and from 4:30 to 6 p.
m., and was continually engaged in in
spection work, Cameron said. Cameron's
own. salary had been raised from $100 to
$150 in the last three years. f
Brandenstein thought the work of Cigar
Inspector Kelly at $100 per month should
be done by a regular sanitary inspector
and the position given to a civil service
eligible.
The hearing was then postponed until
next Wednesday at 2 p. m., anÂ£ a resolu
tion providing for the reference to the
joint Finance, Health and Street Commit
tee for investigation will be introduced at
next Monday's meeting of the board.
The committee authorized the payment
of $363 for pensions for exempt firemen,
and referred to the City 'Attorney the de
mands for maintenance of children at the
Feeble-Minded Home for- an opinion - as
to whether the city ia liable for the bills.
Secretary McCarthy . of â¢ the . Fire Com
mission appeared before the committee to
urge the payment , of j certain demands
which Auditor Baehr refused to sign be
cause it would overdraw the Fire Depart
ment fund*in the sum of $1069 45. The com
mittee, held that it could' take -no further
action, as the: board had authorized pay
ment of the demands. /Â¦
"I am opposed to raising the salaries of
men who have permanent positions from
$150 to $175," said Brandenstein, "as per
manency is an important factor in the
case. We will now take up the raises of
salaries by the Health Board, which ag
gregate $2700 per, annum outside of' the
recommendations "of the Board of Super
visors."
Assistant Engineers Connick and Her
mann were raised from $150 to $175 on the
ground of efficiency, and six. out of fif
teen assistant surveyors had been raised
from $S0 to $100 on the recommendation of
City Engineer Grunsky, Casey said.
OPPOSES INCBEASES.
Additional work was the cause assigned
for raising the salaries of Sewer Super
intendent Brandon and Superintendent of
Street Repairs Gallagher to $175 per month,
and Assistant Engineer â¢Morse's salary
had been raised to $275 owing to his com
petency.
Brandenstein desired: to know '-j if the
committee wanted to go ahead with the
inquiry, and Loughery's motion. to that
effect was carried. â¢ Â¦.Â¦"
"I think we are wasting our time in this
Investigation." said Wilson, "and I want
to understand its purport. The Board of
"Works has disregarded the recommenda
tions of the Board of Supervisors, and
that ends , the matter so far as we are
concerned."
"I want this investigation to go on,'"
said Loughery, "because^! felt sore at the
Board of Works increasing salaries not
recommended by the Supervisors." .
"There is a moral if not a legal obliga
tion to inquire into the matter," said
Brandenstein. "If we can do nothing else
we can bring in a resolution denouncing
the action of the Board of. Works. Â¦ The
press has criticized the board for the in
creases in salaries, and it is our duty to
investigate them."
"The charges were made by an un
friendly press," said Casey. "We were
blamed for the very Increases ordered by
the Supervisors. Let the matter of all
raises of salaries be taken up, including
those requested by-'y various organiza
tions."' * . '.#">- v
At this point Supervisor Wilson char
acterized the investigation as puerile,
since the Finance Committee had no con
cern with the actions of the "Board of
Works ' after the budget had been once
fixed. Â¦Â¦-Â¦--Â¦
Casey said Head Janitor Syron's salary
had been raised to $125 per month owing
to Increased duties, and that former Head
Janitor Sawyer received $100 per month,
and Assistant Head Janitor O'Brien had
been raised to $100 per month by the
Board of Supervisor's.
,, Superintendent of Street Sweeping Cow
den, whose salary had been raised to $175
per month, was a clerk at $100 per month
in 1900, and Brandenstein thought $130
would be ample compensation Â¦ for the
work done by him.
. WILSON OBJECTS.
Casey said that John B. Gartland. who
had been increased from $125 to 5150, was
the legal adviser of the board and had
been in the board's employ for- nearly four
years. ,/.
"We have received assurances from
President Casey of the Health and Works
boards." said Brandenstein. "that the rec
ommendations of the Finance Committee
will receive proper attention."
| Regarding the raise of salary of Leon
ard Leavy, chief bookkeeper, Casey said
that the new system introduced had
necessitated an increased amount of work
and made it impossible for any defalca
tion the office to occur, as in the case
of W. J. H. White, who absconded with
$sooo.- * ;_.: . â¢
At the outset of the inquiry Chairman
Brandenstein explained that the commit
tee has no power in the matter except- to
recommend that in cases where the in
creases^ are -regarded as unwarrantable
the salaries be reduced to their original
figures.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee re
sumed its inquiry yesterday into the many,
increases in the salaries of employes by
the Health Board and Board of Public
Works. Â¦
