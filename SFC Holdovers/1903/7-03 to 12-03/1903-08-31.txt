'jt'O CHURCH DESPITE STORM
Mrs. Fair's relatives are. now. engaged
In taking testimony In New York for the
purpose of proving, if possible, that Mrs.
Fair survived her husband in the accident
that ended both of their lives. Mrs. Nel
son, mother of Mrs. Fair, originally ac
cepted" $250,000 as a settlement of her
claims against the estate, but later repu
diated this settlement and Instituted pro
ceedings in New York State, which has
delayed the closlnsr of the probate pro
ceedings here.: ".. '
The first suggestion of a. putative heir
to the estate of the late Charles L. Fair
came through the agency of Attorney W.
L. Cannon on October 10, 1902. On that
date Cannon called at the Fair heirs' of
fice, and, gaining an audience with Man
ager Charles Neal, Informed him that an
heir existed and that his client, a' woman,
was prepared to produce, the child and
documentary evidence of it3 right, to
share In the estate left by Charles L. Fair.
Cannon refused to go Into details re
garding the child. He later saw Herman
Oelrlchs on the same subject and to him
he was. also very reticent. .When seen
later by a representative of the newspa
pers Cannon declined to be interviewed
and from that day until this purported
will was received by Judge â¢ Murasky the
question as to whether, Fair was sur
vived by a child has not been revived.
Attorneys Knight and. Heggerty from the
start ridiculed the suggestion of a- possi
bility of an infant heir to the estate of
Fair and defied Cannon to bring his cli
ent and his evidence Into the courts.

here.
the alleged will received by Judge Mu
rasky may yet prove that the ridiculed
alleged heir Is prepared to lay claim to
a portion of the Fair millions, and this
suggestion has awakened Intense Inter
est in * the case. ,
In speaking of the alleged will Judga
Mnrasky said:
"When I first opened the package It
presented such an unusual appearance
that I thought It* was a Joke. When I
read the will I was naturally surprised,
as I never had heard of any Charles L.
Fair Jr. excepting Attorney Cannon's
reference to an heir some time ago. Then,
again* it Is more than a year since Fair
died, and I have been wondering where
the document could have been all the
time.
"I am not familiar with either the sig
natures of Fair, General Barnes or Cap
tain Lees.
"The document Is now in the hands of
Mr. Casey, and, of course, nothing fur
ther will be done with It unless some one
asks to have it passed to probate.
"It may make a great difference in the
settlement of this vast estate, which has
long .been in the throes of litigation, but,
of course. If the will Is ever offered for
probate the case will rest on the genuine
ness of the three signatures to the docu
ment."

This renders his position here somewhat
peculiar from a diplomatic standpoint, es
pecially as the Porte has never seen fit

In regard to the error in the assassina
tion report.
Sidky Bey, the second secretary of the
Turkish legation and who is also acting
Consul In New York City, has received a
message from his foreign office denying
the report that Mr. Magelsson was' mur
dered. It is very unusual for a Govern
ment to send such communications to a
Minister's subordinate when the Minister
is In the country, and this lends some
color to the gossip prevalent for some
time In Washington that Chekib Bey had
been, temporarily at least, "forgotten" by
his Government.
Chekib Bey, the Turkish Minister, who
yesterday declared he was coming at once
to Washington, did not call upon the
Secretary to-day, nor has Hay any knowl
edge of when he Is coming. Chekib Bey
has never presented his credentials to the
State Department or been received by
President Roosevelt.

Captain Frost of the Mason saifl later
that just before the Navigator arrived
they had concluded that the women
die In a few hours and they had
decided to. try for the beach. He . said
that Saturday, when they were out near
,the lightship at anchor, the Old Domin
ion Line steamer Hamilton offered to take
them off and he urged the women to .go,
but they declined to leitve without the
men.' During the night he believes the
Mason struck something.
Thousands along the shore watched the
clever work of the life savers. Twice the
lifeboat was filled level with water, but
as she is a self bailer she cleared her
self. The going down in tow of the Navi
gator was In itself a perilous thing In
such a sea. When the men returned Mr.
Iselin said a special word of praise to
them and In return was heartily cheered.
When Captain Patterson asked for the
assistance of the Navigator, Captain
Barr of the Reliance, who stood by, said:
"I have fifty men; every one of them
will volunteer to help if you want them."
"WOMEN. WOULD NOT LEAVE.
It was 11 o?clock this morning when the
Navigator. Â¦ located the twelve persons In
their perilous position and it was fully an
hour before they could be rescued. This
was accomplished In "hs daring a manner
as has ! ever tfeen o tol<I in* any sea tale.
The big-tug made several attempts to get
near, the yawl and then going to. wind
ward past Â¦ off the.' lifeline. With splen
did dexterity a line was sent from the
lifeboat to a pole-. -on -the fish pound and
â¢ paid out until the yawl was.reach^J.
The shipwrecked crew and passengers
were in such*, condition that they could
not help themselves and Captain Patter
son of the life saving "crew and his men
had to lift them out. 'First came the two
â¢women and then tHree sailors. Meantime,
under the_ dlreotion of Mr. Iselin, the
Navigator's crew had thrown a dozen
pails of oil overboard to the wlndsrard of
the yawl, so that the sea was calmed
and tho big tug had taken a position eo
that the wind did not catch her on the
beam. The women when brought 'aboard
were carefully attended to, Mr. Iselin
having taken along a woman attendant.
Repeated efforts wpre made by the life
fcaving crews to launch a beat, tfut the
heavy sea running made it impossible.
Meanwhile, word had bÂ£en sent to Sandy
Hook for assistance and Mr. Iselln volun
teered the services of the-' Navigator to
tow the life savers to where the small
boat was in. danger of being swamped.

at -11 ; o'clock Saturday night, theothree
maBted schooner Henry P. Maaoh, from
Perth ; Afaboy.N. J., 'o r Portland, Me.,
loaded with red clay, struck, it Is believ
ed; a 'submerged â¢ wreck and sank at 2
"o'clock this morning. The crew and .two
passengers took to the veBeel'e small boat
and were buffeted by the high seas all
night and part of to-day, until rescued
by the Sandy Hook life saving crew.' The
life savers were towed to the boat^bne
mile oft Galilee by the New York Yacht
Club. committee. boat Navigator on which
was C. Oliver Iselln. managing owner of
the yacht ' Reliance, and Bert C. Leeds.
The survivors reached Sandy Hook at 3
o'clock this afternoon apparently in good
co'ndltlon. , It is believed the schooner will
be a total loss. \
The rescued Include Captain ;A. "W.

Johnson, Baltimore; Steward Preston
Grover and wife, of Tennant's Harbor,
Me.; Mr. and Mrg, N. e G. Masilous, New

Captain Frost.
When the Mason struck, the mainmast
and mizzenmast were broken off short
and the vessel started to leak .badly. At
1 o'clock an anchor was dropped ..over
board, but it was soon discovered that the
vessel would not keep afloat and the
crew and passengers took to the small
boat. For a time they held to thfi stern
of the schooner, but as there was danger
of her going to the bottom at any" mo
ment they cast off and drifted. About a
mileoOff Galilee they made fast to a fish
pound, where they remained until res
cued.

FREE MEDICAL, ADVICE TO WOMEN.
!;:;: * This is a very important consideration in a woman's correspondence with Mrs- Pinftham. It 13 a
rreafc satisfaction to feel that one^womarf can write to another telling her the most private and confidential
details about her illne'ss, and know that her letter will be seen by a woman only, â a woman full of sympathy
for her sick sisters, and with a knowledge of woman's ills greater than that possessed by any other person.
,IVIrs. Pinkham never violates the confidence thus entrusted to her, and although she publishes
thousands of testimonials from women who have been benefited by her advice and medicine, never
. in all 'her experience has she published such a letter without the full consent, and often by
special request of the writer. Vu '
â¢Â¦ . v Â¦ Th 6 reason Mr!?. Pinkham is so amply qualified to give advice in cases of female ills is for the reason
that over one hundred thousand cases cdme before her each year, â some personally, others by mail, and
this .has been going on for twenty years, day after day, and day after day. Twenty years of constant success,
â¢ âthink of the knowledge thus, gained. Surely, women are wise in seeking advice from a woman of such
experience, especially when it is absolutely free. ; r
.As an illustration of the good comincr from such advice we herewith publish two letters and
portrait of Miss Hattie DeGroat, the reading: of which should give every sick -woman confidence in
Mrs. Pinkham'fs ability to help them. This is only one of thousand* of the same kind of letters

BUSINESS SESSION.
His Grace brought to the delegates a
message from Archbishop Rlordari regre*
ting his inability on account of ill health
to greet them in person, and assured them
that their aims and endeavors had his
highest approval.
NECESSITY FOR UNION.
Archbishop Montgomery on his own be.
half congratulated the- delegates on the
strides the verband had made during the
last year and the encouraging outlook it
has for the future. He said that the
spirit of the age demanded union in order
to obtain strength, and- the Catholic
church, itself the greatest organization of
the world, recognized this necessity. The
German Catholics of the State, he said,
had always manifested deep interest in
the affairs of the church and had wielded
a' proportionately large influence. The
verband tended, he said, to solidify this
Interest, and the authorities of the church
wished to encourage it in every way.
Concerning the much mooted question
of the teaching of the German language
irv schools, he said that matter would set
tle itself. It was only natural that Ger
man parent3 would wish their offspring
to learn their native language, which
necessarily forms the equipment of every
thoroughly educated person. It is a lan
guage, he said, rich in every form of lit
erature, wherein poets, dramatists, ro
mancers, philosophers and scientists, the
greatest in the world, have spoken, and

Cor. Powell and Eddy.' -IST. PETERSBURG has had upon the subject of
expositions a thought so happy it ought to
have been American. She purposes to open in
one of the imperial palaces of that city an exposition
to be known as "The World." It is to be
under the patronage of her Majesty the Dowager
Empress Mary Fedorovna, and it is announced that
it will be so comprehensive in its scope as to be of
world-wide interest and usefulness.
Consul General Lodygensky has asked the Ameri
can Institute of Social Service in New York to or
ganize an American committee to prepare an Ameri
can exhibition, and the institute has consented. A
summary of the plan on which the exposition has
been arranged says there will be a complete picture of
child life from birth to school days, including nour
ishment, dress, instruction, amusement and physical
and moral education. The exhibits are to be divided
into five sections. Section I, on scientific teaching,
will include exhibits of manuals, books, maps, tools,
pictures and other materials used for teaching chil
dren in all parts of the world; section II will be de
voted to the physical development of children and
will include exhibits for the care of babes, their nour
ishment, hygiene before' school age and also school
houses and school playgrounds; section III will be
devoted to industrial exhibits, including the equip
ment of nurseries, clothing, toys and children's games;
section IV will include all exhibits of child life in
the arts, while section V is to be the historic-ethno
graphical section, where there will be illustrations of
historical events from the lives of child heroes, dis
coveries and inventions made by children", works and
compositions by young artists and composers, and
ethnological peculiarities in the lives of children of
different nations.
If the plans as projected be fully carried out, "The
Child's World" will doubtless prove itself one of the
EXPOSITION OF CHILD LIFE.
Hawaii has determined that as far as manner is
concerned she intends to adopt the voting system
now in legal vogue in California. While this decision
is an unquestioned compliment to us, simple justice
compels us to warn the island territory that she must
not follow too closely our ideals expressed in the
choice of men we sometimes elect to public office.

IT turns out that our Vice Consul at Beirut was
not shot, but only shot at, and escaped injury,
thanks to bad marksmanship and none to the
bad intentions of the assassin. The administration
does well to make a naval demonstration to in
form the Sultan that we do not send Consuls to his
empire to serve as tarjets for his subjects. It is
well r.lso that we operate independently of the
European powers, which are more specially con
cerned in the Mahometan problem.
The hysterical demand that we insist Chris
tendom joining us to force the Turk out of Europe
is made without knowledge of our system of gov
ernment or our international responsibility. The
Turk fought his way into Europe, just as many
Christian nations h-ve fought their way elsewhere,
and with as little regard for the consequences to
others. The operations of Christendom in China
do not leave a, sufficiently wide margin to make
room to spread pur phylactery in its entirety.
We have problems nearer home that need our
attention. The Mahometan faith was spread by
the swo-d. It was that kind of a faith. The de
man'" that Christianity adopt the same plan leaves
too little difference between the two for the com
fort of those who believe that the whole spirit of
Christianity 'â¢ins to" the overcoming of evil with
good, and suggests no other means for the spread
of^the faith of the Nazarene.

WHILE trade has been monotonous for a
nonth or more it was especially â¢ so last
week. Reports from all over the country
showed the same, plodding, humdrum conditions.
If there -was anything particularly noticeable it
was the loss in the volume of bank clearings, which
amounted to 19.8 per cent in comparison with the
corresponding week in 1002. The heaviest loss
was at New York (46.4 per cent), where stack
speculation has been tame since the last sharp drop
-everal weeks ago. It is this decrease in specula
tion which probably explains the loss in the clear
ings. Boston lost and so did BaltitTiore, but the
other large cities gained, though" the gain was very
slight in all cases. The aggregate oi clearings for
tlie whole country fell off to $1,645,529,000, by far
tl smallest aggregate for several' years.
For a long time the; average weekly clearings
have totaled about $2,100,000,000; hence this pro
nounced loss at once attracts attention, .and the
question immediately arises: What -causes this â
a falling off in general trade throughout the coun
try, or in stock speculation, or a decline in values
of merchandise and produce, or diminished, foreign
trade, or all combined? But whatever the. cause,
this is a drop so sudden "and sharp-, like the unex
pected fall of the thermometer or barometer, that
it will bear watching for a week or two. .Not for
years has such - thing happened to the bank clean
ings." V
A scrutiny of general trade shows nothing to
jiro'Juce such a violent decrease in the vohim; cf
business as shown by this shrinkage in "the clear
ings. There is nothing in the condition of the
cereal, provision, textile, metal or farm produce
markets, or even in the stock market, to account
for it. The staples as a rule are steady, but none
of them are particularly active; the provision mar
ket has been dragging and slowly declining, but
this has been going on for some time; the textile
industries arc not as active as they were last year
it is true, Lut most of the mills and factories are
working right along and report things in satisfac
tory condition; iron and steel have quieted down
considerably during t'..e past several months, but
there is no dullness reported; farm produce is
above the normal in price and moving off excel
lently, and cerea!s certainly cannot be called de
pressed. So the question is condensable to about
t-vo conditions: Either general tradt is of smaller
volume or the decline in stock valuations in Wall
street must be held accountable for the loss in
cl~Tingj. "' is probably the latter, as most of the
decrease is shown by New York as mentioned
above.
New York reports the number of buyers in town
from all over the country increasing, but this is
a feature common to this time of the year. The
railroads are still unable to supply cars enough to
transport all the freight offered them with dis
patch, though the shortage is not as acute as it
was last year. Some sections are reporting the
fall demand for merchandise more backward than
of late years. The failures for the week were 176,
-C^inst 173 for the tame week in 1902. Taken as
a whole the commercial situation is sound, with
no weak or disquieting conditions of any conse
quence apparent. The only cloud is the drop in
the clearings.
On this coast business seems to be more active
than across the mountains. We are all busy out
here. Our crops ars not as large as we expected
along in the spring, but with the exception of
wlieat, which will be more or less scarce again
this year, they are large enough. The demand for
f.e! I and orchard products is excellent and grow
ing, and a number of farm staples, such as hops,
dried fruits, hay, grains, etc., are advancing. Dairy
produce is above the normal quotations, and the
demand is so good that the market readily absorbs
all the receipts as a rule. The leading seaports of

of any other navy. Twenty-two years
ago Italy led all other navies in larger
battleships of greater speed and heavier
guns, and its vessels of teat class built
up to the present time, while slightly di
minished in size, have increased In speed
and general efficiency. In the Vittorio
Emanuele III, now building, Italy will
possess the best battleship afloat. Its
calculated speed of twenty-two knots will
exceed by three knots the fastest vessel
of its class yet built in any navy, and
its armor protection and battery will
enable the ship to engage any other ves
sel of considerably greater tonnage with
assurance of success. Three' ships of this
type are building, identical in all par
ticulars, the principal data of which are:
Displacement, 12,624 tons; horsepower. 20.
000; calculated speed, 22 knots; main bat
tery, two 12-inch and twelve 8-lnch guns;
armor belt, &?i inches to 4 inches; armor
ed deck, 4 inches; gun positions, armor 8
inches and 6 inches: normal coal. 1000
tons; estimated cost, $5,000,000. The five
American battleships of the Connecticut
class compare 'as follows with the Italian
ships: Displacement, 16,000 tons; horse
power, 16.500; calculated speed, 18 knots;
main battery, four 12-inch, eight
8-inch. 1 twelve 7-inch: armor belt,
11 inches to 4 inches: armored deck,
%-inch, gun positions, armor 12 Inches
and 7 Inches; normal coal, 900 tons;
estimated cost, $7,500,000. The battery of
the American ships exceeds that of the
Italian at the expense of speed and coai
supply. , It is not improbable, however,
that the experience of the Indiana elass
may be repeated in the Connecticut type
in allowing an undue preponderance of
ordinance, thereby sacrificing other es
sentials of an efficient battleship. .
Colonel V. U. Cuniberti, chief construc
tor of the Italian navy, has outlined a
design for a battleship which, if it should
prove what is claimed for it, would be
able to destroy all other ships that it
might choose. This ship is to be of 17,000
tons, 24 knots speed, main battery of
twelve 12-inch guns and a hull and
gun protection of 12-inch armor. No
details are given, even on paper, as
to how this ambitious design is to
be materialized. The displacement
would accommodate the battery and
armor, but the. speed appears to
be rather visionary. It would be possi
ble to get the requisite fine lines for high
speed on a length of 450 feet, breadth of
80 feet and 27 feet mean draught, but the
aggregate weights would far exceed the
intended displacement of 17,000 tons. The
ITALIAN naval constructors have
shown more originality in the develÂ«
opment of naval designs than those
financial condition. The organization was
made by calling a public meeting. Later
on concerts and other entertainments
still further popularized the Navy League.
It is planned to have kinematograph ex
hibitions during the coming winter at the
theater, as well as a series of lectures.
These public entertainments answer the
twofold purpose of amusement and In
struction and account for the popularity
of the German Navy League , and Its
branches in seaboard towns and Interior
districts.
A cruiser named Hamburg was launch
ed at the Vulcan yarn, Stettin. July 21
The vessel is one of three of the improved
Gazelle type and cla39 construction. The
ships are copper sheathed, being intended
for foreign station service. The data as
given in Ueberall, the official publication
of the Navy League, differ greatly from
those of Brassey and other naval authori
ties, which latter are probably incorrect.
According to Ueberall the Hamburg clas3
is of 3200 tons. 10,000 horsepower and
twenty-two knots speed, carrying an arm
ament of ten 4.1-inch, ten 1.4-Inch and
four machine gur.a. Another authority
gives the size of the vessels as 3000 tons.
LOOu norsepower and, a speed of twt-nty
two knots. The keel of the Hamburg
was laid in August. 1902, and the ship is
to be completed by â¢Fetruary. 1304.
Midshipman Duncan Douglass, in the
fourth class at the Naval Acaderay. has
been dismissed for falsely certifying: hla
ags to be 19, whereas he was 2T years oKl.
It was learned that h*> had graduated
from Yale in 1S97 and was admitted to the
bar in 1D01. Douglass was appointed from
the eighteenth New York district a few
weeks ago, and someone interested in
having another candidate appointed fur
nished the damaging disclosures to the
Navy Department. When confronted
with the charge Douglass admitted the
truth and was promptly dismissed. The
offense of understating the age haa been
made in several Instances and there were
within the last ten years two officers re
tired with the rank of rear admirals who
were from three to five years older than
they claimed when entering the service,
but Douglass was probably the oldest
youngster at the academy.
Trials of the battleship Maine will take
place during the early part of Septem
ber. The ship has been laid up at the
League Island Navy Yard since April IS
last undergoing extensive repairs to the
damaged hull and boilers. The intention
Is to make short speed trials in Chesa
peake Bay to test her boilers, after which
the ship will make a trip to San Juan,
Porto Rico, to test her endurance, and
finally the vessel is to go on a long
cruise In order to fully establish the
value of her tellers. Fotr vessels now
under construction are planned to be
fitted with Niclausse boilers and upon the
results of the Maine boilers depend their
adoption or rejection in the other ships.
Work on the new concrete drydock at
the Norfolk Navy Yard is to be begun
during September. It ia to be 600 feet in
length and is estimated to cost $1,100,000.
Another of the same dimensions and cost
Is to be built at the New York Navy
Yard. ;
consolidated weights under the several
items constituting the completed ship
would be approximately as follows: Hull,
Including protective deck, 8000 tons; ar
mor, 4000 tons; guns and ammunition.
1500 tons; equipments, stores, officers and
crew, 800 tons. These weights aggregatt
14,300 tons, leaving a margin of only 2700
tons for machinery and coal. At least
1000 tons should be carried of the latter
and thus only 1700 tons remains for ma
chinery. To obtain a speed of 24 knots
would require not less than 40,000 horse
power, representing a weight of about
3500 tons. There is therefore a deficit of
1800 tons due to an effort at attaining a
speed that is not required in such a
formidably armed and protected battle
ship.

Six battleships are to be laid down for
the Russian navy during the present year.
They are enlargements and improvements
of the Borodino type, 460 feet in length,
80 feet beam and 6000 tons displacement
on a mean draught of 26 feet. Engines of
18,000 horsepower are calculate.! to give
a speed of eighteen knots. The main bat
tery is composed of four twelve-inch and
twelve eight-inch guns. Two of the ships
are to be fitted with Belleville and two
with Nlclausse boilers, leaving two still
undetermined as to type of boilers.
The Russian fleet in the Black Sea is,
according to English accounts, in a high
ly inefficient state. The annual naval
maneuvers are repetitions of those carried
out fifteen years ago, and the ships are in
bad shape. The boilers of the battleship
Rotislviv are said to be second-hand af
fairs, and the hulls of the Catharlna II
and Georgi Pobleddonosetz are claimed
to be of such frail construction as to be
unable to stand the strain of discharging
their heavy guns.
The 7\Â»-inch gun of forty-five calibers,
made by the Vlckers Company, England,
for the Chilean battleship La Libertad.
was tested last month. The shell., weigh
ing 2(0 pounds,- attained an initial velocity
of 3003 feet per second with a charge of
eighty-six pounds of cordite, exerting a
muzzle energy of 12.370 foot tons. Its pen
etration is calculated to be eight inches of
Krupp steel at 3000 yards, equal to that, of
the United States' latest naval gun of
eight inches, which fires a projectile
weighing 250 pounds. It is claimed for
the Vlckers gun that it can be fired at the
rate of eight rounds per minute.
Two British gunboats, Esk of 363 tons
and Firebrand of 455 tons, were recently
sold at auction at Hongkong. They had
been stationed in China waters for over
twenty years and were no longer sea
worthy. Their hulls were composite, built
twenty-six years ago, yet the prices
brought were remarkably high, the Esk
being knocked for $10,300 and the Fire
brand for $16,000, indicating a good state
of preservation, notwithstanding their ad
vanced age.
The small town of Rostock, Germany,

Some of the stories told of personal experience in
business and of success resulting from thrift are in
teresting. Z. T. Evans, a mattress manufacturer, of
New Orleans, said: "I started in business with $90,
working by hand, afterward with horsepower. Busi
ness prospered, and during the past year $25,000
passed through the bank. We employ twenty-five
hands." Edward Berry of Athens, Ala., discussed
the hotel business. He said that he was running a
hotel for the people, not white or black, but for all
the people. "Our guests," said he, "are the best
white people who come to the city of Athens." L.
Winters, a negro produce dealer, of Nashville, stated
that during the past six months he had shipped $50,
000 worth of produce. Eugene S. Booze, who is rated
as the third negro merchant in Mississippi, told how
he started in business some years ago with $70. In
addition to a successful business he now owns a build
ing worth $15,000. R. R. Stiedson of Selma, Ala,,
started some years ago on a very small capital and
to-day has one of the largest and best-kept businesses
among the colored men in his State. He reports the
friendly relations existing between the races in his
city. "Conduct a business on a fair and legitimate
basis," said he, "and your patronage will come from
the whites as well as from those of your own color."
It may be noted in this connection that there is
published at Nashville one of the best organs of the
colored people in the country, the Palladium.
The editor of that paper has steadfastly urged
his people to profit by the opportunities of
the ' race instead of complaining of the dif
ficulties and antagonisms that confront them.
In a recent issue of his paper he said: "The con
tinued agitation of the negro problem is doing the
negro great harm. It is causing the white people to
draw the color line in places where it was never
drawn before."^-. He adds: "These conditions are
being caused by outside interference â that is, people
'at the North firing into the people at the South
with no other object than to stir up strife between
the sections and races. And, further, by a bagpipe
clement of negroes who are calling conventions,
passing resolutions, which engender bad feeling
between the races. The negro ought to have sense
enough to know the bad effect of his hot air when
squirted at white people. The hot-headed negro at
tempts to show in so many words what he would
do with the while race if he had power; the white
man in turn retaliates by showing the negro what
he can do with the negro who is powerless to help
himself, and away goes the few privileges we onc,e
enjoyed."
The conclusions of the Palladium are strictly busi
ness. It says: "The power of money should be
tested by the negro race instead of the power of a
division of sentiment among the white race favorable
to the negro. The money will stand by you when
the divided sentiment will allow reading matter con
cerning the hanging of a negro to appear daily."
WHILE so much is being said of the more
gloomy aspects of the negro problem and
of the relations, of the two races in the
Southern States, it is highly gratifying to have such
a presentation of the brighter side of the issue as
was made by the recent convention at Nashville of
the National Negro Business League. From first to
last the proceedings of the convention appear to
have been in the highest degree encouraging. The
convention was well received by the white people
of the city, the Legislature' granted the Assembly
Hall of the State Capitol as a place of meeting and
a hearty and cordial welcome was given by the
Mayor.
Some of the statements made by the delegates give
clear indications that despite the drawbacks under
which he labors America is nevertheless a land of
opportunity for the black man as well as for the
white, and that a negro who has any business ca
pacity and energy does riot fail to find ample re
ward for his labors. It appears, moreover, accord
ing to the statements of some of the speakers, that
the opportunities are better in the South than in the
Northern States, and several Northern negroes
among the delegates expressed themselves as having
been astonished to note how much of genuine good
feeling existed in Nashville between the better classes
of whites and blacks.
THE NEGRO IN BUSINESS.
Four men were arrested in this city the other day
for attempting primarily to rob a Grand Army man
of his money and incidentally for seeking to teach
him the game of poker. The offense of the black
guards would have been far less grievous had they
simply stolen the old man's, money and left him in
ignorarrte of a game that will be a menace to him
for the rest of his days.

The situation in fact is something like that of
France under the reign of Louis XVI. Louis was
supposed to be an absolute monarch, but as a mat
ter of fact his Government did not have power 1
enough to keep the peace in Paris. The streets
of the capital swarmed with robbers, even as the
principal roads of the kingdom swarmed with high
wa> r men. Government was but a fiction. It was
too weak to protect itself against even so much
as a mob, and France went through her Reign of
Terror not. to overthrow a tyranny, but to save
herself from anarchy.
The Su'Itan is charged with violating his prom
ises, but he is powerless to keep them. There is
lawlessness everywhere. When his troops are or
dered to keep the peace in a village they destroy
it, and when they are withdrawn from a district
the population of- Moslems and Christians immedi
ately begin to exterminate one another. It is use
less to attribute the blame to this side or to that,
for the one set of fighters is about as bad as the
other.
' What is needed in the Balkans is not more lib
erty," but more law. The Government is violent in
its action. solely because it has not strength enough
to act calmly. It is cruel because it dares not be
merciful even if those who direct it were wise
enough to understand the political value of mercy.
Indeed the Government itself appears to be hardly
more responsible than the mobs who defy it, and
until a stronger Government is forthcoming the
disorders and the daily record of atrocities will
go on.
France at trie "collapse of the old regime had
.within herself a sufficient virtue to redeem her
from anarchy. Notwithstanding the effort of the
b.anded despotisms of Europe to uphold the former
order of things she wrought out her salvation tri
umphantly as a free and independent nation. The
populations -"of Turkey have no such virtue.
Divided in race, language and religion, with no
national instinct or any common patriotism to hold
them together, they will convert their country into
a desert by their burnings and their slaughterings
unless some outside power interferes to establish
order and maintain it. In the presence of so great
a problem and so vast a work, the statesmen of
Europe naturally hesitate to intervene further than
to make remonstrances and new and then to de
mand damages. That sort of interference, however,
does little or no "good, for the remonstrances go
to a Government that is powerless to act with effi
ciency. Virtually the Ottoman empire has al.eady
ceased to exist, and its formal sovereignty lingers
at Consta: .inople solely because no one as yet
really wishes to overthrow it. To destroy it would
be easy, but after the destruction there would have
to be reconstruction, and it is the lack of any clear
plan for achieving that which makes Europe pause
and restrain the hands of the leaders of insurrec
tion.
The prolonged disturbance throughout all parts
of the empire, in Asia Minor as well as in Europe,
discloses the fact that the Government has ceased
to ex'ist in anything more than name. Turkey is
r-'opylarly supposed to be a despotism, the Govern
ment is looked upon as a remorseless, cruel all
dominating power, crushing out the liberties of its
subjects and dooming to death the populations of
entire districts that fall under the rage of the
tyrant. That supposition is erroneous. The very
reverse is the case. Turkey is not a despotism, but
an anarchy. The disturbances in the empire arc
due not to a tyranny, but to a lack of any law
whatever. The Government has no power suffi
cient to restrain its own soldiers or to suppress the
rebels. The righting and the massacres that follow
one another so fast and furnish to the news of the
'day '50 many atrocities are. the results of a sus
pension of law, of the overthrow of authority and
the collapse of government.
Were a despostism the cause of the evils in the
Balkans the world might look for better things
by a mere change of. the sovereign,, or perhaps
even of a minister, but being as it is the result of
a weakness inherent in the empire itself, there
seems no way of providing a remedy other than
that of the erection at Constantinople of an en
tirely new Government.
DESPITE^ the confusing and often contradic
tory nature of the reports from the Balkan
states, enough of truth emerges to justify
the belief that the time is near at hand when the
long struggle of the Turk to maintain himself in
Europe will have to be abandoned and the empire
he now swa> r s be given over to another power, or
divided among many.

.The success of the third rail electric
service to and from Mill Valley has
Justified *the Js*ort.h Shore in announcing
a winter schedule with three trains more
than present time table. The new time
card is a big improvement, and no doubt
will full>* satisfy the wants of the people
of Marin County. Many of the residents
across the bay have already signified
their intention of remaining there during
the winter. The new schedule will also
be the means of inducing many people
to build homes In Marin County, for the
climate and attractions are unexcelled.
The North Shore people recently issued

The open-air vaudeville performance is
a leading feature. Each performer is an
artist and furnishes first-class entertain
ment to the many who come to listen. On
the programme are: Joe Sullivan, in com
edy effusions: Nellie Bruce, in specialties;
Behan, an entertainer; the Leos, dancers,
and Behan-Mascotte and Be.han, in sing-
Ing and dancing specialties. The side
shows were well patronized and are worth
more than the price of admission. It is
the intention of the management to im
prove the place continually and to make
it onÂ« of the finest resorts of its kind in
the world.
Coney Island is the leading attraction
at the beach. Hundreds of people visited
the inclosure yesterday and the improve
ments made during the last week are
pronounced. Mile. Anetti made another

Tyndall Interests "Audience.
Dr. J. Mclvor-Tyndall's lecture on
"How to Read Thought," drew a large
audience to Stelnway . Hall last night.
The famous student of psychic science ex
plained the principles of thought-trans
mission, giving it as his opinion that har
mony is the law of successful operation
along all lines. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall cited
the recent accounts of the "failure of the
Marconi system in reporting the yacht
races off Sandy Hook, the failure being
due to the inharmonious condition of the
atmosphere, caused by wranglfng and dis
sension of the rival companies reporting
the races. This, he said was what he had
prophesied from the first. lie gave it as
his own experience that thought-trans
mission resulted in either failure or dis
aster whenever the conditions were an
tagonistic or inharmonious. The lecture
was aptly Illustrated by experiments in
thought-transference. Dr. Mclvor-Tyn
dall announced that next Sunday evening
Dr. Albert J. Atkln would address the
audience on the subject of his recent dis
covery that it is not oxygen but electrici
ty that enters the blood through inhala
tion.
Scheel Concerts.
The greatest feature of the Scheel con
certs .which are now being successfully
presented at the Grand Opera House is
the Idea of presenting one or more nov
elties at each concert. The programme
for the third concert will contain two
compositions which so far have never
been heard here before. The first one
will be Max Schilling's prelude to the sec
ond act, of "Zugweide," and the second
will consist of Edward Grieg's dainty
characteristic bit, "Symphonic Dance No.
4." The other composers represented on
the programme are Goldmark, Mozart,
Schubert and Wagner; truly a splendid
array of master works. Scheel has never
lost any of his great influence here and
this has never been more forcibly dem
onstrated than now, when his concerts are
regularly attended by nearly two thous
and auditors. There are few symphony
leaders who could accomplish such a feat
in our otherwise critical community and
this alone is a strong indorsement of
Fritz Scheel as a master musician and
particularly a master conductor.
It is probable that to-day the rate of rein

Reinsurance Hates.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 3O.-An Im
perial rescript, dated August 28, is pub
lished, appointing Minister of Finance
Witte president of the Ministers.* The
rescript, at the same time, entrusts him
with the work of bringing to a speedy
and successful conclusion the negotia
tions for the Russo-Gennan commercial
treaty and with the continued supreme
direction of the Ministry of Finance, in
order that his close acquaintance with
the requirements of Russian commerce
and industry may be fully utilized.
" The Official Messenger announces the
appointment of M. Pleske. director of the
Imperial State Bank, as Minister of
Finance. Although the resignation of M.
Witte of the post of Minister of Finance
was expected ever since his last budget
statement, which had a valedictory' tone,
the secret was well kept. M. Witte went
to Peterhof after midnight and presented
to the Czar his resignation and his re
commendation of M. Pleske as his suc
cessor simultaneously, in order to fore
stall an intrigue in the interest of some
follower of M. Plehwe, Minister of the
Interior. M. Pleske has made a good
reputation as director of the Imperial
State Bank, but he never has exhibited
any initiative, remaining a loyal subor
dinate of M. Witte, and doubtless he will
try to carry on his policy. The position
of president of the Committee of Minis
ters is one of great honor, but M. WItte's
future influence is regarded as problem
atical and his promotion is considered a
triumph for the Plehwe interests.

There are more good laughs to the min
ute this week at' the Orpheum than at a
three-ring circus with all the clowns
working overtime. Sketches are numer
ous and the clever people who present
them are deserving of all the applause
that is showered on ttiem. One of the
features of the show Is "A Picture from
Life," portrayed by Lew Bloom and Jane
Cooper. Bloom comes out in a tramp
make-up that makes Nat Wills look like
an imported wedding suit. Bloom also
has a great monologue and some taking
songs, all of which are hugely enjoyed.-
Miss Cooper helps > out nicely and the
sketch goes through with a laugh. Oliver
Levine, May Levlne and Tudor Cameron
make things lively during their turn. Miss
Levine is a splendid dancer and contor
tionist. Lavigne does some tum
bling and Cameron creates merriment by
his ludicrous tumbles. Marguerite and
Hanley are really sensational acrobats.
Marguerite does what Is called "ground
work" and Hanley poises in the air and
is aided In his back somersaults by her
strong throws. Professor Schlelneger
plays the harmonica in excellent style.
He performs the most difficult arias on
the mcuth organ and his artistic perform
ance scored a big hit. The Fleury trio?
open the bill and present a lot of new
novelty dances. Sam Edwards and com
pany appear In "A Pass for Two" and
create a great deal of fun by their good
acting. T. Nelson Downs styles himself
"King of Coins." He is certainly en
titled to the high sounding title, as he is
a marvel at manipulating money. He
palms twenty-one coins at one time and
puzzles his audience by his cleverness.
Edwin Keough and Dorothy Ballard are
In their last week. Their sketch, "A
Vaudeville Surprise," shows their ver
satility. Larkins and Patterson, singers
There are two acts, both well staged,
with three scenes in each. In the first
act there are twelve musical numbers and
In the second there are ten. Every air is
sparkling and catchy and few have been
heard here before. The list of selections
are: "When I Was Born," "Little Sister
Kissie," "Teach Me How to Kiss." "From
Far Cohoes," "Wine, Women and Song,"
"La Belle Parisienne," "My Little Baby,"
Chinese Ballet and chorus," "Follow On,"
"We Will Stand and Die Together," "She
is the Belle of New YorK," finale, "When
We Are Married," "It Was the Dutch,"
the Ornamental Purity Brigade, "Mamie
Clancy," "Meet Me on the Beach," the
Shepherd Ballet, dancing specialty,
"Mameelle Bon Bush," finale.
on the stage afterward was the signal
for an outburst of applause. Miss Alice
Pollard and Miss Eva Moore played In
the role of Violet Grey, Salvation Army
lassie and the belle of New York. The
role was sustained to perfection and the
vocal parts were well received. Master
Teddy McXamara, a diminutive chap,
scarcely above the footlights, played
Blinky Bill McQuirk, a mixed ale pugil
ist, and Miss Merle Pollard, even smaller
than he, appeared as Mamie Clancy, a
Pell-street girl, and his sweetheart. Mas
ter W. Thomas did fine work as Karl
Pompernick, a polite lunatic, and hi3 dia
lect was perfect, and Fred Pollard, as a
sailor in the "Flag Song" was obliged to
reappear several times. Miss Connie Pol
lard, as Fin Fricot, a little Parisienne,
captivates the spectators and her dainty
manner and voice make her a pronounced
favorite. Miss Lillle Moore, as Harry
Bronson, a young spendthrift, has plenty
to do while the acts last and does herself
proud at every hand. The others in the
cast are May Martin, Midas Martin, May
Topping, Ruby Roberts, Merle Pollard,
Irene Finley, Irene Gouldlng, Daphne
Pollard, Oscar Heintz, Devlin Brown,
Lily Bull, Ivy Pollard, Nellie McNamara
and Laura Merton.
The little people held the boards at the
Grand Opera-house last evening. Pol
lard's Lilliputian Opera Company opened
with a production of the "Belle of New
York" and scored a splendid success. No
better array of midgets and tots ever ap
peared on the stage in this city and few
audiences have ever witnessed finer work
or applauded more heartily.
When the curtain went- up on the first
act the house was packed. Each seat in
t*e large auditorium was occupied and
the boxes were all taken. Standing room
was at a premium and many were turned
away. The same condition | is likely to
prevail for the rest of the week, as the
excellence of the enow will surely be her
alded and crowds will undoubtedly re
spond to the call. The singing was good.
The choruses were sound and clear and
the solos gave' the highest satisfaction.
Every child was an artist. "When it came
â¢to acting they were up to the mark and
in the vocal allotments they surpassed
many of their seniors in Morton and Ker
ker's musical comedy.
Master Jack Pollard, as Ichabod Bron
son, president of the Young Men's Res
cue League and Anti-Cigarette Society
of Cohoes, is certainly a wonder. He cap
tured the audience with his opening song,
"From Far Cohoes," and his appearance
Miss Lillian Kemble gave an excellent
interpretation of Mrs. Dane. Her sim
ulations were capital and her deceiving
powers were strong, enough to gain the
sympathy of the audience as they were
sufficiently human to hoodwink Justice
Sir Daniel Carteret, of course, until such
time as he let loose his legal experi
ence in forcing the truth.
"Mrs. Dane's Defense" is splendidly
mounted. It Is one of the strong at
tractions of the week.
From first until last he was equitable,
and his arraignment of the false, his
condemnation of the hypocrite and the
sycophant when pouring out truths from
his vial of philosophy to the lovable
Lady Eastney, deligntfully played by
Miss Adora Andrews, was intensely
powerful.
tor of rare attainment.
Triumph was marked all over "Mrs.
Dane's Defense" last night at the -Cali
fornia Theater. There was no mistaking
the entire approval of the hlg assemblage
and there was no questioning the deep
impression made by Henry Arthur Jones'
exquisite four-act masterpiece.
Probably of all the gems written by the
prolific playwright none has ever shown
more brilliant handling, more reflned set
ting or liner sparkle than "Mrs. Dane's
Defense," and It 1m a matter of congrat
ulation that the Nelll-Morosco Company
Is of such all round excellence as to be
able to Interpret a play calling for the
highest, the most sensitive and cultured
dramatic and comedy treatment.
Of course, the rest of the week, In
which it will be played, will draw to the
California big audiences, for the simple
reason that r.o one regarding an absolute
ly line play and respecting the best of
acting could afford to miss the oppor
tunity given by "Mrs. Dane's Defense" to
enjoy an evening thoroughly.
To Frank MacVicars, Sir Daniel Car
teret, much of the triumph of the even
ing was due. His acting, his portrait
ure of the kindly Justice, became so con
vincing, so sympathetic, so masterly,
that he amazed even those . who have
before acknowledged him to be an ac-

former club by a score of 7 to a.- ."., ' â¢ 3 "
It was a bright, snappy game and ap
pealed strongly to all those interested in
outdoor sport*. Both sides were in ex
cellent condition and showed the effects
of the careful, conscientious training
they have been put through during the
past two weeks. The spectators were
quick to applaud and cheer all the smart
plays and showed full appreciation of the
way the game was put up.
The first game opened with a rush.
Lyons drew the ball, passing it to Thc
berge, who attacked Hurons' goal.
This was so well guarded he was unable
to score. After many exciting moments
the ball was returned to Tecumsehs'
goal and thrown into the net by Wil
liams. Following this came many fine i
combination plays and many e::uiting
runs up and down the field by the differ
ent players.
For the Hurons George Williams was
the Individual star. With his co-joperation
the Huron home, composed of Crilly,
Judge an<r Mlnto, worked out many valu
able combinations, which brought out
their large score.
Burden, Peterson and Lynch on. the de
fense were the star player:* and kept the
home supplied with the ball.
The Tecum3ehs' defense was the
strongest part of their team, the field and
home not playing up to their usual form.
Tansey was Injured in the second game,
which naturally handicapped his play
ing, although he pluckily continued and
won four of thejlve scores by his team.
Particular mention must be made of the
play of M. Lyons. Whenever a scuffle en
sued It was generallj* the auburn-haired
*oy who emerged with the ball. Points
were scored as follows, the game begin

The Spectators Quick
to
.; the Plays
Coast Champion Freeman arrived yes
terday from British Columbia. Freeman's
defeat at the hands of Powell was un
doubtedly due to a lack of training, as
he has several. times since beaten Powell
easily. The champion is troubled with
enlargement of the heart and stated that
he is afraid to let himself out. He will
be in good trim by the end of the week
and will defend both his championship
titles. Freeman is anxious to play in the
mixed doubles and will probably join
forces with one of the southern women

NEW YORK. Aug. SO.-The result of
the Futurity was the chitf topic dis
cussed Â«>y turfmen to-day, and among
them, there was a general regret. that the
big race could not have been run over, a
dry track in bright weather. Hamburg
Belle's performance in the' niud must not
be regarded as an ? special advantage for
Ler over the colts and fillies she de
feated, for she has been a phenomenal
sprinter on a dry track and has always
shown a preference for that, kind of go
ing. 'John E. Madden, in speaking; of the

years that Mme. Modjeska. the actress,
has lost the large fortune she earned in

been quite able to cease acting any time
she wanted to in the last ten years, but
continues her Â¦ professional ' work because
she likes it. Most of her fortune isin

ALAMEDA, Aug. 30.â Lying In a quiet
room at his home, 1911 Alameda avenue,
Arthur P. Peck, the young employe of
the Sunset Telephone who was attacked
and brutally beaten by a quartet of thugs
at First avenue and East Twelfth. street,
Oakland, last night, is not yet out of
danger. At times he is only semi-con
scious and the attending physician, Dr.
C. George Bull, has ordered that no one
but the nurses be allowed to enter his
apartment. Peck is'ncw said by the doc
tor to be in a more serious condition than
he was last night, as the shock has seri
ously affected him. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ~s}i\-%
scalp is frightfully gashed to
the skull in two. places and tho wounds
appear as if they were caused by some
jagged, blunt instrument One of the
openings is of such a nature that It can
not be drawn together and considerable
of the skull is exposed. The patient is
also suffering from many contusions of
the body. Peck has not been able to give
a coherent description of his assailants
and no effort was made to-day to obtain
that information from him.
Mrs. Lizzie Peck, mother of the injured
young man, is indignant at " the
fact that Bome of the passengers
on the car from, which Peck was
dragged before being assaulted,
did not go to his assistance.. L. II. Ja
cobi of this 'city, manager of the Sub
set Telephone Company, is an uncle of
Peck and he intends to leave nothing un
done that may result in the apprehension
and prosecution of the thugs who at
tacked his nephew.' The Oakland police
are at work on the case.

Morning, but How He En
tered Store Is a Mystery.
The Union Drugstore, 400 Sutler street,
was looted some time during the early
hours of yesterday morning.
At midnight Saturday Dr. Searly locked
up the store, at which timo' everything
seemed safe and secure. On opening the
store yesterday rnorning. however, it was
discovered that the . till had been rifled
of the sum of $19, while a small bank
had beenpried open and the contents ab
stracted. * Â¦
A . further investigation revealed the
fact that the thief had escaped through
the back door, through which he could
not have entered the store, as it has no
lock or latcn on the outside.
A further examination was made and it
was evident that the front door had not
been tampered with, which led the police
to believe that the thief had hidden and
was locked up in the store at the time
it was closed for the night.

TACOMA. Wash., Aug. 30.â Nickels and
dimes float into Dawson postofflce at the.
rate of $10 per week and the diminutive
coins are not allowed to go back into cir
culation. Any coin of less value than 23
cents has no standing and commands no
respect in the Klondike country and thÂ»
penalty is deportation on sight
The postofflce gets the greater number
of the nickels and dimes, because people
feel that when they are turned in there
they will be roing back to the Govern
ment which is the source of their supply.
The small coins are wrought into the-
Klondlke by newcomers from outside.
Sometimes church collections receive
them Instead of the postofflce. Last spring
a new comer bought nails to the value of
40 cents at a hardware store, making pay
ment in nickels and dimes. The proprietor
took the chicken feed and Immediately
threw it into the stove. The stranger was
surprised, but took his lesson gracefully.
Special Dispatch to The Call
It is generally supposed that when the
fish leave the fresh water of the hatch
eries for theocean they do not return for
five years. President Jordan of Stanford
has proven that in many instances they do
not return to their place of birth for seven
years. Where the fish go in the mean
time still remains a mystery and the out
put of the hatcheries is now teing gener
ally branded with the object of ascertain
ing where and when they may be caught
in any part, of the world. Charleton's
specimen has been preserved in alcohol
and will be shipped to the Alaska Pack
ers' Association at San Francisco.
; TACOMA. Wash.. Aug. 50.â A small fish
caught at Nome two weeks ago will serve
tfce purpose of helping to show what be
comes of the fish from the Alaskan
hatcheries during the interim of five or
seven years before they return to their
native waters for spawning. The fish in
question was a two and a half pound Dol
ly Varden trout, caught at Nome by J. W.
Charleton. It bore the brand of the
hatchery of the Alaska Packers* Associa
tion at Karluk, on tne southern coast of
Alaska. Finding It in the Bering Sea is
considered strong proof of the success of
the salmon hatcheries on the Alaskan
coast.

ALAMEDA. Aug. 30.â What is ex
pected to be the most important con
ference yet held between the City Trus
tees and the representatives of the
Southern Pacific Company, relative to
the two applications for local railroad
franchises sought by the corporation, is
scheduled to be held in the committee
room of the municipal board Monday
afternoon, commencing at 2 o'clock.
General Manager Julius Kruttschnltt of
the Southern Pacific has signified his
intention of attending the meeting and.
as he is in a position to speak with
authority for the company, definite re
sults are expected. Although It has not
been so stated the discussion will prob
ably be executive.
The status of the matter of the local
franchises bo far as the Southern Pacific
Is concerned at present Is this: Two
ordinances granting to that corporation
the trackage and transportation privi
leges it wants, framed after and em
bodying the stipulations recommended
by trie Citizens' Advisory Committee of
fifty, have been introduced In the Board
of City Trustees.. Copies of these or
dinances are in the possession of the
management of the Southern Pacific.
The concessions demanded in these
documents in return for the franchises
will be taken up and considered separ
ately at the conference Monday. It is
understood that the officials of the
Southern Pacific are willing to grant
most of them, but the stipulation re
quiring the corporation to pay into the
city treasury $500 a month for the priv
ileges conveyed j in the franchises is
said to be the hurdle that the railroad
people refuse to take and on the settling
of this point much will depend.

tributes to the country, and honor to the

county laEt evening and remained at the
institution until 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The grwt'ng given by the "old boys" to
these distinguished leaders took on the
character of a great ovation.
The first demonstration of welcome was
informal but Impressive. The veterans
of their own accord alligned themselves
along the main avenue of the reservation
and saluted the^commanders upon their
arrival.
After dinner at the officers' - cottage,
Generals Black and Shafter went to
Social Hall, where nearly all the members
of the Home had assembled to see and
hear the commanders. The audience
composed veterans of three warsâ the
Mexican war, the great war for the pres
ervation of the Union and the Spanish-
American war.

leneral Nicholson is responsible, for the
information that there was practically no
valid connection between the intelligence
department and the defense committee
of the Cabinet. Colonel Altham testified
that even- Boer gun was known and
traced after the war. The British local
defense scheme was, however, based on
an inadequate force. It merely required
that generals should report how they
rould make the best of what troops they
had and that the experts by their desire
should prepare a plan of a scheme of
mobilization in the early summer. But
the Government would not vote the extra
necessary money until it was forced to
L,ON*DON. Aug. 3O.-The revelations
contained in the report of the Royal Com
mission on the conduct of the war In
South Africa have filled all England with
consternation and indignation. Of the
three volumes Ju^t Issued much has been
rujjpreased 'In the public Interest," but
enough remains to justify apparently the
opinion freely expressed that the War
O3cÂ« at the outbreak of the trouble- was
in a state of Incompetence which is noth
ing short of amazing.
In America the memories of "embalmed
beef" scandals and of the buying of rot
tea hulks at enormous prices to serve as
auxiliary eunbGats. or supply ships, are
Ftill tresh, as are the revelations of the
state of unprer>aredness of the army to
undertake the war with Spain. But never
was the War Dcuartment of the United
States shown to be In anything like such
a stat* of rottenness into which the evi
dence of witnesses proves all too plainly
the British War Office had fallen when
the time came to back up England's
words with England's might.
According to the testimony of General
Nicholson, the intelligence section of the
"War Office relating to the South African
war was run on the two-men-and-a-boy
principle, with two officers and one clerk.
The Treasury, against the united recom
mendation of the War Offlce. refused any
increase. Hence it is not surprising that
v hen England went to war there was no
effective map whatever of the Orange
Free State, the Transvaal or NataL To
quote Lord Kitchener's own testimony,
according to official memorandum, "The
field intelligence department had to be
created from the very beginning."

TACOMA. Wash., Aug. 30.â Almost the
last unexplored part of Alaska has been
traversed during the past year by J.
Marsh, assayer and mineralogist, who re
turned to Nome early In Augrust' after a
trip of two years through the Â¦wilderness
between the Arctic Ocean and Koyukuk
River. Marsh â¢tarted with T. G. Carter
In August two years ago, taking passage
on the sr.hoon*r Helen for the mouth of
Colville River # which empties Into the
Arctic. - Storms delayed their pawing
Point Barrow and the ice prevented their
reaching Colville River. They according
ly went to Camden Bay. but their dogs
died while they wintered there. Carter
did not wish to enter the Interior without
dogs and Marsh started out alone. Build
ing a sled, .he hauled 1200 pounds of provi
sions by relays to a point ninety miles in
land on the Kooguru River. This stream
Is 280 miles long and unmapped. Marsh
found five rivers, as follows, between
Colville River and Turner River, the lat
ter being near the international boundary:
Koopowruk. Sawanukto, Savoavik, Koo
guru and Barter.
Marsh sDent the summer of last year
prospecting on the Kooguru, but found no
trace of gold, the country being of a lime
stone formation and of comparatively re
: cent elevation from the sea. Game and
furs are plentiful. Including four kinds
: of bears, gray wolves, foxes, caribou and
millions of ptarmigan. During this period
Marsh was alone for nearly nine months
and during one period of 128 days he heard
1 no human voice other than his own. Re
turning to his cache last fall Marsh met
! Carter, Ned Arrey, two Japanese and
j tome native* who were wintering with
| them. He spent the winter teaching two
! native children. This spring he started
out alone, going across the country to
' ward Koyukuk. He found mineralized
I country and prospected. His grub was
! getting low and he decided to make the
' Yukon. While journeying on a raft elgh
| teen days down the Chandler River he had
j no food except flour. Soon after Mail
Carrier Jack Carr came along, en route
i from Koyukuk to Fort Yukon and Marsh
i accompanied him. He reached Fort Yu
kon emaciated, long-haired and flat broke.
! General Funston carried him to Nome on
: the transport Jeff Davis. Marsh obtained
I data of great value for mapping the coun
try he explored.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Secretary Root intends to take advan
tage of the recess between the filings of
the briefs and the oral arguments to wit
ness the British army maneuvers.
LONDON, Aug. 80.â Secretary of War
Elihu Root, ex-Secretary, of State John
W. Foster,. Hannis Taylor and Judge
, John M. Dickinson arrived at Liverpool
on the Celtic to-day tor the meetings of
the Alaskan 'Boundary Commission,
which will open In London September 3.
They were received at Liverpool by Mr.
Petherick, as the United States dispatch
agent, on behalf of the American Em
bassy. The party -came directly to Lon
don and on their arrival here, were met
by Secretary Carter of the United States
Embassy.' Mr. Root registered at the
Hyde Park Hotel, while the other'mem
bers of the party established themselves
at the ; Carlton - Hotel. The Canadian
Commissioners also are here. ~ United
States Embassador Choate has arranged
to /give a dinner In honor of Secretary
Root, at which all. the American' and
British representatives will be present.
The Commissioners are already familiar
with the facts of the case, which were
filed several months ago.
.' At the first meeting. of the Commis
sioners next Thursday the Americans
and Canadians will submit their briefs,
which will be a condensation of the facts
and arguments regarding the Interpreta
tion of the treaty. The commission will
then announce the day, on which the oral
arguments will . be heard.
The documents have not yet been made
public, but the , Associated Press corre
spondent learns that the whole contro
versy centers upon Canada's effort to
acquire ah outlet to the sea. It is known
authoritatively that -the Canadian agent
asserts that under the Russo-Britlsh
treaty of .1825 the line, properly crosses
numerous Inlets, Including the head
waters of the Lynn Canal. The conten
tion seems to be that the fnlets less than
six miles wide situated in the disputed
region belong to Canada.
United â¢ States Commissioner Foster
vigorously opposes - this view, holding
that the treaty clearly places the line
thirty miles inland, following the sinuo
sities of the coast, thus separating Can
ada from all the arms of the ooean and
putting Porcupine Creek and the gold
district under American Jurisdiction.
The American representatives are con
fident that their position is unassailable.
The Commissioners expect that the com
plete "consideration of the entire case will
take less than two months and that even
should the commission fall to render. a
majority award the facts "will be clearly
established. This will lead to an easier
settlement in the future.
Representatives of America
Are Sure Their Position Is
Unassailable.
Alaska Boundary Com
mission Will Meet
Thursday.,
(Class "H.")
City of Mexico, Aug. 27, 1903.

If the father had reasons for the slight
est fear that his daughter would marry
contrary to his wishes, they ,we,re soon
abandoned, for not long after he had
given vent to his feelings Miss Colfelt

for the Philippines as an officer of the
Eighty-fifth Company of the Coast Ar

At this function the , rivalry of Prince
George of Crete and Prince i Andrea of
Greece tor the "favor of... Miss Colfelt was
keenly noted by those present and formed
a subject of comment for. several weeks,
especially in view of the fact that it was
clear that the American woman did not
encourage the advances of the matri
monially inclined young npblemen:. not
those of other royal persons, who seemed
determined to win her hand. Â¦ y . ,
About this time the news of Miss Col
felt's social conquest in Athens had
reached her father in this ' country and
he is quoted as expressing the hope "that
his daughter's head would not be turned"
and he added: "I do not wish her to wed
a nobleman and sell herself for an empty
title." . - - - â¢'-Â¦ -i 'â¢
His departure was followed by that of
Miss Colfelt and her mother to Europe
and January, a year ago, found the fair
young American occupying a cosy house
In the secluded portion of Athens. It was
not long before Miss Colfelt was a wel
comed member of society of the Greek
metropolis and on January 15, 1902. the
story of her formal, presentation to. the
Queen of Greece was announced in the
telegraphic columns of the newspapers of
this country. "A woman of many accom

winning the admiration of the Queen and
it was not long before the Queen had her
as her honored guest at a court ball.

On the completion of his schooling.
Young Taylor, who is the son of a bank

while there he had the good fortune to
frequently meet his former school mate,
who had blossomed Into a beautiful wom

Young Taylor, however, suddenly cut
short his courtship, for he was at once
assigned to the Coast Artillery and soon
shifted to more lonely quarters. â¢
She is journeying to Japan, where her
fiance, unable to meet her on this con
tinent, awaits her coming, with plans ar
ranged for the wedding, which will take
place in Yokohama during the latter part
of this month. Miss Colfelt's coming
marriage has been a subject of consider

She is the daughter of the pastor of

The creature lost her composure and
turned pale. "Yes; It Is so," she admitted
at last. When confronted with her pre-
O'Leary was sent to a cell for reflection
and the detectives went to the prison and
summoned Mrs. Bowers. She was asked
if her relations with the laborer hafl been
proper, and she reiterated her former
statements on that score. She was then
informed that O'Leary had confessed how
he had spent the two nights following the
bridge-builder's death.
WOMEN ABE OVERCOME.
"I spent last Tuesday and Wednesday
nights at the house with Mrs. Bowers at
S7u Clementina street," he finally ad
mitted. He told how she had met him
on her return from her husband's death
bed, how they drank whisky together in
a saloon and remained in the Bowers
house that night and the one following.
He stated that he had not been truthful
in his previous assertions. Now that the
ball has been eel rolling he will be given
other opportunities to spur his jaded
memory.
A thorough search was made of his
rooms without any material results. Miss
Ma-ttle Lovejoy. proprietress of the place,
informed the officers that O'l^eary had not
slept in his room since last Monday night.
As the detectives remembered tnat the
man had not been arrested until Thurs
day night they became inquisitive about
where O'Leary had passed Tuesday and
Wednesday nights. They brought
O'Leary Lack to the Hall of Justice, took
him into a small room and gave him a
"sweating." He succumbed in about an
hour.
The police nave been working hard to
fcnd a motive for the crime, it was cer
tain that Mrs. Bowers could have tecurea
tlie money in the bank at any lime. It

would compel O'Leary to remember wnere
he had roomed and set to worn yesterday
afternoon with that intention. oXeary
finally recalled under examination that
he had Jived on Howard street. He suc
ceeded in discovering that the house was
somewhere between Fourth and Film
streets. Then Detectives Kyan and Cole
man took the man out to Howard street,
between Fourth and Fifth. After
tome delay the prisoner indicated the
lodging-house at Sio Howard street as the
place where he had last roomed.

Admissions.
August Nelson, who is employed at the
Life Saving Station, Ocean Beach, dis
covered a dead man In the bushes about
half a block to the rear of the station
yesterday morning. The man had shot
himself in the right temple with a 38
caliber revolver which was lying beside
the body. Chief Deputy McCormlck re
moved the corpse to the Morgue. There
was nothing in the clothing to give a
clew to identity. The only things found
were a white metal watch with a piece
of leather attached, and a nickel. The
body must have lain there for over a
month. It is that of a man about 60 years
of age, 5 feet 8 inches tall, gray mus
tache, bald on top of the head and the
clothing consisted of a bla<- slouch hat,
black cutaway coat and vest, striped
trousers and striped neglige shirt.
The bodies of two men who sought sur
cease from sorrow by shooting themselves
in the head, the one with a shotgun and
the other with a revolver, were taken to
the Morgue yesterday afternoon.
Christian Buehn, a laborer 49 years of
age, who lived alone at 148 Flood avenue,
Sunnyside, committed suicide by placing
the muzzle of a shotgun In his mouth,"
pulling the. trigger with his big toe and
blowing his head almost off. He and his
wife had been living apart for six weeks,
as she claimed she could not get along
with him. On Saturday night he called
upon his friend, Daniel McGrath, 337
Hearst avenue, and told McGrath that he
was not feeling well and he would have to
send for . a doctor. McGrau. called at
Buehn's house about T o'clock yesterday
morning and found his dead body lying
on" the floor with the shotgun beside it.
The Morgue was notified and Chief Dep
uty McCormlck removed the Lody. Mrs.
Buehn and her six children live at 377
London street.
Chief of Police Wittman will produce
Mrs. Bowers and Mrs. Sutton' in Judge
Cook's court at 10 o'clock this morning in
answer to the issuance of an alternative
writ of habeas corpus for the women's re
lease. The proceedings, will probably re
sult in the filing of formal charges against
the prisoners. Miss Mattie Lovejoy, pro
prietress of the house In which O'Leary
had a room, made the following statement
last night: -li'/P '; ; >"^ .- â¢
I have known tbe man for some time. I
met bim at a restaurant at 1<J Fifth street;
where I wait at the table. He appeared so
ciable and pleasant. I told him I was start
ing a rooming-house and he said he would
come over and look at the rooms. I did not
know that he was a friend of this Mrs. Bow
era or that she lived In the same block back
on Clementina street. He cai*.e 'here two
weeks ago to-morrow. He has not been here
since Tuesday until to-day, when he came with
the detectives. He kept good hours the first
week and paid for his room in advance. He
was working when he first came and was here
only at right and in the morning.- I do not
know anything about his habits, friends or
character.
Tee detectives . have secured a great
amount of damaging evidence, but they
wish to strengthen their case as much as
possible. They can introduce testimony to
show that Mrs. Bowers wished to get her
husband out of the way. They can prove
that she forged the prescription for the
arsenic by Handwriting Expert Kytka.
They can show by Drug Clerk Peterson
that Mrs. Sutton got the arsenic.
Ryan and Coleman were hunting
through the city's drug stores last night
in an endeavor to discover where the poi
son first used was secured. They have
mada a thorough but unavailing search
?of the Clementina-street house for the
package in which the last arsenic was
sold. Several people who may know some
thing of the case are yet to be interro
gated. Great progress has been made thus
far and the case will certainly, go before
a jury. .
The authorities believe that Mrs. Sut
ton arranged the pchfme to murder Mar
tin Bowers. She is declared to have little
character. She is well known in the ten-
Qprlnln. Nevertheless, she possesses a con
siderable amount of intelligence. Her
sister does not appear to have the sense
to plan carefully to kill her husband by
slow degrees. 'Â¦*_> 'â¢
It was Mrs. Sutton whom Drug Clerk
Peterson declares purchased the ounce
of arsenic on August 19. And the woman
has done plenty of skillful fencing with
the oracers who have tried to get infor
mation from her. Mrs. joowers does what
Mrs. Sutton directs.
Yesterday morning detective Ryan be
gan his work by visiting the Waldeck
Sanatorium and securing a list of the
medicines prescribed by Dr. McLaughJln
for Martin Bowers. There was no ar
senic In the list. The record was saved
to be used for evidence.
It was learned yesterday that the mem
bers of the Pile Drivers' Union had been
discussing the rumor that Mrs. Martin
Bov.-erE was poisoning her husband for
several days before the end. David Grush
of the union said yesterday that Harry
Bowers told him about two weeks ago
that he thought that Martin was being
poisoned. Martin Bowers was in disfavor
with his fellow workers for several
months previous to his death on account
of a disagreement over matters pertain
ing to the union. :
Mrs. Elizabeth Byers, mother of Mrs.
Sutton and of Mrs. Martin Bowers, when
seen by a Call representative at her home
in Portland, Ore., last night would say
only, "Anything that I could say at this
end would only embarrass my daughters
under arrest in San Francisco."
Several hundred letters belonging to
Mrs.' Bowers and Mrs. Sutton have been
unearthed. Many of these are from men
and some of them contain much unprint
able matter showing that the women have
unsavory histories.
HUNT FOB CLEWS CONTINUES.

The parade will consist of ten divisions.
Companies A, G and I of the First Regi
ment and Companies B and I of the Fifth

vious statements she confessed weakly
that she had deliberately lied. "But I did
not slve my husband that arsenic," she
continued defiantly.
Then Mrs. Sutton was called before the
ofl'.cers. She knew positively that O'Leary
was nothing to her sister. Their relation
ship had been strictly conventional. The
woman persisted in her assertions and
Mrs. Bowers was summoned. She con
fessed again that Ryan's accusation was
true and Mrs. Sutton was overcome. She,
too, admitted that 6he had known of the
state of affairs and had been grullty of
falsehoods in her previous denials.
' Mrs. Sutton had not stayed with her
bereaved sister the night following the
consummation of the murder because the
latter had other company. Before leaving
the distressed women the officers elicited
from Mrs. Bowers confessions of her rela
tions with Patrick O*L*ary. Thus did the
arduous search fpr a motive for the mur
der end. The shadow of a scaffold Is fall
ing darkly on Mrs. Martin L. Bowers.
The day of the arrests Mrs. Bowers
drew J2S00 from the Hibernia Bank. That
nipht. when the bloodhounds of the law
had Fcented out O'Leary. he had in his
stomach an Inordinate quantity of liquor
and In h's pocket the sum of $15. The de
tectives are confident that the money on
which O'Leary was celebrating was a por
tion of that which Martin Bowers had
