PARIS, July 15.â The , Figaro's â¢- corre
spondent at Rome telegraphs that during
the past two days the Pope \has com
plained of being unable to keep'still and
constantly asked for' things which he re
fused when brought. It is often '. neces
sary to raise him; as he becomce fatigued
through lying, .and . an arrangement has
been adjusted to the bed, enabling the pa
tient to be raised without. being touched.
Yesterday the : Pope complained particu
larly of a lack of- air and his valet, Cen
tra, had to drawback; the green. curtains
cutting off- that part of the chamber In
which. the bed. stands.. â .... â. _â¢,

I ThÂ«' Eclaire's correspondent at Rome
telegraphs', that' yesterday a diplomatist
asked; Cardinal'. Rampolla for the bulls
concerning" | the j Bishops ' appointed at the
last consistory. -The Cardinal replied: j [\
\ "All'of the' ministries, have 'now' ceased
DISORDER" IN VATICAN.
â¢ A curious controversy is proceeding be
tween the Vatican : medical body,' com
posed of ten doctors of lesser importance
than Dr. LapponI and several .foreign
physicians, over the embalming. of Pope
Leo's body. Several, foreigners have of
fered processes of embalming, each more
wonderful than the other, and tho Papal
doctors unearthed Pontifical bulls giving
the right to embalm the Pope solely to
the Vatican, medical. body. . .;
All those around the "patient have' long
since ceased* to > hold definite opinions re
garding .the duration of 'the Pontiff's ex
istence.' The slow but progressive diminu
tion of the strength of the august patient
foretells the approaching end ' of the
struggle with death, but the doctors will
not venture, to "predict how near the end
Is. Constant relapses, they say ,~ such as
created alarm early yesterday,' are grad
ually, wearing. down the. Pope's .constitu
tion, which seems immune from any spe
cific disease. Most persons are inclined
to the idea', that Pope Leo may go
through perhaps two or three repetitions
of yesterday's ups and downs, till, as Dr.
RossonI puts'it," "his 'pulse stops forever."
Three causes, may accelerate the end,
viz.: Inability' to take nourishment,
which was exhibited yesterday, sudden
heart failure 'or" the progression of the
pleura disease. The latter is thought the
least probable. As day succeeds day it
becomes pathologically clearer that it is
a case of a very old man dying because
he has lived his allotted time. .
The Pope himself, yesterday afternoon
ordered the Cardinals to be admitted and
received them â¢ standing, he "whom they
supposed to be at the pointof death say
ing, "Please "be seated." lie recounted the
impressive ceremony of the morning
when he received the benediction qf the
Franciscan Â¦ order, v The Cardinals in
formed him of the worldwide prayera for
his life. Pope Leo. answered that he was
much gratified, but that he was ready for
his final departure! concluding. by saying,
"God's will be done." . .
Even more striking was the Pope's in
terview with his secretary, Monslgnor
Angeli. His Holiness sent for him, say
ing that he wished. to see certain papers,
which the secretary brought. Then, after
a short explanation, Monslgnor Angeli
wished to get the Pope's decision on the
matter, but Pope Leo said:
"Well, well, not to-day. We will do
that some other. time." . < â¢
ernoon, after- a morning in
the course of which his Holiness
suffered spells of delirium and at
times his strength sank to the lowest ebb;
and now, he lies in.no worse 'condition
than he was on Monday "evening, except
for the steady diminution of his strength.
Monslgnor Blslet. master of the chamber,
visited" the sick room just after midnight,
and on emerging] saldj that the Pontiff's
condition was unchanged. A little later
the Pope fell into a sleep; which. It is an
nounced, was fairly tranquil, although
the patient's respiration was troublesome.
' Yesterday's rally was characteristically
opposed to every medical theory. The
Pope got out of the bed on which two
hours previously he himself had made all
preparations for death. Not satisfied
with this exhibition of vitality, he tran
sacted private business and received four
Cardinals, with whom he talked In an ani
mated way. In fact. Pope Leo's record
for yesterday," little of which appeared In
last night's official bulletins, would be in
credible if it were not confirmed by, the
doctors and Cardinals present in the sick
chamber. None seem more, .perplexed
than the doctors themselves. Dr. Lap
poni said frankly;
"I cannot imagine how the Pope man
ages to keep alive." .
( According to physicians the Pontiff may
die at any 'moment, even in the midst of
one of j those extraordinary Intervals
when his .mind . and^L^4y present a com
paratively sound appuarance^;' , '

ALBANY. N. Y., July 14.â The Deputy
Sheriff at Coxsackie prevented a lynching
there this afternoon by smuggling James
Little, a 19-year-old negro, out of the
flimsy jail there and taking him to
Catskill. Early in the ; day Little
attacked the 11-year-old daughter of
a farmer and escaped' after threatening
the child with death. He was captured,
confessed and was placed in jail. While a
mob of farmers and striking molders and
river men, led by the girl's father, was
forming, the 8heriff got Little 'safely
away from the jail. The child is seriously
injured, but may recover.
LEXINGTON, Ky.. July 14.â The room
occupied by General Cassius M. Clay at
Whitehall has been stripped of weapons
by an order of the committee appointed
by the Richmond court to take charge of
his affairs. The revolver and bowie knife
were taken from the room by the ser

that they had been removed by the nurse
and his grateful appreciation of her for

would not let her render him the least
service.

much material damage but no fatalities.
In one case a bomb exploded In the house

was destroyed the cellar of a building oc

LOUISVILLE, Ky.. July 14.â the Re
publican State Con\-entlon, which will
convene to-morrow, promises to be an ex
citing one. The situation in the race for
Governor has apparently reached a phase
wtoere the nomination of a dark horse will
follow the failure of the Bclknap forces to
Â¦win on the first two ballots. There are
three avowÂ«vi candidatesâ Colonel Morris
B. Belknap. a wholesale merchant; E.
Augustus Wilson, a lawyer, and Clifton
J. Pratt, Attorney General. The Belknap
leaders are claiming the nomination of
their candidate on the first ballot.
Major W. C. Owens will act as tem
porary chairman. John W. Yerkes has
been offered the permanent chairmanship,
but It Is understood that he desires to
head the committee on resolutions In or
der that President Roosevelt's Interests
Â»ay be looked after. There is an element
that opposes an Indorsement of President
Roosevelt's candidacy at this time, but as
it is part of the Belknap strength It is
not believed that the anti-administration
faction will jeopardize the chance* of
their candidate for Governor by opposing
Roosevelt resolutions. The resolutions in
co far as they concern the tariff and trust
questions will be of the "stand pat" fla
vor, the sentiment in this regard being
practically unanimous. "*..'

KENTUCKY REPUBLICANS
GATHER AT LOUISVILLE
Calling to one of the mountain guides
above. Potter had him descend the rope
to the ledge, upon which all three were
now resting. Then the two picked up
Mrs. Johns and together they made their
difficult way around dangerous ledges and
over yawning precipices beneath until
finally, worn out and exhausted, they
reached -the rim above once more.
To-night Mrs. John's condition is much
improved, and as no bones were fractured
she will be all right with a night's rest.
With difficulty a rope was securely tied
around Mrs. Johns' waist and an effort
was made to hoist her to the rim above.
This attempt proved futile because of
Mrs. Johns' weight. By leaning over the
precipice Mr. Potter could discern an
other and larger ledge a hundred feet be
low, from which was a sheer drop of hun
dreds of feet. He determined to try a dif
ferent plan of rescue. Giving the order
to those above to lower the rope, Potter
swung the Inanimate form of Mrs. Johns
out over the tiny strip of rock upon
which she had braced herself for fifteen
hours and into the chasm beneath. By
swinging the rope to and fro Potter was
able to lodge Mrs. Johns upon the larger
ledge, and then descended himself.
EFFORTS AT RESCUE.
The party found Mrs. Johns' position to
be critical in the extreme. A closer ex
amination made her escape from a fright
ful death nothing less than miraculous.
She had fallen a distance of 300 feet from
the tip of the crevasse walls and had par
tially stayed her fall by catching scrub
cedar trees through which she had
plunged.
When the rope had been lowered Potter
descended to examine the ground and de
termine the best course to pursue in get
ting Mrs. Johns from her perilous posi
tion. Lodged upon a two-foot ledge, with
her clothing torn to fragments and her
flesh scratched and bruised, lay Mrs.
Johns, weak from exhaustion and lack of
food and benumbed by the chill of the
night.
She was too weak to speak, but was
able by feeble signs to make Potter know
that she still lived. After trying in vain
to work his way down the mountainside
to her Potter was forced to return to the
hotel for more help. Provided with plenty
of ropes and carrying a stretcher, a party
of eight men made their way back to the
crevasse, where work was commenced to
take Mrs. Johns from her dangerous situ
ation on the ledge. Dr. E. A. Brown of
Alameda, who happened to be a t^ Glacier
Point last night, accompanied the relief
party.
WOMAN ON A LEDGE.
YOSEMITE VALLEY. July 11â Mrs. A.
E. Johns of New York City, who had been
staying in the valley a few days, was
found this morning in a steep crevasse
back of Sentinel Dome. Yesterday Mrs.
Johns started from Glacier Point Hotel
to walk to the Assures, located two miles
from the hostelry. Mrs. Lewis, the man
ager of the hotel, cautioned her against
going too far without a guide, and ad
monished her not to remain after daylight
began to fade, as there was grave danger
of losing the trail.
Last night Mrs. Johns did not return,
and Mrs. Lewis realized that something
disastrous had happened. Only, a short
time before Mr. Garren of San Francisco
had missed his way over the trails, and
nothing was heard from him until the
next afternoon. No trace of the missing
woman was found last night.
Early this morning searching parties
started out again, one of them making a
discovery that filled the spectators with
horror. Far down one of the sides of thj
Sentinel fissures, whose crevasses drop
down in some places for thousands of
feet, suspended on a ledge that jutted out
from the steep .sides, of the narrow can
yon, Mr. Potter, a clerk at the hotel,
found the almost lifeless form of Mrs.
Johns.
"Of course, you know that I own the
Topp business. I have about $50,000 in
vested there, which I cannot afford to
have/ lying Idle, and I wan't to see If we
can't make some kind of arrangement in
regard to this Government contract by
which I can get It at a price at which I
can make something, and I am willing to
make it an object to you If you will not
put in a bid, or put It in at a price to suit
me."
Keck informed Littauer that he could
make no arrangement with him, but he
would have to see his father, who was in
New York on his way to Philadelphia to
put In his bid for Government work. After
obtaining Timothy Keek's address in New
York Littauer made an appointment with
him in New York, and Littauer made sub.
stantially the same proposition to him
that he made to his son. Keck, however,
refused to enter Into any arrangement as
proposed by Littauer and put In his bid,
but the contract was awarded to Hr T.
Patterson of Philadelphia,
"Mr. Topp is dead, of course, you
know," said Littauer, to which young
Keck replied that he had heard so. Lit
tauer then said:
NEW YORK. July 15.â The Sun this
morning publishes a special from Johns
town, credited to the Dally Republican, in
which Timothy Keck of Johnstown
throws additional light upon Representa
tive Lucius N. Llttauer's relation to Gov
ernment -contracts. Timothy Keck has
been engaged In the manufacture of
gloves In Johnstown for thirty years.
Keek's firm always had been able to get
Its share of Government work up to 1SD6,
when L. N. Littauer became a member of
Congress. Since that time. Keel? says, he
has had only four contracts, and inci
dents connected with some of these ap
pear very peculiar.
Keck says that in 1S99 he bid on 10,000
pairs of buckskin gauntlets, and although
his bid was the lowest he was awarded
only 2300 pairs, the balance going to Lyon
(who. brought suit against Littauer) and
Littauer supplying the goods. Again, in
1901. he bid upon 4000 pairs of muskrats
for gauntlets, and again his bid was the
lowest, but he was awarded only one-half
of the number of gloves called for, and
the other 2000 pairs were awarded to Wil
liam Topp. Keek's bid was $1 5S?i and
Topp's bid was $1 76% a pair.
William Topp was a manufacturer
fur gloves and buck gauntlets, and died
on April 16, 1902. Two or three days after
that date a large Government contract
for gloves was to be bid for in Philadel
phia, On the day after the death of Topp,
Littauer went from his* home in Glovers
ville to Johnstown and visited the factory
of Timothy Keck & Son. Finding no, one
there, he went to the house of William T.
Keck, a son of Timothy Keck and junior
member of the firm, who says that Lit
tauer entered Into conversation with him
in regard to bids for this Government
work.

"When asked why Canada had been
eliminated from the eastern route on his
maps Lobel explained that a greater ad
vantage was assured the road by trav
ersing the soil of the United States from
the east in that the laws of this coun
try are more favorable to railroad en
terprises than those of the British do
minions and provinces.
As has already been stated, Lobel or
ganized a company In Europe which ob
tained for him financial assurance. Among
the more influential directors of this com
pany are General Payot. the Marquise de
Roussy de Sales and Baron de Lourmel.
Besides these men the patronage com

ROME, July 14.â During the periods of
delirium to-day the Pope's mind wan
dered and he muttered incoherently. He
insisted that shadows flitted about the
room. In his lucid moments the Pope
for the first time showed a complete
realization of the gravity of his condition.
This morning, after the visit of the
doctors, who tried to conceal the gravity
of his situation, the Pontiff said to his
valet. Pio Centra:
"I think I know better. My time is run
ning short. Before It Is too late I wish to
speak to Rampolla."
A few minutes later Cardinal' Rampolla
entered the sick room and remained fif
teen minutes alone with the Pontiff. Then
the latter said:
"I now wish to have the Franciscan
benediction."
Fortunately, Cardinal VIves y Tuto.
who is a Capuchin, was at the Vatican,
and he entered the sick room and fulfilled
the wish of the Pope, who afterward said
he felt relieved and easy in his mind. The
moment was most solemn, the strong,
bearded figure of Cardinal .VIves y Tuto
making a striking contrast with the ema
ciated, white form of Leo XIII.
The Pope was heard to say when Car
dinal Rampolla left, him this morning:
"I renew to you my confidence In this
supreme moment."
While Cardinal VIves y Tuto was in the
pick room the Pope succeeded in reciting
the conflteor and then gave the apostolic
blessing to the whole Franciscan 'order.
As the morning progressed the attacks
of delirium became violent.' His mutter
ings during delirium were not always in
telligible, but .they seemed to relate to
the history of events of many, years ago,
which, being unknown to those present,
neither Dr. Lapponi nor. Centra succeeded
in comprehending. . At times the Pope
seemed to again see apparitions. When
his attendants tried to persuade him to
retire the Pope insisted on indicating the
presence of some imaginary shadow,'
which he not only saw but heard. .. He
said:

barred from trying the case by reason
of the fact that he was once attorney
for the defendant, Mrs. Lillian Davidson,
the nurse who attended Mrs. Ann S. Ross
during her last Illness, was the most
important witness examined during the
day. Counsel for the defense" objected to
her testimony and arguments were nu
merous. Judge Lawlor permitted the wit

previous to her death.
This case is attracting a great deal or
interest in this county. Each day the

The facts in the case are these: Ann
S. Ross died in San Francisco on May
18 1901. leaving an estate valued at $30,000.
It is alleged by William McCann. admin
istrator of the estate, that Annie S. E.
Worn, defendant in the action, gained
possession of the decedent's property by
undue influence, fraud and duress The
complaint shows that the next of kin
were the defendant and Robert Ross
Makin. an adopted son. The latter was
the son of Rebecca Jane Makin, a daugh
ter of the deceased, and had been adopted
by the latter.
Mrs. Ross showed a great deal of af
fection for the child, who was left an
orphan at an early age, and expressed
her intention of leaving her property to
the boy. It is alleged that at the timÂ£
of her last Illness the deceased was about

from cancer, and that to alleviate her
pain she used morphine and other drups.

Mrs. Worn'* daughter, ingratiated him
self with the. deceased and induced her
to sign two deeds giving, valuable hold

The. complaint charges that Perry took
advantage of Mrs. Ross' weakened physi
cal infirmities, old age and credulity and
that no consideration passed between the
defendant and Mrs. Ross. -
The feeling between counsel in the case
is strained. Attorney Thomas P. Boyd
for plaintiff and Attorney Joseph K.
Hawkins exchange curt remarks at every
opportunity. Hawkins this morning at
tempted to tell Boyd how he should con
duct the examination of his witness, and
Boyd. with a great deal of asperity, re
plied that he would take admonitions only
from the court.
Mrs Davidson gave testimony for the
boy She testified to Mrs. Ross* mental
and physical state prior to the time she
signed deeds riving land to the defendant.
"What was her condition of mind? the
witness was asked.
"Unsound." replied the nurse. "Her ap
pearance led me to that conclusion. Her
actions led me to that opinion."
The witness was subjected^ to a close
cross-examination, but did not change her
testimony in any material degree. Shp re
iterated that Mrs. Ross was an incompe
tent person in her last Illness and was in
capable of transacting business. Hawkins
announced he would attempt to impeach
Mrs. Davidson's testimony.
Mrs. Janet S. Porteous of Ross Station,
a friend of Mrs. Rose, was called as a
witness and testified to the physical ap
pearance of the deceased three months
before her death. She stated that she
thought Mrs. Ross was then dying be
cause she looked so ill.
"What was her physical appearance at
that time?"
"Her beautiful expression had gone, her
eyes were shrunken, her face was pale,
her hair was disheveled and altogether
she 'looked a wreck."
Attorney Hawkins attempted to learn
what Mrs. Ross' mental condition was at
that time, but the court sustained the ob
jection of the plaintiffs counsel.

"Not a great while and certainly before
you are much older. Greater feats are
being performed to-day by the engineers
of the world arid I could get a dozen from
as many countries to undertake the very
work that our plans call for in the north
ern waters. Bering Strait is providential

portion of the route of the transcontln

difficulties it will be accomplished, and

the . least , encouragement and this fact
he ascribes to the slowness in which, the
Americans are aroused to the importance
of an undertaking of this character and
particularly when it finds its origin In
some* foreign land.
â¢,'Once across. this continent," said Lo
bel, "and the greater part of our worry
ing is over." It is a grand scheme and
the great American people will eventually
turn to that way of thinking. With their
And later, when Lobel was , asked if he
had as yet figured approximately when
a map. Including these startling engineer
ing feats would be part of the daily les
son, in geography in the schools of the
world, he laughed again, but more assur
ingly than before and slowly replied:
ASSURED OF SUCCESS.
"Tunnels?" queried the interviewer.
"Yes, tunnels." repeated the representa
tive of the Parisian Geographical Society.
"We might temporarily use a ferryboat,
but tunneling 1b part of our scheme and
will undoubtedly be carried out. With the
advantages offered us by the two islands
that He in our way we â¢ would only have
to build two tunnels of less than eighteen
miles each, or, if more convenient to our
plans, two tunnels under the strait of a
distance of sixteen miles each and one
of four miles."
"No. not a bridge, but tunnels'."
Lobel's route over the American con
tinent from the East orlglnally
included part of Canada, but this
idea was eventually eliminated from his
maps. As the plans now are it Is pur
posed to cross the United States from
New York to San Francisco, thence
northward through California, Oregon
Washington and Canada as near as pos
sible along the coast, to Juneau, thence
to Fort Cudahy and then in a westerly
direction to the most westerly point of
Alaska, extending into the Bering Strait.
It will be at this point that Lobel figures
he will encounter his most difficult but
by no means discouraging engines-ing
problem*. The straits have a breadth
from the American to the Siberian shores
of thirty-seven miles. In the waters of
this strait, lying directly in the route of
his proposed road, are the Diomede Isl
ands. Naturally the ordinary observer
would hurriedly BUggest the necessity of
a long bridge, but Lobel, when this sug
gestion was made to him yesterday,
smiled as he replied:
ELIMINATES CANADA.
He is now making a tour of the world
in the Interest of the great railroad
scheme, or rather for the purpose of get
ting the people of various countries of
the globe interested in it, and it is this
motive that has directed him to San
Francisco.
Later - Lobel visited St. . Petersburg,
where, with credentials from the Presi
dent of France and the Shah of Persia,
who had taken kindly to his enormous
scheme, he was enabled to obtain audi
ences with the representatives of the Czar
and from him was guaranteed concessions
of lands and rights of way that are prac
tically the foundation of his railroad
project.
"To-day Lobel carries with him elaborate
maps of the entire route over which he
would have his road extend, numerous
photographs of the many mountainous
countries through which it Is proposed to
establish grades, statistics relating to the
products, the soil, climatic conditions and
other Interesting information along the
route and letters galore tearing upoii his
representations as to the backing he has
and regarding what may be expected in
the way of assistance from the foreign
countries from which he will have to ask
permission and obtain recognition for the
furthering of his undertaking.
Lobel persevered and eventually suc
ceeded In receiving encouragement from
sources he most desired and In a year's
time he found himself at the head of a
syndicate, which in turn has received as
surance of financial support to the extent
of nearly $10,000,000 in Europe in aid of the
preliminary work of the road.
A road that will sustain itself by the
traffic, freight and passenger, developed
through Its own territory; a line that
will transport people from Peking to
Philadelphia, from St. Louis to Vienna,
San Francisco to Rome or clear around
the world without the Inconvenience of
change to steamer, is the gigantic scheme
which M. Loubel is working out in his
mind and an ambition upon which the
greatest hopes of the man are being
built.
It was In 1898 that Lobel visited Alaska
on a scientific mission and acquainted
himself upon the natural conditions of
the northwestern country, and it was
there that he first thought of the great
project that has since interested many
wealthy men of Europe and resulted in
the formation of a big company which,
he says, has pledged him ample funds
for carrying it but. In 1899 Lobel re
turned to Alaska, this time free to devote
his entire time to studying the situation
as it presented itself to his mind. The
more he studied the more convinced he
became that an all rail route around the
world by way of the Bering Strait was
feasible, and hurrying back to Paris he
presented his immature project to the
men of finance, who marveled at the idea.
The Parisian papers were at first inclined
to refer to the proposed undertaking of
Lobel as a magnificent dream, and dis
paraging, too, were the writers of the
press in other of the European papers.

The aged father of the dead man, John
J. Mahoney. who Is well and favorably
known throughout the city, called at the
Morgue and was overcome with grief. Hs
could assign no reason for the actions of
his son. The promptness of Patrolman
McGrayan in sending for the wagon and
the quick drive to the hospital made by
Patrol Driver Comstock had much to do
with saving Shelly's life.
MOTIVE IS UNKNOWN.

the attempted murder and suicide.

widowed mother at 1627 Mason street. Â«u
married about a year ago. He Is an In
dustrious fellow, 30 years of age, and la

The dead man is a son of John J. Slav*

on Stockton street. He resided with his
parents at 510 Vallejo street and waa Â»

associates he was of a quarrelsome dis

barely escaping wounding: the brain. la
addition to these wounds Shelly* s bands
were terribly cut, showing that lie had
attempted to wrest the knife from his as
sailant.
Kramer and Patrolman McGrayan then
hastened to the side of Shelly, who was
lying In a pool of blood, where he had re
ceived his wounds. A hurry call was sent
for the patrol wagon and the woynded
man conveyed to the Central Emergency
Hospltal. . Dr. Harvey, the phy*slcian in
charge, found upon examination that he
had sustained a deep scalp wound on the
hlght side of the head, a superficial wound
on the right side of the neck, a deep
wound of the left cheek and that the
knife had been driven Into his left eye.
His pursuer feared that he contemplated
pulling a gun and did not wish to tackle
him single-handed. He called for assist
ance and several young men and Police
man Frank McGrayan hastened up the
hill In the direction of the cries. Before
any of them could reach Mahoney he had
wnlpped out x razor and. turning his head
upward, puUid the steel across his neck,
nearly decapitating himself. He fell to
the sidewalk and when Kramer came up
to him he waa breathing his last, the
razor lying by his side.
According to these two witnesses the
first they saw of the affair the two men
were scuffling on Mason street, near the
corner of Green. Shelly turned and start
ed to run across k the street, at the same
time exclaiming, "Don't Jack, for God's
sake, don't!" Mahoney followed him and
dealt him a blow In the back which felled
him to the pavement, and then Jumped
on the prostrate man, raining what ap
peared to be blow after blow upon him.
Kramer was standing a short distance
away and ran. to the scene. .Upon reach
ing the two combatants he saw that Ma
honey had a dagger in his hand which he
was Jabbing into Shelly. He grabbed Ma
honey's arm and wrested the knife from
him. Mahoney then rose to his feet and
ran up Mason street toward Vallejo, with
Kramer in close pursuit. Mahoney, upon
reaching. Vallejo street, turned down that
thoroughfare In the direction of Powell
street, and when about in the middle of
the block on the north side suddenly halt
ed and made a movement for his hip
pocket. . â¢ â¢ Â¦
STABS HIS VICTIM.
Shortly before ' 8 o'clock Mahoney and
Shelly, who have been friends for years
and employed at the glove factory of B.
Blumenthal & Co., "at 27 Battery street,
met at the corner of Green and Mason
streets and engaged In conversation. Mrs.
Shelly, mother of the wounded man. who
was sitting at the window of her home,
1C27 Mason street, saw her son talking to
his friend until the darkness shut the
two men from her view.
Hector Maffei, a boy, and Fred Kramer
were the only witnesses of the affair, and
their stories do not differ in the main.
The affair took place about 8 o'clock last
night and the entire neighborhood waa
thrown Into a state of wildest excitement.
The presence of; mind and bravery of
Fred Kramer, a young man residing at
1626 Powell street, no doubt saved Shelly
from death at the hands of the Infuriated
man.
From the story of eye-witnesses, Ma
honey was the aggressor throughout and
used every endeavor to kin Shelly. That
he did not succeed Is regarded as miracu
lous. What caused the dead man to at
tempt tha life of his friend will not be
known until Shelly Is able to talk.

EMMA C. ENELUND, . a Swedish
woman, was -prevented from
drowning herself In the bay yes
terday by the prompt action of
Police Officer. Sol Sandman.
People whose business brought them to
Jackson-street wharf noticed the peculiar
actions of the woman before the officer
took her in charge and notified the police.
For some time Mrs. Enelund, who had
with her her seven-year-old daughter,
walked up and down near the end of the
pier in an excited manner. Several per
sons accosted her and asked her if she
was in trouble, but to none of them would
she vouchsafe a reply.
Soon after one of the freight steamers
pulled away from the wharf, the woman
took off her, hat and threw It into the
bay. A moment later she attempted to
divest herself of her clothing and calling
to her child to Join her, she walked to
the end of the wharf, and seemingly de
termined to plunge into the bay.' She
was seized by Sandman.
The officer had Mrs. Enelund and her
child removed to the Detention Hospital,
where she was examined by Drs. Rethers
and McGettigan as to her sanity. She
answered all questions In a rambling way
and it was evident from her manner that
the woman was demented.
Books on her person showed that Mrs.
Enelund had to her credit with the Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company
nearly $1600.

Immediately. The case against him was
prosecuted, by the attorney who had -se

Selbach. It Is claimed, sold $2000 worth
of property in Columbus and brought the
money West. He claimed that he was
bunkoed out of It In a gambling den In
Oregon.
â¢Dr. Selbach Is a radical member of an
anti-Catholic organization and cherishes
the hallucination' that he is constantly
being hounded' by Catholics. AC month
ago Selbach was arrested at Columbus
for an alleged attempt to defraud his
creditors, and. the prosecution found an
old statute under which he could have
been imprisoned for debt, but tho court
exercised clemency and he was released.
A telegram .from Columbus, O., Sel
bach's former home, is to the effect that
he practiced his profession in that city
thirty years or more. He is a member of
one of the oldest families there and for
a long time has been regarded as eccen
tric. He was twice arrested on lunacy
warrants growing, out of his uncalled-for
attacks on unoffending citizens. These
attacks occurred on the street. . Â«
ARRESTED FOR. LUNACY.
Selbach is a portly man about 56 years
of age.. He bad the appearance of being
somewhat' under the Influence of liquor
and Acknowledged that: he had been
drinking a little. He said he had no fear
that the mob would lynch him. He
charged Policeman' Herlihy with beating
him on. the face with his club while he
was handcuffed in the patrol wagon on
the way to the prison.
Herlihy. was a witness to the attack
upon the Sisters. He said there were
three of themâ Sisters Magdalene, Mar
guerite and Lorenzo of the German Do
minican Convent. They had Just crossed
the street, he said, when Selbach came
between them, seized hold of one and
shoved her so that she fell. He then de
liberately tore off the veil of ope of the
other Sisters. After being cared for at
the music store of Pommer-Ellers Com
pany and having recovered from the ex
citement caused by the unexpected at
tack vpon them, they proceeded on their
way To San Jose. ' Â¦
A. R. Pommer was a witness to the as
sault, and* a member of the firm of Bar

handed Policemanj Herlihy a card and
said he would appear as a witness. -
"I was. crossing the street and got be
tween them. One of them stepped on
my foot, hurting my corns, and I raised
my arm to push her aside. She slipped
and fell and one of the other sisters grab
bed hold of me. I put out my hand and
accidentally tore her bonnet or veil. Then
the policeman came and arrested me.
"I arrived here from Columbus, Ohio,

His face was covered with blood and

been washed away he was asked why he
had attacked the sisters, and he denied
having done so. . He said:

the crowd yelled "Lynch him!" "Hang
him!" "Kill him!"
Those who were within reach struck
him and kicked at him, and those in
the rear, anxious to do likewise, were
prevented from doing so by two police
men who Joined Herlihy in the defense of
In the meantime a large crowd had col
lected about Selbach and Policeman Her
lihy. The news of the assault spread rap
idly, and the crowd quickly grew from a
small knot of people to a howling mob.
Eight in the center of it Selbach strug
gled with the policemanâ dodging as best
be could the perfect avalanche of fists
that came upon him from all directions
despite the efforts of the policeman. Down
Third Street he was dragged, the crowd
following, and when the policeman made
a stand at the patrol box the crowd
charged still closer and endeavored to
tear the prisoner from the grip of his
captor.
The assault occurred at a time when
Market street, at its junction with Third
and Kearny, was crowded. The nuns,
who were en route to San Jose, were
waiting for a car to take them to the
Third-Etrect depot. They were walking
toward the middle of the street when
Selbach met them. Without uttering a
word he brutally shoved one of the black
robed women and she fell to the cobble
stones. She was Bister Marguerite, and
ss she fell Selbach turned and grabbed
the veil of Sister Lorenzo, tearing it from
her head. Before he had time to lay
hands upon Sister Magdalene, the other
nun, he was seized by Patrolman P. N.
Herlihy. who, as soon as he saw the
drunken man shove Sister Marguerite,
rushed from where he was standing and
seized SeJbach.
Others had witnessed the assault and
they, too, rushed to the spot. Their first
care was the nuns, ar.d these they escort
ed to the music store of Pommer-Eilers
Company, at (S3 Market street, where
they were cared for.
STREET CROWDED.
THE angry cry of a mob clamoring
for vengeance was heard on Mar

afternoon, shortly after 4 o'clock.
"Lynch him: Lynch him!" shout
ed the mob. aroused by the spectacle of a
burly, drink-crazed man brutally assault
ing three defenseless nuns wearing the
black and white robes of the Dominican

VF. H. Selbach. a Jentist of Columbus,
Ohio. Neither of the Fisters, all three of
whom were from the German Dominican
Convent, on Guerrero street, near Twen

ly beaten, some of the angry pedestrians
who witnessed the assault having man
aped to reach his face with fists driven

The Nevada Bank passed the check to

Crocker-Woolworth Bank recognized the
paper and gave credit for it. The court
cays that the governing principle in such
cases where the transacting parties are
equally innocent of wrong- is to leave the
burden of error on the shoulders of those
on whom it has been placed unless one
of the contracting parties ought naturally
to secure redress in a court of equity. In

and an appeal was taken by the opposing
litigants to the State's highest tribunal.
The Supreme Court says that there was
no conspiracy between Becker arid the
Nevada Bank and that therefore the in
stitution's officials acted' in good' faith.
They simply paid the part of collecting
agent for their client.' -Â¦*â¢Â¦' â¢
The wily manipulators of fraudulent
checks were captured in different parts
of the country,, but only a little of the
"swag", was ever forthcoming. Then
there was some little difference of â¢ opin
ion as to who should stand the loss of
the $20,000. The Bank of Woodland was
on hand with the original $12, but that did
not relieve the situation to any consider
able extent. The officials of the Crocker-
Wool worth- National Bank told the of
ficials of the Nevada Bank that the peb
for their mistakes. The Nevada Bank's
pie who cashed false checks should' settle
directors had another view. Then the dis
pute was in the courts. ,
From the Clearing-house the false check
went to the Crocker- Woolworth Bank for
collection. The last named institution ac
cepted the $12 piece of paper and gave re
turns for $22,000 to the Clearing-house.
On January 3. 1S96, the check was sent
to the Bank of Woodland, and next day
word came back that something had gone
wrong. Then the" man-hunters were put
to work for the purpose of landing the
clever felons, behind the bafs and recov
ering as much as might remain of the
stolen money. - % â .- .Â¦
The officials of the Nevada Bank after
accepting the paper turned It over to the
Clearing-house, in which both the Crock
er-Woolworth Bank and Itself were inter
ested. On the following day Dean again
visited the Nevada Bank and drew $20,000.
Shortly afterward the "gang was tearing
off the miles on an express train to the
East- . .
CRIME IS SUCCESSFUL.
Of Becker's modus operandi little is
known except In regard to the materials
he used. His entire outfit was said to
have consisted of a supply of aniline
dyes, a darning needle, a pocketknife and
seme paper similar to that of which the
check was manufactured.
After eight days of delicate toll op the
fateful slip of paper Becker announced
to his confederates "that the Job was done.
The check now bore the date of Decem
ber 13 and instead of $12 it called for $22,
000. Back through Creegan it went to
Dean, who Had established a banking
credit and who had been selected to pass
the fraudulent paper at the start.
On the morning of December 17 Dean
wrote his pseudonym across the back of
the check and walked coolly into the Ne
vada Bank, where he made a deposit of
the purported $22,000. He was given "pro
visional credit'" in his passbook for the
amount and went away to Join his "pals."
A check for so large an amount is al
ways given the closest possible scrutiny
In all financial institutions of any stand
ing, but Becker's work was flawless.
Handwriting experts with microscopes
and acids were subsequently baffled in
their attempts to find out how it was all
done. A confession of the crime finally
made it plain.
On December 9. 1835, the Bank of Wood
land, Yolo County, issued a draft on the
Crocker- Woolworth Bank of this city for
the 6um of $12 on the order of A. H. Dean.
The last named had previously established
an account with the Nevada Bank of this
city and had about $2000 on deposit. After
securing the draft from the country bank
Dean gave it to Creegan, known through
out the transaction as the "middleman,"
and the last named handed it over to
Becker, who was the pen expert of the
gang.
CHEC-I IS PASSED.
The story of the achievement of the
Becker-Creegan gang is one -of the most
remarkable chronicles in the , American
Bankers' Association's annals of crime.
80 adept were the thieve* that their bold
deed was not discovered until nearly
three weeks after its commission. Then
they were far away. The Pinkertons were
immediately given the scent, and before
five -months had passed the criminals were
all run to earth. In short order the cases
were in the courts. After various delays
of one kind and another a suspect was
set free, one accomplice turned State's
evidence and was released and the re
maining two felons were consigned to the
penitentiary.
In the fall of 1S95 A. H. Dean, alias
Frank Seaver, began to make the ac
quaintance of banking people in this
State. He established a credit in several
Institutions and was ready for work.
Charles Becker, James Creegan and Jo
seph McCloskey. who was accused of
having been implicated in the crime but
who was subsequently acquitted of the
charge of being an accomplice, had not
up to that time appeared on the scene.
The Supreme Court added the last chap
ter yesterday to the story of' the famous
Becker forgery by declaring that the
Crocker-Woolworth National Bank must
stand the loss of the $20,000 which the
brace of skillful draft manipulators se
cured by their daring deed. The Nevada
Bank, which cashed the draft. Is held to
have been In no way financially responsi
ble, for the success of the sensational fel
ony. The last of the bold quartet who
forged their way to a fortune has nearly
completed his sentence, and thus the inci
dent is closed.
Justice Is Administered to Part \ of

of Fraudulent
Checks.

In order to provide a satisfactory buoy
for the Kearsarge the royal yacht moved
this afternoon ,to another position, her
place being occupied by Admiral Cotton's
flagship.
Another honor which was commented
on. by the American visitors was the ac
tion of Admiral Hotham In permitting
the use of the royal gangway during the
afternoon's reception, which was attend
ed by 2000 persons.
"We have' been killed with kindness,"
said Captain Hemphill. "Our reception
could not have been better In any shape
or form. It ie impossible to express our
appreciation of the courtesies shown us
and we are deeply indebted, especially to
Admiral Sir Charles F. Hotham, com
roand-in-chief at Portsmouth; Captain
Arbuthnol, and Captain Sir Archibald
Milne."
Admiral Cotton and the other American
officers gave Captain Hemphill all the
honor for the part played by the (Kear
sarge, whose presence contributed in such
a remarkable degree to the success of the
visit. \ .
"Our reception in England has been
most cordial and enthusiastic," said Rear
Admiral Cotton.. "Nothing could exceed
the. courtesy extended to us on all sides,
from the King and Prince of Wales, the
officials of the .Government and officers
of the army and navy, to "the people of
London and Portsmouth. I have no doubt
that the result of the visit of the Ameri
can squadron will prove beneficial in the
extreme and that it will tend to strength
en the cordial relations which have long
existed between the two countries."
Admiral Cotton is highly gratified at
the receipt of a photograph of the Prince
of . - Wales, bearing the inscription,
"George, Portsmouth, July J3, 1903."

THE REV. ALEXANDER MAZ
ZETTI, HONORED AT SANTA
CLARA COLLEGE.
WASHINGTON, July 14.â It is estimat
ed that 1500 tons of coal will brine the
Kearsarge across at 13^i knots an. hour,
within ten days, provided good weather
shall be encountered. The Kearsarge
made a very remarkable record in the
trip across to Kiel from New York. In
deed for her type and tonnage this rec
ord was the best ever made. The total
distance across, 3345 miles from New
York to The Needles, was run at the high
speed of 16.62 miles an hour. The trip
was made without a stop, the speed run
ning up in the last days of the voyage to
14.51 to 15.05 knots per hour.
In order that the Kearsarge may re
main at Portsmouth throughout the fes
tivities -she will not leave for Frenchmans
Bay until July 17- The North Atlantic
battle fleet left the Azores for the Maine
coast to-day.
The Kearsarge left the jetty to-night
and anchored in midstream, preparatory
to coaling to-morrow.
By the route that Captain Hemphill has
selected for a speed trial the Kearsarge
must steajn 2S52 miles. On . her way to
Southampton she made 3245 miles. She is
thus expected . to take less time on her
coming voyage. Captain Hemphill com
manded the Buffalo, which established
the record of thirty-nine days on the run
from New York to Manila, and the. offi
cers of the Kearsarge are satisfied that
with the excellent coal supplied and the
â¢vessel's moderately clean bottom the rec
ord for a battleship will be broken.
PORTSMOUTH, England, July 14.â
Captain Hemphill of the United States
battleship Kearsarge received instructions
to-day to clear ' the warship's propellors,
fill her bunkers with, the best coal/ and
go at the highest speed, with natural
draught, to Frenchmans Bay. This iÂ» the
first occasion in time o' peace that an
American | battleship â¢ has been subjected
to such a severe test. It recalls a similar
voyage of the battleship Oregon during
the war with Spain. . . Â¦
Divers commenced work this morning
cleaning the propellors and 1500 tons of
coal will be stored to-morrow. Captain
Hemphill will follow the . Great Circle
route, leaving Portsmouth at 9 o'clock
Friday morning.
Captain Hemphill Expects to

College. He has been fifty years
in the priesthood of the Jesuit or
der, twenty-one of which he has spent in
the Santa Clara Mission. He is now as
sistant to the Rev. A. V. Raggio, the
parish priest. .Father Mazetti was born
in the Isle of Lirl, May 17, 1834, and is
therefore almost seventy years of age.
He studied with the Jesuits at Arplno, the

dained to the priesthood. There he re
manled for some years, when he went to
Georgetown, Demarara, as a missionary.
There he spent several years, part of
which time he was pastor of one of the
leading parishes. He then went to Eng
land, where he served as pastor for a
number of years. From there he paid a
visit to the Holy Land. In 1882 he came
to California, coming direct to Santa
Clara College.
At the high mass this morning Father
Mazettl officiated. A banquet was served
in his honor in the college dining-room,
which was elaborately decorated with
white and gold, pillars at the corners of
the table supporting a canopy and fes
toons of twisted white and gold. At the
conclusion of the dinner a programme of
literary exercises was given as follows:
Introduction, C. A. Buckley; "The Rosary
of Religious Years" (Latin poem). Father
J. Malone; *\A Crown Not Earthly"

Father A. M. Coltelli; "Susclpe" (vocal
solo), F. Rossetti; "The Triumph of. the
Just" (Italian Poem), W. M. Boland;
closing words. Father J. Sasia.
The celebration was of a highly relig
ious character and was attended only by
members of the priesthood and intimate
friends of the clergyman. Many other
Jesuit priests were in attendance during
the day. It was an enjoyable reunion for
the aged priest and highest honors were
paid him. This evening a solemn bene

shark,' who makes a large income by ad
vancing small amounts at exorbitant
rates of Interest to employes of the mu

BANNAN'S ADMISSIONS.
"On or abont April 18. 1003, Mayor
Srhmld sent for me, which sum
mons I Immediately complied with.
On arriving: at the Mayor's office I
found the brother Â¦ of ..Lieutenant
Bannan waiting. In the - ante-room.
Mayor Schmltt took me at once Into
his Inner office and told rp" he de
sired information concefiTraK the
questions to be naked at the exam
ination to be held for captains. I
thereupon care to the Mavor the
â¢Â¦cope of the questions sent by Holla
V. Watt to Secretary Moron for the
guidance of the Civil Service Com
mission and then the Mayor called
in the said brother of Lieutenant
Bannan' and told -me to do all I
could for his friend Ilannan. Â«
"Thereupon the Mayor sent for his
stenographer and told him to strike
off several copies of the scope of
questions I had Just given him
aforesaid and cautioned the said
stenographer not to let any one see
It. When shortly.'tberenfter the said
stenographer- returned- the Mayor
handed one of the copies given him
by the stenographer to-said Bannan
and kept one himself and returned
to me the said original." .
Merchon admits that he was culpable
of betraying the nature of the questions
in so far as to become intoxicated in the
saloon of J. McNamara at 117 City Hall
avenue and leave his overcoat containing
the list of proposed questions there, which
it is claimed were extracted from â¢ his
pocket and communicated to certain
members of the Fire Department who
were candidates for promotion. But he
also alleges that Mayor Schmitz and his
brother Frank deliberately betrayed *to
outsiders this list of questions which he
furnished to them at their request. In
his allegations concerning Mayor Schmitz,
Mershon in his affidavit says:
INVOLVES THE MAYOR.
this week, it will take up the
scandal In the Civil Service Commission,
in which Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz and
his brother, Frank Schmitz, have been
involved through an affidavit made by
the former president of thf nmmisslon,
James R. T. Mershon, the i rations in
which have been confirmed â¢ Â¦> affidavits
and statements made by o r parties.
Speaking of the proposed Â» .vestigation
yesterday. Captain W^ J. Bryan, foreman
of the Grand Jury, said:
"We have about completed our labors
and expect to be discharged within the
next week or ten days, but If the matter
of the Civil Service Commission scandal
is brought to our notice we shall make
an Investigation of it."
District Attorney By ington said:
"We are to. hold a special meeting to
morrow night to examine witnesses in the
Epplnger case, and I believe we can con
clude that matter this week. Immedi
ately following this I shall present to the
Grand Jury the facts In the Civil Ser
vice Commission scandal in so. far as I
am Informed of them, and it will then
rest with that body to determine what
action It will take regarding the affair."
The affidavit made by the former presi
dent of . the commission, Janies R. T.
Mershon, charges Mayor Eugene E.
Schmitz and his brother, Frank Schmitz.
with furnishing to outsids parties infor
mation retarding the nature of the ques
tions that were to be asked candidates
for promotion and admission to the Fire
Department during the 'examination by
the Civil Service Commission.
AS eoon as the Grand Jury shall
have- disposed of the Epplnger
case, the investigation of which
it is thought will be completed
"That is about the Rlxe of it, if
yon force me," he answered. "I
cannot afford to be a, : squealer on
the Mayor."
Mershon stated in an interview that
at no time or place did he ever have a
conversation with Bannan regarding cer
tain captains whose papers were Bald to
be irregular, or that he was ever re
quested by Mayor Schmitz to furnish to
Bannan the names of these alleged Cap
tains. He reiterated his charges. made In
the affidavit regarding his visit to the
Mayor's office and the furnishing of ques
tions for Bannan's use, and said that^his
was the only occasion that he ever met
Bannan in relation to matters pertaining
to the Fire Department. Â¦ Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦
"Then you are vrlfUnnr to |jo on

self?" he was nuked.
"Yon eniisrlit me anmrnrm the

matter of the Mayor Klvlns: me those
questions and I now wish to nitli
drnw all the admissions I made to
you at that time." .
"But It's too late now to f withdraw
them," he was told. "You made them,
and the only thing for you to do when
you are called upon to testify is to telr
the truth."
. "Well. I can't do It and I won't,"
he answered. "If yon aprlne thin
thlnpr I will swear It Is not so. I
will ro on the stand and testify that
the only conversation I ever had
with the Mayor in which Mershon

asked Mershon for a list of those
who had passed the examination for
captains. I will swear that I loaned
these men money to buy their new
uniforms and that I .was advised
that the examinations were irregu
lar and that the papers of some, of
them were to be thrown ontt that I
asked Mershon for a list of these,
which he refnsed to crlve me, and
that I then -went to the Mayor, 'who
sent for Mershon and requested him
to furnish me -with the list, which
he did."

Two days later Bannan. sought this
same representative of The Call and eald
to him:
"Thofte ntatementN are true, all

say that I squealed."
On June 13 of the present year a rep
resentative of The Call, to whom was
known the contents of Mershon's affidavit,
met Thomas F. Bannan and related to
him that portion of it quoted above re
lating to Bannan's presence in the office
of the Mayor on or about April 18, 1903,
and the -receipt by him from the Mayor
of the list of questions. At that time he
said: r

The Moat House murder, as It was
known, was. committed more than four
years ago and hope of solving the mys
tery had almost been given up when the
body of the victim. Miss Holland; was
found last April buried in . the Moat
House grounds.
Miss, Holland was the owner of Moat
House. About four years, ago Dougal,
who was supposed to be her husband, but
who. It was discovered subsequently, had
never been married to her,' made his ap
pearance there, and Miss Dougal, sup
posed to be. his sister, took up her resi
dence on the place. Mies Holland disap
peared suddenly and Dougal sued the
woman supposed to be his sister,- but who
really was his wife, for^dlvorce. This
aroused suspicion and, led to an Investi
gation. Dougal was arrested for cashing
a check purporting to have been signed
by Miss Holland and while he was in
custody the body' of v Mlss Holland, for
which a thorough but unsuccessful search
had been made, was' accidentally s found
by a Â¦ laborer. In' an old ditch which had
been planted over by a shrub nearly four
years previously." The laborer struck his
fork Into a hard substance, which. proved
to be a shoe containing a woman's foot.
.Then Miss Holland's body was; found ly
ing face downward. : ; An , examination
showed that the â¢ head had been pierced
By a 'bullet, which was found In the skull.
Dougal was. suspected of having made
away with at least five wives. ...
LONDON, I July 14.-Samuel Herbert
Dougal, the perpetrator of the Moat
House murder, who was convicted at the
Chelmeford Assizes June 23 of the kill
ing of Miss Camille Cecile Holland at
Saffron-Walden, Essex, and sentenced to
death, was hanged at the Chelmsford jail
at 8 o'clock this morning, after making a
full confession of his crime.
SAN QUENTIN. July 14.-Wlth an in
ane grin and a display of composure that
savored palpably of mental vacuity
physical helplessness. Frederick S C.
Fischer died on the gallows at the prison
to-day. Fischer stepped briskly up the
stairway to the platform from which he
was to drop ,to/death. and gazed about
him with a' seeming sense of Interest In
the presence of the 200 persons who had
assembled to see him die. He did not
speak, because the Warden had advised
him not to do so. but he indicated clearly
his willingness to pay the law's penalty
for the atrocious murder of his unoffend
ing wife at Riverside a few months ago.
The condemned man was visited the
nfght before the execution by George
Montgomery Bulla of the ' Salvation
Army and the Rev. A. W. Detinett. To
them he said he had killed his wife be
cause he believed she would enjoy greater
happiness beyond the grave and that he
rejoiced In the prospect of joining her In
a short time.*
-Â¦ Sheriff Â¦' Coburn of. Riverside, the officer
who saved Fischer from a mob,, called on
the prisoner early this morning and ob
tained from him a confession of crime.
Fischer told Coburn that he had served
terms in the Sing Sing and Joliet peniten
tiaries for robbery and that he; was a
criminal â¢ at heart. He spoke without .re
aerveof his earlier crimes and made no
effort to conceal from his visitor the tact
that' he deliberately murdered his wife
and attempted to burn her body.
Fischer stood on the gallows trap at
10:36 o'clock. He was accompanied by
Warden Agulrre and a couple of deputies.
The officers of the prison lost no time in
adjusting the straps,, and almost before
the spectators were . aware the black cap
had been drawn, over the head of the
doomed; murderer, the; knot had been
made tight around his neck, the Warden's
hand! was In the air and young Fischer's
life was ended. - He was on the trap
twenty-nine seconds.~^Â£ra(Â£JBK

Fischer left a number of letters, all
written In a religious vein. He mentions
in one that he possessed 65 cents when he
entered the prison and desired that It be
used for the purchase of tracts suitable to
the spiritual welfare of condemned men.

FOLLOWING the reports of the secret confer
ence of high Russian officials at Port Arthur
comes the announcement that the Russian Gov
ernment has informed China that she is compelled to
exclude foreigners from Manchuria and to postpone
the opening of the Manchurian ports for six years.
By way of explaining why she is "compelled" to
take that course Russia asserts that there are in Man
churia a number of Americans and British "who in
disguise are engaged in espionage." *
The reason is hardly valid. If Russia were ful
filling her obligations in Manchuria neither Ameri
cans nor British would have to go about the coun
try in disguise, and if they did their espionage
would discover nothing of which the Russian Gov
ernment need be ashamed. The reason assigned for
the action, however, amounts to nothing. Sterne
once said that when a minister had made up his
mind what to preach about, ''Egypt, Â¦ Mesopotamia
and Cappadocia" was as good a text as any. By
parity of reasoning when a strong Government has
made up its mind what to do toward a weak one,
then one excuse for action is as good as another.
Russia intends to keep Manchuria. She has un
dertaken and virtually achieved the conquest by ob
taining concessions for a railway and for a bank. It
is asserted that through the railway and the bank
together she has brought about the investment of
upward of $250,000,000 of Russian money, in the
province. The statement is undoubtedly an exag
geration, for the railway has been cheaply built and
the bank has not promoted any very costly entcr-

KANSAS is reported to have a wheat crop
whereof neither history nor romance fur
nishes a parallel. Some authorities say there
are 6,000,000 acres of golden grain ripening beneath
her skies. Other stories make no report of acreage,
but assert that the Kansas breezes are blowing over
fields that have $65,000,000 worth of wheat in sight.
Other stories are even more interesting. They deal
not with the magnitude nor the value of the crop, but
with the mighty struggle of the farmers in their ef
forts to get it harvested.
One report says that every man, woman and child
in the State between the ages of 15 and 70 is liable to
be. conscripted to work in the harvest fields. There is
a tale that a railway train traversing one of the most
bountiful districts of the wheat area was held up by
embattled farmers and every male passenger com
pelled to get out and go to work as a harvester.^ An
other story runs to the effect that the farmers of an
interior county procured a trainload of workers in St.
Louis and shipped them locked in cars and under
close guard to prevent the border counties from
seizing them in transit. Still another report narrates
that all Justices of the Peace in Missouri, Arkansas
and Nebraska have been petitioned to sentence all
vagrants brought before them to two weeks in Kan
sas or a tine of $50. ;
Probably some of the stories :. are. not historically
accurate, but they are near enough the truth to im
press the public with the greatness of the Kansas
wheat crop and the scarcity of the Kansas harvest
hand.. They also suggest new fields of glorious ro
mance for our writers of fiction. It is said that in
many of the counties the work of harvesting has been
carried on by the light of the moon and the stars, be
cause the sun after ' ripening the wheat does not
shine long enough to permit harvesting it.
There is a tradition that a man named Carter once
raised in these United States a crop of oats so heavy
that he could not stack them on the field they were
grown on. He was a great 'man in his time, but he
will now have to go way back and be buried, for the
world has no longer any use for him. .Even the most
unfortunate of Kansas farmers this year seems to
have more wheat than Carter had oats, and a good
deal harder time than Carter had in getting his crop
harvested. â¢ /'v-'^.vK

In addition to what has been already undertaken
the I^urier Ministry has now under consideration a
project for constructing a transcontinental line from
Moncton, New Brunswick, to Port Simpson, or Bute
Inlet, on the Pacific Ocean. The road will be about
,3500 miles long and will be virtually divided into two
sections, the one east and the other west of Winni
peg. A report of the plan proposed for constructing
the line says: "The 2000 miles or so from Moncton
?o Winnipeg would be built directly by the Govern
ment and leased to the newly chartered Grand
Trunk Pacific Company for fifty years, at 3 per cent
on the cost of say $50,000,000. Seventy-five per cent
of the cost of the 1500 miles west of Winnipeg would
be paid by the Government, and this portion owned
by the Grand Trunk Pacific Company. As the terms
would provide that all parts of the road should revert
to the Government if the Grand Trunk Pacific Com
pany should fail to keep its engagements, the whole
thing may be treated of, for the present, as a Gov
ernment railway project"
Three objects are to be attained by the construc
tion of the projected line. First, it will open up to
settlement a rich, new country that is bound to at
tract a desirable population; second, it will provide
p meant of conducting the traffic of the Northwest
through the cities and ports of Eastern Canada in
steid of leaving it to seek an outlet through the
United States; third, it will give Canada a military
strategic line about 500 miles north of the American
frontier, Finally, it is believed the line will be a
paying investment for the Government There ap
pears to be no doubt that Parliament will approve
*he plan, and Canada will take another long step
toward her development .as a nation
Canadian statesmen are well aware of the needs of
their western territory and have entered with vigor
upon the task of supplying them. In a recent de
bate in Parliament the representatives of the western
provinces declared their constituents had lost in 1002
upward of Sio.ooo.ooo because of a lack of transpor
tation, and thnt because of the lack the prices paid
to the farmers for wheat had been depressed from
seven to seventeen cents a bushel. The Government
has undertaken to provide a remedy. A recent re
port from Ottawa says: "To meet the need the
Canadian Pacific Railway is exerting itself; the
Government has aided with its credit 720 miles of ex
tensions of the Canadian Northern, to Prince Albert
and to Edmonton, respectively, about 450 miles and
800 miles northwest of Winnipeg, and both on the
North Saskatchewan River."
CANADA has taken stock of her immigrants
during the fiscal year that ended June 30 and
has found that she received 124.658 persons
to swell her population. The figures are not large
when compared with the enormous immigration to
this country, but they are none the less considerable
when estimated from a Canadian standpoint. In fact,
the increase of our population by immigration dur
ing the year was something less than 1 per cent,
while the Canadian increase in that way amounts to
very nearly 2^2 per cent
In one respect the Canadians have a decided ad
vantage over us in the matter, for her immigration is
of a wholly desirable character and is made up of
elements that can be easily assimilated by the ex
isting population. Thus of the total number of im
migrants for the year no less than 43>98o were from
the United States and 41,787 were from the British
islands. All of those are of course virtually the kins
men of the Canadian natives, being of the same race
and with ample experience in the forms of self-gov
ernment that prevail in the Canadian provinces.
They can therefore be readily absorbed into the so
cial and political structure of the communities where
they settle, and in a few years will not be distinguish
able from the natives. Even the 23,732 immigrants
who have migrated to Canada from Continental Eu
rope will be found a welcome addition to the country,
for most of them came from Northern Europe and
are either German*. Scandinavians or Finns. Con
siderable colonies of those races are already settled
in the northwestern provinces and have been for the
most part successful ar,d prosperous.
The one difficulty in the way of assuring the pros
perity of the new comers is that of providing prompt
and cheap transportation between the remote prov
inces and the markets of the world. It is stated that
last year the farmers of Manitoba alone produced
100.000.000 bushels of grain. 3.500.000 bushels of pota
toes and a l'.rgc quantity of other farm products, the
tot2l crops having an aggregate value of upward of
$75,000,000. To get that product to market severely
taxes the existing railroads, and it will be impossible
to successfully open up new regions for cultivation
antil a larger transportation system has been pro
vided.
CANADIAN PROGRESS.
PERSONAL MENTION.
The bridge when completed will contain
14,000 cubic yards of concreteâ each cubic
yard of which is computed to weigh a
ton and a halfâ and will comprise ten
huge arches. Eight of these arches will
have a clear span of 86 feet each and rest
on solid bases 14x28 feet. At each end of
the first of this year upon some
thing unique in the bridge building lineâ
the construction of an enormous viaduct,
a fifth of a mile long and seventy fe'et
high, entirely of concrete.
This structure, which will be the larg
est of its kind in the world, was designed
by Henry Haw-good, chief of the San Pe
dro, Los Angeles and Salt LakÂ§ Rail
road's engineering department. .It was
because of inability to obtain structural
steel, all of # the large companies being
months behind with their orders, that the
necessity for the construction of a bridge
across the Santa Ana River for the pas
sage of the Salt Lake trains from Los
Angeles to Riverside became pressing.
Hawgood, when casting about for a sub
stitute, was led to make use of some con
structive Ideas of his own. He Immedi
ately set about working out the entire
plan, and his specifications are being fol
lowed to the minutest detail.
POMONA. July 14.â Away down oc
the edge of Riverside County a
couple of hundred workmen have
been busily engaged ever since
to force out the water while the foun
dations were being constructed. Each
footing supports a weight of 500 tons Ir
respective of its arch, and the trches
will contain S30 cubic yards of concrete.
Accordingly It Is evident that the mat
ter of a common freight train, made up
of an engine and fifteen cars. Is a mere
feather-weight, the bridge being built for
supporting 1 an untold tonnage.
The greatest care has been taken In
preparing and mixing the composite ma
terialâbroken stone, sand and cementâ
of the concrete used In the bridge con
struction. A big steam mixing plant Is
the important factor in this work. Sev
eral hundred carloads of the broken stone
âa clean white rock, dirt freeâ and sand
from the river bed. which is run through
a washing process to free it of silt, to
gether with the best tested cement, are
being used. .
This enormous concrete viaduct pnoba
bly will not be completed for some weeks,
although the workmen are laboring dili
gently and constantly In day and night
shifts, electric arcs having been placed
along the bridge to light the night. It
will cost between $250,000 and $500,000.
When completed this viaduct will mean
much to the Salt Lake company, as It
will afford its trains a direct passage
from Los Angeles to Riverside by way of
Pomona and Ontario, through a rich
country p.nd over as finely a ballasted,
well graded and smooth a railroad bed
as can be found in this country.
KENTUCKY has Jong held the center of the
stage by sensational homicides and the antics
of Cassius M. Clay. The old man married a
young girl and practically imprisoned her in his
home, which is a fortress. His children wanted to
protest, but shooting was the penalty of that pastime
of. young folks whose old and doddering daddies
marry. The affair ended in the escape of the young
prisoner, her divorce and marriage to a fearless Ken
tuckian of her own age, who went around with guns
and ammunition enough on him to equip a militia
company.
The deserted husband was over oo when this blow
struck his vernal and juvenile affections, and since
then he has been the terror of the neighborhood.
Recently he ordered two doctors to treat him, and
when they came threatened to kill them both if they
entered the house. No such ancient, picturesque,
bloodthirsty person is at present on exhibition in any
other State. He is a Kentucky product entirely and
intends to end his life as he began it, fighting every
thing in sight.
Between him and the feuds of Breathitt County
Kentucky revels in sensations nearly as sustaining
as her widely known and justly celebrated mint
juleps. But Indiana passes her. A Hoosier farmer,
a quiet citizen who had never done anything more
exciting than plow and sow and reap and mow, and
haul hoop poles and pumpkins to town and help the
old woman make apple butter, had some difficulty
with his son-in-law. It seems that the latter had
deserted his wife and baby and bragged about it, and
would pass his father-in-law's house expressing
opinions of the family that were not warranted by
the facts. The old man stood this several times and
then got his gun and shot the young man in the leg.
He was taken to a surgeon, who was just preparing
to amputate the injured member when the father-in
law appeared and applied an anesthetic by shooting
out all his brains as he lay on the operating table.
At this distance from the stirring scene we refrain
from passing upon the merits of the case, but we can
without offense or interfering with the course of
justice commend the old chap for the thoroughness of
his work. Of course he must answer to the surgeon,
who whetted his knife and filed his saw for nothing,
since it was no use to amputate the leg of a patient
who had already had his head shot off. Kentucky
has not yet produced anything quite that brisk.
KENTUCKY LAURELS IN DANGER
Dr. Wiley, the chemist of the Department of Agri
culture, has found adulterations so common . in all
kinds of food stuffs that he advises people to live
mainly on bread and butter, but it is doubtful if he
would guarantee the purity even of those nursery
articles.

It is evident that we are entering upon a final and
distressing phase of the negro question. Always
where two peoples are in contact and equal before
the law, and one is treated as unequal, subordinate,
subject and inferior, it is sure to pass into perma
nent slavery, or to assert itself by a bloody out
break. Which will it be in the case of the Southern
negroes? Peonage will not solve the problem, nor
will disfranchisement nor other form of subordina
tion. It is time that the thinking and thoughtful
people of both sections got together on the subject.
There is no denying that a reaction is on in the
South, and the tendency there toward re-enslaving
the negro is so plain as to be noticed by the most
casual observer, and so strong as to already require
judicial restraint. It is a daily, almost hourly, occur
rence throughout the South, and even in Washington
City, for a white man to order a negro, who is not
in his service, over whom he has no lawful control
and to whom he pays nothing, to perform for him
some personal or menial task. The order is almost
always garnished with an oath and a vile epithet.
This practice is common. Young white men and
youths are especially given to it. They domineer
over negroes whom they never saw before. Often
when the black man refuses the service to which the
white had no right to command him he is struck or
kicked. If he resent this treatment a lynching is
brewed at once.
These things are not stated in a spirit of criticism
or to make sectional capital, but as facts of constant
occurrence. They show the growing' belief in the
South that the negro owes subordination and servi
tude to the white, and has no right to own himself,
his service, his liberty of action. He is expected and
commanded to uncover his head and on all occasions
give way to the white man in situations where their
lawful rights are exactly equal. If he refuse, as a rule,
he is punished by a blow.
It is admitted that the Southern constitutions
which disfranchise the negro do not contravene the
suffrage amendment to the constitution. The Su
preme Court does not say so in words, but has dis
missed the Virginia suits on the ground that the issue
raised is political, and must be dealt with by Con
gress, the political branch of the Government. Hav
ing had the subtlety to successfully nullify the suf
frage amendment tc the constitution, it remains to be
seen whether the South can as successfully write out
of the constitution the amendment which abolished
slavery and forbids involuntary servitude, except for
the commission of crime.
WHEN the process of disfranchisement of the
negroes began in the Southern States The
Call gave in detail a statement of the prac
tice of compelling negroes to render involuntary ser
vice by going through the form of convicting
them of some offense against the law and then turn
ing them over to contractors, to be worked under the
lash in mines or on plantations.
We expressed the opinion that without the ballot
the negro would prove unable to protect himself
against that form of slavery. Now the ballot is taken
entirely out of his hands, and recent revelations in
Alabama and Mississippi show that in the process of
subjecting the negro to involuntary servitude, vir
tually to slavery, the judicial step is omitted. For
merly any one who wanted a slave would make a
charge against a likely one, procure his conviction
and take possession of him. Now, as proved in re
cent cases on trial before the State and Federal
courts, the victim is seized by force, usually well
whipped, and ordered to work under an overseer as
a slave.
The Southern papers have borrowed a word from
the Spanish to describe this practice, and call it
"peonage" instead of slavery. Under the peon sys
tem the debtor belongs to his creditor until he works
out the debt. But as the creditor keeps the books
and the debtor is poor and ignorant, the debt is never
worked out, but descends from parent to child
through generations, making a permanent system of
servitude.
Peonage is as obnoxious to our laws and morals
as if it were called slavery. No man has a right to
seize the body of another for debt. Formerly im
prisonment for debt was lawful here, :fs it was in Eng
land, but that is no longer permitted. To give the
body of the debtor to his creditor is a worse system
than slavery. The relation is one that permits none
of those humane contacts that were common be
tween master and slave. Peonage is slavery with the
patriarchal feature taken out. All the brutality of
giving one man the ownership and control of an
other is left, and all that softened the system and
made it tolerable is taken away.
Among the stories that come up from the peon
States it is said that the seizure of negro girls to be
held in a viler servitude than slavery is becoming
common, and it is expected that cases of this kind
will soon be before the courts. It is wise to re
strain comment on this blacker phase until it has
been judicially examined.
prises. Still- there can be no dotibt that a large
amount of Russian money has been invested in Man
churia, and it is the intention of the Government to
keep out every foreigner who would be likely to in
terfere with the profits Russia expects to make.
Â¦ The situation is irritating to Japan, to Great Brit
ain and to ourselves. Japan would doubtless fight
if she had a free hand, but the other powers prefer
to keep the peace. Russia, therefore, will in the end
have her way. She knows well how to turn aside
wrath by the soft lie. She has again and again as
sured the world that she intends to keep faith. Even
now her course is not arbitrary. She promises that
if the other powers will be good she will open the
Manchurian ports in six years. The promise will
please the diplomats. Meantime the mass of man
kind will write Manchuria down as a Russian prov
ince and cease to fret about it.

A case of a similar nature was also dis
missed by Judge Conlan. The defendant
was W. H. Revere, bookkeeper and col
lector for H F. Patrick, who has a livery
stable at Polk and Geary streets. He was
accused of the crime of robbery by Otto
Schultz, a master painter at 1S16 Filbert
street. Schultz charged Revere with
striking him and taking his gold watch
at Sutter and Larkln streets on the after
noon cf June 9.
The facts were that Revere was driving
along the west side of Larkln street to
ward the City Hall on the afternoon of
June 9. Schultz was driving in the oppo
site direction on the same side and col
lided with Revere, whose buggy was dam
aged. Schultz drove away and as soon as
he was able Revere drove after him and
caught up with him at Sutter and Larkln
streets. Revere told Schultz he had been
driving on the wrong elde of the street,
and wanted his name, so that he could
obtain compensation for the damage to
his buggy, but Schultz refused and want
ed to fight. Revere promptly knocked
him down and drove to the stable.
Schultz complained to Captain Martin
that Revere had assaulted him and robbed
him of his gold watch, and on June 15
swore to a warrant for Revere's arrest on
the charge of robbery. When 'the case
was called yesterday Schultz said he was
unable to identify Revere as the man
who had struck him and his attorney
asked that the case be dismissed. Attor
ney Frank Drury, who represented Re
vere, Insisted that the facts be made
known, so that his client would not buf
fer the stigma of being thought a robber
and the Judge heard Revere's statement.
After the case was dismissed Schultz's
attorney wanted a warrant for Revere's
arrest for battery, but the Judge de
clined to issue it. - -- .
The defendants' attorney wanted to put
en witnesses as to character, but the
Judge Baid it was not necessary. He
thought the complaining witness had been
actuated by motives of revenge In bring
ing the charge against the defendants, or
he was entirely wrong in his statement as
to what occurred. The defendants were
no more robbers, he said, than any one
within the presence of the court. They
were entirely exonerated, and the court
said it considered it a matter of regret
that they' had been arrested.
The charge of robbeTy ngalnst .Phillip
Phillips, conductor, and George P. Mc-
Carroll, gripmar. of the Ge-ary-street line,

ROBBERY CASES
ARE DISMISSED
HEARS BUNKER'S
REPORT OF WORK
No notice has been received from the
contractor that he has abandoned the
work. Axman has said that he has sent
north to Puget Sound to get mudscows to
Increase his outfit. Colonel Heuer has no
tified the War Department of what has
happened. '.
The contract price for doing the work
was J2&8.000. One clause in the contract
provided that progress must be made at
the minimum rate of 100,000 cubic yards
of dredged material per month to entitle
the contractor to payments. Axman be
gan upon the Job about four months ago.
According to the estimates of the Govern
ment engineers the total amount of ma
terial dredged out In that entire period is
less than 100,000 cubic cards, or 300,000
cubic yards short of what is necessary to
give Axman any pay. The withdrawal of
the dredger at this time will make it
harder to perform up to the monthly
average, dating from the time of begin
ning, than it was before the Interruption.
To catch up it will be necessary to put
on several dredgers, so engineers say.
The contract calls for the improvement
of San Pablo Bay by constructing a chan
nel between the Straits of Carquines and
the Golden Gate, off Point Pinole, Point
Wi'.son and Lone Tree Point, 300 feet 'wide
and thirty feet deep. The shoal to be
dredged is about five miles in length and
has a depth of nineteen feet at low water.
The mud removed from the bottom must
be deposited as near the Bouth shore line
as possible and impounded behind bulk
heads or dykes of suitable construction,
the dykes to be made by the contractor.
Axman began the dredging under the
terms of the contract. A dyke was con
structed for the Impounding of material
taken from the bottom to prevent It from
running back Into the stream. While Ax
man was not progressing at the average
monthly rate provided for In the contract
he proceeded steadily until in a spell of
bad weather a large portion of his dyke
was carried away by the action of the
waves. He continued to dredge, but the
Government would not permit him to go
on until the dyke was rebuilt.
The work of dredging through the shoal
in San Pablo Bay to provide for a deep
water channel to the Mare Island Navy
Yard ha* come to a sudden stop. ' Rudolf
Axman, the contractor who was making
the much needed channel for the Govern
ment, has withdrawn his dredging plant,
and there is nothing doing on the flat at
this time. Colonel Heuer, United States
engineer, has communicated with Mr.
Axman, but has received no definite as
surance whether the work will again pro
ceed under the Axman contract.
The Government Is entitled to declare
the contract forfeited under the adver
tised terms for the work, but has not yet
made any move in that direction. Axman
is In the position pf having performed a
great amount of work for which he haa
not received any money. Unless he con
cludes to go ahead he will not get any
money.

PRESIDENT APPROVES
SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL
Lieutenant McCarthy Is Betired in
Disgrace, Having Duplicated
His' Pay Accounts.
WASHINGTON. July 1.â The President
has approved the action of the court
martial in the case of Second Lieutenant
John F. McCarthy, Nineteenth Infantry,
recently stationed at Fort Leavenworth,
Kans. He was convicted of duplicating
his pay accounts and sentenced to be dis
missed from the army.
Â¦ Jn announcing the President's action.
"Secretary Root added the following mem
orandum: ; : .': â¢
The attention of the Secretary of War has
been drawn to numerous violations of the regu
lations governing the transfer and assignment
of pay accounts, especially by young officers,
who are not yet fully conversant with the re
quirements of army regulations In that regard.
The law and regulations are alike explicit In
respect to this practice and operate to deprive
of validity all transfers or assignments of
claims tor pay until the right thereto hu fully
accrued and the account becomes lawfully due
and payable. Young officers are reminded that
the avoidance of debt, a rigorous economy in
expenditures and a scrupulous regard for pecu
niary obligations are absolutely essential to
good standing In the military service, and de
partures from the standard of probity In that
respect will not be lightly regarded by tho
War Department.

SANTA BARBARA, July 14â Several
hundred people witnessed tho cor, tests
between the champion tennis players ot
the coast to-day on the Potter courts. At
yesterday's play, which was the first ot
the two weeks' series of the midsummer
tournament, some most sensational play-
Ing was witnessed and to-day Interest
centered In the battle between the tennis
champions, for which valuable trophies
are offered.
The yacht races, which were to havÂ«
been the main feature to-day, were post
poned because there was not sufficient
wind, a condition which local skippers de
clare to be the first time within their
recollections at this season. Indications
are favorable for a breeze to-morrow,
however, and the first try for the citi
zens' tophy and several other cups put uj>
by clubs and individuals will be made.
Races are scheduled for every day of the
two weeks' tournament. While the
yachts were unable to cover the coursa
to-day several races between smaller
craft were pulled off successfully.
In the open pleasure boat class Ariel Jr.
won first prize, making the course In onÂ«
hour and thirty-nine minutes. In thÂ«
fish-boat class Skipper won. Four
yachts crossed the line for the yacht cup
as follows: Katrina of Santa Monica. Ve
nus of San Pedro, Ariel of Santa" Barbara
and Daisy of Ventura. Half of the first
leg was made under favorable conditions,
all the boats being bunched, but the wind
died out before they reached the first
station. These same boats, together with
three others, will start to-morow.
The tennis play was as follows: Ladles'
singlesâ Miss Dobbins, Alhainbra, beat
Miss Garland. Nordhoff. 6-3, 6-4: Miss

DEER SEASON TO OPEN
IN THIS STATE TO-DAY
to Go to Mountains in Pur
suit of Big Game.
Sportsmen Are Making Preparations
The deer season will open In this State
to-day and the hearts of hundreds of
sportsmen will be made glad. The event
has been anxiously looked forward to by
numerous huntsmen throughout the State
and It will be a signal for them to take to
the wilds as fast as possible.
Many of the most prominent hunters In
this city have already left for the moun
tains in Medocino and Lake counties,
where deer are reported to be plentiful.
Others will wait for a few weeks ere
they start, but it Is safe to predict that
the district where the game Is to be found
will be thronged with sportsmen before
very long.
Reports from Lake and Mendodno coun
ties, the great deer districts, are to the
effect that the hunting will be excep
tionally good this year. The Country Club
and other prominent organizations have
already arranged for hunting trips and
large parties will soon be on the road to

NEW YORK. July 14.â Not a race but
a sail-stretching trial was the purpose of
to-day's spin of the two Shamrocks down
along the Jersey coast. Shamrock III
had just bent on a new suit of sails, with
Increased area afforded by her tallest
mast, and Designer Fife wanted to
stretch the new duck before a set race.
All the time the boats were out it looked
squally and for half an hour before tho
trial was abandoned the boats had a
windy thresh before a flfteen-knot breeze
that ironed the wrinkles In the sails. Sir
Thomas expects to give the boats a sail
over a set course to-morrow.

RUXS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
The game was one of those matter-of
fact, stereotyped sort of exhibitions
which are never known to arouse the en
thusiasm of the fan. From the first in
ning on it happened in the same old way,
and not a single exciting or interesting
play occurred to arouse the bleacherites
during the progress of the game.
\ The first Senatorial tally came In the
seventh.when a couple of hits by Shee
han and Graham brought in a run. Then
there was a lapse of activity till the
eighth, when the Senators began to tmich
up Hodson rather lively. Three consecutive
hits, a fly to right field by McLaughlin, a
steal by "Truck" Egan and a bad throw
to second by Tommy Leahy had their ef
fects and three Senators came sprinting
over the rubber. Â¦ Â¦
. The home team displayed a wonderful
faculty for- slumbering on the bags at
Oakland yesterday afternoon, and in con
sequence, when the time for making 1 runs
arrived, none of the players was there.
The Senators got busy enough to make
four, but had they been a little more
fleet of foot they could have accumulated
several more. '_.

BTAXDIXO OF THE CLUB3.
Claude got a great reception when he
came back to the stand and Jockey Daly
was yoked with a floral horseshoe. The
elder Daly carried the flowers up to the
grand stand, where women tore tho em
blem to pieces for bouquets.
Sir Gallant, which also was well liked,
jumped out In front at the fall of the flag
and got a- lead of five lengths. This he
kept until the far turn, where Claude,
which had been striding along easily, set
sail for the $3000 purse. Reservation
awakened, too. and when the field turned
Into the stretch it was a duel between
Claude and Reservation. Munro gave the
Hendrle horse a nice ride and 1 brought
him up to Claude's withers, but Johnny
Daly brought the whip down on his
father's candidate just twice and Claude
went under the wire a handy winner by
a length.
BUFFALO, N. Y., July 14.â The sixth

at Fort Erie to-day by M. J. Daly's
Claude, the Lissak colt, which has al
ready to his credit the California, St.
Louis and Cumberland Derbies and had
finished second In the great American
Derby, in. which he carried top weight.
Claude was well weighted in to-day's
race, his Impost being 127 pounds. An
early morning rain had made the track
muddy, but as all tracks look alike to the
Daly colt the bookmakers never laid bet
ter than 1 to 2 against him. The second
choice was ' William Hendrie's Reserva
tion, whose stronghold is mud, and many
played him to beat the horse with . the
Derby habit, thinking that the distance,
a mile and a quarter, was not enough for
Claude.

TOPEKA. Kans., July 14.â One squad of
Eastern college and high school students
which started from Topeka to the harvest
fields of Ness County yesterday failed to
reach the destination to which It was as
signed by the State employment director.
The train on which the students were
traveling reached the little town of Otis,
on the line between Barton and Rush
counties, this morning shortly after day
light. It was boarded there by a party of
wheat growers, who were determined to
have harvest hands at any cost. The
students were asleep, but the farmers
awoke them and asked their errand in
the country. When told that the men
were harvesters the farmers forced them
to leave the train. Several of the young
men were willing to get off at Otis, but
some of those who had promised the em
ployment director that they would go to
Ness County were determined to remain
on the train, and athletes among them
made It very interesting for the farmers
for a short time. The farmers fought to
eave their crops, and when the train
moved on the students, barely awakened
and badly disheveled, stood on the plat
form, willing to accept the fortune of war
and go to the harvest fields with their
determined employers.
None of the young men were hurt in
the contest, but several carried pieces of
car furniture which they had torn away
In an endeavor to stay on the train. Had
the young men understood Kansas condi
tions they would have reached their des
tination In Ness County without trouble
by telling the Otis farmers that they
were bound for the mountains and didn't
Intend to work In the harvest fields.
The average Kansas farmer believes he
haÂ« a light to use all of the available
labor he can find, and has no scruples
against using that which has been con
signed to his neighbor.

FARMERS KIDNAP
HARVEST HANDS
SAN RAFAEL.. July 14.â Even though
â¢"Dr." John DonaM Woods and Alice Cloy
Wood are fugitives from Justice, and as
jet no direct knowledge is known of
their whereabouts, several letters have
been received by different persons in
various cities throughout the United
Statrs from Mrs. Wood, telling of perse
cution ar..1 alleging that she is not guilty
of any crime. Heretofore these letters
have all been written to friends of the
Woo<is, but now a letter has been re
ceived by the authorities in San Rafael.
-We will fight now legally for justice
end reputation to the bitter end," says
Alice Cloy Wood. "If the people in Ma
rin County want us, J. C. Reed of At
lantic City will bring them to us."
District Attorney Boyd received the let
ter to-day from Mrs. Woods. It is a most
disconnected affair, replete with mis-
KpeSIed words and is almost devoid of
punctuation. It contains some very di
rect and startling allegations. Upon in
vestigation some of the allegations made
are found to be faJse. while others are
true. The letter on the whole gives many
polnti upon which the authorities can
work.
There is rerne question a? to whether
The letter was ever written by Mrs. Woods.
1; was dated at Atlantic City. N.' J.. on
July S and was posted in Jersey City
the jane day at 1:30 p. m. From informa
tion obtained from Chief of Police Sel
dridpe of the Eastern summer resort, the
Woods left there before that date. The
:â¢â¢.-..: :s written on legal size roanila pa
per ar.d is almost illegible, a? if it had
been written on board a train. In it
Mrs. 'A oods positively asserts that neither
she nor Dr. Woods are criminals, but
assert! they are "creatures of circum
s-tance? and not bad."
CALLS BEST "DECEIVER."
She further proclaims Colonel Best to
have been "a deceiver and not one de
ceived." She claims Colonel Best was
paid 5300 by Woods to get a divorce for
him in Denver, also that the man sup
posed to have been murdered never re
ceived any amount of money while* at
iheir home, but on the contrary borrow
ed money from them on March 31 in or
der to eo to San Francisco. Mrs. Woods
gives information which she claims if the
omcers will follow up will prove her as
sertions axe absolutely correct. She tells
of Colonel Best wanting to marry her and
Bay* she can substantiate this claim by
a letter and telegram from Colonel Best.
The letter is as follows:

OFFICERS INVESTIGATE
District Attorney Boyd has acted upon
Mrs. Woods' "instructions" and has de
tectives working upon various details
contained in the long epistle. Minnie
Maghetti was interrogated closely upon
all matters contained in the letter which
prrtained to her. To Detective de Pue
the girl stated that most of the things
claimed* in Mrs. Woods' letter and which
p.he was supposed to be posted upon were
false. Miss Maghetti, however, admitted
that Colonel Best did tell her he felt un
well on April 1 . and told her not to say
anything to Mm. Woods about It. In an
Interview to-night Dr. Jones said:
"No. I was not the first to minister to
Colonel Best. Dr. Woods did that before
I got there. I do not remember whether I
said to "Cut the brandy out" or not. I
do recall, however. Colonel Best telling
me he had a weakness of the heart about
two years prior, while in Colorado. He
did not tell me h* had evpr had apoplexy.
Woods told me that. Thin case is a most
extraordinary one. There are some ex
tremely peculiar features about the whole
matter. I cannot get head nor tail out of
It. Some things the Woods told me I
found out later to be absolutely false,
while since the expose I have learned
facts that might show the Woods to be
not as radically wrong as is presumed."
Robert Hickmott and his wife both ab
solutely deny that they even told Colonel
Best he looked ill. In an interview at his
home in Ross Valley to-night Mr. Hick
mott said:
"The assertion that we told Colonel
Best he looked ill is not true. He looked
the picture of health when we saw him on
the train. The Woods have been lying so
much all their lives that they must keep
it up now. The Woods., woman did tell me
she was more than a sister to Woods, but
explained it by saying he had been so
kind and noble to her during her befeave
ment All her other assertions are pal
pable lies."
District Attorney Boyd has wired to de
tectives in the East to look up John C.
Reed at Atlantic City. Through Reed the
whereabouts of the Woods . might - Be
found out. Mr. Boyd said to-night:
K. B. â Letters acknowledged Â¦ by Alfred and
Fumner Best to have been written by their
father proving he gave me the grip. The only
articles of his we have or know anything about
axe now In the hands of John C. Reed of At
lantic City. N. J- Ask the Hlckmotts If I did
not frequently make the assertion that Dr.
Woods was more than a brother to me. Auk
them if I did not tell them at once to investi
gate who 1 was if they were so anxious to
have known. We werÂ» so sorry we consentexl
to the colonel's deception and gave the story of
brother and eUter. but the colonel pleaded and
begged and said thev would hang him. Ask
the Hlckmotts and Minnie Maghetti if he did
not say he had my grandfather's and father's
will and lived across the street and nursed me
as a baby and had Dr. Woods on the Continent
with him. Ark Mr. Hickmott if be did not
tell him he was a Mason and thus secured a
private letter from Hickmott to learn the ee
cret*; then find if he was a Mason? Did we
make him lie in these things? I have learned
on Investigation the lodge he professed to be
long to never knew him as a Mason. Go to the
Occidental Hotel in San Francisco and see how
often he called me up by phone, begging
me to come to him. He himself told me he
was Judge of United States Supreme Court
and worth millions. Kvery mouthful he ate
was prepared and carried ud io him by one
Japanese cook. Henry TenÂ»yeke of Frisco. He
wanted to marry me and go to Johnson, Ariz.,
to live, as I can prove by his letters and tele
grams. Think you I deceived him whon I
never knew he had a wife living until his
death? The etory of the money paid by express
1 never beard until they came here. It was not
paid at our house, and hence I did not know
it. If hÂ» had this money paid him, then he
was a villain of deepest dye, for he borrowed
money of roe March 31 to go to Frisco, saying
there he wouM get his check cached by on*
John lJunn. then go to Denver and 'return in
ten <JayÂ« with Dr. Woods' divorce papers. Dr.
Woods sent him to the Hlckmotts In hopos h*
would tell the truth, for as the time dragged
on thÂ» deception was killing him and he
thought it would b* better to break the en
gagement than deceive the girl. His career Is
a phady one I now know. He fooled me by
claiming to have lived in uncle's house at
Rosevllle. N. J. He t.oM me he knew my
grandparents, and I believed him. Remember,
every word ran be proven by his letters. Grant
ing I fooled him. had he h moral or legal right
to marry me, no matter who I was?
We are creatures of circumstances and not
bad. Go to Western Union Telegraph office

Two years ago a thief entered Quillet's
sleeping apartments in the house above
his store and tried to rob him of his cash
box containing $700. but was frightened
off by Guillet's cry for help.
Charles Guillet, who conducts a confec
tionery and ice cream parlor at 906 Lar
kln street, has reported to the police the
fact that his etore was looted by burglars
late Saturday night. The loss to Guillet
amounts to $400 In cash and he has given
up hope of bringing the thieves to justice,
let alone getting back any of the coin.
Guillet makes a practice of closing his
place at about 11 o'clock. Just before
that hour on Saturday night two young
men entered the place and called for some
ice cream soda. Immediately after the
patrons had given their order James
Hall, a former employe of the place, came
in and after a short conversation with
the proprietor asked to be served with
coffee and toast. Mr. Guillet, being alone
at the time, went into the kitchen to pre
pare the order. During his absence the
two young men got up from, their table
and. depositing the amount of their check
on the counter, left the place.
Hall engaged Guillet in conversation
for a while and finally he departed.
Guillet keeps his day's receipts in a
desk until closing up time, when hie de
posits them in the safe. After closing
his store he went to the desk and found
the lock missing. He opened the lid only
to find the desk empty. Gulliet tele
phoned to the police and a detective was
sent to investigate.
Suspicion fell on Hall and the detective
found him in his room with two young
men. They answered the description
given by Guillet and the detective placed
them under arrest. Guillet was notified
and after looking at the men at the pri
son said he could not Identify them, so
they were released.

present The following programme was

He explained that $27,000 had already
been subscribed for. When bonds to the
amount of $100,000 were taken the lot.
costing $137,600, could be paid for, and
with this as security banks would ad
vance money sufficient to erect the build
ing. The stores of the building, which
the club would rent, would provide an in
come of $1700 a month, a sum sufficient
to meet the Interest on $300,000.
Frank Burke said that the option on
the lot was now worth $10,000.
Dr. Winslow Anderson asserted that
competent architects had estimated that
an Al steel structure of twelve stories
could be constructed for $160,000. The lot
is 70x44 feet.
In. the general discussion there were
many allusions to the growth of San
Francisco and the aspirations of the Un
ion League, but the mention ' of assess
ment seemed to damped the enthusiasm.
As there Is to be an adjourned general
meeting of the club to-morrow at 1:30
p.'m. no definite action on the option pay
ment of $5000 was taken last night: The
sense of tho meeting, however, against
the assessment policy was so obvious that
a resolution was adopted favoring the
organization of â¢ a ; stock company com
posed of club members to carry out the
project for purchasing land and erecting
a building.
THOUSANDS SUBSCRIBED.
The secretary read fifteen letters and
telegrams. Twelve gave ready assent to
the assessment. Three opposed the pol
icy of imposing a load cf debt on the
league. General N. P. Chipman of this
city and Mr. Mlddlecoff of Stockton ex
pressed dissent. In the general discus
sion of the proposed building enterprise
expressions of opinion were elicited by
President George H. Plppy from J. H.
Neff. Judge Hayne, Thomas V. Cator, E.
D. Peixotto, Frank Burke, A. L. Solinsk'y,
Hart North. Edward Coleman. A. H. Vail,
Joseph Spear Jr.. Frank Marston and Dr.
Winslow Anderson. It . was not clear to
the mind of Thomas V. Cator whether
the articles of incorporation would permit
the club to purchase land, erect a build
ing and rent and mortgage Its property.
t.j opposed the assessment policy on the
ground that many of the members fancied
that the first assessment would be the
only one required, whereas, according to
his calculations, successive assessments
would be required to provide means. He
reviewed the plan as set forth by Presi
dent Pippy, which requires the club to
pay $5000 on July 16, 132,500 thirty days
thereafter and $100,000 within one year.
He maintained that one assessment would
not raise money enough, even If the
whole membership responded.' to pay $37.
500, which must be paid within thirty
days, according to the scheme recom
mended by the committee of twenty-five.
President Pippy said that only one as
sessment would be necessary. In his
Judgment a general assessment Identify
ing the entire membership of the league
in the project would render the bonds
gilt edged and enable the club to dispose
of $100,000 of these bonds. Men who were
now willing to take only $1000 of bonds
would double their subscriptions.
EXPRESS OPINIONS.
Every member should attend the meeting
and help the yood work along. Members un
able ts attend will kindly send an expression
of cplnton In the matter either by mail or by

The proposition to assoes members of
the Union League Club for the purpose of
raising money to promote the new build
ing enterprise meets with vigorous re3lst
ance. Several city, suburban and coun
try members threaten to resign. In re
sponse to the following circular, bearing
the signature of President Plppy, sixty
members* of the club assembled last
night:
The club Is coins to have a home of Its own,
cne that every member will be proud of. The
site has been selected, one of the finest In the
city, facing on Union square. Now that we
have progressed thus far the question of
finances must be Immediately considered; to
that end a general meeting of the club has
been called for Tuesday evening. July 14, at S
o'clock, to act en the recommendation of the
committee of twenty-five that an assessment
of ?5O be levied on the city and suburban and
$25 on the State members, payable one-half im

Mrs. Moore states that Mrs. Corrick
took her daughter to the Fresno hospital
and left her on the steps of the institu
tion, although the officials protested that
there was no accommodation for such
cases. Nevertheless they took fcer in and
made her as comfortable as possible. She
claims that Mrs. Bennett was ready and
willing to come to this city, and upon her
arrival they did what they could for her.
After a Consultation it was decided that
the County Hospital was the best place
for her and accordingly she was taken
there by Moore. The baby was kept by
Mrs. Moore and upon the arrival of. Mrs.
Corrick a room was provided for her and
the child. Mrs. Moore maintains that Mrs.
Corrick created several scenes and upon
her return from a visit to her daughter
demanded the baby, which was refused
until Mrs. Bennett so ordered.
Moore, who travels through the State
soliciting subscriptions to carry on his
work in this city, was !n Fresno at the
time, and Mrs. CorTick avers that he re
ceived money from the authorities to take
her daughter out of the county. She al
leges that Moore received permiss^m to
take wife and child to this city, and ac
cordingly carried them away from the
hospital in a hack, against her will. Mrs.
Corrick was at the depot and protested
against taking her daughter away, but no
attention was paid to her. It was under
stood, according to Mrs. 'Corrick, that
Moore had an institution where he could
take care of the woman and baby. On
Saturday she states that she received a
message from, her daughter asking her to
come to this city. Upon her arrival she
found that the baby was at GM'i Wash
ington street and the mother had gone to
the County Hospital.
She went out to see hÂ«Â«r daughter and
upon her return demanded possession of
the baby, which was refused her. She
then notified the police and In company
with an officer went to Moore and got
the child, upon an order from the mother.
Moore Is not in town at the present
time, but his wife stated that her hus
band had been told of the pitlble con
dition of Mrs. Bennett by a Superior
Court Judge of Fresno, who asked him
if in his charitable work in San Fran
cisco he would be able to find some place
for her. Moore was willing to do some
thing for the child wife, and a subscrip
tion was started among the merchants
who had heard of the case and J15 was
raised to defray expenses of the trip.
According to the statements made by
Mrs. G. Corrlck of Fresno, General A. "W.
Moore, at the head of the Army Mission
at 624Va Washington street, is guilty of
forcibly abducting her daughter from
Fresno and placing her in the City and
County Hospital, and attempting to place
Mrs. Corrick's year-old grandchild in a
public institution.
Mrs. Corrick, who arrived In this city
from Fresno Sunday morning. iÂ» at pres
ent residing with friends at 635 Commer
cial street with her grandchild and la en
tirely without means. Her story is to tha
effect that her daughter, who is married
to a .young fellow named Wesley Ben
nett, was deserted by her husband In
Fresno, where they resided, and left with
out means of support. The young wife,
who is only'20 years of age. Is in a deli
cate condition and as her mother was un
able to properly care for her, the county
authorities were asked if she could ba
placed in the hospital during her Illness.
The request was granted by the Super
visors and Mrs. Bennett went to the In
stitution.
Attorney Scott added that Mrs. Shep
herd would not have been given posses
sion of the boy and girl had the father
understood that he was not to see them
frequently. According to the attorney
there is a possibility that Jorgensen will
not be sent back to Denmark. No formal
demand has been made as yet through the
Danish Minister at Washington, the reg
ular official channel, for the fugitive's
extradition. He has been held by United
States Commissioner Heacbck pending
such formality.
Mrs. Shepherd says she took the chil
dren away from the County Jail with the
father's consent. She did not believe their
surroundings were proper.
"I was unwilling to give them up," said
the matron of the Home for the Poor and
Needy, "because I believe they are being
used to compel the mother to put up
money. Of course, when the Danish Con
sul issued his order I recognized his au
thority in the matter and surrendered the
children."
Her reasons for keeping: such tenacious hold
upon the little ones I do not know. The girl
and boy have been placed in Danish families,
one in Alanudn, the other In Berkeley. The
Consul and Jorgensen are thoroughly satisfied.
Mrs. Shepherd Is, to say the least, ill advised
concerning: my attttude toward the children and
toward Mrs. Jorgrensen. I know the mother
wants her children and I also know that they
will be sent home If necessary at the expense
of the Danish Government, whose specific
wards they are. The Government is. In my
opinion, fully competent tc handle this matter.
It is fully advised concerning: the children and
Mrs. Jorgensen. The father is thoroughly con
tent, now that his children are in the hands
of fellow country people. Mrs. Shepherd may
be actuated by the highest motives, but sha
seriously errs In her statements.
This Mrs. Shepherd may be well meaning
enough. She went to the County Jail, took
the children out for the afternoon as the father
and Matron Murdock understood h*r. After
severs! days it was learned she had them in
this home at Alden. For two weeks the father
didn't see his children, to whom he Is most
devoted. At his request an in vest Iff at Ion was
made with the result that not until the Danish
Consul Interfered would Mrs. Shepherd sur
render the children.
Against the charges Attorney Scott, who
is representing Jorgensen and is also in
close touch with the Danish Consul, has
some sharp denials to offer, and, besides,
asks pointedly concerning the interest
Mrs. Shepherd has taken in the foreign
er's children. Scott declares that Jorgen
sen's children are wards of the Danish
Government, that the Danish Consul has
been specifically Instructed from Copen
hagen to care for them, that Mrs. Jorgen
sen is absolutely without means to assist
her husband if she desired, that Mrs. Jor
gensen has not been asked for assistance
and would not assist her straying spouse
if she could, that no matter what disposi
tion is made of the father's case the
Danish Government has directed that the
children be sent home to the mother, and
that such disposition will be made of
them
And, further. Attorney Scott said to
day:
Mrs. Shepherd, who had possession of
the accused defaulting cashier's children
until compelled by Danish Consul Blrk
horrri of San Francisco to surrender them,
declares that Jorgensen's offspring are
being held for ransom by Attorney Scott
ar.d to compel the defaulter's wife in Den
mark to pay his fees In defending Jor
gensen. Mrs. Shepherd Insists that the
attorney has been advised that the aban
doned wife wants the children returned to
.her and that efforts are being made to
induce the mother to part with gold to
have her little ones sent back to her.
Around the heads of little Carla and
Swenton Jorgensen, the children of Julius
Jorgensen, the cashier who fled from Den
mark with pretty Johanne Mueller, his
fellow employe in a Copenhagen institu
tion, has waged a battle that involves the
Danish Government on the one hand and
Mrs. Agnes B. Shepherd, matron of the
Christ's Home for the Poor and Needy,
at Alden, on the other side, with Attorney
J. Christiansen Scott In the breach of the

tsent of leaving off coffee and drinking
PoFtum It is still easy to learn all about
it by reading the experiences of others.
Drinking Postura is a pleasant way to
pet back to health. A man of Lancaster.
Pa., ntys; "My wife was a victim of nerv-
rjfness and weak stomach and loss of
appetite for yesrs and was^ a physical
wrwk; although we resorted to numerous
methods of relief, . one of which was a
. change from coffee' to tea. It was all to
no purpose.
"We knew coffee was causing the trou-
ble, but could not find anything to take
Iti place and cure the diseases until we
tried Poctum Food Coffee. In two weeks*
time after we quit coffee and used Pos-
tum almost all of her troubles had dis-
appeared be if by magic It was truly
wonderful. Her nervousness was all gone,
t-tomach trouble reliet'ed. appetite Im-
proved and above all a night's rest was
complete and refreshing.
"This s-ounds like an exaggeration, as
it all happened so quickly, but we are
prepared to prove it. Each day there is
improvement for the better, for the Pos-
tum Is undoubted^ strengthening her and
tnving her rich, red blood and renewed
life and vitality. Every particle of this
good work is due to Postum and to drink-
ing Postum in place of coffee." Name

A report for the month of June relating
to weather, crops and industrial condi
tions in California was submitted by Man
ager J. A. Fllcher. which was unanimous
ly approved by the board. - . â¢
Thls board also entertains the 'well founded
opinion that the shipment of green deciduous
fruit will become more profitable as that forru
of enterprise Is better understood and the pro
ceedings relating: to It are belter adjusted to
the necessities of the situation.-. - UJUSle a to
It is. therefore, the deliberate conclusion of
this board that the fruit growing industry of
the State of California is highly profltibKnd
that this profitableness is assured and perma-
But the profitableness of the fruit Industry
of California rests upon a more secure founda
tion. Citrus fruits are not perishable, and over
80 per cent of the deciduous fruits are cured
and canned In an Imperishable form. - The vi
cissitudes attending this form of Industry are
not greater than those met with on the field of
other Industrial activity. Profitable' Industries
cannot be Judged by fluctuations of profit from
year to year. All industry : Is â¢ attended by
varying conditions. Influencing Its profitable
ness. ;'â¢-Â¦ Â¦ 'â¢Â¦;.Â»- .-' : * ..
Yesterday the State Board of Trade
came to the front to affirm .that /fruit
growing- in California is profitable. It ap
pears that there are "knockers" abroad,
who are trying to make it appear i that
California fruit growing is. not -what it
has been represented to be. If this, idea
gets general credence it would . largely
damage the State. Consequently . the
State Board of Trade took up the mat
ter, discussed it in the light of reliable
statistice gathered from all - available
sources and adopted the following state
ment officially: i .-.â¢".
The profitableness of the fruit Industry of
California having been challenged and .broadly
Impeached by certain public statements.- tha
State Board of Trade, having had these state
ments under consideration, declares as follows:
The Impeachment of the profitableness of
fruit growing Is referable wholly to the fluctua
tion of profit as relates solely to the shipment
of green deciduous fruit. The .shipment or
green deciduous fruit to be profitable demands
a system of packing, shipment, refrigeration,
time schedule and distribution* which has not
yet been devleed. From the centers- of fruit
growing In California to the principal* markets
of the East the average distance. is 2500 miles.
The problem of the successful transportation
of green deciduous fruit requires In Its solution
proper initial handling of the fruit, -due consid
eration as to the state of ripeness In which. the
fruit leave* the point of origination, proper re
frigeration en route and careful attention to
the condition of the markets In which the fruit
Is offered. The green deciduous fruit shipments
are sold by agencies over which the grower, has
no control. These considerations present ele
ments of extra hazard wherein the result could
not be otherwise than disappointing In a very
large number of Instances.

NEW YORK. July 14.â The cotton market
opened weak at a decline of 8 to 27 points.
The close, while steady, was at a net decline
of 15 to 35 points or about the lowest of tha
session.
New York Cotton Market.
A grrat Impression was made upon senti
ment by the large liquidation In Consolidated
Gas. which carried It down 6% points. Et.
Paul's 4-polnt break In the late dealings to
a new level at 140% supplemented tbe In
fluence of the break in Consolidated Gas. The
public utilities of Greater New. York suffered
In sympathy with Consolidated Gas, as did
People's Gas. The drop In the United States
Steel stocks later in the day to new low records
was supplemented by reports that . the cut
made In prices of Iron had not resulted la
bringing in orders. High-priced Investment
stocks continued to be sold at wide price con
cessions.
The condition of the money market, was the
only development of the day to account for the
acute weakness of stocks. It was generally
accepted that the great railroad companies are
active bidders for money at fixed periods at 6
per cent rather than attempt any. Issues of new
capital at tnls time. Bankers and money-
NEW YORK. July 14.â After occasional re
sistance to the decline, prices of stocks sold off
eliarply this afternoon to tbe lowest level of
the year and the market closed active and
weak, with the declining tendency apparently
in full force. The sharp recovery In the lat
ter part of yesterday and a further advance In
London this morning aroused some hepes that
thfe fall in prices was ended, temporarily at
lean, but the slight opening advances here
attracted heavy selling, and while there were
occasional checks to the decline, there was no
further attempt of consequence made to put up
prices. The selling was entirely based on gen
eral considerations and was chiefly interesting
for It* sources, which, however, remained a
mystery. Who It is selling such enormous
amounts of stock and at such tremendous sac
rifices based on any possible purchase price
for two years past Is a subject of most earnest
surmise. The Interest attached to the subject
causes It to be surrounded with a vast deal
of gossip and rumor, which flies back and forth
not only wjthln Wall street but over the cables
from continent to continent. Authoritative
and reliable Information on the subject is not
to be had, but tbe volume and the method of
the liquidation put It beyond question that it
Is urgent and that It Is for the account of pow
erful financial Interests. â¢ ' ; 3 - '

Coucty destroyed several hundred acres of wheat.
It ;s reported that the damage to grain by the
dry northerly winds of the preceding week was
rreatly overestimated and that the lots will

Receipts of small tree fruits from the river
continue light, but receipts from other sec

supplied with most descriptions. Basket lots
of fruit cleaned up quickly on the wharf and
Apricots and Peaches brought higher prices.
There was a steady Inquiry for shipment north

Prunes and Apricots In crates moved freely at
steady prices. Fancy 4-tler Gravensteln Ap

Peaches In boxes were hard to dispose of. Re
ceipts of Flga were less liberal than for ume
days past and prices of double layer drawers
and large packages had a sharp little ad

Grapes, crferlngs being generally of poor qual

other car came In from Fresno. Cantaloupes
and Nutmejr Melons were offering freely from
several sections and moved uff well at good
prices. Choice Blackberries. Loganberries and
Currants met with a steady demand, and aa
receipts were light prices ranged higher. Rasp
berries and Strawberries were in free supply
and unchanged. ,
Aside from a decline in Mexican Limes,
there was nothing new to report In Citrus and

'"Market closes about half cent better than
yesterday. It ia still an active and rather
broad market. Cables were on the whole weak
and Broomhall reports conditions generally fa
vorable for European crops. The weekly Gov
ernment report says the thrashing returns Â»re
on the whole disappointing on winter wheat
and that rain is needed In some sections of the
-Northwest with crop heading out nhott. Ill
inois State report was bullish on Wheat. Rain
is still neede<l In some sections of the North
west. Prevailing cool weather, however, modi
fl?s the danger. Cash premiums are well main
tained In the Southwest markets, and for cer
tain grades of Wheat in this market. Move
ment of the new crop continues very small,
but the rjuaJity so far Is good. The movement
and cash demand will from now on be .im
portant factors and will be watched with In
terest.' The outlook la for a good scalping mar
ket, but we still feel that materially lower
prices*, are hardly probable. We would rather
take our chances in buying Wheat on the

lenders are in consequence extremely loth to
consider any requests for loans but those of the
highest grades. It is current report that not
only the grade of collateral but the Intended
use of the money is closely scrutinized by the
lenders. There is a story current of a refusal
by one of the great Wall-street banks to lend
something over $1,000,000 on the highest grade
of collateral because the Industrial purposes
for which the loan was designed did not meet
the approval of the bank official*. It is
pointed out by the Financial Chronicle that
the same adjustment of value to a hleher ln
terest bawls which has been In progress on the
Stock Exchange for a long time has also been
-going on in the municipal bond field. In which
the list of offerings which met with no bids is
constantly lengthening. The advance in the
money rate had the effect of weakening sterl
ing exchange and Inducing the selling of loan
bills by bankers and the sharp rise in the
premium on New York exchange at Chicago
Indicated the pressure to remit to this center.
The Weather Bureau's weekly crop report
had an unfavorable effect, as It- concerned
wheat, but the good promise of corn and cotton
would have been sufficient to offset this influ
ence In the stock market. All news of a fa
vorable character was Ignored, although Bai
tlmore and Ohio showed some early resistance
to decline on Its favorable showing of net
earnings for the year. Pennsylvania again
broke through the subscription price of 120 and
cloned at 116%. New York Central was weak,
but did not get back to yesterday"s low level.
Bonds were weak in sympathy with stocks.
Total sales, rax value, $2,295,000. United
States bonds were all unchanged on the last
call.

Plans for Grand Army Day.
OAKLAND, July 14.â Tho funeral of
Miss Lavlna Wheeler, who died Sunday,
aged 102 years, was held this afternoon
from her late residence. 1653 Grove street.
Services were conducted by the Rev. Dr.
Sunderland, a retired Baptist clergyman,
TVho was a close friend of the aged wom
an, who had lived more than a century.
The clergyman gave special thought to
the beautiful Christian character of.hla
departed friend and offered consolation .in
the expression of respect for the good in
fluences that had been sown during her
long life. Miss Ruth "Waterman sang
"One Sweetly Solemn Thought" and
"Asleep in- Jesus." Miss Wheeler's re
mains will be sent to Sacramento for in
terment. \
WOMAN CENTENARIAN'S .
FUNERAL IS HELD
The nurses defend their action by de
claring that they believed the suspension
of their sister nurses was not Justified.
Within the hospital the story is current
that the retirement of Miss Houghton has
much relieved the tension. .
Mrs. Yule regrets the occurrence. Bay
ing it was due to one of those unfortunate
misunderstandings that arise in institu
tions where a large number of persons are
in close relation to each other.
"The trouble Is over, the clouds have
drifted away and matters are running
smoothly again," said Mrs. Yule. 'There
were some words uttered which perhaps
should not have been said. Misa Hough
ton said to-day that she thought it would
be better if she left and went to a new
position In New York, so the directors ac
cepted her resignation."
The trouble was caused by the suspen
sion yesterday of Miss Harriet Winters
and Miss Minnie Taylor,, nurses. During a.
surgical operation Miss Ella Houghton. a
graduate nurBein charge of {lie operating
department, reprimanded Mlsa Winters,
who took quick offense at what she con
sidered tho offlciousness of "the head of
the department. The situation was called
to the attention Â« Mrs. John Yule, pres
ident of the hospital. . Miss Taylor was
spokeswoman last evening at a meeting
with Mrs. Yule and as a result both Miss
Winters and her champion were sus
pended..
The nurses took umbrage at that order
and resolved to Btrlke, making good their
intention this morning. As the condition
of the many patients was the first con
sideration, the hospital directors lost no
time In ending the strike by restoring the
suspended nurses to duty. That done, the
board accepted tho resignation, of Miss
Houghton, who departed this afternoon
from the institution.
Forty nurses In the training department
of Fabiola Hospital went on strike at 7
o'clock this morning, leaving the patients
to shift fpr themselves with such assist
ance as the few attaches of the Institu
tion not disaffected could give them. For
three hours this situation existed and then
the hurriedly called directors of the hos
pital settled the difficulty.

It was a distinguished assemblage
which sat down to the banquet {able in
the maple room. G. Calegarls was to
play the part of toastmaster, when the
unfortunate retirement of the Embassa
dor caused all formality, to be done away
with. Mayor Schmitz and General Mac-
Arthur, A. Sbarbaro, Dr. Paola de Vecchi,
Consul General Count Grcmani and thirty
other guests were assembled.
The illness of the Erabassador had
given a premonitory evidence of Its ex
istence early In the afternoon when Signor
des Planches had been slightly stricken
with his ailment at a luncheon given to
him by G. Calegaris. When he again
experienced pain from the same cause
last night Dr. de Vecchi advised his im
mediate retirement and Jh.e guest of the
evening reluctantly obeyed.
After Des Planches had left the table
the banquet was continued with all for
malities thrown aside. At its conclusion
night to do honor to their distin
guished guest, Signor Mayor des Plan
ches, the Italian Embassador, a sharp at
tack of bronchial trouble caused the
guest of the evening to make his apolo
gies and retire before the festivities of
the evening had been long under way.
Though not at all of a serious character,
the illness of the guest of honor was for
a time so poignant as to prevent his en
joyment of the evening and render his
early retirement obligatory".

French Citizens Remem
ber Day of Deliver
ance From Tyrrany.
Celebrate at Chutes With
Song, Stirring Speech
and a Ball.
The one hundred and tenth anniversary
of the Fall of the BaeUle was celebrated
yesterday at the Chutes by a great and
enthusiastic gathering of French citizens
of San Francisco. The flags of France
and the United States fluttered gaily la
the breezes and good-fellowship, patriot
ism, song and speech were in accord.
It was a spirited, merry crowd that
hummed the soulful "Marseillaise" In a
livelier measure than is usual under pro
found circumstances and occasions where
the majesty of the music Is perhaps of
elgnincant moment.
The proce<?<lings were announced to be
gin at 2 o'clock In the afternoon, and
punctually on the hour the national air of
France was given In rousing spirit by the
band, and all present Joined In one great
voice.
Then carhe the occasion when the presi
dent of the day, P. A. Bergerot, was to
rpeak to the vast assemblage on the im
port of the day it had met to honor and
celebrate and further strengthen In their
hearts end minds. He told of the tri
umph won by the citizens of France vrhen
they, on the 14th day of July, 1793. stormed
tie Bastile and set a.t liberty those who
within its gloomy walls had suffered men
tal anguish and torture. The speaker gave
forth words of wisdom and sentiments
brimful of stirring enthusiasm, and
aroused Ms hearers to cheers when allud
ing to what the people of France did on
the memcr&b'e day, which they were
called together to honor. In the cause of
liberty, equality and fraternity.
SJNO NATIONAL AIRS.
Then came M. A- Roncovieri with a
trombone solo and Mayor Schmitz with a
speech telling of the sympathy Americans
had with the day they had Joined In cele
brating.
Stephen V. Costello followed with an
address, and then the band played and
the assrmblaire sang "The Star-Spangled
Banner."
Another address was given, this time by
M. A. Lucinchi. and the mass of people
again joined the band In rendering the
â¢â¢Marseillaise." which was followed by the
delivery of "La Prise de la Bastile," by
M. E. Bournireau.
The rest of the afternoon was taken up
by a performance in the Chutes Theater,
which was Jarjrely attended, and .other
entertainments provided by the manage
ment of the irrounds and the committees.
At dU5k there was a pretty illumination
of the prounfis. also fireworks, which had
been specially desijrrsrd for the occasion.
A little before 10 o'clock bugles sounded
the hour for the beginning of the grand
ball, which was enjoyed until an early
hour this morning. A
The officers of the French warship Pro
tet attended the celebration and received
a most cordial preeting.

Fen Troubles Disappear
"On behalf of the Carmen's Union, I
rest my case In chief." said E. J. Uver
j nash/ late yesterday afternoon. He ex
! pected to close his side of the case early
i yesterday- morning and. allow the United
1 Railroads to open Its case, but unforseen
obstacles prevented this programme.
Livernash started In yesterday morning
by presenting the reports of Superintend
! ent of Schools Langdon, which showed
i that the school census for 1901 was 82,173:
} in 1902 it was 82.391, and in 1903. 91.386. The
j purpose of this was not made clear.
1 Llvernash then made a statement in
("reference to his wish to call Patrick Cal
! noun to the stand later. The most sen
i satlonal part of his statement was:
j That In its anxiety to obtain possession of
I San Francisco railway properties for stock
1 and bond speculation during hysterical and
' abnormal conditions of the American atock
' and bond market, the United Railways Invest
i ment Company of San Francisco drove the
i quotations of the stock of the San Francisco
1 railway corporations, whose properties it de-
I sired to acquire, at least *5.00O.0uO beyond the
; quotations ruling Immediately before this
i anxiety for the Immediate possession Influenced
i the stock market
i That Mr. Calhoun and his personal associ
ates have so manipulated the stocks and bonds
affecting the United Railroads as that a brok
erage of not less than $1,000,000 paid to them
selves and their associates In another capa-
I city ha Â» been virtually capitalized and made
i to yield interest as though tt represented orlg-
I lnal railway value-Interest, that Is, derivable
I from the gross earnings of the United Rail
roads.
Robert F. Gallagher, a shorthand re
porter, who took down the testimony In
the famous Slebe case in 1895, was then
called. He read from his notes the tes
timony of J. L. Willcutt, who was sec
retary of the Market-street Railway at
!' that -time. Willcutt testified that he did
I not think that the Market-street Rail
way was worth $4,000,000 at that time.
Attorney Moore, on behalf of the United
Railroads, objected to this line of testi
mony, as he declared that at the time
Willcutt gave. evidence, the Market-street
Railway was in dire distress. The future
prosperity .of . the road was dependent on
a decision then pending In the State Su
preme Court, and there was also at that
time nn acltatlonby the general public
to have car fares reduced. Moore sug
gested that if the car fares had been re
duced at that time the street car com
pany would have been forced Into Insolv
ency. ;-:; ; ;~'v'?,v : Â¦
When Llvernash rested his case yester
day afternoon Moore said that the United
Railroads would be In a position to open
Its. case to-dav. He estimates that he
will close bis case within a week.

province crowded the boulevards.* which
were gayly adorned with flags,'- the 'Stars
and Stripes mingling in the' decorations.
The Government â¢ and â¢ other " theaters,
which gave free matinees, were densely
crowded. The open air performance in
the square In front of -Victor Hugo's res-:
ldence was well attended, while dancing
was in full swing at many, points in the
streets. It was noticeable that the fete
was accompanied by more popular -en
thusiasm than has been accorded any cel
ebration in recent' years. . â¢
The streets of Paris to-night were
thronged with merry crowds, dancing to
the music furnished by bands stationed
at most of the crossways. A feature of
these open air balls was the popularity of
the cakewalk. The Government, munic
ipal and many private buildings were
brilliantly illuminated. and great displays
of fireworks were given at ; prominent
points in the city. It was unquestionably
one of the gayest Hths of July v seen for
years. . . - . ,.- \. :
