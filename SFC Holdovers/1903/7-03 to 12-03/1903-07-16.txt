J ONDON, July 16.â
*-^ A dispatch from Rome,
timed 6:50 this morning,
says the Pope passed a very
restless night and his con
dition this morning is con
siderably worse.
ROME, July 16, 3:25
a. m. â The beginning of
the second part of the night
was somewhat restless,
and Dr. Lapponi tried to
assist the patient with stim
ulants and nourishment,
The Pope slept from 12 to 1
o'clock, but his sleep was
too profound to be quite
natural.
IN the street carmen's case in Ean
Francisco yesterday the arbitration
' proceedings did not last long, but
vital points were brought to light
and there were several spirited con
tests between opposing counsel.
Attorney Moore opened the general case
for the United Railroads, and President
Holland was the first witness. Before he
was called, however, Moore made a pre
liminary statement that surprised the op
position.
"The officers of the company that are
to testify," ha said, "have prepared their
statements in advance, and I shall ask
to have them read into the records."
Livernash was surprised, but he was
on his feet at once with an objection,
which, however, was overruled.
President Holland's statement proved a

WASHINGTON, July 15.â The reported
seizure of islands off the coast of Borneo
by American warships apparently was as
great a surprise to the administration of
ficials In Washington as it was to mem
bers of Parliament In London. No infor
mation that such a step was contempla
ted has come from the admiral command
ing the . American fleet -in' Philippine
-waters, and ho exploitation along' the lines
indicated has been directed by the offi
cials here so far as could be ascertained
to-night. * "
A very, plausible explanation o* the re
ported occurrence is that the" command
ing I officer in the Philippines simply had
sent one or more of bis vessels and
hoisted the flag of the United States over
some islands near the coast, of Borneo
which were 'purchased by the United
States from . Spain subsequent to the
treaty -of Paris and that the sovereignty
of the United States over them had been
proclaimed * formally. These were the
Cagayan 'Zulu group, comprising one
large and fourteen smaller "Islands, and
\ho larger island of Palawan. These
islands : were not* comprehended within
the boundaries of ' the '. Philippine archi
pelago when the treaty of Paris was
signed. Th.e claim was made later, how
ever,', that' they .rightfully belonged to
Spain, and Â¦ they were formally ceded to
the. United States by a subsequent action
ofV that "Government and our Congress
made an appropriation and pawl the pur
chase price agreed on for them.- "Â¦
LONDON, July 15.â According to the
Press Association a curious rumor was
current In the lobby of the House of
Commons to-night to the effect "that some
United States warships had seized about
twenty small islands off the coast of Bor
neo, which, it Is v - understood, belong to
Great Britain, and planted tho American
flag on | them. It is probable a question
on the subjedt will be asked In the House.
NEW YORK, jJuly 16.â Demoralization
in the stock "market to-day made it. up
to the time of* the closing rally, one of
the meet disastrous daya since the mem
orable panic of May 9,' 1901. New low
records for the year were made in the
trading on- a heavy volume of business.
Some of the declines in high-grade invest
ment stocks for the day ran all the way
from 4. to 7 points. In the early dealings
there was a rush to sell.j Prices dropped
sharply and in some cases precipitately,
with active stocks down 2 and 3 points
each and. witlv an extreme break of more
than" 50 points reported in St.' Louis and
San Francisco' and Chicago and. Eastern
Illinois certificates. .
The decline: was especially noteworthy,
however, in such stocks as St. Paul, New
'York Central, < Union Pacific, Canadian

issues and complete recoveries In .a.. few,

above Tuesday's final quotations, t"' . 'â¢
*' Traders were" naturally disposed t<T view
the selling of high-grade investment is
sues with" considerable uneasiness, on. the
theory that it forced soiling
opponents who were compelled- to Â»part
with their. securities to raise funds to pro
tect speculative accounts elsewhere in the
market.' Several' important interests were
sellers of. stocks that had been. carried oh
borrowed money ; for. a long r period, > the
sales being induced by the attitude of the
banks, which decided to - call In loans ' to

â¢ A'dlstinctly unfavorable impression was
created -by the announcement of an issue
of short time notes by the Union, Pacific
to the ; amount of ' $10,000,000; also smaller
loans by. several other railroad companies.
Following the borrowing by the; Burling

The doctors are well, nigh exhausted
with their unceasing cares. Dr. Lappor.l.
in particular, spends' h"- entire nights as
well as days In f e sick room. Just be
fore mldnisbt his wife, wishing to see
him. went to the Vatican. She was taken
to a corridor near the sick room, where
she saw her husband for a few minutes.
An Important case before the British con.
sular court In Rome reauires the pres
ence of Dr. Lapponi. but this is Impos
sible because of the Pope's condition, antf
also because the Vatican ' affords extra
territorial privileges to ail within its pre
cincts.
The moderate tone of the bulletin that
followed the visit gave assurance that
the patient's condition was practically un
changed, while the expression that his
strength had not decreased afforded a
slight note of relief.
Â¦ Last evenine his Holiness complained
of a silent uneasiness in the chest, but
that he has not yet completely given up
hope was Indicated by his remark that
he expected the oppression to pass off
in a few days. During the day the Pope
drank a few drops of the healing waters
from the shrine at Lourdes, several bot
tles of which were sent to the Vatican
by the French Bishop in whose see Lour
des Is situated. A local paper gravely
announces that from the moment Popo
Ljeo swallowed the water an improvement
in his condition became apparent.
DOCTORS NEARLY EXHAUSTED.
During the day the Pope took a slight
amount of nourishment. Through the
morning he was quite restless, shifting
uneasily on bis bed and complaining of
being unable to secure- an easy position.
Later he became drowsy and during the
afternoon had some sleep. The assem
blage of the doctors at half past 5 o'clock,
two hours before the usual time, was not
duo to any alarming turn In the Pope's
condition, but through the wish thorough
ly to go over every .detail of the situation.
. > "ROME, July 15. â At the present mo
ment the disease of hiSfHcliness baa lost
its character of absolute gravity which.
it had at its acute period. It might be
considered to have entered the period oC
possible solution. This might occur in a
man of strong fiber and young, but it is
impossible to entertain such a hope In
the case of a man in his ninety-fourth
year. With him the physical energy ab
solutely indispensable for recovery la
lacking. Pope Leo's organism is perfect
and as such maintains itself after ninety
three years of never Interrupted work,
but his motor force is no longer sufficient
for the complex functions essential to life.
In other words, the ninety-three years of
Pope Leo XIII bring him Into that cate
gory, of extraordinary longevity when Ufa
is destined to flicker ont In lependent of
the action of any pathological complica
tions. The only service that science and
affection can render is that of struggling
to have this precious existence- preserved
to us as long aa possible.
"GAETANO MAZZONL"
RAVAGE WROUGHT BY IIXNESS.
One of the doctors In attendance on
the Pontiff gave yesterday a graphic word
picture of Pope Leo as he now appears.
That smile that lighted up the Pontiff's
face even in extreme age. has disap
peared, probably forever. The skin is
drawn tightly over the bone framework of
his face, leaving only the bright eyes
staring dimly, from the deeply sunken
sockets. A grayish pallor overspreads his
countenance, but the noticeable ravage
wrought by hi-s present disease is the
dropping of the lower Jaw, which has
made the Pope's features take on the
fjxed risiuity of death.
Throughout yesterday the precincts of
the Vatican were comparatively quiet and
the immediate vicinity of the sick room
showed none of the evidences of agita
tion and alarm so apparent on Tuesday.
In marked contrast to previous days, the
patient was kept in almost absolute se
clusion, only one person besides the phy
sicians gaining admission. This one was
Mgr. Pifferl, the Pope's confessor. Oth
ers, including Cardinals Satolli and Sera
flno Vannuttelli. came to the ante-cham
ber, but they did not press for admis
sion to the sick room, being aware of
the doctors' earnest wish to afford the
august patient every opportunity of avoid
ing mental efforj.
PATIENT IS RESTLESS.
July 16.â Dr. Mazzonl, In re-
JfM ply to the question, "Can the*
F^T Pope recover?" gave to the press
â¢ late last night the following signed
statement:
It is therefore believed If she has car
ried her threat into execution the bodies
will be found hi some rooming-house.
There are .hundreds of such houses iri
Los Angeles and,- although tho.; search
through them has been in progress all
night, not the slightest trace of the wom
an, or children has been found. Her
brother-in-law came to Los Angeles from
Santa Ana' to-night to assist in- the
search, but, he: could do nothing.
He stated that the woman had un
doubtedly been rendered Insane through
grief over the death of her husband. Be
fore, her. marriage; she was injured about
the head in a runaway and a piece of
her skull had s to be ' removed, but until
the deatn of her -husband there was noth
ing to indicate that she was of .unsound
mind.' The search; will ; be,; continued to
morrow, if ; necessary,, but the police be
lieve 1 the; bodies., will. j be found In the
morning., unless , the mother has chosen
some secret place liko\ the basement of
a vacant house .to : commit the .crimes
which. she" threatened. .
SEARCH FOR THE BODIES.
A few weeks ago she moved to Berke
ley, intending to open a boarding-house,
hoping to secure the patronage of stu
dents of the State University. She spent
some time there and not finding the place
to her liking went to San Francisco, but
later returned to Berkeley, where her fur
niture was unpacked, but the proposed
boarding-house ,was never opened.
The first intimation Mrs.- Hughlett's
relatives had of anything wrong was on
Monday, when they received a postal
card from her, in which she announced
that they would hear from her only once
more because she had decided to give up
the struggle. She said she would come
to some place In the State more conven
ient for them and there do what she had
long contemplated. She left Berkeley last
Saturday night and came to this city, but
where she stopped Is not known. This
morning Mrs. Julius Goeffer of Santa
Ana, sister of Mrs. Hughlett, received a
letter from her dated Los Angeles, the
postmark showing that it was mailed last
night after 8 o'clock. >
The letter was to the effect that after
studying over the matter for months she
had decided to end, her life and being un
willing that others should have the care
of her children 'had decided to give them
what she took herself. She wrote of what
she had done with her personal effects,
most of them having been shipped back
to Santa Ana, her baggage being In this
city, but she told where the baggage
checks were and what should be done with
her . effects. . She mentioned articles she
wanted her friends to have, and ' after
these gifts had been made the balance of
her property and, about $200 in cash was
to become the property of her sister. The
letter ends with the statement that by
the time It was received by her sister she
would be dead. There was nothing What
ever in the letter to Indicate from what
point in Los Angeles it had been written,
but she mentioned the fact that she had
engaged rooms.
WARNS ?ER RELATIVES.
Mrs. Hughlett until recently ; lived * in
Santa Ana and there her husband, a. well
known citizen. . died, less '4'han -a year. ago.
The â¢ death of her husband' caused her to
become so despondent that she would eat
notching for ''days at a time. .She 'seemed
to fear that she would be unable to care
for her children properly and had been
heard to express a desire to Join her hus
band if she could- take her children with
her. Friends tried; to cheer her without
success, but by appealing to her for h<?r
children's sake and urging her to do
something for them, she appeared to
again take; heart.
The reason for the search and the fear
that a terrible tragedy has been com
mitted is that a sister of the woman re
ceived at Santa Ana to-day a letter in
which the writer stated that when it was
received she and her two children would
be dead, for she had decided to kill them
and then end her own life. - ' .
LOS ANGELES. July 15.â In some ob
scure' rooming-house the police believe
will be found to-morrow the body of Mrs.
Mary Hughlett and those of her two
children, Frank aged 14 years, arid Grace,
aged 12 years, the children dead by the
mother's hand and she a suicide. The
police to-night are trying to find them,
but there are so many places where the
double murder and suicide might . be
committed that their efforts have been
unsuccessful.

the company is paying too much to its
men. H e went so far as to say that the
company reluctantly adopted the present
schedule Just after the strike. If the
board could grant the request he would
like to' have the arbitrators agree to lower
wages. \
In the course of his testimony he said
he had, learned that he could get men

control of his tongue that before he could
complete a sentence he would reply to

Attorney Moore in his opening argu
ment-briefly, said, in part:
. In reference to the Increase of the t pay of
the carmen, we simply say that the new sched

wages were then raised 17^4 per cent The
raise was not Intended for that fixed time, but
they were raised with a view of permanency.
On the^second question of the carmen, we
say that- we will prove that the supply of car

to the Increased cost' of. living;,- we win prove
that thÂ« cost of living is not greater than It
was In April. 1002.

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED RAILROADS. WHO FRANKLY STATED
IN HIS TESTIMONY THAT CARMEN'S WAGES SHOULD BE RE
DUCED, AND COUNSEL FOR THE CORPORATION.
The first fight occurred when a truck
loaded with freight, escorted by police
bound for the Burlington depot was pass'
in* the corner of Harrison and Peorla
etreets. A howling mob of a thousand
men and boys was following close upon
the police and pelting them with stones
and sticks. Teamsters who sympathized
with the strikers got their wacons J in
the way of the Kellogg Company's wag
on, causing a blockade. The police en
deavored- to dear the street, when the
workmen on an unfinished building close
by showered them with bricks. The offi
cers drew their revolvers end fired at
thr workmen, who hastily fled to the in
terior of the building. The police kept
up their fire through the windows and
drove nearly all the workmen from the
place. The route* to the depot was then
taken up and, although there were sev
eral blockades, the wagon reached the
depot. The second fight occurred when
the police were escorting a wagon load
cf freight to the warehouse of the Ter
minal Transfer Company at Ogden aye
cue and Twelfth street. A mob of 3000
followed this wagon and. although the
police were outnumbered 100 to 1, they
took the wagon safely to the depot. The
mob had greatly increased by the time
the wagon was read;- to make the return
trip and for half a mile It pursued the
police, applying to them all sorts of epi
thets and peltinc ther- with sticks and
stones, without, however. Injuring any
persons seriously. The climax came at
Congress street and Ogden avenue, when
a private watchman fired at one of the
mob. The shofr went wide. ' but It in
flamed tne mob, and with shouis an<i
yells they charged the police. The offi
cers fouffht with fists and clubs and in
less than three minutes had put every
member of the mob to night. Fully a

lying In the street. About twenty ar
rests were made during the day. Both

MAYVILLE. Ky., July 15.â Enraged at
the courts, a mob broke into the Flem
ingsburg Jail early to-day and hanged
William Thacker, a white man, who had
been given a life sentence for the mur
der of John Gordon two years ago.
Thacker in a quarrel with Gordon shot
and killed him,' then sat on the body, rifle
In hand, while 'he smoked his pipe and
dared any one to attempt to arrest him.
At the time Thacker escaped, but was
later arrested. After two trials he was
sentenced to life Imprisonment.
Gordon was a good citizen and an in
offensive man. After being sentenced
Thacker appealed to the Court of Ap
peals and was waiting for another trial.
Thacker had some money and was able
to command the support. of some influen
tial men and it was feared that he might,
escape punishment altogether.
The mob collected at Mount Carmel,
where Gordon once lived, and came Into
Flemincsburg by twos and threes in order
not to arouse suspicion. They advanced
upon the jail shortly after midnight. The
jailer refused to surrender the keys. He
was overpowered and the keys taken
from him. Thacker was hurried to a tree
near the t jail* and was given tlirfe* in
which to say his prayers, which he re
fused to do, but begged for his life. To
hut* h his cries he was hit on the . head
with a rock and his unconscious body
strung up until life had become extinct.

they will be placed on the stand and a sworn
statement read by them, and if counsel from
the other eide wish to redirect examine them
he may do so at the conclusion of their state
ment.
President Holland was then' called to
the ' stand and read the following state
ment:-* :
. I. was chosen president of the United Rail
roads of San Francisco on May 22, 1902. hav
ing been acting president since March 31, 1002,
when I assumed the duties of the office.
' At that time the ware scale in effect upon
the several divisions of the United Railroads
varied -somewhat. The United Railroads on
April 1, 1902, assumed the management and
ownership of the several street railway prop
erties known- as the Market Streat Railway
system, the main portion of the -Slitter Street
Railway system, the Sutro Railroad and the
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway
system. On these, lines motormen. grtpmen,
drivers and . conductors were, receiving the fol
lowing rates of pay: .
The Market street' system â 22c per hour for
the first five years. 23c per hour for the second
five years, '24c per hour for the third five years,
25c per hour for the fourth five years and there
after., . ? .. .- ... .. -
, Putter street system â 21c per hour flat.
The Sutro system â 22c per hour flat.
The San Francisco and San Mateo system â
22c per hour flat. ' ,
AIl f of which on May 1. 1902. were to have
been placed ontfcs same wage' basis as the
Market street system. . . _
WAGES TOO HIGH.
It'was'not th<Â» policy of the new * manage
ment to make any radical or rud/en change
in the . personnel of the operating department
o^the railway, nor was it the Intention of the
company to. reduce wages, although the wage
scalÂ»s In effect were high by comparison with
wage 'scales .in effect In other large cities on
this coast, and elsewhere,. The first concern
of the officials of the company was to effect an
economical consolidation of the physical prop
erties and to give to the public the Improved
service that â¢ consolidation would render possi
ble.
Before the details of reorganization were
well under way. viz.. on the 19th day of
April, 1002, less than three weeks after taking
over the properties, a strike was declared and
all of the company's lines were "tied up."
The company gave the most careful consid
eration of' all- of "the carmen's demands. The
wage demand of 2ft cents per hour was con
sidered exorbitant. We were unable to find
a similar high scale prevailing on any large
system of street railways In America for men
in similar employment. At that time, to-wlt.
In April, 1902. I made or caused to be made,
an inquiry of other street railway companies
on this coast as to the rates of wages then
prevailing on their respective lines. The fol
lowing summary sets forth the replies received
from such companies In answer to . euch in
quiries and these were the wage scales then
prevailing on these lines:
At Los Angeles; Cal. â The Los Angeles Rail
way Company paid the following rates: Un
der three years. 20c per hour: over three and
under five years. 21c per.feour: over five years,
22c per hour. The LoÂ« Angeles Traction Com
pany riald thÂ» same rates. !
At Oakland. Cal.â The Oakland Transit Com
pany paid the .following rates: Under three
years. 21c per hour: over three years. 22c per
hour; work from 10 to 11 hours per day.
At Sacramento, Cal. â The Sacramento Elec
tric, Gas and Railway Company paid the fol
lowing rates: First two years. 18c per hour;
next three years. 10c per hour: next three
years, 20c per hour; after eight years' service.
21c per hour.
At San Diego. Cal. â San Diego Electric
Railway Company paid Its carmen 20c per hour.
At Fresno, Cal. â The Fresno, BolmonJ and
Yosemlte Railroad Company paid its carmen
$2 per day. . -
At Portland. Ore. â The. City and Suburban
Railway Company paid Its regular men 22ftc
per hour, and Its extra men 20c per hour.
At Seattle. Wash. â The Seattle Electric
Company paid Its men 22c per hour.
At Spokane, Wash.â The Washington Water
Power Company paid Its men for the first six
months 18c per hour: 12 months 20c per hour;
12 months 21c per hour; then 22VÂ£c until 10
years' service: after which 2So per hour. Max
imum hours 12 to 13, according to run. One
day off per week without pay. No express
limit as to (time within which swing runs shall
be completed.
At'Tacoma. Wash. â The Tacoma Railway
and Power Company paid their men a sliding
scale according to character of runs and length
of sen-Ice. New men have single truck runs
and old men have cable and double truck runs.
Base rates: Single truck. 18c; cable and dou
ble truck, 2Oc for city runs; long distance hljrh
ppeed suburban passenger and freight, 22VsC.
To above rnte they add lc an hour for every
five years' service. Average of runs about 21.
Old men have choice of runs according to sen
iority."
FILES OBJECTION.
At this juncture Livernash objected to
the introduction- of. any testimony rela
tive to the wages paid car men in other
cities. He said In part:
On behalf of thÂ« union which is a party to
this arbitration, I enter a formal objection to
the testimony sought to b* adduced by the
question just put. As the ground of the ob
jection I represent that this testimony Ik In
competent, Irrelevant and Immaterial. It
would be Inherently unjust. un-American and
Industrially unsafe and unsound for the Ar
bitration Commission to Indulge the standard
contended for by the United Railroads, under
cover of the question put, aa a right standard
for fixing wages of members of our union.
The standard. I take It, contended for as
agalnzt the' union is such standard as might be
ascertained' If the old ' Rlcardo law of supply
and demand were to be gi\-en free play. And
we urge that conditions In San Francisco and
conditions generally In America physically for
bid the free play of the law of supply and de
mand in the labor market; end that the high
est demands of American civilization will re
quire that this Arbitration Commission should
do nothing tending to substitute the law of
supply and demand for the law invoked by our
union.
I shall not at this time engage In any argu
ment upon this subject-matter, but when I am
In the presence of the arbitrators themselves
I shall support my objection by both parole
and written plea.
FIRST IMPULSE.
Continuing at the close of the objection
of Livernash, President Holland stated:
The first impulse was to resist this demand
or compromise It, but, being assured that to
concede a substantial advance upon the highest
wages paid on any large system on this coast
or elsewhere | in America would permanently
put labor troubles behind U3, and, wishing the
good will of our men and the public, the com
pany practically granted every demand- made
by the men, except one, which has since been
granted, to-wlt: The company declined 1 to
recognize the union, but agreed to treat^wlth
committees of its own employes. The settle
ment was adjusted April 20. 1002.
president Holland then read the agree
ment entered Into between the United
Railroads and the Carmen's Union.
Continuing. President Holland said:
In less than four months another controversy
was threatened, and I am' advised that new
demands were prepared to be served upon tha
company in August last, but that wiser coun
sel advised a j postponement of such demands
until the presentation of those now under con
sideration. -
COMPANY'S SCHEDULE.
On March 18. 1903. the demands in contro
versy were served upon the company and these
demands with the Bubsequent replies- and cor
respondence constitute the basis of the present
arbitration under which this company has
presented for the consideration of the arbiters
the following scale of wages: 22Vi cents per
hour for the first year, 23 cents per hour for
the second year, 23 Vi cents per hour for the
third year, 24 cents per hour for the* fourth
year, 25 cents per hour for the fifth year.
The legal rate of fare In San Francisco Is 5
cents. This rate Is fixed by law and cannot
be increased by the company, nor Is any addi
tional charge made for trans^rs.
The franchises held by the company are not
perpetual, as ' lfl frequently the case in other
communities. They were originally granted to
our predecessors in Interest for a term of fifty
years between . twenty and thirty years ago.
Under the present charter of the city and
county of Ban Francisco street railway fran
chises may only be granted tor the period of
twenty-five years. . At the expiration of such
franchises the roadbed, rails, superstructures
and all fixtures t>n the public streets become
the property of the city. During the twenty
five-year Hie of the franchise the company re
ceiving the same must pay into the city treas
ury the following percentages of Its gross re
ceipts: Three per cent for the first five years,
4 per cent for the next ten years, 5 per cent
for the next ten years.
HIGHEST WAGES.
On behalf of the "Onited Railroads of San
Francisco, I may say that this company will
well- and /faithfully carry out the terms and
live up- to the. true spirit and Intent of such
contract aa may be - finally entered into be
tween itself on the one hand and the Carraen'i
Union on the other hand. .' â¢ -
Grave; consequences, rest upon the decision
of this board. A great sum is Involved to this
company. But above and beyond this Is the
almost certain disastrous effect a diminution
of. hours or an* Increase of wagea will have
upon other car lines and upon other Industries
on 'the Pacific Slope. Already the' highest
wages prevail her*, and If one may predicate
prophecies of the future upon happening* of
the past, It is safe to say tbat a change In
hours or . wages on the Â¦ largest street ' railway
system on the coast. will bring about demand*
for similar changes on. every other line in thÂ«
West. Indeed, its effect would reach further
still, for a scale . of < waxes ranging from 33 1-3
cents â¢ upward must offer inducement to the
carmen throughout America who are receiving
from 13 and 14 cents per hour upward, to de-Â»
mand. and. If refused, strike for higher com
pensation. < This Is a condition that neither
friend of labor nor friend of capital can wish
to hasten . , . .
-.When President Holland concluded read
At the night session the report of the
committee on credentials was not quite
ready and an adjournment was taken un
til to-morrow. The delay in the conven
tion was caused by the contest over the
Louisville delegation, the Wilson forces
developing unexpected strength. While
waiting for news of the committee
would do, the delegates called Incessant
ly for Bradley, showing that the effects
of the outburst of the afternoon had not
been dissipated. The Bradley sentiment,
so suddenly but strongly developed, [Un
settled the calculations of the politicians.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Yerkes made a speech during the evening
Indicating his preference for Belknap.
STILL WANT BRADLEY.
Bradley has been supporting Hon. A. E.
WHso'n, who is contesting the entire
Louisville delegation.
After half an hour of steadily growing
excitement the convention was suddenly
adjourned unjil to-night.
The resolution was read by ex-Governor
Bradley without having first obtained
consent, but it was unanimously adopted
by a rising vote.
Immediately afterward Mr. Bradley
was given a tremendous . ovation. He
made an address, in which he appealed
for honest elections and honest conven
tions and referred indirectly to the con
test over the Louisville delegation by
pleading that the delegates nominate only
a man whose methods had been fair and
'honest and one who could command
united support. The speech was power
fully . put and there immediately began
what threatened to become a stampede
to Bradley. Hundreds of delegates gath
ered about him and admonished him that
he was the man who most nearly resem
bled the picture he had himself drawn.
If Bradley had bcon placed in nomination
then he would have received an almost
unanimous vote.
Former Governor Bradley then' offered
the following resolution:
Resolved. That we. the Republicans of Ken
tucky, express our heartfelt approval and ad
miration of â¢ the administration of Theodore
Roosevelt and that we heartily Indorse him
for the Republican nomination for President
In 15)01.
INDORSE ROOSEVELT.
The convention was called to order by
State Chairman C. M. Barnett. There
are three candidates for Governor/ Colonel
Morris B. Belknap, Hon. Augustus E.
Wilson and Attorney General Clifton B.
Pratt. Chairman Barnett announced that
the State Central Committee would waive
its right to arbitrarily name the tem
porary chairman and called for nomina
tions. Major William C. Owens was
named by the Belknap forces, while
Charles Blanford received a large part of
the combined strength of the Wilson and
Pratt forces. The result was a vote of
1571 to 675 In favor of Owens. This vote
cast in the contest for Governor would
enable Belknap to win 'even should he
lose the contested Louisville delegation
of 249 votes.

and the situation is full of possibilities
for more pyrotechnics before final ad
journment is taken. The salient features
of the afternoon gathering were an in
dorsement of President Roosevelt's can
didacy in 1904.. which upset the calcula
tions of several . shrewd leaders, who, it
Is charged, were figuring on ignoring that
point in the platform.' and what amounted
almost to a stampede to former Governor
William O. Bradley, who is not an an
nounced candidate, after Colonel Morris
B. Belknap had, on a test vote for tem
ponfty chairman, apparently shown that
he could win hands down on the first
ballot.

the matter too severely. What I mean is
that a carman who has to wear three or

here. a"nd we can get all the men we want
to work," he added.
"Well. then. Mr. Holland, you also think
that wages should be governed by supply
and demand; and I ask whether you think
you can get men to work for less money
on the cars?" Llvernash asked.
"I have no doubt of It," promptly re
plied Holland.
GET PLENTY OF MEN.
"Where can you get the men?" asked
Livernash.
"Many placesâ New Jersey, for instance.
David Young has informed me that he
Could get all the men he wanted to come
from there and work for less, and be glad
to get the work". lam informed that
there were 2000 men obtainable."
"Oh, then, you have looked around to
PAID TOO MUCH.
"Yes, I should like to see them adopt
ed." replied Holland. "I think the present
wages of the carmen are too high. Yes,
we want to see the wages reduced."
"What are your reasons for wishing to
see the carmen's wages reduced?" contin
ued Livernash. "'.Â¦â . '
"Oh, there are many reasons. I thought
at the close of the strike that the men
were presenting a very extreme rate. My
first reason is that with the exception of
Butte. Mont., no street car men are paid
as high wages as In San Francisco. My
second reason is that the climatic condi
tions are so favorable to the carmen here
that I think they are paid too much."
"Well, Mr. Holland, do you think that
the carmen's wages should be governed
by the studying of a thermometer?" Liv
ernash asked.
ing his statement Attorney Moore wheeled
around sharply to Llvernash and said.
"Take the witness."
From then on until the close of the ses
sion Llvernash and President Holland
went at it hammer and tongs.
"I see the company haa presented to
the board of arbitration" a new schedule
o'f wages." said Llvernash. "They are
lower than the present rate of wages, are
they, not, Mr. Holland? /Would you like
to see them adopted?"
get other men?"
"No, I simply got this information so
as to be informed concerning the labor
market." replied Holland. "We could
supply the demand In three days."
"Oh. I suppose if there were no Immi
gration laws to stop you, you could get
10.000 Japs from Japan." snapped LJver
nash.
Continuing Llvernash said. "I certainly
know that should you attempt to ship out
trainloads of men from the East you
would not be allowed to run your cars."
At this stage Moore Jumped into the
fray with. "Well, now, as an American
citizen, I Â»m glad te know Just how you
stand. I suppose you would stop these
men by force of arms."
WOULD NOT USE FORCE.
"I did not say anything about force of
arms. I do say, though." said LJvernash.
"that there are'50.000 union men here and
they would preVent any such steps being
taken.. There was a car strike here re
cently and there was no disorder."
"No, there was no disorder." said
Moore, "but a vast amount of intlmida
tlon. You should go over to Oakland nor
and see what I mean. "When a linenan
goes out to fix a wire one or two mer fol

or something of that nature. We have
come to a climax. Mr. Llvernash. and I
can plainly see your views. Y03 don't
think It is right for an American Id go to
work if the unions won't allow him to
work. Let me congratulate you; I am
glad to see you so sincere."
A few minutes before recess Cq.iductor
Quinn of the Union street UnÂ« Â»vas re

a friend of Tom Williams. He did not

Airship Ready for Trial Trip.
WASHINGTON. July 15.â Professor S.

point on the Lower Potomac, where it
will be given it3 initial trial as soon as
some few detalls^can be arranged.
"The conclave, in view of the authority
which Cardinal Gibbons will exercise, will
probably pave the way for a more just
representation of the United States in
the sacred college which will bear its
fruits In the next conclave. But even now
the Catholics of republican United
States will not permit that a monarchical
nation should intervene in the coming
conclave with its veto and thus affirm Its
historical risht to have at the Vatican
an ally of European monarchies.
"For the moment, while awaiting the
forthcoming transformation of the sacred
college In their favor, the Catholics of
the -United States demand a new Pope
with modern ideasâ ideas which will lead
him to approve the action of American
Catholicism; a Pope who will maintain
most friendly relations with the Presi
dent of the United States, as Leo XIII
showed his great admiration and sym
pathy for the personal qualities of Mr.
Roosevelt.
"Leo XIII did much for the Catholics
of 'the United States. He put an 'end to
the stupid polemics of certain French
Catholic writers against so-called ' Ameri
canism; he created the: Catholic Univer
sity in Washington and instituted an
apostolic delegation by which he put an
end to conflicts between Catholics of the
United States. But one of his most Im
portant acts was making Mgr. Gibbons
a Cardinal."
"Cardinal Gibbons, however, will have
great Influence In the next conclave. His
Eminence has very N great authority with
all members of the sacred college, and
will impress upon that assembly the pow
er which he possesses as representative
of the United States. He will prove to
them that the United States has a right
to be no longer considered as a simple
colony, with a single Cardinal. It has
a right to have proportionately as many
Cardinals as Spain. Jf this right were
admitted there would be twelve Ameri
can Cardinals. â¢-
â¢ ROME, July 15.â 1 to-day had an Inter
view with a monselgnor who is a friend
of the United States apropos of the com
ing conclave and the interests T bf Ameri
can Catholics. lie said:
"Cardinal Gibbons is on the point 'of
arriving In- Rome. T.his is very impor
tant, as It will be the first time that an
American Cardinal will take part in the
election of a Pope. Cardinal McCloskey,
on the last occasion, arrived too late to
take part In the conclave. He heard of
the election of Leo XIII on his arrival at
Queenstown. '
"If It ,had not been that a number of
Cardinals favorable to him have died
lately Cardinal Gibbons would have had
a very good chance of being elected Pope.
The late Cardinal SiciHano de Rende. who
was formerly papal nuncio in Paris,
would have done all he could to have
him elected.

had more than 1100 in his possession when
taken into custody, and his pockets were
filled with blue and pink letters, all writ

The telegram which the physicians say
will save Dawson from becoming per

the young man's pocket. He had appar
ently been so crazed with grief that he
had neglected to open it.
Although Dawson is ill and weak from

and though his mind has been slightly
affected by his disappointment In love, It
is thought that in a week or ten days' he
will have entirely recovered.

It will be suggested to her that she may
hasten his recovery by coming to Seattle

While In Wall street opinions differed as
to heavy corporate borrowing, as evi
denced by this and other cases; the firm
negotiating the loan said that It was cer
tainly an encouraging sign and clearly In
dicated that money was readily available
for high class undertakings.
It is understood that most of the money

lleved that the Union Pacific announce
ment was an important factor in the de

of various large railroads for money were
responsible for the liquidation of many
stock market accounts at serious losses.
The United States Steel issues, which
were under pressure the greater part of
the day. made new low record prices.
Buying of the shares on the decline was
said to be for the account of interests
identified with the property, but the sup

as an influence on values.
Homer S. King, president of Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s Bank, says: "New York
does not affect us very much. There Is
plenty of money here for the transaction
of business. The price on many stocks on
Wai! street has been too high. Many con
cerns have been overcapitalized. The re
action is natural. There is nothing in the
situation to disturb the Pacific Coast."
T. C. Frledlander. secretary of the San
Francisco Merchants' Exchange, says:
"General conditions are satisfactory. The
grain crops are not large, but the prices
are good, and the outlook is favorable
for good prices for fruit, wine and cattle

farmers of the State. There is no strin

Ignatz Steinhart, manager of the Anglo-
Californlan Bank, regards the shrinkage
in Wall street as natural. "So far as the
Pacific Coast is concerned," he says, "the
outlook is fairly good. Good crops are in
sight and the prices will be good. The
WaJl street market will not affect busi
ness on the Pacific Coast unless the situ
ation becomes very acute. The Pacific
Coast has bef-n very prosperous and there
has been a large advance In real estate
values, especially in San Francisco. Cali
fornia Is on a solid basis."
E. B. Pond, president of the San Fran

"This may better conditions," he says.

the world.
WASHINGTON. July 15.â At the State

Manchurian situation was of the most
satisfactory nature. As a result of the
conference Secretary Hay will furrier ad
vise the American Treaty Commissioners

PORT ARTHUR. Manchuria. July 15.â
The conference of prominent Russian of
ficials has ended. Exultation over Rus
sia's Increasing power in Manchuria was
the dominant note in the gathering. The
possibility of taking any backward steps
are scoffed at, if mentioned by outsiders.
It was admitted that the war possibility
was discussed, but it was denied that It
was the object of the conference.
Evidences of Increase of warlike prepa
rations since the arrival of General Kuro
patkin. the Minister of War. and of the
intention to bring more troops to Man
churia are abundant. Orders were given
to Port Arthur contractors last week for
an immediate supply of building ma
terials for barracks to accommodate 20,
000 soldiers to be shipped to Harbin.
The oiricials explained that Russia's op
position to opening Manchurian towns to
foreigners was not based upon opposition
to foreigners, whose trade is desired and
who wou.d In due time be invited into
the country. But Russia objected, they
explained, to having Consuls accredited
to the Chinese Government in towns
which are practically under Russian con
trol, which would give the subjects of
countries so represented the enjoyment of
extra territorial rights. They asserted
that such arrangements would be certain
to result in great friction, such as oc
curred in Newchwang.

In the new statute, says the newspaper,
by prolonpation of terms or by solitary
confinement up to one hundred days with
bread and water, except every third day,
when hot food will be served at one meal.
The abolition of the cudgel and "cat"
does not. however, mean the prohibition

ST. LOUIS. July 15.â The. "kid party for
grown folks," so popular in some Eastern
cities, was Introduced last night to St.
Louis by Judge and Mrs. James L. Blair
at their beautiful suburban home at Kirk
wood. Two score of the best known men
and women In town were present. The la
dles wore short dresses, made in childish
fashion, with their hair down their backs.
The men were attired in short trousers,
troublesome waists and the dropstttcb
half-hose of babyhood.
The games which were played provoked
hilarity among men who do not laugb
often. "Wade the swamp." forfeits. King
William, postofneo and other kissing
games made the evening pass as quickly
as of old.
Mrs. Blair herself was the life of th*
party. She made the guests, some of
whom were a bit timid at first, feel per
fectly natural in the garments they had
discarded so many years ago with pride
and thankfulness.
Mrs. Blair, who is president of thÂ«
board of lady managers of the World" t

of the names of her guests.

we ever had grown up. The little party
was ultra private, and I don't think It
would be the proper thing for me to an*

FAILS TO FIND WOODS
To Judge J. J. Murray, City Recorder of
San Rafael. Ward said yesterday: "This
scandal is killing me. I presume I am
guilty of a felony for having mutilated
Colonel Best's body, but I did not know
I was committing any crime. I know 1
will be arrested. I have enemies in San
Rafael and they are hounding me to
death. Now, since they really have some
thing to go on, as I presume the law is
correct, they will not hesitate to have
me arrested. I have always tried to be
honest. I have raised a family and never
before has my character been assailed. 1
cannot stand it much longer. I had sooner
die than go to San Quentin."
Ward was ">0 years of age. He leaves
a wife, eon and daughter. *
ment to the East and who was
regarded by the prosecution as one of the
principal witnesses against "Dr." John
Donald Woods and Alice Cloy Wood,
who are suspected 'of having murdered
Best, died early this morning trom valvu
lar disease of the heart. The death of
Ward is a eerious blow to the prosecution,
as it removes one of the strongest wit
nesses against the fugitive.
There 1Â« no doubt but that worry has
tened Ward's death. When he was pre
paring Best's body for shipment he re
moved several of the organs and threw
them into the sewer. The body was ex
humed In the East when the investigation
was commenced and when l\ was found
that the remains had been mutilated
Ward was severely censured. District
Attorney Boyd and Detective de Pue com
pelled Ward to undergo a severe cross
questioning. During the examination
Ward was informed that he had commit
ted a felony by mutilating the body. He
was told, however, that there was no in
tention of arresting him. After that
Ward was apprehensive. He went to sev
eral of his friends and arranged for ball,
as he said he knew he would be arrested.
Ward was taken sick last night while
at Sawyer's undertaking parlors. Night
Watchman Peter O'Brien found him late
in the night in a semi-conscious condition.
Dr. W. F. Jones was summoned and
Ward was removed to his home. He never
rallied. When the news of Ward's death
became public a great many persons were
of the opinion that he had committed
puiclde. Owing to the rumors of that na
ture an autopsy was held and it was
found that he had died from valvular
disease of the heart.

SB. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
The man on the stage who does thÂ«
trick of escaping from firmly tied ropes,
submits to the bonds with a smile. Ha
knows he can get out of the ropes that
are being knotted. Put the same man ia
the woods and let Indian captors bind
him to a tree for torture and he would
'struggle to the last against the bonds. ,
When the stomach is diseased there
are bonds being woven every hoar about
the organs dependent on the stomach-
heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, etc. The
folly of mankind is to passively submit
to the fastening of these bonds with no
effort to escape until the pain they cause
arouses fear.*
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It
cures diseases of heart; liver, lungs, kid-
neys and other organs, when these dis-
eases, as is often the case, have their
origin in the diseased stomach.

The public would like to know what
Abraham Ruef 6aid to Norman Hall when
he met him on the street yesterday after
noon after the story was out.
Mayor Schmitz showed equal surprise
over the Hall expose and like his astute
manager denied any knowledge of the
story.
When confronted with Hall's story the
man who, notwithstanding all his traitor
ous acts, aspires to be the prime minister
of the Republican party, smiled a wise
smile and denied the story in toto. He
said:
Tfete Is all wrong. L Â«e\*er asked Hall to
foist any such- deal on the convention. I never
tried to brftus Schmitz before the Republican
party at that time. I deny fiatly the whole
story and every part of It.
1 told him that I did not need offers of
political preferment and that If I did th<Â» work
it would be through my own convictions of
what was right. I finally consented to do It.
When I went on the floor of the convention
that night I heard that Schmitz had obtained
a leave of absence from the Columbia Theater
and was near at hand, knowing that I was
ready to do the trick. But after Wells was
nominated I cot a hurried message from
Scbmltz. which was brought to me by the man
who is now his typewriter, . telling me not to
put Schmitz in nomination. I obeyed the re
quest. After the meeting Ruef met me and
called me down hard for not doing what he
ordered. He said: i
"If you had done that we would have cinched
the whole thing and won votes in plenty for
Bchmitz."
REFUSES INDUCEMENT.
Oa the very afternoon of the opening of the
convention Ruef summoned me to a confer
ence with Schmitz and himself in bis office.
While there he said that, as a favor, he would
like to have tse place Schmitz's name In nomi
nation. He Intimated very boldly that I would
probably be hissed and that etronr marks of
disapprobation would be shown which would all
militate to the strength of Kchmita as being
an expression of the Republican party's un
alterable opposition to organized labor.
While I was hesitating, he said, with a
hack:
"How would you like to be Schmitz's private
secretary in case of his election?"
A* a delegate of the Primary League from
the old Thirty-ninth. I attended the convention.
Through my friendship for Ruef I came to be
practically his mouthpiece on the- floor of the
convention, since he could not appear, by rea
eon of his failure cf election.
According to Hall so wroth was Ruef
at his apparent defection that he never
forgave the lapse from his orders. He
bitterly complained that his deep scheme
of putting the Republican party on record
as opposed to organized labor had failed
lamentably.
Hall tells a straightforward etory of the
affair. He says:
HALL DISCLOSES FACTS.
Deceived by the honeyed words of Ruef
Hall went into the convention ready to
carry out the promise he had made and
nominate Schmitz. After the enthusias
tic nomination of Asa R. Wells, Hall was
preparing to place Schmitz's name be
fore -the convention when that gentleman,
Â¦who had been keeping his finger on the
pulse of affairs, suddenly weakened and
tent a hurried message to Hall command
ing him to desist. In this way did
Schmitz's name fail to come before the
convention.
â¢ Ruef frankly disclosed his Intention to
Hall. If he could have Schmitz's' name
placed before the convention evident dis
approval, as he thought, would follow.
This he could convert Into the creed that
the Republican party was unalterably on
record as opposed to organized labor.
In order to thus secure, as he thought,
more votes for his favored candidate by
the antagonism apainst organized labor
-which he expected to see manifested,
Ruef was willing to betray his party by
a trick and Eugene E. Schmitz' was a
willing second to the scheme of his as
tute boss.
BETRAYS HIS PARTY.
Upon the word of Hall, he was ap
proached by Ruef the afternoon of the
meeting of the Republican delegates two
years ago and offered a fat position if he
would place Eugene Schmitz" f name be
fore the convention as candidate for
Mayor. This was after Schmitz had re
ceived the nomination of the Union Labor
party.

which eerve as a Btrong commentary upon
the political method* of the present Mayor
and his henchmen in the recently inaug
urated movement to have him. succeed

According to the story of Norman W.
Hall, a prominent young business man
connected with the printing- firm of Wal
ter N. Brunt and a power In the Republi

Mayor Schmitz and his manager, Abe
Ruef, combined to traduce the delegates

It was insidious.

JOHN DJUNCAN'S SONS, Agenti, NEW YORK: > \finished a tour of inspection of the coast,
and yesterday he announced that the com
pany would hereafter have a representa
tive here In the person of Fred W. Prince,
local ticket agent of the Santa Fe road.
The appointment confers on" Prince the
official title of general agent, and Messrs.
Zeppettini and Parasso will be his as
sistants.', In discussing the changes yes
terday Agent Morgan said that hereafter
all the business for the line between Mex
ico and British Columbia will be trans
acted in this city. The Anchor line is a
Scotch corporation operating more than
fifty vesels between New York and Brit
ish and other foreign ports, and naturally
an agency here is regarded as of consid
erable importance to traffic men, and
especially to Prince, who was fortunate
enough to secure it. ,
As a result of the recent accident on,
the coast line, in which a train jumped
the track and several- cars went over an
embankment, the Southern Pacific has
put a gang of men to work building gran
ite abutments along the embankment for
a distance of several hundred- feet. Its
construction department is also replacing
the old bridges ,on the Santa Barbara
branch with three steel ones. r\
Dr. Jameson, ln reply to an address at
Cape Town recently, referred to the raid
as a blunder which he had expiated, and
which he heped had been condoned.
Attorney H. A. Massey is the defendant
ln a suit to recover a one-third interest
in the estate of Elizabeth Trask Rivers,
filed yesterday by Charles D. Trask, as
eignee of Emma Trask Clifford. It is
charged in the complaint that Massey
Kilsrepresented the condition of the Trask
estate to Mrs. Clifford and obtained from
her an assignment of her Interests and
now claims that he is entitled to the In
terest for his services as an attorney. A
similar suit was brought by Mrs. Clif
ford some months ago.
New Suit Against M assey.
There was a quiet wedding last even
ing at the Pacific-avenue residence of
Colonel Samuel M. Swigert, U. S. A., re
tired, when his daughter, Miss Clara
Platt Swigert, .was given ln marriage to
Lieutenant Oliver P. Morton Hazzard.
Second Cavalry. U. S. A. Chaplain Pot
ter of the Second Cavalry officiated. The
ill health of the bride's father necessi
tated a very quiet wedding and only
relatives were Invited to witness the nup
tials.
The bride was charming in a simple
gown of white etamlne. There were no
attendants. : The ceremony was per
formed at .5:30, and after congratulations
supper was served. Lieutenant and Mrs.
Hazzard left at 8 o'clock for Seattle, and
after a Tirlef visit there will proceed to
New York and Kentucky. After a
month's honeymoon the happy couple will
reside at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont,
where . the groom is stationed.
Lieutenant Hazzard saw hard service ln
the Spanish-American war'and was asso
ciated with General Funston lrÂ« the cap
ture of . Agulnaldo. Colonel Swigert
while In active service in the Philippines

Irish point lace. She also wore a tulle
veil and carried lilies of the valley. Miss
Mary E. Leary, the bride's sister, was
maid of honor. She wore blue crepe de
Chine with Chantllly lace and carried
Bridesmaid roses. Dr Robert E. O'Con

ACCUSES LAWYER OF
:Â¦<? DBAWINO A PISTOL
Bobart Cordes Has J. A. Taylor Ar
rested, and Latter's Friend Is
Jailed for Becoming Abusive.
OAKLAND, July 16.â James A. Taylor,
a prominent young lawyer .of this city,
was arrested last night by Policeman
Mulgrew and locked up In the City Prison
on a charge of carrying a concealed
weapon. The complaining witness is
Robert Cordes, a prominent real estate
broker. Fred P. Johns, secretary of the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals and a friend of Taylor, tried to per
suade the police to release the latter, and
he was also locked up on a charge of
disturbing the peace.
Cordes, in company with Guy Smith,
formerly treasurer of the Macdonough
Theater, and George Austin, a real'es
tate man, were coming out of a restau
rant shortly after midnight as Taylor and
Johns were passing, the place. They
must have had some sort of an argu
ment, for shortly afterward Cordes met
Policeman Mulgrew and told him that a
man had drawn a pistol on himself and
his friend. He pointed out Taylor as the
offender and the officer locked the latter
up on a charge of carrying a concealed
weapon.
Johns accompanied his friend to the
City Prison and told the desk sergeant
that Taylor did not draw a weapon, but
that the revolver was in his pocket and
accidentally fell out. Then he tried to
have Taylor released on his own recog
nizance and became abusive, so . he was
jailed on a charge of disturbing the peace.

Mr. Mills yesterday said that he had
not been advised of any changes and that
they did not concern him to any great de
gree. "I am not an applicant for any
pension, nor do I want one," said Mr.
Mills, "and whenever the owners of the
road desire me to retire they will find me
ready to turn over the affairs of the of
fice that I have managed for more than
twenty years." J
The freight departments of the South
ern Pacific the Union; Pacific and the
Santa Fe were yesterday advised through
Secretary Countiss of the transcontinen
tal freight bureau that the Western and
Atlantic Railroad is the latest to with
draw from the west and east bound traffic
arrangement with the transcontinental
lines. The withdrawal of the roads which
compose the Southeastern Freight Asso
ciation â¢ from the transcontinental agree
ment \m attracting a deal of attention
from Western importers and shippers, for
it is expected that it will result ln an ad
vance of rates and materially affect busi
ness with the East and Southeast. The
trouble Is due to the * demands of the
Southeastern roads, operating south of
the Ohio River and west of the Missis
sippi River, for a' greater . proportion of
the eastbound through rates on Califor
nia products. The transcontinental roads
refused the demands and the withdrawals
began, with the understanding that they
would become effective . on July 25. â¢ The
threatened advance in rates .will affect
mainly freight destined to: points in Ala

John T. Morgan, traveling passenger
agent of the Anchor steamship lines, who
is a guest at the Palace Hotel, has just
The old story of the consolidation of the
land departments of the Southern Pacific
and Central Pacific railroads has been're
vived, with the additional report that
both are to be placed in charge of the
law department of the Southern Pacific
Company. The officials of the company
stated yesterday that they had heard
nothing of the proposed change further
than the report on the street. That a
consolidation of the departments will oc
cur some day is not doubted by any one
familiar with the alms of the Harriman
interests. In fact, the consolidation
scheme was conceived first by the late
Collis P. Huntington shortly after he was
elected president of the road, and when
he came West he discussed the proposi
tion with the heads of the various depart
ments. He even^ntered upon the plan of
consolidating several departments, among
them the purchasing offices, which were
placed in charge of R. P. Schwerin, and
he would probably have united the land
offices had he lived and* remained in con
trol of the two roads. Unlike other de
partments of the company, the business
of the land offices diminishes, instead of
increases, for every sale of land decreases
the volume of business and the responsi
bilities of the agents. - Neither W. H.
Mills nor Jerome Madden seems con
cerned over the reported changes.
MILLS BEADY TO KETIHE.
NO CONSOLIDATION YET.
Although not yet officially announced,,
it was stated yesterday by one of the
heads of the Southern Pacific departments
that the position of assistant traffic man
ager on the Atlantic system of the road,
which was recently vacated by S. F. B.
Morse, will not be filled.
The plan of the company, so advlce3
from Traffic Manager Stubbs' office ln
Chicago state, is to abolish the position
of assistant traffic manager on that sys
tem and place the latter in charge of T.
J. Anderson of Houston, whose promotion
to the position of general passenger and
ticket agent has just been announced. As
an explanation for this change the official
said that the title of assistant traffic
manager was created when Morse was
given control of the Houston and Texas
road, and that after the Southern Pacific
Company disposed of that property the
duties of the office have not warranted
the continuance of the service of the of
ficial. The opportunity to abolish it was
afforded the company when Morse re
signed, and it is expected that formal an
nouncement of the change will bÂ« made

torney made an effort to get the cash
ball In each case reduced to $250, but was
unsuccessful. Selbach had a certificate of
deposit for $930 ln his pocket when search
ed at the City Prison and it would be

showed the motive for the attorney's re

W. H. Selbach. the dentist from Co
lumbus, Ohio, who narrowly escaped
lynching at the hands of a mob at Mar
ket and Third streets on Tuesday after
noon for his brutal attack upon three
Sisters of the German Dominican Convent
on Gr.ererro street, appeared in Police
Judge Conlan's court yesterday to an
swer two j charges of battery. His fat
face was discolored and swollen and
showed unmistakably the effects of the
beating he had received from the infu
riated citizens.
"When the cases were called Policeman
P. N. Herlihy, who arrested Selbach, in
formed the Judge that he had been un
able to have complaints sworn to by Sis
ters Marguerite and Lorenzo as they
were out of the city. The Judge said
he would continue the cases till to-mor
row morning, nnd if the sisters could
not be prevailed upon to swear to the
complaints he suggested that Herllhy
should do so, as he was a witness to
the attack upon the Sisters, and the
cases could be tried without their pres
ence.

AT the close of the Boxer rebellion, and after
Peking had been made safe for the foreign
legations, the United States, England, Ger
many, France, Japan, Italy and Russia, which had all
been represented on Chinese soil by troops and in
her waters by warships, agreed with each other and
with China to evacuate the country at fixed dates.
This agreement was a formal international treaty be
tween its signatories. They have all kept faith ex
cept Russia. She is still in Manchuria, where she
was when she gave her word to leave. She has used
her position there to coerce China into granting to
her permanent occupancy and- control of North

THE latest novelty, or deviltry, in the way of
compounding or concentrating articles of food
or drink is reported from London, and con
sists of a "beer concentrate," recently submitted for
inspection at a meeting of the British brewers. The
invention is not quite equal to a beer tablet which
a man could carry around id" his pocket, but it is the
next thing to that and may eventually lead to it.
In describing the invention the Westminster Ga
zette says: "Shorn of all technical detail, concen
trated beer, which is of the consistency of treacle,
is a pure and unadulterated hopwort produced by
the mashing of hops and malt. No sugar whatever
is added. The concentrate when ready is poured
into tins or drums and hermetically sealed, in which
form it is proof against all climatic changes." From
56 pounds of the concentrate there can be made 36
gallons of "sparkling light pale ale." All the pur
chaser has to do is to add to the concentrate a quan
tity of water in proportion to the strength which he
prefers in his beer, put in the yeast, which is shipped
with the concentrate, and allow time for fermenta
tion. It is claimed that a good beer can be furnished
in that way at a cost of not exceeding twenty-five
cents a gallon even in the wilds of South Africa.
The story is a pleasing one and the reference to
light sparkling pale ale is enticing, but despite the
assurances that the mixture is pure and unadulter
ated, the chances are that we have here another one
of those cheap and easy ways of manufacturing arti
cles for food and for drink which have become such
an abomination in our markets. Recently the author
ities of Minnesota are reported to have found men
making strawberry jam out of hay seed with an ad
mixture of glucose and a little coloring and flavor
ing material. That mixture was also called "pure."
It had nothing in it but' genuine vegetable substances.
No consumer, however, likes to be fed on hay seed
when he asks for strawberries and pays for them.
The "beer concentrate" is of- no' great importance
in itself, but it is another step in the direction of
the wholesale "sophistication" of all sorts of food
and drink, so that in the end we may yet see man
kind'throwing. fine fruit and grapes to hogs, while
converting hay seed and refuse into desserts and
wines for themselves.

safeguard against leakage and most formidable
in resisting the great pressure that will have
to be contended with. The larger of the two
Diomede islands will be used probably for a
compressed air station and repair shops. We
have taken soundings of the entire breadth of
the straits and find that the average depth of
the water Is 150 feet. With these facts before
us. our engineers have estimated that it will
cost In the neighborhood of $63,000,000 to build
the tunnels and their connections.
Outside of the Government experiments the con
struction of steamers with the turbine engines has
been limited to two small steamers plying on the
Clyde and three pleasure yachts, in addition to the
Queen. There is now in process of construction,
however, an ocean steamer for the Atlantic trade that
:11 give the new form of propulsion a full and fair
trial. She is expected to make twenty-five knots
on an average across the Atlantic and to be the
swiftest ocean greyhound afloat The inventor is
sanguine of even better results than that He claims
that the larger the vessel the greater will be the ad
vantage of substituting rotary for reciprocating en
gines; that there will be gain, of speed, economy
and evenness of motion, and that in the near future
luxurious liners with turbine engines will transport
passengers across the Atlantic in four days, and pos
sibly in three.
It is the belief of the inventor that he will be
eventually able to overcome the defect complained of
and to equip a steamer with turbine engines that
will drive her ahead or astern at a rate of thirty
knots. The engine, indeed, is far from being per
fected. The first "turbiner" was launched in 1897, and
the craft was hardly large enough to count for more
than a model. The British Government had two
small war craft fitted with the turbine engines and
they proved exceptionally fast, one of them making
thirty-five and the other thirty-nine knots on trial,
but both were lost at sea. There is now only one
war vessel on the sea with turbine engines, and she
is not dependent on them, being fitted with ordinary
engines for general use, and resorting to the turbine
only for exceptional cases where high speed is de
sired. â¢
venience.
A correspondent of the Westminster Gazette, who
made the trip with the Queen on her trial, says:
''She has more reserve power than the old boats;
fhe is expected to prove more economical in steam
and coal consumption, and the upkeep of her en
gines will be less costly in many ways than that of
the existing type of engines. Those throbbing mo
tions which accempanj' the working of the pistons in
ordinary engines are banished, and the; turbine's ab
sence of vibration will be welcome by those who
<Jread the tossing waves."
The chief defect in the new engine is that of an
incapacity for going backward as readily as the ex
isting engines. The Queen, for example, can be
driven ahead at a rate of twenty-two knots, but her
speed astern is only thirteen knots, and special tur
bines for reversing have to be provided even to at
tain that speed. Atlantic captains wish to be able to
go ahead or astern at the same rate of speed, and
consequently ship builders and owners have been
slow in adopting the rotary method of propulsion.
We learn from our London exchanges that the
Queen has a length of 310 feet, a molded breadth of
40 feet and a depth of 25 feet. She is in every re
spect much superior to the ordinary channel steamer
and is fitted with far larger accommodations for pas
sengers. On a measured mile she made a speed of
22\'i knots. While traveling at a 20-knot speed her
engines were reversed and it was found she could be
stopped in one minute and seven seconds, or within
a distance of 129 fathoms, or two and a half times
her own length. The swiitest steamers now plying
between Dover and Calais require seventy-five min
utes for the trip in the best weather. The Queen
can make it in less than sixty minutes, so that the
crossing will be in future literally a ferry over which
passengers can go with comparatively little incon-
COMPARATIVELY little attention was given
in this cour.tr>' to the recent trial trip of the
steamer Queen across the British Channel
under the rotary method of steamship propulsion. In
Great Britain, however, the event has been noted as
one of grc-t interest, as it was the first trial of the
turbine engine on a ship of sufficient size to carry
passengers and freight and be commercially useful.
The success which attended the trial has been hailed
as a demonstration of the triumphs of the turbine,
and it is now predicted that within a few years
turbine steamers will be as common on the ocean as
those with reciprocating engines.

PERSONAL MENTION.
We purpose to have a large and airy tunnel,
possibly two and. If necessary, three. The dis
tance to undermine is thirty-seven miles and
we have thoroughly acquainted ourselves with
the condition of the bottom of the waters un
der which we intend to operate. It is of a
granite formation and Just the sort that will
best serve our purposes. In that It wlll# be a
A FEASIBLE PROJECT.
In discussing this subject yesterday De
Lobel said:
> , 9"vr^ WO years will be all that It
Â© Â© 11 necessary to complete the
II tunneling of Bering Straits
** and within* six years the rail
road that will connect two
great hemispheres will be In full opera
tion."
Lolcq de Lobel, the French geographer,
who has formulated extravagant plans
for belting the globe with steel rails and
foreees the realization of his gigantic
scheme, which Involves a route beneath
the waters that separate the Siberian and
Alaskan shores, was In a most sanguine
mood when seen yesterday in his apart
ments at the Palace. Other than In a
general way he had little to add to what
was told in yesterday's Call of his great
project, which, in fact, has as Its most
enterprising and interesting feature the
proposed tunnel under the Straits of Ber
ing, a distance of thirty-seven miles,
which he does not regard as a very dif
ficult task or one that will involve a
period of labor of .more than two years.
It is mainly to the ingeunity of Amer
ican engineers that De Lobel looks for the
solution of the problem as to which will
be the best means of carrying out his
plans insofar as they apply to the Ber
ing Straits portion of his undertaking.
The American, he argues, is capable of
accomplishing the work which many have
been pleased to refer to as a difficult feat,
but which he regards as being no more
difficult than the construction of a great
tunnel beneath the channel from Dover to
Calais, a proposition which has been pro
nounced perfectly feasible.
OUR Eastern fellow countrymen are sweltering
through a heated spell that is not only tor
rid, but horrid, and our Eastern exchanges
are daily advising them to keep cool, and occasion
ally publishing a long list of "don'ts" intended to in
duce them to abstain from things, thoughts and ac
tions that tend to superheat the blood and produce
prostration.
A specimen illustration of the weather reports of
that section of the country and of the editorial com
ment upon it is furnished in a recent issue of the
New York Tribune. In its news columns it headed
a long array of names of persons killed or pros
trated on the streets the dayrbefore by saying: "It
was intensely hot yesterday. It was the hottest day
of the year. The temperature ranged between 71
degrees at 6 a. m. and 94 at 4 p. m. The record for
the year previous to yesterday was 91 degrees, re
corded on May 20. Ten deaths and thirty-six pros
trations were reported. According to the Weather
Bureau there is relief in sight to-day. The forecast
made public last night was as follows: 'Friday,
fair, followed by thunder showers in the afternoon or
night. Saturday, showers and cooler. Variable
winds.* ' The deaths and prostrations follow."
The deaths and prostrations that follow make a
fearful list for a single day in a single city. It is
worse than a battle during the Spanish war. Edi
torially on the same day the Tribune began a long
list of "don'ts" by saying: "Don't hurry; don't walk
on the sunny side of the street; don't wear a heavy
black hat and thick, stuffy clothes; don't drink al
coholic liquors, or beverages rich with sugary syrups,
or ice-cold water; don't wear a high, tight collar; don't
fill your stomach with rich, highly spiced carbona
ceous food; don't worry; don't swear at the weather
forecaster â he is doing his best."
Thus the advice runs trippingly on from "don't" to
"don't." The list is long, varied, glittering, learned,
incisive, picturesque, ascetic, charitable, pitiful, pro
voking and slightly fatiguing. Indeed, when read in
the sweltering heat of New York it must have been
very fatiguing, and one can readily conceive a reader
saying with a gasp for breath, "This makes me tired."
Despite the "length and the variety of the list, how
ever, it is by no means comprehensive. The most im
portant "don't" of all is omitted, which inclines one
to believe that the writer himself was prostrated be
fore he completed his article. The omitted "don't" is
just this: "Don't stay in the East. Go West. Don't
swelter in New York. Go to San Francisco and get
vigorous." If our Eastern exchanges would impress
that "don't" upon their readers there would be less
suffering over there and more happy people over
here.
AN OMITTED "DON'T."
In all the relationships of life it is conceded that
one good turn deserves another. This may remind
Fire Commissioner Parry that since Mayor Schmitz
had temerity enough to whitewash him when the
operation was necessary in the cause of public de
cency, Commissioner Parry ought now in the same
worthy cause to apply the whitening brush to Mayor
Schmitz.
When the progressive devices of New Zealand were
boasted as a solution of all social problems other
countries were emboldened to persist in experiments
already in action for the application of academic
theories to the affairs of life. The postal telegraph in
England had long been a Government business ac
tivity. The advocates of government ownership in
this country, emboldened by the seeming success of
artificial devices in the antipodes, pushed their de
mands. Now it transpires that the British taxpayer
is getting tired of supporting the postal telegraph.
Last year the telegraph deficit was $4,753,700. This
deficit was mostly produced by yielding to aggres
sive demands for an increase in wages and safaries.
The English telegraph employes have a vote and use
it to coerce politicians into an increase of pay, to be
granted without regard to the quality or quantity of
their work. With this large deficit they are asking
for more and reject the offer of the British Post
master General to submit their demand to a com
mittee of business men, preferring to go directly to
Parliament, where, by political influence, they are
sure to win, as they always have.
Much has been heard about the cheapness of tele
graphing in England. But, cheap as it is, a vast
majority of the taxpayers make infrequent use of it,
or none at all. Yet by taxation they pay the bills of
those who do use it. This seems to be one of the
evils of government ownership. It indicates that
justice requires, if such ownership is to prevail, that
all public utilities owned by Government should be
bonded and interest and 'current expenses should
be charged to those who use them, in the price of
such use, so that the non-user will be freed of their
support. As it is difficult to find a public utility that
is used equally by all taxpayers, this is the only just
system. By this and a proper system of accounting
it will soon be demonstrated whether Government
can carry on business as successfully as an individual
or a private corporation. "
Government ownership has been propagated so far
exclusively upon the idea of its superior cheapness.
Any degree of cheapness can vbe reached when de
ficits are met by general taxation. The case may be
very different when each utility has to be maintained
only by those who use it. For instance, if the Eng
lish postal telegraph had been maintained last year
only by its users their telegraphing would have cost
them $4,753,700 more than it did, and the burden of
that deficit would not have fallen upon the tax
payer.
Having abandoned the natural adjustment of pro
duction by competition and the fitting of the cost
of necessaries to self-adjusted wages, it has at last
dawned upon the people that artifice has made their
condition worse than it could possibly have been had
artifice been avoided in the first place. The Employ
ers' Association first took action and denounced the
system as not beneficial but injurious. Then fol
lowed a meeting of labor unions and socialists,
which discussed the system and condemned it by
vote.
NEW ZEALAND acquired a world- wide repu
tation as the land where there were no strikes.
This was ascribed to the compulsory arbitra
tion. The arbitrators depended, immediately or
proximately, on politics for appointment to their
office. The system was vehemently demanded by
the labor unions, whose membership included only
one-third of the working people of the colony. But
they were organized and formed a compact body of
voters in politics. They got their arbitration board
and then immediately began aggressive demands
upon it.
Outside the success of these demands was taken
to be evidence of the success of the system, and so
cialist and labor union writers have spread abroad
the idea that New Zealand was an industrial paradise,
where everything flourished. A Wellington corre
spondent of the London Times joins many other ob
servers in giving the other side of the picture. The
colony has only 750,000 inhabitants. Careful ob
servers were always cautious about accepting results
of such an experiment in a small community as evi
dence that its principles applied to large countries
would produce like results. In mechanism many an
inventor has produced a model that worked beauti
fully, as a model, but failed utterly when put to a
larger, practical use. So thinkers looked on un
moved at what was claimed to be the success at
tained by New Zealand, as a model, and felt no haste
to apply the principle to the greater work of the
world. Now evidence accumulates that the model
has failed, as a model.
Through politics organized labor succeeded so well
in its aggressions that a reaction has set in. The
wages of labor have been so advanced as to make
production unprofitable. Manufacturers find that
products can be imported cheaper than they can be
made, and are closing their plants. Organized labor
is being thrown out of employment because capital
will not invest in enterprises and abandons those that
were established.
One effect of the system is of local interest just
now. Beginning with the first arbitrary advance in
wages the cost of living rose also. When that oc
curred a demand was made for another raise in wages
and was granted, as being necessary to level up the
purchasing power of wages with the rise in the
necessaries of life. No sooner did this succeed than
the cost of living rose again. The erection of houses
cost more, and rents went up. AH production was
made more costly and it took more to live. A natural
law was in battle with artificial regulation, and nat
ural law won, as it always does. At last production
in many lines has become so costly that it is ceasing
altogether, and labor is thrown back upon the pub
lic works and pensions, which have to be supported
by taxation. Again, a rise in taxes means a rise in
the cost of living, and natural law gives battle once
more to artificial device.
ANTIPODAL EXPERIMENTS.
within recall they would be justified in attacking her
and driving her across the Yalu River. But they are
not there. She astutely figured on getting them out
of the way and succeeded. Having been foiled in her
scheme for forcing China to part permanently with
Manchuria, she now demands that all other foreign
ers be excluded from that province .for six years,
promising that at the end of that time they may be
admitted. This is an impudent and insufferable prop
osition. It means, even if kept in good faith, and
there is every reason to <_oubt that it would be, that
Russia shall have six years in which to entrench her
trade and military position and Russianize the prov
ince.
It is to be hoped that Japan will feel able to take
the initiative against this Muscovite iniquity, and all
the rest of the world will rejoice if she give the
brutal bear the drubbing he has earned. It is un
likely that the United States will have occasion to
interfere. But if our hand become necessary in such
a war, there is no nation that ought to feel its
weight more than Russia.

Sunday, July 13.
The applications will be passed upon by
the Supervisors to-morrow afternoon at

Ryan's application states that the ferry
boat systems have no franchise of their
own: that they are part of the eptlre
railroad system, and that it is well known
that the State Board of Equalization has
and will assess the entire property and
franchises of the corporation.
The reductions asked for by the South
ern Pacific Company are as follows: One
half of the franchise of the narrow-gauge
ferry system, $250,000; one-half of the
ferry system of the broad-gauge route,
$800,000.
The petition asks that the respective
franchises be reduced to the sum of $20.
The Heine Piano Company, assessed for
$16,294. filed application for a reduction
of $10,000. The company alleges that its

It is known that neither one of the
travelers had any money, and it is prob
able that the pair are at present in Oak
land or in the vicinity and are concealing
their whereabouts.
Despite the protests of Mrs. Reynolds,
the two young persons often have met by
secret engagements.
On Monday, June 29, after leaving
Marks Bros.' store, she met Mendoza and
the two proceeded to the girl's home, at
the Junction of Pacific and Jones streets.
Mr. Reynolds intercepted the pair and
demanded that he ceaso his attentions to
Miss Reynolds. Mendoza made some ob
jections and a fight ensued wherein Rey
nolds received some injuries. He then
returned to his home and Mendoza and
the daughter went in tho opposite direc
tion. Since then the Reynolds family
have not seen the daughter.
In her efforts to find the missing girl
Mrs. Reynolds received information that
her daughter Josephine had told a girl
acquaintance that she was going to Los
Angeles with Mendoza. Mrs. Reynolds
also learned from Henry Mendoza, a
brother of the missing young man, that
Mendoza had Informed him that he was
going to take Josephine to Los Angeles
and that the girl would leave on the boat
and he would beat his way down on the
train. * ?
Miss Reynolds has always lived with
her parents at 1716 Jones street and has
been employed for a few months as a
saleswoman at Marks Bros., on Market
street. A year ago last March she at
tended a party given by onÂ© of her
friends, and it was there that she became
acquainted with Vincent Mendoza, who
was at that time employed as a driver for
E. E. Geisel, a grocer at 1205 Stockton
street.
Vincent Mendoza, aged 19 years, is
still missing and no positive information
as to their whereabouts is known.
The mother of the girl is grief-stricken
and has had a warrant for the arrest of
her daughter issued, so that every effort
will be made to locate the missing couple.

SAN FRANCISCO GIRL WHO
HAS BEEN MISSING FOR
SEVERAL WEEKS.
Peters Is a heavy loser by the flre. He
was not insured. Loudon's loss Is covered
by Insurance.
A peculiar thing about the fire was that
it poured out of the front entrance and
ignited the woodwork on the outside of
the house. Eventually it played havoc
with the interior of the cafe.
Two causes are assigned for the flre.
One is electric wires being crossed and
the other that It was caused by the negli
gence of R. Loti, a helper in Peters* cafe.
The cafe proprietor lays the blame on
Ganuchl, his Japanese helper, who drop
ped coal oil over the draperies that cov
ered the piano. The real cause, according
to the firemen, was the negligence of one
of the guests of the cafe. It is charged
that this unknown person entered the
cafe for breakfast and laid a lighted cigar
on the piano. This ignited the draperies.
The guests suffered heavily by the flre.
Valuable bric-a-brac, jewelry and cloth
ing were destroyed or ruined. Miss Louise
Rosenberg of Los Angeles suffered a
heavy loss. Miss Sadie McClellan was
glad to escape with her life. She suffer
ed the loss of valuable wearing apparel.
W. D. Kelly attempted to elide down the
water pipe and was pulled into a room
by W. M. Lou'don, proprietor of the hotel.
Kelly wanted to jump from the window,
but was prevented. He subsequently es
caped from the building by means of a
ladder raised by the firemen.
Chris Peters was confined to his bed in
the rear of the cafe by illness. He was
carried out of the place by a rear win
dow. Mrs. A. F. Wood had to make her
escape as best she could. She was highly
excited and was forcibly carried down
the ladders by the firemen. E. C. Epps,
another roomer, had time to put on his
clothes and leave the house in good or
der. He assisted his fellow roomers to
escape from the place. B. E. Prlen oc
cupied a room immediately over the cafe
and he was awakened by the crackling
of flames. He made a hasty retreat from
the place.
Before the flames could be extinguished
the building and contents were damaged
to the extent of 510.003. Many of the
roomers lost their clothes, but all were
thankful for escaping with their lives.
The cry of "Flre" rang through . the
halls. The guests were rudely awakened
from their slumbers and hurried from
their rooms! Doors were broken open by
the police and firemen in order that no
person might be burned. -The hallways
were filled with smoke and the flames
added a lurid effect to the scene. Many
of the guests grabbed their valuables and
rushed from the building. Others only
managed to get a few articles of clothing
and dressed themselves on the street.
"Terry McGovern" Gaines, electrician of
the Olympic Club, succeeded in making
his exit with a bathrobe and a Panama
hat. When danger was past and there
were no more lives to save Gaines re
turned to his room and removed the rest
of his apparel.
NARROW ESCAPES.
The fire started in Peters' cafe at 6:25
o'clock. It was discovered by Jordan
Hall, a cook employed in the restaurant.
He was warned by a Japenese that the
draperies on the piano in the front part
of the eating-house were burning, and an
effort was made to extinguish the flames,
but without success. Police Officer Fen
nell was in the vicinity and turned in an
alarm. By the time the flre department
arrived on the scene the flames were
mounting to the roof. Chief Sullivan
saw the danger to the inmates and sur
rounding Â¦ dwellings and immediately
turned in a second alarm.
STARTS IN CAFE.
Miss Viola Waters had a thrilling expe
rience yesterday morning during the pro
press of the fire in the Ashworth, a room
ing-house at 320 Mason street. She was
awakened at 6:30 o'clock by cries of flre,
and became bewildered and rushed
through the smoke-filled hall. Unable to
find her way out, she ran toward a win
dow In the rear of the building and gazed
down into the lot^ two stories below. The
fire escape had been cut off by the flames
and It seemed the only way to leave the
burning building was by Jumping. As she
Btood In the window, her hair streaming
and her face filled with fear, she cried
for help, and the firemen below, unable
to reach her with ladders, warned her
not to jump. The life net was quickly
brought, but the woman would not wait
for It. With one despairing look at the
flames around her, she jumped and was
caught in the arms of members of the
company. She was greatly freightened
by her experience and was taken to a
place of safety by friends. Clothes were
furnished her and later she was telling
her friends how she jumped from a sec
ond-Btory window to safety.
Hers was not the only exciting escape
from death. The fire was sudden and It
came at a time when all the inmates were
asleep, and many of them had to leave
their rooms in a hurry. Scantily clad men
and women rushed from the building.
Many had to be assisted down the ladders
by firemen, while others slid down the
pipes. The excitement was intense, and
but for the prompt assistance given by
the firemen and police many deaths might
have been recorded.
APPOINTMENTS ARE MADE.

The Board of Education held a meeting
yesterday afternoon, the first in some
weeks owing to the absence of two of the
School Directors. All the Directors and
Mayor Schmitz were present.
Superintendent of Schools Langdon filed
a report dealing -with the compulsory edu
cation law passed by the last Legislature.
The Superintendent showed that accord-
Ing to the last school ceneus 13,671 chil
dren between the ages of 5 and J7 years
had not attended any school during the
last school year. Of this number it is es
timated that one-half were between the
ages of 8 and 14 yearsâ the age established
by the recent compulsory net.
The total enrollment of school children
for the last year was 52,966, and tha aver- .
age dally attendance was 36,965.
The report classified the children who
must be dealt with under the new law as
children that have no aversion to school
and that work for a living or remain at
home, and truants that roam the streets
and acquire vicious habits.
TO ENBOIiIi TRUANT OFFICERS.
The Superintendent recommended that
the board form a staff of "attendance of
ficers," whose duties will be to Investigate
and report on all truant children and
those that do not attend school. He'pre
sented statistics showing the number of
"attendance officers" in the large Eastern
cities.
The Superintendent then presented the
following recommendations to the board:
That five attendance officers be appointed.
That the city of San Francisco be districted
and an attendance officer be assigned to each
district.
That the work of enforcing: the compulsory
education law be commenced with the coming;
term, the Superintendent of Common Schools
being directed to organize and supervise tho
work of the same.
That a day truant school be established as
a place for the special training of truants and
lnconiglblea between the ages of 8 and 14.
That In such school shall be taught the reg
ular studies laid down for the public schools,
special emphasis, however, being laid upon
manual training, physical training, military
drill and music.
That the Board of Education provide a
teacher of rare personality and teaching ability
to direct the work of such school at commen
surate pay.
That a room or email building with large
and somewhat Isolated yard space be provided
at or near some manual training center for
the purposes of said school.
That the term of such school be that of the
regular schools, and that the dally hours be
from 8:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m.
That the children committed to the school
by the Superintendent on the consent of the
parent be committed on an indeterminate sen
tence with the privilege of parole and return
to the regular school rooms as soon as they
seem fit.
That this department gather careful truancy
and -non-attendance statistics during the com
ing year, as a basis for the future provision
of euch additional agencies, parental boarding
schools, etc., aa may be necessary for the best
enforcement of the act designed to protect the
educational rights of children.
The board took the recommendations
under advisement.

There is nothing that will so 6urely nnder

afiection of the nerves is sufneiect to bnng
abort this distressing condition and unless
treatment is at once bezun it crows worse
rapidly, brincing^ about loss of appetite, in-
digestion, a gradual undermining of nerve-
force and vitality, until finally the victim
suffers from nervous prostration. Dr. Miles'
Nervine quiets the nerves so that sleep may
come and fortifies the nervous system against
'the attacks of any or all ncs>-ous disorders.
T have been troubled greatly wtih sleep-
lessness end nervousness for twenty-fire

thii I can say that my general health is much

NATIONAL LEAGUE
NEW YORK, July 15.â A fair sky and
a splendid racing: breeze of fifteen knots
greeted the two Shamrocks when they left
Sandy Hook early to-day for another trial
off theMlghtship. Sir Thomas Lipton had
hoped to give the boats a race over a
thirty-mile course, but his advisers, in
cluding George Ratsey, his ', sailmaker,
were not satisfied with the set of Sham
rock Ill's mainsail, so that part of the
trial was devoted to jockeying- about the
Erin and about the Scotland lightship to
watch the boat's mainsail.
After that the new Shamrock led the
old Shamrock a reach from the Scotland
to the Sandy Hook lightship and back,
eight miles, and beat her about a minute
and a half. Just before she reached
Scotland lightship returning a masthead
runner block on Shamrock III fell, but
no other damage resulted. A new block
will replace the damage.
To-night the New Tork Yacht Club
gave a dinner to Sir Thomas Lipton ' and
Designer Fife.

It is a matter of comment that good
odds are laid against nearly all of Odom's
winning mounts. He is regarded as the
best all around rider on the turf at the
present time. "With Young Henry he espe
cially earned the plaudits of the crowd,
for he never sat still on that horse and
was hard at work from start to finish.
The pacemaker, Demurrer, and Shotgun
both tired near the finish, and Young
Henry, a game horse, thus won. Flying
Buttress came from very far back and
was second.

LOXDOX, July 15. â Embaasador Cheat* and
Thomas Humphrey Ward travelled the busts at
Emerson and Martlneau at the Passmore Ed
wards settlement this afternoon.
Teddy Wolfe, the hard-hitting welter
weight of the Ariel Rowing Club, re
gained his lost laurels by defeating his
former conqueror, "Bough House" Billy
McDonald. In a furious four-round go at
Mechanics', Pavilion annex last night. The
men furnished the main attraction of the
Bay City Club's amateur exhibition. The
event was the best that has been pulled
off in this city for many moons. The
house was packed to the doors and the
crowd waa on its toes from the time. thÂ»
first bout began till the last was ended.
The Wolfe-McDonald mill attracted a
deal of attention, for the men are consid
ered the fastest amateurs In their class.
McDonald knocked Wolfe out at their last
meeting, and consequently some feeling
existed between them, and !t is safe to
say that last night's close bout did not
settle their differences. In the first round
McDonald started to do his Tushing tac
tics and he bustled his opponent around
the 'ring in a lively manner. It looked aa
if he would win If he could keep up this
pace, but in the next round Wolfe came
up strong and began to go the pace at A
swift gait.
The crowd yelled vigorously aa tlvo men
separated in this round in a whirlwind of
blows. In the third It waa much the
same, except that McDonald came up a
trifle stronger and made a fast finish. ThÂ«
fourth was a yarrtcane, with Wolfe doing
all the leading and landing the hardest
blows. He was awarded the decision
amid the mixed cheers and hoots of the
crowd. Many thought McDonald had the
better of the go.
Lew Powell, .the clever bantam, had lit
tle difficulty in disposing of Jim Kane in
two rounds. Both boys were In fine form
and fought every- minute of the time.
Powell clearly outclassed his man and
scored the knockout by landing two
heavy wallops on Kane's Jaw Just aa the
second round was about to close.
Gus Koster, the veteran heavy-weight,
had hi3 bands full for three rounds with
a newcomer named Jim Fox. Fox sur
prised alljthe spectators by starting right
at Koster at the beginning of the bout.
The first two rounds were all his and ha
had his opponent In distress. In the third
he began to weaken, and Roster's expe
rience stood by him. He worked hla man
Into the corners and landed many body
punches* that weakened Fox. In the
fourth Fox was tired and almost In, bnt
he gamely stuck it out. The decision waa
awarded to Koster.
Al Elklns and Billy Howard furnished
four rounds of good, clean, fast fighting.
Elklns kept boring In on his man from.
the start, but the latter was game and
came back for more to the very last. On
several occasions he was almost finished,
but Elklns never could get in the final
blow, so he had to be satisfied with the
decision.
In the second round of their set-to Jack
HugheÂ» stopped Charley Taylor with a
fierce punch on the Jaw. Taylor put up a
fast fight while he lasted, but Hushes
was too good a ring general and finally
wore his man down.

The change that came over the home
team in the little set-to at the Eighth
street lot yesterday afternoon was pleas
ant to behold. At least it was pleasant
to all save Mike Fisher and his men.
They were the sufferers and they suf
fered badly, for the natives had the goods
on them from the call of time and the
finish was 9 to 4.
Those tossers in the employ of your
Uncle looked like a different bunch from
the ones that suffered a shutout at the
hands of the Senators on Tuesday. They
were lively on the bags, strong with the
wood and could field anything that hap
.pened to skip over the green diamond.
They won all the way and only gave the
Senators one chance. They started In
during the first round to beat a tattoo
against the leather which the accommo
dating Mr. Fitzgerald was kind enough
to pass out. Three solid bingles, of the
old-time order, did the run getting act
and when the dust of the inning had
faded away the locals had about as many
as three on the boards.
Nor did they stop even there; they
landed' again in the third, fifth and
seventh, one at a time. Then the Sena
tors got started in the eighth and threat
ened to create a deadlock. But when
they had finished and made four the lo
cals started out again and eased three
more runs over the plate In their half of
the eighth, so it was really and truly all
over then.
'Twas a brave rally that Mike Fisher's
warriors started in that eighth spasm.
First they loaded the bags with runners.
Then Charley Graham came through
with a large and Juicy two-cushion swipe
that scored two.
The excitement began to run high.
Only one was out, so Hogan was sent in
to bat for Fitzgerald. But "Hogey" only
had a' foul that Pabst cornered and it
looked bad. Casey was right there with
a single past third and the last two regis
tered.
It was unlucky (or Mike that he took
Fitzgerald out of the box, for his suc
cessor, Keefe, was a pie for the locals.
They immediately started in to go a few
with the club and walloped tho ball all
over the lot in the eighth and brought
in three runs, which put an end to any
further action and settled the result of
the conflict for keeps. The score:

On her return Monday from a 'visit in
San Francisco Mrs. Wanzer found a note
In her rooms. It was. from her husband,
who announced that business forced him
to depart for Australia. With his disap
pearance, however, Mrs. Wanzer discov
ered that her wedding dress, diamonds
and other Jewelry had taken wings.
Since Monday the deserted bride has
heard not -a word from her missing
epousc. After consulting with friends the
distracted wife gave the matter into the
hands of the police.
The Wanzers were wedded in Los An
geles, the former home of the bride. She
met her husband while he was a travel
ing salesman for a pure food company.
At the end of two or, three months their
acquaintance ended In marriage.
Harry Brown, a dairyman af Fifty
ninth and Adeline streets, has disap
peared, under circumstances which lead
C. Gargardennec, his nephew,; to believe
the missing man is demented. Two weeks
ago Mrs. Brown left her husband because
of a quarrel. He was suffering from hal
lucinations, fearing that enemies were
about to attack him. To-day the nephew
told the police that his uncle had not been
seen at his home since Sunday.

thirty days after her marriage was the

F. S. Mitchell, a bookkeeper employed
by Eppinger & Co. and who is now em
ployed by Received Wadaworth to
straighten out affairs, was called as a
witness. He was questioned "closely but
could not throw any light on. the investi
gation. He said he knew nothing of the
affairs of the Pacific" Coast Warehouse
Company, as all his dealings were with
the grain firm.
Strong testimony was given against the
Epplngers by W. W. Topping, bookkeeper
for the warehouse company.; The witness
talked more freely than he dfu when be
fore the body a week ago. His evidence
was very damaging to the firm. '.
Emlle Besson and Calvin ; N. . Langton,
messengers employed by Eppinger & Co.,
were also called as witnesses. They were
unable to enlighten the Grand Jury. They
simply told how they ; had taken "ware
house receipts to the , banks and had
brought back 'the' money to .their em
ployers.
There seems to be a strong probability
that Herman and Jacob Eppinger, mem
bers of the ruined grain firm of Eppinger
& Co., will be Indicted by the Grand Jury
on next Friday. The members of that
body held a session last night and dis
cussed the matter at great length. No
vote was taken, but there was unanimity,
of opinion that the two brothers- had been
guilty of fraud and should stand trial.
Eernard Ettlinger, the third member of
the firm, will likely escape prosecution,
as the Grand Jury has. little or no evi
dence against him.
The Grand Jury was in session until
midnight last evening. A number of wit
nesses were examined, and District Attor
ney Byington was present to give the
members his legal advice and assistance.
When Foreman W. J. Bryan called the
body to order there were present J. Wil

FRESNO, July 15.â A wandering female
fortune teller and a little dusky-skinned

of days. The woman, whose name is Miss
Aula Moore, came here about three weeks
ago in a dilapidated old wagon and began
the rounds of the city, reading palms,
selling charms and giving exhibitions of
hypnotism with the little- girl as her sub
ject. She is a mysterious looking wom
an who drosses rather oddly.
MJss Moore had been here but a few
days when the attention of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
was called to the fact that the little girl,
who is not more than 12 years old, was
being used as a hypnotic subject at the
woman's exhibitions. Chief of Police
Morgan nr.d William Harvey of the so
ciety began an Investigation. They found
that Miss Moore had reared the child
from infancy and had dragged her about
the country, compelling her to lead her
own gypsy-like existence. The girl is ab
solutely ignorant of even the rudiments
of reading ami writing.
As a result of the investigation a war
rant was sworn to for the arrest of the
woman for cruelty to children and to-day
L A. Chester petitioned to be appointed
the little girl's guardian on the ground
that Miss Moore is not a fit person to
have charge of her..

Alameda claims to be the only city pos

an apartment wherein microbes are so
scientifically smoked Â¦ out of existence'.
Sanitary Inspector Eugene C. Maillot Is
the lord high executioner of microbes and
he officiates at a slaughter of millions

lects a sufficient number of books for the
execution of the death sentence. The
books fumigated "are those that are known
to have been read in sickrooms or handled
by patients afflicted with contagious dis

as a down-to-date method of decreasing

Deputy District Attorney Will Harris,
whose home Is at Pleasanton, eays the
sentiment Is strong against the rancherie,
which has been the scene of Innumera
ble stabbings and not a few murders. But
the Indians heretofore have been banded
together in a mutual league for self-pro
tection. Even when one of their number
caused the arrest of an assailant mem
ory would become very defective by thÂ«
time the trial was reached, and convic
tions havA been rare for that reason.
"With the Mariana woman in Jail, and
her arrest seems to have provoked her
followers as much as her knife wielding
aroused the other side, the peace offi
cers say the time* is ripe for a renewal
of the inquiry into the unsolved murder
mystery. ' Â¦Â»';â¢;
A rift in the cloud of mystery that has
covered the crime broke to-day at Pleas
anton. when a large number of the ranch
erie colonists appeared there in court
at the arraignment of Lopez Sanchez, onÂ«
of thejr number, who stabbed Robert
Silva during a jealous row about an In
dian woman. That quarrel had been fol
lowed by another. In which Magdalena
Mariana, a dusky denizen of the. red
men's rendezvous, plunged a knife into
Joseph Marshall and bit His hand serious
ly while he was trying to ward off tha
amazon's attack.
Miss Mariana was arrested this morn
ing and her case added to the anger of
the assembled tribesemen and camp fol
lowers. It was among the throng of In
terested and belligerent red men that
mutterings of vengeance were heard this
morning, and the whispered threats that
the secret of old Manuel's murder would
soon bÂ« disclosed. The authorities have
been seriously hampered in their work
heretofore because every move made has
been met by an unanimous declaration of
"I don't know" from the scores of In
dians that have been interviewed.
The last two cuttins: affrays have
aroused followers of the men who were
victims of tha knife- and there was no
doubt about the feeling that was arouÂ»ed
in the rancherie. Openly some of the In
dians said there would be confessions bÂ«
fore long. The authorities purpose to
strike while the fire. is hot. and to break
down vthe wall that has hitherto ob
structed them In their labors.
Out of a, series of stabbing affrays of
recent occurrence the peace authorities
of Alameda County are hopeful shortly
to get a clew to the murder of Manuel,
an aged member of the Mission Indian
coloney at Pleasanton. who was hacked
to death In his cabin about a year ago.
Efforts of the county officials, as well
as those put forth by the township offi
cers, have failed utterly to uncover the
murderer, although the District Attor
ney's office is confident that the knife
wlelder's identity Is known to many of
the Indians.

"Now," said he, "the person who wrote
this must have a cockeyed view of things,
indeed. I want to say that the instructor
is interested In the students, but when
he has to meet them every day, and so
many of them, It takes some time to get
acquainted all around. I'm doing the best
I can. And as for being bored by stu
dents, they certainly do not bore me un
less, of courseâ they happen to be bores.
; Of course. I don't know many of you from
Adamâ but, then, I'm not acquainted with
Adam either. I want to repeat that this
paper was written from a cockeyed point
of view." -^ .>\ .
The incident ended In a laugh, but the
offended teachers are not appeased and
they are still saying unkind things of the
Chicago professor.
If the ears of Professor Robert Herrick
of Chicago are not tingling from all that
is being said in denunciation of him by
the fifty or more women teacher-student*
taking work from him at the summer ses
sion of the University of California, It
must be because those tuneful appen
dages are Impervious to abuse, for they
are saying spirited things behind his back.
It amounts to open warfare.
Professor Herrick came from Chicago
to give instruction In the art of writing.
He is young, good looking and successful.
He Is also cynical, satirical and unmerci
ful. He has-: written some books
good books, tooâ and has reached that
point ' on the road to fame where he can
afford to stop and criticize consistently.
He believes that criticism of the hardy
sort is good for the soul, and since com
ing to the summer school he has given his
method full play, wherefore the murmurs
of discontent.
In his criticism of the"papers submitted
Professor Herrick has been unsparing. He
has not revealed the names of the writ
ers, but he has made them feel^ uncom
fortable. Many a story that, the author
fancied would land her among the Thack
erays and Dickenses and George Eliots
he has torn to pieces unsparingly.
At least one woman, a teacher-student,
has had the hardihood, however, to pro
test against the professor. She was of
fended "over one of Professor Herrick's
choice designations, and 80 waited a
chance for revenge. The chance came
yesterday, when he asked the students to
write\ a paragraph on any subject they
chose. The paragraph of this combative
student was written, submitted and read
in class to-day by Professor Herrick. In
substance this person, whose name is
kndwn to Professor Herrick only, writing
upon the subject of .pedagogy, -said:
"It is hard enough to be a poor school
teacher working for a small salary with
out coming to the summer school to be
treated as if you were a nonentity. You
come to the class and are made to feel
that no one has the slightest interest in
you, and you are not known from Adam.
If you happen to say anything you are
treated as if you were a bore."
All this was directed at Professor Her-
Tick. It was the complaint of a school
teacher cut to the quick. It also was a
grand opportunity for the target to in
dulge his satirical humor, and he did not
miss it.

"Who feeds his body starves his grief."
IThtre tnay be heart wounds difficult to
heal, but a well fed healthy body and
xnind softens the trouble greatly. A lady
cf Homer. 111., says: "About a year a^o
r*ty dear little four-year-old boy met with
an accident which resulted in his death,
and the anxiety and grief and worry that
1 <xj;trienced while watching bis stifler-
Jr.g and death resulted In my having ner-
vous r-rostration. I could neither eat nor
flecp, and I was soon a total, miserable
wreck, sick enough to die. .
"Then I was put on Grape-ICuts food,
taking a half-teaspoonful at a meal; the
amount was gradually increased until \
could cat c bout three teaspoonfula at a
time. I began to Improve almost imme-
diately, gaining strength steadily day by
Idcy until now I have entirely regained
health and am well throughout.
"Of course, my sorrow will never en-
tirely leave me, although- they say. time
heals al] v.ou'nds, but I am glad- to be
rtrons egaln mentally .and physically, for
1 can bear my burden better. I feel con-
fident that if I had not used Grape-Nats
I would never have been well again"."

Knocks Hole in Bow.
The Pacific Mall Company's steamship Bar
racouta. which arrived on Tuesday night,
knocked a hole In one of her bow plates yes
terday while docking at the company's wharf.
There wee a strong tide running and the vessel
was thrown with considerable force against
the dolphin. ' Her anchor-stock was driven
through one of the plates on the port side and
snapped off;
The Barracouta haa been away from here
about six months. She has been engaged be
tween the coffee ports of Central America.
While at Puntareras on June 22. on her way
un she encountered a very violent storm, in
the midst cf which a waterspout came whirl-
Ing In unpleasant proximity. The Newport
of the same line was also in port- and nar
rowly escaped an encounter with the waUr
column. which was finally disposed of by strik
ing the bow of an Italian ship. The bulk of
the liquid pillar returned to the ocean, but
enough boarded the Italian to fill the decks
with water to the- rails. It- did no serious
damage, however The Barracouta brought
only one passenger. She will be laid up until
tt"e next coffee season. : ',' Â¦*<

Matters of Interest to Mariners and

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
the Orient, from having a very
slim passenger list. The fact lhat the
rassenger travel to the Philippines is at
present a little Heavier than the monthly
transport service can accommodate ac
counts for the more than three score of
Government employes who swelled the
liner's passenger list to average propor
tions.
The Peking sailed yesterday on her two
hundred and forty-first trip across the
Pacific and when she. gets back will have
made 121 round trips between here and
the Orient. Nearly thirty years' service
has taken much of the life out of the
veteran liner and in her old age she is
developing a. tendency to loaf, which adds
to the popularity of the other vessels
making tha same run. The bark Annie
Johnson made better time between here
and Honolulu than did the Peking from
Honolulu hore. Since her arrival, how
ever, the steamship has been on the dry
dock and leaves port with a clean Ibot
tom. shining with fresh paint. This prob
ably will be the Peking's last voyage
across the Pacific, as by the time she
returns the China is expected to be ready
again for service.

PACIFIC MAIL COMPANY'S STEAMSHIP BARRACOUTA, WHICH KNOCKED A HOLE IN ONE OF HER BOW
PLATES YESTERDAY WHILE DOCKING. THE STRONG TIDE WHICH WAS RUNNING AT THE TIME
THROWING THE VESSEL AGAINST THE WHARF. \
Suits have been commenced by the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association
against the banks which cashed the
checks for the return of all the money
paid nn the paper and tney are now
pending in the courts. It is contended
"by the Building Association that the pay
ment of the money on forged indorse
ments of the payees' names leaves the
banks liable for the amounts in question.
The suits are of great interest to bank
ers and their outcome will be closely
â¢watched.
PINKEBTONSWOHK FAST.
The Pinkerton Agency was notified and
George Tichenor went from this city to
take charge of the case. He at once suc
ceeded Sn unearthing the gigantic frauds
that had been committed by the three
men and bv clever detective work suc
ceeded in apprehending Taylor and Chris
tie, who were bound over to appear be
fore the Superior Court In bonds of $19,500
apiece. He also learned that Masterson
bad left Los Anjreles in a private con
veyance on the night of May 5 and driven
to Capistrano. where, through a friend,
he disposed of several pieces of property
that were being held In fictitious names
'and received the rnoney for them. He
then went to Tia Juana, Just across the
Mexican border in Baja California, and
thence overland to Ensenada. Here he
caught a National Line boat to Mazatlan,
where he boarded a Cosmos liner to Ham
burg. This information was cabled to the
â¢Hamburg correspondent and Mastcrson's
arrest at Lunden Monday resulted. At
the time of his arrest Masterson had in
his possession foreign drafts aggregat
ing 12.500 marks, or about $4000 in Ameri
can money.
The bulk of the checks were caÂ«hed by
the Broadway Loan and Trust Company
the Southwestern National Bank and the
American Bank of Los Arpeles and the
money was paid to either Taylor or Chris,
tie. These operations continued more
than six months without detection. Final
ly the suspicions of the home office be
came arcused and on May 3 William Cor
bln, secretary and general manager of
the Continental Building and Loan As
sociation, and its attorney. Gavin Mc-
Nab. began an investigation in Los An-
Ereles. From the flrst they were con
vinced of the fraudulent nature of Mas
terson's transactions and swore out a
warrant for his arrest. This became pub
lic before he was apprehended and he
fled, while Taylor and Christie went into
hiding.
In October, I9Q, Taylor and Christie or
ganized a corporation known as the Na
tional Construction Company, its pre
tended object being to erect dwellings on
real estate owned by other people, the
same to be paid for on the installment
plan. Soon thereafter 'they took Master
eon into their dealings. Their rlrst'opera
tions consisted in building cottages on
unimproved real estate and through Mas
terson they would apply to the Continen
tal Building and Loan Association for
leans. The appraised value of the prop
erty would be much in excess of its real
worth and the amount of the loan would
exceed the entire value of the property.
These loans would be applied for under
various names and when allowed by the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion the check would be made out in the
name of the applicant for the loan and
pent to Masterson. The indorsement of
the payee would be forged on the back
-of the check and it would bÂ« presented
for payment either by Taylor or Christie.
Subsequently they negotiated loans for
large sums on bare lots, representing
them to be highly Improved.
The crime for which Masterson is
wanted is one of the largest and best
planned swindling operations ever per
petrated on the Pacific Coast. Acting as
agent for the Continetal Building and
Loan Association at Pasadena, he man
aged, in connection with A. J. Taylor and
Henry Christie, to secure $102,000 from the
parent concern, the sum being advanced
supposedly as loans on real estate in Pasa
dena and Los Angeles, which were recom
mended by Masterson in his capacity of
agent.
WHOLESALE OPERATIONS.
This information was received by B. F.
Kimball, local superintendent of the
Pinkerton National Detective Agency,
and at once communicated to District At
torney D. F. Fredericks of Los Angeles,
who requested Governor Pardee to notify
the officials cf the State Department and
request them to co-operate in Masterson's
detention. To-day Chief of Police Elton
of Los Angeles will leave for Washington
with a requisition for Masterson from
Governor Pardee and after securing the
necessary papers at the national capital
will sail fur Germany to secure his
priscr.er and bring him back to Los An
geles to answer lor his alleged swindling
operations.
William A. Pinkerton end his entire lo
cal force were in high spirits yesterday
over the receipt of a cablegram from their
Hamburg correspondent elating that K.
F. Mastcrscn, who is wanted in Los An
geles in connection with the swindling of
the Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation of Ban Francisco out of $102,000 by
false representations, had been arrested
in Lunden. Schleswig-Holstcin, Germany,
on a provisional warrant and would be
held until authority was received by the
United States Ccrsul at Hamburg from
the State Department to take him into
custody pending the arrival of extradition
papers.
At the meeting of the two last Tuesday
night Mahoney was drunk. He approach
ed Shelly, and an argument concerning
the union ensued, wherein Mahoney ac
cused Shelly of "standing in" with the
union and of having given the members
Information concerning Mahoney.
With these drunken thoughts on his
mind, Mahoney became highly enraged
and, whipping out a dirk knife, he attack
ed Shelly suddenly.
The men had lived in the neighborhood
for some time and were considered fast
friends, as they had been seen continually
in company up till one year ago, when
Shelly got marrfed.
Mahoney had the reputation In his
neighborhood and among the police of
being a dangerous man when he was
drinking.
Shelly and Mahoney had been friends
for b. number of years and some time
ago both joined the Glovemakers' Union
and were given employment In the glove
factory oÂ£ Blumenthal & Co., where they
worked together, for some J time. When
the elovemakers struck some weeks ago
both men refused to' go out and remained
at their employment. At the ending of
the strike both men were thrown out of
employment and dismissed from the un
ion and threats were made against them.
Shelly has . been employed at the glove
factory of Carson & Co. since, but Ma
honey had not been able to obtain work
and had been drinking.
Shelly and Mahoney had met frequent
ly, and Mahoney had hinted that he
feared the union men would do him bodily
harm.
The cause for the murderous assault
by Mahoney^ followed by his suicide, is
made plain by Shelly's statements to his
wife. ' w:"\?:.-V r S:^ ';;-!
Harry Shelly, who was seriously stab
bed by John J. Mahoney at Green and
Mason streets shortly after 8 o'clock
Tuesday night, was removed, from the
Emergency Hospital to his home at 1627
Mason street' at 10:30 o'clock yesterday
morning.
Although Shelly's wounds are serious,
It Is stated that he will recover.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Receipts of Hay again ran up. being 1089
tons, and the market was weak In consequence,
though there was no decline. Bran and Mid
dlings continued firm.
The circular of Somcrs A Co. says of Hay
"The receipts for the week Just ended show
a total of 3400 tons, in comparison with 3200
for tho week preceding. About one- third of
these arrivals have been by water. Hay deal
ers here are still receiving numerous complaints
from their shippers concerning the scarcity of
cars. The railroad company promises to rem
edy this evil at once, so when tho farmers are
through with their harvesting and are ahle to
turn their attention to shipping in their hay
we think that undoubtedly receipts will show
a marked Increase with a consequent declino
In prices. A very large part of the State's hay
crop was cut this year in districts where there
are no storage facilities. All this hay will
have to be shipped In before tho rains, and
this fact.' combined with reasons we have given
before, makes us believe more firmly than
ever that prices will soon be much lower than
they now are. â¢
â¢ "Practically the same conditions obtain with
the market as they did last week/ The rango
of prices Is the same, but should shipments be
come more plentiful prices would drop at once.
Tame oat hay, "alone, shows a change, prices
on this grade having dropped off about 60c per
ton. The choice grades of wheat and wheat
and oat are in good demand and they hold their
own firmly, with prices as they were last week.
Alfalfa still continues to come In but sparing
ly, as the farmers are njldlng their prices too
high for the present market.- It looks as though
they would have to com* down with their'fig
ures, as the dairymen vUl not pay such high
prices as sre being asked. .' Â¦ v- .

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, July 15. â Wheat showed strength
at the opening, although lt suffered a break
later. The close was weak at a loss of %#%c
Corn ruled steady at a decline from yesterday's
prices, September closing Y*@%c lower. Oats
were also steady, closing %c lower, while pro
visions were strong, showing a gain of from
40c to $1 12%.
Strong cash situation gave strength to
wheat, although at the start weak cables and
favorable weather caused a feeling of weak
ness. September opened %@%c to %c lower
at 77%Â©77%c to 77%c. Commission houses
proved good buyers at the decline and later
bullish advices from St. Louis and buying
orders from that point resulted in a better
tone and sent September up to 78%c. There
were fair offerings by commission houses and
the advance was not without its setbacks.
Just before the close long wheat, bought earlier
in the day, began to come out and the market
suffered a break in which it had advanced and
the gain was lost. September sold to 77c,
where it closed, at a loss of %@%c. Clear
ances of wheat and flour were equal to 360,019
bushels. Receipts from the Southwest and at
primary markets" were light compared with
last year. Minneapolis and Duluth receipts,
131 cars: local receipts, 68 cars, 19 of con
tract trade.
The show of strength in wheat held the corn
market steady and the local traders, who are
bearishly inclined, offered sparingly. Commis
sion houses supported the market throughout
the session, but were unable to save a break
at the close, when corn followed wheat. Sep
tember opened %c to %c lower, at 60%c to
60% c and closed with a loss of M@%a at 50%
Â®50%c after having sold up to 60%c and back
to 60%c. Local receipts, 183 cars, 10 of con
tract srade.
Oats were rather quiet but held steady and
within a small range. Influenced largely by
other reasons, and the close reflected the break
in a small degree. September was off %c, at
33%c, after ranging between 33%c, the open
ing figure, and 34%c. Local receipts. 139 cars
There was a spurt in lard Just before the
close when the price of that product soared
Provisions were strong throughout the day on
buying by brokers for the account of local
packers. Local receipts showed a falling off
but kept prices steadily upward. Late In the
session attention was turned to lard. Shorts
made a concentrated rush to co\-er and the

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
. Prices of new Potatoes were a little firmer,
an receipts were light - and the local demand
for choice stock was steady. Â¦ Small lots of
attractive stock In boxes, and sacks continued
to command a premium over . the maximum
rates. Old Burbanks were easy at the recently
revised quotations. The demand for seed pur
poses, is about filled. Onions moved off fairly
and prices were maintained.
Vegetables arrived freely and trading was
chiefly local in character. Tomatoes, Cucum
bers and -String Beans were In heavy receipt
and prices declined. Choice offerings of Green
Corn, Asparagus and Peas met with, prompt
sale at steady prices. Green Okra and Egg
Plant were offering freely and quoted lower.
The other vegetables stood about the same.

. Poultry and Game.
The receipts of domestic Poultry continued
large, and as retailers were well supplied the
market had an easier tone and prices for young
stock were generally lower. There was a fair
Inquiry for good heavy Hens and Roosters, but
small stock, such as Fryers and . Broilers, were
dragging. No more Western â¢ came in, but a
; car was reported close at hand and will be In

all more or less weak yesterday, saying that

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
rtÂ«I^ /T 181 ** 1 , w as amply supplied with all
descriptions of small orchard fruits and prices
had but little variation. Apricots. Peaches,
Pears. Plums and Prune* in small crates suit
ably packed for shipping, were in demand for
shipment north on . the Sound steamer but
! supplies were too plemlful to permit any great
advance. Basket fruit from the river was in
rather limited supply and cleaned up quickly
at good prices. Receipts of Apricots from that
section were very ll*ht and the season is
practically over. Offerings of . this fruit in
bulk were eagerly sought after by the canners
and only poor and small stock sold below $25
per ton. Well colored Gravensteln Apples
were In demand at $1 25@1 60 per box but
trashy Apples were neglected. Figs and Cher
ries were in moderate receipt and sold off well
The latter had a slight advance. Five crates
of White Nectarines, the first of the season,
were received from Vacavllle and were of
fering at $1 per crate. Several crates of
Fontalnebleau Grapes came In from the same
Place and sold nt $1 2501 00 per crate. Grapes
from other sections were generally of poor
quality and moved slowly. Melons were easy
at lower figures. Five more cars of Water
melons were in from Fresno. Berries stood
about as previously quoted, the demand for
choice offerings being steady.
Stocks of Mexican Limes are heavy and as
the demand Is rather slack, owing to the cool
weather, prices are easier. Oranges and
Lemons stand as previously quoted. A car of
fancy Valenclas came in yesterday and 6old
at J2 75Â®3 per box.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the de
parture of the steamer Sierra there have been
the following arrivals of coal from Newcastle
N. S. \V.. viz: the Hollywood. 2580 tons; Loch
Carron. 2941 tons; total. 5321 tons. ThesÂ« two
cargoes were much needed, delivery Â¦ of same
being made from ship's side to consumers.
Within the next thirty days we should have
sixteen coal arrivals from Australia, with
about 45,000 torn. All of these cargoes have
passed out of first hands, hence the market
will not be disturbed. There are still seventy
eight vessels on the chartered list to carry
coal for us from Newcastle and Sydney,
twenty-seven of which have already sailed,
and the remainder should all arrive here prior
to the end of the year. About 70.000 tons of
Japanese coal were negotiated for about sixty
days ago. 60.000 Â»f which will go to the
Southern Pacific, and about 20,000 tons to the
Canadian Pacific Railroad in British Columbia.
The delivery prices were very low. a,nd will
make an inroad Into sales of Australian. The
miners in British Columbia are returning to
work, and coal shipments from there will com
mence again In the near future, so that there
will be no scarcity for a few months for fuel
of all kinds, as the outlook Is that lower
prices should rule. There Is marked advan
tage for coal as a steam fuel In the future, as
producers of oil have materially advanced their
prices for future deliveries. Oil contracts are
being made at an advance of fully twenty-five
per cent., extending over a very long time for
future delivery."

Of the smiling: young- man, of the lady so coy?
For their manifest bliss there's excellent reason.

And they've found a fine home, for they put an ad. twice
In this paper's Want Pagre, with result that vou see.
And their hearts are now filled with most innocent glee.OFFICIAL.

The United States secret service men

keepers of passing counterfeit money
upon their customers as change. Many
complaints have been made recently to
Chief Ilazen and his assistants and they
have been on the alert to capture the of
fenders and make an example of them.
The opportunity came last Tuesday, when
a citizen complained that Yin Lo, proprie
tor of a ladies' underwear store at 111
Taylor street, had passed several counter
feit dollar pieces on his wife. Deputy
Thomas B. Foster took the cast; in band
and interviewed the lady. She said she
purchased a waist and leceived $3 2i> in
change from Yin Lo for the $5 gold piece
she gave him. On looking over the change
she found that one of the dollar pieces
was bad. She handed it back to Yin and
he gave her a good dollar, at the same
time putting the bad dollar into a differ
ent till from the one from which he had
taken the good money. Then she found
another counterfeit dollar in her hand,
and this also he exchanged, giving her a
good one for it. After she got home she
discovered another bad dollar and , in
formed her husband of what had taken
place.
Deputy Foster and the woman visited
the store yesterday morning and Yin de
nied that he had passed any bad money
on her. but admitted that he had sold
her a waist and had given her change.
He insisted that he did not know that the
money was counterfeit, but gave the
woman a. silver dollar. Fester saw in the
drawer another bad dollar under a piece
of paper and demanded it, and it was not
until ke had proceeded to demolish the
drawer that Yin and his partner consent
ed to surrender the spurious piece, i
Yin was arrested and charged with
passing counterfeit money.
