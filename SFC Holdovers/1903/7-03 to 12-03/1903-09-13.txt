Russia's the only one that doesn't want the other foreigners to go over to China and sell the people there a
lot of things they don't want Russia has a warm place -in' her heart for the Chinese. She wants to give the Chinamen
a good, wholesome, civilized government so they can be shot and burned if they don't give up their fool of a reli

THE ORACLE OF
MULBERRY CENTER
By S. E. KISER
NsJ-Â£ #*â¢\ . PEAKING of bull-pups that turned out to be terriers,
>S^f\fd naturally calls to mind the case of my old friend Jere-
WiN^yJ^a. miah Simpkins' son. There isn't a solider man in the
** ry~*&(S& Boston leather trade than Jeremiah, nor a bigger scamp
" n ~ f^ TO^^r at aw cant touc h tiian his son Ezra. There isn't
jU-^ -^rT^f^Jl an ounce Â°* rca l meanness in Ezra's whole body, but he's
g^>S5^|S!Â§232|P just naturally and unintentionally a maverick. When he
.r^grvfrtTES-^aa^: came but of college his father thought that a few years'
â¢ experience in the hide department of Graham & Co. would be a good thing
for him before he tackled the leather business. So I wrote to send him on
and I would give him a job, supposing, of course, that I was getting a
yearling of the steady, old, reliable Simpkins strain.
I was a little uneasy when Ezra reported, because he didn't just look
as if he had had a call to leather. He was a tall, spare New Englander, with
one of those knobby foreheads which has been pushed out by the over
crowding of. the brain, or bulged by the thickening of the skull, accord
ing as you like or dislike the man. His manners were easy or familiar by
the same standard. He told me right at the start that, while he didn't know
just what he wanted to do. he was dead sure that it wasn't the leather
business. It seemed that he had said the same thing to his father and
that the old man had answered, "Tut, tut," and told him to forget it and
to learn hides. â¢ -
i ' i-impkins learned all that he wanted to know about the oacking industry
in thirty days, and I learned all that I wanted to know about Ezra in the
same time. Pork-packing seemed to be the only thing that he wasn't in
terested in. I got his resignation one day just five minutes before the one
S which I was having written out for him was. ready; for I will do Simpkins
the justice to say. that there was nothing slow about him. He and his father
split up, temporarily, over it, and, of course, it cost me the old man's trade
and friendship. I want to say right here that the easiest way in the world
to make enemies is to hire friends.
I lost sight of Simpkins for a while and then he turned up at the office
one morning as friendly and familiar as ever.- Said he was a reporter and
wanted to interview me oh the December wheat deal. Of course I wouldn't
talk on that, but I gave him a little fatherly advice â told him he would
sleep in a hall bedroom all his life if he didn't quit his foolishness and go
back to his father, though I really didn't believe it. He thanked me and
went off and wrote a column about' what I might have said about December
wheat, and. somehow gave the impression that I had said it.
The next I heard of Simpkins he was dead. The Associated Press dis
' patches announced it, the Cuban Junta confirmed it, and last of -all. a long
dispatch. from Simpkins himself detailed the circumstances leading up to the
"atrocity," as the headlines in his paper called it.
I got a long wire from Ezra's father asking me to see . the managing
editor and get all the facts for him. It seemed that the paper had thought a
heap of Simpkins and that he had been sent out to Cuba as a correspondent
and stationed with the Insurgent army. Simpkins in Cuba had evidently
lived up to the reputation of Simpkins in Chicago. When there was any
From "Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His 8on" by Oeorg e Horace Lorteer.

news he sent it, and when there wasn't he just made news and sent that
along. f .r . .
. The first word of his death had come in his own letter, brought across
on a filibustering steamer and wired on from Jacksonville. It told, with
close attention to detailâ something he had learned since he left moâ how he
had strayed away from the little band of insurgents with which he had beta
out scouting, and, had blundered into the Spanish lines. He had been
promptly made a prisoner, and despite his papers proving his American citi
zenship, and the nature of his job. and the red cross on his sleeve, he had
been tried by drumhead court martial and sentenced to be shot at dawn.
All this he had written out, and then, that his account might be complete,
he had gone on and imagined his own execution. This was written in a
sort of pigeon, or perhaps you would call it black Spanish. English, and let
on to be the work of the eye-witness to .< whom Simpkins had confided
his letter. He had been the sentry over the prisoner, and for a small bribe
in hand and the promise of a larger one from the paper, he had turned his
back on Simpkins while he wrote out the story, and afterward had deserted
and carried it to the Cuban lines. '--^y
Â» The account ended: "Then, as the order of fire was given by the lieu
tenant, Senor Simpkins raised his eyes toward Heaven and cried: 'I pro
test in the name of my American, citizenship I"* Â¦ At the end of the letter,
and not intended for publication, was scrawled: "This is a bully scoop for
you. boys, but it's pretty tough on me. Good-bye, Simpkins."
The managing editor dashed a tear from his eye as he read this to
me, and gulped a little as he said: "I can't help it; he was neh a
d d thoughtful boy. Why, he even remembered to inclose descriptions
for the pictures!"
Simpkins' last story covered the whole of the front page and thret
columns of the second, and it just naturally sold cords of papers.- His edi
tor demanded that the State Department take it up, though the Spaniards
denied the execution or any previous knowledge of any such person as this
Senor Simpkins. That made another page in the paper, of course, and then
they got up a memorial service which was good for three columns. One of
these fellows that you can find in every office, who goes around and makes
the boys give up their lunch money to buy flowers for the deceased aunt
of the cellar boss* wife, managed to collect twenty dollars among our clerks,
and they sent a floral notebook, with "Gone to Press," done in blue immor
telles on the cover, as their "tribute."
I put on a plug hat and attended the service out of respect for his father.
But I had hardly got back to the office before I received a wire from Ja
maica reading: "Cable your correspondent here let me have hundred. No
tify father all hunk. Keep it dark from others.- Simpkins."
I kept it dark and Ezra came back to life by easy stages and in such
a way as not to attract any special attention to himself. He managed to
get the impression around that he'd been snatched from the jaws of death
by a rescue party at the last moment. The last I heard of him he was in
New York and drawing ten thousand a year, which was more than he could
have worked up to in the leather' business in a century.

2No person is allowed to ride free oa
trains except as specially provided for.
For instance, in Nevada and Arizona ths
Southern Pacific Company allows In
dians to ride on freight trains as muca
as they like. There are many reasons
why this Is allowed, among them betas
that the Indians are good track walkers
and, faithfully report any damage to tha
rails when they discover them. Old
Johnson Sides, chief of the Plutes In Ne

ever since the Central Pacific was built.
In early days the Ptutes rendered inval

informing them of washouts in winter
and helping to extinguish prairie fires ia

In order to protect themselves against
damage suits arising from accidents the
railroad company's rules are very strin
gent. No company will employ minors oa
train or yard service unless the minora
secure the written consent of their pa
rents or guardians. This Is done because
of the danger of the work. In like man
ner no person Is employed who has not
been rigidly examined by a physician of
the company to discover any defect* In

ception of the applicant. Many young
men are rejected on this account.

up and you had better climb aboard.
Foot short blasts means that the en
gineer wants information. He is attract
ing the attention of the conductor to get
a signal repeated or wants the semaphore
dropped at the roundhouse.
Everybody has heard two long blasts,
followed by two short blasts, which in
the code reads thus: â â 0 0. This
is when a train is approaching a public
crossing and. is a warning to teams to
look lively and get across the track.

When you are seated in a train and
you hear four long blasts don't get
alarmed, it is only the engineer calling
in the flagman from the west, while five
long blasts calls him from the east.
When a train is parted and the en
gineer becomes aware of it he immedi

this signal again and again until answered

cf the accident season, when the
train came to a sudden stop with
an awful v. renching and lurching
and screeching of air brakes, and won
der, as you gased apprehensively through
the dripping windows, why you were thus
detained miles and miles from nowhere,
and why the brakeman you had seen pass

lighted lantern under his arm was stand

cf fancy genuflections, instead of taking
that empty seat at the back of the car and
making himself comfortable, as every one
else was doing?
And when In answer to those self-same
lantern calisthenics the train began to be
have outrageously. , did you. ever try to
puzzle out the meaning of It all? For of
course there la a meaning, and a very dell
nitÂ© meaning at ,that- In fact, your very
life depends upon the precise and proper !
<Jip or curve of that funny little pot-bel
lied lantern, for Its slightest fillip is regu
lated by a code ofrules,' a" code so strict
that none may deviate In even the slight
est decree frcm the letter and law of
them, and withal a code that means vol
umes to those who understand It.- This
code is the easiest thing in the world to
master, when once you are given the key
to it. Every railroad employe is obliged
to know it thoroughly, but except for
these the railroad magnates sedulously
guard the signals from the great public
et large, so that this page is of special
value, net alone because it gives you the
very latest Information regarding the op
eration of a train, but because "it is infor
mation not easilv gained.
Of course every one who travels gets a
fair smattering of the rules and regula
tions that govern a great railroad, but
with a slight study on the subject they
can become conversant with every signal
that the conductor gives with his lantern
or with every jerk he gives ort the bell
cord. The shrill whistle of the locomotive
Is now only sounded in strict accordance
with a code of signals a:;d when a train
Is racing along across the continent it Is
in this way that the conductor and the
engineer keep in touch with each other.
In fact in this way they frequently carry
en abbreviated conversations.
With the exception of a few trunk lines
operating between Chicago and New York
all railroads in the United States have
identically the Fame cede of signals. They
are issued in book form and every em
ploye connected with the operative de
partment Is given a revised edition once
a year.
In reference to engine whistles the en
gineer has to be most careful that he
makes them distinct, wi*h intensity and
duration proportionate to the distance
that the signal is conveyed. Like the
Mcrse telegraph code the signals are con
veyed with long and short dots and
dashes
For instance, *'O" stands for phort
sounds and *" â " for longer sounds. When
an engineer gives a short blast. "O." thus,
it means stop. The brakeman knows he
must immediately apply the brakes.
Two long blasts, " ," thus, means
"release brakes."
One long blast. " ." and then three
short ones mean "flagman, go back and
protect rear end of train." This signal Is
generally given the moment the train
pulls up at some point not down on the
schedule.
The code of hand, flag and lamp sig
nals are thus:
When a conductor swings his lantern
across like In figure (a) a is a signal to
stop.
Raised and lowered as in figure (b) it
means proceed.
Swung vertically In a circle across the
track when the train Is standing as In
figure (c) the signal means back.
Swung vertically In a circle at arm's
length across the track when the train
Is running as In figure (d) the train has
parted
Swung horizontally In a circle as de
noted in figure (e) means apply air
brakes.
A lantern held at arm's length above
the bead when the train la standing as In
figure (f) means release air brakes.
As every one knows flags are used In
the daytime and lanterns at night, red
means stop, gTeen proceed, yellow pro
ceed with caution, green and white flag
stop. A blue flag by day or a blue light
by night means to an engineer that
workmen are about and to be cautious.
"Watches of train crews are examined
by Inspectors every night, for which they
receive a certificate, which is filed with
the superintendent of the division. Be
fore a train pulls out the conductor of
the train and the engineer must compare
time by their watches.
Possibly you have noticed flags placed
on the front part of a locomotive; you
have eeen them there, but do not know
what they mean. Two white flags placed
in front of an engine means that It is an
extra train. Besides the two white nags
two white lanterns are placed on the en
gine at night. This Is ?" ~wn in figures
1 and 2.
Two green flags on the engine running
forward by day means that there Is an
other section following behind and to
look out for it.
At night two preen lanterns are also
placed on the engine. This Is shown in
designs herewith.
Two green flags on the upper part of
the structure of the engine and two down
below near the cowcatcher, when an en
gine is running backward without cars,
or at the rear of a train pushing cars,
mean there is another section following.
At night the same meaning is signaled
by two green lights on top and two red
lights below.
The two green flags you see at the rear
end of a coach are there simply to show
the end or the base of the train.
At night two green lanterns are bung
out when the train Is running, and two
red lights when the train Is standing still,
as in figures herewith.
TRÂ» headlight of an engine la displayed
to the front of the train by night, but is
always concealed by the engineer draw
ing a shade over it when a train turns
out to meet another and has stopped
clear of the main track or is standing to

when you're perfectly frank."
"I wish you wouldn't go." he persisted.
"I want a promise from you before I
leave," she said. -"Don't go down ln your
catboat to-morrow to the picnic on Pop
lar Island with the fleet, will you?"
"Why?" he asked.
"It's high time we were taking the field
against Aunt Elizabeth. She counted on
our sailing down with you. I told her you
weren't going."
"And you're going back day after to
morrow," he said almost reproachfully.
"You must back my word." she said.
If it amounts to that I won't go," he
answered.
"Thanks. Good-night," she called and
was gone.
Fosdeck strode down the walk toward
the water. He was thinking of the girl
as she stood there on the veranda, the
moonlight on her copper-colored hair and
her dark eyes looking frankly Into his
own. Half way down to the water he
stopped suddenly and dug his too vicious
ly into the gravel.
"Oh. hang Aunt Elizabeth." he growled.
Fosdeck watched the fleet depart for
the island next morning, with them Miss
Martin and her aunt. He spent a miser
able day wandering about the woods be
hind the hotel. Late In the afternoon he
took the catboat and sailed down past
the island, where he eaw the fleet an
chored, and caught a glimpse of the
merry picnic party on the shore. Then
he sailed southward, and not until he
saw the fleet start for home did he turn
about to come back.
As he neared Poplar Island he saw
some one fluttering a handkerchief from
the pier. He ran ashore to find Aunt
Elizabeth asd Mlsa Martin on tho pier
head.
"This Is rare rood fortune," Aunt
Elizabeth said Ingenuously, as tnay came
aboard. Presently she found an excuse
to go below.
"Oh, what made you sail down past
here." said the girl, when they were
alone. "Aunt Elizabeth recognized tha
boat by a queer pennant you fly. OÂ£
course, ihen she contrived to hava us
left behind when the fleet sailed back,
and signaled you when you camÂ» along."
"Poor soul, I wanted to give her one
more chance," he returned.
"Let's go outside going back." sha sug
gested. "It'll be rough out there la tils

"Tour aunt," he began doubtfully.

Into tho strong breeze and rough water.

on the edge of the cockpit, her hair in

"Isn't this glorious?" she said. "I'm
almost grateful to Aunt Elizabeth for
once."
One little hand grasped the rail near
the wheel. Fosdeck watched It hungrily
and suddenly decided tha wheel needed
but one of his own brown hands. The
other closed over the littla hand on. the
rail. She looked up in surprise, but made
no attempt to withdraw it

"I'm glad, after all, it hasn't made us

"So am I," he asserted, with a fervor

"A trifle chilly, though, Gertrude, dear,"
her aunt said. "If you'll both excuse ma

"Oh. thank you, no," Aunt Elizabetft
returned. "I really don't know where

before I finally run it to earth."
As Aunt Elizabeth disappeared around
the corner the girl sighed resignedly.
"Oh, dear," she said, "it's too absurd.
She invariably stampedes within three
minutes after you appear, and her mo

Fosdeck laughed. "Her methods are
a trifle open," he observed.

William Fosdeck Stepped through the

of relief and a sense of duty done.
As he turned the earner to claim his
favorite nook some one called: "Oh, good

He turned and beheld 'Gertrude Martin

ifloried in It. His hair was cut a la Jo
fcann Most and his trousers had never
even Been his shoes, to say nothing of
having met them. His hat was of the
etanfiard soap-dish variety and his manly
throat was innocent of the clinging em
brace of a necktie.
Alfred had been shaken out of his na
tive tree by a philanthropist from the ef
fete East with a taste for collecting flint
arrowheads and other relics of the stone
ege; Alfred appearing to have all the ear
marks of a rough diamond, be had bid
fclra In along with the lot and taken him
East to have a little extract of culture In
jected Into him. After his hair had been
carefully manicured and a fifteen-dollar
cult of clothes had been hung on him he
was turned over to a dignified gentleman
Â¦with a black tie and a string of degrees
that looked like a hemorrhage of the al
phabet who was expected to chloroform
him and rub down some of the rough
places A bis Intellect
This was Alfred's first round with
the higher education tor which he
thirsted; we are led to believe that
thirst Is a necessary element In the
aforesaid higher education, at least in
the German kulturfests. Aside frcm
the thirst which he seemed to have in
herited along with his dislike of bath
tubs and other appurtenances of civil
ization, Alfred took to the culture-prop
osition about as kindly as a Governor
of Kentucky to undiluted spring water.
By degrees, however, ne came to see
the value of education. When the gen
tleman who presided over his intellec
tual destinies and made out the bills
pointed out to him that true greatness
was obtained only at the cost of much
cerebral perspiration; that no man could
wear a dress suit properly unless he
had a college diploma or was a waiter
in a German restaurant; that even the
President of the United States, the
chairman of the executive committee
of the steel trust, the gentleman who
mowed the lawn and shoveled the fam
ily Jewelry Into the furnace, and other
pillars of society were college gradu
ates; when the chief culture juggler
Indicated these things to him Alfred
gathered himself together and decided
that he would take a small portion of
the higher education on the half shell

After a sojourn of rour or five years
at the institution' presided oyer by the
gentleman with the black tie and the

There wasn't a feeling of brotherly love
between Silas and Reuben. Both wanted
to "run things," and naturally that
brought about a clash. Silas had some
thoughts of running for County Super -
of Silas Bebee, and Bat down to a boiled
dinner with him, and afterward held a
long and Interesting conversation. Mr.
Graves, as the stranger gave his name,
was one of tha partners In a big publish
ing house which made a specialty of pub
lishing the biographies of the old and
eminent families of America. The name
of Bebee, as he had discovered by long
and patient research, dated back to tha
year 90$ and had been , borne by princes,
dukes, counts, barons, poets and soldiers.
What Mr. Graves wanted was to bring
the Bebee biography down to Silas, and
let the world know that the family was
still on tap and as eminent as In days
of yore. The biography and the portrait
would be free, but in order to cover the
cost of the glue and the stitching Silas
would have to come down with J25 in
cash.
"I . don't think I'll trade," was tha re
ply when the caller had stated his case.
Mr. Graves seemed to have prepared
himself for Just such an answer, and he
turned away with:.
"Very well, i Mr.- Bebee. As you are tha
most prominent of the family I naturally
came to you first, but as you don't care
for the honors I shall go to Reuben. I
think he will jump at the opportunity,
being as he wants to be elected County
Supervisor next year. Good-day, Mr/. Be
bee." ' Â¦ - Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ '
Accordingly his discoverer launched him
into the glad wild swirl of college life
There for four long happy years he lived
the Joyous, care-free life that all old men
like to look back to and tell harmless lies
about. There he learned many new meth
ods of Imparting the proper shade to a
meerschaum pipe, how to make a welsh
rarebit with a handful of cheese,' a bottle
of dandruff cure and three bottles of beer
and also how to pass a hard examina
tion without revealing the unfathomable
depths of '"his Ignorance. The last Is the

the impolite variety on tap at the vil
lage barber shop â he could smoke a
bull-dog pipe and select his own clothes
without doing serious damage to the
regulations of the Board of Health. But
this was only the beginning. He had
been made aware by the few glimpses
he had had of the young men who were
favoring the colleges of the land with
their occasional presence that there
were a great many different kinds of
slang that he was not familiar with,
as well as a number of weird and as
sorted brands of trousers. . Clearly his
education was far from complete as
long as these heights still loomed above
him unattained. He â thirsted for still
more culture and other thtngs too num
erous to mention.
he could not have 'told him from Ward
McAllister, Harry Lehr or any other
bright and shining example to his kind.
The four years came to an end at last,
as everything does except trouble, and
Alfred was turned loose on an Innocent
and unsuspecting world, wrapped in his
diploma and an air of grand and unsubdu
able magnificence. ', He was educatedâ oh.
no doubt about it He knew exactly what
kind of tie to wear In the morning and
the exact variety of trousers that should
gladden the world in the afternoon. He
could wear a Prince Albert as one to the
manner born, nnd he was an expert wit
ness on the subject" of hats. Also, he had
a large acquaintance among the chorus
girls of half the theaters in town, and he
could order a dinner for four at the
Walledorff-Castoria without ever letting
the waiter susoect that In his early youth
he had orushed . his hair with a curry
comb and performed his morning ablu
tions in & tin pall. Running an automo
bile was as easy to Mm as running in debt
is to the average man, and he could pick

the way he spent money that he had been

was complete and he was fully as useless

truth that knowledge is not only power,

He saw her first upon a spring morning
full of hot, shining and languid ruffling
airs. Dew still sparkled on the grass, and
overhead in the green gold of new leaf
age robins fluted delicately the Joy of life
and love. To hU enchanted eyes Millie
embodied the shining, the bird song, the
softness of the south wind, the warmth
of the sun. What they said Is immaterial
âfor two hours they walked together over
the ragged lawn turf, or stood In rapl
contemplation of newly opened roses. And
then, in a safe seclusion of greenest
shade, he drew her within his arms and
kissed her. not lightly, but as one who
takes what is supremely his own.
Then followed a heavenly fortnight
Eustaca masterfully pushed out Â«f his
mind all thought that might mar this new
bliss. He rarely spoke his love, and after
that first kiss was sparing of demonstra
tionâthere was no need of it when each
understood so perfectly what was the oth
er's heart Yet at the end of every day's
comradery Eustace had a sense of some
thing impending, ever drawing nearer. He
refused to let himself, look further than
the next day's end, but somehow, some
where, he knew he would be called to pay
a bitter scot
His chiefest care was for Millie. No
harm must touch her. however It fared
with him. She was so young, bo Inno
cently gay. so innocently foolish, hÂ© was
doubly bound to protect her even against
himeelf. it was heaven to see her bloom
and sparkle at his approach; she left her
self so artlessly undefended, now and
again there cam* a Jump in his throat.
A man who could speak, who could even
think, lightly of her would deserve death
twice over.
So the Idyl drifted through hours,
sunlit and starlit Perhaps It was some
111 star In its course that brought home
Joe Cantrell, Millie's brother, who lived
out In the big world and knew Its ways.
He came unannounced. Just as dusk fell
down, making- his way through the de
vious side path all tangled with sweet
shrubs. When Millie met him a little
later her eyes were star-like, her cheeks
of damask bloom, but sight of her
could not win him from Icy anger. He
never explained anything. Tou will be
ready to go back wttb me two days
hence," he said, frowning heavily. Mll

toward the stairfoot As she was
mounting it. her brother said, with a
taunting laugh, "Next time you choose
to kiss and fondle a man, take care that
I am not In sight, or that he Is not en
gaged to marry another woman."
She knelt shivering by her bedside
until she heard him go out, after a
leisurely supper. And she was still
kneeling when he came In. stamping
heavily, well toward midnight. Ha
stopped beside her father's high black
secretary, flung down the lid with a
bang, then, after a minute, came up
stairs, still moving ponderously. But
his footsteps did not mask another
sound â the clicking of pistol locks.
Intuitively, she understood â ho had
strolled over to the Country Club, picked
a quarrel with Eustace, and would have
him out at daybreak next morning.
No thought of appeal to him stirred
in her. Instead there cams a firm de
termination matching his own. ShÂ«
knew her name had not been mentioned
In the quarrel quite as well as she knew
herself Its real root. The men must
not fight â she could not have her
brother's blood upon her conscience, still
less her lover's. There was but one
way to stop them â a way bitterer than
death â still (the set her feet toward it

watching, with noteless eyes, the wheel

at the first pale dawn light she was
tensely alive. Below she heard a
stealthy stir, the cautious opening: of
a door, with muffled voices and cautious
steps outside. She got up and crept to

grimly repeated a dozen times a day, and
Cape Cod was finally reached.
Then a gale sprang up. the big brig lost
her foremast, and though the red-headed
girl sought her stateroom and the crew
was left free to battle with the storm
the craft was driven ashore and became a
total wreck. Crew and passengers were
saved, and in due time Captain Barnes ap
peared at the office of the owners in Bos
ton to tell how it all happened. He was
listened to until he had finished, and then
the head of the firm handed him a letter
that had been received the day before. It
was from Martha, and it read:
"I want to report that the Daisy is
ashore on Cape Cod and a total wreck,
and I want to report that a red-headed
gal and a lot of fool-men are the cause
of It."
or shell get a piece of my mind that wiQ
make her red hair curl. I won't stand by
and see no such chit make fools of three
or four men who ought to know better.'*
The captain's advice was for her to'go
slow, and he was glad to* get on deck and
out of reach of her tongue. That was the
beginning of things. That night the red
headed girl walked the deck with a cap
tain on each side of her.

Barnes was aboard, and his crew num

Patsengers two American tea captains,
whose vessels had been shipwrecked
axaon* the West India Islands. If it
hafin't been that one of the captains of

red-hÂ«aded girl and sleep in the main cab-
In on a shake-down ehe could not have
taken passage by the Daisy. Indeed, it
was a doe* shave at best, as Mrs. Barnes,
who waÂ» fat. forty and plain-faced,
looked her over and eald to her husband:
"Joslah, she's red-headed, and * that
means that she's giddy and sassy."
"Yea, she's got red hair," replied the
captain. 'Taut I don't eee nothin' giddy
about her. Bhe look* aa sober as any
ral with any colored heir, and that pas
sage money will come in handy for us.
Bhe'll probably be seasick clear up to
Boston Light and not eat 12 worth of

"Well, we'll take her." said Mrs.
Barnes with a doubtful shake of the
head. *T>ut you see If it don't result in a
tornado, waterspout or calamity of some
kind. Red-headed girls are born to make
trouble."
A day later the Daisy weighed anchor
end set out on her return voyage, and the
e-ttltu.Ce cf the red-headed girl as she
moved about was so demure that the cap
tain almost felt like patting her on ihe
head and speaking words of sympathy
end encouragement. The brig sailed at
* o'clock In the morning, and the girl
passeng-er did not make her appearancS
at the table at noon. Mrs. Barnes' moth
erly heart forced her to look into the
stateroom and offer her services, but at
the same time she wu secretly glad to
find the red-headed girl In her berth and
apparently suffering the pangs of sea
sickness.
Something like a surprise party waited
the dame when supper time came round.
She was thinking of making a cup of tea
with her own hands and adding a slice of
dry toast when the red-headed girl sud
denly appeared in the cabin fully dressed
and looking as pert and saucy as if the
old brig rested in a cornfield Instead of
climbing up and down watery hills of ex
ceeding steepness. \
"La, but haven't you been seasick!"
exclaimed the captain's wife, after a long
stare.
"Of course not," was the reply.
"And you ain't going to be?"
"I hope not. Where are the gentlemen?
They must have missed me. I'm so glad
I'm the only girl aboard, as I will have
them all to myself. Do you know if both
captains are married men?"
"Yes, ma'am, I know that they are, and
each one is the father of at least 'leven
children." replied Mrs. Barnes, with great
emphasis, being determined to crush the
red-headed girl at the very outset.
"Well, they can flirt with me for a few
days, Just the same," eald the girl, as she
surveyed herself in the" cracked mirror
hanging- over thÂ« table.
At eupper the red-headed girl made
herself thoroughly "at home." She
laughed and chatted and made eyes, and
Mrs. Barnes could not help but see that
her own captain, as well aa the two
others were more than Interested. She
grew red In the face and her blood boiled

the girl had gone on deck, escorted by
the two other captains, she drew herself
up before her liege lord with folded arms
and demanded:

the bellboy insinuated apologetically, "Mr.

"No, I will not go down to the desk,"
Miss Halloway interrupted decidedly.
"That head clerk Parker/ or whatever

The bellboy departed promptly. "And

antly. Bhe did not hear the knock at the
door, nor its noiseless opening. Her
mother's voice startled her: "Belle, hers
is Mr. Parker, but rememberâ"
Mrs. Halloway's voice trailed off into a
deprecating silence. Miss Halloway
straightened up in her chair with tha
laudable pride of a Judge about to confer
sentence.
"Mr. Parker,'* she said impressively, "I
have called you here to complain of the
treatment to which we have been sub

Bhe dashed off a telegram and read It
aloud reflectively:

"I can agree with you. Miss Halloway

no better. At the Great Eastern first

with a half bow, "is why we have been
forced to give this room to â Miss Hallo

His tone was courteous, but the girl
felt the sting of underlying reproof. It
was a new experience for her. All her
twenty years bad not discovered a person
who should dare to cross her. The great
T. P. Halloway himself lacked the neces

couraged her willfulness as a reincarna

Mrs. Halloway, she was always a minus

firmness. She preferred to be comfort

Tears came easily, and In no wise inter

The clerk remained silent And now
for the first time Miss Holloway looked
up â far ' upâ and encountered the serene
gaze of his brown eyes.
Mr. Parker, the elerk, was tan-unusu

said sweetly, "let me apologize for hav

"Of course," replied Mr. Parkrr a tri
fle stiffly. He could not avoid taking her
outstretched hand. "Of course," he re
peated more heartily, as some mesmcrlo
Influence radiated from her finger tips
to his. There was added respect as well
as admiration In the brown eyes. He rec

Mrs. Halloway beamed noon them.
Peace and harmony were essential In her
scheme of things.
And peace and harmony â and Mr. Par
kerâattended her and her daughter for
the next few weeks. Mrs. Halloway
beamed. Miss Halloway was radiant, Mr.
Parker was assiduous. So assiduous. In
fact, that Thomas P. Halloway. on his
advent on the scene, felt called upon to
Interfere.
"Really, Miss Halloway." he said sooth
ingly, "the whole thing is a trifle which
we have foolishly exnggerated. In the
morning you will laugh at your fancied
grievances."
But still the girl's head was hidden In
her folded - arms and her shoulders
heaved. Mrs. Halloway sobbed, swaying
comfortably back and forth. "If your
father were only here," she wailed.
"Don't cryr Miss Halloway," he Im

"On your word of honor?" asked Miss
Halloway of Chicago, in a muffled tone.
"On my word of honor," he promised
recklessly.

her sex overcame her. But woman's wit
came to her aid. Her lips trembled pite
ousJy an<l two large tears ran down her

This was a new method of warfare. The
redoubtable Mr. Parker stood aghast.
Then, as became a prudent general, threw
out scout lines.
And thenâ well, they then forgot the
world and Its opinions to talk of far love
lier things.
When the maid ushered him In Natica,
looking rather more like a lily than usual
In her long, soft black gown, rose with
every intention of greeting him In the
most formal manner. Then a most un
looked for thing occurred.
For a moment they looked Into each
other's eyes. Then he stretched out his
hands toward her and she placed hers In
them. A moment later she was swept up
Into his arms as If she had been a child,
as he murmured softly, "My dear, dear
love."
"What shall we tell mamma?" wailed
Natica In despair a half-hour later. "How
can we ever explain ourselves?"
"We can't," replied Renwick, comfort
ably. "We might Just as well resign our
selves to being thought mad ! It all comes
from the ridiculous superstition that In
order to know people you must talk to
them!"
In the dim little parlor of the small
apartment where she and her mother
lived they met for the first time alone
save for the dead and gone Alstons that
looked down upon them from the walls.
Surely never was such a first meeting be
fore.
"What kind of a mystery is this?" In
quired Stoughton. "Jf I didn't know that
there Isn't a grain of romance in you 1

"Now, don't thinkâ there's a good fel

structions. Tell Miss Alston all about ma
âand mind that you tell her everything
good that you can or I'll wring your neck
âand make an appointment for me to
call. Don't make any mistake. I want to
see her. and see her alone. I don't want
you there!"
When poor, mystified BUI Stoughton
broached the subject to Natica her be
havior was doubly mysterious. No, she
didn't want to know anything about himl
Then a moment later:
"Did you say he Is a. bachelor?" (Inno
cently). "I thought he was a widower!"
Stoughton, Indignantly: "I thought you
knew nothing about him?"
"I don't; but he wore mourning."
"That was for his mother."
â¢ â¢ â¢
"Certainly. I'll take you up there with
me. Natica will be glad to receive any
friend of mine."
"Thank you. old fellow, thank you."
Renwick paused awkwardly. He seemed
to have somt thing else to say, but scarce
ly knew how to say it.
"When I saidâ asked you to introduce
meâ I didn't mean the usual thing. I'm
going to ask you to do something queer,
and to do it without asking too many
questions."
"It's Natica Alston â a cousin of mine,
you know," he explained to Renwick.
"Tough luck they've had, I tell you. But
she's a plucky girl. Bhe has earned her
own living now for four years."
"Will you present me?" demanded Ren
wick eagerly.
It was nearing the end of the third year.
He took the same train now with a reg
ularity which made her suspicious. The
results of chance were never bo unerring.
Intention was apparent.
But through it all, save at unexpected
moments when the curtain would lift for
a second and an unintentional glance be
tray a deeper knowledge, they regarded
each other with the baffling, impassive
eyes we keep for the unknown. No twen
tieth century romance ever moved eo
slowly.
Then Billy Stoughtonâ who In this par
ticular case was the Instrument of fate
â awakened one morning with an unac
countable but imperative yearning for
Broadway. Five years earlier an equally
compelling desire had landed him, on ThÂ«s
Ranch, where he had bided contentedly
enough up to that particular morning. The
evening of the next day found him in
Denver, from which place he proceeded,
with as much haste as the railroad facil
ities would permit, to New York.
On the day of his arrival he planned
to dine with Renwick, the closest of his
college friends. He had just time to
catch him by telephone before he left his
office, which he did, arranging to meet
him at the c-levated station and go up
town with him.
The fir3t ettervescence of their meeting
over, Sioughton's beaming eyes roved
over the other passengers. A flight fig
ure at the far end of the car held his
glance. He looked again to be sure.
"Pardon me a minute, Jack," he said,
rising and making his way toward the
girl, with whom a moment later he was
shaking hands cordially and talking with
the ease of long friendship. Presently he
returned to Renwick, and as he did so
a revealing look passed between the two.
A bridge at last! s
wai a fatalist. If It were written from
the bejrlnnlnx It would occur! No man
could dabble In the affairs of fate!
Sometimes, for two or three weeks at a
etretcb. they would not encounter each
other. It was after one of these breaks

her Interest and satisfaction at seeing him
again shone all unconsciously in her face,
and his glance was arrested by It.
As the faint color touched her cheeks
urder his gaze he looked causally away.
For a moment he had thought her some
half-forgotten acquaintance from the wel
come that he had surprised in her eyes,
but her quick annoyance as she returned
to her reading forbade that Idea.

more than once his keen blue eyes rested
upon her as ehe eat there, allm and

piled upon her small head. After this he.

no amount of love can bridge the chasm.
Strange Coincidence.
These three ladies, like all women of
their class, are superstitious and have
made up their minds that Beppo's election
to the chair of St. Peter has set a limit
to his life.
"If It had been next year the charm
would have been broken." said Maria,
"but now there Is positive proof that he
will die In 1912. Whenever the periods of
9 come I expect a change, and no one can

That Sarto Boy Stole Cherries,
The Pope's early training was all
against fitting him for his new position.
His younger years were spent in a coun
try village emld the most dire poverty,
his days passed In helping his parents
and sisters In their work or In trying him
self to earn a few cents from time to
time; cften hungry, although not really
lacking the necessities of life. The win
ter was the hardest period, as cold pene
trated the walis of the little two-story
house, clothing was Insufficient and he
bad to wear shoes and stockings, which
be bated. School was not even mentioned.
Education in those days, sixty years ago,
was certainly not compulsory, and even
his parents thought little of It. for many
peasants then, as now. could not even
ultra their names.
Beppo (diminutive for Giuseppe), how
ever had the fortune to attract the at
tention of the parish priest, who taught
him the letters and set him on the road
to learning, and. once started, he went
on by himself.
An old farmer of the district, now near
ly 90 years of ege, when told that Giu
seppe Sarto had been made Pope, ex
claimed:
"Not Beppo? Not that little rascal?
Many are the cherries be has taken off
nay trees, me underneath the tree with a
â¢tick and he bidding me defiance and
pelting me with the stones. The last time
be did It I caught his boot and a merry
dance we had about that field. But he
was a good chap. When my old woman
died and he was already Cardinal he for
got his dignity and helped me not only
with mosey, but with prayers. If I was
not so eld I would go and visit him at
the Vatican!"
Bishop Monaco took a fancy to the
bright boy and sent him to school, where
he was head and front of all the mis
chief. He then took orders, and thus the
career which was to end on the pinnacle
cf earthly success was Inaugurated. At
the age of 23 he was assistant to the par

ROME. Sept. 1.â "Oh. what a mis
fortune! My poor Beppo. who so
loved a comfortable chat! Who
knows what misery he will go
through In that prison there In
Rome?"
These were the words. Eaid with tears
and real rrlef. with which Maria, sister
ef Pius X, received the newa that he
had been made Pope, and they epitomize
the feeling of the family about this ele
vation of their "Bepoo" to one of the
most powerful positions on earth.
The Sarto family is humble, has never
teen arj-thir.e else and never will be
anything else. The members have no am
bitions above their station and, as yet,
are too unsophisticated to count on what
the Pontiff can do for them. His only
brother, Angelo. the day after Pius X's
election, was found in the little piazzi
cf the village of Riese, near Venice, lord-
In* it over his fellow peasants abd talk-
Ing about "my brother the Pope": but
when approached by even so humble an
individual iis a Journalist he subsided
BUddeuIy, like a pricked balloon, and be
came his usual modest self. Asked what
he would do now, he at once began:
"Do? Why heaps of things. Beppo is
now Pope, you know, and he will buy
out my rival in the village, and I shall
be cork of the walk. He may perhaps
buy in* a mule and a cart, or even a
horse and trap. That would be fine!"
**I have debts." he continued, with a
eigh. "*lf Beppo will relieve me of tham
that would be much. Yes. I must owe at
least forty dollars, and shall never have
It by myself."
This was as high as his ambition could
pour. He is one year older than the Pope,
and has so far been distinguished merely
for a sturdy independence: not above re
ceiving help and favors from his brother
when the brother could afford it. but ow
ing his present relief from real poverty
to bis own exertions. In his little poik
and tobacco shop are to be seen usually

years parish priest, nine years vicar gen
eral, nine years Bishop, nine years Car
dinal, and, of course, he will be nine
years Pope. And after that there Is noth
ing but heaven to attain, ao, of course,
he will leave us." And nothing would or
could persuade her to the contrary.
Meanwhile the Pontiff, for his part, is
not altogether happy in his "prison." So
far his entire time has been absorbed In
giving audiences and making appoint
ments, but the confinement has already
told on the strong, hearty man who does
not look much over 60. and he mlaaes the
care of his feminine relatives. A button
comes off, and there is only a man to sew
it on; his rooms are not well dusted, and
there seems to be no one to complain to;
his meals are dainty, but not prepared as
he is accustomed to having them; his
spiced wine does not taste as it should;
his bed has lumps, or his bath is too cold.
"Unhappy in the Vatican.
These little woes are felt acutely by one
who has never even had. to think of such
things. Above all, he misses the sea, his
swims therein, and his long walks along
the sands. To a familiar who was with
him in the Vatican gardens he exclaimed:
"Shall I always have this longing for
the country and for the sea? It is rather
an aggravation than otherwise to look at
the promised land, which is in this case
the sea (Mediterranean) from the obser
vatory, and not be able to go near it. I
want to walk, climb, run if need be, any
thing to make my. blood Circulate."
After which outbreak he seemed to feel,
better, and he went on laughingly:
"Do you know my temper is even de-;
terioratlngr, I who used to never let any
thing trouble me!"
This should not be taken, however, to
mean that Pius X is not proud of his new'
position, with a deep appreciation of his
responsibility and* privileges. He is an
eary with both together; but never cease.
Bobbed Him of His Soup.
So far has he carried this precept that
to go without his dinner while another ate
was too common an occurrence to cause
remark. Once, In those days, when he
sold his little horse to pay some debts
contracted by his family, he came home
half dead after a tramp of miles to the
deathbed of a man who proved to have
little the matter with him, and sat down
to a steaming plate of aoup.
"This Is good," he exclaimed, when the
spoon was arrested half way to his mouth
by the appearance of a young person who
came In at the door, sat down at the
table, reached over, took his soup and
calmly ate It all to the last spoonful. She
then roe<\ dropped a courtesy to the
epelibound priest, and as she left, said
jauntily:
"It was very good: they told me you
lived on bread and water to serve the
poor, and I wanted to prove that it was
a lie." V* â¢-
Such was all the thanks he got, and
this was the only time on record when
his charity was not only Involuntary, but
given with a bad grace.
His poor old mother adored him, but re
fused to live with him when he rose to
the splendid position of parish priest.
"No. my dear." she said, "I was born
here In Rlese, and here I shall die. Go
your ways, enjoy your good fortune and
send your linen to me when it needs
mendlnc-"'
, TJnsuited for Luxury.
And with this blessing she sent him out
Into the vast world, her best beloved son.
The old lady was very shrewd, and when
his sisters would have liked to live with
him in what was considered the brilliant
petition of sister <o a parish priest, she
eaid:
"So, no, daughters, you stay where you
are; there you will put on airs and so
never get married, while here you are
what you are, and the boys will take you
to wife." which proved true with three
out of the six. The other three, after the
death of their mother, lived in the Arch
bishop's palace at the Cathedral of St.
Mark's In Venice, with their brother, their
only object in life being to make him
happy and comfortable: hence the lament
with which this article begins.
Their case Is. In fact, rather hard. As
Pope, their brother can give them noth
ing for which they will much care. As
sisters of The Patriarch of Venice they
might have entered society and taken a
responsible position; but they took no
pleasure In such a life and positively re
fused all overtures. What can Pius X
do? Only make life easier by giving
them money which they do not want,

Next Sunday's Call.Xnd**d, on on* c-t these occasions, she
told a certain sympathetic lady among
the oustoxners that she had a cousinâ this
seemed more delicateâ who 'was a fireman,
and so, of course, she was ;. worried to
death whenever there was. a fire.
This customer was an influential "lady,
a serene, kind, rich person; regarded as
almost Indispensable to civilization by
many women and girls. She was able to
persuade them to do almost anything,
more. It must be acknowledged, by the
dignity of her presence than by the power
of her thought, which was of the most
soothing and casual nature, and made
no pretense of being convincing v
She used to come with" her daughter's
children to buy candy for them; and on
these occasions Annie would talk to her
about her nieces and nephews; how her
eldest niece had hair reaching below her
waist; how they were all such perfect
cut-ups; how on April Fool's day they

hersâ it had been Mr. Murphy: how they
were Just in mischief all the time, and
bow her youngest nephew took the prize
at a baby Bhow.
Mrs. La Grange on her side made ap
preciative monosyllabic replies. She was
so pleased with Annie taat she invited
her to come to see her and to bring her
nephews â¢ and nieces to play, with her
daughter's children.
"Th. day was so oppressively warm that
the streets were empty and almost still;
the grass of the empty lots was gray
and parched, and the dust was thick on
the roads and on the Â¦ burning asphalt
pavements; the few people they met had
handkerchiefs tucked in their necks, and
a man passing on a bicycle stopped and
sat' on the curbing to fan himself with a
newspaper. The children's arrangements
of their turns under their aunt's new
v hite satin parasol had just been fairly
"Tes," sh* answered, "I don't sÂ«* hour
anythlng could be more Inspiring thaa
such a perfect and humble courage."
Meanwhile two young girls,* admirers of
Mrs. La Grange, had come up from tae
end of ths store. ,
"I've felt proud of being a Chicagoaa
ever since yesterday," said on*.
"Yes. Indeed." said the other. They w*rÂ«
refer* ng to Mrs. La Grange's paper.
Bat Mrs. La Grange's head was so foil
of fire that she honestly misunderstood
them. She was absorbed In tho sense of
something finer, more helpful toward pro
gress than any paper she had ovÂ«r
dreamed.
"He certainly deserves to be mad* hap
py." said Mrs. La Grange. "And you.
Annie, you know how much I hope 70a
will be happy, dear child."
"Oh. I'm not afraid." said Acnit, with
humble confidence. "He's lots too good
for me."
"It's him I'm going to marry, too," said
Annie, glancing dlstraltly about the shop
with shining eyes.
Mrs. La Grange's heart beat with rym
pathetic pride. "Why, Annie!" shÂ» said.
"That was him." she said.
But when he saw on the outskirts of
the people pressing around him Annie and
the little McGarrlgles. laughing and cry-
Ing, it ocourred to him with thrilling con
viction that this Incident would give* him
a considerable pull over Mr. O'Mara and
Mr. Sullivan. His hope was not vain.
"I'm afraid I won't see you any more In
the candy store," Annie said to Mrs. L*
Grange on the next day over the counter.
Mrs. La Grange made a low, dignified
sound, expressive of regret and Inquiry.
"I ain't going to be her* after tho first
of the month." continued Annie. 'Tm
going to be married. I'll be real sorry not
to see you so often. I started to see you
Saturday, v but I didn't get the time."
"I'm glad you didn't come." said Mrs.
La Grange. It had. indeed, been thÂ«
afternoon of her paper at the club.
"I got caught in that big fire. Did you
see about It In the newspapers 7"
"Yes, Indeed," said Mrs. La Grange. It
was not a part of, her Christian Selene*
philosophy to acknowledge that flames
might bÂ« painful, but she was sometime*
etartled Into moments of sanity and Incon
sistency. "That brave fireman who caught
the girlsâ I thought of your cousin at tfaa
timeâ I hope he wasn't In It." ; #.; '.â¢.
Annie looked down at the candy box ah*
was filling: the tears crowded to her tya*.
They could aÂ«* Mr. Murphy's too* body

top rung and steadied himself wlta on*

began to speak and to ding together
then, and the old woman stopped moan-
Ing. He held out his right arm.
"Just drop alsy." they could hear him
call; the girl pressed closest to thÂ» win

the sill. "Hang by your hands I" ha
shouted; she clambered down. hung, and
dropped safe and plumb, caught In his
arm.
The ladder trembled, th* crowd yelled
hoarsely, and the girl, dizzy and white,
was helped down by the other firemen to
the crowded sidewalk, where the old wo
man, her mother, stood, now in a parox
ysm of Joy, pressing her hands together,
blessing the saints, blessing the firemen,
with tears pouring down her cheeks.
When the last frantic girl was safe on
the ground Murphy turned around to tho
hurrahing, weeping people, and climbed
down the ladder. They shook his band,
some of them kissed it. they wept over
him; they cheered for him; they carried
him on their shoulders.
It cannot be said that Mr. Murphy
knew so well how to behave on this occa
sion as he knew how to behave in dis
tributing the prizes of the Elks or in lead-
Ing the grand march. He hung bis head
and even growled when the old women
kissed his hand, and wtshed they
wouldn't do it; and when no observed

the murmuring crowd, and then in th*
blowing smoke they saw two men set.tb*

where the girls were. They could not put
it higher, for the fire had curled up
around the sill above, and evidently the
smoke was becoming -stifling there, for
the girls put their beads farther out of

corner where the eldest child must give
up her place, when there sounded on the
heavy air the startling, hurrying clang of
a fire belL - -
People put their heads out of the win
dows; they rushed from all sides; .they
looked north and south and east and
west; they peered up and down the cross
streets, and then they saw and heard, far
down the street, a rattling, glittering
mass, the swept manes and headlong gait
of galloping horses,, and amidst smoke
clouds and clanging, in a furious whirl of
brass and scarlet, a leviathan fire engine
rolled past, reverberating. Two more en
gines rumbled fiercely behind, like char
lota In a terrific chariot race, with enor
mous plunging horses, and helmeted fire
men straining forward on the front seats.
Little boys chased behind through the
stifling clouds of dust, stumbling and
whistling and yelling in an ecstasy of ex
citement, and a hurrying crowd walked
and ran in their wake.
In this crowd Annie and the children
were swept. Just as they, were always
swept when there was sv fire in their
neighborhood, but this time with ah espe
cial enthusiasm, for high up on the front
of the Jarring hook and laflder wagon
that closed the procession they- saw Mr.
Murphy. What was more remarkable, in
all the crowd and in his, rushing passage
he had seen them and touched his helmet
and smiled magnificently at them.
And it seemed only fitting when they
reached the object of so rapid a chase,
led by engines so glorious, that this
should be a raging fire in a building so
given up to It that its square lines and
flat front were seen wavering and almost
hidden in clouds of black smoke, with
sheets of flame rising from its roof and
brilliant tongues darting from Its lower
windows.

Next Sunday. .matic pauses between: sharp clicks of
the castantts rang through the hall; a
line of toes rose gradually toward tho
horizontal^ whirled more or less steadily
about, crossed behind, bent low, bowed,
and with a flutter of skirts resumed the
first position.
A little breeze of laughing admiration
circled the row of mothers and aunts.
"Isn't that too cunning! Just like a lit
tle 'ballet! Aren't they graceful, really,
now!" "Â¦
The whistle shrilled.
"Ready for the two-step, children!"
A mild tolerance grew on Richard. If
dancing must be. better the two-step than
anything else. Any one with a firm inten
tion of keeping the time and a strong arm
can drag a girl through it very accepta
bly. It was Dicky's custom to hurl him
self at the colored bunch nearest him,
seize a Sabine, so' to speak, and plunge
into the dance. He had bis eye on Louise
Hetherington, a large, plunmp girl, with
a tremendous braid of hair. She was a
size too big for the class, but everybody
liked to dance with her, for she knew
how, and piloted her diminutive partners
with great skill. But she had been "snap
ped up by the G-year-old Harold* and was
even now guiding his infant steps around
the hall.
Dicky skirted the row of mothers and
aunts cautiously. Heaven send Miss Doro
thy was not* looking at him! She seemed
to have eyes In the back of her bead, that
woman.
"Oh, look! Did you ever see anything
so sweet?" said somebody. Involuntarily
he turned. There in a' corner, all by her
self, a little girl was gravely performing
a dance. He stared at her curiously. For
the first time, free from all personal con
nection with them., he discovered that
those motions were pretty.
She was ethereally slender, brown-eyed,
brown-haired, brown-skinned. A little
ly considering flight.
He chuckled delightedly. Was ever such
engaging idiocy? She didn't know. Well,
well!" v;> V Â¦
"Pooh!" he said grandly. "I guess you
know. Don't you, really?"
She looked hopelessly at her fan and
shook her ncad. Suddenly a light dawned
in her big eyes.
"Maybe I know,"' she .murmured. "I
gueth I know. Heâ he* th a really tbtate!"
"A really state? .That Isn't anythingâ
nothing at all. A really state?" he
frowned at her Judicially. Her lip quiv
ered. She turned and ran away.
/'Here, come back!" he called, but she
was gone.'- _ Â£
When at" length Miss Dorothy an
nounced "That will do for to-day" they
"What made you dance all the time
with Westoh? 1 .. She's art awful, babyâ a
regular 'fraid cat.' We 'girls' tease her
Just as easy Do you. like her?"
"She's the prettiest one there!" he said.
His sister stared at' him. - .'
"Why, Dick Pendleton!*^he is not! She's
so littleâ she's not '.half so .pretty as Ag
nes, orâ or lots of the girls. She's such a
baby. She puts her finger In her mouth
if anybody says anything at all. If you
ask her a single thing she does like this:
â¢I don't know, I don't know.' "
He emiled scornfully,.". Did he not know
how she did it? Had.heVnot seen that
adorable finger, those' appealing eyes?
:?i" And she can't talk plain! â¢ She lispsâ
she does." ; --.â¢Â¦'Â¦ . Â¦-â¢-

"If you'll come over to my house I'll

but she was worth it.
"Oh! Oh!" she breathed, and her eyea
widened. . .. â¢ â¢
"Maybe you can see the ratâ he doesn't

estly.. .
She shuddered and twisted her fingers
violently. ; .
"No! No!" she whispered revoltedly.
tÂ§ Iâ I hate ratths! I dreamed about one!
I had to have the gath lit! Oh, no!"
Frightened at 1 -this long speech.- she
looked obstinately in- her lap, though he
tried persistently to catch her eye and
smile. ..::-, " : " . . . Â¦ Â¦

Oh, why did not the hassock yawn be

cuss him as if he were a piece of furni
ture! Â¦ â¢-â¢ â¢ â¢
Why c didn't she speak? If only they
were out of doors; in a room with pictures
and cushions a man is at such a disad
vantage. ' ' Â¦ â¢ " '
apologies rose above her sobbing; the
door closed behind Dicky and his mother.
Waves of rebuke rolled over his trou
bled spirit.
"Of air dreadful things to say to a poor,
nervous little girl! I am too mortified.
Richard, how do you learn such dreadful,
dreadful things. It's" not true."
"But, mama, it is! It truly is! When
they are little a man bites them off. Peter
told me so. He puts his mouth right
down" â¢
"Richard! Not another word! You ar*
disgustingâ perfectly disgusting. You
trouble me very much."
He retired to the clothestree In the side
yardâ there were no Junipers thereâ and
cursed his gods. To have made her cry!
They thought he didn't care, but, oh. ha
did! He felt as if he had eaten a cold,
gray stone that weighed down his stomach.
The eat slunk by. but he threw nothing at
her, and his ne'.ghbor's St. Bernard puppy
rolled Inquiringly into the hedge, stuck
there and thrashed about helplessly, but
he aaid nothing to frighten it He thought
of supperâ they had spoken of cinnamon
rolls and little yellow" custards â but with
out the usual thrill. What was the mat
ter? Was he going to be sick? There
seemed no outlook to lifeâ one thing was
as good as another. â¢Â»â¢.*
At night his mother came and sat for
a moment on the side of the bed.
'â¢Papa doesn't want you to feel too bad,
dear," she said. "He knows that you
never meant to frighten Cecelia so. You
know that little girls are very different
from little boys In some ways. Things
that seem â erâ amusing to you seem very
cruel to them. To-morr6w would you like
to send her some flowers and write her
a little note and tell her how sorry you
are?" . .
lie could not speak, but he seized his
mother's hand and kissed it up to her lace
ruffle. The cold,"; gray stone melted away
from his stomach; again the future
stretched rosily vague before him. In
happy dreams he did the honors of the
rathole to a sweet, shy guest.
In the morning he applied -himself to
his- note of apology; his sister ruled the
lines on a beautiful sheet of paper with a
curly gold "P" at the top and he bent to
his -task with extended tongue and lines
between his eyes. He carried her the note
with a sense of Justifiable pride.
"It's spelled all right," be said, "because

Her brother, an uninteresting fellow at

though he scoffed at Dicky's devotion to
his slaterâ thinking her a great babyâ bÂ«
had come to consider him a friend. Ons
day late In April he led Dick out to a
deserted corner of the grounds, and for
the sum of a small red top and a blue
glasa eye that had been a doll's most

him a song of such delicious badness that
it had to be song in secret Ha had Just
learned it himself, and the knowledge of
it admitted one. to a sort of club, whose
members were bound - together by tnÂ»
vicious syllables. - Dicky was pleasantly
uncertain of Its meaning, but It contained
words that custom had banished from the
famtly circle.^ They crooned it fearfully,
with faces averted from the houso and an
exhilarating sense of dissipation.

was an opportunity to break his bonds.
But to those who have served, the Little
God It will be no surprise to learn that
It was on that very evening that he madÂ«
his famous proposal to the assembled
family, namely, that he and Cecelia should
be really engaged like her Uncle Harry
and Miss Merriam, and In a little wall*
marry and set up housekeeping In the
guest chamber.
"That's what Miss Merriam Is goins; tÂ»
do," he explained, "and Cissy's grandma
is sorry, too; it doesn't leave her any
place for company but the hall bedroom.
But they've got to have the room, she
s'poses."
"That will do, Richard! You are not to
repeat everything you hear. And I am
afraid I need the guest chamber. "What
should we do when Aunt Nannie comes?"
"Oh. Cissy could have her crib right In
the room. She wouldn't mind Aunt Nan

sleeps In a crib, and she always will. A
bed scares herâ she's afraid she'll fall out.
I could sleep on the couch like Christinas

But In the manner of age the wide
world over, they merely urged him to
wait. J
It was that very night that he reached
the top of the wave, and Justified the
Little God's selection.
He came down to breakfast rapt and
quiet. He tn.tf<l his oatmeal by. mistake
and never Knew the difference. His sister
laughed derisively and explained his folly
to him as he swallowed the last spoonful,
but he only smiled kindly at her. Alter

"I will not go to that old dancing school

His sister riitted by the door in an en
gaging ceshabiiie, her accordion plaited
eklrt held carefully from the lloor, her
hair ia two glistening biue-knotttd pig
tails. A tiail of rose-scented soap tlitUd
through the hall.
"Hurry up, LÂ»ick, or we'll be late," she
called Lack sweetly.
"Oh, you shut up, will you!" he snarled.
She locked met k and listened to his de
privation of dessert for the rest of the
week with an air of love for the sinner
and hatred for the sin that deceived even
her older sister, who was dressing her.
A desperately patient monologue from
the next r<^m indicated the course of
events there:
"Your necktie is on the bed. No, I don't
know where the blue one is. It doesrTt
matter. That is just as good. Yes, it is.
No, you cannot. You w;il have lo wear

"Now, here's your ccat. Well, I can't

He slatr.mc-d the door till the piazza
â¢hock, and strode along beside his scan
dal;s> d sister, the pumps flopping noisily
on his shoulders. She tripped along con
tentedlyâshe liked to go. The personality
capable of txti acting pleasure from the
hour before them laffled his comprehen
sion, and he scowled fiercely at her, rub
bing his Filk stockings together at every
step, to enjoy the strange smooth sensa
tion thus produced. This gave him a bow
legged gait that distressed his sister be
yond WOrdS. - Â»:>i
"I think you might stop. Everybody's
looking at you! Please stop. Dick Pcn
dleton; you're a mean old thing. I shou!d
think ,you'd be ashamr-d to carry -your
slippers that way. If you jump in that
wÂ«t place and spatter me I shall tell
papaâ you will care when I tell him. just
the same! You're Just es bad as you
can be. I shan't rpeak with you to-day!"
She pursed up her lips ar.d maintained
a determined silence. He rubbed his legs
together with renewed emphasis. Ac
quaintances met them and passed, uncon
scious of anything: but the sweet picture
of a sister and a brother and a plush bag
going daintily and dutifully to dancing
school; but his heart was hot at the in
justice of the world and the hypocritical
cant of girls, and her thoughts were busy
with her indictment of him before the
family tribunalâ she hoped he would be
sent to bed. ,
He Jumped over the threshold of the
leng room and aimed bis cap at the head
of a boy he knew, who was standing on
one foot to put on a slipper. This de
stroyed his friend's balance and a cheer
lr.g scuffle followed. Life assumed a more
hopeful aspect. In the other dressing
rcom his sister had fluttered into a whls.
perlng. giggling, many-colored throng;
buzzing and chuckling with the rest, she
adjusted her Ellppers and perked ou her
bows, her braids quivering with eocla
bilitv.
A rhrlll whistle called them out In two
crowding bunches to the polished floor.
Hoping against hope, he had duns to
fi-.e brau'i'ful thoucht that Miss Dorothy
v.culd be sick, that shf hnd m'pst-d her
I rain â but no! there she was, with her
shiny. bigh-beeled ?Uppers. f.her o n.'t

silver whistle on a cha'.n. The little
clickirg caetariet* t*iat rnnjr out" sharply
were in htr hand beyond a doubt.
"Repf'y, children! Spread out. Take
your lir.es. First position. Now!" ,'..',
The large man at the piano, who always
lcok< d half asleep, thundered nut the
first 1 iirs of the latest waltz and the budl
r.css began.
Tlulr eyes were fixed solemnly on Miss
Dorothy's pointed shoes. They slipped
and slid and crossed their legs and arched
their pudgy Insteps; the bjys breathed
hard over trjeir gleaming collars. On the
r'.ght side of the hall thirty hands held
out their diminutive skirts at an alluring
angle. On tlie left neat black legs pat
tored diligently through mystic evolu
tions.
lha chorda rolled out slower, with dra-
fluffy white dress spread fan-shaped
above her-' knees; her .tiiKits wtre l>wii

seemed hardly to rest, on the ground; the

L'icky advanced and bowed jerkily,
ffiasptd one ef the loops of her sash in
the back, stamped gently a moment to
vet the time, and the artist sank into the
pnrtner.
"''Don't they do It well, though! See
these little things near the door!" he
caught as they went by, and his heart
svolipd with pride.
"What's your name?" he asked abrupt
ly after the dance.
"Thethelia," r.he lisped, and shook her
hair over her ch^ek. She wis very shy.
"Mine's Richard Carr Pendlcton. My

"Where do you live? Say, where do you

Seated opposite her on a hassock, their
mothers chatting across the room.- his as

There Is such an air of sociability, such
an air of good fellowship and so much
simplicity connected with an Informal
coffee that the bachelor has adopted It
as one of her favorite methods of en
tertaining. And then, too. she does not
dispense her hospitality unaided. A chap
can manage cups quite as well as she
canâ that is. if he Is trainedâ and no girl,
no matter what her name may be. ever
gets over the love of cracking: the whip
and watching others do their little dance.
It is pre-eminently feminine.
This girl has taken tip a trick that hag
always seemed mannish and that is shak
ing hands with her friends when ther
come and when they go. She does not
trouble herself about a fellow's overcoat,
nor look to see whether he has forgotten
his stick; these things he must look to
himself and It would be worse than poor
venttonallsms . and .cares less what folks
think of her as long as they do not pass
the "erratic" mark, for her life has wld-
ened and she no longer treads the beaten
path, but has little side tracks paved with
Individuality.
Yet to .be the popular girl, the attrac
tive girl, there are pemnal qualities that
must be hers. She must know how to
receive guests and how to speed them on
their way. She must know how to en
gage them in light If sometimes frivo
lous conversation, and above all she must
have tact, presence of mind and the abil
ity to say the tight thing at the right
time. With these tucked under bet arm,
she could brave the world and be sure of
coming out on top of any shuffle.
But there are a few things that this
wondrous maid must- positively not; have.
Her little reception -room must be ' fitted
up In . good taste and to represent noth
ing, else under the shining sun but a re
ception room. There must be no wash
stands but half way. concealed,, a coucb
that has bed written all over It with
capital letters instead of pillows, or an
array of suggestive cookery articles
These things positively must not be.
: The , bachelor .â who makes her apart
ments a study appreciates the cozy ef
fects. Her belongings may not be worth
more than a handful of pennies, a pot of
palms, a candlestick, a trinket here and
there and some glmcracks that take the
place of "bric-a-brac, yet they arc so ar
ranged, that they, give the appearance of
a homey home.
In one corner she finds that the chafing,
dish with ite bubbling mysteries gives
her excellent opportunities for harmless
frolics;, in another she establishes a coxy
corner filled with souvenirs of this, that
and the other thing that i never fall i to
be interesting, ..and. the rest .of her
"sphere" Is rounded off In coxy sections
with individuality.
If this maid bachelor can reach her
home a little before S In the afternoon
she may entertain In the easiest but one
of the most effective ways In the world.
Over her tea standard may bubble and
boll a .kettle, or If she prefers the 4
o'clock coffee, which so many do these
days, she has a small spirit lamp that
sends forth Its appetizing fumes almost
In the' twinkling of an eye.
No girl, no matter whether she Is a
bachelor, an old maid or a sweet bud,
can prepare coffee In a second. The ta
ble must be daintily set. thin bread, sand
wich fashion, must be buttered and sweet
cakes must be set forth, and In small
taate for her to assist to gmtaertar Ms
belongings; but she does extend her band
in a frank, cordial way and bid him wel
come when he wills.' An Invitation or*Â«
extended to coffee Is a permanent on* and
there Is no need to repeat It unle*s uaÂ«
certainty Is decidedly noticeable.
. There are hosts of things that this ad
vanced young woman has added to her
rights. In forsaking the cheerless board-*
ing house she took the biggest leap of all.
but she landed high and dry and found
herself not only happier and more con
tented but a creature whoso whims and
fancies are pampered more than tbÂ«y had
ever been before. She Instantly changed
from the drab to the rosy, from the ordi
nary to the fascinating and all because
she willed to be a happier woman than
Â¦he could have been under any other cir
cumstances. :
Society has broadened and the woman
who has alvocatlon need never be afraid
of being lonely, neither need she bÂ«
afraid of gossip and unkind chattw, for
just as long as she adheres to certain
rules of etiquette the bachelor gtrl wtn

and radiating contentment and oh*erfa|Â«

But the gods be praised we have I a
brand spanking new kind of an "old maid."
And she isn't an old maid at all. Best
of all ho one even ever thinks of her

She was an "old maid" and If ever

At twenty-five she was drab and slow.

her own grandmother and all the maiden
avunts in the country.
THE bachelor maid and her new life
In a great city is the most attrac
tive and fascinating of all lives.
ThJs girl, by the way. is an en
tirely new type, for until the last
half dozen years she was an unknown
quantity, although on the ragged edge of
making herself heard and felt in a tiny
world of her own. All can without diffi
culty remember the fairy stories that
brightened chi!d:sh days in which the
fairy god-motlier invariably bestowed
coruentmtnt upon her chosen few rather
than -'great riches." It is more than un
fortunate that there are not a few fames
scattered about in this advanced age, for
there are great bands of discontented
people thoroughly dissatisfied with them
selves and their surroundings, entirely
out of gear with their environments and
absolutely uncomfortable, but thanks be,
help ha* poured in from ar. unexpected
quarter In the shape of the bachelor girl.
In the times of yore if a girl suddenly
found herself with poverty staring her
in the face, it is true she -made a brave
front of it and hustled from one place
to another until she had secured some
kind Dff employment. ;
She had been cut off by a sex line from
all the gtÂ»od things of this earth and her
fate had, been determined from the day
of her birth, so she thought in her con
â¢ervatisrn. and without try:ng to alter
her condition in any respect she settled
herself down tc follow out a life narrow
and intense.
But, of course. ev->-ybody knows and
understands full wjihat the bachelor
girl, is .quite unlike "\iy other and they
grant her almost unlimited leeway They
know that she thinks but little of the con-
She receives her guests, both masculine
and feminine,' with as perfect freedom as
though a chaperon ; was :' standing t at, her
back and watching "every movement with
her eagle eye. She Is ever courteous and
she demands respect and courtesy by her
simplicity and ea^y, manner.
If she entertainsTier friends with a wee
small dinner, the evening is the time they
are Invited, and ehe cooks and serves It
herself, because, forsooth, there le no one
to do it for her, but in doing It. she makes
such rollicking fun out of It- that each
and every guest feels it a distinct honor
to be there â¢ and enters into . the frolic
right royally. There. Is. no stiffness about
her or her home, but always that name
less charm called "manner."
So she dons her sweetest frock, tucks
a bow or a flower in her hair in a cou
quettish. fashion' and "prepares for war
generally. If it is war to the death she
takes the trouble to discover Individual
tastes and to find out what pleases' each
one the most, and then - with a slyness
and a deftness all her. own,, manages to
see that the right thing is forthcoming
at the ' right time, i
The evening of a bachelor girl Is her
day time and 'she is forced to use it as
such unless she is contented to Vork,
work, work and live otherwise in a state
of vegetation. It is true she may be
weary body and soul, but society demands
just so much of her time, "and whether
she will or.no it must be given or else
Borne bright day she will wake up and
discover herself a complete, nonentity.
Friends are queer beings. If you are ever
before them they remember you, but per

self and spend her days In a dreary, lone
some fashion. So in selecting her flat
she keeps a weather eye out for conven
iences | and arranges her numerous be
longings so that she can do her own
work with little r or no trouble and then
skip away to her duties. It might be all
well and good to keep a maid, and no one
will deny that they are mighty useful
about dinner time, but comparatively
speaking they are too much of a luxury.
Space i3 limited, money is limited and
time Â«s limited."
â¢ Her home, be It large or small, Is by
courtesy dubbed an apartment, for she
rarely can afford a flat proper and be
sides a perfect network of small fami
lies so far away and yet so near have
their compensations Although -she is
alone it is quite another thing to be
lonely.
And family! She has none. That Is ex
actly the reason which makes her a bach
elor maid and that makes her position in
life peculiar She stands alone without
a prop or a support she asks no odds of
an> one and she even denies herself the
privilege of having things made easier
for her just because fate decreed that she
must be a woman She stands shoulder
to shoulder to man and when she de
manded his lights she accepted his bur
dens quite at a matter of course.
And thle home of hers Of course, the
bachelor maid Is always a professional
woman, for what other excuse could she
offer' for cutting herself free from soci
ety and people in general to live by her-
This home, as it chances, is what rives
this business woman her new name, and
Incidentally it Is the halo which throws
the glamour of a subtle charm about her
Her rooms and her life are her very own
to do with as she deems best and It is
this very freedom that is her unquestion
able right which makes her the. center of
many wondering eyee.
And really that isn't the way of it at
all. What is her first move after finding
employment? Why. the hunting and fit
ting up of a home, no matter how small
ar.d cramped it may be, for after -a busy
day's work It affords her the rest, the
quiet and the peace that every home lover
finds in a pet corner.
mentioned. No matter what tier age may
be she is always a young maid. Into the
forties and into the fifties she Is attract
ive, and. in fact, justas long as she re
mains a bachelor maid there is a cer
tain fascination about her that makes
her simply charming and worth cultivat
ing.
And how this woman Is abused! It
has always been the mark of femininity

of boiling potatoes and grubbing gen
erally, but when she added letter? to her
name, passed from college Into the world

It was a positive fact that she was mas

Mme. Pattl, who is. the 'smartest of all
Â¦wellidressed women, has a way of turn
ing back a velvet cuff and fastening it
with a big handsome % button. â¢ She also
knows how to -turn back'a.wide collar
and seta button to keep It in'place. Her
button collection is very large and some
of the buttons are very valuable. When
not in use upon a gown they are kept in
a Jewel case. ' Madame's twilight gowns
are of marvelous beauty.
The dinner gowns, for an Informal din-
ner at home when there is no one ex-.
Pected outside the family, can be cut on
charming lines and made of pretty ma
terials, but it should not look -like a
wrapper nor yet like a tea gown. Though
an informal 1 dress It has its formalities.
It Is quite different from a negligee,
which savors of the sleeping room al-
tucks, each tuck headed with a little
fancy fagoting. A skirt like this is with
in the skill of the home dressmaker,
who must remember, however, to make
the skirt very long even though It be very
simple in design.
A lovely little house coat which should
be in the wardrobe of every woman who
aspires to dress well Is made of panne
velvet. If you do not want to go Into
velvet you could make It of face cloth or
of satin or of , taffeta. It will be found
the most economical article in one's ward
robe.
Latest French Fashions.
The "French woman, without her house
coat would be lost and the well dressed
American woman should not be behind
her In appreciation of this garment ! It
can be made from odds and ends. A
pretty material from which to make it is
biscuit colored panne. Let It be cut short
and shaped like a cut-away Jacket, but
toning to the bust, then flaring a little.
The back Is very tight fitting and there
Is Just the suggestion of a frill around
the hips.
The beauty of the house coat is that
it can be worn all winter over the old
shirt waists of summer. It is cut low
in the neck and is provided with a wide
silk sailor collar. It can be cut off at tne
elbows and finished with a flare cut. Thus
made it is one of the prettiest of all gar
ments for house wear. The undersleevei
bag prettily below it and the throat is
made handsome with a lace finish.
That the summer shirt waist is to be
worn all winter is now a settled fact and
the woman who does not know how to
wear thin waists in the winter time must
speedily learn. She must get "on to" the
trick of the heavy lawn underwaist and
must master the intricacies of the little
house coat, which protects all but the
front of the waist and the sleeves, and
which is slipped on over any shirt waist
with stunning effect
. The science of the button, used as a
trimming, is something to be studied.
There is a great deal in knowing how to
use your very expensive buttons after
you have purchased them, and there Is
everything in understanding what not to
do with them. ' Buttons that stand like
sentinels in a stupid row upon the front
of the waist are no ornament at all.
Neither are buttons that occupy useless
"Where did you get the beautiful laoe
in your sleeves?" asked one woman of
anohter. '. ;,
"I cut up the best parts of an old lace
curtain," replied the woman, patting her
pretty house sleeves with conscious pride.
And this only goes to show how mater
ials can be used for gowning fair woman
this season and how every scrap of lace
can be utilized no matter what may have
been Its previous condition or servitude.
Fine linen, fine net and fine goods of
all kinds can be made into sleeves, for
fashion says that they need not match
the. gown. Big linen puffs may bag over
the wrists and .big lace puffs may bag
over the knuckles, regardless of the style
or kind of dress which they adorn.
Those who are looking for fashion
"tips" will be glad to know that the

popular will remain in style. â¢

It may be, and yet It has none of the
stiffness of the dinner gown.
One of the prettiest of all sights is the
shopping woman, worn with the labors
of the day, in a twilight gown, ready for
dinner. Her dress is a dainty flowered
stuff, making her look like a china wo
man. Her slippers are trimmed with fig
ured bows of ribbon, in the middle of
which there is a tiny but very brilliant
buckle. Around her waist Is folded a
figured sash and at her throat nestles a
wide ruching.
This same woman another evening will
wear the severe type of gown, the one
that is tucked as to the skirt in little
tucks laid all around the belt, while the
waist is made in baby waist style, but
toning in the back In French fashion. A
very- wide girdle, all in black, laid in
many folds Is passed around the waist
and tied in the back in a very severe
four-in-hand with very long ends.
Many of the twilight gowns, have laoe
sleeves, and, speaking of these, here is a
true story:
That there Is talk of reviving the cus
tom of dining In picture hats, and that
wonderful drooping hats are being de
signed for this very purpose.
That very large and very beautiful
mother-of-pearl buttons will be seen, and
that these exquisite pieces of pearl will
be trimmed with enamel decorations to
bring out the opalescent tints.
And that, while the main attention Is
turned to handsome gowns, the eyÂ» roves.
nevertheless, toward tne very handsome
petticoats which are displayed In the
shops and which are made up with a reck
less disregard for cost or for anything
else except the beauty thereof.
The petticoat absolutely must flare
around the foot, and to make It do so is
one of the problems of modern dressmak
ing and modern petticoat construction.
Ruffles are set, one on top of the other, to
make the full foot flare, and under the
ruffles is set a frill of stiff silk which Is
warranted to keep the silk ruffles well
OUt. Â¦/*.; Â¦Â¦<
Ruffles are of all shapes, scalloped,
frilled, petal trimmed and cut in squares,
anything to make a fullness around the"

like Dame Nature and all others of her
sex, she keeps her surprises well hidden
and springs them upon the world only in
her own good time.
That lingerie hats an of lace will be
worn all winter and that the dressiest new
hat seen this season Is made of silver
lace, trimmed with very small pink roses.
That hand-painted lace 'and embroid
ered lace will be used upon hats, upon
blouses and upon the skirts of evening
dresses.
That the milliners are busy trying to
raise the low crowns and are resorting to
various means.
That dressmakers are at the point of
mutiny, for all gowns must bÂ« trimmed
with needlework and needlework of the
most trying description, fagoting, hem
stitching, smocking, French knots, trac
ings and coral stltchlngs.
That embroideries are to be used in
new ways, not merely as edgings, but as
trimmings, put on in bands a few Inches
apart, wherever the stylo of sown will
permit.
That the soft silk scarf play* a very
Important part In this season's fashions
and is used as a lacing for the front of
the bodice and for the front of to* little
street coat Large eyelet holes are work
ed into the coat and the allk scarf Is
laced through them.
That every gown must have Its cape
collar to be sometimes worn and some
times left off, but in the wardrobe,
whether it be always worn or not.
That autumn will see the high crowned
hat coming in and that the low crown is
slowly disappearing.
That It la absolutely necessary to have
a coat and skirt suit for early fall wear
and that the skirt may bÂ« plain if pre

That the straight walking coat, com
ing Just to the hips and belted with a

That the straight flounce makes a very
nice finish for the walking skirt and that
three, four, five or eix of these straight

That linen must be decorated with small

flounce attached, lone enough to fan to

To bÂ« very practical upon the subject
of the twilight gown on* can mention the
model which is made of cashmere In a
ehade of tan. a tan that is almost brown.
The skirt, which is of conventional cut.
Is long In the back. It Is very plainly
trimmed with four straight flounces four
Inches wide. There Is no heading to
these flounces.
Another of these pretty twilight gowns
Is made of light blue cloth with satin

very long, is trimmed with four very dean
One of the most charming women at
home is the Princess Troubetzkoy for
merly Amelie Rives. It was she who was
one of the first to discover the beauties
of the draped gown, and In her fondness
for It she was closely seconded by Mrs
William C Whitney and Mrs. Cleveland'
both of whom popularized it in that day
in Washington. Now you will see this
same gown made more conventionally
but retaining many of its old points of
beauty.
Modern fashions have much trans
formed the Roman toga gown until now
It is made over a fitted foundation and
the long flowing lines are bordered with
Persian embroidery and there is a Per
sian band around the foot of the gown.
A very conventional stock of Persian
stuff and very wide sleeves bordered with
the same give an up-to-date look to this
gown.
The Roman toga gown is flowing In all
Its lines But its particular feature is
that it is fastened upon the left shoulder
In Roman toga fashion, while from the
fhoulder it falls away in long lines clear
to the ground.
The Boman Toga Gown.
The Roman toga house gown, or twi
light gown. Is one that looks very simple
to the eye. but It is difficult to make.
Puxzling as this gown is to the amateur,
it is really worth the while if one is go-
Ing in for pretty house dresses.
The house gown, with its flowing lines,
may have the high empire belt, and this
is accomplished by the mere folding of
silk material across the waist line high
enough to outline the bust. This Is an
old style, but one that does not go out,
for you seÂ« it repeated in all the new
fashions of winter.
Never under any circumstances in this
year of our graceful fashions should a
Â¦woman undertake to tighten the belt.
Lace. If lace you must, from the corset,
but let the outer garments be very easy
in fit. This is the positive rule, which,
unless well observed, will cause the gown
to look very much out of the mode.
Another way to make the girdle Is to
pupp'.y a foundation of boned crinoline.
This is covered with folds of silk that are
finished 8t the back with little knots of
ribbon. The bottom knot hangs down
long, with ends that almost reach the.
bottom of the Fklrt- These are knotted
two or three times to give a finish to the
girdle.
The French dressmakers Insist that the
girdle be very loose. They will tighten
the corset until the victim Is almost
strangled, but when it comes to putting
on the girdle this article is placed loosely
around the waist and its folds axe very
lightly laid. Its ribbon ends are loosely
tied and the whole girdle looks as though
It might be worn a great deal tighter. In
this way the figure Is given an air of
elimness.
To 2Â£r.ke the Figure Slim.
Almost a necessary feature of the twi
lipht govrn Is the wide girdle. This la
made of any material and Is finished In
any one of a variety of ways. The
French are very fond of the kid girdle,
which stretches to fit the waist and looks
very neat. A white kid girdle can be
worn a long time, as can one of black.
The red kid ones are very effective, while
the blue and gTeen are decidedly chic,
worn around the waist of house gowns
that are made In the pale green or the
pale cream tones.
When the girdle la made of silk or vel
vet, of ribbon or of cloth. It Is by far the
best plan to supply an Inner belt of the
desired width of crinoline. This Inner belt
5s covered with fl'k muslin of the desired
Fhade, and over this Is carelessly draped
the outer pirdle
A trimming that is new this fall is the
pit â¢Â« e of niching two or three inches long.
A yard of ruching is cut up In three-Inch
lengths, and these lengths are used to
trim the front of the house gown, taking
the place of the bow of ribbon or the
bow of velvet.
The fad for ruchlngs finds expression
1n the trimming nf Indoor gowns, which
ere decorated with nxchlnc* of all kinds.
A very pretty ruche is the one that Is
made of si'.k ard Bhirred through the mid
dle. A little vine cf flowers Is run along
the shirring and the little flowers are al
most r-ut not quite buried in the ruche.
Another ruchlng that Is very popular is
the one with scalloped edges. This nich
ing is gathered In the middle and little
knots of velvet are eet at intervals of
three inches. Ruchlngs are made of
everything and are made in all sorts of
ways, and the wonder is that there are
frowns enough upon which to place them,
for they are so numerous.

Since all women wear the low cut neck
In winter now as well as In summer, and
since the low cut neck is both comfort
able and becoming, it is well to cut the
twilight gown in a wide point In the
front and roundine In the back. This
open ppace can be filled In with a chemi

Styles cf type, like all other novelties,
change every year, and just at present
the rather ; Equare tftects are aul lue
\CRUC.
Of course, it goes without faying that
In this newest of stationery there never
ehould be any abbreviations and lh:il fut
ures never should be used, as for instance,
the number nf the residence pbould l>e
written out and engraved in full. Per
haps the. greatest number or questions
arij'o over thÂ«' issuing of invitations, but
It should be thoroughly understood that
all guests are bidden In the name of tho
faiher and mother, or if neither be. liv
ing, in the name of the bride's nearest rel
ativeâher brother, unless lie chances to
be younger, and then it is wisest to make
thrm quite ns simple as possible. One
tr.ir.c must be remembâ¬TÂ«-d thouch: If
tlie Invitations] nre sent by other than hÂ«r
parents the prefix "Miss" is added, but
otherwise her name is given as plain
Miiry IÂ»ui8e.
If the groom is connected u-ith the army
or navy below the rank of lieutenant the
prefix "Mr." Is nÂ» d, bin a!I officers, as
a rule, have their titles prefixed In fii I
to their name. iVbfesjdonal titles, such
us Dr. or Htv.. may be employed if one
pleases* but it is far better to omit hon
orary titles
Never have the year engraved on the
Invitations It is the worst possible taste,
nnd as it Is invariably engraved on the
ar.r.ouncerm nts really is not necessary.
.Anothet important don't concerns the
Christian n:imÂ» s. The time has passed
Â¦when initials are considered sufficienl and
all name? are. quite as a matter of course,
wrifun in full. And Fee to it that the
Tvnrd "and" is used between "Mr." and
"Mr*.*" in place o f the sign mark. That
It simp'y too provincial for any words
and never fails to make one appear hope
lessly ridiculous.
For a church wedding the. most pop
ular form of invitation reads:
Mr and Mr* Gpctk- Clark Thompson
request the honor
oresence at the'mVrr'la'cV'of their daughter
Katnryn Elizabeth
to
Mr. William Henry Session*
On th- rv-nii.c rf Wednesday, the fixth day
of July, at half after seven o'clock.
At St. Lukes Church.
A blank place Is left to write In the
name of the guest, as It Is thought to ba
far more personal than to merely * re
quest the honor of your presence." This,
however, is also perfectly correct, and if
one does not care to take the trouble to
fill Jn ell the names. Is the only form that
should be used. "Request the pleasure of
your company" never should be found on
a church invitation, but Invariably on
that of a home wedding or reception in
vitation .
Widows are forever In a quandary about
their second marriages, puzzle over their
wedding frocks and ponder over the
wording of their invitations, but it is
simple when one stops to think about It.
There really is but one way. Her parents
issue them, in the usual fashion, with her
Christian name and the surname of her
deceased husband. The prefix "Mrs." or
her married name may be given In
brackets below her Christian name if she
pleases, but it i* far more conspicuous
and but little liked.
Oftentimes the young people inclose
their new address and state when their
friends will be able to find them at home,
for it is anything but pleasant to travel

Now and then double weddings are cele
brated and- when the brides are sisters
nothing could be prettier. Instead of Is
suing two sets of requests one la ample
and the two names are engraved on tha
same card:

When the bride's brother Invites their
mutual friends be may associate his
wife's name In describing the bride as
their sister, and a married sister includes
the name of her husband. However,
when desired, distinct relationship may
be made In this manner:
Mr. and Mrs. Lowell Gray
request the honor of
presence at the marriage of Â«
Mr. Gray's sister,
Elizabeth.
Buch a form simplifies matters and Is
quite the best to choose when the bride
chances to be a granddaughter, a niece,
a sister or a ward. Her surname Is al
ways given and all possible errors ax*
avoided by this method.
No matter how elaborate the prepara
tions may be, all Invitations and an
nouncements are engraved uniformly, the
announcements being sent out the day
following the marriage:'
Mr. and Mrs. Itolln Swaaey

The older form reads: .

I California.
It Is a common mistake to Include the
entire family in one invitation. Properly
speaking there should be onÂ» for "Mr.
and Mrs.." another for "the Misses" and
a separate one to the adult sons. If
there chance to be three or more daugh
ters It Is far wiser to address one to the
eldest. Then there Is no possible chanc*
of appearing cheap or of having the in
vitations rive out.
There Is but one other card that Is ever
used and that Is for reasons of Illness or
death In the family. As a rule they are
not engraved, but are printed from type:
Owing to Illness m the family
Mr. and Mrs. William Clark IlaramommltSk
. . are obliged to recall the Invitation*
for the wedding of their daughter
* en Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of August.
I San Francisco, California.
All Invitations depend largely upon the
circumstances. For instance, if the wed
ding is to be at a hotel or at a hail *
card Is enclosed Indicating the address to
which replies are to be sent:
R. s. v. p.

It is surprising when one orders wed
ding stationery to aee how many cards
and tbe Uke are deemed necessary, but
as one Is. as a rule, married but once In
a lifetime they are all cheerfully ordered
and the lady fair leaves the shop with a

CHAPTER XXIIL
AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE.
Â£~r> HE summer is scarcely a, good time
I to visit Egypt, but Monty and his
I guests had a desire to see even a
I little of the northern coast of
Africa. It was decided, therefore,
that after Athens, the "Flitter" should
go south. The yacht had met them
at Naples after the automobile pro
cessloaâa kind of triumphal progress.â
vas disbanded in Florence, and they had
taken a hurried survey of Rome. By the
middle of July the party was leaving the
heat of Egypt and finding it not half bad.
New York was not' more than a month
away as Brewster reckoned time and dis
tance, and there was still too much money
In the treasury. As September drew near
er he got into the habit of frequently for
getting Swearengen Jones until it was too
late to retrace his steps. He was coming
to the "death struggle," as he termed it,
an* there was something rather terror
izing In the fear that "the million might
die bard." And so these last days
and nights were glorious ones,
if one could have looked at them with
unbiased, untroubled Â¦ eyes. But every
member of hla party was praying for the
day when the "Flitter" would be well into
the broad Atlantic and the worst over.
At Alexandria Brewster bad letters to
some Englishmen, and in the few enter
tainments that he gave succeeded once
again In fairly outdoing Aladdin.
A sheik from the Interior waa a guest
at one of Monty's entertainments. He
was a burly, hot-blooded fellow, with a
densely-populated harem, and he had
been invited more as a curiosity than as
one to be honored. As he came aboard
the "Flitter" Monty believed the invita
tion was more than Justified. Mohammed
was superb, and the women of the party
made so much of him that it was small
wonder that his head was turned. He fell
desperately In love with Peggy Gray on
sight, and with all the composure of a
potentate who has never been crossed he
sent for Brewster the next day and told
him to "send her around" and he would
marry her. Monty's blood boiled furious
ly for a minute or two, but he was quick
to see the wisdom of treating the propo
sition diplomatically. He tried to make it
plain to the sheik that Miss Gray could
not accept the honor he wished to confer
upon her. but It was not Mohammed's
custom to be denied anything he asked
forâ especially anything feminine. He
complacently announced that he would
come aboard that afternoon and talk it
over with Peggy.
Breweter looked the swarthy gentleman
over with unconcealed disgust in his eyes.
The mere thought of this ugly brute so
much as touching the hand of little Peggy
Gray filled him with horror, and yet there
was something laughable in the situa
tion. He could not hide the smile that
came with the mind picture of Peggy
listening to the avowal of the sheik. The
Arab misinterpreted this exhibition of
mirth. To him the grin Indicated friend
ship and encouragement. He wanted to
give Brewster a ring as a pledge of af
fection, but the American declined the of
fering and also refused to carry a bag
of Jewels to Peggy.
"I'll let the old boy come aboard Just to
see Peggy look a hole through him," he
resolved. "No matter how obnoxious it
may be, it isn't every girl who can say
an Oriental potentate has asked her to
marry him. If this camel-herder gets dis
agreeable we may tumble him Into the
sea for a change."
With the beat grace possible he Invited
the sheik to come aboard and consult
Miss Gray in person. Mohammed was a
good bit puzzled over the intimation that
it would be necessary for him to plead
for anything he had expressed a desire
to possess. Brewster confided the news to
"Rip" Van Winkle and "Subway" Smith,
who had gone ashore with him, and the
trio agreed that it would be good sport
to let the royal proposal come as a sur
prise to Peggy. Van Winkle returned to
the yacht at once, but his companions
stayed ashore to do some shopping. When
they approached the "Flitter" later on
they observed an unusual commotion on
deck.
Mohammed had not tarried long after
their -departure. He gathered his train
together, selected a few costly presents
that had been returned from the harem
and advanced on the boat without delay.
The captain of the "Flitter" stared long
and hard at the gayly bedecked launches
and then called to bis first officer. To
gether they watched the ceremonious ap
proach. A couple of brown-faced heralds
came aboard first and announced the ap
proach of the mighty chief. Captain Perry
went forward to greet the sheik as he
came over the side of the ship, but he
was brushed aside by the advance guards.
Half a hundred swarthy fellows crowded
aboard and then came the sheik, the per
sonification of pomp and pride.
"Where Is she?" he asked in his native
tongue. The passengers were by this
time awaxe of the visitation and began to
straggle on deck, filled with curiosity.
"What the devil do you mean by com
ing aboard in this manner?" demanded
the now irate Captain Perry, shoving a
couple of retainers out of his path an*
facing the beaming aultor. Aa Interpreter
took a band at this Juncture and the
doughty captain finally was made to un
derstand the object of the visit He
laughed in the sheik's face and told the
mate to call up a. few Jackles to drive
the "dagoes" off. "Rip" Van Winkle In
terfered and peace was restored. The
cruise had changed "Rip" into a happier
and far more radiant creature, so it was
only natural that he should have shared
the secret with Mary Valentine. He had
told the story of the sheik's demand to
her aa soon aa he came aboard, and she
had divulged it to Peggy the Instant
"Rip" was out of sight.
Brewster found the sheik sitting in state
on the upper deck impatiently await
ing the appearance of his charmer.
He did not know her name, but he
had tranquilly commanded "Rip" to
produce all of the women on board
so that he might select Peggy from
among them. Van Winkle and Bragdon,
who now waa in the secret, were prepar
ing to inarch the ladles past the ruler
when Monty came up.
"Haa he seen Peggy V he asked of Van
Winkle.
"Not yet She is dressing for the occa
sion."
"Well, wait and see what happens â¢ to
him when she gets over the first shock,"
laughed Monty.
Just then the sheik discovered Peggy,
who. pretty as a picture, drew near the
strange group. To her amazement two
slaves rushed forward and obstructed her
passage long enough to beat their heads
on the deck a few times, after which they
arose and tendered two magnificent neck
laces. She was prepared for the proposal,
but this action disconcerted her; she
gasped and looked about in perplexity.
Her friends were smiling broadly and the
sheik ha- placed his hands over his pal
pitating heart.
"Lothario has a pain," whispered
"Rip" Van Winkle sympathetically, and
Brewster laughed. Peggy did not hes
itate an Instant after hearing the laugh.
She walked straight toward the sheik.
Her cheeks were pink and her eyes were
flashing dangerously. The persistent
brown slaves followed with the Jewels,
but she ignored them completely. Brave
as she intended to be, she could not re
press the shudder of repulsion that went
"Are You Tired, Peggy?" Asked
Brewster, With a Touch of
Tenderness.
over her as she looked full upon this
eager Arab. â¢
Graceful and slender ehe stood before
the burly Mohammed, but his ardor was
not cooled by the ! presence of so many
witnesses. With a thud he dropped to
his knees, waobllng for a moment In the
successful effort to maintain a poetic
equilibrium. Then he began pouring
forth volumes' of shattered French. Eng
lish and Arabic sentiment, accompanied
by facial contortions so Intense that they
were little less than grewsome.
"Oh/ Joy of the sun supreme, Jewel of
the only eye, harken to the entreaty of
Mohammed." It was more as If he were
commanding his troops in battle than
pleading for the tender compassion of a
lady love. "I am come for you, queen of
the sea and earth and sky. My boats are
here, my camels there, and Mohammed
promises you a palace in the sun-lit hills
If you will but let him bask forever In
the glory of your smile." All this was
uttered In a mixture of tongues so atroc
ious that "Subway" Smith afterward de
scribed it as a salad. The retinue bowed
impressively and two or three graceless
Americans applauded as vigorously as If
they were approving the actions of a well
drilled comic opera chorus. Sailors were
hanging In the rigging, on the davits
and over the deck house roof.
"Smile for the gentlemen. Peggy," com
manded Brewster delightedly. "He wants
to take a short bask."
"You are very rude, Mr. Brewster,"
said Peggy turning upon him coldly. Then
to the waiting, expectant sheik: "What
is the meaning of this eloquence?"
Mohammed looked bewildered for a
moment and then turned to the Inter
preter, who cleared up the mystery sur
rounding her English. For the next three
or four minutes the air svas filled with
the "Jewels of Africa," "Star.' "Sun
light." "Queen," "Pleavenly Joy," "Pearl
of the Desert," and other things in bad
English, worse French and perfect Arabic.
He was making promises that could not
be redeemed if he lived a thousand years.
In conclusion the gallant sheik drew a
long breath, screwed his face into a sim
pering, grin and played his trump card In
unmistakable English. It sounded pathet
ically like "You're a peach."
An Indecorous roar went up from the
white spectators and a Jacky in the rig
ging, suddenly thinking cf.home, piped
up with a bar or two from "The Star
Spangled Banner."
Having accomplished what he consid
ered to te his part of the ceremony the
sheik arose and started toward his
launch, coolly motioning for hÂ«r to fol
low. So far as he was concerned the mat
ter was closed. But Peggy, her heart
thumping like a trip-hammer, her -eyes
full of excitement, implored him to stop
for a moment.
"I appreciate ihis great honor, but I
have a request to make," she said clearly.
Mohammed paused irresolutely and in
some irritation.
"Here's where the heathen gets It
among the beads," whispered Monty to
Mrs. Dan, and he called out: "Captain
Perry, detail half a dozen men to pick
up the beads that are about to slip from
his majesty's neck." .
. xxiv.
THE SHEIK'S TRAGEDY.
Peggy gave the sheik an entrancing
smile, followed by a brief glance at the
beaming Miss Valentine, who nodded her
head approvingly.
"Won't you give me time to go belo-ar
and pack my belongings that they may
be sent ashore?" she asked naively.
"Thunder!" gasped Monty. "That's no
way to turn him down."
"What do you mean, Monty Brewster?"
she cried, turning upon him with flashing
eyes;
"Why, you're encouraging the old guy,"
he protested, disappointment in every in
flection.
"And what if I am? Isn't it my affair?
I think I am right in suspecting that he
has asked me to be his wife. Isn't it my
privilege to accept him if I wish?"
BrewBter's face was a study. He could
not believe that she was in earnest, but
there was a ghastly feeling that the Joke
was being turned on him. The rest of the
company stared hard at the flushed Peggy
and breathlessly awaited developments.
"It won't do to trifle with this chap,
Peggy," said Monty, coming quite close
to her. "Don't lead ; him on. He might
get nasty If he thinks you're making sport
of him."
"You are quite absurd, Monty," she
crl-ed, petulantly. "I am not making
sport of him."
"Well, then, why don't you tell him to
go about his business?"
"I don't see any beads lying around
loose," said "Rip" tormentinÂ£ly. The
sheik impatiently said something to the
interpreter and that worthy reofiated it
for Peggy's benefit.
"The Son of the Prophet desires that you
be as quick as possible, Queen of the
World. He tires of waiting and com
mands you to come with him at once."
Peggy winced and her eyes shot a brief
look of scorn at the scowling sheik. In
an Instant, however, she was smiling
agreeably and was turning toward the
steps.
"Holy mackerel! Where are you going,
Peggy?" cried Lotless, the first to turn
fearful.
"To throw some things into my trunk,"
she responded airily. "Will you come
with me, Mary?"
"Peggy!" cried Brewster angrily. "This
has gone far enough."
"You should have spoken sooner,
Monty," she said quietly.
"What are you going to do, Margaret 7"
cried' Mrs. Dan, her eyes wide with
amazement.
"I am going to marry the Son of the
'One of the Boats Came Up and They
Were Drawn Over the Side
to Safety."
Prophet," she replied so decidedly that
every one gasped. A moment later she
was surrounded by a group of excited
women, and Captain Perry was culling the
"Jackles" forward in a voice of thunder.
Brewster pushed his way to her side,
his face as white as death.
"This isn't a Joke, Peggy," he cried.
"Go below and I'll get rid of the sheik."
Just then the burly Algerian asserted
himself. He did not like ,the way in
which hla adored one was being handled
by the "white dogs," and with two spear
men he rushed up to Brewster, Jabbering
angrily.
"Stand back, you Idiot, or I'll punch
your head off," said Brewster, with sud
den emphasis.
It was not until this moment that Peggy
realized that there might be a serious
side to the little farce she and Mary had
decided to play for the punishment of
Brewster. Terror suddenly took the place
of mirth and she clung frantically to
Monty's arm.
"I was Joking. Monty, only Joking," she
cried. "Oh, what have I done?"
"It is my fault," he exclaimofl, "but I'll
take care of you, never fear." Jj
"Stand aside!" roared the sheik threat
eningly.
The situation was ominous. Fr.'ghtened
as they were the women could not flee,
but stood as if petrified. Sailors eagerly
swarmed to the deck.
"Get off this boat," said Monty, omi
nously calm, to the interpreter, "or we'll
pitch you and your whole mob into the
sea."
"Keep cool! Keep cool!" cried "Sub
way" Smith quickly. He stepped between
Brewster and the angry suitor, and that
action alone prevented serious trouble.
While he parleyed with the sheik Mrs. De-
Mllle hurried Peggy to a safe place below
deck, and they were followed by a flock
of shivering women. Poor Peggy was al
most in tears with the piteous glances she
threw at Brewster when he stepped be
tween her and the ImDetuous sheik, who
had started to follow, struck deep into his
heart and made him ready to fight to the
death for her.
It took nearly an hour to con
vince the Algerian that Peggy had
misunderstood him and that Amer
ican women . wÂ«re not -to â¢ be
wooed after the African fashion. He
finally departed -with his entire train,
thoroughly dissatisfied and in high dudg
eon. At first he threatened to take her
by force; then he agreed to give her an
other day in which to make up her mind
to go with him peaceably, and again he
concluded that a bird in the hand was
worth two in the bush. "
That night Brewster entertained on board
the yacht, several resident French and
English acquaintances being the guests of
honor. The story of the day was told by
Mrs. Dan DeMillc, commissioned especi
ally for the duty. She painted the scene
so vividly that the guests laughed with
Joy over the discomfiture of the sheik.
Peggy and Brewster found themselves
looking sheepishly at one another now
and then In the course of the recital. She
purposely had avoided him during the
evening, but she had gamely endured the
raillery that came from the rest of the
party. If aha waa a bit pale it was not
surprising. Now that It was over the
whole affair appalled her more than she
could have suspected. When several of
the guests of the evening soberly an
nounced that Mohammed waa a danger
ous man and even an object of worry to
the government, she ftlt a strange catch
in her thoat and her now mirthless eyes
turned instinctively ta Brewster, who. It
seemed, was the sheik's special object of
aversion.
The next day she and Monty talked it
over. The penitence of both was beauti
ful to behold. Each denied the other the
privilege of assuming all the blame and
both were bo happy that Mohammed was
little more than a preposition in their con
versation so far aa prominence waa con
cerned. But all day long the harbor was
full of flsher boat*, and at nightfall they
still were lolling about, sinister, restless,
mysterious like purposeless buzzards. And
the dark men on board were taking up
no flsh, neither were they minding the
net* that lay dry and folded in the bot
tom of their boats.
Far into the night there was revelry on
board the Flitter, mote guests having
come out from the city. The dark hours
before the dawn of day had arrived be
fore they put oft for shore, but the flsher
boats were still bobbing about in the
black waters of the harbor. The lights
gradually disappeared from the port-holes
of the yacht, and the tired watch was
about to be relieved. Monty Brewster
and Peggy remained on deck after the
guests had gone over the side of the ves
sel. They were leaning over the rail aft
listening to the Jovial voices of the visit
ors as they grew fainter and fainter in
the. distance. The lights of the town were
few, but they could plainly be seen from
the offing.
"Are ycu tired, Peggy?" asked Brew-
Bter, with a touch of tenderness. Some
how of late he had often felt a strange
desire to take her In his arms, and now
it was strong upon him. She was very
near, and there was a drooping weariness
in her attitude, which seemed to demand
protection.
"I have a queer feeling that something
awful Is going to happen to-night,
Monty," she answered, trouble in her soft
voice.
"You're nerrous, that's all," he 'said,
"and you should get to sleep. Good
night." Their bands touched In the dark
ness, and the thrill that went over him
told a truth of which he had been only
vaguely consoious. The power of it made
him exultant Yet when he thought of
her and her too quiet affection for him it
left him despondent.
Something, bumped against the side of
"Try as He Would, Monty Could Not
See Peggy Alone."
the ship and a grating sound followed.
Then came other gentle thuds, combined
with the soft swish of water disturbed.
Prggy anu Brewster were on the point of
going below when their attention was
caught by these strange sounds.
"What is it?" she asked as they paused
Irresolutely. He strode to the rail, the
?irl following close behind. Three sharp
little whistles came from above anil be
hind them, but before they had time even
to speculate as to their meaning the re
sult was in evidence.
Over the aides of the ship came shad
owy forms as if by magic; at their backs
panther-like bodies dropped to the deck
with stealthy thuds, as if coming from
the inky sky above. There was in Instant
of dreadful calm and then the' crisis. A
flozen sinewy forms hurled themselves
upon Brewster, who, taken completely by
surprise, was thrown to the deck in an
Instant, his attem.pt to cry out for help
being checked by heavy hands. Peggy's
scream was cut off as quickly, and para
lyzed by terror, she felt herself engulfed
In strong arms and smothered Into si
lence. It all happened so quickly that
there was no chance to give the alarm, no
opportunity to resist. ,
Brewster felt himself lifted bodily, nnd
then there was the sensation of falling.
He struck something forcibly with all his
weight^and fell back with a crash to the
deck. Afterward lie found that the ef
fort to throw him overboard had failed
inly because his assailants in their haste
had hurled himself against an unseen
stanchion. Peggy was borne forward and
lowered swiftly Into arms that deposited
her roughly upon something hard. There
was a Jerky, rocking motion, the sudden
splash of oars, and then she knew no
more.
The invaders had planned with a,*craftl
ness and patience that deserved success.
For hours they had waited, silently,
watchfully and with deadly assurance.
How they crept up to the "Flitter"" in
such numbers. and how the more daring
:ame aboard long- before the blow was
struck, no one ever explained. Bo quick
ly and bo accurately was the abduction
performed .that the boats were well clear
of the yacht before alarm was given by
one of the watch who had been over
looked in. the careful assault.
Sleepy sailors rushed on deck with a
promptitude that, was amazing. Very
quickly they hafl found and unbound
Brewster, carried a couple of wounded
shipmates below and had Captain Perry
in his pajamas on deck to take command.
"The searchlight!" cried Brewster fran
tically. "The devils have stolen Miss
Gray."
While swift hands were lowering
the boats for the chase others were
carrying firearms on deck. The
searchlight threw its mighty white
arm out over the water before many sec
onds had passed, and eager eyes were
looking for the boats of the pillagers. The
ArabsLhad reckoned without the search
light. Their fierce exultation died sud
denly when the mysterious streak of light
into the sky and then swept down
upon the sea, hunting them out of th?
darkness like a great and relentless eye.
The "Flitter's" boats were in the water
and manned by sturdy oarsmen before the
glad cry went up that the robber fleet had
been discovered. They were so near the
yacht that it was evident the dusky
tribesmen were poor oarsmen. In the
clear light from the ship's deck they could
be seen paddling wildly, their white robes
fluttering as though Inspired by fear.
There were four boats, all of them crowd
ed to the gunwales.
"Keep the light on them, captain,"
shouted Monty from below. "Try to pick
out the boat that has Miss Gray on board.
Pull away, boys! This means a hundred
dollars to every one of you â yes, a thou
sand If we have to fight for her!"
"Kill every damned one of them, Mr.
Brewster," roared the captain, who had
retired behind a boat when he became
aware of the presence of women on deck.
Three boats shot away from the side of
the yacht, Brewster and Joe Bragdon in
the first, both armed with rifles.
"Let's take a shot at 'em," cried a sail
or who stood in the stern with his finger
on a trigger.
V'Don't do that! "We don't know -what
boat holds Peggy," commanded Brewster.
"Keep cool, boys, and be ready to scrap
if we have to." He was half mad with
fear and anxiety, and he was determined
to exterminate the bands of robbers If
harm had come to the girl In their power.
"She's in the second boat," came the
cry from the yacht, and the searchlight
was kept on that particular object almost
to the exclusion of the others. But Cap
tain Perry saw the wisdom of keeping all
of them clearly located In order to pre
vent trickery.
Brewster's brawny sailor boys came up
like greyhounds, cheering as they dashed
among the boats of the fugitives. Three
or four shots were fired Into the air by
the zealous American lads, and there were
loud cries from the Arabs as they veered
off panic-stricken. Monty's boat was now
In the path of light and not far behind
the one which held Peggy. He was
standing in the bow.
"Take care ofÂ«thÂ© others!" he 'called
back to his .followers. "We'll go after
the leaders."
The response from behind was a cheer,
a half dozen shots and some of the most
Joyous profanity that ever fell from the
lips of American sailors, mingled with
shrieks from the boats they were to "take
care of."
"Stop!" Brewster shouted to the Arabs.
"Stop, or we'll kill every one of you!"
His boat was not more than fifty feet
from the other.
Suddenly a tall, white-robed figure arose
in the middle 'of the Egyptian craft, and
a moment later the pursuers saw Peggy's
form passed up to him. She was in
stantly clasped by one of his long arms,
and the other "was lifted high above her.
A gleaming knife was held in the up
raised hand.
"Fire on us If you dare!" came In
French from the tall Arab. Â¦"Dog bf
an American, she shall die If you come
near her!"
Brewster'3 heart almost ceased beating.
'Peggy Was the One Eebel Against
the Conspiracy."
and every vestige of color left his face.
Clear and distinct in the light from the
yarht the Arab and his burden were
outlined against the black screen beyond.
There was no mistaking the earnestness
of the threat, nor could the witnesses
doubt the ghastly Intention of the long-,
cruel knife that gleamed on high. Peg
gy's body served as a shield for that of
her captor. Brewster and Bragdon rec
ognized the man as one of Mohammed's
principal retainers, a fierce-looking fel
low who had attracted more than usual
attention on the day of the sheik's visit.
"For Gods sake, don't kill her!" cried
Brewster In agonized tones. There was
a diabolical grin on the face of the Arab,
who was about to shout bark some de
fiant taunt when the unexpected hap
pened.
The sharp crack of a gun sounded In
the stern of firewater's boat, and an un
erring bullet sped straight for the big
Arab's forehead.
It crashed between his eyes and death
must have been Instantaneous. The knits
flew from h!s hand, his body straightened
and then collapsed, toppling over, not
among his oarsmen, but across the gun
wale of the craft. Before a hand could
be lifted to prevent, the dead Arab and
the girl were plunged into the sea.
A cry of horror went up from the Amer
icans, and something surprisingly UKÂ© a
shout of triumph from the abductors.
Even as Brewster poised for the spring
Into the water a flying form shot past
him and into the sea with a resounding
splash. The man that fired the shot had
reckoned cleverly, and he was carrying
out the final details of an inspired plan.
The Arab's position as he stood in the
boat was such as to warrant the sailor s
belief that he could fall no other way.
than forward, and that meant over the
side of the boat. With all this clearly
In mind he had shot straight and true
and was on his way to the water almost
as the two toppled overboard.
Monty Brewster was In the water an
Instant later, striking out for the spot
where they had disappeared, a little to
the left of the course In which his boat
was running. There was a rattle of fire
arms, with curses and cheers, but he paid
no heed to these sounds. He was a length
or two behind the sailor, praying with all
his soul that one or the other might suc
ceed In reaching the white robes that
Btill kept the surface of the water. His
crew was "backing water" and straining
every muscle to bring the boat around
sharp for the rescue.
The Bailor's powerful strokes brought
him to the spot first, but not in time to
clutch the disappearing white robes. Just
\a he reached out an arm to grasp the
form of the girl she went down. He did
not hesitate a second, but followed.
Peggy had fallen from the dead Arab's
embrace, and that worthy already was
at the bottom of the sea. She was half
conscious when the shot came, but the
plunge Into the cold water revived her.
Her struggles were enough to keep her
up for a few moments, but not long
snough for the swimmers to reach her
3lde. She felt herself going down and
Jown, strangling, smothering, dying. Then
something vise-like clutching her arm and
she had the sensation of being Jerked up
ward violently.
The sailor fought his way to the sur
face with the girl, and Brewster was at
tils side In an Instant. â¢ "Together they
supported her until one of the boats
came up, and they were drawn
over the side to safety. By this time the
abductors had scattered like sheep with
out a leader, and as there was no further
object in pursuing them the little Ameri
can fleet put back for the yacht in great
haste. Peggy was quite conscious when
carried aboard by the triumphant Brew
ster. The words he whispered to her as
she lay in the bottom of the boat were
enough to give her life.
The excitement on board the Flitter was
boundless. Fear gave way to Joy. and
where despair had for a moment reigned
supreme, there was now the most Insane
delight. Peggy was bundled below and
into her berth. Dr. Lotless attending her.
assisted by all the women on board.
Brewster and the sailor, drenched but
happy, were carried on the shoulders of
enthusiastic supporters to a place where
hot toddles were to be had before blan
kets.
The next morning he proposed to hunt
for the sheik, and offered to lead an as
sault In person. An Investigation was
made and government officials tried to
call Mohammed to account, but he had
fled to the desert and the search was
fruitless.
Brewster refused to acc*pt a share of
the glory of Peggy's rescue, pushing Con
roy forward as the real hero. But the
sailor Insisted that he could not have
succeeded without helpâ that he was com
pletely exhausted when Montv came to
the rescue. Peggy found It hard to thank
him gently while her heart was so dan
gerously near the riot point, and her
words of gratitude sounded pitifully weak
and insufficient.
"It would have been the same had any
body else gone to her rescue," he mused
dejectedly. "She cares for me with the
devotion of a sister and thafs all. Peggy.
Peggy," he moaned, "If you could only
love me, I'dâ I'dâ oh, well, there's no use
thinking about it! She will love some
one else, of course, andâ and be happy,
too. If she'd appear only ono- tenth as
grateful to me as to Conroy I'd be satis
fied. He had the luck to be first, thafs
all, but God knows I tried to do it."
-Peggy was not herself for several dAys
after her experience, and the whole party
felt a distinct relief when the yacht
finally left the harbor and steamed off to
the west. A cablegram that came the
day before may have had something to
do with Brewster's depression, but he
was not the sort to confess it. It was
from Swearengen Jones of Butte, Mont..
and there was something sinister In the
laconic admonition. It read:
Brewster, U. S. Consulate. Alexandria: nave
a. good time while good times last. JOSIS3.
His brain was almost bursting with
the hopes and fears and uncertainties
that crowded It far beyond Its ordinary
capacity. It had come to the point, it
seemed to him, when the brains of a
dozen men at least were recimred to
operate the affairs that were surging Into
his alone. The mere fact that the end of
his year was less than two months off,
and that there was more or less uncer
tainty as to the character of the end,
was sufficient cause for worry, but the
new trouble was infinitely harder to en
dure. "When he sat down to think over
his financial enterprises his mind treach
erously wandered off to Peggy Gray, and
then everything was hopeless. He re
called the courage and confidence that
had carried him to Barbara Drew with a
declaration of loveâ to the stunning,
worldly Barbaraâ and smiled bitterly
when he saw how basely two allies were
deserting him in thla hour of love for
Peggy Gray. For some reason he had
felt sure of Barbara; for another^ reason
he saw no chance with Peggy- She was
not the same sortâ she was different. She
wasâ well, she was Peggy, y v~
Occasionally his reflections assumed the
Importance of calculations. His cruise
was sure to cost $200,000, a princely sum,
but not enough. Swearengen Jones and
his cablegrams did not awe him to a
great extent. The spending of the million
had become a mania with him now and
he had no regard for consequences. Ills
cne desire, aside from Peggy, was to in
crease the cost of the cruise. They were
leaving Gibraltar when a new idea cam*
Into his troubled head.
He decided to change his plans and sail
for the North Cape, thereby adding more
than J30.000 to his credit.

BREWSTER'S MILLIONS
By Richard P. GreavesTHE SUNDAY CAUU
Monty gave way to tho depression that
*m bearing down upon him; It waÂ» tha
hardest task of hia Ufa to go on with his
schema In tha face of opposition. He
knew that every man and woman on
board was asmlnst the proposition, for his
sake at least, and It was difficult to be
arbitrary under tha circumstances. Pur-'
posely ho avoided Peggy all forenoon. His
single (lance- at her fa.ee In the salon was
enough to disturb him Immeasurably.
The spirits of tho crowd were subdued.
Tha North Capo had charms, but tha
proclamation concerning It had been too
saddenâ had reversed too quickly the gen
eral expectation and desire. Many of the
guests had plans at home for August and
even those who had none were satiated
with excitement During tha morning they
gathered in little- knots to discuss the sit
uation. They were all generous and each
one was sure that ha could cruise indefl
citely. if on Montys account tha now voy
?*,! ?.*?*. n . Ot ? Ut ot **â¢ nation. They
felt It their duty to take a desperate
stand.
The half-hearted little gatherings re
solved themselves into ominous groups
and in the end there waa a call for a gen
ial meeting la tha main cabin. C^pUm
Perry, the first mate* and tha chief en
gineer -were included la tha call. but
Montgomery Brewster was not to ba ad
mitted. Joe Bragdon loyally agreed to
Keep him engaged elsewhere while the
xneetliic was in progress. The doors were
1 . * Od a Slance assured the
chairman of the meeting. Dan DeMllle,
that no member of tha party was miss-
Ing save the devoted Bragdon. Captain
Perry was plainly nervous and disturbed.
The others were the victims of a sup
pressed energy that presaged subsequent
eruptions.
An hour later the meeting broke up and
the oonsplrators made their way to the
deck. It wma a strange fact that no one
Â¦went alone. They were in groups of three
and four and the mystery that hung
about them was almost perceptible. Not
one was willing to faoe the excited, buoy
ant Brewster without help: they found
strength and security in companionship.
P*g*y was the one rebel against the
conspiracy, and yet she knew that the
others were justified In the step they pro
posed to take. She reluctantly Joined
them In tha end. but felt that she was
the darkest traitor in the crowd. Forget
ting her own distress over the way in
which Monty 'was squandering his for
tune, she stood out the one defender of
his rights until the end and then admitted
tearfully to Mrs. DeMllle that she had
been "quite unreasonable" In doing so.
Alone In ber stateroom after signing the
agreement, she wondered what be would
tfr^nv of her. She owed him so much that
she at least should have stood by him.
She felt that he would be conscious of
this. How could she have turned against
him? He would not understandâ of
course, he would never understand. And
he would hate her with the othersâ more
than the others. It was all a wretched
muddle and she could not see her way out
of it
Itonty found his guests very difficult
They listened to his plans with but little
Interest and he could not but see that
they were uncomfortable. The situation
Â¦was new to their experience, and thÂ»Â»v
were under a strain. "They mope around
like a lot of pouting boys and girls." he
growled to himself. "But It's the North
Cape now in spite of everything, I don't
care If tha whole crowd deserts me, my
mind is ' made up."
Try as he would.*hÂ« could not see Peggy
alone. He had much that he wanted to
say to ber and he hungered for the con
solation her approval would bring him,
but she clung to Pettlnglll with a ten
acity that was discouraging. The old
feeling of Jealousy that was connected
with Como again disturbed him.
"She thinks that I am & hopeless, brain
less idiot" he said to himself. "And I
don't blame her. either."
Just before nightfall he noticed that
his friends were assembling; in the bow.
As he started to Join the group "Sub
way" Smith and DeMille advanced to
meet him. Some of the others were smil
lcg a little sheepishly, but the two men
were pictures of solemnity and decision.
"Monty." said DeMllle steadily, "we
have been conspiring against you and
have decided that we sail for New York
to-morrow morning;."
Breweter stopped short and the expres
sion on his face was one they never could
forget. Bewilderment, uncertainty and
pain succeeded each other like flashes of
light Not a word was spoken for sev
eral seconds. The red of humiliation
slowly mounted to his cheeks, while In
his eyas wavered the look of one who
has bean hunted down.
"You have â¢decided?" he asked lifelessly,
and more than one heart went out in
pity to him.
"We hated to do it, Monty, but for your
own sake there was no otner wajj," said
"Subway" Smith quickly. "We took a
vote and there wasn't a dissenting voice."
"It is a plain case of mutiny, I take it,"
Â¦aid Monty, utterly alone and heart sick.
"It Isn't necessary to tell you why we
have taken this step." said DeMllle. "It
is heart breaking to oppose you at this
stage of the game. You've been the best
â¢ver andâ"
"Cut that," cried Monty, and his confi
dence in himself was fast returning. "This
Is no time to throw bouquets."
"We like you. Brewster," Mr. Valen
tine came to the chairman's assistance
because the others had looked at him so
appealingly. "We like you so well that
we can't take the responsibility for your
extravagance. It would disgrace us all."
"That Â«ida of the matter was never
mentioned." cried Peggy indignantly, and
then added with a catch in her roice,
â¢â¢We thought only of you."
"I appreciate your motives and I am
grateful to you," eaid Monty. "I am
jnoT9 sorry than I can tell you that the
cruise must ead in this way, but I, too,
have decided. The yacht will take you
to some solnt where you can catch a
eteamer to New York. I ehall secure pas
sage for the entire party and very
soon you will be at home. Captain
Perry, will you oblige me by mak
ing at once for any port that my guests
may agree upon?" He was turning away
deliberately when "Subway" Smith de
tained him.
"What do you mean by getting a
steamer to New York? Isn't the Flitter
rood enough?" he asked.
"The Flitter la not going to New York
Just now," answered Brewster firmly,
"notwithstanding your ultimatum. She
la going to take me to the North Cape."
CHAPTER XXVII.
"We have found a solution of our diffi
culties," said DeMllle at an executive
meeting of the conspirators a little later,
and his manner was so Jubilant
that every one became hopeful.
â¢â¢It Is desperate, but I think it will
be effective. Monty has given us the
privilege of leaving the yacht at any port
where we can take a steamer to New
Tork. Now. my suggestion la that we se
lect the most convenient place for all of
vs. and obviously there la nothing quite
â¢o convenient as Boston."
"Dan DeMllle, you are quite foolish,"
cried his wife. "Who ever conceived such
a ridiculous idea?"
"Captain Perry has his Instructions,"
continued DeMille. turning to the captain.
"Are we not acting along the lines marked
out by Brewster himself?"
"I will sail for Boston If you cay tha
word," eald the thoughtful captain. "But
he is sure to countermand such an order."
"He won't be abla to, captain," cried
"Subway" Smith, who had for some time
been eager to Join in tha conversation.
"This is a genuine, dyed-ln-the-wool mu
tiny, and we expect to cary out the orig
inal plan, which was to put Mr. Brewster
in irons until we ara safe from all oppo
sition."
"Ha is my friend, Mr. Smith, and at
least it Is my duty to protect him from
any indignity," Bald the captain, atiffiy.
"You make for Boston, my dear cap
tain, and we'll do the rest," said DeMllle.
"Mr. Brewster can't countermand your
orders unless be sees you in person.
We'll sea to it that ha has no chance to
talk to you until we ara in sight of Bos
ton harbor."
Tha captain looked doubtful and shook
his bead as he walked away. At heart
he was with the mutineers and hi? mind
was made up to assist them as long as
it was possible to do so without violating
his obligations to Brewster. He felt guil
ty, however, in surreptitiously giving tne
order to clear for Boston at daybreak.
The chief officers were let into the secret,
but tha sailors were kept In darkness re
garding the destination of tho Flitter.
Montgomery Brewster's guests were im
mensely pleased with the scheme, al
though they were dubious about the out
come. Mrs. Dan regretted her hasty com
ment on tho plan and entered into tho
plot with eagerness. In accordance with
plans decided upon by the mutineers,
Monty's stateroom door was guarded
through the night by two of the men.
For three days and two nights the
Flitter steamed westward into the At
lantic, with her temporary owner locked
in his stateroom. The confinement was
Irksome, but he rather liked the sensa
tion of being Interested In something be
sides money. He frequently laughed to
himself over the absurdity of the situa
tion. His enemies were friends, true and
devoted; his Jailers were relentless, but
they were considerate. The original or
der that be should be guarded by one
man was violated on the first day. There
were times when his guard numbered at
least ten persons and some of them
served tea and begged him to listen to
reason.
"It is difficult not to listen," he said
fiercely. "It's like holding a man down
and then asking him to be quiet But
my time is coming." Â¦
"Revenge will be his!" exclaimed Mrs.
Dan. tragically.
"You might have your term shortened
on account of good conduct if you would
only behave," suggested Peggy, whose
reserve was beginning to shorten. "Please
be good and give in."
"I haven't been* happier during
the whole cruise," said Mon
ty. "On deck I wouldn't
be noticed, but here I am quite the
whole thing. Besides I can , get out
whenever I feel like it."
"I have a thousand dollars which says
you can't" Bald DeMllle, and Monty
snapped him up so eagerly that he
added, "that you can't get out of your
own accord."
Monty acceded to the condition and
offered odds on the proposition to the
others, but there were no takers.
"That settles it," he smiled grimly to
himself. "I can make a thousand dol
lars by staying here and I can't afford
to escape."
On the third day of Monty's Imprison
ment the Flitter began to roll heavily.
At first he gloated over the discomfort
of his guards who obviously did not like
to stay below. "Subway" Smith and
Bragdon were on duty and neither was
famous as a good sailor. When Monty
lighted bis pipe there was consternation
and "Subway" rushed on deck.
"You are a brave man, Joe," Monty
said to the other and blew a cloud of
smoke In his direction. "I knew you
would stick to your post. You wouldn't
leave it even if the ship should go
down."
Bragdon had reached the stage where
he dared not speak and was busying
himself trying to "breathe with the
motion of the boat." as he had called it.
"By Gad," continued Monty, relent-
"His Jailers Were Relentless, but
They Were Considerate." .
lessly. "This smoke Is getting thick.
Some of this toilet -water might help
if I sprinkled it about"
One whiff of the sweet-smelling
cologne waa enough for Bragdon and
he bolted up the companionway, leaving
the stateroom door wide open and the
prisoner free to go wnere he pleased.
Monty's first Impulse waa to follow, but
he checked himself on the threshold.
"Damn that bet with DeMille," he
said to himself, and added aloud to the
fleeing guard, "The key, Joe, I dare
you to come back and get It!"
But Bragdon was beyond recall and
Monty locked the door on the inside and
passed the key through the ventilator.
On deck a small part of the company
braved the spray in tne lee of the deck
house, but the others had long since
gone below. The boat was pitching fur
iously In the ugliest sea it had encount
ered, and there was anxiety underneath
Captain Perry's mask of unconcern. De-
Mille and Dr. Lotless talked in the
eenseleBs way men have when they try I
to conceal their nervousness. But the \
women did not respond; they were in no Â¦
mood for conversation.
Only one of them waa quite oblivious .
to personal discomfort and' danger. ,
Peggy Gray was thinking of the prison- ,
er below. In a reflection of bar own ,
terror she pictured him crouching in tha
little stateroom, like n doomed criminal :
awaiting execution, alone, neglected, for- '
gotten, unpltled. At first she pleaOed i
with the man for his release, but they '
insisted upon waiting in the hope that
a aoaro might bring him to his senses.
Peggy saw that no help was to be se
cured from the other women, much as
they might care for Brewster's peace
of mind and safety. Her. heart wal
bitter toward every one responsible for
the situation, and there was dark re
bellion in her bouL it culminated finally
in a resolve to release Monty Brewster
at any cost.
With difficulty she made her way to
the etateroom door, clinging to sup
ports at times and then plunging vio
lently away from them. For some min
utea aha listened, frantically clutching
Brewster's door and the wall-ralL There
waa no guard, atid the tumult of the
sea drowned every sound within. Her
imagination ran riot when her repeated
calls were not answered.
"Monty, Monty," she cried, pounding
wildly on the door.
"Who is it? What is the. trouble T'
came in muffled tones from within, and
Peggy breathed a prayer of thanks.
Just then she discovered the key which
Monty had dropped and quickly opened
the door, expecting to nnd him cowering
with fear. But the picture was differ
ent The prisoner was seated on the
divan, propped up with many pillows
and reading with the aid of an electric
light "The Intrusions of Peggy."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
A CATASTROPHE.
"Oh!" was Peggy's only exclamation,
and there was a shadow of disappoint
ment in her eyes.
"Come in, Peggy, and I'll read aloud,"
was Monty's cheerful greeting as he Btood
before her.
"No; I must go," said Peggy, confused
ly. I thought you might be nervous
about the stormâ and "
"And you came to let me out?" Monty
had never been bo happy.
"Yes; and I don't care what the others
say. I thought you were suffering "
But at that moment the boat gave a lurch
which threw her across the threshold in
to Monty's arms. They crashed against
the wall and he held her a moment and
forgot the storm. When she drew away
from him she showed him the open door
and freedom. She could not speak.
"Where are the othersT" he asked,
bracing himself in the doorway.
"Oh, Monty," she cried, "we must not
go to them. They will think me a traitor."
"Why were you a traitor, Peggy?" he
demanded, turning toward her suddenly.
"Oh â oh, because It seemed so cruel to
keep you locked up through the storm,",
she answered, blushing.
"And there was no other reason?" he
persisted.
"Don't, please don't!" she cried, piteous
ly, and he misunderstood her emotion. It
waa clear that she was merely sorry for
him.
"Never mind, Peggy; It's all right. You

a Good Time During the Week."-
stood by me and I'll stand by you. Come
on; we'll face the mob and I'll do the
fighting."
Together they made their way Into the
presence of the mutineers, who were
crowded into the main cabin.
"Well, here's a conspiracy," cried Dan
De Mille, but there was no anger in his
voice. "How did you escape? I was just
thinking of unlocking your door, Monty,
but the key seemed to be missing."
Peggy displayed it triumphantly.
"By Joye," cried Dan. "This is rank
treachery. Who was on guard?"
A steward rushing through the cabin at
this moment in answer to frantic calls
from Bragdon furnished an eloquent re
ply to the question.
"It was simple," eaid Monty. "The
guards deserted their post and left the
key behind."
"Then it is up to me to pay you a thou
sand dollars."
"Not at all, "protested Monty, taken
aback. "I did not escape of my own ac
cord. I had help. The money is yours.
And now that I am free," he added,
quietly, " iet me say that this boat does
not go to Boston."
"Just what I expected," said' Vander
pool. ;
"She's going straight to New York!"
declared Monty. The words were hardly
uttered when a heavy sea sent him
sprawling across the cabin, and he con
cluded, "or to the bottom."
"Not so bad as that," said Captain
Perry, whose entrance ,had been some
what hastened by the lurch of the boat.
"But until this blows over I must keep
you below." He laughed, birt he saw they
were not deceived. "The seas are pretty
heavy and the decks are being holystoned
for rtothlng, but I wouldn't like to have
any one washed overboard by mistake."
The hatches were battened down, and
It was a sorry company that tried to
while away the evening in the main
cabin. Monty's chaffing about the ad
vantages "of the | North Cape over the
stormy Atlantic was not calculated to
raise the drooping spirits, and it was very
early when he' and his shattered guests
turned in. There was little sleep on board
the Flitter that night Even If it had
been easy to forget the danger, the creak
ing of tha ship and the incessant roar of
tha water were enough for wakef ulness.
With each lurch of the boat It seamed
more incredible that it could endure. It
was such a mite of a thing to meet so
furious an attack. As it rose on the wave
to pausa In terror on its crest before sink
ing shivering into the trough it made
tha breath coma short and the heart stand
still. Through the night the fragile little
craft fought its lonely way, bravely ig
noring its own weakness and the Infinite
strength of ita enemy. To the captain,
lashed to the bridge, there were hours of
grave anxietyâ hours when he feared each
wave as it approached, Â¦ and wondered
what new damage it had done as It re
coded. As the wind increased toward
morning ha felt a sickening certainty that
the brave little boat was beaten. Some
how she seemed to lose courage, to waver
a bit and almost give up the fight. He
watched her miserably as the dismal
dawn came up out of the sea. Yet It was
not until 7 o'clock that the crash came,
which ihook the pasengera out of their
berths and filled them with shivering
terror. The whirling of the broken
shaft seemed to consume the ship. In
every cabin it spoke with horrible vivid
ness of disaster. The clamor of voices
and the rush of many feet, which fol
lowed, meant but one thing. Almost in
stantly the machinery was stoppedâ an
ominous silence in the midst of the dull
roar of the water and the cry of the
the sea."
It was a terrified crowd that quickly
gathered in the main cabin, but it was a
brave one. There were no cries and few
tears. They expected anything and were
ready for the worst, but they would not
show the white feather. It was Mrs. Dan
who broke the tension. "I made sure of
my pearls," she said; "I thought they
would be appreciated at the bottom of
the sea."
Brewster came upon their laughter. "I
like your nerve, people," he exclaimed,
"you are all right. It 'won't be so bad
now. The wind has dropped."
Toward night the worst was over. The
sea had gone down and the hatches were
opened for a while to admit air, though
it was still too rough to venture out. The
next morning was bright and clear. When
the company gathered on deck the havoc
created by the storm was .apparent. Two

Extravagance."
of the boats had been completely carried
away and the launch was rendered use
less by a large hole in the stern.
"You jlon't mean to say that we will
drift about until the repairs can be
made?" asked Mrs. Dan in alarm. .
"We are three hundred miles off the
course already," explained Monty? "and
it will be pretty slow' traveling under
sail."
It was decided to make for the Canary
Islands, where repairs could be made and
the voyage resumed. But where the
wind had raged a few days before, it had
now disappeared altogether, and for a
week the Flitter tossed about absolute
ly unable to make headway. The first of
August had arrived and Monty himself
was beginning to be nervous. With the
fatal day not quite two months away,
things began to look serious. Over one
hundred thousand dollars would remain
after he had settled the expenses of the
cruise, and he was helplessly drifting in
mld-ccean. Even if the necessary repairs
could be made promptly, it would take the*
Flitter fourteen days to sail from the
Canaries to New York. Figure as hard
as he could he saw no way out of the
unfortunate situation. Two days more
elapsed and still no sign of a breeze. He
made sure ttyat September 23d would find
him still drifting and still In possession of
one hundred thousand superfluous dollars.
At the end of ten days the yacht had
progressed but two hundred miles and
Monty was beginning to plan the rest of
his existence on a capital of $100,000. He
had given up all hope of the Sedgwick
legacy and was trying to be resigned to
his fate, when a tramp steamer was sud
denly sighted. Brewster ordered the
man on watch to fly a flag of distress.
Then he reported to the captain and told
what he had done. With a bound the
captain rushed on deck and tore the flag
from the sailor's hand.
"That was my order," said Monty, net
tled at the captain's manner.
'"You want them to get a line on us and
claim salvage, do you?"
"What do you mean?"
"If they get a line on us in response to
that flag they will claim the entire value
of the shio as salvage. You want to
spend another $200,000 on this boat?'
"I didn't understand," said Monty,
sheepishly. "But for God's sake, fix It up
somehow. Can't they tow us? I'll pay
for it^' .
Communication was slow, but after an
apparently endless amount of signaling
the captain finally announced that the
freight steamer was bound for South
ampton and would tow the Flitter to that
point for a price.
"Back o Southampton!" groaned
Monty. "That means months before we
get back to New York."
"He says he can get us to Southampton
In ten days," interrupted the captain.
"I can do it! I can do it!" he cried, 'to
the consternation of his guests, who won
dered if his mind were affected. "If he tl
land us in Southampton by the 27th I'll
pay him up to one hundred thousand dol
lars."
After what seemed an age to Monty, the
Flitter, in tow of the freighter Glencoe,
arrived at Southampton. The captain of
the freight boat was a thrifty Scotchman
whose ship was traveling with a light
cargo, and ha was not. therefore, averse
to taking on a tow, But the thought of
salvage had caused him to ask a high
price for the service, and Monty, after a
futile attempt at bargaining, had agreed.
The price was fifty thousand dollars, and
the young man believed more than ever
that everything was ruled by a wise
Providence, which had not deserted him.
His guests were heartsick when they
heard the figure, but were an happy as
Monty at the prospect of reaching land
again.
The Glencoe made several stops before
Southampton was finally reached on the
28th of August, but when the English
coast was sighted every one was too eager
to go ashore to begrudge tha extra day.
Dan DeMllle asked the entire party to be
come his guests for a week's shooting trip
in Scotland, but Monty vetoed the plan
in tha most decided manner.
"We sail for New York on the fastest
boat," said Monty, and hurried off to
learn the sailings and book his party. The
first boat was to sail on the 30th and he
could only secure accommodations for
twelve of- his guests. The rest were
obliged to follow a week later. This was
readily agreed to and Bragdon was left
to see to thÂ«> necessary repairs op the
Flitter and arrange for her homeward

Tactfully Arranged by Mrs.
de Mille."
voyage. Monty gave Bragdon fifteen
thousand dollars for this purpose and ex
tracted a solemn promise that the entire
amount would be used.
"But it won't cost half of this," protest
ed Bragdon.
"You will have to give these people a
good time during the week andâ wellâ you
have promired that I shall never see an
other penny of it. Some day you'll know
why I do this," and Monty felt easier
when -his friend agreed to abide by his
wishes.
He discharged the Flltter's crew, with
five Â¦ months' pay and the reward prom
ised on the night of Peggy's rescue, which
was productive of touching emotions.
Captain Perry and his officers never for
got the farewell of the prodigal, nor could
they hide the regret that marked their
weather-beaten faces.
Plans to dispose of his household goods
and the balance of his cash in the short
time that would be left after he arrived
in New York occupied Monty's attention,
and most men would have given up the
scheme as hopeless. But he did not de
spair. He was still game, and he pre
pared for the final plunge with grim de
termination.- â¢ i
"There should have been a clause in
Jones' conditions about 'weather nermit-
With the condemnation of his friends
ringing in his troubled brain, with the
sneers of acquaintances to distress his
pride, with the jibes of the comic papers
to torture him remorselessly, Brewster
was fast becoming the most miserable
man in" New York. Friends of former
days gave him the cut direct, clubmen
ignored him or scorned him openly, wom
en chilled him with the lcinesa of un
spoken , reproof, and all the world hung
with shadows. The doggedness of de
spair kept him up, but the strain that
pulled down on him was so relentless that
the ntruggle> was losing its equality. Ha
had not expected such a home coming.
Compared with his former self Monty
was now almost a physical wreck, hag
gard, thin and defiant, a shadow of the
once debonair young New Yorker.* an ob
ject of pity and scorn. Ashamed and de
epairlng. he had almost lacked the cour
age to face Mrs. Gray. The consolation
he once gained through her he now de
nied himself and his suffering, peculiar
as it was, was very real. In absolute
recklcssnees he gave dinner af Jer dinner,
party after party, all on a most lavish
scale, many of his guests laughed at him
openly while they enjoyed his hospitality.
The real friends remonstrated, pleaded,
did everything within their power to
check his awful rush to poverty, but with
out success; he was not to be stopped.
At last the furniture began to go, then
the plate, then all the priceless bric-a
brac. Piece by piece it disappeared until
the apartments were empty and he had
squandered almost all of the $40,350 aris
ing from the sales. The servants were
paid off, the apartments relinquished, and
he was beginning to know what it meant
to be "on his uppers." At the banks be
ascertained that the interest on his
moneys amounted to $19,140 86. A week
before the 23d of September, the whole
million was gone, including the amounts
won in lumber and fuel and other luck
less enterprises. He still had about $17.
000 of his Interest money in the banks, but
he had a billion pangs in his heartâ the
interest on his improvidence.
He found some delight in the discovery
that the servants had. robbed him of not
les* than $3500 worth of his belongings,
including the Christmas presents that he
in honor could not have sold. His only
encouragement came from Grant and
Ripley, the lawyers. They Inspired con
fidence in his lagging brain by urging
him on to the end, promising brightness
thereafter. Swearengen Jones was as
mute as the mountains in which he lived.
There was no word from him, there was
no assurance that he would approve of
what had been done to obliterate Edwin
Peter Brewater's legacy.
CHAPTER XXX.
"Monty, you are breaking my heart,"
was the first and only appeal Mrs. Gray
ever made to him. It was two days be
fore the twenty-third and it did not come
until after the "second-hand store" men
had urlven away from her door with the
bulk of his clothing in their wagon. She
and Peggy- had seen little of Brewster,
and nls nervous restlessness alarmed
them. His return was the talk of the
town. Men tried to shun him, but he per
sistently wasted some portion of his for
tune on his unwilling' subjects. When ha
gave $5000 in cash to a Home for News
boys, even his friends Jumped to the con
clusion that he was mad. It was his only
gL. to charity and he excused his motive
in giving at this time by recalling Sedg
wick'Â«Â« injunction to "give sparingly to
charity." Everything was gone from his
thoughts but the overpowering eagerness
to get rid of a few troublesome thou
sands. He felt like an outcast, a pariah,
a hated object that infected every
one with whom he came in contact.
Sleep was almost Impossible, eating
was a farce; he gave elaborate suppers
which he did not touch. Already his best
friends were discussing the advisability
of putting him in a sanitarium where his
mind might be preserved. His case was
looked upon as peculiar in the history of
mankind; no writer could find a parallel,
no one could Imagine a comparison.
Mrs. Gray met him in the hallway of
her home as he was nervously pocketing
the $60 he had received in payment for his
clothes. Her face was like that of a ghost.
He tried to answer her reproof, but the
words would not come, and he fled to his
room, locking the door after him. Ho
ting,' " he said to himself. "A ship
wrecked mariner should not be expected
to sDend a million dollars."
The division of the party for the two
sailings was tactfully arranged by Mrs.
DeMllle. The Valentines chaperoned the
"second table," as "Subway" Smith called
those who were to take the later boat,
and she herself look.ed after the first lot.
Peggy Gray and Monty Brewster were in
the DeMille party. The three days in
England were marked by unparalleled ex
travagance on Monty's part. One of
the local hotels was subsidizeÂ©, for a
week, although the party only stayed
for luncheon, and the Cecil in London
was a ealner by several thousand dol
lars for the brief stop there. It was a
careworn little band that took Monty's
special train for Southampton and em
barked two days later. The "rest cure '
that followed was welcome to all of them
and Brewster was especially glad that
his race was almost run.
Four days out from New York, then
three days, then two days, and then
Brewster began to feel the beginning of
the final whirlwind in profligacy clouding
him oppressively, ominously, unkindly.
Down in his stateroom he drew new es
timates, new calculations, and tried to
balance the old ones so that they ap
peared in the light most favorable to his
designs. Going over the statistics care
fully, he estimated that the cruise, includ
ing repairs and the return of the yacht
to New York, would cost him J210.000 in
round figures. One hundred and thirty
three days marked the length of the voy
age when he reckoned by time and, as
near as he could get at it, the expense
averaged $15S0 a day. According to the
contract, he was to pay for the yacht,
exclusive of the cuisine and personal ser
vice. And he had found It simple enough
to spend the remaining $1080. There were
days, of course, when fully JoOOO disap
peared, and there were others on which
he spent less than $1000. but the average
was secure. Taking everything into con
sideration, Brewster found that his for
tune had dwindled to a few paltry thou
sands in addition to the proceeds which
would come to him from the sale of his
furniture. On the whole he was satlis
fied.
Immediately after the landing Brewster
and Gardner was busy with the details
of settlement. After clearing up all of
the obligations arising from the cruisa
they felt the appropriateness of reflec
tion. It was a difficult moment â a mo
ment when undelivered reproofs were in
the air. But Gardner seemed much the
more melancholy of the two.
Piles of newspapers lay scattered about
the floor of the room in which they sat.
Every one of them contained sensational
stories of the prodigal s trip, with pic
tures, incidents and predictions. Monty
was pained, humiliated and resentful, but
he was honest enough to admit the Jus
tification of much that was said of him.
was at work tnere on me transaction that
was to record the total disappearance of
Edwin Brewster's millionâ his final report
to Swearengen Jones, executor of James
Sedgwick's will. On the floor -were bun
dles of packages, carefully wrapped and
tied, and on the table was the long sheet
of white paper on which the report was
being: drawn. The packages contained re
ceipts â thousands upon thousands of them
â for the dollars he had spent In less than
a year. They were there for the inspec
tion of Swcarengen Jones, faithfully and
honorably keptâ as if the old "Westerner
would go ever in detail the countless doc
uments.
He had. the accounts balanced up to the
hour. On the long sheet lay the record of
his ruthlessness, the epitaph of a million.
In his pocket was exactly |79 08. This was
to last him for less than forty-eight hours
andâ then it would go to join the rest. It
was his plan to visit Grant & RIpley on
the afternoon of the 22d and to read the
report to them in anticipation of the
meeting with Jones on the day following.
Just before noon, after his encounter
with Mrs. Gray, he came down stairs and
boldly, for the first time in days, sought
out Peggy. There was the old smile in
his eyes and the old heartiness in hla
voice when he came upon her in the li
brary. She was not reading. Books,
pleasures and all the joys of life had fled
from her. mind, and she thought only of
the disaster that was coming to the boy
she had always loved. His heart smote
him as he looked into the deep, somber,
frightened eyes, running over with love
and fear for him.
"Peggy, do you think I'm worth any
thing more from your mother? Do you
think she will ask me to live here any
longer?" he asked, steadily, taking her
hand in his. Hers was cold, his as hot as
fire. "You know what you said away off
yonder somewhere, that she'd let me live
here if I deserved it. I am a pauper.
Peggy, and I'm afraid I'll â I may have to
get down to drudgery again. Will she
turn me out? You know I must have
somewhere to live. Shall It be the poor
house? Do you remember saying one day
that I'd end in the poorhouse?"
She was looking into his eyes, dreading
what might be seen In them. But there
was no gleam of insanity there, there was
no fever; instead there was the quiet
smile of the man who Is satisfied with
himself and the world. His voice bore
traces of emotion, but It was the voice of
one who has perfect control of his wits.
"Is it allâ gone, Monty?" she asked, al
most in a whisper.
"Here is the residue of my estate," he
said, opening his purse with steady fin
gers. "I'm back to where I left off a
year ago. The million Is gone and my
wings are clipped." Her face was white,
her heart was In the clutch of ice. How
could he be so calm about it when for
him. she was suffering such agony? Twice
she started to speak, but her voice failed
her. She turned slowly and walked to

the v..nuuw, kiciung hÂ«r back to tne i.w..
who walled bo eadly and yet Â»o heart
lessly.
"1 didn't want the million, Peggy." he
went on. "You think as the r^sst do, I
know, that I was a fool to act as I did.
It would be rank idiocy on my part to
blame you any more than the others for
thinking as you do. Appearances arc
against me; the proof Is overwhelming.
A year ago I was called a man; to-day
they are stripping me of every claim to
that distinction. The world says I am a
fool, a doit, almost a criminalâ but no one
bÂ«lleves I am a man. Peggy, will you feel
better toward me if I tell you that I am
going to begin life all over again? It will
he a new Monty Brewster that starts out
again in a few days, or, if you will, it
shall be the old oneâ the Monty you once
knew."
"The oM Monty." she murmured softly,
dreamily. "It would be good to see him â
so much better than to see the Monty of
the last year."
"And. fn spite of all I have done, Peg
gy, you will stand by me? You won't de
sert me like the rest? You'll be the same
Peesry of the other days?" he cried, his
calmness breaking down.
"How can you ask? Why should you
doubt me?"
For a moment they stood 6llent. each
looking into the heart of the other, each
seeing the beginning of a new day.
"Child." his voice trembled danger
ously, "Iâ I wonder if you care enough
for me toâ toâ " but he could only look
question.
"To start all over again with you?" she
the question.
"Yes â to iru<t yourself to the prodigal
who has returned. Without you, child,
all the rest would be as the husks. Peggy,
I want youâ you! You do love meâ 1 can
6ee it in your eyes, I can feel it in your
presence."
"How lorg you have been in realizing
it," she said pensively as she stretched
out her arms to him. For many minutes
he held her ciose. finding a beautiful
peace in the world again.
â¢â¢How long have j'ou really cared?" he
asked in a. whisper.
"Always. Monty; all my life."
"And 1 too, child, all my life. I know
it now; I"ve known It for months. Oh,
what a fool I was to have wasted this
love of yours and all this love of mine.
But I'll not be a profligate in love, Peg
gy. I'll not squander an atom of it, dear,
not as long as I live."
"And we will build a greater love, Mon
ty, as we build the new life together. We
never can be poor while we have love as
u treasure."
â¢â¢You won't mind being poor with me?"
he asked.
"I can't be poor with you," she said
simply.
"And I might have let all this escape
me," he cried fervently. "Listen, Peggy â
we will start together, you as my wife
and my fortune. You shall be all that is
left to me of the past. Will you marry me
the day after to-morrow? Don't say no,
dearest. I want to begin on that day.
At seven in the morning, dear? Don't
you gee how good the start will be?"
And he pleaded so ardently and so
earnestly thiit he won his point even
though it grew out of a whim that she
could not then understand. She was not
to learn until afterward his object In hav
ing the marriage take place on the morn
ing cf September 23, two hours before the
time set for the turning over of the Sedg
wick millions. If all went well they
would be Brewster's millions before
twelve o'clock, and Peggy's life of pov
erty would cover no more than three
hours of time. She believed him worth
a lifetime of poverty. So they would start
the new life wilh but one possession
love.
CHAPTER XXXL
Soon after noon on the 22d of Septem
ber, Monty folded his report to Swear
engen Jones, stuck it into his pocket and
sallied forth. A parcel delivery wagon
had carried off a mysterious bundle a few
minutes before. Mrs. Gray could not con
ceal her wonder, but Brewster's answers
to her questions threw little light on the
mystery. He could not tell her the big
bundle contained the receipts that were
to prove his sincerity when the time came
to settle with Mr. Jones. Brewster had
used his own form of receipt for every
purchase. Th*e little stub receipt books
had been made to order for him and not
only he but every person In his employ
carried one everywhere. No matter how
trivial the purchase the person who re
ceived a dollar cf BrewBter*s money
t^ned a receipt for the amount. News
boys and bootblacks were the only
beings who escaped the formality;
tips to waiters, porters, cabbies, etc.,
were recorded and afterward put into a
class by themselves. Receipts for the
few dollars remaining in his possession
were to be turned over on the morning
of the 23d and the general report was not
to be completed until 9 o'clock on that
day.
He kissed Peggy good-by. told her to
be ready for a drive at 4 oVclock, and
then went off to find Joe Bragdon and
Elon Gardner. They met him by ap
pointment and to them he confided his
design to be married on the following
day.
"You can't afford it, Monty," exploded
Joe, fearlessly. "Peggy is too good a girl.
By pad. It isn't fair to her."
"We have agreed to begin life to-mor
row. Wait and see the result. I think it
will surprise you. Incidentally it is up to
me to git the license to-day and to en
gage a minister's services. It Is going to
be quiet, you know. Joe, you can be my
best man if ycu like and, Gardie, I'll ex
pect you to sign your name as one of the
witnesses'. To-morrow evening we'll have
supper at Mrs. Gray's and 'among those
present' will not comprise a very large
list, I assure you. But we'll talk about
that later on. Just now I want to ask
you fellows to lend me enough money to
get the license and pay the preacher. I'll
return it to-morrow afternoon."
"Well, I'm damned." exclaimed Gard
ner, utterly dumfounded by the nerve of
the man. But they went with him to get
the license and Bragdon paid for it.
Gardner promised to have the minister at
the Gray house the next morning. Monty's
other requestâ made In deep seriousness
was that Peggy was not to be told of the
little transaction In which the license and
the minister figured so prominently. He
then hurried off to the office of Grant &
Ripley. The bundles of receipts had pre
ceded him.
"Has Jones arrived In town?" was his
first anxious question after the greetings.
"He is not registered at any of the ho
tels," responded Mr. Grant, and Brewster
did not see the troubled look that passed
over his face.
"He'll show up to-night, I presume,"
said he, complacently. The lawyers did
not tell him that all the telegrams they
had sent to Swearengen Jones In the past
two weeks had been returned to the New
York office as unclaimed in Butte. The
telegraph company reported that Mr.
Jones was not to be found and that he
had not been seen In Butte since the 3d
of September. The lawyers were hourly
expecting word from Montana men to
whom they had telegraphed for Informa
tion and advice. They were extremely
nervous, but Montgomery Brewster was
?~Z t-anf r and excited to notice the fact.
"A tall, bearded etranger wai here this
morning aeklng for you, Mr. Drewiter,"
said Ripley, hla head bent over some pa
pers on his desk.
"Ah! jonvi, I'm sure. I've. always Im
agined him with a long beard," eald Mon
ty, relief In his voice.
"It was not Mr. Jones. "We know Jones
quite well. This man was a stranger and
refused to give his name. He said he
would call at Mrs. Gray's this afternoon."
"Did he look like a constable or a bill
collector?" asked Monty, with a laugh.
â¢He looked very much like a tramp."
"Well, we'll forget him for the time be
ing," said Monty, drawing the report
from his pocket. "Would you mind look
ing over this report, gentlemen? I'd like
to know If it Is In proper form to present
to Mr. Jones."
Grant's hand trembled as he took the
carefuMy folded sheet from Brewster. A
"The Queerest-Looking Man Came to
the House to See You This
Afternoon."
quick glance of despair passed between
the two lawyers. ,
"Of course, you'll understand that this
report Is merely a synopsis of the expen
ditures. They are classified, however, and
the receipts over there are arranged in
such a way that Mr. Jones can very
easily verify all the figures set out in the
report. For instance, where It says
'cigars,' I have put down the total
amount that went up in smoke. The re
ceipts are to serve as an itemized state
ment, you know." Mr. Ripley took the
paper from his partner's hand and, pull-
Ing himself together, read the report
aloud. It was as follows: r Â«

age to get back to where I was physi
cally, but I think I can do It with the
vacation that begins to-morrow. Inci
dentally, I'm going to be married to
morrow morning, just when I am poorer
than I ever expect to be agin. I still
have a few dollars to spend and I must
be about It. To-morrow I will account
for what I spend this evening. It la
now covered by the -sundries' Item, but
I'll have the receipts to show, all right.
See youT to-morrow morning:."
He was gone, eager to be with Peggy
afraid to discuss his report with th<
lawyers. Grant and Bipley shook theii
heads and sat silent for a Ions; tlnn
after his departure.
"We ought to hear something deflnltt
before night," said Grant, but thero wai
anxiety in his voice.
"I wonder," mused Ripley, as If tc
himself, "how he wiU take it If thi
worst should happen."
CHAPTER XXXII.
At 11 o'clock Pettingili's studio opened
its doors to the "Little Bons" and theii
guests, and the last "Dutch lunch" was
soon under ..way. Brewster had paid foi
It early in the evening and when he sal
flown at the head of the table there wa*
not a penny In his pockets! \ A year ago
at the same place and at the same hour
he and the "Little Sons" were having e
birthday feast. A million dollars camÂ«
to him on that night. To-night he waÂ«
poorer by far than on the other occasion
but he expected a little gift on the new
anniversary.
Around the board, besides the nine "Lit-
U e^?,? 3 '" l at slx * ues ts. among them th<
DeMilles, Peggy Gray and Mary Valen
tine. "Nopper" Harrison was the only
absent "Little Son," and his health waÂ«
proposed by Brewster almost before the
ichoes of the toast to the bride and groom
died away.
Interruption came earlier on this occa
sion than It did that night a year" ago.
Ellis did not deliver his messages tc
Drewster until 3 o'clock In the morning,
but the A. D. T. boy who rang the bell at
Pettingill's a year later handed him a tel
egram before 12 o'clock.
"Congratulations are coming in, old
man," said DeMille, as Monty looked
fearfully at the little envelope the boy
had given him.
"Many happy returns of the day," sug
gested Bragdon. "By Jove, it's sensible
of you to get married on your birthday,
Monty. It saves time and expense to your
friends."
"Read it aloud," said "Subway" Smith.
"Two to one it's from Nopper Harrison,"
cried Pettlnglll.
Brewster's fingers trembled, he knew
not why, as he opened the envelope,
rhere was the most desolate feeling' in
his heart, the most ghastly premonition
that Ill-news had come in this last hour.
He drew forth the telegram and slowly
painfully unfolded It. No one could have
lold by his expression that he felt almost
that he was reading his death warrant It
was from Grant & Ripley and evidently
had been following him about town for
two or three hours. The lawyers had filed
it at 8:30 o'clock. _~
He read it at a glance, his eyes burn
ing, his heart freezing. To the end of
nis days these words lived sharp and dis
tinct in his brain:
"Come to the office immediately. ' Will
wait all night for you if necessary. Jones
ias disappeared and there Is absolutely no
trace of him. GRANT & RIPLEY."
Brewster sat as one paralyzed, absolute
ly no sign of emotion In his -face. The
Dthers began to clamor for the contents
}f the telegram, but his tongue was stiff
ind motionless, his ears deaf. Every
Jrop of blood In his body was stilled by
the shock, eveVy sense given him by the
Creator was centered upon eleven words
In the handwriting of a careless telegraph
operatorâ "Jones has disappeared and
there Is absolutely no trace of him."
"JONES HAS DISAPPEARED!" Those
were the words, plain and terrible in their
;learness, tremendous in their brutality.
Slowly the rest of the message began to
urge its claims upon his brain. "Come to
jur office immediately" and "Will wait all
night" battled for recognition. He was
;alm because he had not the power to
express an emotion. How he maintained
control of himseli afterward he never
knew. Some powerful, kindly force as
serted itself, coming to his relief with the
timeliness of a genii. Gradually it began
to dawn upon him that the others were
waiting for him to read the message
aloud. He was not sure that a sound
would come forth when he opened his lips
to speak, but the tones were steady, nat
ural and as cold as steel.
"I am sorry I can't tell you about this,"
he eaid, so gravely that his hearers were
silenced. "It Is a business matter of such
vital importance that I must ask you to
excuse me for an hour or so. I will ex
plain everything to-morrow. Please don't
be uneasy. If you will do me the honor

Heart!" Was Mrs. Gray's
Only Appeal.
to grace the board or an absent host I'll
be most grateful. It is imperative that I
go, and at once. I promise to return in
an hour." He was standing/ his knees as
stiff as iron. 'W\-i'
"Is it anything serious?" asked De-
Mille.
"What!" has ! anything happened?"
came In halting, frightened ton^s from
Peggy.
"It concerns me alone, and it Is pure
ly of a business nature. Seriously, I
can't delay going for another minute.
It is vital. In an hour I'll return.
Peggy, don't be worriedâ don't be dis
tressed about, me. Go on and have a
good time, everybody, and you'll find me
the Jolliest fellow of all when I' come
back. It's twelve o'clock. I'll be here
by one on the 23d of September/'
"Let me go with you," pleaded Peggy,
tremulously, as she followed him into the
hallway.
"I must go alone," he answered. "Don't
worry, little woman, it will be all right"
His kiss sent a chill to the very bot
tom of Peggy's heart
CHAPTER XXXIII
"Close the door, please," came in steady
tones from Ripley. Mr. Grant droppe
into a chair and Brewster mechanicall:
slammed the door.
"Is it true?" he demanded hoarsely, hi
hand â¢till on the knob. â¢ '..-..Â¦.
"Sit down, Brewster, and control your
Â¦elf.", said Ripley.
= "Good . God, man, can't you see I an
calm?" cried Monty. "Go onâtell me al
about it What do you know? _Wha
have you heard?"
"He cannot be found, that's all." an
oounced Ripley, with deadly lntentness
"I don't know what It means. There ii
no explanation. The whole thing is in
conceivable. Sit down and I will tell yoi
everything as quickly as possible." P
"There isn't much to tell," said Grat
mechanically.
"I can take it better standing," declared
Brewster, shutting his Jaws tightly.
"Jones was last seen in Butte on th*
Sd of this month,",said Ripley. "We sen
several telegrams to him after that day
asking when ha expected to leave fo;
New York. They never were claimed ahc
the telegraph company reported that hi
could not be found. We thought he migh
have gone off to. look after some of hi;
property and were not uneasy. Finallj
we began to wonder w,hy he had not wlrec
us on leaving for the East. I telegrapher
again and got no answer. It dawnec
upon us that this was something unus
ual. Vfe wired his secretary and recelvec
i response from the Chief of Police. HÂ«
asked, in turn, if we_could tell him any
thing about the whereabouts of Jones
rhis naturally alarmed us and yesterday
we kept the wires hot The result of oui
Inquiries is terrible, Mr. Brewster." â¢::
"Why didn't you tell me?" asked Brews
ter. .-' , /
"There can be no doubt tnat Jones has
led/accompanied by his secretary. ThÂ«
aellef in Butte is that the secretary has
murdered him."
"God!" was the only sound that cam<
from thÂ« lips of Brewster.
Kipley moistened his lips and went on.
"We have dispatches here from the po
lice, the banks, the trust companies and
from a half dozen mine managers. You
may read them if -you like, but I can
tell you what they say. About the first
of this month Jones began to turn va
rious securities Into money. It Is now
known that they were once the property
of James T. Sedgwick. held in trust for
you. - The safety deposit vaults were aft
erward visited and Inspection shows that
he - removed every scrap of stock,' every
bond, everything: of value that he could
lay his hands upon. His own papers and
Â¦ effects were not disturbed. Yours alone
have disappeared. It is this fact that
convinces . the authorities that the secre
tary has~ made away with the old man
and has fled with the property. The bank
peorle say, that Jones drew out every
dcllr.r of thai Sedgwick money, and th*
police Bay V that he realized tremendous
sums on thÂ« convertible securities. The
tirt.r.ge part 'Of It Is that he soM your
mines and your real estate, the purchaser
btlng a man! named Golden. Brewstcr,
itâ it looks very much as if he had dis
appesred with everything."
Brewster did not take his eyes from
Ripley's face throughout the terrible
speech; he did not move a fraction of
an inch from the rigid position assumed
at the beginning. .
"Is anything being done?" he asked me
chanically.
"The police are Investigating. He is
known to have started off Into the moun
tains with his secretary on the third of
September. Neither has been seen since
that day, so far as any one knows. The
earth seems to have swallowed them.
The authorities are searching the moun
tains and are making every effort to find
Jones or his body. He Is known to be
eccentric and at first not much Impor
tance was attached to his actions. That
is all we can tell you at present There
may be developments to-morrow. : It
looks badâ terribly bad. Weâ we had the
utmost confidence in Jones. My God, I
wish I could help you, my boy."
"I don't blame you, gentlemen," said
Brewster bravely. "It's Just my luck,
that's all. Something told me all along
thatâ that .it wouldn't turn out right. I
wasn't looking for this kind of end,
though. My only fear was thatâ Jones
wouldn't consider me worthy to receive
the fortune. It never occurred to me that
he might prove to be theâ the unworthy
one."
"I will take you a little farther into
our confidence/ Brewster," said Grant,
slowly. "Mr. Jones notified us in the be
ginning that he would be governed large
ly in his decision by our opinion of your
conduct. That Is why we felt no hesi
tation in advising you to continue as you
were going.
"The strangest circumstance of all, Mr.
Brewster, is that no such person as Gold
en, the purchaser, of your properties, can
be found. He is supposed to reside in
Omaha, and it is known that he paid
nearly three million dollars for the prop
erty that now stands In his name. lie
paid It to Mr. Jones in cash, too, and he
paid every cent that the property Is
worth."
"But he must be in existence some
where," cried Brewster, In perplexity.
"How the devil could he pay the money
If he doesn't exist?"
~"I only know that no trace of the man
can be found. They know nothing of him
in Omaha." said Grant, hopelessly.
"So it has finally happenerd." sail
Brewster, but his excitement had drop
ped. "Well," he added, throwing him
self into a deep chair, "it was always
much too stranee to be true.- Even .at
the beginning it seemed like a dream,
and nowâ well, now I am Just awake, like
the little boy after the fairy tale. I 'seem
like a fool to have taken it so seriously."
"There was no other way," protested
RIpley, "you were quite right."
"Well, after all." continued Brewster,
and the voice was as of one in a dream,
"perhaps it's as well to have been in
wonderland even if you have to come
Sown afterward to the ordinary world.
I am fooll.sh perhaps, but even now I
would not give it up." Then the thought
of Peggy clutched him by the throat, and
he stopped. After a moment he gathered
himself together and rose. "Gentlemen," he :
said sharply and his voice had changed: ."I
have had my fun and this is the end of it.
Down underneath I am desperately thed
of the whole thing, and I give you my
word that you will find me a different
man to-morrow. I am going to buckli
down to the real thing. I am golns to
prove thnt my grandfather's blood is J.u'
me. And I shall come out on top."
RIpley was obviously moved as he re
plied, "I don't question it for a moment.-
You are made of the right stuff. I saw
that long ago.- You may count on us to
morrow for any amount you need."
Grant indorsed the opinion. "I like your
spirit. Brewster," he said. "There are
not many men who would have taken this
as well. It's pretty hard on you, too, #ind
it's a miserable wedding gift for your
bride." . .
"We may have Important news â¢ from
Butte In the morning," said RIpley, hope
fully; "at any rate, more of the details.
The newspapers will - have . sensational
stories, no doubt, and we have asked for
the latest particulars direct from the au
thorities. We'll see that things axe prop
erly Investigated. Go home now, my boy,
and go to bed. You will begin to-morrow
with good luck at your side and you may
be '- happy all >our life In spite of to-
night's depression."
"I'm sure to be happy," said Brewster,
simply. "The ceremony takes place at 7
o'clock, gentlemen. I was coming to your
office at 9 on a little matter of business,
but I fancy It won't after all be necessary
for me to hurry. I'11-drop in before noon?
however, and get that money. By the
way, here are the receipts for the money
I spent to-night. Will you put them
away with the others? I Intend to live up
to my part of the contract, and It will
â¢ Bave me the trouble of presenting them
regularly In the morning. Good night,
gentlemen. I am sorry you were obliged
to stay up so late on my account" .
He left them bravely enough, but he
had more than one moment of weakness
before he could meet his friends. TKe
world seemed unreal and himself the
most unreal thing in it. But the night
air acted as a stimulant and helped him
to call back his courage. When he en
tered the studio at 1. o'clock he was pre
pared to redeem his promise to be "the
jolliest fellow of them ail."
CHAPTER XXXIV.
"I'll tell you about it later, dear," was
all that Peggy, pleading, could draw from
him.
At midnight Mrs. Dan had remonstrated
with her. "You must go home, Peggy
dear," she said. "It Is disgraceful for you
to stay up so late. I went to bed at 8
o'clock the night before I was married."
"And fell asleep at four In the morn
ing," smiled Peggy.
"You are quite mistaken, my dear. I
did not fall asleep at all. But I won't
allow you to stop a minute longer. It
puts rings under the eyes and sometimes
they're red the morning after."
"Oh, you dear sweet philosopher," cried
Peggy; "how wise you are. Do you think
I need a beauty sleep?"
"I don't want you to be a sleepy beauty,
that's all," retorted Mrs. Dan.
"Good Fellow, This Harrison; Says
You Grub-Staked Him."
Upon Monty's return from his trying
hour with the lawyers, he had been be
sieged with questions, but ho was cleverly
svaslve. Peggy alone was insistent; she
had curbed her curiosity until they were
on the way home, and then she Implored
him to tell her what had happened. The
misery he had endured was as nothing
to this reckoning with the woman who
had the right to expect fair treatment.
His duty was clear, but tne strain had
been heavy and it was not easy to meet
It
"Peggy, something terrible has happen
ed," he faltered, uncertain of his course.
"Tell me everything, Monty, you can
trust me to be brave."
"When I asked you to marry me," he
continued gravely, "It was with the
thought that I could give you everything
to-morrow. I looked for a fortune. I
never meant that you should marry a
pauper."
"I don't understand. You tried to test
my love for you?"
"No, child, not that But I was pledged
not to speak of the money I expected,
md I wanted ypu so much before It
;ame."
"And It has failed you?" she answered.
"I can't see that it changes things. I ex
pected to marry a pauper, as you call it
Do you think this could make a differ
ence?"
"But you don't understand, Peggy. I
haven't a penny in the world.'.' .
"You hadn't a penny when I accepted
pou," she replied. "I am not afraid. I
Delieve in you. And if youjove me I shall
lot give you up."
"Dearest!" and the carriage was at the
ioor before another word was uttered.
But Monty called to the coachman to
Jrive Just once around the block.
"Good night, my darling," he said when
they reached home. ."Sleep- till - eight
j'clock if you like. There is nothing now
n the way of having the wedding at nine,
nstead of at seven. In fact, I -have a
reason for wanting my whole fortune 4o
:ome to me then. You will be all that 1
nave in the world, child, but I am the
happiest man alive."
In his room the strain was relaxed and
Brewster faced the bitter reality. Wlth
3ut. undressing he threw himself upon
the lounge and wondered what the world
Held for him. It held Peggy at least, he
.bought, and she was enough. But had he
been fair to her? . Was he right in ex
lctlng a sacrifice? His tired brain whirl
ed in the effort to decide. Only one thing
ivas clear â that he . could not give her
jp. The future grew black at the very
thought of it. With her he could make
.hlngs go. but alone it was another mat
ter. He would take the plunge and he
would Justify it. â¢
Looking toward the window he saw the
alack, uneasy night give way to the com
ng day. Haggard and faint he arose
from the couch to watch the approach
)f the sun that is Indifferent to wealth
ind poverty, to gayety and dejection.
From far off in the gray light there came
the sound of a five o'clock bell. A little
ater the shrieks of factory whistles were
icrne to his ears, muffled by distance, but
pregnant with the importance -of a new
Jay of toil. They were calling him, with
ill poor men, to the sweat-shop and the
targe, to the great mill of life. The new
;ra had begun,. dawning bright and clear
to disperse the gloom in his soul.
Leaning against the casement and
wondering where he could earn the first
lollar for the Peggy Brewster ' that was
Peggy Gray, he rose to meet it with a
Ine unflinching fearlessness. , â¢-;..;
Before 7 o'clock he was downstairs and
waiting. Joe Bragdon Joined him a bit
ater. followed by Gardner and the mln-
later. TheDeMllles appeared without aa
Invitation, but they were not denied- Mrs.
Dan sasely shook her head when tow
that Peggy was still asleep and that the
ceremony was off till 9 o'clock.
"Monty, are you going away?" asked
Dan, drawing him into a corner.
"Just a week in the hills." answered
Monty, BUddenly remembering the gener
osity of his attorneys.
"Come In and see me as -soon as you
return, old man," said DeMille, and Monty
knew that a position would be open to
him.
To Mrs. Dan fell the honor of helping
Peggy dress. By the time she had had
coffee and was ready to go down she
was pink with excitement and had quite
forgotten the anxiety which had made
the night an age.
She had never been prettier than on
her wedding morning. Her color was
rich, her eyes as clear as stars, her
woman's body the picture of grace and
health. Monty's heart leaped high with
love of her.
"The prettiest girl In New York by
Jove," gasped Dan DeMille, clutching
Bragdon by the arm.
"And look at Monty! He's become a
new man in the last five minutes," added
Joe. -Look at the glow In his' cheeks!
By the eternal, he's beginning to look as
he did a year ago." '.;'â¢'
A clock chimed the hour of I.
"The man who was here yesterday is
In the hall to see Mr. Brewster," said the
maid, a few minutes after the minister
had uttered the words that gave Peggy a
new name. There was a moment of si
lence, almost of dread.
"You mean the fellow with the beardr*
asked Monty, uneasily.
"Yes. sir. He sent In this letter, beg
ging you to read It at once."
"Shall I send him away, Monty?" de
manded Bragdon, defiantly. ""What does
he mean by coming: at this time?"
"I'll read the letter first, Joe."
Every eye was on JBrewster as
he tore open the envelope. r Hls
face was expressive. There was
wonder In it. then incredulity, then
Joy. He threw the letter to Bragdon.
clasped Peggy In his arms spasmodically,
and then, releasing her, dashed for the
hall like one bereft of reason.
"It's Nopper Harrison!" he cried, and
a moment later the tall visitor was
dragged into the circle.
Bragdon' 3 hands trembled and his volca
was not sure as he translated the scrawl,
"Nopper" Harrison standing behind Mm
for the gleeful purpose of prompting him
when the writing was beyond the range
of human Intelligence.
"Holland House. Sept. 23. 19 â
"Mr. Montgomery Brewster, My Dear
Boy: So you thought I had given you
the slip, eh? Didn't think I'd show up
here and do my part? Well, I don't blame
you; I supposed I've acted like a damned
Idiot, but so long aa It turns out O. K.
there's no harm done.' The wolf won't
gnaw very much of a hole In your door,
I reckon. This letter Introduces my sec
retary, Mr. Oliver Harrison. He came to
me last June, out In Butte. with the pros
pectus of a claim he had staked out up
in the mountains. What he wanted was
backing and he had such a good show
to win out that I went Into cahoots with
him. He's got a mine up there that is
dead sure to yield millions. Seems as
though he has to give you half of the
yield, though. Says you grub-staked him.
Good fellow, this Harrison. Needed a
secretary and man of affairs, so took him
Into my office. You can see that he did
not take me up Into the mountains to
murder me, as the papers say this morn-
Ing. Damned rot. Nobody's business but
my own If I concluded to come east with
out telling everybody In Butte about it.
"I am here and so is the money. Got
in last night. Harrison came from Chi
cago a day ahead of me. I went to office
of G. & R, at eight this morning. | Found
them In a hell of a stew. Thought I'd
skipped out or been murdered. Money all
gone, everything gone to smash. That's
what they thought. Don't blame 'em
much. You see it was this way: I con
cluded to follow out the terms of the will
and deliver the goods in person. I
got together all of Jim Sedgwlck's
stuff and did a lot or other fool
things, I suppose, and hiked
off to New York. You'll find about seven
million dollars' worth of stuff to your
credit when you Indorse the certified
checks down at Grant & Rlpley's. my
boy. It's all here and in the banks.
"It's a mighty decent sort of a wedding
gift. I reckon.
"The lawyers told me all about you.
Told me all about last night, and that
you were going to be married this morn
ing. By this time you're comparatively
happy with the bride, I guess. I looked
over your report and took a few peeps at
the receipts. They're all right. I'm sat
isfied'. The money is yours. Then I got
to thinking that maybe you wouldn't care
to come down at nine o'clock, especially
as you are Just recovering from the Joy of
being married, so I settled with the law
yers and they'll settle with you. If you
have nothing in particular to do this aft
ernoon about two o'clock, I'd suggest that
you come to the hotel and .we'll dispose
of a few formalities that the law requires
of us. And you can give me some les
sons in spending money. I've got a little
I'd like to miss some morning. As for
your ability as a business man, I have
this to say: Any man who can spend a
million a year and have nothing to show
for it don't need a Recommendation from
anybody. He's In ij. class by himself and
it's a business that no one else can give
him a pointer about.- The' best test of
your real capacity, my boy, is the way
you listed your property for taxation. It's
a true sign of business sagacity. That
would have decided me in your favor If
everything else had been against you.
"I'm sorry you've been worried about
all this. You have gone through a good
deal In a year and you have been roasted
from Hades to breakfast by everybody.
Now it's your turn to laugh. It will sur
prise them to read the 'extras' to-day.
I've done my duty to you In more ways
than one. I've got myself Interviewed by
the newspapers and to-day they'll print
the whole truth about Montgomery Brew
ster and his millions. They've got the
Sedgwick Â¦ will and my story and the old
town will, boll with excitement. I guess
you'll be squared before the world, all
right. You'd better stay Indoors for
awhile, though. If you want to have a
quiet honeymoon.

And when he realized his state he with Joy and gladness cried.
In a voice pitched high and squeaky he began to tell his tale,
Which was by, far the strangest ever told In that green -vale.
"One hundred thousand years ago/' the stranger meekly said,
"I was laid away beneath the sod and given up for dead.
'Tis quite hard, I must confess, to revive the memories old,
But Z recall that Z once was a Plum, both young and bold.
The springtime of my life gave way to the winter cold and bleak.
And the ever-working hand of Time made mÂ« old and weak.
At last, as Z remember," and he touched his wrinkled brow,
"I became so very ancient that I looked as I do now.
One br one my faithful comrades turned to dust and stone.
Until, at last, the world left me quite helpless and alone.
Who placed me 'neath the brilliant green I never lived to know. '
But Z suspect the spirits of my. comrades laid me low."
"Your story, friend, gives interest great," the monarch said, in time,
"But I am still much vexed about your days of auld lang syne.
Pray answer this: Zf you were called in youth a Plum so bold,
What are you now, when Time has made you weak and queer and old?"
"As I recall," the stranger saidâ and the thought came none too soon-*
"Sly comrades were disposed to call me Honorable Grandpa Jt*runs. .
Just why they gave me such a name I'xa at a loss to say, \
Sut probably knew quite well in that patriarchal' day."
"Zf Prune they called you, friend of mine," the sovereign lightly quoth,
"To change the name on this glad day Z should be very loth.
And so, my subjects, one and all, it is my wish that you
Henceforth shall call him Grandpa Pruneâ my subject loyal and true.
Now, 'twere meet Z keep my word and award to you a prize
For clearing up this mystery that opened wide my eyes.
You are too old to earn your way, but still you can't be missed;
So Z shall start a pension fund and let you head the list."
"Since you, 0 King, so good have been," old Grandpa finally said, â¢
"I shall tell you a secret great which I kept while I. was dead:
In the misty, far-off times our customs were quite strange,
And every being wore some garb, with now and then a change.
'Neath a rock in yonder wood lies a chest in strength complete.
Wherein are richest treasures and garments fine and neat;
There is clothing of all sizes, designs and patterns gayâ
And if you the custom will revive 111 lead you there straightway."
"lead on, brave Prune!" the sovereign said, and waved aloft his hand,
And very soon a start was made for the secret treasure land.
While trudging through the woodland dense the King with ease did
capture j
A Potato and a Mushroom, thus adding to his rapture.
The King sought for enlightenment until he was much riled,
But Potato's only, word was "faith," and Mushroom only smiled.
The captives, though, were quite content to Join the happy throng,
And gladly took allegiance with vows both firm and strong
At last the treasure spot was reached, and the subjects ceased their )>.
While the strongest rolled away the rock and lifted up the chest.
Oh, my sweets, if you had seen the contents of that box,
You would be going everywhere and turning over rocks!
There were clothes of every color, every size and every cut,
'And the subjects donned them quickly, and began to prance and strut.
Of course, the fits were not the best in every case, you know,
But the wearers all were satisfied and let the misfits go.
A box of big and black cheroots caused the crowd to wonderâ
And when old Watermelon smoked he coughed -like startled thunder.
The King, in robes of stately make, ran to his chosen spot, .
. The subjects following close behind in proud and haughty trot. \
! It .was not long, my precious ones, until the useful creatures
Had built their King a palace grand with many dazzling features $
Next time, my loves, 111 try to tell of something that I think
.Will interest you very much and drive away the blink.

the Yildiz ICiosfc, massacred the entire Bulgarian Christian population of the Okhrida and Leren districts. Awful descriptions are given 'of the sights seen there. The soldiers,
slaughtering men, women and children in every direction, displayed a barbarism never before witnessed. The number of kilted is not stated in the courier's dispatch, but according to
reports from other sources the total number of the victims will reach 6000.

LONDON, Sept. 12.â Fashionable wo
men's clubs in the .West End are very
much exercised Just now over a subject
one of the newspapers has labeled "The
Deadly Liqueur." It started from a
statement in the London World that the
habit among women of Indulging In what
are commonly called "cordials" is grow
ing at a rapid rate. Idleness is alleged by
the World to be the predisposing cause of
the growing Indulgence by young mar

classes, In alcoholic drinks.

The officers are using every means to
apprehend the other members of the
gang. In the meantime the prisoner Is
kept in solitary confinement in a building
separate from the main county Jail.
The keeper of the house, James Daugh
erty, was arrested, but two of his con
federates, who had been living In the
house, made their escape. Thursday
evening Daugberty was put through a
long secret "sweating" and finally con
fessed the whole affair. He claimed that
he simply acted as "fence" for the gang
and that among Its members were thir
teen railroad men, Including two freight
conductors. He stated that the opera
tions of the gang had extended over a
number of months and that they had
three or four different places where the
stolen goods were secreted until disposed
of.
Accompanied by officers from San Fran
cisco, Sheriff Neabitt raided a resort on
the Castroville road, about a mile from
this city. Within the. building the of
ficers discovered a quantity of furniture
and beneath the flooring a large amount
of goods, including a quantity of hides,
was found. All of the goods had been
stolen from the freight trains passing
through here. Â¦
For the past year it has been known
that aji organized gang was making a
business of pilfering from the various
freight trains. It was not until Thursday
afternoon that the , officers were able to
obtain evidence sufficient to warrant the
taking of definite action.
SALINAS, Sept. 12.-Sheriff W. J. Nea
bitt of this county, assisted by Southern
Pacific detectives from San Francisco,
has succeeded in unearthing a widespread
plot among railroad employes for the
stealing of goods in transit from railroad
cars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The spot where, the crime was commit
ted Is within a ehort distance of farm
houses and the shots were plainly heard
by the residents.
Sheriff Jones sent out deputies to-night
and a diligent search for the desperado
Is going on. Should he be caught it la
feared that summary vengeance would be
wrought, for numerous threats of mob
law have been made.
The CoronerV Inquest was held . over
the body here to-day, but no new facts
were brought out and 'a verdict was ren
dered In accordance with the facts cited.
Although Kuhnle's pockets were rifled
and his satchel containing $C3 was taken,
there are few who believe that robbery
was the direct motive, though he had no
known enemies.
Kuhnle was about SS years of age and
a native of Germany. He leaves a wife
and three children. He was a prominent
farmer of that district and was in pros
perous circumstances. He had been a
resident of that neighborhood for about
twelve years. He was universally liked
end respected and the officers are at a
loss to ascribe a motive for the crime.
Kuhnle's body was found about twenty
feet from where the buggy was stopped
end about thirty feet from where Kuhnle
was shot, the body having been dragged
that distance into the brush by the mur
derer. It Is thought that the murderer
fired two shots into the body of his vic
tim after he had fallen to the ground,
as three shots were heard by those living
In the vicinity of the crime. The other
two shots took effect In his head and
lungs.
BODY WAS DEAOGED.
Wbea he was on the ground his aesail
t:.t told iiia to walk back a short dis
tance, but Kuhnle retreated In the oppo
tite direction. The asassin fired and the
contents of one barrel of a shotgun took
effect in Kuhnle'e head, literally blowing
it to pieces. This morning portions of
Cesn and brains were found scattered
over en area of twenty feet 6quare.
The firing of the shot alarmed Mrs.
Kuhnle and she whipped up the horse and
drove rapidly home, where she gave the
alarm. A ranchhand at once notified the
neighbors. The news was quickly taken
to Paso Robles and the officers were soon
In pursuit of the assassin. Late to-night
no trace of him had been discovered.

SA2* LUIS OBISPO. Sept. 12.â Charles
P. Kuhr.le, a wealthy and highly re

Robles, was brutally murdered last night.
Kuhnlo and his wife were returning
from an entertainment of a fraternal so
ciety of which he was a member, and at
about 12 o'clock, when be reached a point
within three miles of bis borne, a man
stepped cut cf the brush by the side of
the read and commanded ICuhnle to get
out of the bugg-y. â¢ which he did. As be

loud outcry, thinking to attract iho at

plosion. â¢ '
Yerkes and the unknown sailor went to
the barrel and one of them struck a
match. An explosion followed and both
men were enveloped In the flaming liquor.
They perished before a hand could be
raised to save them. The ship at once
caught flre and the blaze for a while was
stubborn, but was finally extinguished. In
the excitement the sailors concerned in
the affair escaped the parties sent out to
arrest them. -
The explosion, according: to reports from
eye-witnesses, followed the theft of a bar
rel of grain alcohol, containing flfty-Bix
gallons, by a party of sailors. This bar
rel, It is said, was taken from one of the
storehouses of the navy yard and re
moved to the dock near the Olympia.
There it was opened. Shipkeeper Daly on
board the Olympia detected the odor of
the spirits and summoned the ship's mas
ter-at-arms. A search led to the discov
ery of the barrel, which was taken aboard
the Olympia and, placed on the hurricane
deck. With the exception of a small
quantity, which had been 'consumed, it
was Intact.
The damage by flre was confined to the
deck of the vessel and embraced: Q'hij'p'the
canvas awnings and their "fixtures. The
decks, however, Â¦ were .-slightly.. Injured. Â»? Â»--
Immediately aiter the* explosion 'Â¦'- fire

The San Francisco CallSAN JOSE, Sept 12.â J. K. Castro and
Miss Margaret Munroe, two well known
young people of San Francisco, were
married at St. Joseph's Church here to
day. The Rev. Father Gleeson performed
the ceremony in the presence of a num
ber of friends and relatives. Miss Helen
Munroe, a sister, was bridesmaid, and
Arthur Castro, a brother, attended the
groom. A wedding breakfast was enjoyed
at the Lamolle, after which the couple
left for a wedding tour to Los Angeles.
Mr. Castro is a well-known member of
the Castro family of Mountain View, but
for a number of years has resided in San
Francisco. The bride is the daughter of
Mrs. Margaret Munroe of San Francisco.
Mr. and Mrs. Castro will make their home
in San Francisco.

MOSCOW,- Sept. 12.â Two high officials
of the Russian secret police have been
exiled to Archangel and Siberia, respec
tively. It is said they were ordered here
to organize a secret society, to hold se
cret meetings of workmen in different
towns of the empire, with a view to se
curing the arrest of the ringleaders ! of
such movements. Unfortunately for the
officials several of the meetings which
they arranged resulted in serious disturb
ances, hence the banishment of the two
secret police officials. The Incident has
caused a sensation in administrative cir
cles.

A cla"sh is likely at any time. Some of
the Indians who were opposed to the rat
ification of th,e treaty are threatening to
run the surveyors off the reservation. It
may become necessary to send out an
armed guard with every surveying party,
as trouble is likely in a number of quar
ters. One reason for the strained condi
tion is the recent death of Chief John,
who had the tribe under excellent con
trol. . His demise has left the more, rad
ical element is in the ascendency. The In
dians are especially bitter against the
"sooners," and some of these may be
killed before the opening unless they get
off the reservation. Two troops of col
ored cavalry are on the way to Fort Du
chesne as reinforcements and their pres
ence is expected to asist in preserving or
der. They were ordered there by General
Frank D. Baldwin, commander of the De
partment of Colorado.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Sept 12.â Serious
trouble^ is threatened on the Uintah In
dian reservation in the eastern part of
the State, and a detachment of troops
has been ordered from Fort Duchesne to
quell â¢ the threatened outbreak. The
trouble Is due principally to the presence
of "sooners," who are awaiting the open
ing of the greater part of the reservation.
Although the Indian police and troop
ers from Fort Duchesne have been pa
trolling the country thoroughly, they
have not been able to keep off the "soon
ers," who have had frequent clashes
with the Indians. The red men are an
gered over the prospect of losing the rich
lands of the reservation, although the
matter has been settled for some time.
The more radical ones* among them are
counseling resistance. The sight of sur
veyors laying off the lands has incensed
them, and now comes the time when the
schools open, which often causes trouble.
A number of the Indians have defied the
authorities, declining to send their chil
dren to' school. A detachment of cav
alry has been sent out with instructions
to bring back the children and to arrest
the parents if, any resistance be shown.

Turkish circles are exercised at the ac
tion of the Greek Premier In protesting
to the powers against the atrocities per
petrated by the Turks upon the Greeks,
but confidence is expressed that there will
be no change in the attitude of the
Athens Government, on the ground that
Greece Is too much opposed to the expan
sion of Bulgaria to do anything which
might cause intervention and consequent
alteration of the status in Macedonia.
The dispatch of French warships to
nearer proximity to Turkey is accepted
here as an indication of the purpose of
France to be prepared to protect French
interests, not only during the present dis
turbance, but in the event of war. Â¦
The suggested elevation of the Amer
ican Minister In Constantinople to the
rank of Embassador Is believed in official
circles here to be an excellent proposal,
on the ground that in the eyes of the
Mussulmans the United States occupies
an inferior position In near Eastern af
fairs, which is due partly to the lower
rank of it3 representative at the Turkish
capital. â¢ .
Strong pressure is being exerted on the
British Foreign Office to cause it to take
more energetic action to stop the atro
cities on the part of the Turks. But the
policy of the Cabinet continues to be con
fined to preserving the concert of Europe.
On all sides It is said that the further ef
forts of every power will be to prevent a
general European conflagration. In the
event of an outbreak of war between
Turkey and Bulgaria being utterly un
avoidable, the policy of the powers will
be to avoid complications which may em
broil them.
LONDON, Sept 12.-From Informa
tion gleaned in various diplomatic
circles in London to-day It is
learned that the powers have come to
recognize the fact that only drastic meas
ures will maintain peace between Turkey
and Bulgaria. No one participating . In
the negotiations now denies that the two
countries are perilously close to war. It
is even suggested in a responsible quarter
that the Slavs are working with the Bul
garians to convince the world that a
frightful state- of affairs prevails In Mace
donia and that humanity demands the
intervention of the powers.

LONDON. Sept 12.â A dispatch to a
news agency from Liverpool quotes Dr.
Robert J. Howard, the- son-in-law of Lord
Strathcona, the Canadian High Commis
sioner, who arrived there on the Cunard
Line eleamer Locania to-day, as saying:
"Every means is being taken to stiffen
the backs of the British representatives
In the Alaskan boundary matter to resist
the American demands."
He added: "The Canadians will be very
much incensed if the British commission
ers showed a disposition to give away
Canada's rights."
Dr. Howard's remarks were prompted
by statements published here from a Can
adian source, intimating that Canada
might be sacrificed by Great Britain for
the sake of the latter's friendship for the
United States. No one of the American
commissioners would consent to be quot
ed on the subject The British officials
openly cay that such criticisms certainly
will not predispose Lord Chief Justice Al

papers to-day doubted "whether American
opinion would allow the American Gov

is against Canada, it is possible that it
may spell eeparation from the mother

LIVERPOOL, Sept 12.â A rumor is now
current that the White Star Line will
soon cease to be a part of the Interna
tional Mercantile Marine Company and
will become a purely British individual
firm under the ownership of the Ismay
family. It is said that the report pub
lished by the London Times this morning
In a dispatch from Liverpool that the
White Star, Dominion and American
â¢teamship lines will shortly cease to exist
as distinct organizations, â¢ the Dominion
and American lines being taken over by
the White Star, applies only to a merger
of the passenger departments, though a
merger of the freight departments may
follow.
The officials of all lines Interested re
fuse to give out any information, and
confirmation of the defection of the
White Star Line Is completely lacking. It
seems possible, however, that some pas
senger merger arrangement will shortly
be announced.
LONDON. Sept 12.-The St James Ga
zette says that while the Morgans' cfllce
here characterize the merger as pure fic
tion, the St. James Gazette has reason
to believe that changes have been decided
upon, though perhaps not so sweeping as
indicated by the London Times. These
will take the form of further develop
ment at London, and Liverpool along the
lines by which all the West End passen
ger business of the Dominion, American,
Leyland and Transport lines will ue
transacted at cne ofilce. The several
staffs and offices at Liverpool may be
amalgamated. The paper quotes an In
ternational Mercantile Marine official as
Baying that changes were inevitable, and
"that rough corners in the administration
required knocking off."
Another Liverpool dispatch reports that
the White Star line v-'I Immediately take

FRESNO, Sept. 12.â Negotiations are
pending between the Building Trades
Council and the Builders' Exchange
looking toward the appointment of a per
manent committee of arbitration for the
adjustment of all differences arising be
tween the workers in the building trades
and their employers. A prominent clause
of the agreement between the two bodies
is that there shall be no strikes. The
walking delegates of the trades union,
instead of ordering his men oft of a Job
when he finds affairs running in a way
that does not suit him, will report the
grievance to the arbitration committee,
and the men will continue at work while
this committee adjusts the trouble.
Another clause of the agreement is that
all the unions in the building trades shall
establish a wage scale to be in force until
a stated time. This has already been put
into effect, the unions having pledged
themselves to demand no raises in wages
until May 1, 1904. The appointment of this
committee and the agreement as to wage
rates promise to stimulate the building
progress in this city to a great degree.
Labor troubles and the uncertainty of'
completing Jobs on the contract price
have made many property owners chary
about building. Now, however, the sta
bility of conditions will prompt the com
mencement of a large amount of new
work.

The Government appears to be'firmly resolved to, avoid giv

of insurgents "and Turkish troops at Suipir.dol, in which not a

Telegrams from Burgas say : the Bulgarian population is fast
disappearing from vthe district of . Eosengrad, and that every one
unable to escape to the Bulgarian frontier is .killed. The' War
Office here is greatly concerned over the increasing number of
deserters who go to join the insurgents;
A deputation of leading professors and representatives of
the professional classes yesterday waited upon the Ministers and
urged the Government to order, immediate mobilization. Premier
Petroff replied to the delegation that the Ministry was unable to
admit the necessity for such a step at the present time.
The Turkish Government is believed to have at the present
moment no less than 60,600 soldiers in the vilayet of Adrianople,
large bodies of them within ten to fifteen kilometers of .the'Bul

Fraternal Brotherhood.
THE six lodges of San Francisco
of the " Fraternal Brotherhood
have under consideration a plan
to have Joint social functions for the pur
pose of attracting additional attention to
this California organization.
There is a movement to establish a fra
ternal home In this city for the several
local lodges. It Is proposed to build a
Fraternal Brotherhood Temple, where all
the lodges can hold their meetings and
also have a social hall, where entertain
ments and balls can be given. As a re
sult of two meetings, when the project
was explained, more than $10,000 has been
subscribed.
San Francisco Lodge had an open meet
ing September 11. at which there was a
large attendance and a good programme
of entertainment was presented.
Mission Lodge had a nightcap party the
sarne night in its meeting place in Excel
sior Hall and it proved a very delightful
social function.
Progress Lodge will have a party on
the night of September 23.
Golden Gate Hall on the evening
of the first Wednesday in September, was
a delightful function, that was attended
by a large number of ladies and gentle
men. The programme of entertainment
included the followinc numbers:
Welcome address, J. W. Millward; his
tory of Court Apollo and the order,
George J. Berger; vocal selection, Mrs.
'Richardson; song and dance, Miss Mar

HOW IT BETAINS POPULATION".
Another curiously Irish phenomenon:
This region In Connemara keeps up " Its
population, while the people are flying
rapidly from the best lands in Ireland.
For example, the population of Muck
anaghederdauhaulla has remained prac
tically the same since 1831. while that of
Navan Union, in Meath. which has a val
uation of about Â£7 per head, and Includes
some of the best land in the United King
dom, has diminished by nearly 20 per cent
in the same period. This is no isolated
accident, but a strong example of a state
of things which Is general throughout the
country, graduated according to the re
sources. ' The people multiply on misery,
and fly from wealth throughout agricul
tural Ireland from one end to the other.
Irish-speaking p'eople have long looked
on the English language as n mean? to
"emigrate, and many have teamed It main
ly for that purpose. In accurate propor
tion as the English language has spread
In the west and south, the population has
diminished ; and this is particularly no
ticeable, in the various districts of Conne
mara,' where the priests tell me tha* the
main cause of the population not falling
Is that the people have known Irish, only.
In like manner education is regarded as a
means of. escape to some other country,
and so widely established is this idea that
I have lately heard it recommended by a
member of Parliament, even in a district
where the agricultural and other re
sources were about the average. Educa
tion in Ireland is carried on largely for
the benefit of America.
Muckanaghederdauhaulla means some
thing concerning "the pig between the
two seas"â literally, "between the two
salt waters." I regret to say that the
Petition for special letters of adminis
tration on the estate of Miss Isabella D.
Clark, who committed suicide on Wednes
day, was filed yesterday by Dr. William
F. McXutt. In his petition Dr. McXutt
states that the deceased made her will on
September 9, the day preceding her death.
He mentions none cf the provisions there
in. He states that the petitioner was
appointed the sole executor thereof; that
no application has been made for letters
testamentary; that there will be delay in
granting 6uch letters testamentary; that
said estate of said deceased needs the
care and attention of some competent
person, and that it is requisite that some
such person be appointed to take charge
of the estate.
The value of the estate is said to ex
ceed $10,000.
The following- property Is listed as be
longing to It:
An undivided one-quarter Interest in
three certain pieces of real property on
Front street, between Broadway and Val
lejo; an undivided one-quarter interest in
a certain piece of real property on the
northwest corner of Broadway and Front
street; a lot of land on the southwest cor
ner of Tenth and Market streets, with
Improvements thereon; a lot of land on
the southwesterly line of Tenth street,
between Market and Mission; an undivid
ed one-auarter interest in a lot of land
at the northwest corner of Sutter and
Stockton streets, with the improvements
thereon; books and wearing apparel.
The attorney for the petitioner is Max
well McXutt.
Property of Miss Isa
bella D. Clark Is Very
Valuable.
SUPPOSED TO BE CHRISTIANS.
The people are supposed to be Chris
tians, but there is no place of worship
of any. kind. The Catholic religion pre
vails.' on the mainland and the priests
make periodical visits when the weather
is fine. Fishing and a little precarious
agriculture, among quartz crags are the
sole support of the people, who In so far
as I 'Could make, out are the descendants
of' fugitives from wars which gave all
the land worth having in. that country to
a conquering race. At least that is the
popular belief, but the real history of the
people is little known.
Nominally, at least, the place Is said to
be under British jurisdiction, though it is
hard to believe this in view of the con
dition of the natives and the glory of the
British -Hag. The coloring' of the maps
makes it British, but that Is about all one
can see to associate this region with "the
greatest empire the world has known."
Such * was Muckanaghederdauhaulia
when I left there last January, but on' my
way through the adiacent mainland I
found the | resources and \ the people even
poorer, and I went through": one district
which was at least twice as poor, judg
ing from official statistics and from my
own experience alike. Yet the mainland
is certainly in the British empire.
Where is all this? It Is in the United
Kingdom, in Ireland. In . the county of
Galway, Â¦ In the center Â¦ of Connemara,
! about halfway between Galway City and
Cllf den. There is a place called Derrynea,
where the valuation for local government
: purposes. is only 4s per head, as against
Â£7 per head in the agricultural districts
of Meath.- The - statutory qualification
i for a ; congested district is 30s per head;
and it is a strange fact that the Congested
'Districts Board has; never done anything
for the! agricultural population of Derry
nea, while they have continually poured
-money into places eight times less poor.
; I Priests . tell me Â¦ this Is d,ue to their . own
reverend representatives on the board, but
I that is a matter I'd rather leave to the
HOW THEY DBESS.
The male Rluckanaghederdauhaulian's
dress consists solely in two coarse woolen
garments, a jacket and a kind of trous
ers, spun and woven by hand. Some of
the less poor men wear also shirts, gen
erally cheap cotton, sent out from Man
chester: Some wear boots. As among
the backward races of the world, the
women's dress is less elaborate. They
very seldom wear boots, and those that
do don't seem to know how to lace them
on. The children are always barefooted,
and some of them are all but naked, even
in the severity of winter, up to ten years
of age..
The family commonly live in a single
small, rude apartment, with their domes
tic animals, mixing pigs, cows, goats,
fowls and children among straw, heath
er, and far less acceptable accumulations.
In one case I saw a single bed for a fam
ily of seven, with only a few rags to cov
er them, and* absolutely nothing to He
upon but a pile of bare heather. There
was no chimney;. the smoke was supposed
to go out through a hole In the roof, but
went out by the door instead, filling the
hut on its way. Those who live with
their beasts are the middle and upper
classes; the lower classes have no beasts
with which to live. A traveler who had
been that way before me tells me he saw
a whole family absolutely naked, but I
saw nothing quite so interesting as that.

across the water. By road, however, the
distance is more than nine miles, and
there is no other way to the school. It
has been several times proposed to build
a viaduct over the sound, but the natives
have always opposed it on the ground
that it might hinder a local industry in
Illicit spirit, which has flourished there
from time immemorial..

I returned lately from that strange re
gion, and I think I have succeeded In learn
ing to pronounce the name accurately. I
will try to translate It lower down, but
must attend to the place Itself first. Prob
ably not one in five thousand London peo
ple has ever heard of it.
It is a populous peninsula, over four
miles long, running from the Atlantic in
landâa strange arrangement for a penin
sula, but not stranger than %)ther facts
connected with Muckanaghederdauhaulla.
The sea comes in on one side by the base
of the peninsula, goes round Its point and
back nearly to the base on the other side,
leaving it connected with the mainland.
That-is how the peninsula comes to run
from the coast toward the Interior.
The inhabitants speak a language which
Is said to be very, ancient, and which is
almost unknown in civilization except
among a few professors on the Continent
and a few of their pupils in the United
Kingdom. Among all the Muckanagheder
dauhaullans, I heard of only two who
could speak any other language, and only
one who could read or write. This was a
child, the only Inhabitant that had ever
been to school. I made extensive inqui
ries about this, assisted by local guides
and by my knowledge of the native lan
guage, but could not find a trace of more
than one inhabitant having been to school.
It is a fact that there Is no school on the
peninsula, although there Is one on the

SUICIDE LEAVES
A LARGE ESTATE
ODD COMMUNITY
ON IRISH COAST
Irving at first thought of giving up his
purse, but on second thought decided to
use a little strategy, so he threw his
matchbox on the road. As the footpad
stooped to pick up what he thought was a !
purse Irving suddenly darted toward the
path leading to Stanyan street. In his
excitement he came in contact with a
barbed wire fence and sustained a severe
laceration of the left hand. He continued
on his way, however, and meeting Patrol
men Williams and Anderson notified them
of the affair. The officers immediately
returned to the scene and Instituted a
search for the criminal.
Frederick M. Sweet, the man In custody,
was found near the scene and the fact
that he could not give a satisfactory ex
planation of his movements and that a
loaded revolver was found In his posses
sion warranted the officers taking him
into custody. Sweet maintains that he is
not g-ullty and claims that he had been
visiting an acquaintance who resides on
the south side of the park and was on his
way to the cars when arrested.
Inquiry at the boarding-house conduct
ed by Mrs. Friend at 307 California street
i elicited the information that Sweet was
employed there in the capacity of a clerk
1 and has always borne fan excellent repu
tation. Owing to the excitement of the
! situation Irving could not give a clear
! description of the man with the gun, but
will be given an opportunity to-day to
I Identify the suspect.
The hold-up occurred on the bridge on
the south drive directly opposite the
Haight-street entrance to the park while
Irving was on his way to visit Superin
tendent McLaren at the Park Lodge. As
he passed the bridge a man wearing a
white mask and holding in his hand an
ominous looking revolver stepped out from
a clump of bushes and commanded Irving
to deliver his valuables.
Samuel Irving, a well known Insurance
broker residing at 1918 Sutter street, is
the latest victim of the. knight of the
mask and pistol, who has been operating
in Golden Gate Park, and It was due to
his presence of mind that the robber did
not secure anything of value.
The audacious crime took place last
evening shortly after 8 o'clock within a
stone's throw of the Park Police Station,
and a few minutes afterward Frederick
M. Sweet, a clerk employed in a hotel
.conducted by Mrs. Friend at 807 California
street, was taken Into custody.

with his flst and knocked her down and
has used obscene language, too vile to be
set down in her complaint. She wants
the custody of her baby, Charles Stein,
and $25 per month alimony.

tion. He left her on September 15, 1899.

wants the custody of her two little girls,
Olive and Esther.

JudjrÂ» Hebbard yesterday granted Ada
Seawell a divorce from Frank H. Seawell
t>n the ground of drunkenness, wife-beat
ing and general brutality. The testimony
was taken before Commissioner J. T. Ty
ler, and the hearing waa liberal. The
findings show defendant In the light of
a wlfe-bÂ«ater, and on those findings thÂ«
ties of matrimony were severed.
ThÂ« testimony was that from the data
of their wedding. March 3. 1901, thÂ© de
fendant began a fiendish career of chok
ing and beating. He throttled her, struck
her and dragged her upstairs. At Sac
ramento, where they went on visit, he
came home brutally drunk and chased
his bride about with a pistol. At Healds
burg the same experience confronted the
wife. At another time, when they lived
in a boardlngr-house- In San Francisco,
Seawell ran after the woman he had
sworn to protect, brandishing a razor,
and ehe took refuge in the room of a
woman friend, as she was afraid of be
ing killed.
Once when she waa cooking dinner he
came home drunk and struck her, almost
knocking her down. Numerous witnesses
of the different assaults gave testimony on
the subject, and the Judge at once set
her free.
Albert Clrimele wants to be divorced
from Mary Cirimele on grounds of cruelty
and desertion. He alleges that they were
married April 28, 1902, and three weeks
afterwards she commenced to abuse him
in an outrageous manner before his
friends, calling him vile names. He states
that once she brandished a knife and
threatened to kill him and told him. to
pack his things and leave the house for
ever, as she would liot occupy the status
of wife to him any more. He alleges that
in order to further humiliate him she
went to work in a cannery, although he
was able to and did provide bountifully
"for her, even going bo far as to give her
all of his wages, and she now refuses to
admit him to her house and also refuses
to come to him.

Some years ago a Government official
was sent to these parts to report, and
one of the first questions he asked was.
what Is the people's principal means of

reply. That was years ago. and now the
very poor have not even credit. I know
one family of nine that had absolutely
nothing but twenty stones of very bad po

and the Government alike, while all kinds
of v "remedial measures" aro undertaken

poor, but who know enough English to
agitate in other parts of the country
There Is a grea^ multitude of these pa
thetic wretches, and now It Is assumed
that they will be made happy by becom
ing the owners of their granite farms. It
can but make them owners of permanent
misery, more confirmed in all their squal

Special Sales
How We Conduct Them
* o AHERE is scarcely a week in the year but
A what we have a special sale in some
department.
For these occasions goods arc actually reduced
from their regular selling prices. Sometimes
this reduction is considerable â in fact we
almost sell the goods at cost. Sometimes the
goods are odds and ends and then again they
arc new goods. In the former case we wish to
sell out the goods and of course draw trade.
When new goods are reduced our main object
is to bring in customers.
If a man comes in for a shirt or necktie at a
special price he may buy a hat, some under-
wear or even a suit or overcoat.
Our reductions are always genuine. Further-
more, merchandise in good condition can
always be returned.
Sometimes you sec a statement in our adver-
tisement to the effect that the goods arc sold
at such and such prices in other stores. While
our price b considerably less than that of other
dealers, we can prove the facts of the case by
the merit of our merchandise.
This is the store where you get -value and
satisfaction wrapped up in the same package,

The application for possession of the

fact that at the time of the lease there
were on hand certain contracts which the
United States Shipbuilding Company knew
could not be completed within the year
for which the lease was to run. The
Bath Iron Works is the referee entitled to
retain exclusive possession for the pur
pose of completing said contracts, part of
which are for Government vessels.

that the property of the Hyde Windlass

"â¢Undoubtedly it would be a great relief
to the department if the tenure of office
of fcurih-class postmasters was perma
nent and stable during a period of good
b#!iavior, but this rule has never ob
ti.i'i.d under any administration, and no
attempt has been made toward establish
ing such a rule until the present adminis
; ratio! 1 .. Postmasterships of all classes
bava been universally recognized as polit
ical appointments, not civil servilce_ _ai>
nointrnent*. and no claim has heretofore
Iwen made that they were under the civ
il service law. The department in deal
\ng with Senators and members of Con
gress must treat them uniformly."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. -Postmaster
Genera! Payne to-day made the following
natrmcnt rcgardinc bis policy In the ap
â¢pointment of fourth-class postmasters
with particular reference to the recent
removal of Miss Tcdd. the postmistress
of Greenwood. Del.:
"There is no law. regulation or rule
which applies to the department or to the
Civil Swvlce Commission regarding
changes in fourt,h-class postofSces except
ing that under the administration of
President McKinley an informal rule was
adopted that a postmaster should not be
considered as liable to removal until ho
had 6erved a term of four years, unless
for Eome cause affecting the propriety or
ability of the- postmaster holding the of
â¢"When I becam* Postmaster General I
Â«^avcred to prevent the removal of
poKmasters of the fourth class, even af
ter they had served four years, unless it
was for come rood- cause. But there
never rraÂ« euch a rule formally adopted.
I am pleased to say that for* the most
part Senators and members of Congress
have acauJesced i n the wish of the de
partment.
jVThere appears to be an Impression that
after a fourth-class postmaster has been
permitted to remain beyond four years
that hÂ© should then, by custom, be per
mitted to remain another full term of
four years. No such custom has ever
obtained, and the practice of removing
these officials at the pelasure of the Post
master General has prevailed, I believe,
since the foundation of the Government
ur.tll/the modification was put Into ef
fect 'durinc the term of President Me-
Klnley. The civil sen-ice laws do not ap
l>ly in any respect to fourth-class post
masters.
"One of the rules governing the action
of postmasters is that a postmaster shall
not allow his office to be made the head-
Qiiarters of a political party, or a faction
of a political party; nor shall he be ag
gressively active in stirring up factional
quarrels, political or otherwise. Miss
Todd, who was removed from the office
at Greenwood, allowed her cflipe to be, in
<"ffpct. the headquarters of her family
and herself to tÂ»e the mo.st active in a
factional political quarrel inside the Re
publican party. This she virtually ad
mitted in her interview with me. and, ac
cording- to the rule referred to above, was
cause for her removal.

Students Punished for Dueling.

Technical High School of Stuttgart have
been sentenced to three months' . deten

will be treated in another exhibit. How
lands that were once desert were made
to blossom as the rose will be shown in

more attention. Oranges, lemons, pine

Monseigneur Merry del Val Will
"The planting of oranges on the mesas
on the east side of the San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers through a distance of
about 400 miles has increased the acreage
of this fruit in that region not less than
five-fold during the last five years. The
profitability of early ripening fruit, which
can be disposed of before the holidays,
cheap land and abundant Irrigation water
are the three attractions which have led
to this large Interest and Investment. In
Southern California also orange planting
has proceeded, and the planting of the
standard California orange, the Washing
ton navel, has been rivaled by the atten
tion given to late ripening varieties, nota
bly the Valencia late.
"A part of the increase of the orange
acreage at the south has been secured ut
the cost of the lemon by budding over
bearing lemon trees to the orange. This
has been freely done in the interior of
Southern California, the lemon acreage
now being almost wholly near the coast,
where temperature conditions best befit
it and where properly grown and cured
lemons are fairly remunerative.
"The apple acreage is increasing In all
parts of the State, but most notably in
the Pajaro Valley, including parts of two
counties, Santa Cruz and Monterey. This
compact area of deep, rich soil with its
abundant rainfall and cool summer, be
cause of nearness to the coast, produces
Bellefleur and Yellow Newtown Pippin
apples of exceptional beauty and quality.
In this region the commercial handling of
anced most notably are the two porno
jglcal kingsâ the orange and the apple. .
"Irrigation is continually winning 'wider
recognition as m. recourse for safety and
greater profit even in regions where here-
"The Raisin Growers' Association, Im
mediately upon Its organization, secured
control of about 90 per cent of the raisin
output and fixed the prices at figures
which yielded a fair profit to the grow
ers, sold the year's crop, cleared away a
considerable carry-over from the previous
year and brought a new era of prosperity
into the Fresno and Kings county district
of the Sap Joaquin Valley, enabling grow
ers to pay oft mortgages and have a good
supply of ready money besides. It has
worked five years or more, never reach
ing the. permanency and perfection of or
ganization which its most ambitious pro
moters aimed at arid yet always rescuing
the raisin interest from 'exactions and op
pressions. The association of prune grow
ers had a most difficult task in its ef
fort to sell at a profit the enormous prune
product of 1900, including the output of
rival sections and of people distrustful
of each other. It had rivals at home and
enemies at a distance. It made colossal
errors in the matter of ways and means
and from nearly all points of view It
failed utterly and will never outlive its
bad name. Out of its : failure, however,
comes a stronger disposition than ever
toward the formation of local associations
and their affiliation Into central control.
Lessons have been learned from failure
and the air is cleared after the storms.
Co-operation among California fruit grow
ers is all the stronger because of the fail
ures it has made.
"We have now In California from 75 to
100 local associations, most of them own-
Ing property in packing houses, etc., buy
ing and distributing supplies, grading and
packing fruit and drying In -many cases,
selling first-class products under their
distinctive brands, . and acting to
gether In securing advantages in
transportation and the . like. We
have associations of Bpeclal-product
people, walnut growers, almond growers,
ppune growers, etc., which are In some
cases fixing minimum price or arranging
public sales, accepting or rejecting bids
upon products in. bulk and representing
many producers. In these lines of local
co-operation steady and stalwart prog
ress is being made and general affiliations
Including these â¢ units will in time , bring
all bur growers together in mutual un
derstanding and joint action. : .
IRRIGATION INCREASING.
LESSON OF FAILURE.
TBANSP0ETATI0N PROBLEMS.
"Transportation and marketing prob
lems still occupy a large share of the
time which producers can devote to local
and State assemblies. Though it is im
possible yet to record th<Â» permanent suc
cess of any great undertaking, still tho
benefits resulting from such degrees of
success as have been attained are nota
ble. The skeptic on the feasibility of co
operative . action among agriculturists
might truly claim, for example, that the
greatest undertaking the Southern Cali
fornia Citrus Fruit Exchange had never
secured control of more than half the cit
rus fruits produced; that the Kai'sln
Growers' Association had not only failed
to secure permanent organization, but
had difficulty even in getting a one-year
contract for 90 per cent of Its product
and was, therefore, forced to abandon for
the present, at least, all of its great am
bltion toward owning its own packing
houses, its own establishment for seeding
raisins and the distribution of its own
products; that the great association of
prune growers failed so iamentably in its
undertaking to sell at Its own prices the
150,000,000 pounds prune crop of 1900 tha<
it never was given another crop to sell.
"It is true that this is a sad record for
co-operative packing and selling, for
these are the greatest efforts ever made
In the State, but the impression changes
If a little color is thrown upon thes pic
ture. Though the Citrus Fruit Exchange
never controlled more than half the
product, It was able to double the return
per box to growers Immediately after Its
organization by correcting the methods
of It3 rival buyers and it has exerted a.
strong influence. ever since in correcting
abuses, in extending distribution, in re
ducing fixed charges; In short, it may be
said to have rescued the California citrus
fruit interest from collapse and during
the present year it has fdrmed a merger
with rival buyers to prevent gluts and
losses in Eastern markets, an example
which was quickly followed by those
handling the Eaaiern shipment of decidu
ous fruits. Its direct value and its indi
rect value in showing fruit growers their
power when working together are both
Inestimable, and yet It never controlled
more than half the crop. .
the apple has reached the most sys
tematic and greatest development. Tho
output of Pajaro Valley apples has in
creased from 765 carloads in 1*97-98 to 2200
carloads in 1901-2, and only about one
third of the trees are now of bearing age.
"On the whole, the fruit products of
California are being easily disposed of at
fairly remunerative rates, and the busi
ness is in good heart and enjoys a good
outlook. There Is, of course, fluctuation
in the values of different fruits and in
the market conditions which they meet at
distant points. Such 'off years' strike the
fruits somewhat irregularly, and are dis
couraging first to one special grower and
then to another, and as our localities are
largely given to specializing, according
to favoring culture conditions, there is
opportunity for complaint somewhere
nearly every year. Complaining is Vhe
traditional privilege of farmers, and fruit
growers are entitled to their share of It.
Still we find that our fruit growing dis
tricts have the busiest towns, the hand
somest rural improvements, the largest
assessment rolls and are most attractive
to homeseekers. While these things are
true, our fruit industries must be counted
in prosperous condition, although the
greatest anticipations are not always
realized.
ORCHARD AREAS INCREASING.
"Although the orchard and vineyard
areas are still increasing quite rapidly in
the State as a whole, there are some dis
tricts in which special extension is nota

tofore deciduous fruits have been crown
by rainfall. The older the trees become
and the greater their demand for moist
ure in order to produce large merchant
able fruit, the greater is the Irrigated
area. The addition of water artificially
during the rainy season to the amount
which comes by rainfall is growing In
popularity where the subsoil, is deep
and retentive enough to act as a reser
voir for such water. Where this is not
enough, one or two irrigations in the sum
mer are added.
"Protection against frost, or rather the
prevention' of low temperature . at the
place where it would do injury," is becom
ing a wider recourse, not alone for citrus
fruits which are menaced by frost in De
cember, and January, but for apricots, al
monds and grape vines which are liable
to Injury . by spring frosts. The burning
of crude oil In properly contrived Iron
pots, about forty to the acre of trees, has

surrounding atmosphere from three to six
degrees Fahrenheit, that outfits of these

a tract of land fronting on Skinker road
facing the Palace of Agriculture and
overlooking the Palace of Machinery was
selected by the Commissioners, and there
they will build a reproduction, with some
modification, of the Sar.la Barbara\Mis-
Bion. ' The central structure, facing on
Skinker road, will be fifty feet wide. It
consists of an arched entrance between
two lofty dome-topped towers. On either
side are wings, two stories high and
thirty feet long. The depth of the build
ing is seventy feet, and at the rear are
two more wings of the same size and
style of architecture as those tn front.
The entrance is reached by ascending a
flight of massive stone steps the full
width of the central structure. Even to
the bells the Santa Barbara Mission will
be followed as a type. Besides beirg a
clubhouse for Calif ornians, .many of the
exhibits will be shown in this building,
and it will be rendered no attractive that
It will be one of the many favorite resorts
for World's Fair visitors.
Besides showing the resources that
have made the great Pacific State fa
mous, many novel features are planned.
An ostrich farm can be seen, and in this
inclosure will be shown the care and
training of the great birds.' The feathers
which are so valuable will form an In
teresting part of the exhibit, and the va
rious processes which the plumes under
go from the time they are plucked until
they are ready to adorn the hat or are
attached to the ivory frame of a fan will
be in harmony with the exposition theory
â to show processes side by side with the
finished product.
Of course California will make an elab
orate display in the Palace of Mines and
Metallurgy. The annual production of
gold and sliver 'in the State is more than
$20,000,000 and more than 6CO.00O pounds of
quicksilver is annually produced. In the
outside mining exhibit she will show an
especially interesting attraction. A gulch
covering an area of more than 12 acres
lies southwest of the Palace of Mines and
Metallurgy and in this California will re
produce one of the famed 1S49 mining
camps, with vivid reminders of the pio
neer days. Here will be the cabin occu
pied by John W. Mackay, the bonanza
king. Pay dirt will be aent from Califor

STATE BUILDING APART.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 12.â California, whose
area is greater than all of' the New Eng
land States combined, with the added
area of Missouri, will make an exhibit at
the World's Fair at St. Louis in keeping
with her geographical size.
[ No State and no country presents a
greater diversity of interest and climate
than does this western member of the
Union, which embraces 155,980 square
miles- and monopolizes two-thirds of
America's share of the Pacific Coast.
In the southern portion oranges, lemons,
pineapples, olives, wines, barley, wheat
and sugar corn are among the chief pro
ducts. In the extreme north wheat, oats,
barley, potatoes and hay are among the
principal crops, while sheep and stock-
I raising is a profitable industry. Every
lone of California's 'fifty-seven counties
i possesses rich mineral deposits and there
I are mined with profit gold, silver, quick
j silver, lead, copper, iron, chromium, an
\ tlmony, borax, rock salt, soda, potash and
j sulphur.
i California's legislative appropriation
j for the exposition gives no adequate idea
' cf the extent to" which the State will par
i ticipate at St. Louis. It is $130,000, but
! many times that amount will be expended
j by different communities, societies and
i individuals. The State law permits each
! county to appropriate 2 per cent of its

: nearly every county has decided to show
; its resources to the world and has raised
i the required revenue.
Alameda County's method illustrates
; the advantage of California's exposition
laws. A 2 per cent levy there created a
fund of fcJO.OOO and this sura will be ex
; pended in an exhibit characteristic of that
| section. Three thousand dollars has
been sat aside for an educational exhibit,
the fÂ«Tture of which will be a relief map'
of the county, 14 by 20 feet, prepared by
the public school pupils from papier
mache. The map will be returned to Ala
meda County alter the exposition. The
; remaining $17,000 will be expended in the
preparation of other interesting exhibits,
showing the county's resources. Thus
each county will make an exhibit that
will maintain its^individuality, and the
exhibits in the aggregate will constitute
one immense display, portraying the vast

The greatest successes In the electrical
transmission of water power have- been
made in the United States, forty-three
companies, having a total capacity of
177,300 horsepower, transmit power over a
line distance of 1549 miles, on an average
twenty-six miles, with a voltage which
ranges from 10,000 to 60,000 volts. The
maximum, distance over which power is
transmitted is from Colgate to San Fran
cisco, 220 miles, with a loss of 25 per cent.
At Colgate the body of water is small,
but the fall is 1300 feet.â Exchange.

There exists in Algeria a small stream
which nature has turned Into Ink. It is
formed - by the union of two rivulets, one
of which is very strongly impregnated
with Iron, while the other, meandering
through a peat marsh, imbibes large
quantities of gallic acid. Letters have
been written with the natural compound
of Iron and gallic acid, which forms a
small yet wonderful stream, thÂ© waters
of which, by admixture with sulphuric
acid, becomes bo sour that the river has
been appropriately named Vinegar River.

A well-known landscape painter was
busy "dashing in" the colors of a sunset.
The tints were hurriedly conveyed from
the palette to canvas, for the artist was
anxious to catch the effect. A rustic
standing by observed the operations for a
little' while and then remarked: "Ah, you
be a-painting two pictures at once.' That's
clever." He paused a moment and then
blurted out: "I like that picture bestâ the

By a system of magnets placed beneath
the rail of an elevated railroadâ magnets
which, when charged, are attracted to the
rail and so lift the car Into space â Dr.
Albert C. Albertson, a distinguished elec
trical engineer of the Royal University
of Denmark, claims that he has solved
a great transportation problem, making
the speed of 300 miles an hour not only
possible, but probable. Not only this, but
trains equipped with this patent will run
without wheels, the railroad structure
will be lighter than a ten-horsepower en
gine will be used instead of one of 300
horsepower. . Dr. Albertson's Invention
alms simply to overcome the weight of
the present railway train by means of
powerful magnets. These are attached to
the bottom of the cars in such a way as
to lift the wheels and render a 1000 pound
car as light as one pound. The attraction
of gravity thus being overcome, the heav
iest train becomes light as air, and can
be rushed along the tracks with only at
mospheric resistance to contend with.
The magnets clamp the rail above and
below, so that it is impossible for the
train to leave the track. Mr. Albertson's
announcement Is that there has been dis
covered a method of abolishing the dead
weight of the train, leaving only aerial
resistance to be contended with. If this
can be "done, as Mr. Albertson asserts,
half of the battle is won. and the world
may yet be able to travel on the earth's
surface with the much-dreamed-of hun
dreds of miles an hour.â Express Gazette.

A remarkable scheme, which has for its
object the relief of congestion of traffic in
the streets of Chicago, is proposed by the
Illinois Telephone and Telegraph Company.
i The scheme is to run an underground
| trunk line to a tract twelve miles south
I of the city. A summary of plans and pos
i Bibllities of the project is as follows: An
! expenditure of $15,000,000 in tunnels, 6 by 7
I feet or 12 by 14 feet; transportation of
I freight by means of- ten-foot electric cars,
I which will be brought right into the base,
ments of Chicago's big buildings by means
of elevators. The tract, with its ware
houses and direct tunnel connection with
the basements of the principal buildings
of Chicago, will result in the abolition of
I freight sheds and depots in the heart of
the city. Congestion in the heart of the
city: will be so relieved that the running
time of street cars will be materially in
creased.â Exchange.

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 12-Owlng to the
shortage of water In the American River
and the large consumption of water by
the Folsom LJght and Power Company, j
the State prison at Folsom cannot derive |
enough power to operate the rock crush
ers on full time. In fact, the crushers
cannot now be run with enough speed to
turn out rock up to standard.
The Board of Prison Directors had the
matter brought to their notice a long time
ago end have In various ways tried to ob- j
viute the existing difficulty, but without
tangible results. The directors have now"
been submitted a proposition to alleviate
the trouble and at their next meeting at
Folsom prison on Saturday, September 19,
will investigate the proposition thor
oughly. Â¦
The rock crushers at Folsom. are ope
rated by waterpower. Many years ago
the Folsom Power Company and the
State jolrftly dug a canal. Two falls were
Constructed in this canal, one of twelve
feet, and lower down stream one of seven
feÂ«.-t. The corporation was to get the
water from the steep drop, while the
prison was to be supplied by the seven
foot fall. A powerhouse was constructed
and sluicegates erected.
Subsequently the State officials and the
power company had a misunderstanding,
resulting in an injunction suit which is
still pending. In the meantime the cor
poration has closed the upper canal gates,
thus depriving the prison of as much
water as is necessary.* At this time of
year the water is low and the prison is
curtailed greally in their supply. Some
thing must be done at once or the rock
crusher plant soon rriust be shut down.
It is asserted that there is a movement
on foot to either effect a compromise with
the power company upon past differences,
to absorb It. or to entirely eliminate water
power at Foisom and Install an electric
plant similar to the one now in operation
at San Quentin. John Martin, president
of the Central Gas and Electric Company
was at San Quentin to-day and for sev
eral hours was closeted with the direc
tors. During this conference it is under
stood plans were devised for the solution
of the problem.;
Special IMspatch to The Call.
Director Felton was particularly anxious
that the convict be provided forthwith
a plate, but the other members of the
board, while concurring in the belief that
they were essential, yet asserted there
was no provision made for such pur
chases; that it would establish a prece
dent for convicts to ask for all kinds of
things, and that the bill would not be
paid.
"Very well." said Senator Felton, "let
us create a fund quick. If It can not be
done any other way, I will take up a
collection myself. There should be a
missionary fund for Just such purposes.
We do not have to buy wigs, toupees
and any old thing for these inmates, but
when a fellow needs teeth he needs them
bad. I fully appreciate the predicament
and believe in helping deserving cases."
It was finally decided that the matter
be referred to the Board of Examiners
with recommendation that the prison di
rectors be allowed to outfit Hansler with
a full set.
The directors have no funds available
for such purposes and Warden Tompkins
claims the prisoner Is fast losing his
health by being unable to masticate hla
food. The matter was presented , to the
prison directors during their session to
day and occupied considerable of their
time.
SAN QUENTIN, Sept. 12. -G. S. Hans
ler, a life-termer In San Quentin prison,
wants the Board of Prison Directors to
furnish him a set of false teeth. Hansler
has not a single molar in his head, is
utterly devoid of friends and claims his
entire worldly possessions consists of
$1 50 on jieposit at the prison treasury.
Prison Directors Discuss an Unusual
and Momentous Application.
CONVICT WANTS TEETH.
The offices of overseer of the Jute mill.
$100 per month; chief engineer, $135, and
tailor, at $100 per month, were abolished.
The office of chief electrician, at $135 per
month, was created, and the appointment
of J. A. Woohl was ratified. It was also
ordered that Warden Tompkins install
electric power to pump water for the
prison at a cost not to exceed $700. At
the present time the State is paying $*500
each month for the same work by steam
power. The electricity will cost $18 per
month.
The board adjourned to meet at Fo'sora
Saturday, September 19.
Various offices at the prison were abol- |
ished, while others were created. Some
salaries of attaches were increased and j
the remuneration of others was curtailed.
The prison guard was ordered increased
and new watch towers are to be con
structed. Other improvements at the
prison, as recommended by "Warden
Thompkins, were considered and some of
the ideas will be carried out. The board
was in session all day.
The meeting was called to. order at 10
a. ra. Chairman Fitzgerald stated that
he had hoped Governor Pardee would be
present, but it was not possible. Direc
tors Wray and Devlin were also absent.
Attorney W. W. Foote of San Francisco
and Senator Charles Shortrldge appeared
on behalf of Frank J. Klessner and
Charles B. Wilcox respectively. Both
men are life-termers and want to be
parolÂ«d. Klessner was convicted in Red
Bluff of having murdered Theodore Tryor
and. has served nearly twenty-three years
of his term. The crime was the outcome
of land trouble. Klessner is an old Union
soldier and receives a large pension. He
came to California in 1875 and has a wife
and five children.
Wilcox's application has been on file for
a long time. In fact, at the last meeting
of the board prior to Governor Gage's re
tirement from office they recommended
executive clemency and fully expected
that Wilcox would be pardoned. He killed
a man ten years ago in San Jose during
a political argument. Shortridge wished
the board to change that portion of its
resolution reading "for valuable, extraor
dinary and efficient service to the State
we recommend executive clemency in De
Â¦half of Charles B. WSlcox," to read, "we
recommend a pardon." The 'matter will
be decided at the next meeting.
During the afternoon In an executive
session it was ordered that four more
guards be appointed, at compensation of
! $50 each per month. The salary of com
i missary, the position held by Irving S.
i Ballard, was increased from $125 to $150
1 per month. Right Gatekeeper Frank
; Arbogast will recelce $75 instead of $50,
and the boss of the road gang will re
ceive $100 Instead of $60 per month.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 12.â Russia has
requested Dermlssion of China to post
pone her evacuation of one of the frontier
provinces of Manchutia for several months
after October 8, the date for the general
evacuation of Manchuria. Minister Con
ger cabled to the State Department this
fact, and thjÂ»-niatter has been referred to
Secretary Hay at the Secretary's summer
home In New Hampshire, for considera
tion. The State Department apparently Is
not concerned over Russia's request, as
It is pointed out the province is a small
one and the postponement asked for Is
only for a short time.
The Washington Government has re
ceived satisfactory assurance from the St.
Petersburg authorities that the general
evacuation of Manchuria will occur on
October S. If for some reasons purely lo
c^.1 to the province in question, Russia
sliould request permission to postpone the
withdrawal of her troops from that par
ticular province 'for several months. It is
said to be for China to say whether the
request shall be granted.
The request, In the opinion of the State
Department officials, does not Indicate
that Russia intends to break her pledge to
the powers. Secretary Hay will prepare
instructions for Conger, upon receipt of
which the latter will advise the Peking

ROME. Sept. 12.â The Pope, fulfilling a
promise made to Rev. Dennis McConnell,
rector of the Catholic University at
Washington, when the latter was pre

him to-day a most cordial letter con
taining a brief in favor of the Catholic
University at Washington. The Pope
most warmly recommends the university
to the support of the whole people of the
United States, trusting in their generosity
to enable it to accomplish Its object,
.which Is to maintain and augment the

The original cause for the summons sent
to the Cabinet at th:s unusual period of
the year was the discussion of Colonial
Secretary Chamberlain's fiscal proposals
und the preparation of Premier Balfour's
promiped upon that sub
ject. Since then the fiscal agitation has
become of ..almost Eecondary Interest, in
tense feeling having been aroused by the
Scuth African War Commission's report,
while public sentiment Is aJsoN3eeply ex

that it must take action to remedy the
LONDON. Sept. IT.â A special meet

that the Government will break up and
that a general election will be held, or, at

scandals revealed by the commission,
while the Times, backed up by the Lib
eral press, demands greater British ini
tiative in putting an end to the massacres
in Macedonia,
In this connection it is said Balfour will
see King Edward before meeting his col
leagues on Monday. The King has been
taking an active interest in the Balkan
situation, and the present interview may
. result in some statement of the attitude
I of the Government.
I BaJfour does not expect any crisis
' necessitating the Cabinet's resignation
arising on Monday, though the antago
nism of the Duke of Devonshire, Lord
President of the Council, and Chancellor
of the Exchequer Ritchie toward Cham
berlain's propaganda may create breaches
; which even Balfour cannot foresee.
; It is announced that by the middle of
next week the official papers showing the
result of the Government's investigation
of Great Britain's official status will be
published.
The, chief whinof one of the political
parties said to-day that the mest astute
politicians could not forecast the ap
proaching developments, but that the
sanest surmise pointed to another period
of uncertainty, with the members of the
Cabinet taking opposing views on the
fiscal question, while the Government as
a whole attempted to remedy the ill ef
fects of the w-ir scandals in all branches
of life, especially business and political.
Consequently Monday's meeting of the
Ministers is anticipated with intense in
terest and no little apprehension.
BERLIN, Sept. 12.â Paul Perwltzscky

in connection with terrible abuses com

Inmates were maltreated, compelled to
climb on a hot stove and march at the

One witness testified that he was bitten
by a dog, which he believed was trained
for this purpose. Another inmate who
escaped from the workhouse and was
brought back in order to be released gave
vent to insults against the Emperor,
which resulted In his getting a longer
sentence in a rejjular prison.

"The origin of the term 'grass widow,' "
said a philologist, "is puzzling. Some
eay it came from the Frenchâ that it was
originally 'grace widow*; that is, wjdow
by grace, or courtesy. Others say it de
rives from the old English custom of a
man's hanging out a broom when his wife
was away over night. To hang out the
broom was a common phrase. When this
thing was done the meaning was that the
house had been swept clear of the wife's
presence and the husband's friends were
to visit him and do as they pleased. In
time. Instead of hanging out a broom, the
husband came to hang out only a bunch
of grass. Thus he grew to be called a
â¢grass widower.' and his wife, a 'grass
widow.' "âPhiladelphia Record.

vlctlon that In order to attain anything
like success the American Mining Con
gress "would have to be cradled In the
arms of the miners," which was taken to
mean that the congress' membership
should be held in mining districts, rather
than In cities of capitalists. President
Richards spoke of the necessity of mak
ing the congress a body membership in
which would be an honor, declaring that
the weakness which was becoming ap
parent In the miners' federation lay in
the fact that it was ceasing to be an
honor to belong to that organization. C.
L. Dimnowlty of Boulder. Colo., read a
paper on "The Revelation of Gold' Min
ing and the Economic Treatment of Low
Grade Ores."
The committee appointed to draft res
olutions of thanks to President Roose
velt for his recognition of the Ameri
can Mining Congress, by sending Secre
tary Shaw to represent him before that
body, made its report, which was adopt
ed by a rising vote.
It was decided that President Richards
should appoint a committee of fifteen
members of the congress whose duty It
should be to induce as many members of
the mining congress as possible to visit
the St. Louis Exposition in a body in
charge of this committee. The commit
tee, with Thomas Ewing of Los Angeles
as chairman, was at once selected. Just
before adjournment E. W. Martin, on be
half of the Black Hills Mining Associa
tion, presented to President Richards a
badge of membership in the American
Mining Congress made of Black Hills
gold, as a token of the appreciation and
gratitude for the manner In which hÂ» had
given his services during the past year, in
the furtherance of the Interests of the
American mining industry. /

members, making a total of 789 legally en

NEW. YORK. Sept. 12.â Dorothy Scott,
a pretty San Francisco heiress, is the
latest recruit to the company which will
support Nat C. Goodwin In "A Midsummer
Night's Dream." Miss Scott, who is a
relative of the latÂ» Irving M. Scott. Is 18
years of age. She was an undergraduate
of fashionable Mills College last spring
when Goodwin visited San Francisco. The
comedian heard her sing and recite at an
amateur musicale and offered her an en
gagement In hi* company. Miss Scott's
parents objected to â¢ a stage career, but
tears on the part of the young woman and
compliments from the comedian prevailed
and an extended contract was signed, by
the terms of which Miss Scott, will be neen
for several seasons with the Goc dwtn com
pany.
A French governess, an English chape
ron and a German maid will accompany
the young woman on her tour with "A
Midsummer Night's Dream." : '
"Who is that man back there asking for
a postponement?" Inquired St. Peter as
the candidates crowded around him.

\ Several resolutions were adopted, among
which 'was one to recommend to the leg
islatures of the several States and Ter
ritories the enactment of laws to afford
better ' protection to - life and limb of per
sons employed in and about mines. The
subject of increasing the membership in
the congress was brought up by Richard
C. Patterson of Omaha, who succeeded in
arousing the first burst of genuine en
thusiasm during the present session and
whose presentation of the purposes of the
organization and the essentials to Its
future progress had the effect of adding
immediately a score of new permanent
members to the congress, . for which the
congTess tendered him a vote of thanks.

OFFICERS ELECTED.
DEADWOOD, 8. D., Sept. 12.â The
American" Mining Congress to-day re
elected J. H. Richards of Boise, Idaho,
president of the coming year, selected
Portland, Or., as the place at which to
hold the annual session in 1904 and ad
journed.
The recommendation of Portland as the
next meeting place came In the form of a
motion by Mr. Patterson of Omaha, and
no other city was suggested. Professor
â¢J. A. Holmes, chief of the Bureau of
Mines and Mining of the St. Louis exposi
tion, who came to the congress with the
purpose of endeavoring to secure the next
session at St. Loulsl seconded the motion,
and Portland's selection was made unani
mous. A particular brand of enthusiasm
peculiar to mining men which the mere
presence of such a great number of rep
resentatives of the mining Industry from
all parts of the United States seemed to
show could not be lacking here, but which
had not characterized the earlier days of
the proceedings, to-day's interesting ses
sions showed had only been lying dor
mant or working beneath the surface. It
only needed a spark of life to ignite it
and set the congress aglow with a typical
miner's ardor and adjournment came with
every one feeling the greatest satisfaction
in the results of the sixth annual session.

MILWAUKEE, Sept. 12.â A Sentinel
dispatch from Augusta, Wis., says that
town and its vicinity are flooded, the re
sult of a cloudburst. The levee went out
and the floods swept through the center
of the town, carrying everything before
it., The greatest losers are Finch, Worth

building and contents; Taggart & Mohr,
farm implements, building and contents;
J. L. Ball, electric light plant; John An
derson, one building; Cox Brothers Com
pany, barns and sheds; O'Brien, livery sta
ble. No estimate of the loss can be made
until the water recedes. Every railroad
running through the Northwest Is crip

.As. the vocation is that which calls a
man day by day, the avocation is that
which calls him away from his chosen
task and necessary pursuits, that which
turns him aside from the beaten path.-
There are not a few illustrations of the
avocation proving. In the long run, the
better, the more desirable, the more truly
remunerative of the two, says a writer In
the July Cosmopoutan. Tnis country will
long recall with gratitude the great ser
vices rendered in its behalf by Edward
Atkinson, economist and statistician, so
ciologist and humanitarian by avocation;
by vocation, an accountant. No one may
doubt that the name of Stedman, the
poet, the man of letters, will continue a
household word, standing for all that is
charming and sympathetic, yet Intelligent
and discerning In literary work and criti
cism, long after our children have for
gotten that he was a banker. The avo
cation of Elihu Burrlttâ linguistic Â¦ re
search soon outran the vocation of black
smith, though he carried the title of
"Learned Blacksmith" to his grave. Pe
ter Cooper was never so deep in his busi
neES as to forget or to slight his almost
lifelong study of the needs of the youth of
New York ouy. When Abram .Hewitt
died, many were surprised to know that
he had been a' great and successful Iron
master, so thoroughly had his avocation
of public service overshadowed his origi
nal calling. Robert Grant turns from hia
honored position on the bench, and Weir
Mitchell from his marvelous success in
his chosen profession, to delight us with
word pictures in fascinating tales. Exam
ples could be multiplied almost without
number of those whose power and Influ
ence have been enlarged,. whose hold upon
the confidence and esteem of their fellow
men has been strengthened, and whose
lives have been most remarkably Intensi
fied by the results of constant and faith
ful devotion to an avocation wisely chosen

But an extraordinary thing has occur
red. The President's secretary, Loeb, has
written a letter to Colgate Hoyt declaring
that neither Sir Thomas nor any of his
jiarty must come to the dinner. Loeb an
nounced that Sir Thomas had recently
been received as guest on the President's
yacht Mayflower during the naval maneu
vers at Oyster Bay and that the President
did not want to seem to be "overdoing
courtesies to him. and It might be thought
that Sir Thomas' presence at the dinner
was due to the fact that the President
v.as to be there. Anyhow the President
objected to the presence of Sir Thomas
or any of his party or of any persons ex
cept members of the club.
The committee was aghast. If it with
drew its invitation to Sir Thomas and his
party that act would be an insult to them.
If it allowed the invitations to stand the
President would refuse to attend. The
President's letter was written in unmis
takable lansruajre; neither Sir Thomas nor
any of his party must be at the dinner.
Just how the^committee arrived at its de
cision it is impossible to say.'buf the ln
vitatrons to. Sir Thomas, Mr. Fife, the-
Earl of Shaftesbury" and other members
of the party were withdrawn.
The Seawanhaka-Corinthian Clubhouse
Is on the shore of Oyster Bay, net far
from Mr. Roosevelt's home. As the time
for the club's annual dinner approached
it occurred to the members that It would
be courteous and neighborly to Invite the
PreFident as guest of honor. In further
ance of that kindly thought Colgate Hoyt,
senior member of the committee having:
the matter in charge, went In person to
Sagamore Hill and delivered the Invita
tion.
In order to serve Mr. Roosevelt's con
venience he was requested toTiame a time
when he would be free from engagements,
eo that the club might arrange to have
its dinner on that date.
The President accepted the invitation
and named September 18. A few days ago
the committee sent invitations to the din
ner to Sir Thomas Llpton, Mr. Fife, the
Earl of Shaftesbury and another member
of his party. Sir Thomas and his friends
gladly accented the invitation. The club
made ready to receive and entertain them.

No csty, ambitious of its future, strives to keep out transportation facilities, and so far social
ism has nowhere efficiently supplied those conveniences which are constructed by private capital in
the hope of gain.
The issue, in Alameda has reached the mass-meeting,, denunciation and injunction stage, and
charges against the Town Trustees are freely bandied about the streets, which no sober-minded citi
zen believes.- It would seem in order to cool off, look atthe matter with common business sense, and
do those things which will" keep the pleasant.town in marching order on the progressive road it has
so far traveled. .
The Call is not celebrated at home or abroad for its excessive love of the Southern Pacific,
and is as ready to oppose unjust pretensions of that corporation as it is to advise the people of Ala
meda that the day has gone by, if indeed it ever was, when a city can advance its interests by driv
ing out transportation facilities: That pleasant city exists at all because of its very abundant â¢ local
railroad-and ferry facilities. -It has two lines of local road, while Oakland and Berkeley have only
one each, and it has', by these lines, the choice of three ferry systems, the Alameda, Oakland and
creek routes. The supplying of these abundant advantages involves a very large investment. Under
the law, at the termination of a franchise the terminal facilities may be alienated by public sale to
.a competitor, and under such circumstances it is natural that a franchise should be sought of a
tenure sufficiently lon.g to justify the large investment necessary for its use.
Of course the primary purpose of the railroad is to make a profit. But the secondary purpose
of the franchise is to continue to Alameda her present facilities and to enlarge them as may
be necessary. The railroad hopes that the number of its commuters will increase and its profits also,
but that means the attraction of more people to Alameda by the facilities it supplies. Under 'these cir
cumstances to refuse a franchise, or to put it under unbusinesslike limitations, appears like inflicting
more harm upon Alameda than upon the. railroad. To do this in furtherance of the socialistic theory
seems an amazing proposition. To anticipate that Alameda will create a railroad and ferry system of
her own, under socialistic conditions, and that to do so she will immediately oust, end and destroy her
present facilities, is fantastic. The immediate effect would be a large decrease in her population the
vacation of property now occupied by commuters, a decline in her local trade and a general disturb
ance of her existing prosperous conditions. .. . ' Â¦l'..\./ l . .
In regard to the franchise a misunderstanding has arisen which is taken advantage of by the
socialist element, and in the public discussions we read the spokesmen of that part of the popula
tion, to the effect that it will be an excellent thing to drive the railroad out of Alameda entirely, for
then the city will supply its own system of transportation and live happy ever after.
IN the rebuilding of its ferry-house and betternjents of its service in Alameda it has become
necessary for the Southern Pacific railroad to make large expenditures and to secure its fran
chise for the use of the property. We know of no valid objections to the character of its ser
vice. The facilities it has furnished have enabled the settlement in Alameda of four thousand
commuters, who do business in San Francisco. If we were selfishly seeking to further the interests
of San Francisco we would advocate such antagonism to the railroad in Atameda as would force
these four thousand commuters, and their families, to come back to San Francisco, where their busi
ness is. They would make an appreciable addition to the consuming power of this city, where they
earn their living. But they prefer to livejn Alameda, and their preference is supported by the facili
ties furnished by the railroad, which has two lines running through that city, which is only about a
mile wide. The cost of running the local trains to supply that service, leaving out the ferry-boats,
interest on capital and deterioration, approximates $100,000 a year.

"Idylls of the King"â the story of what
he considers Wagner's masterpiece. He
has followed the opera as closely as was
consistent with his epic plan.
The legend of the Holy Grail. In which
Parsifal plays his part, took many forms
during the Middle Ages. It was told in
slightly varying ways in the twelfth cen
tury by the French writers, Robert de
Borron and Chrestlen de Troyes, and In
the early thirteenth century by Wolfram
von Eschenbach In the strong German
speech of Thuringia. The substance of
these legends was that the precious cup
used for the wine at the Last Supper
and also used to' receive the Savior's
blood at the cross was forever after cher
ished as the Holy Grail. It was carried
from the Holy Land by Joseph of Ari
mathea and taken first to Gaul and later
to Spain to a special sanctuary among the
mountains which was named Monsalvat.
Here It was to be cherished and guarded
by a holy band of Knights of the Grail.
The same legend appears In the chron
icles of Sir Thomas Malory, but Instead
of Gaul early Britain is the place to
which the Grail is taken. Tennyson's
"The Holy Grail" in his "Idylls of the
King" largely follows Sir Thomas Mal
ory's chronicles.
Wagner, on the other hand, followed
more closely in the steps of Wolfram von
Eschenbach. The present version, there
fore, is Wagnerian In story, though Ten
nysonlan In style.
It Is so painstaking and scholarly a per
formance that one hates to say to Mr.
Huckel what Jeffrey said to Wordsworth,
"This will never do." Perhaps Mr. Huckel
may console himself with the thought
that the world has decided that Jeffrey
was wrong.
From the opening lines of his work the
world may Judge for itself whether tfils
carefully polished but quite uninspired
verse will do as a paraphrase of Wagner
or an Imitation of Tennyson:
Within a noble stretch of mountain woods.
Primeval forest, deeD and dark and grand.
There rose a glorious castle towering high.
And at Its foot a smiling, shimmering; lake
Lay in the Etlll lap of a verdant glade.
'Twas daybreak, and the arrows of the dawn
Â¦Were shot In golden glory through the trees.
And from the castle came a trumpet blast
To waken life in all the s'.umberlng host â
Warriors and yeomen in the castle halls.
LONDON, Sept. 12.â One of the
most barefaced literary frauds
that can be recalled has Just
been perpetrated on . the Lit
erary "World. It was discoi-ered
by the editor of the Academy
that the article entitled "Dual Personali
ties." signed "A. N. t " which appeared in
the Literary World, was taken bodily
from so recent an issue of the Academy
cs February 14 last. Naturally the editor
of the Literary World feels very sore at
the fraud perpetrated on him and he says
this week's matter will be the subjec^ of
a judicial investigation.
The Literary World, he continues, has
often printed In Its correspondence col
umn many bitter complaints about the
ead behavior of the editors, but very little
is ever said of the grievous frauds some
times perpetrated upon the editors by
contributors.
This la a particularly flagrant one. An
individual writing from a, well-known
West End club submitted a number of
typewritten .articles to the editor, who,
suspecting nothing, accepted one of them
and promised to consider the others. No
sooner, however, had the first appeared
than the Academy spotted a barefaced
fraud. The editor of the Literary World
betook himself to Scotland Yards, so he
says, and obtained some Interesting infor
mation about the antecedents of the per
petrator.
It is premature to say yet what the de
velopments may be, but the article In
question would not have been used so
readily had not the name and the place
from which It was sent appeared quite
sufficient testimony of good faith.

Some surprise is expressed In literary
circles that a certain weekly paper should
have published a protest by Professor
Kenier of Turin and Dr. Alexander Luzio,
director of the Royal Archives at Man
tua, against the use made of their writ
ings in Mrs. Ady's book on Beatrice and
Isabclle d'Este, which have received most
congratulatory reviews as being Invalu
able to all those interested In the life and
art of the Italian Renaissance. But the
point In question seems to be how far
one author is Justified In quoting from
others. It is not as if It were a case of
plagiarism. As the St. James. Gazette re
marks, surely an Italian writer, say on
Charles of England, would be well en
titled by literary etiquette to avail him
self of the writings of an authority such
as Dr. Gardiner and others, provided
acknowledgment was made. ;
Now. Mrs. Ady most distinctly acknowl
edges her indebtedness to the gentlemen
who protest against what she has done
both In her list of authorities and her
foot notes, while in the prefaces of both
books she pays explicit and unreserved
tribute to them as the latest and greatest
authorities on her subject.

"On June 13 last. In company with M.
Gulnoiseauâ one of the observers of the
French commissionâ I made the ascent of
Pelee, and from the immediate crater rim
took a series of? photographs of Pelee's
singular process, probably the most- Im
pressive piece -of nature that I had ever
seen. The volcano, by comparison with
what it had been before, had 'slumbered
down to peace,' but yet It was too ac
tive to permit us to descend Into the cra
teral hollow, 300 to 350 feet In depth, that
doubtless that which is now
taking place â the pushing forth from Its
summit of an enormous obelisk of pol
ished rock as a cork Is pushed from a
soda water bottle by the expanding gas
within. This- wonder is thus described in
Science (August 7) by Professor Angelo
Hellprin. He says:
"Not the least remarkable of the many :
extraordinary conditions that have been j
associated with the recent eruptions of
the Martinique volcano is the extrusion
of the giant tower of rock, a veritable
obelisk, which to-day dominates the moun
tain, and which has given to it an added
height of S00 to 900 feet. Pelee is no
longer 4200 or 4428 feet in elevation, which
it had been, prior to the eruption of May
8, 1902, but upward of 5000 feet. This tower
of rock, the nature of Â¦ which was first
properly made known by Professor La
crolx. Issues directly, and to all intents
and purposes vertically, from the summit j
of .the new cone of the volcano (of what
ever precise nature this cone may be)
which Has been built up In the ancient,
crateral-basln (the Etang Sec) to a height
of 1G00 feet or more, and virtually plugs
it. Where it Is Implanted it has a thick
ness of some 3C0 to 350 feet. From certain
points of view the obelisk seems to main
tain for most of Its height (S00 plus
feet) a fairly uniform thickness; from
other points It shows a rapidly tapering
surface, with a termination in a needle
summit, a true aiguille. It is gently
curved or arched toward the southwest,
or in the direction of St. Pierre, and on
this face It is cavernous or openly slaggy,
showing- where successive and repeated
explosions had carried away portions of
the substance. On the opposite side, or
toward the east-northeast, the surface
appears solid, Is smoothed and even pol
ished in part, and shows longitudinal par
allel grooves. and striae, very- much like
glacial markings. On this side it shows
plainly the marks of hard attrition, the
effect of rubbing upon the encasing rock
â the mold, in fact, that determined a por
tion of the exit channel.
"The constitution of this extruded
'cork' is undeniably lavaâ a lava whose
viscosity or rapid solidification did not
permit it to flow over, but which under'l
the giant stress of the volcano simply
moved upward, solid from base to sum
mit, and receiving accretions to its mass
only from below. The most cursory ex
amination of the' relations existing would
immediately point to this form of growth
and â¢ development, but the carefully con
ducted angle measurements and observa
tions of contour made by the represent
atives at two stations of the French Sci
entific Commission leave no possibility
of doubt in the matter, and they further
furnish .us with data touching the rate of
growth. Thus, in eight days -preceding
June 7 this growth was, . as we are in
formed by M. Glraud, ten meters (thir
ty-three feet); and in the four days
preceding June 15 (a period within the
time of my recent visit to the volcano) it
measured six meters (twenty feet). .The
consideration of the depth to which this
giant monument descends solid into the
volcano "would be interesting were there
any way of. reaching the problem, but
for the present there would seem to be
none such. â¢ â¢ -

The model of this novel railway train
consists of some eighteen feet of track
and a small car which runs backward
or forward magnetically suspended, and
with an ease that Is remarkable. Briefly,
the whole Invention is the solving of the
problem of subtracting weight, by the alii
of powerful magnet3. To understand how
this' is accomplished let us suppose that
a train weighs 'twenty tons. Then. If we
use magnets possessing an attraction suf
ficiently powerful to raise eighteen tons,
the weight of the train will be reduced
to two tons. Th.en. as may be readily
understood, when the magnetic force is
turned on, the train would sll.lo aions
the rails with a friction equal to one
tenth of the original weight of the train.
At first glance it might seem that
whatever Is gained by the reduction oi
locomotive power must be applied to the
establishment of magnets strong enough
to lift a given weight. .But tfci3 .la not
so. Five hundred amperes, for example,
will lift at least sixty tons, the moving
of which ordinarily requires a steam, lo
comotive, but which, suspended, can be
drawn by a /ew horse-power. The' cur
rent for the purpose could be picked up
from a wire along the track or â¢ from
storage batteries placed In the cars.
There Is at the present time on view at
Cable Building. New York, says The
Sphere, a model of a magnetically sus
pended train which has reached approxi
mately the terrific speed of three hun
dred miles an hour. The Invention la at
tracting considerable attention amon;
railway engineers, and capitalists arc
even now endeavoring to secure right
of way for a practical line of thfci kind.
The invention Is the work of D*r. A. C.
Albertson, a prominent member of tna

"Geologists will naturally make a com
parison between the Pelee structure anil

dome of the latter is probably nearer to
the cone of Pelee. and suggests little of
the obelisk and of its method of forma

still surrounded the new cons. ' Steam and
sulphur puffs were Issuing everywhere,
and avalanches of rock were repeatedly
being disengaged from the obelisk. Pelee
was still 'ugly,' and the night before the
southwest base of Its crown or plug was
glowing with fireâ with the liquid lava
that was rising In rift passages. -Two
days later I noted a feeble line of steam
issuing from the absolute apex of thf
summit, suggesting a continuous passage
or channel extending from base to sum

candescent balls was observed also to
take place from the same position.
TWO VIEWS OF MONT PELEE ILLUSTRATING ITS REMARKABLE
INCREASE IN HEIGHT, AND A MODEL OF A LATE INVENTION, A
MAGNETICALLY SUSPENDED TRAIN.
The revelation is as singular as it is interesting. It exhibits the extent to which leaders, am
bitious for power, have gathered to themselves, by the binding force of an oath, a jurisdiction that
usurps the fjface of both civil and spiritual^ ealty. It goes without saying that such control of any con
siderable body of our people separates them from their fellow-citizens, both morally and politically, and
prepares them for use against the authority and supremacy of the state. The matter becomes exceed
ingly serious, in view of the enormous foreign immigration which immediately recruits the ranks of
union labor and is taught that there is in this country an allegiance superior to that to the Govern
ment itself. When this idea is reinforced by personal violence, unpunished, by compelling men to
resign from the National Guard, and by other acts that, going unrebuked and unhindered, convince
foreigners that a power superior to the Government is actually here,/ the effect is a matter of
the gravest concern.
All thinking men and genuine friends of labor feel that even the great displays of Labor day
are impressed by the use of a power that dilutes individuality and citizenship, since every member
must march under penalty of a fine, and every one must refrain from work under penalty of a fine
of $25, no matter what may be the necessities of his family. The sight of the marching hosts would
teach a higher lesson if it were known that every man in the ranks was there voluntarily to testify
his allegiance to a great.sentiment. Force belongs to the Government, and jiot to individuals or or- >
ganizations not recognized by the law. When such organizations claim the right of sovereignty
and also the right to absolve men from all religious and civil obligations, it is time tor the well-dis
posed to examine the effect upon our citizenship. Foreign immigration, to be safe and desirable,
must be as rapidly as possible assimilated by our institutions. Otherwise" it remains an undigested
increment and element of danger. To introduce it into the country under the supposed protection of
an oath and an obligation higher than that to the Government is to separate it immediately from
our institutions and assimilate it with a power paramount and inimical to them. Every good Amer
ican citizen in any union should see the enormous gravity of such a. situation and agitate reforms
that put them in line with their country and its constitutional purposes.
Archbishop Ireland and Cardinal Gibbons have already called attention to the denial of a non
union laborers right to work as an offense against society. Such denial is the assertion of power
that the Government itself cannot exercise, for Government cannot deny to any free man the right
Â©f private contract for the disposal of his labor.
. Justice Brewer wrote the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in the Debs case,' and
therein said, "If a State, with its recognized power of sovereignty, is impotent to obstruct interstate
commerce, can it be that any mere voluntary association of individuals within the limits of that State
has a power which the State itself does not possess?"
The question answers itself and the court so held. Applying the principle to denial of the right
to labor under private contract this self-answering question may be asked: "If a State, with its rec
ognized power of sovereignty, is impotent to prevent any man laboring under a private contract,
can it be that any mere voluntary association of individuals within the limits of tha^ State has a
power which the State itself does not possess?"
It will be seen that the idea of an allegiance to a power superior to the State is necessary to
effect the purposes of the union oath, to which first the State and now the church objects.
DURING the investigation of the case of, Miller, the bookbinder- foreman in the Govern
ment Printing Office at Washington, it was discovered that the oath of the labor unions,
represented in the Government employ, -forswears their allegiance to the constitution of
the United States, and that the members regarded their national allegiance as secondary.-
It was quite remarkable that at first they all determined to stand upon this paramodnt allegiance to
the unions, and the matter assumed an..aspect so serious that an order was issued for them all to take
the oath of allegiance to the .constitution of the United States, the same as other" Government em
ployes. Of course this means that they must abjure allegiance to their unions if they desire to work
for the Government. But the union oath remains upon the far larger number who are not in Gov
ernment employ, and presents a revolutionary issue that must attract attention. It^is not permitted
that an American citizen hold any civil obligation higher than that imposed upon him by the con
stitution, in his character as a citizen. The action of the Government seems to have called the at
tention of the Catholic church to the matter and the discovery is made that the same oath of the
unions requires priority of obligation and allegiance superior to any religious as well as political
authority. It is announced that Bishop Scannell of Omaha and high dignitaries of the church in Mil
waukee and Kansas City have decided to withhold the sacraments from all who have taken such
an oath.

ber 24.Ringllng Bros.' great show drew tremen
dous crowds yesterday at both afternoon
and evening performances. At the night
performance the huge canvas was packed
to its fullest capacity, many being obliged
to stand during the entire evening. So
ciety was out in great force, the boxes be
ing crowded with elegantly dressed men
and women.
A large number of people spent the
nvhole evening enjoying the many wonders
of the animal kingdom that fill the big
menagerie tent. The great herd of ele
phants and the big band of camels all
came in for attention and admiration, but
the most attention was devoted to the
three little baby lions that were born in
the tent on Thursday night. Although but
two days old, they have commenced to
frolic about the cage like little kittens.
Their arrival caused a great sensation
among all the other little baby animals in
the lnclosure, and they , all evinced the
greatest interest in the new addition to
their kingdom. They all Insisted on be
ing allowed to be taken to the cage to see
the little cubs and Join in the christening
ceremonies. A procession of the young
sters was formed, and with great dignity
they marched up to the home of the new
comers.
First came baby elephant Boo, eight
months old. followed by baby camel Miss
Sahara, six months old; baby sacred calf
Little Tom, three months old; little spot
ted fawn London, three months old; the
three baby lion cubs, Dexter, Beloit and
Sandy, six months old; the three baly
tiger cubs, Hope, Faith and Charity, three
weeks old, and last waddled along the
two little black leopard kittens, An
tony and Cleopatra.
A circle was formed about the home of
the little strangers, and big elephant Jum
bo, standing in the middle, acted as mas
ter of ceremonies. Without any unneces
sary fuss he announced that the names
of the causes of Â«.il the commotion would
be Frisco, Alameda and San "Jose. This
was hailed with acclamations of delight
on all sides. When the expressions of en
thusiasm had somewhat subsided Dexter,
the father of the trio, and Sultana, the
mother, gave vent to their appreciation
of the kind reception tendered to their
offspring by a series of thunderous roars
that fairly shook the tent and sent many
of the more timid of the company to seek
Immediate cover.
The reception, which was the most note
worthy that has taken place this season
in the Ringllng show, came to an end at
midnight. .
There will be two performances to-day
and two to-morrow, which will close the
season here. â¢
Tuesday the circus, will give two per
formances In Alameda and then will go
to San Jose.

Among the most popular attractions for
the best class of entertainment seekers
are the Sunday night psychic demonstra
tions by Dr. Alex J. McIvor r Tyndall, ex
ponent of th,e occult. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
appeals not alone to the'amusement seek
er, but to those who like to unite the in
itructlve with their entertainment. To
this large class Mclvor-Tyndall's lectures
and demonstrations of the wonders of the
human mind are interesting. He offers a
scientific explanation of the phenomena
he presents, and while his faculty of send
ing and receiving thought vibrations is
nothing short of startling, the manner in
which the wonders are produced is strict
ly in accord with scientific principles.
There has been a large demand for re
served seats at Steinway Hall to-night.
The first part of the evening will be de
voted to a lecture on VDlvorce: Its Rela-t
tion to Psychology."
Tyndall's Lectures.
In the high-heel country woman never
walks and is generally but of repair. Driv
ing-that is. being drivenâ and riding
while young afford many of the fashion
able women of France their principal ex
ercise. Meanwhile, the ultra fashionable
spend their leisure being compressed by
the modiste and being high-heeled by the
shoemaker.
Health statistics in Gaul tell the rest of
the story. What is lacking in one detail
Is apparent to even the untrained eye.
The French woman no longer Juvenile,
Is fat. shapeless. Inert and morgue, cyn
ical, selfish and blase. From being for a
few years "that dear old lady." she de
scends into that "horrid old woman."
This is the fate American girls are pre
paring for themselves by adopting Gallic
stupidity as to the heels and corsage. The
pathologic consequences of these perni
cious vulgarities afford the medical pro
fession the largest proportion of Its rev
enue.â Chicago Chronicle.
The Fate of American Girls.
CIRCUS STILL
DRAWS CROWDS
There is an international interest JuSt
now about the production'. : of Richard
Wagner's "Parsifal" in New York. Frau
Coslma Wagner secured attorneys to fight
Manager Helnrlch Conried of the Metro
politan/ Opera-house. The German press
and musical critics are bitterly opposed
to the performance of "Parsifal" in any
shape in America, but Conried has en
gaged Felix Mottl, the great Wagnerlan
conductor, to direct the programme.
All eyes of the musical world are cen
tered on New York, where "Parsifal" will
make its debut outside of Bayreuth. The
music Is the last-- of Wagner's and is said
to be the crowning effort of hte life. Fritz
Scheel will give selections from "Parsi
fal" at the symphony concert on Tuesday
afternoon next at the Grand Opera-house.
That it will prove a sensation is cer
tain and the music-lovers of the city will
be delighted to learn that they will hear
this music, even in advapce of New York.
In addition to this number the famous
Brahams No. 2 Symphony will be given
by urgent request of many who heard
the symphony at the last concert. I There
will also be "The Midsummer Night's
Dream" from Mendelssohn and a num
ber of surprises that Scheel has in store
for the patrons of these exceptional con
certs. Handel's Grand Concerto is among
the number. Seats are on sale at Sher

ROBBED AFTER A NIGHT j
OF DISSIPATION IS OVER
Antone Sweeney, a saloon-keeper,
whose place of business Is at 713 Brannan
street, went out on a lark with Joseph
Qulnlan. Joseph Leady and Dick Austedt,
three Mission hoodlums, Friday night.
The toughs succeeded in getting Sweeney
drunk and took him to his room about
midnight." When he was stowed away
safely In bed the trio went through his
clothes and took $145 from his pockets.
Then they locked the door and escaped.
Yesterday Detectives Regan and O'Con
nell were detailed on the case, and after
a short Investigation they placed the
saloonkeeper three companions under
arrest. Sweeney went to the Central Po
lice Station last night and positively iden
tified the men. When asked to make a
complaint he refused for some reason that
puzzles the police and Captain Martin
was obliged to turn the prisoners loose.

A young man in his shirt sleeves and a
straw hat was observed, one of the hot
test afternoons this week, wheeling a
baby carriage backward and forward In
front of one of the small houses In the
vicinity of Fairmount Park. Ha appear
ed hot, but happy.
"My dear." came a voice from ona Â«f
the upper windows of the house.
"Let me alone, can't you," he called
back, and went on wheeling and mopping
his face.
An hour later the same voica cama from
the window In earnest and pleading tones
"George dear!"
' ..ell, what on earth do you want?" hÂ«
asked. "Have the water pipes burst?"
"No, George dear, but you have toeen
wheeling Anna's doll all tho afternoon: Is
It not time for baby to hava a turn?"â

"When the fire was discovered .in the
shop the department responded, and' in
one corner of the room a small quantity
of rags soaked in coal oil was discovered.
No sooner had the first blaze been extin
guished when a second fire broke out in
an adjoining room and another bundle of
rags saturated with coal oil was found
there.
The matter was immediately reported
to Fire Marshal Towe and ho began an
Investigation. He learned that Gularte
had his furniture insured for $300 and that
he was to have vacated the premises to
day. This evidence, in connection with
the finding of the oil-soaked rags in the
place, convinced Marshal Towe that
everything was not all right, so he had
the barber arrested and locked up pend
ing an investigation.

; : The delegation recommended the re
nominatlon of Edward J* Smith as Tax
Collector and indorsed the candidacy of
former State Senator Thomas C.'Maher
for Public Administrator.' The delegation
also recommended the candidacy of Harry
Baehr for Auditor.
The delegates to the Republican munici
pal convention from the Thirty-fifth As
sembly District; . United Republican
League, held a meeting last Friday even
ing and elected John D. Daly chairman
and H. N. Hall secretary^
. The Republican convention will be held
on Tuesday evening in the Alhambra The
ater.
Throughout the meeting a great deal of
enthusiasm was shown. ' Every delegate
favored a fight on the floor of the conven
tion. The "Horse and Carts" boast of
possessing all the orators.
When the convention is opened to-mor
row night in Native Son's Hall the first
fight will be for chairman. The conven
tion will effect temporary organization.
The various committees will be appointed
and an adjournment will be taken until
Wednesday night. On that evening
Franklin K. Lane will be nominated for
Mayor. It Is understood that all the
Democratic Supervisors on the present
board will be renominated.
That there will be strong opposition to
the Democratic County Committee at the
municipal convention to-morrow evening
Is evidenced by the organization of the
minority, which consists of the "Horse
and Carts" and Mahoney factions. There
was a lively meeting of these factions last
night in the California Hotel. More than
100 | delegates to the convention attended
and voted to give the McNab forces a
battle from start to finish. Their motto
will be "No surrender and no com
promise."
James H. O'Brien presided over the
meeting. There were full delegations
from the Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh,
Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth,
Forty-first, Forty-second and Forty-third
Assembly districts and a part of the del
egation .from the Forty-fifth Assembly
District. The majority owe allegiance to
the "Horse and Carts," but a number of
Mahoney's crowd were present.
j O'Brien stated tfiat he had been advised
to call a meeting of a few delegates from
each district, but decided to have a meet-
Ing of all the delegates. He informed
those present that it was the purpose of
the meeting to map out a plan of cam
paign to be followed in the contention.
There was a general discussion of the best
methods to Dursue and it was eventually
decided that a committee of eight, com
posed of district chairmen, be appointed
to draft a platform to be presented to the
convention and also act as a "steering"
committee.
Joseph E. O'Donnell's candidacy for
chairman of the convention will be advo
cated by the minority. He will be op
posed by Thomas W. Illckey, the choice
of the County Committee. The minority
cares not whether McNab has the votes.
They intend to show him that he is not
to control the convention. This will be
the first fight for the organization.
Clarence D. Clough and Louis Hirsch
will be nominated as secretaries of the
convention and Morris J. Tyson will be
nominated for assistant secretary.
In meeting th^varlous heads of the de
partments the Assistant Secretary ex
plained that ho was'anxious to secure as
much Information as possible So that he
might be In a position to thoroughly un
derstand various questions that would
come before him in the future at Wash
ington. â¢ '
At noon the Assistant Secretary was the
guest of the Union- League Club at a
luncheon given In its rooms at the Pal
ace. There were about twenty members
present and President George Plppy pre
sided. To-day Henry Crocker will give
the Secretary and his party a ride
through Golden Gate Park to the ocean
beach, where the members will be re
ceived by Major Blakeney of the United
States life-saving station, who has ar
ranged for an exhibition of tho life-saving
crews in the .waters off the west shore of
the park. On the return trip the party
will be driven through the more interest
ing parts of* the city.
This evening Secretary Armstrong, ac
companied by Collector Stranahan o<- the
port of New York, Assistant United
States Treasurer Hamilton Fish and
Hamilton Fish Jr., will depart for the
East.
The visitors will travel in the private
car of President. Fish of the Illinois Cen
tral Railroad Company and will go East

Tfie Assistant Secretary also visited the
sub-Treasury and the Mint during the
day and at 'each place he insDected the
buildings from top to bottom and sought
much Information.
The Assistant Secretary put In a busy
day yesterday. He was an eafly riser
and after breakfast visited tha Custom
house and Appraiser's building. Acting
Collector of the Port W. B. Hamilton and
Surveyor of the Port J. Spear Jr. were
his guides and the Washington official was
shown the complete workings of the de
partment. "He was keenly interested In

John Krelss, a saloon Keeper at 616
Montgomery street, discovered his bar
tender, Arthur M. Bingham, in tne act of
taking money from the till last night.
When Krelss ordered his employe to leave
the place the latter became abusive and
struck Krelss on the jaw. Krelss started
to return the .blow and two of his friends
seized him urging him not to quarrel.
%hlle the Baloonman wag thus handi
capped. Bingham brushed his hand over
the. sideboard and dashed bottles and
glassware to the floor. In this act he
cut his hand severely and caused damage
amounting to about $150. He was treated
at the Central Emergency Hospital and
was later booked on a charge of battery
at the Central Police Station by Detec

How to Carry a Cat.
"Yes, I think It's the best way to carry
a cat, and I've tried them all," replied the
woman In the railroad station who had a
cat In a gingham bag, the feline's head
being out of the openlnp. which was care
fully drawn up around its neck lest it es
cape. "A pet cat feels very lonely in a
hamper. In this bag. you see. the cat
feels me all the time, as I carry him In my
arms, and he knows he Is not deserted.
If he had not traveled with me up and
down to the seashore for years I shouldn't
have as much confidence in him, and cer
tainly wouldn't allow his head out now
for" a breath of fresh air.
"I .wouldn't even trust him If he could
get one paw out, for he naturally has the
scary-cat nature and might fly before he
realized there was no danger. As a mat
ter of fact, he's a bit intoxicated. Two
hours before starting I put a bunch of
flagrant catnip in the bag and didn't let
him .inside until he was crazy over It.
When I did he scurried in with a rush,
and that saved him the fright ; he'd have
felt at being put in against his will. When
we get to our cottage I simply put a bit
of catnip on- his cushion and he knows he
is at home."â Philadelphia Record.

Senator Mitchell was out of the Senate
from 1897 to 1901, having lost his seat |
largely by' reason of his advocacy of theA
free coinage of silver. The Legislature]
elected In 1898 was so everwhclmingly 1
against him that he would not permit his 1
name to be used as a candidate. Even his
friends believed that Senator Mitchell
had been permanently retired to private
life, and it is we'.l known that his 'return
to the Senate came about through acci
dent and the complete, change of heart
experienced by the gold standard wing of
the Republican party, which had pre
viously prevented his return to the Senate
and carried election of 1898 in direct
opposition to him. However, upon his re
turn to the Senate the Senator, being
popular with the national administration
and knowing how to use this influence
effectively, succeeded in controlling the
entire Federal patronage of the State,
and by its judicious use greatly strength
ened himself politically.
The present city government of Port
land is indirectly but largely the out
growth of the political turnover which
placed Mitchell in the saddle in 1900. This
municipal administration is looked upon as
a failure, and the unsatisfactory local
conditions are charged to Senator Mitchell
and his faction. The prediction's freely
made that the Simon people who were
displaced to make room for Mitchell will
again be placed in â¢ control of affairs as
the outcome of: the next election. There
is no doubt that Senator Mitchell is very
greatly concerned over the situation, and
he has much reason to be so^ Unless all
signs fail there will be a complete over
turning of political conditions, and in the
upheaval that seems imminent the Sen
ator will very possibly be compelled to sea
another invested with the Uoga he lias
worn so long and is so lotn to part with. '
Under these circumstances the recent j
appointement of E. W. Davis and the j
turning down of J. W. Knowles for reg- Â¦Â¦
inter of the La Grande land office has
been a severe blow to Senator Mitchell j
and has caused much uneasiness among 1
his friends. The Senator's strongest card j
was his supposed influence with the Pres
ident in the matter of securing appoint- i
ments for his supporters. His failure to j
obtain the appointment of Knowles, back- I
ed as he was by the 'unanimous recom- |
mendation of the entire Congressional del- 1
egation of this State, was followed by the
assertion that Senator Mitchell would en- j
deavor to defeat the confirmation of Da
vis, the President's appointee, in the Sen
ate. This put the Mitchell faction in the
very attitude of opposition to the national
administration which they had previously
been urging as an argument why the Si
mon people should not be supported at 1
the soils. 1
The main issue in Oregon, statements
of political leaders to ths contrary not
withstanding, is who shall be elected
United States Senator in- 1907 to succeed
Mitchell. And to this single end-Â«ll the
energies of both the old Mitchell machine
and the new organization which Senator
Simon is now constructing are being bent.
The Legislature that will be elected
next June 'will not choose a Senator, nor |
are there any important State offices to
be filled, yet the battle. for supremacy at |
that election promises "to be sharp and:
tierce, and at this early date is already j
beginning to show itself. There will be !
Jifteen State Senators elected, who will i.
hold over and participate in the election
or Senator Mitchell's successor. Of these ;
fifteen State Senators five come from !
Multnomah, the banner Republican coun
ty of the State and the real batt'.e ground
of the contest. It goes without saying
that Senator Mitchell desire^ to be re- j
elected, and the personnel of the State
Senate to be re-elected gives the distin- j
guished, Senator much concern. , It will be j
Remembered that Senator Mitchell owes |
his present seat in r the Senate to the votes
of Democrats, Populists and those Re
publicans who united to defeat v the Re
publican caucus nominee for Senator In
the Legislature of 1901.
SIMON FOBCES ACTIVE.
election in June and is thus
a forerunner of the Presidential
campaign gives unusual importance to
tha election. The feature of the contest
will be the' battle for supremacy between
the Simon Republicans and tho Mitchell
wing of the party, and while the Mitchell
people are In control of everything, in
cluding the Federal patronage of the
State, there are many Indications that
presage the return to power of the Simon
faction.
It will be remembered tnat on the ex
piration j of Senator Simon's term /last
March he deliberately accused President
Roosevelt of breaking a written promise
and produced thtf letter to prove his
charne. 'Phis incident was seized upon
by the Mitchell people, who thereafter re
ferred to the Simon wing as the "anti-ad
mlnlstratlon faction." Moreover, they an
nounced their Intention of making the
question of whether the administration
should be supported or not the main issue
in the coming campaign.

THÂ«= VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty:
Xearly everybody knows that charcoal Js the
FCTat and most efficient disinfectant and pur-
ifier in nature, but few. realize its value wlien
taken into the human system for the same
clf-ansinj. purpose. .' .^ '
Charcoal ia a remedy that the more you take
.of it the better; it isfnot a drug at all. but
elmply absorbs the gaees and impurities always
present In the etomach and Intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smoking,
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
complexion. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which collect
in the stomach and bowels; it disinfects the
mouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one form or an-
; other, b-jt probably the best charcoal and the
j most for the money is in Stuart's Absorbent
j Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
j dertd Willow charcoal, and other harmless an.
tlee'ptlc* In Â«ablet form or rather In the form
of large pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed with honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will socn
tell m a much improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of It Is that
no possible " harm can result from their con-
tinutd use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of the bene-
fits or charcoal (.ays: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
eoibent Lozenges to all patients suffering from
gas in stomach and bowels, and to clear the '
complexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is greatly bene-
fited by the dally use of them; they cost but
twenty-five cents a box at drug stors, and al-
ihouKh In Mme sens* a patent preparation, yet
I belie\e I get more and better charcoal In
Btuart'8 Absorbent'l-ozenges than in ' any of
tbe ordinary charcoal tablets." I

utuae of the California delegation on tho
subject of irrigation. " . . '.."'
It developed ! from , the discussion that
there exists amoung the California dele
gation strong opposition to the - national
irrigation law known . as the Newlands
bill. The delegation appeared to be of the
belief that while the national Irrigation
law may be a good thing for . the arid
States of Nevada, Utah and Arizona. It
was not a good thing for California, since
it would .prevent Independent irrigation
operations by this State. It Is claimed
that the lands In California which need
Irrigation are not strictly arid lands, as
understood by the Newlands act, and that
the State should not have to wait for tlte
slow processes of the national Govern
ment* when it desires to establish irriga
tion works.

The rest of the company were all ex
ceptionally good In the roles they played.
Not a hitch marred the work of anv of
the company even though It wag a first
night performance. The stage effects are
far above the. ordinary and in fact the
whole production is so good that it would
be hard to improve.upon it. There is lit
tie doubt that it will prove popular as long
as it runs.
Barry Maxwell, as the minister, was a
show in himself ; and every time he came
on the stage, it was a signal for a mur
mur of applause and laughter. Cecil Mag
nus, who acted the part of the friend and
adviser of the leading man. had plenty to
do at all times and he did it well.
Then Alice Johnson more than pleased
in the rn'.e of the woman who was un
consciously breaking up a happy home.
She played well and was the recipient of
many ovations. Emile La Croix as tho
French count, was a wonder for making
trouble for everyone In the cast. He has
the French accent and the French ways
down to a nicety and the way he fussed
and fumed around was laughable in the
extreme.
"A Friend of the Family" was produced
at the California Theater last night for
the nnst time, and before the Initial act of
the clever comedy had been played, the
audience felt satisfied. The piece Is a
comedy that really makes one laugh and
the actors are all capable of catering to
the tastes of the theater goer, so there is
no reason why "A Friend of the Family"
will not become a genuine favorite before
It has been produced many times.
George W. Barnum, in the title role â
the man with all the troublesâ had a part
that is admirabli- suited to his taste.
From the moment he first made his ap
pearance till the curtain rajng down, he
kept the crowd in one round of laughter,
this by the unique way he tried to dodge
trouble, only to find more of It at every
turn.

"So far It has proved inadvisable to lm
:t>ort foresters from Europe. Tho Ameri
can forester has to be thoroughly ac
quainted with his country. He must be
cble to tell a man how much his forest
Is worth now and what it will bo worth
. in tyeotjr-flva years.
"The preservation, of our forest* de
â¢ ?>Â«nds more on private land owners than
on the Government because the bulk of
Â¦ forest development is at present in the
hands of private Individuals. The Gov
ernment has been greatly cramped in its
work through the lack of a sufficient
corps of foresters. The United States has
Sousd !t necessary to put its forest re
.eerves under the supervision of good men
and the different States must do the
same."
"A man may look forward to the mak
ing of a decent living but not a fortune
in tha profession of forestry. The ma
jority of those who have undertaken the
profession have dropped It because they
â¢ were not adequately prepared. A good
forester should be not only a scientific
nan but a practical logger.
"There should be a school of forestry on
this coast because the forest question
both here and In the Philippines Is com
ing to be of the greatest Importance.
Such a school should be post-graduate in
order to turn out the most thoroughly
â¢Â¦quipped men poselble. The field of for
'"-.'ry affords a great opportunity to young
Tr.en at the present time. Fifty foresters
la the field now could be of more service
than five hundred some years hence. In
ray opinion there is no question that
the demand for foresters will exceed the
supply for some time to come. We are
.now on the verge of popular approval of
Â¦ forestry and Interest la the problem of
forest preservation is bound to increase.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept 12.â
Glffard Plnchot, Chief of the United
States Bureau of Forestry, delivered a
lecture in the old chapel la?t night on
the subject, "Forestry as a Profession."
The epeaker etrongly urged young men
to take up forestry as a profession and
advocated the establishment of a school
of forestry on this coast.
The Idea has received consideration at
Stanford before by those Interested in
that line of scientlf.c work and It is un
<Jersteod that eventually such a depart
ment will be created In the university.
President Jordan said this morning that
vhile the matter had been considered by
the authorities, no step in that direction
Trould probably be taken by the Board of
Trustees until after the completion of all
the college building* at least. Plnchot

Holy Rosary Academy for two years. She
returned a few days ago and resumed her
studies for the present term. She attend
ed her classes until a few minutes of 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon, when she
laid by her books and notified the Sisters
that she was 18 years of age on- that day
and that she was going to leave the acad
emy. She said she Intended to go away
with a young man whom she had prom
ised to marry.
Her teachers remonstrated, but without
avail. As the young lady Â¦was of age and
accountable to no one for her actions, she
left the premises at once, and ion Main
street was Joined by a young man from
Sacramento named Jud Flint. - [.
Flint and Miss Carroll applied for and
obtained a marriage license in Sacramento
late in the afternoon and were married in
the evening.
The climax was not altogether unex
pected. The two had been sweethearts
for some time. The father of Miss Car
roll strongly objected to a marriage, at
least at present, and urged her to com
plete her education. He sent her to Holy
Rosary Academy, hoping that new asso
ciations and environments might change
her mind. The Sisters, were | fully ap
prised of the situation. She was obedient
to the wishes of her father and the au
thority of her teachers until the day she
arrived at a lawful age, when she could
assert her rights.
She is a beautiful and highly accom
plished young woman and has musical
talent of a high order. Young Flint is the
son of a prominent Sacramento farmer
and hopgrower. He is a promising young
athlete, has been frequently fengaged in
amateur football contests and! is well and
favorably known in Woodland.

"I regret that I cannot make public the
result of my investigations," he said,
"but the interest of justice demands the
utmost-' secrecy in order that those who
ere suspected of complicity In this sub
stitution business may not be forewarn
ed and d's-appear. I will present the mat
ter to the United States Grand Jury next

that this system of substitution has been

there are many Chinamen now In this

have been sent back."
"Do you intend to present to the Grand

"Undoubtedly," he replied.

The First Battalion of Artillery. Na
tional Guard of California, Major H. P.
Bush commanding, left the Ellis-street
armory on Admission day for a day's
drill and instruction with the high pres
sure guns at. the Presidio. The battalion
marched to the spot.
The command reported to Captain J. w.
Hinckley, Artillery Corps, United States
army, at 9 o'clock in the morning and it
was immediately ordered to "Battery
Slaughter" for instruction. Lieutenant G.
S Garber of the Artillery Corps. United
State's army, assisted in the instruction.
At the battery the command was in
structed In the nomenclature of the gun
and carriage, as well as mechanism, it
being the first time that the National
Guardsmen were at the eight-inch guns,
previous instruction having been given at
Battery Cranston, where there are ten
inch guns. Subsequently the command
was divided into three gun detachments,
with the usual details for observation,
range-flndlng, platting and ammunition.
Those who had not been previously in
structed were placed at gun 3, under com
mand of Lieutenant Garber. In a few
hours he had his detachment in such
shape that it could take observations,
make predictions and load and fire the
gun In three minutes.
The men worked very hard, being kept
at the guns continuously unu. 4 o'clock
in the afternoon with a short interval for
lunch, which was served at the emplace
ments so as to save time. The men
evinced much interest in and paid a great
deal of attention to the Instruction, al
though the day was very warm. They
practically put In the time usually allotted
to a three days' drill by the regulars.
The men of this battalion are deserving
of praise for their efforts to perfect them
selves in the branch Â¦ of the service to
which they have been assigned, .their ser
vice when at the guns being more oner
ous than that of the regulars, as they are
compelled, on account of the shortness of
the time they can remain at the guns, to
take advantage of every moment's in
struction.'
Captain Petty acted as battery officer,
with Captains Keealing and Grattan and
Lieutenants Varney and Knerr as range
officers. v.
Both Captain Hlnckley and Lieutenant
Garber expressed themselves as well
satisfied with the progress the men made
and are now- preparing plans for instruc
tion at the battalion armory, -to be fol
lowed by drill at the guns each month.
Captain .Thomas ; A. Neruey, command-
Ing the Naval Militia. of California, will
go on the retired list October 1. It is
probable that he will be succeeded by
Commander G. W. Bauer.

corroborates Gamble In every particular

been made on shipboard.
On September 4 Dong Poy, one of the
escapes, was remanded to the County
Jail at the request of his attorney, Frank
V. Bell, who made no attempt to establish
his client's right to remain, in this coun
try. Two months ago the cases of Lun

S. C. Doyle and William Galvin, who
give theiraoccupation. as switchmen, were
arrested yesterday morning by Policemen
McN'amara. and Clue and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses. They are two
of the men who have been collecting
money from merchants In this city and
Los Angeles for a "Mrs. Davis," whose
husband was alleged to have been killed
in a railroad accident. They had with
them. a circular letter, purporting to be
signed by the secretaries of the Switch
men's Union and the Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Engineers authorizing them to
collect subscriptions.
Two of the gang called upon Nathan,
Dohrmann & Co. some weeks ago asking
for a subscription, but F. W. Dohrmann
became suspicious and went to the tele
phone to notify the police. The men ran
away. Dohrmann made the matter pub
lic at the time, but the men continued to
solicit and receive subscriptions.
Last Thursday Doyle andGalvln made a
canvass of the Rialto building and one of
the subscribers there was L. L. Long, sec
retary of the Pacific Lumber Company.
He subsequently learned that the men
were frauds and made the fact known
throughout the building.
Yesterday morning Doyle and Galvin
ngaln visited the Rialto building, but they
soon nuspected that something was wrong
and left. The superintendent of the
building followed them till he met Police
men McN'amara and Clue on Third street.
He told the officers what the men had
been doing, and the policemen went after
them. Doyle and Galvin separated as
soon as they saw the officers were fol
lowing them, and ran. Doyle was cap
tured and taken to the City Prison, and
half an hour later Galvin was found hid
ing under a bed in the Revere House, on
Fourth street, near Mission.
The Supreme Court In a decision ren
dered yesterday eÂ«tablished the prece
dent that the Judge of a Superior Court
can punish for contempt a witness who
refuses to answer proper questions In the
taking of a deposition. It is declared fur
thermore that the Judge can impose an
adequate penalty Immediately without the
filing of a formal complaint. The point is
a new one in California jurisprudence and
in fact there are -no exactly analogous
cases in the court records of other States.
H. J. Crocker hid commenced an ac
tion in the court of which N. P. Conrey
was judge and the latter was taking a
deposition when the witness refused to
answer any questions relating to the mat
tr r in controversy. Plaintiffs demanded
that the man giving the deposition be pun
ished for contempt and compelled to an
swer proper and pertinent questions.
Judge Conrey held that he was not act
ing in an official capacity when taking
the deposition and Crocker's attorneys
petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ
of mandamus compelling the Judge to
punish the recalcitrant witness for con
tempt. ,
The last named tribunal has held recent
ly in the case of Burns vs. Superior Court
that a witness who refuses to answer
proper questions when giving a deposition
before a notary public may be punished
for contempt. In that case, the filing of
a formal complaint before a judicial offi
cer is necesary before the witness may
b* sent to jail.
The Supreme Court holds in the present
instance that a Superior Court Judge Is
acting in an official capacity when taking
a deposition and that there is no need
that he be appraised by affidavit of facts
of which he Is already cognizant but that
he chould fine the witness immediately
and send him to jail until he shall be
ready to answer proper questions.
The Supreme Court also decided that
Auditor Browning of Yo!o County must
draw salary warrants In favor W. A. An
drews, who is engaged in a legal fight
for the District Attorneyship of the coun
ty. Andrews received a certificate of elec
tion, but H. L. Huston, a rival candidate,
began a contest for the office. The Su
perior Court decided in favor of the con
testant and the case is now on appeal in
the Supreme Court.
Although it is cuite possible that An
drews be counted out. the court holds that
he has the right to collect the salary of
( the District Attorney since he has been
igiven a certificate of election and is dis
charging the duties of the office.

UNITED STATEd DISTRICT AT
TORNEY WOODWORTH and hia
assistants are making a searching
Inquiry into the circumstances
surrounding the substitution Fri
day of six decrepit Chinamen for six
young men who were ordered deported
on the steamer Gaello because they were
not entitled to land in this country. As
far as the Investigation had proceeded
yesterday, the indications were that a
conspiracy will be uncovered Involving
several officials and a number of outsiders
who are suspected of systematic substi
tution of Chinese ordered for deportation.
From 9 o'clock in the morning until r
o'clock In the afternoon the United States
District Attorney and his assistants, D.
E. ilcKinlay and B. J. Banning, were en
gaged In examining the six Chinamen who
were substituted somewhere between the
county jail and the steerage of the steam
er Gaelic, for a half dozen young China
men who had been denied admission to
the country. The examination was con
ducted wiUj_the utmost difficulty, as the
witnesses were not only unwilling to an
swer, but In the opinion of the officials
present, had been thoroughly coached for
Just such an emergency to disclose as lit
tle Information as possible.
MANY IMPLICATED.
Although United States District Attor
ney Woodworth refused to divulge any
thing regarding the nature of the devel
opments reached yesterday, it was learn
ed that sufficient information was gained
from the substitutes to connect directly
with the crime three white men and one
Chinaman. Who these are can only be
surmised, but the developments already
made public point to DeputyUnited States
Marshal W. P. Gamble, Hack Driver
Thomas Martin and an unknown white
man, and Tom Yung, a Chinese meVchant
having a store at &56 Dupont street.
Suspicion of guilt does not stop here.
The names of George A. McGowan, Al
fred Worley and Frank V. Bell, who* have
been doing a remarkably large business
on behaif of Chinese ordered to be de
ported, are being connected in an un
pleasant manner with the present case.
In addition there is a decided clash be
tween the offices of the United States
Marshal and the Chinese Inspection Bu
reau and as a result there are undercur
rents of counter charges that may lead to
disclosures that will seriously compromise
these two departments.
Outside of the United States Marshal's
office the complicity of Gamble in the
substitution proceedings is generally re
garded by officials as established. The
Chinese Inspectors, who decline to talk
for publication, are a unit in declaring
his guilt. The United States District At
torney's office seems to share this belief.
His exculpation must of* necessity in
volve Chinese and Custom-house inspec
tors who were on the Gaelic when he de
livered the six Chinamen.
SHINE SUPPORTS GAMBLE.
On the other hand United States Mar
shal ' John H. Shine is positive that his
subordinate is entirely guiltless. He says
he has known him for more than thirty
years and he has absolute confidence in
his integrity. He first appointed Gamble a
bailiff in 1899 and on January 9, 1901, made
him a Deputy United States Marshal.
Previous to that time Gamble had been
in the butcher business in Modesto and
enjoys a splendid reputation there. Mar
shal Shine was present during the exam
ination of the six Chinamen yesterday and
stated at its conclusion that in his opinion
there was nothing developed that would
connect Gamble with the substitution. He
said that five of the Chinamen had failed
totally to Identify Gamble as the man
who had conducted them from Chinatown
and the sixth had made an identification
in such an unsatisfactory manner as to
convince him that it was- false.
GAMBLE'S STATEMENT.
Gamble does not bear the appearance of
a guilty man. He discusses his connec
tion with the case . freely but without
making any direct accusations against
anyone for the substitution. He sticks to
the story he told In the first place, main
taining unflinchingly that the men he se
cured at the County Jail were the men he
delivered to the steward of the steamer.
He admits that the six men taken from
the Gaelic are not the men ordered de
ported, whom he claims to have delivered.
"What is your explanation for this sub
stitution?" he was asked. â¢
"There is only one," he said,. "and that
is that the six men now in custody were
substituted on board the ship."
When ' it was suggested that Chinese
inspectors were present and allowed no
Chinamen to land he ansjwered that there
were several gangplanks and it was pos
sible that the Inspectors had been Â¦ a lit
tle lax In watching them all. He said
the steward of the vessel merely locked
the Chinamen up and went about' his
other duties and it was possible for some
one with duplicate keys to release them.
CONTBADICT DEPUTY.*
Contradicting Gamble are Inspector of
Customs Joseph Wilson, several employes
of the Pacific Mail Company and a watch
man at the gangplank of the Gaelic, in
addition to Steerage Steward Leslie's
written statement taken before his de
parture. . All those named declare that
the six men now being held are the Iden
tical ones delivered at . the steamer by
Gamble. It was remarked at the time
he brought them that the men were un
usually old to have come from China
only a few months before. Inspector Wil
son says that Gamble started to go away
after turning the men over to Steward
Leslie and was called back by him with
the advice that he had better. aee his men
locked up. Gamble then , went to â¢ the
steerage and watched the steward put the
men under lock and key. ....
It required the services of three In
terpreters to secure connected stories
from the .six substitutes during the ex
amination by . District 'Attorney Wood
worth. First Interpreter Gubbins was
tried, but failed to secure any Informa
tion from Ah Gat, an old Chinaman, who
admits having been in this country for
more than forty years. Then D. D. Jones;
the regular interpreter attached j to - the
United States District Attorney's office,
was given a chance and failed likewise.
Finally Dr. J. E. Gardiner,, the Chinese
inspector, was called In and he succeeded
in drawing forth whatever information
was obtained from . the sextet.
TELL SAME STOEY.
, The witnesses all told practically the
same story. They said that they went
to the store of Tom Yung, where they
were told they could return to , China
without paying fare and would receive a
bonus provided they followed Instruc
tions. Subsequently they were given $30
by Tom Yung and told to' be "at certain
localities in Chinatown on the morning
of September .11. -They were picked up
one by one by a white man whom they
describe as being thin, with a light mus
tache and a few tufts of hair on his
chin. They were taken first to a' "big,
red building," where they were escorted
up two or three flights of stairs" and
locked in a room. A little later they were
released and taken in a hack to the Pa
cific Mail Dock_ and put aboard . the ship.
Gamble was called In for Identification
and all but one said he was not the man
.who brought them from Chinatown.. This
one said he thought he' was the man,' but
the identification was made In such a way
as to leave a doubt as to whether he
meant that Gamble was the, man 'who
took him. to the dock or who escorted him
from Ctlnatown.
There were other revelations made dur
lng'the examination that are regarded as
import ant by the officials Â¦ engaged In it
ar,d which are said to implicate others
in : the substitution scheme, but these are
being seduously ' kept secret.

Chief of the United States Bureau of
Forestry Gifford Pinchot was then intro
duced. He said in part:-
OUGHT TO. BE SAVED.
"When I first saw the forest of Mount
Tamalpais it occurred to me at once that
it ought to be saved.* Although I have
been up the mountain but twice or three
times I am convinced that it should be
used by every one and not be enjoyed
by a few individual owners. All great
cities are now purchasing parks and for
ests for the recreation of the residents of
these big cities. Forest parks are, in my
opinion, the best of all parks. I know a
little town In Missouri which recently
purchased a small forest that would not
for a moment compare -with the Tamal
pais reserve, yet every Sunday you* can
find the place thronged all day with chil
dren and men with their wives getting a
little taste of nature. Vienna, Paris and
the bis cities all over the world have pur
chased forest parks, but I cannot recall
one park which in my opinion can com
pare with the forest which you are now
contemplating buying.
"A good forest conducted in a scientific
manner costs nothing. The trees are
growing all the time and the selling- of
the timber alone will pay all the neces
sary cost of guarding the park. You have
a euperb opportunity and you should
avail yourself of the chance to buy this
property. . The question comes up. How is
this park to be obtained? It is useless to
ask the United States Government to buy
it; it is purely a State affair. Congress
would not be willing and you must re
member that the United States has al
ready been asked to buy the Calaveraa
grove. The only way for you to do It Is
to purchase the property by Individual
enterprise and public spirit.
GIVE IT- TO TTNCLE SAM.
"As a private citizen, I think that the
United States would accept the property
should you purchase It and donate it to
the Government. Uncle Sam would then
take it under his care and jruard it in
every possible way so that it could be
used by the people."
President David > Starr Jordan waa the
next speaker. He said:
"I am very glad to be here and to bear
witness this ' afternoon. Tou ought to
have the park and I hope you will get it.
You know all about it â perhaps a great
deal more than I do, but those of you
who don't only have to climb up back of
this mountain and you can get an idea
what a beautiful park it can make.
"Time changes everything, even timber.
I remember when I was a boy back in
New York how people uged to look upon
forests, or rather they called them woods
in those days, with horror. The forests
used to cause fires, and were* the place
for harboring wild animals which used to
come down and kill the sheep. The great
thing in those days was to get rid of the
forests as fast as possible. Then people
would cut down the trees to sell the lum
ber for firewood and to improve their
land.â 'They could not understand that
their land was worth less after the timber
ONE of the most Important and
far-reaching forestry movements
yet inaugurated in California
pained impetus at Ross Valley yesterday.
At the invitation of the Lagunitas Club
ar.d the. Tamalpais Forestry Association
there vr&s a meeting at the club grounds
ar.d plans were discussed for the purchase
cf a large forest reserve on Mount Tamal
pais.
Distinguished advocates of forest pres
ervation were present ar.d made speeches.
Cifford Pinchot. chief of the United States
.Bureau of Forestry^ President David
fctarr Jordan of Stanford and William
Kent, a tireless advocate of the park,
were the principal orators of the occa
sion. They Ehowed the advantages of
preserving the scenic gTandeur and
primeval freshness of the â¢woodlands of
the beautiful mountain.
A number of San Franciscans attended
the meeting and the city delegation was
met by a reception committee, most of
them \roraen of the Lagrunitas Club.
The conference was held at the tennis
court and by 3:30 o'clock the audience was
comfortably seated on benches and camp
Ftools. William Kent, a prominent advo
cate of the park, was chairman. As one
of the fathers of the undertaking he felt
that an explanation was due and he said
In part:
"By the coiirtesy of the Lagunitas
Country Club and under the auspices of
the Tamalpais Forestry Association, we
are met to inaugurate a great work.
NATCKE CALLS MEN.
"Whatever occupation man may follow,
there Is. planted within him a need of
nature, calling gently to him at times to
come and enjoy, imperiously commanding
et other times to eeek recuperation and
ttrength. From the bountiful mother
man is never weaned, and the attempt In
crowded cities means but physical, moral
and civic degradation.
"It 1* pitiful to see hundreds dragging
their way along the confines of the county
road, warned on every side of awful
penalties at the hands of stern Justice if
they cross the .'ence In trespass. But we
have our side of the story. We have
officiated nights and Sundays and many
an Independence day In endeavoring to
put out fires that the heedless have light
ed. Our trees are hacked, our flowers
picked, and stray rifle balls and deer
liounds too 6eldom make the proper con
nection. The less we flght people the
more we fight fire, hence our apparent
hostility to what Is a public need.
"It is because our ' uninvited guests
â¢with traditions running back to eand lots
and vigilance committees make the same
old mistake of confusing anarchy with
Independence, license with liberty, and
all of us are to blame.
BEAES ABE PETS.
"The history Â°* Yellowstone Park shows
how easily people may be trained to de
cency In their treatment of nature. Even
the bears of Yellowstone Park are re
parded as pets. When the competitive
motive la removed there comes a higher
enjoyment In watching wild things than
in destroying them.
â¢â¢I would so very far with peaa in my
Â«hoes to see an inch or two of bayonet
applied to some vandals I have met, but
I am cure that 90 per cent of the now
heedless public would appreciate and en
joy the application to the other fellow.
That other fellow would be eliminated by
the mere presence cf authority.
"That authority for many reasons
:-;hould be the authority of the national
Government.
"First and foremost, because the park
Â¦we are going to Â«ecure Is a forest park
and because under the wise and devoted
service of our distinguished guest, Mr.
Iinchot, the nation Is developing a mag
nincent bureau of forestry. In connec
tion with the regular work of this bureau
there is an urgent call for our great uni
versities to rear up practical foresters,
and in ell the State of California there is
po one place where the problems of tree
culture and water conservation can be so
advantageously studied as on Mount Tam
alpais.
PARK SCHEME GOOD.
"Subdivision, building of houses and or
dinary so-called suburban improvements
tin Mount Tamalpais Â¦will do more to ruin
Marin County than any other catastrophe
'ma^inable. A broad, comprehensive park
scheme will be of Incalculable financial
benefit. - v
"I have said enough. I could say more
but what Is the use? Every motive im
pels toward this consummation. I have
lalked this plan in general for years; I
have talked it in detail for weeks. I have
never found an objection to it. If I were

TION AND THEIR INVITED GUESTS.
Freel got a description of Nolan from
the janitor and arrested him on Friday,
placing him in the tanks for further de
velopments. He says that Nolan served
a term in New York. Treadwell says hÂ»
â¢will defend Nolan if he returns the dia
mond cuff buttons.
John Patrick Nolan, a young man from
New York, is locked up In "the tanks" at
the City Prison, and Just how many
charges of burglary will be booked agaln.st
him the police do not know. They have
not concluded their investigation.
On Tuesday night Nolan visited the of
fices in th'e building- on the southwest cor
ner- of Sacramento and Kearny streets.
While In tha office of A. B. Tread well, at
torney, the janitor saw him and asked
him what he was doing there. He replied
that a . friend had been arrested and he
had called to see Treadwell about bailing
him out. The janitor noticed that a glass
case where Treadwell kept a lot of curloa
had been opened, and he charged Nolan
with being up to some mischief.
Nolan burst Into tears and said: "Don't
let the police get me. My parents ara
both sick, and as I can't get any work
I am forced to steal to keep them from
starving. Think what you would do it
you were in my place."
M.U the time he was talking the tears
were running down his cheeks and his
sebs were heartrending. The Janitor was
so affected that his tears began to flow,
and in a choking voice he told Nolan to
; go away and try to lead an honest life.
Wednesday was a holiday,' and when
Treadwell vent to his office on Thursday
morning he discovered that most of tha
curios had been taken from the case, and
also a pair of diamond cuff buttons that
he had put there temporarily. He values
the stolen curios at $100. He notified the
police and Detective Freel was detailed
on the case. Freel discovered that the
doors of most of the offices In the building
had been forced open. In the office of tha
Typographical Union the secretary's deslc
had been broken open and Â£ which he had
failed to take away with him on Tuesday
night had been stolen. Nothing of value
was taken from any of the other offices
except Treadwell's.

It the charge against . Erwin Is made to
stick, then each t and every one of the
stockholders ' in the Postal , Device and
Improvement Company is equally, culp
able,with him, for. he has had no more
complicity In the alleged frauds than the
othe/s." -
' Thought the news Â¦ comes from ..Wash

dismissed from the position of , assistant
superintendent of special delivery of San
Francisco,,-, the formal announcement of
such action has not .yet reached him and
yesterday he waa-at his desk in the Ferry
building./ -When - Interviewed .concerning
the measures he has taken to acquit him
self of -the charge brought' against him,
he said: S'? .. "Â¦'.'' .
When seen yesterday, Attorney Knight
outlined the legal policy which he will fol
low in the 1 case and gave, some strong
opinions upon the injustice of the charge
as he considered It. He said:
"It Is shockingâ this fllingof an'indict
ment against a man who is entirely inno
cent. Of course, Mr. Erwin can clear
himself without a shadow of doubt, but
the very fact that he should have been
under suspicion Â¦works a hardship on a
man whose Integrity and faithfulness to
duty have been unlmpeached heretofore.
"Erv/ln's only connection with the Pos
tal Device and Improvement Company
upon Â¦which there can be possibly based
a charge of fraud was the trip which he
took to Washington with Daniel S. Rich
ardson, superintendent of the local post
office. At that time he had . an Interest
in the postal box device as part inventor
of it and merely Â¦went to the capital to
bring this contrivance before the eyes of
the department as a public benefit. He
exhibited j it. and praised it with an en
thusiasm born of his part in its invention,
but he had absolutely no. knowledge of
or. connection with the arranging of con
tracts, with the Government there or. the
distribution , and disposal of stocks here.
"The Government has tried to make this
postofnee Investigation far reaching, but
that Is no excuse for 'involving . In it a
manifestly ' Innocent man. George W.
Beavers and August W. Machen undoubt
edly are Justly Indicted; I believe that
there Is a guilty party in the San Fran
cisco postoffice, but Erwin Is certainly not
the 'Â» man - and should not be made the
scapegoat.
WILL BE CLEARED HEBE.
According to legal . procedure, the first
step taken after the arrival of a certified
copy of the indictment will be for United
States District Attorney Marshall B.
Woodsworth to file a- complaint before
United States, Court Commissioner Hea
cock. It will be Heacock's duty then to
review the allegations In the instrument,
calling witnesses both for the Govern
ment and for Erwin to testify upon the
facts of the case. Erwin's attorney hopes
to bring such conclusive testimony before
the Commissioner's court that the Com
missioner will see fit to recommend to. the
committing magistrate that he withRold
an order of removal and thus, unless Er
win voluntarily went before the court at
Washington, he would be cleared of the
crime imputed against him. - ... .
KNIGHT OUTLINES DEFENSE
Attorney Samuel Knight of the firm of
Page, McCutcheon, Harding & Knight,

the charge brough against him by the

to have himself cleared by testimony giv
en before the United States Court Com

Mrs. Harris herself told her story of ag
grievement before the court and Mrs. An

defendant, also testified. The case will
be resumed on September 25. Meanwhile
Mrs. Harris lias Instituted civil suits to
recover $20,000. apiece from Williams and
and Mrs. Thatcher in Department 3 of the
Superior Court.
At the Instance of the attorney for the
defense, two photographs of Mrs. Thatch

Williamsâ were produced to show the al
leged shocking effects of Mrs. Harris'
treatment. One had been retouched by
the photographer, so as to make the sub

were used to exemplify the "before and
after taking" mode of advertising, claimed
to be used by Williams.

Mrs. That,cher stated that when she
went to Mrs. Harris she had some freckles
and a few wrinkles which marred the
ethereal beauty of her countenance, but
when she had received two i treatments of
acid rubbed in with a brush at the hands
of the Psyche manufacturer she still had
the wrinkles and freckles, plus a fiery red
tint and boils and pimples various.
"Dr. L. 'Williamsâ Dear Sir: I wish to
testify that I came to you with a face
covered with pimples and small boils and
so frightfully red that I could not appear
on the street without a double veil. The
above defects were caused by a treatment
I had taken from M. Ella Harris. I went
to her to have a few wrinkles and
freckles removed. I still had the wrinkles
.when I finished with her treatment and
as time went on my face became worse
and I concluded to consult Dr. Williams
(yourself). I am happy to say that you
have entirely cured the boils and pimples
and the redness is changed to fairness.
My skin is smooth and free from all
roughness. I remain, yours gratefully,
"MISS HAMILTON."
"P. S.â If this letter would be of any use
to you to show it, pray do so.
Miss Hamilton, the author of the trou

Margaret Thatcher, her present name,
whlfch through modesty had been kept
from the eyes of the world In the com
mendatory epistle, she took the stand to
testify; to the 'marvel of how under the

Chetwood, Luce and Sutton each put
up In proportion to his financial strength
and three or four score intimate friends
and friends of Intimate friends were let
in on ; the ground floor. The schooner
Herman ids chartered and as she blew
through the Golden Gate Captain James
Brown shook hands with his shipmates
and told them that within sixty days all
aboard the Herman would ,be. money
kings.
The Herman failed to clear when she
left this port and. when she reached Hon
olulu, where Captain Brown decided to
call. Collector of the Port Stackable fined
the skipper 5100 for his omission. It was
at Honolulu that the trouble began. Cap
tain Brown, In spite of the fact that he
had lived his allotted span of three score
years and ten, proved a pretty young
sort of old fellow and a spender of liberal
tastes. He had such a good time In Hon
olulu that he forgot to pay the bills for
stuff supplied the schooner and appeared
to have lost all interest In the treasure.
His shipmates remonstrated and after a
bitter quarrel Sutton, Chetwood and Dr.
Luce returned to San Francisco by steam
ship. With Frank Sharratt and John
Hoffman, also stockholders, Brown left
Honolulu In the Herman. He cleared for
Sydney, but put into Apia, where there
was more trouble. The United Statea
Consul at the Samoan port refused to
permit the "Herman's departure, j By this
time Sharratt and Hoffman lost faith in
the enterprise, abandoned the trip and
WOULD ALL BE RICH.
Luce listened and was lost. He wrote
to a friend, G. W. Button, a retired con
tractor, who was living quietly at .New
Rochelle, 'N. Y. J. Chetwood, an attor
ney of this city, was attracted by the
glitter ahd as the leaven of the old man's
tale began to work the circle of believers
in Its truth gradually widened. When
Captain Brown suggested that he was
feeling restless and would just as soon
show a few particular friends where the
treasure was located the proposition to
float a company was speedily put into
execution.
After the treasure had been burled
something happened. When it had ceased
happening Captain James Brown was the
sole survivor of the expedition and the
only man on earth who knew the last
resting place of the pirate's booty.
Whether the sight of the treasure inspired
his companions with a fighting frenzy, In
which the story of the Kilkenny cats was
duplicated; whether the sight of so much
wealth caused them to die from heart
disease, or whether the sturdy young
Erown played Samson and single handed
made all the others bite the dust, "Captain
Brown, â¢will not ! vouchsafe to explain.
Neither will he reveal how that 14-year
old boy got away from the island nor how
he kept record of its location.
It was this story told in a San Fran
cisco hotel five years ago that led to the
formation of the Herman treasure hunt
ing expedition. The narrator was Cap
tain James Brown. His audience includ
ed Dr. O. D. Luce, a local dentist, who
now resides at 290C Bush street, but who
then was a guest at the hotel that shel
tered Brown.
ONLY BROWN SURVIVES.
It had been buried In 1S22. It was ex
humed by the skipper of the Black Witch
in 1845. Instead of carrying the treasure
to civilization, however, the captain of
the Black Witch steered a course for
another South Sea island and there
planted his rich find. From this point
Captain Brown's story calls for the aid
of a little faith. â¢ .
ing of numerous South American cities.
The Jewels of grand ladies, the golden
service of palace and cathedral, the treas
ures of town and city, were all pourad Into
that pirate hiding place awaiting the day
when the pirate chief cried "enough" and
the grand distribution was made.
Bullets, ropes, unstable planks and other
aids to exit caused the passing of the
pirates before the spoils could be divided.
The captain of the Black Witch was alone
in possession of the secret and Captain
James Brown, late of the schooner Her
man, was with him when he visited the
treasure island. It was on the island of
Cocos, says Captain Brown, and the
treasure was located with little difficulty.
The Herman, although the property of
the stockholders, stood in Brown's name
and at the Australian port the captain
offered her for sale. With the aid of in
junctions and the American Consul he
was prevented from disposing of the ves
sel. Ho was deposed from the command,
which was turned over to Sutton, by this
time a pretty fair navigator. Luce re
jofned the party at Sydney.
Brown promised to beÂ» good, agreed to
travel as a passenger and to show them
where the treasure was located. Sail was
set and a course steered in accordance
with Brown's directions. The Island was
never sighted, however, the ancient mari
ner doling out excuse after excuse, until
all hands beg^in to find the lack of logic
in the old man's dream.
Many islands were visited. Promises
were made and broken. The worm turned
when the Herman entered the harbor of
Papeete. The disillusioned treasure seek
ers told their troubles to United States
Consul Doty, who gave them permission
to sell the schooner. Having no-jufisdic
tion over the case as far as the more se
rious charges against Brown were con
cerned, he tried him on a charge of abus
ing a Japanese -steward, ordered him sent
home as a prisoner on the .Mariposa and
sent to United States District Attorney
Woodworth a copy of the depositions
taken before him with the request that a
warrant be issued for Brown's arrest.
How that failed has been told. Brown
declares that the treasure exists and that
he will return to Auburn, R. I., and there
organize another party. Luce, Chetwood
and Sutton, who returned with Brown on
the Mariposa, express their intention of
securing the old man's arrest on charges
varying from battery to embezzjement
and prosecuting them to the bitter end.
Brown says he does not care and do,es
not look as if he did. He expressed his
opinion of his former shipmates at the
foot of the Mariposa's gangway and once
more, as he ended the audience he grant
ed to a collection of reporters, policemen
and dock officials, his voice rolled out its
former oracular apostrophe: â¢â¢Â¦
"Fools."

The modifications as recommended by
the City Engineer were adopted by the
committee and ordered Incorporated In
the ordinance granting the proposed fran
chise, the representatives of the Southern
and "Western Pacific companies having
previously agreed to the Joint use of the
crossings under the conditions as fixed by
the City Engineer.
John Kelso appeared before the com
mittee and stated that the John Kelso
Company, of which he is president, is
blasting and grading the roadway of
Lombard street, between Montgomery and
Kearny streets, under a permit granted
by the Board of Supervisors in 1899. The
committee decided that the permit is in
operatl% e - because the blasting is being
carried on in a prohibited district, and
order that operations cease at once.
"Provided, however, that all subgrada
crossings of railroads for which franchises
may exslt or be' hereafter granted the
depth from top of rail to the lowest part
of the superstructure shall not exceed 2.4
feet where an Increase In said depth will
reduce the clear bead room to less than
twenty feet."
STTBGRADE CROSSINGS.
The Board of Works transmitted to the
committee the report of City Engineer
Grunsky regarding the franchise for the
bay shore route where it is crossed by the
Western Pacific, for which the matter of
the application 'for a franchise is now be
fore the Supervisors. Grunsky makes cer
tain modifications regarding the grades to
be followed by the bridges at certain
crossings, fo they may be used by both
roada should the applications be granted.
The mortifications noted as to the route to
be followed by the road are as follows:
"Crossing Tulare street by a bridge be
tween the east line of Mississippi street
and the east line of Texas street, with an
elevation of the top of rail of at least
20.767 feet above city base and with a
clear head room of at least fourteen feet.
' "Crossing Army street by a bridge be-"
tween. the .west line of Pennsylvania ave
nue and the west line 'of Mississippi street,
with an eleVatio'n of the top of rail of at
least 19.12 feet above city base and with
clear hrad room of at least 13.8 feet.
The ordinance provides for a grant of
the franchise for fifty years, and recites
that the main line of the road shall enter
the city from Sunnydale avenue, formerly
Tobln street. Viaducts and bridges are to
be constructed over specified crossings,
and additional bridges or viaducts are to
be constructed upon the order of the
Board of Supervisors over any track, laid
or to bo laid, on Fourth street south of
Channel or across Sixteenth street at or
near Seventh street.
The committee eliminates from the or
dinance the requirements that the South
ern Pacific Company shall build a viaduct
across Fifth street and shall abandon a
strip sixty feet wide through the Market
place , lots to Â«be reserved for a public
street. In exchange the company agrees
to give a strip of land twenty feet wide
for a distance of about a mile for the
widening of Fourth and Kentucky streets
southerly from Channel street, and this
condition is made part of the ordinance.
The matter of a franchise for the Mission
tracks and along Islals Creek is not in
corporated in the ordinance at all.
For the Market place lots thÂ© company
is to pay a rental of $600 per month for
five years, and thereafter an amount
equal to 3 per cent per annum on a valua
tion to be fixed by arbitration, but the
rental after the first five years shall not
be less than $750 per month. The rights
granted to the Southern Pacific Company
are granted on the further condition of
the contribution by the company of at
least $55,000 for the construction of a
bridge across Channel street from Third
street to Kentucky. v
OBANT FOR FIFTY YEARS.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors held a special meeting.yes
terday for the purpose of drafting thÂ© or
dinance providing for a proposed grant of
franchise for. right of way to the South
ern f Paciflc Company, for a bey shore line.

When a bit of a boy he served on the
schooner Black Witch. The captain of
that vessel was a man with a past. He
had either been a pirate himself or had
come into possession of valuable informa
tion relative to the cache of certain re
doubtable buccaneers. Buried, so many
feet in a certain direction from the tree
upon which the sun on a special day in a
particular month cast a shadow of char
acteristic 6hape. lay untold wealth. This
wealth was the loot gathered at the sack-
SCHOONEB BLACK WITCH.
IJeir.g- Saturday afternoon, however, it
was impossible to secure a Federal war
rant for Captain Brown's arrest Without
this warrant the United States Marshal
would have none of the prisoner. The po
lice protested their Inability to hold the
man and Captain Howard for the Oceanic
Steamship Company declined to take the
responsibility of converting the Mariposa
into a place of detention.
"He must be held," cried the men who
claim to have, been victimized by the
ancient mariner.
"Hold him yourselves," replied official
dom, and Captain James Brown was re
leased from the room to which he had
l>een confined when the liner entered the
harbor. -_ Â« - '
As he walked down the gang-plank he
looked anything but the nautical bunko
man his former friends charged him with
I .ping. More than common tall and of
peculiarly stalwart build, he more resem
bled a venerable viking. Snow white hair,
frosty board, straight nose, firm chip,
V.ead of intellectual lumpiness and frank,
pale blue eyes, all seemed in contradic
tion to the picture painted by the men
who claim to have found him out. His
belongings, packed neatly in a couple of
canvas covered grips, he turned, over to
the customs inspectors with the air of
a king, gracefully submitting himself to
the laws he had made for his subjects.
As the inspectors searched the old man
held up his head and glanced in the direc
tion of the nien he is charged with hav
ing victimized. His stare was long and
som vhat cptuemptaoas, melting, as he
turcid away, into a look of pity.
He eished sadly and, as he turned his
attention to the inspector at his feet,
there rolled from his lips In sonorous
tones the one word:
"Fools:"
BANISHES SIS SHIPMATES.
That was all the attention Captain
James Brown paid the men who would
have l.im behind the prison bars. From
then until he stalked from the Oceanic
dock he vouchsafed them not as much as
a glance. They had ceased to exist. He
had banished them from his 150,000,000
we rid.
The story of the Herman's mission
when she left here is, in brief, as follows:
Captain Brown, who is 72 years of age,
retired from the sea some fifteen years
ago. His life on the deep, according to
his story, had contained more of adven
ture than usually falls to the lot of one
man. It commenced when Brown was
Fti'l of tender years and from the start
was strongly tinged with the romantic.
For his neighbors in Auburn, R. I., where
the o'.d tna.n tried to settle down after his
retirement, and for all others who listen
ed to him, Inclufil2:g such as might have
rnor.f-y for treasure-hunting expeditions,
be had yarns that made the wildest 10
cent thriller setm tame. "VThen he told of
storms it wan of disturbances such as
rnoOern sailors know nothing. His tales
at fast passagr-B made the modern ocean
greyhounds Â»eem to limp and h!s calms
wore almost ettrnities and stiller than
the eilence of the grave. There was
nothing small about Captain James
lirown. He had examples from his own
career to Illustrate every happening of
modern days and when the wealth of
America's money kings became subject
for general discussion Brown was there
with the reminiscence that three of the
Mariposa's passenger's now declare to
have been a wicked dream.

Fchooncr Herman returned yesterday on
the Hr.er Mariposa, thoroughly awake and
once more in full possession of their rea
ponlng faculties. The dream, in wh.ch
for the greater part of a year they spent
Rn unharmonious existence, is for them
Fhattcred. The old man whose tales of
piratical loot had been the lure that hyp
notized, is a wicked old pirate and his
v hltc lock.-, that in the dazzle of contem
plated fortune had seemed venerable, are
now regarded as the hoary emblems of
an ice cold heart, the outward and visible
signs of inborn, deceit and treachery.
The old man who left here as Captain
James Brown, the man with the key to
a cavern containing golden coin and Jew
tls worth the modest sum of $50,000,000,
returned in irons, with all sorts of legal
vengeance hanging over his head. In the
name of logal vengeance, however, the
old man won the first move. The ammu
nition of his enemies wa# contained In
an official envelope addressed to the
T'niied States District Attorney and con
taining a record of an investigation held
in Papeete by United States Consul Doty.
The old man's, alleged sins are numerous,
but the one for which his former ship
mates hoped to hold him until they had
time to set a stronger legal trap was the
abusing of the Japanese steward of the
tchooner Herman.

"The Brown cotton corner," says a New
Orleans man, "is taking a great deal of
queer cotton to New Orleans. The staple
has become so valuable that the owners
of cotton gins are scraping the floors,
and have made up several bales of waste
cotton. Perhaps the most extraordinary
bale however, is one that arrived there
from Georgia. It was of the crop of 1872.
and is consequently 31 years old. Its
owner held out for 16 cents that year,
but when the market broke and cotton
went down he swore he would never sell
it for less than 16 cents.
"When cotton went up to 14 cents in
New Orleans he shipped it there, to be
ready for the 16 cents he pledged himself
to, with orders to his agent to sell when
ever that figure was reached. ,The cotton
has been stored in one room for thirty
one years, and is thoroughly dried out. It
lost fifty pounds In. the process. Experts
declare the staple to be as good a3 ever."

was refused. He said that he could get
the consent of the girl's mother and de
parted with the expressed intention of
doing so.
To-day they returned. They were ac

his license, stating that the Â«irl was 18

Because of the frequent assaults made
upon working linemen in Oakland, a po
lice guard is detailed wherever the com
pany's employes are compelled to go out
alone on work.
The continued cutting of telephone wires
and the blocking of the service has stirred
the town officials of Berkeley to action
and steps designed to put a stop to the
vandalism are to be taken Monday night
by the Town Trustees. The Trustees have
been asked to adopt a resolution empow
ering the. linemen employed by the tele
phone company to carry firearms and to
make them deputy marshals.
The suggestion to make the linemen of
ficers comes, from Louis Jacobi, general
superintendent of the telephone company.
Thomas Rickard, president of the Board
of Trustees,, called upon Jacobi yesterday
with" an offer, by the city, to aid in the sup
pression of midnight vandalism and from
Jacobi obtained a statement as to the de
3lres of the company touching conditions
in Berkeley.
"I explained to Mr. Jacobi." said Pres
ident Rickard to-day, "that the town has
but three or four peace officers, so that it
would be impossible for us to patrol the
streets and stop the cutting of wires. The
telephone * company and the people have
been annoyed long enough. I said, and It
is time we act together. Mr. Jacobi then
suggested that we make all the linemen
deputies, and that. I think, will be done
when we meet again."
When the Trustees meet Monday night
they will be addressed by E. J. Ellis. Ala
meda County superintendent of the com
pany, who will explain the difficulty of

dogs" of the navy, while In command of
the New York navy yard. One Sunday.
at the usual religious service of the men
on the training ship, the chaplain on duty
at the station read a notice before the
bluejacket congregation, closing with "by
order of the Bishop." The commodora
chanced to be passing within hearing as
the last words were uttered, and he
quickly turned about and addressed
the chaplain thus: "By whose or
der did you say?" The chaplain polite
ly replied, "By order of the Bishop of this
diocese." Without stopping to Inquire as
to the nature of the notice Commodore
Chauncey, appreciating that It emanated
from some other source than his offlce,
which was enough for him to know. In a
serious and commanding tone said: "Well,
the notice will not be obeyed. I'll give

The Statist is a well Informed journal
on British investments abroad and surely
it would know if American investments
here were, but another name for large
placements of British capital. To Mexico
it matters little whence comes the money
required for the development of her Im
mense resources, although It Is to be said
that the active participation of Ameri
cans In business undertakings here tends
to keep the two countries in close and
friendly relations.
Within the past fortnight lieavy invest
ments of American capital have been
made in Mexican mines, investments of
really great sums of money, and though
in one deal London is supposed to have
an interest the greater part of the funds
employed have been raised In New York
and other American cities.â Mexican

When United States Consul General
Barlow reported to the Washington Gov
ernment that J300.000.000 of American
money was invested here, local critics
raised .the objection ttiat In reality this
was in great part British capital, and
that the "Americans were only figure
heads in ' enterprises really owned across
the Atlantic."
If this were bo, why do we find the Lon
don Statist, in Its last issue to hand, say
ing: that the measures for stabilizing the

the United States Government as far as
it possibly can do this as in other mat

cepting so far as we all desire to aid the

A considerable portion of the tunnel Is

have shafts opening into it. equipped with
elevators. Although an underground
freight railway of this kind seems an ex
pensive substitute for trucks and horses,
it. is quite possible that it may promote
economy, as well as convenience, in hand
ling and transferring merchandise. Every
one must see that the maintenance of a
stable full of horses and wagons and of a
multitude of grooms and drivers is an im
portant Item In the cost of carrying on
business, especially when, as is often the
case, the wagons are driven half the time
empty, or with only, one small package In
them, and a system by which goods ar
riving by rail could be at once delivered
at their destination, with the minimum of

It appears that an Interesting work has
been going on In Chicago for several years
without the knowledge of the public, in
the excavation of a tunnel fourteen miles
long under the business district of the
city. This tunnel, is a business undertak
ing simply, and , is to contain a railway
for the transportation of freight among
the great mercantile houses and between
them and the freight stations of the for
ty-two railways which enter Chicago, be
sides furnishing accommodation for tele
phone wires and possibly wires of other
kinds. It is almost incredible that a tun
nel of this length, varying in width from
6 to 13 feet and In height from 8 to 14
feet, could have been constructed under
the most crowded part of a great city
without the knowledge even of the news
paper reporters, but the tunnel Is far be
low the surface, the depth varying from
27 to C5 feet, so that it was unnecessary
to make temporary roadways over It, and
the excavated material has been â¢ taken
out at night through "shafts opening in

Moore took rule and map and with the
evidence he introduced tried to show that
the accident could not have happened as
the girl stated. He endeavored to show
that she was attempting to get off the
moving train while it was In motion in
order to save a walk of several blocks. A
twenty days' stay of execution was asked
for .the company and the time was
granted.
The arguments "were masterly efforts.
Delmas made the most' of the fact that
his client was a young. girl with her life
spreading out before her'and that this In-
Jury might develop at any time In the fu
ture.
The trial has been a hard fought one.
Matched against each other were D. M.
Delmas for the girl and A. A. Moore for
tho railroad. Both attorneys had assist
ance, but these two carried on the fight.
Every point was challenged and every
piece of evidence scrutinized before It was
allowed to go to the jury.
Yesterday all the testimony had been
taken and this morning the arguments
began. After some preliminary skirmish-
Ing between the attorneys It was agreed
that the arguments should be limited to
three hours to- be divided between them.
Oelmas opened the case Â¦with an hour's
argument ' and then gave way to Moore,
who talked an hour and a half, when
Delmas closed with a speech half an hour
In length. The "jury was out but a short
time. - With 'the exception of one man.
they were unanimous In the granting of
the verdict as rendered.
The Jury which tried the case was com
posed of ex-Senator M. W. Dixon (fore
man), Carl Berlin. W. E. Acheson. E. K.
Waterman, C. H. Cole, E. J. Blandlng,
H. turn Suden, R. H. Casterson, W. â¢ D.

A jury this afternoon gave Gertrude
Johnson a verdict for 111,000 against the
Southern Pacific Company for damages
she received in being. thrown off a train
near Niles station. The girl claimed that
the brakeman had gone through the train
and called out that the next station would
be Niles and when the train came to a
standstill she took her basket and was
about to alight, when it suddenly started
again and she was thrown on to a pile of
tits. Her 6kull was fractured and her
arm broken. j
Her injuries necessitated the removel of
a piece of skull 2*3 Inches, over which
there Is now no protection but the skin
and scalo. The defense tried to show
that In the case of a lG-year-old girl, as
the plaintiff Is, she would entirely recover
from the effects of such a wound and that
It was through her own carelessness that
she was hurt.

While Walkirez was waiting for the ver
dict he was perceptibly nervous. He kept
his feet going and drummed with his lin
gers. He lit a cigarette, but threw it
away before he had smoked half of It. A
smile of relief came over him when it
was announced that he could still live.
The trial of the case has lasted for two
weeks. The jurors said that three ballots
were taken. The first one was to deter
mine his guilt and eleven stood for convic
tion and one for acquittal. A second wa?
taken with the same result and then it
was found out whose was the dissenting
vote. Troy expressed his beilef that
Walkirez was Insane at the time he com
mitted the deed. Arguments were used
to dissuade him from the stand he had
taken and one or two determined ones an
nounced their, intention of staying there
three weeks before they would agree to
anything less than imprisonment for life.
A third ballot was then taken and a
unanimous verdict fixing the penalty was
agreed upon.
Attorneys on both sides of the case ex
pressed themselves satisfied with the re
sult.- District Attorney Allen and Dep
uty District Attorney Philip" M. Walsh
said thft conviction of the man satisfied
them, while Attorneys Frank Herald and

" LOS ANGELES, Sept. 12.â Manager J.
F. Morley /of the Los Angeles Baseball
Association eaid to-day regarding the ac
tion of the National Association of Minor
BasebalJ Leagues in assigning Pitchers
Newton and Corbett to Brooklyn: "We
have something to say .about this. The
action of the National Association will
not aiTect Corbett and Newton as long as
they want to play in this league. This
Association of Minor Leagues has to
come to us. and any action they may
take in arbjtrarily assigning players now
in the Los Angeles Club will cut no fig
ure. I have already signed Newton for
next season and he will rtay right here,
I hope to sign Corbett also."
Morley .Hopes to Retain Corbett.
Promptly enough the future Attorney
General said: "It would be worth at least
5200,000 to me"â not wanting to remain
and believing that the sum would be suf
ficient to end the matter. He was re
tained, and that was his fee for the next
month's work.
Mr. Knox lives in onÂ© ' of the finest
houses in Washington and indulges his
fancy for fast horses. Every day that
the sun shines he may be seen driving
about the capital behind one of his horses,
which cost thousands of dollars. . , .
Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock was
rich from the time of his birth and has
been associated with big business enter
prises in the West, which make his
wealth grow with each day. The salaries
of any of the Cabinet officers named
would hardly pay their house rent. AH
their other expenses for entertaining, for
horses, for the diversions which they seek
in summer and for their households dur
ing the social season must come from
their private fortunes.
They are necessarily losing large sums
of money by remaining in the public ser
vice. But each of them has some good
excuse for remaining.
Mr. Root stays in office at a .sacrifice
because he has yet to work our some of
the army reforms which the legislation
of the last session of Congress provided
for. A year ago he was telling his friends
that he would remain only* until he had
secured the legislation.
Mr. Hitchcock stays in the Cabinet be
cause he wants to put the entire Interior
Department on a business basis before
giving way to a successor. Mr. Knox
stays, not because he wants to, but.be
cause he Is Interested In the great legal
fight over the interstate commerce law.
So each man can give a special reason
why he retains his Government place at
the sacrifice: of his personal Interests.â*
New York Commercial.". ...
Mr. Knox explained that he would be
unable to do so because of his plans for a
foreign tour. Pleadings were In vain until
he was asked how much It would be
worth to him to postpone his trip and
take the suit
In every branch of the Government ser
vice in the departments in Washington,
as well as in the Federal offices of the
various cities, rich men are found working
faithfully and hard because of the Inter
est they feel In their duties, writes the
Washington correspondent of the New
York Sun.
John Hay, Secretary of State, Is per
haps in his present place because of pa
triotic sense of duty. There are many
reasons why he should want to retire
from the cares of state. He Is rich and
has one of the finest homes in the na
tional capital, Just across Lafayette
square from the White House.
His social station could easily be main
tained were he out of office, and he could
continue to lead In the set that has been
led by him for so long. But he remains
in the public service because he is told
that no one knows the foreign relations
of our Government as well as he, or Is
qualified to fill his place just as he has
filled' it He serves because of a patriotic
sense of duty and because some of the
ambitions which he has had for the na
tion have not been entirely worked out.
Secretary of War Root is also rich. It
is said that his income at the time when
he went into the Cabinet was in excess
of $50,000 a year from his profession.
Attorney General Knox, too, is rich.
One Incident is cited to show Just how
some of his wealth came to him. He had
planned a trip to Egypt with his family
one winter and made every preparation
for it. Two days before his departure he
was approached by the representative of
one of the big Western Pennsylvania
companies and asked to take charge of a
suit which would require about a month
of his time.

Incomes Serve Their Country

a moderate . sized crowd present. Unlike

Despite the fact that the odds laid by
the ring have been of the airtight order,
the layers have laid away nothing, and
are lucky to get out with a small balance
to the good. The pea and shell game man,
with his duster and false whiskers, is fast
becoming a thing of the past, and the
sooner the syndlcater and his 80 per cent
book shuffles off to some .other land the
better it will be for the racing game in
this State. The bier has been prepared,

The California Club tennis courts pre
sented a lively ttppÂ«uranco yesterday af
ternoon when aurnÂ« spirited practice
matches were played. The most Interest
ing match was a doubles between Dr.
Sumner Hardy and Sidney Salisbury and
Drs. Hill and McChesney.
Hardy, the- ex-cbamplon, was easily thÂ»
star of the- four and played almgst as
good a gama as ever. Hardy and Balls
bury proved a trifle too strong for Hill
and McChesney. winning two seta out of
three. AJ1 three seta went to deuco and
Â¦were, exceedingly close. The loaers are-
Improving rapidly and will maka a strong
team by next year. Salisbury Is also
playing a fine doubles game and with
Hardy makes a strong combination.
In singles Harry Rolfa distinguished
himself by beating Drumznond MacOstvla
two sets out of three. Young Rolfa'a
occasioned considerable eurprlse la tha
San Rafael tournament. Ha Is making
rapid strides and Is undoubtedly made at
championship material.
After an absence of several weeks from
the courts Will Allen made his reappear-,
ance yesterday and played as cleverly as
ever. After losing the first two seta to
Norman Hodgkinson, tha crack profes
sional, he won, the next two and divided
the honors.
Merle Johnson, another crack, who haa
not played for several months, also ap*
peared on tha courts and, despite a Iac4
of practice, took Sidney Salisbury into
camp. The lattter made him work hard
to win, the match being close.
Herbert Long, one of the most promis
ing young players In the club, beat tha
veteran Harry Haight four sets to onaw
Halght showed a lack of practice and
was considerably off In his game. Long
was particularly clever In tha bacis
court.

of the blood, and as it flows through the body deposits a gritty, irritating substance
or sediment in the joints and nerves, and it is these that produce the terri-

British Accuracy in Firing
The wonderful target practice of the
British navy, 49 per cent hits (which has
since been beaten two points by our At
lantic squadron in its' quarterly practice).
Is said to be largely creditable to a me
chanical contrivance Invented by Captain
Scott of the English navy, called a "dot
ter," by which a small paper targÂ«;t
drawn to a scale, is caused* to move in
front of a gun with a combined vertical
and horizontal movement. While the tar
get Is In motion the gun pointer endeavors
to train the gun so as to keep the cross
wires of his telescope on the target;
Whenever the cross wires are "on" an
electric connection causes a pencil to
make a dot on the target, the dot repre
senting a real shot on a real target at'1000
yards. Thus the men are accustomed to
train the guns under the disturbing con
ditions of a ship in a seaway.
Ethereal Vibrations.
The effect of movements in the ether de
pends upon the rapidity of the vibrations
producing them. The unit of measure
ment for short waves in the ether Is the
blcron, which is about 1-25,003,00'Jth of an
Inch. Waves measuring 3S0 to 810 bicrons
affect our sense of sight, the formar num
ber giving violet and the latter red color.
The invisible raysâ to which the actinic
and Roentgen rays belongâ are shorter
and have been measured as short as 100
bicrons. Ether waves longer than those
giving light give the feeling of warmth.
The longest heat waves are eight times
the length of those of the red rays, or
l-350th of an inch. At the other end of the
scale are- electric waves above 150 feet <n
length â those used by Marconi being one
eighth of a mile.
"Caue Horse Sickness."
"Cape horse sickness" Is a disease
which resembles human malaria. It es
pecially attacks horses that are left to
graze all night in marshy regions. Dr.
PHchford found that horses stalled by
night in stables protected by wire gauze
remained perfectly well, and therefore
concluded that mosquitoes are responsi
ble for the disease.

THE BOTHERSOMETCESS OF
TOO MUCH ADIPOSE
Humorous Instances of the, Incon
v venience of Being Too
Dr. SImonton is very keen on advancing
in his profession; the healing art has no
more zelaous devotee. Alas for his ambi
tion, he quite neglected the regimen of
the late Mr. Banting, so that when he
applied for the post of assistant surgeon
on board one of the ships of the United
States navy the committee of selection
politely rejected him on the ground that
he was too etout to get through the
hatchways.
Two years since the guardians ,of Pet
worth, near Ashford, were obliged to re
fuse admittance to a female pauper in
consequence of her excessive corpulence.
Firstly, because they had no clothes large
enough to fit her massive per^pn; sec
ondly, because she could not walk up
stairs, and by reason of her abnormal
avoirdupois the \ workhouse officials were
unable to lift her from the ground.
At the time when an Ohio damsel be
came engaged to the man of her choice
she weighed, but ten stone â a moderate
weight that 'reached the alarming figure
of twenty-two stone. This was too much
for her fiance, who promptly cried off,
enly to find himself sued for breach of
promise, the deserted lady declaring that
as her excessive weight â an insuperable
bar to other offersâ had accumulated dur
ing their engagement, her lover had, by
unduly prolonging his courtship, been
guilty of contributory negligence.
While strolling through a French_falr
Lablache, the celebrated singer, a man of
enormous proportions, was accosted by an
Irate showman, who, with much indig
nant gesticulation, inquired what was the
use of exhibiting a "fat man" when the
public could see one much bigger for
nothing. It was taking the bread out of
an honest man's mouthâ that it was!
Tickled with the humor of the situation
Lablache gave the man a handsome gra
tuity and laughingly promised to quit the
fair ground forthwith.
On another occasion, when leaving Co
vent Theater after rehearsal, the same
singer found that his carriage had not ar
rived. A fourwheeler was therefore
hailed, into which, with some difficulty,
Lablache hoisted himself poised on the
edge of the jmaller seat. To change his
position was necessary, but as he rose
to' do so the 'floor of the vehicle, con
structed only to bear normal weight, gave
way with a crash, and the celebrated ar
tfst found himself standing In the road.
From this awkward position he was,
amid the laughter of the onlookers and
the objurgations of cabby extricated with
no little difficulty.â Tit-Bits.

Umpire â Levy. V
Seattle got Its gdod start in the fourth
inning, when they began to take a few
rides on the offerings of Graham. Then
the latter 1 s supporters went skywar*. and
ere they regained their composure four of
the Northerners were over the rubber and
the game was practically theirs.
Bill Devereaux got into a mix-up with
Byers in this inning. Murdock dropped an
easy fly from Mohler's bat and McCar
thy, who was on third, scored. Byers
was anchored at second and started "for
third. Murdock recovered the ball and
made a good throw to Devereaux, but the
brindle one let it pass him.
Byers started for the plate and Dev
ereaux deliberately jumped on his back
and tried to hold him. They came near
mixing it. When they were finally sepa
rated Levy allowed the massive backstop
to go home. From that time on the
crowd on the bleachers took turns hissing
and cherrinc the two players. Byers
came off with all the honors at this game.
When Graham got his beating in the
foTirth inning he was relieved and Dev
ereaux trotted out on the slab. He was
the master of the situation for a few
rounds. "Th*Â»n the Seattleites began to
Slve him a beating in the ninth and they
â¢acidPd three more tallies to their list.
Murdock made two wonderful throws
from the * right garden. He caught
Hughes at the rubber in each instance.
The first happened in the third round,
when Hughes got a double and went to
third on an out. Then Mohler hit a long
fly to right and Hughes started for the
plate as soon as it was caught. Murdock
returned the sphere with lightning speed
and just caught the runner a few Inches
from the pan. In the sixth inning he re
peated the trick in the same manner,
making 1 an almost impossible play in this
instance, as Hughes seemed to have the
ball beaten by several lengths. The
score :

Jay Hushes was in the points for the
visitors and It was his work alone that
made the game worth viewing. The big
fellow was there all the time and pitched
a magnificent game. Were It not for the
miserable backing up he got in the second
round the Cripples would have been
blanked. They only reached him five
times and all these hits were scattered
along the line.

AT THE RESORTS.
There were Ftiftches of roadbed over
which the construction train moved at a
rate of ISO feet an hour. The machine
VtDixei tvaÂ« cm> which differs In many
essentials from that which has been used
Â«is cl the Missirslppi River. One of
the most Interesting features is the man
ner in which the material Is delivered to
the roadbed, and the comparatively few
men required for the different operations,
me the tfrs and rails are lifted and moved
from the cars on which they are carried
to the roadbed, being connected and
sria.^d while the train is In motion.
An endless chain carrier puts the ties
in position, uMle a crane suspended upon
a Etec 1 . truss !>iwers the rails in advance
of the construction train. In this manner
the ctij?li)Â«-ci's in charge of the road hope
ti run into Clnci-'nati many weeks earlier
than they could otherwise have done.
The vork done upon the Cincinnatf,
Richmond and Muncie road demonstrated
that a force of lorty competent men were
nil tliat ;-*-cre i<t|i'irÂ»d to operate the mi
chine to Its fullest capacity, and that
wh^n renditions \\cr? favorable over tbree
miles ';f track in a day of ten hours could
be r"t down without difficulty, while an
Â«\<*raj:r 1 1 eve- two and one-half miles
could bÂ« refolded. The gearing on which
t!.Â» mutCTiil Is conveyed from the plat
form through the machine can be oper
ated at the same rate of speed at which
t!.o trjtii ir nif.vfJ, or its speed '1:11 be
doublr-d. The weir hi of the rails h'a.tdied
Include the heaviest used for standard-

C<;irini<.rfiHl.
This track-laying machine automatically
end accurately lifts the ties and rails into
po.-ltion, the most drudging labor in all
railroad construction. It also furnishes
the motive power for its own construction
tram.
This pieaÂ» of mechanism is the invention
cl a man named Hurley, who has spent all
of the paSv ten years in perfecting it; be
sides expending thousands upon thousands
of dollars on models, and so forth, before
success crowned his efforts. The machine
weighs about fifty tons, and was made in
Scranton, Pa. It is the only one of Its
kind in existence.
At the rate of three and a half miles a
<Jay a mos' peculiar machine Is now en
gaged In laying the tracks of the Cincin
nati. Richmond and Muncie Railroad.
It is calculated that if the right kind of
trees can be made to crow, on the in
vestment of a small sum, the State in 30
years will get something like $20,000,000
from the sale of the standing timber and
that thereafter the income of the State
will amount to millions of dollars every
year. â New Tork Commercial.
When the land Is taken the work of
carrying out the reforestation of the
State will be carried out - by â¢ Chairman
Pettlgrove. the head of the State Depart
ment of Prisons.
The work will be done on a large scale,
and practically every section of this State
where forests are needed will eventually
benefit by the policy. As for the State,
there is good reason for saying that the
profits of the undertaking will in tfme be
big enough to wipe out the present State
debt. Possibly it may make all State
taxes unnecessary.
The State will take lands by the right
of eminent domain. Only land now con
sidered worthless but good enough to
plant trees on. will be taken. Outside of
the large cities of Massachusetts, such
land exists almost everywhere. The
land long ago refused to pay taxes on it
It is. to all practical purposes, public
land to-day. The back taxes on such land
are enough to wipe out any claim to
ownership that might be set up. There
Is other land, almost as worthless, on
which small taxes have been paid the
land being assessed at only a nominal
price. This land also. If taken by emi
nent domain, could be bought for little
more than the expense of condemnation
In almost every case, this land was
once the site of a forest, but the wood
ha* been cut off. As it Is good for noth
ing else but woodland, the owners will be
glad to get anything for It. The takings
by the State, therefore, will amount in all
to a good many thousand acres, probably
The total cannot yet be stated, because
even the State officials have not yet de
elded upon that total.
Under the general direction of Governor
Bates, plans are in progress for restoring
the forests of Massachusetts by the work
of convict camps. This will be the first
experiment of the kind in the United
States. It will probably attract the no
tice of sociologists all over the world,
says the Boston Advertiser.
The old ccment-llned noria, or com
munity well, was cleaned out while the
committee was on the ground, and after
twenty-five years" Inactivity it save forth
a fine volume of Ice-cold water. This
work on the well has been in contempla
tion by the neighboring people for twenty
years, but Jolon la a "manana" country
and it remains for the leaguo to place it
onco again in commission.
The lumber for the restoration is fur
nished by the Sans lumber mill, situated
on the Santa Luclas, about twenty miles
from the mission, and Its proximity haa
reduced the price almost one-half. It is
an interesting fact that most of these
giant Umbers are being cut and hau'.od
by descendants of the mission Indiana,
who have continued to practice the in
dustries taught their ancestors by the
padres in the long ago.
So, too, will the walla be rebuilt large
ly by their hands. The work is in charsa
of Architect Will r>. Shea, but tne im
mediate superintendency' Is in the han<H
of J. Alonzo Forbes, who for thlrty-sevon
years has lived within call of the mission
bells and is familiar with every detail of
the famous old cloister. Alany of tho
Spanish "residents of the surrounding
country have volunteered to donate a
week's labor toward the restoration of
their beloved chapel, within whose shad
ow many, were reared, and this offer be
speaks a "patriotism that is good to see.
for the eun shines hot on the San Anto
nio Valley and produces an overpowering
antipathy to labor.
The league has obtained proprietorship
from George Dutton of many furnishings
of the mission and numerous articles usetl
about the ancient workshops. These. In
cluding a beautiful copper baptismal font.
will be replaced in the cloister when tho
restoration Is complete.
The league has on hand $1100. which it
confidently hopes will b<* augmented as
the work progresses. The Native Son*
and Native Daughters have manifested
great Interest in the belated work of res
toration, and at Its last Grand Council
the Young Men's Institute announced itj
intention to asisst in the patriotic work.
The first actual work of restoration oa
the ruins of San Antonio de Padua be
gan on Monday last by the California
Landmarks League, when the descend
ants of the old neophytes gathered in
the sanctuary to clear out tha fallen
beams and gather the unbroken tiles and
adobes with which to replace the root
and walls.

Young girls at I J \y \

are earnestly in s Jr^ Â»
vited to write Mrs* <Â£$
Pinkham for advice; all such letters are
strictly confidential ; she has guided in a
motherly way hundreds of young women ;
and her advice is freely and cheerfully given.
School days are danger days for American girls.
Often physical collapse follows, and it takes years to recover the
lost vitality. Sometimes it is never recovered.
Perhaps they are not over-careful about keeping their feet dry;
through carelessness in this respect the monthly sickness is usually
rendered very severe.
Then begin ailments which should be removed at once, or they will
produce constant suffering. Headache, faintness, slight vertigo, pains
in the back and loins, irregularity, loss of sleep and appetite, a tendency
to avoid the society of others, are symptoms all indicating that woman's
arch-enemy is at hand.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has helped many a
young girl over this critical period- With it they have gone through
their trials with courage and safety. With its proper use the young
girl is safe from the peculiar dangers of school years and prepared for
hearty womanhood.

Harris said that Jensen and the two
Japanese were employed by his firm, on
commission, buf had no authority to col
lect money. He ascertained that they had
collected $52 on September 1 and hud ap
propriated the money.
Harris also alleged that the three de
fendants had been in the habit of making
out orders for rice and other goods on
firms ostensibly for other lirms and after
getting- possession of the goods would sell
them and appropriate the proceeds. To
what extent they had done this was not
yet known.
Jensen was arrested, but Harris called
at the City Prison later and said that
Jenren had been mistaken for another
man and he wanted him released. Jenst-n
was taken before Judge Cabanlsa and re

But such is the extraordinary fatality
that seems to dog inventors that Saw
bridgo was killed In an explosion in his
laboratory, which wrecked the entire cot
tage. This happened soon after the
British Government had begun to nego
tiate with Sawbridge for the purchase of
In one way t is perhaps as well that
the new gunpowder "fulmite," invented
by Herbert Sawbridge six years ago, nev
er came to a head.
Saw bridge discovered this powder by ac
cident in his little chemical experimenting
room at Kxeter, Kngland. He perfected
the powder after a good deal of study
and trouble, and finally showed that in an
ordinary service rifio this powder could
drlvp a bullet accurately a distance of
nearly six miles, and that at ordinary
ranges It gave over tjjn times the penetra
tion that "cordite," the present powder,
gives. A bullet propelled by it at 600
yards would penetrate twelvo men. It
would have been a terribly destructive
invention, and one of its best points was
that it did not strain or corrode a gun in
any way; and, above all, damp could not
harm it.
THE SECRET OF "FULMITE."
Tho Mills lamp was an incandescent
Untit produced without any using up of
materialsâ it had nothing to do with com
bustlon, and tho "flame" of it was per
fectly cold. It was certainly one of the
mnpt wonrtr rful Inventions of the age,
and not at all an expensive affair.
made two of those lamps and demonstrat
ed their absolute success, but an ex
traordinary thing happened before the in
vention was put at the disposal of the
publl :. On the night of May 20, 1SS9,
Mills' laboratory, in Hampstead. was
brokf-n into, both lamps broken into frag
ments and all the papers describing the
invention, involving years of work, were
stolon. Th^re was not the slightest clew to
the perpelratora of the burglary, which
was done most scientifically, nnd the
crime has never been traced.
Even the reason for it is not known â
whether it was mallc-e, jealousy or theft.
No use lias been made l the stolen
papers, and Mills, who depended on these
papers, fot to work again, but two
months later he contracted typhoid and
died, and the world was thus deprived of
his secret.
The extraordinary "perpetual lamps" of
Henry Mills, which h<- invented, perfected
and proved th<- worth of twelve years ago,
wore lost in finite a different manner.
MILLS' WONDERFUL LAMPS.
Trains or any other vehicles, as it was
proved, would be able to travel at nearly
double their present speed If constructed
of "talium," and there was no kind of
edged tool that wouid not bo r.s k Â¦â¢<â¢$!, as
well as much lighter, if made of the new
metal. The commotion caused by , this
discovery wa? extraordinary, and ' still
more so was the upshot of it, .for the
magnitude of ita success overcame Ad
ams' reason, and he became insane before
ever the secret of the construction of
"talium'.' was given out. Adams died a
year later ti hopeless lunatic, and as there
were no papers explaining his method the
great secret was lost. All the tools and
engines "f "talium" which he had made
remain, but no analysis has revealed the
imthod by which the metal was blended.
Thon there is tho lost secret of the
wonderful new metal called "talium,"
which would certainly have been worth
many millions to the Inventor. Grantley
Adam.- discovered it just eight years ago,
and during its short ltfo It was one of the
prc-acst wonders of the "science and
commerce',' v/oi. u . "Talium" was an al
loy of metals electrically treated, nearly
;a. per cent lighter than steel, both strong
er and tougher, and costing! 30 per cent
less t.i produce. It was tnp fruit of four
years' hard work and study, and event
ually Adams completed It and publicly ex
posed ii to every kind of test.
So complete was his disappearance that
from that day to this not the smallest ex
planation has been h!t upon.
"TALIUM."
He. like Waymouth of heat power fame,
manufactured his diamonds before an au
dience of scientists und produced three
fine stones, which were tested and pro
nounced faultless. Two of them are still
in existence and are the greatest curiosi
ties the jewel world haa ever seen. But
within a fortnight of this triumph, before
any new stonei were put on the market,
Warner utterly disappeared from his
house on Harley street, London, leaving
no trace whatever.
He invited a committee of scientists and
engineers, including Prols, Huxley and
Forbes Brown, and showed them that his
two machines worked to perfection. The
affair made a great stir and it was proved
that a great power of unlimited scope
had been discovered. Waymouth was
flooded with offers of huge sums for his
Invention, but, for no apparent reason,
except, perhaps, the alleged madness of
gtnius. he absolutely refused to either
bring it out himself or sell the secret. He
announced himself satisfied with the tri
umph of the invention, and before hi3
doath, a year later, he destroyed all the
rapers and pluns explaining the system
and removed the essential parts of the
two engines. These engines are still pos
nesped by his heirs, but nobody has been
able to make anything of them.
LOST ART OF DIAMOND MAKING.
Still stranger was tlie famous loss of
the recipe for the manufacture of dia
monds some iiftoen years ago.
Herbert Warner, who aiong discovered
and held the secret of diamond making,
did not live to wreck the diamond indus
try as people thought he would, and the
circumstances of the loss were mysteri
ous and tragic. Inferior diamonds can
still be produced artificially, but only at
a cost of about ten times their value.
Warner, after years of experimenting,
was able to turn out a genuine diamond
of large size und of the first water at the
cost of a small fraction of the complete
stone's worth.
He had produced beforehand a round
doten of excellent inventions which still
bear his name, including the modern re
volving chimney cowl; and, having made
a large fortune, he devoted himself to
harnessing the ordinary heat of a fire
and making a new power of It. The idea
was laughed at by all his friends; but,
after four years of study and experiment
ing, he produced a stationary engine that
gave double the power of any steam
driven mechanism at about one-third of
the cost, and also a small model heat
locomotive large enough to draw a truck
with a man on it.
A recent isaua of the most prominent
exponent of the steam engineering indus
tryâ Powerâreviews a dumber of inter
esting Instances which cannot do other
wise than convince even tha most doubt
ful that engineering la to-day very, very
far from having reached a pinnacle of
perfection. Among other notes it states
that It Is hardly twenty years since John
Waymouth, the Wolverhampton engineer
and designer, discovered the motive power
of heat, exhibited it in one of the sim
plest, cheapest and most useful engines
imaginable, and then deprived the world
\>i its benefit.
What Mme. Curie says about the
cause of the mysterious properties re
cently observed deserves to be quoted
in full:
"From the beginning of the investiga
tions on radio-active substances the
spontaneity of their radiation has been
a problem which has had the greatest
interest for all students and Investiga
tors In physics. T'o-day we are" further
advanced in our knowledge of radio
active substances, and we know how to
Isolate one radio-active body of great
radiant power â radium. By taking ad
vantage of the wonderful properties of
radium we have succeeded in making a
profound study of the rays emitted, by
radio-active bodies generally. The dif
ferent kinds of radiations which have
been studied up to the present time all
present certain analogies with the
groups of rays which exist In Crookes
tubesT with the so-called cathode rays
and with the Rontgen rays. Similar
groups of rays are also to be found In
the secondary radiations produced by
Rontgen rays, and In the radiation from
substances which have, by induction, ac
quired radio-activity.'
"While the nature of the radiation is
actually better known tnan before, the
cause of spontaneous radio-activity re
mains as much of a mystery as ever, and
this phenomenon is still an enigma for
us. Spontaneously active substances,
and, above all, radium, are sources of
energy. Tho amount of energy in which
they give rise is revealed to us by the
radiations of Bacquerel and by the
chemical and luminous effects produced,
and the fact that there is a constant
disengagement of heat. .
"It haa been asked, then, if tho en
ergy thus manifested is created in the
radio-active substances tnemselves, or,
rather, it in not borrowed by them
from external sources. None of the nu
merous hypotheses which have been
founded on these two methods of view
ing the question have ns yet received
any experimental confirmation." â The
Independent.
Several bits of history new to most
readers are brought out by Mme. Cur^e.
One Is the share which Bhe and her
husband had respectively in the ' fa
mous discovery of polonium and ra
dium. As long ago as 1898 she had found
that salts of thorium emitted substan
tially the same peculiar radiations as
uranium compounds. A German,
Schmidt, seems to have hit upon the
fact simultaneously, but, bo far as the
Paris chemists were concerned, Mme.
dufie alone deserves the credit of that
discovery. It was then noticed that a
large number of natural minerals, which
are mixtures of several salts, but which
contained either radium or thorium,
were radio-active. At first It was be
lieved that one or the other of these two
metals was responsible for the phenom
enon. Mme! Curie then undertook an
experiment which suggested a different
conclusion.
One of these minerals was chalcolite,
which is a compound of phosphates of
copper and uranium. â¢ In Its native state
It was about twice as powerful as ura
nium In emitting what are known as
Becquerel rays. Mme. Curie manufac
tured an artificial chalcolite, putting in
the proper ingredients to insure gen
uineness, but this product failed to ex
hibit the same radiating power as the
native Bait. This has excited a sus
picion that some other element was
present in minute quantities in the lat
ter. It was at this point that M. Curie
was tempted to Join his wife in the
hunt. Two new elements were elimin
ated, polonium, which resembles bis
muth In its chemical properties, and ra
dium, wTilch is allied to Darium. For
the second of these part of the honor Is
due to M. Bemont, who assisted In 1 tne
research.

At home the financial situation Is ap
parently viewed with calmness. There Is
an abundance of money for mercantile
end similar purposes, but the banks con
tinue to show extreme conservatism
where money is wanted for stock market
purposes. Reports that Secretary Shaw
will discriminate against banks retiring
their currency find new believers. In
this connection it is to be noted, how
ever, that the applications of banks for
the retirement of circulation still come
In large numbers, the limit for this month
having been already exhausted.
Coal trade conditions are exciting some
Interest by reason of the apparent Inten
tion of the eo^l carrying railroads to re
strict production. Indeed, it has already
been announced that the anthracite ton

demand.
BANKERS ABE CAUTIOUS,
According to estimates of the Govern
ment's own experts, the crop reports
show an increase of something like $150,
000,900 in the mnrket value of six, import
ant items, notwithstanding a decrease of
other crops of lesser importance. In keep
ing with this exhibit Is the latest Gov
ernment crop contrasting the extent and
volume of this country's foreign trade for
this year and that of ten, years past. The
figures show an increase on the export
side for the period named of ' 5577 ,000,000,
as against an increase of Imports for the
same period of $159,000,000. Despite thia
marvelous growth, foreign critics con
tinue to remind us that our accounts are
still on the debit side, to which they were
transferred when our speculative fever
was at its height.
The most depressing feature of the
week was the depression of the steel
shares. The recent reduction in the price
vf Southern pig iron naturally served to
militate against the Steel and Iron stocks
generally, added to which it is admitted
that orders in almost all branches of the
trado show a falling off.
The week's business was probably the
lightest of the year, the total transac
tions barely aggregating as much as a
single day's operations in the bull cam
paign In 1902. In fact, dullness was the
chief characteristic of the market, which
from Tuesday's opening until to-day's
Hosing' bore frequent- evidence of flagrant
manipulation by the professional element.
The resumption of business after the
triple holiday brought no demand for
stocks, although the attitude of London
and the Continent generally was friendly.
Some comfort was derived from the fact
that the excels reserves of the Asso
ciated Banks, In face of a further drain
age upon their holdings, is well over $15,
000.000. as compared with about $700,000
this lime last year.
WEEK'S BUSINESS LIGHT.
XEW YORK,* Sept. 12.â Trading during
to-day's brief seesion of the stock merket
was so lifht and otherwise commonplace
aa to call for little comment. Only slight
response was made to the London market,
which reported better prices for our se
curities, and particularly the Pacifies and
grangers, the features over there being
Union Pacific and St. Paul. Even the
steel stocks were bought abroad. ' The
exchange was very small, and from thÂ«
outset here the market was narrow and
Irregular, early tones showing advances
and declines in about equal proportion.
St. Paul alone exhibited firmness at the
opening, although an easier tone was
shown by such issues aa Pennsylvania
axid Reading. The first transaction in
United States Steel common was at a
slight advance, which was soon lost, while
the preferred was altogether neglected.
Atchison, the feature of the week as to
activity and strength, opened down and
sustained a material net loss.
Before the end of the first hour the
market became so listless that it could
scarcely be said to have either tendency
or tone. The -bank statement, with a loss
of cash almost three times as large as
had been predicted, together with a fur
ther expansion of the loan contraction,
brought increased weakness all around,
the chief sufferer being Brooklyn Rapid
Transit, which made an extreme decline
of 2 B i in spite of a moderate Increase of
net income over the previous year. The
list closed weak.

Oceanic Steamship Company's Liner Mariposa Arrives
From the South Seas, Spotless as a Well-Kept
Yacht, With Twenty-Nine Passengers and Full Cargo
TUB Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa arrived yesterday
afternoon from Tahiti with twen
ty-nine passengers and a cargo of
â tropical products. As has been
the case ever since she commenced to use
liquid fuel, the Mariposa came Into port
with her decks and paintwork guiltless of
smear or 'smudge and In general looking
more like a well-kept-up private yacht
than a vessel engaged in commercial
transportation.
C. X. Fulcher, formerly purser on the
Mariposa, came up on the Mariposa with
his wife and family. Fulcher has been
engaged in business in the South Seas
since he left the service of the Oceanic
Steamship Company. The Mariposa's car
go included 110,218 cocoanuts, a large ship,
ment of copra and ninety-eight barrels of
wine. Her passengers were as follows:
Dr. G. J. I-uce, Captain G. W. Sutton, J.
Chetwood. G. H. He'.lman, G. T. .Wright,

OnÂ© of the problems of the efflclcnt
management of a great ocean lirer is the
ehip'8 linen. There Is the bed linen for
the first and second class passengers and
officers, numbering on a full trip about a
thousand souls. There are towels galora
to be furnished for each stateroom, and
the tablecloths and napkin?, all of wh'ch
must be renewed dally. Moreover, the
quality of linen supplied to a modern
ehlp like the Oceanic or the Cedrlc of tha
White Star line, or the St. Paul or Phil
adelphia of the American line, is the very
best that can be bought in the market,
finer even that that ordinarily supplied
to the patrons of a first-class hotel on
shore.
On a liner this linen is changed every
day. and as there Is no opportunity to
launder the accumulation of stock on
board, the ship must start with a full
supply for the trip and a liberal margin
for emergencies. For instance, the St.
Paul took out on a recent trip soma 50.000
pieces, including 10,000 napkins. 10.000
sheets. 300") pillow slips. 1000 tablecloths,
1000 counterpanes, 8000 bedroom tow%ls and
an astonishing number of dusters, cooks'
cloths, glass cloths, dresser cloths and a
variety of minor pieces known only to thÂ«
cooks and stewards.
This necessitates a mighty linen-room
at each end of the line whence are sup
plied the clean pieces In exchange for tha
soiled ones brought ashore at the end of
each trip. It H estimated that 149 ships
of the International mercantile marine.
as the largest .aggregation of ocean-going
liners in the world, have at their com
mand 4,000.000 toÂ»6,000,000 piecesâ a supply
on each ship and an equal supply at eaeh>
end of the line, clean and waiting thÂ«
arrival of the vessel In port. This neces
sitates an army of shore employes, whose
task is to launder this linen, check it oft
and furnish it to the outgoing vessels.
On each ship there is one steward
whose sole care is the linen. lie has this
stored by the thousand pieces in various
linen-rooms below and delivers the re
quired amount to the bedroom and table
stewards, the cooks and scullions, who
come to him daily with the soiled pieces
In their charge and exchange them for an
equal stock of clean. The soiled linen is
dried thoroughly in a drying-room heated
by steam, and stored in bags, which are
sent ashore at the end of the voyage la
New York or Boston, Liverpool, South
ampton or Antwerp as the case may be.
The steerage, or a3 they call It nowa
days, the third class, has its linen depart
ment as well as the first and second class,
but thi3 does not Include bed linen. Tha
immigrants are provided instead Â¦with
straw mattresses and stout, comfortable
blankets, which receive equal attention
with the other bedroom supplies at tho
end of each trip, the blankets being thor
oughly washed, boiled and disinfected, ai
well as the mattress covers. The straw
from the latter la also replaced with new
clean straw each trip. Nevertheless there
is much third-class linen, for the third
class passengers now sit at tables cov
ered with white cloths, and the cooks'
department uses supplies similar to thus*
in the first and second class.
Losses of linen on the trip are charged
to the general profit and loss account of
the ship, and are not accounted to either
steward or "passenger. The linen man.
however, takes special care of the nap
kins, which are most easily lost and thÂ«
most costly of the supplies. The table
stewards who come to him for these have
to sign a book for the amount taken and
this Is suppaped to, make them more care
ful In the handling.â New York Times.
Many quaint and curious customs, hu
morous and pathetic, survive among sail
ors, and now and then a new one arises
which seems to have no connection with
the old ones. Just as the Uner has bred
a new type of seaman, and a new sea
faring classâ the stewardsâ so these latter
seem to have established a Neptune "of
their ownâ a humorous social deity known
as the Grand Worthy Bung, head of the
Society of Bungs.
The Grand Worthy holds court princi
pally in the China and Australia trade,
though members of his court frequently
spend the summer in trips across the
Atlantic, generally on such vessels as sail
from Southampton, whither come the
ships' from the south ar.d east. When
trade is dull on the passenger ships of
the Oriental lines. In summer. It is good
on the trans-Atlantic liners, and stewards
are transferred to them, where the harv
est is greatest. It is only below decks,
however, that the steward puts off his
alert and respectful manner and frolics
with his fellows.
In the seclusion and freedom of the
"glory hole," when the stewards are off
duty, you might see a steward draw a
cork from his pocket, step up ta- another
and cry: "Bung up." Then must the
man addressed produce a similar cork.
If thin badge of membership is lost or
mislaid, the loser Is fined twopence for
the benefit of the treasury of the society.
Then there Is apt to be a chorus of "Bung
up!" from the onlookers, who are also
members, and for each who so addresses
him the unfortunate who has mislaid his
precious token must pay the twopence
fine, up to the s!xth time. After that he
is exemptâ until the next time.
That la about all one will see of the
Bung Society on the short Atlantic trips,
but on the longer voyages to India and
China it flourishes to a much greater ex
tent. There, In the forepeak or the "glofy
hole." the Grand Worthy Bune holds
court on frequent evenings* with Â» quaint
and amusing ceremony. None at these
sessions may address the Grand "Worthy
Bung unless spoken to, under penalty of
twopence; none may enter the lodge with
out the password, and if a member is ad
dressed by the Grand Worthy he must al
ways In replying call him by his full title,
or be mulcted. The penalty for profanity
is a penny a word and for dumb motions
there is a like fine. There are fines a!so
for misappropriating another marts In
signia of membership, for falling asleep
during lodee meeting, for neglecting to
learn passwords or ritual, or for disclos
ing either to another member, and a host
of other things that insure alertness and
loyalty.
The chief steward, though one of the
dignitaries of the ship, generally belongs
to this whimsical society, but it Is not
permitted to "Bung him up," and he is
not subject to the penalties: instead lie
stands a stated assessment of half a sov
ereign. The society is thus not only per
mitted but encouraged. It conduces to
fellowship among the stewards, trains
them to be alert, watchful and respectful
âqualities valued highly In the nrofesgion
âand elves that touch of hunjor ;o'!ife
on shipboard that brightens long hours
and wearying labor. The money -which
accumulates In the treasury Is spent at
intervals In a Jollification ashore, when
the members of the society ar-j able to
attend, and this may take the form of a
dance in London, a picnic up the Hugli
in India, or a chopstlck dinner in soms
Chinese tea garden. â Baltimore American.
The statement shows a fairly gocd baT*
ance, the gain In loans, less loss of cash,'
calling for an Increase of $256,300 In de
posits. One feature was a gain of $327,400
In circulation, following more or less de
creases In previous weeks. The loans are
$8,387,200 In excess of deposits, again? t
$6,2S4,500 In the previous wook. The daily
average of â¢ clearings for the five days
was $153,000,000, while in the week ending
September 5 it was $162,000,000.

NEW YORK, Sept 12.â The Financier
aaya: The chief feature of the statement
of the* New York Associated Banks last
week was the loss of $1,003,500 in cash re
serve, an amount larger by $1,226,600 than
the decrease which was estimated upon
the basis of the traceable movements of
money during the week. The discrepancy
was probably principally caused by largs
unreported withdrawals of money early
In the week, which much more than off
set the later gains due to the return to>
the city of holiday money. The deposits
were increased only $64,300, malting thÂ©
reserve requirements $16,075 more; adding
this sum to the loss of cash made $1,924.
775. as the decrease in surplus reserve,
which now is $13,372,200. Computed upon
the basis of deposits, less those of $37.
285,900 of public funds, the surplus is $21.
693,675. The loans were increased $2,617,
000, or $S62,700 more than in the previous
week. â¢'. i .f.;

WEEKLY BANK STATEMENT.
The "Stocking" Room.
The National Bank of Commerce of
Kansas City is one of the foremost fi
nancial institutions of the Far West.
Capital, $1,000,000; surplus. $1,000,000; undi
vided profits, $550,000; deposits $33,000,000.
Following the example of our Fifth Aven
ue Bank, it Is paying particular attention
to the accounts of the fair sex. Its stock
Is worth $355 a share, and if the women
are allowed to have more to say about
its affairs the price may one of these
days go to $4100, the price of Fifth
Avenue Bank shares. A unique feature is
the "stocking" room. We have heard of
"stock" rooms In financial institutions,
but never before of a "stocking" room.
I do not believe President Algernon Sulli
van Frissell has a "stocking" room In
his bank at No. 530 Fifth avenue.â New

Acid by Electricity.
The production of nitric acid by elec
tro-chemical methods Is a new process
that promises extensive changes in our
agriculture. The manufacture of nitric
add from the nitrogen and oxygen of the
air in sufficient quantities for commercial
use has been the dream and hope of sci
entists for years. At Niagara experi
ments have been Conducted successfully
in producing commercial nitric acid by
using a high tension current In an air
chamber, by which a yield of one pound
of nitric acid Is obtained for every seven
horsepower hours.â Exchange.

rich, popular and respected, is principal
proprietor of Child's Bank, a rule of
which establishment is that one partner
should always sleep on the premises. In
addition to this a head clerk is constantly
on duty "keeping offlcership," as It i3
termed, and seven Junior clerks also live
and sleep In the house. Another quaint
relic of past days is the habit of calling
the front of the bank "the shop" and Its
back premises the "counting-house."
Much Is written of the modern business
woman, but she existed as a social factor
nearly a century ago. From 1S0S till 1867
Sarah Countess of Jersey ruled Child's
Bank as head partner, and signed the.
firm's books and shared profits until the

Conditions in the vegetable market showed
little change from the previous report, stock
of all kinds being ample and the demand about

too heavy to admit of any advance in prices.

the canners buying the bay article at the. min

There was no change of any consequence,
either here or at Western centers. The Chi
cago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. said:
"There is not much change In prices. The
general feeling Is fairly steady, with senti
ment probably favoring- th;> bull â¢ side. The
advance from the low point has been a mate
rial one. but has been contributed to largely
by the demand from shorts. Receipts of hogs
are moderate and demand fair. Several weeks
of what should be a good period of consump
tive demand are Immediately ahead of us and
this influences the speculative feeling. It is
therefore probably too soon to begin selling
provisions short and perhaps they may be
bought on the soft spots for .some profits."

CHICAGO. Sept. 12. â Trajingr in wheat was
largely of a professional nature to-day, with
local traders Inclined to take profits on the
bulges. Some selling of this nature caused
the market to ease off from the top Just be
fore the close, final figures being a shade
lower at Sl"i4f82c.
Trade In corn was rather quiet, commission
hous<?s doing the greater part of the business.
December opened about steady at yesterday's
close, sold up to 50%c and closed firm at
5<J%(\ v.ith a gain of He. "
There was little feature in trading In oats.
but there was free selling on the advance and
a portion of the gain was lost. The elope
was steady at a gain for December of Ho at
.â¢57Â»s<&37* 4 c.
There was weakness in provisions at the
start, but the feeling became strong on support
by the packers, reacting later on profit tak
ing. October pork was unchanged at $13 (52%,
with lard 2%c higher at $8 32%, and ribs
down 2%c at ?8 67%.

CORN â The market continues weak owing to
the liberal receipts from the West. The Chi
cago letter of Bolton, de Uuyier & Co. says:
"Market Is a little higher. There are fur
ther general rains throughout the West which
are not needed and which are unfavorable to
the growing crop. There Is also a cheerful
prospect of frost, particularly In the western
boundary of corn belt. The cash situation
la a fairly strong one. Receipts are moderate,
and corn Is being freely taken for shipment.
There is a large short Interest and equally
aggressive trading 1 on both sides of the mar
ket." .

FUTURES.
WHEAT â Foreign futures were weak. Chi
cago was higher on rains and predicted frosts
in the Northwest. The Chicago letter or Bol
ton. de Ruyter & Co., said: "We cannot see
much In the short side of wheat. We have
been bullish, both on facts and on the theory
The facts are that the world's crop of wheat
is short; the supplies of old wheat aro ex
hausted, and ' at current rates of consumption
it Is difficult to see whence supplies for the
year are to come. Stocks of flour are exhaust
ed and the demand Is large and urgent. So
far as this country Is concerned farmers are
v/ell to' do and both able and disposed to mar
ket their surplus slowly". Thesp are the facts.
Our theory has been that with small European
crops, considerable damage and delay by bad
weather and material Injury to other food pro
ducts, the European demand In this country
must soon materialize on a considerable scale
and become urgent. So far bur theory Is a
disappointment. We still feel, however, that
time Is the only element of uncertainty. In
the meantime -at the height of the movement
stocks are not increasing and are very small."
In this market the only change was a de
cline In futures.

Trading In the Fruit market was active. Re
tailers were stocking up for the Sunday trade
and the demand for shipment on the Puget
Sound steamer, out to-day, was steady. Mel
ons were the strongest feature of the market.
Two cars of Watermelons came In and as the
market had previously been bare pricea had
a sharp advance and the btock found ready
sale. ".Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons had a
further advance, receipts being light and the
demand brisk. Peache9 were firm, particularly
choice freestones from the mountain districts.
There was a steady inquiry for - Strawberry
frees, but there were none received. That de
scription would have found ready sale at $1@
1 25 per box, had there been any available.
Wrapped Sol ways sold well for shipping at 50Â©
60c per box and clingstones In bulk met with
a steady demand from canacrs and the regu
'Â¦Â¦ lar trade. Prunes. Pears, I fancy Apples and
I Quinces were in good request at previous
l prices. Common, wormy Apples were abun
i dant and very dull. Figs moved freely and
I although receipts we're ample, prices were
i firmer. Pomegranates were offering freely
I and attractive lots readily cemmanded the top
I quotation. Choice table Grapes in crates were
; in rather light supply and sold well for phlp
' ping, with occasional lots of fancy Tokay
: commanding a small premium over the quota
i tlons." Offerings in large and small boxes were
.liberal and moved freely. Prices of Wine
Grapes were unsettled. Several cars were on
the track and the demand was limited. Sales,
of fancy stock were reported at $28 per ton.
but the quantities were too small to JUKtify
such a quotation. Berries arrived freely and
, attractive lots met with prompt sale at good
prices. Huckleberries were weaker under
heavy receipts.

vice In the desert sections of -Arizona,
New Mexico and portions of .California,
where excessive draughts are productive
of much dust. It Is used for sprinkling the
tracks. Sixty-seven miles â¢ of track In
California, 118 - miles in Arizona and 139
miles in New Mexico,- or a total of 316
miles, receive this treatment. The value
of the "Â¦ experiment cannot be overesti-'
mated when the benefit of the traveler is
considered. Only one objection to the
method remains. Oil-soaked, particles of
dust will soil the .clothing, and it be
hooves * the â¢ travelers , to protect their â¢ gar
ments against this damage. Many roads
do not use oil to lay: the dust on this ac
count.âExpress Gazette.

"There is quite a difference between
railroading in the United State.3 and in
Cuba, "and some of the things that are
said about the Cuban railroads are hard
to believe," said a returning traveler tcom
that country. r '?>',: ;
"The Americans, when they first, go to
Cuba, laugh at some of. the practices that
are in vogue in that country, and par
ticularly In the railway service. For in
stance, it sounds very funny to an Amer
ican to read in the passenger tariff that
a third-class passsenger has a right to
carry so. many chickens as luggage in the
third-class, car.
"It is also hard for an American to be
lieve that on some of the older roads the
switch engines in use on the- line are a
team of oxen; but I have photographs
showins such to be the case. The new
road, however, now being built -between
Havana and San Juan will be an Up-to
date line and many of the old customs
Â¦will be done away with."â Express Ga

Bailroading in Cuba.
Just as a man on a bicycle is enabled
to cover more ground than a man on
foot, so is his capacity of travel through
water augmented by the use of the swim
ming machine, which has been recently
designed and patented by a Chicago man.
In fact, the principle of the bicycle seems
to enter largely Into the construction of
the swimming machine. The machine Is
strapped to the operator about his wa'st
and Is held rigidly in place by mean* of
a saddle-like arrangement below, a bar
of adjustable length. In order that it may
be made to suit men of different build,
hanga from, the paddle and is supplied
with pedals revolved by the operator's
feet, and these in turn drive a propeller
of -suitable size. This wheel does air the
work of driving the swimmer through the
water and does the work with much more
facility, and speed. than a man can force
himself through the water unaided..
The Inventor says the weight of the
mechanism Is readily overcome by the ac
tion of the wheel, and that any swimmer
can soon acquire the knack of its Â¦- use.
The buoying tendency of-jthe body and
the weight of the contrivance serve " to
maintain the swimmer at the right angle
to get the best results from the use of
the machine.â Philadelphia Record.

SAN^FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1903.
SIMPLE COUNTRY WOMAN, BELOVED FOR HER CHARITY
AND DOMESTIC VIRTUES, IS FIRST LADY IN FRANCE
'â¢what *â¢ worries he will now -have!" *
Madame Emile Loubet does not take
FIRST LADY IN FRANCE, AND
AMERICAN BRIDE, OF ENG-'
"LISH: AUTHOR/"-.
dignity that pleased them well, and has
done her duty by Paris society as easily
and effectively as if all her life had been
devoted to that sort of thins.
Mme. Loubet belongs to one of the best
bourgeois famll'es of the Drome. Her
maiden name V...8 Picard and until her
marriage in 1869 she lived with her pa
rents at Montelimar. M. Loubet was at
that time a barrister there.
" Montelimar Is quite a commercial town
In these days, noted for Its hats, coal and
nougat But it has a good bit of his
tory transcribed in the pages of its past
and was the scene of much warfare at the
time of the Huguenot troubles. In some
parts of the old town are quaint build
ings and vestiges of the ancient walls
and towers. In all the boxes of nougat
on sale until quite recently a few lines
of poetry were always enclosed affirming
that:
. Montelimar est la Datrie
Des bons coeurs et des bons nougats.
And judging by the interest Mme. Loubet
takes in all charitable works it seems as
though she, has the . proverbial "kind
heart" of which her native town boasts.
A SIMPLE PAIR.
M. Loubefs father owned, a farm near
Marsanne. some, ten miles from Monteli
mar, and was 'Mayor of Marsanne for
thirty-seven years.
â¢ Emile would have taken up farming
willingly, but his father was ambitious
for his two sons and wished one of -them
to study law and the other medicine. '
Â¦ When the President of to-day was a
young man preparing for. his legal exam
inations he had a room on the sixth floor
of a house in Paris just near the Luxem
bourg Palace, where, forty years later,'
he was destined to . live for a time.
M. Loubet,' like his wife, is extremely,
simple in his habits and his dreanv Is to
end his days in the country In the midst,
of his family, with his gun- and plpe v "for*
recreations. It is generally known that
he has bought . a ; chateau, to" which he",
intends to retire ; when hia term of Presi- ?
dency comes to an end, and that Madame*;
looks forward to this chateau as much as*
her husband Â¦ does. This simplicity "runs' Â¦
in the Loubet blood.; Parisians have not
yet i forgotten ; the way in ; which M. -Lou- ['
bet's aged mother took the news of Â¦ the *
honors .which had fallen to the lot of her
son when he^was elected President. ? " ;;â¢'Â¦ '
"Poor fellow," she evclaimed vwhen sh'e' Â¦
read the telegram announcing the event,;.
She Is a famous housewife, economical,
simple and fond of her children; she real
ly cares little for society and looks for
ward to the time when she and her be
loved Emilc may retire from the Elysee,
the French White House, to a quiet farm
Lack in the country whence she came;
yet ehe has Â».ntertalned a long succession
vt kings under her roof with a simple
simple country folk it Is usually
forgotten that, officially, Mme. Loubet
is "the first lady In France." But the
fact that she Is almost never wrltte*n
ebout makes her all the more Interesting,
and, besides, the mistress of the Elysee
Is no ordinary sort of woman.

the country since their marriage, have
now emerged from their honeymoon suf

night or two ago and expect to be at that

Loubet are by no means ostentatious.
The President Is an early riser. HÂ«
usually get3 up between 5 and 8, takes a
cup of chocolate and Is with his family
until 'about 8 or 8:30. He then goes out
for a constitutional with his son. M. Paul
Loubet, who is now about 20 years of age,
a barrister at the Cour d'Appel, and also
a conselller general of the Drome Depart
ment. From about 9:30 to midday the
President attends to state affairs and re
ceives the various embassadors. Prefects,
Mayors. Deputies or Senators who have
requested an audience. At noon luncheon
is served and at about 2 .o'clock, if there
should be no official visit to pay, the
President drives out. sometimes' taking
the reins himself, with the groom mount
ed behind.- and sometimes accompanied
by Mme. Loubet. He dines alone with
his family whenever he can, preferring a
meal of only three courses with a little
light claret. Throughout the evening he
usually reads and smokes steadily.
Mile. Marguerite Loubet, the eldest of
the President's three children, married M.
Soubeyran de Saint- Prise, who Is now a
judge at Marseilles. The youngest boy,
Emile, Is about 11 years old.
Not only does Madame Loubet enter
tain well, but she always welcomes to
the Elysee artists and scientific and lit
erary men. She always accompanies the
President on his visits to the salons and
to the studios of many of the well known
artists. ' She also ..takes a keen interest
In Â¦ women's work of all kinds, and al
though not by any means one of the
"platform women" species, she Is always
willing * to discuss the feminist question.
Furthermore,, she always accompanies
the President to any manifestations In
Madame Loubet is an excellent hostess
despite the gibes of the old aristocracy,
and has proven herself quite equal to the
entertainment of royalties from other
countries. At the time of the exhibition
the kings of Sweden, Greece and Bel
gium, the Bey' of Tunis, the Khedive of
Egypt and the Shah of Persia were all
received by Â» the President and his wife.
and during the Franco-Russian fetes the
Czar and Czarina were delighted with
their reception at the Elysee.
AN EXCELLENT HOSTESS.
On New Year's day she makes a pres
ent in money to a certain number of
widows who ; are left with children to
bring up and who, during the winter sea
son,' find it to make two, ends
meet. It was due to Madame Loubefa
petition to the Prefect of Police that the
vendors of Christmas toys were able to
keep" their stalls upon the boulevard a
week, longer than formerly. It Is general
ly acknowledged that no ' one who Is
worthy appeals to the President's wife
in'vain, and her help is all the more val
uable from the. fact that she takes the
trouble to learn . something about the
charities to which she subscribes so gen
erously.
Madame Loubet is above all, things an
exemplary wife and mother and sha has
made a special point of visiting most of
the creches and dispensaries in all the
various departments of Paris. She has
also been indefatigable in her rounds of
the hospitals, making generous gifts wher
ever she. goes .and invariably carrying
with her to the children's asylums a sup
ply of toys and sweets for distribution.
any active, part in political matters, all
her spare time and energies being devoted
to charitable works. As soon aÂ» she was
installed at the Elvsee Palace sha was
elected president of the Society of the Bed
Cross,- and only a few days later she was
presiding at the meeting of that admir
able "Union of French Women" the ob
ject of which is to train women as sick
nurses. Many ladies of the highest rank
belong to this Union and ambulance work
is specially taught so -that in case of .war
French women of every station in life will
be ready to devote themselves to hospital
service.
Mme. Loubet Longs for Quiet Life

Mr. Chamberlain, the Secretary for the-
Colonies, to establish preferential tariffs
between Great Britain and her dependen

South Africa ia the place for Shake

I could not have been more astonished
had Mrs. Crawley mentioned Milpitas as
an art center, but managed to maintain a
conventional surprise in my "South Af
rica!"
"Indeed, yes," Mrs., Crawley Insisted,'
with complimentary ~ emphasis. "Why,
they will ride a hundred miles In a bul
lock wagon to see a Shakespearean per
formance."
"Think of that for devotion to art! You
were there long?"
"Quite a long time, in the Henry Irving
repertoire. We were the first -company
allowed in Pretoria after, they war and
were in Bloemfont;ein when peace was
declared. But you must not persuade me
to talk of Africa, I shall never stop,"
laughing richly and jingling her barbaric
gold chain, .heavy with tiny ; powder
llasks, soldier buttons and other war tro
phies:
"I am very willing," ,'T said.
"Well," she began, her eyes becoming
deep pools of enthusiasm, "how I wish I
could make you see it, that wonderful,
immense weirdness, Africa! It is tremen
dously beautiful.' When they say to me
in Italy, 'Isn't this lovely?' I want to
say, 'But you should see -Natal!' ; The
great arid stretches of the 'cursed lands,'
the fields of arum lilies, the weird trees
like witches turned -into trees,, crouching
and looming.. The hills are of ; the
strangest, softest purple, and at every
turn you 6ee. the mirage. You know; the
Burne-Jones landscape, queer, old, half
enchanted ? 'There Â» was . his \ country/ I
said when I saw Africa."
"You paint," I challenged her.
"A little, only a very, very little. V
"Oh, yes; I remember! It was in "The
Dancing Girl,' a great big part and a
wonderful cact." '"Lira. Crawley roundly
says "cahst" and "dahncing." ; "It was
in London, too."
"And you have done much Shakespeare
âyou will be the Viola in the 'Twelfth
Night' at Berkeley?" /
"Yes, to both questions," she answered,
"though my first three years were in lit
tle society plays. They were lovely years,
happy and; content,, but I really ought to
have been . slaving . away at- the big
things," she ?. laughed. "I â¢ have played
Juliet and Katharine' quite frequently.
"How did you come to the' theater?"
"Mr. Tree thought I had a. face," she
quaintly put it. .
â¢'He saw you in private theatricals?"
"No; just saw me."
"Your first effortâ you doubtless-;remem

it."
"Mr. Sttevens at the Tlvoll yonder would
have it that everything was taught her."
Mrs. Crawley's eyes blazed incredu
lously as she said: "That's absolutely im
possible. Why," she put it, "it would be
Mrs. Pat's natural Inclination If one said
'do this' to do the other thing. ' Genius
always 'rouses antagonism, you know.
Her wonderful ways are not their ordi
nary ways, and some people can't forgive
her her originality."
"We eeem unable to keep to Mrs. Craw
ley as a subject," I discovered. "Tell me,
you were not born to the stage?"- though
I did not need to ask.
"No; my people are all church and
army persons," Mrs. Crawley replied.
roman I ever saw who could turn white
n the stage. I don't know how she does
VAnd doubtless play?"
"Not at all."
"Then you certainly write?"
"A little, again," less diffidently. "One
can't help that, you know."
"Plays?"
"Yes, madam," humbly. "Do you?"
"Not guiltyâ but we'll return to Africa,"
I decided. "How did you find the peo
ple?"
"Absolutely the most Interesting I have
ever met," she . asserted unhesitatingly.
"The men from up-country, who have
lived in those strange solitudes, seem to
find thoughts there as big and huge as
their hills."
"Did you meet Rhodes?"
"No. I met Mr. Kruger."
"Interesting?"
"Not at all; too unfriendlyâ bews this
way to you"â executing a stiff, Boer sa
lute that would have made even Kruger
Chuckle. "But everybody goes to Africa
now, painters and all sorts of people,"
she went- on. "I should like myself to
play six months of the year in Pieter
maritzburg."
"Well, well." :. ,
"The social life"â was she going to de

out by the really . wonderful success in

"Tho Light That Failed" to the stage

maintained without abatement to the

Without apparently striving for it there
is a delightful atmosphere of reality

" 'Where, moth and rust do corrupt,'
you know. It is moth-eaten," he replied
simply. "The costume is much like Hol

"Isn't it odd," Mrs. Crawley eald, lean-
Ing forward with her luminous smile,
"that twice the fortune-tellers told me not
to come to America, that Death would be

tenderness at the enviable Mr. Crawley.

It could be done quite easily," and Mr.
Crawley grimly picked out a rib or two
with a thin finger.

gasping aloud: "But you're notâ" \

was now smiling at me. Like the other
weak-wltted females I couli not down
a little shiver at the memory of his make

Mrs. Crawley: "I couldn't use the other

She nodded a thoughtful "no," and I
asked: "That isâ"
"Everybody says the same thing," Mrs.
Crawley said, with a radiantly good-na

semblance to Mrs. Campbell Is Indeed
mest marked. The chin Is IJongerâ the
face has the Georges Sand, the George
Eliot length â and the eyes are rounder,
but these are as nothing compared with
the resemblance. She is somberly haired
like Mrs. Campbell, the black, nltent
waves curving from a face as warmly
white as Mrs. Pat's own. The eyes are of
the same proud brown, but without the
shadowed deeps of the Campbell orbs.
They have, too, the same wide, gracious,,
wondering gaze on occasion and the
eame trick of turning blue on the stage.
Her lips, as finely scarlet, catch the
Campbell melancholy in their delicately
drooping corners, and open â more fre
quently â on teeth as pretty.
And again there Is the characteristic
walk, the same miracle of movement
without a suggestion of its machinery.
Mrs. Crawley has, too, the Campbell
genius for lounging, and as she leaned
back among her cushions in her white,
thin, silken waist, that left the neck bare
and hung in careless clouds from the
arms, I could easily imagine Mrs. Pat be

There was talk then, and more later of
Mrs. Campbell, and then I asked If there
had been any more fragilely minded wo

"Why, have there been some women

asked, much interested.
"Four that I know of," I replied.

represent the Christ very effectively by
a light," I recalled.
"Apropos, I wonder why we have Botti

"he is the most wonderful person, you
know."
"Still, there were features of the Berke
