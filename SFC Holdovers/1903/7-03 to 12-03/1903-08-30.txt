From the window she watched him
swing off down the street, wondering if
he would turn to wave his hand to her,
his custom for years. But the broad
back was straight and uncompromising.
Ills long strides carried him swiftly out
of Eight, but It was many minutes be
fore she turned her eyes, which were
smarting, a little from the point where
he was lost In the crowd. The room
looked eshen to her as she brought her
mind back to it, and somehow things had
grown difficult.
When Montgomery re-ached home he
found this telegram from Mr. Jones.

"This evening?"
"I can't wait," Monty said as he rose
to go. "rm glad you're pleased, Peggy:
I need your good wishes. And Peggy,"
hÂ« continued, with a touch of boyish
wlstfulness, "do you think there's a
chance for a fellow? I've had the very

Jt was not quite easy for her to say,
"Monty, you are the best in the world.

"You. Monty V ehe said. Incredulously.
"I've got It bad. Peggy." he replied,
Â¦taring hard at the floor. She could not
tindensta.nd,the cold, gray tone that tud
denly enveloped the room. The strange
sense of loneliness that came over her
was Inexplicable. The little something
that rose In her throat would not be dis
lodged, nor could she throw off the
weight that seemed pressing down upon
her. He saw the odd look In her eyes and
the drawn, uncertain smile on her lips,
but he attributed them to wonder and in
credulity. Somehow, after all these
years, he was transformed before her
very eyes; che was looking upon a new
personality. He was no longer Mont
gomery, the brother, but she could not
explain how and when the change crept
over her. What did It all nean? "I am
very glad If It will make you happy,
Monty," she said slowly, the gray in her
lips giving way to red once more. "Does
she know?"
She looked into his eyes dully for an in
stant, not realizing the full Importance of
his confession.
"HÂ«-'s a bounder," he argued.
"Wejl, don't take It to heart. You don't
have to marry him," and Peggy laughed.
"But I do take it Ut bjeart, Peg*y,"
eaid Monty, seriously. "I'm pretty hard
bit. and I want your help. A sister's ad
vice is always the beet In a matter of tnla
Â«ort."
Following his habit In trouble he
sought Margaret Gray, to whom he ccUld
always appeal for advice and consolation.
Ehe was to come to his next dinner party,
and It was easy to lead up to the subject
In hand by mentioning the other giusts.
"And Barbara Drew," he concluded,
after naming all the others. They were
alone in the library, and she was drink
ing in the details cf the dinner as be re
lated them.
"Wasn't she at your first dinner?" efie
asked, quickly.
He successfully affected mild embar
rassment.
"Yes."
"She must be very attractive." There
was no venom In Peggy's heart.
"She is attractive. In fact, she's one
of the best, Peggy." he said, paving the
way.
"It's too bad she 6eerns to car* for that
little Duke."

charity. Old Jones might call It needless

There was a gleam In his eyes that
made her pose of Indifference .difficult;'
the fervor of his half-whispered words
took possession of her. She had expected
sentiment of such a different character
that his frank confession disarmed her
completely. Beneath his ardent, abrupt
plea there was assurance, the confi
dence of one who Is not to be denied. It
was not what he had said, but the way he
had Â»ald it. A wave of^exultatlon swept
over her. tingling through every, nerve.
Under the spell her resolution* to dally
lightly with his emotion suffered a check
that almost brought Ijrnomlnlous surren

charge against her heart, but she was rap-

he did not know that he was losing
ground with each step he took â¢ forward.
Barbara Drew loved Brewster; but: she
was going to make him pay dearly for tha
brief lapse her composure had expe

again the Miss Drew who had been
trained in the ways of the world, and not
the young girl In love. Â¦ .

"I was beginning to despair, Monty,"
cald Miss Drew, reproachfully, when he
had come down from the height of his
exasperation and remembered that there
were things of more Importance.
The light In his eyes brought the faint
est tinge of red to her cheeks, and .wherÂ«
a moment before there had been annoy
ance, there was now a feeling of serenity.
For a moment the silence was fraught
with purpose. Monty glanced around the
room, uncertain how to begin. It was not
so easy as he imagined. \
Just before leaving -kU apartments for
Miss Drew's home he received ' this re

BREWSTER'S MILLIONS.

"hold-lip", at the club, but he did not re

was a new public commissioner who was
aggressive in his efforts, at reform. Ac

headquarters . the next morning for the
purpose : of .looking over the "suspects"
that had been brought In. Almost ,tne
first . man that he espied was a rough
looking fellow whose Identity could not
be mistaken. It waa BUI.
"Hello, BUI," called Monty, gaily. Bill

eyes had such an appeal In them that
Monty relented. "
"You know this fellow, Mr. Brewster?*
demanded the . captain, - quickly. Bill
looked utterly, helpless. : .;

CHRISTMAS DESPAIR.
:. Brewster found his coat a few minutes
later, and went whistling away into the
night The roll of bills was gone.
"We'H leave de coat at de next cor
ner, pardner. It's cold, and you need it
more'n we\do. You're ( de limit, you are.
So Jong. Walk right straight ahead and
don't yell."
Monty's coat, came off in a Jiffy and
he stood shivering before the dnm
founded robbers.
"Well, I hate to do It, boss, but I guess
we'll just take de overcoat and all. It
looks like a trick and we takes no
chances. . Off wld de coat"

not to conquer.. He regarded the Call
fornlan as an impostor and summary ac
tion was necessary. "I know all about
him, Babs," he said one day after he felt
sure of his position. "Why., his father'
was hono"red by the V. C, on the coast in
â¢49."
"The Victoria Cross?" asked Barbara
innocently. '
"No, the vigilance committee."
In this way Monty routed the enemy
and cleared the field before tfie end of an
other week. Grimes transferred his objec
tionable affection and Barbara was not
even asked to be wife number three.
Brewster'B campaign was s.o ardent that
he neglected other duties deplorably, fall
ing far behind his improvident average.
With Grimes disposed of, he once more
forsook the battlefield pf love and gave
his harassed and undivided attention to
his own peculiar btsjlness:
The fast-and-loose game â¢ displeased
MIes Barbara greatly. She was at first
surprised, then piqued, then resentful.
Monty gradually awoke to the distressing'
fact that she was going to be intractable,
as he put it. and â¢forthwith undertook to'
smooth the troubled sea. To his amaze
ment and concern she was not, to be ap
peased. * . -
"Does it occur to you, Monty," she said,
with a gentle coldness that was Infinitely,
worse than heat, "that you have been
carrying things with a pretty high hand?
Where did you acquire the right to inter
fere with my privileges? You seem to
think that I am not to speak to any man
but you,"
"Oh, come now, Babs," retorted Monty;
"I've not been quite as unreasonable as
that And you know yourself that Grimes
is the worst kind of a bounder." ,
"I -know nothing of the sort," replied
the lady, with growing irritation. "You
say that of every man who gives me a
smile or a flower. Does it indicate such
atrocious' taste?" (Â¦
"Don't be silly, Barbara. You know
perfectly ' well that you have talked to
Gardner and that Idiot Valentine by the
hour and I've not said a word. But there
are some things I can't stand, and the
Impertinence of Grimes Is one of Â¦ them.
Jove! he looked at you out of those fishy
eyes sometimes as though he owned you.
If you knew how many times I've fairly
ached to knock him down!"
Inwardly Barbara' was' weakening a
little before his masterfulness. But she
gave no sign. ' , :
"And it never occurred to 'you," she
said, with that exasperating coldness of
the voice,' "that I was equal to the situa
tion. I suppose you thought Mr.. Grimes
had . only to beckon arid I would joyfully
answer. I'll have you know, Monty
Brewster, right now, that I am quite able
to choose my. friends and to handle them.

his strenuous career.*' than you ever

' Brewster refused the money, but took
back his watch.
"Keep It BUI," he said, "you need it
more than I do. It's enough to set you
up In some other trade. Why not try
it?" v:;;.v
"I will try, boss," and Bill was so pro
fuse In his thanks that Monty had diffi
culty In getting away. As he climbed
into a cab he heard . Bill say, Â¦ "I will
try, boss,, and say, If ever I can do any
thing for you, jes' put me nex\ I'm
nex* you all de time."
He grave the driver the name of his
club, but as he was passing the Waldorf
he remembered that he had several
things to say to Mrs. Dan. The order
was changed, and a few moments later
he waa received In Mrs. Dan's very spe
cial den.. She wore something soft and
graceful in lavender, something that was
light and wavy and evanescent, and
made you watch it3 changing shadows.
Monty looked down at her with the feel
ing that she made a very effective pic
ture.
"You are looking pretty fit this morn*
Ing, my lady," he said by way of pre
amble. "How well everything plays up
to you."
"And you are unusually courtly, Mon
ty," she smiled. "Has the world treated
you so generously of late?"
"It Is treating me generously enough
Just now to make up for anything," and
he looked at her. "Do you know, Mrs.
Dan, that It ls'borne In upon me now and
then that there- are things that are quite
worth while?"
"Oh, if "you come to that," she an
swered, lightly, "everything Is worth
while. For you, Monty, life la certainly
not slow. You can dominate; you can
make things go your way. Aren't" they
going your way now, Monty"â thla more
seriouslyâ "What's wrong? Is the pace
too fast?"
His mood Increased upon him with her
sympathy. "Oh, no." he said. "It isn't
that You are goodâ and I'm a selfish
beast ; Things are perverse and people
are desperately obstinate sometimes. And
here I'm taking it out on you. You are
not perverse. You are not obstinate
You are a ripper, Mrs. Dan. and you are
going to help me out In more ways than
one.",
"Well, to pay for all these gallantries,
Monty, I ought to do much. I'm your
friend through thick and thin. You have
only to command, me." Â¦
"It was precisely. to get your help that
I came In. I'm tired of those confounded
dinners. You know yourself that they
are all alikeâ the same people, the same
flowers, the same things to eat -and the
same inane twaddle in the shape of talk
Who cares-about them, anyway?"
"Well, I like that." she Interrupted.
"After all the thought I put Into those
dinners, after all the variety I so care
fully'secured! My dear boy, you are
frightfully ungrateful," Â¦ *
VOh, you know what I mean. And you
know quite as well as I do that It is per
fectly true. The dinners were a beastly
bore, which proves that they were a loud
success. Your, work was not done In vain.
But now I want something else. We
Monty Brewster had something like
$200,000 in Colonel Drew's bank. He would
not have regretted on his own. account
the collapse of this Institution, but ha
realized what It meant to the hundreds
of other depositors, and for the first time
he appreciated what his money could ac
complish. Thinking that his presence
might eive confidence to the other de
positors and stop the run he went over
to the bank with Harrison and Brag
don. The tellers were banding out thou
sands of dpllars to the eager depositors.
His friends advised him strongly to with-
When the bank opened for business on
the Tuesday following the failure there
was a stampede of frightened depositors.
Before 11 o'clock the run had assumed
ugly proportions and no amount of argu
ment could stay the onslaught Colonel
Drew and the directors, at first mildly
distressed, and then seeing that the af
fair had become serious, grew more
alarmed than they could afford to let
the public see. / The loans of all of the
banks were unusually large. Incipient
runs on some had put all of them in an
attitude of caution and there was a nat
ural reluctance to expose their own In
terests to Jeopardy by coming to the re
lief of the Bank of Manhattan Island.
It was while Brewster was In tnÂ«
depths of despair that his financial af
fairs had a windfall. One of the banks
In which his money waa deposited failed
and his balance of over $100,000 was wiped
out Mismanagement was the cause, and
the collapse came on Friday, the thir
teenth day of the month. Needless ta
say it destroyed every vestige ef the su
perstition he may have had regarding
Friday and the number thirteen.
Brewster had money deposited ia five
banks, a transaction Inspired- by the wild
hope that one of them might some day
suspend operations and thereby prove a
legitimate benefit to him. There seemed
no prospect that the bank could resume
operations, and If the depositors in the
end realized 20 cents on the dollar they
would be fortunate. Notwithstanding the
fact that everybody had considered the
Institution substantial there were not a
few wiseacres who called Brewster a fool
and were so unreasonable as to say that
he did not know how to. handle money.
He heard that Miss Drew, In particular,
was bitterly sarcastic in referring to his
stupidity.
This failure caused a tremendous flurry
in banking circles. It was but natural
that questions concerning the stability
of other banks should be asked, and it
was not lonjr before many wild, disquiet
ing reports were afloat Anxious deposi
tors rushed into the big banking Insti
tutions and then .rushed out again, par
tially assured that there was no danger.
The newspapers sought to allay the fears
of the people, but there were many to
whom fear became panic. There were
short, wild runs on some of the smaller
banks, but all were In a fair way to re
store confidence when out came the ru
mor that the Bank of Manhattan Island
waa In trouble. Colonel Prentlss Drew,
railroad magnate, -was the president of
this bank.

enough to scrap about it. Don't hit me
or shootâ that's all. Be quick about it,
because I'll take cold .If my overcoat Is

night?" Brewster was' to all Intents and
purposes the calmest man lit New York.
"Fierce!" said the one wno was doing
the searching. "You're the first, guy
we've seen In a week that looks good."
"I hope you won't -be, '-'disappointed,"
said Monty, genially. ", "If I'd expected this
I might have brought more money."..
Monty's Tack its he left the howse. â¢ ne
was thoroughly wretched. Â¦
"Throw up your hands!" came hoarsely
from somewhere, and there was ho ten
derness In the tones. For an : Instant
Monty was dazed and bewildered, but in
the next he saw two shadowy figures
walking beside him. "Stop where you
are, young fellow," was the next com
mand, and he stopped, short He was in
a mood to fight, but the sight of a revol
ver made him think again. Monty was
not a coward, neither was he a fool. Ho

madness.
"What do you want?" he demanded as
coolly as his nerves would permit. .
"Put up your hands, quick!" and he has
tily obeyed the injunction. \i
\ "Not a sound out of you or you get It
good and proper. You know what we
want. Get to work, Bill; I'll watch' his
handB." .' â¢ - . ' ' Â¦
Rawles added to his despair a day or
two after the Stock Exchange misfortune.
He brought up'the Information that six
splendid little puppies .had come to bless
his Boston terrier family, and Joe Brag
don, who was present, enthusiastically
predicted that he could get $100 apiece for
them. Brewster loved dogs, yet for one
single horrible moment he longed to mas
sacre the helpless little creatures. But
the old affection came back to him, and
he hurried out with Bragdon to Inspect
the brood.
"And I've either got to sell them or kill
them," he groaned. Later on he in
structed Bragdon to sell the pups for $25
apiece, and went away, ashamed to look
their proud mother in the face.
Fortune smiled on him before the day
was over, however. He took "Subway"
Smith for a ride In the "Green Jugger
naut," bad weather and bad roads not
withstanding. Monty lost control of the
machine and headed for a subway excava
tion. He and Smith saved themselves by
leaping to the pavement, sustaining slight
bruises, but the great machine crashed
through the barricade and dropped to the
bottom of the trench far below. To
Smith's pripf and Brewster's delight the
automobile was hopelessly ruined, a clear
loss of many thousands. Monty's joy
was Bh*ort-lived, for it was soon learned
that three luckless workmen down in the
depths had been badly Injured by the
preen meteor from above. The mere fact
that Brewster could and did pay liber
ally for the relief of the poor fellows af
forded him little consolation. His care
lessness, and possibly his Indifference, had
brought suffering to these men and their
families which was not pleasant to look
back upon. Lawsuits were avoided by
compromises. Each, of the Injured men
received $4000.
At this time every one was Interested in
the charity bazaar at the Astoria, Society
was on exhibition, and the public paid for
the privilege of gazing at the men and
women whose names filled the society col
umns. Brewster frequented the booth pre
sided over by Miss Drew, and there
seemed to be no end to his philan
thropy. The bazaar lasted two days and
nights, and after that period his account
book showed an even "profit" of nearly
$3000. Monty's serenity, however, was
considerably ruffled by the appearance of
a new and aggressive claimant for the
smiles of the fair Barbara. He was a Cal-
Brewster bobbed uncertainly between
two emotionsâ elation and distress. He
had achieved two kinds of successâ Â«the
desired and the undesired. It was but
natural that he should feel proud of the
distinction the venture had brought to
him on one hand, but there was reason
for despair over the acquisition of $50,000.
It made it necessary for him to under
take an almost superhuman featâ Increase
the number of his January bills. The plans
for the ensuing spring and summer were
dimly getting into shape and they cov
ered many startling projects. Since con
fiding some of them to "Nopper" Harri
son, that gentleman had worn a never
decreasing look of worry and anxiety in
his eres. /Â¦ Â¦
It was not that he had realized heavily

Email, as things go on the Exchange in
these days. The mere fact that he had
shown such foresight proved sufficient
cause for the reversal of opinion. Men
looked at him with new interest in their
eyes, with fresh confidence. His unfor
tunate operations in the stock market
had restored him to favor In all circles.
The man. young or old, who could do
what he had done with Lumber and Fuel
well deserved the new promises that were
being made for him.
XI.
COALS OF FIRE
Gardner, dazed and weak, began selling
and finally liquidated the full line at
prices ranging from 114 to 122^. but Mont
gomery Brewster had cleared 158.550, and
all because It was he and not the market
that got excited.
"Tou're a wonder, Monty! I'll see you
after the close. How the devil did you
do it?" shouted Gardner.
"What's the price now?" asked Brew
ster.
"One thirteen and three-fourths, and
going up all the time. Hooray!"
"Do you think she'll go down again?"
demanded Brewster.
"Not If I can help it."
"Very well then, go and sell out,*:
roared Brewster. ,Â¦ '
"But she's polng U p likeâ"
"Sell, damn you! Didn't yau hear?"
In ten minutes' time Lumber and Fuel
was again up to 113 and soaring. Brew
ster. panic-stricken, rushed to the tele
phone and called up Gardner.
The brokÂ«r. hoarse with excitement,
was delighted when he recognized Brew-
Eter's voice.
"You sly dog," said the Colonel, dig
ging Monty In the side.- "I had confi
dence in you all the time."
The bystanders were beginning to be
disgusted. "It was only a fluke after
all," they said to each other. Colonel
Drew was appealed to to urge Monty to
save himself and he was on the ooint of
remonstrance when the message came
that the threatened strike was off. and
that the men were willing to aibltrate.
Almost before one could draw breath this
startling news began to make Itself felt
The certainty of a great strike was one
of the things that had made Brewster
cure that the price could not hold. With
this danger removed there was nothing
to jeopardize the" earning power of the
stock. The next quotation was a point
higher. ; > ; ;,,v
When Brewster's bewildered eyes, raced
over the figures the stock was quoted at
111. His sigh of relief was heard but mis
understood. He might be saved after all.
The stock bad started to ro dewn and
there seemed no reason why It should
stop. As he Intended to purchase no
more It was fair to assume that the back
bono was at the breaking point. The
crash was bound to come. He could
hardly restrain a cry of Joy. Evtn while
he stood at the ticker the little Instru
ment began to tell of a further decline.
As the price went <Bown his hopes went
up- ;Â¦Â«
along came this sensational order for ten
thousand shares; and there could be | but
one result. At one time In tba morning
Lumber and Fuel, traded in by excited
holders, touched 113V4 and seemed In a
fair way to' hold firm around that figure.
Othe.* men came. up and listened eager
ly. Brewster realized that his dash in
Lumber and Fuel had been a. master
stroke of cleverness when considered from
the point of view of these men, but a
catastrophe from his own.
"I hope you sold It when It was at the
top." said the colonel excitedly.
"X Instructed Gardner to sell only when
I gave the word," said Monty, lamely.
Several of the men looked at him in sur
prise and disgust
"Well, If I were you I'd tell him to sell,"
remarked the colonel coldly. Â»
"The effect of your plunge has 'worn
off, Brewster, and the other side will
drive the prices down. They won't be
caught napping again, either," said one of
the bystanders earnestly.
"Do you think so?" And there was a
note of relief In Monty's voice.
From all sides came the advice to sell
at once, but Brewster was not to be
pushed. He calmly lighted a cigarette
and with an assured air of wisdom told
them to wait a little while and see.
"She's already falling off," said some
one at the tickÂ«r.
"How did you do it. my boy?" cried
the colonel. "She's off a point or two
now, I believe, but half an hour ago she
was booming. Gad, I never heard of
anything more spectacular!"
Monty's heart was In his moutfe as he'
rushed over to the ticker. It did not take
him long to grasp the Immensity of the
disaster. Gardner had bought In at JOSÂ«Â£.
and that very action seemed to put new
life into the stock. Just as it was on the
point of breaking for lack ef support
Colonel Drew's dignity relaxed amaz
ingly when he caught sight of the young
man. He came forward to meet him and
his greeting almost carried Monty off his
feet.
Somewhere far back in his inner self
there seemed to be the sound of cheer-
Ing and the clapping of hands. Shortly
before noon he reached his club, where
he was to lunch with Colonel Drew. In
the reading-room he observed that men
were looking at him in a manner less
casual than was customary. Some of
them went so far as to smile encourag
ingly, and others waved their hands In
the most cordial fashion. Three or four
very young members looked upon him with
admiration and envy and even the porters
seemed more obsequious. : There was
something strangely oppressive In all this
show of deference.
"Gardv, I've gone # into this thing care
fully, and if ever a man felt' sure about
anything I do about this." said Monty,
tlecUledly but affectionately.
"Take my word for it. Lumber can't
go ar.y higher. Think of the situation;
the lumbermen in the North and West
are overstocked, and there is a strike
ready to go into effect. When that comes
the Â«?tock will go for a song. The slump
Is liable to begin any day."
"My mind is made up," said the other
firmly, and Gardner was In despair. "Will
you or will you not execute an order for
xnÂ» at the opening to-morrow? Til start
Â¦with 10,000 shares. What will it cost me
to margin It for ten points?"
"At least a hundred thousand. excJu
slve of commission, which would be
twelve and a half a hundred shares."
Despite the most strenuous opposition
from Gardner. Brewster adhered to his
design, and the broker executed the order
the next morning. He knew that Brewster
had but one chance to win, and that was
to buy the stock in a lump Instead of uls
tributing It among several brokers and
throughout the session. This was a point
that Monty had overlooked.
There had been lltUe to excite tbe-Stock
Exchange for some weeks; nothing was
active and the slightest flurry was hailed
os an event. Every one knew that tha
calm would be disturbed at 6ome next
day. but nobody looked for a sensaicn
In Lumber and Fuel. It was a foregene
conclusion that a slump was. coming and
there was scarcely any trading tn the
stock. When Elon Gardner, acting for
Montgomery Brewster, took ten thousand
chares at lCS^i there was a mighty gasp
or. the exchange, then a rubbing of eyes,
then commotion. Astonishment was fol
lowed by r.trvGUsness, and then came t">e
struggle.
Brewster. confident that the stock could
go no higher, and that sooner or later It
mast drop, calmly ordered his horse for
a ride In the snow covered park. Even
though hÂ« knew the venture was to be a
failure in the ordinary sense he found
joy in the knowledge that he was doing
something. He might be a fool, he was
at least no longer Inactive. The feel of
the air was good to him. He was exhila
rated by the glitter of the snow, the an
swering excitement of his horse, the gay
ety and sparkle of life about him.
"Good heavens. Monty," cried the
broker, "you're joking. Lumber Is away
up now. It can't possibly go a fraction
01 a point higher. Take my advice and
don't touch it. It opened to-day at 111%
and closed at 103. Why, man, you're crazy
to think about it for an instant."
"1 know my business, Gardner," said
Brewster quietly, and his conscience
smote him when he saw the flush of mor
tification creep Into the face of his trlend.
The rebuke had cut Gardner to the quick.
"But, Mont, I know what I'm talking
about. At least let me tell you some
thing about this stock," pleaded Elon,
loyally, despite the wound.
"With this project in mind he decided to
cause a little excitement In Wall street.
For some days he stealthily watched the
stock market and plied his friends with
questions about values. Constant reading
and observation finally convinced him that
Lumber and Fuel Common was the one
stock In which he could safely plunge.
Casting aside all apprehension, so far as
Swearengen Jones was concerned, he pre
pared for whit was to be bis one and

With all the cunning and craftiness of a
general he laid his plans for the "attack.
Gardner's face wag the picture of despair
when Brewster asked him to buy heavily
in Lumber and Fuel.
Monty's attitude was not due to any
waning cS, his affection, but to the very
tinromantlo business In which he was en
gaged. Zt seemed to him that, plan as
hi rn^ht, be could not devise fresh ways
*lti4 means to earn $16,090 a day. He was
still eomfortably ahead in the race, but
9. famine fix opportunities was not far
remote. Ten big dinner parties and a
wiring of elaborate after-the-play suppers
maintained* fair but Insufficient average,
an3 he could see that the time was ripe
for radical 'measures. He could not go
on forever with his dinners. People were
already beginning to refer to the fact that
he was wanning his toes on the social
register, and he had no desire to become
ihe laughing-stock of the town. The few
flighting, sarcastic remarks about his
business ability, chiefly by women, and
therefore reflected from the men, hurt
him. Miss Drew's apparently harmless
taunt and Mrs. Dan's open criticism told
plainly enough how the wind was blow
ing, but it was Peggy's gentle questions
that cut the deepest. There was such
honest concern in her voice that he could
pee how his profligacy was troubling her
and Mrs. Gray. In their eyes, more than
In the others, he felt ashamed and humil
iated. Finally, goaded by the remark of
a bank director which he overheard. "Ed
win P. Brewster is turning handsprings
in his grave over the way he is going it,"
Monty resolved to redeem himself In the
eyes of his critics. He would show them
that his brain was not wholly given over
to frivolity. â¢ , Â¦-Â£?:
that "a man who
wins a girl after an ardent suit is often
Ilk* one who runs after a streetcar and
then sits down to read his paper."
In truth, after the first few days Monty
reemed to have forgotten his competitors

his assured position. Each day hÂ« sent

He vied with Brewster In patronising
Barbara's booth, and he rushed Into the
conflict with an impetuosity that seemed
destined to carry everything before It.
Monty was brushed aside, Barbara was
pre-empted, as if she were a mining claim
and ten days after his arrival. In New
York, Grimes was the most talked of man
in town. Brewster was not the sort to be
dispatched without a struggle, however.
Recognizing Grimes as an obstacle, but
not as a rival, he once more donned his
armor and beset Barbara with all the test
of a champion who seeks to protect and
ifornlan of Immense wealth and unbound
ed confidence In himself, and letters to
people in New York had given him. a cer
tain : entree. The triumphs in love and
finance that had come with his two score
years and ten had demolished every ves
tige of timidity that may have been born
with him. He was successful enough In
the world of finance to have become four
or five times a millionaire, and he had
fared bo well In love that twice he had
been a widower. Rodney Grimes was
starting out to win Barbara with the
same dash and Impulsiveness that over
came Mary Farrell, the cook in the min
ing-camp, and Jane Boothroyd, the
school-teacher, who came to California
ready to marry the first man who asked
her. He was a .penniless prospector,

Jane to the altar she rejoiced in having

He left the hoiwe with his head high in
the air,: angry red in his cheeks, and a
feeling In his heart that she was' the,
most unreasonable of women. Barbara,
in the meantime, cried herself to sleep,

Her reference to Christmas haunted
Brewster as he drove down Fifth avtnue,
with the dread of a new disaster. Never
before had he looked upon presents as a
calamity; but this year It was diffexent.
Immediately he began to plan a bombard

THE SUNDAY CALL.
2THE SUNDAY . CALIi.
draw before It was too late, but Monty
was obdurate. They set it down to his
desire to help Barbara's father and ad
mired hlÂ» nerve.
-I understand, Monty," said Bragdon,
and bcth he and Harrison went among
the people carelessly asking one another
If Brewster bad come to withdraw his
money. "No. be has over $200,000, and
he's going to leave it." the other would
say.
Each excited group was visited In turn
by the two men, but their assurance
seemed to accomplish but little. * These
men and women were there to save their
fortunes: the situation was desperate.
Colonel Drew, outwardly calm and se
rene, but inwardly perturbed, finally saw
Erewster and his companions. He sent a
messenger over with the request that
Monty come to tha president's private
office at once.
"He wants to help you to save your
money," cried Bragdon in low tones.
"That shows it's all up."
"Get out every dollar of it Monty, and
don't waste a minute. It's a smash as
sure as fate." urged Harrison, a feverish
expression in his eyes.
Breirstcr was admitted to the colonel's
private office. Drew was alone and was
pacing the floor like a caged anlmai.
"Sit down, Brewster, and don't mind
If I eeem nervous. Of course we can hold
out. but It is terribleâ terrible. They
think we are trying to rob them. They're
madâ utterly mad."
"I never saw anything Ilka it colonel.
Are you sure you can meet all tha de
mands?" asked Brewster. thoroughly ex
cited. Tha colonel's face was white and
he chewed his cigar nervously.
"We can win out unless some of our
heaviest depositors get the fever and
ewoop down upon us. I appreciate your
feelings In an affair of this kind, coming
eo swiftly upon the heels of the other, but
I want to give you my personal assurance
that the money you have here Is safe. I
called you in to Impress you with the se
curity of the bank. You ought to know
the truth, however, and I will tell you in
confidence that another check like Aus
tin's, which we paid a few minutes ago,
would cause us serious, though tempo
rary, embarrassment"
"I came to assure you that I hava not
thought of withdrawing my deposits from
this bank, coloneL You need have no un
easinessâ"
The door opened suddenly and one of
the officials of tha bank bolted inside, his
face as white as death. He started to
epeak before he saw Brewster, and then
closed his Hps despairingly.
"What is it, Mr. Moore?" asked Drew,
as calmly as possible. "Don't mind Mr.
Brewster."
"Oglethorp wants to draw two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars," said Moore
in strained tones.
"Well, he can have it can't he?" asked
the colonel quietly. Moore looked help
lessly at the president of tha bank, and
his silence spoke more plainly than words.
"Brewster, it looks bad," said the colo
nel, turning abruptly to the young man.
"The other banks are afraid of a run and
we can't count on much help from them.
Some of them have helped us and others
have refused. Now I not only ask you to
refrain from drawing out your deposit,
but I want you to help us in this crucial
moment." The colonel looked twenty
years older and his voice shook percepti
bly. Brewster's pity went out to him in
a flash.
"What can I do. Colonel Drew?" he
cried. "I'll not take my money out but I
don't know how I can be of further assist,
ance to you. Command me. sir."
"You can restore absolute confidence,
Monty, my dear boy. by increasing your
deposits in our bank." said tha colonel
slowly and as If dreading the fate of the
suggestion.
"You mean, sir, that I can sava tha
bank by drawing my money from other
tanks and putting it here?" asked Monty,
slowly. He was thinking harder and
faster than he had ever thought in his
life. Could be afford to risk the loss of
his entire fortune on the fate of this
bank? What would Swearengen Jones say
if he deliberately deposited a vast amount
of money in a tottering institution like
the Bank of Manhattan Island? It would
ba tha maddest folly on his part If tho
back went down. There could ba no miti
gating circumstances in the eyes of
either Jones or the world If be swamped
all of his money In this crisis.
"I beg of you, Monty, help us." The
colonel's pride 'was gone. "It means dis
grace if we close our doors even for an
hour; It means a stain that only years
can remove. You can restore confidence
by a dozen strokes of your pen and you
can save us."
Ha was Barbara's father. The proud
old man was before him as a suppliant
no longer the cold man of the world.
Back to Bra water's mind came the
thought of his quarrel with Barbara and
of her fceartlessness. A scratch of the
pen, one way or the other, could change
the life of Barbara Drew. The two bank,
ers stood fiercely breathing. From
outside came tha shuffle of many feet
and tha muffled roll of voices. Again
the door of the private office
opened and a clerk excitedly motioned
for Mr. Moore to hurry to tha front of
tha bank. Moore paused Irresolutely, his
â¢yes on Brewster's face. The young man
knew tha time had come when he must
help or deny them.
Like a flash the situation was made
clear to him and his duty was plain. He
remembered that tha Bank of Manhattan
Island held every dollar that Mrs. Gray
and 'Peggy possessed; their meager for
tune had been entrusted to the care of
Prentlss Drew and his associates, and
It was In danger.
"I will do all I can, colonel," said Mon
ty, "but upon one condition."
"That Is?"
"Barbara must never know of this."
The colonel's gasp of astonishment was
cut short as Monty continued. "Promise
that she shall never know."
"I don't understand, but tf It is your
wish I promise."
Inside of half an hour's time several
hundred thousand came to the relief of
the struggling bank and tha man who
had come to watch tha run with curious
eyes turned out to be Its savior. His
money won the day for the Bank of Man
hattan Island. When the happy president
and directors offered to pay him an as
tonishingly high rate of Interest for the
use of the money he proudly* declined.
The next day Miss Drew issued Invita
tions for a cotillon. Mr. Montgomery
Brewster was not asked to attend.
XIV.
MRS. DB MILLE ENTERTAINS.
Miss Drew's cotillon was not graced by
the presence of Montgomery Brewster.
It Is true he received an eleventh-hour in
vitation and a very cold and difficult lit
tle note of apology, but he maintained
heroically the air of disdain that had suc
ceeded the first sharp pangs of disappoint
ment. Colonel Drew, In whose good
graces Monty had firmly established him
self, was not quite guiltless of usurping
the role of dictator In the effort to patch
up a truce. A few nights before the cotil*
Ion, when Barbara told him that Herbert
Ailing was to lead, he explosively ex
pressed surprise, "Why not Monty Brew
ster, Babs?" he demanded.
"Mr. Brewster is not coming," she re
sponded calmly.
"Going to be out of town?" Â»
"I'm 6ure I don't know," stiffly.
"What's this?"
"He has not been asked, father." Miss
Dtew was not in good humor.
"Not asked?" said the colonel in amaze
ment. "It's ridiculous, Babs; send him an
invitation at once."
"This Is my dance, father, and I don t
want to aak Mr. Brewster."
The colonel sank back in his chair and
struggled to overcome his anger. Ha
knew that Barbara had inherited his will
fulness and had long since discovered
that it was best to treat her with tact
"I thought you and he wereâ" but the
colonel's supply of tact was exhausted.
"We were"â In a moment 1 " of absent
mindedness. "But it's all over," said
Barbara.
"Why, child, there wouldn't have been
a cotillon If It hadn't been forâ" but the
colonel remembered his promise to Mon
ty and checked himself Just In time. "Iâ
I mean there will not ba any party if
Montgomery Brewster is not asked. That
iÂ» all I care -to say on the subject," and
he stamped out of the room.
Barbara wept copiously after her father
had gone, but she realized that his will
was law and that Monty must ba Invited.
"I will send an invitation." she said to
herself, "but if Mr. Brewster comes after
he has read It I shall be surprised."
Montgomery, however, did not receive
the note in the spirit in which it had
been sent. He only saw in it a ray or
hope that Barbara was relenting and was
Jubilant at the prospect of a reconcilia
tion. The next 8unday he sought an in
terview with Miss Drew, but she received Â»
him with Icy reserve. If he had thought
to punish her by staying away it was evi
dent that she felt equally responsible for
a great deal of misery on his part Both
had been more or less unhappy, and both
were/ resentfully obstinate. Brewster felt
hurt/ and Insulted, while she felt that
he *ad imposed upon her disgracefully.
He was now ready to cry quits and it
surprised him to find her obdurate. If he
had expected to dictate the terms of peace
he was woefully disappointed when she
treated his advances with cool contempt.
"Barbara, you know I care very much
for you," he was pleading, fairly on the
road to submission. "I am sure you are
not quite indifferent to me. This foolish
misunderstanding must really be as dis
agreeable to you as it Is to me." â
"Indeed," she replied, llfjjpg her brows
disdainfully. "You ara assuming a good
deal, Mr. Brewster."
"I am merely recalling the fact that
you once told me you cared. You would
not promise anything. I know, but it
meant much that you cared. A little dif
ference could not have changed your
feeling completely."
"When you are ready to treat me with
respect I may listen to your petition,"
she said, rising haughtily.
"My petition?" He did not Ilka tha
word and his tact quite deserted him.
"It's as much yours as mine. Don't throw
the burden of responsibility on me. Miss
Drew."
"Have I suggested going back to the
old relations? You will pardon ma If I
remind you of the fact that you came to
day on your own initiative and certainly
without my solicitation."
"Now. look here, Barbaraâ" he began,
dimly realizing, that it was going to be
hard, very hard, to bring Her to reason.
"I am- very sorry, Mr. Brewster, but
you will have to excuse me. I am going
out."
"I regret exceedingly that I should have
disturbed you to-day. Miss Drew," he
said, swallowing his pride. "Perhaps I
may have the pleasure of seeing you
again."
As he was leaving the house, deep an
ger in his soul, he encountered the colo
nel. There was something about Monty's
greeting, cordial as It was, that gave the
older man a hint as to the situation.
"Won't you stop for dinner, Monty?" he
asked In the hope that his suspicion was
groundless.
"Thank you. colonel, not to-night" and
he was off before the colonel could hold
him.
Barbara was tearfully angry when her
father came Into the room, but as he be
gan to remonstrate with her the tears
disappeared and left her at white heat
"Frankly, father, you don't understand
matters," she said with slow emphasis;
"I wish you to know now that if Mont
gomery Brewster calls again I shall not
sea him."
"If that is your point of view, Barbara,
I wish you to know mine." The colonel
rose and stood over her, everything for
gotten but the rage tnat went so deep
that It left the surface calm. Throwing
aelde his promise to Brewster, he told
Barbara with dramatic simplicity the
story of the rescue of the bank. "You
see," he added, "If it had not been for
that open-hearted boy wa would now be
ruined. Instead of giving cotillions you
might be giving music lessons. Montgom
ery Brewster will always be welcome in
this house and you will see that my
wishes are respected. Do you under
stand?"
"Perfectly." Barbara answered in a
still voice. "As your friend I shall try to
ba civil to him." ,
The colonel was not satisfied with so
cold-blooded an acquiescence, but he
wisely retired from the field. He left the
girl silent and crushed, but with a gleam
In her eyes that was not altogether to be
concealed. The story had touched her .
more deeply than she would willingly con.
fess. It was something to know that
Monty Brewster could do a thing like
that and would do It for her. The exult
ant smile which it brought to her lips
could only be made to disappear by re
minding herself sharply of his recent ar
rogance. Her anger, she found, was a
plant which needed careful cultivation.
It was in a somewhat chastened mood
that she started a few days later for a
dinner at the DeMIlles'. As she entered
In her sweeping golden gown the sight of
Monty Brewster at the* other end of the
room gave her a flutter at the heart But
It was an agitation that was very care
fully concealed. Brewster was certainly
unconscious of It To him the position
of guest was Uke a disguise and he
Â¦was pleased at the prospect of letting
himself go under the mask without re
sponsibility. But It took on a different
color when the butler handed him a card
which signified that he was to take Miss
Drew In to dinner. Hastily seeking out
the hostess he endeavored to convey to
her the Impossibility of the situation.
"I hope you won't misunderstand nu,"
he eald. "But Is it too late to change my
place at the table?"
"It iÂ«n't conventional, I know, Monty.
Society's chief aim Is to separate engaged
couples at dinner," said Mrs. Dan with
a laugh. "It would be positively com
promising if a man and' his wife sat to
rether."
Dlnner was announced before Monty
could utter another word, and as she led
him over to Barbara she said,. "Behold a
generous hostess who gives up the best
man in the crowd so that he and some
one else may have a happy time, I leave
it to you, Barbara, if that isn't tha teit
of friendship."
â¢ For a moment the two riveted their,
eyes on the floor. Then the humor of tha
situation came to Monty.
"I did not know that we were sup
posed to do Gibson tableaux to-night,"
he said dryly as he proffered his arm.
"I ' don't Â¦ understand," .and Barbara's
curiosity overcame her determination not
to speak. *
"Don't you remember the picture of the
man who was 'called upon to take his lata
fiancee out to dinner?". Â¦
Tha awful silence with which this re
mark was received put an end to further
efforts at humor.
- The- dinner was probably the most pain
ful experience In their lives. Barbara
had come to it softened and ready to
meet him half way. Tha right kind of
humility in Monty would have found her
plastic. But she had -very definite and
rigid Ideas of his duty In the premises.
And Monty was j too simple minded to
seem to suffer and much too flippant to
understand. It was plain- to each that
the other did not expect to talk, but they
both realized .that they owed a duty to
appearances and to their , hostess.
Through two courses, at least, there was
dead. silence between them. It seemed as
though 1 every eye in the room ..were ; on
them and every mind were speculating.
At last in sheer desperation, Barbara
turned to him with the first smile ha had
seen on her face In days. There was no
smile in her eyes, Â¦ however, and Monty
understood.
"We might at least give out. tha im
pression that we ara friends," ehe said
quietly.
"More easily said than done," he re
sponded gloomily.
"They are all looking at us and won
dering."
"I don't blame them."
"We owa something to Mrs. Dan, X
think."
"I know." â¢ Q !
Barbara uttered some Inanity whenever
she caught any one looking in their direc
tion, but Brewster seemed not to hear.
At length: he cut short some remark of
hers about the weather.'
"What nonsense Jhis is, Barbara," he
said. "With any one else I would chuck
the whole game, but with you It is dif
ferent I don't know what I have done,
but I am sorry. I hope you'll for
give me."
"Your assurance is amusing, to say the
least"
"But I am sura. I know this quarrel is
something we'll laugh over. You keep
forgetting that we are going to ba mar
ried some day." '- ,
A new light came Into Barbara's eyes.
"You forget that my consent may be
necessary." she said.
"You will ba perfectly willing when the
time comes. I am still in tha fight and
eventually y6o will come to my way of
thinking.".
"Oh! I see It. now." said i Barbara, and
her blood 'was up.- "You mean to force
me to It What you did for father "'
Brewster glowered at her, thinking that
he had misunderstood. "What do you
mean?" he said.
"He has told me all about that wrtched
bank business.- But poor father thought
you quite, disinterested. He did not see
the little game behind-- your melodrama-
He would have torn up your check on
the Instant If he had suspected. you were
trying to buy his daughter." .... .. . ,
"Does your father believe that?" asked
Brewster. Â¦ â* -~'* Â¦&.'"' " ~^5
"No, but I see It all now. His per
sistence and yours-^you were not slow"
to grasp the opportunity offered."
"Stop, Miss Drew," Mont commanded.
His voice had. changed anoV she' had never ..
before seen that look In his eyes. "You
need haVe no fear that I will trouble you
again."
XV. /
THE CUT DIRECT.
A typographical error In one of the
papers caused no end or amusement to
every one except Monty and Miss Drew.
The headlines had announced: "Magnifi
cent ball to be given Miss Drew by her
finance," and the Sons of the
Rich" wondered why . Monty did not see
the humor of It
"He has too bad an attack to see any
thing but the lady.", said Harrison one
evening when the "Sons" were gathered
for an old-time supper party.
"It's always the way," commented the
philosophical Bragdon. "When you lose
your heart your sense of humor goes
too. Engaged couples couldn't do such
ridiculous stunts if they had the least
particle of it left."
"Well, If Monty Brewster is still (n
love with Miss Drew he takes a mighty
poor way of showing it" "Subway"
Smith's remark fell like a bombshell.
The thought had come to every one, but
no one had been given 'the courage to
utter it. For them Brewster's silence on
the subject since the D 8 Mllle dinner
seemed to have something ominous be
hind it. %
"It's probably only a lovers* quarrel,"
said Bragdon. But further comment was
cut short by the entrance of Monty him
self, and they took their places at table.
Before the evening came to an end
they were In possession of rarfhy aston
ishing details In connection with the com
ing ball. Monty did not say that.it was
to be given for Miss Drew and her name
was conspicuously absent from his de
scriptions. As he unfolded his plans even
the "Little Sons," who were Imaginative
by Instinct and reckless on principle; could
not be quite acquiescent.
"Nopper" Harrison solemnly expressed
the opinion that the ball would cost
Brewster, at least $125,000. The *;Little /
Sons" looked at one another in conster
nation, while Brewster's Indifference ex
pressed .Itself In an unflattering comment
upon his friend's vulgarity. "Good Lord.
Nopper," he added, "you would speculate
about the price of gloves for your wed
ding." ? X
Harrison resented the taunt "It would
be much less vulgar to do that, Monty,
saving your presence, than to force your
millions down every one's throat."
"Well, they swallow them. I've noticed,"
retorted Brewster, "as though they were
chocolates."
Pettingill Interrupted grandiloquently.
"My friends and gentlemen!"
"Which Is rrhlch?" asked Van Winkle,
casually.
But the artist was In the saddle. "Per
mit me to present you to the boy Croesus
âthe only one extant. His marbles are
plunks and his kites ' are made of flfty
dollar notes. He feeds upon coupons a
la Newburgh. and his champagne is -liq
uid" golden eagles. Look at him, gentle
men, while you can, and watch him while
he spends thirteen thousand dollars for
flowers!" â¢ . .
"With a Viennese orchestra for twenty
nine thousand!" added Bragdon. "And
yet they maintain that silence is golden."
"And three singers to divide twelve
thousand among themselves! That's ab-
eolutely criminal," cried Van Winkla.
"Over In Germany they'd sing a month
for half that amount"
"Six hundred guests to feedâ total cost
of not less than forty thousand dollars,"
groaned "Nopper," dolefully. 5
"And there aren't six hundred In town,"
lamented "Subway" Smith. ' "All that
glory wasted on two hundred rank'out
elders."
"You men are borrowing- a. lot of trou
ble," yawned Brewster with a gallant ef
fort to seem bored. "All I ask of you
Is to come to the party and put up a
good imitation of having the time of your
life. Between you and me, I'd rather ba
caught at Huyler's drinking icecream soda
than giving this thing.,- But "
"That's what we .want :to know, but
what?" and "Subway" leaned forward
eagerly. â¢ ,^ Â¦Â« ' -
"But," continued Montr. "I am In for
it now, anu It la going to ba a ball that
is a ball." , â¢
Nevertheless the optimistlo Brewster
could not" find the courage to tell Peggy
of these picturesque extravagances. To
satisfy her curiosity he blandly Informed
her that he was Retting off much more
cheaply than he had expected. He laugh
ingly denounced as untrue the stories that
had come to her from outside sources.
And before his convincing assertions that
reports were ridiculously exaggerated tha
troubled expression in the girl's eyes dis
appeared. * ..
"I must seem a fool," groaned Monty,
as ha left the house after on* of
these explanatory trials, "but what
will 'she think of , me toward
tha end of the year when X am -really
In harness." Ha found It hard to con
trol the desire to be straight with Peggy
and. tell her the story of hit mad race
In pursuit of poverty. *
Preparations for tha ball went on stead
ily, and in a dull winter It had Its color
value fop. society. It was to be a Span
ish costume ball, and at many tea tables
the talk' of It was a godsend. Sarcastio
as it frequently was on the question of
Monty's extravagance, there was a splen
dor-about the Aladdln-Uke entertainment
which had a. . charm. Beneath the out
ward disapproval there was a secret' ad
miration of the superb nerve of the man/
And there was little reluctance to help
him In the wild â¢ career he had chosen.
It was so easy to go with j him to tha
edge of tha precipice and let him take
the plunge alone. Only the echo of the
criticism reached Brewster, for he had
silenced Harrison with work and Pettln
glll with opportunities. It troubled him
little, as ha was engaged In Jotting down
items that swelled the profit side of his
ledger account enormously. The ball was
bound to give him a good lead In the
race once more, despite the heavy handi
cap tha Stock Exchange had imposed.
The "Little Sons" took off their coats
and helped Pettingill In the work of prep
aration. He found them quite superflu
ous, for their ideas never % agreed and
each man had a way of preferring his
own suggestion. To Brewster's chagrin
they were united in the effort to curb
his extravagance.
"He'll be giving automobiles and ropes
of pearls for favors If we don't stop him,"
said "Subway" Smith, after Monty had
ordered a vintage champagne to be served
during the entire evening. "Give them
two glasses first. If you like, and then
they won't mind If they have cider j the
rest of the night."
"Monty Is plain dotty," chimed In Brag
don, "and the pace Is beginning to tell
on him."
As a matter of fact tha pace was be
ginning to tell on BrewÂ»ter. Work and
worry were plainly an effect on
his. health. His color was bad, his eyes
were losing their luster and there was
a llstlessness in .his actions that even
Â¦determined effort could not conceal from
'his friends. Little fits of fever annoyed
him occasionally and * he admitted that
he did not feel quite right
"Something Is wrong somewhere," he
said, ruefully, ."and my whole system
seems ready to stop work through sym-
had thought to come back to life. Tha
burden of .it all seemed heavy. Tho
trained nurses found that some more pow
erful stimulant than the medlcino was
needed to awaken his ambition, and they
discovered It at last 'In Peggy
"Child;", he said to her the first time
she was permitted to bm him, and his
eyes had lights In them; "do you know,
this Isn't such a bod old world after ull.
Sometimes as I've lali. her*. It has looked
twisted and queer. But there are things
that straighten It out To-day I feel as
though 1 had a place in itâ as though I
could fight things and win out. What do
you think, Peggy? Do you suppose there
is something that I could do? You know
what I meanâ something that some one
else would not do a thousand times bet
ter."
But Peggy, to whom this chastenod
mood in Monty was infinitely pathetic,
would not let him talk. She soothed him
and cheered him and touched his hair
with her cool hands. And then she left
him to think and brood and dream. !
It was ' many days before his turbulent
mind drifted to the subject of money, but
suddenly he found himself hoping that
the surgeons would be generous wiui
their charges. He almost suffered a re
lapse when Lotless, visibly distressed,
informed him that the total amount
would reach $3000.
"And what Is tha additional eharge for
the operation?" asked Monty, unwilling
to accept such unwarranted favors.
"It's Included in the $3000," said Lotless.
"They knew you were my friend and It
was professional etiquette to help keep
down expenses." Â£i Â¦
Fox days Brewster remained at Mrs.
Gray's, happy in its reatfulness, serene
vnder the charm Of Peggy's j pres
ence, and satisfied to be hope
lessly behind in his dally expense account.
Tha interest shown'by the Inquiries at tha
house and the anxiety of his friends were
soothing to the profligate. It gave him
back a little of his lost self-respect The
doctors finally decided that he would best
recuperate in Florida, and advised a
month at least in. the warmth. Ha leased
at the proposition, but took the law Into
his own hands by ordering General Man
ager Harrison to rent a place, and insist
ing that he needed 'the companionship of
Peggy and Mrs. Gray.
"How soon can I get back to work, doc
tor?" demanded Monty, the day before
the special train was to carry him South.
He was beginning to see the dark side of
this enforced idleness. His blood again
was tingling with the desire to be back in
the harness of a spendthrift.
"To work?" laughed the physician.
"And what is your occupation, pray?"
"Making other people rich," responded
Brewster, soberly. Â»
"Well, aren't you satisfied with what
you have dona for me? If you are as
charitable as that you must be still pretty
sick. But be careful, and you may be on
your feet again in five or six weeks."
Harrison came in as Lotless left Peggy
smiled at him from the window. She ha*
been reading aloud from a novel so gar
rulous that it fairly cried aloud for inter
ruptions.
"Now, Nopper, what became of the
ball I was going to giver* demanded
Monty, a troubled look in his eyes.
"Why, we called it off," said "Nopptr,"
In surprise.
"Don't you remember, Monty?" asked
Peggy, looking up quickly, and wondering
if his mind had gone trailing off.
I know we didn't give it. of course;
but what date did you hit upon?"
"We didn't postpone it at all," . said
"Nopper." "How could we? We didn't
know whetherâ I mean, It wouldn't have
been quite right to>do that sort of thing."
"I understand. Well, what has become
of tha orchestra, and the flowers, and all
that7" \
"The orchestra Is gallivanting around
the country, quarreling with itself and
everybody else, and driving poor Gardner
to the Insane asylum. Tho flowers have
lost their bloom long ago."
"Well, we'll get together, Nopper, and
patny. . .
Suddenly there was a mighty check to
the preparations. Two days before the
date set for the ball everything came to
a standstill and the managers sank back
In perplexity and consternation. Monty
Brewster was critically ill.
Appendicitis, the doctors called it, and
an operation was -imperative.
"Thank heaven, it's fashionable,"
laughed Monty, who "showed no fear of
: the prospect. "How ridiculous If it had
been the mumps, or if the newspapers had
said, 'On account of the whooping cough,
Mr. Brewster did not attend his ball.' "
"You don't mean - to sayâ the ball Is
off, of course," and Harrison was really
alarmed.
"Not a bit of It, Nopper," said Monty.
"It's what I've been wanting all along.
You chars do the handshaking and I
stay at home."
There was iÂ».n Immediate council of war
when this ptece of news was announced,
and the "Little Sons" . were unanimous
In favor of recalling the invitations and
declaring the party off. At first Monty
was obdurate, but when some one sug
gested that he could give the ball later
on, after he was well, he relented. The
opportunity to double the cost by giving
two parties was not to be ignored.
"Call it off. then, but say that It is
only postponed."
A great rushing to and fro resulted in
the canceling of contracts, the recalling
of invitations, the settling of accounts,
with the most loval effort' to save as
much as possible from the wreckage.
Harrison and his associates, almost fran
.tlc with fear for Brewster's life, man*)
aged to perform wonders In the few
hours of grace. Gardner with rare fore
sight saw that the Viennese orchestra'
would prove a dead loss. He suggested
the possibility of a concert tour through
'the country, covering several weeks, and:
Monty, too Ul to care one way or the
other, authorized him to carry out the
plan If It neemed feasible.
To Monty, fearless and less disturbed
than any other member of his circle,
appendicitis seemed as Inevitable as vac
cination.
"The appendix Is becoming an impor
tant feature In the Book of Life," he once
told Pepgry Gray. :
He refused to go to a hospital, but pa
thetically begged to be taken to his old'
.rooms at Mrs. Gray's. . â¢>
With all the unhappy loneliness of ft
sick boy, he craved the care and : com
panionship of those who seemed a part
of his own. Dr. Lotless had them trans
form a smail bedchamber Into a
model operating room and Monty took
no small satisfaction In the thought that
if he was to be denied, the privilege of
spending money for several weeks, he
would at least make his Illness as ex
. pensive as possible. A consultation of
eminent surgeons was called, but true to
his colors, Brewster installed Dr. Lotless,
a "Little Son," as his house Burgeon.
Monty grimly bore the pain and . suffer
ing and submitted to the operation; which
alone' could save his life. Then came* the
struggle, then the promise of victory and
then the quiet days of convalescence. In
tha little room where he had dreamed
his boyish dreams and suffered, his boy
ish . sorrows, he struggled : against death
and gradually emerged from the mists of
lassitude. He , found It harder than he
try to have tha ball at mid-Lent. I think
I'll be well by that time."
Peggy looked appealingly at Harrison
for guidance, but to him silence seemed
the better part of valor, and ha went off
wondering if the illness bad completely
carried away Monty's reason, v -"--"Â¦
IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.
It was the cottage of a New York mil
lionaire which had fallen to Brewster.
The owner had, for the time, preferred
Italy to St. Augustine, and left his estate,
which was well located and lavishly
equipped, in the hands of his friends.
Brewster's lease covered three months, at
a fabulous rate per month. With Joe
Bragdon installed as manager in chief,
his establishment was transferred bodily
from New York and the rooms were soon
as comfortable as their grandeur would
permit. Brewster was not allowed to
take advantage of his horses and the new
automobile which preceded , him from
New York, but to his guests they offered
unlimited opportunities. "Nopper" Har
rison had remained in the north to re
new his arrangements for the now hated
ball and to look after the advance details
of the yacht cruise. Dr. Lotless
and his sister, with "Subway" Smith
and the Grays, made up Brewster's
party. Lotless- dampened Monty's
spirits by relentlessly putting him
on 4 rigid diet. with most dis
couraging restrictions upon his conduct.
The period of convalescence was to be an
exceedingly trying one for the invalid.
At first he was kept indoors, 1 and the
hours " were whlled away by playing cards.
BuOMonty considered "bridge" the "pons
aslnorum," and preferred to play piquet
with Peggy. It was one of these games
that the girl interrupted with the ques
tion that had troubled her for many days.
"Monty," she said, and she found it much
more difficult then when she had rehears
ed the scene in the silence of her walks;
"I've heard a rumor that Miss Drew and
her mother have taken rooms at the ho
tel. Wouldn't It be pleasanter to have
them here?" .
A heavy gloom settled upon Brewster's
face, and the girl's heart dropped like
lead. She had puzzled over the estrange
ment, and wondered If by any effort of
her own things could be set right. At
times she had had flashing hopes that it
did not mean as much to Monty as she
had thought. But down underneath, the
fear that he was unhappy seemed .the
only certain thing in life. She felt that
she musymake sure. And together with
the verywiuman desire to know the worst,
was the puritanical impulse to bring it
about. .
"You forget that this Is the last place
they would care to Invade." And In
Brewster's face Peggy seemed to read
that for her martyrdom was the only
wear. Bravely she put it on.
Â» "Monty, I forget nothing that I really
know. But this Is a case In which you
are quite wrong. Where Is your sporting
blood? You -have never f ought a losing
fight before, and you can't do it now. You
have lost you nerve, Monty. Don't you

But Monty did mind enormously. He
had no desire to talk about tha thing; any

off seemed a bit unnecessary. Manifestly
her own interest In him was of tha cold*
est. From out of the gloom he looked at
her somewhat sullenly. For the moment
she was thinking only of his pain, and
her faca said nothing.
"Peggy," ha exclaimed, finally, re

her, ' "you don't In the least know
what you are talking about. It

"A conviction which can be changed,"
the girl broke in.

And Peggy, fiery and determined and
defiantly unhappy, threw down her cards
and escaped so that she might not prove
herself tearfully feminine. She left

began to wonder if Barbara Drew did

Then he found his thoughts wandering
off toward Peggy ,and her defiance. He
had only twice before seen her in that
mood, and he liked It He remembered
how Bha had lost her temper ones whoa

Suddenly he laughed aloud at the

tame. She had known, of course, that

in a proposal, but she didn't think It
would come eo prematurely.*- i
It was so like Dick to call at such an
absurdly early hour and blurt it right
ouj without any preface, and then to
leave immediately without replying to her
kind, little offer of friendship. Dick had
no finesse. Still, she wasn't sure that she
liked a man with too muchâ like her Un
cle Henry, for Instance.
As if in obedience to her thoughts there
entered the room at this moment her un
cle; Henry Ormsby. a bachelor clubman of
some thirty and odd years.
"What, Cynthia! And no Dick?"
."Dick has come and gone."
"Dick usually comes and stays."
"I know it," she sighed, "but, you see
he came once too often."
1 "And that is why he did not stay?"
"Yes, and It's Just as well. Dicks are
sometimes tiresome."
"Not this Dick. . He's quite a favorite
with your Bex."
"Dick Is?" she asked with elevated
brows. "Oh, the girls like him because
he is agreeable, but none of them are
very enthusiastic over him."
"That,". replied her uncle, "Is because
they are used to him and have grown up

ing the little leap of relief In Cynthia's
countenance he offset It by the remark
that there would be "heaps of doings"
and Dick would be strictly In it.
"Yes. we will all miss him at the club."
"I suppose he will not be away long.
I think ho mentioned the date of his re

"By the way," she finally said, "I had
a note from Dick. He was Just off for
Denver."
He complied with her request as to the
call, but seemed In an uncommunicative
mood.
Again were Cynthia's feelings mingled
and conflicting. He had followed her
wishes and become her friend, but the
note was most unsatisfactory. He had
given her no Denver address nor any
idea of the length of his absence. How
ever, possibly she might be able to draw
that information from her uncle without
his suspecting.

Thereupon Uncle Henry took his de
parture, leaving his young niece to her
meditations. Â»
The next morning her heart fluttered
for the first time at the sight of a note
in. Dick's chlrography. She read:
"Dear Cynthia: I find I have to leave
very unexpectedly for Denver on a busi

for my hasty speech and departure last

Two days later Dick was shown Into
the library where Cynthia was sitting
before the fire as he had seen her last.

"No!" he replied. "They telegraphed

In a day or two her uncle dropped in.
"I had a letter from Dick to-day." he
announced. "He was very modest and
only said how kind my friends were In
introducing and entertaining him- But I
received a letter from Ellen Darnley laud
ing him to the skies and saying thai had
she been heart whole and fancy free she
didn't know what might have happened."
He left Cynthia a prey to Jealousy, re
morse and regret. She wrote Dick that
night, telling him how glad she was to
hear he was having so gay a time and
how he must dread the thought of a re
turn home.
His reply was friendly, and gave de
tails of the good times he was having.
"To-morrow night," he concluded, "1Â»

ciate as one of the ushers. The brides

the ceremony has eyes like that picture

Cynthia threw the letter in the fire.
The next time Henry Ormsby called he
brought a paper from his pocket.
"I want to read to you about Ellen's
wedding," he said. "Dick is given spe

"I am sick of the sound of Ellen Darn

followed the embezzler's trail, like a

he was a doctor, though not seeking to

Just how his title came to be known. His
next neighbor was a mile away, and
travelers who Hopped at his house for
a drink of water or to Inquire the way
were treated with scant courtesy. There
was considerable gossip about the
stranger, and many people shook their
heads and whispered that the officers of
the law would turn up in search of him
some fine day, but after awhile, as noth
ing was heard against him, he was putt
down as a recluse and left undisturbed. 1
It was a year or more after Dr. Davy's
appearance that he came to town one
evening to meet a young woman who
stepped off the train from the East. The
family resemblance was so marked that
It was agreed by all that the newcomer
was his daughter. She was hurried away
as if the father feared to let the towns
people get sight of her, but It had needed
only a glance to show that ehe was good
looking and about 20 years of age. Her
coming revived the gossip, but as she was
not seen in town during the next three
months she was In time forgotten by all
with one exception. That exception was
young Joe Taylor, who had been made
Sheriff of the county a year before, and
who was being talked of as a candidate
for the Legislature. He had only to ac

was a general favorite with all. -He made
it his business while scouting the coun

cabin, and he was the first and about the
only one to see the daughter Mollle In her
own home, and to be hospitably received
by the father.
If he had any curiosity to gratify as
an officer of the law he was disappointed.
The Doctor was free to talk, but not
about himself nor his past. He was made
welcome by the daughter, but he could
not question her as a suspect.
' He called three or times "by acci
dent," but after that he was a weekly
visitor from choice and invitation. In
time he was quite ready to acknowledge
to himself that he was In love, and to
hope that his feelings were reciprocated.
He was feeding up' his courage to speak
liis mind when something happened to
make him turn pale and set his heart to
thumping. As Sheriff, he received an offi
cial document by mail one day in which
he was commanded to arrest one' Dr.
James Bird as an embezzler. It was Bird
instead of Davy In^the warrant, but the
personal description fitted the man who
was living out on the prairie with hrs
"It was. Joe." she replied. "But now"â
"But now it's betwixt you and me, and
as soon as I can shake myself together
I'll fix things so that you won't have to
do any more moving. Thanks, dear, that
you shot a little too high!"
"Andâ and did he have any legal paper
with him?" queried the father in a whis
per.
"If he had It has been burned. Tell me,
father, is he fatally wounded?"
"No; the bullet plowed along his scalp
and he will be all. right in a week. I will
load up the wagon and we must move, on
and find another asylum."
"But the manâ Mr. Taylorâ Joe?" she
asked.
"We shall take him with us. He will
need my skill and your nursing for some
days to come."
It was two weeks later when the Sheriff
opened his eyes and saw Mollle Davy
seated near his bedside. The old claim
had been left a hundred miles 'behind and
the abandoned cabin of a settler had been
taken possession of. Joe Taylor had been
nursed and tended through fever as the
wagon rolled along.
"Mollle. I take It that it was betwixt
dad and me?" he said as she saw that he
had come back to earth again.
"Heâ he started to the lake to find you
and a gun went off'" replied the girl, be
tween her sobs.
"How did It come about?" asked the
Doctor, wiio had hurried home at the re
port of the rifle and found his daughter
standing over a wounded and unconscioua
man.
"Then you will arrest him?"
He kissed her again and turned away
toward the lake, looking ai the paper In
his hand through tears In his eyes. He
had not taken a hundred steps, however,
before a rifle cracked and he pitched for
ward on the grass. Ills horse would have
dashed off at the sudden report, but It
was secured by the girl.

that name for the first time, "a girl

"Yea: she ought to. and you ought to

"I do, Joe; and I love you In return, and

ing up the path Mr. James Dent, better
known to the summer colony, from the'
most staid matron, to the smallest urchin,
as "Jimmy.". ,
He . came up to the veranda, stretched
himself comfortably ln a steamer chair
and mopped a perspiring brow.
"Sorter warm-like. Isn't It?" he said
cheerfully. â¢
Dorothy nodded. . ,
"What variety of vegetable are you

Dorothy made a feint at him with her

"There's a polo game at the 'club to

but despite the nonchalance of her words,
she colored slightly. "What have I been

"Um-m," Dent mused. "So I feared,"
he said laconically. "Doll, It's too bad.

Dorothy laid down her work rather

"Oh, dear, no," he said, "this expedl

"Oh. I'm not fighting his battle. He did

"I'm merely urging a little clemency on
the part of his captor. I'm really sorry

"The rest?" she inquired.
"Yes. The field, we might call It, I sup-.

"And married a Spanish girl," she sup
plemented. â¢
; "And Crayton," he went on, "what be
came of him T"-
Just then one of the college boys arose,
looked around and blew a kiss toward
Corlnne and Dorothy.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, "in
the presence of a lady who has Just de
clared that she never before tasted a
cocktail I blush to remark "
"Oh, oh! I'm going home this minute,"
said Dorothy, rising and looking about
her with misty eyes and cheeks burning
with mortification.
"Bring us four Martinis to start with,"
said Reggie Cutting to the waiter, who
wore a soiled collar and a cutaway.
Dorothy looked at Corlnne apprehensive
ly. >:
"Are Martinis cocktails?" -she asked
shyly, "because If theyâ are, I've never
tasted one."
The tweezy orchestra was playing the
latest air from a popular comic opera as
Dorothy Brockway, followed by Corlnne
and the two newspaper men, ln their
morning clothes, entered the third-rate
Bohemian cafe. The Hsrhts flashed on a
hundred women ingaudy gowns, wearing
every color and variety of hat. Jewels,
real and oaste, twinkled under the chan
deliers and the fumes from a hundred
cigarettes rose to heaven. Some college
boys were singing "Bola Bolal" totally
oblivious of time and tune, and were
pounding on the table with their forks
ln wild applause at their own Jokes.
"How do you like it?" asked Corlnne,
as they took their seats.*
"It's choky," - said Dorothy non-com
mft tally.
"What do you take?" asked one of the
men. looking at Dorothy.
"Why-whyâ oh, anything. I think I'd
like a chocolate frappe."
A loud laugh from the other three greet
ed this remark.
"Why, no," and Corlnne turned re
proachful eyes on Dorothy. "They are
newspaper men, you know, and can only
steal an hour or so from the office. Be
sides, that would be awful conventional.
No, not that low cut frock, goosie. Pick
out your plainest shirt waist If you're
going slumming with me."
Dorothy set her teeth firmly and smiled
away the little frown that had begun to
cloud her forehead. 'Â¦Â¦'Â«Â¦
Three-quarters of an hour later they
were wearily climbing the stairs to Cor
inne's studio. Up one long flight, up two,
up three! Dorothy sat down In a heap
on the dirty floor to rest.
"Connie, is your studio in heaven?"
"Yes, when I sell anything. Come
along, glrly, you'll get there. It merely
requires perseverance," and one more
flight brought the two to a battered door
in \ dirty hall, smelling of mold and
dampness. Corinne took out her latchkey
and unlocked the door.
"Oh, how glorious!" sighed Dorothy,
"to carry your* own latchkey!"
"Delightful!" and Corinne's voice was
a bit ironical.
Just three weeks later Dorothv rolled
over wearily in her automatic combina
tion bed and folding couch that did duty
by day as an "Oriental corner,' with a
lot of gaudy pillows piled upon it.
"Connie." she said tragically, "do you
know Just how much money I have be
tween me and the cold, cold world? Just
fifteen dollars! And I haven't sold a sin
gle thing I've written, andâ Connie, is
there anything else in Bohemia besides
work and disappointment and editors who
won't see you?"
"Yes." said Corlnne doubtfully, "I be
lieve there are the Hungarian restaurants.
You need cheering up, girly. We'll do a
Hungarian restaurant to-night I'll tel
ephone two of the boys from Park Row
to meet us somewhere and* we'll go to
Martinetti's."
"Meet us? Meet us? Can't they call
for us here?"
"Butâ butâ all these bags!" and Dor
othy looked helplessly at the pile of
leather satchels beside her.
â¢They aren't bohemlan, either," and
Corlnne relentlessly led the way to the
cm, tugging two satchels while Dorothy
followed helplessly with the rest.
"You dear little Idiot," Bald Corlnne as
she kissed her and led the way to the
ferry boat. "You absurd little greenie!
Why on earth did you leave my good
and glorious brother to come up to this
seething caldron? Why didn't you stay
at home and marry him and get sup
ported for the rest of your lifer'
"Connie!" eald Dorothy, severely, "yon
don't know what it is * %o be bossed and
bossed and bossed. I -want to be bohe
xnlan." \V. :-
There was a Queer 'little light In Cor
lnne's eyes as she answered: "AH right,
dear, we'll begin right away. Come, we'll
take a streetcar Instead of a cab. It
wouldn't be bobemlan -to take a cab, you
know. Bohemians are all poor. I'm a
Bohemian!"
As the train whizzed past the out
skirts of the city Dorothy Brockway
stretched out her arms and drew a deep
elgh of relief.
-Free! free! free!" she breathed in a
passionate whisper and leaned back ln
the eeat with a wonderful smile in her
eyes and deep, Joyous satisfaction per
meating her whole being. "No more
mammas! No more Teddy! No more
chaperons! No more tea parties." she
went on, "Just fun and work and do as
I please and be bobemlan. Oh, how I
hate It all! Mamma's conventionalities;
Teddy's bossingâ dear old Ted! How
broken up he lookedâ" and some of the
merriment faded from her eyes.
>It was dusk as her train steamed Into
Jersey City and the tall sky-scrapers on
.Park Row were sending forth a million
'twinkling lights that streamed over the
water. Dorothy looked about her a little
bewildered but made her way hurriedly
to the gates, followed by a fat porter
who carried her grips. Through the bars
she spied a smiling pair of eyes, and Cor
rinne Morrison came to meet her with an
amused look on her face.
The man lifted his hat solemnly. Then
he strode'QrWay with a quiet, hurt look in
his eyes, not even waiting to see the
merry face that peered out of the win
dow 6-s the train panted and puffed out
of the station^
"Oh, brace up, Morrison. This won't do.
There's no use making a mute of your
self for any fool girl who doesn't half ap
preciate you."
"You don't know anything about it!"
And Teddy Morrison walked off, leaving
the man who had been trying to cheer
him tip standing where he was, a little
chagrined and a bit sorry for the big
fellow.

The other letter was quite different ln
purport. It ran thus:
"Dear Ted:
"You're a cold, hard hearted, coarse
peraon," she Bald with blazing eyes, "and
I'm going back home to-morrow."
Two days later Mr. Ted Morrison sat
in his office ln the afternoon sunshine
looking over the mail which had Just
come ln. His hat was pushed back from
his forehead, showing a fine bead of cur
ly brown hair. He was laughing softly
and reading over for the third time two
letters he had Just received:
The first ran in this vein: -
"Dearest Teddy: . . â¢",
"Dorothy Brockway, if you must that
pillow up I'll make you pay for 1L It's
my best, so you Just stop your crying on

Dorothy arose with a sudden gulp and
glared at. her companion. .
"Oh. my head!" said Dorothy, sinking
down on the hard pillows of the "fake"
couch. "Oh, my head! How could you
make me drink that cocktailâ and the ta
ble and everything went around andâ oh,
Connie, I'm sick yet I'll never touch

"Oh, he'd Just be bossy and particular
about it. You'll get used to Bohemia aft

And Corinne glanced oddly at Dorothy.
. "I'm tired of something. My last story

and Dorothy was sobbing violently in half
a minute.
"Sit down, Dolly," whispered Corlnne,
"he doesn't mean anything. Sit down and
don't notice him. Here's your cocktail."
That is all that Dorothy ever remem
bered of that horrible evening. The next
morning she stood before the washstand,
miserably, towel in hand.
"Connie, Connie, this water's so cold
and I can't find any soap, and haven't you
got anything but a tin basin to wash in?"
"Other's broken," came cheerfully from
the inner recesses of a closet. . "

â¢.'shrill note on his whistle and continued
on his Impersonal errand down the block.
Barbara heard the whistle and wondered
with xnlld Interest whether there was any
nun for her. Being a matter-of-fact
yonng person, ehe went calmly on about
her aSairs, having learned from experi
ence thai her tiny share of the United
Buaee xnall was not usually of a char

a narrow slot in ths mall box and took
Â»zt th* letter.
Svca then, with the momentous fiocu

Trttt^mr would have done, that something
tmwwti was about to happen. A gleam

CAlntily, passed out into the street, read

When sho bad finished she stopped Quite
â¢till and looked about her ln a dazed way.
Â£hs 2 tit that It was the sort of a letter
that could only arrive by a page on a
cUtct tray, heralded by a fanfare of
li limpets, .
6U11. she eeemed to be awake. All the
Â»Â«mwÂ»T landmarks were thereâ the
church across the way, the house opposite
where the ivy was Just tinging the walls
Â¦with a faint green, and the Inevitable
group of children of assorted ages and
nationalities, scurrying hither and thither
with m' 11 regard for the usurping pedes
trian. It looked precisely like West
street. Town.
Ehe began to read the note a second
ttaJe, moving automatically down the
street. The blood rose ln her cheeks and
.her eyes eparkled with excitement. An
elevated train thundered by Just ahead of
her, with as much fuss as If It were the
Cyclone Limited scheduled to make Chi
cago ln twenty-four hours. It disap
peared and the commotion of Its passing
died on the air. But it had served Its
purpose and established the reality of
things.
In the next block she ran Into a portly
colored woman with a large bundle.
"Twenty million," she began ln exten
uation of her awkwardness. Then, as the
woman 6tared at her in astonishment, "I
Â¦mean I beg your pardon!" and she contln
'. ued on her way toward Fifth avenue with
a somewhat flustered countenance. Once
there, the swung along as if she were

love you at least $20,000,000 worth!"
And then she told him how she thought
of him. and the glimpse of the Jabber
wock had kept her from accepting â¢ old
Peter Mllward and hU fortune.
A month later, when Jack Carruthers.
whose salary had been raised to $1800 a
year, asked her to share it with him, she
accepted without taking any time for
consideration.
"How much do you really love me,
dear?" he asked fervently for the twen
tieth time, after the manner of lovers who
like to hear the same assurances over
and over again. And at last, in despera
tion, she replied:
"Well, if you want to know how much

grily.
"It's perfect nonsense!" she told herself
vehemently. "He is a very nice old man
and in time you'll get used to him. All

now, when it is laid at your feet, you
must auibblf>! Wait until the next in
terest payment is due on the mortgage at
home. You'll wish -.then that you had
forgotten sentiment."
Thus she went on goading herself, but
to no purpose. There was not another
person in the room, and she hid her face
in her hands and murmured in despera
tion Â»"Oh, Jackâ Jack!"
Restlessly she. rose and emerced "Â¦ into
the street again. The clouds hung low
and there was a slight fog. The gray of
the stone walks, the pavements and the
sky all seemed to melt together into one
sad-toned picture. Vehicles of all descrip
tions, from the butcher's wagon up, filled
the street, keeping so close together that
even the most daring person did riot ven
ture, to cross, and Barbara stood at the'
edge of the walk, waiting for a break in
the line to occur.
She never' knew how long she stood
thereâ long enough to listen to pome new
whisperings of His Satanic Maiesty tell
ing her how much good she could do with
all that money for the people she loved
and the sufferers of the earth. Ehe was
beginning to believe that it^was her duty
to sacrifice her feelings whether she
wished to or not. She might throw away
fortune for herself, but she had no right
to deny it to the others who would ben
efit through her.
Her eyes, which 'had been staring fixed
ly at the procession of carriages without
seeing them, were suddenly attracted by
an approaching coupe. The blood tingled
in her veins, for she recognized the Mil
ward liverv. y .
It was a handsome carriage with the
curved glass front which enables the oc
cupant to get a more extended view than
can be had in the other kind, and the
men on the box 6at very straight and
stiff. But it was none of these things
that held Barbara's glance fascinated.
It was a pair of glittering, fiendish eyes
that leered at her from the dark interior
as the carriage drew near, a pair of eyes
so horrid In their glare that her blood
ran cold, and she stared inÂ» stupefaction,
thinking she saw the outlines of a
grotesque, Bhadowy face around them.
Not until the coupe was opposite her
did the illusion fade and explain itself.
Then she drew a breath of relief, for what
she saw then was only the reflection of
the two large silver buttons on the back
of the coachman's coat, and Peter Mil
ward bowing to her in his most gallant
manner.
"I never expect to see anything so much
like the Jabberwock again," she laughed
to herself, and then she grew suddenly
grave.
Perhaps if she accepted Peter Milward
that skeleton in the coupe would be quite
real after all!
Having: reached this worldly conclusion,
ehe leaned back in a more comfortable
position and gazed at a dreamy Claude
Monet on the opposite walL Then her
self-communion began again:
"But there's Mr. Mllward. I shall not
be able- to forget him! I wish he were not
Quite so Decembery. If only he seemed a
little more alive!"
With a quickened breath she fancied
herself alone with him in a beautiful
home. Servants move noisily about, but
he was always cold and prim and still.
Sho felt stifled. She felt like a prisoner.
She belonged to him, for he had bought
her with his twenty millions. Oh, the
horrorâ the degradation. of it!
She shook herself Impatiently, and from
the expression of her face it was evident
that she willed Satan, not to get behind
her, but to come out into the open with
all his most alluring temptations. .
"I've been poor so long," she was think
ing. "Of course, it won't beâ won't be â "
she caught her breath and then forced
herself to think the unthinkable â "it won't
be like marrying Jack. But I should have
everything In the world besides him. No
life is all beer and skittles, and, after all.
If I had never met him I should have lived
and been happy without him. I shall
make believe that I never did."
It meant being the wife of a man older
than her own father would have been had
he lived, and, one for whom in her most
enthusiastic moments' she had never more
than an Indifferent toleration. Still, with
the glamour of his great fortune about

upon taking his place at her side.
But what were those things? Mere bag

an art gallery at the corner of Thirty

meant to sit and think it out, there was
a little frown upon her forehead.
For the third time within the hour she
read over the note. Now that the first
dizziness of the magnificence offered her

APHORISMS FROM
THE SILVER POPPY
ONE of the most remarkable literary creations in years are the
"Pastels in Pork" written by George Horace Lorimer, under the
title of "Letters Prom a Self- Made Merchant to His Son,'* which,
as the name would indicate, are broadly American, . shrewd, clever,
witty and filled with a practical philosophy and business acumen that
are real, vital and democratic The book has been a tremendous sensa
tion, so much so that its pithiest sayings are quoted herewith : by ar
rangement with Small, Maynard & Co., the . publishers,' Bos
ton, Mass. One of â¢ the most striking novelties is "Old John Gorgon
Graham's Alphabet," reproduced as a border all around this page.
There is truth as well as humor in every line of that alphabet. Next
Sunday The Call readers will be treated to another novelty from the
same book. ..-. . :

tJBsSSHBBnEssSi] Judge Miller and me had quite a long talk about it
one day last week and I've come to the conclusion that something's got to
be done. I didn't much believe in disturbin' things at first, bein' one of the
original stand-patters, but the iudee told me Uncle Mark was for new finan
cial legislation, so we ought to have it.
"How is it." I says to the judge, before I'd got a good clear under
standin' of the question, "that there's so much talk about currency legisla
tion now? It seems to me, if I don't disremember, that these same people
that are yellin' for new laws on the money question now were tellin' us a few,
years ago that it would be a crime to change, our- money system. They said
the gold standard fixed everything in that line forever and the money ques
tion was a dead issue. What's the matter? Ain't the gold standard keepin'
things goin 1 just right after all?"

it's got so that sometimes Wall street can have a flurry and get all run down
and the outside people keep right on doin' bizness, hardly noticin' that any
thing's wrong. That shows there ought to be a change. Things 'can't be
right when the grocery keepers at Sheboygan,_ Wis., and farmers in Ohio
can keep right on without noticin 1 any difference when- Wall street's all tore
up and the millionaires down there are so short of cash that some of them
even have to git along with their last year's steam yots. When things come
to that kind of a pass it's time to' put our pride away, and come right out
brave and reckanize the fact that ther's something the matter with our finan

"How are we goin' to fix it. Judge?" I asked him.
"What we need," says he. "is an elastic currency."
I've heard a good deal lately about an elastic currency, but before talk
in' with the judge about it I'd never seemed to understand iust what it
meant. I hated to let him find out about my ignorancy, but as the poet

So I come right out and asked him what an elastic currency was. He looked
kind of surprised that an enlightened man like me could ask such a fool
question, but he couldn't 4 helo seein' that I was honest about it. anyway.
"Well," he says, "I'll tell you. An elastic currency is something like one
of these toy balloons. You know how them things shrink up when you let
the air out of them. They don't seem v to amount to much for looks or
anything else when they're empty, but the more you blow in and stretch
them the better they look. ' What we need is a currency that'll stretch good
when things are filled up with water. If it was'nt that the experts down in

and a lower tariff wouldn't helo anybody but the people that have to buy
things, anyway, so what's the use talkin' foolish? Let's stand pat."

THE ORACLE OF
MULBERRY CENTER
By S. E. Kiser.
Baker's Dozenâ In England there was so heavy a fine for short-weight
in bakery goods that the shopkeepers began to throw in an extra biscuit or
cake with every dozen sold to make up for any chance deficiency, which
explains why we call thirteen "a baker's dozen." ' â¢
Fashions in Footwearâ Pictures of the court of Charles VIII of France
show many a fop whose satin shoes are gathered in full pleats across his
toes, giving his foot the shape of a duck's. :This was a tribute to the
King's "royal superfluity of toes," his Majesty being blessed with twelve.
Enter Trousersâ -It was one of his successors, Louis XII, who banished
the old knee-breeches and introduced the present atrocities to conceal his
own exceeding deficiency as to calf. â¢ \.:'-\ â¢
Nippon â The Japanese flag recalls the celestial folk-lore history of Tui
Sen, Governor of one of the Chinese provinces about 300 B. C, who might
ily offended the Emperor and fled across the seas with his little band of
faithful retainers in search of a new home and country. Each morning Tui
Sen's first supplication was. "The gods give the sun to shine on us this
day!" The prayer was answered all the^days of the' voyage, in recognition
of which grace the adventurers emblazoned the sun in their flag. and named
their land Nippon, or the Sunshine Land. The less romantic historian says
that Nippon means "the origin of the sun" and signifies Japan's extreme
easterly position.
The Wedding Flower â The orange flower derives its claim to preced
ence among wedding flowers from over two thousand years ago,-, when the
Greek girls adorned themselves on their bridal day with the sweetest
flower displaying the color of Hymenâ saffron. ..
"It was said, upon a time, \
I 4frould have 'Reason' for my Rhyme;
From that hour urito this season
I've had neither Rhyme nor Reason 1"
HERE was once a Bookworm who derived considerable
pgfc^PBW amusement from tracing the origin of some of the fads
B I l^oMC^ G I anc * prases that daily greet us. It is really interesting to
B?l^ notc kÂ° w many originated in some incident far back in the
BN^ ccntur ' es - A * ew Â°f l^ e jottings in the notebook of this

li^isJSI^ll Hand-shakingâ The habit of hand-shaking was, in its
| {^^ Bgv | origin, simply a denial of murderous intent. When our
pusillanimous forefathers had advanced within stabbing distance of each
other they raised their hands above their heads to prove themselves wea
ponless. From which custom developed the grasp of friendshipâ and of
hypocrisy.
The modern mode of shaking hands at the level of one's eyes is in imi
tation of an English lady of rank, who, while mounting the stairs with her
long court train over her arm, met an acquaintance and shook hands in this
awkward position to avoid dropping those yards of satin and silk.
Sandwichesâ Our sandwich is another memento : of English fadism.
Lord Sandwich was one day so engrossed in high-stake baccarat that he
would not leave the game though lunch time had come and gone, and even
when the waiter brought him some slices of cold beef and bread, clapped
three of them together and hurried them down the red lane. The whole
club promptly developed appetites like my Lord's, and the world has fol
lowed suit. â Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ,
Blindersâ It \yas another English nobleman with racing propensities
and a wall-eyed prize-winner who introduced blinders. He adorned them
with his monogram, the fashionable world went and did likewise, and to
day every American dray-horse feels the consequences.
Ecru Lace â One of the Countesses of Flanders was responsible for ecru
lace. The story runs that the impetuous lady swore not to change her
linen, no. nor the ball dress she then wore, tilPa" certain siege on one of
her husband's castles should be raised. The siege lasted a year and the Coun
tess kept her vow. There was nothing for the poor court-dames to do but
follow the Countess, so "ecru" became the color of fashion.
Rhyme or Reason â We who so commonly use the phrase, "Without
rhyme or reason," seldom remember it was connected with so select a trio
as Queen Elizabeth, Spencer and the Lord Chamberlain.' The poet, .after
reading his "Faerie Queene" to .Elizabeth, to whom it was dedicated, hand
ed the manuscript to the Lord Chamberlain, as was customary,- and-await
ed his bounty. "How much shall 'I- give him?" asked Ihe keeper of the
royal exchequer. "Give him in. reason," replied her . ;~ Majesty. ' But evi
dently the Chamberlain held the poet in mean, esteem, igt; no. largess was
given him nor was the verse returned.. At last these couplets appeared at
court and, as we like to believe,. opened the Chamberlain's hand:

'f^^^^^l'HERE must needs be a great host of the vacationless. The
, army of them is much larger than commonly supposed.
Â¦â¢^VjHiyPv When we say "everybody is out of town" we don't mean
exactly what we say. There is never an hour in the sum-
S^uBa^D mcr w^ cn as manv Â°f the inhabitants of a Riven commu
| *y yiffivp n ' tv are out Â°f town as remain at home. In the first place
, J^aMJMfern there is the bisr contingent of laborers by ( the day. most
of whom cannot afford to take a vacation because even a
short absence means a lessened income. Then there are those detained by
the care of infants, invalids, the infirm and the aged. It is hard, for instance,
for the average mother of young children to get a vacation. Moreover, the
work done day after day by certain persons. is so related to a network of
activities that if they lay down their special tasks the machinery of the .en
tire concern halts or goes slowly. It is sometimes easier for the office boy
,to get a holiday than for the head of the business,
', It takes considerable grace, I confess, .to 'see the summer slipping away
without bringing you any let-up. Out-going trains and steamers are packed
with people loaded down with golf sticks, tcrlnis rackets and hammocks.
You read of the merrymakings at.the different resorts. Your friend comes
back ruddy and vigorous after his month or fortnight in camp. And still
you plod away arid the green fields and dancing brooks and restful moun
tains seem very far off. You call it hard luck and wonder if your turn will
ever come.
But is it such, terrible hard luck after all? Think of the time spent in
hunting up places and in studying timetables, of the disappointments that
often befall the pleasure seeker, of the possible hard beds and the fly-infested
tables and the mosquito-frequented piazzas and the long waits at
the railway junctions and the noisy children in the next room and your own
cramped quarters. When you are at home you may not live sumptuously,
but at least you know what you are to encounter when you return at night
and you have learned jk> adjust yourself to it. And even when vacation
conditions are satisfactory, oh, how quickly the days speed by, and before
you know it the long-anticipated season is over. Then you are on a level
again with the man who has stayed at home all the time.
But, to speak in a little more serious vein â is any man entirely vacation
less? I was talking the other day with the executive head of ah important
establishment, who not only frankly admitted that he never took a vacation,
but absolutely gloried in the fact. "I found," said he, "that I had to work
extra hard before going and extra hard after coming back, and so I con
cluded the easier thing would be to stay at my post right along. ,But I have
my Sundays, and they make fifty-two days in a year, which is quite a vaca
tion in itself, and I have my nights, and there are 365 of them in a year, and
so I manage to get along nicely."
Pretty good philosophy that for the members of "The-Can't- Get- A way-
Club!" We must not forget that the Creator has made careful provision
for the needs of even the hardest worked man. Of course, if he misuses
these God-given opportunities of relaxation, if he works steadily seven days
in the week, or if he-employs the Sabbath hours in such a way that they de
plete his physical and nervous energy, if he carouses night after night, he
is burning the candle at both ends and the outcome will be speedy collapse.
But if he gets in his eight hours' sleep at night and rests and worships on
Sunday he can go a long while without the conventional vacation.
Much depends on the way the vacationless man uses the margins of his
time. They tell us that one can master many books eventually if he will
only improve the odd moments. One may get through Motley's "Dutch
Republic," for example, while waiting for the meals to be put on the table.
Itisnot otherwise with this matter of recreation. Learn to utilize the chinks
of time, to slip away for half a day. Cherish, too, the inward mood* that
lends itself to imaginary flights away from the beaten routine, the sordid set
ting of -'our daily life. A man who thus keeps his mind open to higher things
can get physical as well as intellectual profit from dipping in*Â» a book like
Henry Van Dyke's "Little Rivers." while David's quieting xxiii Psalm will
be like a draught of cold water in a thirsty land.
Vacations are splendid things if you can get them. But when you can't,
make the" best of the situation. THE PARSON.

âall except uncle and me. He used to
grit his teeth together till the sparks flew
when he saw me. I was afraid he'd bust
a blood vessel in one of them fits, so I
quit. I hated to let go of the old ranch,
but I'm pretty well fixedâ I'm superinten
dent here. It's Kyle's ranch, you know.
That's hl3 brandâ the queer-looking thing;
on the left hip of that critter, over thÂ©
vented : hashknife. Loys' Invention, that
is. She says it's a cberubltm. but we call
it the 'flying flapjack.* There's a right
smart lot of beef critters toting that sig
nal around this part of the country.
Kyle's one of the fellers that rises like a'
setting of breadâ quiet and gentle, but
steady and sure. He's going to the State
Legislature next year. 'Twon't do no harm

"Well, things went as smooth and easy
as bob-Elcdfing until It came lime for
Loys to be moseying back to college

"But Kyle was the man from the go in.
AnfiZSt tras right it ehou'd be so. If ever
two young people were born to make
trouble for ?;ach ether. It was Kyle and
Loys.
"A nlce3ecent fellow was Kyle. Noth
ing remarkable, you could say, and that
Â¦was one of his best points. Howsomever,
he had a head that could do plain think
ing; a pair of ehoulders that discouraged
frlvoling and he was as square a piece of
furniture as ever came out of a factory.
More'n that; he had quite a little educa
tion, saved his money, never got more
than good r.atured loaded and he could
ride anything that had four legs, from a
eawhorse to old tiger Buck, who could
kick both your feet out of the stirrups
and reach around and bite you- In the
email of the back so quick that the boys
would be pulling his front hoofs out of
your frame before you'd realize that' the
canter had begun. Nice horse. Buck. He
like to eat Jonesy up one morning before
Silver and me could get to the corral.
Lord! The sounds made my blood run
cold! Old Buck equealing like a boar pig
In a wolf trap and Jonesy yelling, 'Help!
Murder! Police!' Even that did not cure
Jones from sticking his nose where It
wasn't wanted. Wfcjr, onceâ but thunderl
It would take me a long" while to tell you
all that happened to Jones.
"One thing that didn't hurt Kyle any In
the campaign wes that he was most as
pood looking for a man as she* was for a
woman. They made a pair to draw to, I
tell you, loping o*-er the . prairie, full of
health and youngness! Loys was bo happy
it made you feel like a boy again to Bee
her. She told me In private that It was
wonderful how the air out here agreed

"Now, I had a minister, friend up In
" 'Of course they would,' I answered.
â¢But they don't get it. I'm 'foxy, 'i am.'
Still I was touched In a tender spot. That
young woman knew Just the right thing
to say, by nature. 'Well, what are you
young folks going to ao7* I asked them.
"They decided ihat they'd think It over
until the next day, Lut that turned out to
be too late; for what must Kyle, do. but
get chucked from bis horse and have his
leg broke near the hip. "You don't want
to take any love affairs onto the back of

was no such thing as downing that boy

"Now here was a hurrah 1 Loys she
dasn't cry for fear of uncle, and Kyle he
used the slnfulest language known to the
tongue of man. 'Twas the first time I'd
ever heard him. say anything much, but
he made It clear that it wasn't because he
couldn't. "':;; ; '
" 'What will we do, Red? What will we
do?' says he.
" 'Now,' says I, 'don't bile over like
that, because it's bad for your leg.'
"He cussed the leg.
" 'Go on and tell me what we can do,'
says he.
" 'When you ask me that you've pulled

Savvy? Well, I bring back the minister
at the same time. Angevlne he loses the
Jersey cow over In the canebrake, and
uncle and Angevlne go hunting her, for
not even Loys Is ace high In uncle's mind
alongside that cow. The rest Is easy.

Is understanding how to make a grand

horse to town and get married. Ten

Loys she laughed kind of teary, and Kyle
he looked red In the face and proud and
happy and ashamed of himself, and we all
felt loosened up considerable, but I told
him on the quiet, 'Take that fool urrinoff
your face unless you. want Uncle Jones to
drop the moment he sees you.'
"Now, they only had three day's left to
get an action on them, as that was the
time set for Loys to go. back to. college.
"Next day they held a council behind
the big barn, and they, called In Uncle
Redâ otherwise known as Big Red Saun
der, or Chanta Seechee Red, which means
'Bad-heart Red," In Sioux language, and
doesn't explain me by a durn sightâ to get
the benefit 'of his valuable advice.
" 'Skip,' eays I. 'Fly for town and get
married and come back and tell Jonesy
about It. -It's a pesky sight stronger ar
gument to tell him what you have done
than What you're going to do.' Â¦.
'/They couldn't aulte agree with that.
They thought It was sneaky.
" 'Man! Won't he slzz!' says Bob. And
you can't blame us old codgers If we had
a laugh at that, although It was such a
powerful serious matter to the young
sters.
" 'So do I,' says I. 'and I really think
the best we could do for 'em would be to
shoot Jones.'
"They came back at sunset when the
whole, world was glowing red, the same as
they were. I reached for the field glasses
and took a eaulnt at them. There was
no harm in that, for they were well-be
haved young folks. One look at their
faces was enough. There were three of
us In the bull-penâ Bob and Wind-River
Smith and myself. 'Boys/ says I, un
der my breath^ 'they've made the riffle.'
" 'No!' says they, and then everybody
had to take a pull at the glasses.
â¢"Well. I'm glad,' 'says Smithy. And
darn my buttons of that old hardshell'*
voice didn't shake. "They're two of as
nice kids as you'd find In many a weary
day.' says he, 'and I wish 'em all the luck
In the world.' ,
â¢Well, If you ain't got all the traits but
the long ears I miss my guess,' but I
made allowances, and says I, 'Well, about
that, I don't think I ought to say'any
thing; still If I bad only one eye left
I could see plain that her education's
finished. Bhe don't want any more col
lege, that girl don't.'
" Think notr says he, bracing up. And
then, by and by, they went out to ride,
for Jonesy was good to the girl, I'll say
that for him. He was willing to do any
thing for her In reason, according to his
views. But Kyi* wasn't In them views;
he waa out of the picture as far as hus

Of course, this does not mean that the
straight front Is going to be abandoned.
It Is quite possible with the best cut cor
set to give the long front and the straight
lines at the side toward the front, and
yet have a little curve at the waist.
One splendid thing in the new corset Is
Its decided spring in the front, so that
the diaphragm and lower ribs have plenty
of room for expansion and curve without
any confining pressure. The steels down
the front are just stiff enough to serve
their purpose and from there to the back
there is not a sign of a bone or cord, so
you can readily imagine bow limber and
loose they are.
It Is perfectly comfortable and cozy
without being eloppy. In fact. It is in
every sensÂ«f an easy stay that any woman
may wear and feel as trim in as she
would In her very best Sunday one. There
is no negligee sensation such as there
Is apt to be when only a ribbon girdle is
worn. In place of that there is a snug
ness and a fitness that Is a great relief
as well as a feeling of ease.
The back of this new boon Is cut rather
low above the waist and Quite high below,
so that there Is a very pretty curve from
the long hip to the lacings. There Is just
one fault to find with the straight front
corset, and that Is the pulling In of the
front so that It may answer as an abdom-
was not made up of fifty-eleven bones,
girded with several steels and cords, was
nothing that resembled a corset or that
could be used for a single instant. Un
less it was the regulation vise it was abso
lutely no good at all. So far as the ribbon
girdles were concerned they were light
and dainty, but you might Just as well go
without one at all as to wear the pretty
baubleâ that Is, so far as any support waa
concerned. .
The new athletic stays are usually made
of white coutllle, and they are cut almost
exactly on the lines of the approved street
models. They have the long dip over the
hips, with the upward curve toward the
front, which comes to ever so slight a
point directly over the abdomen. One
radically new thing about them Is that
they have not the long front straight, as
a board, so that the figure looks as thick
at the waist as it docs at the largest part
of the hips. A slight curve is natural,
and it is far more lovely than a straight
line; and it may be as well to mention
that this season will see the" return of this
curved waiat line, but Just how soon it
will reach this coast remains to be seen.
Paris sets the fashions, and they travel

The new straight front corset looks so

your number.
The Bllm. girlish girl is far better off. in
fact, Ehe does not need any consideration
at all. for she looks Just about as trim
and neat In a tight-fitting corset cover as
she would In a heavy boned affair and ehe
can bend, twist and turn to her heart's
content without being hampered In the
slightest.
On the other hand, the fashionable
stars. If they are cut well, are possessed
of good linesâ even doctors \ agree that
they ere the least harmful that have so
far been designed, but even though they
do admit of so much freedom and liberty
above the waist line they are so heavily
boned, steeled and stitched about the hips
and over the abdomen that they are ren
dered far from suitable for the swinging
of clubs, of a tennis racket or a golf club.
What Is wanted Is a corset that conforms
to prevailing modes while at the same
time tt remains light and flexible, and In
response to the numerous demands for an
article of this kind there Is now offered a
novelty In which may be found all the
Qualities perfectly blended.
Hitherto Ehe has taken to girdles,
which are suited to only t: i slender fig
ures, or else Ehe has put on herÂ«ordlnary
corset and let It out at the hips and waist
until she could bend with absolute free
dom, but even then the front steels,
which are long and stiff, were always Jab
bing her and giving gentle hints that
they were not to be forgotten.
Both these arrangements have their de
cided disadvantages, however, especially
for the girl whose bones are â¢well covered
with flesh. A girdle is nothing more than
a belt to hang her eklrt bands from and
there Is not the faintest suspicion of a
straight front in all Its rows of dainty
ribbon and lace.
The contrivances of the summer girl
have been so numerous that at first they
were funny, but they even passed the
comic etage and grew Into something pa
thetic and almost tragic. The girl who
cares enough for eports to give up her
beauty sleep certainly cares enough for
her personal appearance not to resemble
a first-class meal bag. Ehe knows full
well that it Is all very smart to be per
fectly devoted to golf, tennis or rowing,
but she likewise understands the full
value of looking chic and at her best.
The lassie of this generation has not lived
her twenty summers rt>r naught.
For the very first time on record peace
has been established. We now have the
pliable, easy straight front that is adapt
ed to the needs of the athlete.
*y~t 6 every girl who loves the outdoor
f I eporta knows, corsets and athletics
fâ 1 have long been on unfriendly terms
VÂ» I with each other. For some strange
reason, not entirely understood by
those who devote a part of every day to
athletics, the designers of feminine har
ness have made little or no study of a
ccrset suitable for euch exercise, and
they certainly have made no effort to
combine the straight front with the free
dom of movement required In playing
golf and tennis. .
A clever little Idea In the . trimmings of
corsets is the introduction of flowers,
small blossoms, of course, such as forget
me-nots on a light moire, lilies of the val
ley on a white batiste or almond blossoms
on pink satin. If you don't think such a
combination Is smart try It yourself and
find out whether or not you like the
effect.. .You certainly can afford a pale
pink fcatlste without a vestige of trim

For the very slender girl, who alone can
wear one of the fragile things without
looking unprotected and undressed, a r.pw
and popular cut has Just come in. The
girdle comes to Just a suggestion of a
point in front, while the back is cut off
square and so straight up and down as to
Invariably punch the wearer under the
shoulder. At Intervals there are strips of
cream or white batiste stiffened ever so
little with thin bones, and these upright
bands are held together by means of nar
row ribbons, which run around from the
front eteels to the back ones. The ribbons
are run underneath the batiste and end at
the front In a fluffy bow. "Where no
weight Is wanted on the hips, not even
the support of the skirts, a narrow piece
of batisteâ for durability â covered with
colored ribbon is fastened from the
shoulder pieces and comes to the front,
where It is fastened with tiny safety
pins. The pins may not look as well as a
silk eyelet, but they are by far the most
serviceable thing that has been found as
yet, and they permit of changes without
the least trouble, a thins greatly to be
desired In such a garment.
Strange as It may seem, there has been
but little demand for fancy fabrics and
dainty trimmings. There is always a flat
band of lace around the top of even the
plainest corset, and this Is drawn down
to a deep narrow point In front to give an
air to the affair of steel and bones. This
wee bit of trimming seems Quite enough,
for one 'seldom associates ornamentation
with vigorous exercises.
Girdles always have been and probably
always will be far more elaborate, as the
foundation Itself Is generally of moire silk
or satin In some delicate tint, fastened
under the bust with a pretty chou of rib
bon and lace.
This model ' does not confine anywhere.
and It Is not long enough to Interfere in
the many free movements of any of the

or old, wants to look other than trim, and

Not until you have worn one tn your

You may bend forward, backward cr to

the unboned portion will wrinkle with

It would be strange If It didn't, but It
curls up but slightly on account of the
gentle pressure of the garters, which are
fastened to the direct front and sides,
Jiut as they are to all corsets.
By the way, garters are as much a fea~

any other kind, and Just because there

My! what an opportunity to flaunt and
frill and to put on airs gradually, yet
when it comes right down to it the tin
pall should have right of way; undeniably
it was here first.
The worklngman probably needed a full
pall first and more than any one else, and
he needed quantity and not quality.' Nine
times out of ten a newspaper with four
or five immense slices of bread, some
boiled meat and a flask of cold tea was
plenty good enough for him and he prided
himself on getting out of carrying any
thing but the flask home.
Next the school children, who rode sev
eral country miles to school.' clamored for
lunches and they demanded something
that could be fastened on so th^y could 1
go flapping along their way, running
races and rejoicing generally. .Necessity
is the mother of invention," so '.Mrs.
Rancher promptly converted the smallest
lard pail that came into- her 4gt nds Into
the needed article. If the pail weighed ten
pounds she wasn't in the least daunted,
and by the time she had . cut it down,
dressed it up with a new handle, it
didn't know Itself. The color didn't make
any difference and the flaming red adver
tisement was allowed to stay where it
was. but the other side was duly decorat
ed with Its owner's name and many a free
fight averted in this way.
But when one has an automobile to
glide about in and nothing on earth to do
but seek pleasure it alters the case de

One of the first girls in town who had

Louizy shed so many tears over her
wash that morning that when the fat lit
tle Widow Pepper came' with her basket
she cast many sharply inquisitive glances
at the red rims of the forlorn maiden's
eyes.
"Looky here, Louizy Cottonwood," said
she at length, as the two trudged up to
the orchard, "you ain't been actln' the
baby 'cause you paw wants to marry
aginâ hev ye?"
Louizy shook her head.
"I wouldn't care a speck If he married
to-morrow, if he'd have the manners to
leave me an' . Sam Dorklns alone."
'."Humph,", said the widow, "whut's. he

"Couldn't more than kill ye. could her*

The widow trudged: forward In silent
self-communion, which lasted until . they
reached the' northern â¢ spy : apple .tree.
Louizy began to fill the basket with the
bright streaked 'windfalls, but Mrs. Pep
per plumped herself down comfortably
Into the clover.
"Sam Dorklns Is goin' on forty.** said
she, meditatively. "He's a sight nlgher
to my age than yours." .
Louizy paused suddenly In her task and
looked questlonlngly at the- widow.
"Oh, I was Jest a-thinkln'." the latter
observed carelessly, biting Juicily into a

Lyman leaned against the rail fence, his

The desirability of the widow had In
creased tenfold since this bold rival had
proclaimed himself so determinedly.

elaborate luncheon. Strange as It may
set-m in this particular case, sweet sim
â¢plicity and studied elaborations go hand
In hand and for once make a mighty fine
team.
For the new dinner rail is a thing to
rejoice exceedingly over, that Is, this
newest and this latest that has been es
pecially concocted for those who are
blessed with long pocketbooks, for verily
they are brim full when entirely empty.
There was a good old time when people
didn't lose much sleep over the nature of
the receptacle for their lunch. The main
Idea was that there ehould b* plenty of
It. and the plenty didn't signify, by the
"way, all sorts and conditions of delicacies
and tempting bits, but Just the very
plainest kind of food.
But when the smart set took to epend
lns; days In the woods It meant that
something was doing In the # lunch Una
and when automobile parties* were made
up right and left there was felt the dis
tinct need of a basket that could be
tucked away out of sight and that would
dispense with the thousar d and one nui
sances that have always been deemed
necessary.
When Mrs. Burton Harrison (nee
Crocker) came out here on a Jaunt the
very first thing ehe did was to send notes
to her friends asking them to meet her
in the morning and when the dozen or
more arrived one at a time and In twos
and threes she promptly packed them
Into traps and ln\-aded one of the pretty
cpots that are so numerous about Del
Monte.
For a whole day ehe had them to her
aelf and they visited to their hearts' con
tent, every now and then stopping to re
fresh the mortal man. for while picnics
are all right In their way it Is what goes
with them that has made them so terribly
popular.
However. as it hapens Mrs. Harrison
didn't have to drop In here from New
port to j= tart this round of outings.
Mrs. Will Tevis invited some London
friends to visit Yosemite with her and in
lookl.ig about for the necessary camping
outfit her eye fell upon what is termed
the "automobile" lunch basket, and In an
Instant ehe grasped Its possibilities.
The largest, and the one she carried
throughout the day, is a perfect basket.
To all outward appearances it is an ordin
ary hamper, looking more like a steamer
trunk than anything else, but Just wait
until that fastened cover Is raisedâ
a Jack-in-the-box couldn't or wouldn't sur
prise one more. All neatly folded and
packed away are the requisites of a meal.
On top is an oblong wooden piece that
develops et presto! change! and a
simple twist of the wrist into a table
quite large enough for four. It stands
en Its braced legs that fold under it and
Is perfectly firm and substantial.
That in Itself seems to make everything
comparatively simple; at least, there is
a definite place to put things. Just under
it the white and red tablecloths with the
napkins are folded, and then the Im

THE EVOLUTION OF THE
DINNER PAIL
11Â¦ / y_ Â¦ T . Is a strange thing that In thÂ« Western part of the United States there are Â»â¢
. l^pJKfiBSS^'/?! many peaks 14,000 feet and slightly over. For instance, in Dr. Garnett's Dictionary
KU^!*Bfift!l,>F of A 11 " 151163 , published in 1599 by the United States Geological Survey, the height of
V^^HKgjf I Mount Rainier is given as 14.526 feet. Mount Shasta In California as 14.3S0 feet and
"ilP^II^vSr! Mount Whitney 14,838 feet. In Colorado there are a number of peaks that exceed 14,-
I Â°Â°Â° feet Tbe 1 " 1 ' measured by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, appears to be Un
i/^^^^w|] conpahgre, 14,289 feet. Pike's Peak is given by the same authority as 14,103 feet.
JjjBj^wii^feryQ The dear people of Washington, Oregon, Nevada and a few of the other West
ern States, thought they had peaks much higher than Mount Whitney, so It should be very gratifying
to California that this magnificent mountain Is the top of the United States; that Is, of course, exduoV
Ing Alaska.
It is a remarkable fact that nÂ» mountain of this class has been measured as often or as accurately
as Mount Whitney, but it must be remembered, as with all other mountains, subsequent measurement*

due, of course, almost solely to more refined methods of measurements.
The formula now used for the barometrical reduction takes Into account differences In the tempera
ture of the whole air column and get a truer mean value than formerly. For the benefit ef the unsden
tlflo It might be explained that the mean temperature is the average from the bottom to the top of thÂ«
airâ not the temperature at any one point. Thus It may be very warm at the bottomâ say 90 degree**
and very cold at the topâ say BO degrees. The mean temperature would thereforÂ© be the average b*
tween the two extremes.
The atmosphere Is the earth's Jacket It Is its whole wardrobe. Its only garment. At night, wlies
the earth pulls the blankets around us, it draws the clouds down. By day the covers are thrown oft
The depth of this atmosphere used to be given at forty miles, but It Is known now to be less than hall
If the air were uniformly dense we would only have to go five miles high to get the upper limit,
but of course it la not. It keeps on getting rarer and rarer as five miles high to get to the upper limit.
be given it Is very likely that above fifteen miles there Is no appreciable atmosphere.
These are Important points for you to remember. As you doubtless know the barometer is an In
strument for determining the pressure of the air, and of course the pressure Is greatest at the bottom
of the atmosphere. Our atmosphere is made up of oxygen and nitrogen gases, a little argon and a
food deal of water vapor down at the bottom. Above 8000 feet there Is not very much water vapor,
though, at times, a certain amount will be carried up .above that limit.
Now at the bottom of the atmosphere the pressure has been found to be sufficient to balance a col.
cmn of mercury In vacuum 30 Inches high. As you go up In the atmosphere the pressure, the eiastlf
pressure, of these gases becomes less and less, but not at a uniform rate.
Thus In San Francisco the barometer will fall one Inch for about 1000 feet and the barometer o*>
Mount Tamalpias, which Is 2500 feet high, will read 27H Inches, while at the same time the barometer
at the Weather Bureau In the Mills building will read SO Inches. But when you ret up to a height
of 10,000 feet you then have to go about 1200 feet before the barometer will fall one Inch, and this le
one reason why Aneroid barometers can only give general results because they hare a fixed scale
like a watch dial. . Â¦'.
' Thus in going to the extreme height of Mount Whitney the barometer fell to 17 inches and a frac
tion, indicating that 13-30 of the whole atmosphere was below us. Half of the atmosphere would hart
bum below us at 18,000 feet.
Now Just think what that means. The pressure of the whole atmosphere at sea lerel Is 15 pound*
to the square inch, or 2160 pounds to the square foot and when the man who writes editorials for the
newspapers says we are living under high pressure he is quite right. We are living under terrifically
high pressure.
Allowing ten square feet of surface on the human body there Is a constant total pressure of ten tons
upon us. Of course we would be crushed by the weight of that pressure upon us were It not equally
distributed. At the top of Mount Whitney we had reduced that pressure' to about six tons, but we
did not know it, because as at sea level it was equally distributed. Our lungs, however, had to do more
,work to get the usual supply of oxygen.
The work of measuring the mountain Itself was a serious task, for which the most minute and
complete preparations had to be made to guard against the possibility of a fluke of any sort. The gen
tlemen who made up the surveying party proper that accompanied the Sierra Club on Its outlnjr to
Mount Whitney were Dr. G. K. Gilbert of the United States Geographical Survey, who came from
Washington to take part in the work; Professor Lawson of the Department of Geology at the Univer
sity of California; Marsden Manson of the Board of Public Works. Joseph N. Le Conte, who
is the boss mountaineer of the whole lot, and myself. Professor Plnchot of the Department of Ag-rlcul
ture and Dr. Merriam were expected, but could not go.
The barometers carried in the party were a small mountain barometer, the property of the Univer
sity of California, which was the same Instrument uÂ«ed by Carl Rabe in 1873 when the first measure
, ment of Mount Whitney was made. The other barometer, the one shown in the photographs herewith,
is a full size standard instrument, about 35 Inches long, with verniers reading to the .003 of an Inch,
This instrument also belongs to the University of California and was kindly , loaned for this expedition
by Professor Leuschner of the Students' Observatory. This Is also a historical Instrument, as It U
believed to have been used by Professor Brewer over twenty years ago. It was tested of course as
the Weather Bureau previous to the start and again when we returned to be sure that It recorded the
atmospheric conditions accurately. And in a journey of over one hundred and twenty-five miles, wbiÂ«a
distance we had to walk. I carried it every step of the way without doing It as much Injury as I did
in the short trip to the photograph gallery to get these pictures taken.
Our barometer on top of Mount Whitney on July 8 read 17.0652 inches at 64 degrees, and 10 on for
eight observations, not varying from first to last more than .00022 of an inch. These readings were made
'every half hour between 9 and 1 o'clock. First- 1 would read It and check it off. then Mr. La Conte
would do likewise. In this way neither knew what the other's reading was until w* compared notes.
In addition to this he took the triangulatlon with a new transit, the most perfect ever mads, which
tte bad just bought for this occasion.
Now at the same time that we were making our measurements on the top of Whitney one of thÂ»
observers in the Weather Bureau at Independence, 11,000 feet below us, was reading bis barometer at
the same minute. Just think of It, he was twenty miles away, but we looked right down upon h*"S
qtdte as one might look from the top of the Mill* building down into Montgomery street. At the
same minute, too, comparative readings of the barometer were being? made In San Francisco and la
Fresno, so that we should have a record of what was taking place at sea level, because If the pressure
of the atmosphere was rising at sea level it would not be fair to Mount Whitney, as It would main
Mount Whitney read high. On the other hand if the barometer was low at sea level It would noafcj
Mount Whitney read too low. As a matter of fact the barometer at sea level during the hours of our
observation on top of the mountain ranged from 30.08 to 30.02 Inches, or very nearly normal. Thus wt
were enabled to make our computations without any difficulty whatever. Taking the difference between
the pressure at sea level and .the registered pressure at the top of Mount Whitney and allowing- foi
the graduated scale of the fall as the ascent was made and we have Mount Whitney's actual height,
which I have set down as 14,515, instead of being several hundred feet higher, as set' forth in earlier.

Professor A. G., McAdie Adjusting His Barometer.
as the party began work on the summit.
As the present has now been made Mr.
Le Conte can afford to laugh with the
others at his scientific ardor and preoccu
pation.
Professor; McAdie with his characterls-
tio reticence cannot be Induced . to say
much about his part In this important ex
pedition, but In another column he has
dictated a brief account of what was ac
complished, showing, in a simple, direct
way how a mountain is measured, which
will be a revelation to a vast number of
people who are constantly singing the glo
ries of California without knowing; what
they really are.
vator shaft at Independence over twenty
miles away.
And it was on such a hazardous Jaunt
as this that Professor McAdie carried the
huge barometer shown on this page, step
by step every foot of the way. from the
Weather Bureau on top of the Mills build-
Ing in this city to the topmost point of
the United States and back again to the
Mills building without a single accident.
It Is a feat to be proud of. for carrying
a barometer is a more delicate and nerve
racking ' task than carrying a three
months' old baby the same distance. The
slightest jar, a sudden slip of only a cou
ple of feet, is sufficient to break the glass
and scatter mercury, like limpid moon
beams In a hundred crevices. Moreover it
has to be carried inverted, the bulb end
on top, " straight up and down, without
change or variation or the angle, hour
after hour, day after day of the whole
twenty-two days that were consumed In
making. the journey. For a single viola
tion of this ironclad rule. the only other
barometer in the party was broken soon
after the descent was begun.
Thus it was that Professor McAdie was
kept on the anxious seat throughout. the
entire trip. Bundled up in its wooden
and canvas case the barometer looks
like heavy-weight fishing tackle, and:
everybody in the party seemed possesed
of an insane desire to relieve the-pro
fessor of his precious burden. Ladles
especially would approach him and say:
"So sorry, professor, to see you so over-"
loaded. Can I relieve you on that leather
case?" -
But the famous weather man, with all
his hopes of settling a much mooted ques
tion, staked upon keeping that long, 80
inch' column of shining liquid Intact
would shy off like a school girl and grip
the barometer closer than ever until his
vigilance, upon which all the. success of
the expedition actually depended, was
strained to the point of distraction.
Thus crawling across the snow of. the'
That makes this peak nearly 400 feet
lower than everybody thought it was a
couple of months ago, and now that you
have it you may not think much of the
information. However, when you learn
something of the heroic qualities involved
In finding out that single fact â and facts
like this are worth knowingâ your opin
ion may be exalted in Just the reverse
ratio of Mount Whitney's decrease.
To begin with, it was a record breaking
party of more than 200 members of the
Sierra Club that left this city to explore
Mount Whitney and vicinity on June 25
last, and in It were many ladles, all ready
and eager to brave the dangers and hard
ships of mountain climbing: And dan
gers and hardships there were a plenty
before nearly 100 of themâ the greatest
number that ever made such an ascent
at one timeâ reached the top of America's
highest mountain.
From this city the party proceeded to
Vlsalla by rail and thence to Mineral
King by stage. From there on there was
nothing for it but to walk and walk and
walkâ a good 123 miles in all. before the
round trip back to the stage was com
pleted. First across the high ridge
through Farewell Pass to Bullion Flat
and thence to Coyote Creek, where the
permanent camp was .established at its
junction with Kern River, and Mount
Whitney still more than eighteen miles'
away to the northeast. And then the
real serious climbing had only begun. .
The feat is something stupendous, as
you may realize from the fact that
though the summit was only 18 miles
away in an air line, each and every one
of that big party had to walk over twice
that distance to reach the top. On the
side from which the ascent was made
the fall to Kern River is over 8000 feet
In 18 miles. On the eastern side it is even
'more sheer, and frightful, for within a
distance of 7 miles this snow capped
mountain has a fall of 11,000 feet. From
the top It is *ike. looking down an ele-
Whitney chimney, In the cold early dawn
of morning, when the foothold was haz
ardous and nerve racking, in the painful
upward climb, or coming down the slide
again, or fording Kern River on horseback
with the barometer raised high in the air
to keep it straight up and down and pre
vent It being Jolted by the' pack animals,
or hanging It high in the trees at night
bo that no prowlers might reach It and
then sleeping with one eye upon It until
the journey was resumed, or standing off
the porter on the train, who obsequiously
wanted to stow It awayln the hangers
overhead, the awful anxiety was ever
present and made eternal watchfulness
not only a virtue but a necessity.
Now that all his figures are complete,
beyond the peradventure of a doubt Pro
fessor McAdie laughs wl # th those who
laughed then, but for, twenty-two days It
was no laughing matter to any of the sd
entlfle- gentlemen who made up the first
party of mountain climbers. : -- ., ..
In like manner Mr. Joseph Le Conte,
one of the highest authorities In the West
on engineering, problems, â¢ nursed and
guarded a transit, a brand new instru

excellent merits of the Instrument,
purchased it on the spot and never again

realization of what he had done, just
Snowing tHe Difference Between San Francisco and Mt. Whitney.
The final and accurate height of Mt. Whitney was determined by Professor McAdie of the San Francisco Weather Bureau by the most delicate ba
rometrical measurement of the atmospheric pressure evor made. Thus the fall of the barometer from the.normal pressure of 30 inches at sea level was
â¢ shown to be 17 inches and a fraction on the extreme summit of Mt. Whitney; or, as Professor McAdie has indicated by the arrow line on the photograph
above, this magnificent California peak ascends nearly half-way through the whole depth of the atmosphere surrounding the earth. At fifteen miles high
rrofessor McAdie says there is no appreciable atmosphere at all. and the arrow at the bottom indicates where the mercury would fall to at that dizzy height,
rrorn these measurements Professor McAdie places the height of Mt. Whitney at 14,515 feet, which is considerably lower than it was ever given before, but
still the highest peak in the United States, excluding Alaska.â (Photos by Stanford Studio.)
DO you know how a mountain Is
measured, or are you one of those
who believe It Is done with a tape
line and a piece of chalk? Sounds
simple enough at first blush,
Coeen't It? But stop to think for a moment
of how you yourself would accomplish the
task were It thrust upon you. No easy
matter, Indeed. Well, can you Imagine
any one undertaking such a feat merely
for the- pleasure of the thing? Ah, that
Is the passion of science, without which
this would still be a dull, plodding, prl
modlal old world.
Much to the amazement of a great many
peopleâ scientists among themâ the tlp
top-knot of the whole United 8tatesâ
that Is, all of Uncle Sam's domain situ
ated this Bide of the Canadian frontier
has just received a very close- ehaye at
the hands of Professor A. Q. McAdie,
San Francisco's own weather bureau
man, and three or four kindred spirits In
the realm of advanced science, and in
consequence has lost a few hundred feet
of the dignified altitude hitherto credited
to its loftiness.
This Is Mount Whitney, one of the
proudest peaks In California and the most
measured mountain In the world. Since
the Golden State was wrested from thÂ«
Spanish padres It has been measured over
end over again and each time It shrinks
more and more, sometimes at such an
astonishing rate that one would not bo
surprised to hear that it had dried up
and withered like a eponge.
Seriously speaking, however, It It doubt
ful If the latest figures secured by Pro
fessor McAdie and his famous party will
ever be changed. They are the most com
plete and exhaustive that have ever been
made, and as the Instrument* with which
the measurements were taken are the
most* perfect of their kind , obtainable
anywhere. Professor McAdle's statement
that Mount Whitney Is 14,515 feet high
may be accepted as absolutely accurate
and ccr.Ec<;uent!j' final.

An eye bath is a dally necessity. Few. people know
how good a cold water bath is for the eyes. But it
should not be with a sponge and cold water, for this

better for the eyes to be open In cold water. ' This

/ / ONSIDERIXG how all-important the eyes are to good
I /Â«. looks. It Is surprising- bow they are neglected and even
\JJ Ill-treated. '
lÂ£ A pair of fine eyes will redeem an otherwise plain faca
and a girl possessed of them and a good complexion may
easily consider herself a beauty.
Eyes, to be beautiful, must bo bright, dear and of good
color. Not only is good health essential to this condition,
but good care of th* eyes themselves.
On awakening In the morning, the eyes should not be
exposed suddenly to a bright light. A few moments should
be allowed to elapse to accustom them to the half-light of
the bedroom before drawing up the blinds and admitting the
full light of day.
Too much sleep and too little sleep are alike Injurious to
the eyes, the former debilitating them through the prolonged
tnactlon In which It keeps them, the latter from fatigue. Then
â¢ gain, the eight may be spoiled by using:, the eyes too little
This Is only & degree less harmful than using them too much.
Too strong a light end profound and long continued dark
ness both predispose the eye to various maladies, some of
them very serious. Sudden transitions from darkness to light,
and the reverse, are especially injurious.
The pupil of the eye expands in darkness, and. If It be
suddenly exposed to a bright light, contraction not taking
place readily, paralysis of the retina, with consequent
blindness, may ensue. The sudden transition from light
to darkness Is attended with less serious, but no less
certainly injurious consequences.
The reflection of the light on the seashore, or any
brilliant surface, a predominance of glaring br of dark
colors In the rooms where much of the time Is spent,
and looking long at rapidly moving objects are all in-
Jurlous to u.e eight. Soft colors are both most pleasing
and most beneficial to the eye. Qreen Is the color most
favorable to the eye, as it exercises the muscles moder
ately without fatiguing them. Black or very dark colors
maintain them in a state of inactivity.

His uncle beckoned urgently, prevent

"I suppose you know my nephew and

Then he burst into a roar of laughter at
the blank faces of the wilted young con
spirators.
Mr. Sanborn had arrived, shaken hands
with the gentleman and was speaking to
the young lady, who listened with serious
attention.
"Good heavens!" Maurice cried aghast.
"If he should say anything Impertinent

. "Oh, Maurice! And she the president's

"Stop whomâ the thief?" a young man
queried laughingly.
They trailed through tha crowd in an
agony of apprehension. There was no
pleasantry In the situation for them.
"Oh, no, thank yon. We win meat in

repressed merriment.
"Very good, young ladyâ but not quite

ha breathed an "ah, ha!" of satisfaction,
adding with a chuckle, 'T sea, X seat But
I think the little joke will boomerang!"
She detached herself presently and made
her way to him. murmuring an apology
for omitting to mention that she had at
tended tha university tha previous year.
To his eager question she admitted that
she had met Maurice. To his equally
eager question concerning the milkmaid,
she hesitated uncertainly.
Which was not strange, seeing that Mr.
Sanborn had no name for her, tha young
blockhead having alluded to her merely
as "a farmer's daughter, tha girl of my
choice."
"I am 8 ure that short, thick, homely girl
is the one; the third from the end," Mr.
Sanborn groaned. *
"Oh, perhaps not." she comforted, sub

"She's the one." ha assented as positive

the state of the weather. The opening ex

In spite of his heated resentment, Mr.
Sanborn swelled with pride at tho over

joined In the applause that called him out
again and again.
"He's pulled them off. as I told you he

with outstretched hand. "Well. Uncle, I

"Um-m, yes, pretty well," his unela

the thick, homely girl across tha hall.
Seeing which, Maurice said with a sly

Mr. Sanborn broke In. exclaiming,

draperies of clinging lace, was walking
up the room.
"I am sorry to have to ten you. Lord

she would have spoken were never said.
The tall, handsome man In evening

"Noâ no! " she cried, and drew away.
"It isn't right! I must marry Lord Les

I never objected. I didn't knowâ"
"Thatâ no, I shan't touch you again

Her color came back with a rush.
"Is this " she faltered. "Is thisâ love?"
He laughedâ a low, contented, joyous
laugh.
"I will answer that only with you la

She hesitated. Aware of a bewildering
sense of happiness, she still hesitated.
But his eyes compelled her. She took a
step forward, and again his arms enfold

Homeward bound, an hour later, they
secured their mail at the village. In the
green gloom, gold-pierced, of the forest
pathway the girl sat down to read her
letters. Leaning against a tree, grave
and silent. Jardine stood watching her.
"Oh!" she cried out suddenly, and
turning very pale. "He is coming. His

downright dread In the eyes that looked
piteously up at her companion. "Lord

He nodded. "You've never seen him?"
he asked. "He is old, I supposeâ and

"Noâ oh, no! It was all arranged.
But they say he Is young and good. He
is very rich, of course. I didn't think I'd

TO CLING for more than an hour to
the disabled rudder of a sailing
I vessel pitching and tossing in the
I wlJg embrace of a Cape Horn gale:
to nan^ to the flapping blade of
etcel when the ship's stern lifted high
above the water and not to let go when
the bark burled her after end deep in the
icy waters; to breathe and work during
the shorj Intervals in the air; to grip and
think wÂ£lle being dragged down Into the
depths v thls was the part for which
Harry Williams, mate of the American
bark Homeward Bound, volunteered
when a vicious wave smashed the ves
sel's rudder stock in a gale off Cape
Horn and this the role he carried out.
It was as spectacular a piece of daring
as ever soldier performed on the field of
battle, as brave an act as is recorded
anywhere In the stirring annals of the
sea. It saved the ship and the lives of
all on board.
The modest hero declares it was all
nothing, end vigorously protests against
the making of any fuss about a task he
performed in the regular line of his duty
and only because he was the first man
ready to try it. Any of his shipmates,
he says, would have undertaken the job
without hesitation.
The bark Homeward Bound arrived in
Ban Francisco a few days ago after a
long voyage from Antwerp. She came
Into port using a jury rudder. It was to
fix this jury rudder that Williams so
bravely risked his life. Nautical ex
perts who have examined the makeshift
stearins gear' pronounce It the most per
fect of temporary appliances they have
ever Inspected. Captain Thompson, the
bark's commander, declares that the ves
sel handled better with the improvised
arrangement than ehe ever did before,
and that it was possible to replace the
useless steering gear with such a satis
factory substitute was all due to the
skill and nerve of Mate Williams.
The accident occurred at 2 o'clock in
the morning of May 21 in the depth of the
Cape Horn winter, when the vessel was
In longitude 77 west, latitude 57 12 south,
where the waves never rest and the water
Is always icy cold. The vessel was making
a gallant flg!* against the fury of a ter
rific southwetster. The Homeward Bound
Is as sturdy a vessel as any turned out
from the yard of Harland & Wolfe.
That aouthwester. however, was all she
could manage. Big seas battered her
hull: Epray splashed high as the royal
yards and the decks were filled to the
rail with surging brine. Suddenly an
avalanche of water launched Itself
against the uplifted stern, striking with
terrific force. There was a crack, sharp
and loud as a rifle report, and the helms
man found the wheel useless in his hands.
It resolved as before, but its control over
the rudder was gone and the big ship
was at the mercy of the- gale. As the
Homeward Bound yielded herself to the
fury of the storm, such sail as was set
was ripped Into ribbons and before a soul
knew what had happened the vessel was
wallowing helplessly under bare poles.
Within an hour, however. Captain
Thompson had set enough canvas to en
able him to handle the vessel, steering
her with the aid of the sails. The ship
was still in grave danger, however, and
would be at the mercy of any change In
the sale's mood as long as the rudder
was beyond control.
Investigation showed that the rudder it
self was all right, but that the stock had
been shattered beyond possibility of re
pair. The Homeward Bound Is a steel
vessel and her rudder, of the same ma
terial, weighs more than two tons. This
massive blade was swinging freely on Its
hinges and threatening with every roll
of the vessel to stave a bole in her plates.
To secure this flapping wing of steel was
an immediate necessity, as a hole in the
etern of a steel ship laboring in a Cape
Horn southwester means rapid transit for
all hands to Davy Jones' locker. It had
not only to be securea; control over its
movements had to be re-established, ai?
without better steering facilities than af
forded by the nails, all Captain Thomp
son's seamanship could not have saved
the vessel from destruction.
The tasK undertaken by Williams was
to make fast two chains, one on each
6lde. to a ring or shackle on the outside
edge of the rudder. When the vessel lies
on even keel this shackle is about four
feet below the surface of the water. Ai
she pitched and dived in the mad sea off
the Horn the shackle was sometimes high
In the air, and, when the vessel's stern
settled, as It did until the poop deck was
almost submerged, the shackle was many
feet below the surface.
Williams was lowered from the end of
the mlzzcn boom and made several at
tempts to pass a wire rope through the
shackle as the vessel came up by the
stern. He soon found, however, tnat this
plan would not serve. He was out of
sight of Captain Thompson, who attended
the line on which he was suspended and
the lowering and raising could not be
managed with sufflcient expedition to give
the mate a chance at the shackle as it
emerged from the water.
This plan was abandoned after several,
wild dives at the swaying rudder, and
Williams, after studying the situation
more carefully, resolved to take the one
desperate chance upon which lay the only
hope of success.
He seized hold of the shackle. As the
rudder swayed and banged he was flung
from H)de to side with a force that would
have loosened anything less sure than a
sailor's grip. Ho.dlng on with one hand,
he made frantic efforts with the other to
pass the' wire rope through the shackle!
Then, as the vessel settled, rudder,
shackle and sailor disappeared beneath
the boiling sea. Up she came again. A
long breath, another shaklng-up as the
unsecured rudder slammed from Fide to
ffidt, one more attempt to pass through
the wire rope and again tne plunge.
He took occasional spells of rest. Swing
ing wildly In the bight' of a rope, soaked
with icecold water, the cruel wind of that
winter gale biting to the marrow, it was
rest only in contrast to the wild rides on
the swaying rudder, and, even at that,
only a sailor would have called It rest.
Between the rests and the wild rides,
however, the task was performed. More
than a score of times Williams made that
submarine trip with the elusive shackle.
He passed through the ring two wire
ropes to which those on deck attached
heavy chains and with the wire hauled
them through the rudder shackle. These
chains Williams then shackled In place
and his work was done.
He fainted when hauled on deck, but
a liberal draught of grrog end a vigorous
rubbing down with alcohol revived him
and before evening he was on deck at
tending to his duties. â¢'. >
While Williams was fighting his battle
under the stern thÂ© men on deck lashed
a boom across the poop and projecting
at each alAe. The rudder chains were
passed through pulley blocks at the ends
of this spar and around a drum made
by boarding over the screw of the steer-
Ing gear. When Williams made the chains
fast the makeshift tackle was hauled
tight an/1 the Homeward Bound's rudder
was in commission again.
Williams. Is a man of about 38 years.
He has had an eventful life, and the
episode nf the Homeward Bound's jury
rudder was only one of a number of stir
ring events In which he has participated.
He served In the Siamese navy and once
held a commission in the navy of Den
mark, his native land. He was navigator
of the Colombian warship Itata when she â¢
was blown up at Panama with great loss
of life during the late revolution in' the
Central American republic. He expects
to leave the Homeward Bound In a few
days and Is seriously considering the ad
visablllty of settling down to a quiet Ufa
ashore.

U^K^W^J'h Where night is day. and work is play and all the year a
42Â»(<l In the heart of this -Wonderful Isle, In the heart of the
Wonderful Sea, 0 â¢ '
Is a Wonderful Kingdom of WonÂ£Â«rfu.DThings that strives for you and me.
Now, Tommy and Bess and Robby andTess and dear little frolicsome Grace,
Gather dose by and quietly sit, and 111 tell dl this wonderful place.
Back in the olden, golden times when man trod not this earth,
This Wonderful Kingdom in the sea was given a gladsome birth.
At first the living numbered oneâ Peter Pumpkin, big and yellow.
Who whiled away the dreary hours, a most unhappy fellow.
For years and years he roamed about upon this lonely isle, .
And for years and years and years he never smiled a smile.
At last the corners of his mouth drooped so low they -pained him,.
But when he sought for medicine the Laughter Spirit gained him.
On the brink of a placid pool, one morning bright and cheerful,
This lonely Peter Pumpkin stood, his eyes both sad and tearful.
All at once he saw below himself all upside down, t
And the longer that his eyes did look the fainter grew his frown.
He bended down upon all fours, his eyes now bulging wide,
And when the reflection did likewise, he with wonder cried.
He picked a pebble from the soil and tossed it at his double,
Who imitated every move and caused a peck of trouble.
Both Peter Pumpkins nimbly dodged the pebbles that were thrown,
And both avoided injury, as 'twas subsequently shown.
Plump Peter Pumpkin on the land keenly felt the fun,
And he laughed to watch the antics of the other playful one.
Finally he laughed so .hard his sides grew tired and weak,
And as he looked and laughed the more, tears streamed down his cheek.
He tried to stop, but all in vain, and the fainter did he feel,
Until, at la his poor sides split" and he began to reel*
He rolled into the placid pool and weakly splashed about;
But just before he sank away two tiny seeds hopped but.
These little fellows swam ashore, so tired they could not stand, \\ i
And very soon they were asleep, safe -upon the land.' --' V V" ,Â¦- /
Whllothey snoozed a great rain 'fell and forced them under ground, j._''
And > when they woke the world was dark and they could not move around
Long they Btrived for the wanning light, etch earnest little fellow, ;^
Until; at lastj tho sun did make each one a Â¦ pumpkin yellow, Â¦'â¢Â¦"Â¦.' , - "V
When they wire big enough to walk they left their place of blrtb - r 'Â¦
And set about exploring- the wonders of the earthl
Hand in hand they trudged along, through vale and over hJU, -
Each Httlo heart a-beatin* with a glad and eager thrilL
At last they reaches a sttn-kissed plain, shimmering all In green,
And there these little Pumpkin chaps thought out a wondrous scheme.
Til tell you what well do," said one, in joyous, happy strain;
"Well sti a kingdom of our own and havo a king ; to reign."
"Glorlousr the other cried, and he Jumped up in the air) .
"But who shall be the monarch gay and who the throne shall share TT
"I the ruling prince must be," spoke the other little man, ..
"For I deserve the honor proud for thinking of the. plan." . ,Â¦
"But what of me?" his brother said, and gloom flashed to his faceâ :
"Tis not fair that you should 'reign and I should have no place."
"You," the other quickly said, in tones benign and fair, >
"Are now and " always shall be my prized apparent-heir.".
1 do not like your plan at all; you'd have by far the best,
And I should do all of the work and you'd do naught but 'rest.
Tis just as fair that I should be the prince of all the realm.
And Fd be quite as wise as you In guiding at the helm." '
For hours and hours they .talked away, and each was sorely nettled,
And both of them could plainly see the thing could not be settled.
At last' their eyes began to blink and their drowsy heads to nod,
Till finally they fefl asleep on tbo plain that no man trod.
After awhile one's eyes did ope and sweep the silent green, ; %
Turning to ! Ms .brother \ near who /dreamed in peace serene. V ' â¢
"Ah, ha r he would have shouted if he had been alone.
But he kept his tongue all to himself and planned to win the throne,
Softly to his f eei hie got and stood beside the " other,'
Who* snoozed all unsuspecting of his cowardly thieving brother.
"By my stars, mj cfiance has comer the scheming fellow thought.
And quickly drewhis arms about the Pumpkin knowing naught.
lie hugged and squeezed with all his might, a strain on every muscle,*
Until hit victim cried "Enough,", and an end came to the tussle.
â¢"What do I see?* the victor cried, aghast and trembling greatly!
"You ar<Â» no longer plump" and round; indeed yon are unshapely.
Your head is high, your neck is crooked, your body Is much smaller, j
Which all combines to make you look very much the taller." . ,/i
In time the humor spirit touched the Pumpkin round and plnmp,
And he, with laughter keen and loud, high in the air did jump.
''Indeed, you are the funniest thing my : eyes have ever seen, . f '..<->Â¦
And no' longer can you "style* yourself a Pumpkin of my â¢**w t
Your claim to kingly honors win now no longer wash;
And, indeed, I must remark it, you're a most unseemly /squash' P
And so In aftertimes, my sweets, this Pumpkin, strange and odd.
Went about as Crookneck Squash In the land that no man trod.
.The funny pair continued on, through wilderness and mead.
Until, at last, a thicket patch checked them in their speed.
They puffed and panted as they trudged, often falling down-
When all at once the Pumpkin queer tripped o'er a paper crown.
But Peter" Pumpkin, schemer sharp, picked up the wondrous find"
And placed It proudly on his head and said onto his kradt *
"It fits me well,' you will .agreeyand "surely -I must wear it}
It will not fit your funny head, and I fear that you would tear It 1 * â¢>!
â¢â¢'Tis right that I should try Itoiyfor maybe It win fit?"-
And if it does, my brother, proud, I on the throne shall sit, 1 "
Crookneck Squash raised aloft the crown of paper
And let It slip down o'er his head, and then began to caper.
"'Tis safer 'round my neck, you see, than on your shining pate.
For the breezes cannot blow, it off and shock our ship of state."
But Peter Pumpkin, s elfish one, must have It all his way.
And forced the fearsome Crookneck Squash to quit his claim that day.
And so it' came to be, my pets, this Kingdom did beginâ
With Peter Pumpkin reigning prince, and Crookneck under. Urn.
The Kingdom grew at wondrous pace, andâ ah, I see you're blinking.
So now 111 stop and tell of more when I've' had time for thinking.

Assessor Dodge then read a letter from
Thomas Magee &' Sons, in which it was
stated that in all sales made by that firm
tho prices given were correct, but that
when" sales were mado by other' firms
they had to rely mainly on "reports of
prices, which were largely hearsay and
which they had no means of verifying.
Later Dodgo read a list of Â¦ properties
sold, all of which had been uttd by the
board's expert in making hfs deductions
relating to the assessments of mortgages.
Dodge said these sale? would show the
fallacy*of depending upon real estate re
ports for the purpose of making compari
sons; of , values. Ho said Thomas Mageo
&/ Sons had admitted the correctness of
the revisions in prices he (Dodge) had
made' from' the published' reports.: Ono
pieco" of .'property reported- to have, been
sold for $300,000 ,had actually brought J250,
000, said Assessor Dodge. Another piece
reported sold for" ?60,000 actually, brought
but â¢ $52,000, and to on- through a long- list,
which went to show that a little booming
had been -dono in the properties which
were changing hands frequently.
Dodge, further declared that the attempt
oT the expert of the board to show that
he had not assessed the mortgages re
ferred to according to the value of the
property, as determined by sales reported
by Thomas Magee & Sons' Real Estate
Bulletin, wus manifestly unfair. The ex
pert. Dodge asserted, had taken reports of
sales made. on a. rising market and in a
section of tho city where a boom was in
progress and months after the assessment
rolls had been completed.
PRICES ARE INFLATED.
In San Francisco, Dodge said, the banks
will lend two or three times aÂ« much
money on gilt-edge city property as they
will on country properties. He then read
a number of letters from the officials of
savings banks in San Francisco, in all of
which the statement was made that on
city property loans to the extent of 80 per
cent of .the valuation were made, whereas
on country property the amount ran from
30 to 33 1-3 per cent.
the property Itself, was assessed for, while
In San Francieco the reverse is the case.

a.t making an Increase In the roll, j He
proceeded at once to show* the injustice
of the board's method of treating, mort
gagÂ« values in San Kranelsco.
The, board's expert had returned a long
list embracing more than 3003 mortgages
â¢n which the assessed value of the mort
gagee, was eet opposite the assessed value
of the property on which the mortgages
were made. ' ,-\-
Aseessor Dodge said that in this list
the dates of the mortgages were not
given, but were contrasted from the aa
eessed - property valuations of 1902. He
rea-3 down the list which showed that
the mortgage values were greater than
the value of tho property. Dodge then
ehowed that under his assejsment for this
year theee property values arc In ex
cess of tho mortgages and the claim of
the board's expert that $1,500,000 had es
caped taxation in this manner had no
foundation in fact.

Dodge declared the list to be valueless
for the purpose of equalising: the assess
ment for 1D03. lie said he did not like the
idea of the board's expert making out the
list as he did. for it put the city and the
Assessor, apparently, in the 1 position of
assessing mortgages at a far lower! figure
than the value of the' properties given as
security warranted. Again. Dodge said,

Judge F. W. Boyle, a Commissioner of

touring the Yosemlte, arrived at the Pal
ace yesterday.
"Your officials are supremely just and
have always treated me with such con
sideration that I am confident the Wash
ington Government will appreciate my
country's position and not be disposed
to act impatiently."
"I am going to Washington to do what
I can to preserve the good relations be
tween your country and mine. I think
the reports of the troubles In Turkey are
exaggerated, but I know all is not well
there.
"Can you wonder that a feeling of, I
won't say hostility, but coldness Is arous
ed among my countrymen toward those
who are forever blaming them? I do not
think the European powers are as glad
as they profess to be that your squad
ron has gone to Turkish waters. They
would be still more dissatisfied if they
found that the Washington Government
stood ready to help Turkey in her trou
bles.
"But we have the missionaries and my
Government earnestly- strive* to protect
them. It is merely Justice, however, that
when the missionary comes to Turkey he
â¢hould confine, himself to the religious and
intellectual training of his pupils and not
endeavor to make them dlssatinned with
their present form of government. I am
sure you do not expect us to encourage
the undermining of .our Government.
"You ask me about the massacres in
Turkey. These unfortunately do occur.
But do they not occur in Christian lands?
No one would be so foolish as to hold your
Government" responsible every time a
negro Is lynched. Tour Government de
plores these outrages, but it cannot al
ways prevent them. So does Turkey de
plore the massacres, and we are to-day
doing all in our power to prevent them.
And yet If a massacre occurs in Bulgaria
the cry goes up: 'Down with the Turks.*
And when my Government sends troops
to Bulgaria to punish the guilty the same
cry is heard. It is always the Turk who
gets the blame.
"Suppose I should establish in Wash
ington a school for negroes and my teach
ers should tell the negroes attending that
school that they ought not to submit to
lynching and should rebel. Do you think
I would remain In . this country lonr, or
that my school would flourish? This Is

iterated to-day that the message was
transmitted through the British Embas

Consul at Beirut. No correction has been,
sent either by the Embassador or by the
Consul.
No Denial of Story of Assassination
Received.
LONDON IS PUZZLED.
â¢'Now, there is that other troublesome
question of missionaries. Do not under
stand me as criticizing the missionary,
for I must again remind you we are tol
erant people. ; - We have allowed the mis
sionaries great liberties, and. with what
result? I read" in the American papers
AS TO MISSIONARIES.
"If some of your States question the
quality of your medical schools Is It sur
prising, that my .Government .insists on
examining' American physicians? ,And
why, if your physicians are so thoroughly
educated, do they object to standing an
examination when they come to Turkey
to practice? It will require time to adjust
this question;, but. you know, the Turk
is very tolerant, and I am sure my Gov
ernment will take a liberal view of the
matter. . . .
. "No, I have not heard that. I hope It is
not that bad., Of course, if your Govern
ment desires it I shall go, but let us not
take such a serious view of the situation.
What demands do you refer to? Patience
is necessary in international affairs. My
sovereign has promised what you have
asked, or the post of your requests, and
he will certainly carry out his promises.
You must remember that my country is
very much occupied at present, and ' I
hope the Washington Government will ap
preciate this and not Insist on a final set
tlement of all controversies until the In
terior troubles have quieted.
"You have asked for certain privileges
for doctors and students. You want your
physicians admitted on certificate to
practice in Turkey. My Government is
very careful of the kind of doctors it li
censes to practice. If your Government
would itself approve the diplomas of. the
American schools of medicine your physi
cians would be admitted without exam
ination. This is the reason that the
French and other European physicians
are admitted on certificate. The medical
schools in those countries are under the
supervision, as it were, of the govern
ments. In this country a man licensed to
practice In one State would in some cases
not be allowed : to ' practice in another
without examination.
"Despite the reports to the contrary,"
he replied, "and the efforts of the Euro
pean powers to have it otherwise, I be
lieve the affair was without political sig
nificance, and that the attack was made
by a personal enemy of your Vice Consul.
The unfortunate feature of.it is that,
coming at this time, the revolutionists
will attempt to profit by the occurrence
and it is this which renders the situation
grave." Â¦ -. Â¦
"Do you think your Government real
izes the seriousness of purpose with
which the squadron goes to Beirut?"
"My Government would be very unwil
ling to believe that anything but the best
relations exist between it and the United
States. Of course, the worst may come,
and relations be broken off, but 1 do not
think so. I am hoping the other way. I
can think of nothing more disastrous than
a severance of diplomatic relations be
tween the two countries. We will not
speculate about that."
"Has your Excellency heard any rumor
that the Washington Government's pro.
gramme calls /or a seizure of one or more
ports in the event that the Sultan refuses
the American demands, and that this in
turn would be followed by the recall of
Minister Lelshman, and possibly your own
departure from the United States?"
PATIENCE IS NECESSARY.
Â¦ "I appreciate fully the reasons for the
dispa-tch of the American squadron.
Rear Admiral Cotton Is carrying his
shipa to protect the lives of American
citizens, but have you considered that
this may have the opposite effect and
stimulate the revolutionists to further
outrages, thereby increasing the- difficul
ties In the way of the Porte's protection
of foreigners? I must refuse at this time,
however, to comment on this. I fervently
hope immediate relief will be forthcom
ing." '
"Have you any idea what motive in
spired the attack on Mr. Magelssen?" fie
was asked.
"I was profoundly distressed." he said,
"at the news from Beirut, and believed
there must have been some mistake, be
cause I had heard nothing about it from
my Goernment. The news to-day con
firms this belief.
"What I may say about the Turkish-
American relations will. I hope, be re
ceived in the spirit in which it is said, for
it has always been my endeavor during
the three years that I have represented
the Porte in the United States to work al
ways for the better relations of the two
countries, and I shall certainly not cease
in my efforts in this direction at a critical
time like this. But what can I say? It
now appears that your Vice Consul was
not assassinated." .
"But does that lessen the gravity of the
situation materially?" the Minister was
asked. Â¦ ,,
"However that may be, you must admit
that my Government has done all that it
could be expected to do. As soon as the
local authorities learned of the affair
they called at the American consulate
and expressed their regret and promised
to^do all in their power to apprehend and
punish the guilty, person. In addition, the
Foreign Office has offered the strongest
official assurances to the same effect.
FEAR OF. OUTRAGES.
Chekib Bey has slept little since hear
ing the report of Mr. Magelssen's at
tempted assassination. The night follow
ing he walked the floor until 6 o'clock the
next morning. When a press representa
tive called at the modest little cottage at
Say v!Ue to-day, where the ' Minister has
established Bummer headquarters, the
diplomat had Just read in the morning pa
pers of the mistake in Minister Leish
man's message and was evidently greatly
relieved. He talked freely of the pres
ent situation and did not conceal the fact
that ho thought the outlook bad. Some
of his remarks regarding Turkey's inter
national complications, he requested,
should be considered confidential, but
in the hope that he might be able to say
something to- the American people that
would relieve the tension of public feeling
here, ho consented to the publication of a
large part of the conversation.
VIEWS OF A DIPLOMAT.
Until he receives Instructions from Con
stantinople CheKib Bey will not request
the Washington Government to withdraw
the squadron, but he will call Secretary
Hay's attention to the situation in Tur
key, hoping that the State Department
might do somethlne to relieve the em
barrassment of the Porte.
No word has been received by the Min
ister of the attack on the American Vice
Consul at Beirut and he has been with
out official advices concerning events in
Turkey for more than a week, lie hopes
to find -instructions awaiting him in
Washington, upon which' will depend
largely the scope of his conference with
Secretary Hay. There is a possibility that
the Washlnston Government may be of
service to the Sultan in solving his inter
national difficulties, and it is this, as well
as the local troubles at Beirut, which is
calling Cheklb Bey to Washington.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 29.-A Walla
Walla, Wash., special says: Locked to
gether In a deadly embrace, George Or
tell and Fagln Scott were found by the
police early this morning between the
Mill Creek bulkhead and the creek bank
In the rear of a notorious Rose-street re
sort. Ortell was bleeding from thirteen
knife wounds inflicted by Fagln during
the awful struggle.
The origin of the fight Is unknown, but
it is thought by the police that It was
caused by a woman. Scott was arrested
and will have a preliminary hearing as
Eoon as the result of his victim's wounds
are known. "Ski" Fagln, aÂ£ Scott is bet
ter known, passed the door of the resort
while Ortell was talking to a woman late
last night, and waited at the corner of
the building for him. When Ortell walked
past Scott struck him a heavy blow and
both men clinched. In the struggle they
rolled off the sidewalk twenty feet down
the bank and stopped against the bulk
head. Ortell rs a restaurant man. His
faco is horribly disfigured by the pocket
knife used, but in spite of his terrible in
juries it is believed he may live.
Special Judge Robbins this afternoon
formally overruled a motion for tho
granting of a new trial to Caleb Powers,
convicted for the third time of complicity
in the Goebel conspiracy, and sentenced
him to be hanged. After a declaration of
the prisoner: "I am not guilty, Judge,"
the court fixed November 25 "next as the
day for the execution. The attorneys for
the defendant secured the granting of an
appeal for the case to the Kentucky
Court of Appeals, and if unsuccessful
they may try to get the United States
Supreme Court to take it under considera
tion.
Powers was the coolest man in the court
room when the verdict was read and the
sentence pronounced against him. He
was Immediately removed to the Scott
County Jail, to be held there pending the
appeal of his case to the higher courts.
Powers refused to say anything after the
rendition of the sentence except that he
had said all he cared to say In his speech
to the Jury.
A telesrram from Indianapolis states
that ex-Governor W. S. Taylor said:
"'xhls verdict affects me much. I can
not say a word."
the verdict except to express his surprise
that such a result could be reached f rom '
the evidence presented and to announce
that he would take an appeal and con
tinue the case to the last resort. When
Powers secured his former new trials a
majority of those on the appellate court
were Republicans, but It is now composed
of Democratic Judges. As Commonwealth's
Attorney Franklin shook hands with each
juror after they were dismissed Powers
watched the greetings closely, but at no
time did he show any sign of breaking
down. Powers is regarded as a strong
man. He was elected Secretary of State
on the Republican ticket headed by W.
S. Taylor in 1S99, but served only a few
months, as all the State offices were con
tested by those on the. Democratic ticket
headed by William Goebel. The former
trials of Powers were before Judge James
E. Cantrill of this city, but he was barred
from sitting this time and Governor Beck
ham appointed Judge Robbins.

THE POLICE AND POSSE
to murder Governor William
Goebel In January. 1900, to-day found the
defendant guilty and Imposed the death
sentence.
Powers was sentenced to Imprisonment
for life In his former trials for complicity
In the conspiracy. It was on his motion
that he Becured the new trials each time.
The verdict to-day caused great excite
ment among the friends of other defend
ants in these cases.
The third trial of the defendant closed
shortly before noon. Several hundred freo
p'.e crowded the courtroom when the ver
dict was read, and Intense silence pre
vailed. The Jury was polled and each
man declared the verdict of guilt to be
his finding. Powers sat unmoved, while
his attorneys asked for time to make a
motion for a new trial. The jury declines
to state what occurred in the Jury-room.
Arthur GoebÂ«l, the brother of the vic
tim, broke down from the strain on hear
ing of the verdict of guilty. He is a
prominent merchant at Cincinnati and he
spent his time and fortune for over three
years in the prosecution of thoseaccused
of being in a conspiracy to kill his brother.
Powers has been convicted twice before,
this being the third trial irf which the jury
brought In a verdict of guilty against
him. On his previous triads he escaped
with a sentence of life Imprisonment. All
three of the trials were held at George
town, and in each of them he had the as
sistance of the most able lawyers who
could be procured. Subscription lists were
circulated In his interest by friends and a
sum of money was secured to defray the
cost of his repeated trials and the inves
tigating of the proceedings which pre
ceded the killing of Governor Goebel. The
last trial was distinguished by the fact
that Powers addressed the Jury In his own
behalf and In a long review of the case
showed himself to be a very competent
attorney, while his eloquence In pleading
for his life astounded those who had
watched him carefully In the past trials
of the case. Powers has already been
three years In prison on the sentence of
the previous court.

While Admiral Barker has referred to
certain decisions rendered by the navy
umpires and observers, he declines to
make public the substance of the decis

euvers, it is stated, will not reach the
public for many months, if they ever do.
The detailed reports of the eight umpires
and twenty-two observers will be for

compiled. If the definite results become
known it will be only through the Wash
ington officials. A board of arbitrators
was appointed, two for each service, and
the fifth by agreement between the army
and navy commanders. Naval observers
for the forts and military observers for
the ships also watched the operations.
A final opinion is expected from each
commanding officer ashore as to thÂ© suf

Country Orders Solicited.Xot only would the managing owner of
the Reliance object to 'such races oh ac
count of the time he has given . to the
yacht already, but It is not likely that the
suggested experiment would find favor in
the eyes of his skfpper and, crew. They
might not show to the greatest advantage
on the challenger and hence they will not
care to rtsk the excellent, reputation they
have established. ..*.-
The Reliance has become a successful
racer because her managing owner. Cap
tain Barr and the latter's associates; have
studied her. Racing yachts are very pe
culiar, ninety-footers especially^" They
have ; strange ' , whims and 'fancies. J 'At
times they, are very satisfactory' and
Again' the New York Yacht Club would
have no hand in such a match. If the
club's champion is superior to the-chal
lenger that Is a happy result. With the
cup safe the club â will stop.- .
Sir Thomaa Lipton, it was said to-day,
had received a cable dispatch offering to
guarantee the expense if he would ar
range for a eorlcs of five races between
Reliance and Shamrock III with their
crews exchanged. i ,t ':
It is not probable that Sir Thomas will
make a suggestion Q f this kind to the
managins owner of thc Reliance, as he
and all his yachting advisers fear there
are Insurmountable obstacles, in the way
of bringing about such a series of con
tests. The Reliance was built for a cer
tain object, and when that has been at
tained her work for the present season at
least will be done.. Her managing owner
has been a year or more wrapped up, so
to speak, in the boat, and he will not race
her after she has finished her taskâsuc
cessful defense of the cup. No other
business has been paid attention to by
Iselln in this time, and it is thought to be
a little too much to ask him to go through
another series of races. 1
NEW YORK, Aug. 2D.â Wind, cea and
fog conspired to prevent a yacht race to
day. Lipton is growing very tired of the
repeated flukes and It has been decided
to make a daily trial until the third race
is sailed. It is taken for granted there
will be only one more.

Into the offlco of a Philadelphia doctor
came a tired man one morning this week
who wished treatment. The physician put
on his eyeglasses, looked at the man's
tongue, felt his pulse, sounded his chest
and said: "Same old story, my friend.
Man cannot live without fresh air; no use
trying. I could make myself a corpse, as
you are doing by degrees, if I sat down
in my office and didn't stir.
"You must have fresh air; you must
take long walks, and brace up by staying
out of doors. Now, I could make a drug
store out of you and you would think I
was a smart man, but my advice to you
is to walk, walk, walk."
"But, doctor," interrupted the man.

Alonzo H. Palmer, aged 68, committed
suicide yesterday afternoon by swallow
ing poison. His body is now at the
Morgue. He visited the St. Louis saloon
at 10 East street early In the- morning
and bought a bottle of sherry. He sub
sequently visited the drug store of W. J.
Bryan at Second and Howard streets, and
told Dr. Pops that he had been drinking
and wanted something to straighten him
out. The doctor prescribed, paregoric,
bromide and simple syrup, and directed
that a tablespoonful should be taken
every three hours. In the afternoon Pal
mer again visited the saloon and ordered
a bowl of soup. He poured the contents
of the bottle of sherry and the bottle of
medicine in the soup and drank it all.
Palmer was found unconscious in the
back room of the saloon by the proprie
tor T. Muller and was carried over to
the Harbor Hospital. He died some hours
later. Deceased was a member of the
G. A. R. Nothing further could be
learned about him. Ill health and old
age are ascribed as reasons for his act.

was rejected, as was also the application
of the Ada Normal University of Ohio,
as the committee did not consider them
of equal rank with the State normal

contempt of court for ; alleged violation
of the injunction restraining .them from

Throughout the world about 3 per cent
of women gain their living directly from
the sea.
The ; board then ; took the matter under
advisement. It will : not make known its
decision for several days. / ,
Reverting to the re^Jrt of the expert
to the State Board of Equalization, Dodge
said he had taken the sales in a certain
district in the city where properties are
constantly on the Increase and had
sought to make it appear that all prop
erty values should have been assessed on
the basis of these sales. Not a sale had
been reported from the Richmond, Sun
nyside, Potrero or South San Francisco
districts. Had there been it would have
been shown that properties in the sec
tions named are assessed for all they can
stand, Dodge declared.
In concluding his argument Dodge re
minded the members of the board that
when" Suit Francisco's assessment was
raised $50,000,000 several years ago no ap
peal for a reduction was made. The city
and county had been paying on this In
crease all these years, and has further
increased its valuation $75,000,000. He said
it would not be fair to raise San Fran
cisco's assessment above the amount re
turned on the tax rolls.
Mayor E. E. Schmitz was asked if he
had anything to say and he replied that
Assessor Dodge had covered the ground
very fully, and beyond asking that no in
crease be made he had nothing to say.

Dodge stated that within the past five
years ho had raised the assessment on
real property in San Francisco $40,000,000.
Market-street property had been raised
considerably within the past three years,
the BIythe block having been Increased
$352,000, the Phelan block $256,000 and the

PARIS, Aug. 25.â Paris, Which lately
paid homage to a child dramatist of 14
years, who was admitted to the Society
of the Men of Letters of France, now
boasts of a child artist. His name is
Pierre Grenard. He Is the son of a bank
er and is only 10 years old. He has re
markable talent, but paints altogether
from memory. A model or a picture to
copy from perplexes him. His father once
bought him a box of colors to amuse him.
In a little while the child presented him
with a water color that startled ths
father. Some oil colors were then given
him. and he is now launched in art at the
age of 10 and already is much more suc
cessful than many painters who have
passed through the schools.

The Political Code provides that the
State Board of Equalization may raise the
valuation by such percentum as is suf

valuation its action will not affect the
assessments on cash, solvent credits or
mortgages. These represent a stable val

The State board has no power to raise
the rate of $1,076 imposed by the Board
of Supervisors, but could raise the rate
for State purposes.
In the year 1S91-1892. when the assess
ment roll was raised,â the valuation of

The Building Trades Council replied in
like language. A large amount of build

will cause loss and delay.
The resolutions of the alliance read:
"We do not court, nor do we fear, a
strike."
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 29.â Unless an
agreement can be reached between the
Building Trades Council and the employ
ers' association known as the Citizens'
Alliance work on nearly every building in
Santa Barbara will be suspended Tuesday
morning. Yesterday the carpenters em
ployed on two buildings, the plumbing
work on which was being done by a local
hardware firm recently declared "unfair,"
went on strike. To-day the Citizens' Al
liance Executive committee held a meet
ing and adopted resolutions which com
mit the alliance to a policy of resistance
of all demands of the unions.
This morning many plumbers went on
strike. This afternoon other firms connect
ed with the Master Plumbers' Associa
tion and affiliated with the alliance posted
notices stating that all plumbers in their
employ will be laid oft indefinitely. As all
the unions connected with the building
trades are known to be ready to stand in
with the plumbers, a general tie-up is be
lieved certajn. To-night it is reported
that the Central Labor body may enter
the contest by recommending" that mem
bers of every Union in the city cease work
if necessary in order to make a show of
union strength.
It has been conceded by members of
the alliance and local labor leaders that
the plumbers' fight will be made on the
basis of a test of relative strength of
employers and the unions, the Citizens*

University of Heidelberg.
BERLIN, Aug. 29.-The University of
Heidelberg has been celebrating for sev
eral days the century of Its reopening.
The rectors of many other^Qerman, Aus
trian and Swiss universities have been
present. Professor Hugo Munsterburg
represents Harvard University. The
Grand Duke and Crown Prince of Baden
and Prince Max are attending, while the
many strangers include a large number
of Americans. On Thursday the Grand
Duke of Baden delivered an address,
pointing out that the professors of a
century ago awakened the patriotic senti
ments of the students, and their action
resulted In the creation of a national
spirit and the movement for. a united Ger
many. Professor Maroks yesterday de
livered the principal historical oration on
"The University in the Nineteenth Cen
tury/*
Professor Pickering of Harvard Univer
sity has been given the honorary degree
of doctor of science and mathematics in
connection with the celebration.
Berliner announced to-day that on Au
gust 19 his model lifted Itself from the
ground and in a perfectly steady flight
reached a height of eight feet. For a dis
tance of fifty feet it maintained Itself
at a uniform height of three and a half
feet from the ground. No 'catapult was
required to start the machine. The im
petus which a man could ' give it with
one hand was all that was necessary to
project it into space.
In Berliner's opinion a flying machine
should be of such structure Â¦ that when
moving forward horizontally it will pro
duce a current of compressed air, with a
tail surface for lifting the machine, and
with a light motor moving the entire ma
chine rapidly forward. Along these lines
he has built a model which even .in its
crude state lifts in flying a weight equal
to one pound for every square foot of
horizontal area and moves at a speed
estimated at little less than twenty miles
an hour. This model is of aluminum and

So far all of Berliner's experiments have
been with small models, in which, a
stream of compressed air or gas is used
for driving the aeroplane forward. . The
principles he has. utilized have been for
mulated through a study of the flight
of birds. â¢ â¢
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â While Pro-,
fessor Langley. and his army "of assist
ants aro laboring to make the "Buzzard"
fly cm the lower Potomac, another Wash
ington Inventor has constructed and put
to test a model of a flying machine which,
he says, actually flies.
Eroile Berliner, who distinguished him
self years ago as the inventor of the
telephone transmitter and the grapho
phone, is the man. Berliner's machine
is much -after the plan devised by Pro
fesBor Langley. It is not one of the San
tos-Dumont type, with a balloon attach
ment to hold it in suspension, but. one
which depends entirely upon a bird-like
motion of machinery to hold It in : the
air. Tho aeroplane is utilized by Ber
liner, who experimented with this kite
like apparatus so long as thinty years
ago.
BpÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call.
Langley'e Eival Also Uses the Aero
plane Type, With the Same
Birdlike Motion of

Famous Washington Inventor
Is Confident of Final
Results.
The ordinary methods of printing pho
tographs are more or less expensive, the
main reason being l>ecause they are based
on the supposition* that light must pass
through the negative before the required
chemical changes can take place in the
sensitlzefl paper.
Professor Ostwald produces the same
result by means of so-called catalytic re
action. This is apparently due to the
presence of substances known as cata
lysers, but these substances merely In
crease the speed with which reaction
takes place. For example, hydrogen and
oxygen can exist together and apparently
do not react on each other at all under
ordinary conditions, but as soon as cer
tain substances, for instance, fjne plat
inum or finely divided silver, comes In
contact with the mixture chemical union
will take place, which may go on so fast
that the -whole mass will explode. In this
case platinum or silver has acted as cat
alyser. Simply by Its presence it . pro
motes chemical reaction. Professor Ost
wald makes use of this principle by treat
ing an ordinary silver negative with a
solution of hydrogen peroxide.
NEW TOltK, Aug. 29.â Scientists are
much interested in two important discov
eries made by Professor" "Wilhelm Ostwald,
the German chemist. One of these relates
to photography and Its crowning merit
He3 in the fact that by means of the new
process Professor Oatwald is able to
print pictures from negatives without any
lisht, and the other relates to a new
method of producing: nitric acid from am
monla. Professor Ostwald is now in this
country, having recently delivered the ad
dress at the dedication of a new physio
logical laboratory at the University of
California. ;.

PEKING. Aug. 29.â The collapse of the
Chinese imperial university, which has
I* en anticipated in previous dispatches
to The. Call and has long been expected,
has apparently been precipitated by the
policy of the Dowager Empress to kill
the reform movement. This was exem
plified on the second opening of the in
stitution a week ago. when only fifty
pupils appeared. The university has now
been closed on account of the demoraliza
tion of the students, who are leaving for
their homes, and also because Viceroy
Chang Chlh Tung, who was recently ap
pointed to reconstruct the Institution, has

BERLIN. Aug. 29.â Herr Bebel, the So
cialist leader, called the "uncrowned
king"' by the Social-Democrats, was hiss
ed c.t the Socialist-Democratic convention
held in Berlin tbis "neck during a contro
versy- over the Reichstag vice presidency
question. This Indicates the Intensity of
the factional struggle which is going on
In the pany during the period of Its
jrca-test triumph and which will be fougnt
out In the party's national convention at
Dresden in September. It Is a renewal
cf the Eebcl-Bernstein dispute of 19CL
Herrcn Bebcl end Singer and the old
time party chiefs which follow doctrinaire
alms are rigid in their determination not
to depart from the ideas on which the
party has grown powerful, while Herr
Dtrnsicln, who Is an oportunist and mod
prate, favors a division of the Social pro
gramme, especially so that the party,
rcccs^iring the existing conditions, may
combine with and utili2e the political
elements so as to secure a partial real
ization cf Its aims. j . :.Â¦Â¦"
Herr Bernstein has announced that it
tvould be a good party stroke to demand
the office of first vice- president of the
Reichstag, instead of aceptlng a lower
lice presidency, the Socilaists being the
next most numerous body to the Center
party.
Herren Bebel and Singer, however, said
no. since the vice presidency of the
Reichstag would Involve a compromise
with the monarchy and It would be nec
tssary for a Socalist holding office to vote
:n thÂ« sovereign and congratulate him on
the new year and other occasions â "to
rrawl on his stomach before the repre
sentative cf unjust institutions." They
added that the vice presidency would also
Involve compromises with other parties-,
rr.tail responsibilities outside the Social
ist sphere and limit the weapons and re
sources cf the opposition.
Hcrr Bernstein is Joined in his stand
by the aristocrat Von Voltmar and the
B.ble writer Davif, who affirm it is time
the party grasped seme of the agencies
Df government and prepared for the day
'.t will take over the whole cf them, add
ing that responsibilities should be fought
tor. not evaded. They declare that a So
ria'ist in the presence of the sovereign
cet.d or.'.y act as a gentleman without
modifying his opinions.
Behind the vice presidency question are
;Â»o tendencies, to be either a great lib
eral pany, postponing Insistence on its
iheorttical views of government until
renditions ripen, or standing steadfastly
by Socialist principle* without yielding
a little to conventional practices and co'm-
Dremises. Herren Bebel, Bernstein, Sins
sr and Von Voltmar afSrm that they wiil
sirive to preserve party unity and say
that the glee cf the Ministerial Conserv-
Rtives and members of the Center party
ever the divisions of the Socialists are un
timely ar.d exaggerated.

PEKING, Aug. 29.â The Chinese reform
er Shen Chien. like the Filipino patriot
Rizal, cent his farewell message to the
world in the form of verses written in
prison on the eve of his execution. The
spirit of the two valedictories is much
the same. Chinese poetry is difficult to
translate accurately, but the following
is a clear rendition of the young journal
ist's verses into English:

Shen'Chien had been particularly bold
in denouncing the apathy of the Govern
ment toward the Russian absorption of
Manchuria. A short time before hia ar
rest he published two clauses of what pur
ported to be a secret treaty by which
China conceded Newchwang to the control
of Russia: ' Being. barred from communi*

ROME, Aug. a.â The negotiations re
earrdlng the Vatican's 'participation In the
St. Louis exposition, interrupted by the
illness and death of Pope Leo XIII, have
been resumed. Although the personal
opinion of Pope Pius on the subject is

King Edward himself is said to have

but Pope loco's health being at that time
precarious the Vatican authorities feared
that if he died while the Jubilee gifts

situation. Now the questions arise wheth

whether something else would not be bet

The first of the new electric trains from
Sausalito to Mill Valley was run In the
remarkably short fime of nine minutes.
The advent of this road Into Mill Valley
marks the most important step ln the
growth of this suburb, meaning as it does
a great shortening in the. time consumed
in travel by those who cross the bay dally
to and from San Francisco. The road is
the only one of its kind on the qpast, be
ing the first three rail system to be In
stalled. The Mill Valley train hereafter
will consist of five very handsome cars,
which will include three coaches ln the
center, of the train 'and a combination
smoking and . baggage car at either end,
capable of running fifty miles an hour,
solid as . a line of Pullman sleepers and
controlled much easier than the steam
roads. The : new road already has had a

Electro Chemistry in \\ J g~\ \fk F_J IV' r
Special Diseases of ? ? VJ' 1 V 1 1 1 i
In the first place Electro-Chemistry Is keeping many women off the operating table. It is cur-,
ing many special diseases of women which very often are turned over to the surgeon for treatment.
Again it curis painlessly and relieves the sufferer from the necessity of dosing with strong and in-
jurious drugs and medicines. Many a woman's health is ruined by drugging and in many instances
when she is too weak for further medical treatment, as a last resort surgery is resorted to, and
surgical treatment fails because the sufferer is too weak and debilitated ,to stand the shock. To all
suffering women we extend a cordial invitation to come to us for a free Electro'-Chemic X-Ray ex-
amination. This examination will show just what the trouble is, and will tell positively whether or
not surgical treatment is necessary.

Religion is concerned with the spirit behind
matter. Science is concerned with the nature
and function of things, religion __wlth their
rights and alms.
Science concerns itself with the body; religion
goes a step farther and concerns itself also
with the soul. .
Thus the aim of science is to analyze, the
aim of religion to moralize. Religion begins
where science leaves off, revealing tho . Inner
spiritual and moral meaning of nature and life.
Religion recognizes the great services which
science haa rendered and la rendering to hu
manity, and no longer binders Its progress. It
seeks to concentrate Its main efforts upon tha
amelioration of suffering humanity and upon
the uplifting: of the human spirit. Morality
and charity are its chief concern. It holds up
the highest Ideals of life and seeks to interpret
the- true meaning and goal of existence. The
religious man of to-day la not he who gives
his assent ta certain doctrines and beliefs, vol
untarily and Involuntarily, or he who observes
certain customs and. ceremonies, but he who
feels In his own heart and In his conscience
that there must bÂ« a higher power of Justice,
goodnetg and purity that rules nature and man
and that this high power, is the sublime ideal
after which we must ever endeavor to shape
and mold our lives. This Is the religion of
humanity. This Is the religion which appeals
to high and low, to rich and poor, and to the
cultivated and uncultivated. This is the re
ligion which science respects and honors, for
it cannot take its place. Science deals with
matters of fact only.

James Is a young man of talent. He
was connected with Weber & Field's
playhouse In New York for four years.
Â¦He Is extremely popular and is known
throughout the country as a painstaking
leader.
Harry James, the well known leader of
Fischer's orchestra, was Jhe guest of
honor at a supper party tendered him
after last night's performance by his In
timate friends. The affair was held In
VThe Attic," which is a nook in Bohemia,
located on the top floor. of one of the old
buildings on Montgomery and Commercial
streets. Festivities began at midnight
and did not conclude untll o the sun rose
over Telegraphi -Hill.
Mr. James was presented with a hand
some Â¦ silver, loving .cup, on y.'hich were
inscribed the names of his friends. " The
cup- was filled many times during the
night and the popular musician was toast
ed by t the guests. James concludes his
engagement as leader of Fischer's to
night. Ever, since that playhouse began
producing Weber & Field's burlesques he
has had charge of the productions. He
has been indefatigable in his work and
the excellence of the performances has
been due. largely to his energy.
Ho ha3 drilled choruses, written Bongs
and drilled his orchestra until they have
reached perfection. He has never rested
from his labors and now intends to take
a vacation. He has severed his connec
tion with the playhouse and within a
month will begin , to gather a company
of clever people to Journey with him to
the "Antipodes, where he will produco
Weber & Field's pieces. He has tho
rights f or. Australia, South Africa and
Great Britain. He hopes Â¦ to return in
a year and open up a new playhouse in
this .cltyr- It is being erected for him.

â¢and the new 4's registered declined a quar
ter per cent,' as cprnpared" with the clos
Â»r.g call of la at week.
The usual talk Is her.rd in some quar
ters that the Western banking Institu
tions are so well fortified that tlu> needs
for currency to move tht crops Â«nav be
met out of their own reserves without
calling upon Eastern banks. It is pointed
out that some Western banks, even* in the
heart of the wheat belt are now lending
money at this center and nrc freer buy
ers of mercantile "paper heÂ£c than the
New York banks themselves. But expe
rience shows that whether the resources
of thÂ« Western banks are loaned here
directly or by the local banks which have
them on deposit the result of the fall de
mand for cash is the same.
The lateness of tiA* corn and cotton,
crops is expected to cause possible delay
in the Interior demand, but Its proportions
are generally expected to equal those of
former years. In other respects condi
tions are materially aftered from those
of last year. Then credits \r?,re inflated
to sustain prices of securities at an un
stable height. Not only domestic re
sources but enough foreign borrowings
were employed for the purpose and for
eign creditors began to call home their
loans In the very crisis of the fall de
mand for money. The stock market has
pone through a drastic liquidation and
the foreign borrowings of our capitalists
have been reduced to an enormous ex
tent. There Is no fear of an inward 'move
ment flow of gold as soon as the out
ward flow of crops begins to make Â»x
char.pre. During the past wegk exchange
bills have made their appearance In the
market In anticipation of the forthcom
ing supply from the crop movement; and
foreign banks have also been lenders of
money on time to an Important extent
in this market The firm tone of the
time moner market and the hij^h rates
for prime mercantile paper are 'Sufficient
evidence that money Is not;In abundant
supply and that care and~conservatlsm
is exercised In lending it. But confidence
is expressed among the bankers that le
gitimate requirements for trade and! com
merce may be met without trouble. Mean
while capital holds aloor from commit
ment to fixed forms, as indicated by the
failure of the bond subscription plan of
the Consolidated Lake Superior Company.
The market has ignored all develop
ments of whatever character. Favorable
railroad earnings, including Erie's .strong
annual report, large current railroad traf
fic, favorable crop reports, a rise in silver
and copper and some foreign demand for
stocks on thÂ« one hand and the threat
ened embroilment over the supposed mur
der of the United States Vice Consul In
Turkey have been equally without, effect.
Bonds have shared in the dullness of
*ne stock market. United States old 4's
and the ?s advanced a Quarter Der. cent
* The stock market has come to a stand
still this week and toward .the latter, part
of the week' the. daily aggregate of deal
irgs have fallen .to a lower figure than
on any full 'day's trading since the sum
mer'of 1300. "This is. in some part due to
the Interest among members of the Ex
change being diverted' to the yacht races
and :to the_ large 'number of" belated va
cations amopg .the menibers. The usual
sfinimer outings â¢ .have ' be^en prevented
bihterto by the -troubled s.tate of. -the
stock market, and more than' once "there
has been a hasty recall to thie stfeat to
face a crisis'. With the .completion of
the long proeess of -liquidation and' the
closing up cf the " resulting speculative
accounts on the short side the market
has come to a state of' stable equilibri
um and is left to the devices of a'sgt
cf sm&U traders on the floor. ' "Â¦: -
Daily fluctuations which reach as" much
9 a point in. only a few stocks repre
sent the efforts of this element to move
prices and the profits- they' reap or losses.
they suffer are at each other's expense.
The fcffering tone Of prices fail3. to In
duce any fresh liquidation and- is met by
sufficient supporting orders to arrest the
decline and Intimidate the bears. Buying
of a few lots o? shocks resulted In a rise
of prices, but there is no .outside demand'
to take them off ta& hands of the specu
lators, and nrlces g,Hp* back . when they
attempt to, realize profits. The news of
the market consists of gossip and surmise
as to what large amount of' traders aVÂ«'

so that the banks had to report a de

of upward of $2,OjO,<XÂ» was expected and
the loan^sccount was again expanded to
the extenT"of upward of $5,000,000. This
loan Increase in reality was a measure
of the inactivity of the money market,
as It is supposed to be due to the putting
out at unresiuneratlve call loan rates. by
the banks of funds deposited by the trust

\ 338-342 Post St. fREPORTS of interviews with Sir Thomas Lipton are to the effect that he concedes the supe
iiority of the Reliance over Shamrock III and is eager to sail the last race of the match
and have it over. Furthermore he is said to have declared a conviction that no yacht
builder in Great Britain can rival the American builders who have constructed yachts to
defend the cup, and he virtually announces that he will not issue another challenge. (The decision
to withdraw is not in any sense a proof that he is a "quitter," in sporting phrase, but that he has
sense enough to recognize that he is beaten and to make up his mind not to waste further time, en-
The most careful students of the subject are at a loss to understand the unbroken continuity
of victor'es that have attpnded our yachts in the contests for the America's cnp. At one time it was
believed that the American type of yacht was superior to the British, but there is no longer any
difference in the type. It was then suggested that British yachts being constructed for the compara
tively stormy seas around the British islands were at a disadvantage when competing with American
yachts in the light breezes and over :he qi'iet seas off 'Sandy Hook. Such a 'disadvantage, if it ev:r
existed, does so no longer, for of late years the British challengers have carefully iludied the Amerl
can waters, and are as familiar with the course, the channels, currents and the prevailing winds
during the yachting season as are our own builders. Their challenging yachts therefore have been
constructed to meet the requirements of the Sandy Hook course, and we have had no advantage over
them in that respect.
Sir Thomas Lipton is quoted as saying "the brains of boat building" are on this side of the
water, and it is probable we shall have to accept that theory for the lack of a better, but it is by no
means satisfactory. Credit is now given to the Herreshoffs, but; we were winning yachting races
right along before the Herreshoffs began to construct them. Nor is it strictly true that boat-building
brains are all on this side of the water. The British shipbuilders are among the best in the world, and
they are every year launching t warships, ocean liners, steamships and sailing vessels of all kinds for
merchant service that average fully as well as those our own yards turn out.
Thus, after all, the question reverts whether there may not be more in the man than there is
in the yacht. There seems every evidence that the American yachting crews handle their boats
much more quickly and effectively than the British yachts are handled. Moreover the superiority of
the American over any European in all matters requiring an 'exercise of skill and dexterity has been
proven in nearly all lines of competition, and it is therefore not unreasonable to ask that a match be
arranged to test the crews instead of the yachts. - Â¦ . ,
The retirement of Sir Thomas Lipton from the contest does not mean that the cup will re
main in our hands unchallenged. It is announced that the Canadians purpose to enter the lists, and
have already raised $100,000 to start the construction of a Canadian challenger. The new venture is
rendered the more interesting by the announcement that if^the scheme be carried out the Canadians
will man their yacht with a crew of gentlemen yachtsmen. That would put a new issue in the con
test, a'nd would go far toward reviving the old-time interest that has been well nigh exhausted by
the one-sidedness of the recent matches. '
That ancient and .interesting : 'od<lÂ«iyj the family- sk iletoiv seems to 'be having its day now in
the courts of California. Several will contests, now in prospect or. promised; are casting the shadows
of salacious developments. If this sort of thing continues a 'family skeleton as well as a family tree
will be necessary as a credential to good breeding. â¢ ' ;

"As a result, messages which' formerly
took from five to six hours from Home to
New York are now transmitted In much
less than an hour. A number of the bul

transmitted from the Vatican, which is
over two miles from the central telegraph
office in Rome, to New York In twelve,
fourteen and sixteen minutes.
"This Involved transmission by tele

Press office adjoining the central tele

ot the French Cable Company to the main
office of the Associated Press in the
Western Union building, 195 Broadway.
"One bulletin thus transmitted occupied
precisely nine minutes from the Vatican.
When the condition of the Holy Father
became critical, competent men were or

Vienna to assist the local Italian bureau.

The Illness and death of Pope Leo^CIII
created an Immense amount of cable and
telegraphic traffic. Melville P. Stone, gen
eral manager of the Associated Press,
says on the subject: "The telegraphic
service from Rome was the result of ar
rangements effected last year. Upon the
suggestion of Ambassador Cambon, M.
Delcasse, the French Minister of Foreign
Affairs, took a lively interest in' the work
of expediting the Associated Prens ser
vice. He not only enlisted his colleague,
the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs cf
France, In the work, but instructed M.
Barrere, the French Embassador to Italy,
to use his good offices with the Italian
Government. SIgnor GallmbertI, the Ital
ian Minister of CommunicaUons, joined
heartilyin the effort. 4
After receiving Governor Taft's reply
to his message President Roosevelt gave
to the operator a message for Clarence
H. Mackay, then at his side. This mes
sage was to girdle the world, using the
new cable for the first and longest ocean
stretches. The operator sent it off west
ward at 11:23 p. m., and in twelve min
utes took it again from his sounder, com
ing from the Azores, via Canso and New
York.
THE message se=t on July 4 by
President Roosevelt at Oyster
Bay, I* I., to Governor Tall at
Manila Inaugurated an enterprise
Â¦which sSgnais another step on the part of
the United States Into the arena. of the
world's affairs. The Pacific cable, an all-
American line, some &>Qp miles long, per
mits talking to our Philippine dependen
cies without giving foreigners knowledge
of what we are saying. Then It cuts the
cost of our talks enormously and at the
same time puts the money therefor Into
the pockets of our own people.
President Roosevelt's Initial message
was sent at 10:40 p. m. overland to San
Francisco and thence by the new cable,
\ia Honolulu, Midway and Guam, to Ma
nila. At 11:19 p.m. Governor Taft's reply

They point out that in Its present stats

Is thought rather unfair Jthat while the
American author can secure copyright ia
England by the- mere simultaneous pub
lication from stereos an English author
has to get his book both set up and print

there. The effect of the law is that in
many cases no copyright is secured In
America. One angry authorâ probably a
sufferer who failed to secure his copy

what precipitated the publication
of the edition de luxe of his work
which Mr. Thacker had in ~rog
rcss .
The artist selected a large number oi'
sketches out o( those that will appear in
'the new volume as being his favorites,
and the must popular with the general
public, such as represented â¢ his best ef
forts. A short biographical sketch by one
who knew him intimately will preface
the publication.
Some of the chief publishers have now
begun to publish autumn lists. So far
the absence of new books Is rather re
markable, while the number of reprints
is extraordinary. Messrs. Methuen, one of
the most powerful and enterprising of
'comparatively new houses, announce
more than 200 reprints, including Shape
speare and ' a complete set of Dumas.
These reissues are in various styles,
ranging from a magnificent photograph
ical reproduction of each of the four fo
lios of Shakespeare from the perfect
copies down to the cheapest but daintiest
booklets. As it is perfectly certain that
these reprints â¢would not be published in
"This dispatch, reduced to the smallest
possible proportions, consisted of two
words: 'Temps, Paris.' The charges were
altogether 8 francs 30 centimes (Jl 66) a
word. The system is so perfect that, not
withstanding the extreme brevity of the
dispatch, there was no delay otherwise
than that due to ordinary stoppage of
the line; there were necessary only a few
verbal explanations at the office In the
Rue de Grenelle, where the unaccustomed
form of the document excited the surprise
of the employe?.
"We must not confound the speed of
transmission of electricity with that of
telegraphic messages. The former Is com
parable to that of light, but it is .not in
dependent of the nature of the conduc
tors over which the current passes. Ac
cording to Tizeau's experiments; made In
1850, it is 180,000 kilometers (111.600 miles)
a second in copper wire and falls to 100,000
(62,000) in Iron. â¢ â¢ â¢ In transoceanic
cables It is much less and falls to a few
thousand kilometers, more or less, accord
ing to the length and construction of the
cables. The transmission In this case Is
complicated by phenomena of electrostatic
tension like those that occur In a Leyden
jar. The theory of these effects is very
complicated, but at the same time it has
been well worked out. It is one of the
most delicate and. most remarkable divi
sions of electrical science. The compari
son of the results obtained on the Pacific
cables with those of the Atlantic or the
Indian Ocean may carry It. to a still
higher degree of perfection."
The sending of the first telegraphic
message around the world took about ten
minutes. But the time of this diepatch.
of course, does not represent the regular
working speed of the various cables tra
versed by it. Says "W. de Fonvielle. in
Cosmos (Paris, July 11):
"All along this Immense line instruc
tions had been given; ordinary messages
had been stopped and everywhere the most
skillful operators were at their posts with
the most perfect apparatus. The speed of
transmission was thus very great, but it
represents neither the real velocity of
electricity nor the speed of commercial
telegraphy.
"Consequently the journal Le Temps
was desirous of making a much simpler
and much more instructive trial. With
out previous notice it sent from its of
fice In Paris a circular dispatch. This re
turned about six hours after its de
parture, which took place on July 3 at
11:35 a. m. Â¦Â¦: Â¦'? . >- ".: -^ ,-<
Mr. Stone said he had cabled his ap

quently took less time to transmit a bul
letin from the Vatican than to send one
by wireless telegraphy from Sir Thomas
LJpton's Erin off Sandy Hook. Finally,
the bulletin announcing- the Pope's death
was received In New York In time to
transmit It to London and deliver it to
the papers of the British capital In ad

V It is well tiiat all these considerations be frequSntfy *put before the public' The pamphlet just
issued notes the objections? to existing and proposedÂ® forest reservations tp be: Â«That they prevent

grazing of cattle and'-sheep'i.they dfnrinishHhe timber supply. â¢ Â© Â©
Answered in tufn,-it is shown that railroads built to f|ke (flit lumber and strip the moun
tains, instead of developing, destroy the resources of'the country, leaving IJarrenness and desolation.!
As concerns grazing, the records show that last year by permit 1,15 1,273 weejj'^snd 459,137 .cattle
and horses grazed in. the forest reservation?. The f .Governmenf will not permit overstocking of the
mountain range, which causes destruction . of the young timber. Within that limitation grazing is
permitted, and not only the timber but the pasturage is preserved thereby. The reservations do not
shut off the supply of timber for economic use. They stop the destructive lumbers^, "which, being
followed by fire, destroys all young growth: but a system is in tlie course of geyelopment by Whicji
all ripe timber will be harvested wjthout destrpying^the oncoming crop, ' thus giving permanency to
the forest.
Finally the issue between the lumbermen and the foresters is summed ujÂ£in this: "The oov
ernment has been running a get-i'ich-quick department for a considerable number of its citizens,
but the day for that sort of work is about over. The enormous fortunes that have beeii piled up by
taking and stripping the forest lands have been got at the expense of the people by destroying one of
the great natural resources of the land. We want no more of it on this coast. There is not lumber
enough in all the Sierras to pay for the destruction of the fertility of â¢ the valley land. The people
should co-operate with the Government, instead of hindering its work, in preserving -the watersheds
that lie above that rich territory." ;

f Â¦ HE,. Water and Forest Association has issued a pamphlet to set forth the need of forest pres-
I ervation in this^ State, and in vindication of the policy; of the Federal Government in tempo
i rarily withdrawing the forests on the public domain while examination is made into the
. . . ' necessity for their- preservation. In answering the objections to forest reservations, and espe
cially those made to the proposed reserve in Northern California, the pamphlet submits some statis
tics, statements of fact and disclosures of a proper forest policy, which should be widely circulated.
They dispel many illusions, which were responsible for the original opposition to scientific fprestry,
and which still supplyj what antagonism remains.
It was in the beginning 'assumed tfiat forestry, meant the complete sequestration of timber and
its withdrawal from economic use. As wood and lumber figure so largely in the economic?, of the

as many females as males. It Is pointed
out in considering the excess of females
over males, account muet be taken of the
large number of female domestic servants

aggregating about $17,000. The Lacy Man

machinery, pipe, etc., eufured tr the ex
tent of about J1Q.O0O. partially insured.
The Pioneer Paper Company's plant,
near the Lacy buildings, was damaged
for an equal amount. A fire in 'he heart
of Chinatown destroyed n\*e or six build-
Ings, occupied as shops, lodgings, clubs,
etc. causing a loss of 55000, with little
if any insurance. Â¦ Two cottages -on Alamo
street were al/o burned. The loss on
these is about 52500.
In an article published In the Magazine
Globus, Professor Singer of the Univer
sity of Prague asserts that the expedition
has ueen a failure and gives the public
no further knowledge than it has before
regarding Antarctic regions.
Professor Singer criticizes the action of
Professor Drygalski in changing the name
of Termination Island, discovered by the
American explorer, Wilkes,' sixty-three
years ago, and says that Von Drygalski' s
statement that the land said to. have been
discovered by Wilkes does not' exist has
not been proved, as the Gauss also passed
through that part of the ocean in uncer
tain weather.

SEATTLE. Aug. 29âDespite heroic ef
forts to deliver to the inhabitants of that
isolated region their annual mail and sup
plies, the revenue cutter Thetia has failed
in her attempt to reach Point Barrow this
season, and the Indian missions and whal
ing station at that point will be compelled
lo spend another year in winter's icy
grasp cut off from their customary sup
plies.
The Ftf>ry of the Thetis* failure to reach
Point Barrow is told by Dr. S. J. Call, a
former surgeon of the revenue cutter,
who arrived here on the Ohio on his way
to his home in California. Said he:
"The Thetis roundfd Point Hope, the
most -westerly point in Alaska, and from
that point onward the trip was one of
barfilng difficulties. At Icy Cape, nearly
looo miles from Nome and about 200 miles
from the Government rescuo mission,
where the mail Is left, she encountered
the solid fee pack, that b!eak, barren
waste of frozen sea which never melts
â¢and which has never yielded to the on
slaughts oi any ship which man has yet
built. The Thetis hugged the shore in the
hope that shifting winds might open the
way, but In thla she was disappointed and
was ultimately compelled to turn back.
The mail wan left to be taken to its des
tination by Eskimo canoes or venture
some whalers, but it will be months be
fore it Rets there, if it ever does. No cut
ter can again attempt tho dangerous
passage before next simmer."

About an hour later Cooper awakened
C. J.' Flyr.n of 533 California street, who
was asleep in Union Square, by going
through hia pockets. Flynn tried to hold
Cooper, but the thief succeeded. in break
ing away from him and ran Into 217
Post street, pursued by Policeman Rlehl.
Cooper got on the. roof and .jumped to
the roof of the next house, where he was
captured by Riehl. .During his flight
Cooper, had thrown. away a watch and
purse that he had taken from Flynn's
peckets and they -were recovered by the

locket taken from Pfeiffer were found in
his pockets.
Cooper is about 20 years of age and a
native of Utah.. He was arrested on".Feb

The first chancre occurred yesterday,
fvheii Judge Hebbard, in chambers, enter
ed a decree granting Ferris Hartman a
divorce from his wife, Mary M. Hartman,
on the ground of 'desertion. The second
change Into happy married Ufa will take
place probably to-day, provided Mr. Hart
man' b lawyers advise him that a mar
riage In this State under the clrcum
stanct-i will be legal. â
The bride Is Miss Josie Davies, & member
of the present Tivoli company, who is well
kncwn.to tfteater goers by reason of her
attractive appearance and \ peculiarly
sweet voice. She is-a San Francisco girl
by birth! and has been with the Tivoli
for the la>t three years. It wait there
thut Mr. Hurtman met her and between
tho two there has existed a deep attxoh
rrent for- a long time.
| Tho first matiimpnial venture of the
comedian proved unhappy. He was mar
ried in Chicago In 18S5 to Mary M. Mc-
Garey, and one child, a boy, was born
to them two years later. Shortly after
the birth of the child Mrs. Hartman is
said to have deserted her husband and
h3 hits not seen her for sixteen years.
At the time of the marriage the couple
Â¦wtre perform. ng at the old Auditorium
Theater, wb.d. ih now known as tho
North Clark Street Theater.
It 1b the Intention of Mr. Hartman and
hi* bride to spend their honeymoon trav
eling In tho East and 'In Europe. They
will depart to-morrow for the East, and
in case the legal difficulties for an Imme
diate marriage In this State proved Insur
mountable, the wedding will be postponed
until the couple have crossed the State
line.
With almost tbe same rapidity with
which he changes his costume between
tcta, Ferria Hartman, the Tlvoll com
edian, will glide from the role of
a husband deserted by his * wife for six
teen years. to that of & loving* and! loved
bridegroom. â¢ ".- .;.-.-'.-: : >'V J . '_;â

Yesterday morning Attorney Frank
Drury for Mrs.' Bowers and Attorney
Charles A. Low for Mrs. Sutton petitioned
for writs of habeas corpus for their clients
on the ground that they were not legally

the two women are guiltless. The attor

Cn?ef of Police Wittman, Theodore Kyt

fateful prescription was written had been
torn, as the police believe., A note writ

Bowers from Mrs. Martin Bowers was
also secured yesterday.
The blank book was about eight by five
inches in size and had a glazed brown

of anything. I presume that they may have
done this with the idea that they might g?t
the money and to have revenge on me. It
will air come out riKht tn the end and thÂ»
people who are condemning me now will have
an opportunity to' chacsc their minds.
In spite of the counter theory that Har

In the belief that the guilty ones are now
behind the bars. Patrick O'Leury la still

Harry Bowers did dri-.k some beer In our
house one nisbt and fell on the- floor after
wards. He said at the time that he had had
several of those dizzy spells before. I nenT
thought that they would try to make out that
I attempted to poison him. I had no motive
for killing my husband. The money was mlno
if I wanted to take It at any time.
Harry Bowers and his wife did not ap
pear on the scene, however, until Martin
Bowers had been sick for more than two
months. It Is said that the Bowers
brothers were not on good terma for many
years. The former wife of Harry Bow
ers once threw pepper in the eyes of
Martin Bowers and stabbed him with a
hatpin- Mrs. Sutton has Intimated in her
statements to the authorities that sho
suspects the couple who first accused her
sister of murder. Mr3. Martin Bowers
said at the prison last night:
There was a grreat deal cf 111 feeling at timrs
between Harry and Martin lJowers. 1 do not
think they spoke a dozen words to each other
in the four years preceding the death of my
husband. When Martin was sick h*> asked me
to send for Harry, ami I did so. They were
quite friendly then. Harry and Sadie Bowers
wanted my husband to make a will. I sa'.d,
that If Ma-rtln die-i It would all come to me
anyway, to what was the use. They Insisted.

Uncle has another new one In the person
of Phil Howell. a big husky youth from
Vlnalla. The lad is uald to be a pitcher who
can really pitch. .. He will be given a chance
to go borae this morning on the Oakland dia
mond against tha Cripples. If he makes good
he win become one of Uncle's family. Vlsalta
has produced Hall of Los Angeles ; and Overall
of. Berkeley, r o - Howell will have .that much
to Ills credit, anyhow. _
ZfarfOEs was the only. man on Uncle's team
to fan the wind. He mad? a hit every other
time at the bat. so the cranks will forgive him
for â¢"biting."
That little stubborness on the part of Uncle
Peter Lohman will cost the Oakland manage
ment Just $100. A nice sum to pay for be
ing no Important as not to listen to an umpire
when, he Is merely dotng his duty.
Tommy Leahy playod the initial bag in
Rreat form yeBterday. This la the first time
Tommy has been there this season, but he
handled the difficult throws all right and did
not seem to , be bothered when the base run
ner* tore Into the bag. â¢
Dave Zearfoss ought to make good with
Uncle-.- and prove a great favorite. He is a
heavy hitter, according; to dope, and ils con
sidered a first-clasB thrower. If he lives up to
his, reputation. Uncle may thank .his stars he
acquired the man whom Brooklyn wanted.
The talent reems to be getting slower all the
time. Not a single base was stolen yesterday.
Cooper was the only member of the Oakland
team to make an error. He fell down twice
on easy bunts.

For a long time the venerable Peter
Lohmxa baa beÂ«a due to start something
at RÂ«cr*atloa ball park. During all this
period of waiting he has bÂ«en good to a
certain degree. Why. U best known to
himself. But yesterday afternoon he got
gay for the first UiaÂ« In many moons. In
I consequence Buck Weaver was forced to
call the battle oft In the eighth Inning
and forfeit the game to the homo teamâ
> to 0. The score at that time- was San
r-andsco 5. Oakland 2.
Weaver did the right thing, and at the
same time showed he is possessed of a lit
tle backbone acd Is not afald of any
of the rude tossers when they try to show
him up. The spectators teemed to -p
"ove of Buck's action and went home
satisfied.
It was the latter half of the el&Jth ta
ring-. Shea had led off with i double and
crossed the plate on one of the same
brand from the bat ofMeany. Irwln laid
down a bunt and Coo$r fumbled the ball,
putting two on the bags with no one out.
1 Tommy Leahy held the club, and Cooper
threw ine that Lohman thought should
Ue a strike, though the umpire called It a
ball.
Lohman made some remark to Weaver,
and thÂ«> latter Immediately walked for
ward aud ordered the offensive leader of
the Cripples out of the game. Lohman
refused to go. Instead he sat down and
tried the" game of bluff.
Weaver pulled out his watch ind wait.
ed patiently fot Lhman to obey his or
der. When the allotted five minutes had
elapse and the warlike Peter still re
mained unchanged in his disposition.
Weaver cried, "Game called" and Imme
diately left the grounds, followed by the
fans. %
The home team had the Cripples under
the spell of their batting chain i from the
call of time, and would have piled up
about a dozen more runs had the game
not been forfeited. Every man on the
team seemed to be right re- hitting the
ball. The curves of Lee ana Cooper had
jv* terrors for them.
Lee started to pitch for the Grippes,
but was hit by a batted ball In the second
spasm and retired in favor of Southwlng
er Cooper. Then the natives began to get
busy with their clubs. Meany. Irwin,
Krug and Zearfoss all landed on the solar
plexus of the sphere, and their efforts
netted just three talliesâ a good start to
war" winning the game.
The Cripples began to look a bit dans^r
<vis in their half of the fourth, when they
got Jerry to j. few of Hodson's softest
offerings and began to hit the little man
a few. Two runs crossed over the pan.
After that they secured no more, although
Hoddle was bumped in all for ten hits
during the eight innings of action. It was
swell fielding behind him that kept many
a tally at a distance.
In the fourth Danny Shay led off with
a double to the score board. Meany pent
htm around to third on an out. Irwln was
there just In .lme with the big bingle, and
Danny made the circuit v Â«th the fourth
run. The last one came over In the eighth,
when the fun was broken up, thanks to
Peter and his peevish ways.
Dave Zearfors made h!s bow to the Rec
reation Park fans, and just to get in right
with the multitude he banged the ball for
three solid bingles out of four times up.
Pabst has a sore lep. so Lahy will have
to look out for things at the initial bag
till the tall German is ready to get into
the harness once more. The score:

In spite of the unpleasant weather be
tween 20,000 and 23.000 persons were in
attendance when the Futurity was run.
Hamburg Belle is the third filly to win
the' Futurity. The others were The But
terflies and L'Alouette. Her owner, Mr.
Paget. is credited with winning $30,000 by
her, victory. John J. Ryan, the Western
track owner. Is said to have won $50,000.
Sydney Paget, who is registered as the
lessee of Hamburg Belle's running quali
ties, received $36,300 as the winner's share.
Leonidas won $4250 by taking second place
and $2250 went to Madden for The Mln
uteman's third. To J. B. Haggln t ad
nominator of the winner and the second
horse, goes $2000 and $1250, respectively.
E. C. Cowden. who nominated The Min
uteman, crets $500.
Hamburg Belle was equal favorite with
the Keene entry in the betting, the odds
on each closing at about 4 to 1. with S.
S. Brown's entry about the- same price.
Hamburg Belle was offered for sale with
another of the Haggin two-year-olds for
$5000 duriner the Morris Park meeting.
After she won her first race it was de
cided to keep her. She carried 114 pounds,
five less, than the scale for fillies, because
her dam had never prcvlouoly foaled a
winner.
Betting was strong, but not heavy on
the big race. John A. Drake was cred
ited with large wagers on Hamburg Belle.
Most of the public money went the same
way or to the Keene stable for a place.
At the Â«.-nd Hamhurir Belle was 4 to {,
where she- opened: the Brown entry.
Broomstick and Audience, had been back
ed from fives to fours, and the Keeno j
entry was at fours, where it opened.
Madden's stable had dropped from 7 to
5 to 1, Highball from 30 to 20 and Raglan
from 50 to 30. Summary:

Hamburg Belle was skipping along
easily, and as Leonidas. responding to
Redfern's desperate riding, forced her
faster and faster, the two sped away from
the others. Leonidas drew up on the
fllly, both being in the center of the track
and In the best going a nixteenth from
home, Hamburg Belft on the inside and
still a length in the lead. Fuller saw the
little fellow's heat' bobbing closer, and.
drawing his whip, hit the fllly smartly on
the flank.
She shrank from the blow, evidently dis
concerted, but not in cowardice. The
spring sidewtee carried her into the deep
mud near the rail. When Fuller saw hH
error and set to work In a flash with
hand and heel3 to mend it the response.
was magnificent. Hamburg Belle straight
ened out like a greyhound and shot
through the mud toward the near goal.
In a second she was going faster than
Leonirtas and in a moment more wa3
homÂ» first, winner by a head, and the
greatest turf heroine of 1903.
Sydney Paset earned the 1 hand grasp
of Mr. Whitney, extending congratula
tions when the filly led the field home.
"I am glad to win. but I almost wish
it had been you," said the 'younger turf
man.
Mr. Whitney expressed intense gratifi
cation at the successes of Hamburg's get.
He was especially well pleased at the
showlnc of Leonidas.
"He is the earnest little hcrse I ever
saw," he said. . "I . did not believe he
could carry that weight with such horses.
In fact, I wanted to withdraw him at
lunchtime, and I bet a dollar Mercury
would beat him."
Rain for two days preceded Futurity
day and the early light drizzle turned to
fine, stinging: rain just before the great
race. A stiff wind blew down the Fu
turity course. Dovescotc was withdrawn
early and the chalk soon went through
the name of Beldame, leaving the Belmont
stable no representative in the Futurity
Madden scratched Gettysburg and added
Ancestor. S. P. White added Rain or
Shine. This left eighteen to face the
starter.
It was drizzling so hard when the
horses reached the start us the Futurity
chute that they were almost invisible
from th* grand stand. After twelve min
utes' delay the biff field got away in ex
cellent alignment. Delhi eeemed quick

and all in the center of the track. These,

NEW YORK, Aug. 29.-Hambur*
BÂ«Ile, worthy daughter oi the
famous Hamburg, won the' Fu
turity to-day In footing not to
her liking in a race marred only
by her swerve near the finish. For this
the splendid fllly made ample amends by
the tremendous burst of speed she showed
when straightened out again, carrying her
to the wire in front.
Her performance, the full six furlongs
in 1:13, is the record for the race at that
distance. From 1892 to 1901, inclusive, the
Futurity course was 170 feet short of six
furlongs. Savable made the record of 1:14
last year. ... .
- Throughout she was the speediest and
at the end the gamest, coming on in the
heaviest part of the track near the rail.
Fuller rode with perfect Judgment When
Leonldas challenged a sixteenth from the
finish Fuller struck Hamburg Belle with
his whip and she swerved sidewise six
fÂ«Â£t. reducing her length's lead to noth
ing. The boy then dropped his whip and
sitting down to ride called on the beauti
ful fllly to do her best. Nobly she re
sponded, and sprinting^ away 'shook off
her sturdy half -brother, winning the
greatest two-year-old prize of the world
by a head. No shame rests on little
Leonidas because of â¢ his defeat. Giving
his sister six pounds more than her sex
allowance, he raced from post to finish
like the splendid thoroughbred he is. The
Minuteman. John E. Madden's entry, was
third, foui lengths behind Leonidas. His
Â£^.Â°, ine amon * the first three was lucky.
William C. Whitney saw a daughter and

with the loss of the first place.

Those who have ever felt its keen, cutting pains, or witnessed the intense
suffering of others, know that Rheumatism is torture, and that it is right-
ly called "The King of Pain." , â¢
All do notsuffer alike. Some are suddenly seized with the most excrucia-
ting pains, and it seems every muscle and joint in the body was being torn
asunder. Others feel only occasional slight pains for weeks or months, when
asudden change in the weather or exposure to damp, chilly winds or ni<rht
air brings on a fierce attack, lasting for days perhaps, and leaving the pa-
tient with a weakened constitution or crippled and deformed for all time
An acid, polluted condition of the blood is the cause of every form and
variety of Rheumatism, Muscular/Articular, Acute, Chronic, Inflammatorv
and Sciatic, and the blood must be purged and purified before there is an
end to your aches and pains. External applications, the use of liniments and
plasters, do much toward temporary relief , but such treatment does not reach
the real cause or cleanse the diseased blood ; but S. S. S., the greatest of all
blood purifiers and tonics, does cure Rheumatism by antidoting and neutraliz
ing the poisonous acids and building up the weak and sluggish blood. It is*

PETALUMA, Aug. 29.â The closing day
of the Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breed
ers' Association to-day attracted the larg
est attendance of the meeting. Ideal rac
ing weather and a track that was fast,
but .a trifle too hard, left little to be de
sired.
The feature of the card was the $3000
California stakes for trotters of the 2:24
class, for which a oig field of eleven
scored down for the word. Favorite for
the race was the much touted Dr. Ham
mond said to have worked a mile re
cently-in 2:10%. The beat the rangy chest
nut could do was take third money. The
winner turned up in the despised out
sider George G, which gelding was splen
didly handled by J. Albertson, one of his
owners. When Georce G won the first
heat in 2:14% there was but one $2 ticket
sold on him in the parls mutuals. It net
ted the lucky investor $199 50. Before the
field was called Dr. Hammond brought
J20 in the pools. Daisy B $3, Deputy J4,
and the field J2.
In the opening ' heat both . the Doctor
and Deputy behaved badly, 1 enabling
George G to take the front position early
and win without effort. The heat win
ner left his feet in the heat following
and Deputy led out Daisy B this time
in 2:13%. This feat caused Deputy to be
installed favorite over the field. The
chestnut showed unmistakable signs of
lameness and, though he trotted gamely,
could not land the 'goods. Finishing ninth
ln the second heat, George G took the
third and fourth in 2:12%, Hughes, behind
Dr. Hammond making a fruitless at
tempt to beat him out in each.
Another hot favorite was bowled over
in the green class pace. Colonel C had
a decided call over the field, but the sta
ble connections did not seem to think
the Glenway gelding at his best, and the
field had few takers.
The Colonel annexed the first heat with
out any great effort and then .resigned
his commission. Edwin S Captured the
following three and race.
There was nothing to the 2:07 trot but
Roselle, the gray gelding. The over
whelming favorite, he won ln straight
heats, with What Is It, another gray one,
falling in line for second money.

* A gTeat surprise developed ln the han
dicap singles tennis tournament for
women played yesterday on the public
courts in Golden Gate Park. It rvas the
deflat of Miss Miriam Edwards, the State
champion, at the hands of Miss Hazel
Hotchkiss of Berkeley. Miss Edwards
won easily until she reached the final,
while Miss Hotchkiss had an exceedingly
hard time ln all her matches arid was
rather tired when she met Miss Edwards.
Miss Edwards won the first set by a
small margin, the score being 7-5. Miss
Hotchkiss then changed her method of
attack and took the net position. She
plays well from this' part of the court,
but heretofore her back court game has
been too weak to permit of her getting
up to the net. Miss Hotchkiss forced her
opponent far back in the court and then
dropped the ball short. The ease with
which she won the last two sets shows
how well her plan worked. In these sets
Miss Edwards was contantly on the de
fensive, which is unusual for her. The
score ln Miss Hotchklss' favor was 5-7,
6-2, 6-2. :>'.
In the other half Miss Hotchkiss and
Miss Ethel Ratcliffe, the University of
California champion, both playing from
"15" back of scratch, had an exciting
match. Miss Hotchkiss lost the first set,
but won the next two. Miss Edwards
went through the lower half without los
ing more than two games in any set. The
longest set of the day was played by
Miss Anita Beyfuss and Miss D. Weed.
The former won, 17-15.
The tournament resulted as follows:
Preliminary roundâ Miss H. Naylor (30) beat
Miss Anna Alberger (15). C-4. 6-4.

The drawing for the men's singles and
doubles in the coast championship tour
nament, which will commence to-morrow
at San Rafael, was held last night. Eight
teams entered the doubles, which will be
the opening event. The strongest teams
are Collier and Murdock, Whitney and
stretch and can probably be saved lor breeding
purposes.
Albertson. behind George G. drove the geld
ing with fine Judgment ln the third heat, when
the issue looked to lie between Dr. Hammond
and Deputy. He made a short turn into the
stretch and at the end scored hands down.
Dr. Hammond was unsteady and will have
to improve a whole lot to take the measure
of Sweet Marie at Salem. Or.
Telephone trotted two good heats before the
wires got crossed.
Harry Stover, owner of Kenllworth Park.
got back from Sacramento In time to bet $20
on Rozslle and ' draw down a profit of $7.
Stover expects to give a mixed meeting at
the park next summer.
John Offut's roan mare. Mildred O. only lost
the second heat to Edwin S by a head.
Ira Pierce, surviving member of the firm of
Pierce Bros, of Santa Rosa, breeders of the
new turf queen. Lou Dillon, was a spectator
of the sport. In speaking of her sire. Sidney
Dfllon, Mr. Pierce says as a young horse he
was mixed gaited, but later on. under the care
of John Rogers and when properly weighted,
trotted three heats ln 2:24. 2:23. 2:21U- He
was a fast fellow and before breaking down
repeatedly stepped quarters In 31 V4 seconds.
Charley Neullnger also worked the *on of Sid
ney, a mile ln 2:25. Cupid, owned by A. B.
Spreckels ' and a promising sire, is a full
brother to Sidney Dillon.
The Ukiah crowd? was disappointed as Alone
was not sent a fast mile.

Abstruse Medical Points
The theory of Loeb and Matthews la
that the nervous lmpluse, although It
brings In electricity, Is far from regarding
the transmission of that impulse as Iden
tical with sÂ» simple electrical cur
rent. In a medical Journal Dr.
O'Brien advocates ae old, theory
that nervous current and electrical
current are Identical, because, first, elec
tricity Is always present when nerves act;
second, electricity is the form of force
which would do the work required; third,
because the terminal and central mechan
ism connected with the nerves correspond
to the terminal and central mechanisms
connected with electrical system of com
munication, and do similar work ln send
ing, receiving, relaying, switching, trans
forming, accumulating, retarding, distrib
uting and translating impressions, and,
fourth, because electricity, with such con
struction of conductors and of terminal
mechanisms. Is the only form of force wÂ«
know of that would do all the work re
quired.âIndianapolis News. ,

of the good players drew close together
and some grood matches will be played

Collier and Smith will meet, as will Bell

Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Yorxo "Womex : â I had frequent headaches of a severe nature,
dark spots before .my eyes, and at my menstrual periods I suffered
untold agony. A member of the lodge advised me to try Lydia E.
IMnkhanVs Vegetable Compound, but I only scorned good advice and
f.-lt that rny case was hopeless, but she kept at ine until I bought a
little and started taking it. I soon had the best reason in the world to
change mv opinion of the medicine, as each day my health improved, and
finally I was entirely without pain at my menstruation periods. . I am most
grateful"â Xettie Blackmore, 28 Central Ave., Minneapolis, Minn.

were compelled to go into executive ses
sion in order to cut short ft wordy wran
gle between Caesa? Young, ,a bookmaker

an auctioneer of this city. Slmmns

selling privileges at the racetrack dur

that he would have Young In the dump

Next Sunday Call's Art Supplement.
â¢ "LtQ. and Leonora," by Vastagh Gezah, portrays Leo and his
.'.consort in a most interesting group, and its technical qualities are
of a high order. The textures of fur, shaggy mane, the contrasting
flatness .of the wall of the cage which serves as a background, and
.thÂ« bits of broken straw in the foreground are rendered with excep-
tional fidelity to nature. The brush work betokens the hanÂ°d of an
. artist who is master of his materials.
Vastagh Gezah is a young Hungarian artist of remarkable tal-
ent, who has not only won an enviable reputation in Budapest and
. in Vienna, but whose works are familiar in other European art ,
â¢ â¢' . â¢ centers; â¢ Â¦ â¢ . .;
. : He devoted himself almost solely to the delineation of wild
animals, and particularly to painting lions. "Leo and Leonora,"

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
Rumor has it that there is soon to be
established, through prlvato initiative, a
national. gallery at Washington. Until the
plans are complete criticism would be su
perfluous, but it may be said at once that
Washington is a peculiarly suitable place
for such an Institution. The government
departments have set .a standard of cu
ratorship which the proposed museum
would surely follow. Eleewhere personal
and local considerations largely determine
such appointments. It is certain, too, that
at "Washington, there, is a population
which could and probably would support
such a gallery handsomely; and a minor
advantage, though a real one. Ig the fact
that a national gallery at the capital
would be out of, the shadow of the art so
cieties, and unvexed by artist jealousies.
The value of this "splendid isolation" is
already strikingly illustrated in the ex
hibition societies of Philadelphia and
Pittsburg.â New York Evening Post.

It has not been decided definitely

Of the Mussulman population.
The Minister's report confirmed infor
mation received by President Roosevelt
and Secretary Hay from unofficial sources.
For this reason it was decided by the
President that Admiral Cotton's squadron
*hould proceed to Turkish waters in ac
cordance .with his original orders, not
withstanding the inaccuracy of the re-
IKJrt of the assault on Consul Maselssen.
In any event that was regarded by this
Government only as an Incident. The
fact that the assault upon the Consul was
not attended by a fatal result simply
modifies the action of the United States
by removing one serious pha.Â«e of a situa
tion that migrht become Intolerable very

After Peck reached home Dr. C. Q. \V.
Bull of Alameda Â¦ was called to take
charge of the case. This physician cor
roborated the others as to the extent of
the Injuries, declaring that Peck's thick
head of hair was all that saved him from
a badly fractured skull. ; -
Dr. Huntington said Peck's body was n
mass of bruises and that his skull would
have been fractured by the blows on the
head had not an unusually heavy growth
of hair protected the skull. As it was
the wounds were very severe and ugly.
Peck's assailants will be arrested as~ soou
as they can be located. He has excellent
descriptions of them. He was unarmed.
Peck managed to get away after his
assailants tired of the uneven battle. The
injured man, bleeding and stunned, made
his way to Dr. Lanz' residence near by
and that surgeon, witJT Dr. "W. D. Hunt
lngton, dressed the young man's Inju
ries, afterward sending him to his resi
dence, 511 Alameda avenue, Alameda.
Peck was on his way home from work
and had been followed from the tele
phone company's offices by two of his
assailant?. The car was crowded and he
was standing on the platform. As the
car started up the grade at the east end
of the Twelfth-street dam the pair grab
bed him and yanked him oft the steps.
They fell in a heap, two other man join
ing the shadowing pair. Before Peck
could assist himself he was struck on the
head with a metal Instrument. He said
he believed it was a pair of wire cutters.
A second blow dazpd the young man and
kicks and - blows rained on him.
' A. P. Peck, 20 years of age, an eni
ploye of the Sunset Telephone Company,
was attacked by four men this evening
and dragged from an Alameda electric
car at First avenue and East Twelfth
street, his scalp laid open to the bone

When interviewed he said thai his ar
rest had taken him by surprise. Both his
wife and father visited him In the Jail.
The father said the deputy sheriff told
him that the/' had been* looking, up his
son's record and found that he hqtd been
married three times and decided to ar
rest him on suspicion. Just how the au
thorities connect the fires with tils many
marriages the father did not know.

almost at the same time the barn of A.
Maloon, another neighbor, was seen to be
on fire. Both barns were a total loss. The
Bachelders saved their -home by fighting
the grass fire before It reached their
barn. â¢
Besides these fires there have been num

Me-ows of a Kitty*
'Tp HAT line above caught and chained your attention to thi^ artidle.
I didn't it? Why? Not merely because it was startlmp: or fatctious,
Â¦*â¢ unusual or bizarre, but because â because it was about a CAT-
That might seem an utterly absurd reason, now that it is through* home
to ycfo so boldly, but it isn't. It is the most natural reason in the world
because â well â because everybody is interested in cats,Â»particularly those
who hate them most. Why? That is one of the mysteries of the ages
that has never been 'explained. Like the riddle oj th* sphinx, it bids fair
to be an eternal mystery, because like the sphinx a catâ any old cat â
will attract and hold your interest as nothing else* can, a even in spite of
j'ourself. V-.*
Through all the ages, in various countries, cats have been ven-
erated as a diety. Deep in fts nature is the spirit of the unfathomable.
Take notice for yourself, no matter how fond you may be of your own
household tabby, there are times when it creeps itgo your preseÂ«ce with
an air of the uncanny in every sly, snake-like movement. â¢ Again brush
its shiny coat in the dark and every hair will enjit/an electric spark. In
all the vast literary lore that clusters about it, it stands with equal adapt-
ibility for truth and falsehood. Purring lazily in the chirlmev cofner it
is the very embodiment of eternal calm and irreproachable dignity.
And yet how quick a fiendish metamorphosis may be wrought. No mat-
ter how tame, it can never be quite trusted. Like h~ilf truths, it is con-
tinually engaged in disarming suspicion, as for instance:
"All the world loves a lover except the girl he is chasing."
"Love controls the matrimonial markef, but mttey often cor-
ners it.'-' .."..
"A man who boasts of his morality needs watching."
"Love -is often a poor paying hot-air investment."
"Memory is Aoth the hope and despair of life."
However, that is quite enough to illustrate the point in question,
namely the. mystery and attractiveness of cats. If you want to hear
more â and of course you doâ any time, all the time â you will see the
big picture of the particular feline about which the above is written and
read the strange article that goes therewith in the next Sundav Call.
Even more fascinating, are the two pages of "Half-Hour Storiettes."
"In the Mystic Wake of the Red Canoe" is one that you will read with
distinct pleasure, nor will you be able to overlook "The Wild Flight of
Cupid and the Comet." Odd titles, eh? Yes. But they're both quaint,
exciting stories. And there are others, you may be sure. "Tatters."
"Elsie's Gray Hat." "A Modern Pandora." "Finding of Her," "Victim?
of a Recoil." "Fables for the Foolish," "Aphorisms From the Silver
Poppy." "Fads and Phrases." "The Oracle of Mulberry Center." etc.
These are not only unusual titles, but each is at the t6p of a clevf.r,
thrilling, new and novel story. You'll read every one of them, and rao.c,
because there is much more to read. Take note further.
There is a full-page story by Josephine Dodge Daskam. who. as every-
body knows, won vast fame for her stories about childrenâ not merely
namby-pamby child stories, but real flesh and blood children. Just
watch for "Ardelia in Arcadia" if you don't know the sort that Miss-
Daskam writes about. You'll laugh until your sides ache.
Then there is "Old John Cbrgon Graham's Alphabet." This is tlie
most original creation ever penned. Will you laugh? Yes. And' do
some serious thinking besides long before you get down to X, Y. Z.
And then there is the third installment of "Brewster's Millions."
which tells what that sorely perplexed but dead game young man did to
make up for lost time after his long, serious iilness to spendâ actually
spendâ not dissipateâ his uncle's million in one short year to inherit six
more. He rushed off to the Mediterranean, well just get The Sunday
Call and read for yourself. It is an installment that makes a complete
story in itself. You don't have to know what went before to be fasci-
nated, enthralled.
Then there is a Sea Monster, that gobbled forty-five tons at one
gobble. It s right here in California waters, too. Can't possibly guess
what it ts. Easiest way is to buy a paper and find out from the pictures
It 5 a wonder.
Then there is the second page of "The Wonderful Kingdom of Won-
. rfu i ,T hinsr ? andâ but it would take as much space as the whole Sun-
day Call itself to tell you about everything.Court Seal Rock. No. v>. Foresters of

CHICAGO, Aug. 29.â The wheat market was
dull and uninteresting and. although "th* open
ing was steady on the cables and early prices
showed a small advance, local sflllnsr quickly
brouKht about a reaction and a loss that wes
not recovered. September opened a bhad?
lower to a shade higher at 81c to 81">Â£c and
foM up to 81*ric, with December following to
82%c. after opening at 82c to 82Hc. There
were reports of heavy receipts for Monday and
this, together with more favorable weather in
dications in the wheat belt, induced the selling
which carried the near months down to 80TAC
and December to 81 %. Toward the end of the
session the pressure lessened and the close was
steady at a loss of %c for Eepterrber at Sic
and of V4Â«JVic for December at 81%@s2c.
The corn market was a little firmer Sep
tember cloyed unchanged at 50*i{p50~Lc- De
cember a shade htcher at 5OT6c.
Oats ruled steady but featureless. The close
wan steady at He loss for Sentember at 34'Ae
and December unchanged at 36Mi<ft3G*Â£c
September lard led the tsro\'ision ' list 1 and
imparted some strength to the market. Trade
was Fmall throughout. SeotembPr pork and

The fruit market was amply supplied and
although trading was active both for local and
shipping account there was no great improve
ment ln prices. The Puget Sound steamer took
out. several thousand packages, consisting
chiefly of table Grapes, fine Peaches and Pears
ln wrappers and crated Plums. The canners
purchased freely of Plums, Prunes and cling
stone Peaches, and occasional lots of Plums
and Prunes sold at $30 per ton. A feT/Â«cat
terlng lots of Pears in bulk were received and
sold for canning account at $25035 per ton.
Stocks of common Apples, Pears. Peaches and
Plums were in heavy supply and prices stood
as previously qucted. Figs and Nectarines
were In limited supply and steady. Quinces
and Pomegranates were offering freely at easy
rate?, but found few buyers owing to the
greenness of the stock. Table Grapes were In
free Supply and weak, except for choice ship
ping stock In crates.- The demand for this
Trult is still limited, as lt Is still more or less
green and sour. Wine Grapes moved slowly at
previous prices. Good Melons,- particularly
Watermelons, were active at steady rates,
while carrled-over offerings of Cantaloupes and
Nutmeg Melons, which were abundant, dragged
at unsettled prices. Choice lots of Berries sold
off well and Raspberries were very firm. A
large portion of the receipts of Blackberries
ami Malinda Strawberries were of poor quality
and' dragged at low rates. The top quotation
for Blackberries was obtained only for fancy
offerings from Santa Cruz. \
Citrus and Tropical fruits were dull and
featureless, with all kinds in ample supply.

The deposits Increased $6,341,000, and as the
amount called for by the sum of the aug
me nt<^,Ioans , an<f of the Ba!n ln cash waÂ«
only $29,800 greater than the Increase ln de
posits, there was a remarkably good balance
The reserve requirements were augmented
Jl. 585.475 through the increase in deposits de
ducting from this sum the Increase in 'cash
leaves $380,375 as the decrease ln surplus re
serve to $20,677,625. Computed upon the basis
of deposits less those of $37,281,800 of public
funds, the surplus is $23,008,375.. The loan*
of the banks are now S2.9S7.C00 In excess of
deposits, sealnst S4.162.800 ln the previous
week, and $5,010,300 in the week ending August
15. Comparison cf changes in loans Indicate
that four cf the larger banks increased this
Item by $5,200,000 net or about equal to the
Increase shown by all the banks. Three of
these institutions gained $2,500,000 net ln cash
The Financier this week says: The striking
feature of the official statement tt the New
York Associated Banks last week was the in
crease of $3,lti0,60O in loans following a gain
of $3,539,300 in the previous week, carrying
this total within $27,097,300 of the highest of
the year and on record the maximum being
*J)50,2O8,7O0 February 21 of the current year.
The Increase last week was probably due to
loans to merchants through direct discounts
and also to some special operations. The loans
to etock commission houses must, lt would
seem, have been small, for thÂ« volume of
transactions on the Stock Exchange was ex
tremely limited and. indeed, the general busi
ness at this center was comparatively light
The cash reserve Increased $1,105 000 last week*
which was $1,253,200 less than that which was
estimated from the traceable movements of
money.

There was a fair demand for river Potatoes
for shipping, but stocks were more than surn
cient for requirements and the market had an
easy tone. Local trading was or small volume
and even the very best Salinas moved slowly.
Sweets were In free supply and easy, with some
dealers offering at conce5Â«ions In order to effect
sales,- Fancy Onions were a little firmer, but
the general run of offerings dragged at pre
vious prices.
Tomatoes continued to weaken under In
creased receipts and large lines had to be car
ried over for Monday's market. A few small
lots of strictly fancy Btock commanded a small
premiuin over the quotations at the stores,
but the bulk of the -receipts could be pur
chased within the quoted range. Carrled-over
stock sold down to 15c per box for packing
purposes. The canners were buying the bay
article at the bottom quotation, but were
unable to secure any great amount. The mar
ket was overstocked with Lima Beans and they
were selling by the sack at easier rates. Re
ceipts of Green Corn included much poor and
wormy stock, which was hard to dispose of
at eny price. Good sound stock, however, was
In fair request at Jteady rates. Pickle Cucum
bers moved freely under & good demand from
packers. The other vegt&ables were In free
supply and prices stood about the same as
before. - - . â¢ \

PLANNING- TO BEVIVE
GERMAN THEATRICALS
The rhinoceros is tied down every two weeks
and receives an oil bath, the keeper applying
neatsfoot oil with a stiff brush. The Ring
ling's specimen of this rarest of all wild ani
mala iÂ» not more than three or four years
old and requires tho greatest of care because
In spito of this toughness of hide and general
appearance, he Is hard to keep alive in cap-
Monkeys require more attention than they
are worth. They must bo cleaned and brush
ed and the worn spots of their fur covered up,
as only a wild ' animal dealer knows how.
If they look weak or sickly they must be doc
tored and the animal hospital or tho winter
quarters has usually n. full complement of
monkey invalids. Snakes call for a good deal
of itroomlng. An expert can tell tho health
of a snake usually by looking at its skin.
The good appearance of a snake depends a
whole lot on washing and oil massaging.
Stranee as It may seem, lions aro not hard
to fix up in the way of toilet. Of coursa care
must be taken that the water Is not too cold,
because lions are sensitive to cold and apt to
go off with galloping consumption Hyenaa and
black leopards are ugly brutes and don't take
kndly to the water. They have to bo roped
down and muzzled in order to give them tho
necessary periodical bathing.
The manicuring of an elephant's great toes
is an 'art In itself. Tho old adage that one
can tell a gentleman by his finger nails Is true
In & limited sense of wild animals. No well
groomed elephant appears in publlo without
his nails carefully trimmed. If you look close
ly at tho elephant's foot you will 6ee that the
nail of each foot Is covered with a skin grow
ing far down,- not unlike that of a human
finger. In a well-kept elephant the skin Is
trimmed and pressed back as much as one's
fingers. The nail itself Is carefully filed down
to tho proper length. It should never bo
cut.
NEED MANICURING.
To go over a herd of elephants such as Ring
line; Brothers have In this cleaning way takes
ten or twelve weeks. Thousands of square feet
of hide rrraet be completely cleaned- and soft
ened. Of course these big beasts are washed
during the winter at short Intervals, but the
animal toilet just before the show leaves Is a
more elaborate, and serious undertaking. Of
course the men do not work on tho same ele
phant all these weeks. It takes several days
for the several baths to take effect and to pre
pare the skin for the new treatment.
In order to keep the skin soft and clean, it
is first carefully oiled. The oil is rubbed well
into the hide, and as a rule six or eight men
are set to work on the same animal. The oil
is applied with swabs of cotton waste and
thoroughly worked In. Some of the men at
tack the elephant's legs, while others climb
ladders and rub the upper reaches of the hugo
back. A keeper stands beside the elephant's
trunk with hooked stick, ready for any emer
gency. Should the elephant kick up in any
way the ladders would be overturned and the
oily back would be bad holding for those on
top. After the elephant Is massaged with oil
he is left alone for a couple of weeks. Tho
next treatment consists of a thorough scrub
bing. By this time the hardened layers aro
ready to come off.
The last treatment consists In sandpapering;
the entire surface. ThÂ« hide, first softened
by oiling and massage and afterward cleaned,
is likely to still remain rough. Of all the
operations this sandpapering is the most
tedious. At best it jtroceeds very slowly. As
many men as can work about tho elephant
without getting In each other's way are de
tailed to sandpaper the same animal. They
attack Its legs, the turnk. even Its ears, all
rubbing vigorously. Again the ladders aro
brought out and leaned against the elephant,
while .workmen perch themselves upon its back
or tho top of its head and proceed to smooth
out the wrinkles. When this Is complete the
elephant cornea forth to all outward appear
ances as good as new. ' -
During the winter months tho circus animala
enjoy a deserved rest, and during this time
the keepers put them through a course of
bathing, combing, brushing and exercising, thÂ«
fine effect of which shows itself when tbÂ» cir
cus begins its annual tour.
GROOMING ELEPHANTS.
Take the circus, horse. Scarcely any society
belle could spend more time upon her toilet
than expert grooms bestow upon these high
etepplng animals. In caring for the wild ani
mals of the menageries' the methods ara usu
ally secret and guarded Jealously by each
kepeer. In tho case of Jungle beasts there ts
an element of danger which gives fascination
to the work.
"To get a wild animal Is one thing, to keep
it is another," said an authority on such
things. Elephants look dirty because of [ a.
habit they have of tossing scXt soil and straw
over their backs, but they are not. No human
being's skin gets more attention than the hides
of these big animals. They are brushed and
scrubbed time and again each day. Twice a
year they get a real Turkish bath, and thia
process is a slow one, taking nearly a month,
and keeps half a dozen' men busy. It may be
that this unending grooming makes their
hides sensitive and the dirt and straw throw*
Ing Is nature's relief. The polar bear Is
douched each day with icy cold water to keep
him trim looking and amiable. The hippo
potamus is scrubbed like a kitchen floor twice
a week. All wild animals are anxiously
looked after In this way by men who know
their nature and tho tray of making them ap
pear with their best foot forward.
Not every one knows that wild animala
must have valets to perform their toilets
and that upon tho proper exercise of this
practice- depends largely the ' health of
the beasts. Alt. T. Ringling, one of the
proprietors of the Rlngling Bros.' circus,
speaking of the care necessary for the
welfare of his menagerie, said:
Health of Captive Beasts De
pends Largely on Clean
liness.
Elaborate Toilet Neces
sary for the Care of

The Psychological Institute, which has been Jn existence about three years,
counts among its members some of the most conscientious and brilliant men of
letters and science In France, among them Th. Rlbot, Sully- Prudhomme, Seallles,
Tardes, Duclaux and ;Brouardel. ' 1 5
At a recent meeting of the institute he made an exhaustive address on "The
Action of Electricity Upon Human Beings." He spoke o r f the sudden shocks of
electricity, as well as the slow method by which It pervades the human system
without the patient being sensible of It-- He showed that "electric treatment Is ex
cellent for certain maladies of the skin, and that -lectri^clty has a powerful ef
fect on microbes and accelerated circulation and respiration Â¦ without fatigue to
the person operated on. Moreover, what Is most important, he said that It acts
strongly on cellular vitality.
He added that electricity will bring about a therapeutic revolution.

Thomas Oberle of the Shenandoah Company Who Once Helped to Entertain the Late Queen Victoria at Windsor.

THE time of Thomas Oberle's lifeâ
Oberle, who has been spying for
the rebel army this week at the
California ? heater â seems to
have been when he went as "gen
tleman super" to -Windsor Castle, when
Queen Victoria commanded a performance
of "Carmen" there, with^Zelie de Lussan.
At least, that is what Mr. Oberle decided
to enlarge upon* when I went to chat with
him the other afternoon, that and Ari
zona, of which his description reads as if
he had it to sell: Slightly Jealous, as I
am fa the latter case for California, I
recognize that Mr. Oberle's enthusiasm
is no more than fit. When a man's life
has been saved propriety urges gratitude
to the medium, and to the well-known
virtues of the Arizonan climate the acttfi'
owes his life. Even so, however, he be
gan with London. He was "over there" â
as the Immortal Mrs. Pat urged me to
*a.yâ as stage manager for Charles Froh
man in a production of "The Lost Para
dise" at the Adelphi Theater. It was is.
Zelie de Lussan's heyday and the Queen
had commanded Sir Augustus Harris to
produce "Carmen" at the castle with
Zelie as the point salient. The matter

don what the Lamb's is to New York,
and it was there that "Billy" Ablngd'an,
Sam Sothern (E. Sothern's brother) end
a tew other English' actors arranged a
visit to the high altar of -.the English
aristocracy for the pleasure of their
American brother.
"Billy Abingdon suggested It," Mr.
Oberle recalled gratefully. We sat in' the
office of the California Theater, with the
actor In the center of the stage, Mr. Apk
orman drawing up a contract with" %
pretty, young actress behind me; Mr.
Ravlin, the urbane business manager,
plying th,e fretful typewriter at my left,
and the Neill-Morosco manager encour
aging the interviewed e.t my right. Mr 3 .
Oberle's coat was buttoned at the top, so
1 don't know whether the red vest that
peeked above was intentional. He wore;
an Elks' pin and a. suit that Kardly sug
gested he would appear in overalls at re
hearsal, as he tells me he is wont to do
in Phoenix. " His rebellious eyebrows,
shelve over pleasant hazel eyes, whose
pupils have a melancholy trick of cling
ing to the lid?, and he yet bears the red : ;
brown label of the Arizona sun on his
well-cut visage.
"Billy Abingdon suggested ft," he said.
"We were at the Greenroom Club one,
day, talking about the royal performance!
cf 'Carmen,' and I said I'3. like very
much to go down to Windsor. I didn't
happen to be in request as Don Jose, and
neither did Sir Augustus Harris implore
Abingdon to appear as the toreador. In
fact, we neither of us could sing a note.
Still, we determined then and there that
Her Majesty should invite us to Windsor
Castle. I've got the 'command' yet ia'my
desk at home. The only way was to go
as 'gentlemen supers.' "
'Gentlemen supers'?" I Interrupted.
"There is in London," Mr. Oberle ex
plained, "a class of supers Â¦who do noth
ing else but go on in evening dress â not
the mob and soldier sort, but supers who
must appear as gentlemen."
I forgot to ask here If there was a class
of ladies who had learned to keep their
mouths shut and wear the gown decollete
among the female "supes" of London.
"But as 'gentleman supers' we deter
mined to go down to Windsor," the actor
continued. "Altogether there were 409
people in that production, and anything
more inspiring than Harris' rehearsals
hasn't come within my experience. He
was everywhere. He rehearsed every
body, supers included, and I tell you it
was a production when he got through
with it"
"You have not yet told me what part
you played?" I suggest.
' I'm coming to that," the actor said.
"We â Abingdon, Sam Sothern, Charlie
Overton, Thornburgh, Seymour Hicks,
eight *or ten of us altogether went
as the halberdiers who arrest Don Jose!"
"At least you were not proud," I com
ment
"No." the actor laughed; "but it was
an experience altogether memorable. We,
of course, wtnt down by special train to
Windsor, and I shall never forget the
beauty of the little village, lying under

for I wanted to get a look at the Queen
as she came in. I happened to be lucky,
and tfirough a row of equerries I got a
very near glimpse of her. A short, little
thing ehe was. with a beautiful face and
simple, royal manners. She was dressed
In the plainest possible way. â¢ â¢ â¢ Of
course, the performance went well, and
afterward we were all cummond to cup

niflcenee of the service if you haven't
been there."
"I haven't," I said. "Tell about it. But
I hope you got a souvenir spoon."
"I didn't," laughed the actor. "I did
better. I got a punch glass with "V. R.'
carved on it, with the lord chamberlain's
permission. Clarkson, the hairdresser to
the royal family, managed It for me. He
was a. funny chap, with a great way of
talking about 'When I saw the Queen
last,' 'Her Majesty said this and that to
me.' but he got me the glass. Tou have
to have the lord chamberlain's consent to
take anything from the palaceâ it's the
Eame as the Queen's."
"I do wish," I ineonsequently mur
mured, "that Gilbert had left me a shred
of Illusion as to lord chamberlains. I can
only see Dukes at thece a penny and
lord chamberlains waltzing through life
'Iolanthe' fashion."
The American returned: "He Is truly
a tremendously dignified person. And I
did dine off gold plate that night at
Windsor." I ,.
"Tell about the trtne," Mr. Parker In
terjected here.
"I'll do my best," the actor said. Then,
smiling a little guiltily, he began: "You
know, they served any kind of wine you
asked for at the banquet, but it Is all
served without labels on the bottles, and
I heard afterward that in the excitement
of my first meeting with royalty and
the strangeness generally I had chal
lenged the . lackey to prove it was Cha
teau he had given me. His astonish
ment went Into history. I don't answer
for the story, though."
"Ablngdon tells it the same way," Mr.
Parker confirmed.
"The wine labels are removed because
of advertisement?* I Inquired.
"Just bo," Mr. Oberle replied. "It is
further on record as to the banquet," he
then went on with a certain pride, "that
the royal train was kept waiting at Wind

of an hour for the 'gentleman supers.' '"

the remaining members of the company.
"Lucia" Is the opera. In the title rolo
will appear Adelaide Tromben, to whom
rumor gives the chief fame of. the year's
organization. SIgnorina Tromben has the
promising title of the "Venetian night
ingale," and Is said to have the willing
ear of Europe.
Agostini will be heard for the first time
as Edgar and needs no Introduction to
San Francisco. I hear he looks thinner
than when we sent him away last year.
He'll probably mend a' that before the
Week's out. Such a handshaking as there
was when the silver-voiced tenor walked
into the Tlvoll last Wednesday!
Others who will appear In the Immortal
sextet are Guiseppe Zanlnl, as Henry
Ash ton: Alfredo Tedeschl. as Buckfaw,
and Dado, of course, as Raymond.
Mr. Steindorff, too, over and above
everything, will be in front of a largely
augmented orchestra and a picked chorus
that has been singing its best for weeks
past. â¢ Ladles and gentlemen, the opera is
served !
The Philharmonic Symphony orchestra
has begun work and announces this year
as its president Glulio Minettl, who also
continues as conductor. No better choics
could have been made, as those remem
bering Mr. Mlnettl's excellent guidance of
the society's fortunes last year will heart
ily agree. It Is long since the affairs of
this long famous society- were In such
flourishing condition and the prospects
for the coming season argue the contin
uance of its prosperity. Mr. Minetti has
a number of novelties in contemplation
for. the season's programme. As before
the rehearsals will take place on Monday
evenings at Curtaz Hall, to which appli
cations for membership in the society
should be sent to the secretary.
Women interested in ensemble singing
will do well to Join the Treble Clef Club,
a bright little band of singers that this
week began the fifth year of their pleas
ant work. The club meets at Elks* Hall
on Monday afternoons at 2:30 o'clock and

'old a short time ago by a minister who
iiad been preaching over forty years that
he believed he had done a great amount
of good, yet he could not tell how many
souls - he had saved or how many poor
and sitfk ha had helped, but said he:
â¢Brother Baright, I believe you have done
more good. to humanity by founding the
Royal Achates in the three short years
of Its existence than I have done in all
these years of preaching. When I see
how fast the amount 1 paid beneficiaries
is . increasing in our noble young order,

assist the needy, I can but say godspeed
you In your work. If I could see the
actual results from the Jtoyal Achates

are etill visiting the - lodges of the.
jurisdiction explaining the new plan of
assessments which the representatives
of the subordinate lodges will have
to pass upon in special session . to
be held in this city during the month
of September. The new plan was fully
explained" at the July session of the
Grand Lodce of Oregon, at which Supreme
Muster Workman Miller was a visitor..
He explained the new J&ea, which, whil*
it has made a gradual raise in the assess
ment of the members of tho younger ties,
has more than doubled that of thÂ« mem*
brrs over fifty-five. After a fjMr days'
session the action taken by. that body Is
explained as follows by the A. O. U. \V.
bulletin, which, is the official organ of the
Supreme Lodge: , "â¢ l
'â¢Of the four" days 1 cession of our Grand
Ixidee the preater portion was- consumed
In the consideration of the new plan of
assessment rates, adopted by our Supreme
Lodge. The Supreme Master "Workman
being present, together with our supreme
representatives, afforded every fietall of
Information as to the various provisions
cf the two plans Â«ubmltted.-and enabled
our Grand Lodpe to take the. action U" did
fully advised In the matter, and whlcfc
when submitted' to ballot was very
promptly rejected by indefinite postpone
ment. While the main plan as to the In
crease in assessment ratfts was rejected,
and we think wisely eo, and as our Juris
diction Is now /seemingly in a most
healthy condition, the condition, of several
of the other Grand Lodges is such as to
increase threefold our guaranty fund as
sessments to the Supreme Lodge.
"There is added reason for not adopt'
ing the proposed change at this time.
That it Is now in force in at least one
jurisdiction, New Tork, "end the results 1
of its adoption can be studied and -will
afford us and the Supreme Lodge prac
tical demonstration cf Its working, in a
measure, to correct the errors of former
plans tinder which the order has worked,
and these practical workings mar result
in amendments that shall evolve a plan,
the reasonableness of which shall appeal
to the good Judgment cf our entire mem
bership, and which will be at once adopted
by every Grand Lodge jurisdiction, and
yet bring health end vigor to'tha order."

Franklin Lodge No. 44 was visited last

ing and Grand Organizer Freeman for
the purpose of explaining the plan under,
which it is expected the order will, work
after the lÂ£t of next January The visi

questions and after the answers had been

of the members of the lodge was that the;

Miss Gertrude Carroll has been- spending the summer months In the country.
Last week *he went to Santa Cruz for a short visit. '
There Is no date set for the wedding of Miss- Carroll and George E. Hall
and I do not think it will take place for several months yet. Society will be
interested in this marriage as the principals are extremely popular. The Car
roll family has been prominent in San Francisco for many years. The bride
elect is a daughter of Mrs. Richard Carroll and a sister of Mrs. Will Whittler.
Mr. Hall is a deliirhtful man. He is the representative of the Turkish Gov
ernment and I understand has been knighted by the Sultan for his services. He
is a member of the Bohemian, Paclflc-Unlon' and University clubs. His recent
book, "A Balloon Ascension at Midnight,'' has met with success.
A FEW people with social aspirations stand in great danger of being
flubbed "cUmbers" If they do not change their tactics before putting
themselves on record many times more. Asking for Invitations is their
latest breach of pood manners and one whichâ like a bachelorâ should
be disciplined and discouraged. These embryo "cllmbere" have acquired
a fray of asking for Invitations to one place and another with a persistence
worthy of a better cause. September bjides and their mammas are being besieged
with requests for invitations by a few whom they felt under, no obligation to a^k
because of the plight acquaintance.' A peculiar line of thought must assist these
aspirar.ts in making excuses for their acts, as. they could not possibly ask a hos
tess giving a dinner-dance to make them a present pf $5 or $10, yet they seem
to ask its equivalent in food and hospitality Â¦ without any apparent qualms of
conscience.
If a hostess does not send an invitation, it is evident that she does not want
you to come. It may be because her list is entirely filled, or that you would not
be congenial to the others she is entertaining on this particular occasion. Cer
tain it Is that she has a reason and there is not one chance In a hundred that
the omission was an oversight. .
While thtse climbers are so busily at work it Is easy to understand that a
certain fortification should be supplied for- those who wish to escape the on
slaufjjt. At DiÂ»l Monte not long ago one woman became such a bete noire that
two friends arranged a sort of code upon signs of approach.
One would say, "Your hatpin is coming out!" by way of warning her friend
that the enemy was coming up to break into the conversation. If the one ap
prised had a r-a-n to avoid the newcomer she would reply:
"Oh, no! It's always that way!" If she depended upon the tact of her friend
to meet th* situation, she would say: "Thank you very much." Thus were the
lines from Miss Blngham's recent play appropriated' to advantage.
