The nature of sensational evidence
to be produced by Rathbone against
Wood was last night made known by
former Havana officials, who it is prob
able will be called upon to testify be
fore the Senate committee which fs in
vestigating the charges. This evidence,
it is claimed, will show that Rathbone
has every reason for vindication of, the
court* charges against him and that
Wood is to be held accountable*^ for
many acts which, to say the least, de
mand Investigation.
This plainly showed the spirit of
Wood; As far as Rathbone was con
cerned he .was an Inferior officer and,
of course, had to bow to the Inevitable.
This is not to say that Rathbone is en
tirely Innocent of the charges made
against him by Wood, or that Wood's
actions are to be censured. The inves
tigation now /in progress will decide
that.
Six months before the postal investi
gation was even thought of Wood re

apolis man heretofore quoted:
"They (Neeley .and Rathbone) have
come down here to make money, and I
shall see that they don't do it."

Pasteur Institute was called upon to
send Dr. Marmorek immediately. He
went, injected his new serum and the
patient recovered. .
"In 1898 Dr. Marmorek began work in
secret upon his investigation of tuber
culosis bacilli. For four years he made
almost Incessant experiments. Two
years ago he became satisfied, that he
was in possession, of the secret which
had so long lain hidden from scientists.
"Dr. Marmorek was called to treat
Prince Henry of Pless, who was ill with
tubercular disease. His condition was
considered hopeless after the court phy
sicians had exhausted all their skill.
Dr. Marmorek went .to the bedside of
the Prince and subjected-hlm to a series
of treatments with his serum. Prince
Henry recovered entirely and Is In good
health to-day." .

test to wrest - the social laurels from
Mrs. Rathbone. Her position as wife
of the Military Governor of the island
gave her a, prominence and advantage
that Mrs. Rathbone did .not enjoy; yet,
despite all this", she failed to dislodge
Mrs. Rathbone from her eminent social
pedestal.
From, a pseudo friendly passage at
arms the contest between the two as
pirants for social leadership grew to
dangerous proportions. The mutual
dislike of the wives of the two officials
came to the surface and forced issues
between the husbands.
"Dr." Marmorek," said Professor Gb'tt
heil, to-day, "is barely 38 years of age.
He was born In Austria and studied
medicine in Vienna, where he received
his degree. After several years as one
of the leading surgeons in the Austrian
capital he became interested in the
field of asepsis and entered the clinic
of Pasteur. Almost at the beginning
of this course he astounded the heads
of the institute by the discovery of an
antidote for puerperal fever, which ap
peared in therapeutic treatises as the
â¢Mafmorek cure.' In 1894 he was made
chef Ide laboratoire of Pasteur Insti

NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Dr. Alexander.
Marmorek, whose discovery of a serum
whjch he claims has cured tuberculosis
has just been announced in Paris, de
clares through a friend in this city that
he bases his claim in part upon a long
series of experiments, Â« ne of which was
the cure of no less a person than Prince
Henry of Pless, sci jn of the princely
house of Germany. Among other cures
claimed for Dr. Marmorek is that of a
Carmelite nun, in attending whom he
became, perhaps, the only man who
ever penetrated Into the forbidden pre
cincts of the convent of Our Lady of
Carmel. The data of Dr. . Marmorek's
experiments and their results are given,

On November 18 General Wood start
ed on an expedition against a body of
2000 Moros, who are In the mountains
back of Tablibi. No news of this
movement has yet been received..
General Wood has under him two
battalions of the Twenty-eighth Infan
try, one of the Twenty-third, a platoon
of Captain George G. Gatleys' battery,
two troops of the Fourteenth Cavalry
and a detachment of engineers. Ma
jor Scott was assisting with a force
composed of three companies of the
Seventeenth Infantry, a platoon of
Captain D. J. Rumbough's battery and
a troop of the Fourteenth Cavalry.
The rebel forces have been literally
destroyed by these operations. General
Wood says the indications are that
there will be no extension of the ris
ing, which was handled without diffi
culty.
ANOTHER BATTLE PROBABLE.
The rebel position was attacked on
the flank by the American trcops, which
occupied the town and inflicted a loss
of fifty killed on the Moros. Hassen,
with a small pa"rty, surrendered. The
rest of the Moros went into a swamp,
out of which they were driven on No
vember 16, leaving seventy-six dead
behind them. On November 17 the
American force renewed the attack on
the retreating Moros, of whom forty
more were killed.
The fighting took place In a country
covered by swamps and rocks. The
Moros were driven across the country
from Siet Lake to the town which Haa
sen had made his headquarters and
where it was reported that the Moros
were 2000 strong.
HASSEN IS BECAPTUBEI).
Major Scott was taking Panglima
Hassen, the Moro leader, who had been
taken prisoner, to Jolo. While en route
Hassen asked to be allowed to see^his
family. His appeal was granted and
he thereupon led Major Scott into an
amtruah. where the American detach
ment was fired upon. Major Scott was
shot in both hands. Hassen succeeded
In escaping during this unexpected at
tack.
General 'Wood landed near Siet Lake,
in Jolo, on November 12. The Moros
were soon located and fighting began
immediately and continued until No
vember 17. .
MANILA, Nov. 23.â Three hundred
Moros are known to have been killed
and many others were carried off dead
or wounded as a result of five days' se
vere fighting in Jolo between the
American troops under Major General
Wood and the insurgents. Major H.
L. Scott of the Fourteenth Cavalry and
five American privates were wounded.

the action of the United States In isth

They look with favor on the acts of the
United States and express the opinion
that it has acted rightly in isthmian
affairs. The people of Chile are In fa

Wilson says.
The Minister's dispatch makes no ref

to leave Bogota on the leave of absence
granted him by the State Department.
No uneasiness is felt by the department
for the Minister's personal safety.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 22.â The press
of Colombia continues to severely crit
icise and denounce the American Gov
ernment for its action in isthmian mat
ters and the recognition of the republic
cf Panama. This is shown in a dis
patch received at the State Department
last night from Minister Beaupre at
Bogota. President Roosevelt, the
United States Congress and the Amer

The German Minister to-day gave a
banquet to the Colombian Ministers of
War and Foreign Relations, during
which he said that he deplored the oc
currences on the isthmus of Panama.
Discussing the situation, the Bogota
press asks that, in case an amicable
agreement should be reached between
the Government and Panama, the ca
r.al treaty be ratified and political and
administrative autonomy be granted to
Panama, the former department re
maining in the United States of Colom

BOGOTA, Nov. 21. â Pending the ar

great military preparations will con

the isthmus exists. It is believed that
General Reyes will purely effect satis
factory arrangements, otherwise the
Colombian army is unanimously in
favor cf marching overland and re
establishing Colombia's integrity.
Carlos Rico, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, in his latest note to United States
Minister Beaupre says:
"If the United States prevents the
disembarking of Colombian troops to
the isthmus, thereby violating the
treaty of 1846, the world's civilization
will suffer more than a passing inter

oughly," he continued. "The way Gov

caused the War Department' to reply
that troops could not be furnished, but
if conditions are such that there is real
need of Federal troops, I have no doubt
they will be sent. I shall go from here
to Tellurlde and will, probably stop at
Cripple Creek a few days* as I return."

W. A. Richardson, cashier ~ of the

him in authority stood ".Andrews, who
handled the cash here. Many thou
sands of dollars passed through his
hands and he had- always accounted
for every cent of it.
Last . Tuesday two of the employes
discovered a shortage in the cash
amounting to more* than $2000. An
drews was charged with having caused
it and -confessed and asked until Sat
urday to make it good. Instead of en
deavoring to make good his shortage
he secured a check for nearly $2000,
which he cashed' and pocketed the pro
ceeds. He disappeared Thursday night,
after having spent most of the day
quietly changing gold coin for cur
rency. ' v The detectives have been un
able to find any trace of him.
The cause of his downfall is drink,
horse races and women. He is unmar

CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Nov. 22.â
Sheriff Henry Robertson, after investi
gating the conditions in the sixth level
of the Vindicator mine, where Super
intendent Charles McCormack and
Fhift Bops Beck were killed yesterday
by an explosion, coincided with the
statement of the officials of the Vindi-
Little Doubt That Criminals Caused
Vindicator Mine Explosion.
DYNAMITE THEIR WEAPON.
The r.ain point of difference between
the miners and their employers is rec
ognition of the union, and this the coal
companies positively refuse to consider.
The State Board of Arbitration has al
ready offered its services in settling the
differences between the contending par
tief. but neither side has as yet accept
ed t'.x- board's offer.
Sheriff Wiicox says he has already
arrested several persons who were dis
charging firearms for the purpoBe of
intimidating men who wished to work,
and reports that at Scofield men havÂ«
been assaulted and threatened with
death if they persisted in working
against the strike agitators.
Brigadier General J. C. Cannon, com
manding the Ptate National Guard, left
to-day to investigate conditions in the
disturbed district and will report to
the Governor as to the necessity for
railing <^ut the troops. Governor Wells
hns received a report from State Coal
Mine Inspector Thomas, indicating that
many more miners are on strike than
has been previously reported. Thomas
Fays that at Sunnyside loss than 100
men out o* 850 are at work. At Castle

SALT LAKE, Utah. Nov. 22.â Sheriff
Wiicox of Carbon County has appealed
to Governor Wells to call out the State
troops to protect the coal mine districts
of his coufcty. which are included In
the recent strike order issued by the
fraud Mine Workers of America.
"The local police authorities and dep
uty sheriffs are not sufficient and are
powerless to cope with the lawlessness
and protect life and property and main
tain law and order," Sheriff Wiicox
say? ir. h!s telegram to the Governor.
"My resources are exhausted, and

\ NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â The last rites
were performed over the body of Mrs.
Harriet Maxwell Converse, "the great
white mother" of the six nations of the
great Iroquois confederacy. Eulogies
were pronounced by the dead woman's
pastor and by the chiefs of the various
clans , of the Seneca nation, by whom
Mrs. .Converse was adopted when a lit
tle girl.'. Â¦
... In addition to the delegations from
the; six nations, there were present
representatives of the Hurons, Sioux,
Abinki,- ; Algbnquln3,' Aztecs of Mexico
and several other tribes. '
Rev. Dr. Thomas H. Sill, the dead
woman's pastor, read the Episcopal
service, for the dead,- after which Wil
liam Crow, & .Seneca warrior, /nade an
address in his native tongue. In speak
ing 'he' addressed himself to. the dead
woman, before him and in conclusion
wished her happiness in the spirit
land. â¢Â¦"â¢. * ' â¢ \
Ohauncey Abrahams, also a Seneca,
acting for Chief Corn Planter, informed
Mr.' Keppler, long associated with Mrs,-
Cbnverse in her work among the In
""dians, that Keppler had been selected
to take the great white mother's office.
Keppler, in accepting, promised to
faithfully administer the trust Imposed
in him.
Chief Corn Planter followed, wearing
under, his waistcoat a red sash. While
tears streamed down his face, he ex
pressed grief in a few words of broken
English, and then, sinking back in his
chair, buried his face in his hands and
wept aloud.
Dark Cloud, a magnificent looking
Indian, with hair streaming below his
broad shoulders, said:
I know the great white mother as every
redman In this land knows her. She studied
the Indians' religion, the true religion. Our
God touched this woman's heart, and she un
derstood us. ShÂ» was the angel of God. "We
may not have a Christ in our religion, but we
have a mediator, anit she was the great media,
tor between the whites and the Indians. Phe
was a leader to us. She inspired us to better
things. We loved her, and now she Is gone
from us. But while we are sad. it Is for us
that we are sad, not for her. because wa
know 6he is happy.
Addresses were made by Chief Long
fellow, Morris Leigh, and Carlos, an
Aztec Indian from Mexico.

addition to physicians' treatment every-

Since 1902, when Admiral Casey re
fused to permit the transportation^ of
the Colombian troops on the ; Panama
Railroad,, General Salazar has enter
tained "a bitter dislike for the. people of

cabled, through the Associated Press a
scnsationallprotest to the world against
the action of Admiral Casey. >. ;Â¦': Â¦'
General Salazar is most inflaming to
the younger element of the Colombians.
He is courageous and energetic,- but of
a quixotic nature, and probably be
lieves that his statement that an army
of 100,000 is being organized will stun
the people of the new republic. .

been requested to give his opinion con
cerning the present trend of affairs on
the isthmus, and telegraphs as follows
from Palmira, in the department Â« of
Cauca:
PALMIRA. Nov. 21.â I consider the move
ment unworthy and unpatriotic. I deplore It
deeply becauee in each Panamaian I see a
friend and brother, and- because for that land
I would wish only days .'of glory and welfare.
The road it follows leads to suicide and even

Government. An army of.100.0C0 men, now'be
lnjr organized and : to be commanded by both
Liberal- and Conservative leaders, will soon
inarch on the Isthmus. V
The fact that American help was asked. for

this morning appeared at a public cere
mony, officiating at high mass in the
Cburcb of Santa Cecelia, his titular
church. It was announced that Cardl- i

From what little could be gleaned
from the brief messasre received last
evening, the Clarys are Inclined to be
lieve that their daughter will nqt long
keep her anxious parents irf ignorance
of whom she has selected as a husband.
Mrs. Barrett, as Mabel Clary, in past
years received many favorable notices
in connection with her social affairs
.and was admired on all sides as a
young woman of many splendid accom
plishments. She possesses a tall, sleh
der*and striking figure, has a_ beauti

FRENCH BARK FRANCOIS COPPEE
IS WRECKED OFF POINT REYES
Mrs. MabvÂ»l Barrett is widely known
in this city.where the news of her mar
riage will be received with* as much
surprise as by her many friends in
Stockton. For years It has been the
custom of her father, who is one of the
leading lawyers of Stockton, to bring
his family to this city during the win
ter months, and with her equally pretty
Bister, Ethel, the bride had shared the
attentions from many admirers. Es
pecially were they favorites in the mil
itary set. Many a young lieutenant had
begged the hand of Mabel Clary in
marriage, but without success.
. Frequently society matrons wondered
why Mabel Clary did not accept one
of the frequent proffers of marriage
made to her and not a few had been
bold enough to even ask her regarding
her matrimonial preferences. But Ma,-
Little did the many friends of Mabel
Clary of Stockton, when they bade her
a safe Journey on her recent departure
from the city, dream that within a fort
night she would be a bride. The last to
imagine that her trip would include her
honeymoon were her parents, and pos
sibly Miss Clary's mlr.d, at the time,
contained no thought of matrimony.
Yesterday, while Mr. and Mrs. Clary
and their daughter Ethel were quietly
spending the Sabbath in their apart
ments at the Occidental Hotel, they
were suddenly shocked i>>" the news,
conveyed to them In a telegram from
Charleston, S. C. that Mabel had bo
come the wife of Carroll C. Barrett.
The message was painfully brief, sim
ply announcing that the marriage had
been performed in an Episcopal church
in Charleston in the forenoon; that the
young couple were about to leave for
North Carolina and from there they
purposed to continue on to New York
City. The telegram bore the signature
of the bride. It asked for no parental
blessing and contained not the slightest
intimation as to who the happy young
husband is other than to give his name.
SEEKS IDENTITY OF GROOM.
Who Carroll C. Barrett Is will prob
ably be determined . to-day, for the
father of the pretty bride kept the
wires busy last evening trying to glean
some .knowledge of his future son-in
law, and, with his distracted wife, his
anxious daughter and a son, who ar
rived on the evening train from Stock
ton, shortly after the news of the mar
riage was received, impatiently awaited
a reply until a late hour last nightâ but
in vain.
PANAMA, Nov. 22.â An imposing
scene took place this morning in. the
plaza d'Armas when Minister of War
Obarrio was presented to the troops of
the new republic, Senor Arias, a mem
ber of the Junta, and General Huertas.
Senor Arias made a short speech to the
soldiers, who paraded in front of the
Minister, paying him the honor due to
his rank. The Panama divisions of the
Isthmian troops, fully uniformed and
flying the national colors, took part in
the ceremony.
A prominent Panamaian. referring to
night to the efforts of the Bogota Gov
ernment to the peopie of the
Isthmus and to the suggestion made
that, should Panama re-enter the
union, it would be given political and
administrative autonomy and that the
canal treaty' would be ratified, said:
"These are the last efforts to s-ave Co
lombia from the complete disaster
which is imminent. We are sincerely
sorry for our brothers, h^ut we know the
Colombians too well to believe their
promises. "We do not doubt their good
faith, still their Quixotic nature and
the enthusiasm of the momoht make
them deceive themselves, not us. We
would do anything for our brothers, but
our destinies now and forever must be
separate. Civilization has so decreed."

TROOPS SALUTE NEW CHIEF.
Aside from the tariff question the
matter of most eerious moment Is the
enforcement of the Congressional act
requiring thÂ« carrying trade between
the United States and the Philippines,
as well as the coastwise trade of the
inlands, to be confined 6trictly to ves
sels carrying the American flag after
July 1 next. At the present time Phil
ippine commerce Is carried in British
Fhlps to the extent of 59 per cent of
the foreign trade of the islands. Other
foreign vessels carried practically the
remainder of this commerce, leaving
\vA\ Z per cent to American vessels.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 22.â The devel
opment of the Philippine Islands dur
ing the past year Is displayed In the an
cual report of Colonel Clarence R. Ed
vards. chief of the Bureau of Insular
Affairs of the War Department, made
public to-day. The accomplishment of
greatest Importance to the Islands dur
ing the year has been the successful
launching of the new fiscal system. By
January next the new system will be
in complete operation.
The new circulation medium consists
cf 18.000,000 pesos In fractional silver
coins and 10,000,000 pesos in paper
money. To establish the new system
and purchase the silver coinage two
issues of bonds were made of $3,000,000
each, both of which were sold at a pre
mium. The proceeds of the sale of
these bonds were deposited and drew
interest at the rate of 3^ per cent, so
that the Government actually made
money by going: into debt.
Colonel Edwards emphasizes the ne
cessity of a reduction of the Dlngley
tariff rates for the encouragement of
trade between the United States and
the Philippines. There is an active de
eire on the part of the Philippine com
mercial Interests, he says, for tariff
concessions, and the report states that
the same desire has been evinced by
the same interests in this country.
The chief exports of the Islands to
the United States are sugar, tobacco,
hemp and copra. The latter two com
modities are already on the free list.

Wyse, "it is rendering a service to all

means."
be impossible to send troops overland
and should they be sent by sea Ameri
can warships would stop the trans
ports. He suggests that an escort of
European warships to the Colombian
troops would prevent this. Finally,
the writer says that if the United
States should resort to the employ
ment of "brute force" Colombia would
be Justified in resorting to reprisals and
seizing the United States Minister at
Bogota and other American residents
of Colombia.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 22.â The three
highwaymen who some days agro held
UP fourteen men in a saloon, robbed
them of $150 and then overlooked $2500

Mine Inspector Callahan concluded an
inspection of the mine to-day and said

a prominent capitalist and former
treasurer of the Colorado i"uel and Iron
Company, was found dead In bed at
9:30 o'clock this morning at his sum
mer home at Buffalo Park, about forty
miles from Denver. He was discovered
by his housekeeper, who had instruc

by an overdose of a drug which he had
been in the habit of taking to induce
sleep. Death was evidently accidental,
and the Coroner, who arrived this aft
ernoon, made a statement to that ef
fect. The body was brought to Denver
to-night. Jerome leaves a wife and two

Saturday night. They had a dispute
and it Is alleged that Coyle hit Wilson
on the head with a beer bottle, inflict
ing two scalp wounds. Coyle was ar
rested and booked at the City Prison
on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon and the broken pieces of the
bottle were befoked as evidence against
him. Wilson went to the Railroad Hos
pital and had his wounded scalp stitch
ed and dressed.

The wounded boy was brought to this
city as soon as possible and taken to
the Harbor Hospital. Dr. Millar, the
surgeon in charge, upon making an ex
amination found that the sight of the
left eye had been entirely destroyed,
and in order to save the boy's life re
moved the optic. Several of the shot
punctured the right lung, but the In
iuries. although serious, are not re
garded as necessarily fatal.
As the result of the premature dis
charge of a shotgun in the hands of
George Ravini, Alfred Debenidetti, a
14-year-old lad, residing at 1523% Du

in a precarious condition. The injured
boy. in company with George Ravini
and his uncle, Hugo Ravini of 1225 Un

morning on a hunting trip on the hills

to mar the day's pleasure until late in

â¢Burglars entered* the residence of
Mrs. A. S. Turner of 2010 Cedar street
during her absence in San Francisco
last night and robbed It of $150 worth
of jewelry. Entrance was effected
through the kitchen door by means
of a skeleton key, which was found
wide open by Mrs. Turner when she
returned home last night. This makes
the seventh burglary that has oc
curred in Berkeley within a week.
The burglars turned the Turner house
upside down in their search for money.
Mrs. Turner has her money on deposit,
however, and the burglars had to be
satisfied with all the gold Jewelry they
could find. They finally made off with
two gold watches, three gold chains,
cuff buttons, pins and rings, leaving
Mrs. Turner the loser by $150. There
was a lot of silverware In the house
which the burglars could have taken,
but they did not seem to think it was
worth the trouble to carry away. A
tin cash box was smashed to pieces,
but as there was no money in it the
burglars had their trouble for nothing.

PERSONAL MENTION.
"A few days ago we read of a young
woman who died in the madhouse and
she reaped the wages of sin In death.
She was the daughter of a prominent
physician and married a man against
her father's wishes. A brief career on
the stage, then a drunkard's career
and then the tomb. â¢

Young women are going to ruin and
degradation on account of their de

awful slaughter of character and repu

slaughter-houses that leads Its mates
to their death, so thousands follow in
the course of those who go down to
disgrace in the search for social sue
cess.
"Thousands of young me n and
women when warned will say, 'Oh yea
I know it is all true what you say but
1 know when to stop.' ,

and ruin in the search for social SU c!

thousands who are not strong and who
cannot save themselves from the dith
that follow, the excesses or sociaM^
REAPED WAGES OF SIN.
"The newspapers are daily filled with
such instances of ruin brought about
by endeavors to reach social success.
Even to-day we read In the papers of
a cousin of William -Vanderbllt who
died In a cheap lodging-house fre
quented by tramps. He was well con
nected, well educated and was married
to a beautiful and good woman. But
his social success led to social excess.
His wife was forced to leave him and
he sank to degradation.
" 'A good fellow* will drink with his
companions and then go home drunk to
his wife and family, or he will take a
companion home who Is in that condi
tion.
".How many are there of these good
fellows who, for social success, dis
honor their God and their parents. I
quote one instance of a young man
who killed himself because he could
not face the results of his social ex
cesses.
"We must not forget the bitterness
of his end. This strong man was made
tveak and a dupe in the lap of a Delilah
and truly it was said, 'That her steps
lead down to death, her feet lead down
to hell.*
"Too often is the excuse made of a
man who goes to excess in social life
by saying, 'He Is a good fellow." It Is
the 'good fellows' who go down to de
struction. It is a poor apology to say
of a man, 'He is a good fellow.'
"Dr. Holland said that 'a good fel
low' is a bad fellow through and
through; he Is as vain as a peacock, as
selfish as a pig and as unprincipled as
a thief. *
"HE IS A GOOD FELLOW."
"Jovial nature in social life leads too
often to excesses and disaster. Sam
son's jovial nature led to his ruin and
it was left to the young lad David to
establish the kingdom of Israel as an
instrument In the hands of God.
"How often we see bright men fall
in life on account of their excesses in
social life. It was so with Samson. He
went to excess in social life and also
failed morally. His enemies made sport
of him and he died by his own hand. In
disgrace, a slave, in dishonor, a sui
cide.
"Samson was a type of the social
success on which I speak to-night. He
was well trained by his parents to be
an honor to them and his family. Good
parentage Is a great need of the present
day. Not sufficient attention is given
by parents to the selection of the play
mates of their children, who are des
tined later on to become their associ
ates in social life.
"Samson was well looked after in his
youth and on account of his superb
physique he received devotion and at
tention. He was a perfect athlete and
would have made an ideal football
player of to-day.
"Samson was also a man of Intellect
and wit and was fond of practical Jok
ing. But one of these Jokes led ulti
mately to disaster. We recently heard
of a case of hazing In a college that led
to a charge of murder.
"True social life is a necessity and it
should be one of the greatest pleasures
of mankind.
"A Social Success" was the topic of
the sermon delivered last evening by
Rev. F. M. Larkin, pastor of Grace
Methodist. Church. Twenty-first and
I Capp streets, before a large congrega
tion.
The sermon was one of a - series en
titled "Successful Men" and the ad
dresses are attracting considerable at
tention.
. In dwelling on the topic "A Social
Success," Rev. Mr. Larkin said that
many dangers beset those who are
striving for social recognition. "We do
not belong, ' he said, "to that social set
whose social success Is reported in the
daily press. We are not interested In
the Newport set, which entertains a
monkey at. Its dinner tables and bows
to the simian as the distinguished vis
itor of the function.
"Many men are successful in business
and also in social life and that social
life Is the one In which he finds pleas
ure and the enjoyment of Intellectual
desires.' -
"Social success is a dangerous road
because of the probability of social ex
cess. Many people frown on social life,
and perhaps rightly, wnen It Is carried
to excess. At one time social excess
was a custom and the only pleasure
was meditation and prayer. The latter
was a reaction against the excess.
' "In the days of Rome the excesses of
the Romans were so great that the
Christians turned against those prac
tices by prayer. The Romans strove for
social success as well as military pres
tige and the former was their undoing.

NEW YORK. Nov. 22. -As a result
of the combined movement of the
County Medical Society and Health
Commissioner Lederle, Dr. Francis
Gray Blinn was arrested to-day at his
sanitarium, charged with attempting to
perform an illegal operation. -
Rev. Logan held that instead of one
candidate on each party ticket where
one is to be elected, there should be
ten, or even twenty, of the best men
available on each ticket. This, he said,
would give' a larger number to select
from and would Insure a truer expres
sion of the wishes of the people.
The formation of clubs for Instruc
tion on political questions was advo
cated by the lecturer. He closed by
saying that we pray "thy kingdom
come," and we look for the time when
the kingdoms of .this world shall be
come the kingdoms of God. He asked
his congregation to vote as It prayed,
for every vote for righteousness was a
vote for the kingdom of God.
The Rev. Mr. Logan announced that
next Sunday night his subject will be
"Christian Science."
The lecturer then Went on to speak
of some of the elements that enter into
the make-up of a "good citizen." The
first element was conscience, said Rev.
Logan, and in this respect he drew at
tention to the necessity of every man
voting and voting on the side of right
ousness. If a man was a true Chris
tian he must necessarily be a good cit
izen, for that included honesty and in
dustry and activity in every good work.
VOTING BLINDLY A CRIME.
He spoke of the criminality of citi
zens neglecting to vote or voting blind
ly for men and measures. Since the
late municipal election, he said, he had
been doing a lot of hard thinking.
When the time came to vote many
were called upon to support men and
measures of which they knew very lit
tle. Owing to the Influence of political
bosses and political machines, he said,
who usually named the candidates for
office, the voters had, after all, very
little to say as to the selection of the
men elected.
j Rev. Mr. Logan" began ; by showing
the attitude which the pulpit should
j assume toward political and. social
questions. God, he said, dealt with
men: not only as individuals, but as
nations. The old prophets/ he said,
were not. only preachers but '.were
statesmen as well and they vigorously
(and relentlessly attacked the national
evils of their time. He felt that It was
little use trying to reform- the indi
vidual so long as the social- conditions
were such that temptation met him at
j every step of his life. â-
He believed In reform. He believed
that the people by banding themselves
i together for good and pure civic govern
i ment could gain their desire, and a"s an
illustration. Rev. Mr. Logan said that
New York was a better governed city
to-day because ten years ago the lead-
Ing preachers of that metropolis united'
with the best men and overthrew Tam
many Hall, the most powerful and
most corrupt political machine, he said,
that had ever existed In this fair land.
TAMMANY HALL REFORMED.
The Sabbath in New York became a
day of. rest;" all saloons as well as every
other place of business closed Saturday
night at 12 o'clock and remained closed
until Monday morning, the ' speaker
said. Even Tammany Hall itself had
been reformed, at least outwardly, and
that he considered was an achievement.
Why, he asked, did. they speak of the
"Responsibilities of American citizen
ship" rather than "Citizenship in gen
eral?" In this respect, he pointed out
that in Russia the Czar was the abso
lute law maker and his people had no I
voice in the government-of the country,
hence they had littje or no responsibil
ity. Here in America every citizen.
In theory at least, he said, had an equal
voice in the government of the country
and in the making of the laws by
which he himself' is governed.

lectures delivered by the Rev. R. Logan

near of Sanchez and Twenty-third
streets, last night/ '? Â¦..

It is suggested that it is doubtful if
there will be a quorum Tuesday, and
that if the point of no quorum should
be raised it would be impossible to act
on a concurrent resolution providing
for an adjournment even should one
be brought over from the Senate. Some
of the House leaders have expressed
themselves in opposition to an adjourn
ment before the Cuban bill shall have
been disposed of, but what might be
the result of a conference between the
leaders of the Senate and House oh
this position remains to be seen. It Is
possible that the Speaker may be
ready to announce the committee as
signments by the end of the week. If
this is done the House will be fully
organized and prepared at the opening
of the regular session next month to
proceed to business. Members of both
Bides of the House are mindful of the
convention to be held next year and
the desire will be generally to rush the
work as fast as possible In order that
the regular session may be brought to
a close as early as possible.
HOPE FOR AN AGREEMENT.
The House will meet Tuesday. That
body having disposed of the Cuban bill.
It has no business before It, and un
less an agreement Is effected by which
the called session is to be brought to
an early close an adjournment proba
bly will be taken until Friday, and then
an adjournment until Monday or Tues
day.
The committees announcement is like
ly to be made the occasion for a speech
by Senator Morgan, which is anticipat
ed with considerable interest. In the
make-up of the committees the Ala
bama Senator will be displaced as
chairman of the Committee on Isth
mian Canals. He has been chairman of
that committee since its organization
and has been identified with it ever
Bince he entered the Senate. It is un
derstood that he will review to some
extent his connection with the impor
tant work and that in doing so he will
sharply criticize those who fail to agree
with him in advocacy of the Nicaragua
route.
In addition to receiving the report
on the Cuban bill the Senate probably
will make a reassignment of Senators
to committees to-morrow.
After being reported to-morrow the
Cubali bill will lie on the table for a
day unless there is unanimous con
sent that its consideration shall begin
immediately. When it is taken up Sen
ator Cullom will make a brief speech
in explanation of Its merits and after
he concludes there probably will be no
more addressses by friends of the bill
until toward the close of the discus
sion. In the meantime the Colorado,
Louisiana, Texas and Florida Senators
and probably some others will make
speeches Intended to show that the en
actment of the bill into law will be In
jurious to the sugar interests of the
United States and contrary to the best
policy.
CULLOM WILL SPEAK.
i SENATE WANTS TO ADJOURN.
The understanding in the Senate is
that a day for taking a vote on the Cu
[ ban bin will be fixed without regard
to the adjournment of the extra ses
sion. The bill will then be reported by
Senator Cullom and he will ask that a
day be fixed for the vote, whereupon
December 16 will be named if the pres
ent plan is carried out. When the Re
publican Senators secure this agree
ment they will be comparatively indif
ferent as to whether the Senate re
mains in session or not. They think
it preferable that the extra session
should come to a close, as many Sena
tors desire to visit their homes before
the regular session begins, but if an
adjournment is not had there will be
a general agreement among Senators
which will render it unnecessary for a
majority to remain in Washington. If
any considerable number of Senators
desire to meet for the purpose of mak- Â¦
ing and listening to speeches on the \
Cuban bill they will be allowed that i
privilege, with the understanding that
no other business shall be taken up.
If there are no speeches to be made the
Senate will take frequent adjourn
ments for three days at a time, as per
mitted by the constitution, without ref
erence to what the House may do.
There are a number of Senators who
desire to discuss the Cuban bill, but it
is probable that most of them will
postpone their speeches until after the
beginning of the regular session, De
cember 7.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â The Sen
ate will begin the week in a state of
uncertainty as to whether a final ad
journment of the extra session will be
secured during the Week or the reg
ular daily sessions continued. A ma
jority of the Senators are anxious to
bring the session to a close and to this
end an agreement has practically been
entered into for a vote on December
16 on the Cuban bill. The acquies
cence of the House of Representatives
in the programme, however, has not
been secured and until the two houses
reach an agreement no definite an
nouncement can be made. Leading
Senators on the whole are rather con
fident that an adjournment will be
brought about and say it will be im
possible to hold a quorum of either
body after Thanksgiving. The present
understanding is that a proposition to
set a day for adjournment will be made
by the Senate on Monday or Tuesday,
whereupon it will be formally conveyed
to the House. This will form a basis
for negotiations, as thus far there has
been no conference between members
of the House on the adjournment ques
tion.
LONDON, Nov. 23.â .According to the

The contracts let by the Alameda Land Com
jiany this year have exceeded those of any of
the fifteen years preceding.
There fs not a city to-day In America that
offers the exceptionally fine Inducements for
homeeeekers that Alameda does. The one thing
noticeable In Alameda to-day is the style and
character of the homes built, the fine school
accommodations, the beautiful avenues and
streets that compare favorably with any In the
world, and the delightful, balmy. Invigorating
air that Alameda is noted for tend to advance
realty conditions in Alameda. From a resi
dence standpoint there is no place Its equal
from a speculative one. It gives every promise
cf fulfilling the expectations and most sanguine
hopes cf tnose already Interested, and from the
frteady and Increasing demand for realty and
the determined tone of her people Alameda Is
destined to grow and blossom year by year
until the la properly and Justly recognized as
the equal If not the superior city for Investment
and homes in California.
Alameda Land Company, Alameda â Speaking
of the condition of the realty market in Ala
meda. the Alameda Land Company was never
more encouraged than at present. The steady
increase of property, the substantial character
of the homes now being erected, and the grow
ing and constant demand for homes give every
promise to the investor and assure the specu
lator a lucrative field for Investment. The nat
ural advantages of Alameda place It ahead of
any city of Its size In California; the fact that
million.-? of dollars will soon be spent In mak
ing the marsh lands habitable, and additional
appropriations granted for extension of streets
and parks enthuss us to a marked extent. - Ala
meda being the nearest and most direct point
to San Francisco, makes It an Ideal residence
city for thos*; occupied in business in San
Francisco, and from the beautiful mansions
built hÂ«re during the last few years Alameda
can rank as one of the prettiest and beet ktnt
title* In the world. Other features that attract
and draw homeseekers to our city are the clean
liness and excellent condition of her streets
fine schools, car system and sewer system all
of which Is perfect, together with enjoying the
lowest death rate of any city of its size in the
Union. .
The prices of property have advanced 20 per
cent over the prices of last year, and yet there
is a great demand for home sites, and In fact
for property of all kinds. We have a continual
demand for houses to rent, but at present
there is not a house or cottage to be had In
this neighborhood.
On the whole the average condition of the
market is better than at this time last year.
We occupy a point of peculiar advantage.
The swelling tides of growth of three cities â
Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco â hero
meet. That they will bring to us a flood of
prosperity seems certain.
H. A. Pleitner, Fruitvale â The market dur
ing the months of September and October was
unusually active, and during November, al
though the heavy rains have interfered some
what with business, the conditions on the
whole are better than they were at this time
laet year.
H. D. Irwin. Lorin â Prospects are bright for
realty in Lorin and vicinity, comprising the
southern end of Berkeley, the northern part of
Oakland and extending to the beautiful Clare
mont district at the Late of the hills. For sev
eral years back the growth of this section has
been unsurpassed by any locality around the
bay. Factors materially contributing to this
growth have been our excellent transportation
facilities and the low price of land. More
actual va'.ue for the money is to be obtained
here than can be had elsewhere.
The new ferry, reducing the time between
here and San Francisco to thirty minutes' and
adding greatly to the facilities for travel,
should unquestionably augment this growth.
We are now as convenient to the business
heart of San Francisco as a large portion of
the residence section of that city.
Our accessibility, combined with the high
rents obtaining, njust add many to our popula
tion. It ie a fact that by paying a few hun
dred dollars In cash and a monthly installment
equal to their present rent, dwellers In flats
and apartment houses in San Francisco can ob
tain and in a few years twice pay for a home
here, vastly plea*anter in itself and its sur
roundings than they are now occupying. These
conditions appeal especially to parents with
growing children. This is a children's para
dise and those brought here puny and sick
from the Kreat city in a few months' time are
well and robust.
times came in lS'Xi. The growth of Berkeley
depends primarily upon the growth of the uni
versity, and. like that institution, the town'haa
doubled in sUe in the last two. years., Thjs. of
course, has given a tremeridous Impetus to the
eale of home places, to say nothing of the spec
ulative transactions which always come in con
nection with an Influx of population in "this
way. Berkeley has come to be- reccicnUed,
however, as being the very best and choicest
place to live in on the eastern bay shore,- and
that in Itself has been enough to keep the real
estate men budy. We, tor our own part, have
never before done so large a business as we
have during the last six months. It may be,
as some people would have us believe,, that we
are going to have a break In the prosperity
that we am now enjoying, but the feeling In
Berkeley is that even If depression should
strike jjther places, Berkeley would hold its
own long after the market was gone from other
towns. It was so daring the last panic, and
there is every reason to suppose that It will be
so again. Me did not really feel the pinch here
for several years after the real trouble began
elsewhere. So sure are we that there Is going
to be. no falling away In the bulk of business
dene that we are bonding up on long time con
tracts all the property that we can possibly get
hold of. with the idea that we will .need It
when the movement begins In the spring.
ChenÂ»y & Berry, Berkeleyâ The real estate
business la Berkeley has beÂ«-n larger and better
during the last year than in any year of 'the
five that preceded It. It is fully as good a
market as that which existed before the" hard
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 22. â¢
The realty market during the last
week has been active and steady, with
a slight upward tendency in prices.
Suburban residence lots are in demand
and sales are numerous. This condi
tion is also true of East Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda. â¢: . .
While there is considerable, inquiry
for building sites in the. business cen
ter, there are few. good offerings, as
owners of business property are not
anxious to sell, as the impression pre
vails that advances in the price . of
business property can be relied upon.
The demand for stores to rent can*
not be supplied at present and it seems
as if the business of this city is rapid :
\y outgrowing its accommodations.

prominent real estate dealers: -

A large number of visitors crossed

like a trojan, and the visitors marveled
at his strength and speed. Gardner
went twelve rounds on the bag. without
a let-up, and then took on Greggains

some of his love taps. Greggains could

Bob Fitzsimmons is suffering from a

ed out before an immense crowd at
Croll's yesterday and pleased every one
by his speed and punching powers. It
was between waits ana in Ris retir
ing room that the initiated discovered
Fitz was no,t at his best. His breath
ing was labored and he complained of
a stiffness in the cords of his neck.
Fitz was not as badly, off, however,
as he tried to make it appear. He likes
to have his opponent believe he is suf
fering from all the ills man is heir to.
There Is no mistake about his cold. He
complains at all times and coughs a
great deal. He hopes to be rid of it
by Wednesday evening, and if good
care will relieve him of the attack he
will be himself again.
Mrs. Fitzsimmons kept time for her
athletic husband while he administered
terrific wallops on the bag. He ham

fifteen minutes, taking a half minute

the heavy punches Kennedy let fly at
him. Some of the blows sent in Â¦ by
the 220-pound boxer must have hurt,
but Bob never showed distress nor ill
feeling. It was remarked by friends of
Jeffries and Corbett.that if Kennedy
had landed with such frequency and
force ' on either of those boxers they
would have lost . their tempers and
would have punished their sparring
partner. Fitz's footwork was as de
ceiving as ever. He was unable to get
out of the way of some of Kennedy's
rushes and he would duck into a clinch
or ta'.ce the blows on his shoulders or

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22.â Portland
dropped the last game of the season
on the local grounds to the Angels to
day by the score of 3 to 2, notwith-
Ftanding the fact that Newton pitched
for them. Oscar Jones was in the box
for Los Angeles, and, barring a spell
of wildness in the second and third in
nings, pitched up to his Brooklyn form.
Not a hit was made off his delivery
until the eighth, when the northerners
pathered two singles, which, however,
did not count in the run getting. Jones'
wildneis was responsible for the first
run made by Portland and errors by
DiP.in and Smith let another man
across the plate. Newton pitched fine
b-ill and had he been given perfect sup
port the score would have been 2 to l
in favor of Portland. The big crowd
had great eport in urging Newton to
strike out his team mates. Score:
cumb to the Angels.

He fared a little better, for during the
remainder of the game the Cripples
landed only two more tallies. Graham
had the men from the frozen north un

the fourth Mr. Byere lifted a torrid one
cut over the center field fence. It was
a peach, but no one happened to be on
the bags, so one run was the limit for
this magnificent swat.
The crowd kept after poor Rube all
the time, and each man in attendance
vowed that be was the worst umpire
that ever trod upon a ball field. Some
fast work was done by the infielders on
both sides. Luxnley made the best
showing with the bat since his arrival

It looked more like a funeral than a
ball game when the few lonely fans
gathered on the bleachers to witness
the first ball game that has been seen
for a week. Considering the way the
field looked, it was not so bad, though
the crowd did not seem to think much
of it. being content to pass out a few
words to Mr. Levy.
Mr. St. Vrain and his left mitt did
not have the power to stop the runs of
the CrirplÂ«s In the flrst two innings.
He was wild and he was ineffective.
Then he could not possibly line the ball
true to the first baseman whenever it
became his lot to field. On top of all
this he became rattled, . so it became
necessary to trot out Mr. Sample in the
third inning.

A large number of marksmen visited
the Shell Mound Park rifle range yes
terday. Captain L. Slebe held the clos
ing ceremonies for the season of 1903,
and gave a turkey shoot, which was
taken advantage- of, by marksmen to
provide their Thanksgiving table* with
the toothsome bird.
The weather during the early morn-
Ing hours was thick and foggy, and It
was with difficulty the riflemen could
distinguish the bullseyes. Later in the
afternoon the driving mists again ob
scured the targets, but the riflemen
were patient and awaited their oppor
tunity of placing a telling shot.
The day's events opened with the
turkey shoot. When Philo. Jacoby, the
veteran champion, placed the first bird
to his credit he was greeted with cheers
by all the old-timers. Â»

The match between the Thistle and
the Oakland Hornet association football
elevens yesterday afternoon at Idora
Park, Oakland, proved somewhat dis
appointing.
The game being played on the home
ground of the Hornets, it devolved upon
them to see that the ground was in
good order and the lines marked. This
not having been done, Referee C. W.
Irish declared the match forfeited to
the â¢ Thistles. A crowd of spectators
being on hand in expectation of wit
nessing an exciting contest, the teams
went on and played the match. The
Thistles had nearly all the best of the
play, their combination work and pass
ing, being much better than that of the
Hornets despite the good individual
play of Chambers, A. Hunter. Shand
and Connolly. The ground was in bad
condition,* heing .heavy, slippery and
muddy.
The only goal scored by the Hornets
was made from a scrimmage three
minutes after the kick-off, but the
Thistles equalized the score before the
end of the first half. The Hornet goal
was constantly in danger, but Goal
keeper Williamson proved an excellent
man in his place. In the second half,
after ends had been changed, the play
was sluggish, but the Thistles added
one more goal to their score, so that
the match' ended Thistles" two goals.
Hornets one goal. The Thistle forwards
play#d an excellent game and made re
peated attacks on their opponents' goal.
The linesmen were L. R. Glllchrest and
T. Hunter. The Hornets' team was
weakened by the absence of Lackie
and Pomeroy and by an injury received
by Erskine early In the game. The
teams lined up as follows: Â¦
Hornets. Positions. Thistles.

R. Long's greyhound Mount Rose, the
brindle son of Royal Flush and Craw
ford Lass, won the stake at Ingleside
Coursing Park yesterday in clever fash-
Ion. He first beat Viking after an un
decided. He then retired Comlque and
Our Motto to their kennels. In the
next round Homer Boy was withdrawn
after a hard course, giving Mount Rose
a bve.
In the semi-final he, also ran a bye
course, putting him In the final. In this
he met Sofala, which was made a 3 to
6 choice. Mount Rose led and finally
won by a score of 15 to 10. The hare
released in the deciding course es
caped. This was the %ixth time he was
used and he showed his knowledge of
the field by making his way to the
nearest escaoe.
A heavy fosr hung over the field
throughout the day, ooscuring the de

Best Match of the Day Develops Dar
ing Meeting of Two Men of

The Golden Gate Tennis Club mem
bers started their class singles tourna
ment for first and fourth class players
yesterday on the courts In Golden Gat Â»
Park. The rain which set In early In
the afternoon put a stop to the play
when it had only fairly started. A large
number of players were entered, but
the inclement weather caused a number
of defaults to be recorded.
The matches played were as a rule
uninteresting. Many were won by
scores of C-0. 6-2 and 6-1. Only two
matches were played in the first class,
while in the fourth class play was com
pleted through most of the first round
Robert X. Whitney and George K

day. Bates was outclassed in the first
set. but In the second he pulled him
self together and made a good show-
Ing. Whitney only taking the set by
a 9-7 score. The other first class match
was won bv Win Allen. He had for
an opponent J. A. Code and won with
out an effort. ; ; A *
Two Interesting matches were played
in the fourth class. The best was be
tween W. L. Howell and M. Edwards.
Though the former -won. it was only
after the final set had run to 10-8. The
first set went to Howell, 6-2, and the
second to Edwards, 6-1.
The match between T. A. Allen and
F. Wolfsohri was the only other one
that reauired the playing of the full
three sets. Allen proved the winner by
a score of 6-1, 2-6, 6-4.

William B. Collier made his reappear
ance at the California Club courts yes
terday after an absence of several
weeks, and proved the star performer
of the day. He first took on and de
feated Frank S. Mitchell In a one-set
match. He then disposed of J. D. Mac-
Gavin in two straight sets. MacGavin's
service bothered the veteran consider
ably, but Collier's all around work was
too murh for him.
In one of the best practice matches
seen in many weeks. Frank Mitchell
and W. B. Collier won from Joseph S.
Tobin and Frank D. Strlnsham in two
out o: three sets. The former team
threatened to make a runaway match
of it in the first set. which they took.
6-2. The second set developed a great
improvement in Tobln and Stringham's
game and they- annexed the set in clev
er fashiqn by a score of 6-3. The third
and final set went to Collier and Mitch

What" the "State Board has accom
plished I may be briefly summarized as
follows: 'â¢Â¦Â¦:Â¦ Â¦Â¦'Â¦ > 'Â¦'-'Â¦
The State Board of Trade has never
thought, nor does it now think, that the
highes^function is to stimulate a large
movement of people into the : State,
without reference; to their condition,
unless; intelligent direction is given
newcomers after r they are here, .that
they may in selecting future homes do
so with judgment and .wisdom 1 and be
come contented and' prosperous citizens.
In % this direction the State' Board
stands alone-^so far as the central and
northern parts of the State are con
cerned. Bare statistics do not give all
the information-required by the home
seeker; statistics are valuable and

The fact that Leslie's Weekly re
cently published a California number
is one of the signs of the Interest taken
in this State. Included in the matter
concerning California that was pub

clever article by Hamilton Wright, who
is connected with the California Pro

Looking at the State from an indus

equal 20.000.000 barrels. In 1902 Cali

DIVERSITY AND YIELD.
THE spirit of co-operation
is held by Arthur R. Briggs
to be potential in accom
plishing the best results for
California, and this, opinion is
based upon the experience of the
State Board of Trade, which* was
organized in 1887 end has been
actively concerned for a long pe
riod in the work of attracting
attention and inducing settlers
who are desirable to come to this
State.
San Francisco has been the cen
tral rallying point for the country
north of Tchachapi and the inte
rior has constantly maintained its
interest in that which was devised
for its betterment. The use of
printers' ink had been resorted to
liberally to tell the world what
advantages of soil and climate
California has. Statistical and
other reports on special topics,
such as the State Board of Trade
have issued copiously, have fur
nished exact information.
Frank Wiggins, secretary" of
the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce, details the ways that
have been adopted to build up the
great country south of Tehach
api and gives a brief history of
the Los Angeles organization.
The recapitulation of the various
attractions that have been found
feasible to draw the favorable
comment of visitors is especially
interesting. In addition to the
encouragement of immigration to
the southern counties, the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce
was largely instrumental in secur
ing the construction of the break
water at San . Pedro, which in
volved getting an appropriation of
$3,000,000 in the face of the deter
mined opposition of a great rail
road corporation.
The points of contact that the
California Promotion â¢Committee
of San Francisco has with the
world are very well outlined in a
report that Rufus P. Jennings* the
executive officer of the committee,
has made to his associates. The
Promotion Committee is younger
in years of service than either the
State Board of Trade or the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
The scope of its work is broad.
The Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce has had charge of the entertain
ment of many notable people and so
cieties during the fifteen years of its
existence. The National Educational
Association met in Los Angeles under
the management of the Chamber of
Commerce.
Other notable meetings that have
been promoted by the chamber have
been the International Irrigation Con
gress of 1893, the National Editorial As
sociation of 300 newspaper editors,' the
Senate Committee on Commerce and on
Arid Land, the Brotherhood of Railroad
Firemen, the Boston Fruit Dealers, the
New England Grocers, the American
Pomologlcal Society, the American In
stitute of Mining Engineering and
many others.
The most notable achievement of the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
was the securing of the construction of
a | breakwater at San Pedro, to cost
nearly $3,000,000, in the face of the most
determined 'opposition on the part of a
great railroad corporation and Its
friends. â¢
The management of the affairs of the
chamber is vested In a board "of direc
tors, a body of twenty. - Four members
are chosen as officers by ballot of the
.members. These are the president, two
vice presidents and the treasurer.
Eleven are chosen by the members by
ballot as chairmen of standing commit
tees. ' ' \_ ;
The board of directors meets regular

Of the chamber, five members constitut

falls below ten and frequently runs
from fifteen to the entire board. No
fee Is allowed for attendance at the
meetings, nor is there any fine for ab
sence, but on the bulletin board each
director's attendance is : recorded.

Besides maintaining a permanent ex
hibit of California products in its own
quarters, which has been visited by
over a million people; the chamber has
had charge of and participated in four
local citrus fairs. The orange carnival
In Chicago was visited by 100,000 peo
ple. Regular shipments of fruit were
made to "California on Wheels," a
traveling exhibit visited by a million
people. The Southern California ex
hibit in the World's Columbian Exposi
tion was admitted to be one of the fin
est state exhibits there, and was visited
by an immense number of people.
A fine Southern California display
was made in an artistic building at the
Midwinter Fair in "San Francsco. A
permanent exhibit was maintained in
Chicago for two years which was visit
ed by half a million people. A most
successful display of pr^flucts was
made by the Chamber of Commerce at
the Pan American Exposition, in Buf
falo, in 1901, the . secretary of the
chamber remaining in Buffalo during
the entire period of the exposition.
Other exhibits have been made by
the Chamber of Commerce at Hamburg,
at Guatemala, at Atlanta, at Omaha,
at the World's Fair In Paris and at
many other places.
The chamber maintains a permanent
exhibit in the Board of Trade rooms in
San Francisco.

pamphlets descriptive of this section
and its resources, with a total circula

PROMOTES EXHIBITIONS. -
By Secretary Frank Wiggins.
In addition to the publication's pre
pared by the State board, which In
many Instances have come to be re
garded as standard authority on the
subjects treated, the publication de
partment has year by year procured
from the various counties a -vast
amount of printed matter, in the form
of maps, folders and pamphlets, which
have been distributed through various
channels to parties seeking information
in respect to the State.
This matter comes to the board with
the indorsement of the organization in
the county from which It emanates and
is therefore generally free from per
sonal interest
Much of this matter contains infor
mation of more than ordinary value
and tends to localize the mind of the
newcomer or homeseeker. With re
spect to the publications emanating di
rectly from the boaf ai ' those treating
RESOURCES ADVERTISED.
Under the need of the time for in
formation in respept to California and
the peculiar conditions then existing,
the organization was made in the year
1867 with the thought and confident
hope that the commonwealth could oa
benefited by patriotic effort in dissemi
nating carefully compiled information
In respect to the resources and possi
bilities of the State. At that period
the population had but barely reached
the million point and the general in
dustrial condition was anything but
satisfactory or immediately promising.
One of the prominent features intro
duced into the work" at its inception
was the spirit of co-operation between
th* 1 State Board and interior districts,
fcr It was well and wisely conceived
that the upbuilding of any part of the
State would indirectly, at least, benolit
the whole, and that development in the
grreat valleys and rural districts would
naturally stimulate commercial activ
ity in the cities. The work was there
fore organized with San Francisco as
the central point, with the various
county organizations actively enlisted
and working In harmony with the
movement. \>urlng all the years of Its
existence this feature has been main
tained and the spirit of co-operation
and mutual interest has been encour
aged.
From the first the State Board of
Trade took a prominent part In the
ccnslderatlon of all economic and com
mercial matters, particularly such as
were closely related to the development
of California, and there is abundant
evidence that the Influence of the board
waÂ«<Jelt and recognized.
In securing the kind of information
interesting to and sought by the home
seeker much care has always been ex
ercised and intimate relation with the
various commercial bodies . In the in
terior of the State was found advanta
gous and desirable.
No single agency engaged In the up
building of the State, in stimulating
Industrial growth, and thereby adding
to her wealth and influence, and in en
couraging immigration has been more
conspicuous during the last fifteen
years than the State Board of Trade.
No history of California that does not
make prominent mention of the work
of this organization would be complete
or do Justice to the men who have dur
ing the period of its existence given
time, thought and patient labor in the
conscientious effort to do something
practical for the State. To those who
have known the influence of tha or
ganization and the work it has done
and have been contributors to it, any
published record at this time of what
it has accomplished may seem almost
a waste of time. And yet I am asked
to tell, in a brief way, what the State
Board of Trade has done and what it
has accomplished.
MOTIVE FOR ACTION.
By Manager Arthur R. Briggs.
No one can form anything like a cor
rect estimate of the wonderful resour
ces and marvelous ; productiveness of
the State without seeing and investi
gating for himself. The exhibits which
have â¢ been - maintained by - the board
during the period of its existence, since
18S8, are object lessons which unfold 'to
ILLUSTRATES PRODUCTS.
These exhibits have been collected,
prepared and maintained at great cost
and infinite care and patience. They
have been visited by hundreds of thou
sands of people, most of them from out
side the State, during .the last ten
years. Interest in them appears to In
crease rather than diminish. ' The.ex
hibit room has been visited by at least
10,000 persons, on an average,' each
month since January 1st of this year.
In this department there is provided a
reading room, where,' in' addition to the
printed matter kept for distribution,
there Is a library of scrap books rela
ting specifically to counties "and indus
tries, with one book for each county
and each industry. This is a feature
of much Interest to" visitors 'and "gives
the kind of information that can be ob-'
tained from â¢ no other source.
A feature of the State Board work
which, it seems to me, has been under
valued, is the ' permanent exhibit it
maintains of our varied products. The
State Board of Trade in this city and
the Chamber of Commerce In Los An
geles have procured and permanently
maintained, year by year, the most
comprehensive exhibits of the agricul
tural, horticultural and vltlcultural,
with a moderate exhibit of lumber,
minerals and manufactured ' products,
that have ever been known. . ;.
These reports give the most intelli
gent information obtainableâ in fact,
the only reliable information by which
comparisons of districts may be made
and the development noted.
Much thought has been given in the
preparation of pamphlets and reports
to the importance of extending the
markets for our products. To encour
age the planting of trees and vines
without giving due heed to the distri
bution of the products would manifest
ly have been short sighted, hence the
.market feature has been always kept
prominently in view in considering the
fruit industry of the State.
The principle on which the board has
worked is that any Instrumentality
which bring3 us nearer to the centers
of a large population and consumption
of products, or to the large distributing
commercial centers, would promote
growth in the varied Industries and
contribute to the prosperity of the
State. In this particular channel the
State board of Trade has been a potent
factor in State development.
A PERMANENT EXHIBIT.
The noteworthy features of the sta
tistics of the board, which aro revised
and kept up year by year, which ex
hibit the steady development of this
Industry, are the shipments of green
fruit, dried fruit and canned fruits;
the production and distribution of rais
ins, of wine and brandy, of prunes, figs,
olives, of olive oils,' etc., and of citrus
fruits. ,
of the fruit interest of the State have,
it is believed, done more to stimulate
development and to demonstrate In
times of depression the fallacy of the
claim of overproduction than all other
agencies combined.
The annual reports of -the State
Board of Trade have become an au
thority on the fruit interests of the
State and are widely sought for
throughout the United States and in
foreign countries. The pamphlets is
sued on the fig, the olive and particu
larly on citrus fruit growing in the cen
tral and northern portions of the State,
have had wide distribution with ex
cellent results. . /
. The.. foundation of the Los Angeles
Chamber , of | Commerce was laid at a
meeting j held on^ October 11, 1888, at
tended by twenty prominent citizens of
Los Angeles. In January the chamber
will move into, its handsome new build
ing on Broadway, jyhich it owns. It is
a six-story blinding,' 135x179 feet In di
mensions, the -second and third ': floors

its kind in the country. The main and
gallery floors cover an area of about
20,000 square feet, j

California, especially fruits, dried, can

The Chamber of Commerce is a busi
ness institution that devotes its ener
gies largely to the work of local devel
opment. It has no trading features,
nor does it concern itself in any way
with the individual commercial inter
ests of its members. The activity of
the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
extends over a wide field, as may be
seen from the following outline:
General business Interestsâ Questions
of trade and transportation; Inquiry
Into new commercial opportunities.'

needed; effects of tariff changes; in

The Los Angeles Chamber of Com

great showing for a city of 133,000 pop
ulation. The nearest approach to the
record of the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce is made by Cleveland, which
recently reported 1500 members in a
population of 400,000. Almost every
class, profession and line of business
is represented in the list of members
of the Los Angeles Chamber .of Com

VIEWS OF THE EXHIBITION HALLS AND HEADQUARTERS iWAINTAINED TO FOSTER INTERESTS IN CALIFORNIA.
Many kind words have reached the
office of The Call relative to the new
departure which this paper has made,
showing that its purpose is fully under
stood and indorsed by the leading citi
zens of many sections of California.
This is certainly gratifying.
A series of signed articles by authori
ties in the leading lines of California
industry will now appear. In these will
be ' recounted what has been done and
what may reasonably be hoped for.
The result will he to give a panoramic
review of the advance of the State's
industries, the portrayal being made
with considerable attention to detail.
As the articles will be written by ac
knowledged authorities a fund of in
formation will be supplied that can be
reached in no other way.
MOVE IS APPRECIATED.
How the larger organizations, like thÂ«
Ftate Board cf Trade, the Los Angeles
Chamber cf Commerce and the Califor
nia Promotion Committee, work for the
public good is a theme of such general
interest that no apology is needed for
allotting to them extendd mention.
The Call desires to hear from organ
izations throughout the interior and
from all parts of the coast counties re
garding the means they are adopting
or have tried to help their localities
and what measure of success they have
achieved. This public comparison of
notes must be of common advantage, to
advance which is the purpose of The
Call. Presidents of" chambers of com
merce and of bt>ards of trade in the
larger and the smaller cities; also the
bodies of wide scope that represent in
their membership and aims the hopes
of many counties, are invited to con
tribute, in behalf of their own people
and also for the benefit of the entire
State, signed article?, not to exceed In
length 1500 words each, that shall in
struct not only the stranger within our
pates, but also the world at large.
Nothing more need bo said on this
score, except that the latch string is
out to the State.
Boards of tradt? and chambers ot
commerce have ably seconded their ef
forts. The rcsuit has been that, with
the aid of the three favorably situated
bodies, of which some account is given
to-day, the entire State has advanced
in population and developmnt of it3 re
sources.
EFFOETS SECONDED.
How they accomplish their work is
told by Arthur II. Brings, manager of
the California ?tate Boar<* of Trade,

for a Fign.-i article about the work cf

With the instructive statements made
by the officials connected with the or
ganizations that are named, pictures
are published illustrating the head
quarters maintained. In selecting these
three bodies for primary exploitation,
the large and influential todies of the
interior havÂ«e not been overlooked. The
work of the associations that represent
the Sarrcmcnto and San Joaquin val
leys and th? coast counties has been
crowned with success.
Considerable space is devoted this
morning: relative to the methods em
ployed by three great agencies for the
dissemination of information about
California and to the increase of her
prosperity.
These are the California State Board
of Trade, the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce and the California Promo
lion Committee of San Francisco.
MILLION VISITORS.
The seventh big register of the
Chamber of Commerce has Just been
filled and a new one of equal size sub
stituted. These big volumes contain
4000 pages and weigh 400 pounds each,
and there Is room in each of them for
100.000 names. As a number of names
were Inscribed In smaller registers in
the early days of the chamber this
shows that more than a million of peo
ple have visited the exhibit room of the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
since it was organized, and they have
come from all parts of the earth. Â»' \
A report of the proceedings of the or
ganization, together with the speeches
at the annual banquet, appears in a
pamphlet, published each year, for the
use of members, entitled "The Mem
bers' Annual."
The letters of inquiry received at the
Chamber of Commerce from all parts
of the country run from ten tc a hun
dred daily. More than 150.000 such let
ters have been answered by the cham
ber.
The Promotion Committe maintains
no exhibit, but. has very attractive of
fices on New Montgomery street, where
literature Is kept on hand relating to
California for distribution to the in
quiring public.
The committee has frequently coun
seled with organizations of citizens In
the interior concerning the promotion
of California's Interests. Recently a
meeting was held in this city, at which
the subject of co-operation was brought
to the front prominently. . Leading men
from the interior and from this city
were in attendance. This conference
was reported in full in The Call.
and developing the orange-growing in
dustry of Southern California, which
has now reached an aggregate of near
ly 30,000 cars annually, th3 Los An
geles Chamber of Commerce has been
specially active.
Several years ago a veteran San
Francisco man, who had Just returned
from an extensive tour through the
East, declared. In a public Interview,
that Los Anseles was the best adver
tised city on the globe, Chicago alone
excepted. That this is so Is largely due
to the activity of the Lo* Angeles
Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce holds an
annual banquet on Washington's birth
day, to which a few distinguished
guests who are not members of the
chamber are Invited. At the banquet
held last year 315 were present and let
ters of regret were read from a large
number of distinguished people all over
the country.
"Thirty-two thousand seven hundred
and fifty-six letters were received by
the committee for the twelve months
ending August 31, 1903, an average of
2723 per month; and 66,959 letters were
sent out during the same period, an
average of 5830 per month. During tf\Â»
twelve months the committe distributed
433.0ST pieces of literature, an average
of 36,030 pieces per month. Seven thou
sand six hundred and ninety-one vis
itors registered at headquarters up to
August 31, an average of 641 per
month."
A large correspondence has been
maintained. Mr. Jennings reports cov
ering this:
GKEAT CORRESPONDENCE.
"Commencing with September of last
year and extending over a period of
seme months advertisements were
placed in a number of the leading East
ern publications having an aggregate
circulation of about 12,000,000, with the
purpose of obtaining the names of
those who might be Induced to locate
in California. The result of this adver
tising plan proved very successful, and
the committee now has on file the
names of 56,316 persons who are Inter
ested in the State. The number is be
ing added to constantly. Many of these
have been or will be influenced to come
to California to live."
Arrangements have been made to
have the dally temperature of San
Francisco furnished to large Eastern
cities. The committee has also been en
gaged in the work of Inducing conven
tions to come to San Francisco. During
some months advertisements were pub
lished by the committee in Eastern
magazines. Concerning this Mr. Jen
nings reports:
Much literature has been distributed
that has been supplied by boards of
trade and improvement clubs relative
to various localities and industries in
this State. Articles Innumerable have
been prepared for the press and have
been published.
Rufus P. Jennings has made a report
to the California Promotion Committee
concerning the scope of its work. It
has arranged excursions throughout the
interior of the State which enabled ex
cursionists to see' the resources of the
country for themselves. It ha3 co-op
erated with the California fruit growers
to secure farm labor from the East.
Through its agency several bound pub
lications have been Issued for the pur
pose of advertising the State, which
have received liberal notices on the
part of the daily press.
An exhibit has been placed by the
committee in the Palace Hotel. Land
owners have been requested by the
committee to place some of their hold
ings on the market to enable settlers
to purchase small farms on easy terms.

SALINAS, Nov. 22.â When the hear
ing of the matter of admitting the will
of the late Mrs. Flora McKinley Duck
worth, who left an estate estimated to
be worth nearly $100,000, came up yes
terday afternoon before Judge. L. F.
Smith in the Santa Cruz County. Supe
rior Court, George P. Burke, counsel
for Ellen Rianda, a- sister, sprang a
surprise, which will probably lead to a
prolonged and interesting litigation.
S. J. Duckworth, husband of the de
cedent and at one time clerk of the
State Assembly, had petitioned for let
ters testamentary, and it was during
the hearing that the point was made.
In the will of the decedent, after devis
ing all the property to him, she directs
"that my husband shall see that there
be offered one- mass per week for the
repose of my soul," and then concludes
with the following declaration: "I de
clare to my husband it be my wish that
he leave all my property he may die
possessed of, by. a last will and testa
ment, for the establishment and main
tenance at my residence, Monterey,
Cal., of a home where poor aged women
may be supported free of charge, ac
cording as the funds at hand may war
rant, and hope that he will carry this
wish out faithfully."
After the husband had testified that
at the time the will was executed he
had promised his wife he, would carry
out all her wishes. Attorney Burke ar
gued from a decision of the United
States Supreme Court in the famous
Colton will case and other legal author
ities, that the provisions of the will
quoted were absolutely void, and there
being no one appointed by the will a
residuary legatee the property of the
deceased descended' in equal shares to
Mrs. Rianda and Duckworth. Although
the will dispenses with a bond, it was
insisted by Mrs. Rlanda'a attorney that
the executor should give sufficient
bond. A decision Is expected this week.

LONDON, Nov. 22.â The unexpected
ly brisk revival of business on the
Stock Exchange during the. past week
is attributed in large measure to the
revolution on the isthmus of Panama
and the recognition of the new republic,
as well as to the signing of the canal
treaty by the United States Secretary
of State and the Panamanian Minister
at Washington. It is believed that the
$40,000,000 appropriated for the purchase
of the canal territory will be temporar
ily employed In New York and will
ease the money market there. The re
vival in business has also been assisted
by the better outlook in South Africa,
based on the issuance of the blue book
containing the report of Henry Birch
enough, who was sent as a special com
missioner to inquire into the present
conditions and p^aspects of British
trade in that country, and who declared
that "the extent to which South Africa
has come to the front as a great mar
ket for the exploitation of British man
ufactures is almost startling."
The revival is further grounded on
the report of the South African Labor
Commission, which confirms the neces
sity of procuring labor abroad and
which is regarded Indirectly as favor
ing the introduction of Asiatic labor.
Altogether the chances of a general up
ward movement are considered as very
favorable.

women are now wearing. The peer's
wife wears a real diamond, and the
peasant, where there Js any peasantry

liteness a man might be tempted tc call
all. such decorations garbage. It has
never been so abundant as this year
What is said of London wotpÂ»ii' s Â«ham
finery does not apply to New York or

WITH the approaching celebration of the comple
tion of the Ogden-Lucin cut-off public attention
will be drawn to the improvements which have
been made in the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific rail
road system since it passed under the direction of President
Harriman. The promise made by Mr. Harriman in his
speech at the banquet given him by the merchants of San
Francisco shortly after he became president of the road will
be readily recalled and the celebration of the accomplished
work will serve to show how faithfully he is keeping to his
programme of improvement announced at that time.
It is estimated by experts that the completion of the cut
off will enable the railroad to reduce the time of travel on
the Overland Limited from San Francisco to Chicago by
fully seven hours. To furnish that advantage to the travel
ing public the company has expended, it is said, very nearly
$5,000,000. That would be a notable improvement in our
transportation system even if it stood alone, but it is but a
part of the great scheme of improvement undertaken on all
the lines controlled by the Harriman interests. In fact so
much has been accomplished in the way of improving the
roadbed and facilitating travel and traffic that the coming
celebration might well be made the occasion of a general
congratulation over, work done over the whole wide extent
A recent statement of the expenditures for improvements
of one kind or another on the various lines fixed the total
amount, for the three years ending on June 30 of this year
at $1 04,348,360. The amount includes for betterments, $46,
415.587; for changes of lines, $14,532,237, and for equipments,
$43,200,545. It is to be noted that while the figures cover
the expenditures for all the lines controlled by the Harriman
interests the proportionate expenditures for new equipment
on the Southern Pacific are far greater than on any of the
other lines. . *
â¢In the face of such a showing there will be no desire to
criticize the management and yet it is to be noted that the
road has failed to keep pace with the growing demands of
the industries and the commerce of the State. Perhaps no
better evidence can be given of our abounding prosperity
and of the rapidity with which we are advancing.

the musicians of San Francisco are sadly lacking in har

interpret the noblest harmonies ever conceived. Our critic,
we hope, meant solidarity, not harmony.

The quotation serves to help us understand the light in
which we are viewed by some at least of those whom we look
upon as under our protection and care. It is by no means
improbable, however, that the article was inspired either
directly or indirectly by, a European interest. All reports
from Southern Brazil, Argentina and Chile are to the effect
th.it those countries are being settled by European colonists,
who bid fair eventually to crowd out the Latin races and
take possession of every part of the continent that can be
profitably cultivated by white men. One authority estimates
that upward of 400,000 immigrants from Germany, Austria.
Hungary and Switzerland are already settled in what is called
"the empty continent." Moreover Europeans are not the
only colonists, for the Japanese are becoming numerous
throughout Argentina. >
It is to be noted that the Latin Americans do not object
to the immigration that is pouring into their country, for jx
is an immigration that brings money and helps to advance
the general prosperity. Consequently a sentiment is in pro
cess of formation that is distinctly hostile to the Monroe
doctrine and to American protection. The statement quoted
from the Buenos Ayres Herald may be an expression of that
sentiment and a forerunner of a steady drift of public opinion
in Argentina in favor of European colonization and Euro
pean alliances. At any rate it is evident the people of those
countries do not regard us with that affection and trust we
believe to be our due, and the time may come when we will
h:-ve to enforce the Monroe doctrine against their protests
and possibly against their open hostility.
A RECENT Teport from South America quotes the
Buenos Ayies Herald as saying: "Cuba is nominally
free, but. every man of common sense knows that.it is
but a question of time when that island will find its way into
the United States, and it requires no prophet nor son of a
prophet to see and foretell that Mexico and Central America
will share the same fate. The southern boundary of the
United States will be at least as far south as Panama and
this will come about at no great distance of time. The true
policy of the United States should be to confine its interest
now and for the future to that limit. South America is no
more within the logical sphere of influence of the United
States than Europe. The United States has no more inter
est here than any other power, and it is not wanted here for
the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine."

Now what are the amenities of football south of Tehachapi?
Do they include "biting, gouging, tearing out of hair and
deliberate striking?" v Thcre is a seemingly great difference
of opinion as to how the game should be conducted. Who
will classify a code so that pleasant relations may be resumed
in the southland and football be played to suit all who have
bodies and limbs to risk on the field?
FOOTBALL is a rough game. Weaklings will not in
dulge in it. The valorous, the stout of limb and strong
in lung turn to it with the same passionate devotion
that inspired pi old the contestants in the Olympian games.
Some bones are broken, many hopes are dashed, many hearts
elated as the surging and tumultuous elevens battle between
the goals. These are customary incidents.
But however fiercely this game of men may . have raged
north of Tehachapi, when the "rooters," looking on in criti
cal moments with bated breath, were in mood to forgive any
sort of tactics to bring victory to Berkeley's or to Stanford's
floating colors, the football players of the southland below
Tehachapi would seem to have "gone the limit" in hard play
ing. Indeed so strenuously has football been carried on in
Southern California that the newspapers iti that part of the
State are excited.
The Los Angeles Times remarks concerning a recent con
test between the University of Southern California and the
Sherman Institute elevens: Â¦ ~v Â»f
"It has now come to such a pass that the public in going
to a game participated in by U. S. C. actually expects to sec
a slugging match, in which civilized football is made to give
way before the barbaric tactics of biting, . gouging*" tearing
out of hair and deliberate striking. In yesterday's game cer
tain of the U. S. C. players conducted themselves in a fash
ion that may be quite the thing among the Dyak headhunt
ters of the island of Borneo, but isquite out of 'place in a
game which is supposed to.be played by gentlemen and is
often watched by ladies."
The Pomona Progress reads a similar lesson in ethics on
the occasion: "If the University of Southern California is
not going to stand in the eyes of the public for the cultiva
tion of brutality in young men instead of manly courage and
honor it is high time for her to give some expression of dis
approval of the disgraceful tactics of her athletic association
and exercise her authority, to put a stop to such tactics in
the future. For several years U. S.C.'s tactics in athletics
have been a subject of such bitter complaint on the part of
her sister colleges that Pomona College finally resolved not

What are you going to do with a
woman like that to live with every day
Something of this kind I said to Ella
and that to ask a man so much semed
to me like an indignity. She replied:
"How funny you are! Why should' he
object to telling me If he Isn't going
where he is ashamed to have it known?
Am I not his wife and entitled to know
all he does?"
Think cf a Belf-respecting, able
bodied and minded man being subject
ed to that every time he goes out of
the house. Could you bear It, oh, Bis
ter woman, if he out you through a
like questioning? Why should a man
or a woman be required to give an ac
count of all the moments as they
fly? Speaking of human beings from
my own standpoint, I should say there
is nothing dearer than freedom of the
individual, and nothing much harder
to bear than any infringement upon it.
I consider being questioned almost the
unpardonable offense on the part of a
friend, yet, left to myself, probably I
should tell him or her all I knew; but
quizzing me always results in my tell
ing nothing and there must be others
like that.

Another of my friends loves her hus
band devotedly, Ehe says. She has no
secrets from him â nor any. from any
body else â not even those she ought to
have, for perfect faith does not neces
sitate telling a man every foolish lit
tle thing, nor passfr.g on to him some
thing some girl friend has told her.
When of an evening her husband puts
on his coat to go out this wife begins,
"Why, Harry, are you going out this
evening? Where are you going? What
are you going for? Who else is going?
What makes you go? You can think of
me waiting here alone until you get
back. I Ehall sit up until you get
home."
One of my girl friends said to me of
her fiance: "I am not one of the silly
girls who cannot see faults in those
they care for. I can see them all the
plainer because I love, and though I
have hunted very hard for them, I
can't see a fault in Joe, and so I know
he hasn't got any." She and Joe got
married and went their loving way.
Some years later I met her, and in the
course of conversation she surprised me
by saying: "No. of course I don't tell
Joe everything the way I used to. Men
are so stupid they never understand, so
it is foolish to tell them and get Into a
fuss."
"Do they grow stupid after mar
riage?"
"Well, they may not, but they seem
to. Why, Joe nearly went wild over the
most innocent letter that a man sent
me, and he happened to find. I've told
the maid again and again never to
bring my letters to the table, but to
put them in my bureau drawer, but she
is so careless. One often has letters
she doesn't wish her husband to see,
bills and things of that sort."
Now, it is hard for me to imagine a
marriage a success in which one party
to the contract has such a feeling as
that. Marriage., it seems to me. is one
of two things: either a business con
tract or a union founded upon senti
ment, and if deceit enters into it one
party or the other is not living up to
the agreement, however smoothly
things may seem to go. If It is a busi
ness concern, each partner has a right
to the confidence of the other, and so
long as sentiment enters into it there
will be the same interchange of inter
ests between married couples as be
tween the engaged. The rule holds as
good whether applied to man or to
woman.
To an outsider one of the strongest
arguments against matrimony is the
number of those who try to get out of
it. Being tied is in itself a condition
trying 1 to an erratic temperament, for
you are never so eager to get away as
when you know you can't.
I have watched devoted lovers grow
into indifferent partners, and also have
seen most beautiful marria~<-s grow
from rather commonplace wooings, so
the advance stage seems not much of
an indication what the future will
give.
No one who has considered the mat
ter thoughtfully can doubt that mar
riage at its best is the perfect life,
id^al in its relations and in its develop
ment cf the best type of man and
woman, but. unfortunately, that a
thing may be is not the same as that
it is.
It might be said at the outset that the
fact of asking all over the world if
marriage is a failure is not proof that
it is a success, nor is the excellence of
an institution p.ved by the few cases
but by the many. The few but prove
the possibility of success where there
is more often but slight measure of it.
Whether marriage be absolutely a
{allure or not is something to be de
cided only by those who have tried it,
and I am no feminine Don Quixote,
tilting against windmills. I am simply
an observer, sc'ns happy marriages,
and unhappy, and sometimes finding
what is evident to all except the per
sons most concerned, "the little rift
within the lute," which has made its
music mute.
BT (MISS) DORA MAT MORRELL.
Is Marriage a Failure?
There is now no complaint of any consequence regarding
the supply of railroad cars to handle the traffic, which show;
that either the railroads have greatly increased their freight
rolling stock or that the country is doing less business. Both
factors probably exist. The earnings, however, thus far in
November are 6.1 per cent larger than in November, 1902. v
A favorable feature last week was the better tone of the
jobbing and retail trades, both of which reported a more ac
tive demand for winter goods, with buyers showing a prefer
ence for the higher priced wares. Farmers, too, are evidently
prosperous, as they arc generally holding out for top prices
for their products all over the country, and some are not dis
posed to sell at all at present.
The financial situation remains about as before! The cur
rent movement of gold from Europe to this country imparts
confidence among the moneyed interests and there is now
very little talk about tight money, while interest rates" in
New York are much lower than they were expected to be
some months ago. The supply of funds, too, is larger. Wall
street ought to respond to this satisfactory condition by in
creased activity and a rising market, but it does not. The
market continues dull and weak, with the public still chary
about meddling with the financial fire. The speculators have
lost so much money by the great Wall street, decline of the
past year that many of them have no more surplus money to
invest and those who have are not investing it in securities,
no matter how cheap they are. The wounds must heal be
fore they again enter the battle.
On the Pacific Coast the conditions continue better than
across the mountains. We are troubled by no particular
dullness out here. True, some lines report a perceptible
diminution in the volume of trade, but as a rule we are doing
very well. Money is abundant, interest rates are reasonable,
building operations are still active, real estate is selling very
well and at good prices, the demand for farm products is ex
cellent, the copious rains point to large crops for next year
and the situation all around abounds with promise.
TRADE conditions remain about as previously stated.
While general business throughout the country is good
the individual lines show considerable irregularity. The
most important line, that of iron and steel and concomitant
branches,' is one of those making an unfavorable exhibit.
Notwithstanding the decreased production and recent reduc
tions in quotations, both of^which were expected to stimulate
the decreasing movement, the business is still lagging. Buy
ers are purchasing only from hand to mouth and are exact
ing concessions, the belief prevailing that still lower prices
must rule. The industry is also unfavorably affected by the
decrease in building operations, which cuts down the demand
for structural material. More mills and' blast' furnaces have
closed down and altogether the iron and steel industry is
as -quiet now as it was active a year ago. J /v"
In other industrial lines similar conditions prevail to a
greater or less degree. Leather tanneries are closing down
here and there and many textile mills in the Atlantic Coast
States are running on half time. Lumber in the Eastern
States is quieter owing to the decrease in building. Woolen
and worsted mills and clothing factories report less activity.
But against these unfavorable features the Southern cotton
mills are increasing stock and the boot and shoe shipments
from New England are reported larger than at this time
last year, with a rather better feeling in hides.
The great food staples are still tending downward, though
slowly. Larger supplies of hogs and other livestock in the
West have resulted in weakening markets for beef and pork
products and the packers at the great Western centers are
giving little or no support to their markets beyond that nec
essary to prevent a too violent and rapid decline. Wheat is
quiet, with smaller exports, as Europe is getting about all
the wheat she wants from Russia, India and Argentina, and
Australia now announces that instead, of importing, as she
did last year, she will have some for export. These condi
tions render Europe rather independent of American^ wheat
at present. Our fine corn crop, too, estimated by the Gov
ernment at about 2,300,000,000 bushels, tends to lower quo
tations on this grain;
The statistical position of trade remains about as before.
The bank clearings .continue to show a falling off in the
volume of business as compared with last year, the decrease
last week being 21.4 per cent, though the clearings rolled up
the very satisfactory aggregate of $2,112,000,000.. The great
majority of large cities showed a decrease. The failures
were 249, against 266 last year, and there were a number un
pleasantly large, including several banks and some prominent
commercial houses.
Besides, the loss of all poetry out of
the mutual life, another cause for the
unhappiness in marriage -that makes it
seem a failure is lack of courtesy, of
the consideration that Is given instinct
ively by the sweetheart who counts it
no bore to listen to her lover's stories,
nor finds it difficult to laugh at them,
though she hears them over and over.
Courtesy will do much to smooth the
walks' of life, more than love itself, if
love lack that sweet grace and forgets
that 'â¢*}Â¦ ," : -.Â¦â¢Â¦-; '
Still In mutual sufferance lies the secret of
true living;
That Â«carce Is Love which never knows the
sweetness of forclvinsr. <
Jealousy, brutality and vulgarity are
so strikinglx offensive that all the
world admits there is no chance for
happiness with them, but they wreck
few lives comparatively. If marriage Is
a failure it is not in any great measure
because of these, but because it Is al
lowed to become commonplace. Those
who keep a touch of romance In their
relations do not find wedded bliss a
myth. It Is well to preserve one's illu
sion*

It may be hard to be happy If you
have black eyes and hair, when your
husband takes pleasure in cabling your
attention to beauties with blue eyes and
golden hair, and tells you how he al
ways admired that style of beauty, but
think what a compliment he paid you
in preferring you in spite of his fancy
for another type of comeliness. Â¦
One cannot be happy with an unbear
ably jealous man, who suspects his wife
at every turn, but the man with minor
faults, such as asking "What did you
do with the 50 cents I gave you last
week?" may be cured by the right
handling. I have seen that done.
It is true that the happiness of mar
ried life depends a good deal upon the
womanâ more, I think, than upon the
manâ because her strength lies in Just
and proper using of the powers of heart
and spirit. Of course, men sometimes
are trying and dense, but I have seen
most unpromising material made into
husbands who were dejightful and the
envy of women who had not known or
cared how to use what was theirs to
build with.
I have never seen aai instance of a
very happy marriage when the woman
was the bread winner, if the husband
were a strong, well man. If a woman
makes a home and cares properly for
the husband and the children who
should be in it, she has business enough
within the walls of her house. What
ever she does outside is just so much
taken from the strength and thought
that belong rightly to the home and
its inmates. From the beginning it has
been woman's part to care for what the
man provided and this instinct is rooted
back many centuries and is part of the
human race to-day. So surely as it is
violated for anything but the greatest
need the woman and the man suffer for
the violation. She grows to despise the
man who does not provide for herâ
though she does not say soâ and he
loses his self respect.
The woman who works with all her
might to heir) a man make money
makes a great mistake if she is seeking
happiness, for the money Is bought at
the cost of the character development
in tenderness and unselfishness that the
man needs and gets when he looks
after his wife as he wants to when he
marries. It should be some very strong
cause that leads her to take from him
this right to an unselfish manhood. The
woman who makes a true home does
more for the man than she does by go-
In*r into the labor mart, and she cannot
do both. It is no easier than it is to
"serve God and Mammon."
In the course of my wanderings to
and fro I have often spent some time
at a house where there has never been
a meal finished without some fault
finding by the master thereof. This Is
not due to ill-cooked food, for the wife
prepares good dishes and sees that the
cook does likewise. If the chicken is
broiled. "Why didn't you fry this?" If
it is fried. "Why , wasn't it boiled?" Or
perhaps the complaint will be . that
chicken was cooked at all when he
wanted fish. The vegetables were al
ways over or under done; something
that he wanted and had not spoken
about had not been prepared. Maybe it
would be, "I've been trying ever since
I was married to teach Polly to make
bread, but it seems impossible for her
to get it into her head," and the bread
Is as light and sweet as bread ought to
be. Heaven help the woman whose
husband thinks he can cook, and help
her doublv if at the same time he has
the grumbling habit!
â¢ â¢ â¢
She often sighs because marriage is
so different from the girl's dream, yet
she never blames herself for any part
of the failure. Still, as she could speak
before me and her children with this
lack of courtesy to the man whom she
had sworn before God to love and to
honor, she may not be wholly flee from
fault. Should you, present lovers, call
the marriage in which such as this was
a common occurrence a success or a
failure?
While I was at this friend's home her
husband told at dinner of something
funny that had happened that day in
the office, addressing his remarks di
rectly to her. She made no pretense of
listening, and evidently did not hear a
word.
"You don't seem to see anything fun
ny in that?"
"Oh, I never .listened to it at all. I
thought likely it was as stupid as the
stories you usually tell" â rudeness In
her manner as in her words.
"No other woman ought to be bo
handsome to a man as hla wife, how
ever she looks," sQbbed she, as if a man
lost his eyesight when he married.
Wouldn't you supose a woman would
lose confidence in her husband's Judg
ment if he thought she was the most
beautiful of women, when her mirror
told her nothing of the sort? .
Once. I was visiting a friend who had
bee.n the most romantic and sentimen
tal of girls. When she was flrst mar
ried she wept bitterly because her hus
band said another woman j was the
handsomest one he had ever seen.
â love her? Yes, but you will come to
the- conclusion that dumbness is not
without some compensations.

According to the London Westmin
ster Gazette the Russian Government
has appointed a heraldic commission to
inquire into the origin of the titles of
the numerous "princely" families of the
Caucasian provinces. Princes are more,
numerous there, It seems, than any
where else in the world, since the old
Mingrelian monarchs used to ennoble
their subjects on .the smallest pretext.
One peasant, for example, was accord
ed the style of Prince for picking up a
scarf which the monarch had dropped
in the mud, and another for acting as
beater on the occasion of a royal shoot.
The consequence Is that Russia Is full
of Caucasian Princes who keep small
shops, while Gorki, who prides himself
on his realism, has written a story of a
Caucasian Prince who was al3o a
tramp.

WRITES OF SUICIDE
THAT DIDN'T OCCTJR
Vice Admiral Togo, who has Just suc
ceeded Admiral Tsubol In command of
the standing squadron of Japan, is the
most popular naval officer in that coun
try, and great things are expected from
the "flehting admiral" in case of war
with Russia. In 1894, when the Jap
anese destroyed the Chinese fleet, Togo
wiui captain of the Naniva Kan, which
ship struck the first blow and did more
fighting than any other vessel in the
Japanese navy during that brief war.
In July, 1894, the British steamer Kow
shing and two others had been loaded
up with Chinese soldiers and stores and
started for Korea. When within sight
of destination the Kowshing was over
taken by the Naniva and signaled, "Re
main where you are or take the con
sequences." The British skipper, how
ever, was threatened with murder by
the Chinese, and when Captain Togo
of the Naniva found his order disobeyod
he warned the Europeans to leave he
ship and promptly discharged a tor
pedo against the Kowshing, sinking the
ship in half an hour and drowning most
o* the people. This and subsequent
events made Captain Togo a popular
hero' of Japan and gave him the title
of "The fighting admiral."
is to be noted that the increase in size
between the earlier built ships and the
latest is only 2017 tons, accompanied
by a corresponding increase in caliber
of heavy guns and greater coal capac
ity, the armor protection being rather
decreased. The ships are all fitted with
torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in
the stern and two on each side.
GERMAN AND AMERICAN SHIPS.
The contrast between the ideas of
American and. German naval desists
as to what constitutes the most effi
cient battleships Is very marked. Our
ships have increased in 6ize since 1S95
from 11.540 tons to 16,000 tons and
speeds from 16 to 18 knots. None of
the ships have triple screws nor tor
pedo tubes, and while there has been
a slight Increase in the coal capacity
the paramount idea seems to have
been to put heavier armament, in the
ships. On the coasts of England and
France, where there is no lack of depth
of water, ships of 16.000 tons may be
safely navigated, but conditions are not
so favorable for Germany or the United
States, and has largely influenced ship
design in limiting the displacement and
draught. Much adverse criticism has
been made by the Board of Construc
tion on the law limiting the displace
ment of two of the new battleships to
13,000 tons, it being claimed that no
efficient vessel could be designed on so
small a tonnage. Yet Germany is build
ing six ships on this displacement to
have a speed of 18 knots, while in the
approved plans of our 13,000-ton battle
ships only 17 knots speed is provided
for.
The entire corps of chaplains In the
British navy is likely to be abolished,
as King Edward and the Admiralty
favor such a course. A gTeat outcry
has been raised against this decision,
but the advocates against the chap
lains believe that commaxiders of ves
pels can perform the duties and that
the objections against the corps, which
is now composed of members of the
established church of England only,
Â¦would be silenced. Divine service on
board ship is apt to be mechanically
viewed by the men, for they can hard
ly be expected to be in a devotional
frame of mind after the other Sunday
morning duties have been finished. The
crew is turned out at 5:30 and is kept
busy up to about 10:30, when the order
for "rig church" is given and the bell
tolled for five minutes, after which the
boatswain blows his whistle and hails
"Silence fore and aft." The improvised
church is above or below deck, accord
ing to the state of the weather, and
the commanding officer signals to the
chaplain to proceed. The sermons are
generally Fhort and the men enjoy the
singing of the hymns. When the bene
diction is pronounced the boatswain is
ordered to "pipe down" and church is
th*>n unrigged.
There are 122 chaplains on the active
list in the British navy, only two of
these being Roman Catholics. The
chaplains hold no military rank and
their pay, with certain alowances,
ranges from 51&00 to $2700, according to
length of service. The chaplain of the
fleet is the venerable Archdeacon Wil
liam Stuart Harris, who became a
chaplain in the navy in 1869; the two
next in seniority date from 1876. and
the rest date from 1S77 down to Octo
ber, 1902. The two Roman Catholic
chaplains, attached to the Devonport
and Portsmouth dockyards, have been
in the service since 1887 and 1893 re
ppectively. There are seventy-one re
tired chaplains, the oldest of which
Joined the navy in 1837.
The prejudice against water tube
boilers of any kind has finally been
overcome in the navies of Great Britain
and the United States. Its superiority
over the old box boilers has been es
tablished and reluctantly admitted and
it now remains simply to select the
best of the various types. The Belle
ville has been the subject of more un
favorable criticism than any other, not
withstanding that it has given satis
faction In the French and Russian
navies, and all sorts of dire results
were predicted when it was introduced
in the British navy. Protracted and
costly competitive trials were made In
which the Belleville came off badly,
but the Spartiate's successful voyage
of 25,000 miles practically demonstrated
the efficiency and economy of this par
ticular boiler, which was further em
phasized during the recent British
naval maneuvers. There were no break
downs in the X fleet of the twenty-one
Belleville boiWed ships in the race of
S00 miles at top speed. The Spartiate
Bteamed for ninety-six hours at a clip
of eighteen knots; the Europa, which

Deadwood, driving one horse. Be

which parallels the river on low land.
The road was inundated deeper than
they believed. Twice the buggy was
floated and the horse was compelled to

Germany has built and completed ten
battleships since 1894, five of which are
of the Friedrlch III class of 10,974 tons
and 17.5 knots speed. The second lot
of five, begun in 1899. are of the Wit-,
telsbach class, 11,614 tons and 18 knots
speed. A third fleet of six battleships
of 12.991 tons and 18 knots are In course
of construction, the two last of which
will be completed by 1907. All these
ships are fitted with triple screws. It
MINE SUPERINTENDENT
AND WIFE IN PERIL
The German battleship Mecklenburg,
of 11,614 tons, built at the Vulcan
Works, Stettin, has completed her
trials and is ready for service, the pe
riod of construction being three years
and five months. The contract called
for 13,600 horsepower, with 110 revolu
tions and a speed of IS Knots. The six
hours* trial gave 14.355 horsepower, with
109 revolutions, and 18 knots speed, with
a coal consumption of 1.7 pounds per
unit of horsepower. An endurance trial
of ninety-four and a half hours devel
oped an average speed of 16.42 knot3
and 9659 horsepower, with 96 revolu
tions, and during the remaining one
and a half hours of the ninety-six
hours the ship was driven at top speed,
making 18.1 knots. The third trial of
twenty-four hours at one-quarter pow
er under ordinary cruising speed gave
3168 horsepower and a coal consumption
of 1.55 pounds.
The boiler controversy in the United
States navy is not likely to be so cost
ly nor acrimonious as in Great Brit
ain. The Xiclausse boiler has had its
first inning, notwithstanding its al
leged deficiency when first tried on the
battleship Maine. In the recent trip
to Porto Rico the boilers gave no trou
ble whatever and came fully up to the
requirements. The boiler battle in our
navy is narrowed down between the
Babcock & Wilcox, the Niclausse and
the Thornycroft â all watertu.be. The
box boiler is no longer thought of, as
for naval purposes it is as obsolete as
the paddle wheel and the simple engines
of the seventies. The choice of boilers
lies between three types, each of which
claims certain exclusive advantages,
and the selection will probably be made
of the boiler in which simplicity and
efficiency predominates, leaving econ
omy of consumption as the least desid
eratum.
BOILERS IN OUR NAVY.
two years ago made such a discredit
able record of Inefficiency through bad
manipulation of her Belleville boilers,
made a good showing at the maneuvers,
and the armored cruiser Good Hope,
lying with Bteam sufficient for nine
knot9, raised the pressure in fifteen
minutes to start with and keep up a
speed of nineteen knots. This latter
performance is beyond doubt the most
important merit of the water tube boil
er and relegates the box boiler to the
scrap heap.

' NAPA, Nov. 22.â A crew of fifteen
men in the employ of the new electric
railroad between Napa and Vallejo
andBenicia arrived in Napa from Val
lejo last night about il o'clock. : x
They went immediately to work 1 lay
ing ties and rails across the tracks of
the Southern Pacific on Soscol avenue
below the depot. The job was finished,
the track being laid several hundred
feet and then partly covered. The ob
ject of these nocturnal efforts was
probably to head off possible injunction
proceedings by the Southern Pacific
Company.-
This sudden move by the electric rail
way company has caused considerable
stir In Napa. Eight carloads of ties
amounting to 6000 have arrived at the
depot and are stored on or near Sos
col avenue, near the Palace Hotel.

fishery season in its history, trade
there is depressed and the outlook is
gloomy. The people, are ready to wel
come any settlement of the fishery dis
pute that will insure them prosperity,
and the feeling in favor of annexation
to the United States finds much favor.

And would stop any gap whence your profits may leak

The Reinsurance List.
Captain Brunings reports a most tempest
uous voyage. He states that on August 20 In
latitude 25 S. and longitude 30 W, they en
countered a terrible Â«orm, which carried away
the mizen lower topgallant mast. TbÂ« deck*
were flooded with water, and were full up to
the rails. Sea after sea swept over the ship
and she labored heavily. On August 31 In
latitude 40 S. longitude 43 XV. she ran Into
a heavy southwest gale, which, before night.
Increased into a hurricane. A tremendous sea
was on at the time, which waa running moun
tains high, when suddenly a furious aquall
struck the Magdalene and threw her on her
beam - endtt. Before she righted nÂ«nÂ«lf
stanchions on the starboard side werÂ» carried
away. During the storm. Seaman John John-
Bon waa thrown against the bulwarks with
tremendous violence, and fcia left leg was
broken.
The German ship Magdalene arrived la part
late Saturday night. 1*7 days from Newcastle,
England.
Thrown v on Beam Ends.
In speaking of the trip the 'first of
ficer of the tug stated that the wind
blew a hurricane almost the whole way
down. No sooner had one storm sub
sided than another set in. In fact. It
was a succession of terrific gales dur
ing the whole voyage. They expected
at any moment that the heavy hawser
would part, and were prepared with a
second one of heavier dimensions In
case of emergency. This, however, they
did not need, and it remained lashed In
the stern of the tug as it was when
they left Astoria. The waves rolled
high and the Sea Rover was constantly
covered with flying spray from stem to
stern. The Two Brothers also got the
full benefit of the storm, and at times
was almost lost to view from her tow.
The passage was a very stormy one.
As the ship was off Tillamook Head
she ran into a heavy southeast gale,
which was followed by a succession of
other gales until she reached Point
Reyes. Then the storm subsided. The
slowest speed the tug made was two
knots an hour, and the fastest was
seven knots. The ship is now anchored
off Harrison-street wharf. ;rÂ»
The ship Two Brothers arrived in
port yesterday afternoon, five and % a
half days from Astoria. " She came in
tow of the tuj: Sea Rover. When she
was loaded and ready to sail from As
toria it is reported that the crew of
fifteen refused to go on her, stating
that she was topheavy and in no con
dition with her deckload of lumber to
attempt to go to sea. No amount of
persuasion could force them out. so the
owners were compelled to seek the as
sistance of the tug Sea Rover, which
towed her down.

MORIARTY.Julien Bonetti was arrested lasi
evening by Patrolmen Joy and Flynr
and j booked at the City Prison on a
charge of assault , with ' a deadly weap
on. Bonetti is accused by F. Focada,
an employe of the Western Sugar Re
finery.* of having attempted to kill him
with a knife. According . to the; story
told by. Focada, he was walking up
Montgomery street on his return from
work when he heard Bonetti using vile
and obscene language in -the presence
of a lady who was passing.- He walked
up to Bonetti and asked him'- to desist.
Instead of complying with the request
Bonetti whipped out a large knife T and
made a savage lunge at Focada. 'The
men. fell to the sidewalk during the
struggle, and the latter escaped with a
few scratches on the face. S The offlcera
arrived on the scene at" this juncture,
but Bonetti refused . to â submit quietly
to arrest, and it became * necessary for
Patrolman Flynn to use hlsclub^before
the refractory prisoner would consent
to proceed quietly to the Hall of Jus
tice.

- It is not often that one comes away
yawning from the Orpheum, but there's
a good chance this week. With the. ex
ception of Annie Abbott, the "little
Georgia; magnet," a clever but snipped
off acrobatic turn by the three Zolara
and some good cooning by the Brittons
the bill is as dull as one gets in the Or
pheum grab-bag.
The "little Georgia magnet," how
ever, is worth standing the rest for.
She is the kind of thing useful to have
round when you want the piano moved
or your house shifted a block or. two.
Miss Abbott Is a small person, in short,
of rather extraordinary gifts. She first
persuades a committee to straggle on
the platform by telling it that the Czar
of Russia and the Kins of England
have done the same thing before them
âthough they didn't all speak at once
last night in spite of the inducement.
Once " on, however, there was fun In
plenty. One, two, five, ten of the men
pitted their strength against the little
woman, only to meet absurd defeat-
First she held a chair in the air be
tween her open palms, and three men
tried and failed to drag it to the |
ground. The same thing happened when
the little Georgian permitted a man to
hold the chair in the same fashion
while she placed her hands over his. A
simple stick, four or five feet long, was
also used to do the same trick, with
the same result.
Mere man got it again when Miss*
Abbott successfully defied the whole
committee to push her to the wall,
against which she had placed her
hands, nine men, one behind the other,
straining every muscle in the, effort.
Then the little lady, showed them that
she could just as easily make them do
what she pleased, as prevent them do-
Ing what they pleased. She allowed
them to take the beforementioned rod,
put all their hands on top of it, put a
man on top of that, and then carried
off the stick, the man and the commit
tee to the other side of the stage as
easily as a sunshade. Miss Abbott
shows not the slightest fatigue after
her extraordinary feats.
The Zolas, as before said, are clever
folk, and furnished one of the neatest
and newest acts lately seen here In the
acrobatic line. The Brittons are also
worth while, and if Bryant and Saville
would keep to their quicksilvery horn
piping on the fiddle, and to using the
good voice one .of them throws away,
there would be another good number.
Searl and Violet Allen have a poor;
sketch, the Arminos Tito quartet do
some well dressed and stupid danc
ing. Alice Kearney renders "A Stolen
Kiss." The blograph is worth waiting
for. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
After an absence of two and a half
years from this city, James M. Brophy
appeared at the California Theater last
night in Arthur C. Alston's presenta
tion of "At the Old Cross Roads." The
greeting extended the popular actor
was spontaneous and his entrance
speech was interrupted for several mo
ments by applause. There were others
in the company that shared the warm
reception. Estha Williams, Jane Cor
coran and Julia Blanc are all former
San Franciscans, and at the end of the
second act the entire stage was spread
with handsome floral tokens.
The Southern melodrama scored a de
cided hit with the large first night au
dience. Its story of love, slavery, and
Intrigue elicited the old sympathy and
welcome, and the popularity, of"
the plot and lines has not grown
less. From Miss Williams, in the
leading role of Parepa, an octo
roon, to the slaves and members of
the jury the cast is of the highest or
der. It is an aggregation of talent that
does credit to the play. .Miss Williams
is a star in her character and portrays
It with originality and power. In the
scene of the murder, where restraint is
cast off and the silence of years springs
into fury, she evinces her ability and
brings out the thorough melodrama.
.Brophy as Doc Kerr is very strong.
As is usual in most of his parts, he
brings sunshine where shadows lay
and thwarts the villain's plot. â¢ Jane
Corcoran as Annabel Thornton is very
sweet in her part, and no more could
be expected -from it. Harry L. Dunkin
son as Tom Smith, a tramp and after- J
ward County de Monay, is particularly
clever. He is a thoroughbred comedian
and supplies more than his share of
the comedy. "â¢
Young Mississippi is sustained by
Louise Vallentine. She does the "coon
kid" .stunt to perfection' and her spe
cialties were of the best. Julia Blanc
as old Aunt Eliza appeared in every
act and was a typical Southern ne-.
gress. She had many friends in the au-'
dience when the curtain went up and
many more before it was lowered. Wil
liam Brummell was Dayton Thornton,
the villain. From the time of his ap
pearance until he got killed in the
fourth act he had the interest of the
audience and. all pronounced his work
well done.* Mildred Hyland as Madge
Thornton, the villain's favorite daugh
ter, and Owen 'McCormack as Tom
Martin won favor for excellent acting
The twelve others in'- the cast are all
deserving of praise. The male quartet [
in the second act was encored several
times and the singers were obliged to
give five selections jbefore the audience
would allow the play to proceed. ".'

to have encountered a storm which sim
ply broke her to pieces, the disaster oc
curring probably within Uventy-four
hours after she left Yakutat.
The .Discovery was built at Port
Townsend in 1S98 for the Puget Sound
trade. She had been in the Nome traf
fic for the last three years.
Of the men known to have been on
board the Discovery, Captain M. R.
Walters was born in New York State
38 years ago and came here eighteen
years ago. He has a wife and five boys
in Port Townsend. Captain Walters
was interested in the schooners Frank
W. Howe and Vance of Port Townsend
and owns a fine dairy farm in Jefferson
County. He is also one of the stock
holders of the a American Tug Boat
Company of Everett and went north as
manager for the company.
Captain J. H. McGrath, master of the
Discovery, was until last year with the
survey steamer Patterson.
Edward Ford, first officer, is a brother
of Captain Ford of the steamship Fa
rallon.
Guy Welford, chief engineer, lives at
Everett, where, Just prior to starting
north this year, he was married. He is
36 years of age and for a number of
years engineer of the revenue launch
Guard, stationed at Port Townsend.
Edward Vansice, purser, is a native
of New York State and came to Port
Townsend in 1887. He is 40. years of
age.
Bent's information makes it practi
cally certain that the Discovery is lost
and leaves little hope for either pas
sengers or crew. It is believed in fact
that everybody on board perished. Th*}
wreckage found, Bent says, consists of
pieces of lifeboats, life preservers and
large pieces of her hulL He states that
a terrific storm prevailed for a week
prior to November 16, on which date he
boarded the Excelsior at Yakutat, hav
ing walked 90 miles from Seal River to
catch the steamer. The Yakutat
Indians were watching- the- beach
for bodies and they claim to have
found a large piece of mast and a man's
coat.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 22.â A special
dispatch to the Post-Intelligencer from
Juneau, Alaska, announces that J.
Bent, a 'passenger on the steamer. Ex
celsior, arriving to-day reports that a
mass of wreckage from the steamer
Discovery was washed ashore at the
mouth of Seal River, thirty miles below
Yakutat. ;

Their burns were so many that the I
physician worked for full three hours
in dressing them. Collins, who was the
leapt injured, was able to go home after
he was attended to. The other three !
were removed to a private hospital, Â¦
where they will be confined for some j
time. Murphy will be able to leave the
hospital in a week's time, but the other
two will be compelled to remain in bed
for several weeks.
The injured men denied having used
a candle in their work, but the remains
of one was found on the scene of the
explosion. ' No damage was done the
building, though it was severely
shaken.
BUILDING ONI/T SHAKEN.
Four men were seriously burned by
an explosion of gas in the generator
room of the San Francisco Gas Light
Company at its works In the Protero,
near Twenty-third and Kentucky
streets, yesterday morning. The explo
sion occurred at 8:30 o'clock. Three of
the workmen were so badly burned that
they had to remain at a hospital for
treatment. Those injured are John
Reynolds, Washington Hotel, 622
Fourth street; Laurence Donlan and
Martin Murphy, 823 San Jose avenue,
er.d John Collins, 232 Day street. Col
lins was allowed to go horhe after hav
ing his wounds dressed, he being the
least injured of the four. The other
three were burned severely on their
faces, hands and arms.
CAUDLE CAUSES EXPLOSION.'
The men are all gas fitters and were
taken from the street gang to make a
connection with one of the large pipes
leading from one of the gas generators
to the basement of the generating
plant of the works. All of the gas was
supposed to have been taken from the
mains. The men, contrary to the rules
of the gas company, carried a lighted
candle to their work in order that they
might see better what they were doing.
There was an admixture of gas and
air In the pipe. The men had been
â¢working about an hour when one of
them stuck the candle in the main.
There was a terrific explosion and the
mixture bursst into flames, igniting, the
clothes of the men and burning them
terribly. The other men in the works
Immediately rushed to the scene of the
explosion, put out the fire on the work
men's clothing and dispatched a man
for help to the Protero Branch Emer
gency Hospital. The injured men were
then removed in an ambulance to the
hospital, where Dr. Painter dressed
their wounds.
Gallant Patrick Manning, the rich
miner from Tonopah, is now a
benedict. Yesterday afternoon he
and the girl of his choice, Miss' Ma
mie Cannon of 223 Perry street, tripped
merrily down to St. Rose's Church and
there the matrimonial knot was tied
by Rev. Father O'Neill.
Manning's hasty plunge into the mat
rimonial sea will not come altogether
as a surprise to those who know him
Â¦well, for it has been common gossip
for some time that the king of the
gold dust realm was smitten with the
charms of the fair and winsome Miss
Cannon. But then there was another
whom, rumor had it. Manning regarded
with more than common esteem, so
many of those who supposed they knew
all will now open their eyes In surprise.
Both Manning and his bride did all
in their power to escape notoriety and
whenever the talk of marriage was
brought up both were wont to take on
a mj-sterious expression and pass the
subject off by giving evasive answers.
But what is to become of the other
fair one with whom the dashing miner
was formerly infatuated? Mrs. Me-
Glynn wants damages and says that
she had first claim on the affections of
Manning.
Manning has furnished a beautiful
new flat for his comely young bride.

cent Regarding Their
\ Marriage.
A young Oakland man started out to
be' ; a : footr>ad at an early hour this
morning 1 and an exciting half hour,
during which two citizens yielded up
their coin,, a deputy sheriff's pistol
barked once and the police came hur
rying in answer to a telephone alarm,
saw the beginning and the end of the
youth's career of crime.
The footbad â¢ was . captured by the
men he had robbefl,* the deputy sheriff
and his brother after a short chase. He
said, his name was Martin * Noone and
that he lived at 1124 Campbell street.
Shortly; after midnight Frank Fer
guson, a, fireman employed by the
Southern. Pacific Company and living
at 1124 Chestnut street, and Harry, Or
bell, a" plumber residing at 1068 Kirk
ham street;Â«.were on their way home,
when they, \ saw a- man leaning against
a building ait ihe corner of Twelfth and
Linden streets. He was smoking a
cigarette and . suddenly bounded' for
ward with/a^demand that Ferguson
and Orbell 1 throw up .their hands, at the
same time. pointing a revolver at them.
Ferguson resisted, when the footpad
snapped his: revolver, but the cart
ridge failed' to explode. Ferguson, see
ing the â¢ footpad meant business, j gave
him $1 25, all the money he had in his
possession, 'and Orbell handed over
$1 50. The robber then ran along Lin
den street and was followed by the two
men, who were joined by Deptuy
Sheriff Moffat and his brother, M. Mof
fat.
The brother of the deputy proved a
fast sprinter, and he ran the footpad
down in a vacant lot a block away and
held him at bay till the others ran up.
Again the desperate young man tried
to shoot, and again his revolver only
snapped.
Then Deputy Sheriff Moffat fired a
shot at the footpad. The latter, threw
away his useless .revolver and surren
dered.
The noise of the chase awakened
many people in the neighborhood, and
a telephone message was sent to the
police station. A number of policemen
arrived on the scene as the capture was
made. â¢
