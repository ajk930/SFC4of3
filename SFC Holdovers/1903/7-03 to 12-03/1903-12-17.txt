IN COUNCIL OF ELDER
STATESMEN OF JAPAN
After seventeen years of service for
the University of California; during
which period he steadily acquired the
esteem of faculty and Regents until
they had thorough confidence in his
integrity, William A. McKowen, secre
tary of the great educational institu
tion, stands a self-confessed gambler,
betrayer of trust anil defaulter. His
peculations, which began about five
years ago, foot up about $40,0CO, and

That happened on Tuesday, and on
the afternoon Of that day the report of
the check transaction was wafted across
the bay to President Wheeler, who im
mediately inaugurated an investigation.
The president, loth to believe in Mc-
Kowen's guilt, endeavored to find him
and get an explanation Tuesday even
ing, but when the defaulter learned that
the' cat was out of the bag he madÂ«?
himself invisible to those who sought
him. Yesterday morning, however, he
visited the president's house at Berke
ley and sobbingly made confession of
his wrongdoing. President Wheeler
was immeasurably surprised and
grieved by the man's statement, but he
did not allow predilection to Intefere
with duty. After suspending McKowen
from ofilce and placing him under the
surveillance of Deputy Town Marshal
Edgar of Berkeley, he 'telegraphed tho
tidings to Governor Pardee and Messrs.
A.'W. Foster, I. W.Hellman and J. A.
Brltton. with a request that they meet
him at 4 o'clock at, the university for a
conference.' The Governor responded
that he was unable to attend, on ac
count of official business, and Mr. Hell
man pleaded Illness and gent In hte
stead E. F. Heller of the law firm of
Heller & Powers, with' instructions to
MARES FULL CONFESSION'.
So thoroughly had the man bamboo
zled the finance committee of the Board
cf Resents that the members of that
body received the news of his defalca
tion with a shock that was not entirely
free from incredulity. But there was
no gainsaying the fact or repudiating
the evidence. McKowen confessed hl3
crime to President Wheeler yesterday
morning and modestly estimated hia
shortage at $20,000, but subsequent in
vestigation raised It to double that sum.
But the confession was not made un
til exposure was inevitable. In a mo
ment of indiscretionâ the fatal moment
that sooner or later overtakes the most
cautious practicer of deceit-McKowen
paid a racing debt of $1160 with a check
for $1200 that had been intrusted to
him to place in a scholarship fund. It
bore the signature of Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst, and Its possession by "Jim
Davis a dishonored maker of books
on horse races, aroused suspicion and
created inquiry.
he wagered and lost all the money on
the racetrack. He is under a $5000
bond. so. the State is likely to loss
$35,000 as the result vi the extraordi
nary conditions of financial supervision
that cabled Mr. McKowen to operate
so long without detection.

MELBOURNE, Victoria, Dec. 16.â
The first of the. commonwealth general
elections at which women exercised the
right of suffrage was held to-day, with
the result that all political calcula
tions were upset. The struggle was
chiefly over the fiscal question. The
Government party favored protection
and the opposition supported free trade,
and the third in importance, the Labor
party, agreed to sink the question of
fiscal differences with a view to secur
ing the balance of power, which It vir
tually held in the last Parliament.
The women voters were excellently
organized and cast a heavy vote, al
most exclusively in favor of the Labor
ticket, regardless, of other considera
tions, the result being that the Labor
party won many seats, mainly from the
protectionists, in districts where the
three parties contested. y
The feature of the result Is the re
markable success of the Labor vote in
Victoria, where at last elections the
laborites were" badly beaten. The re
turns are still Incomplete.
REDDING, Dec. 16.â Samuel Mitch
ell and J. Parsons, miners of Butte
County, are digging for a burled treas
ure cave near the Jackson mine, on
Deer Creek. They believe they are
working on the spot where. an old In
dian left a large amount - of . money
which the Indian and his band had
accumulated as the result. of robbery.
The story goes that the old Indian bur
ied the money when he learned that
the whites were about to- attack his
camp. The whites made the attack and
he was slain. His daughter later told
the hiding place of her father's wealth,
but when persons were taken to the
vicinity of the cave the cave to her
did- not seem the same. After much
hesitancy she declared water had
caused the ground to fall and cover the
money. An effort was made to. locate
the money, but It was not successful.
Mitchell and Parsons think they are
on the rieht spot.

TOKIO, Dec. 16. â In consequence of
Russia's reply a special conference of
the elder statesmen of Japan, including
Marquis Ito and the Cabinet Ministers,
proceeded here to-day. It is under
stood that the statesmen are consider
ing the adoption of a firm stand against
Russia.
General Kodama, the War Minister,
was present for the first time at the
conference. There is renewed activity
at the Admiralty in view of a possible
naval demonstration.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 16.â The
Novokai, the personal organ of Viceroy
Alexieff, says: . . . -
"Japan knows Russia's desire for
peace, but she should also know that
Russia cannot surrender vital interests
to foreigners, either. Japanesa or/Amer
icans, by relinquishing her; big under
taking in Manchuria, created at the
expense of Russian blood and treasure."
MOSCOW, Dec. 16.â A copy of the
Daily Vostock, just "> received . here,
throws interesting, light on. the Russian
attitude in- Manchuria. An imperial
commission, which is drawing up regu
lations for Admiral Alexieff s vice
royalty, in rendering various decisions
says: .
"The custom-house question is not
yet settled. It remains dependent upon
whether Russia will retain Manchuria
for herself alone."

' Nathan Carr, who is well known
throughout the' city.T when seen- last
evening stated that although he did not
believe in'' miracles : he, felti that fate
played' a prominent part. in saving, his
life. He said that he noticed nothing
suspicious ' in ; the; demeanor of Neate
"until his return with the second round
of drinks, and then the insistence of
the fellow' that heMrink the' liquor 'arid
He was Insistent that Carr should
drink and that gentleman had the
glass of liquor to his lips when a cus
tomer came In. He laid his rlass on
the counter and attended to his patron.
He then returned to Neate and started
to drink the cocktail. Fate again in
tervened for the .young man for De
tectives Dlnan and: Wren made their
appearance on the scene and foiled the
villain in his diabolical scheme.
Neate was seized, handcuffed and
taken to .the "Hall' of Justice. *When
searched a bottle half nlled with
strychnine' In crystallized form was
found in his pocket, with several pieces
of Jewelry stolen from the hotel. The
detectives had been trailing him all day
and had arrived on the scene at an
opportune time, as subsequent develop
ments proved.
In the excitement of the arrest Can
forgot the cocktail, but upon learning of
the bottle of strychnine found In the
possession of the prisoner he took the
glass of liquor to Joy's pharmacy, at the
corner of California and Kearny streets.
The druggist In charge, from the taste
of the liquor, to which he first touched
his lips, and the presence of in
numerable white crystals at the bottom
of the glass, stated to Carr that there
Was enough strychnine in the mixture
to kill several men. The glass and its
contents were then turned over to Cap
tain Martin and will be officially tested
by the city chemist.
FATE SAVES. CARR.
For several weeks the roomers at
the Plymouth Hotel at the corner of
Bush and Jones streets' have com
plained of the loss of many valuable
articles, aggregating in value about
$1000. Captain Martin was notified of
the thefts and 'detailed Detectives Di
nan and Wren on the case, with in
structions to catch the crook ' at all
hazards. Neate was employed in the
hotel in the capacity of night clerk,
but suspicion was not- directed to him
until last Saturday, when he suddenly
resigned his position. Since that the
detectives had been on his track.
Yesterday afternoon Neate visited
the pawnbroker store of Carr at 516%
Dupont street and disposed of several
articles, which subsequently proved to
be some of the plunder secured from
the hotel. Neate was most affable and
suggested that Nathan Carr, brother
of the proprietor, take a drink with
him. As the latter could not leave the
store Neate volunteered to go after
the liquor and purchased two cocktails
at the saloon of Ed Labordette, Cali
fornia and Dupont streets. He re
turned to the store and Nathan Carr
and Neate drank the liquor. Neate
then suggested that they have another
drink and again repaired to the saloon
for two wore glasses of the same
liquor. He was much longer on his
second trip and it was thought that
he did not intend to return. He finally
came back" and depositel the two
glasses on the counter.
URGES HIS DRIXK.
BURGLARIES : CONTINUOUS. : -
It was only a stroke of fate that
saVed Nathan Carr, a pawnbroker of
516^ Dupont street, from drinking a
premeditatedly poisoned cocktail last
night.
Leon D. Neate, on? time hotel clerk,
burglar and Borgia by instinct, had
planned to poison the one man whose
evidence would send him to the peni
tentiary. Detectives Dlnan and Wren
arrested the cold-blooded criminal Just
as his would-be victim was about to
lift to his lips a cocktail heavy with
crystals of strychnine. He was seized
by the officers for a series of burglaries
perpetrated by him at the Plymouth
Hotel.
That Nathan Carr lives to tell of his
experience can be justly regarded as a
miracle, and his version of the near
approach he had to death reads like
an act from one of those lurid melo
dramas so dear to the deities of the
gallery. Had it not been for the fact
that a customer happened to enter the
store just as he had a glass of poisoned
cocktail to his lips and the arrival of
the detectives before he could again at

WASHINGTON', Dec. 16.â The report
cf Conrad and Bonaparte on the
charges made by S. W. Tulloch, for
merly cashier of the Washington City
Postcfflce, against the administration
of his offic? was made public to-day.
Under Instructions from the President
the report views the Tulloch charges
'â¢from a legal standpoint." The report
begins with a brief history and nature
of the Tuiloch charges, and then
makes the following: "preliminary ob
servations"' concerning them:
"No improper official act on the part
Â«'f any public officer or employe is al- \
loped which did not occur more than !
three years before July 17, 1903, and as
all possible prosecutions are barred we
are led. therefore, to interpret our in
structions to report en these matters
"frÂ«>;n a legal standpoint' in a broader
sense than' we might otherwise ven
ture to ascribe to them, and understand
that cur views are desired as to the
J^ga! propriety of the official action dis
<-Ifised and n<>t merely, whether it may
or may not have been criminal."
The tendency to evade answering the
charges, evinced by those replying to
the Postmaster General's request for
each answers, the report says, is illus
trated very forcibly by the charges
against Ptfliy S. Heath, former Assist
ant Postmaster General, which have
born heretofore made public, with his
answer to them.
"We consider this answer," it con
tinues, "altogether insufficient, and no
less unsatisfactory in substance than
In form."
HEATH'S OFFICIAL RECORD.
Continuing, the report says the revis
ion of Postmaster Willets' accounts Is
of itself sufficient to show that Heath's
official record is not so clear as to defy
suspicion. It adds:
"Moreover, the "confidential report' of
Inspector in Charge Smith and the
'special report' of Inspector Little tend
so strongly to sustain some of the most
serious charges made by Mr. Tulloch
against Mr. Heath that it is quite im
possible to dispose of these charges by
tailing them "lies out of the whole
cloth,' and especially when we remem
ber that the 'confidential report' is
stated by Inspector Smith to set forth
irregularities discovered by himself,
and that the 'special report* was pTe
pared a whole year after Mr. Tulloch
had left the office. The reasonable in
ference to be drawn from Mr. Heath's
complete failure to meet fully and ex
plicitly accusations -which, as Post
master General Payne very Justly ad
monished him. charged him with many
acts of doubtful propriety, added to the
facts appearing from the record evi
dence laid before us, oblige us to say
that, at least, a strong prlma facie
case is presented of willful and reckless
disregard by the late First Assistant
Postmaster General of obligations im
posed on him by the regulations of his
own department, as well as by the stat
utes of the United States, and we feel
it our duty to add that suspicion of his
personal integrity must be inevitably
aroused in our Judgment by an impar
tial consideration of the facts submit
ted to us and of his plainly inadequate
explanations."
BRINGS IN SMITH'S NAME.
The report takes up in detail the
charges of improper appointments of
subordinates and improper disburse
ments of public funds, as contained in
the Tulloch charges, and after analysis
concludes:
"So far as Indicated by the papers
submitted to us the .persons directly
responsible for these .fraudulent em
ployments were Messrs. Perry S. Heath
and George W. Beavers, neither of
whom is now in the public service. It
Foems clear, however, that this respon
sibility extends in some measure to
the late Postmaster General, who ap
pears to have at least tolerated the
practice after notice of Its existence,
and to the late and present postmast
ns at Washington, each of whom ap
pears to have accepted the transfer to
his office of a number of persons thus
employed without, so far as I? shown,
any protest or exposure, facts cubstan
tiallr admitted to himself in Mr. Mer
ritt's letter of June 23."
Touching the administration of form
er Auditor Castle the report says:
' "We might give further illustrations |
of the auditor's apparent readiness to j
disregard the usual safeguards against j
the unauthorized expenditures, but this i
is needless because the samo. in our |

The San Francisco CallMcKowen left England early in life
and came to California as a sailor and
took a clerkship in the office of the sec

McKOWEX'S CAREER.
Though McKowen had posed. as hon
est among his associates at the uni
versity and with those In whose close
company he was thrown by business
and social relations in the college, there
was another side to his life. Horses
were not his only game, nor the race
track the only channel fnto which the
university's dollars were thrown so
prodigally. He enjoyed the life where
the lights burned brightly while glasses
clink and gay women smile.
To the followers of the racing game
McKowen was a familiar fieure. He
ranked as one of the "old timers" in
the betting ring, and so well, known
was he that he had the privlleee of
credit at more than one book. During
many.of his visits to the racetrack he
was accompanied by Mrs. Joseph
Dieves, .widow of Joseph Dieves, who
for many years managed a resort on
the San Leandro road. It was strongly
hinted at one time that the pair were'
to be married. That the woman ever
received aiiy financial benefit lrom Mc-
Kowen's stealings Is denied.
Mrs. Dieves was not at her home last
night, but a friend authorized to speak
for her said: "It is true that McKowen
and Mrs. Dieves were together a great
deal* about two years ago, but within
the last year they have seen very lit
tle of each other. In fact, it might al
most be said that their friendship has
ceased. I have been with them myself,
but McKowen always kept within the
means of a man living on a salary. It
was only In the matter of his betting
that I ever heard any question as to
where he got his money. He never
gave Mrs. Dieves a single present dur
ihjg: their whole acquaintance. We three
have been to dinner together, but the
dinners ware Inexpensive.
"McKowen was very secretive. I
never knew whether he had lost or
won when I have been at the track
with him, and' I never knew whether it
was his own or somebody else's money
he was playing, j
"Last year he did some very heavy
playing, and not long ago I saw him one
day with his pocket full of twenties at
the track. With people with whom he
went around he' spent money as they
did, and he gave very little of it
away.***
thought of anything except trying to
straighten matters."
HIS DOUBLE LIFE.
brought hi:n no increase in salary.
Later he was given the title of "Act-
Ing Secretary and Land Agent," and
on the death of Secretary Davis last
February the regents took formal rec
ognition of McKowen's services and
made him secretary at a salary of $2400
a year. He held that position until the
crash came to-day.
McKowen is 37 yeara of age and un
married. \ .

WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â The full
report of Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General Bristow was made public to
day, with the exception of ths exhibits,
which are ' withheld because of the
pending criminal cases. The report re
iVeals many new facts brought out by
the months of investigation and not
embodied in the official abstract made
public a fortnight ago. These are
mostly In the way of important sup
plementary information regarding the
alleged connection of executive officers
of the department with fraudulent con
tracts for supplies, alleged efforts to
promote mining stock among Postoffice
Department employes, Irregularities in
outside postoffices, etc.
. Edward S. Alien, now a clerk at the
Cleveland postofflce, tfccilfied that re
ports he made on the merits of the
Hampden canceling machine were not
satisfactory to First Assistant Post
master General Heath nor to Beavers,
and says he was plainly advUed that It
was Heath's desire that these machines
b.e Installed and the desire of Beavers
"and the general" that he do less talk
ing derogatory to the machine. He
says he Was forewarned of this by hi3
brother, then chief clerk to. the Firct
Assistant Postmaster General, and
thereafter Allen testified he simply In
stalled th'e machines and refrained
from any comment. The machines
proved worthless.
The report says that II. J. Truesdell
of Binghamton, N. Y., of tlie Canceling
Machine Company, told inspectors that
before the order of June 30, 1900, was
given fox one hundred Doremus can
celing machines two hundred - shares
($20,000 worth) of the stock of the com
pany was transferred to First Assistant
Postmaster General Heath, who prom
ised to order not less than three ma
chines at $225 each. In nis affidavit
Truesdell states. .that Green, a State
Senator from New York, told him he
had made this agreement with Heath
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel one Sat
urday night and that he thought Trues
dell and Doremua should "whack up"
with him: Trufes,dell states that he
agreed to contribute his snare and that
he transferred-fifty shares of his stock
to Green for that purpose.
Truesdell further states that Green

What the Germans Think of Us.
President Wheeler gave out a state
ment detailing the circumstances of the
McKowen" affair,' . as follows :Â¦
"I- heard last 'night;- to. my utter as
tonishment/that- McKowen; had offered
a check which had evidently come into
McKowen, who remained in the cus
tody of Constable Samuel Edgar all
day, was taken by his custodian to the
j County Jail In Oakland after the in
vestigation, where lie spent the night.
He was perfectly willing to go and did
not attempt 'to secure bends. No
charge was placed "against him as the
investigating committee has not yet
decided just what charge will be made.
He had a brief 'consultation with his
attorney, P. F. Dunne of San Francisco.
McKowen .made a complete confes
sion of his wrongdoing to President
1 Wheeler, withholding nothing. The con r
fesslon was precipitated by a false
step that this victim of the gambling
mania and his own weakness took to
pay a debt' contracted on the race track
with Bookmaker "Jlni" Davis as his
creditor." Instead of betting money
McKowen negotiated his bets with "I
O U's" and, as he generally lost at the
rate of $300, J 100 and $500 a day and sel
dom won, he soon came to owe Book
maker Davis $1160/ This debt Davis im
portuned McKowen to settle and finally
got a promise from McKowen to meet
him at the Occidental Hotel last Tues
day, with the t ldea of liquidation. Mc-
Kowen kept ;hls- promise and In settle
ment of .his obligation gave Davis the
check for $1200. In accepting the check
Davis . gave .McKowen $40 in change,
the difference between the face of. the
check . and -the debt and canceled the
obligation. McKowen, in .. excusing ; his
conduct for paying his private debts
with the university's money, told Davis
that it was his intention to return the
money . to . ? he [ university - treasury as
soon as he returned to his home in
Berkeley. ;â¢ '/ Â¦
'PRESIDENT WHEELER SPEAKS.
McKOWEN IN JAIL.
REGENT BRITTOX. SURPRISED.
"I think before we get through," said
Mr. Britton, "it will be found that at
least $40,000 is missing. It is almost
Impossible to conceive â¢ how a single
man could 'steal that amount of money
and yet escape detection. No doubt it
is the fault of the bookkeeping system,
which has not grown with the growth
of the university. I don't suppose that
anybody is really to blame for the loss
of the money, as Secretary McKowen
certainly carried out his plan of deceit
in a most subtle way. but the system
should certainly have been changed."
Charles E. Snook would not make any
statement for publication on the ground
that he had appeared merely as attor
ney for the Board of Regents and did
not know enough of the proceedings to
talk about them. .â¢
Mr. Heller, Treasurer Hellman's rep
resentative, said afterward that a pros
ecution' of McKowen wouliV be neces
sary, even if the defaulter could make
good the stolen money, which he can
not do. As he had not conferred with
hjs client he_ refused to say anything
as to the culpability of any ovM for per
mitting the peculations.
It is not expected that the regents
will b!ame uny one for the sj'stem of
bookkeeping that made possible Mc-
Kowen's theft. The system has been
in vogue for many years and has not
only been cumbersome but . unsafe.
The State will have to stand nearly all
cf the loss sustained through McKow
en. The bondsmen for McKowen are
the Pacific Surety Company, which
furnished a bond for, $5000 that it will
be forced to" pay. This leaves about
$35,000 that the State will lose.
Regent . Foster, who is chairman of
the finance committee of J.he Regents,
was chosen by his colleagues to give
out a statement as to the action of the
committee after the meeting. He did
not give out a definite statement as to
the amount of the loss, but said that
the committee would continue to meet
until It had discovered Just what
amount was stolen.
"We have gone over the accounts of
the secretary," he said, "but we are not
yet in a position to state how much
money was taken. We will do every
thing in our power, however, to find out
how it Is possible for a man to take so
much money , without being detected.
There Is mystery somewhere and we
intend Â£0 solve* It.. 'teach year the aud
itor goes over tiVe r accounts. Most of
the money, , I might say practically all
of It, was first taken from private do
nations arid then replaced by money
taken from the university funds."
Regent John A. Britton, the most ac
tive member of the committee, indorsed
everything Mr. Foster said, and de
clared that McKowen would be prose
cuted. â¢
WHO IS TO BLAME?
HOW MeKOWENv STOLE.
; The committee of inquiry spent three
hours over the books kept by Mc-
Kowen. and he assisted them in finding
out things. It was ascertained that he
had covered his tracks by manipulating
various funds so that it was almost im
possible"; with the bookkeeping system
prevailing at the university, to detect
his peculations. It was also discovered
that instead of $20,0C0. his estimate, the
total amount of the stealings would be
$40,000. .
For instance, when the secretary re
ceived achoc.k for SI 200 to be, applied
to a scholarship fund he took the mon
ey himself and when tho scholarship
became, dua he would repay it by tak
ing mone;' from â¢ the â¢ general or -other
funds of the university. In order '.hen
to reijr.burso the fund from which he
had stolen the $1200 lie made repre
sentations that he had spent the mon
ey on purchases. In this way he avoid
ed falsifying: the books and escaped ex
posure for five. years.. â¢ - =
This system of thiovery was made
all the more easy on. account of the
fact that the treasurer, Mr. Hellman,
resides in San Francisco and Secretary
McKowen transacted his business in
Berkeley. . There was no check upon
Â¦ McKowen, and many of his transac
tions were conducted without the
knowledge at the treasurer."
The auditor of the university is J. J.
Herr of San Francisco, who receives an
annual. salary for auditing the accounts
of tno university. Whether Mr. Herr
wfis also deceived" by the. system that
McKowen practiced or overlooked the
peculations through carelessness are
things that the investigating commit
tee has not yet been able to determine.
represent t him. Messrs. Britton and
Foster obeyed the president's summons,
and Charles K. Snook, attorney for the
Board of Regents, also attended.
"I owe all my degradation to the
racetrack^" he said, "and let it be a les
ion to others who may think they may
'win fortunes in the betting ring. The
races are not run honestly, and no man
may ever expect to be successful with
them. When the Bookmakers lose they
find a way to square themselves. They
have left me without a cent of all the
money "I took.
"I never intended to take the univer
sity's or anybody's money. But the
j strange fascination for gambling that is
in some men drew me on. A man wins
5 cents and then he wants to win- 10,
and when he loses he tries to recover
it. , If he has takeri his employer's
money his' road to ruin has begun to
run down hill pretty fast. There is
nothing at the bottom but wreckage.
"As to the future, I have not even
thought of it. I haven't thought of se
curing bonds for my release If I am ar
rested, and I haven't thought of engag
ing an attorney. , I have been so com
pletely downcast that I have not
THE DEFAULTER'S PLEA.
ANTIQUE BOOKKEEPING.
"We are shocked beyond all measure
at this occurrence. McKowen is a very
likable man. Such an ending could not
have been imagined. Nobody with a
heart could see him no\v and not be
moved. Thl3 is complete ru'.n.
"One of the troubles that han brought
on this disgrace is the fact that the
system of bookkeeping is completely
out of date. There is an abundant sys
tem of checks, but they don't check^
Money comes into the haiid* of both
the secretary and treasurer, one being
in one place and the other some other
place. Checks are made out to the sec
retary when they should bo made out
to the treasurer. Thus the secretary
incidentally comes to huve money. He
has been tempted in this case and has
used it, covering up his peculations by
charging the amount against this fund
or that. This expose, I hope, will mean
a complete reorganization of this de
partment, bringing its financial system
into a simpler and more stable form
and making It entirely modern."
REGENT HELLJIAN'S OPINIONS.
It is the impression of I. W. Hell
man of the finance committee ..of the
Board of Regent3 that .the funds used
by the secretary on. the racetrack were
taken from the amounts deposited by
students and donations for scholar
ships. Speaking of the reported defal
cation, Regent Hellman yesterday said:
"The accounts cf the secretary are
examined every quarter by the auditor,
and I cannot understand why the
shortage was not discovered. No. the
secretary does not collect the rents of
property belonging to the university.
That is done by a rent collector, who
pays the money into the treasury. The
State appropriations do not pass
through the hands of the secretary.
Cash derived from the sale of lands Is
paid into the treasury.
"Secretary McKowen has bee^n in the
seryice of the university >nany years.
He* was there as a clerk under Secre
tary Bonte and served in a similar ca
pacity under Secretary Davis. He was
required to give a bond when he was
appointed to succeed Secretary Davis,
but it is possible that the bond was
not renewed. The affair is most de
plorable."
The treasurer of the university is I.
W. Hellman Jr. of the Union Trust
Company. He is in New York and will
not be home for several days.
McKowen, completely crushed and
weeping, sat all day in- the office with
which he has been connected for seven
teen years assisting the efforts being
made to discover the evidences of his
wrong-doing. He was disinclined to
discuss his* affairs at first, but after
ward talked freely about the cause of
his downfall.
"I suspended McKowen from of
fice immediately pending an investiga
tion and the action of Governor Par
dee and placed his office temporarily
in the hands of Victor Henderson. I
then telegraphed to the Governor, who
was supposed to be on his way to Lodi,
to come to Berkeley to meet with the
other members of the finance commit
tee cf the Board 'of Regents.
"As yet we have no precise idea as to
the amount of the peculations, but from
what I have thus far learned it appears
that McJCowen, at different times since
1S98, hae used sums of money that came
into his hands, whether as fees or do
nations, and, instead'of depositing them
with the treasurer, has applied them to
his own use. Ho has been able., to cover
up these thefts by taking corresponding
amounts from the university funds and
charging them as expenditures under
the head of one or the other of the.
funds. He says he has not in any other
way falsified his bookkeeping by mak
ing false entries.
"The loss seems to be divided over
five or six years. So far as we know, or
he knows, in this fiscal year it amounts
to $1200. The total amount we do not
know, though when he confessed to me
this morning he said he thought it
would-be $20,000 or more. He,, says he
got the mojiey in this way only, and
that he spent it on> the race track.
his hands for university use in pay
ment of a private obligation. I imme
diately communicated with all the
members of the finance committee that
I could reach and requested them to
meet" me at my office at 9 o'clock this
morning. I was unable ' to reach
McKowen by telephone, but he came to
my. house at 8 o'clock thi3 morning
with W. H. Smyth and there confessed
to. me that he was a defaulter.

SUM3IARY OF THE REPORT^
The summary and conclusions 'of the
report, are as follows:
â¢'As a result <if our inquiry the "Tul
loch duties' ar.d of the confederations
hereinbefme set forth we have the
honor to report that. In our judgment:
"Firstâ The discussion <>f the Tulloch
charts has revealed the existence of
drploraMe and gravely -discreditable
abuses during the years 1S9S, 1S39 and
XtOO in the War-hington postofflce and
thÂ« <;ffioe of the First Af distant Post
master General.
"Eecond â These abuses Involved con
duct on :ho ri.irt of the various public
officials nrhich was coTtairsly nften il
lppal and may have been so:netimes
criminal, but such offer.r<?s, if com
mitted, were in all cases committed
more than three rears before wo were
ordered to investigate the charpes, and.
so far as we are clearly Informed, more
than three years before Mr. Tulloch's
interview of May 1 last.
â¢'ThirdâThn evidence laid before us
sy^grcsts the possibility, and even prob
ability, but does not prove, that abuses
have continued both in th<Â» department
and in the postoffice subsequent to the
ecrly rammer of 1P<X>. when we lose
Eight <Â»f them, and that In connection
therewith criminal acts may have been
committed within the pericd of limita
tions.
the ir.sr>cctor? could not find out from
the postmaster or any one e!se (as to
these it it possible, although hardly
probable, that he may have been mis
led), but actually allowed Mr. Beavers
the illegal and fraudulent ilaim for
"expens-op" which, as Mr. Castle's own
memorandum says, "really constituted
saiary' â th" palary of an office which
Beavers did not and could not legally
hold nnd which no one. not ?â¢yen the
President, could have promised him so
as to bind the United States, either
legally or morally, to keep the promise.
We find it impossible to Uoobt that
Mr. Heath. Mr. Van Cott and Mr. Beav
â¢rs= himself, all knew the payment of
dis additional compensation was ex
gresply forbidden by law and that it
r.as called Expenses' to evad ; ; this pro

"'Well,' I said, 'we. Â¦will not have a'
union man on the place, and I'll tell
tyou that In plain English, so there shall
be no misunderstanding. If you go to
Rand3burg and affiliate with the union
you will lose your jobs.'
"They asked me about the fare to
Randsburg, and I told them if they
made up a crowd of more than ten I
would get them a special rate. On De-
I cember 3 seventeen of them showed up.
I went with them, but Berryman signed
the ticket and checked the baggage.
Each man was told by myself in the
| presence of two or more witnesses in
I my office that we had broken the strike
at the mine.
"The complaint was filed on Decem
ber 8. I have a certified copy of it, and
j my attorneys, Frank McGowan and H.
j W. Hutton, declare that it is not worth
i the paper It's printed on. We will, at
' tack it, first because it is alleged the
j offense of misrepresenting conditions at
the mine w*s committed in San Fran
l cisco and the Randsburg Justice has
no Jurisdiction, and, second, on the
complaint itself as worthless, and,
â¢ third, on the ground that the men were

I did not tell him about the strike.
"Sheriff Kelly of; Kern County holds
the warrant for my arrest, and I have
talked with him over the 'phone. He
told me he was about of the same opin

the thing through the last court.
| "We are keeping a heavy guard
around our property, but the strike is
broken, and since October 1 we have
been running our 130 stamps every day. j
We got 100 Missourians among the new
< men, and the greatest trouble we have
I is to keep them from going out and
fighting with the remnants of the men
who went on strike."
"We had a strike of miners at the
Yellaw Aster mine that we broke in
September. On October 1 we resumed
operations with 200 non-union miners,
and have been going ever since. John
F. Berryman, the man who swore to
the complaint, is one of a bunch of
seventeen men who were sent from San
Francisco on December 2 to work at
the mine. Berryman and all of the rest
of them were told by me that there had
been a strike on, that we had broken
the strike and that they could go to
work provided they were non-union
men. The first time he called at my
office Berryman was accompanied by
three other men. They replied then:
" 'Oh, we're not union men.'
John D. Ackerman when interviewed
last night at his residence in Oakland
said:
TUCSON, Ariz., Dec. 16.â A count of
the prisoners in the Tombstone Jail this
morning revealed the fact that "twenty
had escaped last night along with Stiles
and Alvord. Of these one returned, but
none of the others have been captured,
although the chase Is a hot one and
every officer in the line country has
been pressed Into service. United States
Marshal McCord, who is still at Tucson,
will ask the Department of Justice for
authority to organize a party here, as
Tucson has become the headquarters
for those engaged in the chase. At least
one party of the escaped prisoners has
been traced to the Huachuca Moun
tains, and another is believed to be
headed in that direction.
Stiles and Alvord were both seen
shortly after daybreak this morning by
an Indian who was trailing them. He
came to Huachuca siding at 6 o'clock
and reported that the two desperadoes
had passed him, going toward the Hua
chuca Mountains. They did not see
him, as he concealed himself behind a
monster cactus. Both escapes were
mounted and armed with rifles and re
volvers. A posse under Deputy Sheriff
McDonald arrived at Huachuca siding
from Tombstone two hours afterward
and Immediately took up the trail of
the fugitives.
One of the posse returned to Fair
bank late this afternoon and reported
that some of the outlaws had been sur
rounded in the Huachuca Mountains.
Later a report was received announc
\ ing that the men had succeeded in es
i caplng the posse and are now riding to
; ward the Gunsight district.
Jack Virgin, a deserter from the
navy, who was in jail and among the
: escaped prisoners, followed them for a
mile and then returned. He says that
Stiles and Alvord went straight to a
point jn the gulch behind the jail,
where horses and arms were wailing
them. They then mounted and desert
ed the rest of the prisoners The others
divided in two parties. One is composed
of Jim Bennett. Louis James, Depriest
and O'Brien, the highwaymen: Gould,
the Bowie murderer, and Sailor Brown,
a noted thief. The other party is made
up mostly of Mexicans, who were in
jail for petty offenses. Many of the
latter band are believed to be in, hiding
in prospect holes and old shafts be
tween Tombstone and Bisbee, and un
doubtedly will be captured.
Colonel XV. C. Green of Cananea, So
nora, who was at Bisbee at the time
of the jail break, has taken a personal
interest in the apprehension of Stiles
and Alvord and has offered a handsome
reward for their capture. He wired
Colonel Kosterlltzky, in command of
the rurales at Magdalena, to send out
a troop for the purpose of capturing
Stiles and Alvord or any other prison
ers who attempt to cross the line.
Colonel Kosterlitzky left Magdalena
this afternoon at the head of a troop
of rurales. He goes to the Cierro Pinto
Mountains, a favorite Sonora rendez
vous for Stiles, Alvord and other des
peradces. This section is west of
Npgales and south of the Gunsight
country.

BROWNSVILLE, Or., Dec 16.â An

sale In the Southern Pacific depot last
night, but after drilling a hole in the
top of the strong box and breaking off
the combination lock without being
able to open the door, the safecrackers
gave up the Job in disgust.
It Is believed that the cracksmen are

were used prevented any one discover

ler, who is wanted in Colorado to an*
swer a charge of conspiring to commit
arson, but will defer action for two or

from prison nearly a year ago and who
is now in business at Bakersfield. The
object In granting the pardon is to re

Southern California petitioned the Gov
ernor for clemency. By the commuta
tion granted Yanes will be released the
first Monday in December, 1906.

STOCKTON, Dec. 16.â A deputy
United States Marshal passed through
Stockton to-day to serve copies of the
injunction issued from the Federal
court in San Francisco on the 150 strik
ing miners at Hodson. The officer
reached the Royal Consolidated mine
about 5 o'clock this evening and began
service of the papers.
A telephone message from the mine
this afternoon announced that all was
quiet, but that trouble was feared as
soon as the strikers had been served
with the injunction and the mine made
an attempt to reopen. One hundred
and sixty strikers and sympathizers are
camped about the mine. They main
tain a complete picket line around the
property and have allowed no one to
pass the line except the mine officials.
The mine has a guard of five watch
men, armed with repeating rifles. The
engineers have remained on duty and
the pumps are running. It was fur
ther stated that the strikers had at
lost learned of the injunction against
them and that they seemed consider
ably worried, but inclined to be de
fiant. An attempt will be made to re
open the mine with non-union help
brought in from outside points. It is
stated that arrangements have been
made to ser.d in a crew of men to
morrow.
The United States Marshal will serve
the injunction to-night and to-morrow,
and if the strikers thereafter disobey
the court order warrants for their ar
rest for contempt of court will follow.

"The company is doing its utmost to
hasten the payment of the extra money

Before the wage demands of the men
were submitted to arbitration the com

Its thanks to the company. The task

BERLIN, Dec. 16.â Owing to his mis
treatment of soldiers on 150 counts and
abuses of authority on 100 counts a non
commissioned officer named Franzeje
of the Eighty-fifth Infantry has been
sentenced to five years' imprisonment
and dishonorable discharge from the
army by a court-martial held at Reds
burg. The court declared Franzeje had
displayed the "brutality of an ox
driver."
One witness who had run his head
against a wall until he dropped uncon
scious the seventh time was asked by
the Judge:
"Why did you do such a senseless
thing?"
"An officer told me to do so," was the
reply.
"But he had no right to order you to
do such a thing," said thie Judge.
"I had to obey," replied the witness.
"If I had not he would have reported
me for insubordination."
Franzeje had a favorite stick, which
he called "Friedrich Wilheim." This
he broke while beating a private, and
he got another and christened it "Fred
erick the Great," who, he said, was
"the best sergeant the Prussian army
ever had."

STATE LUNACY COMMISSION

STOCKTON. Dec. 16.â At a quarterly
meeting of the State Commission in
Lunacy and the superintendents of the
State hospitals for the Insane to-day

ALAMEDA. Dec. 16.â "And what will
the roosters do then, poor things?'
might well be asked of the future of
local chanticleers, as it was of Cock
Robin in the nursery rhyme, if the or
dinance that is now before the City
Trustees, and which will practically ex
ile the crowers from the municipality,
is passed. Not only will the chickens
have to take a back roost, but gabbling
geese, quacking ducks, squawking
night herons and gobbling turkeys will
also have to move If the measure be
comes the law of this island. ' mterest
ed residents have â¢ deluged the City
Trustees with a request to amend the
ordinance so that the voice of the
braying donkey will not be heard in the
city and that the night-prowling bac
chanalian tomcats will be forced to
seek other back yard fences than those
situate and lying within the corporate
limits of the city of Alameda, whereon
to raise meows to high heaven and at
the same time raise the Ire of all who
hear the hair-elevating discord. Grunt
ing pigs and dumb rabbits likewise
have enemies here and these persons
are endeavoring to persuade the City
Trustees that the proposed ordinance
should be framed to prohibit the pres
ence of such animals in Alameda, ..-x
cept In the form of pork, ham and ba
con, or rabbit stew. Here ! are what
some representative citizens think
about the now famous anti-poultry or
dinance and the proposed amendments:
Judge R. B. Tappanâ I think this asi
tation could be settled by having chick
ens licensed the same as dogs. Rib
bons of various colors could be fastened
about the necks of the roosters and
hens, or, better yet, metallic bands
could be put on their feet. I would not
favor taxing cockerels or pullets until
they were several months old and knew
enough to run when one threw a chunk
of coal at them. I must confess that 1
like chickens, but particularly so when
they are dished up in savory brown
gravy.
Senator E. K. Taylor. Mighty Wong
of the Whljte Highbindersâ It grieves
me to see so much opposition develop
ing against chickens and pigs. Both
make ui> the favorite dishes of the
Highbinders and if we are to be de
prived of them it will be demoralizing
to our appetites. The City Trustees
will strike a solar plexus blow at Ala
meda's unique Oriental organization if
they deport poultry and swine.
George J. Fosterâ I am against cats
and have been that way since I was
able to throw rocks. It matters not
to me, however, if the poultry ordinance
is bo amended as to prohibit the keep
ing of felines in the city. At our house
we have an anti-cat statute that is in
force both in the front and back yards.
We have traps and spring guns to up
hold the law and down the cats. In
the last six months nineteen of these
yowling disturbers have gone into our
deep hole whence no cat returns.
Captain M. W. Simpsonâ I like chick
ens better in a pie than I do in a
back yard. As I am interested in this
fowl ordinance, however, it would not
be fair for me to say too much about
the matter at present.
Judge F. S. Gone: â No pigs should be
permitted within the. corporate limits
of Alameda until they have first seen
the butcher. Ducks have always been
a favorite bird with me, although I
will admit that there are many quacks
about them. As to. the chickens â well
that is a different lay-j-one that I am
not prepared to hand down nn opinion
on.
City Marshal John Conradâ My pet
fowl Is the jailbird. With thickens I
have naught to do except when I mix
with them occasionally in a restaurant.
It .is up to the Board of Health and the
City Trustees to "run in" or run out of
town- all roosters that disturb the peace
and ganders that gabble at everybody.
Edward Deanâ I am for amending
the poultry ordinance so that It will
require the owners of brayjng donkeys
to muzzle the ' beasts berore they go to
bed. If this is not done it will: be
hardly worth my while to go to bed,
as there Is one of the long-eared and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash.. Dec. 16.â News
reached here to-night of the arrest in
San Francisco of William Hoyt. who
is wanted by the police on a charge of
robbery- He is accused of robbing
Mrs. S. S. Stetson, mother of G. W.
Stetson and W. C. Stetson of the Stet
son Post Mill Company, of $80 and then
locking her in her home, where she re
mained without aid for forty-eight
hours.
His wife, who was employed as a
companion by Mrs. Stetson, and whom
he forced to accompany him from tha
house at the tlrrfe of the robbery at
the point of a revolver, arrived here
last Saturday in company with her
father. J. H. Oridley of Madison. She
has been residing In Portland ever
since leaving Seattle and has done all
in her power to cause the arrest of her
husband " since she has known she
would be protected from him. She will
be the principal witness against Hoyt
when he is brought here for trial. Last
spring Mrs. Hoyt was employed as
companion for Mrs. Stetson, who la
more than 70 years of age. In order
that she would be satisfied her hus
band was given quarters In the house.
The three were the only occupants.
Early in July Hoyt learned that Mrs.
Stetson had $80 locked in her trunk.
He broke open the trunk, it is alleged,
and stole the money. Returning down
stairs, he told his wife to get ready to
leave the place in a hurry. She de
murred, and the husband placed a re
volver to her head, telling her to obey
without question. Before going Hoyt
lc-cked all the doors of the place. When
Mrs. Stetson missed them she found
herself locked in. In her feeble condi
tion she was unable to unlock any of
the windows and was forced to remain
a Drlsoner until the arrival of her son.
W. C- Stetson, forty-eight hours after
the robbery.
The Hoyts were traced to Portland
through Gridley. the woman's father,
and Hoyt having deserted his wife and
gone on to San Francisco, she was more
than willing to return and tell her
story. Her fathÂ»r was sent after her
and she will remain with him at Mad
ison until Hoyt's trial. Detectives will
leave for San Francisco to-morrow
after Hoyt.
Hoyt was arrested on the corner of
Mission and Third streets last nighc
and locked up in the City Prison pend
ing the arrival of an officer from Se
attle.

Mrs. Samuel Percy, a widow residing
in the Allendale tract, near Fruitvale,
is not the kind of woman that pokes
her head under the pillows and screams
when burglars are about during the
midnight hours. Far from that. When
a prowling thief tried early this morn
ing to make his way into the Percy
bedchamber, the undaunted occupant,
I awakened qy the. fumbling at the door.
| Jumped from her couch with a pistil at
hand, and sent a couple of big leaden
bullets through the door paneling.
Following the shots Mrs. Percy ran
'to the door, opened it and was disap
pointed to find the target at which she
had blindly fired was gone. Still de
termined to get the prowler if she
could, the woman hurried through the
house, but the burglar had fled, leaving
not a trace behind him except the
opened back door through which he
had disappeared.
After a thorough search Mrs. Percy
reloaded , her pistol and returned to
rest. Constable Tom Carroll was noti
fied, but there was nothing to be done.
Mrs. Percy declares she is competent to
protect her own home, even if she is a
widow and alone.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 16.â Circumstances
surrounding the arrest of Henry James,
a boy, on a charge of embezzling $10
from J. D. Rogers, publisher of the
Alameda Tidings, have caused Jus
tice of the Peace F. S. Cone to request
District Attorney Allen to make a
thorough investigation of the case.
Particularly has Judge Cone urged that
there shall be a complete inquiry into
the reasons why Attorney Howard K.
James swore to a complaint charging
his namesake with crime, when Rogers,
the client, disavows the lawyer and
bill collector's actions therein.
According to the complaint on file in
Judge Cone's court, Attorney James
swore that the $10 was embezzled while
the boy was in Rogers' employ. Now
comes the accused youth and denies
flatly that he was ever in Rogers' em
ploy. The boy denies any embezzle
ment, but says he owes Rogers $5 bal
ance due on a $10 loan.
Rogers is unwilling to assume re
sponsibility for young James' arrest.
.Attorney James Insists that the pro
ceeding is regular, and says he invites
full investigation.
THE BOY'S STORY.
Henry James says that some time ago
he borrowed $10 from Rogers to pay
his way to Sacramento and upon re
turning paid back ?5. Subsequently he
met Ropers, who asked him if he would
pay the balance before Christmas and
he said he thought he would be able to.
Then Howard K. James had his name
sake arrested and the boy declares the
collector said to him 5n court: "I have
influence and it will be easier for you
to dig up than to fight the case." The
boy says he always intended to pay
the S5 due and that Rogers told him
he did not authorize Howard K. James
to have him arrested, thus making it
appear to the world that he was an
embezzler.
II. K. JAMES' SIDE.
City Justice R. R. Tappan. to whom
the young defendant went for advice,
after investigating the proceedings,
said the plac-iner of a stigma of crime on
the boy was a disgraceful act. "This
affair should be probed to the bottom
and I for one will lend all the assist
ance within my power," he said.
J. D. Rogers said he had loaned
Henry James money at various times
and that the hoy had invariably paid it
back. 'He had not yet paid hack all
that was loaned him on the last occa
sion, Rogers raid. Ho would not say
that he authorized Howard K. James
to accuse Henry Jamts of embezzle
ment in his effort to collect $5 from
him.
Howard K. James said: "Henry
James was employed by Rogers to get
certain money and turn it over to Rog
ers, but he did not. Instead of doing
so he decamped with the funds. When
I had him arroste'd he wanted to square
the action and I told him that if he
would arrange to repay the money and
prove that he had no criminal intent
I would ask the court to dismiss the
charge."
Justire of the Peace F. S. Cone re
lates his connection with the matter
thusly: "Howard Â«K. James made out
the complaint against Henry James
and swore to it before me. To-day he
wanted to amend it so that the amount
alleged to have been embezzled would
read $rÂ». I told the collector that I was
not satisfied that all was straight in
his proceeding fhus far and set the en
tire matter for hearing to-morrow at 9
o'clock. Young James was closeted
with J. D. Rogers, H. K. James and
Attorney M. W. Simpson to-day and
afterward called upon me and wanted
me to permit him to withdraw his plea
of not guilty and plead guilty. I would
not permit any such action. I have no
tified the District Attorney's office of
the case and to-morrow -expect to give
the whole proceeding a thorough legal
airing."

The speech referred to the death of

Captain Fenton, with headquarters
aboard the Preble, has general charge
of the getting ready for sea and will
command the Preble and Paul Jones
when they go southward. Captain Mac-
Arthur has temporary command of the
Paul Jones, and is likely to be relieved
and returned to his regular duty as
soon as the preliminaries of the voyage
are completed. Each vessel has a full
crew of sixty-nine men, and a finer
looking lot of Jackies were never con
gregated.
"They are fairly itching to get deep
water beneath them," said Captain
Fenton yesterday, as he proudly - sur
veyed the sturdy figures In .blue dun
garee and white caps that paced the
Preble's deck or stood in groups talk
ing and smoking. "The outlook for

pation. And I'll confess that I feel a
little that way myself."
It may be fitJy termed their maiden
voyage that the Preble and the Paul
Jones are being prepared for, as their
farthest trip from this port has extend-
I ed only to Monterey. The other mem
i ber* of the model trio, the Perry, has
been as far as Santa Barbara, how
ever, and may also be sent to Panama,
j as she is in commission and ready to
put to sea at a day's notice. Captain
Fenton has commanded the. Perry
since her trial trip was made, and had
the honor of driving her at a 28 1 / 4-knot
clip when she conveyed President
Roosevelt from this city to Mare Island
and return last May.
"We can keep the Preble and the
j Paul Jones at equal speed from here
i to Panama if necessary," said Captain
\ Fenton, "for they and the Perry are
unquestionably the finest boats of their
class in the world. They will probably
be used as scouts for the fleet at the
isthmus. And in this connection," the
captain said, with a gratified eye twin
kle, "I am Dleased to announce that
they are not likely to be utilized for
police service, because their length, 250
feâ¬t, would make them rather difficult
to turn in the river. If they engage In
any warlike work at all It will be the
real give-and-take thing that the sail
orman loves as much as he dislikes pa
trol duty."
Captain Fenton's pride in his craft
and its two sisters is certainly expli
cable to any one who inspects the
boats. Thev are all of the same di
mensions, horsepower and armament.
Each is 250 feet in length, 23& feet
beam, 10 feet draught, 700 tons dis
placement and has 9000 horsepower, or
two-third?' as much as the big battle
ship Wisconsin. To accommodate the
coal bunkers, boilers and engines nec
essary to generate this tremendous pro
pulsive force the Preble, for example,
has very little room for anything else
COMMANDER OF MARINES.
WHO IS -RECRUITING A
NEW BATTALION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.â Brigadier
General George F. Elliott, commandant
of the marine corps, may be ordered to
the isthmus to make a reconnaissance
of the country, and should the situa
tion demand it to assume command of
the marine forces there. The matter
has not yet been decided, but it was
said by a higrh ofllcial of the Xavy De
partment to-day that the subject was
receiving serious consideration. If Gen
eral Eliiott Is ordered to the isthmus he
probably will go south on the Dixie,
which 'will sail from Colon to-morrow
for Philadelphia to bring back the new
battalion of marines, which is to be
known as the Caribbean Sea division.
The decision to send General Elliott
will depend largely upon whether he
can be spared here at this time.
At the instance of Secretary Moody,
General Elliott has issued orders for
the formation of the Caribbean Sea
battalion. This battalion will be regu
larly attached to the Caribbean Sea
Squadron, though its jmmedlate des
tination is Colon. It will be assembled
at Philadelphia as rapidly as possible.
That the proper courtesy may not be
lacking, either to Minister Beaupre or
to the Colombian Government, it is ex
pected at the Navy Department that
Rear Admiral Coghlan will proceed to
Cartagena in command of a small
squadron to convey the Minister to
Colon, whence he will Eall for the
United States.
It was said at the Xavy Department
that the question of placing a warship
at the disposal of General Rafael
Reyes, the Colombian Special Envoy,. to
convey him home when he shall have
completed his mission had not yet been
taken up by the State or Xavy de
partments. The Xavy Department is
prepared to respond promptly in case
the State Department decides to offer
General Reyes this courtesy.
The cruiser Olympia, which has un
dergone repairs at the Xorfolk Xavy
Yard, will sail to-morrow for Colon for
service as the flagship of Rear Admiral
Coghlan, commanding the Caribbean
squadron. It is probable that the May-
Rower, now serving as flagship, will
come to Washington on being relieved
hy the Olympia at Colon.
Africa, because the Dutch population
there is increasing, wnile the British ,

would Great Britain give for 9,000,000
negroes as peaceable and as loving as
those in thi3 country? These men give
us about ll.OOO.OOb bales of cotton every
year, and this I contend helps make
the United States the most powerful
nation in the world. Suppose a fleet of
British warships should attack us. The
President, aa commander in chief of the ,
army and navy, need only raise his
hand and say, stop exporting cotton,
and the war would be won.

me to the opinion that no political
measure can ever save or. benefit the
negro. The Hampton Institute shows
the only useful solution." \

Referring to elections in Lewisham
and Dulwish. Chamberlain said that
even the Duke of Devonshire's enclyci
'Â¦al did not possess pontifical author
ity. He said that even former Chan
reilor of the Exchequer Ritchie was not
entitled to more authority than was
to be derived from the fact that he
had for a few months been under the
influence of the permanent officials of
thÂ«Â» treasury.
Referring to the alleged difficulty of
convincing the colonies, Chamberlain
said:
"Send me as Embassador to the col
onies with full powers. I am perfectly
willing to risk my reputation on being
able not merely to satisfy the colonies
but also to secure from them equal
measures in return."
This challenge %vas greeted with ring-
Ing cheers and cries of "We will!"
The feature of Chambc-rlain's speech
in the Coliseum was the announcement
of the fact that he has been engaged in
petting together a committee to make
inquiries among: the various branches
of trad? at homo and abroad, the work
of which committee he expected, he
said, will result in clearing away many
difficulties. The committee will consist
of about thirty business men of the
highest standing, who will begin their
work in the n^ar future. It will be
composed of men from all centers of in
dustry both in the United Kingdom and
in the colonies. Sub-committees will be
formed to deal with each branch of
tra.<3e and to take exhaustive evidence,
meeting twice weekly until their work
Is finished. When the reports are com
pleted. Chamberlain said, he expected
io be in a position to formulate a tariff
bill acceptable to the country, which
will not only foster imperial trade, but
-.vhich will enable Great Britain to give
trade advantages to those who are
prepared to render her similar favors.
Continuing. Chamberlain said:
"We have zone a long way in the
direction of forming a commission, not
an official commission, but a non-po
litical commission of experts, to con
sider the present condition of imperial
trade and to find remedies for its de
fects. This commission will comprise
the leading representatives of every in
dustry and every croup of industries.
It will consist of representatives from
India, the crown colo-nie's and the grreat
self-governing colonies. It will invite
before it witnesses from every trade
and industry, and after hearing all of
th^m the commission will frame a mod
Â«*1 tariff measure. When the Govern
ment is ripe for action a tariff bill
n-jll be presented on which the public
will have every opportunity of express
ing its opinion."

frerlain addressed two immense au
diences here to-night, making the last
speeches of his fiscal campaign for the

From the moment of Chamberlain's
arrival In Leeds the enthusiasm was
tremendous and many demonstrations
were made in the streets. The appear
ance of Chamberlain on the piatform,
accompanied by Mrs. Chamberlain and
a number of the North Country gentry
and members of the House of Com
mons, was the signal for an ovation
which continued for many minutes.
The first speech was made in the
Coliseum, and was listened to by 3000
persons, and a similar number attend
ed the overflow meeting held afterward
In the Town Hall, which was altogether
inadequate to accommodate the great
crowd seeking admission.

after having crossed the Jeleh Pass
at 14,380 feet above the sea level and
reached Riuchaingong, on its way to
the Chumbi Valley, met with immense
transport difficulties. The cold was
intense, 36 degrees of frost being reg
istered, but the Indian troops with
stood the cold well. The Indian bul
lock transports suffered and anthrax
broke out among the Nepalese bul
locks.

At 4:45 the vote on the final passage
of the bill was taken. President Pro
Tern. Frye announced the passage of
the bill by a vote of 57 to 18. j? The vote
in detail follows: â¢
RESULTS OF THE VOTE.
"I have no patience with a mug
wump," he said, and added: "When a
man thinks he knows more than his
party he should get out of the party.
For him to remain after reaching such
a conclusion must be bad either for' him
or his party"
Again addressing the Republican
side of the chamber and leaning far
over the aisle toward the Republican
Senators, most of whom were in their
seats and giving, him their closest at
tention, he said:
"I do not wonder that you look wor
ried. You will get no help from us.
You have been getting it, and always
have been able to .find some one over
here who was wilHng v to ma"ke an hon
orable exception, to use the language
of the Senator from Wisconsin, and
vote for anything you might ask them
to vote for. But you will get no more
of our votes."
He concluded this feature of his ad
dress by asking to be pardoned . for
publicly rejoicing over a prospect of
party unity, and said that his present
attitude must be explained by his
great disappointment over the lack of
unity in the recent past. He believed
that with a return to the conditions
before' the war the party would again
return to its successes of that time.
jC.epublican Senators have been able to
'jnite on measures without a party reso
lution and when a man bolted he was
| shot on the soot. They have carried
; party discipline to the point of abject
j submission^ we have pursued our
! course to the point of insubordination.
! Now, I say that, in the future, when
Â¦ your measures are right, you will have
; the solid Democratic vote; if you are
' not right, -we will oppose you."
I He appealed to Spooner to. know if
j that was not the correct proposition,
J but the .Wisconsin Senator replied in
i the negative, expressing the opinion
that Senators should vote as they think
and as two-thirds of their party
caucus may direct. This expression of
} opfhion brought out the statement from
! Bailey that this opinion had not been
' exemplified in Spooner's official life, be
j cause he said there had been many in
i stances in which Spooner had pointed
out the obnoxious features of measures
and afterward had voted for them.
Â¦ Spooner replied by calling Attention
j fo his vote on the Ha-.vaiian bill and
j the ship subsidy bill, but Bailey assert
i ed that Spooner's party had always
! been able to secure his vote whenever
{ needed to save a party measure. Bai
' ley then entered on a defense of unity of
1 action on party measures, calling at
| tention to the party's long retention in
j power when united before the Civil
War.

The testimony of Secretary Root is
practically the only defense that has
been made of General Wood in the
hearing, which has extended since
about the beginning of the extra ses
sion of Congress. This testimony, how
ever, covered the entire range of evi
dence produced against General Wood,
and was supported in many instances
with correspondence and other data
subsequently taken from the records
at the War Department covering the
period of General Wood's administra
tion as Governor General of Cuba.
Â¦ Secretary Root undertook to assume
the whole responsibility fdr the orders
issued by General Wood affecting the
judicial system in Cuba and concerning
the concession granted to the Jai Alal
Company at Havana. He justified the
acceptance by General Wood of the
present of a silver set from the Jai
Alai Company.
Secretary Root was asked especially
about the charge which Major Rath
bone made that General Wood had in
fluenced the courts in the prosecution
of Rathbone and had tampered with
the courts. The Secretary explained at
some length tho court system in Cuba,
saying that the court of first instance
was in reality an officer directed to
prosecute' and to obtain evidence. He
was something like a Grand Jury in
finding evidence, but was further em
powered to go out and obtain evidence,
mingle with the people, procure affi
davits and 'otherwise collect evidence
against alleged offenders. He said he
knew what General Wood.-iva3 doing in
this case and approved it. The Secre
tary said that, in fact, he directed that
the prosecution of the offenders be vig
orous and General Wood was acting
under orders from the War Depart
ment. _
The Secretary took up the sobject of
the Jai Alai Company concession and
said that this was not a gambling
company nor was the game pelota,
played under the management of the
company, a gambling game any more
than was a horse race or a game of
baseball. Men could bet on the results
as upon other games of skill. He said
that the concession or right of the Jai
Alai Company was granted before the
American occupation and that the con
cession for which General Wood had
been criticized was for an addition to
the building of the company. The only
question in, regard to this grant was
whether or not it would be contrary to
the Forcker amendment. The whole
question was referred to the War De
partment by General Wood. The sub
ject was first considered by Judge Ma
goon, law officer of the Bureau of In
sular Affairs, who, after a mostj care
ful review of the case, had held that
the extension did not come within the
Foraker amendment preventing the
granting of a franchise in Cuba. The
Secretary said he reviewed Judge Ma
goon's opinion and came to the same
conclusion. The authority granted to
the company was then approved by the
War Department, so that General
Wood in this matter acted under the
instructions and with the approval of
the War Department.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.â The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs to-night
concluded its investigation of the
charges against General Leonard Wood
filed for the purpose of preventing his
confirmation as major general. Secre
tary Root was the only witness to-day.
He was on the stand' for two and a half
hours at the forenoon session and oc
cupied the attention of the committee
to-night from 8 until 11:20 o'clock. The
committee will meet to-morrow to pre
pare its report. It is understood con
firmation will be recommended by a
vote of 8 to 2.
A minority report will be made by
the opposing members of the commit
tee.
Bailey* dlpcussed at; some length the
attitude of the Democratic Senators to
ward'the reciprocity provision of the
McKlnley law add the fact that the
party had divided on this and other,
matters.
"But," he said." turning toward the
Republican side of the chamber, "ypu
will hereafter get no Senators' votes
for the White House on this side of
the chamber. You will have to take
care of yourselves in the future."
This statement was accepted as a di
rect reference to the decision of the
Democratic caucus to stand as a unit
on all measures agreed upon by a two
thirds vote of the caucus, and aroused
quick interest.
"Why?" asked Aldrich, and he asked
the question two or three times before
Bailey could reach the end of his sen
tence. While. the auery,was being put
and reiterated Bailey was proceeding
to say that "when the reason was suf
ficient and when House measures were
good they would get all the Democratic
votes'.'*'' Then he made reply to Al
drlch's request for an explanation of
the reasons for the statement just
made. The first thought evidently was
that a sententious reply only was nec
essary.
"The Senator knows, why." he said.
Then, after a moment's thought, he
repeated, "The Senator knows," and
added: "In some waV or. another "the
. Bailey;*. then, discussed the constitu
tional questions involved in -the bilUf
maintaining 'that- the. House had the
exclusive right to originate revenue leg-'
islation and . had no . power- ovef
treaties*; - ' .' . ; . â¢
"I resent." he said, "the motion that j
the executive can follow a bill into tho t
Senate, and, I fcave never known an'
executive who violated his own oflice '
by invading other departments of the
government."
He added, however, that he, with ',
others, had resented the propaganda of \
a year ago in the interest of. reciprocity.-]
"I did not," he said, "like to receive .
communications from officers of the
United States serving in Cuba instruct- Â¦
Â¦ ing us as to our duty."
.Spooner also â¢ discussed the effect of i
the adoption by Cuba of the Platt
amendment as a- part of the Cuban
constitution, .and said it should remain
there forever for Cuba's own protec -
I tion, both as against foreign foes jy.irf'
against insurrection. He conte.n/led
that the Platt measure in nrv
derogated from Cuba's independence.
He expressed the opinion tivat the
United States owned the Isle o7 Pines.
The Cubans also thought thpy owned
it, he said, but we had no^ opened a
bank account with the GocV^.ess of Lib
erty when we freed Cub/>, and could
not afford to haggle likr,. a shopkeeper
over matters with that. republic.
OBJECTS TO TRE^i' y METHOD.
Senator Hoar said-he did not, how
ever, believe in the r/c/iicy of treaties af
fecting the tariff, ,y n <l contended that
direct legislation /iy&s easier-of accom
plishment than vV.e exchange of treat
ies. Hoar also -hid that because of his
opposition to th{ s method he had found'
it difficult, fo /y'ecure his" own assent to
support- the /bill. He objected to the
claim. that /^romises had been made to,
Cuba, -amy/confessed that he had not ;
looked w/fn favor upon the statement
made byAhe President in his message!
to. the that a. failure to. pass the
bill wfirjid- amount almost to a breach:
*of fa'/yd. SUll; he added, he did not in- ;
tend/,',.o let this objection interfere with
his Support of. '.the bill
B/ailey took exception to the state
ment made by Spooner to the effect
Hhat he (Bailey) had been influenced j
toward protection because of his inter
'est in the cattle "business of his State.
"I disclaim any sympathy ' with any
bill and disavow any opposition to any
} bill affecting any , interest .of. my own
j State, because of sentiment in that
State favorable to protection,' 1 he said.
Bailey explained his position on all
matters relating to tariff and said that
he. favored tariff- for jrevenue only.
Spoctier disavowed any intention of
impugning the motives- of ;Bailey.
THREAT /FROM 1.DEMOCRACY.
Spooner declared that none of the
Senators had surrendered their inde
pendence, and he did not consider such
a charge as courteous to fellow Sen
ators.
Teller referred to the influences be
hind the bill, which he said were those
rot only of the sugar trust, but those
ot the executive officers.
TELLER NETTLES SPOONER.
Spooner in opening the debate to-day
replied to the charge that the bill was
in the interest of the sugar trust, re
ferring to the differing motives attrib
uted by the opponents of the bill to the
Senators who favored it.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â By a vote
of 57 to 18 the Senate to-day passed
the bill carrying into effect the reci
procity treaty with Cuba. The flnal
vote came at the close of the day,
which was marked by a debate which
while at all times animated was never
acrimonious, i The principal speeches
were made^by Spooner for the bill and
by Bailey against it.-.
The bill passed carries into execution
the treaty between the United States
and Cuba which was ratified last
March. The treaty provides for a re
duction of 20 per cent from the rates
of duty under the pingley law on all
Cuban articles imported into the United
States, and a varying reduction of from
29 to 40 per cent from the established
Cuban duty on articles into Cuba from
the United States.
During the Closing Debate
Bailey Gives Notification of
Democratic Decision to Ad
here to Caucus Rule Hereafter
"One of the greatest enemies of or
panized labor." he declared, "is Car
roll D. Vv'right. ,with his distorted fig
ures."
Ke d<Â»clarpd that there should be no
Rockefellers or Carnegies.
"After a treaty by \rhieh Vft'. gen
erously gave ten millions at their de
mand had been rejected with a bald
and palpaWe spirit of blackmailing us
out of fifteen millions more, the gentle
man from Arkansas says he would
yield it. I will certify that all the
Democrats and all the Republicans
would give President Roosevelt with
ering execrations and hissing and scorn
if he submitted to that blackmail."
Kitt said the President had been ac
cused of being too slow, then of being
too fast. The President had only done
his duty in preserving peac- on the
isthmus, as he was charged to do un
der the treaty. There was no other
authority on the isthmus with which
to negotiate a treaty than that recog
nized.
Llvernash of California spoke on the
labor question. He said iabor believed
that some great wrong principle ex
isted which needs remedying. It had
been propose*! that a Congressional
committee be appointed to make a
careful inquiry, but he did not want
such an inQuiiy as would b? made by
the Department of .Justice, which, he
arr-crted. persecuted some rittle concern
inFtead of the Standard Oil or sugar
trust, the very air of which was pollut
ing. Nor. he added, such reports as j
would he made by the Department of j
Commerce and Labor. Ke si^oke of i
them as '"kid glove" reports , because, ,'
he raid, he saw evidence of kid gloves
and not the ax.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 15. âCentral
American affairs were discussed in the
House 'to-day and also pensions. Indus
trial and agricultural conditions and
labor. The session lasted more than
four hours, the House being in commit
tee of the whole almost the entire time
on the pension appropriation bill, on
â¢which r.o conclusion was reached.
Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas, replying
to remarks made by Hitt last week,
said he had not charged the adminis
tration with lawlessness in jegard to
Panama, but had conscientiously de
srribed the act as he understood it to
have been done. He renewed his con
tention that it was the duty of the
Presldest to have turned to Nicaragua,
and repeated that the Panama canal
law had been violated. He insisted
that the President had done wrong).
Hitt (R.) of Illinois, "wpiying to
Dinsmore, said: ' 'â¢
Hermitage was roastea alive in view
of other members of the crew, who
were unable to help him. He begged
to be killed and placed out tf his mis
ery. , *
W. E. Williford suffereC both legs
broken and H. J. Kramer was badly
burned and they are believed to be
fatally hurt. The bridge burned under
the wreck and one engine and several
cars went down.
FORT SCOTT, Kans., Dec. 16.â One
man lost his life, two were faially hurt
and several others were more; or less
severely injured in a collision of two
sections of a freight train on a Ions
bridge on the Frisco system south of
Pawnee, Kans., fifteen mile3 from Fort
Scott, early to-day. The rrar section
ran into the forward section. P. M.
Hermitage of Monett, Mo., a brake
man, who was riding on the engine of
the rear train, was pinioned between
the cab and tender and burned to death.
Other members of the crew found them
selves in. precarious positions and were
forced to jump from the h|sh trestle
or be burred to death in the wreckage.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.â As a result
of Minister Irishman's advices respect
ing the Alexandretta affair, the State
Department has requested the Navy
Department to place a warship at the
disposal of Consul Davis, now at Beirut,
upon which he might return to Alex
andretta at his pleasure. The Navy De
partment accordingly cabled instruc
tions to Admiral Cotton, on board the
flagship Brooklyn at Alexandria, Egypt,
to place a vessel at the disposal of,
Davis. It is believed the Brooklyn will
be selected. It is left to the Consul to
arrange the terms of his reception.
Although Rear Admiral Cotton was
not instructed specifically to take the
Consul back to his post under escort of
a squadron, it will not be in opposi
tion to the Navy Department's wishes
if both the flagship Brooklyn and the^
San Francisco proceed to Alexandretta*"
on this mission. It is felt that, in .view
of the indignities offered our Consul,
his return to Alexandretta under the
protection of a squadron might prove ',
more salutory in Its effect than if only
one ship accompanied him. ,
Acting. Secretary of State Adee has
cabled Minister. Leishman to present
the facts to the Turkish Government;
and inform the Government that the |
case is one seeming to Invite an expres-j
sion of regret and reparation.. Th?.
State Department does not indicate th/xt
any measure, of reparation is expected,
but it is expected the Turkish Govern
ment certainly will, by removal or
otherwise, punish the offending Turk
ish officials and compensate At/irian for
the losses and injuries he J.ias sus
tained.
CONSTANTINOPLE. DÂ«-c. 18.â The
Porte ha? complained t<V the United
States that the acting Officials of the
American Corfrulate in- -Alexandretta
are preventing tho. 'embarkation ' of
Atarian, the naturalized American,
whose recent arrcjt caused Consul
Dayis to leave Alexandretta, and for
whom the Porte ir structed the local au
thorities to obtain a passage on an
Italian steamer, at the cost of the Gov
ernment. It 'was thÂ« opinion of the
Porte that ttÂ»e embarkation of Atarian
would rerncve the principal cause of
complain'^
NEW Y.ORK, Dec. 16.â Harper's
Weekly, representing the views of cer
tain powerful financial interests, says
in its. issue to-day:
"That the Ohio Senator (Hanna) is a
candidate at the present moment may
be taken for granted. Whether he will
continue to be will deperid upon his
own judgment and his chance of suc
cess[ He will not wittingly risk the
humiliation of rejection by the party
i of which he has so long 'been the head.
i Meanwhile, v encouraged by his col
leagues in the Senate, he waits, reflect
ing that nothing is lost and much is
gained by holding his possible candi
dacy as a menace over the President.
"The Democratic candidate? Parker,
probably.
"No candidate seriously opposed by
sane business interests has ever yet
been elected President. But would
Roosevelt 'meet with that particular
quality cf opposition â such, for exam
ple, as Bryan had to contend with?
We do-jbt it. RooBevelt has done some
things he ought not to have done, nota
bly 'in the coal strike and in the North
en-.i Securities case, but Judge Parker's
v.ndeslrable ' friend, Hill, was tenfold
'worse in the. former, and as we under-
I stand it, nobpdy in or out of interest
has questioned the propriety of apply
ing a legal test to the great railway
merger. It was the method â a sensa
tional trial by and through the news
papers instead of â¢ In accordance with
serious established legal practice â
â¢wrecking values, jeopardizing fortunes,
checking prosperity, creating doubt
and distrust, rather than inspiring con
fidence in administrative wisdom, that
was and still is bitterly resented. But
it is well know^ that the President rec
ognizes the fact that he erred, regrets
his error and would not be likely to re
peat it. ...
"Summing up â the only chance of
i Democratic success lies in convincing
the people that Roosevelt is unsafe.
i There is -no other issue in sight."

TWO MURDER TRIALS
DRAWING TO A CLOSE
Clarence Cummings. a vicious look
ing negro, who snatched a tie contain
ing a valuable diamond pin from the
neck of Lorenzo Cervelll at Kearny
street and Broadway several nights
ago, was held to trial in the Superior
Court yesterday by Judge Mogan and
his bail fixed at $3000. Cummings at
tempted to escape after he had com
mitted the crime, but ran into the arms
cf Policeman O'Brien.
Annie M. Barthol secured a verdict
for $1000 damages from a jury in
Judge Graham's court yesterday'. She
sued Lizzie B. Fellers and J. A. Mc-
Millen for $1900, claiming that they
had cheated her in a lodging-house
deal. It seems that the defendants
represented to her that the lodging
house at 310 Stockton street was
worth $2500. She paid them that
amount, only to find that it was worth
but $600, and that before she could
have a chance to secure a return on
her investment the building would be
torn down to make room for the new
Pacific-Union Club. Mrs. Barthol was
represented by Attorney Hiram John
son. ., ."
Annie Bnrthol Gets Damages.
Lee Banks, the colored corporal of
the Ninth Cavalry, who assaulted
two women on Kearny street Mon
day night, was sentenced to pay a
fine of $100 or serve fifty days in jail by
Judge Mogan yesterday. The Judge
told the defendant that the only thing
that saved him from getting six months
in the County Jail on each of the two
charges was the fact that the women
admitted being under the influence of
liquor and were on the street at an
unusually late hour.
Petitions in insolvency were filed
pesterd&y in the United States District
Court by J. S. Witherell of Oakland,
a jeweler and bicycle repairer. He
Dwes $6fe6 and has $324 assets. Law
rence T. Freitas. a clerk of Sacramen

$706 and has no assets.

Harold D. Morse, who says he is an
actor, objected to the flavor of the
truffles served in his pate de fois gras
In a restaurant at Eddy and Powell
streets Tuesday night and nearly
wrecked the establishment before a po
liceman could be secured to suppress
him. He was before Judge Mogan yes
terday to explain matters, but request
ed a continuance until to-morrow, in or
der to secure witnesses. At that time
Judge Mogan will assume the role of
dramatic critic and determine whether
Morse is a good or a bad actor. At
present the defendant is "at liberty" in
a double senseâ he has no engagement
and he is out on bail.
Chief of Police Wittman yesterday
sent Detective Sergeant McMahon to
United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Woodworth to ask his assist
ance in getting rid of the highbinder
element in Chinatowji. The Chief had
four highbinders in custody and de
sired to have them deported should it
be found that they, were illegally in
the United States. Chief Wittman
said that the four Mongols had been
arrested for vagrancy many times,
but that they resumed their old prac
tices as soon as they were released
from jail.
â¢ Mr. Woodworth replied that he
would take pleasure in co-operating
with the Police Department in ridding
the country of the thugs and gun
fighters who infest the Chinese quar
ter. He invited the Chief to sead the
men along to United States Marshal
Shine and he would see that they were
deported, should they be unable to
establish their right to remain in the
country. The men, Dea Seek Xgee,
Lee Chin, Louis Bin and Chin Yin,
were arrested by the Marshal on a
warrant issued by United States Court
Commissioner Heacock charging them
with being illegally in the United
States.

Laura. Trevor, the woman who fought
the gas company to a finish and was
awarded a verdict of acquittal by a
Jury in Judge Mogan's court a few
weeks ago. acting as her own attorney,
is herself invoking the aid of the law.
She had Mrs. Jennie Close arrested
for demolishing s=ix windows in her
Hayes-street candy establishment. The
case was called before Judge Mogan
yesterday, but Mrs. Trevor did not
have any witnesses present to corrob
orate her story of the damage done, so
the case went over until to-day. Mrs.
Close admits doing some damage out
Hayes-street way. but claims Mrs.
Trevor has been trying to win away
the affectfor.s of her husband by all
the feminine wiles she possesses.
E. A. Engleberg, the Sausalito con
tractor who was arrested some time
ago for menacing his wife with a re
volver at the ferry building, told Judge
Conlan yesterday at the preliminary
hearing of the case that his wife had
made a regular, shooting gajlery of him.
He said that on three separate occa
sions during the four years he had been
married to her she had sped bullets at
him. The weai>ori with which he
threatened liis wife, he said, was not In
working orJer and could not be made
to explode a cartridge. Two days pre
vious to the occurrence he testified
that he discovered his wife in an Ellis
street lodging-house in company with
a soldier named Bales. She was in dis
habille, he said, and Bales threatened
him. For that reason he put the use
less revolver in his pocket to frighten
the soldier if he should attempt an as
sault. When he met his wife at the
ferry, he said, she put her hand into
her pocket and he feared she was going
to draw a weapon, so he pulled out his
revolver. Mrs. Engleberg denied that
she had ever shot at her husband, but
Fald she had taken a revolver away
from him several times. Her counsel
did not question her regarding . the
Bales incident.
Judge Conlan started the regular
winter campaign against hobo "mooch
ers" who accost citizens on "the street
for money in such manner as to indi
cate that if their plea is not complied
with they will use force. William Bell,
Mike Lyons, Charles Sparks, Antones
Frietes and John E. Smith, five typical
specimens of this gentry, were given
six months each in \he County Jail
yesterday and like treatment is prom
ised any others who come before him.

Private Charles R. Holden, an insane
soldier, while being taken from the Pre
sidio to the East Jumped through a
window of the car in which he was
confined and was instantly killed.
It has been the custom at the Pre
sidio to retain the Insane patients at
the post until the number amounts to
ten or twelve. They are then sent on
to the Government asylum at St. Eliza
beth, D. C, In charge of a commis
sioned officer and a guard of enlisted
men.
In the present instance Major W. P.
Kendall, the commanding officer of the
United States General Hospital, was
about to make a trip East to select
the surgical apparatus for the new pa
vilion and decided that he would take
charge of the afflicted patients himself.
A special car was chartered, and Major
Kendall, with the ten insane and a
guard of nine enlisted men, started on
the journey Saturday, December 5.
Among the insane prisoners was Pri
vate Holden of the Twenty-seventh In
fantry.
All went well until the third day.
when Holden, who had been suffering
apparently from only a mild case of
dementia, quietly got up from his berth
at 4 o'clock in the morning, dashed
past the guards who were on watch,
made a frantic run for one of the car
windows and leaped out into the dark
ness c-f the morning. The train was
running at the rate of forty miles an
hour and Holden's death was Instan
taneous.
No blame was placed on either Cap
tain Kendall or the^guards under his
command, as the strictest watch pos
sible had been maintained over the un
fortunates in their charge.
Major Duval announced yesterday
that the transport Thomas would leave
for Manila on January 1. For the last
week it has been a question whether
the Thomas or the Sherman would be
the next ship to sail for the Philip
pines.
Since the Thomas arrived in port a
big gang of men has been at work on
her to repair the damage that was
wrought by. the terrific typhoon she
encountered in the China Sea, which
practically demolished the greater part
of her forward upper works. Her re
pairs are now nearly completed and
she will be in first class shape to sail
on New Year's day.
Major General Wade of the headquar
ters of the division of the Philippines

The grounds were so muddy ana
sloppy at the post yesterday that the

Holmes Compromises.
On motion of United States District
Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth
yesterday the suit of the United
States against Samuel Oliver Holmes
was dismissed by Judge de Haven.
Holmes was surety for $200 on the
revenue bond of Tom Hing. Suit was
brought in 1895 to recover on the
bond and Holmes has succeeded in
compromising with the Government
for $50.
Tsoucas Gets Fourteen Months.
James Vsoucas, a Greek, convicted
of counterfeiting, was sentenced yes
terday by United States District Judge
de Haven to serve fourteen months'
imprisonment in the State peniten
tiary at San Quentin. His partners,
Chris Patrikloupoulou and George
Rose, pleaded guilty several months
ago and are serving sentences of one
year in the County Jail.
In the case of Windelin Bauerle. who
k*>pt a shooting gallery at 58 Third
street ar.d whose Fkull was fractured
by a ftreet car on December 11. Charles
Blechen. the gripman. was exonerated.
The jury found that the death of Tab-
Viitt was an accident, and appended the
following to their verdict:
"We censure the proprietors of the
place for not complying with the law
in displaying the proper signs as
required by the ordinance and for leav
ing the mass body three days in the
room without investigating. We feel
that further investigation Is warranted
and that the proper authorities should
rske due notice of the violation of ordi
nance N'o. 57."
Mrs. Heaphy, who keeps a lodging
house at 47 Tehama street, was cen
sured yesterday by a Coroner's jury
in the inquest on the body of Joseph
Tabbitt. a Syrian peddler.
Tabbitt took the room on December
P. ar-d his door remained locked until
the 11th, when his dead body was
found, he having been .suffocated by
illuminating gas. The condition of the
body warranted the assumption on the
part of Autopsy Surgeon Bacigalupi
that he had died on the Sth of Decem
ber. The gas that suffocated him was
Rowing from a burner, the key of which
was only half open.
Mrs. Heaphy swore that when the
bedmaker called at the room on two
mornings she found the door locked
a^id the key on the inside, and that
on the third day while looking through
the keyhole she herself smelled gas
and had the door forced open. In re
plying to a question by Coroner Leland,
Mrs. Heaphy said that she had not
turned eff the cas st the meter and
turned it on again, but that she had
complied with the ordinance prohibit
ing such turning on and off. She ad
mitted, however, that ehe had not pro
vided cards to be hung in the rooms
warning tenants not to blow out the
pas. and said that she had never been
notified to do bo.
On August 6 Busch snatched a hatch
et from Joseph Gueralli at the Fontana
cannery. Bay and Taylor streets, and
while pretending to return it to Guer
alli deliberately struck him on the hand
with the weapon, inflicting a dangerous
wound. Busch declared he would kill
Fontana if he had him arrested for the
crime.
Busch is a comparatively. young man
and is looked upon by the police as one
of the most desperate characters com
ing under their observation. He was
arrested last January with William
Peterson for entering the grocery and
saloon of Fritz Heinecke. 1133 Filbert
street. While Peterson covered the
proprietor with a revolver Busch rifled
the till. Heinecke made a move to go
to an inner room and Peterson fired a
shot at him. Peterson was acquitted
by a jury in Judge Lawlor's court and
the Judge dismissed the cage against
Busch for lack of identification.
Jchn Busch, who pleaded guilty in
Judge LawloVa court to two charges of
robbery, was sentenced yesterday to
serve twenty-five years in San puen
tin. There were two prior convictions
against him, one for petty larceny and
the other for grand larceny.
Busch was known as "the terror of
the North Beach." He committed
numerous robberies during the month
of August and the two to which he
pleaded guilty were the holding up of
Walter Young on the night of August
11. at Green and Montgomery streets,
when he took from Young his coat and
vest, $1 05 and a silver ring, and the
holding up of Frank O'Donnell, assist
ant commercial editor of The Call," on
the night of August 14 and taking

Andrew Moore, a marine fireman,
was before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
morning to answer to a charge of bur
glary. The complaining witness was
Mrs. Francis Schluter, who lives aj 1
Jackson street. She was ' awakened
at 1 o'clock yesterday morning by
hearing a noisj in an adjoining room
and on examination she discovered the
defendant leaning over an open drawer
of a bureau. With great courage she
rushed upon him and caught him Dy
his coat, but he managed to tear loose
from her grasp and escape. In leaviuj;
the house he closed a door upon the
pursuing woman, catching her thumb
and mashing it. Not daunted, she fol
lowed him to the street, where some
passersby held him until the arrival of
a policeman. He was held to trial in
the Superior Court with bail fixed at
$3000.
IGNORES GAS ORDINANCE
TERROR OF NORTH BEACH
Five Chinese children, ranging from
10 to 12 years of age, -were witnesses in
Judge Conlan's court in the case of
Ah Tom, the Chinese Fagin, whose pre
liminary examination took place yes
terday. One of the little fellows testi
fied that he stole ten 520 gold pieces
from his father and sold them to Ah
Tom for J5 in siiver. He also stole
$300 worth of gold dust and grave it to
the defendant in return for $1 50 in
nickels and dimes. Another youngster
testified to stealing J200 in double
eagles from his uncle, with whom he
lives, and selling them to Ah Tom for
$2 in small coins. Another stole a
watch from his father valued at $60
and delivered it to the defendant, in
return for which he was given two
quarters. Two others told of stealing
valuable jewelty from their parents
and selling it for trifling sums to Ah
Tom. They all testified that the thefts
were made at the suggestion of the
defendant. If he had only been given
time and kids enough It Is probable
that the entire contents of the treasure
chests of Chinatown would have passed
into the possession of Ah Tom. Evi
dently he intended to adopt a gold
standard for himself and elevate the
rest of his countrymen on a silver ba
sis. When he was put on the stand
he contented himself with asserting
that he "no saveyed" the children testi
fying against him. He was bound over
to the Superior Court on the charge
of receiving stolen property and bail
was fixed at J3000. As far as discov
ered Ah Tom had acauired about $800
in cash and jewelry from his youthful
accomplices. The youngster who non
chalantly told of stealing $500 from his
father spent most of the morning turn
ing handsprings around the", corridors
Cf the Hall of Justice. Clerk Jack Rice
found him thus and approached him.
'â¢If I give you a nickel will you go over
and smash that fellow?" pointing to
another of the boys. "Make It a dime
and I'll knock him out.' answered the
youngster. He got the money and near
ly delivered the goods, but one of the
corridor policemen stopped the fight in
time to save a knockout.
to bite his crippled sister. And may
God have mercy on my soul.' " Salvey
repeated the formula and went away
jubilant over his prospective reform.

A temperance crusade was started in
Judge Cabaniss 1 court that should be
noted. John E. Salvey, a veteran of
the Spanish-American war, who re
turned from the service of his country
with a broken constitution and a well
developed thirst, was on trial for steal
ing $40 from Miss Abbie Taylor, an eld
erly woman, who runs a restaurant on
Post street. Miss Tayior did not wish
to prosecute, and said that th^e crime
was committed at a time when. the de
fendant was Irresponsible from ; In
dulgence in drink. The charge of lar
ceny was dismissed, and then Salvey
requested Judge Cabaniss to administer
an oath to him, as he wished to swear
he would ' not take a drink for one
year. The Judge was startled for a
minute. -He reflected that an oath ad
ministered by any one of his boyish
appearance would hardly have the
solemnity necessary to cause a. con
firmed dipsomaniac to say "nay, nay"
to the steam beer advertisements and
put behind him the allurements of the
soothing "Tom. and Jerry." His eye
lighted on Bailiff Neil Carmichael,
stately and Impressive as an old world
cathedral. "Neil," said the Judge, "will
you Jdndly, administer the usual oath
in 6uch cases to this young man?" Car
michael brought the young man around
in front of the desk. "Now hold up
your right hand," he said, "and repeat
after trie, word for word, 'I, John E.
Salvey, do solemnly swear on all I hold
preclousor dear in this life or the here
after that for the space of one year-'I
will not drink, imbibe, absorb or soak

tion of property belonging to religious
oxder,s in France a movement has taken
place which resembles the self-imposed
exile of thousands as the result of the
famous edict of Nantes of Louis XIV
three centuries ago. The London West
minster: Gazette gives some interesting
figures upon the exodus of the monks
and nuns from France. It says: : .f*?t
"As a result of the French- interdic
tion of religious orders England, it is
said, has received about 6000 monks
and nuns. Some 1800 have gone to the
United States and about 1100 to Can
ada. Monks and nuns have come in
about e<:ual numbers to England, and
the convents and monasteries have
been Increased by about C02 by the in
flux. In ' the diocese of Southwark
alone thirty-one new missions have
been opened. Throughout the country
forty-Beven new convent schools were
established last year. The exiles have
brought a considerable .sum of money
Driven From France.
Errors in court procedure may yet unlock the peni
tentiary doors which after extreme difficulty and only
the most persistent endeavor have " been closed upon
the officials that have dishonored the civic history of St.
Louis. The prosecutors should have courage. So
widely spread is the intelligence of the American people
that even by accident some of it of necessity must find
residence in our courts. A second trial might result in an
accident of justice.
France had almost 28,000 more
deaths than births last year, a record
variously interpreted by her publi

outsiders much as if the nation was
in need of an able corps of lecturers
on race, suicide to stump the country
from the Pyrenees to the British
Channel, the Government backing
them up by offering premiums for
large families and decorations for
larger ones, with public honors for
those who play the limit, as it were,

EVENTS arc moving rapidly to' a conclusion of the
Panama affair which will assure the .permanence '.of
the new republic and the speedy construction of
the canal. When part of the territory of a nation by
force separates and achieves independence it is' not bound
to pay any part of the existing debt of the original state.
But Colombia owes a foreign debt, said to amount to
$10,000,000. Recognizing not the law of the -case, but
its equity, President j Roosevelt advises that Panama
bear one-third 'of this obligation, and pay, it by turning
over to Colombia one-third of the $10,000,000 we will pay
for the canal right of way.
This satisfies the foreign .bondholders" of Colombia,
and the indications, are that Marroquin and -Reyes are
willing to sell out- for that suni. As a matter of caution,
gained in everybody's experience with Latin-American
countries, it is advisable that President Roosevelt ar
range for the payment of this money, directly to the for
eign bondholders, for when the cash goes to Bogota it
is doubtful if it "will ever be applied to redemption of the
The United States, by this . action, sustains its good
credit abroad for fair dealing and also brings 'the canal
nearer to accomplishment. * The Democratic Senators
have held a caucus, and voted to control the votes of
all the Senators of that party by caucus action. Expe- j

by digestion.
The process of digestion may bo de
scribed in a -word by saying that the
alimentary apparatus is a complex and
convoluted tube passing through the
body, and that the food, as It moves
onward through this tube, comes in
contact with various fluids, which con

In one sense the most important act
of life is, digestion. Without digestion
life would be Impossible. For the life
of the human body is, in reality, a pro
cess of combustion, a slow burning up,
and digestion is the operation of pro-
Aiding fuel by which this slow combus
tion is maintained. 1
The human body appears to be a fixed
and unchangeable'mass of flesh, blood
and bone. As a matter of fact, how
ever, the body is no more stable than
a cataract, which In form remains un
changeable for ages, but changes the
water composing it uninterruptedly.
The human body presents an appear

Constantly the individual cells are dy

placed by new born cells. Every year
an amount of matter equal to one and
a balf tons in weight passes through
the human body. And at this rate there
must be an entire renewal of the body
in from two to four years.

Manchester has Just lost by death,
says the Westminster Gazette, Its
most remarkable match seller, a
scholarly Armenian, who spent his
days in translating and study at the
Public Reference Library and his
evenings in selling wax matches in the
streets. His richest possession was
Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary, which
he had purchased out of his earnings
as a match seller, and he knew also
ancient and modern Greek. Russian,
Latin, Italian and German. The lit
erary match seller was known only a3
John Light, and why he came to Man
chester nobody ever could find our.
He was a devoted Tolstoyan. rending
and comparing the master's works in
Russian, French end English, and h<?
knew much on the subject of com
parative religions. The literary fa
cilities which he found in Manchester
did much apparently to sweeten his
exile.

An Indiana physician submitted himself the other day
to the knives- of his surgeon friends, and although the
operation, according to the custom in such affairs, was
eminently successful, the patient died upon the table. An
examination revealed the fact that the dead doctor had
a pair of forceps in his abdomen, the result of ah opera
tion, almost as successful, which happened two years
ago. If there is anything in professional fraternity this
should teach us that physicians do not make these mis
takes maliciously, as supposed.
CHRISTMAS is the holiday which demands the
-best of everything â the sunniest of skies, the
lightest of hearts, the acme of good cheer. The
Call feels that it is able to do its part in the festivities
by carrying into the homes of its readers the length and
breadth of the coast the best of modern newspaper art.
It is. therefore as a Christmas greeting that The Call
will present on Sunday next a holiday supplement of
unusual attractiveness.
Artistic excellence will be a notable feature of
the number. The red and green of the holly ' is
thrown into striking prominence in the colored plates
which adorn the covers of the thirty-two pages of holi
day cheer. Â¦ Two full page photographs, emblematical of
the season, and a striking front-page drawing are all re
produced' in a manner as perfect as the engraver's art
can make it.
The reading matter is made of more than usual in
terest by Christmas sketches from the pens of promi.
nent. local divines. Father Sebastian of the Greek or
thodox church has contributed "The Madonna of
Alaska," and Rev. Ernes! Waltz writes of "Sunshine in
the Moonshine Country." "A Circuit Rider's Christ*
mas" is from the pen of Rev. George W. White. "The
Boy Immanuel" is the work of Rev. L. J. Sawyer.
Other stories full of the spirit of the season there are
by; Josephine Dodge Daskam, Madge Morris and Kath
eryn Jarboe. A page is devoted to the discussion of
that delectable subject, the Christmas dinner, and timely
hints are given upon the giving of gifts.
OUR CHRISTMAS SUPPLEMENT.
"I have found this dealing with law
yers an expensive undertaking," said
he. "It has cost me four umbrellas al
ready, to say nothing of the onslaught
upon my morals. I have done nothing
but buy umbrellas and leave them in
my lawyer's office. The other day I
Etopped at one pf the umbrella coun
ters in a big downtown office building,
where there were three piles of um
brellas. One pile was marked $1, the
second pile $2 and the third pile was
marked $3. I did not look beyond the
third Pile, because this, contract was
not yet signed, and I waf not certain
how much money I could afford to
spend. I said to the man in charge
of the umbrellas: 'I am' a stranger
from west of the Mississippi, all un
used to the effete ways of the East.
I came from the wild and hoping West,
and I appeal to you, as man to man,
whether, in your judgment, you being
an Eastern man. and I a stranger on
his first visit to your great city, you
would advise me to buy this $1 um
brella for $1. the $2 umbrella for $2 or
the $2 umbrella for $3? I ask you this
as a pilgrim and a stranger.* And the
man, looking me straight in the eye,
paid: 'As man to man and speaking
heart to heart to you. a stranger, I
would advise rou to buy the $3 um
brellaâMr. Mark Twain.'
"Which shows that a man with a past
can't get away from it â even if he has
become honest enough to buy his own
umbrellas. That is the trouble with
me. ' I can't fool anybody, I am too
pure, too innocent. Everybody takes
advantage of my innocence. It is a
mighty good thing I was not born a
girl."

Clerk of the Supreme Court Frank
Jordan joshes. Once, though, he
didn't. But through- native timidity
he has never made the story public.
Jordan went to the old Chutes with
Ed Stover, ex-president of the
Press Club, accompanied by two la
dies. Upon leaving Frank whispered
to his friend to pay the car fare, as
his money happened to be exhausted.
Stover saw the long looked for chance
and whispered to the ladies to watch
the fun. When they boarded the car,
which was crowded, he quietly point
ed Jordan out to the conductor as a
stranger who had been annoying his
party and said he did not wish fur
ther molestation. When fares were
asked for Stover said "Three." The
conductor turned to Jordan and said,
"Fare, please." Frank blushed and
motioned to his perfidious friend. The
car man only said again, but louder:
"Fare, please." Then Jordan an
swered: "That gentleman pays for
me." "Excuse me," spoke up Stover,
"I don't know you! You have been
following these ladies and me all
evening. I don't know you!" Jordan
stammered, "Why, Ed, Iâ" "Don't
*Ed' me, sir!" replied Stover, "I
never met you before." In the midst
of his desperation and the repeated
demands for fare Jordan finally cried
out: "Is there a Mason in this car?"
There was a pause; then an old gen
tleman stepped over and handed a
nickel to the' conductor. The "com
panion piece" to the story is yet to be
told, but Jordan* says there'll be one.

A negro colony sent out to Liberia
frc-m Georgia last January has failed
and the members have returned to this
country. A number of Georgia plant
ers capitalized the scheme, thinking
that a favorable soil for the growing
of cotton and corn had been found in
the African state. They furnished tha
colonists with provisions, farming tools,
seeds and ether equipments, but the
experiment could not be conducted to
success, being one in a long line of such
almost if not quite invariably winding
up calamitously. There seems nothing
for the Southern black man to do ex
cept to stay at home and work out his
salvation as best he can, accepting his
difficulties as part of the common bur
den, and not to be avoided by chang
ing his base and going off to another
country.â New York Tribune.

A German military officer now on trial has been ac
cused of a thousand specifications of cruelty toward his
subordinates. To one who thus is guilty of crime in
wholesale it seems a travesty of justice to be permitted
to escape on retail punishment. The authorities should
make of him a modern, not a mythical, Tantalus, and
torment him by an unending prospect of punishment
never fulfilled.
Dr. Edward Everett Hale of Boston
recently delivered a lecture to young
people on how to study. He said the
nine hours of study necessary in some
schools was too much. Too much time,
he believed, was given to languages, es
pecially to Latin. "I want to tell you
how to use books," said Dr. Hale. "Se
lect a bcok on each side of any great
controversial question, especially in
history. You will see the whole a great
deal better by seeing both sides. Get
back to original authorities. They are
so accessible now that it is easy. Work
on one subject at a time and not on
a dozer. Don't be a slave to books.
but have more than one on each topic.
Trust your memory, and memory will
trust you. When studying don't study
books alone. Agassiz's teaching was
not so valuable because of the facts
he tausht as what he told teachers
about the way to learn for themselves.
Before ail and above all, study nature."
How to Study.
Clarence was thrown out into the
wet because he had no money to pay
for his ride on the street car. He land
ed in the slippery mud on the Hyde
street hill and did not hurt himself
much; Clarence was used to being
thrown out of empty box cars on rail
road trains and that was much worse.
But Hyde street hill on a rainy night
at 10 o'clock has none of the earmarks
of' hospitality about it. Clarence longed
for a warm bed.
Now that wooden leg which had
brought him in many a good nickel
from the charitably inclined came to
the help of Clarence in his emergency.
He sat there by the car track and un
fastened the joint of the leg from its
socket upon his knee, allowing it just
enough swing so that it would pro
trude against his pants leg in a start
ling fashion. Then Clarence set up a
wail which was calculated to reach to
hlsh heaven.
. The cop who came up to the scene
with a single foot stride took in the sit
uation immediately: nothing less than
a compound fracture of botn bones of
the leg. So the "hurry up" wagon was
rung up from the Central Emergency
and Clarence was given "a breakneck
hike to the operating table. There the
plot thickened.
Clarence was taken to the Central
police, station by those cruel doctors
and "vagged," but a cell '.va.s better
than the side of Hyde street hill in the
rain that dripped-dripped.
Sorrows of Clarence.
Illinois can at least claim one dis
tinction. It holds the proud position
of contributing each year toward tho
total of the internal revenue receipts
a far larger amount than any other
State in the Union. Last year the fig

THE Harbor Commission, as we predicted, is doing
its full duty in enforcing the AVoodward law, to se
cure free market privileges in this city to the pro
ducers and consumers. The law is very exact and
specific in its requirements, and under it the commission
has now canceled the permits of nine of the largest
wholesale commission firms dealing in country produce.
These firms have taken the next step left open to them
by beginning judicial proceedings which will test the
constitutionality of the law. This is very desirable. If
the law stand the judicial test, but seem to fail in accom
plishing its whole o.bject when tested in practice, it may
be amended in the line of its' purpose until its effective
ness is secured.
It is a long time since The Call began an agitation for
such a law, but the necessity for it has appeared to
exist every moment until now. There has appeared to
be all the time an influence intruded between producer
and consumer inimical to the interests of both. It was
easier to arouse the feeling of the consumers than of the
producers, for they are city residents, in closer touch
and easier to combine in a common purpose: But the
lack of contact and organization on the part of the pro
ducers made them more needful of legal defense of their
interests, and this has been furnished by the law, which
will now go to judicial judgment.
The producers of the State need to be waked up. and
infused with the spirit of self-help in this matter.
Widely scattered, they have no common means of com
munication by which they may compare experience and
devise means to help themselves. It is believed that the
State Board of Trade presents such a common medium
of exchange of opinions. But when it sought to equip
itself with facts that would expose the extent of abuse
of the producers in the home market and in the East
it ..discovered a disinclination to furnish information;
and its labors in obtaining it are greatly increased
thereby. Perhaps when the producers find that the
Woodward law is sustained the certainty that their rights
may be protected will remove their reticence and timid
ity, and facts may be furnished which will put their in
terests beyond the power of any one to harm.
THE WOODWARD LAW.
The Vermont Legislature failed to
provide any fund for the State's par
ticipation, but the prominent manufac
turers were called together by *G jv
ernor McCullough and it was deemed
essential that some concerted action
was necessary. Assistance from tiie
Legislature could not be obtained, and
it was decided to raise a' fond of $15,000
to defray the expense of a State exhibit.
Vermont's granite and marble indus
tries are extensive, and her displays in
this line will be the largest and most
complete that she has ever made at

be shown as well.
Vermonters are anxious for a build

McCullough is interested in this phase
also, and at cne time he considered the
advisability of erecting such a struc
ture himself. An additional fund for a
building will likely be created and a
structure creditable to the State may
yet be built.

ney back in the Interior from our
mines, in what is called the Oriente,
on the disputed boundary between
Peru and Ecuador, is the most sav
age and unconquerable band of In
dians In existence. They are known as
the Jivaro, and were the only natives
that Plzarro and the Incas never sub
dued. They have no tribal relations,
nor family relations, and no religion,
and through their savagery are exter
minating themselves. They once num
bered hundreds of thousands, and aro
now said to be reduced to from 8000
to 10,000*. The white man who comes
within their domain is not only mur
dered and beheaded, but his body is
subjected to the most horrible mutila
tion as a warning to others against tho
unwisdom of trespassing."
When the United States Senate investigation into the
character of General Wood, personal, public and private,
is concluded the general will be able to say with the
rest of us. when he foots his totals of liabilities and as
sets in reputation and strikes a balance, that if he has
any reputation left surely he didn't win the bauble at the
cannon's mouth.
The people will have abundant opportunity to ex
amine the enthusiastic or prejudiced statements of
theorists, and when they conclude to seek a public sup
ply they will take good care that its permanence and
sufficiency shall make it so valuable that it can pay the
cost of its acquisition and administration without bur
dening the general fund and depriving them of revenue
needed for the proper purposes of government.
Events in the East, notwithstanding the New Yofk
canal matter, indicate that in respect to municipal social
ism deliberate examination is turning the tide away
from that policy, and that hereafter if cities go into
business it will be by exactly. the same methods that are
followed by prfvate individuals.
ADVOCATES of municipal socialism are not satis
fied with' two trials at public ownership of the
Geary-s%eet road, but return frequently and fran
tically to that subject. Other cities have had the pre
liminary experience of San Francisco. In 1893 Detroit
voted for public ownership of electric lighting, and 92
per cent of the vote cast was for the plan. The present
year, with the experience of Detroit to admonish them,
the citizens of Cleveland voted on the same proposition
and it was beaten by an actual majority of 6000.
This refusal to embark in municipal socialism was
due to the campaign made by the Citizens' Association
against mortgaging the city to pay for a public utility
which only part of the taxpayers could use. It was in
sisted in Cleveland that if the city were going into busi
ness the business should pay for and support itself, with
out falling back on the taxpayers to make up its deficits.
It will be observed that between the two propositions is
the difference between socialism and business. The
Cleveland campaign was expository of the whole issue,
and every voter was furnished with the straight busi
ness argument, which developed the principle involved.
At the last election the State of New York voted on
a proposition to bond the State for $101,000,000 to en
large the Erie cnnal, going into the pocket of every tax
payer for money to put into a business project of doubt
ful utility, since it is for the benefit of canal boatmen
during that season of the year when crops are but little
moved. The canal is frozen and dormant during the
winter months, but the debt is drawing interest every
day. The situation is very different from that existing
when the canal was built. No other means of transpor
tation existed then except by water, and on common
highways. Now the vast majority of the commerce is
carried by railways, at the cheapest rates in the world,
and they are open in. the winter season when the great
crops of the West are going forward to market. The
project was carried by the votes of Buffalo and New
York City, and it is significant that the farmers of the
State were against it, their vote being overridden by the
cities.
In San Francisco the people have twice rejected the
proposition to build a street railway which only part of
the. people can use and pay for it out of the pockets of
all the people. The Call insisted that the business in
which the city proposed to engage should be established
and administered on the income derived from its users.
The Examiner is now trying a physic, of figures on the
case. It finds that the gross income of the present
Geary-street road is $170,000 per year, and that the net
income is $20,000, or equal to interest on $570,000. This
being so, is there the shadow of an excuse for taxing
the whole city to acquire the property? to
figures and admissions of the advocates of the scheme
it can support itseif.
The Call has tried to carry on the same campaign of
education on the subject that was so successful when
promoted by Ihe Citizens' Association of Cleveland. The
same principle applies to every form of municipal trad
ing. Let each kind of business support itself. Oakland
and San Francisco are greatly concerned in demanding
that this principle be insisted upon. The citizens of both'
cities are going to have ample time to instruct them
selves for intelligent action. The recent decision of the
Supreme Court upon the ownership and use of ground
waters has put out of focus the proposition to imme
diately resort to the ground waters of Santa Clara
County, for the owners of the vast orchards of that
county,, dependent on those waters for irrigation, have
taken steps to prevent the destruction of their property
by diversion of the water on which it depends to make
a potable supply for cities that have other sources upon
which to draw.

The piping cry that startled the

The bent old man hobbled a few steps
toward his helpmate with his shaking
hands outstretched, but she had brok

was now in his arms with her white
head pressed against his shrunken

figure to him.
Fifty-six years â fifty-six long years
of comradeship. Those days long ago
when the children, now but misty re
membrances, had been there about
that fireside. Those days of sickness,
when their hearts had been welded by
common suffering. Those days of
golden' happiness, when the air was
free and spirits light. Fifty-six years,
long years, together. Now these

Brick, the driver of the ambulance,

could clamber tremblingly down the

in hand they stood there before the
door of the poorhouse, waiting to be
taken in.' A kind faced matron came

to follow after, when an attendant
stayed him r by the .arm. Then they
In the Shadozv.
Inside of each of these tiny towers
or villi there is a complex coil of blood
vessels and little bulb-like bodies called
lacteals. The blood vessels of each vil
lus are. of course, part of the general
blood stream. The lacteals combine into
larger and larger trunks and finally
empty their contents into the great
blood tubes near the heart. Their ac
tivities will be more fully explained
when we come to discuss the lymphatic
system, of which they are a part.
Now, the little epithelial cell which
covers the villus is the real worker.
Each cell oasses the sugar absorbed
over to the blood vessels and turns the
fats absorbed over to the lacteals. The
peptones absorbed by the * epithelial
cells are taken up part by the blood
vessels (capillaries) and part by the
lacteals, all three, sugars, peptones and
fats, thus finding their way finally into
the blood stream.
The peptone as quickly as it is
formed soaks through the walls of the
stomach and. is collected by the tiny
blood tubes (capillaries), which wind
their minute coils just under the sur
face of both stomach and intestines.
During the interval of gastric digestion
ihe band of muscular fiber called the
pylorus (from a Latin word meaning
"gatekeeper") remains tightly closed.
After a time the pylorus opens and al
iows the food mass to enter the intes
tine?. The "food mass consists at this
time of starch, converted starch â that
is. sugar proteid â part of which has
been changed to peptone and fats,
which thus far are unchanged.
In the intestine the food meets with
a number of important and powerful
ferments, the bile from the liver, the
amylopsin (starch converter), trypsin
(peptone maker)' and steapsin (fat
emulsifier) from the pancreas and the
invertin and other ferments of the in
testinal fluid. The combined effect of
these enzymes or ferments is to con
vert the remainder of the starch into
sugar, to change the rest of the pro
toids into peptone and to convert the
fats into an emulsion. An emulsion is
merely a separation of a fat into very
minute drops.
The absorption of these matters in
the intestine is a peculiarly interesting
and beautiful process. The inner sur
face of the intestine is covered with
minute structures known as villi. These
villi average about one-fiftieth of an
inch in diameter and are set close to
gether,, giving to the surface an ap
pearance like a fine plush .or velvet.
Each villuB Is made of epithelial cells,
like a tower built of bricks. And the
duty of each individual cell 1b to ab
sorb from the food the digested pro
ducts â sugar, peptone and emulsion â
as soon as they are made.
The food mass, then, as it passes
from the mouth by being swallowed
and enters the stomach through the
esophagus, is changed In that part of
its starch which has been converted
Into sugar. Thus far* the proteids and
the fats are unchanged. In the stom
ach, however, the food mass becomes
mixed with the gastric juice. Now the
gastric juice has the power to change
proteid matter fnto peptone. The im
portance of this will be understood
when it is stated that mere proteid
cannot pass through the walls of the
alimentary tube, but that peptone can
do so just as Â¦water soaks through a
sponge.

will vote for the treaty, so that the caucus can offer no
impediment to its ratification.
The Democrats have three over one-third of the mem
bership of the Senate, and voting solidly could defeat the
treaty. But with the Senators from Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, one from North
Carolina and one from Missouri voting for it, their own
caucus is under control and the treaty will win. This is as
it sTiould be. The issue is not partisan, and the Demo
cratic Senators who support the "treaty are doing the best
thing for their country, and incidentally for their party.
There are no signs of Republican defection at all, and
when the canal is completed men of all parties can feel
an honest pride in the action of their representatives to
secure it.

CHICAGO, Dec. 16.â At a joint meet
ing of all the lines interested and the
representatives of the Park Stage
Company held here to-day rates to the
Yellowstone National Park from all
points were lowered from 33 1-3 to 40
per cent. It was decided to extend the
season during which the rates will ap
ply, making it begin on June 1 and last
to September SO.
The railroad representatives were
actuated largely, A it is understood, â by
President Roosevelt's great interest in
the park. When the President last vis
ited the park he expressed to several
railroad men the hope they would
make it possible for every American to
see the Yellowstone.
Arrangements have been made with
the stage company whereby a rate of
565 from Chicago will be made for the
entire park tour. The round trip rate
from the Twin Cities and Omaha will
be ?55.

Apropos of the advent of Christmas
an5 the birth of a new year, the board
of managers of the Children's Hos
pital, 3700 California street, as has bsen
customary in the past, has designated
three days, December 22, 23 and 24, to
be known as donation days, when the
public will be given an opportunity to
gladden the hearts and lighten the bur
dens of the unfortunate little Inmates
of the institution by donating money
and supplies consistent with the size
of their pocketbooks. Particularly in
view of the significance of the Tuletide
and the fact that it is a period of cheer,
the appeal of the management merits a
generous response from a kind-hearted
community.
The following appeal has been sent
out by the board of managers:

annual donation days of the Children's Hos
nHal December 22. 23 and 24, and BOllclttng
eltta ot money or supplies for this beneficent
charity the board of managers desires to etate
that while the year has added population and
wealth to San Francisco and the State, to the
hospital this Drosuerlty has been of little ad
vantage. On the contrary, with the growth
of the city we have had more sick children to
care for without a. corresponding Increase of
This "being the case, our friends, who have
always bwn quick to respond to our appeals,
can readily understand that our needs this
year are of special urgency.
We feel assured that this appeal for the
Children's Hospital will meet with the same
Kenerous response as that which has followed
these of former years, and that the hearts or
the sick and destitute children by your bounty
may In some measure share In that cheer and
comfort which brighten the lives of the more
fortunate little ones at the Christmas season.
.Donations of money, clothing, groceries, fuel
and supplies will be gratefully received and
duly acknowledged. Monthly subscriptions,
larfte or Email, will be called for regularly.

From come correspondence 'which
passed between John Elliott, secretary
of the Olympic Club, and George James,
chairman of the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation registration committee, 'yester
day, the spirit of amateurism is ap
parently at a low ebb among the box
ers.
The Olympic Club officials desire to
give a boxing tournament in February,
extending over two nights. The mere
announcement of such an affair should
result in a Hood of Inquiries as to
matches. Instead of this there were
no volunteers and solicitation in the
usual quarters did not bring any better
results. The club officials found that
medals and similar trophies were not
to the liking of ths so-called , amateurs.
They wanted the good yellow gold for
which their professional brothers fight.
By implication this means that the
promoters of all the otner clubs giving
amateur shows are not so strict in their
dealing with the boxers Â«is are the
Olympic officials.
George James, replying to Mr. El
liott's letter, said his associates would
punish any amateur who' was convicted
of asking or of receiving a nvmey prize.
In discussing this question Mr. James
said: "The^ registration committee has
heard from â¢time to time that the ama
teur boxere receive. money in addition
to some suitably inscribed trophy. We
have been able in but.few cases to se
cure any. evidence against them. The
club managers refuse, to. testify and the
other boxers -will not incriminate their
friends. If the Olympic Clu-b or any
other club will furnish sufficient evi
dence we will make . an example of
some of the boxers."
Mr. Elliott of the Olympic Club has
been a stalwart defender of amateur
ism for twenty-flve years or more.
President William Greer: Harrison and
the, other directors are also strong ad
herents of pure sport, jit is their
known attitude in "this regard that
deters would-be violators of the rules
from appearing at the Olympic Club.
Boxing Is a sport which do^s not lend
itself readily to amateurism and; there
will be eternal strife between the of
ficials and participants. It is so profit-

Miss Hill told the detectives who
were detailed on ; the ease that the
money and jewels were concealed un
der a mattress in her room. There was
$1250 in coin and about $750 in Jewelry)
The jewelry included three diamond
rings. It was the duty o< tliS Chinese
to clean up the various apartments,
and it wns nearly noon when he reach
ed those occupied by the landlady. Yhe
latter left the house soon .afterward,
and did not return- .until late in" the
afternoon. It was evening before she
discovered the theft and noiifie-i the
police. â¢ .
The Chinese servant, who is known
as Ah Lun, disappeared with the
money and valuables. Other occupants
of the house say that he left the place
hurriedly after arranging Miss Hill's
room. The captain of detectives at
once dispatched men into the .Chinese
district to locate the man if possible
p.nd arrest him. His haunts- were vis
ited, but no clew of him can be found.
It is supposed he left the city immedi
ately,- and orders for his detention have
been telegraphed to several of the in
terior towns. The police have reason
to suppose that he will make, tn at
tempt to reach China, and all the out
going steamers in the direction of th&
Orient will be watched. -
The detective department is work
ing to locate a Chinese boy who robbed
Miss Daisy Hill, the proprietress of a
lodging-house at 340 Stockton street,
of $2000 in coin and jewelry. The thief
was in the employ of the woman for
over three years, and. until last Mon

with his plunder, was regarded as an
honest servant.

water, glanced and struck Sweeny.
Sweeny was about 43 years of age.

Â£ pecia! Dispatch to The CÂ»X\
Mysterious Shooting Occurs in
a Railroad Graders* Camp
Situated Xear Hope, Idaho
Young Corbett, the featherweight
champion, is fighting himself into con
dition in his. gymnasium out at the
Beach Tavern. Ambitious amateurs
of all weights have been tackling him'
and there have been some rare scraps;
witnessed by a handful of spectators.
He went three rounds with Jack
Burke,- the most promising lightweight
in this vicinity, yesterday, that for
quick action are seldom equaled.
Burke \va3 outclassed, but he was
game and was painted a gory red be
fore time was called. Both boxers had
on big gloves, or there would surely
have been a knockout. Burke kept
coming all the. time, although Corbett
was scoring with left and right with
unerring accuracy.
George Sanferson was next taken on.
He landed three blows on Corbett's
body, but the latter qu:ck!y stopped
any further play there. In the second
round Corbett received a blow on a
nerve in the shouliler which disabled
him for a few moments. It affected -a
chord in the neck and proved painful
for a time. On Tuesday he received the
same kind of a blow on the elbow,
which affected him temporarily.
He looks big and' rugged at present
and two more weeks. of training are ex
pected to work wonders in his condi
tion. Training is serious business with
him this time and he goes about it in a
businesslike way" and with serious
mien.
It seems possible a controversy will
develop over Corbett'a weight. ! He
guards this secret as jealously as a
bachelor maid guards her age and ap
parently Intends to do so until he geti
on the scales the day of the fight if
he can .withstand the pressure. He
claims this is one of the secrets of his
training which belongs to himself arid
his handler. Harry Tuthill. Xo one \
else' about the place* ever sees him step
on the scales.
What purpose it serves to keep this
a secret Is hi|rd to discern. It does not
make him any heavier nor any lighter
to- weigh- in public. His chief argu
ment is that while he might be consid
erably overweight to-day it would
give the public a wrong impression, as
he is positive he will be at weight at
the appointed hour. He has posted a
forfeit of 51000, half of which guaran
tees his appearance and. the other his
weight. He has to make 129 pounds at
6 o'clock. In his last light with Hah
lon he weighed 130. pounds ringside.

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 17.â When seen
early this morning in regard to the
calling off of the game between Cali

not at liberty to say what the outcome
will be until I confer with Manager
Barnard to-day."
BERKELEY, Dec. 16. â The Univer

committee to-day, called off the pro
pored Xew Year's day football game
between the university eleven and a

With both Cascine and Rockaway as
eligibles it certainly looks as if Burns

Charley Henshall started Emshee for
the first time in the opening event and

for J725. The odds against Emshee
went from 3 to 12. when a late play
forced the price down to 8.
The entry of Sol Smith will be re

One of the heaviest plunges of the
afternoon was made on XÂ»rvator to
win the five and a half furl jr.g scram
ble, for which Sad Sam ruied favorite.
The entry of Boot? & Kollenbeck dis
played a remarkable turn of speed,
running under mild restraint from the
jump and beating Sad Sam with Lar
son sitting as immovable as a piece of
Ftatucry. O'.endenning, formerly con
sidered a fast had an off day
and the betting signified as much.
Lansdowne. a 50 to 1 shot, ran third.

NOTES OP THE TL'RF.
Nearly all of the different winners
were well supported and the sharp
shooters exhibited such rare precision
that the ring again received a shaking
up. Throe favorites were successful.
Starting for the first time in the col
ors of Dr. Rowell and running in the
name cf F. H. Bell, Alice Carey, an
g to 1 shot, cleaned up in the intro
ductory sprint. With Sallie Goodwin
Fcratrhed. Mountebank went to the
post^avnrite. The latter* ran his race,
but could not overhaul Alice Carey,
wh'ch won by more than two lengths.
Pu*s in Boots was an indifferent third.
Rockaway, the Bums & Waierhouse
crack, made a show of the other start
ers In the six furlong two-year-old
event. Although It was his first start
at the meeting tho ring took no liberties
with the colt, holding him a 1 to 2
chance. Bullman had the leer up on
the favorite and he scored handily from
Mendon after a little urging down the
stretch. Military Man. heavily backed
<or the place, got oft so poorly that
he had no chance.
Johnny Fchorr started Avenger in
the seven furlong event, also for two
year-olds, and a deal of coin was bet
on the colt at S to 5. Reed was totally
unable to do anything with him. run
ning unplaced. Miss Ringlets and Red
Cross Nurse fought it the entire
way, the latter, ridden by Foley. get
ting the verdict by half a length. N.
Lewis landed The Bugaboo in the show.
PLUNGE ON NEUVATOR.
WINNERS HEAVILY BACKED.
The judges were not called upon to
pick any nose finish on this occasion.
Tommy Burns rode Fossil and he took
the pride of the bushes out in front.
Proper trailing at his heels. Turning
Into the stretch. Martin struck Proper
once with his whip and the big colt
assumed the front position and. grad
ually forging ahead, he won easily, cov
ering the one and a sixteenth miles In
1:47, a remarkably goad race.
Oarsman finished strongly, but Fos
sil, though tiring perceptibly, held him
Fafe, taking the place by half a length.
Horatius. with Otis up. disappointed
his backers, nf ver being a factor.
Oarsman, the New York crack, was
EFked to Fhou'-der 114 pounds, but it
looked as if the stable did not consider
him quite up on edge, for his odds went
from 6 to 10.
The first of the 51000 bi-weekly handi
caps resulted in a victory for Walter
Jennings' slashing colt Proper yester
day at Ingleside track. While the rain
held aloof, the track was sloppy and
the eon of Prestcnpans fairly reveled
In the going, leaving in his wake such
well known performers as Fossil. Oars
man. Falconbridge and Keratius.
Proper, carrying 112 pounds and rid
den by Jack Martin, opened equal fa
vorite with Fossil, but such a raft of
money was thrown into the ring on
him that the books were forced to cut,
until 7 to 6 was the market quotation.

Professor H. Morse Stephens of the
University of California gave his sixth
lecture on "The History of the French
Revolution" in the art room of the
Mechanics' Pavilion last night. The
attendance numbered more than 1500
and the thrilling word painting of the
political career of Vergniaud, the
orator of the Girondins, was highly
appreciated.
Professor Stephens depicted the
hours and days of the foreign war.
which began with the repulse of the
French army, and told of the insubordi
nation and the utter disorganization
of the army and the end of Lafayette's
part in the revolution.
Descriptively he explained the inva
sion of the Tuilleries, June 20, 1792,
when the overthrow of the monarchy
was in preparation. The insurrection
of August 10, when the royal family
sought safety in the Assembly, was
one of the most vividly described in
cidents of the remarkable and "hys
terical" period.
Professor Stephens pictured also the
hours of the terrible massacres in the
prison, when priest and layman were
brutally butchered in the very sight
of those who could, had they so mind
ed, have rescued them from the bloody
hands of the murderers.
"Marat, the Friend of the People."
will be the subject of Professor Steph
ens' next lecture, which will take place
January 13.

President Charles Spear ot the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners declares
that the* permits of all the wholesale
dealers in perishable products of San
Francisco will be revoked by the board
if dilatory tactics are .resorted to in
the courts to prevent a determination
of the scope of the powers conferred
under the Woodward law. ; Summary
action of this. sort, he thinks, might
tend to bring the entire Issues to a
head "at once.
In Mr. Spear's view of the case the
Immediate, result Of ' revoking all the
permits would be to prevent the whole
salers from\doing any business on the
State's wharves, either as buyers err
sellers. They would, "he, says, be com
pelled to., deal directly, with the pro
ducers when they, were buying, and also
be compelled to haul everything away
from the wharves to make sales. If
the dealers should show a desire to
have the cases now in court heard as
soon as possible the. Harbor Commis
sioners would wait for a court decision
before proceeding further.
"1 believe,*' said Mr. Spear yesterday,
"that the move that has been suggested
would tend to give an open-market for
produce in San Francisco. The pur
pose of the Woodward law is to pre
vent discrimination against sellers and
buyers; it is against conspiracy to re
strain trade. All there is to this con
tenticm is in the direction of an open
market. The law has no provision to
regulate prices.
"The Harbor Board is determined in
this matter. We wish to have a deci
sion from the court. We do not wish
to wait Ions for a hearing, not many
days; perhaps we will wait a. week. If
there are applications for additional re
straining trrders to hamper the Com
missioners we will proceed to revoke
the permits. We wish to have the legal
ity of* the Woodward law determined.
A decision In our favor would settle the
whole question of an open market."
Attorney Reinstein declares that his
clients, the wholesalers, desire to get
a speedy decision and that no attempt
will be made to delay the proceedings
in rourt. He says also that the pres
ent situation is very unsatisfactory to
the dealers, as the contention that the
Commissioners seek to sustain is that
they have power to follow the dealers
to their stores and deprive them of per
mits to sell for transactions that take
place â¢ off the State's wharves. The
wholesalers believe that the construc
tion put on the law by the Harbor
Commissioners is wrong and they are
anxious to have the court decide, that
they may understand their exact sta
tus and leaf n what course to pursue.
The Board of Education yesterday
denied the request of the Board of
Public Works that it reconsider Its
former action ordering the dismissal of
James B. McSheehy as inspector of
school buildings. The Board cf Public
Works desires to retain McSheehy on
the ground that his services are neces
sary to supervise the repairs needed In
seventy-five school buildings. The
Board of Education, however, claims
that it has no available funds to carry
on the repairs and the necessity for
McSheehy's employment has ceased.
The request of the Excelsior Home
stead Progressive Association that its
petition for an additional portable
schoolhouse and for a night school be
granted was taken under advisement.
Leaves of absence were granted to

tition was taken under advisement.
A commmittee appointed by the
Grand Jury, consisting of Harry KÂ»Â»lly,
W. E. Davis and E.. J. Benedict, made
an inspection of the office of County i
A. B. Mahony yesterday for the
purpose of ascertaining whether Alonzo
Davidson performed any work in the
office for the money paid him by the
municipality. They found the book"
upon which Davidson was supposed to
have worked, but could find no con
clusive evidence that the entries in the
book were made by him. The book
will be shown to the Grand Jury Fri
day and in the meantime efforts will be
made to find the missing clerk and
summon him before the body to explain
his connection with Mahony's office.
"Davidson's book" yielded but little
information to the committeemen.
There was not a line, in [t to show by
whom the entries were made or at what
time. In this it differed from every
other book in the office. The books are
provided with a marginal space, in
which the clerk who Is copying into the
volume is supposed to put the date
upon which the judgment or decree or
order was entered. Not a date' appears
in the margin of the book Mahony
claims is Davidson's. Neither is there
anything to show that etny of the on- i
tries were made by Davidson.
The committee was accompanied on !
its tour of investigation by Expert B.
T. Mantel, whose duty it wiy be to se
cure for the jury, before next Friday,
specimens of Davidson's handwriting
for comparison with the writing in the |
book.
The visit of the committee worked
wonders in the County Clerk's office.
Mahony wa3' on hand bright and early
to show it about the place, and every
clerk was at his desk, working with
such diligence that if they kept it up
for a week the County Clerk's office
would not be a minute behind in the
work. Even Colonel Martin Brady
was on hand, and by actual count made
four entries in an index book while
the committee was in sight. When thÂ«
committee disappeared so did the
colonel. He remarked as he left the
office that as he had had several bad
nights this week he could do no more
because he was suffering from rheuma
tism.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday began an inquiry regarding
the charge of $3000 for ten horses and
$2475 for nine horses furnished to the
Fire Department by J. J. Doyle. The
horses weighed 1500 pounds or over and
are designed for heavy engine work.
Fire Commissioner Parry stated that
Doyle was the only one who- had bid
on the horses.
Parry said that when the bids were
invited certain horse dealers declared
that they would charge $400 each for
the horses desired. Doyle said that a
draying firm had paid $600 for two
horses which the Fire Department
would not use.
Secretary McCarthy of the Fire Com
mission stated that eight horses had
been purchased during 1903 under an
eld contract from the Howard Estate
Company for $175 each, or $125 less
than Doyle's price. Eighteen horses
were bought In April, 1902. from the
Haggln estate for $165 each.
McCarthy said that it was formerly
the custom to send notifications to all
horse dealers when purchases were con
templated by the Fire Department, but
this had not been done when the horses
were bc-usht from Doyle.
The committee postponed the inquiry
until next Monday at 1:30 p. m. to hear
from the superintendent of horses as
to whether any efforts were made to
secure offers from other horse dealers.
The committee reported in favor of
the Mayor's recommendation that a
storekeeper-mechanic be appointed in
the Department of Elections. It was
stated that the Incumbent of the posi
tion has held it for four year3 and that
it would not be creating a new place,
but would legalize his appointment.
The committee decided to allow the
City Attorney to employ an expert on
land values in the case of the city ver
sus Victor Albonze for the condemna
tion of lards required for St. Mary's
Square. . The piece of land involved is
valued at $7230. The committee decided
to hold a conference with the City At
torney before any further suits for the
condemnation of lands shall be prose
cuted.
George Shadburne, president of St.
Mary's Square Association, said that
there were sufficient-funds to purchase
all the frontage on California and Pine
streets between St. Mary's Square and
Quincy place and the intermediate
property would be purchased by pri
vate subscription. Brandenstein took
exception to Shadburne designating the
pieces of land to be condemned. claim-
Ing that this is entirely In the province
of the committee. -
Rev. D. O. Crowley, who is head of
the Youths' Directory of this city, is
hard at work perfecting his agricul
tural school at Rutherford, Napa
County. The institution â¢ owns 1021
acres there and buildings are in course
of construction for the use of the lads
who are to become farmers. By. next
March a building 102 feet long will be
in readiness for occupation. It will
contain a parlor, large hallway, four
class- rooms. â¢ two dormitories. - boys'
lavatories-, four rooms for. the teachers
and a library. As there is immediate
need for this building, work will be
pressed. The other structures will be
of stone.
. Two reverend brothers were brought
from: Maryland to take charge of the
school and they are forming classes
and will soon begin the work of indus
trial education. -
: " It is Father Crowley's idea to fit the
boys who come to him for care and di-
Tection In order that they may go out
Irito the vverld and earn a livelihood.
During each year more than 600. boys
pass through the school. ., Homes are
found for a ureat many and the Jaal
ance are kept at the directory and
given a' practical' education.
The agricultural school is an exten
sion of the Youths' Directory and it is
purposed to follow a course which the
experience of many years has proved
the best. Father Crowleybelieves that
prevention is better than cure. The
institution is not a reformatory. It
simply takes in waifs and saves them
by care and discipline and makes good
citizens of them.
It is expected that 150 boys will com
pose the agricultural school. These
lads will not be forced to take up the
study of practical farming. Only
those who have a liking for outdoor life
and who desire to learn the methods of
the farmer will be taken to Rutherford.
The lads will be divided Into two
classes. Wnile one class Is studying
the theory of farming the other class
will be out in the fields or in the dairy
doing practical work. The lads will be
taught how to prepare the land and
study the analysis of the soil; planting,
grafting and pruning of three; dairying
and other things. The youngsters will
enter the school at 14 and are expected
to graduate in three years.
Father Crowley has often noted the
need of skilled labor on the farm and
he is of the opinion that In a few years
In? young men who graduate from the
school will be capable of taking charge
of farms and helping to develop the.
land of this State.
The school will be f stablished for
poor boys, but there is no objection to
taking hoys who can. afford to pay for
board and tuition, provided they be of
good character and willing to conform
to the rules and regulations of the in
stitution.
The board adopted, the map of the
district to be benefited by the proposed
change of grade on Waller street, be
tween Broderick street and Buena
Vista avenue.
Supervisor Curtis called the attention
of the board to the almost impassable
condition of Twenty-fifth street, be
tween Folsom street and Treat avenue.
The board decided that the property
owners must petition to have the work
done.
Several extensions of time were grant
ed to contractors for certain street
work.
The board decided to recommend to
the Supervisors that the sidewalks on
Clement street, between Tepth and Fif
teenth avenues, be reduced from nine
teen to fifteen feet. No action was taken
on the request of H. Jaudln, president
of the Point Lobos Avenue Improve
ment Club, that the reduction be car
ried out to Thirty-third avenue, as no
formal petition for the same has been
filed.
The representative of the surety com
panies who are on the official bonds of
Commissioners Manson, Casey and
Schmitz notified them yesterday that if
the Supreme Court sustains the verdict
of the jury awarding Mrs. Dora Heath
$5000 damages for being injured
through a defective sidewalk the com
panies will withdraw from the bonds
of the Commissioners.
The surety companies say that they
will decline to be responsible in such
an event, as the Commissioners would
be constantly called on to pay dam
ages for accidents. Collusion on the
part of evil disposed persons is also
feared.
The Commissioners believe it will be
impossible to furnish bonds to the city
if the verdict stands, as private indi-.
viduals will be averse to giving bonds
for officials whose responsibility for ac
cidents from bad sidewalks is so great.
The board will appeal the case to the*
Supreme Court and hopes for a reversal
of the decision.
Albert Johnson appeared before the
board and asked that action be post
poned on the petition of Archbishop
Riordon, president of St. Mary's Help
Hospital, a corporation, that he be
granted a permit for a spur track -on
Filbert street. Johnson, who is the at
torney for the* protestants, said he
needed one week in which to prepare
legal papers to enjoin the board from
granting the permit. Rev. Father Mul
ligan, secretary to the Archbishop,
stated that he would not consent to the
postponement, as it might prejudice his
case* and with that stipulation the
matter was laid over for one week.
The board ordered grades to be
changed at certain points on Potrero
and Central avenues.
The resignation of J. Newlands as
clerk in the bureau of engineering was
accepted.
The secretary was authorized to In
vite bids for the repaving of Dupnnt
street, between Pacific street and Broad
way, and also for the furnishing of 100,
000 basalt block3.

The boys of the Pacific Heights
s h;Â» ! failed to capture any uf the
medal? at the graduating exercises
which took place yesterday. Miss A.
M. Stincen. the, principal, made an ad
drefs to the class of '03 and oxD'ninetf
that ihe girls had fairly won the hon
or?. Consequently they went entirely
to the girls' side of the h.vjse. The
exercises took place in the department
of Miss A. C. Robertson, the vice prin
cipal of the school. The space not oc
cupied by the pupils of the Kruduatiiig
class was* entirely taken up by visitor;?,
parents, relatives and friends <Â»f thS
bright boys and girls. American flags
were draped about the room. Other
wise there was little of adornment to
mark the occasion.
Mies Robertson conducted f.ie music,
which was the entire programme, with
the exception of the award of honors
and diplomas. Miss Stincen. grave out
the honors. The -singing of "the. class
of 1903 was a feature. The boys and
girls had been carefully drilled by Miss
Robertson and "they did credit to the
time and "careful attention that had
been bestowed upon them. They gang
the "Star- Spangled. Banner" and "The
Watch on the Rhine" with vim. Other
melodies were on the programme. Then
Mips Stincen, according to annual cus
tom, spoke. The substance of the
words of the principal was an exhorta
tion to all to work and keep on work
ing, and she was zealous in impressing
the necessity of continuing to study
hard upon those about to leave the
school.

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
WHAT AiND WHY.
Why should substitutes
for Scott's Emulsion be re-
fused ?
Because they do not begin
to offer the equivalent of food-
value contained in Scott's
Emulsion.
Why should special care
be taken to avoid so-called
wines, cordials and extracts
of cod liver oil ?
Because they contain a
large percentage of alcohol
and afford only temporary
stimulation.
Does not Scott's Emulsion
also stimulate the body ?
Yes, but it is stimulation
through nourishment.
What vital food principle
is involved in the action of
Scott's Emulsion?
Direct and perfect nourish-
ment without tax on the
stomach.
Well send too a temple free upon request.

NEW YORK, Dec. 16. â An import
ant decision regarding theatrical con
tracts has been handed down by Judge
Townsend in the United States Cir
cuit Court, who has made permanent
an injunction asked for on behalf of
the Castle Square Opera Company
again Frank Moultan, a comedian.
Under this decision Moultan Is re
strained from appearing on the stage
under any other management until
his contract expires eighteen months
hence. The comedian set up the plea
that the contract allowed his employer
to break it on two weeks' notice and
maintained the same privilege for
himself.

PASADENA, Dec. 16.â Work has
been going on for a month past upon
J. Dolge's Utopia, which is to be lo
cated about five miles to the south
of this city and two miles west of Al
hambra/ Dolge, who was the million
aire founder of Dolgeville, N. Y., fail
ed a number of years agb, and has
since lived In retirement In this neigh
borhood. A short time ago he inter
ested IT. E. Huntington in a scheme to
start a felt factory and a model town
on some of Huntlngton's acreage
through whi^h the interurban electric
lines to Los Angeles run. The large
brick warehouses of the San Gabriel
vinery were purchased, and are now
being torn down and remodeled. Dolge
and Huntington propose to build a
model town, and most of the Inhab
itants will be employes of the factory.
The city will be conducted along lines
similar to those of Dolgeville, N. Y.

â¢ NEW YORK. Dec. 16.â A romance
buried nearly half a century has been
disclosed by the filing for probate of
the will made* by Alpheus D. Dubois,
who had presided over a public school
of this city as principal for fifty-three
years. He retired three years ago and
died Sunday. The will astonished even
his most intimate friends, for it showed
that he had amassed a fortune valued
at one-quarter to half a million dollars.
The romantic interest in the will
arises from the fact" that a bequest is
made to Professor Dubois' daughter.
Not even the old schoolmaster's most
intimate friends, and hl3 confidants
were few, knew he had been married,
and the testator, in naming the daugh
ter, used only her given name because
he did not know to whom she had beÂ«vn
married. Investigation shows that the
professor separated from his wife
nearly fifty years ago. She went away,
taking their little girl/ and neither the
husband nor his relatives ever heard
from them again. They are supposed
to be still alive and In this country, but
where no one knows. The professor's
relatives refuse to give any informa
tion regarding the affair long buried In
the past, but It is said the wife was a
member of a well-known family here.
Professor Dubois was the son of a
minister. His Hvealth Is supposed to
have been accumulated through shrewd
investment of his savings as a teacher.
For more than twerve years he lived in
a small room, preparing part of his own
meals and declared he spent only a dol
lar or so daily, while his income grew
until It reached the sum of $30,000 a
year.

typhoid fever, a few cases convalescing
to an average of twelve -new cases per
day. The hospitals are nearly full,
but nio?t of the patients are being

trained nurses from such, large cities
as Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Cleveland
and Rochester â more than 200 in all.
The relief work is administered by a
competent committee elected at a
mass-meeting of citizens about two

hand will be required for the relief
work before the epidemic is over.

Â¦ The fruit market was quiet, as the Incle
ment weather checked trade, and prices had
but little quotable variance. Interest was cen
tered chiefly in the Orange auction and all
other descriptions were dull. * Ordinary and
medium grades of Apples were abundant and
very weak. Fancy stock was plentiful and In
clined to easiness, but dealers were not forcing
nalea and prices were maintained. AVInter
Nellis Pears were offering in small quantities
and met with quick sale. Persimmons anJ
Quinces were plentiful and easy. Receipts of
Grapes were very light, less than 20 crates
being received, and prices were largely nom
inal. There was very little inquiry for Ber
ries and the light receipts were more than
sufficient for the demand. ,
The flrst auction sale of Oranges for the
season was held and was well attended, but
the bidding was not brisk, as the fruit was
mostly green and unattractive and the ratny
weather had a discouraging effect on the mar
ket. Seven cars. Including two of fancy Red

NEW YORK. Dec. 1Câ The etock market
took on the tone of the holiday dullness and
apathy to-day. Fully half the day's meager
transactions were in four stocks, namely.
Amalgamated Copper, United States Steel pre
ferred. Pennsylvania and Brooklyn Rapid Tran
elt. An cdvance in a few of the specialties
caused Borne eympathetic response In the gen
eral list, but the advances were largely lost
before half of the day. The almost total lack
of demand for stocks allowed a gravitating
tendency to assert Itself In spite of the very
llpht pressure to sell stocks. Brooklyn Tran
sit's rise seerrÂ»d due to buying from the same
source? as for some time, but the approach of
the opening to traffic of the new bridge from
Now York across the Ea*t River was eiven as
a reason for the demand fnr thÂ« stocks, on
account of a prospect of Increased traffic from
that cause. Sugar's advance was supposedly
due to the Imminence of the passage of the
("uban reciprocity bill through the Senate. The
market for Amalgamated Copper continued very j
acti\e and the price moved irregularly. ThÂ«
activity of thÂ«- raw cooper market in London I
wa* an influence on thÂ« stock, but the deal-
Ings were attributed to an organized specu
lative movement. The depression upon the
market, which was in evidence, was not easily
explainable. The disturbed tendency of the
money market, which often becomes apparent
toward the close of the year, is entirely lack
ing at present. The perusal of the arguments
of counsel in the Northern Securities case, as
published to-<3ay. undoubtedly hÂ»d its effect
upon the day's speculative sentiment, both as
influencing opinions as to the probable decision
in that msp nnd as suggesting possible collat
eral applications of the principles at Issue In
the case. There was much discussion also of
the condition in the steel trade, owing to the
large gatherings of representatives in that trade
here tc discuss the maintenance of prices.
There was no very confident feeling observable
that present prices could be held and the ex
istence of tome of the pools designed to h">ld up
rates was feared to be endangered, threiten-
Ing open competition and cutting of rates in
some of the branches of the steel trade. Thin
seemed to be the underlying caus* of thn dull
ness in the stock dealings, as much as any
thing else. The sharp recovery In the sterling
exchange market was sufficient to put an end
to goIJ Imports for the present.
The demand for remittance to cover interest
and dividend ob'.irntions to foreiEU security
holders, and the holiday remittances to friends
by foreigners resident here is also a conspic
uous factor In the seasonable firmness of for
eiÂ»m exchange. .
nondF were rathÂ»r dull and heavy. Total
isaleg (nar value). $1.5(50.000.
l"nltÂ»d States bonds were unchanged on the

The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"History is seain rT^ating itself, and after
the eevere financial depression of the last
*>ven tnctuhs Or* year is closing with a re
corty that surjri^s those not familiar with
th<Â» elasticity of American temperament. Gloom
has suddenly disappeared, and in its place a
<-a!nner vision is gaining sway. exc#pt. where
speculative enthusiasm causes a too violent
â¢Â¦wing of the pendulum. Old time activity has
appeared ca the i-'tock Exchange, and iwnis
llkaly to nay, for k period at least. Sharp ad
vance* oc-.-urred, s-ome of them too sharp; yet
ihe whole trend of affairs for the last four
Â¦weeks prOifs that impellent changes for the

Wirong support has been given the upward

movement of 1W03 is fit an end. and explains
th* assistance given by powerful Insiders, wlrnf
connde.nce is ot course restored by knowledge
that the weakest features have been elimicsted.
The riM- has unquestionably been greatly stlmu

Arrivals of Potatoes were lighter than for
some time, but the market was heavily Block
ed, particularly with river kinds, and trading
continued very quiet. There was no change
In prices, however, as dealers were firm in
their views and not Inclined to force Bales.
There were no fresh Sweats received, but old
stock was still abundant and met with a slug
gish demand at easier rate?. There was very
little doing in Onions and the moderate,sup
plies were ample for all requirements.
Trading in Vegetables was brisk And choice
lots met with prompt sale at good. prices. A
considerable portion of the ivcf-ijitsi of Peaa
from Ix>s Angeles were of poor quality, which
accounts for the wide range In prices. tÂ»oo<l
stock wa* steady at 0@7c per pound, while off
lots were hard to dispose of. even at the min

quarter included some poor stock, which was

were in good request at high prices, while
Chile Peppers were weak under increased re

F. W. Gill, Well Known In Banking

SANTA ROSA, Dec. 16.â F. W. Gill
died at Sebastopol this morning after
a long illness. Gill was a native of
Hartford, Conn., and aged about 63
years. During his boyhood he was a
schoolmate of J. Pierpont Morgan,
Senator Chauncey M. Depew and the
late Commodore Allen of New York.
Gill occupied many position's of trust
on this coast. He was cashier of the
Pacific Insurance Comparfy, which
was ruined by the big Chicago flre,
and then took a position with the
Bank of California, being engaged in
a clerical capacity with William C.
Ralston. Later he became cashier of
the Oakland Bank of Savings, and
later became cashier of the Bank of
Sebastopol. He retired from that po
sition on account of his physical con
dition. He was unmarried.

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 16.â Agent E. B.
Stuart of the Santa Fe, who has just
returned from a conference of the traf
fic men of the road at Kansas City, de
clares that the coming season of tour
ist travel is going to doubly discount
anything that the coast has ever seen.
He says that the indications point to a
continuation of the travel into next
summer so that the close of the tourist
season will hardly be noted upon the
railroads, save by the fact that the re
turning travel will increase. The peo
ple who are wanting to come to the
coast are simply "up against It" in the
matter of securing accommodations.
Reservations have to be made weeks
ahead for the Pullmans despite the
fact that there has been an advance in
the price of berths in this direction
from Chicago. Business has been good
throughout the Middle West and people
who are financially fixed to make the
trip are going to come. Not only is the
passenger business going to be heavy,
but freight business will be so
heavy that the railroads will
have trouble handling it. Money is
easy and business correspondingly
heavy. Though the Knights Templar
gathering does not take place at San
Francisco until next August,. the Santa
Fe has thirteen .chartered trains to
cross the continent to the conclave.

Drar Kir: W> beg to Inform you that we have
been directed by the executive committee to
Invite you to attend and take part In the arbi
tration conference to be held In Washington, on
Tuesday, January 12, 1904.
It is the desire of the permanent committee
that their counsels may be utrenjrthened and
their Influence Increased by the attendance and
co-operation of a considerable body of promi
nent citizens from all parts of the country, ami
they entertain the hope that the coming con
ference may equal In Interest and uÂ»efulnesh
the notable conference of ISOfi. If thes9 hopes am
realized the meeting in January cannot fall to
contribute largely to a treaty of arbitration be
tween the. United States and Great Britain.
In soliciting: a reply to' this letter, we ear
nestly trust that It will be an acceptance of
the Invitation. Very respectfully.
TOHN XV. FOSTEn. Chairman.

Former Mayor James D. Phelan is
an earnest supporter of cfvil service
principles, but he has no desire to serve
on the National Civil Service Commis
sion. Vacancy in the commission caused
by the death of Mr. Proctor induced
some of Mr. Phelan's friends to suggest
his appointment.
The prospect of residing in any city
other than San Francisco Is not pleas

accept the following invitation to visit

The court adjourned the case until
next Tuesdas- morning on account of
the absence of several witnesses for
the defense. It will probably be com
pleted at the next sittirur.
The Carmen's Union was represented
by Attorney H. W. Hutton. The en
tire day was consumed in taking evi
dence as to the manner of the drawing
up of the charges and the method of
trial given the accused men. The at
torneys for Dingwall clAlmed that the
charges were signed by a lot of mem
bers who knew absolutely nothing
about the charces made against the
men, but merely signed at the dicta
tion of Cornelius or Secretary Shallen
borger. The witnesses for the defense
denied that this had been done and
alleged that the charges had been pre
ferred properly and that Dingwall was
given ample time to prepare his de
fense and was given a hearing prior
to his ejection from the union.
'Some "of the men who- signed the
charges against Dingwall admitted that
they knew nothing more about the
charges than the paper they were writ
ten on contained.
The attorneys for the plaintiff will
base their whole case on the fact that
the constitution and by-laws give the
executive committee no such power as
they exercised in their recent action
against the men who did not want poli
tics to be brought Into their union.
SIGN THE COMPLAINT.
vitch for president and Fairweather for
secretary. .
Relatives of Clarke stated yesterday
.that a suit for an annulment of his
marriage would undoubtedly follow in
a few days and that ample proof would
be secured to show ihat Clarke was in
no condition to fully appreciate what
he was doing when he entered into the
matrimonial contract with his present
wife.
The attorneys for E. K. Clarke, whose
quiet marriage in Oakland early Satur
day morning to Mrs. Rosalind Bower,
more familiarly known to the public
as the "Sweet Pea Girl" of Durrant
trial fame, ended in a sudden separa
tion at the Lick House Monday, have
taken the first step toward bringing
the troubles of the unhappy couple to
a climax.
Yesterday Clarke's legal representa
tive held a conference with Attorney
O. K. Cushing, representing Mrs.
Clarke, and plainly intimated to ihe
counsel on the other side that a propo
sition to compromise the case with an
absolute separation for the clubman
would be considered by the husband
if made with .reasonable conditions.
Mrs. Clarke's attorney, however, was
not prepared to enter Into any arrange
ment. In fact, he did not even give
Clarke's representative encouragement
sufficient to warrant him in expecting
that the case would be finally settled
without' the annoying notoriety of. a
trial.
Mrs. Clarke is still residing at the
Lick House, where, when asked last
evening if she was prepared to give
her new husband a separation, she re
plied that the only condition she was
willing to offer to him was that he
return to her and fulfill his promise
made before and after their marriage,
that he would give her a home and
make her life one of happiness.
"When Clarke called here yesterday
for his clothes." said the wife. "I ap
pealed to him to reconsider his deter
mination to quit me. He answered that
it was too late: that the papers had
given him a lot of notoriety, and that
he could not afford to return to me.
He added that his mother would never
forgive him for marrying me. now that
the facts of my past had become known
to the world. He did not take all his
belonging's away from the apartments
and I still hope that he will come back
to me when the influences now being
exerted over him have been shaken off
by him." , ,
That Clarke, however, was not likely
to change his mind was suggested yes
terday in several experiences of his
wife with local' tradespeople, with
whom the husband had previously
placed orders for garments and trinkets
for her. A few hours after their, mar
riage in Oakland Clarke and his bride
returned to this city and visited a Mar
ket-street tailoring establishment,
where he ordered several gowns for his
tfrlde. They also went to a jewelry
store and ordered a valuable purse.
Yesterday Mrs. Clarke called at the
tailoring establishment, where, by the
way, it Is said he first met his former
wife, and was surprised -with the In
formation that her husband had coun
termanded his order for her dresses,
and a similar statement was made to
her when she called for her purse at the
jewelry storeÂ»
Former" friends of Mrs. Clarke, a fam
ily prominent in church work in this
city, have aroused sufficient sympathy
Â¦for the woman in her present predica
ment to warrant them in extending a
helping hand to her. and yesterday they
telephoned her to come to their home, a
suggestion with which she complied last
evening, and spent several hours there.
Altogether this was one of the most
delightful entertainments thÂ»> club has
given and all pronounced "ladies'
night" a complete success In every way.
There were about two hundred and
fifty present.
The following committee on club
nights had charge of the entertain
ment: A. E. Castle, J. S. Spear Jr., D.-
T. Cole, Wendell Easton, E. F. Preston,
F. S. Stratton, Dr. O. F. Westphal, E.
D. Peixotto, Judge Carroll Ccok, E. J.
Smith and E. Tauszky.
Another feature of the evening that
brought out great appreciation was the
splendid singing of the Knickerbocker
Quartet.
â¢At the conclusion of thi? set pro
gramme the guests repaired to the
Maple* room, where dancing was en
joyed for several hours to th-.- music of
a fine string orchestra. Frank W.
Marston acted as floor manager.
A delicious supper, accompanied by
champagne punch, was served during
the entire reception at the pleasure of
the guests.
The early portion of the evening was
devoted to a delightful entertainment of
instrumental and vocal music. The
principal feature of the programme was
the violin playing of Vaclav Murdock,
who has recently arrived from Aus
tralia. He is an artist of the first rank
and his two numbers, the Polonaise, by
Ernst, and the Cavitina, by Raff, were
received with unbounded marks of ap
probation. A Japanese troupe recently
arrived from the Orient gave a number
of songs in their native tongue, and one
of their number did some fine juggling
tricks.
The Union League Club rooms in the
Palace Hotel were in a blaze of glory
last night. It was the occasion of the
reception the club annually gives in
honor of its fair friends. From early
in the evening until after midnight the
spacious . apartments were thronged
with San Francisco's loveliest daugh
ters, arrayed in the daintiest and most
beautiful ball gowns.
In honor of the occasion the assembly
room was decked with garlands of rich
Oregon grape, Intermingled with gorge
ous crimson poinsettas, which were
clustered in luxurious fashion about the
mantel and great mirror on the south
wall.
thing but harmonious.
Six men â Henry Johnson, vice presi-.
dent; George Dingwall, secretary-treas
urer; William Jane, recording secre
tary, and C. F. Hardy and O. A. Kitt
inger, members of the boardâ openly
opposed President Cornelius in his ef
forts to bring politics Into the union.
This issue was the whole cause for the
preferment of the chaTRes by the ex
ecutive council against thesa men and
their subsequent expulsion from the
organization.
In November, 1902, these officers of
the union and others began to realize
that Cornelius was bringing politics
into the union too strongly. They ac
cused him of working for his own per
sonal gain, d6lng politics for a news
paper, etc., and claimed that he got
$100 a day during the last gubernatorial
election for working among the car
men to secure their votes for his can
didate. -They allege that the president,"
ever his election to office, has
worked the union for what he could get
out of it and has cared nothing for the
members, other than to make a grand
stand play in order that he might hdld
his job.
CHARGES AGAINST DIXGWALL.
The specific charge against Dingwall
reads: "You are charged by the com
mittee with violation of obligation,
with meeting in secret and conspiring
â¢against the welfare of the union and
its president in particular." The same
charge was made applicable to John
son, Jane, Hardy, E. Gogglns and O. A.
Kittlnger. The executive council met
and the date of their trial was fixed at
December 13. ' On the night of that
date all of the men were expelled from
the union with the exception of Gog
gins.
Dingwall claims that he was wrong
fully and unlawfully expelled from the
membership of the union. His attor
neys. Judge A. A. Sanderson and Weil
& Lippitt, claim that the president and
the executive council of the union have
no right by their constitution or by
laws to expel any one rrom the union
except as the constitution states: For
giving out the quarterly password to
others than^members of the union; the
giving out of any information contrary
to the local division; and according to
the by-laws the president only has the !
power to fine any member who is dis
orderly at a meeting. It further states
that all other cases must be left to
the executive council for the Imposition
of. fines. Nothing is said regarding ex
pulsion.

dissatisfied faction was printed and dis

on. the various lines in the city and
secure men to vote against Cornelius.
The card got up read as follows:
