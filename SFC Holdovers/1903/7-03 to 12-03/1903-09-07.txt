SOFIA, Bulgaria, Sept. 6Lâ According to
reliable reports from Varna, at the recent
council of ministers, presided over by
Prince Ferdinand at the palace of Euxi

should continue to maintain an attitude
of the strictest neutrality in the Macedo

stringent measures should be adopted to
prevent anything likely to cause a dis
turbance in Bulgaria's relations with Tur
key.
The war minister is reported to have
spoken stronglyln the council against any
thought of Bulgaria declaring war on Tur
key: first on account of the enormous ex
penditure that such a war would in

powers would never Dcrmit Bulgaria to
reap the advantage if she -were victorious.

The explosions were followed by an out

"WHERE EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN TO
PROTECT FOREIGN DIPLOMATS AGAINST ASSASSINATION.
The fact is commented on by the officers
that prior to the death of Mrs. Green a
widow from Forbestown. in Butte County,
lived at the home of the Greens for a
long time and left there just before the
wife's death. For a few days she re
mained at Paraiso Springs and then re
turned to Watsonville. She has since
been living at Green's residence.
The "sweating" of Green was concluded
late this afternoon and no effort was
made to detain him. District Attorney
Knight said to-night that the evidence is
not conclusive enough to justify a crimi
nal charge, but he thinks the results of
the inquiry which will be continued to
morrow will furnish a basis upon which
to rest such a charge and enable the
officers to make an arrest. The case has
assumed a most sensational aspect, and
the development of the investigation is
being eagerly watched.
To the inquisitors Green said that on
last Thursday night his wife had retired
about an hour after he did, and he con
jectured that she had left the gas jet
open after having first extinguished the
light. He related that he awakened some
hours later and discovered the room full
of gas. The theory of the ofliccrs is that
It was not Mrs. Green who allowed the
gas to escape.
Mrs. Green had lived here a number of
ytars and had by thrift acquired a com
tortable fortune. About three years ago
she surprised her friends by marrying
Green, who had but a short time before
come to Watsonville. She was 67 years
old when she died. During her residence
here she had devoted some time to liter
ary work and was considered a writer of
more than ordinary ability.
The officers state that Green had been
married four tjmes before he met the
.woman whose sudden death Is now being
Investigated. Efforts are being made to
ascertain precisely what caused the
deaths of the first, second and third
wives. It is said by the authorities that
some mystery attached to the passing of
these women. The fourth wife obtained a
divorce and Is now living at Morgan HH1.
PROSPECT OF ARREST.
The result of the investigation by these
officials has not been completely made
known, but they declare that they have
found much data of a sensational nature
and have hopes that the evidence will
warrant an arrest to-morrow. Green, the
husband of the woman, has undergone a
severe "sweating" process, during which
the officers obtained from him a state
ment of minutest detail concerning every
incident before and after Mrs. Green was
killed by monoxide poisoning.
STORY OF HUSBAND.
WATSONVILLE, Sept. 6.â Sheriff Tras
ton. District Attorney Knight and the
Chief of Police w*ere engaged all of yes
terday and a considerable part of to-day
in probing what they believe are sus
picious circumstances surrounding the
death last Thursday night of Mrs. Elvira
Scales Green, an aunt of Bill Nye, the
famous humorist.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Mrs. Elvira Scales Green, an
aunt of Bill Nye, died at her home
in Watsonville last Thursday
night, supposedly from asphyxia
tion by illuminating gas. She was
a woman of considerable means
and three years before had mar
ried R. Green, a comparative
stranger, Â¦who four times before
had entered the matrimonial state.
The authorities suspect that Mrs.
Green was murdered, and the hus
band is being closely examined.
The causes of the deaths of three
of his jj early Â¦..wives arc . being
probed. The District Attorney
believes- that enough evidence
may be obtained to-day to war
rant an arrest.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The train bear
ing President Roosevelt and party
reached Richmond Hill. L. I., a little
ahead of time, but was held there ten
minutes awaiting the coming of Jacob A.
Rils, who is to accompany the President
to Syracuse. Long Island City was
reached at 9:55 p. m. and the travelers
were brought into Manhattan by a boat
of the Thirty-fourth-street ferry line.
Here the President- was met by Police
Commissioner Francis V. Greene, with
four "plain clothes" men, among whom
President Roosevelt recognized Sergeant
Edward J. Bourke, whom he recalled for
his efficiency in enforcing the excise law
while Mr. Roosevelt was at the head of
the New York Police Board, and later as
a member of the Rough Riders in Cuba.
The President greeted Sergeant Bourke
cordially and spoke in high commenda
tion of the officer's work as it had come
under his observation.
Carriages conveyed President Roose
velt and the others of his party across
the city to the Christopher-street ferry.
'xÂ»iere being time to spare, Instead of go
ing directly across the North River to the
Delaware, La cka wanna and Western
Railroad station, the boat was headed up
stream for some distance, all enjoying
the ride on the river. The Presidential
train pulled out of the station at 11:45.
OYSTER BAY, L. I., Sept. 6.â President
Roosevelt left at 9 o'clock for Syracuse,
N. Y., where to-morrow he will open for
mally the New York State Fair and de
liver a i-.abor day address. Shortly be
fore 9 o'clock the President arrived at the
station in one of his own carriages from
Sagamore Hill. A ' t goodly crowd of
townspeople had assembled at the station
to see him depart and wish him a suc
cessful Journey. He was cheered as he
passed along the station platform and in
response he lifted his hat, greetlnjr two
or three of his acquaintances cordially.
The train on which he traveled to Long
Island City was a Long Island Railroad
special consisting of two carsâ President
Baldwin's private car and a combination
car. The President was accompanied by
Secretary Loeb, several members of the
executive force, representatives of the
press associations and four secret service
officers.
ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK.
STARTS FROM OYSTER BAY.
During his ride. thr^u^h^ tj^^gf^ p,^
this" city' the crowds wilT be kept back
from the curbstone and detectives will
carefully watch the throngs in the vicinity
of starting and stopping points. Even
those in the windows along the route of
the procession will be under surveillance.
Unless the President strongly objects the
stand at the Fair Grounds, where he is
to review the parade of the National As
sociation of Letter Carriers, and which is
to be surrounded by a high wire fence,
will mark the limits within which no one
not personally known to his escort will be
allowed to appear. This will keep the
crowd 100 feet distant on each side.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., Sept. 6.â Guarded as
no other President in the United States
ever was guarded in times of peace or
war. Theodore Roosevelt Is to be hedged
about while in. this city to-morrow.
Never for a moment will there be less
than 100 armed protectors around him.
The populace will be kept at a distance.
The elaborate precautions, taken include
the constant attendance of the usual body
guard of secret service men and detectives
from Washington, whose numbers have
been greatly increased; a company of Na
tional Guard and one hundred local po
licemen, making at least' 300 armed men
in all.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
It is probable that the presidential can
didates will be General Rafael Reyes the
Vice President and Jose Manuel Marro
<]uin, the acting President.
Senor Macaro, acting President of \he
Senate, expresses his admiration for the
noble and sincere policy pursued by the
United States and hopes that the canal
will be opened by them. He says he re
grets that he was obliged to oppose the
Hay-Herran treaty as being a violation of
the laws and the constitution, but he will
work strongly for a canal treaty satisfac
tory to both countries. Senor Abaldia,
who has decided to support the canal
treaty, has been appointed Governor of
I'anama. He will leave for ills post to
morrow.
Senator Obaldia, who has been ap
pointed Governor of Panama, left to-day
for his post. He will take with him a
canal plan which, it is said, will satisfy
all. Representative Fabrega also left for
Panama.
Intense excitement has been produced
here by a cablegram reporting the prob
ability of the United States dealing direct
ly with Panama in the canal matter.
BOGOTA, Sept. â¬.-The canal committee
of Congres has presented a proposed law
ratifying the rejection of the Panama
canal treaty and authorizing the Govern
ment to enter Jnto new negotiation with
the United States. Discussion of this pro
ject, which will take a wide range, will
begin to-morrow. The committee holds
that the rights and concessions acquired
by the French Panama Canal Company
and by the Panama Railroad must be re
spected and cannot be transferred to for
eign Governments or companies until
agreed to by Colombia. It is proposed
that the Colombian Government shall
jruarantec the neutrality of the canal,
wnflc retaining sovereignty. Mixed tri
bunals are provided for and Colombia is
to guarantee and maintain order.
No cables have been received from the
United States relative to the impression
produced there by the rejection of the
treaty. President Marroquin sent to Con
press to-day a special message limiting its
discussion to a few questions, including
that of the canal. Congress is now holding
day and night sessions. Â«

Special Dispatch to The Call
The train was made up of five cars and
was pulled S by " locomotive No. 1460. In
charge of Engineer William Dunton.
This locomotive is of the new Atlantic
type, weighing 177,000 pounds. It. is the
most powerful style in service on the Bal
timore and Ohio Railroad. An extra large
water -tank helped . in this performance,
saving stops for water. From Garrett
into. Chicago another locomotive of the
same type 'took, the; train*, On this run a
speed of seventy-six miles an hour wad
reached. \ The performance between Chi
cago. Junction- and Garrett could have
been duplicated had not tne ; train been
blocked by train ahead. This compelled
slowing down- several times. The dis
tance of 131 miles between Garrett, Ind.,
and South Chicago was, however, cov
ered in 153 minutes, making the whole run
of . 259 miles in = 278 minutes. .

tance traversed is between Chicago Junc
tion, Ohio, and Garrett, Ind. During the

you may choose from two classes â those you need and those you read for recreationâ or else you take
THE DELINEATOR and combine both. If the word "necessary" is susceptible of a superlative, THE
DELINEATOR is beyond all question the "most necessary** of all the magazines published for Woman.
4 Nine hundred thousand families proved this to be so laft month'; and each month brings its new
thousands of members into the evergrowing DELINEATOR FAMILY.
Among the fashions it is the "most necessary"' because it is all the fashion magazines in one, with
their mistakes eliminated, their exaggerations corrected, and the really successful novelties stamped with the seal
of authoritative approval, for if it is pictured in THE DELINEATOR it is "good form/* It is equally the "most
necessary" in the Nursery, in the Sewing-Room, in the Kitchen, throughout the whole house and out-of-doors,
in city and in country. The partial list of contents below can only hint at the interest underlying every line.
The Evolution of a Club Woman, by Agnes Surbridge, begins in this number. It is ah autobiography and is the predicted success of the year.
>i J. C. Hemment, the world-famed camera expert, begins one of the most remarkable series of photographic articles ever presented. They relate to his
personal adventures at home and in foreign lands. The Silent Partner, by Lynn Roby Meekins ; A Florida Cracker, by Virginia Frazer Boyle, are
prominent among the fiction features, while the departments are fuller than usual of good things, with especial interest centering in the children's pages.

I from his Government have given no inti
m.ition of such action. The three Sen
j ators from Panama, with one exception
j (and he was bitterly opposed to the
j treaty), and the six members of the
i House of Representatives have assidu
j ously worked for the ratification of the
I treaty. Their defection at this time. Dr.
j Herran realizes, would be a serious blow
j to the prospects for ratification. The one
J Panama Senator who has^pposed the
Â¦ treaty has never lived in Panama, al
j though being elected to the higher body
Â¦ ftom that department. The defection of
the Panama delegates. It is suggested
here, might be In the nature of a protest
over the attitude of the opposition to the
treaty, with the possibility of secession
from the National Government.
Dr. Herran still clings to the hope that
a way will be found whereby the present
treaty will be ratified. He lays much
stress on the possibility that the Senate
may agree to a measure to be subse
quently passed by the House, where there
is said to be a majority for the treaty,
giving President Marroquin authority to
negotiate directly an Instrument along

BULGARIAN VILLAGES ARE PILLAGED

|-^v EN LOMOND, Sept. 6.â Having
v/ recuperated from last night's
festivities, the members of the
1 Â» Â»^ Harmonie Singing Society, who
are enjoying a three days' outing
in the Santa Cruz Mountains, were pre
pared for another strenuous day. The
high jinks held last night will live long in
the annals of the society. It was for
members only, ami the fun was uncon
fined. Max Dunow's clever sketch was
up-to-date and created a great deal of
merriment.
To-day's programme opened with cere
mony. Toasts to absent members were
drunk and then breakfast was served in
the big dining-room. After breakfast the
members gathered in front of the hotel
and made the woods resound with song.
Professor Rigger led the singing, which
was of high order. Luncheon was served
In the open air.
In the afternoon the members took part
in bowling, shooting and swimming con
tests for prizes. The competition was
very keen and the sports afforded great
amusement to onlookers.
During the course of the second ban
quet this evening President Henry Plage
rnann delivered the following definition
of the word ' harmonie":
"The simple utterance of the word 'har
mony' produces a soothing effect. The
sense is complete. The word 'harmonie 1
means much more. Something that ha^i
been accomplished; acting together to a
common end; agreeing in action and feel
ing; living in peace and friendship, as a
harmonious family. This word should be
graven upon every man's heart."
Speeches were also delivered by John
Plagemann, Professor Rigger, Charles Al
pers and others. The evening's entertain
ment consisted of a concert at the hotel.
The Harmonie orchestra, led by Julius
Haug, rendered selections. The concert
lasted until a late hour and was enjoyed
by scores of visitors.
The organization will depart from here
to-morrow afternoon. Every one is hav
ing a cood time and is loth to leave
this charming spot. Among those here
are the following;

Moore fell from his buggy J'-ist whers
Reeves' rig passed him and after rising
walked a number of steps and fell dead.
In explaining the shots to Charles Swett
and his wife. Reeves said ha had shot
a rabbit. Reeves later -went home and
sent his son to notify another neighbor
that he had found a dead man on tha
road. Then he came to Modesto. Con
stable Davis arrested him when he wa3
nearly home again. Reeves refused to
discuss the crime, except to say that he
had shot his enemy.
MODESTO, Sept. Â«. â One farmer mur
dered another near this city about day
light this morning. Summers Moore was
killed by I*. P. Reeve*, Moore was shot
twice with a C-califcer riflÂ«, one Â«hot
passing throng^ his heart, the other en
tering about an Inch below the right nip
ple and passing throngh the body with
a backward course. When found Moor a
was unarmed, not eren. fcaÂ»ins a pocket
knife on his person.
Reeves at first denied' the crime, but
when confronted with Indisputable evi-.
dence confessed to the arresting ofScer,
Constable Davis, that he fired the shorn
that killed his neighbor. Both men have
families-. The dead man leaves a wife
and son. while Reeves has a wife and a.
large family of children.
EpcdaX rrtsrpEtch ts The CaS,
COLONEL IS SURPRISED.
"We will be able to prove that all the
rtatcments which Colonel Griffith made
on the nipht of the shooting were made
to defend his wife. He hap not thought of
himself in this matter at all until forced
to do so by his arrest. The arrest was
as unexpected to him as the shooting
was and he was more surprised that his
Â¦w-ife should make her accusation of at
tempted murder than he was that she
should shoot herself." *
It is further understood that the de
fense will go back in the history of the
family and attempt to prove that at the
time of the death of Rrls>walter from
blood poiFonin? Mrs. Griffith threatened
to take her life; that suicide had been in
her mind for many pears.
On the other hand the prosecution is far
It was the reaction from the intense
nervous strain under which the man has
l?<?on since Thursday and the after effect
of long-continued drinking, for it is posi
tively known that Colonel- Griffith has
been drinking heavily for many days. In
fact, many* of his peculiar actions since
the yhooting have been attributed by his
friends to drink.
Contrary to the general opinion that
ihe defense will make a clajm of acci
dent, it 5s stated on well-prounded au
thority 'that the defence will claim that
Mrs. Griffith was shot by her own act in
an attÂ«*pt to commit suicide. Colonel
'.riffith would never consent to the insan
ity claim, notwithstanding the fact that
his wife and relatives take that view of
the matter and would be glad to liave
such a verdict rendered by the jury.
"We are not wrfecutTg Colonel Grif
fith," said I. B. Dockweiler. "We simply
feel that he should be incarcerated and
if the jury delivers a verdict of insanity
we will be pleased that he may have the
comforts of a private asylum, but If It
delivers a verdict of attempt to murder
we believe that he should go to jail, and
lastly, if the defense endeavors to prove
that Mrs. Griffith attempted to commit
suicide, in the event of her death within
the next week. I hope that he will hang."
Colonel Griffith has made the claim
from the first that he was attempting to
defend his wife when he made the state
ment at Santa Monica and afterward that
the shooting was" Accidental. Speaking
of this to-day, William H. Knight, secre
tary of Colonel Griffith, said:
LOS. ANGELES. Sept. 6^-Colonel
fith J. Griffith broke down and cried to
day when offered sympathy by a friend.
He epent the day at the residence of Dr.
E. M. Griffith, Sixteenth, and Valencia
streets, and the day proved the hardest
one for him clnco tho shooting of Mrs.
Griffith Thursday night.
A friend of tho colonel called at the
house to extend hiÂ« sympathy and found
h!m lying on a couch on the front porch,
with a litht blanket thrown over him.
Griffith arose and extended his hand with
his ueual cordiality, but. the hand was hot
and feverish and lacked- the energetic grip
which generally accompanies his hand
clasp.
"I have but a moment to stay. Colonel
Griffith." said the friend, "but I want to
know how you are getting on and see if
there is anything I can do for you. No
man vras ever placed in a more terrible
position, and I feel for you. No matter
Â¦whether you shot your wife or not, no
man can ever make me believe that you
Â«Jld so with malice aforemought. Tou
have my sympathy, and I pity you from
the bottom of my heart."
Such sympathy' proved too much for
Colonel Griffith, and this strong roan, who
Â¦was never before known to los^ his com
posure, broke down. His face twitched
as he tried to answer and the cords In
the beck of his nerk moved up and down,
the veins on his forehead swelled, and his
eyes filled with tears. He' cried like a
child. He was apparently suffering
agony, and. placing his Tjand ever his
eyes, he said in broken words:
"I am very tired. I am feverish. I
do not fee! well." and he flovrly turned
and entered the house, assisted by Dr.
Griffith.

The car from Nashua carrying fifty-four
passengers for Cannobie Lake, a summer
resort, approached the curve a quarter of
a mile west of Pelham Center at terrific
speed, accentuated by a down Rrade. The
cars met on a curve, neither motorman
seeing the approaching car until too late
to avoid a collision. Neither was there
time for the passengers to escape by
jumping- when the cars came together
with a force that threw the westbound
car directly under the '-forward part of
the other, crushing the top of the car
down upon the passengers and pinioning
those occupying the first turee seats in
the wreckage.
Persons who witnessed the collision
stated afterward that it came so unex
pectedly that it seemed some minutes
before the passengers realized what had
happened. All were silent and the pas
sengers made no outcry, appearing dazed
by the shock.
Near the accident were a number of
campers who at once rushed to the scene.
With crowbars and other instruments
the wrecked roofs of the cars were pried
up and the imprisoned passengers re
leased. None of the parsengcrs on the
two cars escaped injury or some sort, al
though a number were not seriously hurt.
Ae the accident took place at some dis

each running, it Is said, at a rate of more
than twenty miles an hour, four persons
werÂ» killed and nineteen were so serious
ly Injured that they are under physicians'
care and several of these are expected to
die. There were seventy passengers on the
two cars and many others received cuts
and minor wounds which did not prevent
their going to their homes. The accident
occurred on the line which runs through
this town between Lowell and Nashua
and one of the care which was coming
from the latter city, was nearly fliled with
people on their way to a summer resort.
The collision was due, according to the
officials of the road, to a misunderstand

by shutting oft the power and trying to

Cramps' bid of $3,890,000 for the armored
cruiser Pennsylvania did not include the
cost of coppering, which may be set at
515.OC0, including dockage, making a dif
ference of $155,000 in the contract price of
the sheathed and unsheathed ships. On
the Nebraska the difference was only
$36,600, Fore River estimated the c!ftra
cost of battleships at $150,000 and $175,000
on the armored cruisers, while the New
port News gave the. corresponding figures
at $50,000 and 4110,000.* The Union Iron
Works submitted 150,000 as, the excess in
cost of an armored cruiser sheathed.
The board of construction. com
posed of the bureau Chiefs, were not
agreed on the sheathed ship proposition,
only one member, Chief Constructor
Hichborn, being in favor of It and the
other four vigorously opposing. Mr.
Hichborn. however, carried his point
with the Senate and House, and contracts
were made for the ships as shown In the
tables. On March i, 1901. Hichborn was
retired, having reached the retirement
age of 62 years, and was succeeded by
Bowles, the designer and builder of the
Texas. Bowles does not favor sheathed
ships*, and the board of construction be
ing thus unanimous against this mode of
construction Congress repealed its former
act and the Secretary modified contracts
already entered Into. The question of
cost was one of i the objections raised
against sheathed ships. Hichborn, who
was the only practical shipbuilder on the
board, estimated the extra cost of
sheathing at $141,512 for the battleships
and $128,880 for the armored cruisers. The
other bureau chiefs, not having any per
sonal knowledge on the subject, obtained
estimates from a prominent Philadelphia
shipbuilder, who gave the figures at
$243,750 for battleships and $279,250 for ar
mored cruisers. The board, having ac
cepted and quoted the latter estimates,
must, in all consistency, base its reduc
tions on these figures, and it will be some

SOME days ago there came from Europe a story
of a partially successful effort to overcome total
blindness by the use of radium, and shortly
afterward a much more elaborate story was reported
of a similar experiment in New York. The New
York test was said in the early dispatches to have
been completely successful, but later there came re
ports that a good many experts were doubtful of
the genuineness of the test, and it was intimated that
experimenters should be careful in exposing the
more delicate parts of the human body to the power
ful influences of radio activity.
An ; emphatic second is given to the warning by
Thomas A. Edison, who is reported as. saying that
there is danger more harm than good may be
done by the use of radium in the treatment of blind
ness or disease by inexperienced practitioners. Edi
son has had experience, for he has not only suf
fered himself, but has had some of his workmen
severely injured by exposure to the rays. In a recent
I interview he is quoted as saying:
"Besides nearly losing my sight I am suffering ter
ribly from my stomach. The powerful X-rays and
the rays from the radium with which I experimented
have caused big knots to form in my gastric regions
and no physician seems to know exactly what they
?.re. I have consulted many specialists, but they all
admit they are puzzled. I have been- unable to get
any relief because no one can diagnose my case.
This is only an instance of what fluorescents can do
to a man. The rays work in some mysterious way,
and we can't tell what harm they are going to do be
cause we don't know how they will do it."
Benjamin S. Baker in a recent review of some of
the wild expectations which human credulity has built
uoon the 'reports of radium enemies savs: "Radium
RADIUM AS A CURE
The wholesale slaughter of women and children in
the Balkans, both by Turks and revolutionists, places
the savage combatants beyond the pale of human
sympathy. Americans surely can have no other in
terest in the barbaric warfare except a horror of its
unspeakable atrocities and a determined purpose to
protect those who should stand in the shadow of
our flag. Although our consular representative was
not even threatened, the American naval demonstra
tion served as a splendid purpose in showing a readi
ness to guard our own or visit swift vengeance upon
assassins.
Traveling by rail in the Balkans, even under pres
ent conditions, is a pleasure excursion in comparison
to the way they are now. doing things in Montana.
A train proceeded through the State a few days ago
attended by a small army of detectives and protected
by forty horses, saddled and bridled for use, and a
Gatling gun in the baggage car ahead. It is thus
that we pay tribute to .the enterprising genius of our
highwaymen.
One thousand of the troops of the Sultan of Mo
rocco were ambushed a few days ago and slain. And
still we insist that the human race makes its progress
through the world*1n a vastly different manner from
the beasts of the forest. The survival of the fittest
is as stern and as inexorable a law to men as it is to
animals.
The steam trial last week of the cruiser
Cleveland, one of six vessels under con
struction since December, 1SD9, Is rather
disappointing. It was confidently antici
pated that a speed of 17 knots would be
reached, but It fell below 16>,4 as required
by contract. It is possible that with im
proved propellers the speed may be in
creased, but even at 17 knots these ships
do not compare favorably with similar
type3 In the German navy. The latter
have a speed of 22 knots, an advantage
somewhat offset by carrying only ten 4
lnch guns, whereas the American ships
carry ten 5-inch guns, but a difference of
five to six knots is, however, a very im
portant factor.
The Navy Department and shipbuilders
have been struggling for seventeen
months with- the problem determining
the contract cost of three battleships and
three armored cruisers now under con
struction. On December 7, 1900, bids were
opened for building five battleships and
six armored cruisers, and in January and
February following , contracts were
awarded to six successful bidders. Three
of the battleships and three of the ar
mored cruisers were to be wood-sheathed
and coppered, while the remainder were
to be unsheathed. The several bidders
had graded their prices accordingly, vary
ing In their estimates of extra cost of
sheathed and coppered ships from $36,600
to 5175,000. By act of Congress of March
3,. 1901, It was left disgretlonary with the
Secretary of the Navy to have the ves
sels sheathed and coppered, and upon rec
ommendation . of the board of bureau
chiefs and the several contractors, be
consented to the simpler and less costly
THE armored cruiser Pennsylvania,
launched August 22 last at
Cramp's yard. Philadelphia, is the
third vessel in the United States
navy bearing that name. The original
Pennsylvania was a battleship pierced
for 136 guns, and carried sixteen
8-inch and one hundred and four
32 pounders on three decks. The
keel was laid . at the Philadel
phia navy yard in 1822, but the launching
did not take place until July, 1S37, Commo
dore Biddle performing the ceremony of
naming the ship, by breaking a bottle of
grog on the stern as the vessel moved
down the ways. The Pennsylvania was
a giant of those days, with a tonnage of
3241, a lower deck length of 220 feet,~53
feet extreme breadth, her main yard 110
feet In length and a sail area of 18,341
yards. Her total cost was $634,500 and tho
complement of officers and crew 1100. Her
annual expense of commission was I3S2,
432, but barring a few short ( cruises tho
ship had no active service and was util
ized at the Norfolk navy yard as a re
ceiving ship, where she was burned with
other naval vessels April, 1861. The sec
ond Pennsylvania, originally named Ke
wayden, was a screw steamer of 4000 tons
displacement and was built at the Boston
navy yard during the Civil War. The
ship was never launched and was broken
up on the stocks In 1884, realizing about
$15,000 for the old material of hull and
machinery,, upon which nearly $1,000,00.)
had been expended In construction.
To those unfamiliar with the terms
"sheathed" and "unsheathed" ships, th*?
difference may be briefly explained as fol
lows: A sheathed vessel is one on which
the bottom plating Is covered with wood
planking, teak or pine, fastened to the
skin by means of naval brass screw bolts.
This planking after being thoroughly
calked Is covered with felt sheets upon
which copper sheeting, weighing about
eight pounds per square foot, is laid and
fastened to the wood skin with composi
tion nails. The lower half of the stern
and stern post are made of bronze and

sure tight work and preventing access of
water between the planking and the steel
skins, which would set up galvanic action

John York was born in Granger County,
Tennessee, June 15, 1S20, and is a son of
Enoch and Nancy Hill York. When 13 j
years old with his parents he moved to
Warren County, Tennessee, where the
family resided until 1S41. He then emi
grated west and settled in Dade County.
Missouri, where he engaged in farming
until 1S54. On September 5. 1841. he was
married to Lucinda Hudson, a native of
Lafayette County. Missouri.
On .April 15,1545, Mr. York started in
Captain John Grlgsby's company of more
than one hundred men across the plains to
California, arriving at Johnson's Ranch
on October 15. With three other men of
the party he continued his journey to
Napa County, arriving at Calistoga. then
known as the Hot Springs, in November.
He resided in Calistoga until the Bear
Flag war in June 1S46. when for protection
he removed his family to Sonoma.
Lieutenant P.evere. in command of a
Government vessel â¢ at San Francisco,
upon taking command 01 the forces at
Sonoma entrusted York and Sam Kelsey
with the important duty of carrying the
American flag from Sonoma to Sacra
mento and delivering it to Captain Sutter
at his fort, which dut^r- these two brave
young rnpr. faithfully and promptly per
formed. In the fall of 3S48 Mr. York re
turned to hi* ranch at <\illstoera. where
he remained until 1S4S, when upon the dl'
covery of gold he moved his family to
the mines and began operations below
Coloma. He continued there for two
weeks and then proceeded to Hangtown
(Placerville), he mined until Sep
tember, meeting with success, after
which he returned to his Napa County
homo. In 1S-I9 he returne'd to the mines
for about six weeks.

The great markets all report the influx of large
numbers of buyers, which would not be the case
were business at all dull. The bank clearings show
a loss of 1 1.2 per cent from last year, but all the
important cities except !Cew York and Baltimore ex
hibit gains, running as high as 29.9 per cent at
Chicago. The aggregate clearings, curiously enough,
itand at about the returns of a week ago, being
$1,659,000,000. It will be remembered that there was
a sudden drop in these aggregate clearings during
the preceding week and they have not yet recovered,
though there is no further shrinkage. The failures
for the week were 191, against 200 last year, and
were chiefly confined to small financial institutions
and manufacturers. A good sign was a recovery in
the Chicago provision market toward the close of
the week, buying being larger and of a better quality,
while more confidence in the future of prices was free
ly expressed. The tendency of the provision market
is one of the best indicators for trade we have. An
other good sign was a sudden urgent demand for
wheat for milling purposes all over the country, which
was so marked that on Friday all Western markets
were higher than Chicago. The Hungarian Minis
ter of Agriculture, a recognized authority on the
wheat conditions of the world, estimates that this
year's- crop th'e" world over will fall about 11 per cent
binder that of last year, and he also reports that last
year's supply was all eaten up. If his conclusions
are correct, and there is no reason to doubt them,. a
frjood year in wheat is to be expected and this means
good timts for the farmers for another period.
To summarize: Times are still good; we are con
servative where we were reckless; money is not
strained anywhere; the crops are excellent and bring
ing remunerative prices: manufactories as a rule are
well employed and labor is receiving high wages;
general merchandise markets report the movement of
goods active and there is.no mercantile disturbance
either in Europe or the United States. These con
ditions constitute what Is known as "srood times "
CURRENT conditions in trade continue cheer
ful. The feeling of pessimism throughout the
country, so pronounced during the past few
weeks, and which had begun to unduly affect busi
1 ess. has largely passed away as the country
realizes that there is nothing in sight to get fright
ened over. But conservatism has asserted itself and
st present is the ruling feature all over the land.
There is no longer any perturbation. Wall street
has had its spasm and after the great banking inter
ests had assured the commercial public that condi
tions were sound if only left alone to develop on
normal lines, confidence began to be restored. We
tee now that we overdid it for several years. Dun's I
weekly review of the situation hits it exactly when j
it says: "A startling contrast is shown when com
parison is made with the corresponding week of last
year in trade. Prices were then tending upward in
many branches of industry, new business was coming
forward more rapidly than it had been, and in the
security market all records for activity and high
prices were being surpassed. Later events have
demonstrated that the situation was unhealthy
and speculative excesses have been followed !
by reaction and readjustment. Conservatism
was then the exception; it is now the rule. Pros
pects for steady gains and their maintenance arc
brighter under the present system. Legitimate busi
ness will continue to suffer from speculation and the
high rate for exchange will militate against indus
trial expansion, but in the long run a larger degree
of caution should prove beneficial."
The leading features of the past week were more
favorable crop developments, less talk of a coming
scarcity cf money in the regular fall movement to
supply means tor moving the crops and a visible ex
pansion in fall trade. With the exception of the
cotton and iron industries, the manufacturing lines
report orders sufficient to keep the mills well em
ployed. Lower prices have checked the production
of iron and steel, and a larger crop of cotton than
expected has led to lower prices for this important
product and rendered buyers cautious. Labor strikes
in the woolen industry have lately unsettled that mar
ket here and in the East, but the latter markets
are quoted firm with a demand sufficient to absorb
the output. The footwear factories of New England
are doing very well, though hides and leather are
weak, the latter being kept uncertain by some labor
friction. The West reports a firm lumber market
and the lumber trade of the Pacific Coast is active,
with good prospects for continuing so. Although the
rush season in railroading has only just commenced
there is already talk of car scarcity and congested
traffic at a number of points, and the railway earn
ings show gains of 9.3 per cent over 1902 and 17.4 per
cent over 1901. It must be borne in mind, however,
that increased wages and cost of material cut down
the net earnings considerably from the gross showing.
CONSERVATISM RULES TRADE.
WHILE the attention of the public has been
given with more or less impatience during
the last ten days to reports of the contests
between the two white winged drifting machines off
Sandy Hook, a good many reaWy lively things have
happened and passed unheeded. It' is but right that
some note be made of the more remarkable of these
minor items, for since we live in a mutable world
we should watch the mutations.
Ever since the victory of the reform elements
among the people of New York, the election of
Mayor Low and the retirement of Boss Croker to
England, it has been believed that the Tammany
tiger is sick*; indeed more than once he has been
cartooned as a dying tiger by local artists making
sketches as it were in the very lair of the beast. Well,
last week Tammany had a picnic for a portion, or
rather for a faction, of its braves. What are known
as "Haffen's Jeffersonians," 8000 strong, went for a
feast, and the reports. tell us that they consumed
26,060 ears of corn, 20,000 pounds of beef, 1800 pounds
of butter, 8000 pounds of fish, 10.000 pounds of
chicken. 3000 loaves of bread, 30,000 plates of ice
cream and 26,000 cigars. Without taking the trouble
to figure accurately what was the per capita con
sumption of the braves at that feast, it will be per
ceived they are not sick tigers by any means, nor
are they suffering from anything that tends to a loss
of appetite.
; While Haffen's Jeffersonians were getting away
with everything in signt at the picnic, a Rochester
man was making a still more remarkable record,
though on a different line. He is the father of a fam
ily of nine children. Near him lived a. neighbor with
eleven' children. (He felhin Hove swithhii Neighbor's
wife and she lovingly responded. Thereupon he
eloped with her and took the whole twenty children
along, thus breaking the elopement record and dis
tancing all competitors.
In "dear old London" a man was brought into
court the other day for failing to pay the license
which the city requires of those who keep men em
ployed as household servants. The plea of the ac
cused was that the man was a "housemaid" and did
nothing but housemaid's work. Investigation dis
closed that the housegirl has become so impossible
in London there is an increasing tendency to em
ploy men for such work. The defense was not per
mitted to stand in the courts, but the incident serves
to' show that when women crowd men out of the
shops and factories men can retaliate by invading the
domain of housework and driving the girls from what
was once looked upon as woman's stronghold.
At the recent universal peace convention the com
mittee on platform instead of drawing up a series of
"resolutions" recommended the adoption of a num
ber of doctrines as the "convictions" of the congress.
The change from the customary word has been well
received by those who have paid it any attention. To
declare a conviction that white is black is much more
modest than to "resolve" that white is black, and
since modesty is becoming more and more a charac
teristic of Americans in convention, perhaps the con
ventional word will be eliminated altogether before
the close of the century and we shall have a nation
full of politicians standing by their convictions in
stead of asserting their resolutions.

A Michigan man mistook his child for a crow a
few days ago and killed her. It is such incidents as
this that make us wonder why the directors of our
civilization, who have given us^much to protect us
against criminals, have done nothing to guard us
against fools. The silly season has drifted into a
continuous performance in jhe United States.
AMERICA'S great Labor day will be celebrated
this year under the fairest of auspices and
amid the most propitious surroundings. It is
'true that the year has had its struggles and its trials
for labor and for capital alike, the stress and strain of
Strife are felt even at this time in many localities; but
when the conditions of labor are compared with those
of former years the advantage is with the present,
and those who have been earnestly engaged in the
task of advancing the welfare of labor and of bring
ing about a complete harmony between the employer
and the employe can note with satisfaction that much
has been accomplished and that a distinct movement
has been made toward the goal which both the capi
talist and the laborer desire .to reach.
The very fact that such a festival as this is now
observed and honored throughout the Union attests
the advance that has been made in the cause of labor.
The time is not so very far in the past when the
praise given to labor was hardly more than a tribute
of words. Men delighted to recite "labor, labor,
honest labor," but outside of oratory', poetry and ser
mons there was but little recognition of the import
ant part the worker occupies in the social organism.
To-day the tribute which will be paid to the workers
will be sincere and earnest. The statesman as well
as the politician, the student of sociology as well as
the demagogue, now recognizes the power of the
workers and honors it as one of the most potent of
the social forces that are slowly but surely develop
ing a new civilization that will be better than the old.
The onward march of humanity must be always ac
companied by more or less of strife, for we live in a
world where the equilibrium of things is maintained
by the balance of mutually opposing forces. Where
the advance is made through the medium of human
energy, there must also be errors and blunders as
well as conflicts, for to err is human. It would
therefore be absurd to review our industrial march
without taking note of the fact that there have been
mistakes committed both by those who uphold and
those who oppose the activities of organized labor.
Conceding the occurrence of such errors we can,
however, note with satisfaction that the sound
common sense of our people has been able to correct
errors when once they have been clearly seen to be
errors, and consequently each year sees us as a peo
ple nearer to the attainment of a fair degree of har
mony in the social order, so that progress can go on
more swiftly and more safely than in the past.
It needs but little familiarity with the history of,
American labor to see that however serious may be
the evils that still harass our industries, affairs on
the whole are vastly better than they were in the days
of our fathers. Labor in the America of to-day is
not only better paid, better fed, better clothed, bet-
I ter housed and better provided with all forms of ma
| terial good than it ever was before, but it is also
better educated, better trained, better inspired and,
better led. The men who are now presiding over
some of the greater labor organizations are men of
first-class ability and of the highest character. Amer
ica can. and docs, point to them with as much pride
as she feels in her greatest statesmen or her fore
most captains of industry. They and the masses of
the workers who support them are genuine Ameri
cans in heart and hand and bfain, and on this their
festal day the applause of the whole people will be
with them because the sympathies of the people are
with the cause they represent and serve.
In a special degree this year has been a year of
successful labor and industrial achievement. The
ringing music of shop and forge, of mill and engine,
has been continuous from the beginning to the close
of every working day all over the land. In our own
State and in our own city the outward evidences of
the tireless energy of the workers are to be seen in
the marvelous array of new buildings that adorn our
streets and in the preparations now under way for
other buildings yet to be erected. It is probable
that a greater amount of structural work has been
done in America this year than in any other land,
or in any previous year in the history of this land.
When so many new offices, factories, shops, stores,
hotels, churches, schools, homes and edifices. of all
kinds are demanded to supply the growing needs of
the people, we may be sure that all lines of industry
are prosperous, and that the workers have been doing
their full duty to their country and to the world.
Such being the case a labor festival is in order. If
there were no such day already appointed it would
have been proper to make one this year to fit the
present good of the social order and to hail the
promise of greater good to come. So to-day all
classes of Americans will remember that they are
workers and join most cordially in the celebration
of our national Labor day.
LABOR'S GREAT DAY.
has a powerful effect in causing substances on which
its radiations fall to become radio active in their
turn. This result was notably shown throughout
BecquereFs experiments, the metal fittings of his lab
oratory acquiring a strong induced radio activity. The
effect on Becquerel's own body was so pronounced
that for days after some of his more prolonged tests
of radium he could not go near his delicate electrical
measuring instruments without their showing the dis
turbing influences of the induced radiations from
him. Such action has been commonly noted by those
who have used X-ray machines for various purposes."
The object of those who are giving these words of
warning 'is not to discourage experiment, but to im
press upon rash experimenters the need of great
caution in applying the strange force to the human
system. It appears that the same force that improves
one man may injure another. Edison tells of a case
in which the X-ray acted as a curative to the person
to whom it was applied, but so injuriously affected
Edison's assistant who handled the rays that he has
lost one arm and is in danger oL losing the other.
Such. being the results thus far noted it is evident
that it will be well to proceed slowly with radium as
a curative force until something more is known of
the method of its work and its effects on the\ human
system. Â¦".-"

The publication of the Broslus report was In
accordance with the custom of the association
to give to the press matters of Importance In
which the public are supposed to be interested/
Tha.t it created a great deal of public interest
is quite evident.
I am "lad to have learned, since the letter
of Mr. Broslui called the subject to my atten
tion, that you had known something of the
dangers to which he refers previously; and am
especially pleased to know that you had taken
steps to investigate them and well contended
that the department should have the entire
credit of it; satisfied if we can aid In eome
degree in preventing the wrong that might
have resulted to the Indians from bein? con
summated, and especially gratified if the in
vestigators shall be absolutely unbiased. Too
often these official* appear to be under Influ

â¢ay "seem." I do not claim infallibility.
We make no charge, up to this time, against
any members of the Dawes Commission, nor, I
believe, doea our informant, Mr. .Broslus,
whose al.egatlons, you will observe, are gen
eral in their character.
1 would like to make one comment on the
closing passage In your letter, In which you
eay that "lnbpectors and other officials should
have respect and confidence until a clear ca^e
shall be made against them."
The inspector should be above suspicion, anJ

courtesy which you raise would. I think, in
volve a long diaousslon. I must, therefore,
content myself with utterly disclaiming the
least Intention of discourtesy to you.
In his reply Garrett says:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6.-To-day Secre
tary Hitchcock made public the corre
spondence between him and Philip C. Gar
rett of Philadelphla.presldent of the Indian
Rights Association. In a letter from Sec
retary Hitchcock to Garrett, written on
the 29th ultimo, the former charges the
president of the Indian Rights Associa
tion with discourtesy to the head of the
Interior Department in having permitted
the publication of the Broslus letter, al
leging irregularities on the part of Gov
ernment officials in the sale of Indian
lands before the Secretary had been given
time to pass upon the letter. Regarding
the alleged irregularities. Secretary
Hitchcock says:
I note with pleasure your desire not to wish
loeSnmt* any of the evils in the admlnis-
UaUon of the Indian Bureau and be* to state
that the "grave irregularity on the part of
officials appointed by the Government,' with
which you seem to have been impressed by the
report made to you by Mr. Broslus have for
months past, had my personal Â¦"mtion. thus
anticipating your courteous requwt that the
subject may be officially investigated.
This investigation was made by me -while on
a visit to the Indian Territory in Why, as the
result of -which certain removals from office
by dismissal and enforced resignation resulted,
and upon my return here amended rules and
regulations were prepared and issued on July
10 the purpose of which was to more fully pro
tect the Creek Indians in the matter of salea oÂ£
their land by a proper notice and the require
ment of sealed bids, by which such satisfac
tory results have bean accomplished in the mat
ter of tha sale of Inherited lands In other reser
vations throughout the country, none of tho
original deeds for the sale of lands under the
inherited act, nor lands in the Creek Nation
having been ud to that time, or elnce, ap-
On the contrary, in the mutter of the sale of
Inherited lands under the sealed-bid order, we
are receiving in many cases from 15 per cent
to 125 per cent advance over the original pricÂ«
tendered by the game parties for the same land,
while the Creek deeds under the old system
have all been disapproved, to the number of
423 deeds, and rÂ«turned with their accompany
ing checks, amounting to more than $360,000.
thus showing that, in the matter of official
Irregularities and the adoption of said regula
tlona, the interests of the Indians have not
been neglected by the department, as is Indi
rectly charged by Mr. Broslus, whose report I
do not care to further discuss, because the ac
cusation* therein contained are to receive a full
and rigid Investigation. They have been
promptly denied and such investigation de
manded by the members of the\ Dawes Com
mission and Inspector Wright, who are, of
course, entitled to be presumed Innocent In the

At noon to-day the entire executive
committee of the Mine Owners' Associa

General Bell and held a conference.
Brigadier General Chase was also in at

was not made public, but It is generally
believed that it had reference to the open-

Excitement was at its height on more
â¢than one occasion during the coursing
yesterday at Ingleside Park. The trials
Â¦were well contested, the hares being re
markably strong. Black Coon, L. M.
Connell's pride, covered himself with
glory and proved the worthy offspring of
Emln Pasha and Mamie Pleasant. His
trial with Doc Burns in the fourth round
proved one of the most exciting seen at
the park for many months. The course
lasted fwo minutes and a half, and It was
up and down field and working in and out
to the accompanying cries of the spec
tators. First one relief dog was released,
then a second and a third, until five grey
hounds went flying after the game hare.
After such a run It was natural to ex
pect the Coon had had enough for the
day, but later he came out and disposed
of White Hat after a run of one minute
and twelve seconds, with points 8 to 2.
The deciding course, in which Black
Coon and Sllevenaman were to meet,
went to the former by default. Slieven
aman was drawn owing to hard coursing.
The results in detail, with Judge Thom
as Tierney's official scores, follow:

The championship doubles will be played
Tuesday aTternoon. J. D. MacGavin and
Grant Smith, challengers, will meet A.
E. Bell and L. R. Freeman, holders.
These two teams met last year for the
championship ar.d a hard five-set match
resulted. MacGavin is not playing quite
as well as last year, but Smith Is much
improved.
The consolation tournament will be
played to-day and to-morrow and also
the mixed doubles, which were not com
pleted last week. The challenge match
in women's singles will be played Wednes
day morning. May Sutton, holder, will
neet Florence Sutton, challenger.
Tho following matchc# were played on
the park courts yesterday:
The crack tennis players of the coast
put in a strenuous week before the nets
at San Rafael last v.eek and were glad
of a respite yesterday. It was six days
of hard play for some of the men and
the effect in several cases was anything
but beneficial. The two. players most
used up are Grant Smith and R. N. Whit
ney. Smith has been ill since his match
with Bell on Friday, but will be able to
play m the challenge match of the dou
bles on Tuesday. It was a lack of train
ing In both. cases and neither will enter
another tournament without proper prep
aration. Any one who saw the Bell-Smitn
match on Friday would undoubtedly be
convinced that tennis is not a woman's
game, as a great many people think -who
observe It casually strolling through the
park.
The enthusiasts feel Â¦ encourased over
the showing made by the northern girls.
Although none of them won, a larger
number than usual competed and several
gave promise oft developing into good
players, if not Sutton beaters. Mis3
Hotchklss In Â£ year of two, with the
proper practice, will make the southern
ers who believe that "it takes a Sutton
to beat a Sutton" change their minds.
The little Berkeley player has the right
idea and should Improve her net game as
much as possible. A good net player will
conquer the Suttons, but a baseline play
er never.
A discussion arose last week between
a prominent player from the south and
one of the local men. The former stated
that there are not ten men In the State
who can beat May Sutton. The local play
ers do not agree and contend that there
are more than twice that number who
can beat her. This has been a mooted
question for two years and one that all
tennis followers would like to have set
tled. It would make an Interesting
match if she and some local player could
be brought together this week.
The present championship tournaments
will come to a close Wednesday, when
the singles will be played. Percy Mur
dock of Alameda and A. E. Bell of Los
Angeles will meet in the final this after
noon. The -winner will meet Champion
Freeman Wednesday. .

CARD AT THE STATE FAIR.
Eugene Geary's greyhound Palo Alto
showed all his old-time speed yesterday
at Union Coursing Park, winning the open
stake easily. In the deciding course he
met the St. Louis crack Lord Brazen.
The hare took the shortest route across
the field and escaped without a turn be
ing scored off him. Palo Alto was allowed
three points for speed, which gave him
the course and first money.
The favorites were uniformly successful
few long shots landing. The most nota
ble was the defeat of the 1 to 7 choice
Vina by Precita Maid. The favorite
showed the speed, but fell at a critical
part of the course.

SUMMARV.
Stolen bases â Francks " (2). Error â Reidy \
In both contests the target bearers
played the game to a fare-ye-well. They
could hit and run basts and field like
fiends, bo what chance could the Brown
lea possibly have? Tbe latter played
some good baseball and some bad ball.
For the most part they were steady, but
they were never for a minute in the
same class with Peter's Cripples in any
department of the game.
To Mr. Cooper and Mr. Graham, the
gentlemen who shoot the sphere with
their left mitts, goes the credit of both
victories. In each Instance they were
the greatest enemies of the Portland
batsmen and hold the latter safe all the
time. Then they received some swell
support, as one lonely error was made
during the progress of both games.
The afternoon struggle was a pretty
one, thpugh It was one-sided and devoid
of any sensational or* heartrending
features. The Cripples started during the
third and in a twinkling rolled up three
runs. Graham hit a' slow one to third
and O'Hara repeated the trick to short.
Francks scored Graham with a drive to
right. Moskiman went out. but Schwartz
came through with a double and the oth
er two landed.
One more was added to the list in the
fifth. Schwartz made his second double
and came straight home when Murdock
smashed a hot one past Ilolllngsworth.
The big thing was kept quiet till' the
game was all but over. Then the Crip
ples commenced to do a fe â¢ real fancy
acts with their clubs. They finished up
the day's work by hammering in live
more tallies.
As usual. Graham started the fuss by
beating out a well-placed bunt. O'Hara
laid down another i<r>6 McFarlan threw
to second, but Graham beat the throw.
Francks forced OHara at second. Mos
kiman got a pass and '.he bags were
loaded. Schwartz chased in Graham and
Francks with his third double for the
day, a hard drive over third. Murdock
followed his example and two more tal
lied. To wind up the big show Gorton
also tore loose with another and Murdock
arrived with the last and ninth one for
the Cripples.
Portland never had a chance to score.
Only two hits were made off the bewil
dering assortment handed out by Gra-.
ham. Blake, the first man up, secured
one, and In the eighth Raldy hit the other
one. The score:
record by shutting out the
Brownies twice without a run. In the
morning they had the came copped from
the call of time and won, 3 to 0. During
the engagement at Recreation Park It
came still easier and they f.nlshed ahead,
9 to 0.

Cooper in Great Form.
The morning game on the Oakland
grounds was an easy one for the Cripples
to get away with. Cooper was about Rt
his best and the Brownies never could
get near. his goods. Shields was in the
box for the Brownies after a long Illness
and the Cripples got him often, but not
often enough to have counted had not

The Coroner was notified last evening
by the officials in charge of the Waldeck
Sanitarium that Mrs. Mary A. Mills, who
died In that institution last evening, had
come to her death from septicaemia fol
lowing a criminal operation. The de
ceased had been under the care of Dr.
Alfred McLaughlln and was admitted to
the hospital on September 1. O^ng to
her precarious condition an immediate
operation was necessary and she was ac
cordingly operated upon. According to
John E. Behan, brother of the dead wom
an, she informed him that she had per
formed the first operation herself. It is un
derstood that Dr. McLaughlin has a signed
statement exonerating him from any par

PARIS, Sent. 7.â In an interview pub
lished In the Gaulols this morning, Munir
Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador, declares
the published stories of atrocities and
massacres in Macedonia to be grossly ex
aggerated. Though such acts may have
been committed by Turkish soldiers, he
says, they are mere isolated Instances
and acts of reprisal for similar deeds
committed by the Insurgents. Turkey
wants peace, he says, and has mobilized
a sufficient force to crush all opposition,
which is the best means to prevent blood
shed and secure peace. Munir Pasha does
not believe there will- be war with Bul
garia, as Prince Ferdinand desires peace.
He asserts that much of the money of the
Insurgents came from the ransom of
Miss Stone, the American missionary.

Henry Frank of the Metropolitan Inde
pendent Church, New York City, lectur
ing at Golden Gate Hall yesterday, made
an attack upon what he called "the hypo
critical cry 'of Christendom for vengeance
on the unspeakable Turk." He said that
because there recurs the occasional mas
sacre of Christians on the borders of the
Sultan's possessions the Christian pulpits
of Europe and America thunder ever and
anon with outcries of vengeance, not
hesitating, he said, to demand even the
utter annihilation of the proverbial sick
man of the Eastern Continent. Pulpiteers,
he said, are once more using all Christen
dom to undertake the task of overthrow-
Ing the power of the Porte at the risk of
an international war and the shedding of
rivers of human blood.

KANSAS CITY,* Sept. 6.â Charles Fran
cis Adams of Boston In a letter to R. T.
Snediker, a local single tax advocate,
uses very strong language to express his
opposition to, any plan of municipal own
ership or control of street railway lines.
He says the municipal system In use In
Glasgow would lead to a riot In twenty
four hours If tried in Kansas City. Says
Adams:
I can only say that, as a result of careful
official examination on my part. I have never
jet seen In Europe anywhere a case of munici
pal or public transportation worthy of an in
stant's consideration, as compared with our
own. We here in America do things In the
transportation line which in Europe they do
not even dream of, and wherever a Govern
ment lays its hands on a line It becomes,
compared with our system, paralyzed at once.
The fact Is, when It cornea to handling: pri
vate business, any and every Government Is,
in my opinion, utterly Incompetent, whether
it is a water system, schooja, rallroadn. tele
graph, postofflce or what not. Every time
private enterprise would do It four times
as well at about half the cost.

PITTSBURG,. Sept. 6.â A deputation of
Pittsburg Salvationists, under the leader
ship of Staff Captain White, will leave
Wednesday for the feud district of Ken
tucky and undertake the work of reform
ing the feudlsts. The objective point will
be Breathitt County. The party will be
made up, outside of a few of the officers
in the work in this city, of members of
the local army who volunteer to give
their time to the work, and it Is likely
that by the time the party is ready to
start next week there will be quite a
formidable array of local workers In the
party. The reception which the members
of the army will receive In the counties
to be invaded Is a matter of grave doubt
to many interested in the work, but those
who are going seem to have no fear of
the manner In which they will be treated.

"We are badly hampered for accommo
dation in the prison during the winter
months," said the- Chief, "and I antici
pate that this will be a hard winter for
the criminal element. Besides our own
we have to accommodate United States
prisoners, but I am endeavoring to have
them sent to the Alameda County Jail,
where there Is plenty of room.
"The space occupied by the cells could
have bera much more economically util
ized, giving much more accommodation
for prisoners, and I will lay the matter
before the proper authorities and see
what can be done to remedy the defect.
If the building were extended to Dunbar
alley on the Washington street side that
Â¦would do awav with the congestion for
years to come and I hope the taxpayers
will vote favorably on the proposition to
purchase the building on Washington
street to effect that much desired object."
Chief Wittman made an inspection of
the City Prison yesterday -with the object
of peeing what epace, if any, could be
utilized for more cell accommodation for
the comine winter, when there will be
the usual increase In the number of pris
oners.

ROME, Sept. 6.â Deputy Ferri, the edi
tor of. the" Socialist paper Avanti, who
was acaultted on September 2 of the
charge of libeling the navy brought
against him by thirty-five naval officers,
the acquittal being on the ground that
the latter could not represent the whole
navy, has filed an interpellation to be
made on the rcopenlnsr of the chamber,
insisting again on a Parliamentary in
quiry into the condition of the navy from
the time of the battle of Llssa"ln*1566rin
which the Italians were defeated by the
Austrians, until the present time. It was
on the occasion of a previous attempt to
obtain a Parliamentary inquiry that Sig
nor Ferri made his attacks on the navy
which led to the suit for libel being
brought against him. It is believed, how
ever, that before the reopening of the
Chamber Premier Zanardelll will appoint
a committee of naval investigation, as he
promised when the proposition for an in
quiry was previously rejected by the
Chambers.

COLOSSAL WASTE
In the new agreement the Russian Min
ister demanded further grants of land to
the timber company In return for can
celing the Jurisdiction clause as a favor
to Korea to avoid getting her into trouble
with other powers.
According' to a later report the stipula
tion in the agreement about foreigners
charged with any offense in the leased
area having to be handed over to Russian
custody has been canceled on account of
the objections made by the Korean For
eign Office^ acting on protests sent in by
the powers. This portion being canceled,
the Russian Minister drafted an amended
agreement which he pressed the Korean
Government to sign. The Foreign ufnee
refused, but the'lmperial Household De
partment ordered that the agreement be
signed.
Telegrams from Korea state that Cho
Sekio, head of the Forestry Department
of Korea, has sent a note to the Japanese
Minister. Hayaisha, -stating that the
Russo-Korean agreement for lease of land
at Yongampho to the timber company has
been canceled as the result of fresh ne
gotiations with the representative of the
timber company. Baron Gunsberg. The
Korean officials have also stated through
the Foreign Office at Seoul that the
agreement was only provisional. Minis

note.

The Peking correspondent of the Jiji

Manchuria the United States Minister,
Mr. Conger, has made a strong argument,
to which Prince Ching has replied stating
that if China assents to the opening at
thia time Russia will make that action, a
pretext to continue the occupation 'of
Manchuria after October 10, the date stip
ulated in the treaty for the final evacua
tion. The correspondent adds that the

similar answer to Prince Chlng.

TWO CABLES CUT.
Several Hundred Wires Are Rendered
Useless by Miscreants.
OAKLAND, Sept. 6.â Two large tele
phone cables, carrying from 100 to 200
wires each, were cut last night in this
city. According to the telephone com
pany officials the work was done by somo
one familiar with the location of the
wires, as well as the methods by which
they could be put out of service. The
first cut was made at the pole at tho
corner of Thirty-fourth street and San
Pablo avenue, where a cable carrying 100
wires was severed and the connecting
telephones in that portion of the city put
out of service. The second cut was mads
in a larger strand of wires running across
Webster-street bridge and carrying sev
eral hundred connections between Oak
land and Alameda. Th* cut here as in
tbe San Pablo avenue case showed plain
ly that experienced hands had located
the cable and rendered it useless.
The telephone company early located the
interruption in the service and put skilled
electricians at work to make repairs. Ef
forts to uncover the identity of the wira
cutters have to date been unavailing.
Most all of the cutting has been done late
at night and at points and hours where
and when detection would be difficult.

LOS ANGELES. Sept. 6.â Within plain
sight of thousands of spectators, a man
and a woman made a balloon ascension of
3000 feet or more this afternoon. The wo
man cut loose her parachute and descend
ed safely, but the man found it impossi
ble to loosen his parachute, and with the
"dead" balloon, in which the hot air had
become chilled, ho plunged earthward,
every second seeming to be his last, but
saved only by the partial working of his
umbrella-like contrivance. He landed
squarely upon a network of telephone
wires and lives to. tell about it. .
The double balloon ascension, was made
by Edna Springer and Farrari Sandusky
from Chutes Park and was the most
thrilling midair event that ever occurred
in Los Angeles. The two performers went
up together, the girl clinging to a trapeze
hung just below her companion's, and
when at an altitude approximated to have
been 3000 feet the girl cut loose according
to programme and began "a successful de
scent in her parachute.
Her companion was to have followed
fuit immediately, but no sooner had the
first parachute begun Its voyage than the
balloon listed heavily to one side and be
gan to rake the remaining aeronaut to
and fro through the air. The girl scream
ed to him to cut loose, but his efforts to
free himself proved vain and with its vi
tality fast ebbing away the balloon start
ed toward the earth, threatening every
moment to overwhelm and smother its
unwilling passenger in its noxious folds.
Finding that he could not cut the para
chute loose, Sandusky suspended himself
from the trapeze by his hands, so as to
land as much in advance^ of the bag as
possible, that he might make an attempt
to escape being enfolded by it as soon
rs his feet touched something firm, and
down they came, the useless parachute
opening and enutting ominously.
This saved his life. But for It he would
have been dashed to death. Sandusky's
feet struck in a network of telephone
wires at Main and Fourteenth street.
Throwing himself to one side as he re
bounded from his dangerous landing place
the aeronaut just mlsped being caught by
the heavy folds of the balloon, which
swept across onto tho roof of the house,
tending itself open. The man made his
way over the wires â luc .y telephone
wires, not being sufficiently charged, with
electricity to injure himâ and climbed
down the pole, bruised but whole.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, Sept. 7.â The Times corre
spondent at Peking telegraphs:
"Although they may be officially con
tradicted, the following particulars of the
Russo-Japanese negotiations are reported
In too circumstantial and persistent a
form to be disregarded. In a memoran
dum which the Japanese Minister pre
sented to Count Lamsdorf, the Russian
Foreign Minister, provision was made for
tho mutual recognition of the respective
railway rights of the two powers in Man
churia and Korea, each power to define
its rights and have authority to guard its
railways and send 'troops for ,. the sup
pression of disturbances within its sphere.
In this connections should be noted that
Japan has very extended preferential
rights for railway construction in Korea/'
The Times correspondent at Tokio says
the report that the basis 'of the Russo-
Japanese negotiations Is the mutual
recognition of the interests of the two
countries In Manchuria and Korea Is of
ficially denied there.
The holy father desires to become master of
the wholo mechanism of tho Vatican before ap
pointing a Secretary of State. Meanwhile all
officials employed by Pope Leo XIII have been
retained, as none better than they could help
the new . Pontiff . In carrying out his purpose.
The new Secretary of State will gradually re
place them. But their removal will not be a
punishment.- On the contrary they will be re
warded for their sen-ices by promotion. The
new Secretary of State" will choose men entire
ly trusted by him and who will be capable of
collaborating with him 'In the new direction of
the Vatican" s policy. The new Secretary, how
ever, is almost sure to be an Italian, as that
has been the tradition for centuries. Cardinal
Moran, notwithstanding his ability, his liberal
turn of mind and his exact acquaintance with
modern problems, has no more chance than any
other foreigner. This Is why Monalgnor Merry
del Val, who has often been spoken of for thÂ«
position. Is- unlikely to be chosen,' he being a
Spaniard. Besides, his appointment, even if
made after being appointed a Cardinal, might
be considered as an offense. to the Sacred Col
lege, as it would imply that among its present
members there is none worthy to occupy "the
position.

ROME, Sept. 6.â With reference to the

"When Policeman Shannon entered the
restaurant in response to a call he was
accompanied by Herbert Root. Frank
Periera, Joseph Rosseau, Henry Fagin
and J. Hotchklss, an engineer. These
citizens assisted the patrolman In guard
ing the place until Maruse had been taken
into custody. He did not try to escape,
but was pointed out by Japanese in the
restaurant. The police_ also took posses
sion of two long kitchen knives that were
found near the dead man's body. Dr.
J. T. Kltchlngs examined the stabbed
waiter shortly after he was cut, but
could do nothing for the wounded man.
The body was removed to the Morgue
by Deputy Coroner Henry Quellen. The
date of the inquest has not been set. The
dead waiter was 26 years of age.
Detectives were detailed to investigate
and reported that tho cook had been
drinking for several days, was ugly and
Ill-natured and had been running things
at the restaurant with a high hand. The
other cooks and waiters about the place
said they werfe afraid to cross Maruse
because they realized that he was in a
bad humor and was ready for a quarrel
upon the slightest provocation.
Maruse, according to the Japanese at
the restaurant, had been in company with
a countryman, Katow from Benlcia, on
a drinking bout and the pair had imbibed
heavily of liquor, which had Inflamed the
cook.
For an hour this morning the drunken
cook and the waiter had been bandying
words over Katow and had been argu
ing Japanese politics. Incidentally the
prospects of war in the Orient were gone
over. In the heat of the discussion the
pair came to blows. One of the waiters
told the police that he saw the dead
waiter strike the cook with a plate. Oth
ers said the man only used his fist. At
any rate the men soon afterward went
into the yard, where the stabbing oc
curred.
During a quarrel shortly after noon to
day Isoichi Maruse, chief cook in a Jap
anese restaurant at 478 Eighth street,
Etabbcd Kasaburo Hiramatsu, a waiter,
to death with a large kitchen knife. The
scene of the killing was in the back yard
of the restaurant. There was one witness
to the murder, Katow, a friend of the
cook. His ecream was heard and work
men in the eating-house rushed out only
to find the waiter on the ground with a
knife thrust In his right side and dying.
Physicians were called, but the wound
ended the man's life in a few minutes.
The cook wu arrested by Policeman

The news spread among the immense
crowd of pleasure eeekcrs. and in an in
credibly short space of time several thou
sand persons, actuated by a morbid curi
osity, had gathered at the scene. This
number was augmented by manv more
upon the TafTlval o f the Morgue "wagon.
Deputy Fennel and Messenger Frank
Murphy took charge of the body and con
veyed it to the Morgue.
An examination of the dead man's
rockets brought to li^rht two pieces of
Ftout hempen rope tied in a noose, which
indicates that he contemplated self-de
struction by hanging in the event the
deadly acid did not have effect. A stor
age receipt issued by the Southern Pacific
i-'ompany for two days' storage, bearing
the number 1S2.&22. signed "C. W. Luce,

PARIS, Sept. 6.â Henry Vlgnaud, First
Secretary of the United States Embassy,
has joined Issue with tbe German savant,
Dr. Sophus Huge of Dresden, who criti
cized Mr. Vlgnaud's theories regarding
Toscanelll's part in- the discovery of
America. Mr. Vlgnaud's pamphlet han
dles Dr.' Ruge severely, pointing out errors
in fact and judgment and charging him
with entering into the controversy quite
unprepared. The character of the paper
places Professor Rugre on the defensive.

Tug Banger Saila.
The tug Ranger, after undergoing extensive
repairs, sailed for Eureka yesterday.
Steamer Tows Bark.
The British bark Annasona left port yester
day in tow of the steam schooner Arctic, bound
for Eureka, where she will take on a cargo of
lumber. , i Â¦
The steamship James Dollar, which arrived
yesterday from Seattle, reports that the chief,
cook. O. Ofrmnn, died at sea on September C.
Ha was a native of Sweden. S3 years of age.
The supposed cause of his death was heart dis
ease.
Cook Dies at Sea.
Quite an unusual sight was seen ; Sunday
along the. docks. Sunday is a day when prac
tically all business is suspended along the wa
ter front, but as to-day is Labor day many of
the ships in port which are discharging cargoes
were compelled to utilize Sunday and kept ifio
full complement of stevedores at work from
early morn until late at night.
Sabbath Quiet Broken.
Philip Jean; a sailor on the French bark
Margaret Mollnos. while trying to walk from
Be&le-street wharf to the deck of his ship yes
terday, missed his footing' and fell to the wharf.
He landed on his head and cut an ugly gash
over his left eye. He was conveyed in a etate
of stupor to the Harbor Emergency Hospital,
where he revived somewhat while- Dr. W. E.
Stevens sewed up the triangular cut on hie
head.
Sailor Suffers Fall.
Cable advices, from. Honolulu yesterday
announce that -the British \ bark , Juteopo
lis had putintb that port' for a supply of
provisions. 'â¢â¢ " \ Â¦' %;r* :
The JuteoDOlis galled from Hollo 129
days ago, bound for Delaware Break
water. The bark was 'well manned arid
supplied with stores sufficient to meet the
demands of the ' time required for the
regular voyage.
Just as she was approaching the Caro
line Islands a succession of calms set In,
and for more than, two months she was
practically becalmed and simply drifted
about at the mercv of the waves.
Little by little the store of provisions
commenced to give out, so the captain de
cided to make a. run for Honolulu, where
he obtained a fresh- supply.
The experience of the Juteopolis may
perhaps in a measure account for the
long trip the American ship Helen Brewer
Is making. The Brewer is now out 184
days from Sourabaya and is also bound
for Delaware Brakewater. Saturday she
was being reinsured at 90 per cent. ..The
arrival of the Juteopolis at Honolulu
strengthens the belief that the Brewer
may still be afloat
Prospects of the Safety of
. Helen' Brewer Are En
\ :>. 'couraging.

New Pope's Sister Prophesies Evil
for His Holiness.^=^=^ -j
"Oh, what a misfortune! My. poor Beppo, who so loved a comfort- :
: able chat! Who knows what misery, he will go through in that prison â¢
: there in Rome?" â¢ , _ .[\
\ These were the words, said with tears and real grief, with which i
â¢ Maria, sister of Pius X. received the news that he had been, made Pope, â¢
â¢ and they epitomize the feeline of the family about this elevation of their \
: "Beppo" to one of the most powerful positions on earth. * â¢
I Of course it is not an unusual circumstance, that in all times and \
\ all ages evil prophecies of dire disaster to come have been heaped ;
i upon the heads of those who have -won greatness, but in this instance \
the above incident, with' much more that has followed since then, has :
electrified and well nieh appalled many of those who are in a position- :
to know the condition of affairs at the Vatican. . â¢
Indeed, it. is extraordinary when "one's own family prophesy evil j
where only good can be. but yet, strange as it may seem, not only the \
sister of the new PopeY but Â¦ her brother and many of the other mem- \
bers of the family besides have given utterance to words that have :
added vastly to the mystery of the misery and growing unhappiness that i
Ms said to be settling heavily upon His Holiness. Strangest of all, they i
speak authoritatively, without malice, but in deepest compassion, and i
their words are being given credence far and wide, more particularly as ;
Pius X has been adding equally strange confirmation. â¢
He speaks continuously of the many things in his . life that he had :
treasured that are now gone from him forever, and in this way the â¢
boyhood, the early, manhood, the later ambition, the inner life of His â¢
Holiness is brought forth more dramatically than it could be in any â¢
other way. That is how Mr. I. Cochrane has been able to write the '<
remarkable article for the next Sunday Call, which, with the pictures i
from Rome, occupies, a full page. It is the most valuable article about i
the new Pope that has yet been secured anywhere. :
Indeed, it is just such features as the above that has given Journal- ''<
istic. excellence to the Sunday Call's Magazine Section, which is already :
far in the lead in a literary way. It is no idle boast, or boast at all, '
to say; that no other, paper in America can offer so much of eenuine i
merit and fascinating interest. <
For itistance; next Sunday you will get the fourth and last install- :
ment of '"Brewster's Millions," one : of the most powerful American ] >
novels of the day,: a 'complete short story, "The Little God and Dickey" :
by> Josephine Dodge the most famous woman writer in Ameri- â¢

There will be two distinct parades in

unions affiliated with the Building Trades
Council will start from Lombard street
and Van Ness avenue, the line of march
being on Van Ness avenue to Market
street, thence down Market to the ferry,
where they will embark for Shell Mound
Park, where they irfU join in celebrating
Labor day with kindred organizations
from Oakland.
The parade of the other unions will
start from East and Market streets.
thence on Market street to Van Ness ave
nue, to JEddy street, countermarching to
Eighth and Market streets, where the
procession will disband. It is the inten
tion to make the line of march as short

dresses of their leaders.

Tien of San. Francisco will turn

dition to attend the exercises at the

This afternoon at 3 o'clock the first : of
the" popular concerts will be given at
the Mechanics' Pavilion under the direc
tion of Fritz Scheel. These are a series
inaugurated by the San Francisco Sym
phony Society for the benefit of the pub
lic. That a large crowd . will attend is
already an assured fact, since the ; sale of
seats is unusually great. There is no
other leader in the United States that
knows so thoroughly how to please the
general public as Scheel, and for, this rea
son, his concerts are invariably well at
tended. The programme for this: after
noon Is., an exceedingly, interesting one
and at the same time melodious. To-day
the seats will be on sale at the pavilion.
There will be a second concert at the pa
vilion on "Wednesday afternoon and to
morrow afternoon another regular Tues

The Delineator for October.
William Mode Cook, a capitalist of
New York, who is president of the com
pany which is building the largest hotel
in the world at St. Louis, arrived from
Donvor yesterday with his family and is
registered at the Palace Hotel. The big
hotel he represents is to cover fourteen
acres of land and will have a frontage
of 2503 feet, or nearly half a mile. The
hotel will be two stories high, eitept the
front portion, which, for appearance
Bake, will have three stories, and wiil
contain 1200 rooms.
Discussing the plans for the immense
structure last evening Mr. Cook said that
his company is confident that it KSs one
of the most promising- enterprises at the
coming exposition. Oor.Unuing, he said:
"It has been the experience of visitors
to all expositions that hotel accommoda
tions are most difficult to get and it was
this fact, together with the indications
that St. Louis is to draw an unsually
larpr crowd to her exposition, that re
sulted in our company t conceiving the
idoji of building: on an exceptionally large
Kale. Of the 4200 rooms the Iiotcl will
contain 1300 will be conducted on the
European plan and the remainder on
Tho American plan. The plans had hardly
be< n made public befo're we began to re
ceive letters of inquiry from various parts
of the country, which aug-urs well for a
largr- attendance at the fair."
<"ook is making: a tour of the coast pre
paratory to returning to St. Louis and
Ffttiins: down to the business of his big
onurprises. From here ho goes north to
Portland and from there he will return
to the Kast by way of Spokane and the
Yellowstone Park.
Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall's lecture at Stein

ence last night. The doctor gave a dem

The Pollard Lilliputian Opera Company
opened the second week of Its engage
ment at the Grand Opera-house last
night in "A Gaiety Girl." The production
is a new one to San Francisco audiences
and contains many novel features. The
little ones displayed much grace and car
ried themselves with an air of assurance
beyond their years. The scenic effects
were of an. elaborate scale and the cos
tumes elegant. Little Daphne Pollard in
the role of Lady Virginia Forrest won
friends immediately by her quaint man
ners and graceful carriage. She inter
preted the role in an exceedingly clever
manner and surprised the entire house
by the way shey handled her lines. Master
Teddy McNamara, a wee lad, appeared
as the knockabout comedian in the piece,
and the way he went through his various
stunts was comical in the extreme. Then
he sang a song that brought down the
house. Master Jack Pollard, who plays
the part of the clergyman, is possessed
of great talent, and he fully demonstrated
last night that he is a born comedian.
He was the center of attraction during
the greater part of the production and
was fully equal to the occasion- in every
instance. The chorus and ballet are espe
cially good, and they sing some catchy
songs. One of the features of "The
Gaiety Girl" is the dancing.
The "standing room only" sign was dis
played long before the curtain went up
at the Orpheum Jast evening. Those who
were turned away missed a good show,
and those who secured admission were
fortunate. Four new numbers of the star
order have been secured by Manager
Morrisey, and the holdover acts were all
the cream of last week's performance.
Frederic Bond and company open in a
laughable farce, "My Awful Dad." Bond
sustains the character of Adonis Ever
green, a giddy father; Arthur Buchanan
takes the part of Richard, his son, and
Miss Georgie Benton plays Matilda Wed
digan, a dashing young widow. Mrs.
Biggs is ably sustained by Ethel Tassin.
It is one laugh from start to finish. Al
mont and Uuraont, on the bills as the
world's greatest instrumental hussars, do
themselves proud, and there seems to be
scarcely an Instrument they cannot mas
ter. During the act they introduce sev
eral horns which are new to this city.
Fisher and "Wacker appear as comic
Tyrolean duetists. It is their first Ameri
can appearance, and they certainly "make
good." There is just sufficient blend of
comedy in, the turn, which, with the ex
cellent voices, brings encores at the con
clusion of each song. The original Rio
brothers are wonders as athletic enter
tainers. They do work that has never
been seen here before, and the strong-arm
exhibition is marvelous. They held the
'audience until the conclusion of the show,
which is something out of the ordinary.
The L.a Vine-Cameron trio continue in
their laughable absurdity, "My Demented
Friend." These popular people receive a
warm second-week welcome, and their
acrobatic and dancing turn is hard to ex
cel. Marguerite and Hanley open the
show as sensational acrobats, and George
Schindler follows as the world's greatest
harmonica player. Lew Bloom and Jane
Cooper appear again in "A Picture From
Life," and T. Nelson Downs still mysti
fies as the "king of coins." .
The gypsy role of Esmeralda suits Mis3
Kemble better than anything she has
done this season. Picturesquely, she fills
the role admirably. Frank McVicars es
says the Quasimodo, and in a sufficiently
fantastic get-up docs earnest and effective
work in the part. He makes a distinct
score by the nonchalant fashion in which
he carries Miss Kemble up Notre Dame's
steps. (And she is not of the lean kine
of Pharaoh, either!) Charles Wyngate is
the archer, Phoebus de Chateaupers, and
brings a dashing exterior and some con
viction to the part. Thomas Oberle Is
the priest, Claude Frollo, who bobs up
unserenely just when he shouldn't. Mr.
Oberle looks that way and seemed com
fortable in the role. Adora Andrews, who
was the Fleur de Lys, was acceptable,
and the rest of the large cast filled in
more or less advantageously.
The house was large, irreverent and en
thusiastic. Next Sunday evening the reg
ular season begins with "A Friend of the
Family," with George W. Barnum and
Alice Johnston.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
For the.last week of their local engage
ment the Neill-Morosco . Company pro
duced last night for the nrst time here
Paul Potter's dramatization of "Notre
Dame." Five acts of it there are, not
more trustful than much of the current
romantic melodramaâ nor less. Yet Mr.
Potter has succeeded in presenting the
story with clearness, in accenting pretty
justly its salient features and in massing
them attractively. While the device ob
vious is rampant, the play is not dull and
has a scene or two of considerable
strength. Very good comedy is the scene
where Gringoire finds himself among the
thieves, and would be better were the
poet role played otherwise than buffoon
fashion, in which its exponent conceived
and acted the part laBt night. Go to thy
Sothern, thou Sumr.er, and be wise! The
scene of the attempted murder of Captain
Phoebus is also well managed, though
gaining no particular strength from its
acting, and the lines are" unusually ef
fective. From the scenic side the pro
duction is entitled to considerable praise,
also the stage management, with special
eye to the clever handling of the mob in
the Court of Miracles. .
