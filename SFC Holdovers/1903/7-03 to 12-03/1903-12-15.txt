BAKERSFIEL.D. Dec. 14.â A serious
clash has occurred at Sunset between
the forces of the Consolidated Califor

Fe -Railroad Company.; over the rights
of way of the two corporations. - It is
reported to-night that armed men are
guarding the oil company's domain and
holding in. check the employes of the
railroad.
Persons who arrived here to-day, re
port that the oil company, hired a num
ber .'of teams and drivers, . paying:, it
is said. $5 a day. in order to get men
at once, and . tore up the railroad's
grading Across . a . tract of â¢ forty acres
north of the Alameda property. After
doing this a vacant house was moved
on to the right c-f way and guards were
placed In it to keep the railroad -com
pany's laborers from working.
.From\what can be learned, the Im
mediate cause of the trouble was that
the Consolidated Oil Felds Company de
mands a right of .way for its pipe line
across the same property and -is will
ing, to allcrw the Santa Feto cross the
land, which belongs to one of. its affil
iated companies, only on condition that
it is given certain privileges in this re

The trouble is said to have been
brewing for some time past; - in fact,
ever, since the Santa Fe commenced
builtiing its extension, which comes into
direct competition with . the pipe line
which is being constructed by the.Con

NEW YORK, bee. 14.â The manage
ment of the Majestic Theater an
nounced to-night that it would dis-i
charge its men usher3 and put women
in 'their places. This decision was
reached to-day after Manager Flaherty
had a final talk with a good looking
woman, who says she is Miriam Foster.
Miss Foster appeared at the theater
a 'few days ago and demanded a Job,
but was told there was none vacant in
the business department, to which she
wished to be assigned. She would not
entertain the' suggestion of going be
hind the' footlights,, saying:
"None of that for me. I know some
thing about that end of the theatrical â¢
business, for I have had a try at it.
What I want Is to break into the busi
ness - end. of it. There's where the
money is, to be had."
Manager Flaherty told her there was
not a single place vacant. She ap
peared at the theater, to-day. When
told ; there ' was no vacancy she .; ' sug
gested that women ushers be appoint
ed. .When ; the; press agent was invited
in to- talk" this :over he seized upon; the
woman usher idea like a hungry "man.
' Miss Foster; said she was willing to
be an usher and Flaherty commissioned
her â¢ to go Â¦ and find others. To-night
she reported she had found, seven jother

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLON, Dec. 14.â A company of ma
rines from the United States cruiser
Prairie was Janded here to-day, under
the command of Captain S. D. Butler,
and immediately started by train for
Panama. The destination of the ma
rines is Baid to have been Yaviza, up
the San Miguel Gulf and Tucari River.
It Is believed that the decision of the
naval authorities to station marines
at Yevlra may be owing to the reports
that Colombian troops have been seen
In that direction, but up to the pres
ent time there is no reason to believe
that any large force is under orders
to march on Panama from Cauca. The
opinion seems to prevail that the few
Colombian soldiers seen were probably
scouts who were endeavoring to learn
what preventive and protective meas
ures were being taken by the re
public of Panama, and that it was their
presence which gave rise to the cx
affgera.tr<d rumors of a speedy attack
by Colombia upon the isthmus.
It is more likely that the movement
of marines to Yaviza is in conformity
with the, policy of the naval author
ities to concentrate forces at points
which offer the best facilities for get
ting immediate information of a move
ment of Colombian troops toward Pan
ama and at the same time affording
the marines some relief from their con
finement to the ships. The. marines
carried with them aU requisites for
camp life and also a number of ma
chine ' suns.

NEW YORK. Dec. 14. â In a ser
mon on the life of the late Herbert
Spencer, the Rev. Dr. Mlnot J. Savage,
in the Unitarian Church of the Mes
siah, has given the theory of evolu
tion credit for having "forever de
stroyed intelligent belief on the part
of anybody in the Garden of Eden,
Adam and Eve or the fall of man.
Evolution," ho asserted, "has forever
removed those stories, and kindred
ones, to the land of myth, where they
belong.". |
In concluding his remarks, Dr. Sav
age said:
. "Humanity has been on this earth
two or three hundred thousand years
at least. Humanity, however, slowly,
has been evolving, claiming from the
far-off beginning there never has been
any fall. Evolution has wrought out
not the fall of man, but the ascent of
man. That means the complete re
construction of the entire theology of
Christendom. It is coming, it has got
to come. There are thousands of
churches Jo-day In which the Eden
story is quietly referred to as though,
it were poetry or allegory. There are
thousands of others where it Is quietly
laid to one side."

The terms of Russia's reply to

After a careful examination of the
Russian draft of 'the agreement the
Foreign Office here. is inclined to the
belief that Its immediate acceptance,
by Japan is unlikely, and looks for a
series of Russo-Japanese; pourparlers

regards the -draft as a distinct step

":p-day paid his first visit to the State
Department since his presentation to
the President
The general staff, in mapping out a
plan for possible war with Colombia,
has determined to follow a pro
gramme, which, it is hoped, will make
the confiict as Ehort as possible. To
do this it will be necessary, it is said,
to invade Colombia and pursue the
enemy to his own territory.
Information has been called for by
the general staff showing that the
ports of Barranquilla and Buenaven
tura are being considered as possible
landing places for American troops
and that the objective point of two
military forces landing at those places
will be Bogota. By forcing the fight
ing in Colombia, it is believed, the Co
lombian troops v.ill be diverted from
the isthmus.
Military authorities are paying no
attention to the pacific assurances of
General Reyes and the Colombian au
thorities and are considering the pres
ent situation as if hostilities with Co
lombia were Imminent. According to
Secretary Koot, it is the duty of the
general staff to prepare plans for any
possibte -emergency.
There was a long conference to-day
between Lieutenant General Young,
chief of staff, and General J. Frank
lin Bell, who has been tentatively
elected to command the United States
expedition to Colombia in case war
develops between the two countries.
This conference is officially explained
as relating to matters connected with
the general service ' school at Fort
Leavenworth. There is trustworthy
information, however, that Generals
Young and Bell talked about the pro
posed military expedition to the Isth
mus of Panama.

Beall (D.) of Texas said that while
the Democrats wanted a canal they
wanted it in an honorable way. He
asserted that it was known to the rep

cur,' and It also was known in Wash
ington.
Adams, explaining the dispatch to
Consul Ehrman sent by Secretary Hay
and auoted by Beall. in which Infor
mation was asked concerning a "re
ported uprising," said the Secretary
had sent the message in view of the
information contained in an Associated
Press dispatch.
Baker (D.) of New York, speaking
on the subject of labor, contended that
compensating wages were not given.
He cited the testimony as to wages
taken before the Anthracite Coal Com
mission, and said It showed "conditions
of slavery." He said the United States
Steel Company sold stock to Its em
ployes at a figure thirty points higher
than present quotations. In New York,
he said, the trusts squeezed the labor
ing man until he was willing to work
at low wages. He referred to the ship
building trust, connecting it with the
steel trust.^and declared that the stock
of both concerns was watered.
ADAMS REPLIES TO BEALL.
The House then went into commit
tee of the whole, with Lawrence of
Massachusetts in the chair, for the fur
ther consideration of the pensions ap
propriation bill. Adams (R.) of Penn

interests, asserting the need of legisla

there was a general discussion on va

He declared ' that the President, by
the course followed in this treaty, had
performed an insolent usurpation of
the privileges of the House. The pro
ceeding, he declared, amounted to
moral and political coercion and It was
a matter of no little wonder that the
House did not substitute for the pres-.
ent measure the bill whlcn it passed
under independent action less than two
years ago. Why did the House forego
its independent judgment of less than

opposed the bill as a matter of general

Barclay J. Smith, the well, known
merchant and founder of Smith's Cash
Store on Market street, near Steuart,
died yesterday morning at his home,
570 Harrison street. Death came after
a Ions illness, the last five weeks of
which the dead merchant passed at nis
home, being unable to leave the house.
Smith was born in Pennsylvania and
was 70 years' of age.- More than twen
ty-five years ago he came to California
and started a retail house under the
name of Smith's Cash Store at 519 Post
street. Through his â¢ business ability
the trade of the little store grew to
such a prosperous state in a few years
"First â It placed the control of the
two roads in the hands of a single per
son, to wit, the Securities Company, by
virtue of its ownership of a large ma
jority of the stock of both companies.
"Second â It destroyed every motive
for competition between two roads en
gaged in interstate traffic, which were
natural competitors for business, by
pooling the earnings of the two roads
for the common benefit of the stock
holders of both companies; and, accord
ing to the familiar rule that every one
is presumed to intend what is the nec
essary consequence of his own acts,
wtien done willfully and deliberately,
we must conclude that those who con
ceived and executed the plan aforesaid
intended, among other things, to ac
complish those objects."
The Attorney General's own summary
of the results is as follows:
"To sum up the result of the afore
mentioned exchanges of Great North
ern and Northern Pacific stock for the
stock of the Securities, the latter com
pany on December 11, 1901, had ac
quired and paid for 990,000 shares" (in
round figures) of the Great Northern
stock, the . total capital stock of that
company consisting of 1,250,000 shares,
of which 1,220,000 had been issued, and
by January 1, 1S02, the Securities. Com
pany had acquired virtually all of the
common stock of the Northern Pacific
(the preferred stock was retired on that
date, the resolution to retire It having
been passed In the preceding Novem
oer), its answer to the bill admitting
that it held 1,500,000 Northern Pacific
shares out of a total of 1,550,000.
"The final result of the transactions
was that one and the same set of -men,
Hill and Morgan and their associates
being the ruling spirits among them,
acting together under a charter agree
ment and through the agency of a
corporate organization, became invest
ed with* absolute power of control over
two parallel and competing systems of
interstate railway. In place of the
two distinct sets of stockholders with
rival and competing interests, namely,
the stockholders of the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific, ' there has ' been
substituted by means of the inter
change of stocks described, the one set
of stockholders, with one common and
non-competitive interest, namely, the
stockholders of the Securities Company.
Thus, identically the same persons who
controlled the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific before the Securities
Company came Into possession of a
majority 'of their shares, control them
now, only now these persons have a
common Interestâ "community of inter
est"âin the earnings of both roads,
while formerly the interests of '"two
sets of personsâ the two sets of stock-
"At the present time the Securities
Company is the owner of about 9* # per
cent of all the stock of the Northern
Pacific Company and the owner of
about TO per cent of all the stock of the
Great Northern Company. The scheme
which was thus devised and consum
mated led inevitably to the following
results:
After stating that the bill in the case
was originally brought by the Govern
ment to restrain the violation of the
anti-trust law by the Securities Com
pany in the consolidation of the North
ern Pacific and the Great Northern
railroads, and that the decision of the
court below was favorable to the con
tentions of the United States, the brief
enters into the following specifications
as to the reasons for the action:
1. The lines of railway operated by
the defendants, the Great Northern
Railway Company and the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, are parallel
and competing.
2. That the combination is in re
straint of interstate commerce and
a monopoly.
Th'-* concluding' paragraph of Judge
Thayer's opinion in the Circuit Court
is quoted as summing up the argument
bearing upon the facts of the case, as
follows:
Brief Prepared by Attorney General
Knox Filed With Court.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â The brief
of the Government in the case of the
Northern Securities Company and oth
ers vs. the United States, on appeal
from the decision of the Circuit Court
of the United States for the district of
Minnesota* was filed in the United
States Supreme Court to-day. The
document was prepared by Attorney
General Knox and Assistant Attorney
General Day, and covers 180 printed
pages.
CASE OF THE GOVERNMENT.
Italian Xewspaper Says 3Iother
of the King IJas Contract
ed a 3Iorganatic 3Iarriage.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â The Su
preme Court to-day began hearing ar
guments in the case of the .Northern
Securities Company, James J. : Hill, J.
Pierpont Morgan, Daniel S. Laniont and
others vs. the United States, coming
to this court on appeal from the de
cision of the Circuit Court for the Dis
trict of Minnesota. That dec.sion was
to the effect that the purchase of the
greater share of the stock of the two
railroad companies constitu;od a mer
ger and was contrary to thi Sherman
anti-trust law. The case involves the
community-of-intorest principle.
The courtroom was crowdt-d. Attor
ney General Knox was .present with
quite an array of assistants from his
office, while the opposition also was
represented by. a long list i<Â£ distin
guished counsel, including former At
torney General Griggs, John G. John
son of Philadelphia, C W. Bunn and
Charles B. Young!
JOHXSOX OPENS ARGUMENT .
John G. Johnson, representing .the
Northern Securities Company, made the
first argument. After statin*? the ease
Johnson said that the purpose of the
securities company- in acquiring the
stock of th? railroad company had been
not to prevent competition, but to pre
vent injury of its own: property. He
took sharp exception to the decision of
the Circuit Court that the possession of
the power which the securities company
had was a violation of the Ia-.v and con
tended that such holding was not in ac
cordance with decisions of the Supreme
Court, which were uniformly to the
effect that it was the us? of power and
not the possession of it that constituted
the offense. Johnson made his argu
ment on six propositions, which he out-
Ured as follows:
Firstâ That there was no agreement,
contract, combination or conspiracy to
restrain competition between these two
railway companies or to restrain trade.
Secondâ That if two railway com
panieÂ«, somewhat in competition with
themselves, decide it necessary, in or
der to sustain their competition against
a third company, which otherwise could
destroy them or greatly interfere with
their usefulness to the public, to com
bine in any way for the purpose of pro
tecting themselves against destruction,
the court must look to the matter as
one ot fact to determine whether the
real nurpose was to destroy or to lead
to the destruction in order to promote
trartr by the establishment' of the
greater competition.
Thirdâ That it the holding by the
Northern Securities Company of a ma
jority of the shares of the two com
panies was a violation of thÂ«: Sherman
act. Â«'f course an agreement among any
number of persons would be a viola
tion of that act.
Fourthâ That the first section of the
Sherman act dots not In any way con
demn as illegal the acquisition or own
ership of the shares of the two com
peting companies. ,
Filthâ That the second section of the
Sherman act does not in any way con
demn the acquisition and holding of
sub-mvnership of shares.
Sixth â That if the Sherman act do<Â»Â«
condemn as illegal the ownership of a
controlling interest in the shares of
the competing railway companies it is
unconstitutional.
SPEAKS FOIt NORTHERN PACIFIC.
Johnson was followed by C W. Bunn,
who spoke especially for the Northern
Pacific. Ss'd he:
"The parallel telegraph lines of the
country stand on the same footing as
parallel railway line?, and it is com
mon knowledge that nearly all the
telegraph lines of the country have
gradually come into control of two
companies. In the same waj* you
have got to hold that the acquisition
of parallel steamboat lines is a re
straint on interstate commerce. And
bo, if a few individuals owning stock
in i-arrying corporations should unite
into partnership, turning the stock in
as partnership assets, you would have
the same unity of ownership and the
same conspiracj* and agreement and
likewise the same power of control
that you have in this case, and my
question is whether it is really a.sub
ject of Federal control or a subject of
State control." .
KNOX STATES HIS CASK.
Bunn was followed by Attorney
General Knox for the United States.
In beginning Knox outlined the atti
tude of the Government toward the
case, saying that it was "one of grave
concern, baBed upon its conviction
that a mischievous evasion of the law
had been attempted, as well. as upon
Its epeclal interest and j relations to
one of the properties affected.'.' In or
der that the court .might understand
the reasons for this concern, he re-;
viewed the princjpaL facts connected
Â¦with the 'organization arid subsequent
history of the Northern pacific Com
pany, its relations to the Great North
ern Railroad and other facts out of
which the questions in this case arise,
but without extended comment. His
statement of facts in this connection
was as follows:
"First â That the Northern . Pacific
Railroad was built under the author
ity of the United States, and, in the
main, with capital furnished by the
United States, and that the United
States intended, and attached the con
dition to its contribution, that, the
railroad should be a great, independ
ent national highway, and specified
that the object of its construction was
'to promote the public Interest.'
. "Second â That by different devices
employed during the past ten years,
the defendants, or some of them, have
endeavored to destroy the Independence
of the Northern Pacific Company and
bring it under the domination of the
Great Northern Company. Â¦ {
'Third â That the Northern Securi
ties Company is an instrumentality de
vised by defendants to acquire, hold
*ind exercise control over these parallel
and competing lines of railroads; to
destroy competition between them, to
create a monopoly of transportation
in the section served by them, and to
defeat the condition , attached by the
United States to the franchise and land
grants of the Northern Pacific Com
pany." 9901 TflrffifMffirlif

of the corporation will suffer wage re

This reduction -will affect about 150,000
workmen in the various grades of the
subsidiary companies. The remaining
10 per cent of employes are members of
tlje Amalgamated Association of Iron t
Steer and 'Tin Workers, whose wage
schedule runs to July 1, 1904. Â¦

holdersâ were, in most respects, di
vergent and competitive. It borders
on absurdity to say that two railway
corporations which, under 'normal con
ditions', are naturally competitors for
traffic, will continue to compete after
both become subject to the same source
of control. It Is not in the interest of
the stockholder of the Securities Com
pany that one of these railways should
prosper at the expense of the other.
They have a common interest in both;
they receive their dividends from a
fund created by pooling the earnings
of both. A more effective method for
combining competitive Interestsâ for
suppressing competition between rival
and naturally competing business cor
porations â It would hardly be 'possible
to conceive?'

WITH ROMANCE
SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 14.â Quick
action by United States army officers
at Fort Douglas probably saved Private
Thomas R. Fuller from lynching at the
hands of his fellow-soldiers to-day.
Fuller was this morning positively
identified as the soldier who last night
attacked Miss Edith Gill in the south
western part of the city, leaving her
unconscious and severely injured.
When the soldiers at the post learned
that Fuller had been identified as the
girl's assailant a rope was hastily se
cured and a crowd of them hurried
down the steep road to intercept the
street car in which they supposed Ful
ler would be conveyed to the city.
When this was learned Fuller was
hustled into the post ambulance, and
under strong guard was driven into
town. Fuller's home is said to be In
San Francisco. He enlisted here two
weeks ago.

"Let us next see what steps were

property into such a situation as would
enable Mr/ Morgan to make good his
assurance to Mr. Hill that* if he failed
to ' acquire the Northern E Pacific stock
in the manner Just described they
could work in harmony. A reorganiza
tion of the road was expected and a

Jaws of Wisconsin, with power to do
so, took" over the property and fran

pany. , ; ; Â¦ ...:;.. . Â£.- :'
"By" the reorganization agreement, J.

of the reorganization. What Is known
as 'harniony' now prevailed between
the two roads and continued as such
until 1901. when the two roads made
a "joint purchase of the Chicago, Bur
lington and Qiilncy^ Railroad. This
partnership in the "ownership of the
Burlington was almost immediately
followed by the merger, of which the
Government complains.". : .
The Attorney General then detailed
the facts connected with the Burling

cluding his presentation of the evo
lution of the Securities Company, said:
â¢"These facts clearly establish that it
is an instrumentality created to control

The Attorney General gave a detailed
account of the attempt to secure con
trol of the Northern Pacific road, as
shown in the case of Pearsall vs. the

Dr. Hamilton left his home at Point
Richmond yesterday morning, and his
demeanor at that time gave no indi
cation of the fatal purpose then evi
dently possessing his mind, for he bade
his wife good-by with wonted cheer
fulness. Nor was there anything in
his manner to cause suspicion on the
part of the young woman attendant
whom he greeted when he entered his
waiting room in the Parrott building.
He passed at once into his private of

the attendant tapped at his door, but
received no response, and suggested
that the patient wait until he should
be disengaged.
Soon afterward Dr. Gere, who shared
his office accommodations, entered and
also sought admission to Dr. Hamil
ton's room, but his knock upon tlift
door was equally fruitless. Then he
opened the door, and saw his associate
lying upon a lounge, seemingly uncon
scious and with the gray death shad

realized at once that it was a case of

After writing three letters â one to his

was beyond hope of resuscitation. Tlie
letters were as follows:
After sixty-seven years of sturdy

more than ordinary triumph and ac
quiring a fair share of, the material
spoils, Dr. John W. Hamilton, one of
the best-known physicians in Califor

"Oh, no," rejoined Irving blandly;

yet come one of the actors in the com

acting. As he finished his demonstra

him as a man that relished fully the

In respect to the memory of Profes

College yesterday adjourned till' next
Thursday, and a committee ; of -stu
dents was appointed to assist* in tbe
obsequies.
For many years he lived at the
Windsor Hotel-in this city, but about
two weeks ago he moved to "Point
Richmond and took up his residence
at the Critchett Hotel. He had sev
eral talks with Thomas McMahon, the
proprietor of the hotel, about pur
chasing the lease of the premises. He
explained that he desired to reside in
Richmond and travel "back and' forth
to his office in San Francisco each
day, and he thought he might be
able to conduct the hotel In connec
tion with his practice.
On Friday he delivered to Mr. Mc-
Mahon a check to bind the purchase
of the lease, said that he would proba
bly make arrangements to purchase
the property as well as the lease and
asked Mr. McMahon to see if an ex
tension of ten years could not be had
upon the property. He agreed to pay
the balance upon the property last
night and take possession after dinner

HARRISON' CALLS A HAI/T.
General Brooke said to-day that Gen
eral Wood ignored that order and went
on spending public money without au
thority from the Military Governor.
General Brooke was asked whether
he had withdrawn the revenues from
Santiago for expenses elsewhere. He
answered that Santiago had received
all its own revenue and more than
$200,000 additional.
Morrison, a lawyer of New York, tes
tified that he was Interested in the.
Electrozone Company of Havana and
that his company received; contracts
from General Wood for disinfecting the
WOOD IGNORES THE ORDER.
La Fontise said that in May, 1900, a
convict from Florida named Johnson
came to him and said that he had seen
Bellairs and General Wood together at
the races in Havana, and that he rec
ognized and spoke to Bellairs, who
mentioned to him to keep silent. Ac
cording to Johnson's story, as told by
La Fontise. Bellairs excused himself
and met Johnson, asking: him to remain
quiet concerning his criminal record.
After this incident, testified La Fon
tise, General Wood sent for him and
asked what he knew of Bellairs' rec
ord. La Fontise said he told General
Wood of his talk with Johnson and also
what he had learned from other per
sons from Florida. That was in June,
1900, and, according to La Fontise, Gen
eral Wood then asked him to see John
son and ascertain whether he would
leave Cuba and remain away if his pas
sage were paid to New York and money
given. Johnson answered:
"Why do I want to leave? I have too
good a thing here bleeding Bellairs."
La Fontise returned to General Wood
and gave him Johnson's answer. La
Fontise said that later Bellairs and
General Wood went to New York.
GENERAL BROOKE RECALLED.
When General Brooke was before the
committee two weeks ago he referred
to two orders, one Issued by the War
Department ar.d the other by himself
to carry the first into effect, which he
was unable at that time to furnish.
He went on the stand to-day to pre
sent the orders and undergo an ex
amination concernins them.
The order issued by the War Depart
ment directed that an funds collected
in the provinces of Cuba should be sent
to the military auditor at Havana. The
charge was made that the order had
been issued by direction of General
Brooke for the purpose of getting hold
of the funds collected at Santiago, and
to deprive that province of its own
revenue. The newspapers at Santiago
were particularly bitter. General
Brooke told the Military Affairs Com
mittee that the ordeh was issued at a
time when he was sick in bed and that
he had had no previous knowledge con
cerning it.
The other order filed with the com
mittee to-dav was one that the wit
ness issued after his recovery. It di
rected General Wood, in command of
the province of Santiago, not to make
expenditures for public purposes in ex
cess of $10,000 a month without first
submitting the question to the Military
Governor.
AVOOD SHIELDS BELLAIRS.
In addition to corroborating Dr.
Fishers testimony La Fontise. told, of
â¢*^2}15 n I!Â£ r _i n . .'which he had learned jof
Kellairs* character and swore also that
General Wood knew all about it. He
said he learned from persons who went
to Havana from Florida that Bellairs
had served five years in Florida con
vict campsâ three years in one and two
in another. The crime of which he had
been convicted was forgery on a branch
of the Bank of England.
J. O. La Fontise, city editor of the
Jacksonville (Fla.) Times-Union, cor
roborated the testimony given by Dr.
Fisher. He said that before General
Wood and Dr. Fisher started on their
trip to the Isle of Pines the latter in
structed him (La Fontise) to write the
article concerning Bellairs. La Fontise
said he took the question under consid
eration and decided that as the matter
would be highly sensational and in case
of a libel suit it would be necessary to
summon witnesses from the United
States to prove the charges he would
not print the article. He said that when
Dr. Fisher returned he was greatly agi
tated and asked:
"You did not print that article, I
hope?"
When Dr. Fisher learned that the ar
ticJe was not printed he was gTeatly re
lieved and said General Wood did not
want it used.
CORROBORATES DR. FISHER.
Dr. Fisher testified that he told Gen
eral Wood all he had learned of the
character of Bellairs and that he had
offered to General Wood to produce
witnesses who could prove Bellairs to
be indecent morally. He said that
General Wood told him he did not care
to kxow anything about the stories;
that all he asked was that they not be
printed in Havana.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â When the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs
to-day resumed Its investigation of
charges against General Leonard
Wood Dr. C. E. Fisher of Chicago told
the story of General Wood's intimacy
with Bellairs and attempted to show
that General Wood knew of Bellairs'
bad record. Dr. Fisher said that in
September, 1900, he accompanied Gen
eral Wood on a trip to the Isle of
Pines and there told him of an article
which he had ordered printed In the
Havana Post exposing Bellairs. The
witness said that General Wood told
him he did not want the story printed
and it was not used.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â State De
partment advices from San Domingo
indicate that thÂ« fresh revolution .in
that island Is due to a breach between
General Jiminez, who aspired to suc
ceed Wos y Gil as President, and the
provisional Government, which has
been in control of the island since Wos
y Gil was deposed. It is surmised that
Minister Powell's inflexible attitude
toward, the provisional Government,
which he refused to recognize until it
had agreed to admit the validity of
American claims, may have had some
thing to do with this breach.
News of- the plot against i-owen wÂ»Â»
contained in a private communication
from a high official of the iPomlnican
Government to Dominican citizens re
siding In New York. The communica
tion was brought by a passenger who
arrived here on Sunday on the steam
ship >Foxhall from Puerta Plata- The
plot to assassinate Minister Powell ia
described thus in the communication:
rJLAXS OP THE CONSPIRATORS.
'- "On December 5 a high official of the
Government, who took office when Pres
ident Wos y Gil was deposed, made thiÂ»
proposition: â¢
â¢â¢"'Let two or three men got into a
fight some day on a street along which
Minister Powell is to come, and in the
melee the American can be killed by
accident. It is easy and is our best
way to get rid of him.*â
"Several of the men present (all of
them officials) fell in with the p!an, and
all of them began to discuss the de
tails enthusiastically, one suggesting
that it could be arranged for a party
of soldler3, who could congregate un
der arms without exciting comment, to
carry out the pjot.
"Carlos Glnebra. one of the Minister*
of Posts and Telegraphs, vehemently
opposed the idea, saying: 'I will never
consent to such an outrage.* The plan
was then abandoned, but a few influ
ential citisena^who know of the plot
are in constant fear for Minister
Powell's safety."

i NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â Reliable in
formation has reached this city that a
plot was hatched in the provisional
Government of Santo Domingo to as
sassinate the United States Minister to
that republic. William F, Powell, and
also General Juan Jimlnez, prospective
President of the republic. It is fur
ther alleged that two attempts adready
have been made to assassinate Jiminez.
The reason given for the plot against
Powell is that the Minister is "too in
dependent andjs playing a lone hand,
refusing' to â¢ be influenced by poli
ticians." The plotters believe that if
they can get rid of him the United
States will send some man as his suc
cessor who is more; pliable and can be

Count von Bulow then answered Herr
Bebcl's reiterated criticisms of the Gov
ernment's policy in Kast Asiaf saying:
"Our programme there is simple. We
want to retain nnd to develop what we
hold, but not to burn our fingere in mat
tors which do not concern us."
Replying to Herr Bebel'i? assertion
that Government officials are not free
since they cannot be Socialists, the
Chancellor said that "the Social De
mocracy, despite Herr Bebel's rather
lame explanation, profesges republican
ism. The Government official who
vorks for the Social Democracy breaks
his oath, and we will not tolerate such
an official."
Herr Bebel expressed his astonish
ment that Count von Bulow had called
him an "ar-Eel," and, turning to the
Chancellor, taid:
"If you will call me a devil I shall be
ten times more pleased."
Continuing, Herr Bebel said:
â¢â¢You shall hear from us within the
"^xt few weeks a series of facts about
vnich we have information, but of
which you have hitherto had not the
f'.iffhtcst suspicion."
The speaker then answered Chancel
lor von Bulow's speech of last Thurs
day. He declared that the Chancellor
went too far in discussing foreign af
fairs when he referred in terms of
sharp criticism to the United States
Government and Congress regarding
the American policy in the Philippines.
He further repelled #ount von Bulow's
assertion that the Socialises had great
er advantages in Germany than they
have in republican countries, and said:
'I do not know that we have ex
pressed our views with special empha
sis here and I have no disposition to
break my head against a stone wall on
account <">f any republic. The differ
once is that in republics many civil
rights exist v.hich we in Germany
must long wait for. In Switzerland,
France and the United States laborers

I'KO.MISES A SURPRISE.
Dec. 14.â In the Reichstag
to-day the proceedings developed an
oratorical duel between Herr Bebel, the
leader of the Socialist party, and Count
von Bulow, the Imperial Chancellor,
v.hich was not second in importance to
that between those two most interest
ing personalities in German politics
last Tuesday. Herr Bebel spoke for
three and a half hours and was in his
best form. He made a eeriatim reply
to Count von Bulov.'s speech of last
week, the debate ranging over some
what the same groundsÂ»-the maltreat
ment fif private soldiers by their offi
cers, the question of foerign politics,
the achievements of the Socialists in
legislation, the rerfdom of tjie laboring
classes and the socialized state of the
future.
Herr Bebel returned to his attack
upon Russia, speaking of the alleged
p.trocities perpetrated in that country,
whereupon he was called to order by
Count von Ballestrem. President of
the Rei'.hstag, who said:
â¢'It is inadmissible to accuse in this
house a state with which Germany is
allied in friendship of such atrocities."

Up to now it has been held In the
medical world that the germ of scarlet
fever was of vegetable organism.
After years of hard work, Mallory is
able to show that infection in scarlet
fever is by protozoa and to trace the
development of the disease through
successive stages of animal growth.
An important feature of the demon
stration to-morrow will be that Mal
lory will j show the similarity of the
scarlet fever protozoa to- the organism
which causes malaria. While the two
are not identical, the scarlet fever pro
tozoa in appearance suggests the "mar
guerite" formation or the malaria mi
crobe.
BOSTON, Dec. 14.â Dr. Frank Burr
Mallory of the Harvard Medical School
will present to-morrow, night to the
Boston Society of Medical Sciences im
portant Information as to the cause of
scarlet fever, following a long and ex
haustive investigation of the subject.
The main point of his discovery is that
the serm of the disease is of animal
and not of vegetable origin, as has been
held.

SCARLET FEVER
GERM'S ORIGIN
It was the discovery of cold In California
which compelled building of the famous
American clipper ship of fifty years ago. and
so It was these wonderful crofs of. California
whrat which caused the construction In Ameri
can and British yards of a fleet of wooden and
iron Failing ships hitherto unequaled in sice and
etrength.
When this second golden stream began to
flow out through the Golden Gate it took but
a few years for It to reach such Â¦. proportions
that the attention of the world was again at
tracted to California, and tbe conditions of our
harvest were powerful factors In making the
price of wheat 'n the world.
â¢ Let us look back r.ear!y forty years to the
founding of the original Produce Exchange and
of the old Merchants' Exchange, parents of
this exchange.
In the early sixties the production of gold
in California began to diminish and the people
turned largely to agriculture, and by 1860-7
the great valleys were producing sufficient
Tfheat to admit of several hundred thousand
tors being exported.
Remember that it was only two cr three
years before that wheat and flour were t im
ported from Chile and Australia.
A SECOND GOLDEN STREAM.
It is hop^d that under its roof all those com
mercial bodies which are doing so much to ad
vance thiF city and State will find their home.
adjusted by the masons.
In opening the proceedings President
Babcock reviewed the history of the
Merchants' Exchange,- his address be
ing as follows:
We are assembled here -to-day ta lav the
cornerstone of the new Merchants' Exchange,
an organization which should np>Ml to :il! v.ho
are interested In the progress and welfare of
California.
DALY'S ESTATE
IS NOT GREAT
It was a bold step for the Produce Exchange,
_and rrany were the predictions of disaster, but
tlrt wisdom, of the move has been proved be
yond question.
And now we come to. the present exchange,
which was formed three years ago. hy vir
tually amalgamating the Produce Exchange
and the old Merchants' Exchange. The success
of this enterprise Is very larzely due to our
lornvr picsldpnt, George W. McNcar, and Mr.
Frtcdlanduf our secretary, both of whom have
worked] indefatigably to accomplish what
st-emÂ«d 3n almost impossible task, the result
ot wMch will be worthy' of the growing corn
mere" of our port, prove of great benefit to our
corporation and be. an ornament to our city.
The site was purchased .from the old Produce
Exchange, llonds for the cost of the building
were sold, and seven-eiehths of the renting
space leased fcr a term of years, and when
we occupy our quarters at the end of next year
the exchange will be in receipt of a revenue
i ample for fill purposes.

In an old rtructure at the corner of Davis and
Clay streets, deeldWh to purchaFe the control of

And eo it was in'the year of this firstilarge
wheat crop, In 186(1-67. that the Merchants' Ex
change was incorporated, and a few months
later the Pan Francisco Produce .Exchange was
inaugurated under S the leadership of Horace
Davis, who was its first president, and who
held that office for. ten .. years. It is -certainly

President William Babcock delivered
a short address and was followed by
Horace Davis and G. W. McXear,
former presidents of the exchange.
When the speeches were finished Sec
retary Friedlander deposited a sealed
tin box in the cavity beneath the cor
nrrstone. President Babccck then
spread the mortar with a silver trowel
and amid cheers the ponderous granite
cornerstone was lowered into place and
commercial bodies of the city and only
those unable to be present were missed
from the gathering.
At the southeast corner of the new
building, which is situated on Cali
fornia street, near Montgomery, a tem
porary stand had been erected and
decorated with bunting and national
fiass.
The massive iron work of the new
building was also bedecked with flags
and the Stars and Stripes were hoisted
from the top story of the building in
token of the momentous event of the
laying of the cornerstone.
President/ William Babcock of the
new Merchants' Exchange did the work
of laying the stone, assisted b>_ Secre
tary Cary T. Friedlander and Arthur
McEwen, the contractor for the stone
%\ork on the building.
A large crowd of sightseers witnessed
the proceedings, while three hundred
merchants gathered inside the struct
ure and stood around the temporary
stand where the cornerstone was laid.

CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â There was told
in court to-day the story of a couple
who parted at the doors of Mrs. Kath
ryn Tingley's Temple of Theosophy at
Point Loma, Cal., because the wife
wished to probe into the occult mys
teries of Yogi and "Universal Brother
hcctU" while her children were left to
the airy protection of "higher law" and
her husbandâ well, it is alleged she
didn't care much what did become of
him, because Mrs. Tingley said he was
a tyrant.
On. the strength of this story, sub
stantiated by evidence in detail, Judge
Kavanagh to-day granted a divorce to
John J. Bohn, publisher and editor of
the Hotel "World, and gave him the
custody of the children. Bohn testi
fied that he married Miss Grace Green
on October 17, 1892, and that they lived
together happily until about seven
years ago, when Mrs^Bohn joined a
branch of the Theosophlcal Society,
which met In Masonic Temple. Then,
he says, she became infatuated with
the new cult and attended ' meetings
three times a week, leaving the children
in his care.
"One day." said he. "I came home to
find the children in the care of a
stranger. I spoke to my wife about it,
whereupon she told me that the chil
dren would be cared for by a 'higher
law' even if I placed them out in the
street. We "went to California In 1301
and after she had attended meetings
there she insisted on having the chil
dren placed in the Raga Yogi Philo
sophic School at Point Loma. I ob
jected, then she turned on me for the
first time in her life and declared in
violently profane language she would
never live with me again." \
Mrs. Tingley is said to have been
present at the quarrel in the capacity
of umpire and to have had the last
word by telling Bohn that he came of
seven generations of tyrants. The next
day, Bohn averred, his wife left the
hotel, where .they were stopping," taking
the children with her, and that he was
obliged to appeal to the Supreme Court
of California for a writ of habeas
corpus in order to get them again. A
number of neighbors and friends of the
family, testified to Mrs. Bohn's deser
tion.

HONOLULU, Dec. 14.âEx-Agricul
tural Commissioner" Wray Taylor, who
was indicted last Mareh for the alleged
embezzlement of $S00 of .Government
money, has been heard from. Taylor
went to California early In the year on
official business, and after visiting a
number of agricultural officials was not
heard of again. An inquiry disclosed
that he had disappeared and that he
was short in his accounts as Agricul
tural Commissioner. His indictment
followed.
A letter Just received here from Epis
copal Bishop Restarick of Hawaii says
that Taylor visited the" Bishop while
the latter was in New York. Taylor
said that he had been home to England,
but could not recall making the trip.
His njir.d was a" blank from the time
he was in San Francisco until he was
with relatives In England. Taylor's
story finds many believers here. He
could have been an embezzler for a
large amount had he been so inclined,
aa his career had been one . of trust.
He was organist- for the- Anglican
Fathers. His brother, who is said to
have experienced a- similar lapse of
memory, died here recently.

and tho officer was compelled to draw
his revolver before he could subdue "nls

J. Tysma, a well-groomed Hollander,
who says he is making a tour of the
world, has been doing a good deal of
touring in San Francisco during his
three weeks' stay in this interesting
metropolis. A week after his arrival he
landed before Judge Cabaniss on the
charge of carrying concealed weapons
and was fined $10. Appended to the
charge was a tale of a golden career in
the opulent haunts of pleasure, of
which, the court refused to take cogniz
ance. A few days later Judge Cabaniss
wandered into Judge Conlan's court
and found the touring Hollander again
arraigned for packing around deadly
weapons. There were sidelights to this
story that did not get into the record.
Once again yesterday Herr Tysma
loomed up fresh and smiling before
Judge Cabaniss. He had evidently got
the Police Court habit, which is more
seductive than morphine.' This time he
had trouble with a hackman, which
was adjusted on an equitable basis by
the court. Judge Cabaniss told the tour
ist who is touring so much in narrow
circles that the best thing he could do
was to go back to his native dykes and
the tender care of his mother. The
great world was no place' for h'.z exu
berant temperament. Herr Tysma
promised to think It over.
Sobatoris Viassi, although a native
of a commercially decadent nation, is
personally a strong believer in aggres
siveness in the extension of trade. He
is a trader only in a small way, but
he is aggressive enough to capture the
entire markets of the world, if only
he were let alone. He peddles limes
to private houses and when he fails
to make a sale he stands out on the
front stoop and curses the entire fam-1
ily clear down to the dog in blood
curdling mixtures of American and
Italian profanity/ The only way to se
cure his withdrawal is to purchase his
wares. Several complaints were made
of his methods and he was up before
Judge Mogan yesterday. He was
promptly found guilty of disturbing the
peace, but the charge of peddling with
out a license went over until to-day
for further investigation. At any rate
his commercial ideas will undergo re
vision when the Judge finishes with
him. |
Fight for Presidency of Lady Manag
ers Lies Between Mrs. Ilorton
and Mrs. Manning.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 14.â Miss Helen
Gould to-day notified her friends
among .the Board of Lady Managers of
the World's Fair that under no circum
stances could she consider acceptance
of the position of president to suc
ceed Mrs. James L. Blair. This, ac
cording to the members themselves,
leaves the contest practically between
Mrs. John Miller Horton of Buffalo and
Mrs. Daniel Manning of Washington.
Mrs. Mary Phelps 3Iontgomery of
Portland, Ore., who has been mentioned
as a candidate for president, said to
day that she thought there was no
question that the contest would ba be
tween Mrs. Horton and Mrs. Manning.
She believed Mrs. Manning would be
chosen.
The board will make an effort after
convening to-morrow to secure permis
sion to change the by-laws so that the
present limitation of twenty-one mem-'
bers shall be increased to twenty
three.
MISS HELEN* GOULD
DECLINES THE HONOR
Woman's devotion to man was illus
trated forcibly in Judge Mogan's court
yesterday. Some weeks ago Philip Kel
ly, living at 1318 Hampshire street, at
tacked his wife with a butcher knife,
cut her severely in the hand and
stabbed her in the left breast. Fright
ened* at his deed, he sought medical as
sistance unsuccessfully, and finally
came to the police station and said that
he had stabbed his wife and feared she
was going to die. She was sent to the
Receiving Hospital and the husband
was locked up on the charge of at
tempted murder. When the case came
up for preliminary hearing the first
time the Judge asked the wife if she
was in earnest in her intention to pros
ecute her husband. Smarting from her
injuries, she proclaimed that she want
ed him punished. She appeared yester
day with a four-months-old baby in her
arms and calmly told the court that
she did not want to testify against
Kelly. There was nothing to do except
dismiss lhe defendant, and the reunited
trio left the courtroom with the wom
an's hand in the man's and her eyes
smiling up to him.
VANCOUVER, B. C.'-Dec. 14.â Drs.
Morris and Williams of Vernon to-day
engaged in a rough and tumble fight at
a Coroner's inquest held in that town.
It was the culmination of an inquiry
into the cause of the death of a woman
named Marion RusselL There was a
large attendance of lawyers and phy
sicians from neighboring towns. The
two doctors pummeled each other and
one' of the lawyers was knocked down
during the fight and trampled upon by
the combatants. Policemen were sent
for and order was finally restored.
Tlie Coroner's jury brought in a ver
dict of death from natural causes, but
accused Dr. Williams of unprofessional
conduct and declared that the quarrel
between the only two doctors of' the
town was a menace to the community.
Later the Jury declared that in its
opinion a man named Ferguson should
be run out of the town.

\V. H. Clifford, playwright, author,
librettist and other things, testified he
roomed at the Adams House' with Wil
kerson and knew of his conduct. He
nÂ«Â»ver saw Miss Rosedale in Wilkerson's
apartments.
Ovita Leathe, who is r-'W Mrs.
Hawes, sat with, Flossie Hope during
the play and smiled and wept as the
drama was unfolded. Sue is the young
vnman who gave testimony ihf.t partly
proved that Wilkerson had bsen guilty
o r suspicious acts, and wh? f i witnosses
were put on the stand in the afternoon
to prove her good character Attorney
Newbergh insinuated that hjw character
was bad. Mrs. Hawes burst into tears
and tried to break in on the p!ay. Mrs.
.Barney Bernard led her from the play
house in order .that the porformance
-might not be interrupted.
The muchly abused heroine said she
â¢ earned $150 a week at Fischer's. The
.heavy villain afterward cut in and said
he had given his wife thousand* of dol
lars and it was not stage money. When
the friends'of the muchly abused wife
had the stage Wilkerson muttered un
der his breath and bit his nails In real
melodramatic style. The performance
was not over at 4:30 p.' m.' so it was
continued until this morning. The au
'dience crowded the stag* door and
'waited until the actors In the drama
â¢came out. The "Johnnies" ogled the
chorus girls and others stared at the
leading man and women.
â¢ K Â¦ - : Â¦; .- ' â¢
"No, I never did."
"Did you ever play cards with W il- r
kerson?" he was asked.
"Yes, I played poker with him until
the early hours of the morning."
"For heavy stakes?"
THEY PLAYED POKEH.
Miss Rosedale was allowed to seok
the seclusion of the wings au-l Harry
Harris, a man with a heavy cold, al
lowed the calcium to shine on nim for
awhile.
"Were you ever addressed as 'the llt
tlp Indian squaw'?!'
"Yes. Miss Gorman might ha\e called
me that." *
"Was Mr. Wilkerson ever in your
room in Spokane?"
"Yes, twite, but in th3 davt!m-.\"
"How did Mr. Wilkerson's trunk
come to be in your room?"
"I 'paid him $5 for it in Spokane."
The play might have been entitled
"The Lost Pajamas." Spicy lines .en
livened the production. Pretty chorus
girls without their make-ups held the
center of the stage and spoke their
lines, prompted at times by the inquir
ing relative and the Hebrew comedian.
Harry James came out to lead the or
chestra, and .a few master mechanics
were on hand to help out if needed.
Myrtle Rosedale held the stage for a
long time. Her acting was superb. She
never forgot her lines and played her
part nicely. She is called the co-re
spondent, but she declines the title. The
audience held its breath as the witness
told of locked doors that separated her
from, the heavy villain on northern
trips. She denied that Wilkerson ever
played "Sanho" with her and' carried
her from one room to another. She said
she knew there was a key in the door,
because she had examined the door. Â¦ '
"But you wore pajamas?" asked
Humphrey.
"I did, and they were red," said Miss
Rosedale. '
"Did you ever . call Wilkerson
'Daddy'?"
'1 never did." ,
"THE LOST PAJAMAS."
For the. last week a pair of pajamas
have hovered over the Wilkerson di
vorce case. One witness said "they were
baby blue, another vowed they were
pink, the defendant swore they were
cream-colored and how the co-respond
ent in the case comes forward and de
clares they were red. Judge Murasky
has taken 'judicial notice of the color,
and unless the said pajamas are
brought into court and marked "Ex
hibit A" more testimony must be intro
duced'to pVove who wore them. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
Myrtle Rosedale, a -chorus girl with
soulful black eyes, a retrousse nose and
a charming lisp, denied that Ira Puerl
Wilkerson presented them to her. She
claims she bought them and wore them
at all times. Attorney William F. Hum
phrey, who represents Maud Amber
(Mrs. Wilkerson) in the divorce pro
ceedings, tried hard yesterday to prove
the original ownership of the pajamas,
but Miss Rosedale was too wary.
There was a select audience in Judge
Murasky's courtroom yesterday to see
the performance. The Wilkerson di
vorce suit has the elements of a trag T
edy and a farce. Puerl Wilkerson is the
heavy villain, and Amber, 'the
statuesque song queen at Fischer's, is
the muchly abused heroine. When the
curtain went up yesterday morning the
critics occupied orchestra seats and en-
Joyed the play hugely. Judge Murasky
fulfilled the position of stage manager
and allowed no waits. Attorney A. S.
Newbergh played the Hebrew come
dian, and Attorney Humphrey assumed
the role of the inquiring relative. There
was a dim light in the courtroom and
the scenes were sometimes
sometimes pathetic and at all times
sensational.
PORTLAND. Or., Dec. 14.â Copies
have been received here of a scathing
letter sent by Senator Fulton and Sen
ator Mitchell to Attorney General
Knox, protesting against the appoint
ment of Francis J. Heney and C. A. S.
Frost as special prosecutors in the Ore
gon land fraud cases. The letter, which
is quite lengthy, says in part:
"We cannot but / regret that you
should have felt compelled to go out
of Oregon to secure competentlegal.as
sistarits. Had you gone elsewhere than
to California to secure assistants, we
might have thought you were indis
posed to select one from Oregon lest
in so doing you might secure one whose
business interests would be in some
way affected by the prosecutions: but
such could not have been the motive
that guided you, or you would have
gone elsewhere than to California, for
it is generally believed that the head
and front of ' whatever conspiracy *has
existed to defraud the Government in
the matter of timber lands has its
home in' San Francisco.
"To have ignored our recommenda
tion in order to appoint for the work
one who has just escaped from jail
leaves us at a loss to understand what
we have done to merit such treatment.
And the matter becomes more and
more inexplicable to us when we re
member that this San Francisco at
torney was sentenced to jail upon a
judgment of conviction of a crime
quite similar in character to the one
for which the parties he has now. been
appointed to prosecute have been in
dicted."

Attorney General the Recipient
of a Missive Denouncing Al

. Mrs. Alice. Peck, who lives with her
husband and -her mother on Fulton
street, has hot been 'taking any three
jear course at a "German university in
studying hour to rear children. She
has a much simpler method than that.
She believes in a long right hand
swing to the butt of the- ear and then
if the child is not; sufficiently, raised
she follows with a left hook to the jaw.
She explained' the method ' to Judge
Mogan yesterday. Nine little chil
dren all in a row,. four of whom were
little girls, invaded the back yard at
tached to the domicile of which Mrs.
Peck and her family occupy the upper
portion. The woman in the lower fiat
suffered the little ones to play in the
back yard without molestation, but
Mrs. Peck resented the intrusion and
descending in her wrath on the
youngsters caught hold of a little girl
and slapped her soundly. '"I gave her
a good, hard slapping." she told Judge
Mogan. The children also testified
that Mrs. Peck had a revolver in her
hand and pointed it at them. This,
she explained to the Judge, who erro
neous. She had been cleaning her re
volver, she said, and rushed down
stairs without giving any thought to
the weapon she carried. She denied
that she had pointed it at the chil
dren. As a defense she said that the.
children had .gibed at her when told
to leave the premises and she thought
she had a right to expel them forcibly.-
Judge Mogan found her guilty and
will tell her this morning the amount
her mistaken idea of how to raise
children will cost her.

Doubt," in which the unsettling effect
of doubt upon the practical life of
Christian men and women-'was treated.
Rev. William M. Brewster, just ar
rived from China, told of the converts
of his mission and of the feeling among
the natives to contribute to the Chris
tian work and make it self-supporting
and independent, so far as money is
concerned, of the missionary board.
Bishop Hamilton and numerous min
isters were present.
CLERGYMEN PRESENT.
He said further that the church was
awakening anew and they heard of
prayer everywhere. Prayer, 'said Dr.
Bevier, gave a lighter mind and those
that prayed became energetic and en-
Joyed the fullness of life.
Among: those who were present were:
Rev. Edward K. Strong, Rev. H. H.
Bell, D. D., Rev. W. H. Landon, D. D.,

At a meeting of the clergymen of the
Congregational church at the Y. M. C.
A. building yesterday, Rev. William
Rader presided and there was a large
attendance.
Rev. Dr. W. C. Day delivered an ad
dress, his subject being "The Coming
Revival," which â¢ he said was among
the greatest present needs.
CHURCH AWAKENING ANEW.
Clergymen of the various denomi
nations had 'a busy day yesterday,
Methodists, Presbyterians and CQngre
gationalists meeting at their various
headquarters and hearing profound pa
pers on theological subjects and plan
ning for future engagements in church
work.
The Presbyterian ministers met at
the Woman's Occidental Board, when
Rev. Dr. J. M. McElhlnney presided. .
The paper of the day was read by
Rev. Dr. Bevler and his subject was
"Prayer." Rev. Dr. Bevier said, among
other things, that at this period they
looked upon prayer as work, as labor
and a duty. He considered that there
Avas a service in prayer as well as a
privilege and said further that all he
roes of the past had been men Â¦ of
prayer. Paul's life began and ended
with prayer. Indeed, said Dr. Bevier,
his life was filled with the idea of
prayer.
"A person who has addressed the
ministerial body has been visiting va
rfous denominations pretending, I
hear, to belong to each denomination
called 'upon, and has presented cre
dentials of which he evidently has an
assortment to suit each -one. I heard
that he visited a gentleman of the
Roman Catholic church and told him
that he had been converted to that
faith and received a contribution of
$5 from him. It Is one of those im
positions that should be exposed,"
though at tirst I v.as inclined to ad
vise suppression of the matter."
The Rev. James Wood worth quito
agreed' with Dr. Wills and reminded
the ministers that some time ago they
had been grossly imposed upon by a
man who presented his credentials,
which upon inquiry turned 'out to be
an impudent forgery. >
The Rev. Mr. Vanee has a small room
at a Turkish bath establishment on
Market. street. Mr. McCoy feels a sood
deal of sorrow for the man and said
yesterday that he did not think there
was any harm in Mr. Vanee.
The Rev. Mr. Guthrie is more out
spoken and condemns what seems to
him a most extraordinary procedure.
Speaking of the affair later, Dr. Wills
raid:
"I may at once say that I object to
having men speak here until they are
known. And by this I would have it
fully understood that I do not object
to men of other denominations, or even
men not connected with any denomina
tion, addressing this body. But they
must be men of good reputation and
known.
"I do not intend to mention nny
name, but I allude to one who has
victimized members of this union and
other denominations and I simply men
tion this as a warning as to our course
in the future."
GROSSLY I31POSED UPOX.
Speaking at the ministers* meeting
yesterday, which Mr. Vanee addressed
last Monday week, the Rev. Dr. J. T
Wills said:
Mr. Vanee had also, probably in the
desperation of circumstances, ap
pealed to the Rev. Mr. Guthrie for a
Jetter to Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads which might enable
him to get a position on the cars as
gripman or conductor. The letter was
Riven but not without the minister flrst
trying to dissuade his applicant from
turning to the occupation. Subsequent
revelations then prompted Mr. Guthrie
to write to Mr. Chapman and with
draw his recommendation.
WOULD BE A GRIPMAX.
By some means not explained Mr.
Vanee discovered that Mr. McCoy had
been informed about the advertisement
which was so objectionable to the
Young Men's Christian Association, and
straightway wrote the general man
ager of the association, not only regret
ting the publication, but explaining
that men do things when in pressed
circumstances which they would at no
other time think of doing, and, further,
Mr. Vanee made an appeal to Mr. Mc-
Coy for assistance toward his passage
back to far-off Australia.
It is a fact that the Rev. Mr. Edgar
Vanee, according to his own statement,
was looked upon as responsible for a
Fimllar matrimonial advertisement that
appeared In a Vancouver paper not so
long ago, and it Is a fact that the Rev.
Mr. Edgar Vanee threatened the pro
prietor of the Vancouver paper for an
article which connected the Antipodean
gentleman with the sams matrimonial
advertisement, but he let the matter
drop after his lawyers told him, he
says, of the great expense such an ac
tion would Involve.
And a number of such instances got
whispered about, until the members of
the presbytery began to fear that their
confidence had been misplaced.
General Manager McCoy of the Young
Men's Christian Association was told
of the matrimonial advertisement and
was deeply hurt about the matter.
It came to the ears of an elder that
Mr. Vanee had been a member of the
Roman. Catholic faith and had told a
gentleman that he was a convert, but
his position was such that he required
aid, and without further explanation
his need was magnanimously complied
with.
SUSPICIONS AROUSED.
At'STRAI. IAN clenfj'man. returning lecturing,
.2S. late speaker V. M. C. A., seeks wife with
means.
Such was the advertisement that ap
i peared in a local paper Monday, No
j vember 23, the day following a lecture
given in the Young Men's Christian
Association auditorium by a man who
styled himself, and so far as any one
knows with no malicious purpose, the
Rev. Edgar Vanee of Sydney, Austra
lia.
Two weeks later the Rev. Mr. Vanee
of Sydney, Australia, presented him
self at the mission house of the Wom
an's Occidental Board of Foreign Pres
byterian Missions, Sacramento street, '
and by consent delivered an address,
which was later debated by the august
ministerial body, which meets every
Monday to hear learned papers and dis
cuss ecclesiastical subjects.
Tho address was received with pro
found acknowledgement, and the Rev.
Mr. Edgar Vanee left the premises and
later expressed a desire to court the
acquaintance of several Presbyterian
ministers of note In the community. He
succeeded, and among them was the
Rev. Mr. Guthrie of the First Presbyte
rian Church, whose quick perception
prompted him that his ministerial
brother from the Antipodes was not too
well off with this world's comforts. The
kindly minister after an interview
pressed the Antipodean to remain and
accept a place at the family board.
The Rev. Mr. Vanee complied with the
warm invitation and later received
from the reverend gentleman pecuniary
assistance.
Dr. Stone of Mount Zion Hospital was
immediately called by telephone, but
Mrs. Fitzgerald had been dead for
many hours.
The unfortunate woman had been
sick and despondent for a long time.
Emil G. Kluge, a member of the re
tail clear firm of Kern & Kluge at 97
Third street, was found suffocated by
illuminating gas in the pantry of his
residence, 3780 Twenty-third street, yes
terday morning. His relatives are of
the opinion that his death was the re
sult of an accident. His 11-year-old
son Frederick, with whom he slept, in
formed the family that his father got
out of bed at 31 o'clock on Sunday
night, partly dressed himself and went
to the pantry to get some hot water,
his health having: been very poor late
ly. When the boy awoke in the morn
ing he saw that his father had not
returned and he informed decedent's
stepdaughter. Miss Emily Schneider,
who found Mr. Kluge lying dead on
the pantry floor near a small gas stove,
the kev of the burner being open and
the gas flowing from it. the. flame be
fng out. A small pan of water was on
the stove, which lends plausibility to
the theory of accident.
Mrs: Mary J. Fitzgerald, 72 years old,
committed suicide last Sunday night
at her residence, 2320 Sutter street, by
inhaling illuminating gas. Her daugh
ter, Mrs. H. L. Atkinson, with whom
she lived, smelled escaping .gas in the
house "at 6 o'clock yesrerday morning.
She notified her husband and they made
a search for the leak and found Mrs.
Fitzgerald's body lying in bed undress
ed. The keys on the two gas burners
in the room were open and gas was
flowing from the fixture. On the bed
they found a small satchel with a note
in it containing the following:
"Forgive me, May. It will soon be all
over."

The exhibition of the Guild of Arts

auspiciously, with many merited hon
ors for the gifted artists whose work
was shown in the Palace Maple room.
The popularity of the exhibition ren

The Contemporary Club held its last

their friends, and the attendance was
unusually large. Mrs. Bertha Brosius,

'Alaska's Giant Glacier.
Muir Glacier, which is nearly as
large as the State of Rhode Island,
has receded nearly three miles since
1899. Formerly the glacier was visited
by great crowds of tourists, -who
found it one of the most wonderful
sights in wonderful Alaska; but in the
fall of 1899 a great earthquake shook
the' huge mass so violently that Im
mense fragments : were tumbled from
Its ice front, preventing tourists from
approaching nearer than five or ten
miles. During the past summer a mem
ber' of the National Geographic So
ciety,- C. L. Andrews of Skagway.
and a photographer, .desiring to learn
the- changes that had been . taking
place, proceeded In an open boat from
Skagway to Muir Inlet, a distance of
150 mile3, and landed on the moraine
of .the glacier. They then exploded the
ice mass thoroughly, taking many
pictures. Mr. Andrews publishes an
Illustrated account of what he found

Colonel Younghusband of the. British army has led-an
armed force across the -Himalayas into Thibet upon an
"exploring expedition." The ultimate' results of his "ex

The purpose of Colonel Younghusband's advance into
the Forbidden Country is manifest. What Lord Xlive
did in India is nbw^to be repeated by this adventurous
army officer. A "sphere of influence" in the barbaric
court of the Grand Lama may, be easily enforced by
armed exploring parties. According to the well-ordered
English procedure this can be followed by a protectorate/
and then by absolute dominion. Evidently Great Britain
would have the Himalayas and more as a barrier against
the predatory raids of Adam Zad. The-mouhtain passes

By the first kiss ever kissed.

DEATH PENALTYâ A. O. a. City.
Greece enforces the death penalty for
capital crimes. The executioner is a
condemned murderer who is given th*
choice of executing others or being
himself executed. If he accepts he be
comes the executioner during life or
until by age is unable to perform the
duties of his office. The one so chosen
Is required to live alone in an old tower
built by Venetians on an islet outside
of the port of Nauplia, where neces^
saries are taken to him every morning
by a boatman.
PRE-EMPTION FILINGâ An Old
Subscriber. Marysville, Cal. A pre
emption filing is no bar to a homestead
entry under the United States law. The
first actual settler who makes entry
three months after actual settlement is
entitled to land, while the first man to
make entry may have been the last to
make settlement, and hence have ths
least claim to the land.
The oil fields of Russia at Baku, on
the Caspian Sea. however, bear the
palm both for abundance and con
stancy of production. From the earl^
lest times gas has been known to come
out of the rocks -there, so that It early
became a sacred place for the Parsees,
or fire worshipers.? For .' thousands of
years the sacred fires were kept burn
ing, beneath the dome, of a great.tem
ple built bythe priests, and religious
devotees came from . as far away as
India. . Indeed, it "is. only a- few. years
since their visits ceased.
The commercial discovery of petro
leum dates from the memory of men
now little past middle life. Between
1850 and 18C0 much alarm began to be
felt throughout the civilized world be
cause the whale fisheries were becom
ing unproductive. The disappearance
of whales meant the disappearance .of
whale oil, â¢which was the main depsnd
ence for light.
For some time, however, rock oil, or
petroleum, had been known to exude in
small quantities in Western Pennsyl
vania, and was put up in small bottles
and sold for 25 cents as an ointment
good for rheumatism and other Ills.
Sometimes thl* was called Mexican oil,
but more generally Seneca oil, from
the name of the Indian tribe settled on
the Allegheny River, where it was
chiefly found. But there had been no
thought of getting it in sufficient quan
tities for fuel and light. Still in some
places It formed such a "scum" on the
small streams that It was reported the
small boys vho went in swimming
were made so slippery that they could
not keep their clothes on.
The most plausible theory to account
for the great supplies of. oil which are
now found In the "oil sands", of West
ern Pennsylvania and vicinity Is that
it is a' slow accumulation from -the dis
tillation of the shales, which has
been unable to escape through the com
pact rocks covering the surface and
has. found refuge in the interstices and
crevices of the loose sandstone overly
ing the_ shale. ..'...,
More recently important discoveries
of oil have been - made in Colorado,
Wyoming, California and Texas. That
In California.' is specially Important, as
the State had no coal mines. Almost
Immediately on the discovery of this
oil in California it came into use in
the locomotives of the^. great railroad
lines. Th*Â» Texas fields were so far
from economical means of transporta
tion that much has been lost, while the
supply Is ndt as great as was at first
hoped. .. .

Democratic Prelate.
Dr. Winnington-Ingram, the Bishop
of London, is an unconventional as
President Roosevelt. He is the bosom
friend of the East End costermongers.
They ride with him in his carriage,
and he rides with them in theirs. The
accident that one is a landau drawn
by a horse and the other a barrow
drawn by a donkey makes no differ
ence. His camaraderie is natural, not
affected. He is an Oxford man, but
he knows how to mix the Oxford ac
cent with the Cockney dialect. His
rough, practical common sense recalls
that of the late Dr. Temple, but he is
free from that great Archbishop's fa
mous brusquerle. He is no orator.
His energy takes the English form of
administrative passion.
He is a lean, laborious man, restless,
quick, keen, nervous, every feature
alive with intense purpose, his muscles
like coiled springs^ready to release.
The candid flash of his eye recalls the
glance of John Morley. Add to it the
sharp -vigilance of Anthony Hope and
you have a rough sketch of his ex

A Good Suggestion.
E. A. Denicke. the enterprising mem
ber of the California Promotion Com
mittee, in a communication to The Call
offers the following unique suggestion
for a San Francisco feature at the
World's Fair. He writes:
"Permit me to suggest a circular pan
orama in a separate building, the spec
tator to stand on Goat Island. Twin
Peaks. Rincon Hill. Alta square or oth
er point as may be thought best. We
have a number of artists in this city
who. if employed at once, could get the
painting done in time."
THE great misfortune to man in the operation of any
form of . religion is secretiveness. All adherents' to
a religious idea which attracts numbers assume
some sort of moral obligation, take oi|- some vows, sub
scribe to some creed. When this is done publicly and
the nature of the obligation is known of all men the state
is not disturbed. But when the obligation is secret,
when it is assumed behind a veil and in a place that none
unobligated are permitted to enter, it becomes the means
of enchaining the mind and enslaving the reason.
Secret religious ceremonies are promotive of supersti
tion and imply a control, of men that projects beyond the
essential purposes of religion to dictate civil action and
civic duty. The state claims its citizens for its purposes
alone. It refuses to recognize or reject any form of the
religious idea," be it' Christian or pagan. Under these
circumstances if a civil state exist in which one form of
religion is in the majority, and that form entrenches
ecclesiastical power behind secret ceremonies, and by
secret obligations that" make those who take them sub
ject themselves to ecclesiastical dictation of their civil
actions as members â¢ of. the political state, a union of
church and (State is created and the state is 'virtually de
throned and displaced by a theocracy. Human liberty
is not safe in the'keeping' of a political theocracy.
Apostle Woodruff of the Mormon church in discussing
the Smoot case in. the: tabernacle- at .'Salt Lake last Sun
day said: "American citizenship came from God, and
let man beware of how he attempts to undo what God
has done. It is remarkable that any person be so nar
row, so bigoted, that because another person does not
believe the same as he does he would deny him the right
of his American citizenship." There are none so bigoted
as that. There are none who propose to take away citi
zenship or make its rights depend upon religious belief.
Nor is American citizenship of celestial origin or sanc
tion, for it that were so the nations that live under other
forms of government are victims of the Divine neglect.
Citizenship is neither a privilege nor a pleasure. It is a
responsibility, and he who holds American citizenship is
responsible for its use for the purposes of the state alone
and not for the purposes of any church.
The oaths and obligations of the Mormon church are
secret. They are not known. The ghostly compact of
the Twelve Apostles is not public. It is secret. But
reasoning backward from what happens publicly it is be
lieved by many that in that system of obligations some
where there is evaporated by oath the principle of Ameri
can citizenship and its condensation into the hands of the
hierarchy. When the members of a church are known to
hold publicly certain political convictions and to vote
against them as members of the state it is evidence that
they have surrendered to the church their right of prU
vate judgment. That is the situation that is believed to
exist in Utah. If it exist it is" the end of civil govern
ment. It is the subversion of the state by the church.
Apostle Woodruff says American citizenship comes
from God. While that declaration may be open to more
than one interpretation its meaning intended by him is
"obvious.^ .According to; the institutes and practice- of the
Mormon, church it is the representative to its people of
God on earth. Citizenship, not inhering in birth or nat
uralization, not being a civil condition, originating in the
laws of the state and for the purposes of the state, be
comes, according to the apostle, a concern solely of the
church." "This "is the necessary conclusion of his premise.
The state imposes, obligations and penalties upon the re
sponsibility of citizenship. It forbids treason, but that
which the state defines as treason tor it may be held to'
be loyalty to the church, the representative and agent of
"God, of whom the apostles are the vicegerents.
The theory of citizenship held by the apostle and prac
ticed by the church is- of interest because of the quite
uncertain state of the fundamental law. The constitu
tion forbids that Congress pass any law respecting the
establishment of- any religion and provides that no relig
ious 'test shall berequired as a qualification for any office
or trust under the United States. When a church subor
dinates citizenship and dictates its exercise it has estab
lishedVa religious test for office and, using the state as
an agent, is, doing^what the state cannot do as principal.
.Woodruff's appearance in the discussion supplies ma
terial'for those who watch with care* over the political
equality of the believers in all forms of religion.
AN APOSTOLIC MISTAKE.
STRAIGHT COUNTER.
Embarrassed.
"Chudge, can you git me some mo
mends?" said a big., good-natured
looking German the other day to
Judge Graham as he was about to en
ter his chambers.
"Certainly," said Graham. . ushering
the Teuton into the room. "What can
I 'do for you?"
The German stood on one foot and
then on the other, twisted his hat all
out of shape, started to say something
and then commenced twisting and
turning again.
"I'm in a hurry, my man," said the
Judge; "you will have to be quick."
Still the German did not speak. He
seemed to get more excited, and then
after a moment into his inside coat
pocket went a huge fist. In a twink
ling it again came into view., contain
ing a legal looking document.
"Some advices, Chudge," he blurted
out; "please gif it to me."
The Judge opened the document and
saw that it was a license for John
Schmidt to marry Wilhelmina Strauss.
"Well, well," said the exasperated
jurist, "what do you wapt?" j-
"Oh,. .'Chudge, please do help me
ouid!" cried the German. "Tell me
somedings vot I must do. I was lof
Wilhelmina like anydlngs. I lof Kat
rina Schultz more better. Yesterday
night Katrina. say 'yes' and to-day I
come by'der nail to get me some li

A negro, convicted of a heinous offense, has been sen
tenced to serve an imprisonment of one thousand years
in-Tcxas. To an ordinary observer it seems that if not
the length of the sentence surely its locality brings it
within the prohibitive category of unnatural punishments.
It is terrifying to contemplate the residence of anybody,
dead or alive, for one thousand years in Texas.
Alcoholism Hidden.
Switzerland is a country in which
very little drunkenness is to be ob
served, for the good and sufficient
reason that the police arrest on the
spot every person who shows the least
sign of Intoxication. There is, never
theless, a large amount ol secret drink
ing, and especially in French Switzer
land absinthe has of late increased in
U3e till Its ravages are very noticeable.
The government recognizes the drink
problem a3 a most serious one, and is
doing all it can to find means for its
control. One of its recent investiga
tions concerns the death rate from
alcoholism. Statistics of this nature
are usually Inaccurate, for the reason 'â¢
that it is often impossible to find out
just to^what extent a deceased person
has been given to the use of liquors.
The facts thus collected show that
among males over 20 years of age the
deaths from delirium tremens average
half of 1 per cent. This la. ten tlmea
the rate officially recorded in France
by. the old and imperfect statistical
methods. For males over 70 years of
age alcohol is given as the principal
or concomitant cause of death in 10
per cent of the cases. The general
death rate directly referable to acute
or chronic alcoholism, without in
cluding hepatic cirrhosis or other sub
sidiary conditions, is 3 per cent. This
showing must admittedly be regarded
as an alarming one, and as sufficient

The blov/3 ana parries I am going to

Each and ever;' one of them has

of. them are to-day taught in most
boxing schools.

in the National Geographic Magazine
for December. Muir Glacier is not a
narrow river of Ice of the ordinary
alpine type, but rather a broad lake
of ice fed by tributary streams from
many directions and discharging
through an outlet valley to Glacier
Bay. The map which Mr. Andrew
publishes shows that the glacier has
retreated nearly three miles and has
lost about ten square miles of area.
It Is not improbable that the end of
the career of the Muir as a tidewater
glacier Is near at hand.
IN the exposition of California climate made by Presi
dent Chipman of the State Board of Trade appear
facts which we have constantly insisted should be
kept foremost in the interest of the State. To our cli
mate there has been one serious drawback, which lies in
the lure of it to the sufferers by consumption, the; "white
terror" of the world. Now, however, ample experiment
has shown that the best locality for consumptives is on
the desert, where outdoor life and the sun cure promise
means of relief and cure.
The deserts in Southern California are being increas
ingly utilized for this purpose and the balmy climate of
the rest of the State is becoming less the source of dan
ger. President Chipman exploits the health and blessing
of that life in the open, which is one of the. charms of ex
istence in California. It is a prime means of .avoiding
pulmonary and other diseases of the respiratory system
and of gaining a ruggedness and vigor of constitution,
which fortify it against all of the ills of the flesh.
But bodily health is not the only advantage gained by
living in California. N r or are all the benefits exhibited
in the demonstration of the relation of climate to our
vast and varied production, which is on a scale unknown
to any other similar area in the world. The satisfactions
of life inherent in our climate run also to the esthetic.
It is possible here to adorn the landscape and garnish
cities with a flora that exists nowhere else on the conti
nent in such variety and beauty. California should take
advantage of this, for it is the outward and visible sign
of a peculiarly clement and hospitable climate.
This very question is up now in our neighboring cities
of Oakland and Berkeley in the matter of lining their
streets an^d highways with trees. During the discussion
of this subject two parties have appeared, one alive to
our climatic advantages and Ihe other under the spell of
sentiment and memory. What may be called "the cli
matic party" desires to improve the advantages of our
semi-tropical and equable climate by lining the streets
with palms, which cast but little shade, do not litter the
street and walk by shedding leaves as do the deciduous
trees, and which, being tap root trees, do not invade the
sewers nor tear up the sidewalks. Besides these distinct
advantages the palms, being associated in the mind with
the tropics, give a permanent tropical aspect to a city,
which is very alluring to the people of the East.
Probably no city in the State presents a more beautiful
aspect than Sacramento, not because any attention has
been given to systematic tree planting on the streets, .but
because the lot holders everywhere use the different vari
ties of 'palms, and nearly every home has also planted
around it orange and lemon trees, which are either snowy
with fragrant bloom or*beautiful with loads of the -yel
low fruit. Orange trees with the ripe fruit, .sharing a
lawn with date and fan palms, join to present the most
enchanting picture to the Eastern eye, and Sacramento
should be one of the show places of the State'and will be
so when more attention is paid to streets and the making
of public parks with ample driveways and bridle paths
lined with tropical flora. Oakland has the same oppor
tunity and should improve it. The fan and canary palms
grow there in great form and give an air of luxury'* and
beauty that is imparted by no other trees.
The other party across the bay seems to represent
memory and sentiment and contends for deciduous and
lateral rooted trees. Its favorite seems to be. the elm.
Now the elm is a thirsty tree. It goes far with its roots,
in search of water, and when it finds moisture the~roots,
exulting in the supply, send up suckers to make new
trees, creating an unsightly thicket. Other deciduous
trees have the same bad habits, but even if they were not
drouthy as Tain O'Shanter deciduous trees should be
sparingly used in our cities. Eastern people come here
in the winter months. They leave a landscape that, is
brown and forbidding and on which the trees have shed
their leaves and stand naked in the wintry blast. If they
come to a California city and find the streets lined with
the same lifeless looking trees, bare of foliage and as un
interesting as clothespins, we lose in them the proper im
pression that could be made by writing our climate upon
our very streets in the glad language of the palm.
Visitors to Southern ' California cities see no more
sumptuous sight than the streets and long avenues lined
with palms. If the sky be chill no matter, the palms
speak of sunshine, of eternal summer, of life in the open.
If a lot owner in Oakland wish a customer for his realty
let him plant it with palms. That is the test. He would
not set it in maple, sycamore, elms or even the evergreen
acacia, which is hardly an interesting tree and is thirsty
as a toper. Every five dollars spent in palms will add
fifty dollars to the value of the property. This being so
the community value of the streets is capable of being
enhanced by the same means. Oakland is just now
quickened with ambition. She wants the great gifts of
the future. Let her stretch forth her palms in supplica
tion for the good time coming. Â» ...
Well Xamed.
"Funny how men obtain and retain
sobriquets, isn't it?" said a commercial
man on the train out of Prescott. Ariz.
"There's a man down here that I sell
to twice a year, and the order he hands
me is worth bringing home- He buys
for a string of stores that feed the cop
per mine3 down the road, and when I
first began selling to him I wasn't sure
but that he was handing me a little
jolly to keep my courage up. But his
orders made good, his bills were always
discounted for cash and he became the
lodestar of my hopes as I fared forth
on my southern trip.
"Last year, among other things, he
ordered p. carload of cheese â a carload;
think of It! Well, the goods were de
livered, duly stored in his warehouse
and his account for the same settled
with customary promptness. Three
months later a friend of mine who trav
els for a hardware house blew In on the
cheese plunger and was showing his
prospectus to this man when suddenly
he spied an illustration of a rat trap.
" 'Say, young feller, by gosh, that's
just what I want. Some of them durned
rats have got into my cheese up In
the warehouse. Say. send me down a
carload, young feller.'
" 'What,' exclaimed my hardware
friend, 'a carload of rat traps?' .
" 'That's just what I want, sir,' he re
plied.
"In due time the carload of rat traps
arrived, and since that day the plunger
has been known as 'Rat-trap Riley' the
length and breadth of the Territory.
It is necessary* to rise on the right toe
to lend the desired force and momen
tum.
When the other man is at a distance
it is not necessary to move the heels
from the floor, and the arm is almost
as fully extended as in delivering a
regular swing.
In uppercutting remember that
more of the blow's force depends on
the co-operation of the body than in
almost any other maneuver in boxing.
The arm, too, at whatever angle it is
1>ent, must be rigid and unyielding.
Oft*>n an uppercul will not reach the
face, but land on wind, heart or
throat. Strike in surh a way that the
blow will have full effect wherever it
lands.
The uppercut is most effective when
it lands just on or under the . point
of the jaw. A comparatively light up
percut landing in that locality will do
more to .Â«hake up its victim than
would a far heavier knock anywhere
else. If you doubt this, rap yourself
gently on the point of the chin or
Ju*t beneath that point with your
clenched knuckles. You will notice
a decidedly unpleasant Jarring sen
sation all through your head and face.
The point of the jaw is a doubly vul
nerable point. A blow struck there
not only Jars every nerve in the
hend and directly affects the brain,
but .in uppercut landing on. or under
the point of the jaw throws the head
backward at risk of temporarily
"throwing out" or dislocating the ver
tebrae.
More knockout blows have been
landed on the point of the jaw than
on all the rest of the body put togeth
pr. This statement Van be verified by
a glance at the records of ring bat
tles. As the jaw is so vulnerable. It
is well to remember to guard
it at all stages of the bout.
Never, in boxing. thrust the
chin forward. Always keep the teeth
clenched shut while you have the
gloves on. . Breathe through the nose
and never unclench your teeth under
any pretext. If you do. a light blow
on the jaw is liable to shatter a front
tooth or two.
On uhe same principle, do not turn
your full face on your opponent when
you can avoid doing so. Keep the
face at an oblique angle to him; the
chin drawn In and protected as far as
possible by the left shoulder. This
may not be easy to remember just at
first, but it is less unpleasant than a
series of blows landing flush on your
unguarded jaw. *
* * Â¦ â¢
When a man tries to clinch with
you, his arms being off guard and
spread out, you have an excellent
chance to uppercut him. Gauge the
distance and the speed of the blow in
such a way as to catch him on what
ever part of his face or body you aim
for, before the rest of his body comes
so close to you as to block the blow.
Again, when a man leads for you
with right or left, guard with which
ever, hand is opposite the arm with
which he leads; and, instead of coun
tering with a straight lead, uppercut
him with the other hand. Be careful,
however, that his free hand is not in
a position to block your blow and to
counter on your. face.
Or, when a man rushes you and you
sidestep, you can uppercut him before
he recovers his balance. These are
but a few of m?.ny cases where the
uppercut can be employed. Tour own
judgment will be your best guide as
to its use.
Other blows and parries will be con
sidered in next Friday's Issue.
LIFE IN THE OPEN.
bica* plateau behind the shoulder of the Himalayas is as
independent of the Chinese Emperor as Korea or Anam.
It is separated from the heart of the empire by a thousand
untrodden miles. The seizure of it by England could
not be considered therefore the first step in the mooted
partition of China.
The diplomatic importance of Great Britain's move in
the direction of Thibet lies in its significance as a coun
ter check upon tlie Russian policy in .Manchuria and* a
possible effective diversion calculated to turn the Musco
vitic eyes away from the prey in the north. "
The delicate game of chess which Russia 'and Britain
have been playing with Persia, Afghanistan and the
khanates of Southern Turkestan as the board is given a
new aspect by this sudden move of the British castle.
Were Russia to gain ascendency over Thibet instead of
her .antagonist she would have China in a vise, the two
jaws of which would be Thibet and Manchuria. . More
over she wouJd then stretch- her length along the entire
northeastern boundary of the coveted Indian empire.
That Russia does not take this little side play by Eng
land in all kindness is indicated by the tone of the
Novoe Vremya of St. Petersburg, which threatens that
if the Thibetans are too weak to stem the tide of the
English over the Himalayas "it is quite possible for
others to do so by creating a slight diversion in some
direction disagreeable to the British politicians." The
safety of India is of course here hinted at as the tender
spot in the British flank. With her hands pretty well
filled by the Manchurian bundle it is not very probable
that Russia will undertake retaliation for the present,
however injured her feelings may be. It looks as if
Britain had her on the hio for the nonce.

glove upward. At the same time lead
a straight left-hander for the face.
_ Keep the knees rigid ar.d the heels
on the ground in the straight 'counter.
By knocking upward your partner's
left glove you leave his face defended
only by his right. If he is quick
enough he can guard your left-hand
counter for his face by throwing his
right arm upward and outward. If
he does so the position is this: Your
right is "inside" his left guard and his
right i? insjide your left guard. There
fore whichever of you is the quicker
may send in a jolt or hook to the jaw
with the hand that is inside the op
ponent's guard, according to the prin
ciples of in -fighting, which I have al
ready explained.
In such a case the advantage usual
ly rests with th*> man who attempted
the straight counter, more especially
if he hsTrti.id the foresight to plan to
use the short-arm blow with the right
in case the left "counter lead'' should
be blocked.
When a man tries to straight coun
ter your left lead, first block hjs left
with your right and then either try
the aforesaid bit of in-fightingr with
your right or else step back out of
reach.
Th* uppercut, which 'I have men
tioned on several occasions, is a pe
culiarly hard blow to give effectively,
and a far harder blow to receive with
equanimity. I have purposely post
poned explaining the '.uppercut until
the present time. Flirt because be
ginner Fhould not try it and second
because I wanted you to learn before

an uppercut should be used.
The uppercut is. as its * name Im
plies, a cut upward. It Is a vertical
suing. In other words, Instead of de
scribing part of a circle from left to
right or from right to left, it takes a
semi-circular coume, directly upward,
starting at about the waist line of the
man who delivers it and traveling to
the jaw, throat or face of its recipient.
The uppercut should always be de

agreements whereby James Dunsmuir
agreed to give Mrs. Dunsmuir $25,000
a year and a half interest in the San

American scout to break up a band of
outlaws on the frontier of Indian Ter
ritory, and Incidentally of the scout's*
conquest of the heart of a charming
Texas heiress, who is coveted by a pol
ished villain leagued with the bandits.
The play is replete with action of the
most stirring kind and curtain calls
were demanded after every sensational
climax. Herschel Mayall made a hand
some, dashing hero, and Eugenie Thais
Lawton a charming heroine.
The hew Tivoli Opera-house, corner
of Eddy and Mason streets, will be
opened Wednesday evening, December
23, with the magnificent holiday spec
tacle "Ixion, or The Wheelman," a
mythological- conglomeration, culled
and congregated by Ferris Hartman.
There will be twenty principals in the
cast and more than 150 people will ap
pear on the stage. There will be five
distinct ballets, all beautifully cos
tumed, and the transformation scene
entitled "Excelsior, or The Triumph of
Light" promises to be an artistic reve
lation. The sale of reserved seats will
begin Thursday morning at the old
Tivoli box office.

excellent a General Kennion as James
Durkln does a Lieutenant Â¦ Hawkes
worth. Besides Miss Adele Block,
whose part gives "full play to all her
talent, Miss Juliet Crosby, after her six
months of retirement, received a hearty
share of the audience's approbation.
The Chinese Six Companies issued a
circular last evening exonerating both
the tongs now at war from complicity
in the assassination of Gee Gum in the
Washington-street Theater late Satur
day night. The shooting evolves a tale
-almost unprecedented. Those who plot
ted the crime relied on daring 'for ac
complishment. The murder was spec
tacular even for Chinatown.
While a play was in progress and
while 500 pairs of eyes were fastened
on the ' :Â¦. stage, a highbinder stepped
out and emptied his revolver in the
direction of Gee Gum. The victim,
who was a musician and who occu
pied a seat immediately behind the
actors, pitched forward, wounded unto
death. Every one present saw the
deed and its recklessness amazed them.
The murderer jumped toward a back
door, through which he had come, and
disappearedjn the network of passages
that. lead to another street.
It seemed strange that none of the
witnesses rhould know the assassin.
All who watched this bit of realism
interjected into .the heathen drama
positively asserted that its perpetrator
was a stranger and that the victim was
a member of no tong. * *
The Six Companies investigated and
found a story of deliberate revenge. A
Chinese lover, /whose affections had
been alienated by the musician, 1 plot
ted that the object of his vengeance
should find ho escape and took him
at a time when he would least be pre
pared for an attack. It appears that
Gee Gum won a woman whose residence
is on Sacramento street. Her forsaken
lover threatened his life and empha
sized his threats so strongly that the
musician took warning and went about
at all times guarded by friends. Then
his enemy resorted to strategy and im
ported a highbinder to do the work.
Where the man came from no one
knows. He had never been seen in
Chinatown before nor has he appeared
since. When he passed up on the stage,
bent, on murder, he was not known
and there was no one to- furnish a clew
as to his identity to the police when
tftey arrived on the scene.'
Fresh as a rose, blithe as a lark, win
some Lulu Glaser last night brought
another town under the witchery *of
her Dolly Varden.. City after city has
capitulated, and last night as much of
San Francisco as could be got into the
Columbia followed suit. It is ten years
since Miss Glaser was here to obsess
the town with 'If you love me, darling,
tell me with your eyes,' and inci
dentally to wile away the center' of
the : stage from Francis Wilson, who
brought her. Miss Glaser is 'ten years
younger since then. In. ten years. more
the philanthroplcally inclined will
probably be sending the Gerry society
after her manager. In the meantime
she .persuades to the righteousness of
another reminiscent Edwards opera,
carries it off in fine triumph.
If Miss Glaser's face was not her for
tune her laugh would be, dot enough.
How shall one describe its luscious gur
gle? It Is like a. lark's song after rain,
like the small boy's laugh when he
isn't found out.' One needs only its
captivating ripple and Mr. Edwards' or
any other opera may go hangâ as Nor
dica sings. But Miss Glaser has much
more to offer. She has a warm, girly
voice that she uses to excellent advan
tage, and the last man in the .gallery!
can hear every word she says and sings.
Then this captivating person can act
with a freshness, vivacity, spontaneity
that makes her DolIy'Varden one of the
cleverest comedy portraits recently
seen here. Add to this a charming face j
and figure and a bewitching repertoire
of gowns, and you have Miss Lulu
Glaser as Dolly Varden.
The part was born for her. Possibly
not by Mr. Stange's faultâ or has he \
the reminiscent habit of Mr. Edwards?
â the librettist's indebtedness to Wych- |
erley in his "The Country Girl" is not j
acknowledged. But the plot is the !
same, Dolly, a lovely country lass un
der the guardianship of a stern old
party who intends _to . marry her and
her "pot of money," comes up to Lon
don. Here, though she walks a&road
caged in a bottomless sedan chair, she
falls in love with a handsome young
London gallant. The story is concerned
with the plotting of the lovers to out
wit the guardian. As in the Wycherley
comedy, a second pair of lovers is in
troduced, and to give Miss Glaser op
portunity to show her angel ones she
has to wear boy's clothes, just as
Peggy does.
From the moment ' the fascinating
ankles that her lover apostrophises, in
lieu of the 1 eyebro,\vs . he^,,has .not yet
seen, appear the stage, is the dainty
comedienne's. They come tripping un
der the sedan chair that her guardian
ingeniously \ uses to hide his country
rose. Then Miss Glaser appears to be
gin a dellghtfultrio in which the guar
dian, the loverâ who loves her for" her
ankles aloneâ and Dolly take part. She
is country girlhood itself, her awkward
ness divine, her giggle an inspiration.
One can believe she has just dropped
j from an apple tree and that she will
soon tumble up another. ; She has a
ridiculous, girlish little sniff that is
adorable, a hoyden walk thai is richly
droll. In all phases of the part she is
found sufficient, whether defying or
coaxing her guardian, making naive
love to Dick or offering to marry any
one so that "she can go to the play."
She. hasn't much in the way of songs,
which is a pity. "The Lay of the Jay"
is the only one in fact. It is good
enough. The. trio in which she first
appears, "Twirling, Whirlinar," is one
of her best numbers. But go to see her. i
Words fall me.
The opera. Mr. Wycherley to be
thanked, has a clear plot and attract
| ive story that falls in excellently with
i the purposes of opera. Some of the j
I musical setting: is distinctly melodious;
I If reminiscentâ better where it is rem-
I inlscent, though one could wish that
"The Holy City" had been pasÂ§ed by
as a source of inspiration. Then there
are also good people for the opera's '
[interpretation besides Miss Glaser.
â¢ There is a sprightly and musical cho
rus, "including j a smart octet of men
that are f up to' "Flbrodora" sextet
standards, and the costumes are of the
_â¢'"'Â¦
The hero, Richard Belleville, is done
by Harry Girard, lean and cQurtly and
effective, but one has to take his tenor
for granted. .John Dunsmuire is good
as Dolly's guardian and has a.prom
ising basso that only balks. at a deep,
deep C. He sings very pleasantly.
Harold Blake has a pretty tenor and
acts well. Lillian Walbridge, the only
woman of importance in the cast be
sides Miss Glaser, is unimportant and
has a trill that 'should be extracted.
Her song, "The Navy," is the best on |
the programme, and Miss Walbridge 1
has a voice that was here prettily used.
There aren't many quotable lines. in

man who marries for money earns it."

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
We'll send yon a sample free upon request.
SCOTT & BOWNE, 409 Pearl Strtet, 21. Y.
There is no secret about
Scott's Emulsion * of Cod
Liver Gil. The label tells
the whole story. There is a
knack in making it. The
only secret about it is the
secret of its. success.
This year, when cod liver
oil is very scarce and hi<*|i,
all kinds of cheap, inferior
oils are used to take its place,
and. all sorts of things pre-
sented as substitutes. Think
of petroleum being taken as
a substitute for cod liver oil !
â too absurd. Think of the
so-called wines, extracts and
cordials of ' cod liver oil !
â^they are simply the shadow
without the substance; no
food value in them.
Scott's Emulsion â " The
Old Reliable " is the same
yesterday, to-day and forever.
â¢ Its quality and purity can
be absolutely depended upon
at all times. \
NO SECRET.

was awakened with the shock which

RIVERSIDE, Dec. 14.â Riverside
County is to have a boodle investiga
tion. The first official cognizance was
taken to-day of charges of boodling in
this county, when Judge J. S. . Noyes
delivered' a supplementary charge to
the Grand , Jury requiring them to
make a full inquiry into the charges of
official misconduct of county officials
regarding contracts for the 'new county
courthouse. In instructing the Grand
Jury Judge Noyes said:
; "If corruption and dishonesty are rife
among the county officials of Riverside
County it is time you should 'know it
and guilty'ones be determined upon re
gardless of expense, however large and
burdensome: In. unison with all right
minded, right-thinking citizens I hope
that you will, after investigation, find
that the charges are unfounded. It is
to be regretted If any officers have so
far forgotten themselves and their
oaths as to pilfer the public funds or

President Thomas- H. Williams and
Vice President Adam Andrew of the
New California Jockey Club returned
yesterday from- Los Angeles, where
they went upon the invitation of offi
cers of the Los Angeles Jockey Club.
Referring, to the fact that complete
harmony will exist between the New
California Jockey Club and the Ascot
Park Association, Mr. Williams said:
"Last May the, Pacific Jockey Club
was formed to have jurisdiction over
racing this side of the Rocky Moun
tains. President Epes Randolph has
been ill. and for that reason went to
Arizona some time ago. John A.
Muir, vice president, intended some
two weeks ago to come to San Fran
cisco to confer with the members of
the Pacific Jockey Club, but was also
suddenly taken ill. W. E. Dunne, a
director of the Los Angeles Jockey
Club, telegraphed me and an appoint
ment was made. He came up here and
consulted with Mr. Andrew and my
self, and then upon his invitation we
visited Los Angeles. The result of our
visit was the election of John A. Muir
and W. E. Dunne as members of the
Pacific Jockey Club. The Ascot Park,'
the Seattle Racing Association and the
New California Jockey Club are now
under the jurisdiction and racing under
the rules of the Pacific Jockey Club."
. Jake Holtman replaced Dick Dwyer
at the starting gate, meeting with
his usual success. Dick will leave for
Los Angeles the latter part of the
week, where he is engaged to wield the
barrier at Ascot Park.

SlKTial Dispatch to The Call,
REDDING, Dec. 14.â James Henry
Coleman, the thirteen-year-old son of
J. H. Coleman, shot at and wounded a
tramp yesterday morning. The tramp
threatened Charles Coleman's life and
was chasing that boy with a hatchet
when James Henry fired both barrels
of a No. 10 shotgun into the miscreant's
legs, stopping his headlong rush and
bloodthirsty designs on the older broth
er. The tramp fell to the ground and
the boys held him covered with guns.
He finally crawled away and has not
been seen since.
The elder boy had gone to a brick
yard to repair a fence. As he arrived
at a cabin on the premises a large and
vigorous tramp stepped to the door
and with curses asked what he wanted.
The boy informed the intruder that he
must leave the cabin. Then the tramp
grabbed a hatchet and started for the
youngster. The boy ran toward the
brick pile where his younger brother
was seated with his shotgun across his
knees.
James Henry was equal to the oc
casion. He jumped to his feet and cov
ering the tramp called out to him to
stop. The tramp did not heed the
warning so James lowered his gun and
fired both barrels. The boys had taken
theirJguns for the purpose of hunting
ducks after they had finished the re
pair work on the fence.
Profitable Begging.
A woman was arraigned for beg
ging and vagrancy in the Essex Mar
ket Police Court in New York a few
weeks ago who had among her be
longings a heavy bundle tied in a
large colored handkerchief, in which
were found over $70 in pennies and
ether small coin, the whole mass
weighing more than fifteen pounds.
This, according to the woman's own
story, she had collected in two weeks,
seated on the curb at a certain cor
ner on the Bowery with a plate in her
lap. And still more interesting was
the disclosure made by a bank book
of savings in Syracuse, X. Y., in her
possession, showing an account to the
woman's credit of over $1000. It ap
peared also that the woman had three
grown-up children living in Syracuse,
v.ho were able to care for her. Yet
po woebegone and poverty stricken
did the woman appear when arraign
ed in court that not until her hoard
ings were disclosed would even a po
lice court shyster take her case. â Les
lie's Weekly.
It appears that the gross business of
the steel trust was 5560,000,000 last
year. There was a product of finished
Bteel of S. 000.000 tons, and of this
1.920,000 tons were rails. Figured at
128 a ton, this amounted to $54,000,
000, and the New York Commercial is
authority- for the statement that the
net profit on steel rails was $23,000,000.
From this it would appear that the
people, of this country have been pay
ing, a big price for steel rails. "But
that is necessary in order to make the
wind and water in the stock good. If
the people like trusts that are water
ed, all they have to do is to keep on
supporting them. â Toledo Bee.
Bis Price for Steel Rails.
That there is much discontent with
work among the so-called middle
classes in America is due in large part
to the pampering of children, to the
supplying of their natural and arti
ficial wants, and to the sentimental
idea that '"their day of toil will -come
soon enough." In general, work . is
not a curse, but a blessing â a positive
means of grace. One can hardly be
gin too early to impress upon children
lessons of self-help by tasks appro
priate to their age and forces, and to
beget In them scorn of idleness and of
dependence on others." To do this is
to make them happy through the self
respect that comes, with jlhe realiza
tion of power, and thus to approxi
mate Tennyson's goal of man: â¢'Self
reverence, self-knowledge, self-con
trol." â Century. ' .^ /^, V.

A Kansas Verdict.
The Kansas juries have been taking
the - humorous papers seriously about
mothers-in-law. In Atchison a young
wife alleged extreme cruelty against
her husband because Jie had main
tained her and his mother in the same
establishment. - As her-complaint-re
lated: "Well knowing, owing to the
peculiarities, of his mother, it would
be impossible. for the plaintiff to live
in the same house with. her, withlany
thiiig like peace and comfort, he'in
sisted on" bringing his mother to live
with them shortly after moving into
their own home, and did so o^er the
protest and objection of the plaintiff;
that. his mother at once assumed ab
solute domination, gave directions to
servants, took control of domestic af
fairs and commenced a series of per
secutions of the plaintiff, .with the re
sult that oh June 21 she fell danger
ously ill from nervous prostration and
for a long time remained at death's
door." She got her verdict. \ It is not,
however, bo bad as the verdict of an
insanity jury in Winfleld: "We find
Mrs. B. insane. Cause, too much
mother-in-law."
Effective Italian Battleships.
' The newest type of "Italian battle
ships are illustrations of what .can be
done with a comparatively small ton
nage. They displace' 12,624.79 tons
and', have engines of 20,000 ' horse
power, which will give them a maxi
mum sped of 22 knots. They are 425
feet long between perpendiculars, 73.3
feet beam' and 25.8 feet draught. The
conning tower is protected by : _?.84
inches of armor, the turrets by 7.87

They will carry twelve-inch and eight

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 14.â At a meet
ing to-nisht of the prime movers of
the Minnesota rooters' excursion to
the California-Minnesota game at San
Francisco on New Year's day and the
representatives of the various Western
roads, it was decided to call off the pro
posed trip owing to the refusal of the
railroads to make lower round trip
rates.
The railroads claim that their West
ern traffic to California during the hol
idays is such that they cannot see
their way clear to lower the present
rate of $105, which appeared exorbitant
to the local football rooters.
PARIS, Dec. 14.â The court which has
been hearing the arguments in the case
of Tod Sloan, the American jockey,
against the French Jockey Club for
$40,000 damages, for being warned off
the turf in connection with Rose de
Maix's winning of the Prix Diane in
Chantilly in May last. to : day found in
favor of Sloan and condemned the
jockey club to pay damages. The court,
while holding that Sloan's complaint
was justified, pointed out that he had
not showed that the course of the club
caused him serious prejudice and lim
ited the damages to the expense of the
action. The case involved the Jockey
club's sole control of the French turf
administration.

Cheltenham.
Even before the "garden city" ha<i
any actual existence outside the inten
tions of philanthropists, Cheltenham,
where next week the National Union of
Women AVorkers holds its annual con
ference, is already in possession of this
proud title. Its gardens. togocher with
Its schools, sufficiently justify the mot
to of the borough, "SalubriMs et Eru
ditio." But its fame for health, and
fashion came from a deeper and a
higher source than its gardens, to wit,
its waters, patronized as they were by
persons so lofty as George III and that
royal exQuisite, the prince regent. Be
tween 1790 and 1830 all the fashion and
beauty of England gravitated to thia
spot, as any may learn In reading th-2
novels of the first half of the nine
teenth century. All this was to no
small discomfiture of the London shop
keepers, who complained that they
heard of nothing but Cheltenham
modes. It had, too, more solid claims
to distinction, for here the Kemblcs
and Mrs. Siddons gained early recogni
tion; Samuel Johnson went there in
1743; it was mlssionized by "Wesley,
Whitefleld and the Countes3 of Hunt
ingdon, who had their influence coun
teracted later by the vlslt3 of Byron.â

Disease in the Mines.
I The profuse use of water spraying in
mines has unfortunately assisted In the
Introduction of a most serious disease
into collieries, viz.: "ankylostomaiasis,"
Avhich is at present mostly confined to
Austrian, German and Hungarian
mines, but has been discovered in some
mines in Cornwall, and also in Austra
lia, where those suffering from the dis
ease are called "earth eaters." Tha
higher the temperature and the greater
the point of saturation the more easily
is the parasite propagated, and there
fore its favorite habitat i3 in the damp
and badly ventilated places. The larvae
can exist in any temperature above 43
degrees F., and have been found on the
higher parts of props and bars, but not
near the floor. Fortunately, the first
accounts are believed to have exagger
ated the danger, and were incorrect in
stating that, the infection could be car
ried through the air, but later investi
gations seem to point out that it can
only be taken in through the mouili,
and, therefore, clean hands and clean
water, when partaking of foods, are ihe
principal safeguards. â Mines and Min

Until recent years, it has been the
misfortune' of the Scotch-Irish to have
escaped historical investigation; for
American history has been written

the Scotch-Irish have been pioneers
and men of action-. They have contrib
uted to America few writers and ar
tists, but 'many generals,' politicians
and captains of industry. In literature
they claim two eminent names, Irving
and Poe; but in the army, navy, poll

Knock-outs and plenty of gore were
seen at the Bay City Athletic Clubs
boxing exhibition last night. There
â¢was a big attendance and the bouts
were enjoyed.
George Sullivan had an easy time
Â¦with Harry Chester, the Olympic Club
boxer. Sullivan was very fat and hit
with his open glove, yet he was able
to land on Chester with incredible
case. Sullivan was awarded a decision
at the end of the fourth round.
Dick Hyland had Jim Kane at his
lÂ»ercy and the humane sergeant of po
lice stopped the unequal contest. Kane
was gcrr.e and did his best, but Hyiand
was too fast and strong for him.
Joe Fountain Knocked out Ed Mar
tin in one round. Jack Moran, a clever
two-handed boxer, put Charles Augus
tus down for the count in the third
round of the battle. Moran showed
he was a finished boxer and had Little
trouble subduing the descendant of the
Caesars. Jack O'Brien was too big
and heavy for Charles Landers and
th<> bout was stopped in the second
round.
The four-round battle between Wil
liam Eagan and Melio Onetto was the
funniest seen here in months. Onetto
was a tall and ungainly Italian, who
took aim before delivering a blow. His
hands were sent in every direction and
he cut wide swaths in the smoky at
mosphere. Eagan was given the de
cision because he was the gamer of
the pair and landed some hard punches.

BOY WOUNDS
VICIOUS TRAMP
LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec. 14.â During
a severe snowstorm on Saturday night
a band of seventy yearlings, quartered
in the pasture at the Elmendorf stud
of J. B. Haggin, stampeded and 'ran
through wire fencing, and five of the
number were so badly cripoled, that
they will have to be destroyed. They
had been reserved by Haggin from this
year's crop for future stud service and
were the get of the best stallions owned
by the famous turfman. The disabling
of the yearlings is a serious loss to
the noted breeding establishment.

Sidney Bender's gelding. Lord Mel
bourne, looked the class of tha starters
in the second seven furlong selling fix
ture and went to the post a pronounced
favorite over Albermarle and Reeves.
Oliphant handled the first choice to
excellent advantage, and gradually
overhauling Reeves in the run home,
won easily. Reeves beat Diderct nearly
three lengths for the place. Albermarle
was left at the post.
If Foley was given orders not to
show up F. E. Shaw, favorite for the
six and a half furlong two-year-old
sprint, he didn't. Quite the contrary
he nearly got him beaten. The St.
Louis rider was busy interfering with
Daly on Dargin all around the stretch
turn, and at the wire only disposed of
Miss Betty by a length. Padua ran a
close third under poor handling after
grabbing one of his quarters. Sol Smith
had a sore mouth and ran as if af
flicted with some ailment.
Little J. Jones landed Rey Dare first
for the closing mile and seventy yard
seHing run. Powell made all the run
ning with Greenock and in a hard drive
lost out by a nose. Silurian, the favor
ite, could not stir up a gallop.
After repeated failures Achilles at
last annexed a purse. The brown St.
Carlo horse was one of ten starters in
the mile and seventy yard selling num
ber and as good as 12 to 1 could be ob
tained about him. The track appeared
just to his liking, for w:th Jed Lewis
up he went to the front and was never
headed. I O U took the place, four
lengths ahead of Cougar. Hian, the
favorite, miserably handled by Kunz,
finished fourth.
Even the threatening weather and a
very moderate card did not deter a
large crowd from attending the open
ing of Ingleside track yesterday. Oak
land track* has its advantage, perhaps,
but after all there is no place like 'home,
and Ingleside. picturesquely nestled aa
it is between the hills and almost with
in sound of the breakers, is pleasing to
the eye and popular with the masses.
The light downpour of rain had left
the track a trifle heavy, but it could
scarcely be termed a muddy one. That
is how some of the "dope" students
were fooled. Moving from one track
to another always causes a paucity of
entries, and the platers had an Inning.
Despite the lack of class three favorites
earned brackets. Â¦
Both Telephone and El Piloto were
passed around as sura winners for the
opening seven-furlong selling event.
Notwithstanding their boom Bill Mas
sie, with Powell up, closed a slight fa
vorite. Telephone showed a flash of
speed, but was early passed by. Bill
Massie, which gelding won by nearly
two lengths. Connell came with a tardy
rush on El Piloto, downing Telephone
for the place. # '
Barney Â£chreiber's Caroburn, ridden
by Johnny Daly, was installed favorite
for the five-furlong scramble for two
year-olds fillies and again disappointed,
finishing third. Bill Waldo made all
the running with Gottlelben, only' to be
collared the final fifty yards and beaten
by Effervescence, the second choice.
Birkenruth rode a very strong finish on
the winner.

If the veto is riot! sustain.-d and the

The ordinance taking the appoint
ment of poundmaster out of the hands
of the Mayor and placing it in â¢ that
of the Board of Supervisors \vns finally
passed' by the board yesterday. The
ordinance will now go to Mayor
Schmitz for his approval ordisapproval.
His Honor made a statement recently
that he would veto the ordinance when
it came to him, as it aimed to dis
possess his appointee, H. O. Irwin, from
the poundmastership.
The Mayor believes that the board
cannot muster the necessary fourteen
votes to override his veto and therefore
his man will continue to serve. The
Mayor cqunts on Supervisory Curtis,
Rea, Wilson, Walsh, Alpera and Bent
to stand â¢ by his veto, the five last
named having voted against final pas
sage of the bill.
The complaint charges that one Fin- ;
ley, an, employe*, was beaten aod badly
injured by the defendants to 'prevent .
him from helping to keep the peace '
and to protect the company's property.
It is charged also that J. E. Kemp Van '
Ee, manager of the mine, had been \
threatened with death if he refused to j
yield to the demands of the strikers. !
The strikers are charged further with '
having wrecked one of the pumps m â¢
the mine and with having uncoupled
another, by reason of which the mine ;
was rapidly filling with water. It is :
alleged further that the drivers of the â¢
company's supply wagons have been
driven away by the strikers. Â¦ â¢ |
It is alleged that $50,000 damage ha3 Â¦
been done already by the strikers â¢d
that unless restricted the mine will br
damaged to the extent of $250,000. j
- -
It is averred that during the month
of November the company discharged
Frank Rochester, whereupon "the mem
bers of the union struck, demanding
the reinstatement of Rochester, an in
crease of wages and a shortening of
the work day. During the present
month the company employed 60 men
in San Francisco to take the places
of the strikers and when 27 of these
men arrived at Milton they were set
upon by the defendants and by men
from the Miners' Union from Angels
Camp, who, by a show of force and
threats of violence, intimidated the
newly hired employes and drove them
away.
It is averred further that at 10
o'clock in the morning the new comers
were forcibly taken x down the railroad
track and ordered to leave immediate
ly and never come back.
The complaint alleges that by rea
son of these and other deeds of vio
lence and threats it is impossible for
the complainant to work Its mines,
and that in pursuance of a conspiracy
a.nd combination men have been pick
eted around the property of the com
plainant by the defendants, some car
rying clubs and rifles with the express
purpose of keeping away all Intending
employes from the mines by force.

United â¢ States Circuit Judge Hanford
yesterday issued a restraining order
against the strikers commanding tfcem
to desist from further Intimidation of
the employes of the company and from
interfering with the property of the
company in any way. They are or
dered aJso ; to appear in the United
States Circuit Court in this city on
January 4, 1904, and show cause, If
any they have, why the injunction
should not be made permanent.
The complaint filed by the mining
company recites that in September,
1903, most of the employes organized
Independence Miners' Union No.- 166
fcr the purpose of coercing the plaintiff
into subjecting its business to the :on
trol of the union and of the defendants
and to employ the members of the
union to the exclusion of all persons
not members cf the said union or elm
ilar unions.
ThÂ« petition cf the United Railroads
for the refund of $35,477 2S paid under
protest for the special tax levy for new
schools and a hospital was referred to
the Judiciary Committee.
Supervisors Comte, Curtis and Eg
eerfc strongly opposed the p'.ar.to lov.-er |
the crade, contending that it would '
damage property. Commissioner of. ;
Works Schmitz stated after the meet- I
jr.g that he had voted to recommend ;
The lowering of the grade, being led
. to believe that the property owners
w*re unanimously in fnvor of it, but \
he had fir.ee learned differently.
The recommendation of Maj-or
Schmitz that a storekeeper-mechanic
be appointed in the Department of
Elections to take care cf all election ;
supplies was referred to the Finance
Committee.
Rev. Father Maximilian, pastor c-f St. '
Boniface Church, said no amount of :
damages would compensate for the
building of iwer.ty-five steps to the
church edifice, which would be ncce?
?:tc.*.ed by the lowering of the grade.
City Engineer Clrur.sky filed a state
ment estimaating that damages in the
sum of $275,000 would result to prop
erty by reason <-f the change. Grunsky
figured thut I'C.OOO front feet would be
benefited cr.d 43,000 front feet damaged.
He fistiired .the bare cost of leveling
the :v o b!ccks. exclusive of the sewer :
arefk. at 535.000.
Ex-Mayor Phelan fallowed with an
argument favoring the lowering of the
grade, in which he argued that it would
redound to the public benefit- E. B.
Mastick. representins Mrs. L. M. Mof
fltt. who owns a five-story building on
Golden Gate avenue, objected to the
charge of grade.
Thomas H. Krjeht filed several pro
tests signed by various property own
en against the grade reduction.
"Of course." said McEnerney, "these
are all small property owners. There
are several millionaires who favor the
proposition, and on that account I sug
geirt that the name of Golden Gate
avenue be chaneed to 'Millionaires'
avenue.' "
<!arret McEnerr.ey, representing the
fathers of St. Boniface Church, ad
dressed the board in opposition to the
proposed change of grades, claiming
that while the large property owners
might b* benefited the small holders
vould not. He stated that the lower
ing of the grade would be detrimental
to the property interests of his clients.
1. What is the district that would be
benefited by th* 3 proposed reduction of
the grade on Golden Gate avenue?
2. What is the probable cost of mak
ing the change including an estimate
of the damapop which may result there
from and the proportion of damages
that would be borne by the various
properties affected?

CHICAGO, Dec. 14. â Three facto

district in* Northern Illinois were shut
down to-day because their employes,
numbering nearly 1500, refused to

hour work day where factory hands
have been getting a full day's pay for
nine hours' work.

The transport Sherman, which is now
due, will probably arrive early this^
morning. She brings the Thirteenth In
fantry, which -will sojourn at the post
for a sufficient time to be equipped
with clothing for the rigorous clime of
the different posts it is assigned to.
The headquarters band and two bat
talions will go to Fort Crook, Nebras
ka: two. companies will go to Fort Lo
gan, Colorado, and the remaining two
companies are ordered to proceed to
Reno, Oklahoma. The two engineer
companies, which are also on the Sher
man,' will go to the Washington, D. C,
barracks.
The first game of the series was
played yesterday with the Tenth In
fantry team as the visitors' opponents
on the grounds of the General Hospital
building. A great crowd of officers and
enlisted men was present and impar
tially cheered the good plays made by
the visitors and the home team. The
score was 20 to 7 in favor of the Tenth.
To-day the visitors will cross bats
with the Ninth Cavalry and to-morrow
they will meet the Thirteenth Infantry.
Later in the week they will tackle the
post team.
Target practice with the big guns
began at the Presidio early' yesterday
morning and was continued until 1
o'clock. This Is the final practice for
the year. Among the officers who went
out to direct operations were Colonel
Morris, the commandant of the post;
Captain W. A. Covington, Major A.
Todd and Major W. E. Birkhimer, the
artillery inspector of the department.
It was very foggy In the early morn
ing and^for a, time it seemed as if the
practice would have to be postponed,
but suddenly the fog lifted sufficiently
to enable bearings to be taken and the
day's work was generally conceded to
be eminently successful.
Lieutenant L. S. Edwards has been
detailed to take charge of the tug and
target during the direct fife batteries
practice, Lieutenant Sypher for the
rapid-fire practice and Lieutenant
Long will have change of the mortar
practice.
The practice will continue during the
week.
Occasionally when one of the big
guns was flred the buildings in the post
shook.' ( :'

"WOODLAND. Dec. 14.â Thomas Hext.
a pioneer of Yolo County, died at his
home near Davlsville Saturday night.
He ccme .to Yolo in 1S54, and had lived
with his brother Richard, who died
about a month ago.
A large landed estate, consisting of
1450 acres of farming land, is left to a
brother and sister in the East. Both
Richard and Thomas Hext were bache
lors. Just nrior to the death of the
former, the latter deeded all the prop
erty to him, thinkinc that he would
survive, as Thomas was then an in
valid and Richard was apparently in
good heaith.
Richard died suddenly Intestate, leav
ing Thomas without property. His
death, however, make3 it all right, as
the property would eventually have
gone to his Eastern heirs in any event.

A little company of hard-working Greek

that their boat, which they had left snugly

had disappeared. The benefit- the thieves may
derive from the boat will lie insignificant com

the fishermen. The boat was fully equipped
and had on board nets and other fishing gear
which, with the craft, represented the united
savings for many months of the owners. The
boat resembled a score of others, Its individ
ualities being visible only to the professional
eye. It was- painted blue and eheathed with
copper. It was 23 feet long and 8 leet beam.

The little tug Txalco. which galled yesterday
for Acajutla, carried no cook. The vessel ie
small and the prospective voyage not unlikely
to be more or lets fraught with peril. Several
cooks were engaged, but on? look at the little
tug eatlxfled them one by one that Idleness
ashore was preferable to full command of
the Tzalco's toy galley. They were willing to
work, but had not lost anything of . ouch
exciting possibilities aa a cruise on the Tzalco
promised. At the last moment It w*Â« decided
to sail without a cook, the four men of the
tug agreeing to divide the cook'a work and
pay among themselves. Captain Frederick

TO ARRIVE.
Two British barks, both overdue, one
of them a 65 per center and heavily
played by local speculators "not to ar
rive," reached their respective destina
tions yesterday. The Talca, out 160
days from Liverpool, and reinsured at
SO per cent, reached Iquique. There was
not much speculation on the Talca, but
on the other overdue that arrived, the
British bark Fifeshire, the play was
very heavy. She was out 130 days
from Manila for New Caledonia, was
quoted at 65 per cent and to the wise
among the reinsurance experts looked
a certain goner. She was played almost
exclusively "not to arrive."
The arrival of these vessels reduces
the overdue list to four, quoted for re
insurance as follows: Paris, 70 per
cent; La Bruyere, 45 per cent; Olive
bank, 15 per cent, and Michele Bianchl,
per cent.
The decision is that reversing the
case of the State vs. William Bonner,
which holds that an information is
sued by a circuit attorney must be
sworn to by prosecuting witnesses in
# the case and that circuit attorneys or
prosecuting attorneys could swear to
information only from personal knowl
edge of the facts.
The case against E. J. Arnold,
charged with grand larceny, was one
of those affected. This case, Â¦which was
called for Monday, will have to go over
to the next term. Eight larceny, bur
gliry and assault cases were similarly
treated.
Folk notified Judge McDonald of the
Criminal Division of the Circuit Court,
and proceedings were stopped in all
cases Effected. Nine cases were wiped
eff the docket and the witnesses sent
to the Grand Jury room, there to give
Information upon which to base in
dictments to take the place of the In
valid informations.

The market for Poultry and Game were lib
erally supplied and continued, rather weak,
although buyers were operating more freely
than at the cloÂ«* of last week. Three cars
of Western stock were marketed and there
were large linen of local ttock offering that
had been carried over from BatUrday. - Tur
keys both live and dressed, were offering in
limited quantities and prices stood about as
previously quoted. Game was abundant and
several kinds were ; quoted lower. The easier
prices, however, tended to Increase the de
mand and the. market was well cleaned up at
the close.

Having recovered from the surpris

tives and friends, began to speculate on
_the identity of his bride and it was not
until the detectives, who were engaged
by his relatives to locate him, had com
pleted their task yesterday that the
identity ' of the . woman was brought
clearly to their minds. ; In the woman
found in Clarke's rooms at the Lick

than that familiar figure in the famous
Durfant trial, the . "Sweet Pea Girl,"
who daily sat in the, courtroom near the
murderer of Blanche. Lamont and Min

accused: testimonials" of her sympathy,
in the shape of small bunches of sweet
peas..

that eventful trial that ended in the
hanging of Durrant has been filled with
varied -experiences.-includlng her mar

to the corridor, whence It was later
taken to an uptown hotel. . \
"This is all the result of a man's fool

party had reached the lower. floor of the

who is a well-known club man and
son of a wealthy widow of San Jose,
suddenly found himself surrounded by
relatives, friends and detectives, who
hustled him out of his apartments at
the hotel. Later they returned. for 4 the
husband's belongings, but this time en
countered the bride, who, learning of
their plans to separate her from Clarke,
defiantly declined to permit his prop
erty to be removed. Again the friends
departed, but soon returned, this, time
with the husband. Confronted by the
latter, the wife urgently appealed- to
Clarke to assert himself and shake oft
the influences vhich she charged', were
being exerted over him. Finding that
he was indifferent to her pleadings
was about to desert her, the woman be
came hysterical and while her 3obs :
re-echoed through the rooms, Clarke,

slightest word of farewell, left her.
RELATIVES TO THE RESCUE.
A sensational scene, marking " the
abrupt termination of the honeymoon
that followed the secret marriage in
Oakland at an unusual hour Saturday
morning of E. K. Clarke and Mrs.
Rosalind Bower, who turns out to be
the "Sweet Pea Girl" of Durrant trial
fame, was enacted at the Lick House
yesterday afternoon. ..During the tem
porary absence of his bride, Clarke,

man, returned from the East yester
day and is registered at the Palace.

PERSONAL.
The secret marriage in Oakland Sat
urday was Clarke's second experience
in the matrimonial line, he having
wedded several years ago under simi
lar circumstances. His first wife died
abotlt a year ago and since then
Clarke, who is about 40 years of age,
has been abroad a great deal. Drink
ing has been his greatest vice, a fact
which his relatives, who are prominent
in this city, readily admit. From his
father, who died a number of years
ago, Clarke inherited a fortune of
something like $500,000, and to what
still remains of this will some" day be
added many thousands of dollars now
controlled by his mother.
HIS SECOND MARRIAGE.
"I understand that Clarke has since
made the claim that he was intoxi
cated at the time of his marriage and
did not know what he was doing. If
this is so he showed no signs of it at
the time the ceremony was L per
formed. I do not see how he could
have been greatly under the influence
of liquor, as they had been hunting
for Baker for four hours before the
ceremony. At any rate, when he came
to my house his speech was perfectly
clear and straight, and while there
was a slight taint of liquor on his
breath, he did not show in any way
that he was not thoroughly In posses
sion of all his faculties. Had he not
been able to satisfy me that he knew
perfectly well what he was doing I
shouid not have performed the mar
riage ceremony.
"The marriage toc-k place about 12:20
on the morning of the 12th, and they
requested me to "send the certificate to
Mrs. E. K. Clarke, rooms 407 and 408,
Starr King building, 121 Geary street,
San Francisco. I filed the certificate
on the 12th, had ~it recorded immedi
ately and mailed it to Mrs. Clarke on
the samenlay." . â¢i^-r.
"Just before the couple stood up
Clarke placed his hand on a necklace
the lady wore and said, 'That is a
present I brought from Naples.'
"After the ceremony Clarke asked
me to put on my hat and join them in
a banquet in celebration of the event,
but I excused myself on a plea of ill
ness and they immediately left, accom
panied by Ray Baker and Mr. Robin
son, v
HIS BRIDAL PRESENT.
"He told her there was a couple below
who wished me to perform a marriage
ceremony. I had heard the conversa
tion at the door and dressed hurriedly
and came downstairs. I found Clarke
and the lady in the parlor, and with
them were Ray Baker and Francis IT.
Robinson of San Francisco. I make it
a rule to ask every one whom I marry
a few questions in regard to the names
in the license, for instance, if they are
the parties specified and so forth, and
to also ask them if they fully realize
the importance of the step which they
are about to take. In the present in
stance I arlied these questions and they
were answered readily and without any
hesitation, and I proceeded to perform
the ceremony. . Â£<â¢?"â¢ ':
couple in question I had been slightly
ill from heart trouble and had retired
early. Abou*t 12 o'clock the doorbell
rang and my wife answered and found
Deputy County Clerk Raymond T.
Baker at the door.
; The statement wired from Topeka,
Kans., a few days ago to the effect that
the purchase of the North Shore by
the Santa Fc was ratified at tlie annual
meeting of the directors of the latter
company caused much comment. The
statement was misleading-. The pur
chase ratified was that of a branch road
in the .edwood region of California. It
may transpire later on that the syndi
cate which is now paying face value
nnd accrued interest for the bonds of
the North Shore was authorized to act
for the Santa Fe. The fact will be
recalled that the purchase of the
Crocker, Stanford and Searles holdings
of Southern Pacific stock was conduct
ed through the agency of Silver & Co.
<>f New York, and a controlling interest
in the road acquired before the names
of the real purchasers were made
known to the public.
Negotiations for the purchase of the
North Shore Railroad are b^ing con
ducted through the agency of the Mer
cantile Trust of this .city.
When John Martin was in New York
recently he was solicited by the rep
resentative of an Eastern syndicate to
obtain an option on the purchase of a
large block ' of the company's bonds.
The syndicate agreed to take the bonds
at par and pay accrued interest. As
an evidence of good faith the syndicate
deposits $30,000 for each $100,000 of
bonds placed in the possession of the
trust company. It is understood that
bonds to the par value of one million
dollars will be deposited this week, as
agreements representing that amount
have been signed. The option, how
ever, does not expire until June 1 next.
It is regarded as absolutely settled that
all negotiations for the transfer of the
property to the new owners will be
closed up long before the expiration of
the time prescribed in the option.
There is considerable conjecture in
railway and banking circles concerning
the actual purchaser of the road. The
report that the Santa Fe is the power
behind the syndicate is strenuously
denied, honce it is surmised that the
Southern Pacific is taking steps to ac
quire the road.
stituted to annul the marriage and this
announcement brought a prompt re
sponse from Mrs. Clarke's logal rep
resentative, Attorney O. K. " Cushlng,
that any proceedings toward this end
would be fought by him.
Rev. William N. Van de Mark, who
married Edward K. Clark'e and Rosa
lind ' H. Bower in Oakland, said last
night:
"On the evening that I married the
open for business as soon as they could
get in their supplies if the crews were
put back in the places named.
Both 1 sides will hold meetings 1 this
morning and discuss the suggestions of
fered by th'e committee and will imme
diately take action. There is every
probability that the lockout will" be
called off to-day and the restaurants
reopen for business.
The association and the two unions
will t,hen take hip the agreement sent
out by the cooks and waiters and come
to an , understanding. The association
is opposed to the plan of the unions to
ignore It, and its members will demand
that a clause be inserted giving it
proper recognition. The association is
further opposed to certain houses being
permitted to hire non-union help. The
members want- one agreement for all
restaurant-keepers.
Whether there is a compromise or not
F. Krone, proprietor of the Popular
restaurant, on Geary street, will reopen
(or business this morning. He pasted
a sign on his- window yesterday that
read as follows: .
"Open \ to-morrow at 6 a. m. as an
open house. No discrimination among
labor, either union or non-union. Union
hands, union one day off .a week.
I will sign no agreement of any labor
organization. All help being treated
with courtesy, as before; but I am cap
tain of the ship. F. KRONE."
The first and only conference between
the Restaurant-Keepers' Association
and the waiters' and cooks' unions was
held -last evening at 20 Eddy street.
Four representatives of the unions met
M. Johnson, chairman of the executive
committee of the association, and two
hours were occupied. in deliberation. A
stenographer took -down everything,
and the transcription of his shorthand
notes will be filed among the records of
the association.- Â¦-
At the conclusion of the meeting Mr.
Johnson expressed the belief that by
this afternoon the two crews taken out
of the Central dining-rooms, on Ellis
street, and the Tivoli cafe, on Eddy
street, will be put back and both these
houses will resume business. Mr. John
son intimated that no negotiations
would be entered into regarding the
agreement tor the coming year until
the two places were permitted to re
sume business. He further stated that
the restaurants that had closed under
the orders of .the association would re-
In the ensuing discussion the pro
tagonists of the resolutions were led by
Charles Bundschu, and among his ac
tive supporters were Dr. G. Dresel, Max
Solomon, David Hirschfeld and Henry
Epstein. The opposition*included Dr.
Jellinek, Attorney Gutsch, E. C. Prie
ber and Theodore Pinther. The debate
developed no new features, most of the
arguments being repetitions of those
advanced at the previous meeting.
It was 11:10 o'clock when the talking
on the resolutions ceased and a vote
was ordered on the first section of Mr.
Bundschu's resolutions. It resulted in*
eighty-four of the members declaring
for rescission of the action of the pre
vious meeting In regard to a new hos
pital, while seventy-three of those pres
ent voted to let that action stand.
Then, on motion of Mr. Bundschu,
consideration of the remaining three
sections of his resolutions was contin
ued till after the holidays.
A. That these peven members shall constitute
the bniidlnir committee, and all vacancies shall
be filled from amonsr the former presidents.
ARGUMENTS REPEATED. -
:t. That this bulldinr committee shall be
composed of three members of the presetit
v>carrl of directors and four others to be chosen
by the members of the society from nmonsr the
rx-pr?Bidents of the society living in San Fran
cisco, to r*Â» encsen at the next regular meeting
of the society.
2. That for the purpose of acquiring new
hospital plans it be understood that the cost of
the building shall be limited to $250,000 and
th<; equipment to $50,000. and that a building
oommittes be appointed to take charge of the
mntter.
Th<* special meeting: of the German General
Benevolent Society called by the president-tor
December 14, ISHaI. for the purpose of consid
ering a new hospital, resolves:
1. That thf> resolution adopted at the meet
in? in October in reference to the hospital be
reprinted as a whole.
Charles Bundschu then presented the
following resolutions and moved for
their adoption:
PKGSEXTS RESOLUTIONS.
By a vote of 84 to 73 the German
General Benevolent Society at a special
meeting last night rescinded the reso
lution adopted at its last quarterly
meeting, held in October, by which it
was decided to erect a new hospital
at an approximate cost of $500,000. The
gathering last night was In Union
Square Hall, and for three and a half
hours the subject was discussed in all
its bearings freely and amicably.
President Grunsky opened the pro
ceedings by reading a statement show
ing that at the October meeting it had
been resolved to construct a new hos
pital on the site of the existing struct
ure, to consist of a central building and
two wings, one of the latter to be built
first, then the other wing, and last of
all the central building, m the mean
time the existing hospital to be torn
down piecemeal as the construction of
the new one required. The entire new
building was to cost $500,000, and its
construction was expected to cover a
period of about ten years. The total
capacity was to be 288 beds. Plans for.
the building had been drawn by Mr.
Grunsky, and the board of directors
had authorized immediate commence
ment of work by appropriating the
$90,000 on hand to that purpose and
deciding: to borrow $50,000 a/klitional.
The president concluded his explana
tion by stating that in response to a
petition from a number of the members
he had called the meeting last night
to reconsider the action taken in Octo
ber..
