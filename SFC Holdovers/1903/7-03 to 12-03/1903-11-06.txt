Division Superintendent W. 8. Palmer
said: "As the matter has been reported
to me the switch engine crew Is entirely
to blame. The Alameda local was pro
tected by a 'danger 1 signal set behindÂ«the
train as It stopped at Peralta street. It
was set against all trains on" that "track

in all likelihood that the engineer .thought

was not observing the signals."

Half a dexea passengers were hurt,
raauay more were severely shaken, and one
cwltchxa&n was severely injured In a
train collision in West Oakland last night
The accident was at the foot of Peralta
ctreet, beinz the collision of a switching
train and the Alameda local passenger
train, broad gauge, connecting with the
30:25 o'clock boat frcm San Francisco.
That at least three passengers on the
local were not instantly killed is almost
a miracle. Those three are E. C. Leffing
well, vice president of the San Francisco
Press Club; Paul Kellcgff of the Alameda
Transfer Company and James Rue of tne
.lohnson-Lccke Mercantile Company of
Har. Franciscc. -They were seated In the
last seat of the rear car, a combination
smoker end bag'page car, when the colli
sion occurred. A loaded meat refrigera
tor car was 1-urled ag-alnst the local train
with a force that telescoped the freight
car half way into the passenger coach,
the impact throwing the passengers from
their seats, burying them in a confusion
of splintered wood, iron work and debris.
On top cf the meat car was Switchman
Joe Lazelle, who was caught in the mess
and pinned beneath the wreckage. He was
badly crushed about the chest. The ter
rific impact tore seats in the passenger
coaches from their plnnir.gs ar.d jammed
passengers ir.to corners, wrenching,
bruising and cuttirg many of them. So
heavy was the violent shock that the car
couplings snapped like thread, a hole was
punched in the locomotive and the rear
truck of the smoker over which the three
passengers sat vas torn from, the car
bofiy and hurled forty feet away.
MANY WERE HURT.
In the emoker were about twenty pas
sengers. Arnor.g others hurt was L. A.
Lauenstein, residing at 21C2 Santa Clara
avenue. Alameda. whose left knee was
badly Jammed. In the first of the three
coaches was Mrs. E. Smith, residing at
l'5O5 Central avenue, who was thrown
forward by the shock, sustaining in
juries to her back. Mrs. J. M. Reynold,
2 GO 8 Central avenue, Alameda, also in
the first coach, was bruised. Walter
Story, residing at 2328 Clement avenue,
â¢n-.is riding in the middle car. He was
slightly brulsrd, but got out to the as
sistance of the Injured. Story assisted
In clearing away the wreck and remov
ing Switchman Lazelle. As soon as the
collision occurred word was sf-nt to Oak
land pier, and a wrecking train went to
the scene, clearing away the debris,
while another train was made up to take
the Alameda people to their destina
tion. There is no conflict in the various
stories cf the wreck as to the happen
ings, although the switch engine crew
and the Alameda men report differently
as to the cause. The Alameda local left
Oakland pier on time, in charge of Con
ductor Harry Edwards and Engineer Al
Wright. They ran through the mole and
the yards as far as Peralta-street
switch-house. There the train, under or
ders, slowed down for the conductor to
deliver the way bills for the yard
freight department, a practice of nightly
occurrence. The train had stopped for a
minute and had Just started to continue
:ts east-bound Journey when the crash
came. Behind the Alameda local on the
same track was a switch engine, 1108,
Engineer Whistler in charge,, pushing
ahf-ad of it refrigerator cars loaded with
beeves to be run up to a spur track at
First end Market streets.
DID NOT SEE TRAIN.
According to the switch train people,
they did not see the Alameda local be
cause, they claim, the tail end signal
lights were not burning.'. This is denied
by the passenger crew, who reported the
accident to Division Superintendent Pal
mer's office. On their behalf it was as
f-erttd by Division Superintendent Palmer
that the switch engine crew was wholly
at fault; that they "ran o~cr" -a set auto
matic biock pignal switch at "danger."
Â¦Web should have protected the Alameda
iocal while it was Inside the block limits

NEW TORK, Nov. 5.â In an afternoon
newspaper to-day was published what
purported to be an account of the mar
riage of Multi-millionaire Robert Goelet,
son of Mrs. Ogden Goelet, to Miss Eleanor
Anderson, u telegrapher in the Grand Ho
tel, and daughter of William' Anderson, a
restaurant keeper at 745 Sixth avenue.
Robert Goelet is a brother of Miss May
Goelet. who is to marry the Duke of Rox
burghe on Tuesday next.
To all statements made in this article
Goelet made denial in the presence of
George G. Dewitt, representative of tfie
Goelet family. This denial, Goelet and
his companions wished It understood, ap
plies with equal force to Goelet's cousin,
Robert Ogden Goelet. Goelet was shown
a photograph of Miss Eleanor Anderson,
who had been represented to be his bride,
and without any equivocation said, that
he did not know the young woman, and,'
so far as he knew, never had seen her
features before.
If Miss Anderson has been married to
a man of the name of Robert Goelet, her
husband Is In no way related to the Goe
let family in this city, Goelet said.
Thar* Eleanor Anderson, who until Mon
day was telegraph operator in the Grand
Hotel, expected to be married to-day
there can be no doubt. She had told her
friends about it and some one in her be
half evidently called at the Catholic Ca
thedral on Wednesday to make arrange
ments for the ceremony. Many of Miss
Anderson's particular friends and some
of her neighbors in West Fifty-first
street, where she lives with her parents,
believed that the bridegroom was to be
Robert Goelet.
Father McCue, rector of the Church
of the Sacred Heart of Jesus., in West
Fifty-firsi street, was led by some one to.
believe that the bridegroom-to-be was
Robert Goelet The Andersons are parish
ioners of Father McCue.
The reverend father said:
'I became aware of the contemplated
I marriage between Robert Goelet and
! Miss Anderson this evejiing, although I
cannot give you the source of my infor
mation. However. I do not think the
ceremony has been performed, because
no outside priest would officiate without
first consulting those in this parish."
meir clothes torn from thejr backs and
were cut and bruised from head to feet.
In describing the scene Lefflngwell said:
"We three occupied the last seat In the
smoker. I was on the way to Mr. Kel
logg'e residence at 2115 Eagle avenue, Ala
meda, as his guest. Mr. Rue was bound
to his home at 2115 Clement avenue. Just
before the crash we heard a great toot-
Ing of whistles, and one of us saidj
'There's a train passing.' But It was not
passing. In a second afterward there was
a sudden darkening of the car, a roar
and we were thrown In a heap beneath
what seemed to be an inextricable mass
of wreckage. The Beats we occupied were
torn from their fastenings. A heavy fire
extinguisher hit me in the back. Our gar
ments were In r.ibbons. Out of It all we
managed to scramble and then to' survey
the scene. The big refrigerator car had
telescoped half of the passenger coach
and hunc there a mere shell.
CRASH WAS VIOLENT.
"People piled out of the train, which
was quickly stopped, as It was barely
moving when the collision occurred. In
every coach and even on the engine there
were evidences of the violent impact by
the wrenched seats and torn out coup
lings. For the life of me I can't under
stand how we three men 'escaped more
serious injury."
After two Pullman coaches were made
up the delayed Alamedans were taken
home.
George Stack, a switchman on the re
frigerator car, assisted in getting Switch
man Lazelle out of the wreck. He said
the first he knew of an accident was
when the crash came, and it threw him
off the rear end of the meat car. but did
not hurt him. Stack knew Lazelle was at
the forward end of the car and as soon
as Stack could recover himself he ran
to his fellow workman's relief. Stack
said he did not know what caused the
wreck. Lazelle said he had just caught
a glimpse of the end of the. train when
the smash came. He was removed to his
residence, 1774 Tonth street.

LONDON, Nov. 5.â A new treatment of
cancer, which is believed to mark an im
portant advance, was explained last night
before the meeting of the Abernethian
Society of St. Bartholomew's Hospital by
Dr. Jesse Johnson, a London physician,
who has been examining the methods em
ployed by Dr. Otto Schmidt of Cologne.
"Dr. Schmidt's opinion," said Dr. John
son, "is that cancer is conditional on the
presence in the patient of the cancer pa
rasite, which produces a structural change
in the cells of the part affected. There
has been no difficulty in finding the para
sites associated with cancer. Geyford in
America. Pllmmer in this country and
Schuler all have discovered and very fully
described a comparatively large number
of these parasttes.
"The difficulty has been to decide what
if any of them is the cause of cancer.
Dr. Schmidt believes he has isolated the
specific parasite. His explanation of the
number of parasites associated with can
cer is that they are one and the same,
varying in shape and appearance under
different conditions. By altering the con
ditions, Dr. Schmidt says, his parasite
assumes all of the different appearances
which have led to Its being described by
other searchers as several parasites.
"With this parasite Dr. Schmidt has
done two thingsâ he seems to have Bter
llized it with liquid air and he has in
jected it into animals and developed a
serum which has the power of destroy
ing cancer cells."
Dr. Johnson described In detail the ef
fects of these injections upon various pa
tients. One was a woman who had un
dergone no fewer than six operations for
the removal of a cancer of the breast.
She had also a malignant growth on the
forehead, which it was 'considered quite'
hopeless to attempt to remove. As a re
sult of Dr. Schmidt's treatment by in
jections there was a great gain in the
patient's general health and the growth
on the forehead shrank to a mere scar.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 5.â The Board of Su

bonds recently voted by the Imperial
school department, and a new election
will have to be held If valid bonds are to
be created. On September 23 the election
at which these bonds were voted was
held, and $6000 for a new school building
was the result. It has been discovered,
however, that the election was invalid
by reason of the fact that the polls were
advertised to be open from 1 a, m. to sun

SUPERVISORS REFUSE
TO APPROVE THE BONDS
Hurley notified the police by telephone
as soon as he collected h!s scattered
senses. Detectives' Regan and Taylor
were immediately detailed on the case,
but as the robbers left absolutely no clew
behind them the officers have but little
hope of rounding them up.
The two masked men who, terrorized
the residents of the city a few months
ago have resumed operations again. Last
night about 11 o'clock the bold pair
stealthily entered the grocery and saloon
conducted by J. T. Hurley at Hayes and
Webster streets. They held Hurley and
a customer, J. L. Hanna, at bay at the
points of two revolvers, and after se
curing $165 in cash left the place and
disappeared in the darkness.
Hurley gives a vivid description of the
daring hold-up. He says he was sitting
in the barroom of his place at about 11:15
o'clock, talking to Hanna, when suddenly
the side doors of the barroom swung
open and two men appeared In the door
way, each wearing a large white maalc
and each armed with a revolver.
One was tall and slender and the other
short and stocky. The taller of the two,
who acted as spokesman, in a low tone
said, "You two fellows stand up against
the wall there, and if you make a move
or say a word I will fill you full of lead."
Hurley and Hanna did as they wera
commanded and, while the tall man
covered them with his pistol, his com
panion opened the till behind the bar and
took all that It contained. $5 in silver.
Then he went into the adjoining store and
rifled the till there of J7.
When the short man had finished Â¦with
the tills Hurley and Hanna were tald to
throw up their hands. The short burglar
went through their pockets and toot J153
in gold and silver from Hurley. The
burglars went through Hanna's pockets,
but he had no money on his person.
Both Hurley and Hanna wore gold
watches, but the burglars ignored the
timepieces. With a few final words of
caution the masked pair backed out the
place, keeping Hurley and Hanna covered
as they went, and disappeared In the
darkness.

THE SAN TBAKCJSCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1 6. 1903.
Â¦WASHINGTON. Nov. 6.â Th- President has
accepted the tpslcnntion of O. P. Shiras. Judge
of the Federal Court of the northern district of
Iowa, to take effect on November 1.
However, the Senate Finance Committee
will meet to-morrow and some definite
programme may be formulated.
The special committee appointed by the
Senate at the last session to prepare a
financial bill to be submitted for consid
eration of the fifty-eighth session of Con
gress has not prepared a draft of Its ideas
and Senator Allison said to-nijrht that
he did not look for much financial legis
lation.
Senators Allison, Aldrich, SDooner and
Platt of Connecticut arrived in Washing
ton to-night and immediately went Into
conference In Senator Allison's apart
ments at the Arlington Hotel. At the
conclusion Senator Allison said he be
lieved the Cuban treaty would be made
operative by joint resolution. He cited
the method adopted by Congress In rela
tion to the Mexican treaty as a precedent.
FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
This afternoon Representatives Payne,
Hemingway, Deselle, Tawney and Mann
conferred with Cannon on the form of
the proposed Cuban legislation. Later
Cannon said the question would be de
termined by the Ways and Means Com
mlttf ?. Payne, who Is to be chairman of
that" committee, said he could make no
definite statement about the form of the
legislation until he had consulted all the
members of the committee, but it was
his opinion that the measure, in form,
would be a bill rather than a resolution,
as he did not see how the House could
do otherwise.
The Finance Committee, which will meet
to-morrow, will take up the subject of
the form of legislation necessary to carry
the treaty Into effect. Generally the Sen
ators believe that a simple resolution of
approval will be all that Is necessary,
but some Senators, notably Teller of Colo
rado, believe that If approval is attempted
in any such form it will raise a constitu
tional auestion which will cause a long
debate" in the Senate. Teller expects that
the whole tariff question will be opened
for discussion by the Cuban measure and
that It will be well into the regular ses-
Slon before action in the matter Is taken
by the Senate.
HOTJSE MEMBERS CONFER.
Tawney contends that to approve the
treaty by a simple resolution would be
void and asserts that the sugar provision
of the treaty is nothing more than a
pledge of the good faith of the Govern
ment that the duties on sugar shall not
be changed during the life of the treaty.
Any tariff bill, he contends, can abrogate
this provision of the treaty or the treaty
itself.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6.â There were
some Interesting developments to-day as
to the method of Congressional procedure
on the Cuban reciprocity treaty. That
treaty was amended by the Senate adding
the words "this treaty shall not take
effect until the same shall have been ap
proved by the Congress."
It has been generally supposed that a
joint resolution or a bill approving the
treaty would be all that was necessary,
but members of the House and some Sen
ators take an entirely different view.
They say that a bill must be Dassed re
ducing the duty on the products of Cuba
and that every provisipn affecting duties
must be enacted into legislation.
Representative Tawney of Minnesota,
who was leader of the Republican minor
ity that opposed the reciprocity bill In
the last Congress, said to-day that the
provision requiring Congressional ap
proval, when inserted In the treaty, was
known by him to be defective and open
to objections. The treaty of 1S34 with
Great Britain for reciprocity with Canada
and the treaty of 1S7S with Hawaii, he
added, both contained a provision at the
very beginning stating that when suitable
legislation was enacted by Congress to
carry out the provisions of the treaties
the President should Issue a proclamation
announcing the fact and the treaty there
upon should become effective. Both of
these treaties were followed by legislation
in the form of a bill reciting the articles
that were .to be admitted duty free.

NEW* YORK, Nov. 5.â The most inter

Colonel McClellan was considering the
appointing of General Nelson A. Miles
as Police Commissioner. General Miles
recently retired as lieutenant general of
the United States army. Some Democrats
have talked of alleged snubs received by
him from the administration. It was
said that it would be good politics to
,make him Police Commissioner, as he is
a. regular army man, a Democrat, inde
pendent and of high merit.
It is said that Miles now makes his
home here. This could not be confirmed,
but General Miles' was one of the first to
send McClellan a telegram of congratula

not the turbulent internal affairs of Colombia shall be allowed to
interfere with the building of the Panama canal, which will mark
an epoch in commercial history and change the commercial map
of the world. Should the situation created by the revolution give
promise of permanence by the time Congress meets in extra ses
sion next week, the President will call its attention to the con-,
ditions there prevailing and ask for action as to the recognition
of the new State.
"It is not deemed likely, however, that the revolutionary
government, which is accorded practical recognition as 'de facto'
by the Washington Government now, will have by that time those
elements of stability required for recognition as a power.
"In his communication to Congress, which will, of course, be
preceded by a preliminary conference with Senate and House
leaders, the President also will throw back upon Congress the
decision as to the route for an interoceanic canal. Should' he'
be directed by Congress to turn to the Nicaragua route there
would, of course, no longer be reason for thought of the con
struction of the Panama canal by force."
Such is the administration position, as outlined in no weak
language by two high administration officials to-day. The dip
. lomatic representatives of nearly all European and several South
American countries, including Dr. Herran, the Colombian Charge
called upon Secretary Hay this morning, and, with the exception
of the latter, it was said at the State Department most of them
expressed the belief that the tendency on the part of the United
States to recognize the new republic met with general approval
It was after these diplomats had left that the first frank state
ment of the intention of the United States .was forthcoming.
American commanders and Consuls are instructed to keep the'
revolutionists and Government troops apart and to use good of
fices to restore peace.
One important possibility is that the Colombian Government,
frightened by the prospects of the successful secession by Pan
ama, will offer to reopen the canal negotiations on a reasonable
basis.
The formal notification of the establishment of the republic
of Panama, received by Secretary Hay to-day, is signed by Fred
erico Boyd, Tomas Arias and Jose Augustine Aningo, executive
committee- of the provisional government of the new republic
They invite Secretary Hay's attention to the fact that in re
sponse to a spontaneous and universal sentiment a provisional
government was organized and proclaimed on. November 3, with
themselves as .the executive committee, and that they have a mil
itary force to maintain the government. They do not ask for rec
ognition. They will do this later. The State Department has
not yet answered this letter of notification. In what manner it will
.do so- is not decided. The revolutionary government receives in
formal recognition, however, from the American naval command
ers and Consuls. ; ,'r,
The Dixie, with 325 marines aboard, is expected to arrive at
Colon to-night and the Atlanta probably will reach there some
time to-morrow, when the Boston also is expected at Panama.
If necessary, the forces on the isthmus wilt be augmented next
week by a contingent of 300 marines from the League Island
navy-yard, Philadelphia.

LONDON, Nov. 5.â The British officials'
attitude toward the events at Panama is
that it is entirely the United States' af
fair. This, with the consequent compara
tive apathy, appears to be shared in all
diplomatic quarters In London. Except in
the unlikely possibility of â¢ some outside
interference no action Is contemplated by
the British. Upon request of the. British
diplomatic or consular representative in
the disturbed region , a war vessel would
be sent to protect the rights of subjects
of Great Britain, but such a request
â¢would not be encouraged, ' as Downing
street Is of the opinion that the force the
United States " is sending to the isthmus
is more than sufficient to maintain the
safety of the foreign residents.

ama's independence entirely depends upca

PANAMA, Nov. 5. â The revolutionary
junta last night issued- a manifesto ad
dresed to the citizens of .the republic
of Panama, saying that the inhabitants
of the isthmus had done what was inevit
able In view of a situation which was be
coming graver dally. It was pointed out
that, notwithstanding the grievances in
flicted on the isthmus by* their Colom
bian brothers, the former had suffered
with resignation for the sake of harmony;
and the union. Under the late system of
Colombian government the Inhabitants
of the isthmus had been governed with
the narrow-mindedness ' which in days
gone by had been applied to American
colonies by the powers of Europe.
The manifesto then refers to the fact
that the isthmus of Panama paid Co
! lombia large sums in customs duties, add
ing that while the junta did not wish in
this exposition of facts, which .would be
handed down to posterity, to be regarded
as being moved toy a mercenary spirit,
nevertheless it was but just to point out
that in spite of the large sums of money
collected from the isthmus for fiscal pur
poses the latter had not received the^ben
eflt of even a bridge over any of its
rivers; the construction of a single road
between any of the towns of the Isthmus;
'the erection of any public buildings; the
establishment of a Single college, or any
Other step tending to advance the indus
tries or intellectual development of
Panama, as not even the most infinitesi
mal part of the large sums collected had
been applied toward benefiting Panama In
any shape or form.
The failure of the Hay-Herran canal
treaty to meet with the approval of the
Congress at Bogota Is then touched upon.
It is pointed out that only a few public
men were opposed to the treaty, and that
their opposition was due to the fact that
it was alleged that Panama would be the
only part of the country which wclild re
ceive direct .benefits from the building ot
an interoceanic canal. The manifesto
then continued:
"The people of- the isthmus, in view of
this notorious situation, have decided to
recover their sovereignty in order to work
out their own destiny and to insure the
future of Panama in a manner in keep-
Ing with the evident destiny of the coun
try, Its vast â¢ territory and immense
riches."

. CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. 5.â There Is
great public interest here in the Panama
revolution, and the undercurrent of talk
in Clerical party circles, where Colombia
is regarded as in sympathy with the
Clerical party programme, is that the
American authorities are the secret pro
moters df this disturbance and are plan
ning to seize the Panama region and an
nex it to the United States.
It is officially stated here that the only
desire of Germany is to see peace pre-
Berved and to have the United States
build the interoceanic canal, which
would benefit German commerce. Ger
many looks to the United States to pro
tect the Germans on the isthmus.
The theory as to the cause of the revo
lution which is currently accepted here is
that the United States brought it about
with the object of building the inter
oceanic canal.
What role the Washington Government played
in the incidents in Colombia nobody can know.
Nothing can be proved in such cases. It has
been formally denied from Washington that the
Government of the United States supported the
movement for the separation of the isthmus.
However that may be, it is not striking, nor
does it give occasion for special excitement,
that a great, mighty state will not permit
Itself to be thwarted in its civilizing work
through the Etubbornness of a land three
fourths barbarous.
BERLIN, Nov. 5. â Responsible opinion
In Germany regarding Panama Is plainly
expressed as well in the following, in the
Frankfurter Zeitung, as in any news
paper:
Berlin Government, However, Will
Follow United States' Lead.
GERMANY SUSPECTS AMERICA.
If the United States will keep her hands off,
Colombia, will have no difficulty In suppressing
the insurrection and maintaining: her sover
eignty over the Isthmus. I can understand
why various interests are anxious for the In
dependence of Panama, but the Government
has regular troops at Colon and they will vin
dicate her authority if the United States does
not place any obstacles in the way.
Senator Pasado, the Colombian Consul
here, said to-day that the conditions at
Panama gave France no right to inter
vene. He added:
The feeling Is growing In French offi
cial quarters that the revolution at
Panama is likely to result beneficially for
the canal. It is pointed out that while
Colombia obstructed the treaty the
shares of the French canal company de
nreclated, but they went up yesterday on
the prospect of the revolution terminating
the obstruction.
The Consular advices allege that the
American naval forces and the railway
company officials have "given some as
sistance to the revolutionary element at
Colon."
PARIS, Nov. 5.â The French Consul at
Panama has cabled a request for in
structions in view of the revolution, and
Foreign Minister Delcasse Is considering
the question. It is expected that in
structions will be formulated and
soon, showing the attitude of the French
Government. There is a- strong Indica
tion that its attitude will not be materi
ally different from that of the United
States and it probably will take the same
general lines.
French Consul in Panama Makes
This Allegation. .
SAYS AMERICA AIDS REBELS.
Either In his message on Monday or in a
special communication, the President will
call the attention of Congress to the
newly created conditions on the isthmus.
If the administration has its way the ne
gotiation of a canal treaty will follow im
mediately. Although the Washington
Government has been aware for three
days that the revolution would succeed,
it has not yet been decided who shall
represent the United States at the capital
of the republic.
The cruiser Baltimore, which should
now bo at Puerto Plata, will be given'or
ders at once to proceed to Colon, thus
making a total of eight ships ordered
there.
"The war is over" Is the way an official
put it at the conclusion of the conference
to-night. Advices received from Europe,
stating that European Governments gen
erally approved this Government's policy
on the isthmus, were gratifying to the ad
ministration oÂ£flcldts}\ â * "Â¦*Â¦ r '
Full recognition will hot be extended
until a permanent Government has been
established, but practical recognition has
already been accorded the republic by
Commander John Hubbard, who exercised
his offices in bringing about the agree
ment with General Tovar.
The President and all those in the con
ference to-day expressed satisfaction with
the manifesto issued by the revolution
ists.
The President to-night received news
that General Tovar and all of the Colom
bian Government troops in Panama had
evacuated the isthmus, leaving the revo
lutionist provisional government of the
new "Republic of Panama" in undisputed
control and apparently headed straight
toward the establishment of a stable
Government which will be willing to let
the United States build the Panama
Canal for a reasonable figure. The Presi
dent immediately held a conference with
Secretary Hay and Assistant Secretary
Loomis, Secretary of the Navy Moody,
Rear Admiral Taylor, chief of the Bureau
of Navigation, and Rear Admiral Walker,
chairman of the Isthmian Canal Com
mission. No official statement was made,
but it was learned that the administra
tion regards the provisional government
as stable.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5â The President
probably will make a statement to-mor
row regarding the provisional government
of Panama, of the establishment of which
this Government was officially informed
to-day. In view of the latest advices
from Colon, to the effect that the Junta
has succeeded in gaining control of the
situation, it is expected that this an
nouncement will recognize the newly es
tablished Government.
Washington Government to Make
Announcement To-Day.

retary of Foreign Relations.
As soon as the Colombian troops leave
Colon the trodps of the new republic will

The Provisional Government has al
ready organized the military, to be com
manded by General Domingo Diaz. All
of the soldiers forming the division
fought with the Government or Liberal
army during the last revolution. They
are, therefore, already trained and ac
customed to military discipline. .
The revolution has been practically
bloodless, as only two Chinese were killed'
during the bombardment of the city by

Kuropeiyi powers probably will quickly

If You Have a Son This Will Interest You!
Every mother is confronted with two perplexing questions. Her boy is hard on his clothes, 3 /^^^^^^&
and every dealer claims he has the best values for the least money and can save her money. f^^^^^^^m
Like" the other dealers we make the same claim. But, anyway our reasons are feasible : l WSafi\*^W
We make our bays' clothing in our own workshops and sell direct to the wearer- in our San '^111 -^T
Francisco and New York stores, and but one fair profit is made in the transaction. Through a big â¢ *?'^Jk)
volume of business we reduce the cost of production and are enabled to sell at a close margin.
We thus save about a third in the making and selling of the clothes; the customer gets the benefit J^^^^W/^^^^,
Other dealers here in San Francisco buy either from a jobber or a manufacturer. These mid-
dlemen make a profit. On top of this comes the dealer's profit. You pay for these profits.
This is a fact, and those who put it to the test by buying here save fully a third on every pur-
chase. The harder a boy is on his clothes, the greater the reason why you should buy here. i^^^^^^m^^^^^

Bird applied this morning; to Prosecut
ing- Attorney A. P. Leacn'for a com
plaint asrainst Johnson. The court offi
cer advised that no criminal charge be
placed against the engineer until an ex
amination- as to his mental condition
could be held. It appeared to Attorney-
Leach that Johnson's actions were those
of a map who might be' mentally unbal
anced. Leach's advice was taken.
President Bird caused- Johnson's arrest
last night, claiming that Johnsori nad fol
lowed him from Tenth and Alice streets
to the Bird residence at 1017 Madison
street and ' had threatened to kill him.
The engineer had repeatedly, it was
claimed, declared he had intended to kill
the Birds, believing they were responsible
for the former Mrs. Johnson's refusals
to remarry her belligerent ex-spouse. The
Johnsons were divorced some time ago
and Mrs. Johnson resumed her maiden
name of Miss S. J. White. Mrs. Bird
was' an intimate friend of Miss White
before her marriage and after the sep
aration the divorced wife was a frequent
visitor at the Bird residence.
"Johnson was very anxious to remarry
his former wife," said Bird to-day, "and
he made her life miserable by pursuing
her. Only a week ago, while Miss White
and Mrs. Bird were walking downtown,
Johnson accosted them in such a threat
ening way that they ran into a restau
rant and called a policeman, who escorted
them home. I was compelled to cause
Johnson's arrest because I believed he
would carry out his frequent threats .to
kill us." . " X; ? - :^-
Johnson was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital this afternoon by the police, a com
plaint alleging insanity having been sworn
to by the engineer's divorced wife.
Persistent pursuit of his former wife,
Mrs. Jennie White Johnson, and frequent
threats to do- bodily harm to her friends,
Walter SI. Bird^ president of the Ala-r
meda County Christian Endeavor Upion;
and Mrs. Bird, has led to the arrest lirid
detention of Edward Johnson, a civil en
gineer, for examination by the Commis
sioners of Lunacy.

WASHINGTON., Nov. 5.-Somt time ago
General Davis, commanding the Division
of the Philippines, recommended a reduc

the Secretary cf War authorized the chief
cf staff to determine what reduction
should be made. Genera! Youn-j has de
cided that the garrisons in the Philippines
for the present ' should remain at four
regiments of cavalry and nine of infantry.
When the arrangement for. five regiments
of infantry and ten of cavalry was made
â¢t was decided that one-third of the In
fantry and cavalry would at all times
be svfficient in the Philippines and two
thirds in the". United States. When the
orders were being prepared for the recent
change, however, it was necessary to pass
over the Eighth Infantry because half of
that regiment was in Alaska. 'By keeping
only nine regiments of infantry in the
Philippines it will, enable the department
to make the exchanges without interfer
ing with., the Alaska service and possibly
the Porto Rican service, and in addition
thereto -an extra regiment wijl be always
available for any emergency without
breaking down the plan. It !s not prob
able that any further reduction of the
garrison in the Philippines will be made
until proper barracks accommodations
can be provided in the United States.

"We had a boarder at the house, too, a
fellow tradesman of mine, who left Mon
day without paying me a week's board
bill he owed. I had objected to him, and
perhaps that might have had something
to do with this trouble."
Dieudonne said he had seen his wife
on the street once since her disappear
ance, but before he had time to overtake
her she disappeared out of sight. The
distressed baker told the detectives that
he had tried to trace the whereabouts of
his children, but had been unable to get
a clew to their hiding place.
"What with the influence of this wo
man," the sorrow-burdened husband con
tinued, "and the departure of the boarder,
I don't know what to make of things.
I am not prepared to accuse anybody, but
I do know that without the slightest cause
my wife has left and taken my children."
Dieudonne was so sorely troubled dur
ing his narrative that he broke into fits
of hysterical weeping, giving evidence of
great mental worry. He begged the de
tectives t6 assist him In his efforts to
recover his missing family. The griev
ing parent was referred to the Chief of
Police. ' Â¦>

known to the grief stricken husband, who
declared to Detectives Kyte, Quigley and

the blame in large measure for the fam-'
lly's disappearance.
Dieudonne is a baker employed at the
Cape Ann Bakery. According to his tear
laden narrative, he had been living hap
pily with his wife ever since their mar
riage eight years ago. The children are

SIMPSON'S CHARACTER.
Policemen JWlihey, Kreuger William
J. Brown. Saurr and Draper all followed
on the stand, and said under oath that
tney were present at the time and heard
the question and answer. The policemen
were all submitted to a mild grilling bv
Commissioner Hutton for not having
made a report of this conversation to
their superior officer. Hutton stated that
it was as much the duty of the com
mission to protect the innocent as It was
to punish the guilty. This statement was
the cue for Attorney Campbell, who
arose and said:
Policemen James J. McEntee testified
to. a conversation with Walsh. In which
the latter accused Wolff of having
brought him before the commissioners
some time before and of having
caused information to bo con%-ey
ed to his wife that made trou
ble for him at home. Policeman P.
J. Folej- pavf similar testimony and Po
liceman Tom Cavanaugh was put on this
stand. Cavanaugh said that while stand
ing in company with Walsh and several
other policemen at Fourth and f'lara
streets on the morning after WaNh
gave damaging testimony against tho srr
grcant. he had asked Walsh what the
troubir between himself and Wolff was
Tc this Walsh replied: "Well, he tried to
br*>ak me once and now I will break him
If 1 can."
ANGE2ED AT WOLFF.
Then the sensational part of the case
commenced. It was in the nature of posi
tive testimony to show that Patrolman J.
S. Walsh, v.ho Ustifled against Wolff at
th* previous hearing of the case, had a
spite apainst the officer and an object in
seeing him punished. The testimony went
so far as to show that Walsh had stated
that he wr.s doing his best to "break"
Wolff and that lie should try to succeed.
Charles ZinRand was the first of about
tifty saloon-keepers in Wolff? section who
had been railed for the purpose of prov
ing that the sergeant had not received nor
had he dt-mandea tribute from any other
person engaged in the liquor business.
When Zinkand had finished the commis
sion dismissed the other witnesses, eaying
that it would be admitted that. their tes
timony would be similar to that just
given.
Among th<? witnesses on reputation were
Jurats Swain, a metal worker; John P.
Johnson, a cabinet-maker; John C.
Hodsts. a laborer; H. V. Osgocd, a sales
man, and William Hill, a waiter. There
were teveral more who did not obey sub
poenas and they will be arrested and
brought before the commission at its
meeting on Monday afternoon. Henry T.
McGuerren, Louis Holtz and Dan Crowley
aÂ»i claimed to have been present in-Crow
ie> 'e saloon when Al Neill, .who is a nom
icai partner of Simpson's, state* that he
did not know of any money having been
paid to the officer. This was in eontradic
i.on of Neills statement at thÂ« previous
meeting that he was aware of the trans
action. The reputation of James Badley,
me bartender, was assailed by John j.
ijauphn.y. Supervisor George Alpers,

WALSH IS ACCUSED.
.After the case had been called Attorney
Eon, representing Miss Sollomon. asked
that the charges be withdrawn, the of
ficer having made arrangement to repay
tbe money. The commission objected to
this procedure and ordered a hearing of
the case. There was much argument,
but the commission remained firm and In
sisted upon a trial, that the conduct of
the officer might be learned. When this
decision became positive, Chapin turned,
Â«Â«aled himself at the secretary's desk and
wrote out his resignation. A vote was
taken and it was accepted.
There was an array of witnesses in the
Wolff case. Campbell & Metson appeared
tmr the, defendant and Attorney Williams
wa.$ counsel for George B. Simpson, who
alleged that ho paid the sergeant money
on three different occasions. The bulk of
testimony went to prove that the reputa
tion of the complaining witness and thai
Â«jf his bartender, who supports him in his
accusations, were exceedingly bad and
that their wurd could not be relied upon.
Men appeared who claimed to have bet>n
robbed, swindled and deceived by both of
Uae'tnc-n. while others stated that, having
heard the standing of both discussed,
ihey formed the impression that it was
very i>oor.
The application for a license to sell
liquor with mÂ« als on the premises of what
vu known as the Hotel Nymphia was
denied -early in the session. There was no
argument. Commissioner Hutton, ' who
acted as chairman, making a simple state
ment that the board was opposed to any
such a request. Then the case of Police
man Edwin M. Chapin was called. Chapin
was accused by Miss Christine Sollomon,
a domestic, of having caused her to ac-
QUire a taste for liquor, betrayed her and
borrowed $235 from her under promise of
marriage, and all this while the officer
vat a married man.

bis resignation and the trial of Sergeant
K. A. Wolff, charged with taking money
from a saloon-keeper on his beat, de
veloped many interesting features. A
greater portion of the defense was heard
and the hearing terminated in a mild
dispute between the Chief of Police and

POINT RICHMOND, Nov. 5.-A well
defined rumor has gained currency herÂ«
that in harmony with the general improve
ment of the Harrirrian lines from Otfden
to the coast, the Sacramento shops are to
be moved to Point Richmond. The story
goes that only a sufficient plant is to be
lert at Sacramento to do the repairing on
locomotives for the mountain divisions,
and that all the car repairing and manu
facturing is to be transferred to Point
Richmond. The Southern Pacific Com
pany recently acquired 1C0 acres of water
front land here, immediately- north of the
Standard Oil Company's property, and It
la said it also has an option on a large
body of marsh land east of this tract.
The Pacific Coast Oil Company has
bought a tract of 250 acres rive i mile*
northeast of the big refinery. The deeds
come from Adolph Klose and others near*
Sobrante station on the Southern Pacific
Railroad. It is given out by representaÂ«
tives of the company here that the land Is
to be covered with storage tanks. The
tract lies along the big pipe line from
Bakersfield and has an elevation of 200
feet or more above the refinery. From
the storage tanks the oil would flow down
to the reflnary by gravitation. The pipe
line having proven a success it is found
that the company, notwithstanding it3
Immense tanks here, is still far short of
adequate capacity to accommodate thd
output of the pipe line.
Later at police headquarter? , he con
fessed, but declined to give any informa

himself except to say that he has
been in Lcs Angeles two years and is a

tives believe he is a professional burglar.
One of the bullets fired by Detar passed
through Clandlers' coat.
The shots aroused the neighborhood and
men appeared with revolvers, rifles and
shotguns a n3 joined in the search. For a
time the burglars escaped, but a hat
dropped by one of them was found. Half
an hour later a citizen reported to the
officers that he had seen a hatless man
run up the rear stairway to a fashionable
flat. Going there the officers found Carl
Clanders, a well-dressed young man of
25 years, lying in a dark corner pretend
ing to be asleep. He was hatless and his
hands were badly cut by glass, slivers of
which still adhered to his clothing. He
was immediately handcuffed and taken
back to the store, where he was positlvelv
identified.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 5.â Clad only in
his nightshirt, S. L. Detar gave battle to
two burglars, whom he saw break into
his store, opposite the State Normal
School, to-night, fired several shots at
them and half an hour later one of the
thieves was caught and confessed.
Detar had retired and his wife from her
window in the house adjoining the store
saw two men breaking open the rear door.
She called her husband and handed him
his revolver. Without waiting to dress,
Detar crept to the store and entered
through the door that the burglars forced
open. In front of the store was a look
out, but he did not notice the upproach
of the thinly clad man.
When the proprietor entered the store
he found the burglars in the act of rifling
the cash register and at sight of him they
leaped through the front show window to
the street and fled. Detar pursued them,
firing as he ran, and calling for help.
Deputy Constable Appel took up the
chase and also began shooting at the
fleeing thieves.

PEKING, Nov. 5.â Paul I-essar, the

the demands. of his Government for the
execution of Major Wong, who recently
decapitated a noted brigand in Russian
employ, and the dismissal of Yuan, Tao
tai of Moukden, who "is Wong's . superior
officer. The Chinese officials here are un
able, to say whether Russia proposes to
withdraw her troops from Moukden and
release the Tartar general of the city,
now held in custody in his yamen, if
these demands are not granted.
Minister Lessar has told the officials of
the Chinese Foreign Office that he is sur
prised that Ihey should consider Rus
sia's action in this matter
as, in view of the circumstances,. he thinks
it was lenient. The Russians think that
the execution, without trial, of the bri
gand who was acting as chief of an irreg
ular force of Russian police, was part of
China's policy to terrorize the Chinese
so as to prevent them from entering the
Russian military employ in Manchuria.
Minister Lessar Insists That Major
Wong Be Executed.

Russian demands. China now shows a

DOAN'S KIDNEY PILLS.
plentFoTTtT".
Xoti More Proof Like This, and It Is All
- From San Francisco People.
"The proof of the pudding is in the
eatlnir of it." If any city or town in the
I'nion *nas sufficient proof on the follow-
ing subject it is San Francisco. Genuine
merit is finding its reward in the -hearty
cndorsatlon of local citizens. When
people right here at home, friends and
neighbors of our readers, give a state-
ment like the following for publication
it is proof corrvincing for the most skep-
tical. Read this" testimony:
F. L. Smith, boxmaiier in- the National
Box Factory, residence 741 Folsom
street, says: "If r was not thoroughly
impressed with the fact that Doan's Kid-
ney Pills can be depended upon I would
never have gone out of my way to rec-
ommend the preparation to others suffer-
ing from kidney â¢ complaint. Before I
took a course of the treatment I had
tried more than one standard remedy,
but the results, as far as stopping the
trooble. were just as rwnotely in the dis-
tance as when I first noticed that my
kidneys were out of order. A sure indi-
cation that in some way the action of
my kidneys was upset was too frequent
action of the kidney secretions, added to
the backache, particularly if I contracted
a cold. For the last six . months there
has not been an , indication of .either ex-
cited or weakened kidneys." . " .

The pungah gourd has no handle and Is
often eight to twelve inches in height and
from fourteen to eighteen inches In di
ameter. A large one will hold a hundred
dozen eggs. One lady of the early times
packed her silk wedding dress in one.
In the earlier stages of our civilization
when cooperage vessels, glass ware and
toilet articles were classed as luxuries,
the gourd took the place of most of these
articles. Our great-grandmothers used
the pungah gourd for many purposes. It
was the receptacle for lard, molasses,
sugar, coffee, fruit, eggs, preserves, salt,
soap and other household articles. It
served the purposes of the modern cans,
boxes, jugs, bottles, buckets, etc. Early
legislators valued It so highly that they
exempted It from sale by execution for
debt.

meant the cream puffs, yelled back:
"'Sure, he's all rieht.'

Polygamy is not the only Mormon evil. When any
church dictates, and has the power to dictate, and practices
dictation to its members in politics, it is as dangerous as
anarchy to the life of this republic. It is that dictation
that must be prohibited. Any vote cast in obedience to it
must be made an illegal ballot, and any election secured
by such ballots must be made void. The fiddle-faddle about
denying Apostle Smoot his seat in the Senate is inconse
quential. It cannot be done. But the bars that were left
down when Utah, Idaho and Wyoming were made States
can be put up in the case of New Mexico and Arizona.
THE political aspirations of the Mormon church are
publicly manifested. As a form of religion no one has
logically any other than a religious quarrel with
Mormonism, such as is chronic between all the diverse forms
by which men choose to interpret their relations to the
universe. But the Mormon hierarchy was long politically
dominant in the State of Deseret and the Territory of
Utah. It instituted polygamy and church divorce, and
though by political necessity compelled to abandon them in
order to secure admission of .Utah to the Union, it has
never relinquished the hope of getting back through politics
what it lost by politics. It is industriously colonizing
Idaho, Wyoming, Arizona and New Mexico, and hopes
with Utah to finally control five. States, with ultimate de
.signs on Montana and Nevada.
While the church works through politics it has no par
tisan politics. The two Utah Senators are Republicans, but
one, Mr. Kearns, is a Gentile. It is the policy of the
church to displace him, and in doing so to secure a member
in each party caucus in the Senate. So the next -Legislature
of Utah will be Democratic, and a Mormon Democrat will
go to the Senate in place of Mr. Kearns. All this is fore
shadowed in the Salt Lake City election. The result was a
Democratic victory, a large majority of the elected officers
being Mormons, and their success was openly approved
by Apostle and United States Senator Smoot!
The Mormon policy raises a question embarrassing to
the statehood of Arizona and New Mexico. They are in the
Mormon f net, and should escape it first before they are
permitted to come into the Union. When they come the
enabling act admitting them and their State constitutions
should contain stronger guaranties than were exacted from
Utah.

Gold leaf is then laid on to the rod,
completely covering the polished sur
face, and -the "glided" rod is then drawn
again and again through the steel dies
until it becomes too fine for its hole3.
The "gem draw plates" are then brought
into action and the drawing process is
continued until the wire is about .002
to .003 inch in diameter â that is, about
as fine as the hair on a baby's head.
Wax, oil or soap is employed to lubricate
the -wire '.during the operation, and oc
casionally the wire Is annealed by being
wound on copper cylinders and laid On
a charcoal fire for a few minutes. Tho
result of the series of drawing is to pull
a silver rod about 'one and three-quarter
inches in diameter and two feet- six
Inches long, coated with but one layer of
gold leaf, into a wire which, if pot cut,
would extend 400 to 600 miles from the
wire drawer's workshop.
Silver ingots are "grained" by melting
the metal and running It into water,
where it takes a granular form. Tho
granules aro remelted and poured" into
molds, which make silver bars, which
are hammered into rods about two inches
in diameter. The hammering makes the
"metal more compact. One end of the
rod is pointed, and the point inserted
through a hole of a steel die, A clamp is
screwed to the pointed end and a chain,
which runs around a revolving drum, ia
attached to the clamp. The machine is
started and the silver rod is pulled
through the hole, which diminishes its
diameter arid gives the rod. a mirror
like polish.
Rubies, sapphires and diamonds, with
microscopic holes drilled through them,
are the "gem draw plates" made in
France, where the method of drilling
precious stones to such almost unbe
lievable fineness is kept a close trade
secret. It is through these brilliants
that gold, silver, platinum and the silver
gilt are drawn down to attenuated fila
ments which can only be measured by -a

is used in the manufacture of gold lace,

for almost everything in common use

If, in some way, all the wire In this coun
try were suddenly destroyed, business,
manufacturing, mining, transportation
and farming would stop. Any time a
storm brings down the wires between

around to appreciate the fact â not com
monly recognized â that wire is an essen
tial to one's everyday llfÂ». In the com
monest things â pins, needles, nails, win
dow screens, bed springs, picture cord,
watch springs, brooms, fruit boxes,
pianos, women's hats, hairpins, shoes,
books, magazines, umbrellas, spectacles,
kitchen utensils, watch chains, scarf
pins, fences and so on â wire forms the
whole or part. Great cables, which can
withstand a pull 0$ 150 tons, and bolting
cloth which has 40,000 meshes to the
square inch are made of wire, and all of
the precious and useful metals and their
alloys are drawn through steel dies or
"gem draw plates" to meet requirements
which call for wire.
The human hair is about one three-hun
dredth of an inch in diameter and the
silk worm's fiber Is about one five-thou
sandth of an Inch across, but platinum
wire has been made so fine that 25,000
wires, eld.; by side, would measure but
one inch across, and It is a matter of
record that some years ago a wire worker
namod WoMaston. by silver plating the
platinum, secured a wire the three one
hundred-thousandth part cf an inch in
diameter, wire which weighed one and a
quarter grains to the mile. The silver
plate aided him in that it held the plati
num until it could bo drawn no finer.
Then the silver was eaten off by nitric
acid, and the result was a wire which
could not be seen by the unaided eye.
Aluminum has been drawn so fine that
one ounce of the metal made 34,200 feet
â over six miles â of wire, but It must be
remembered that aluminum is the lightest
of the useful metals. Iron wire has been
secured so fine drawn that forty miles of
It weighed but one pound, and in England
Is a coll of hard copper wire which weighs
eleven pounds and tlli wire In one un
broken length is 1C0 miles long. It .taxes
one's credulity to learn that iron, steel,
copper and other metals can be drawn
and stretched to such degrees of fineness,
yet the silver-gilt wire used in the man
ufacture of "gold lace" for uniforms and
tassels â an ordinary everyday product
runs from 1500 to 2500 yards to the ounce
and It has been figured out that 50,000
hair springs for watches are made from
one pouni of steel.

Read another way; for his utterance is an' anagram, he
may mean that he adopts as his own the view of President
Roosevelt taken by the New York Sun and other trust
organs. According to that the President has disturbed
the business interests of the country by enforcing the anti
trust laws and compelling the situation which discloses
Schwab and Morgan and other high financiers as promoters
of jobs to induce the public to invest in water, supposing it
to be stocks that represented only the actual value of such
combined properties as those of the ship-building trust.
Read that way, and there is every reason for believing that
to # be his meaning, the Senator issues his anagram as a
grand hailing sign to â¢ the hydraulic financiers that help
cometh from "My Maryland," and if their scheme can only
hold water till Mr. Gorman gets into the White House it
will go to par.
Of course he will not publicly put it that way. He
works along the color line, and accuses the President of
disturbing the harmonious relations of the North and South,
S'Â» necessary to business, by insisting that the constitution
is the fundamental law and that under it there is equality
in the common rights of humanity. The Sun and the
other trust organs in New York made that issue against the
President. It is not original with* Mr. Gorman. The two
Morgans, J. P. and J. T., differ less than by their middle
initials on that subject and would pull harmoniously in Mr.
Gorman's tug-of-war. Of course it would never do for
the trust newspapers to put their real reason for opposing
President Roosevelt, so they made the usual appeal to
prejudice and .raised the race issue.
The people are ready to end the traditional prejudices
of the Civil War by hanging the Republican bloody shirt
on Mr. Gorman's Democratic color line to dry while they
go on in the path of reason and equal rights and against
special privileges., It will be very difficult for Mr. Gorman
to make a distinction favorable to him between the honest
policies required for the prosperity, of the country, which
will present him as an exponent of that which is wisest and
best. When he chooses to state frankly his belief, judging
by his position on the Wilson tariff bill and sound money,
he will say that he believes in protection and the gold stan
dard*. Then the people will say to him: "Go to; so does
President Roosevelt, who has been tried and not found
wanting.'^
That is a Delphic utterance. -The Senator furnishes no
interpretation. His party, ever since 1896, has been pro
posing radical action that would have destroyed and not
merely disturbed the. business interests of the country. Dur
ing all that time the Republican party, materially aided by
the Gold Democracy, has been safeguarding and promoting
those interests. Does the Senator mean that his victory
means that he indorses the Republican record and has com
pelled his party in Maryland to surrender?
SENATOR GORMAN carried Maryland by 8000 major
ity. It puts him in the Presidential field, and Sen
ator Morgan says that he will have the support of the
solid South for the nomination. Interviewed about the
result, Mr. Gorman said: "I regard the result of yester- 1
day's election in Maryland as a protest against further radi
cal action intended to disturb the business interests of the
country." .

FOR the first time in the history of the Latin-American
states, there is a revolution that means more than
power and plunder. When the "Congress at Bogota Te
jeeted the canal treaty with the United States, and during the
proceedings captured and held the official dispatches to our
Minister and his to the State Department, cutting off all
communication with our official representative, The Call
predicted the revolution that has just broken out.
The people of the isthmus want "the canal. The Pariama
railroad has given them contact and experience with the
world's civilization and commerce. While they are out
numbered by the non-isthmian provinces, they have the
intelligence and the enterprise of Colombia within their
borders. With great commercial opportunities near to them
they find themselves hampered and held back by a vicious
Government and a financial system that is a farce. Their
rate of exchange is about 1200, meaning that one dollar in
the world's money is worth 1200 dollars in the money in
which their Government compels them to do business. They
looked forward to a betterment of conditions when the
world's highway between the oceans- was built across their
territory. These aspirations were sane and praiseworthy.
But a weak executive and a corrupt Congress defeated
them, and managed to do it in a way that was such an in
sult to the' United States as- to warrant the withdrawal of
our Minister from Bogota.
The expected revolution on the isthmus follows. The
Bogota Government has met it in the usual uncivilized
way, by a bombardment without notice and the intercep
tion of the dispatches of our Government to the command
ers of our warships, to prevent their presence at the scene,
where they would have forbidden the barbarous bombard
ment. It is obvious that the United States cannot take ac
tive steps to aid the revolution. Though it might be in the
interest of civilization, it would not conform to our inter
national obligations. But, clearly within our rights, we can
passively contribute to the success of a praiseworthy as
piration.
Under our treaty with Colombia we assume the respon
sibility of protecting the. operation and the neutrality of the
Panama railway. We can prevent its use for military pur
poses by the Bogota Government, and we can prohibit the
bombardment of Panama or Colon. The, revolutionary
forces are already on the isthmus, for they constitute the
inhabitants. They do not have to use the railway to get
there, but the predatory Government from which they se-
cede must use it to make effective resistance. Denied the
right to bombard, that Government finds its gunboats quite
useless, and while it is making overland marches to get
at the seat of war, such time will elapse as to give our
Government the clear right to accord belligerency to the
revolutionists and to recfognize theirs .as a government de
tacto, as is our settled practice in dealing with the effer
vescent Latin-American states.
These two steps, which violate no principle of interna
tional law, go far toward enabling the crystallization of a
government de jure. All Europe recognizes our hegemony
of this hemisphere and willingly concedes our right to pro
tect our own and the nationals of other powers while the
trouble is on.
The practice of the Latin-American Governments - of.
stealing our official dispatches to our Ministers and our
fleet commanders suggests a desirable change in our naval
policy. Our naval officers should be trusted with a larger
discretion. Suddenly developed situations like this should
be dealt with primarily by them, using their best judgment.
They are trained men, of necessity learned in international
law, and they have the .power to communicate with our
Ministers and Consuls General near the scene of action.
They should have the power to use a wise discretion and
say to an uneasy an'd half-savage people, ."Thou shalt and
thou shalt not."
While our Government, as we have safd. may only pas
sively and within its rights do anything to aid the rigiiteous
revolution, it is conceivable that many Americans, who
understand the situation and, looking at the map, see.
the slender attachment of the isthmus to the body of Co
lombia, may conclude to do some work there on their own
account, and if they conclude, in sufficient numbers, to put
their hands to the cutting of the isthmus from the body
that misuses it, the work will be done effectively.
Looking to our interest in the canal, there is obvious
propriety in having that waterway entirely in the joint con
trol of the United States and a people who are all interested
in it. The creation of a purely isthmian state, advanced and
self-governing, to be traversed by the. canal, is required by
the world's commerce. The great body of Colombia, being
remote from the canal, with an immobile people who
would never see it and who would appreciate it only as
something new to be plundered if possible, has no more
right to control it in any degree than the savages of the
Congo basin.

You now have the right and left leads

Let me suggest that you cut out each

Remember this seemingly unimportant

Never Lend either knee in any lead,

Theee two counters are among the most

AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMESREDDING, Nov. 5.â Early this morn-
Ing in the office building of Superintend
ent J.B. Scott, a gallon case of gasoline
exploded. A few minutes later another
explosion ' occurred - from an unknown
source. It had all the, power of dynamite,
though none of: that explosive was known
to be in the building. It hurled . timbers
in every direction. A f flying fragment
struck ' Lt E. Bailey, a miner, seriously
bruising him.

The ranch, whicH is a highly, improved
piece of property; will form part of the
site of the immense reservoir the Bay
Cities Water Company Is to build there.
Between 1500 and 1S00 acres will be in the
reservoir, and the entire Spreckels ranch
will be covered with water many feet
deep. The Â¦ water company has acquired
Immense holdings at Coyote and this last
purchase, . with a strip of land they are
seeking to have condemned In rourt, will
give them, complete control of the big
water supply there.
SAN JOSB, Nov. 5.â The A. B. Spreck
els ranch at Coyote station, ten miles
south of this city, has been sold to the
Bay Cities "Water Company. Possession
will be given the purchaser on January 1.
The price is between $90,000 and 5100,000.
There are 600 acres In the ranch, which
was formerly the Polhemus stock farm.
Mr. Spreckels has been conducting the
place as a stock farm and dairy and rais

"WATER WILL TRANSFORM
'RANCH INTO RE'SERVOIR
Governor Dole says that the majority
of the new settlers on tho public lands
last year were white men.
He recommends that a limited immigra
tion of Chinese laborers to the Territory
be permitted, conditioned upon their en
gaging only In agricultural, mill and do
mestic work for hire during their stay,,
and subject to deportation at their own
expense upon their ceasing to do so. -
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5.â Governor San
ford B. "Dole, chief executive of the Ter
ritory of Hawaii, expresses the opinion
In his annual report to the Secretary of
the Treasury that "unless there should
be a larger Immigration of American set
tlers than now seems probable the pres
ent numerical Inferiority of those who
may be classed as belonging to the Teu
tonic race as compared'with the Hawall
ans will in a few years become a still
greater Inferiority as compared with the
American citizens of the Hawaiian, Por
tuguese, Japanese and Chinese races."
This opinion Is based on conditions In
the schools. The American and European
children In these schools, not Including
Portuguese and Porto Ricans, number
1505, an increase of only eighteen more
than the previous year, while the Hawaii
an, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese
children in the schools number 16,299, an
increase of 945. Among references In the
report to social conditions In Hawaii are
the following:
There are many marriages between Hawaiian
women and white men and a few between
â¢white women and Chinamen. The offspring of
both classes of marriages are an Improvement
as a rule over the Hawaiian In business. The
Portuguese generally Intermarry among them
eelves. The same is true with the Japanese.
Part Hawailans as a class are increasing:,
and the rate of decrease of the pure Hawaiian
appears to be a diminishing one.
The report says the statistics show a
steady increase in the last three years in
the production of sugar and an Increase
in the shipments outside the Territory.
Coffee shipments show an increase of
720,000 pounds over the previous year, but
a decrease of 6S9.0S0 pounds compared
with the year ended June 30, 1901. Rice,
the report says, Is inevitably a diminish
ing product, both from the competition of
the new rice fields of Texas and Louisi
ana and the diminishing numbers of Chi
nese in the Territory.

that the Bethlehem directors declare a
dividend to save the Shipbuilding Com
pany, and. later, at two subsequent meet
ings of the Bethlehem directors, in acqui
escing-in resolutions declaring it Inexpe*
dlent to declare such a dividend. He also
brought out that Nixon had voted for
the resolution for the expenditures Tor
betterments.
This was the means, so Receiver Smith
charges, by which earnings were diverted
from dividends to needless improvements.
Guthrie took up figures from the finan
cial reports of the Bethlehem company to
show Its inability to pay dividends. Un
termeyer, from the same reports, attempt
ed to show that expenditures for better
ments and new material were excessive
and that the company might well have
declared a dividend had it so desired. He
was questioning Nixon about the trip of
examination made by Bethlehem and Car
negie officials to determine means of im
proving the Bethlehem plant when the
hearing closed for the day. /
The re-direct examination of Nixon will
be resumed to-morrow afternoon and
Charles M. Schwab may be called to the
stand later in the day.
PORTLAND. Nov. 5.â Lying in shallow
water, opposite the shipyards of Joseph
Supple, the steamer Sue H. Elmore of
Astoria defies all efforts to move her Into
the channel. The powerful towboat Ock
lh-hama of the Orepon Railroad and Nav
igation Company fleet was dispatched to
the scene this morning. A line was passed
to the Elmore, but though the big steam
tup hauled for about an hour ehe was
unsuccessful in reaching the channel with
her tow and the attempt was abandoned
until the vessel could be lightered.

WOMAN ASKS THE DEAD

Members of a Mission in Eureka
Have a Queer Ceremonial at
Grave.
EUREKA, Nov. 5.â Or.* of the most sur
prising capes of religious fanaticism that
has occurred In these parts was that In
which members of the Penlel mission of
Eureka attempted to raise the dead by
prayer before a body was lowered Into
a grave yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Aiice Scow, who while in life had
been associated with the mission, died
three days aj?o, and many prayers had
been offered at the mission to have her
life spared. After the services had been
held at the grave yesterday and the box
containing the body had been lowered
into the grave four women of the Peniel
mission stepped to the edge of the grave
and asked that the box be lifted out
again, which was done. An undertaker
was called upen to open the box and
raise the head l!d cf the coffin. He did
so, and the women knelt about on the
gTound. One of the women commanded
the corpse to rise and made ineffectual
attempts to have the coffin lid taken eri
t'rely off bo that the dead might awaken.
The box was finally closed again and
lowered into the grave.

Whist Players Will Contest.
XAPA, Nov. 5.â The "Winship trophy
cemmittee arrived this morning with a
challenge directed against the Armijo
Club whist team of Suisun from the Val
lejo whist team for a match for the hand
some Winship trophy, now held by the
Suisun team. Suisun won it from the
Napa team. The committee will make ar
rangements Immediately for a contest,
which will bo held in Suisun. The Val
lejo team has the reputation of being a
strong one.
By agreement of the counsel the protest
was stricken from the record, but Nixon
thereafter during the hearing Insisted
that if he were to answer questions he
should be allowed to make the necessary
explanations.
Besides asking Nixon about the organ
ization of the shipbuilding company, the
valuations put upon the constituent com
panies and the methods by which they
were reached, Guthrie too** up the alleged
withholding of dividends by the Bethle
hem company, an action which, accord
ing to the charges of Receiver Smith, con
templated the wrecking of the company.
Guthrie placed In contrast Nixon's at
titude in demanding, by letter to Presi
dent Mcllvain of the Bethlehem company,
Nixon was on the stand all day. His
cross-examination was finished and the
re-direct examination partly completed.
At the opening of the afternoon session
he presented a personal protest, in which
he declared that Guthrie, In consultation
with Max Pam. .had adopted a line of
questioning designed to place him in a
false and discreditable position regarding
the sale of his plant to the Shipbuilding:
consolidation. The protest was angry and
bitter In tone and intimated that Guthrie
had been unfair in asking him to answer
from memory questions about the finances
of his company without opportunity to
look up the details, while Guthrie had
had the benefit of a full investigation of
tho figures.
NEW YORK. Nov. 5.â The features of
to-day's session of the hearing In the
United States Shipbuilding case were the
bitter attacks made by Lewis Nixon upon
Â¦William D. Guthrie, counsel for the de
fendants and representative of the In
terests of Charles Schwab, for his meth
ods of conducting cross-examination;
leading questions by Untermeyer, counsel
for the complainants, as to the absence
of competition between the Bethlehem
Steel Company and the Carnegie plant- of
the United States Steel Corporation in
Government contracts for armor plate,
and the entire change of front of Guthrie,
who heretofore had aimed to bring out the
fact that the value of constituent plants
of the United States Shipbuilding Compa
ny was not overestimated.
To-day Guthrie adopted a line of ques
tioning designed to show' that the esti
mates of value were made by the pro
moter, the vendors and other interested
or Inexpert appraisers, and were practi
cally worthless in determining the exact
value of the plants and the assets of the
consolidation.

It was Just a few minutes before mid
night when he returned to Santa Clara
and was ready to be married. The last
car was Just about to leave for San Jose.
Justice Herrington performed the cere
mony in Just thirty seconds, by actual
time, which is believed to be the record.
Mr. and Mrs. Piva then began their wed
ding Journey to San Jose.
A short time ago Clara Piva, a daugh
ter of the groom, married Joe Alves, a
brother of last night's bride. Piva has
now become the brother-in-law of his
daughter and son-in-law and his wife is
the sister-in-law and stepmother of his
daughter.
Manuel Piva, a widower of a few
months, with a family of six children,
was married at midnight last night | to
Mary Alves. He is forty years of age
and the sirl is but half that old. The
two families reside opposite each other
on Madison street. The courtship was
kept a secret. Last evening the couple
appeared before Justice Harrington at
Santa Clara and asked to be married.
Piva had not secured a marriage license
and was obliged to make a trip to San
Jose for the document.
SAN JOSB, Nov. 5.â The Portuguese

an elopement and a tangle of relationship
which the marriage makes in two fam

Special Dispatch to The Call.
After hearing testimony In the case
Judge Leib refused the temporary injunc
tion to stop the work. The court stated
that the damage done to the plaintiff, if
any, by the continuance of the work
would be far less than the damage to
the public by having the work stopped
now while the street is torn up all along
Its central portion. This disposition of
the motion does not dispose of the appli
cation for a permanent injunction, which
matter will come up in the trial of the
case.
Frederick Brown, a wholesale dealer,
applied to the court for an injunction to
prevent the road from going down North
Market street on the ground that it would
injure his property. He claimed the road
would prevent the free egress and ingress
of teams from his place of business. The
Interurban road, James "W. Rea and the
San Jose and Santa Clara Electric Rail
way were made defendants. For the last
week the men have been working on the
road and in another week it will be com
pleted. Both the San Jose and Santa
Clara Railway and the Interurban line
nre to run from Santa Clara street to the
broad gauge depot on North Market
street.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 5.â An application for
an Injunction to restrain the San Jose-

a small gasoline launch to fish in the

heavy sea began running, rendering it
unsafe to land at any nearby port.

points where the party might put in has
brought no, information concerning the

SACRAMENTO, Nov. 5.â Barber was In
the box for the Seattle team, and up to
the ninth he proved too great a puzzle
for the Senators to solve. In the ninth,
however, it looked like a batting finish,
as the Senators bunched four hits and
had two runs when Hlldebrand tried to
kill the ball and fizzled on account of
darkness. It was a great battle from
start to finish. Score:

of road and weather were favorable," he
says. "I am. sure I could lower the world's
record of :46 1-5 for a straightaway mile

I need three miles in all, It being neces

MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS
FR0H HER PARENTS' HOME
Police of T\ro Cities Are Searching
for Daughter of a New Tork
Broker.
NEW YORK, Nov. 5.â Much excitement
has been caused among the residents of
East Orange, N. J., by the mysterious
disappearance of Miss Clara J. Coffin,
daughter of a New Tork broker. The
girl was a leader In the younger social
set of the Oranges and had been study
ing quite hard to keep up with her classes
In high Bchool, where she was to grad
uate this year. The school authorities be
lieve her mind has given way under the
strain of overwork.
Miss Coffin left her home early Tuesday
evening, presumably to go to the home
of a friend a few steps distant. 8he never
reached that place, and no trace has been
found of her since.
There are relatives of the family resid
ing at Newcastle, Ind., but it is not
thought that Miss Coffin has money
enough with her to re&cn that place.
PARIS, Nov. 5. â Ths Court of Cassation to

lions.
President Hyde of the Automobile CluO
was Indignant at the actions of some
roughs who stole the electric lamps used
on his car for decorative purposes. When
President Hyde learned of the insults of
fered other members of the club during
the parade and the lack of police pro
tection, he stated he would not be In favor
of another parade.
In a few moments a crowd surrounded
Peabody and his friends, and all kinds
of threats filled the air. Some wanted
to use knives on the tires of the automo
bile, while others threatened to turn the
car over and smash it to pieces.
On all sid?s the crowd yelled that the
boy on the bicycle be paid for the alleged
damage to his machine, but Pfabody and
his friends refused to be held up. No* pa
trolman was in sight, and though special
officers of the United Railroads endea
vored to break the blockade and allow
the street cars to pass, they were power
less to do anything against the crowd.
The trouble was finally quelled by Pea
body giving his card to the lad who had
caused the trouble and the automobile
was allowed to proceed on its course,
after a delay of iifteen minutes.
At Fourth and Market streets there was
a sudden stop of the parade and Pea
body's machine touched the boy's bicy
cle. The lad dismounted and placed the
machine in front of the automobile and
refused to move unless he was given $2 50
for alleged damage to his bicycle.
ROUGHS CAUSE TROUBLE.
cycle a few feet in front of Peabody's
machine.
Red, black and white machines, carry
ing from one to six people, slowly passed
in review before the admiring crowds,
and then would come an automobile en
tirely hidden from view by its lavish floral
decorations.
Some of the machines were covered
with framework canopies, from which de
pended dozens of Chinese and Japanese
lighted lanterns. Other machines were
artistically decorated with American flags
and flowers, even to the spokes on the
wheels.
.The decorated machines were received
with applause along the line of the pa
rade and the cfiauffeurs and owners of
the carriages were given round upon
round of applause en route. Many of
the ladies who rode in the parade were
costumed in regulation automobile dress
and their natty appearance won plaudits
from the onlookers.
POLICE PROTECTION" I*ACKINO.
Barring an occasional slight breakdown,
quickly repaired, the parade was entirely
successful and returned tt> the starting
point, where the judges reviewed the pa
rade and awarded the prizes for the best
decorated carriages.
The lack of police protection and the
antics of a few roughs during the parade
caused pome annoyance to the automo
billsts. While proceeding along Market
street a crowd of young men threw gnnd
at some of the occupants of automobiles,
while at other points they deliberately
tore the pretty floral decorations from the
vehicles. The request of the occupants
of the carriages that they be not molested
was met with jeers, as no pptrolmen
were in sight to protect the chauffeurB
and their friends.
Serious trouble was narrowly averted
at Fourth and Market Streets when" the
touring car of E. E. Peabody accidentally
bumped into a, bicycle, ridden by a boy.
The boy persisted In riding In front of
Peabody's car, though he had been re
peatedly .warned. to, move out pf the par
ade. The lad impertinently . replied he
would do as he pleased, and rode his -bi-
Along the entire route of the parade
the BtreetH were lined with a solid mass
of sightseers. The automobiles proceeded
et a slow gait at a distance of twenty
feet, every machine constantly sounding
its whistles- and buglee. The glare of the
many lights on the machines added a
pretty effect to the scene. The arrange
ment of the parade was perfect In every
manner. Decorated machines were placed
at intervals In order to lend a picturesque
effect to the movlns panorama.
The route of the parade was along Van
Ness avenue to Market street, down Mar
ket to Montgomery, along tha't thorough
fare to Bush, thence to Kearny, turning
from Kearny Into Market and out the
main artery of the city to Van Ness ave
nue to the starting point.
It was half an hour after 8 o'clock when
President Hyde gave the signal for the
parade to start. Van Ness avenue was
crowded with thousands of people, at
tracted by the novel spectacle. To the
strains of music played by the band in
the carryall that led the procession the
hundred and more automobiles started on
their journey.
ROUTE OF THE PARADE.
There were cars that came to the start
ing point filled with merry men and
women, while others had but a solitary
passengerâ the pilot at the wheel. Some
of the automobiles were handsomely deco
rated, and others were bare of any at
tempt to catch the eye. The machine of
President Hyde of the Automobile Club
waa outlined in tiny electric lights run
from a storage battery. Others had hand
eome canopies over them covered with
flowers. For an hour the automobiles
converged on the starting point, and a
military band ensconced in a large steam
carryall discoursed popular music to the
accompaniment of the puffing of the ma
chines and the tooting of the warning
whistles and bugles.
On all sides were heard the tooting of
the warning whistles and bugles and the
chug-chug of the machines as the chauf
feurs piloted the vehicles to the ren
dezvous.

downtown streets of the city in
the presence of enthusiastic spectators,
estimated to number 30,000. The parade,
under the auspices of the Automobile Club
of California, was the first large one ever
given in this city, and its success demon
strated the growing increase in the use of
trie horseless carriage.
The variety of automobile machines
showed the vast amount of capital invest
ed in the latest mode of traveling. There
were gasoline machines of numerous
makes, carriages that were propelled by
steam and others whose motive powers
were electric storage. The parade was
arranged as a preliminary to the automo
bile races at Ingleslde track, which take
place to-day and to-morrow, in which
Barney Oldfield, the famous automobilist
from the East, will be the central figure.
There was considerable excitement in
the vicinity of Van Nes s and Golden Gate
avenues last evening, where the automo
biles gathered, previous to the start of
the parade.

mobiles passed in review last

praise as they slowly wheeled
along. The Leon Roos machine was one
of the most stunning in the parade. It
was decorated in canopy shape, outlined
with golden chrysanthemums and gar
landed with smtlax. The steam machine
of F. II. Hyde, president of the Automo
bile Club of California, was. elaborately
outlined w with tiny incandescent electric
lights run from a storage battery
and profusely embellished with a wealth
of pure white roses. It was one of the
most attractive mobiles In the procession
and was greeted with applause en every
side. Mr. Hyde's guests were Mr. and
Mrs. Frederick Marriott Jr. The machine
run by A. E. Cooper was a beauty. It
waa entirely covered with a background
of moss and ferns, studded from stem to
stem with white rosebuds. The wheels
were encircled with garlands of tiny
rosebuds and sprays of smilax. Both
Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Glennon, who were
in the party, were- exquisitely gowned in
white silk with white hats, and each car
ried a magnificent bouquet of white roaes.
Supervisor Rock was also of the party.
Joseph Hojle's machine was decorated
in canopy 'shape, surmounted by American
flags.flkJt practically looked like a floral
domeT'Hvreathed in red. white and -blue
bunting, while here and there were sus
pended tiny lanterns of every hue and
shade. Bunches of flowers added to the
beauty of the decoration.
The machine of F. Nelson received great
applause; It was all embellished with
California poppies, surmounted by a
superb butterfly, while strings of tiny
lanterns reached far above 'the driver's
head.
The pure white machine handled by
John D. Spreckels and containing a party
of his friends attracted considerable at
tention. Its superb mounting and the
manner in which it was handled evok'ed
much applause.
One of the smart-looking automobiles in
line was that of H. H. Davis. Though not
decorated it showed to advantage with Its
owner at the steering wheel.

The score was a tie when the Brownies
went to the bat in the tenth. Shields
got a life on Shay's error, the only one
of the game for the Natives. Van Buren
placed v him up with a sacrifice, and An
derson shot a torrid bouncer over the
third sack, which was Just the thing to
bring the Brownie pitcher In. The score:
The pitchers were the center of attrac
tion during 1 the game. Each was in
splendid form and honors were even.
Shields really had Uncle's followers
blanked, bnt Shea dropped a throw to the
plate in the second, allowing Krug, who
was running for Pabst, to imprint his
foot on the plate with the only run for
Uncle.
Portland had broken up the deadlock
In the tenth and It seemed all was over,
even the shouting. Delmas then came up
for the locals and smote one to Nadeau,
who promptly dropped it. Del went to
third and was forced by Zearfoss on a
bunt, although every one in the grand
stand and bleachers swore Delmaa" was
safe by a foot.
This made the home tossers sore and
they had it In for Rube. Play was sus
pended for a few minutes and in the in
terval Freeman, the Portland first base
man, took possession of the ball. Zearfosa
was warned and he hugged the bag.
When play was called Pitcher Shields
made a few mysterious motions, and as
he did Freeman deliberately pushed Zear
foss off the bag and tagged him out.
Levy could not have missed seeing the
play, but he called Zearfoss out. Then
the trouble began. Rube was surrounded
by the home team and they called him
down and threatened to start something.
In time the row was settled and the next
man up, "Whalen, failed to do anything,
so Portland won out.
The Native ball tossers* succumbed
after ten spasms of good ball yesterday at
Recreation Park. They would not admit
they were beaten, however, but gathered
around* Umpire Levy and said things to
him which a good, pious man would have
resented. The Indicator wlelder was pret
ty rank in many cases, and when he
spoiled the last chance of the home team
every man on the lot was for handing
him a bunch. Score, 2 to 1.
E. C. Hopper, who will preside In the
stand at Oakland, and Colonel William
Letcher, the nswly appointed handicapper
of the California Jockey Club, leave La
tonia for California next Monday.
A horse car that was sidetracked at
Oakland yesterday brought four of the
speediest fprinters from Chicago ever
brr-d in Texas. They will race In the col
ors of J. F. Xewman and are Burnie Bun

owned by Sidney Bender, the best of
which are poFsibly Lord Melbourne, Mar
lin. Jack Demund, Coroner Kelly, Mary
Dunn and Lola Daly.
Wade McLemore raved Boston Boy, Co
checo and two or three others at the Bay
District track several years ago, but left
a trifle frosty tempered and said he would
visit the Native Sons no more. Well,
Â¦Wade, In his good, old-fashioned Texas
way, concluded to forgive us and Is back
again with Dolly Hayman, Curate and
one or two more that may be heard from.
Claude, the four-time Derby winner,
threw Johnny Daly from h!s back at Oak

on his head that looms up like a pimple

HAVANA\ CIGARSIMMIGRANT BUREAU"
LOSES A PROSECUTION
. I knew Mrs. Tucker well In her work
here. Although I am called to perform a dif
ferent service than you and cannot go but as
you do my heart often goes out in most cordial
approbation for the good you are accomplish
ing. - You penetrate through millions of hearts
where the work is most needed, doing untold
good. â May the example of . the now glorified
woman spur you on to greater deeds.
Mrs. Colonel French told of her ac
quaintance with the late Mrs. Tucker
and of her good works. among the needy
poor \ of this and other citiesâ how she
worked with untiring zeal to uplift souls
to God and preach the gospel to all man
kind.' She told of the dead woman's sac
rifices made for herself and her family
that some poor people might be cared for
and brought to the kingdom of God.
The service was brought to a" fitting
close with a chorus of "Nearer, My God,
to Thee," and ended with a prayer by
Colonel -French.
The following. letter was read:
To the Press and Friends of San Francisco:
I desire to send the assurances of my utmost
gratitude for. their sympathy during this, the
darkest hour of my life. - Death \ has Indeed
culled our fairest flower, nay . transplanted It
to the regions where the frosts of sorrow and
the storms of time cannot* touch it.
The world knew, her as, a warrior soul,
tactful energetic,' daring, magnetic. . eloquent.
To the' Salvation Army she was a leader, bril
liant â¢ Intrepid, consecrated, sympathetic and
beloved. : But to hv family she was. the peer
less woman, daughter, mother, wife.. on whose
wise council in all emergencies, we had learned
to lean, and* around whose strong - yet tender
nature ;our â¢ hearts >'. have been inextricably
twined. â¢.'â¢ - Â¦-Â¦ : 'Â¦' : - '..Â¦'Â¦
Â¦- Our loss seems irreparable. I ask the pray-'.
Time nieR and njan remains. Man dies and
hope remains. Hose dies and God i abides. I
esteem you all because you are creatures, not
of words, but of deeds. In Interpreting t^ie
divine love. of God, in interpreting the love of
man for man, we all stand on a common plat
form. I hope that I shall live to see the day
when we shall all form the. great republic of
God.
GLORIFIED WOMAN'S EXAMPLE.
No woman who ever serves her follow beings
is forgotten. Happy are they who have loved
mankind, for they have been loved.
Reputation Is what men and women eee of
us, and that is passing. Character la what
God knows of us, and that Is eternal. At thÂ«
bottom of all our work wo are all trying to
bring God Into the world. I hope that the
time is coming when we will recognize that
we are all brethren In the one cause.
I think that your call came to you because
the churches were not able to do all they
ought to have done. It is a noble calling, and
I congratulate you. Colonel French, for hav
ing taken up the work of so good a man and
woman.
Rev. F. iW. Clampett made an address
on the good work of the late Mrs. Booth-
Tucker and the Salvation Army.
A double quartet from members of the
band sang an appropriate hymn, and
Rabbi Voorsanger. made an able address.
In Dart .he said:
If you have called me to mourn with you I
would rather sit among you and be silent, for
I will not interpret so great an act of God's.
If you have caUed me to teach you, then will
I talk to you.
CHARACTER IS ETERNAL.
â¢ I think Mrs. Booth-Tucker must have been
a verv noble and beautiful woman, and the
good Father must have loved her very much
and taken her to him for a greater good.
The Salvation Army of this city held
a united memorial service last night for
the late Consul Emma Moss-Booth-Tuck
er, who met such a tragic death'a few
days ago in the East.
The service was held In Lyric Hall, 119
Eddy street, under the direction of
Colonel and Mrs. George French, assisted
by the Provincial staff and band. The
hall was decorated in white and a large
gathering took part.
The Provincial Staff band opened the
service with Chopin's "Funeral March."
The opening address was delivered by
Rev. William Rader. He told of the good
work that was done by the Salvation
Army, and dwelt on the beautiful charac
ter of the late Mrs. Booth-Tucker.
Rev. Bradford Leavitt of the First Uni
tarian Church spoke as follows:
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Lois Olds Cowan from Mc-
Clure Cowan, for cruelty; Melita E. Smith
from Robert O. Smith, for desertion;
Rose Viola Vassels from G. R. Vassels,
for desertion, and Isabella H. Shelley
from Harry J. Shelley, for cruelty.
. W. D. M. Howard, a wealthy mining
engineer, with offices in the Mills build
ing, who was recently sued for divorce
on the ground of cruelty, by Grace L.
Howard, and who In a cross complaint
charged her with being the cause of the
lack of peace In the Howard household,
has taken the advice of his friends and
settled his family row out of court. A
dismissal of the entire proceedings has
been filed.
Virginia English, an evening school
teacher, was allowed to exchange her no
Bition with Clara R. WeÂ«terman a day
teacher in the Buena Vista School
elty; B. F. Baddeley against Mamie Bad
deley for desertion; E. A. Rathbun against
S. A. Rathbun. for failure to provide-
Florence Scott against Irwin L. Scott, for
failure to provide, and Josephine L. White
against Eugene White, for conviction of
a felony.
The San Francisco Retail Grocers filed'
a complaint with the board to the effect
that Mrs. F. M. Gannon, a teacher In the
Harrison Primary School, obtained goods
from Theodore Kast, one of the members
of the organization, under the name of
Mrs. Daniels, who opened an account under
that name and obtained all the goods
she could. The bill amounted to $62 85
of which only 55 had been paid. The or
ganization says the account has been run
ning two years and asks the board to in
vestigate the matter. The complaint was
referred to Superintendent Langdon.
The City and County Attorney was re
quested to furnish the board with a state
ment of the status of the case of Miss
Mary McKenzie vs. the Board of Educa
tion and also the status of all other cases
now pending against this board
In accordance with the recommendation
of Principal A. H. McDonald of the Lin
coln evening school Chester Bohm was
expelled from school. McDonald report
ed that the boy was Impertinent and
openly defiant.
Miss Catherine Felton and C. A. Mur
dock, representing the Associated Char
ities, appeared before the Board of Edu
cation yesterday to urge the enforcement
of the compulsory education law. They
stated that the organization was desirous
of ascertaining the number of children
who fail to attend school and to that end
asked the board to create a district in
which the conditions could be observed.
The Associated Charities agreed to dele
gate an agent to make investigations and
the cost of the experiment will be borne
by the organization. The board adopted
a resolution providing that the Associated
Charities be empowered to act for the
Board of Education In enforcing the com
pulsory education law.
The formation of the district was left to
a later meeting, but in all likelihood it will
include the Whlttier, Starr King and
Cleveland schools, all of which are south
of Market street, where It Is believed that
large numbers of children of school age
<lo not attend school.
Tho board abolished the Irving Scott
evening echool owing to lack of attend
ance. Director Mark stated that only
twelve boys attended the school and their
behavior was bad, they having thrown
eggs at the teacher. D. "W. Dolman, tho
teacher, was transferred to tho Hamilton
evening school.

C W. Pase is suing Ellen Page for di
vorce for cruelty. He says that on the
right of September 25 last, she threw his
collection cf dishes and vases at him and
that on the r.ight of October 1 she cut his
shoes into ribbons. They have been mar
ried thirteen years.
Clara M. Wolf wanta a divorce from
JuHus J. Wolf on the grounds of cruelty.
Intemperance and neglect. Sho says she
Is worried almost to death because of his
fondness* for liquor and the habit of car
rying about with him a small bottle of
poison. She says that he frequently
threatens to use the poison, and because
ehe fears that he wants to make away
with tier or with thc!r child, she wants to
be freed from him.
Mrs. Landbeck also complains of her
husband's alleged manner of playing with
their infant child. She says that Instead
!Â«f taking the child In his arms, as is the
fashion of most fond fathers, he places
the little one In a chair, stands off a tevr
paces and makes all sorts of uncanny
noises and fearsome gestures. As a re
pult of this peculiar treatment, the plain
tiff Bay?, the child is frightened almost out
of Its wits. It was Jn May of last year
that the Landbecks were married.
According to her complaint, Landbeck,
after reading a chapter in this book,
would turn upon her in a fury and abuse
her In a fearful manner. She says that
ehe stood It as long as she could, but was
compelled to flee from him when he com
menced making Bpwches and lecturing
her on the propriety of reserving her af
fections for her lawful husband. She
paid he would, after assimilating a chap
ter of "Driven to Madness," loudly chout
that ho was the ."living eon of God."
"that blood must flow" and that the
proper place for her was "behind the
bars."
One of the strangest complaints for di
vorce on record in the courts here was
filed yesterday by Ernestine Landbeck
against Kucene Landbeck. She charges
him with cruelty and says that the sort
of books he selects to read Is the cause
of their unhappiness. In her complaint
the refers particularly to a novel called
"Driven to Madness, or the Vengeance

A wedding of much interest occurred
yesterday at St. Ignatius Church, when
Miss Adele Cagllerl, daughter of Dr. Cag
lieri, one of the foremost Italian residents
of San Francisco, became the bride of
Dr. James F. Smith. The ceremony was
witnessed by a large contingent of the
Italian colony, but at the reception which
followed only relatives and intimate
friends were bidden.. The happy pair left
on a honeymoon trip to extend over a few
weeks.

Yesterday the California Club rooms
rang with music of a solemn and digni
fied qualityâ distinctly it was not gay.
It was the music section day, under the
direction of Madame Tojetti, and what
with Dr. H. J. Stewart's scholarly â¢ con
tributionsâ verbal and musicalâ together
with an interesting paper upon "Mystery
Plays," by Mrs. J. C. Crawford, and two
splendid renditions from Bach and Han
del by Miss Ella McCloskey, the afternoon
was one of delight to lovers of sacred or
semi-sacred music.
The development of the oratorio was
carefully followed from the primitive days
of the Gregorian chant in the early Chris
tian era on through the middle ages In
the expanded form of mystery plays,
whence, in Italy, the first visible form of
oratorio appeared, as conceived and ex
ecuted by the monk, San Fillppo Nerl.
The oratorios of Handel, Bach, Gounod,
Dvorak and Cowen were in turn handled
analytically and a passing knowledge of
this magnificent- phase of musical com
position became, in a more or less exact
fashion, the possession of every club
member present.
Wagner, with selections from "Parsi
fal," will occupy the music section day of
next month, which will occur on Decem
ber 3..
The Irving Club entertained its mem
bers and friends yesterdayâ just as many
as Utopia Hall would holdâ when Miss
Jenne Morrow Long delivered a forcible
and fitting talk upon "What Clubwomen
Should Know." Miss Long dwelt espe
cially upon the essentials of public speak
ing related to the physical and mental
conduct of the woman upon the platform.
If women still insist upon boring their
fellows at the club with indirectness and
lamentable verbosity then charge it not
to Miss Long, for she has shown us the
sin of it. The lecture was Utopian in
truth, but it may bear fruit. Who knows?
A piano solo by Miss Jessie Long and
two wholly delightful solos by Miss Leola
C. Stone closed the programme. To a
dulcet contralto voice that lingers caress
ingly in the ears Miss Stone adds a
charming personality. She will again ap
pear before the Irving Club on Decem
ber 3.

Hoyt, tho rich owner of the "Bar H"

While Mr. and Mrs. Lee are enjoying

ins the city of San Francisco for traces
of his runaway 'niece. Before the elopers
had left Bozeman he had started to find
them, but went In the wrong direction.
Lee was sent to school and afterward
to Leland Standford University by his
father. After spending two years there
he returned to the ranch, and was made
private secretary to Hoyt. He fell in
love with Hoyfs niece. The girl accepted
his attentions, but when her uncle dis

man, a sausagemaker. was held up In
broad daylight this afternoon by two men,
both of whom have been arrested. Tha
holdup occurred about half a block from
the business center of the city. One man
slipped up behind Coleman and seized
him around the neck .while the other
went through his pockets. As he was
released one man whispered a warning
in his ear that if he dared to complain he
would be '. killed. A policeman appeared
and cantured one of the men, after a
chase, and found the other later.
The first meeting of the newly incor
porated Catholic Club was held at the
Occidental Hotel last evening and was
largely attended by priests and laymen.
The club Is composed of members of the
Episcopal Church for the study of
Catholic doctrine and aggressive work in
restoring the ancient practices and ritual
of the church. The formation of the club
Is the indication of. the rapid spread of
what is known as the high church party
in the far "West and the grafting of its
principles upon the conservative element.
which has heretofore controlled it. It
means also a great change to the diocese
and the ultimate connection of California
Episcopalianism to the advanced school.
Last evening Father Parrish read a
thesis upon the "Scripture as the
Source of Church Doctrine," treating
upon its authenticity, the truth of mir
acles and other debated points.
"The church antedated the gospels," he
said, "and should the Bible be obliter
ated, the church itself wQuld be able to
witness to Its truth."
The thesis was learned and abstruse
and intensely interested the audience
that listened to it.
Rev. Sebastian Dabovich, Abbot of
tho Greek Cathedral, was present and,
on (Invitation, addressed the meeting rel
ative to the belief of his branch of the
Catholic church on the authority of the
scriptures.
Questions were put to the reverend
speakers and answered, evidently to the
great enlightenment of those present. A
very pleasant repast followed the dis
cussions, which was greatly enjoyed:

WOMAN'S DEFECTIVE MEMORY
LEADS TO AN ACQUITTAL
Swears yesterday shipped crews on the
Ships Dundonald and Loch Torridon, and
many of the men were brought to him by
erstwhile members of the sailor trust.
Six of them were taken from the Sailors'
Home. The shipping of crews for foreign
if hips has been placed in Swears' hands,
and for the time being blood money is a
thing of the past, and Jack, as well as his
master, will have an open chance for a
equaxe deal.
The ships Orion and Peter Iredale, for
â¢which Barneson was agent, were ready
for sea. Trying to get a crew through
the usual channels, he was informed that
a bonus of $30 a man would have to be
paid.
Barneson objected. /
The pallor trust, strong in its imagined
monopoly, replied: "All rtgrht; If you
don't take them now at $30 they will cost
you $35 later on. and the longer you wait
the more expensive we will make it."
Barneson sent for Swears, who informed
him that he would undertake to get all
the sailors â¢wanted through the regular
channels?, from which he supplied his
rteamshlp clierte. Swears shipped full
complements on the Orion and Peter
Iredale and sent tho men on- board In
Charge of watchmen. The watchmen
Â¦were selected on account of their physical
responsibility, and when the trust board
ing-house men tried to steal the Swears
shipped crews they were accorded a re
ception that few of them will forget In
a hurry.
The trust went to pieces.
The sailor trust has been broken. Blood
money In this port is a thing of the past.
Captain John Barneson, former marine
superintendent of the army transport
ecrvlcÂ© and now San Francisco agent for
a number of British ehlpowners, has
achieved success, where a long line of
British Consuls anfl United States Judges
have scored disheartening failures. . For
Â«i>out the first time in the history of this
port the shipping of crews for foreign
calling vessels has been placed on a busi
ness basis. Captain Barneson's success
Is due largely to the co-operation of Will
lam B. Swears, the shipping master who
eupplles crews to the Pacific Mail and
other ete&xnsb!r> companies.
The sailor boarding-house men some
little time ago formed a combination for
the exaction of as high a rate of blood
money as the demand for men would
warrant.
After November 15, however, all will be
changed, and the traveling public, thanks
to President Spear, will^come again into
its own fair share of untainted air.

The smell arising from the Wells-Fargo
storerooms at the ferry depot has been a
source of annoyance to the traveling pub
lic ever since the new ferry depot went
Into commission. Protests were plentiful,
but all they accomplished until President
Spear took the matter In hand was to

When President Charles Spear took his
place at the head of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners he declared his in

big, new ferry depot. In a notice issued
yesterday to the Wells-Fargo Express
Company he has taken the last and' most
Important step in this direction. All the
sweeping and scrubbing of an army of
janitors availed little in the direction of
sweetness while the great common car
rier maintained between the ferry slips
a storehouse for odorous live stock, and
loud-smelling fish, fieeh and fowl.
The fact that many of the teeth of the
dead man were fiHed with gold Is the
only clew that may lead to the identifica
tion of the body.
The records of missing men of the Coro
ner's office and the Police Department
were examined yesterday, but none of the
descriptions tallied with that of the dead
man.
The color of the hair and eyes is brown
and the man was evidently clean shaven
at the time of his death. He had small
ears and a number of gold crowned teeth.
The action of the waves In dashing the
body against the rocks had disfigured the
remains. The scalp was torn away, the
face was crushed in and there was a deep
laceration of the chin.
The bodv had evidently been In the
water about three days, but no Identifi
cation mark could be found w^ien the re
mains were examined at the Morgue.
The man was evidently about 40 years
of age at the time of his death, weighed
ISO pounds and was 5 feet 10^4 inches in
height. The body was nude, wfch
the exception of a pair of new shoes and
gray woolen seeks, a standing collar, size
nVz. and a gray and white four-in-hand
tie.
The body was first discovered by a
woman who was walking on 'the beach
and the Coroner's, office was notified. The
Morgue officials had some trouble In con
veying the body to their wagon, being
compelled to carry the remains for three
blocks.
The body of a man was found float
ing in the water yesterday morning near
Bakers Beach and the circumstances sur
rounding the case are puzzling the offi
cials of the Coroner's office.
Seaman James Allwood was first placed
on the stand and made the statement that
none of the women nor any one in the
port lifeboat had life preservers on. IIÂ©
said, though, that there were plenty In
the boat.
This statement of Allivood's is a direct
contradiction to Bruce's statement that
he put life preservers on the women him
self; also a contradiction of previous
statements made by the captain and tha
second officer.
Allwood had charge of the after fall of
the port boat. He says that the rope did
not kink or Jam in the cleat whfn tho
boat was lowered. Mate Bruce in his tes
timony stated that the rope had Jammed
and that this was the cause of the capsiz
ing of tha boat.
The seaman further testified that there
was but a light breeze and the sea had
only a medium swell. He said thera
was considerable excitement among tha
passengers when the vessel struck.
"The ship was going ahead." said All
wood, "and it was her headway that
caused the boat to capsize. The moving
of the vessel caused the boat's bow to
sheer oft and the after tackle being not
unhooked she capsized."
In. reply to a question from Inspector
Bulger the seaman said that it was his
opinion that if the ship had not been
moving the after block could have beea
cast off.
Allwood like all the rest examined in
the case, did not know his station in
case of disaster. He said he saw no one
in the starboard boat or near it after
she capsized. Second Officer Ravens had
testified that there were four men In
her at the time.
Allwood had been on board the South
Portland for one month and during that
time no lifeboat drills were held.
When asked how he knew the ship was
going ahead, the seaman replied that ha
could see the wake, and when the people
were thrown Into the water they were
carried rapidly astern.
Ole Gunderson, another seaman, was
next placed on the stand. It was with
great difficulty that the inspectors drag
ged any, information from him. He coi:'.<1
not understand the questions, and when
he did make answer it was so irrelevant
as to be of no value.
Two things he was sure ofâ the vessel
was going ahead and the sea was mod
erately calm.
Second Mate Ravens was then rigidly
questioned by Inspector Bulger In an en
deavor to ascertain whether any one was
In the starboard boat when it was launch
ed. He made the statement that the star
board boat was never launched. He said:
""When the forward tackle was released
the boat swung around on the after tac
kle. By this time the boat was half in
the water. I hung on to the after tackla
until the sea went away from under tha
boat. That cleared her of the water in,
her, and I lowered her down again so
that she wouldn't fill up. and she un
hooked and drifted away."
"Do you know whether the painter was
fast or not?" asked Mr. Bulger.
"I passed It to some one on the lower
deck, with orders to make It fast. I don't
know whether that was done."
"How much of a sea was there when
you stood on the submerged raft waist
deep? And how was it that the sea did
not wash off the passengers who wero
sitting down on it?"
"It was a moderate sea. They were
hanging on."
At this juncture the investigation was
continued until this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
Seaman Allwood testified that If the
ship had been lying still when tha
boats were- launched they would not have
capsized. He said the women had no Ufa
preservers en. , He also contradicted Mate
Bruce's former statement and said that
the tackle en the port lifeboat did not
Jam.
One of the sailors had such a meager
knowledge of the English language that
it was next to Impossible to get him to
understand anything. Second Mate
Ravens seemed to forget that he was on
trial before United States officials and
did everything in his power to hamper tha
work of Inspectors Bolles and Bulger.
All of his answers were evasive and he
antagonized every effort of the inspec
tors to get at the facts concerning
the wreck of the steamer and the loss
of more than a score of lives.
The investigation Into the wreck of the
steamer South Portland was continued
yesterday before United States Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger. Two seamen and the
second matf> were examined.

NEW YORK BONDS.
Several letters have been received by the
State board taking up the cause of the com
mission men and the tendency of their argu
ment is toward a defense of thÂ« men who
handle the product. The investigation, while
Instituted in the Interest of the grower with
the purpose of helping him obtain the b#st
possible prices for his product, will t>e carried
on from an absolutely impartial standpoint,
with a view toward aso;rtaimrs accurately thÂ«
exact conditions existing and establishing by
comprehensive data any conclusion that may
be arrived at. The State bcarrl does* not start
out with a fixed purpose to prove some ore
particular cause of conditions of which com
plaint Is made, but on the contrary, to first,
by full investigation, establish as a ti<:< just
what the conditions actually are. and then, by
farther Investigation, determine the fault, and
if possible, provide a remedy. It has already
become evident that, to accomplish adequate
results, the Investigation must be very thor
ough and comprehensive, and carried on from
an unprejudiced standpoint. The Interest al
ready manifest is decidedly encouraging and
premises valuable assistance.
Next Tuesday afternoon the State Board
of Trade will consider a report to b# sub
mitted by Manager Brl&gs relative to an
investigation of the manner in which Cal
ifornia fruit is marketed in San Francisco
I and al3o in the distributing centers of the
Eastern States. Mr. Brigsa was instruct
ed by the board some time ag>> to make
a report dealing with the feasibility of
] having the entire subject of marketing
Investigated and also to report concerning
the probable cost of such a search for
facts. The producers have received a pro
: portionately small part of the money ac
| tually received for their fruits when sold.
! The reasons are sought by the State
Board of Trade.
The fruit marketing season cf 1303 ij
j practically ended. .For this reason it Is
' probable that the investigation by the
State Board -of Trade will begin in. thU
city. Al! Information that Is possible will
be gathered here arid may form the basis
of a separate report later, as the Eastern
and San Francisco marketing proposition*
have no Immediate connection, being han
dled by entirely different parties. Work
in the East can hardly begin until an
other season. It will be. here and In the
East, possible to trace shipments of fruit
and to ascertain Just what pries is re
ceived for them and to learn all their his
tory from the time they leave the hands
of the producers until some return U
Â¦ made fcr them by the commission men.
Manager Briggs makes the following
statement: l
Late mail advices from New York say:
"The situation In Raisins Is practically the
same." the business doing being of the tamo
proportions as noced yesterday. There is like
ly to be no change in prices, so long as the
present contracts hold. Sultanas are going
out freely at the present low prices. The
coast market on Prunes la . a shade weaker.
There Is li!t!e spot business doing, though the
export demand- continues very Fatlsfactory.
The Currant market is easy at 4^c, though
some holders claim to be getting 5c for small
lots There is little or no change in Apricots

SEEKING THE GODDESS OF FORTUNE.
.. We yesterday told of the poet's sad plight.
But the rescuers came, and a terrible fight
Rased around the verse man, till at last his red Joes
To the hunting: ground went where the good Indian goes.
So he's with us again, and to-day he will tell
To the lad In the sketch and to others as well
That Dame Fortune f s address may be found in The Call,
Where the fair fickle goddess gives welcome to all.
So If you would woo her and bask in her smile
Look over our Want Ads â you'll find it worth while.WASHINGTON*. Nov. S.â The Director of the

'IN QUARTERLY SESSION
For some time complaints have been
made to the police by the management of
the hotel that a clever thief had been
operating in the hostelry, and Detectives
Ryan and Taylor were detailed on . the
case. H. S. Salt, president of the Califor
nia Electrical Works, lost a valuable pis
tol, and Arthur Burton, another guest,
reported that a gold watch and chain had
been taken from his room.
Yesterday Comely entered the room of
C. J. Wilder of the Southern Pacific
Company and no doubt fearing that some
one was trying to enter by the door made
his escape down a waterpipe on the out
side of the building. He was seen in his
descent by the landlady, who immediately
notified the Dolice. ... Â« . . . .
The arrest followed and a search af the
room occupied by thf lad at 2162 Pine,
where his mother is employed as a do
mestic, brought to light all of the plun
der stolen from the hotel. Comely has
been employed at the hotel for several
months and prior to that time was ap
prentice in the navy. He will undoubted
ly be sent to some reform institution^
Albert Comely, a 16-year-old bellboy
employed at the Hotel Westminster, 614
Sutler street, was arrested last night by
Detectives ityan and Taylor and his
name registered on the detinue book at
the City Prison. Comely, though young
in years, bids fair to become an accom
plished criminal If not checked In his
career at this time.

Lad, Is Accused of Several
Crimes.

The petition sets forth that on Novem
ber 2, the company served notice upon him
of cancellation of the policies which it
held upon his life, and made him a tender 1
of the amount of premiums he had paid -j
and interest thereupon, amounting to $33,- ]
0C3, and that this tender was refused. The
tender is therefore made to the court,
and it Is petitioned that Blair be required
to appear in court to answer the charges,
but not under oath, the petitioners speci
fically waiving requirement of an oath.
. Papers summoning Blair to court were
given to a United States Deputy Marshal
late to-day,and he departed for the Blair
home to serve them.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 5. â In the United
States Court to-day the Mutual Life In
surance Company of Kfew York filed an
application for the cancellation of two
life Insurance policies ag-gregatingr $250,000
carried toy the company upon the life of
James I* Blair.
The company charges that the policies
were secured through fraudulent repre
sentations. The petition further charges
that Blair attempted to take his own
life on October 15 and Octover 31,. and
defraud the company of the amount of
the policies.
The petition also charges that Blair,
for ten years, during which time he was
attorney for the company, deceived the
company by representing that he enjoyed
an income of $100,000 a year; that he was
a capitalist and able ta ptfy the pre
miums.

FOR GEORGE W. RUMBLE
Out on Bonds the Accused .Remains
Invisible When Wanted by the
Court. .
United States Marshal Shine is on a
still hunt for George W. Rumble, the
mining operator, who was recently
Indicted by the Federal Grand Jury for
using the mails with intent to defraud.
When Rumble was held to answer before
the Grand Jury by United States Court
Commissioner Heacock he was placed un
der bonds of $3000 furnished by a surety
company to guarantee his appearance on
December 1. After Rumble was indicted
United States District Judge de Haven
issued a bench warrant for his arrest.
In. such cases it is customary for the
accused to appear for identification and
for the sitting of new bonds, but Rumble
has not appeared. His bond of $3000 will
hold him until forfeited by the court, on
December 1, should he fail to appear on
that day. . .-
LABOR UNIONS TO GIVE
"THANKSGIVING BALLS
Justice of the Peace Daniels gave judg
ment yesterday in favor of the West
Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company,
which was sued for $299 damages for al
leged breach t of contract by F." G. Wil
son, assignee of ' the Stewart â¢ Menzies
Company. The decision Is an important
one, involving as it does a large number
of stevedoring contracts for vessels to ar
rive and belonging to the defendant cor
poration. The plaintiff's attorney was
Nathan Frank and the navigation com
pany was represented by W. S. Goodfel
low.
The testimony disclosed that the Stew
art Menzies Company- had- a contract with
the company to do the stevedoring on the
ship Clumberhall, with the proviso that
this arrangement should..be satisfactory
to the charterers, Balfour, Guthrle & Co.
The plaintiff expressed its willingness to
do the stevedoring, but Balfour. Guthrie
& Co. refused to let the Stewart Menzies
Company do the work. The latter al
leged that the reason for the refusal was
that Balfour, Guthrie & Co. is^ one of
four members of the San Francisco Steve Â¦
doring Company, which is seeking to es
tablish a monopoly of the . business to
the exclusion of other .stevedoring com,
panics. â¢ ' * . â¢
The defendant pointed to the proviso
that the contract 'for the stevedoring
should be satisfactory to the charterers,
who held that it was not because the
Stewart Menzies Company is a competitor
in a business 1 in which Balfour, Guthrie
& Co. desired to establish a supremacy.
The attorney for the plaintiff gave no
tice of an appeal. and expresses his in
tention to carry the case to the court of
last resort.
Judge Daniels gave judgment In favor
of N. R. Norton, a park policeman, sued
by F. J. Castlehun for $299 damages for
alleged false imprisonment. Castlehun
sued for $5000, but waived all but $299 se
as to bring the suit in the Justice's Court.
The testimony showed that Castjehun
was ordered Â«â¢ - a" footpath in the park
by - Norton, who told him to make his
exit by way of Ninth avenue. "Castlebun
refused -to obey orders and dared the offi
cer to arrest him which he promptly did.
Judge Daniels held that Norton was act
ing under orders from the Park Commis
sioners, who derive their powers from the
charter. . . .*-

The plan of the policemen is to require
each citizen who prefers charges against
any of 'the 1 . force' to put up..a ibond of at
least 5200. This bond will not interfere
with the administration of justice in any
manner, but will discourage the filing of
char,geÂ»wlthout strong proof. Should the
chargesAe proven, the bondsmen will be
released, but should the accuser fall to
substantiate his complaint, he. must pay
the expenses of the ca- out of his bond.
The plan meets with -universal approval
and will not refer to charges brought by
superior officers in matters of neglect of
duty. Just what course will .be followed
has not yet been decided upon, but each
officer will subscribe Jl to the proposed
fund.
The members of the San Francisco police
propose to avoid the necessity of having"
to appear before the Police Commission
ers on malicious and groundless charges
brought by citizens. A fund is to be
created for, the purpose .of defraying the
cost of the employment of two first-class
attorneys whose duty it shall be to frame
and urge the passage of an ordinance or
police regulation that will fit the case.
On many occasions during the last two
years false charges of various sorts hare
been preferred against patrolmen and the
accused have been put to the necessity
of employing, counsel a.nd of going to
much expense, to make a defense. When
the mutters have been brought fo a hear
ing, the charges have been iound to be
faulty and in many cases inspired by mal
ice, anU" the | defendants have been ac
quitted.' '

The next- great question* that confronts the
people of Ban Francisco relates -to the com
mercial relations of the city by the sea. - There
Is an impression, and it Â» is . gaining â¢ ground
everywhere, that the construction of the Xicar
aguan canal will ; leave this city out; . that it
will deprive this city of its â¢ present advanta
geous position on the commercial map .of the
world. San Francisco owes it to itself - to' see
that proper representation of Its interests -be
made. I have seen a map prepared by Cap
tain Sigsbee of battleship Maine fame which
shows that San Francisco is on the route and
the distance 1h shortest between the city' and
Yokohama. Every mile you sail north of San
Francisco makes the. distance' greater, and. this
must be shown to the. world in order to pro
tect San Francisco against the. false assump
tion that Â«he ' is Â¦ to " be ' the loser by 'the con
struction . of the iÂ«tbrnlan canal. Los Angeles
is farther east than this city anil the distance
between that city and New York, is 'shorter,
but the kbsencc of .a .deep, sea harbor . makes
that advantage 1 useless. ~ which ' is easily- un
derstood by people interested in. such, things.
San Francisco can show. Its progress at. the
fair. There are -many devices by which it can
ehow its buildings and, streets. The Important
question Is the plan of meeting. the competition
of Loa Angeles and | Seattle . and , that . which
they will offer in the way of taking advantage
cf the great advertising opportunity which
will not come again ' in Â¦- many years. Â¦; It .will
be another ' twenty-flve - years : before' another
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
Chairman Symmes called upon W. â¢ V.
Mills to give his views on the matter and
the latter delivered an interesting talk.
He eald In part:
The rivalry that exl*U among the '.Pacific
Coast cities Is growing keener every day. Â¦ Se
attle is your chief rival and her citizens are
trying to prove her commercial importance and
that their city is the .ultimate point of dis
tribution by ocean and land. . LoÂ« Angeles Is
aUo going to be a formidable rival. They
propose to eend on moving pictures of the fiesta
and of President ItooÂ»evelt from there. I Tour
chairmen has indicated to some extent* the
necessity of San Francisco making 1 a showing.
I suggested at a . previous meeting that we
send on a raised map of the harbor, of 'San
Francisco and the country' arOund ; it, to show
Us commercial importance.- A -raised map 8x12
feet, made of plaster of parts, trill answer.
Every street .In -the city could be indicated.
That map will have a- permanent value and
could be put In the ' rotunda' of the City -Hall
and could be sent to exhibitions when neces
sary. . ' â¢ * Â¦ t Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦
There iw-ins to be a strong impression among
the merchants that Ran? Francisco- should not
allow itself to be neg'ectrd at the exposition.
Various .counjie.s.. pu.tside ' of this city have
taken action long ago. A number of them
have levied .special tares in. order that they
may be. properly represented. Loa Angeles has
appropriated $30, C00 and other counties have
appropriated large eums in order that their
agricultural and industrial products- may be
exhibited. We' have '-some things that "are of
equal Importance to' us. . We have a great
harbor and great facilities for handling busi
ness from a commercial point of view. Those
features ought not to be neglected and if the
northern and southern cities are to ' make
themselves known, it certainly seeme neces
sary that we shojJld *do so. If for no other
reason than that we . should ' not be behind
them. Â¦ *
Moet of you know the purposes' for which
this meeting is called. It has been generally
considered by tho^e who give any thought to
the matter that San Francisco should have
some positive representation at the" St. Louis
World's Fair. At a meeting of the presidents
of the various commercial organizations. â¢ held
some days ago. fifty gentlemen were appoint
ed a committee to look into the matter. The
purifies or 'this meeting, are to consider the
desirability and Importance .of providing -a
proper lepresentation of the city of San Frfin^
cisco at the St. Louis Exposition and to-.take
such stepB as you may deem wise In connec
tion therewith.
Frank J. Symmes, president; of the Mer
chants' Association, was elected chairman
and Louis M. King/ secretary of the
Merchants' Association, secretary. Chair
man Symmes said: . *
The meeting of representatives of the
various commercial organizations, held In
the rooms of the Chamber of. Commerce
yesterday, was an enthusiastic one. Such
leading ! citizens as ex-Mayor Pond,
Charles S. Laumelster', Frank J. Symmes,
W. H. Mills. H. U. Brandenstein, A. Sbar
boro, Joseph. Hyman, J. .P. Currier and
others were at the meeting-- dnd took an
active part in the discussion. -
There was not a dissenting voice in the
entire gathering. Every merchant and
banker present saw the importance of the
scheme and they were unanimous In their
willingness to help the cause.
SYJOIES MADE CHAIBMAN.
SAN FRANCISCO will raise $40,000
in order that this city and county
may be fittingly represented at tHe
World's Fair in St. Louis. The
money will be raised by subscrip
tion. The merchants are alive to the
importance of raising this money, as
they see the absolute necessity of adver
tising Greater San Francisco to the
world. The action of the citizens of
Seattle and Los Angeles in subscribing
large sums for exhibition purposes has
spurred the business mtn of this com
munity and they are already actively en
gaged In putting forward the plan that
will bring the best results to the city.
: The 'question arose how. the money
should be- raised and Mr. Friedlander
moved that a committee of five, composed
of E. B. Pond, Irving F. Moulton, Joseph
Sloss, 1J. 17. Brandenstein and Charles S.
Laumelster, bet appointed and they be
empowered to suggest the ways and
means for raising the money. The com

COMMITTEE APPOINTED.
f Mr. Jennings wanted to know if the city
â¢and county might not subscribe the sum
or a. portion of it , out of the emergency
fund, but Supervisor Brandenstein said
the charter did not give the Supervisors
the. power.
Commissioner Filcher was present and
gave his views. He said he could not
tell then how much space would be allot
ted the various counties, but he might
know to-day: He suggested a . moving
picture of the harbor of Sari Francisco,
showing the hundreds of deep water ships
at the wharves and In the stream. He
said the State had been allowed 24,000
square feet In the Agricultural building
and space in other buildings. Mr. Filcher
paid he stood ready to give all the space
San Francisco would need to make a cred
itable showing.
After Mr. FUcher had given the commit
tee his. ideas in the matter. T. Carey
Friedlander made a motion that it be the
sense of the meeting that an exhibit be
made/ The motion was adopted and the
matter of raising money was taken up.
Mr. Pond said that at a previous meeting
It was decided that $10,000 could be raised,
but he was of the opinion that twice that
sum could be raised and if the committee
Jjad too much it could be returned to the
Mr. Sbarboro was In favor
"of securing Â£50.000. Mr. Mills made a mo
tion to that effect and after some discus
sion Mj\ Sbarboro thought $40,000 would
be necessary. His amendment was ac
cepted and the committee agreed to raise
that large sum to place an adequate ex
hibit at the exDdsltion..
San Francisco owes it to herself to see that
it gets its share of the visitors who are com
ing from all parts of the globe. The common
impression is that only curiosity seekers at
tend an exposition. All the great writers, men
seeking material for writers, economists, geog
raphists and thinkers of the world are there,
making an intelligent Inquiry, and the etory
that is told by the great exhibit itself is the
story that is believed. San Francisco must
no: have a small exhibit. If it is going to
have a space 10x12 we don't want to do any
thing. San Francisco must have as much
space as the counties that have, large horti
cultural exhibits, because San Francisco pays
its percentage of the tax.
WANTS A BIG EXHIBIT.

.James O'Neil, an ex-convict, was ' ar
rested last night by the police and his
name entered on the detinue book at the
City Prison. The arrest was made at Oc>
tavia and Clay streets by four officers
who recognized O'Neil as an ex-convict
and figured that he could not be in that
neighborhood- with any good intentions.
The prisoner was taken to the Hall of
Justice and the Detective Bureau is of
the opinion that he is the porch .climber
who has been operating successfully In
the Western Addition. The Chief of De
tectives examined him at length, but was
unable to force a confession of guilt from
him. Nothing' of an incriminating nature
was found In his possession and he will
be held pending an investigation, although
it is admitted that there is absolutely no
evidence to connect him with the eight
porch climbing jobs reported to the po
lice. A strenuous endeavor will be made
by the entire detective force to secure
the evidence necessary to Insure a con
viction. O'Neil is a eon of an e*-police
man and has served two terms for bur
glary and one for another felony.

are employed by the Wine Association,
after cuittir.K work on Friday afternoon
went to Gnodyear's -room- at 603 Third

and Clifford left Goodyear' p room to go

rolling to the bottom. He was uncon
scious for about two minutes and blood
was pouring from his nose. After that
he recovered and he and Holderbegger
walked two blocks, but Clifford was so
demonstrative that Holderbegger left him.
Clifford reached his home and his wife
alleges that he immediately became un
conscious, after telling her that he had
been sandbagged.
After a thorough investigation Detec
tives Freel and Bunner have come to the
conclusion that John Clifford, a cellar
man employed by the California Wine
Association on Second and Bryant streets,
was accidentally killed. It was reported
that be was sandbagged on last Friday

POLICE SAY CLIFFORD'S
DEATH WAS ACCIDENTAL
Lane is supposed to be possessed of a
l:ir?e fortune, which, rumor has it, he
kf-ops In his house. The burglar had
evidently heard of the tales of hidden
riches and effected an entrance to the
house of the hermit when the latter was
supposed to be away. Lane, however,
retired unusually early that night and
thwarted the plans of the daring porch
climber.
David Lane, the old retired sea cap
tain who attained a great deal of un
pleasant notoriety a few years ago, had
a thrilling experience with a burglar
last Wednesday night. The old captain,
who is past the tour-score mark, fought
ihe housebreaker till he fell exhausted,
l.ut !i:_Tjly managed to scare him from
i he premises.
Lane Is a recluse and lives the life of
;i hermit in an ancient, weather-beaten
house at the corner of Dupont and Chest
nut streets. According to his own story,
he had retired early Wednesday evening,
und shortly after 7 o'clock was awakened
by some one walking about his room. :
The aged mariner jumped out of bed
in a twinkling and found himself face to
facs with a big, burly burglar. . The lat
trr immediately made a rush at his
feeble oponent. at the same time
threatening to beat him to death if he
uttered a word. â¢
Lane, however, was game and grap
pled with his husky antagonist and
fought till he fell to the floor from utter
exhaustion. The burglar then took to
his heels and made a hasty exit, while
the old man lay helpless on the floor.
Lane says the burglar succeeded in
Cutting away with a purse containing be
twtcn J3 50 and |4. He secured this be
fore the old captain awoke. The ancient
Foarrian adds that the burglar, was one
of the porch climbing fraternity and
that he had gained entrance to the house
bjr climbing through a side window from
the porch.
POLICE THINK THEY HAVE
PORCH CLIMBER IN CUSTODY
Â¦ Among the applicants for Justice of the
Peace to succeed Percy Long, elected City
Attorney, are Charles A. Low, Isadore
Golden, John Koch, who was defeated at
last year's election . for tne office;^ San
iord Feigenbaum and H. L. Joachlmsen,
a former Justice of the Peace.
The friends of Oscar Hocks,' who was
beaten sixty-four votes by Robert Lough
ery, the eighteenth Supervisor elected,
claim to have made discoveries that will
entitle their man to the seat in the board.
In the sheet of lotal returns of the Sev
enth precinct of the Thirty-first district.
Hocks la not credited with any votes, and
it is charged that the election officers ne
glected to enter Hocks' total vote as taken
from the tally sheets. As Braunhart
polled forty-eight votes, in this precinct
and John Barnett twenty-four, it is
calculated that Hocks received at least
thirty. votes, which will reduce Loughery'a
lead to thirty-four votes. Charles Hol
comb. claims, to have knowledge of other
irregularities that will overcome Lough
ery's small lead. This, however, will riot
be determined until the official count is
completed. The Registrar cannot go be
hind the returns; as they were made by
the election officers. It. is a fact that the
vote for Loughery and Hocks shows but a
small difference.
,, It is common gossip at the City Hall
that Mayor Schmltz will reappolnt Law
rence F. Walsh a member of the Board
of Education to succeed himself, his term
expiring January 8 next. Thomas Rea

Election Commissioner, has the inside
track for Commissioner of Public Works
to succeed Marston . Manson, but
there is a charter provision- that an Elec
tion Commissioner cannot- hold another
office until one year after his retirement
from the Election Commission, but a way
may be found out of this difficulty.
G. B. Benham, president of the Labor

ONLY A SUGGESTION.
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense Trouid suggest that if
o:ie wishes to become fleshy and plump
It can only result from the food we eat
and direst and that food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
essa, beefsteak, and cereals; In other
v.-orda the kinds of food that make flesh
nre tte foods which form the- greater
jjart of our dally bills of fare. '
But the trouble is that while we eat
<nouÂ£h and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not properly digest and assimilate It.
which Is the reason so many people re-
main thin and under weight; the digest-
ive organs do not completely digest the
:cod forming beefsteak and eggs and
-imilar wholesome food.
There are thousands- of such who are
ifstlly confirmed dyspeptics, although
â¢!iey may have no particular pain or In-
convenience from their stomachs.
!f such persons would lay their preju-
OUxs aside and make a regular practice
Â«>f taking, after each meal, one or two
Â«>f Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the food
would be quickly and thoroughly dlgest-
ed. because these tablets contain the
natural peptones and diastase which
every weak stomach lacks, and by sup-
jilying this want the stomach is soon
enabled to reach its natuaoi tone and
vipor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest
every form of flesh forming food.' meat,
Â« Kgs. bread aj*l potatoes, and this is the
i viison they â¢ eo quickly build up
t-t lengthen and invigorate thin, dyspep-
tic men. women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
â¢lelicate, use them with .marked benefit
;s they contain no strong, Irritating
i'.ru?s, no cathartic nor any harmful ln-
Â¦ Krodient.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the most
Fuecessful and most widely known of
c.ny remedy for stomach .troubles be-
cause it is the most reasonable and sci-
entific of modern medicines. â¢
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by every druggist in the United States
and Canada as well as In Great Britain,
at 60 cents for complete treatment.
Nothing further is required to cure
any stomach trouble or to make thin,
nervous dyspeptic people, strong, plump j
