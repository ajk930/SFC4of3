LONDON, Aug. 14.â The Daily Mail this
morning declared that the appointment of
Vice Admiral Alexieff as Viceroy of the
Amur district and Kwantung province is
most important, as it indicates the tri
umph of M. de Wltte. -the Russian
Finance Minister, and the policy, of peace
over General Kuropatkin, the Minister of
War. and that it Is. a significant step
toward the settlement of the existing dif
ferences both with China and Japan. The
Daily Mail says that there has existed for
years a sharp division In the- Cabinet
over the Far Eastern policy, and , that
General Kuropatkin and a majority of
the Ministers insisted that the actual an
nexation of Manchuria should be secured
immediately at any cost of money or
credit. On the other hand. M. de Witte
steadily opposed taking; any step -to pre
cipitate hostilities between Russia and
any other power in the East. He is con
fident that time only is needed to bring:
about all that Russia desires in Man
churia, and as Chancellor of the Ex
chequer he is anxious ,to secure . the
benefits of annexation at the least pos-
Blble cost. So sharp was the dissension
between the two parties that when Gen
eral Kuropatkin visited the Far East he
avowed his Intention not to set foot in
Manchuria, declaring that it was M. de
Wltte's affair, and not his.

to the Korean Government against tho

donian leaders exprea* themselves aa
greatly disappointed, with what they as
sert is the distinctly hostile attitude of
America toward their cause, as manifest
ed in the utterances of the press. Dr.
Christo Tartarcheff. one of the presidents
of the Central International Macedonian
Committee, said to-day that his party was
convinced that American newspapers had
.been bought with Turkish, gold.
"There seems to be no other .explana
tion of the tone of. their articles." he said.
"They are not only unsympathetic toward
the movement, but decidedly Inimical to
It. -It is impossible that such an attitude
could arise from ignorance of the trua
state of, affairs- In a country so intelligent
as America, and it Is also, difficult to be
lieve that the Impression created bj- the
Miss Stone affair could have so preju
diced the -American press.
1 "In. regard, to the present situation, only
real intervention by the powers catj, stop
the fighting of th$ insurgents. Falling in
such intervention, the campaign will be
prosecuted to the bitter end. The band
now fighting in the vilayet of Monastir
consists of 9000 to 10.000 men, mostly youns
and erthusiastlc and trained in the use of
arms. Their number could be quadrupled'
were It not that the difficulty of feeding
such an army renders its Increase inad
visable. The Turkish ''troops are badly
clothed and demoralized. They have re
peatedly refused to march against the in
surgents, who are well supplied with
arms and ammunition, chiefly purchased
from Turkish soldiers, who sold their guns
for cash almost within sight of the bar
racks of Monastir.

LONDON. Aug. 13.â The Associated
Press correspondent learns on high Rus
sian authority that tho establishment of
a viceroyalty for the Amur district and
Kwangtung province will not affect the
evacuation of Manchuria in October. For
some time Russian has been considering
the advisability of placing the control of
all her Far Eastern territory and Manchu
ria under one head, instead of three, as
at present. As long" as the Russian occu
pation of Manchuria shall last Viceroy
Alexicff will be in charge and will com
mand the troops in that region, but when
the evacuation shall occur he will simply
have control of the Port Arthur and Ta
lien Wan zone, through which the rail
road runs, in addition to the possessions
which are indubitably Russian.

Ij. it, tiii general belief here that the
men will #ow break up and take what
hirfces the} need, as the section Is full of
th'm. The mountains around them are
filled withjeampers and It would be an
easy mattej for them to pass through the
valley in tie night time, which Is only a
4tw miles from the Southern Pacific.
Around L*:e Tahoe the same condition
exists.. It â¢ 5 only a day's walk to the
Tallac cou try and from there to the
other^ point are easy Journeys. Terrell
Elates that :he men are well armed and
are in a laj i of plenty, as sheep camps
and cattle c mps are to be found on every
hand.* Ther teems to be no movement in
this section to aid In the capture of the
tecapes.
"They never left the road and cooked
Â¦ad sitpt in the road. The dogs carried
me through the brush and were hot on the
trail and had the posses stayed with the
animals there is no question that the
men would have been run to cover. After
Iravir.g the. posse I took the trail that
the hounds followed. They carried me
l>agt Kirkwoods and when there two of
Tlie original posse and myself found a
carcpf.re left by the convicts that was
Etffl rrtxkir.g and the hounds were fairly
uild to follow. He-re the two men desert
ed me and I came on alone.
"When I arrived at Ruffner's, a place
between Round -Top Mountain and Hope
Valley yesterday I" found the family ter
rified inside the house with most of their
clothes takea. Th.e house had been
cleaned out of grub of every description.
The people told me that the five con
victs had left about forty minutes ahead
cf me. The toM the Ruffners that on a
number of occasions the posse had been
within shooting distance. They said that
the day that we were at Kirkwoods and
] was ahead they had a bead on me and
only refrained from firing when the rest
<jf the posse came in tight. In speaking
of tjie hardships the convicts complained
to the Ruffnc-rs that the hounds had
caused them most of the worry, as they
had kept them moving most of the time.
They also complained of being exceeding
ly tired and exhausted.
HOT GIVEN ASSISTANCE.
One of the men was almost Fhoeleps and
had a piece of rope wound round his shoe
to keeji his foot from injury on the rocks.
The men that did the robbing at the Ruff
ncr place arc Heron, Woods, Murphy, Fa
bey and EldriSge, and as Fahey knows
the country he is probably the successful
pilot that carried them through the wil
derness. As near as I can now locate the
men would be in Upper Hope Valley or
near Round Top with all kinds of hiding
places. As soon as I located the vnr-n I
came to Wo/wJ fords, where I telephoned
to Markleevllle and the surrounding coun
try for help. Aa no one cam* to my aid
and it was a useless fight alone I con
c'uded to. come home with the dogs. I
am going back to Reno on this train and
if California wants the dogs or my ser
vices in the future she will have to fur
nish men that will stay when the finish
comes."
; The country that the men are now in
is one- of the roughest in the Sierra Ne
vadas and while it is extremely rough a
hundred eEcipes are open to the convicts.
Twenty-five miles to the north lies Lake
Valley, *hich leads to Lake Tahoe, to
the southwest is the Inyo and Mono
County trails, while to the extreme north
is Carscn '.Valley, which is a broad outlet
for the eitire country that leads to the
railroads. ]
ABANDON A HOT TRAIL.
"I know where the escapes are, or at
least five of them. They are between
Round Top and Hope Valley. I was with
in forty minutes of them. Wednesday and
if the California posses had not deserted
when wanted the men could easily have
been captured. When we got to Klrk
woodp the California posse left me. They
had enough of the country and from that
point on t.'-t roads rens such that, tins
posses could not ride.
CARSON*. Nev.. Aug. 13.â Officer C. P.
Ferrell of Reno, who has been on the
trail of the escaped Folsom. prisoners for
ihe last two weeks with the bloodhounds
from the Nevada penitentiary, arrived in
this city late this afternoon on the stage
from Woodfords, where he spent Wednes
day waiting for assistance from other
posses or officers of the State. None ar
rived and he packed the bloodhounds into
ihe> stage coach and came into this city,
where he left the hounds at the peni
tentiary.
Ferrell is worn out with the chase, but
has bad the satisfaction of locating the
five escapes and yesterday was within
forty minutes of a place they had robbed.
Ferrell carce from Kirkwoods alone and
r.as without assistance. He had to chain
the bloodhounds to himself to prevent
them tailing up the trail and dragging
him into the very midst of the desperate
men. f
In speaking of the late developments
l-'errell eaid:
TlÂ»en he drew- the, woman apart . and
conversed with her in low tones for some
time. -At ;Jast ' she departed.' r She ; was hot
eeeriabout the theater thereafter. , Of her
identity, no information was volunteered
by Barlow. ' '. ., Â¦.
' On July) 13 j. Barlow, and his wife .from
Charleston, . Mo., broke up housekeeping/
"Reggie, jdon't, you know your wife?"
Fhesaid appealingly, stretching her hands
toward the actor.
- Barlow was startled.
"Good God! where did you come from?"
he ejaculated,! ignoring the visitor's loving
gesture. - ....
In spite of the fact that Barlow, was in
his make-up, recognition 'on, the part of
the woman was instant.
Who the woman was no one but Barlow
knew. For all that the others knew
they appeared "out of blue," just as Bar
low himself had, some two years previous
ly. But as to: who she claimed to t>e,
there was no doubt left of that three min
utes after she had gained admittance to
the greenroorn of the theater one day dur
ing an afternoon performance and accost
ed Barlow as, he hurried to his dressing
room. Â¦" % Â»
Perhaps the faith of the little woman
would have . been staggered if she had
known of a scen^e that one other woman
In particular created, behind the theajter
Fix months after her marriage to Barlow.
Only a few persons witnessed this, but
they are unanimoits in saying that for a
married man Barlow appeared to poor
advantage'.
ANOTHER, ALLEGED WIFE.
Then domestic life began to pall upon
Barlow. Stories were told of divers af
fairs of the heart in which he figured
with other woman, for the moat part pa
trons of the theater. Such stories did not
disturb Mrs. J3arlow from Charleston.
Mo. When repeated to her by neighbors'
gossip she was wont to say, calmly, that
she knew other women admired her hus
bandâindeed, it was not to be wondered
at; but that her husband should deign. to
care for other women was a very foolish
notion and; nobody . could make her be
lieve it.
Barlow and his bride went to housekeep
ing at 212 Leavitt street. Their honey
moon was very happy. < Barlow appeared
to have sincere affection for his wife and
the little country bride was completely
enamored of her good-looking actor hus
band.
Barlow, then, was indeed married. A
year or so before, then a member of the
Hosmer Company, he had spent a vaca
tion of a 'week or so in Charleston, Mo.,
returning to Chicago with a pretty little
country girl, whom he introduced as his
bride. They had been married at Charles
ton after a courtship as brief and roman
tic as that which, it seems, has just cul
minated in his 'marriage to Miss Merkel
of Milwaukee.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said Miss Hos
mcr, "I take great, pleasure in announc
ing that we have just had an addition to
our company. Reginald Barlow and his
wife are now the parents of a sweet little
girl baby. I wish to propose three cheers
for Mr. and Mrs. Barlow."
The cheers. were given with a will and
were followed by repeated calls for Bar
low and the baby. Barlow responded,
thanking his many friends in the audience
for the good will shown himself and fam
ily and expressing regret that It would be
necessary to delay the baby's first ap
pearance.
ACTOR BARXOW A FATHER.
CHICAGO, Aug. 13.â Three women claim
Reginald Barlow, the Chicago matineo
Idol, as husband. One is Miss Bertha
Merkel, a wealthy society glr^ of Mil
waukee, Wis., to whom dispatches from
Milwaukee say Barlow has just been mar
ried in Los Angeles after a romantic
courtship aboard a train. Another is the
daughter of a farmer, and the thirdâno
body knows but Barlow... .
The news that Reginald Barlow, late of
Millie Janies' "Little Princess" company
aO Powers' Theater, had married Miss
Bertha Merkel, a society girl of Milwau
kee, in Los Angeles came to Chicago to
dayâa crushing blow, no doubt, to the
devotees of the handsome young matinee
idol. Greater grief, however, is in store
for three women, who nowâ each .without
the others' knowledgeâ claim Barlow aa
husband.
That Barlow has thus committed big
amy by marrying Miss Merkel does not
admit, of a "doubt in the minds pf those
who knew him personally during his two
years' residence in Chicago. Indeed, that
he had once before committed the same
offense, though this is less capable of
pr.oof, is equally certain, according to the
came acquaintances.

The woman was found In her room
seemingly suffering from morphine poi

wherCshe died five hours later. The hos
pital physicians were willing to sign a
death certificate showing she had died
from morphfne poisoning, but the Coro
ner's autopsy showed that three of the
woman's ribs had been broken. Autopsy
Surgeon Campbell declared positively that
death had been caused by a blow over the
heart. Then the detectives took Into cus

friendly with the woman for two years.
It was ascertained that they had quar

fishermen are greatly aroused over the
actions of the captain of the Canadian

turned the vessel's guns on the American
tug Silver Spray, peppering the tug with
â¢shot Â»nd putting the crew In jeopardy.
The captain of the Petrel, it is alleged,
has run tnl.ifs with a high hand on this
end of ':.* lake for some time, and has
to intimidated Dunkirk fishermen that
they rarely approach within several miles
Ot the boundary, fearful that the Cana

capture and tow them to the Dominion
side, where their vessel would be confis

Although secrecy is being maintained
It has become known that several of the
captains are preparing to meet the cap

the Canadian cÂ«tter next tries tactics like
those performed yesterday. It is said to
lie not at all unlikely that shot will be

Captain Smith was last seen alive on
Tuesday. The following morning a cham
bermaid saw him lying on the bed, but
did not call him. This morning she no
ticed that his position had not changed
and she reported the matter. The body
was only partly dressed and beside it was
a bottle which had contained carbolic
acid. The, autopsy to-night showed that
he had taken several ounces of the dead
ly poison.
Captain Smith was 34 years of age, a
graduate of West Point, and during the
Spanish War served in the artillery
branch of the service. It is reported here
that during the war he became implicated
in some deal with persons who had con
tracts to sell the Government supplies
and that serious trouble might have re
sulted for him. His father-in-law in De
troit came to the rescue, however, and
he was placed on the retired,list, the rea
son assigned being ill health. He went to
Long Beach six months ago and stopped
at the Hotel Riviera. Recently his
money became exhausted and he sent a
draft for $75 East to pay his hotel bill.
The draft was returned unhonored and
soon thereafter Captain Smith left Long
Beach. His relatives In the East have
been notified of his death.
Even then, it was not known who the
man was, for in his preparations for
death he had destroyed every scrap of
paper and every other article which would
serve to reveal his identity. He had reg
istered at the hotef under the name of
James Wilson. Dr. T. G. Harriman of
Long Beach, for years a friend of the
dead man. to-night identified the body as
that of Captain Smith. Dr. Harriman
had been looking for Smith for some
time, for he had been missing from Long
Beach for more than a week. . *
Captain Smith first appeared at the
hotel August 1 and registered as James
Wilson. He* remained two days and then
left. Later he returned and paid his room
rent up to August 9, and on Sunday last
he told the clerk he was broke and asked
to be permitted to keep the room for a
day or two, until he could get some
money from the East. He was given a
much cheaper room and permitted to
stay. He sent and received several tele
grams, the contents of which are un
known. â¢

Mrs. Davis owes her life to the fact that
she could outrun her assailant and was
able to handle a rifle. The wounded man
Rives the name of John Stuck, and says

not avoid him, and instead of running
ehe seized the club. A desperate strug
gle for the club followed, the man try-
Ing to Jerk It from Mrs. Davis' hands
and she hanging on and at the same time
keeping out of reach of his hands. Sud
denly she released her hold on the club
and the tramp fell backward. This gave
her an opportunity to run and she started
for the house. The tramp seized a heavy
whip and started in pursuit, with the butt
end of the whip upraised ready to brain
her If he caught her.
Mrs. Davis outran him, and dashed into
the kitchen. In 'the corner of which she
knew her husband's rifle was standing.
Seizing the weapon, she turned Just aa
the man reached the door. She covered
him with the rifle and ordered him to
stop. He hesitated an Instant, and that

sprang toward her. With whip upraised,
he uttered an oath and said he would
kill her. The Instant he sprang forward

The trouble which has been brewing for
some time past at the French Hospital
between Dr. F. P. Canac-Marquls, the
hospital surgeon, and the head nurse. Miss
Keeley, came to a sudden termination
yesterday by the resignation of the latter.
What the real cause of the rumpus be

impossible- to learn, either from the par
ties in Interest or from the attaches at
the hospital.

charge stated that she had gone to spend

emphasis that Miss Keeley was still the*
matron and that she could not be removed
by the prejudices of superior officers. Fur
ther than that he refused to make any
statement, but Intimated that possibly
later on there might be developments.
Dr. Marquis retired early and refused
to be seen. Ills amanuensis said the doc
tor was worn out by his work of the past'
week, but that so far as Miss Keeley was
concerned Dr. Marquis begged to state
that that lady had just sent In her resig

discussion. Concerning the whys and
wherefores of Miss Keeley's resignation
the fair amanuensis had nothing to say.

ENGLISH BEYOND
MEDICAL SKILL
OWNERS MAY DIG
IN THE TUNNEL
The Western Federation have Been fit to com
pel a cessation of all labor In the district not
because of any grievance of their own against
the Ct^pple Creek operators, and for reasons
entirelr beyond our control. No ' more arbi
trary and unjustifiable action mars the annals
of organized labor, and we denounce It as an
outrage both against employers and employed.
Ab fast as . men can be secured our mining
operations will be resumed under former condi
tions, preference being given to former em
ployes, and all men applying for work will be
protected to the last degree. Â¦
It is not unlikely that within twenty
four hours rich mine owners and high
salaried mine managers will go Into* the
big bore to take the places of the men
called out to-day. '
There are now 4000 miners Idle In the
district. The mine owners and managers
to-day anhounced their determination to
reopen the mines as quickly as possible.
In their published announcement they
say:
on our working clothes and do the labor
ourselves," said President Samuel Ber
nard of the El Paso Mining Company,
which has the contract for digging the
tunnel.
The physician made the further sig
nificant statement: "The patient does not
respond to stimulants."
Vitality reached such a low ebb to
night that the situation was regarded as
most discouraging. With nothing to work
upon the physicians only labored In vain
to offset the debilitating effect3 of the
operation. The change for the wcrse was
marked . during the day and, as the
hours passed there were no hopeful symp
toms of reviving strength. Because of
the failure of favorable reaction to man
ifest itself the physicians feel that there
was little if any recovery from the oper
ation's shock. Mr. English has , failed
during the last forty-eight hours. There
appears to be no chance for a rally that
would give the attendants a ground for
belief at this crisis that the patient might
improve.
.- The operation was the second Mr. Eng
lish had undergone within a few months/
The first, for appendicitis, seemed to have
benefited him, but the return of the
trouble,' with ; other. Intestinal complica
tions, caused his case to assume a very
serious aspect , from the beginning.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
SALT LAKE. Utah, Aug. 13.â The Su
preme Court to-day aSrmed the verdict
of pullty of murder In the first degree
against Peter Mortensen and refused to
grant him a new trial. Mortensen was
found guilty of the murder of James R.
Hay. secretary of the Pacific Lumber
Company, whose body he burled In an
open field. The case attracted wide
spread attention on account the prom
inence of the Mormon belief in revela
tions took in the evidence presented, and
evidence of this character formed one of
the principal reasons advanced by Mor
tensen's attorneys in their petition to
the Supreme Court for a new trial.
James Sharp, father-in-law of the
murdered man. while being cross-Ques
tioned by counsel for the defense as to
his having charged Mortensen with the
crime made the following statement:
I charged Peter Mortensen Â¦with the murder
of ir.y ton-!n-!aw because I knew that he vu
puilty. God appeared to me by the Holy
Ghost and put the words of his spirit Into my
mouth. I had to utter them, for I knew they
â¢were true. I cannot and will not deny it here,
neither will I deny It when I meet my God
In the "..-.Â«Â¦; day.
This was not the only manifestation I re
ceived. On Tuesday noon I caw the trail of
blood leading from the railroad tracks to
where my scn-ln-law was buried. I saw it In
b. vision JuFt as plainly as when 1 afterward
v'slted the toot.
The refusal of the trial Judg% to
strike, out . this statement, which was
calculated. Mortensen's attorneys claim
ed, to prejudice the defendant's case in
the minds of the Mormon members of
the Jury, was made one of the principal
grounds for an appeal.
In ruling on this, the Supreme Court
held that, as every Mormon member of
the jury had stated that he did not be
lieve that Sharp had such a revelation,
and would not be influenced by it to re
turn a verdict against the defendant, j
and because of the further fact that the j
alleged revelation did not refer to any I
contested or disputed question In the !
case, as It was conceded that the body
of Hay was in fact found and dug up in
the vicinity, the court failed to see how !
the defendant's case was prejudiced by !
the testimony referred to. The fact that ;
the defense knew w*.at Sharp's testimony 'â¢
was to be ar.d that no motion was made
to exclude the testimony !s commented
upon.

between Dr. F. P. Canac-Marquls, the
hospital surgeon, and the head nurse. Miss
Keeley, came to a sudden termination
yesterday by the resignation of the latter.
What the real cause of the rumpus be
tween the contending parties has been is
impossible- to learn, either from the par
ties in Interest or from the attaches at
the hospital.

emphasis that Miss Keeley was still the*
matron and that she could not be removed
by the prejudices of superior officers. Fur
ther than that he refused to make any
statement, but Intimated that possibly
later on there might be developments.
Dr. Marquis retired early and refused
to be seen. Ills amanuensis said the doc

week, but that so far as Miss Keeley was
concerned Dr. Marquis begged to state
that that lady had just sent In her resig

discussion. Concerning the whys and
wherefores of Miss Keeley's resignation
the fair amanuensis had nothing to say.
Miss. Keeley Is said to have been very
popular at the hospital.

MEDICAL SKILL
OWNERS MAY DIG
IN THE TUNNEL
The Western Federation have Been fit to com
pel a cessation of all labor In the district not
because of any grievance of their own against
the Ct^pple Creek operators, and for reasons
entirelr beyond our control. No ' more arbi
trary and unjustifiable action mars the annals
of organized labor, and we denounce It as an
outrage both against employers and employed.
Ab fast as . men can be secured our mining
operations will be resumed under former condi
tions, preference being given to former em
ployes, and all men applying for work will be
protected to the last degree. Â¦
It is not unlikely that within twenty
four hours rich mine owners and high
salaried mine managers will go Into* the
big bore to take the places of the men
called out to-day. '
There are now 4000 miners Idle In the
district. The mine owners and managers
to-day anhounced their determination to
reopen the mines as quickly as possible.
In their published announcement they
say:
on our working clothes and do the labor
ourselves," said President Samuel Ber
nard of the El Paso Mining Company,
which has the contract for digging the
tunnel.
The physician made the further sig
nificant statement: "The patient does not
respond to stimulants."
Vitality reached such a low ebb to
night that the situation was regarded as
most discouraging. With nothing to work
upon the physicians only labored In vain
to offset the debilitating effect3 of the
operation. The change for the wcrse was
marked . during the day and, as the
hours passed there were no hopeful symp
toms of reviving strength. Because of
the failure of favorable reaction to man
ifest itself the physicians feel that there
was little if any recovery from the oper
ation's shock. Mr. English has , failed
during the last forty-eight hours. There
appears to be no chance for a rally that
would give the attendants a ground for
belief at this crisis that the patient might
improve.

lish had undergone within a few months/
The first, for appendicitis, seemed to have

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
SALT LAKE. Utah, Aug. 13.â The Su
preme Court to-day aSrmed the verdict
of pullty of murder In the first degree
against Peter Mortensen and refused to
grant him a new trial. Mortensen was
found guilty of the murder of James R.
Hay. secretary of the Pacific Lumber
Company, whose body he burled In an
open field. The case attracted wide
spread attention on account the prom
inence of the Mormon belief in revela
tions took in the evidence presented, and
evidence of this character formed one of
the principal reasons advanced by Mor
tensen's attorneys in their petition to
the Supreme Court for a new trial.
James Sharp, father-in-law of the
murdered man. while being cross-Ques
tioned by counsel for the defense as to
his having charged Mortensen with the
crime made the following statement:
I charged Peter Mortensen Â¦with the murder
of ir.y ton-!n-!aw because I knew that he vu
puilty. God appeared to me by the Holy
Ghost and put the words of his spirit Into my
mouth. I had to utter them, for I knew they
â¢were true. I cannot and will not deny it here,
neither will I deny It when I meet my God
In the "..-.Â«Â¦; day.
This was not the only manifestation I re
ceived. On Tuesday noon I caw the trail of
blood leading from the railroad tracks to
where my scn-ln-law was buried. I saw it In
b. vision JuFt as plainly as when 1 afterward
v'slted the toot.
The refusal of the trial Judg% to
strike, out . this statement, which was
calculated. Mortensen's attorneys claim
ed, to prejudice the defendant's case in
the minds of the Mormon members of
the Jury, was made one of the principal
grounds for an appeal.
In ruling on this, the Supreme Court
held that, as every Mormon member of
the jury had stated that he did not be
lieve that Sharp had such a revelation,
and would not be influenced by it to re
turn a verdict against the defendant, j
and because of the further fact that the j
alleged revelation did not refer to any I
contested or disputed question In the !
case, as It was conceded that the body
of Hay was in fact found and dug up in
the vicinity, the court failed to see how !
the defendant's case was prejudiced by !
the testimony referred to. The fact that ;
the defense knew w*.at Sharp's testimony 'â¢
was to be ar.d that no motion was made
to exclude the testimony !s commented
upon.

that no one had been authorized to make
any collections In the name of any post
in Oakland, and they branded all such
solicitors as rank impostors.

to the * propositions laid down by
the Musicians' Mutual Protective Union.
At a meeting held yesterday afternoon
the organization took a firm, stand
against th*Â» action of the Grand Army
officials hiring army bands 1 to play In the
parade. The Musicians' Union has de
clared the coming encampment "unfair."
and a committee composed of three mem
bers has been directed to visit other un
ions and secure their co-operation. ( Their
plan ia to have the carpenters ; at/work
on thp arch called off and to have the
linemen withdrawn who are putting up
the electric lights to illumine the streets.
A further attempt will be made to have
the Hacktaen's Union indorse their strili*?*
and refuse to permit their members from.
hauling veterans fn the parade.
The meeting yesterday was a stormy
one. ThÂ«re were members present who
did not desire a general strike declared,
as they had already secured contracts
to plav at various entertainments dur
ing the week. There was a loud cry
against the contract holders. The ma
jority wanted the Grand Army people
brought up with a round turn and they
did not care whether outside organiza
tions suffered cr not. The grand concert
which Is scheduled to be held In Me
chanics' Pavilion on Wednesday evening
will not take place unless a compromise
is reached. Professor Steindorff was en
gaged to lead seventy-flve tinlon musi
cians, but under the ruling of the union
they cannot take part.
Secretary J. H. Keosri of the Musi
cians' Mutual Protective Union delivered
a lengthy addres3. in which he explained
what he had done to bring about a set
tlement of the present trouble. He Â«.Â»: !
he warned the committee of the Grartrl
Army Encampment that the union, migh.:
take radical measures. He said he wa3
asked what the uhion might do. and fee
told the committee that It might make
an attempt to spoil the encampment so
far as it lay In their power. He told
them that Professor Steindorff would net
be permitted to lead the concert, nor
would the musicians be permitted to play.
"I told the committee." said Keogr:.
"that they might get the army bands
tc play out thera at a less rate, and or*
of the committee replied that they could
not secure the right kind of musicians.
I told them we would call out the elec
tric linemen. I told the committee that
sinc^ thÂ« Stats Legislature had voted
C5.0CO for the encampment Â»sd another
120.000 had been donated by the citizens
of this city the musicians had a pe^tscz
right to receive some consideration a:
the hands of the committee."
At the conclusion of the secretary** ex
planation one cf the members m iÂ» a
motion to declare the Grand Army En
campment unfair, ia order to sto;> ail
army bands playing during the â¢nesmr
ment; and further, that tne entire mat
ter be brought up bÂ«fcre the Labor Coun
cil for further action. This 'motion wÂ»
debated at great length. Sora* of tnÂ»
members objected to the La>3r Council
taking a hand, as it would not take *c
tlcn until lortir after thÂ« encscn?n3Â«Tit was
over. They desired that trie union make
Its own ftsat.

and will be decorated with banners,
streamers and bunches of flags. Lines of
electric globes have been strung across
the street between the poles with hanging
etrings of lamps at each end.
The executive committee of the en
campment Intended to have the poles
placed along Market street from the fer

progressing rapidly and it is expected
that the arches at Third and Market
streets will be complete by Sunday night.

DECORATING PROGRESSING.
Stephen M. Long, adjutant general 'ot
the national organization and department
commander of the Grand Army of New
Jersey, is due to arrive In this city Mon
day morning.
Colonel Walker was a member of the
Twentieth Army Corps, a part of Sher
man's forces, when he was taken pris
oner while the famous march "from At
lanta to the sea" was drawing to a close.
He was confined In LJbby and Danville
prisons. He has served two terms as
commander of the national organization
of Union ex -Prisoners of War. -
We have a membership of about 8000. which
Is ret resented In every State and Territory la
the Union and in Canada. In California tber*
Is an organization, but seemingly It his not
thrived very well â a fact that wÂ» will look
Into during the encampment week.
Colonel Walker stated that the pro
gramme for the campflre has not yet
been completed, but he gave assurance
that It will be an interesting event, and
will include speeches by the more notable
members of the G. A. R. delegates, among
them being General Black. Governor Xash
of Ohio. Harry Palmer, General Chipman
and others. As to the number of ex-pris
oners who will attend the encampment the
commander was unable* to suggest, but
he expressed the opinion that the repre
sentation will be very large, adding:
In refpmni to the horror* of Andersonville
I would like to add that I do so only la refer
ence to what we are doing to perpetuate the
grounds as a historical ssot and not as a re
minder of the hardships that we experienced
there. The soldiers of the North and South
are no longer arrayed against each other. We
are brothers Interested In a common cause, and
recall* the war with no feeltnsrs of harshness.
Its Incidents are cloeeU. and U Is in recogni
tion of this fact that the Union srtsoners. at
their annual campflres. deal In no discussions
of the oast that would tend to offend thc*a
gallant soldiers, who considered that their In
terests lie within the cause of the Confederate
array. Our carjyflre at this encampment will
be held in Lyric Hall on Tuesday evening, and
we hope that all prisoners of war, whether or
not they belong to the national association,
will attend the affair.
GOOD WEL PREVAILS.
ERECT MONUMENTS.
Two other States, Rhode Island and Michigan,
have lately, in their Legislatures, voted appro
priations tor similar testimonials of recogni
tion of the men who died within the prison
f.-alls. Their motiume:.H.Â«. I believe, will be
erected in the National Cemetery. It Is hoped
to encourage ether Slates to follow In this
commendable move which cur organization
is endeavoring to encourage.
Another matter that will be discussed by us
will be plans for the improvement and preser
vation of Provident Spring, the history of
which Is one of the most marvelous Incidents
of the late war. In the midst of the suffer
ings of the Cnlon soldiers who were huddle-J
together In the Andersonville pen. where wa
ter was the crying need of the sick and craved
for by the stronger prisoners, there suddenly
came through the ground a clear spring of
water, which eliayed much suffering. It haa
flowed ever since, and has been regarded by
many an old soldier as living evidence of a
wartime miracle. The Woman's Relief CorpÂ»
has already surroundtd the mouth of thÂ«
sprinK with a stone wall and covered this with
a canopy, under which there has been erected
by our national association a $S00O fountain
and a stone receptacle for the clear water. WÂ«
hope to maintain this Interesting spot in re
membrance of the succor given, to the pris
oners In those awful days of hunger, thirst and
unrest. The ; prisoners of war peaaloa bill,
which has been submitted to Congress several
times, but unfortunately withheld by the com
mittees, will also receive some attention at
the comlnx session.
During the encampment week the Union
ex-Prisoners of War will have their head
quarters at Lyric Hall, where, on Monday
morning, they will assemble for the first
time. On Tuesday the organization will
take part in the Grand Army parade and
in the afternoon the members will be
called Into annual conclave for the elec
tion of new officers and the transaction
of general business. In discussing the
proceedings. last evening. Colonel Walker
said:
One of the principal subjects that will come
up for consideration by the organization will
be plans for encouraging the various States
to erect monuments or memorials on the site
of the old Andersonville Prison. New Jersey
has erected a monument In the National Cem
etery there; Pennsylvania has also contributed
a memorial, and on the ground where the old
prJion /("en stood, now designated as Prison
Park. Ohio and Massachusetts have paid a
tribute to the patience and endurance of the
thousands of Union soldiers during the trying
days of their incarceration. 1:1 the shape ot
magnificent monuments.
organization composed mainly of
men who endured the hardships of Ander
sonville, LJbby and Danville prisons dur
ing the fearful struggle between the North
and South, arrived from the East yester-,
day with his wife and Is registered at the
Grand Hotel. Although the organization
which Colonel Walker represents is neces
sarily smaller than the Grand Army body,
it had always been an Important factor in
the annual encampments of the latter, and
it is expected that it will be largely repre
sented here next week.

TOPEKA, Kans., Aug. 13.â The engine,
mail car and baggage car of the Texas
express on the Rock Island, which leaves
Topeka at midnight, went through a
bridge across Hcndricks Creek near
Alma at 1:30 o'clock this morning, kill
ing John L. Eggett, fireman, of McFar
land, Kans., and seriously injuring Engi
neer John McStean of Kansas City. The
baggagemen and express messengers
jumped when the shock came and were
swept' bv the waters Jnto the treetops,
whence they were rescued at day
light by William Graves, a fisherman.
Graves also found the engineer uncon
scious and entancled in the limbs of a
tree. dil^? ' â¢ '
The engine is in the bottom of the
creek, out of sight. One car is dangling
from the end of the bridge and another
is lodged on the bank of the stream par
tially under water. That loss of life did
not follow is due to the narrowness of
tho stream where the disaster occurred.
A cloudburst had filled the .Â« creek and
weakened the bridge.
None of the passengers were hurt, as
the coach remained on the rails.
Passenger train No. 13, which the wreck
ed train had passed at McFarland, was
following close and only the prompt ac
tion of Conductor Cane and flagman Me-
Gruder prevented a collision from- the
rear.
The night was a wild one and the force
of the current, the darkness and the driv
ing rain, together with the- cries for help
of those in the water, combined to make
a dismal scene. The rescuing party built
fires along the bank, and did everything
in its power to locate the men in the
water. Some attempted to swim to the
unfortunates, but soon landed in trees and
were compelled to give up. Farmers final
ly came to the rescue at daylight with
.boats secured, two miles up the* stream
and hauled to^ the wreck in wagons.

The province of Ontario produced $547,

Estimates for Oregon are 75,000 against
80.000 bales last year. The crop of the
.Pacific Coast is estimated at 155,000 bales,
against 170,000 last year.
TACOMA, Aug. 13.â Conditions in the
hop fields are far enoush advanced to
enable growers and dealers to make close
estimates on the crop. Old hops now
bring 20 cents, and contracts for new
hops are being made at 20 cents and up
ward. Good judges say if statistics count
for anything prices are bound to be high
er than at any time since 1S82. It is esti
mated that the crop of Western Wash
ington will be 22.500 bales, that of the
Yakima country 12,500 bales; total for the
State, 35,000 bales, as against 30,000 last
year.

Social Dispatch to The Call
Great care has been taken in the selec
tion of. the toÂ«vn site and in the platting
of the town, the company wishing to
make it not only a center of Industry, but
also an ideal summer resort. One of the
first steps taken by the company after
the laying out of streets and avenues was
completed was the erection of a number
of dwellings. They are built according to
the latest styles of architecture and are
beautiful and comfortable. A complete
water system is now being put in, and
the town wiil be lighted by electricity. A
banking institution is on the programme
and will be managed by the company. Ar
ticles of incorporation for its establish
ment have been taken out, the capital
stock beins $50,000.
Two mills are now at work near tho
town cutting lumber for the company's
immediate use, and an immense mill
which when completed will have the
largest capacity of any mill in^ Northern
California has been commenced. A brick*,
yard has been established" not far ; from
the town, and before long Sterling City
will be worth while putting on the map.
The Diamond Match Company does not,
aa may bo inferred from its name, manu
facture matches alone. All kinds of fin
ishing material, such as sashes, doors,
etc., are placed upon the market by it.
The directors have selected Chico, the
largest city in Butte County, as the place
where the factories will be located, and
there they will employ about 2000 persons.
A railroad will be run from the factories
into the timber region. The road is in
course of construction, the E. B. & A. L>.
Stone Company of Oakland having the
contract. The distance by rail from Chico
to Sterling City will be thirty-two miles,
and the new town will be about the same
distance from Oroville, the county seat.
The Diamond Match Company has a
number of plants in Eastern States, but
its business is not confined to the United
States alone. It has factories in England,
Germany, Sweden, South Africa, Chile
and elsewhere on the globe. When look
ing out toward the Pacific for timber land
the company managers discovered in Butte
County an immense tract of sugar and
yellow pine which suited them, and they
soon had it in their possession. The land
spreads out over the extremely northern
part- of Butte County and runs into Te
hama and Plumas counties. They decided
to build factories in the valley, but must
have a mountain town for a center of
operations, where sawmills could be es
tablished and business pertaining to the
mountain region would be carried on.
They now have selected a most beautiful
spot on a plateau directly over the West
Branch of the Feather. River, 3500 feet
above sea level, for the site of the new
town.
, OROVILLE, Aug. 13.â put of a forest in
northern Butto County Is springing up a
new town. It is small as yet, but destined
to become a place of considerable size and
importance in the very near future.
Sterling City is the name of the. new.
town, and it owes its inception to the in
auguration of a gigantic lumber enter
prise in Butte County by the Diamond
Match Company. , .

Night Captain Monahan was the only

rived with his prisoner. After Instructing
Black to search the man, Monahan turned
to answer the telephone. Schuek then be
gan backing away from Black, and whip
ping out a big revolver, commanded the
officer to stand back under penalty of
death. The officer was bundled up in his
heavy, overcoat and had no chance of
drawing his revolver. When the suspect
got to the door he started out and ran off.
As soon as Black recovered himself he
drew his revolver and started after the
escape.' By that time the man was hoof
ing it down the street. Black fired a shot
at the fugitive, but it only caused him to
increase his speed.
The police are satisfied that the man
was Schuek. He had told Black he was
a railroad man and had offered to show
the officer his union card to prove that
he was all right.
The suspect was eating at the railway
lunch counter when pointed out to Black
and Black took him into custody. He ac
companied the officer peacefully enough to
the station in the patrol wagon.
Shortly after 3 o'clock this morning the
man was pointed out as Schuek to Officer
Black by railway men at the broad-gauge
depot. They stated that he was wanted
for robbing a caboose. Schuek had been
employed by the Southern Pacific Com

.-> WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â The Interna
tional Typographical Union began Its ses
sions to-day with a sharp controversy
over a motion to distribute a pamphlet
.prepared by the Newspaper Publishers'
Association in criticism of the union's
conduct* of the printers' strike at Seattle
and Spokane, Wash. Objection was made
to the circulation of the pamphlet on
the ground that it did not bear the union
label, but President Lynch made an earn
est appeal for Its acceptance, and his re
quest was granted by a decided vote.
The convention then, in accordance with
a resolution adopted yesterday, listened
to an address by Frederick Drlscoll, com
missioner of the Publishers' Association,
relative to tha strikes In the State of
Washington. He disclaimed responsibil
ity for the { printing of the publishers'
circular without a label, and then pro
ceeded to read a formal statement, which
was a sharp criticism of the union and
of President Lynch.
Uriscoll said that continuous 'industrial
peace had been enjoyed for more than
two years under the plan of arbitration
adopted by the association and the un
ion, and until the occurrence of the two
strikes at Spokane and Seattle, which
he characterized as "inexcusable," con
tending that the reasons put forth justi
fying those strikes are untenable. He
said that "if arbitration had been ad
hered, to, according to the obligations of
our- agreement there would have been no
strike or disturbance of our friendly re
lations."
Referring to the two cases at issue and
stating his contentions representing them,
Driscoll said the existing agreement
should be respected and the publishers
at Spokane and Seattle restored to the
status quo existing before the strike, and
that they, should proceed under the terms
of the, existing contract to arbitrate and,
finally settle the differences. He closed
with an appeal to the union to do what
he regarded as Its duty. %
Driscoll's speech was received with ap
plause, and the chair announced that it
would be referred to the committee i on
arbitration. He added that when the
committee reported he would make a
statement In which he hoped., to be, able
to show that the merits of â¢ the Wash
ington controversy are not all on one
side.r ;Â¦'. â¢ .:/; ,. .'Â¦:Â¦:- '-Â¦.. .'Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦Â¦

PROVE JOVIAL HOSTS
WHILE no announcement has been made by
Mr. Chamberlain himself of the plan of tax
ation by which he would establish a system
of protection for British and colonial industries, the
discussion of the subject in the press has reached a
point where a wel} defined budget begins to emerge
from the mass of glittering generalities. It is now
seemingly accepted by the public that when the
scheme is formulated it will consist of a shifting of
taxation from one set of imports to another. Goods
now admitted free will be compelled to pay duties,
while other goods now taxed will be made free, so
that in the end the cost of the food of the people
will not be increased.
The Birmingham Post has presented a detailed
statement showing how the plan can be worked out.
It proposes that ''free trade food taxes," which now
j-icld a revenue of Â£13,000,000, be repealed, and also
that the tobacco duty be reduced to the extent of
Â£2,000,000, making an annual reduction of customs
revenue of Â£15,000,000. To compensate the treasury
for that reduction it suggests that protective or
"preferential" duties be levied according to the fol
lowing table:
Tariff on foreign manufactures (10 per cent on
Â£73,000,000 paid by foreign competitors). Â£7,600,000
Ss per quarter, or M a cwt, on foreign wheat
(last year SO.000,000 cwt., reckoning flour* In
equivalent weight of grain) 3,000,009
Lower rates upon other foreign grains and
farming produce *. 2,000,000
4s per cwt.. or fid a stone, on foreign meats
(last year's Imports 13,500,000 cwt.) 2.700,000
Total .Â£15,200,000
It will be seen that the statement figures out a
revenue from* the proposed duties which will exceed
the reductions by Â£200,000 a year. It is expected that
the reduction of the tax on tea, coffee and other so
called "free trade food taxes" will balance in. the
average family the increase in the cost of bread and
CHAMBERLAIN'S PROGRAMME.
The couple desired to get married in Sa
linas, but as Lambert's daughter is only
15 and Burden is 38 parental consent could
not be obtained. They therefore conclud
ed to elope with the intention of wedding
somewhere else. Lambert asks Danforth
in his telegram not to issue a marriage
license to the couple should they ask for
one. Up to 5 o'clock last evening no such
request had- been made.
Marriage Clerk Danforth received a
telephone message yesterday from Depu
ty Sheriff Lambert of Salinas that the
latter's daughter, Annie Lambert, had
eloped with a man named Oeorge Burden.
The runaways left Salinas on last
Wednesday evening's train and are be
lieved to have come to San Francisco.

In a divorce proceeding in London recently the
learned English jurist gave the sought-for decree to
the husband on the ground that the latter's miscon
duct had been provoked by the actions of the wife.
This increased heavy burden to the already grave
responsibilities of English wives suggests that the
emancipation of the unfortunate creatures might be
legitimately a subject of concern to a charitably in
clined world.
SAYS HIS DAUGHTER HAS
ELOPED WITH CfcDEB. MAN
THE English Judge who has criticized and an
nulled an American divorce is breeding trouble
for somebody. An English lady, attracted to
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, by the blandishments of
the climate and the social advantages of that water
power, took up her residence there and in due time
became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
She carried her expatriation so far as to desire a
legal separation from her lord and master, as well as
a political separation from her sovereign and king.
Therefore she looked over the stock of divorces kept
on tap in Sidux Falls and purchased one. Thereafter
she married again. Her first husband brought suit
against her second for $125,000 damages, and has just
got judgment for that amount.
We make no criticism of that judgment. It must
be gratifying to the new husband that he had secured
a wife who, although second-hand goods, is 1 judicially
appraised at such a high figure. But we do object to
the remarks with which the English Judge, Sir Fran
cis Jeune, and the first husband's counsel garnished
the proceedings. The first husband, who besides
other disabilities is ngmed Constandinidi, a
judicial separation from his wife in England in 1899,
which the lady finished by her Dakota divorce. The
court and counsel concurred in this offensive expres
sion: "This, delicately nurtured lady of Belgravia
went to a wild district of the earth, emigrated to the
half-settled State of Dakota, became an American
citizen, fraudulently obtained a so-called divorce and
married the co-respondent. This was a fraud on civ
ilized jurisprudence."
That Judge would better tread softly. The civiliza
tion of South Dakota is superior to that of Belgravia,
and many of the best divorces now in use in this
country and Europe have been furnished there. Judge
Jeune is president of the English divorce court, and
r.o divorce ever manufactured by him has worn bet
ter than the Sioux Falls product. "Civilized juris
prudence," indeed! Just let an American court, and
especially a South Dakota court, catch one of Sir
Francis Jeune's divorces running around in this coun
try and it will be shown up as a fake, a counterfeit
and a fraud.

TATTOO MARKSâ T. C. H.. Llvermore.
Cal There are many so-called methods
for the removal of tattoo marks. The
latest is that given In the Pharmaceutical
Era. It is called the digestion of the
subcutaneous pigment by papold and Is
described as follows: "The tattooed part
is well washed with soap and water, a
bunch of six or eight cambric needles
bound together with silk thread 13 dipped
in glycerole of papoid and driven with a
sharp blow Into the tattooed part. Thla
is repeated over the entire stain and must
be thorough to be effective. A peculiar
ity of the method is said to be that it
causes no inflammatory reaction. The
digestive principles of the papoid ia dis
seminated about the deposit of pigment,
thus liberating it. a portion is absorbed
In a finely divided state by the lymphat
ics, anotheT part probably finds Its way
into the upper layers of the epidermis
and close to the surface, and In this man
ner the pigment disappears.
The trial of the suit in ejectment
brought by John D. Doherty against Ha
nora Courtney came to an abrupt ending
in Judge Kerrigan's court yesterday. The
jury was discharged because four of its
members, despite the fact that they were
instructed to do so, refused to return a
verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The
jurymen who refused to obey the in
structions of the court were James Wll
kins of the Cliff House, Adolph Green
berg. Rollin C. Ames and W. R. Wrights.
Their refusal was undoubtedly due to
the influence of sentiment, as the law
was plainly for the plaintiff. Doherty re
cently purchased from Rev. John Pious
Murphy, O. P., a house on McAllister
street, near Fillmore. The priest ac
quired it from Mrs. Catherine Black, she
having deeded it to him in trust for the
Dominican Order a few days before her
death. Mrs. Courtney is a sister of Mrs.
Black, and she has occupied the house
since the date of her sister's death, re
fusing to move therefrom at the request
of the new owner. He brought suit to
eject her and considerable evidence, prin
cipally for the plaintiff, was heard. It
was therefore a great surprise when the
four Jurors refused to accept the Instruc
tions of the court and oust Mrs. Court
ney.

We have no lack of wealth, nor any lack of real
capital. The one lack is a currency that automati
cally responds to the needs of business. Of our pros
p.rity Secretary Wilson recently said: "Industries
are all prospering. Hardly are our manufacturers
able to supply the demands made on them. The
farmers are busy everywhere, getting fair prices for
their products. Laborers arc all employed every
where; no one is idle who wants work. Money is
plentiful. Speaking for the Northwest, in which my
home is situated, I can say that the people do not
know what to do with their money. In agricultural
districts of the Northwest to find investments they
have gone into British Columbia and Western Can
r.da and bought up the rich and cheap farming lands
there. Taking things all in all. one finds a great pe
riod of prosperity for both capital and labor. They
are certainly hundreds of millions of dollars richer
than before the rresent period of prosperity began."
Yet with ell that showing of industry' and prosperity
we have bankers in all parts of the country talking
over the dangers of the situation and pointing out
the need of caution until the harvests have been mar
keted and business returns to its normal level.
There is nothing surprising in the fact that some
of the opponents of the proposed reform who were
outspoken in their opposition a short time ago have
now come over to the majority. The events of the
past two or three weeks have been sufficient to con
vince almost any intelligent student of the situation
that there is a radical defect in our currency system;
that it is no longer adequate to the needs of a coun
try whose commerce and industry are expanding so
enormously. It is true we have not had this year
a stringency in the money market like that which
occurred last year and forced, the Secretary of the
Treasury to go to the assistance of the banks, but
nevertheless there has been enough to show that we
are running big risks in trying to conduct our busi
ness on the present currency basis.
The contrast between the abounding prosperity of
the country and the uncertain state of affairs in the
great stock markets is sufficient to prove the need 'of
providing for elasticity in the currency, so that there
may be no stringency in the financial centers at the
season when money is 4 withdrawn for use in harvest
ing and marketing the crops of the great agricultural
States. Of course much of the trouble in Wall street
was caused by excessive speculation due to an over
confidence in the ability of the big trusts and mergers
to hold their stocks and securities up to the high
ievels they reached during the boom time.; but even
when ample allowance is made for the effects of
speculation there remains enough of disturbance to
show that overspeculation has not been the cause of
all the trouble, or perhaps even the sole cause of any
of it.
The reports add that the opposition of some of the
leaders of the House of which so much was heard
early in the summer has been virtually abandoned,
and that the Republicans of the House will in the
main cordially co-operate with those of the Senate
in promoting the passage of the desired act. Thus
the situation is decidedly more promising than it was
even a few weeks ago, and there is now ample rea
son for holding sanguine expectations of the out
come of the prolonged discussion.
REPORTS concerning the conference of the
Republican members of the Senate Finance
Committee with President Roosevelt at Saga
more Hill arc encouraging to the hopes of those who
realize how important it is to have an efficient meas
ure of currency legislation enacted at the coming
extra session of Congress. It appears that as yet the
Republicans of the committee have not formulated a
measure to be reported when Congress meets, /but
they have agreed that a bill shall be reported
promptly and that it shall contain ample provisions
ior giving elasticity to our currency while carefully
guarding against ihe'dangers of an excessive issue of
bank notes.

NATIONAL HOLIDAY - ThWy-year
Subscriber. There Is no national holiday
in the United States, not even the Fourth
of July. Congress has at various times
appointed special holidays. In the second
session of the Fifty-third Congress an act
was passed making Labor day a public
holiday in the District of Columbia, ami
It has recognized the existence of certain
days as holidays for commercial purposes,
but with the exception named there ia no
general statute on the subject. The proc
lamation of the President designating a
day of thanksgiving only makes It a legal
holiday in the District of Columbia and In
those States which provide by law for It.

AUSTRALIA has selected the site for her fed
eral capital and has thus taken another step
in that process of unification which will even
tually make her a nation instead of a federation.
Furthermore, she has at last seen a break in that
prolonged period of drought or scant rains that has
so materially injured her people and blighted her
high hopes. Late reports tell of a rainfall which ex
tended over well nigh the whole continent, and
which in most places was sufficiently abundant to as
sure good pasturage for sheep and cattle and rich
harvests of grain for the farmers.
With the coming of the rains the long depression
in industry will cease, and asa consequence her peo
ple will have less of social and political pessimism.
It is a familiar fact that in free countries where some
thing like universal suffrage prevails ..the popular
vote is largely affected by the condition of crops and
the markets for produce. When prosperity prevails
the people vote with the Government, but when hard
times come the tendency is to vote for the opposi
tion. Furthermore, in times of adversity a people
are inclined to listen credulously to the appeals of
calamity howlers and to follow the leadership â¢ of
demagogues, so that the natural evil of the situation
is often made worse by imposing political evils upon
it. We have had experiences of that kind ourselves,
but of late the Australians have had a far worse ex
perience than any recorded in our annals.
So serious were the labor, industrial and political
complexities arising out of the drought in the Aus
tralian provinces that for a time it looked as if the
federation would go to pieces. Report after report
came of popular discontents against the new govern :
ment and its new taxes. Cattle and sheep were per
ishing by thousands, farmers were being ruined, mer
chants were failing, factories shutting down, and the
cities swarmed with unemployed men demanding
work and wages. The new federation found itself
launched on a stormy sea. *It was difficult to get clear
way for any kind of progress, and it is highly credit
able, to ,the Australian people arid Australian states
men that the difficulties were overcome and dangers
evaded and the ship of state guided safely through
the storm. Now everything appears promising. The
controversy over the location of the capital is ended.
The drought is broken. Good times are coming. The
Australian federation is permanently established be
yond all doubting, and we shall hear no more inti
mations of the probability of its breaking up.

The question of the overflow at the Chi
nese public school on Clay street was also
discussed. Some time ago the schqol was
moved from the old building to the one
next door. As the old building Is larger
than the other the board concluded that
it would be advisable to move back again
instead of renting another outside room
and this will probably be done.
Superintendent Langdon Issued a circu
lar yesterday showing that he had dis
tricted the schools for convenience of su
pervision. The schools north of Market
are In District 1 under Deputy Superin
tendent Heaton and those south of Mar
ket are under Deputy Suzzalo.
The Sunnyside School will In all proba
bility have a portable schoolhouse to take
care of the overflow. Director Mark ex
pressed himself in favor of sending to
that school the portable schoolhouse now
serving as an addition to the Jackson or
Park School. THe owner of the lot on
which the school stands has notified the
board that he will raise the rent of the
lot from $10 to $35, but the board will de
cline to pay the Increase. It will pref
erably remove the portable schoolhouse
to the Sunnyside School. No definite con
clusion was arrived at in regard to the
other two classes proposed to be estab
lished.
One of the schools at which It has been
decided to establish a new class is the
Gartield on Telegraph Hill, where the
number of pupils is largely on the In
crease. An outside room has * been rent
ed for the purpose and the assignment
thereto will be made at next Wednesday'*
meeting of the board. Another school
where the need of a new class is impera
tive is the Monroe. A portable school
will be utilized for this class and an ex
periment will be made with a portable
schoolhouse now In use in the Oakland
school department.
The Board of Education held an execu
tive session yesterday for the purpose of
deciding on the establishment of several
new classes in schools where the attend
ance has become greatly congested. The
question of assignments was also discussed
and it was practically decided to elect at
least five teachers for the present day
eligible list as substitutes In the school
department. Superintendent of Schools
Langdon was present at the conference
and his observations of existing condi
tions in the schools largely governed the
board in arriving at its decision.
The eligibles who will be elected Into
the department are in all likelihood C. J.
Telfer, Mabel O. Benjamin, Josephine M.
Hopkins, Marie d'Erlach and Joan Mul
lin, it being the policy of the board to
select those standing the next highest on
the eligible list.
The committee approved the designation
by the Board of Works of a bituminous
pavement on New Montgomery street
from Market to Mission, already recom
mended for full acceptance.
The petition of the American District
Telegraph Company to establish a night
watch for flre alarm system was with
drawn.
M. J. Dunn asked that action be taken
to construct a sewer in Liberty street, be
tween Church and Sanchez. Dunn said
that one Bell refused to sign a private
contract for the work and Assistant Sec
retary Keogh of the Board of Works said
that contractors refuse to bid under pro
ceedings for public contract, owing to a
question of grades. Mr. Bell was cited
to appear before the committee next
Thursday.
The committee reported In favor of
grading Lake street between Twenty
fourth and Twenty-sixth avenues to offi
cial line and the full acceptance of Hyde
street, between Greenwich and Lombard.
George H. Roundey appeared before the
Supervisors' Street Committee yesterday
and reauested that obstructions be or
dered removed from Wayland and Felton
streets between La ' Grande and San
Bruno avenues, r.oundey stated that the
fences prevent voters from reaching their
polling places, except by following a cir
cuitous route alonv Sliver avenue. The
committee decided to investigate the com
plaint.
HANDSHAKING-Etiquette.City. When
a lady la introduced to a gentleman, it is
for the lady to decide whether she will
offer her hand.
So the Macedonians of Sofia are not aroused by
the terrible stories of slaughter and massacre told so
luridly by the patriots of the committee, and their
apathy is deemed something astonishing. Perhaps,
however, they do not believe the stories. They are
near to the scene of the disturbance and have doubt
less many means of learning what is going on. It
may be they regard the whole agitation as a spectacu
lar performance. In that case it would be astonish
ing if they were anything other than indifferent.
One of the significant features of the situation is
the appearance of Boris Saraftof as chief of the
patriot Christians. The said Boris is the man who
is popularly supposed to have been the instigator of
the abduction of our American missionary, Miss
Stone, who was held for a high ransom, which we
had to pay. The followers of Boris assert that when
he carried off Miss Stone he had no other object
than that of raising a fund for the maintenance of the
cause of liberty and Christianity. The defense will
be accepted for what it is worth, but so long as the
Macedonian cause has a leader who practices such
tactics it will not be surprising if the Macedonians
of Sofia continue to be indifferent to the war and
remain at home, where they are not liable to be ab
ducted and held for ransom. Moreover, if the
patriotic Boris wishes sympathy among the Ameri
can people who paid the ransom for Miss Stone he
must publish a signed statement with vouchers show
ing that he spent the money for liberty and Chris
tianity and not for some kind of a Bulgarian blow
out. In the meantime dispatches from Sofia, Bel
grade and Constantinople will be accepted among
reports Classified as "interesting if true."
The whole situation is involved in confusion, and
the dispatches are a string of inconsistencies. For
example, those of yesterday from Sofia stated, among
other things, that the Mohammedans are slaughtering
the Christians of Macedonia, that young men of
Bulgaria are hastening to the mountains to join the
Macedonian bands, that the Bashi Bazouks are com
mitting terrible outrages, and then go on to add:
"The most astonishing feature of the situation here is
the remarkable quietude with which the people have
received the news of the fresh rioting in Macedonia.
The whole outbreak came as a great surprise, even
to the local revolutionary committees, which were not
prepared for so early a rising. In spite of the stir
ring appeals of the committee, little or no popular
enthusiasm is apparent, not even among the 20,000
Macedonian residents of Sofia."
EARLY in the year, while the blasts of winter
were blowing round the Balkan mountains, the
spokesmen of the Macedonian Committee in
formed the world that. with the coming of spring
there would be war. The words were bold and the
menace seemed imminent/ so that a good many folks
watched the months pass in high expectations that
when gentle spring with her ethereal mildness came
the Macedonians would rise with the blossoming of
the roses and make the land blood red.
The date of the rising was fixed for April i, but it
was not an All Fools' day in that country, so the peo
ple stayed at home to eat their rye bread and garlic
in peace instead of rising up to fight for annexation
to Bulgaria. The European 'concert looked over the
situation and, seeing no war in sight, promptly
claimed credit for maintaining peace and set all its
diplomatists to work assuring mankind that it would
continue to maintain it. Now the spring has gone
and summer is ncaring its end, and lol the promise
of the concert of powers is seen to have been about as
futile as the menace of the revolutionists. The up
rising which did not take place on April I is, fixed
for August 31, and the "peace" maintained in the
spring has been nothing more than a prolonged pe-,
riod of disturbance.
Between the manifestos of the committee and the
whispered assurances of the diplomatists of' the con
cert there are such wide divergences that the most
careful student of the progress of events in the Bal
kans finds it impossible to form a fixed opinion on a
single phase of the situation. There is an old Span
ish legend that the water* of the Hassayampa, a
stream in Arizona, has such a magic quality that
those who drink of it never tell the truth again.
Evidently the leaders of the committee and the diplo
matists of the concert are Hassayampers, and we
shall never know the truth about the Balkans until
we search it out for ourselves.

out to workingmen a promise of steadier work and

issue will be when officially made up for submission

To an American the most interesting feature of
the proposal is that the .tax is much higher on im
ports of manufactures than on imports of foodstuffs.
It looks more like a measure for the protection of
the British manufacturer than for that of the colonial
and the home farmer?" This goes far to confirm the
statement made quite frequently of late that the new
policy of protection is to be supported by a large
campaign fund subscribed by- manufacturers of Bir
mingham and elsewhere, and that the fight against
free trade is going to be led and waged by the very
class of men who some fifty years ago overthrew the
old system of protection.

IF the complete story could be told of the devotion and suffering, of
the privations and heroic sacrifices of all the brave women who nursed
the wounded and the dying on both sides in the bloody conflict be-
tween the North and South it would be one of the grandest, most
sublime narratives ever penned. Even when recorded in brief their ca-
reers speak volumes for the dangers they braved to minister with gentle
hands and lc-inz care.
"Oh, what breaking hearts many mothers are still carrying for their
boys buried in graves marked "Unknown," " says Mrs. Mary J. Bos-
ton, one of these fifty-eight fair veterans of that bloody conflict who have
written two full pages of personal anecdotes of their service in the hos-
pital, the bivouac and the battlefield. She not only consecrated her
life to nursing the wounded throughout the entire war, but cave two
brothers to the cause at Fredcricksburg and a brother-in-law at Gettys-
burg, and the anecdote of which those few lines are the prelude is one
jf the most dramatically thrilling ever penned These fifty-eight women
saw the awful struggle with their own c~cs â and it is war actual war
that each and even- one of them has written of from her own peculiar
point of view. Those two paces alone will enthrall you.
To the veterans whose names make up the roll of honor of the
Grand Army of the Republic that stupendous struggle must ever be a
vivid reality, but to those of the younger generation the hope and de-
spair of that fierce conflict must be seen through the eyes of the artist
the writer and the painter alone. It is a remarkable fact that some of
the best battle scenes ever painted are those depicting our great Civil
War from beginning to end.
,. A^ Â« this fact that has enabled The Sunday Call in its special
G. A R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest battles of the war that can be offered b T a
modern newspaper. Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its spec-
tacular dose with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. when

Eocorro Island is about 230 miles off the
Mexican roast. There are several thou
sand sheep on the island, but no water.
The scientists were left on the island for
a month while the Mary Sachs, sailed to
Point Pinos for a fresh supply of water.
At the island of Clarion, which was also
visited, the expedition found a volcano In
eruption. The members of the party had
several narrow escapes from drowning in
the surf at some of the places they land
ed in search of specimens.
The birds were secured by shooting and
trapping, and in several cases a capture
was effected by the skillful use of a light
lariat. As they were caught the birds
were cured and stuffed, and the large col
lection is now all ready for mounting In
the Academy natural history department.
The Mary Sachs is a little bit of a ves
sel of only thirty-one tons burden, but
she made a comfortable home, and apart
from the scientific value of the expedi
tion all enjoyed the trip. The specimens
are still In the hold of the schooner un
der hatches sealed by the custom-house.
They will be landed within a few days.
Captain J. O. Hultberg, the commander
of the Mary Sachs, is a young man but. a
skillful navigator and well acquainted
with the waters in which he has been
cruising.
THE little schooner Mary Sachs,
sent from here nearly four months
ago by the Academy of Sciences
to gather specimens of birds
among the Revlllagigedo Island*,

The collection Included parrots, paro
quets, frigate birds and birds representing
all the numerous feathered families of
those southern latitudes. The expedition
v.as in charge of R. II. Beck, whom one
of the Mary Sachs' sailors described as
"a bird stuffer from away back." Beck
Is an ornithologist and has made several
previous trips In search of natural history
specimens, lie took as cssistants four

The trial of the suit of Andrew Coleman
against Mrs. Reeves-Atkinson to recover
$53 was begun in Justice Lawson's court
yesterday. The testimony developed that
Coleman had arranged to have his daugh
ter, Mrs. L. Saiinders, treated for nervous
trouble In the sanitarium kept by the de
fendant at 1S15 Butter street. He depos
ited $Stt for her keep, but at the end of
five days Dr. Saunders, her husband, in
sisted that she be allowed to leave the
place, threatening habeas corpus proceed
ings. Mrs. Atkinson telephoned to M. C.
Hassett, Coleman's attorney, that the pa
tient could leave and she would return the
180, less the cost of her maintenance for
five days. Mrs. Atkinson refused to re
turn the balance, claiming Mrs. Saunders
had left the place in her absence and she
had made no such agreement. Judge
Lawson took the case under advisement.

VALLEJO, Aug. 13.â The California
racing circuit opened to-day with a large
attendance at the track. A new track
record of 2:11>4 was established by the
pacer Ben F.
In the opening raca for the 2:17 Â» class
thirteen pacers appeared and the bad
luck that Is supposed to attend that num
ber was made manifest. Pinkie H, driven
by J. W. Zlbbell, broke some of her gear

in danger. - He won in -2:12Vi.- -The sec-

TORONTO, Ontario, Aug. 13.â The fifth

was started to-day. The course was a

Parry's speech this afternoon was an
arraignment of organized labcr in his
usual vein and elicited much applause.
David M. Parry, president of the Man

livered his address on "The Mob Spirit
In Organized Labor" In the morning, but
he was delayed and did not arrive until
this afternoon. Kidd was to nave fol
lowed him, but the other schedule was
upset and Kidd spoke first. However, he
was supplied with a summary of the' re
marks Parry purposed to make, and so
was able to some extent to anti.-Ipate the
points made.
CHAUTAUQUA. N. T.. An*. 11â
Thomas L. Kidd. vice president of tha
American Federation of Labor, opened
the discussion to-day on the- "Labor
Unions and the Mob Spirit." He assarted
that the leaders In labor riots were usu
ally recent converts to unionism, flushed
with the possession of power.
One explanation of riots advanced by
him was that thousands of workingmen
have been embittered by the conditions of
tTieir childhood and their experiences In
later life with the company store, and tha
ethics of greed and power arrayed against
them have made them more desperate.
Kidd insisted, however, that the per
centage of riots in labor troubles was
very small, saying that records of 2^000
strikes in seven year/ show less than f nÂ»
per cent attended by riots. He did not
believe Parry correctly represented the
employers of the country.
The employment of detectives and
agents who excite the men to violence*,
said Kidd, places much responsibility
upon certain employers.
The lawlessness of the few, he insisted,
should not obscure the good citizenship
of the majority of trade unionists.
The employer claims the right to con
duct his own business and the union In
sists upon the right to pass judgment
upon conditions under which the work la
done.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Aug. 13.â Since tha
eiglft-hour law went Into effect three
meetings have been held here in an at
tempt to adjust the differences between
the miners and the mine operators. A
committee of citizens was appointed at a
mass meeting, one from the miners and
one from the operators, to attempt a set
tlement. At an adjourned meeting to-day
of the operators* and miners' committees
the operators submitted a revised scale
of wages and hours, making important
concessions over the former scale, but the
proposition was flatly refused by the min
ers, who stated that no concessions would
be made from their scale* which practice
ally amounts to ten hours' pay for eight
hours' work.
The new scale offered by the operators
was as follows: For sinking dry shaft.
$3 50 per day; wet shaft, $4; raises, $3 50;
drifting, crosscutting, $3 25; stopers, muck
ers and trammers, $3; shovelers, $2 75;
machine men. $3; pumpmen and timber
men, $3 50. for eight hours' work and $(
for ten hours' work.
This is * said to be the highest scale
paid in the United States. Because of its
failure the operators will now abandon
further negotiations with the union and
will import miners.

Corbett, revealing lines in his face and
on his forehead which the eye does not
note so harshly, owing to Jim's vivacious
manner. , Jeffries' photos show him with
rugged features and without any lines of
care. His easy going disposition and the
apparent absence of nerves In his body
readily account for this.
In the matter of attendance the fight is
expected to rank with the greatest in the
history of the sport in this country. The
record house was that attracted to the
Jeffries-Fltzslmmons fight In New York.
The receipts, as given out. were $66,000.
Corbett and McCoy drew $62,000; Fitzsim
mons and Ruhlln, $55,000; Corbett and Jef
fries, J41.000; Fitzsimmons and Sharkey,
$26,000.
In this city Fitzsimmons and Jeffries
drew $31,800; Jeffries and Ruhlln, $30,400;
Sharkey and Fitzsimmons, $21,800; Corbett
and Sharkey (four rounds), $16,000. The
receipts of the New York fights are those
given out by the management. It Is un
derstood the receipts were much greater,
but the true figures were suppressed in
order that people would not get jealous of
the promoters.
The fighters will divide 70 per cent of
the gross \ receipts of to-night's fight.
Seventy-five per cent of this will 'go to
the victor and 25 per cent to the loser.
The odds remain at 2 to 1, but there is
comparatively little betting owing to the
lack of Corbett money.

their viewpoints could not be reconciled.
Each held that his man could not possi
bly Jose In to-night'e battle In Mechanics'
Pavilion for the heavy-weight champion
ship of the world.
Corbett's adherents Invariably point to
his going twenty-three rounds with Jef
fries in New York in May, 1900, during
which time the big boilermaker never put
a glove on him. It was when Corbett
changed his style of fighting In the last
round that he fell easy prey to Jeffries.
Since then Corbett has trained, as no
other nian ever trained before. He hap
effected a complete change in his muscu
lar system and at the same time has in
creased his weight slightly. Whether he
has replenished his store of vitality only
the actual conflict will develop.
His admirers try to draw a line on Jef
fries', present condition through his fights
with 'Ruhlln and Fitsslmmons. In both
of these he was noticeably, slow and delib
erate In his mode of attack and seemed to
have gone b,ack to a point where he de

IF it is the difference of opinion which
makes horseraclng, the same aphor

The friends of Jeffries and Corbett
The 2-year-old district pace brought out
four contestants. Sulsun won in jj two
straight heats in 2:43. Sweetheart was
second. The colts made a good showing.
The purses for the afternoon aggregat
ed $1300. The feature of Friday . after
noon's programme will be a 2:23 class trot,
with eighteen entries, for a $1000 purse.
The friends of Jeffries feel the appear
ance of the champion when he arrived at
Oakland on Wednesday justified all the
confidence they had placed in him. Seven
weeks in the open air of the -mountains
had worked, wonders in his condition. His
massive frame seemed to have 'taken on
more bulk, but with all his size he
showed the lines of the greatest natural
athlete that had ever stepped Into a ring.
It Is claimed for him that his method
of '.training has made him faster on his
feet than he has ever been.

The race proved a surprise to the talent.
The 2:12 trot developed nothing surpris

the time of their class. Tom Smith was
first under the wire In each heat. The
best time made was 2:12. Rozell got sec

"I do hot believe the stories about Jef

will show up in perfect form and I hope
he does. If I win I do not want people to
say I beat Jeffries when he was a~wreck.
I never received due credit for beating
Sullivan, some thinking he was on his
last legs, which was not the case. I
never caught any one napping that way.
When I fought them they were always at
their best."

which marked his fight with Fitzsimmons
in New York. Coupled with these condi

WOODLAND, Aug. 13.â As a result of
the San Bernardino decision declaring un
constitutional certain sections of the mu
nicipal corporation act, the city of Wood
land will make no further efforts to col
lect license tax imposed on commercial
business after the expiration of the pres
ent quarter. The ordinance Imposing such
will be ' repealed and a new ordinance
passed imposing license taxes upon cir
cuses, traveling shows and business of
like character. The loss to Woodland on
account of the license tax imposed under
the section of the municipal incorporaton
acf being declared invalid ; amounts to
nearly $3000. The regular tax levy will be
Increased about 14 cents to meet the de

It is only Justice to say that neither
Jeffries nor Corbett has anything to do
with this proceeding. " They are as
much chagrined over the state of af
fairs as any of the victims. They are
receiving no profit from the Increased
prices and while they cannot be damaged
pecuniarily by any lack of attendance
they are angry at being made the cats
paws of a clique of men who at heart
have neither decency, common honesty nor
the welfare of the fighting game to deter
them, from this scandalous course.
bulk of the tickets for the Cor
bett-Jeffrles fight to-night to fall into the
hands of scalpers and the public at large
can come to no other conclusion than that
the whole affair was premeditated in or
der to wring from a fight-crazed and long
suffering city additional prices for admis
sion to the ringside.
When the seats were first put on sale
at prices ranging from $3 to $20 each,
which in all reason are the highest prices
that should be charged for any exhibition
of this kind, the legitimate sale of tick
ets was such as to Justify the belief that
the largest crowd that ever attended a
"prize fight in this city would gather at
the Pavilion on this occasion. Men con
nected with the Yosemite Club and in a
position to give a good estimate confi
dently predicted that the house would
bring between $50,000 and $60,000, which
would mean that the capacity of the
building would be taxed.
Suddenly, after the tickets had been on
sale only a few hours it was announced
that all the $5, $10 and $13 seats had been
sold. What prompted this sudden rush
a week before the fight could not'be un
derstood by outsiders. Men who* have
been going to fights for years on applying
for a seat were confronted with the in
formation that there was none left. Why
this should be so was a mystery until
they started to walk away from the tick
et counter, when they would be tapped
on the arm by a scalper and offered a
choice seat at an advance of from 20 to
50 per cent over the original purchase
price.
For a week past every tout and rounder
in the tenderloin seemed laden down with
bundles of dght tickets, hawking them
about for a premium over the regular
price, and those who wished to attend
the fight were forced to dicker with them
for seats or remain away. In many cases
exorbitant prices were asked and all of
them demanded at least 20 per cent over
the original price.
It is useless for the managers of the
Yosemite Club to deny that they are par
ties to this fraud on a sport loving pub
lic. Under no possible conditions could
these blocks of tickets have come into
the possession of the class of men who
are handling them without the connivance
of those who are at the head of the ar
rangements for the fight. The conclu
sion is inevitable that those having the
fight in charge are participating in the
fraudulent profits obtained by this cor
raling of tickets and are taking advan
tage of their position to steal the public's
money.

An unusually large bet was made last
night on the Corbett-Jeffries fight, when
Harry Mitchell of Cincinnati wagered $1000
against 13000 that Jim Corbett would win
the fight in twelve rounds. Nat Goodwin,
the actor, put up $2500 and Luke Kelly of
San Pedro the other $2500 of the bet.
Blg Bet at Corbett's.
In the afternoon Jim took matters easily
and about 4 o'clock went for an eight
mile walk with Sam Berger, Jimmy Britt
and a few Trienfls. If he feels like it Cor
bett will do some very light exercising
this morning in the gymnasium.
After the two rounds with Berger, big
Tank Kenny was called into the arena
and Corbett went at him and trounced
the plant around for two rounds more.
Corbett did not lash out with ail his force,
as be feared that he might possibly In
jure his hands.
Two rounds with the small punching
bag completed Jim's morning work. He
proved to several doctors present that his
wind was of the best.
"gathered about him at his
training quarters at Croll's Gardens, in
Alameda, yesterday morning. Just before
he went into his gymnasium to don his
exercising attire. And then to Frankle
Nell, who was departing for San Fran
rlsoo.- the ex-champion said: "Tou go
right at that fellow Forbes, Frankie, and
fight him in the way that Jeffries should
fight me."
Then Corbett got quickly out of his
street clothes and into his gymnasium
trtg-s. He took a twirl at the flying rings,
walked on his hands like a circus per
former, bent himself over a box about
fifty times to give the muscles over his
stomach a final test, arched himself on
the tips of his fingers and toes, swung In
between the parallel bars half a dozen
tiroes, bucked like a colt and raced out of
the gymnasium and clambered; into his
open-air ring. There he sparred two
rounds with Sam Berger, revealing an
elasticity of foot that was a surprise to
those who had never seen Corbett step
ping about at his liveliest. Jim, appeared
to be all over the roped inclosure at once.
He sprang back and 6lde-stepped as If he
were on springs, and Berger, although a
speedy man hlmscJf. never once got the
ex-champion In a false position, or one
where Jim was not prepared to defend
himself and make the other fellow
know it.
/ * y|- WOULD give my two arms to]
C C ji -win my flsbt with Jeffries,"
I "said James J. Corbett to a
. "â¢ number of his friends who were
Jefries arose yesterday morning at 10
o'clock and had a hearty breakfast at 1L
He then loafed around Oakland until he
went to the Reliance Club, shortly before
4 in the afternoon. There he was met by
Fitzsimmons. amr-t)oth deciding that it
would be foolish to box at this late datÂ«\
they parted, to meet to-day at noon.
Fitzsimmons will dine with Jeffries about
1 o'clock and they will come across the
bay together at 6 in the evening.
All who saw Jeffries were favorably Im
pressed with his appearance. The* wound
on his right leg, Just below the\knee,
where the bear bit him, is completely
healed and there is only a small scar to
show the spot. He also has a slight scar
on his right forearm, a few inches above
the wrist, also caused by the bear. The
wounds ars entirely healed and cannot
interfere with Jeffries at all when he
enters the ring.
When asked to make a statement while
he was being rubbed down, Jeffries said:
"Oh, I haven't anything much to say. I
never felt better in my life. It Is no usÂ©
talking about what I am going to do in
the ring and how I am going to fight I
don't really know how I will fight until I
face Corbett and see how things axe go
ing."
On being asked how much he weighed
Jeffries professed ignorance, but hla
brother, who was standing near at the
time, said the champion would enter the
ring weighing 215 pounds.
CUTS OUT BOXING.
The champion then started in on the
shadow boxing and kept hard at It for
twenty-three minutes. He darted up and
down the room with the agility of a
panther, and all those present who had
not seen him for some time were unani
mous in the decision that he had im
proved wonderfully In speed. "When hs
first started to spar at Imaginary figures
hla skin was tanned and brown, but In a
few minutes the color had changed to
pink and muscles which a moment before
were unobservable became prominent.
Gradually perspiration began to assert it
self on his shoulders and by the time he
finished side-stepping and making ter
rific smashes at an Imaginary foe he was
covered with perspiration. All through
his work, however, his wind never bother
ed him and he seemed Just as strong and
active whan he finished as when he first
began.
As his brother threw him the skipping
rope at the close of his shadow boxing,
Jeffries said with a good-natured smile:
"Gee, but I feel great. I wish I was
fighting to-night."
Then he skipped the rope for ten min
utes. Jesting with friends all the time.
Everybody who received a nod of recogni
tion or a word of salutation felt duly
proud, and there was a continual tound
of Joking. At the close of his work Jef
fries was rubbed down and bis work was
finished for the day.
ANXIOUS TO FIGHT.
pion do a little light work and in
a general way to get a line on him. Those
who expected to see a lively go between
Jeffries and Fitzsimmons were disap
pointed, as at the last moment it was de
cided that It would be foolish for Jeffries
to take any chances of setting injured in
tha slightest degree before he entered the
ring to-night.
Jeffries* work was confined to shadow
boxing and skipping the rope. He entered
the gymnasium shortly after 4 o clock,
stripped down to black trunks. Before
commencing his work he posed for the
newspaper cameras. This photographing:
took up at least half an hour.

STcCLOSKY'S MEN SHTCJT OUT.
Just as the bout was about to end
Sullivan put his right to the jaw and
Landers all but collapsed. He man
aged to keep away. and thus saved him
self from being knocked out. Sullivan
had numerous chances to win but
seemed' to ignore all openings. In the
fourth he caught Landers flush on the
Jaw and staggered him, "but kept away
long enough to allow Landers to re
cover. :
The third round was opened with a
lively exchange of rights and lefts, in
which Cordell came out ahead. This
seemed to denote the turning point of
the mill. Kane began to weaken and
Cordell went right after him. lie stag
gered Kane with a hard left to the head
and in a twinkling rushed him into a
corner of the ring, raining blow after
blow on Kane's head. The latter slow
ly sank to the floor and his seconds,
seeing that he was all out, threw up the
sponge.
Dan Sullivan and Fred Landers, two
lightweights, well known In the amateur
ranks, opened the evening's entertain
ment with a ten-round go which con
tained a deal of good, bad and indifferent
fighting. Sullivan was awarded the de
cision by Referee Milton Hayes. The
decision did not seem to please the gal
lery In the least and Hayes was roundly
hissed. The decision was just,, inas
much as Sullivan had his man all but
out when the gong sounded. A draw
would have probably been the better
verdict, as Landers was game through
out and really had the better of the ar
gument in every round . save the last
three.
Sullivan's showing was a disappoint
ment. He did not show his speed till
the eighth round. Then lie began to hus
tle his opponent around in a lively man
ner. He landed several hard punches
on the jaw and stomach and had Lan
ders' Jn distress, though he withstood
the punishment gamely and fought back
all the time.
Milton Hayes refused to referee the
bout on account of the way he was
hissed for his previous performance, so
"Spider" Kelly consented to act. The
boys started to right at the tap of the
gong and went at it fast and furious,
each landing many clean blows and
blocking nicely.
Cordell took the lead during the sec
ond round and never lost it. His vitality
and strength were too much for Kane,
though the latter was too good a ring
general to allow his opponent to catch
him unawares.
out and went down before a volley of
rights and lefts. He tried to rise, but
his seconds threw up the sponge. Cor
dell took his vanquished opponent in his
arms and carried him to his corner amid
the cheers of the crowd.

chanics' Pavilion. The contest
came to an abrupt end in the second
round, when Forbes was counted out
after havins been knocked down three
times. .
In the first round Neil suffered by com
parison with Forbes, who proved much
the more showy boxer. The Chicagoan
broke through Neil's guard repeatedly,
but there was no steam behind the blows,
which seemed to have no effect on Neil.
Toward the end of the round Neil scored
several times to the head and body with
his left and shook up Forbes noticeably.
While Neil weighs less than 115 pounds,
he is a. natural hitter, his blows appar
ently having the punishing effect of a
much heavier man. Forbes was the ag
gressor in the first round, keeping after
Nell continually. He commenced these
tactics in the second round. Nell was
seen to whip his left over to the stomach
suddenly with terrific force and Forbes
went down on his back on the floor.
Forbes, in pantomime, claimed a foul,
but Referee Graney, who saw the blow
land, shook his head. The remorseless
timekeeper kept tolling off the seconds
until nine had been counted, when Forbes
was on his feet. Neil scented victory in
the air and went at Forbes again vicious
ly. Another left to th6 body sent Forbes
down again. This time he was up at the
count of eight. Neil made a rush at him
and fell down, partly because he was hit
and partly because of a misstep. He was
up in an instant and rushed at Forbes.
The latter was wrestled ' down. As he
commenced to rise Neil sent a stiff blow
to the chin and Forbes fell on his back
on the edge of the ring, with his left leg
in the. air. George Harting, the veteran
watch holder, counted off the seconds
quite plainly. He was noting the move
ment of the second hand on his stop
watch and dwelt on the word "nine."
This was followed by "You're out."
Forbes was not up at the count of ten
and lost his hard-won title of bantam
weight champion. Forbes claims the
blows of Neil did not distress him and
that he was feigning being injured In or
der to draw the fire of his opponent. To
the spectators at the ringside it was evi
dent Forbes was hurt by the blows about
the body, and some said Referee Graney
would have been justified in stopping the
fight to prevent Forbes from being un
necessarily punished.
Neil is a. natural fighter, with gameness
and hitting power out of all proportion
to his size. He has but little knowledge
of ringmanship, having had but few
fights. He stopped Forbes with the same
blow with which he knocked out his
brother, Clarence Forbes, some months
since.
Forbes Is unfortunate is not being able
to live down the reputation he gained on
his last trip to this coast. After the fight
there was talk on the street and in the
sporting resorts that all was not as It
should be. A well-known young sporting
man, who bet heavily on Neil, boasted in
the Palace Hotel grill that he "put a
crimp in one of the fighters."
Forbes was a 1 to 2 chance until late
in the ;afternoon, when some heavy com
missions on Neil sent the odds to 7 to 10.
Neil was seconded by Spider Kelly, Tim
McGrath and Australian Tim Murphy.
In Forbes' corner were John Hertz, Billy
Otts and Jack O'Kcefc.
The attendance was small, the total
gate receipts being $2C06. The ring used
was that in which Jeffries and Corbett
will meet to-night. It is the regulation
twenty-four feet square, and seems of
immense' area when compared with the
twenty foot affair usually used.

Ham Ibfrg suffered from his old com
r'-fiir.t of hard lurk all the <{ , time. He
pitched goo<3 enough ball to ivin almost
any game, but th** team dnB not hit at
â¢til behind him and they supported him
rather shabbily ju.Â«t at the times when
h* moft needed good barking. He had a
lot of fpeed and a good slow ball, which
Â«as very effective till the Cripples got
to i; in the tenth.
Peter I/iliman had a new amateur.
T\ho he threw in Â«t third, and the
v^ungster helped to win by slamming out
a double in the last inning. His name
la Smith and he is a member of the Royal
*"lub of Oakland. He played the game in
pood form throughout, accepting five
chances at third without an error.
Graham had his left wing working
about right and after the third inning the
hume team never touched him once. He
v.as a trifle Â¦wild, issuing six passes, but
outside of that weakness the southpaw
I itched a swell article of ball.
Two hits and an error by O'Hara In the
second produced thÂ« only run of the game
for San Francisco. The Cripples could
not approach the pan till the same part
of the round, when an error and a few
lively mixups en the bags gave them one
run. Then in the fifth they found Iberg
for the first two hits and these brought
in another tally and created a deadlock.
Young Smith opened up the tenth with
a liner to left field that was good for a
pair of bai=es. O'Hara laid down a bunt
and beat it to first. Then Francks was
hit by the pitcher and the bags were filled
to overflowing, burdock smote a-hy in
â¢;ho direction of Krug and as soon as the
>ail was caught Smith tried to beat the
throw to the plate. He would have been
rt tired easily only Krug threw far above
Kelly's head and the youngster was safe

was just getting up, but was waiting for
the ninth to sound, when suddenly I saw
referee Graney motion to Nell and tell
him that he had won the battle. I did not
hear 'nine counted, and I am sure I was
not counted out.
"I am ready -to. take on Neil again, and
I know I can beat him. I admit he Is a
great little fighter, and Is game to the
core. I think after this meeting I deserve
another try."
Frankie Nell was surrounded by a
throng of admiring friends In his dress
ing-room, and he looked a conqueror
every inch of him. "Why, there Is noth
ing to it," said Frankie. "I had him
beaten handily. He was out, as every one
who was watching will tell you. This talk
of his about stalling is all rot. When 1
hit him in the stomach the 'first time he
was all but finished. I took matters coolly
and sent him down again. He got up and
began to rush me and pushed me over.
That ts hdw I fell. I admit Forbes is a
great little man, but I beat him fairly. I
played for the stomach all the time, but I
did not foul him."
Referee Eddie Graney said after the
fight that the blows struck by Neil were
ajl fair and regular knockouts. "I think
Neil won fairly and squarely," said Gra
ney. "I was In doubt about the count out
at first, for I was watching the men and
did not have a chance to observe Harting.
I went over to him and he told me that
Forbes had been counted out and that
Neil was the winner. The counting was
up to the timekeeper, and not to me."
John Hertz, who looks after Forbes' in
terests, had little to say. "I was not in
a position to observe the count," said
Hertz, "but Morris Levy, who was keep
ing time for me, said he heard only eight
counted and that Forbes was not out. I
am willing to match Forbes for another
go with Xeil, and I think he can beat
him. Many of those blows looked foul to
me, though I have nothing to say In re
gard to them."

STRIKE ON LAKE STEAMER.
Firemen Quit Work Because They
Are Not Served Mashed Potatoes.
CHICAGO. Aug. 13.â Because six of its
members are in jail In South Haven,
Mich., charged with mutiny, the Marine
Firemen's Union has declared war on the
large passenger steamer Eastland, and
say that it shall not leave port until the
men have been released.
The six firemen quit work to-day while
the boat was in the middle of Lake Mich
igan and refused to perform their duty
because they were . not served with
mashed potatoes at dinner. Glenn Wat-
Bon and William Watson, who are
charged by the officers of the boat with
being the ringleaders, were put in irons
and their companions were driven below
and kept prisoners until the boat reached
South Haven, when they were all man
acled and marched to Jail.
The boat left Chicago with fifty-five
passengers, bound for South Haven.
About noon, when It had reached the
middle of the lake, the machinery stopped
and when Captain Peru hastened to learn
the cause of the trouble he \fras con
fronted by the firemen, who said they
would not work because they had not
been served with mashed potatoes.
The cook explained that the first crew
at dinner had eaten all the mashed pota
toes, but that more were In preparation
and would be ready in a few minutes.
In the meanwhile the men were offered
plain boiled potatoes and these were re
fused, the men declining at the same time
to go to work.
The captain gave the men three minutes
to go to work, after the boat had been
delayed twenty minutes, and the men re
fusing, he summoned the officers of the
ship and placed them under arrest. The
ringleaders made a hard fight before they
were subdued, but were finally placed In
irons. Two firemen remained on duty and
with these steam was got up and the boat
â¢went on to South Ilaven.
The officers of the Marine Firemen's
Union support their men In. the. action
taken, and declare they will, call a strike
on the steamer and that no 'firemen will
work 'on her.

revealing strong evidence of opium pois
oning. Coroner Mehrmann has ordered a
close investigation Into the cause of death
In the case of Viola Magee, a nurse,

Twelfth street. The woman had been em
ployed to attend Mrs. Wilklns, who is an
invalid.
Dr. L. R. Webster, who was called Im
mediately after the body was found, said
the external evidence pointed to opium
poisoning or to alcoholism. There was
nothing to indicate suicide.
The body was taken to tho Morgue,
where an autopsy was held to-night by
Dr. C. E. Curtis and Dr. G. G. Reinle.
The evidence of opium poisoning was so
strongly manifested that the surgeons
said they were prepared to testify that
this was the cause of death. To fully
verify their decision they removed the
stomach and will make a chemical analy
sis of Us contents to-morrow. Dr. Reinle
said:
"I am satisfied that some form of opium
caused death. On what was revealed by
the autopsy I am prepared to so testify.
But to clinch the matter the contents of
the stomach will be analyzed. Coroner
Mehrmann Informed me after the autopsy
that It had been reported to him that
the woman had used morphine."
The dead nurse was 40 years old. Her
residence was at 953 Clay street.

ALAMEDA, Aug. 13.â Another tack is
being taken toward settling the two lo
cal railroad franchises by those who are
not satisfied with the methods being pur
sued by the City Trustees and the Citi
zens' Advisory Committee of Fifty. The
latest move to dispose of the agitation
which has disturbed Alameda for six
weeks Is to have the questions at issue
passed upon by the voters of the city,
and with that-^nd in view the following
petition has been placed In circulation and
will be presented to the City Trustees
next Monday night:
To the Honorable the Board of Trustees of
the City of Alameda â Gentlemen: We, the
qualified voters, electors of the City of Ala
meda, undersigned, hereby respectfully peti
tion your honorable board to immediately call
a special election In accordance with 'the pro
vUion* of your ordinance. No. 270. for the pur
pose of obtaining an expression ot opinion of
the electors of said City cf Alameda upon ques
tions^ of local public Interest pending before
your honorable board, and which we ask to be
submitted at such â¢ election, substantially in
the following form, viz. :
Firstâ Shall franchises be granted authoriz
ing propulsion of'cars on Railroad avenue and
on Encinal avenue by electric power Instead of
Â¦team/
Secondâ If franchise is granted for steam
power, shall it require that local passengers be
carried free between stations east of Mastick
and Pacific avenue stations?
Third â Shall the steam railroad tracks on
Railroad avenue, between Fifth and Eighth
Btreets, bo removed?
â¢ Fourth â Shall stations be maintained at
Fifth aJid Webster streets, north shore?
Fifth â Shall a monetary consideration for the
franchises exceeding $300 a month be required?
Sixth â What .shall be the term of the fran
chises?
There is a city ordinance with respect
to the operation of the referendum, but
there is some question as to whether 1t
can be invoked at the present time as
tTelng applicable to the franchise situa
tion. It provides that upon petition pre
sented Â¦ not less than fifteen days prior
to a general or municipal election ques
tions_upon which the. petitioners desire to
obtain public sentiment may be voted
upon, but even that vote, it Is held, is
not binding upon the City Trustees, only
advisory. As the next municipal election
is a year and a half distant, and as the
next ceneral election will not occur until
November of next year, it is not seen
how the franchise matter can be sub
mitted to a vote before the first of those
elections.
It Is unofficially reported that the South
ern Pacific management intends to with
draw the application it has made for the
franchise on the north side or Railroad
avenue line. The- company has always
operated this road without a franchise,
holding: that it owns right of way and
is independent of municipal control. It
Is also understood that the Southern Pa
cific will not be likely to accept the fran
chises on the terms to. be embodied in
the ordinance" to be submitted to the City
Trustees next Monday night, and that
the company will continue to operate its
local roads' until It obtains the franchises
on its own^terms, or until some legal
action Is taken to prevent the operating
of the roads without franchises.
HAYWARDS, Aug. 13.â A belated citi
zen going home about midnight last
night discovered the body of a man sus
pended from a branch cf a tree In the
heart of town. The citizen who found
him hastily summoned Deputy Coroner
Dolner, who, calling upon Dr. C. E. Rey
nolds, repaired with him to the scene.
Great excitement and much speculation
prevailed as to the Identity of the man
Euspended from the branch. â¢
There was a short discussion as to the
best way of getting the body down, when
Dr. Reynolds drew his knife, and, with
all eyes centered upon him, began to
climb the tree In order to reach the rope
and sever It and thus allowt the supposed
corpse to be lowered to the ground. The
body hung in the moonlight, still as a
stone. The head was tilted over to one
side, as If the weight attached to the
rope had thrown it into that position.
As the doctor^eached the branchi from
which the body was supended a slight
movement was noticeable about the form,
apparently stiff and stark, and as the doc
tor was about to lay the knife to the rope
the spectators were electrified by seeing
the arms of the supposed corpse suddenly
extend themselves, and then, hand over
hand, the man raised himself to the
branch above. Doctor and corpse faced
each other on the limb of the tree, while
a laugh broke from the ring of people
gathered around.
The body proved to be that of Ernest
Baumelster. The deception was carried
out by having the rope first go around his
body under the arms, thus supporting his
weight. He allowed himself to be sus
pended in this manner by some compan
ions, who then hid themselves And
awaited developments. The Coroner is
threatening arrest, while the doctor says
that that official owes him for a midnight
call.
EXTRA SESSION MAY
BE CALLED IN OCTOBER
Sub-Committee on Finance Desires to
Have Plan of Bill Definitely
Formulated.
OYSTER BAY, Aug. 13.â The Aldrich
sub-committe* to draft a financial bill
after the meeting with President Roose
velt made the following announcement
to-day :
"The sub-committee of the Finance
Committee of the Senate desires to be in
constant touch with the President, with
the Secretary of the Treasury, with mem
bers of the House of Representatives,
with bankers West and East and with
country bankers as well as city bankers,
so that it can have some plan definitely
formulated by the time of the extra
session of Congress, whether it occurs in
October or November. An extra session
surely will be called. What the commit
tee has done is merely tentative, and
while It would be an easy thing to draw
a bill which the committee might agree
on it is another thing to draw one which
can be passed, and that is a very import
ant matter."

One of the two footpads who have been
comrMtting robberies in the North Beach
district for the last two weeks was caught
while plying his calling early this morn
ing by Policemen Cavanaugh and Mathie
s-on and Detectives Freel and Reynolds.
These officers have been en the lookout
for more than a week for the footpads
whose numerous operations were reported
to the police. Mathleson and Cavanaugh
were standing at the corner of Stockton
and Lombard streets and Reynolds and
Freel were at Lombard and Powell
streets when they were attracted by the
repeated scream* of a woman coming
from the direction of Montgomery ave
nue.
As o;::ckly as possible they rushed in
that direction and on arriving there found
a. roughly dressed man struggling In the
'grasp cf a man and a woman, and en
deavoring to escape. They overpowered
lum and were soon acquainted with the
fact that their prisoners was one of the
much soucht footpads. He was recog
nized as John Busch, a character well
known to the police, with a long record
cf crimes to answer for.
Mr, and Mrs. Claraty were the !aÂ«t vic
tfSni of the robber. The husband is a
v:Â«Â°rk employed by M. A. Gunst & Co.
and the couple were on their way to their
borne at 7SÂ£ Chestnut street when they
v.ere stopped by Buseh. who held a re
volver "and told them to hand over their
valua'uk's. The footpad had his face con
cealed fcebfod a black scarf with slits in
Jt for eyeholes. Claraty grappled with
the man and his wife went to his as-
Fistance. emitting scream after scream
daring the struggle. The robber tried
hard to get away*, but the coupla clung
to him until the arrival of fou/ police
.ff.oers. 'â¢
Boacb was taken to the Central station
and five charges of robbery and one for
assault -to murder were placed against
Mm. ThÂ« latter charge grew out of a cut
ting scrape in South San Francisco some
time ago.
The.pfisor.er is an ex-convict. Aided by
Tony Leront, who was arrested two days
aco. he is supposed to have committed
ai! the robberies that have been reported
from the North Ecach district lately. The
police art much elated over what they
consider an important capture and the
fact that he was caught in. the actual
t ommission cf one of his crimes.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
\V., WASHINGTON. Aug. 13.-For ad
dressing to the Nary Department what
the officials regarded as an Impertinent
letter. Colonel Robert L. Meade. United
States Marine Corps, will by order of the
President be placed upon the retired list
on October 31 next, when he will have
reached the age of 62 years. The law
provides that officers of the army upon
reaching the age of 62 years may, at the
discretion of the President, be placed
upen the retired list, and the same law
applies to the marine corps.
Colonel Meade recently filed an appli
cation for retirement upon his sixty-sec
ond birthday and requested that he be
retired with the advanced rank of brig
adier general. The Attorney General ren
dered an opinion that retirement with the
advanced rank was not permissible under
the law in the case of officers of the ma
rine corps. Colonel Meade's Truest could
not, therefore be granted, but upon the
recommendation of the acting Secretary
of the Navy the President approved Col
onel Meade's application for retirement
and the order was prepared.
Learning that he vvas to be retired in
his present grade. Colonel Meade address
ed a letter to the Navy Department ask
ing permission to withdraw his applica
tion. The tone cf the letter was not to
the liking of t..e acting Secretary or other
officials of the department. It Is under
stood that in his letter Colonel Meade
charged that the department had Ignored
the conditions upon which he asked to
be retired, namely, that he be retired
with advanced rank. The Navy Depart
ment did not consider that Colonel
Meade's original application stated that
.request as a condition.
Acting Secretary Darling disposed of
the case by forwarding to the President
Colonel Meade's last letter, with the rec
ommendation that Colonel Meade be re
tired October 31 next by order of the Pres
ident.
From Oyster Bay the papers have been
received approved by the President and
an order for Colonel Meade's retirement
has been made out. The order does not
allude to the circumstances under which
Colonel Meade will be retired. Colonel
Meade Is now in charge of the barracks
at Mare Island.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
214S Center Street, Aug. 13.
Professor Edward Bull Clapp, professor
of the Greek language and literature at
the University of California, was one of
the few Americans present at Belgrade,
in Servla, the night King 'Alexander and
his beautiful consort. Queen Draga, were
assassinated by the military. Professor
Clapp returned to the university to-day
after a year's absence, spent in travel
over Europe, and related his experiences
at that critical time in Servian history.
"The night the King and Queen were
assassinated," said Professor Clapp. "it
was peaceful and quiet In the city of
Belgrade. I approached the city that
night In a steamer, coming down the
Danube River from Bucharest, the capital
of Roumanla, where I Had spent some
few days.
"As we approached the city I saw a
brilliantly lighted place on a bluff over
hanging the river. It seemed to be full
of life and merriment. I asked a young
Frenchman, whom I had met on the boat,
what that place was, and he replied that
It was the konakâ the palace of King
Alexander and Queen Draga.
"This y conversation -occurred about D
o'clock and a little later we landed at the
city's wharves. I retired early, as I ex
pected to get up at 4:30 o'clock to catch
a train going to another part of the coun
try. When I went downstairs to the hotel
office at that hour the proprietor said to
me: 'Did you hear what happened in the
night?' I said I had not. and then he
went on to tell me how the conspirators
of the army had attacked the palace In
the night and killed the King and Queen.
"I saw that if I 6tayed I might be de
tained in the city for an Indefinite length
of time and so I hurried oft to the rail
road station. In fact, the very next day
the city was made subject to martial law.
in which state it remained four or five
days. I had some trouble getting out of
the city as it was, the officials being very
careful In their scrutiny of the pass I car
ried.
"I am not sure what the feeling of the
people was toward the King and Queen.
It was all very quiet' in Belgrade the day
after the murders, but I think this was
due more to fear of the military than the
satisfaction of the people. No doubt the
people were afraid to express their real
feelings. I heard that some time before
the murders the King and Queen were re
peatedly cheered at a public meeting, ap
parently Indicating that there was no
feeling against them."
Professor Clapp met many famous
Greek scholars during his absence and
gathered new ideas in the classical fields
of Southern Europe. He visited Oxford,
Goettingen, Munich and Berlin In Ger
many; Greece, Asia Minor and Turkey.
At- Berlin he met Professor Wllamowltz,
the world's most famous classical scholar,
who was greatly interested In American
students. Greece he found to be a much
stronger, cleaner nation than when he
visited It eighteen years ago ana was sur
prised at the acuteness of the Greek peas
ants, who have acquired some Knowledge
of the ancient Greek language.
LONDON. Aug. 13.--A dispatch to the
Central News from Vienna says the en
tire Servian Ministry has resigned In con
sequence of the in the per
sonal relations between army officers who
participated In the assassination of King
Alexander and Queen Draga and those
who took no part in the murders.
The Daily Telegraph prints a dispatch
from Vienna which says there are uncon
firmed reports that King Peter of Servla
has threatened to abdicate, as he is vir
tually a prisoner In the hands of the mil
itary party.
VIENNA. Aug. 13.â It Is said that King
Peter/ has invited Johan Avakumovitch,
the Premier both under the late King and
himself, to reconstruct the Servian Cab
inet with the Idea of excluding the three
Ministers whose irreconcilable attitude
precipitated the crisis, as they refused to
consent to the military credits unless all
stateN officials who enjoyed the late King's
confidence were dismissed. It Is said that
the discipline of the army has been se
verely shaken and that a difficult task
confronts King Peter unless he shall be
able to get the upper hand of the military
party by proceeding against the recent
conspirators.
WASHINGTON,' Aug. 13.â Acting Sec
retary Darling to-day received from Cap
tain Emery, commanding the Indiana, the
senior officer present, the report of the
board appointed to investigate the acci
dent to the hull of the Massachusetts yes
terday at East Harbor, Maine. Captain
Emery reports that two compartments of
the battleship are full of waterâ In all
about 390 tons. Slight leaks In other com
partments aro reported and athwart ship
there is a crack about eighteen inches long
and a half inch wide. A second crack ex
tends four feet across the plate and four
teen Inches in the seam.
Orders have been sent to the Brooklyn
navy yard to get the dock there In readi
ness for the Massachusetts, which Is to
go there for repairs, which may cost a
large sum. One hundred thousand dol
lars wa3 spent on the Massachusetts when
she grounded In New York harbor in 1S00.
The pilot was suspended for that acci
dent.
BAR HARBOR, Maine. Aug. 13.â Late
this afternoon divers who had been ex
amining the United States battleship
Massachusetts, which had her forward
plates cracked while leaving the harbor
in a fog yesterday, found that she was
more seriously damaged than was at first
thought to be the case, as the ship was

Â£ove tricked justice out of her prey to
day when the District Attorney moved
for a dismissal of the charge of grand
larceny against William ' E Barnes on

him fruit and flowers and attempted to
have the case asalnst him dismissed^
Harnes. however, had become entangled
In the maehlr.ery of the law. and could
not be frerd./ ' ,.
Barnes hnd been in jaiV several weeks
and both District Attorney and Judge had
been Interceded with to dismiss the ac
tion, which neither would take upon
himself to do. Woman's wit. then

nothing for Barnes but to go to trial. He
could be liberated 'on bonds and Judge
Ellsworth fixed them at WOO. w,nich Mrs.
Hughes supplied. Once free it was a
short step from the ctiurt to the County
Clerk's office, where a license was se
cured and In less than an hour Mrs.
Hughes had become Mrs. Barnes. The
formal dismissal of the case to-day was
the final act necessary to free Barnes.

"Oh. I tried one of those hair tonica
some time ago and it never did me a bit
of good."
That's what mcfny people are saying to-
day when they refuse Herpicide a trial.
It would be as sensible to say. "I never
travel on a railroad because I often see
collisions mentioned In the papers."
N'ewbro's Herpicide Is specially made to
destroy the germ that Is living on the
roots of your hair.
That Is wh,y It la so exceedingly effica-
ciousâ It is there for the sole purpose of
ridding the hair of this parasitic growth
after which the hair grows as nature in-
tended.

business. ' Offerings of Sweets showed better
quality than those previously received and sales
were readily effected at .higher rates. Onions
of desirable size and quality were steady, but
common offerings were dull.

easier. The third car of Western for the week
was on sale and the receipts of domestic aggre
gated over 200 coops. Over 700 coods of do

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Rather more steadiness Is reported In all
these markets. There is less disposition to
make concessions to work off the goods, stocks
are lighter. Cheese excepted, and teh demand
is rather better, probably owing to the Increas

the same.

The fruit market continued well supplied,
particularly with second quality Pears. Peaches

No. 2 stock sold well to canners and others at

wanted for shipment. Fancy Apples, Plums,
Peaches and choice offerings of Grapes were
also In demand for shipment and desirable lots
readily commanded the top quotations. Com
mon and' Inferior offerings were abundant and
easy. Figs and Nectarines were scarce and .
continued to sell quickly at steady rates. Some
small packnjjeR of FIrs were received from So
noma and 60M at 50Q75C per box. There was
no established price for Apricots, receipts being
very light. .Occasional sales were reported,
however, at $30 per tori; â¢ Melon* were fairly
steady, despite the cool, cloudy weather, there
heirs some Inquiry for shipment north. Sup
plies, however, were ample. Strawberries and
Raspberries were in â¢ light receipt and steady.
The lattet- wern quoted higher. Blackberries
arrived freely and as a considerable portion of
the receipts were poor and eoft, price* ranged
lower.
There was nothing new In Citrus fruits, all
descriptions being in free supply and trade
light. There were no ripe Bananas on the
market, but green stock was plentiful.

NEW YORK. Aug. 13. â The recuperative
forces in the stock market gathered resources
to-day, with the result of 'a buoyant uprush In
prices on a very animated buying movement.
There was activity during the forenoon of the
market that promised a large day's business
for the year. The market afterward .showed
some signs of weariness at the rate of the
movement. The recovery was the result of a
6eries cf incidents rather than of any one de
velopment. Natural reaction from the recently
prevailing extreme depression was an Important
factor. The mere sentimental effect of the
recovery after the gloom and apprehension that
have prevailed so long In Wall street was con
siderable. Immense relief from the constant
threat of lorced liquidation of bankruptcy,
which it Is not unfair to assume has been hang
lng over some houses, nearly predisposed the
whole financial community to take a more
cheerful view of rroÂ»pects. Where efforts for
a long time past to market securities have
met with tlmofit no demand, there was substi
tuted a lively and urgent demand for stocks ajid
I bonds of all grades to-day. The urgency of
seme of the buying and the violent advances in
prices showed clearly enough that efforts by
â¢iistressed shorts to cover their contracts be
fore the rebound carried prices beyond their
reach were an Important element in the mar
ket. Bidding up of prices by opposing profes
sionals to force higher prices out of the bears
was another palpable influence. But It was
evident beyond this that there was a large and
substantial buying clement In the market which
' was taking over stocks of all classes with free
dom and confidence. It ts not to be presumed
thnt the buyers have fo suddenly changed their
opinion of the financial and business outlook.
But the conviction has been growing that the
long decline in price* has been more than suf
ficient to offset the unfavorable factors in the
situation and that the necessities of the money
Fltuation have been forcing thÂ» selling of Â»ecu
ritSf-s below their true value. The event proves
thÂ» contention of those who have maintained
that there was a large waiting demand for
stocks, which would come . into the market
freely when the liquidation seemed to" be con
cluded and prices definitely turned upward.
The taking over of the Seaboard Air Line in
the interest of Rock Island had a stimulating
â¢ ffect upon the speculative imagination. It
furnished proof that not all the large Interests
were hard pressed to hold their undigested sp*
curitifs. and that the financial necessities In
wto quarters rr.izht prove the opportunity in
others for extending- Influence and consolidat
ing control. Rock Island itself, as well as
P<-.iitherr) Railway. Illinois Central and Louis
ville and Nashville, all shared in the day's
strrrrpth. reflecting the Impression that the new
nrrancements tend to community of interest in
the Southern railroad field. A number of stocks
r.' minor railroads, supposedly available for ab
sorption by more powerful nelghbrv. were
KtroriK. The feature of the day was Reading.
Its sensational rise of SNt rave rise to many
rumors retarding new projects. divlBion of con

quire no ypecifif-ation. The United States Steel
Ftooks did not share fully In the day's strength,
althnuch they were liruRht on a large ecale.
The conference of members of the Senate Fi

to assumptions rejrardinj? the scope of plans for
flnsnrial legislation, which "were uÂ«">d with ef

CHICAGO. Aup. 13.â There was a big trade
In wheat throughout the entire session to-day

the final figures being at about the best prices
of the day. The opening was firm on strong
European cables and a continued light move
ment. September being %c to %@V4c higher
at W)%Â©80Kc to 80%c. During the early part
of the session liquidation on all advances was
In order, although the sentiment in general was
bullish. Â«nd this selling had a tendency to
check the upward trend of prices. After sell
ing off to 80 He September began to advance
gradually, and toward the latter part of the
neÂ«iion the market turned extremely strong on
good advances In the Northwest markets due
to an advance in the price of flour in Minne
apolis. Coupled with the stronger outside mar
ket* was a better export demand at the sea
board, both of which Influences started shorts
covering, resulting in a strong close. After
selling up to 82c September closed l%Â«l*4o

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1903.
scattered demand due to higher cables and to
the bull sentiment of yesterday, but the weather
In the West was reported more - favorable â¢ for
the growing crop, and the early. firmness, was
soon dissipated by selling by several commis
sion houses. â¢September closed a shade higher;
Oats moved In sympathy with the leading
grains, although the market had some Inde
pendent firmness based on reports of disap
pointment In 1 threshing returns and light re
ceipts. â¢ The .close was firm, September being
up V 4 @%c at 33%Â®33%c. Â¦
Provisions held fairly steady. In spite of a
dull trade and liberal receipts of hogs, with a
decline of 6@10c In prices at the yards. Pack
ers sold pork and there was some loss shown
in that product. The poor demand for cash and
increasing stocks of lard, according to private
estimates, was a bear factor. September pork
closed 2%c lower. Lard was higher and ribs
were up 2^4c. , 'Â¦ ,,

Oakey is an Englishman, who has not
been dealt kindly with Vy fortune. He
graduated from Oxford when a young
mn; with hljrh honors, and at his ma
jority came into a princely fortune. His
income at that time was $300,000 a year.
Through bad investments his fortune
gradually dwindled away until the climax
camÂ© with the Barinsr Bros, failure in
ISS3. Oakey lost a little more than $2,
000,000 in this failure and woko up one
morning to find himself penniless.
SEEN T.AST IN JULY.
Oakey has been a famllqiar figure on
the streets of San Francisco for several
years. He Js of middle age and always
wore a black suit and silk hat. Through
the loss of an eye he wore a black patch.
He is considered one of the cleverest
architects in this city. He has been
employed by Reid Bros, for many years,
but without any warning or without giv
ing any intimation he left the efflce and
has not returned since. .
The nany friends of A. F. Oakey, a
well-known architect of this city, are con
siderably worried at Ms mysterious dis
appearance and are wondering Jf he has
met with foul play. He has not been seen
since July 14, and his trunk and personal
effects, including many letters, are lying
uncalled for at the Luxembourg, a room
ing-house at 113 Stockton street-
The signature and the two last lines are
in pencil and Mr. Banning informed the
Commissioner that the writing was sim
ilar to that in the letter which formed
the basis of the complaint. Dr. Brink ad
mittqd that he wrote the letter to Ellis
just quoted and that he placed the "M.
D." after his name,' In-, contradiction of
his testimony already given on that mat
ter. Dr. Fearn swore that Brirrk's signa
ture to the affidavit was a forgery.
Commissioner Hunt held Dr. Brink to
answer before the Federal Grand Jury
and released the prisoner on furnishing a
bond of $1500. Both Dr. Nott and the ac
cused have many friends among the medi
cal fraternity in that part of the country
and the affair>has caused a. great sensa
tion.
The preliminary examination was held
last Tuesday, at Kelseyville before acting
United States Commissioner E. Hunt.
The Government was represented by
First Assistant United States District At
torney E. J. Banning.
The evidence showed that Dr. Brink
had procured an affidavit of W. R. Ellis
of Salinas City, who made the accusation
against Dr. Nott. Ellis testified that Dr.
Brink had told him that Nott was trying
to get the appointment as County Phy
sician, in Lake County, which position
was held by Brink, and that Brink want
ed to use the affidavit for the purpose of
defeating' Dr. Nott. The Ellis affidavit
was typewritten on note paper and sent
to Dr. McGovern and others through the
postofflce. Appended to the typewritten
cÂ»py of the affidavit was a note in pencil
commenting upon the affidavit and signed
"H. O. Brink. M. D."-
Dr. Brink denied that he had mailed
the letter to Dr. McGovern and also swore
that the signature was a ' forgery. He
added that he never signed "M. D." after
his name, "because everybody knew that
he was a doctor."
Then Mr. Banning introduced the fol
lowing typewritten letter in evidence:
Office of County Physician. Lake -County,
California. H. O. Brink, M. D.. County
Physician. -
Lakeport, Ca!., Dec 5 1902. â Mr. W. R.
Kills. Salinas City. Monterey Co.. Cal. â Dear
Sir: You no doubt remember the affidavit that
you gave to me on the 23rd day of last Oc
tober. Well. I brought it up here and about
the ' first men that saw it was a free mason,
and he begged of me not to show it to any
ona excepting a free mason, for at least a
while. Well. I did as he requested of me.
So, in the meantime, the Masons have written
down to Salinas, at the instigation of Nott.
and the Masons down there have sent word
to ' the Masons up here, that you are desolute,
unreliable and dependent old man. and so
much addicted to llcuor that your word or
oath is not worth the paper it is written on.
At least this is the information that I get in
the matter. And it is so much like the doings
of Nott â¢ that I think It is about what he is
trying to make out that you are a desolute
immoral man who is seeking an oppertunity
to injure a man of his standing by a lie you
may swear to. . ,
It would be a good thing for you to do. I
believe, to take the paper -which I have en
closed, or another of t v Â«< same kind that may
be tetter, and go to some of the best, men in
Salinas and have them sign It. and then send
it to me and I will show it to these masons
up here who are led to believe that you are
no good. Yours respectfully.

The people of Lake Countyare discuss
ing a scandal which has agitated the best
society in the Alps of America and which
has brought unpleasantly into prominence
the names of County Physician H. O.
Brink and Dr. J. R. Nott, who is physi
cian for Highland Springs and several
other fashionable summer resorts In that
vicinity. A short time ago Dr. Nott pro
cured the arrest of Dr. Brink on the seri
ous, charge of having mailed to Dr. P. F.
McGovern a letter accusing Dr. Nott of a
shameful crime. Dr. McGovern, being a
friend of the party accused, handed the
letter to Dr.'Nott. ,'
The trial will proceed at 9 o'clock this
morning, when Attorney Shortridge will
address the jury for the defense. It Is
expected that the case will go to the Jury,
in the afternoon.
After all the testimony was introduced
D. C. West, one of the attorneys for the
defense, moved the dismissal of the
charges against Dillard on the ground
that none of the documents introduced
by the prosecution purported to be a du
plicate- certificate of residence under the
act. He contended that the date of their
original issue ran back to the term of
Collector Wellburn and that the reissue
should^not bear the name of Lynch but
Wellburn and be simply certified to as be
ing a correct copy by Lynch. The mo
tion was denied.
At the opening of the court Samuel
Shortridge, defendant's attorney, ' an
nounced that his case was closed and the
prosecution recalled in rebuttal several
employes of the Collectors' office to tes
tify to the fact that when Dillard ' was
making out duplicate certificates of resi
dence he always had the book of originals
open on his desk before him.
Collector Lynch was on the stand
again for a few minutes, being ques
tioned by Shortridge regarding his signa
ture and affidavit of correctness upon a
number of reports that were proved to be
false. The Collector explained that.it was
impossible to verify the correctness of the
reports in his office, as there were so
many of them.
"Then your signature and your oath on
these documents, which are records of
your office," asked Shortridge, "do not
lend them any dignity or Insure their cor
rectness?"
The Collector was forced to admit that
they did not.
Along these lines McKinley continued
through the many counts in the indict
ment, denouncing the defendant as a de
liberate falsifier and an ingrate. He. Bald
that if the jury should determine that
Dillard was innocent of forging these du
plicate'^certincates then the only conclu
sion that remained was that Collector
Lynch was himself guilty of fraud and
falsehood, which was af altogether in
supportable theory.
During McKinley's address the defend
ant wore a somewhat worried look, which
is the only time during the trial that he
has seemed to betray much anxiety. His
wife sat beside him and shared his anx
ious appearance.
McKinley showed that Dillard did not
get his facts in regard to the description
from the application, as the defendant
had testified was his custom, as. the age,
height and distinguishing marks were at
variance with the written application pre
sented by Mowry. The description,
however, tallied with that given in the
original certificate, from which the prose
cution drew the inference that Dillard
must have had the original before him at
the time he drew the duplicate and hence
could not avoid noticing the disparity in
the photographs.
McKinley laid particular stress upon
the most damaging evidence against
Dillard, the duplicate certificate is-
Bued to Luey Den upon the appli
cation submitted by Attorney Howry.
To-this certificate the signature of Col
lector John C. Lynch is alleged to have
been forged and the photograph attached
to it is evidently/not that of the man to
whom the original certificate was issued.
For two hours and a half yesterday As
sistant United States District Attorney
Benjamin McKinley thundered denuncia
tions to the Jury against William H. Dil
lard, now on trial on the charge of issu
ing forged certificates of residence to Chi
nese who were not entitled to them. He
endeavored to wind tightly about the de
fendant the coils of evidence produced
during the long trial and succeeded in
making a forcible and convincing argu
ment.

.CU'TLlERJr*
This treatment at once stops falling
heir, removes crusts, scales and dan-
draff, destroys hair parasites, soothes
Irritated, itching surfaces, stimulates
the hair follicles, loosens the scalp skin,
supplies the roots with energy and
nourishment, and makes the hair grow
upon a sweet, wholesome, healthy scalp
when all else fails.
Millions of women now rely on Cutl-
enra Soap assisted by Caticnra Oint-
ment, the great skin cure, for preserving,
pnrifjlng and beautifying the skin, for
cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales and
dandruff, and the stopping of falling
hair, for softening, whitening and
soothing red, rough and sore hands, for
baby rashes, itchings and chafings, for
annoying irritations, or too free or
offensive per.* {ration, for ulcerative
weaknesses, and many sanative, anti-
septic purposes which readily suggest
themselves, as well as for all the pur-
poses of the toilet and nursery.
Cuticura remedies are the standard
skin cures and humour remedies of the
world. Bathe the affected parts with hot
water and Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the
surface of crusts and scales and soften
the thickened cuticle. Dry, without
hard rabbing, and apply Cutlcnra Oint-
ment freely, to allay Itching, Irritation
and inflammation, and soothe and heal,
and, lastly, in the severer forms, take
Caticura Resolvent, to cool and cleanse
the blood. A single set is often suffi-
cient to cure the most torturing, dis-
figuring skin, 6calp and blood humours,
from pimples to ecrof ula, from Infancy
to age, when all else falls.
