THB OTHER BIDS OF THE PAPER.
Through the : shadows of ; evening, and
where pale blue mist- wreaths twined Uka

woods, Roy Meldrum '. and ' his cousin
passed ' rapidly. J- The elder* s last glimpse
of his' father's home showed its dart mass

Conversation quickened -over their
cigars In a first-class smoking compart
' ment,' of which Â¦ they, were the sole occu
pants, and Roy's gloomy . reflections were
assailed and scattered before thoughts of
- the future ; in connection . with the curious
discovery of that afternoon. -
"By, the way," he said, "as wÂ» are! to

Then, - offering : and ; ;war
breaking out between two neighboring
tribes, I made my escape and endeavored
to; get back, south. But chance led my
steps astray and I avoided one danger
to fall In with others.
"The man Pomba of , the tribe of the
Batoncas ' I found sore wounded by the
wayside and was moved to play tho good
Samaritan. Never did human being save
a nobler and worthier life. Now on tho
eve of my last "attempt to return whence
I came It Is Pomba's right arm, his
strength and his skill I trust to. But even
he will have his powers taxed to. the ut
most, for this cursed country Is in up
roar, his own people, friendly until now,
have grown cold against me, and it may
go hard with us at any moment There
fore I write this much in hope that If I,
die, my treasure^ may not lie bidden, here
forever. :
"To be brief, after falling lnvwlth Pom

marked the turning-point In my fortunes.

"You mean brains. Well. I know my
upper story is a bit light, but the few
things I have managed to cram into It
are just the sort to be useful on a Job

brains for us both. Better change your
mind and come. You can only live your
life once, as I said before. Why not en-
Joy It?"
"As to enjoying It. old man, I can't
say a trip of this sort would give me the
least enjoyment in itself. But I should
like to make a fortune and you wouldn't
believe me. if I said I didn't".
"Well, let It -be., a bargain.' We may
do something that will wake the world
up. Who knows?".
"I can't dash at ' It in this hot-blooded

It's certainly 100 to 1 against usâ perhaps
more. Let me review the position from
these scanty beginnings and" you'll sea
I'm light First here's a poor beggar,
name unknown, who has on his own con
fession been' residing with the niggers In
the bush for years. He gets away from
the 'Matabele at last and discovers a na
tive,-called Pomba, at death'* door.- They
become, tremendous chums and keep go
ins together until the white man strikes
it rich and apparently finds himself kick-
Ing diamonds about in the heart of Afri
ca. We are to understand that he and his
trusty Man Friday buried the bulk-' of
their treasure near a place called Golden
Falls, then got knocked on the head for
their pains; and we don't know to within
1000 miles or so where all this happened.
"Yes, we do. The directions are explicit
as can <be. The river Is named and the
tribe of niggers that he. thought he was
frienc'y withâ the Batoncas. * Who killed
him we can't t& but seeing his message
was taken off a Batonca' s neck. 'It Isa't
hard to guess."
"It may seem clear enough on .paper.

stranger In a' strange land,, with nothing
but sun and stars to tell you your way
and a thousand dangers and enemies hid
ing on . both - hands. Think' twice. Roy.

drew his armchair to the table and again
produced the manuscript He looked
round him half as though he expected to
see' another person, then spread the pa- Â¦
per.- turned It over and examined to*
back of it
, On the reverse of the sheet, ta eallgra
phy even more minute than that he had
already recited to Roy Meldrum, was one
line of forty words.. This he had caught
a glimpse cf when first he opened tha
manuscript but after reading the mala
document, "from some Impulse he had not
repeated the single line to his cousin. Tha
words ran along the bottom of the paper,
and now. taken' in connection with the
dead man's - other statement, they pos
sessed peculiar significance.
For a moment Tracy was In doubt
whether they had in reality any reference
to the main body. of the document; then
he decided that they must have.
Thus ran the strange direction:
"Stand where the peaks of the Antelope
Head Bluff are in one line. Then .wait till
the hour when the rainbow 'shines upon
the mist of the falls, and where the pur
ple of the arch touches the forestâthere
in white ants*" nest".
Tracy, Fain wrinkled his brow over this)
enigmatic direction, then read and reread
the unfinished record on the other side.
Soon he defined his position with tha
added knowledge contributed by this sin
gle* line. It amounted to an exact direc
tion as to the position of the treasure.
Somewhere about the limit of British ter
ritory in the direction of Lake Tangan
yika, or in the extreme south of the Con
go State, a dead Englishman had made
a marvelous find of precious stones. Tha
approximate position of his discovery ha
had survived Ions enough to define pretty
closely, and It ' occurred on tha river
"Well, exactly. And I shall live. I'm
not built to flicker out at a breath of
swamp air."
"If abnormal biceps could do it, the
diamonds would be yours all right no
doubt But more than biceps go to suc
cess in Central Africa."
"Just like a Meldrum." said Fata. -Al
ways up in' the clouds, always oversan
gulne and overbold."
"My father would have seen this thing
through as a young man. so Z shall. It
must be a grand experience any way and
experience is always useful."
"If you live to aval] yourself, of It"
"Impossible to say that. I'm Jolly san
guine myself. Take my advice and see

"They are equally valueless. I fear."

Roy Meldrum's position was rather a
trying one, despite his light tone and as
sumed contempt for his fate. His father

but had filed poor, cave in honors, and

affairs were sadly involved, and that the
cpm-handed end too liberal manner of
life pursued by the old soldier had left
his only son much poorer *hÂ«p he ex
pected to find himself.
A week before this etory begins young
Jilcldrum had been present at the sale
cf tilings he formerly regarded as pre
cious heirlooms â trophies cf the chase,
rare curies from India and China, from
the South Seas and Central Africaâ but
now all had vanished under the auc
tioneer's hammer; and Roy walked for
the last time through the home of his
ycutli, end fcnew that in all htznan prob
ability his feet would never tread the
shining ccien f.oors of Tamlin Hall again.
. He wandered through the empty place,
paused at each wide window to see some
veil-remembered view for the last time,
puffed his p!pe. and returned but brief
est possible replies to the questions and
expressions of sympathy which proceeded
from his companion.
Beth men were above average height,
but while Tracy Fain was dark and wiry
and only ecaled eleven etcne for all his
eix feet, the other man had a form of
which any Viking rr.Igh t have been proud.
Hoy Meidrum etcod six feet four In his
. cocks e.nd was built en massive lines.

ed In his tremendous limbs and he had
htld for two years the heavy-weight
wrestling championship of the German
.gymnasium, but this was his Bole claim
j, to athletic eminence, 'for though tried in
the pack cf the Cambridge Rugby team,
be had been found too eiow to repre
sent his varsity.
t; In face Hoy Meldrum was that type
whereon Anglo-Saron is stamped and can
fce read the wide world over. His voice
came from his tremendous chest; he look
ed all men In the face, was a clean liver
ar.r: a man of Eimple old fashioned prin
ciples. Now, at 20, and after imagining
fcr years that a very large income would
revert to him upon his father's death, he
was suddenly faced with widely different
future prospects.
He stood at this moment rich In mas
culine friends cf bis own age, poor in
i those who could furnish hinrwith wisdom.
Both his parents bad now passed away
and cf near relations he had few left and
rone could do him service. Indeed, Roy
MelCrum eeemed likely to represent the
last cf his line and upon his marrying and
adding another generation to the ancient
race depended its chance of enduring be
yond the limits of his own career.
Marriage, however, was the last thing
In his thoughts. He found himself now
heart-whole, hale and energetic, with all
â¢ the world before him to choose from and
. a total capital of some Â£10,000, where he
* htd once supposed his income would be
little short of that turn.
â¢ "Ten thousand!" said Tracy Fain. "Do
you mean to say that your hopes and ex
pectations have dwindled down to that.
i, cousin? "What in the name of fortune
<i:d Â£lr Rupert do with his money?"
"Good," answered Meldrum stoutly.
"Nothing but good from morning till
night. Never lived a more charitable and
generous man. His hand was always in
his pocket and those who gained his ben
efits were the sort who could pay no ben
efit back again, the men who came to our
place were those who seldom got asked
anywhere else, and so with everything
and everybody.- He had. half a regiment
cf old soldiers on the estate, and, of
course, not one in a dozen was earning
his salt. Poor old dad! He didn't know
how he had sent the money spinning.
Why, he died under the Impression he^
was leaving me quite a tidy fortune."
"And you're built of the same stuff as
he was, worst luck."
"Don't say that. I'm proud to think Â£ve
cot a n:s"re like his; but I'm not worthy
to be mentioned in the same breath with
him. He was a father in ten thousand."
Roy reloaded his pipe and looked out over
Ithe rolling hills of Kent Autumn already
mellowed the woodlands and powdered
the great tracts and glades of bracken
fern with gold. Ills cousin regarded him
with a kindly though slightly contemptu
ous g!ance.
Tracy Fain had a shrewder Intellect
than Roy, and his dark eyes shot forth a
keener intelligence than the frank blue
ones of the big man; bat life had yet CO
ehow where his heart was and prove the
young fellow's nature. He was a three
years' Junior, to Meldrum, but they had
Â»Â«cen much of one another In early life,
-fitnd to-day Fain, from mingled emotions,
perhaps not wholly devoid of sentiment,
had come down for the day from London
1 to Tunbrldge and had driven out with his
cousin to take a last look at Tamlin HalL
It represented half the sum total of the
past happiness cf both men; as boys they
But the talisman,- or whatever it might
be, paled its ' Interest v before the paper
that contained It Â» Fain occupied himself
with . this and epread It out carefully,
while Meldrum studied the disc. A loud
"One moment I've rot a rum feeling
about this. Will you go further arid say
'share and share alike, whatever It con
tains T*
"Good or bad?" '
"Yes." BUS
"Well, you're a rum chap! If you
don't believe in Providence you evidently
believe In something."'
"I believe in . my own presentiments."
Meldrum did not answer, but a moment
later had cut into the mysterious packet,
torn off the lion's hide covering, and're
vealed the contents. First ; came a piece
of coarse paper neatly and tightly. folded
into the necessary shape, 'and. within It
appeared a Cat, thin, irregularly,? shaped
disc of gold, upon which was set a ; curi
ous Ink-black figure. -
Fain put out his hand and arrested the
other's knife which was about to cut open
the fetich.
"Yes, I have, for all your sneers,"
said Roy, stoutly. "But even I > don't
expect to find evidences of Providence
hidden away In a Batonca warrior's
necklace. However, here goes. If it's a
diamond we'll - share and share alike.
I should never have seen the thtwy hang
ing up there but for you."
"Open It by all means. . Here we stand
on the threshold of grand mystery Â¦ for
all we can say. Your life lies before
you and you have no inclination one
way or another. The contents of this
charm may decide you. Why not?
Stranger things have happened. '- Be
sides, you have such a solid trust In
Providence."
"Just what It is." answered his cousin.
"Governor got that and a big oxhide
ehleld and a sheaf of assegais when
young Tarrant of the Cape mounted po
lice came back from South Africa. He
was on a holiday right up in Central
Africa, near the Batonca country, you re
member. A horde of black men were
kept at bay all through a long pitch
black night by a hunting party of ten
Englishmen and a parson, who loaded the
guns, but wouldn't shoot. I mean tha
parson wouldn't. They came off without
any losses, though several were wounded.
And the good old parson said It was
frightful to tee about 200 black men on
their backs when the sun rose, because of
the fact that there would be 200 less
Christians go to glory.
"That amulet there came off a dead
man's neck. A big man, too. He was
called M'wenga, and afterward when tha
blacks caved in and made peace, they dug
up the chap and took him back to his
kraal up the country and burled him in
style. .And they made a rare row when
the fetich couldn't be found. They, said
the new chief wanted It.
"Young Tarrant had all the dead war
rior's spears and his headdress and
everything, and as for that little packet,
no doubt it hung around the baggar*s
neck to protect him against trouble. But
the charm didn't work against a rifle bul
let, somehow."
"What's In the thing. I wonder?" mused;
Tracy Fain, regarding the object with
Blight interest.
"A drled-up toad, or a few berries from
a medicine man's tree, or a lion's tooth, or
come such rubbish. Tarrant said lots of
the slau^itered Batoncas had charms and
all those the fellows opened were full of
such things. But one amulet had a Jolly
good diamond in itâ only In the rough, yet
there it was, and a man from the Trans
vaal gave a hundred quid for it. After
that, Tarrant said, there were not many
charms or fetiches left unopened."
"Perhaps this thing has a treasure In
it, too."
"I hardly like to open Itr-yet we may
us well."
Tracy laughed.
"What Is It?" he asked.
Roy took the thlnr in hand, blew the
dust off it and then cleaned it with his
pocket handkerchief. The curio was a
small, hard packet three inches long,
two broad and about one Inch deep. It
was covered in a piece of cand-colored
lion-hide and tightly sewn with fiber. It
depended from a circular string of small
black seeds In shape of a necklace.
"It looks like some mumbo- Jumbo fool
ery of niggers," surmised Fain.
"By Jove! They thought It was a ven
tilator, I'll bet. But I know what It is.*
"How are we going to get it?"
"I'll lift you on to the mantelpiece,
Tracy. I'd climb on to it myself, but
It's not guaranteed to car^y 14 gtone."
"All right. Steady! Great Scott! I
feel like an infant in arms."
The simile made Roy laugh till the oak
celling echoed: but meantime he had
picked up his cousin with consummate
ease and lifted him to a broad stone
mantelshelf four feet from the ground.
The little oblect on the wall was now
well within Faln's reach. A moment
later he had dislodged it and Jumped
back to the floor.
"That* Â¦ the room my mother died to,"
eald Roy a* they stopped for & moment
In a small apartment flooded with western
light "It was her boudoir, and the goy
trnor had It shut up after her death.
Then, two days before he went himself,
ha instated on having: It opened ajrain and
Â¦would occupy the couch mother passed
away upon, There he died, too, and If
ever a man saw .thing* hidden from his
watchers he did at the end. He ipokt
and stretched out his arms and greeted
her, as though she had come to welcome
him from the other side of the dark val
ley. And I think he knew that she was
going to do so and expected her."
"I know you believe all that sort of
thing, old chap," said Fain, Quietly. "Long
may you continue to do so. If you ret any
solid satisfaction out of It. I *nvy the
man with faith. It mnit be very comfort
ing In this weary world. Now, let* s go
and look at the smoking-room, the gen
eral's sanctum sanctorum. There X
einoked my first dearâ stolen when Uncle
Hupert had his back turned."
"It looks naked and awfully wretched
now. Everything's rone, of courseâ the
pictures, the trophies, the old swords,
the helmet I put on that day to frighten
your Bisters and couldn't get off again
all vanished. And for such ghastly low
prices. I could have smashed some of
the brutes haggling over sixpences at
the sale last week, only that wouldn't
have done any practical good, of course."
"Probably not-except make an addi
tional hole in your last few thousand
pounds. This was the room. How dif
ferent now!"
They entered a handsome apartment
with dark oak ceiling and carved panel-
Ing reaching to the height of a man's
shoulder. Upon wallpaper which cov
ered the room above the lofty wainscot
appeared strange Impressions, where the
various trcDhies that had hung there
aforetime had left the paper clean be
hind them.
"What's that above the mantelpiece?"
asked Fain. "They've forgotten some
thing." '
He pointed to a small square object
hanging high on the walL

earliest recollections were stirred as they
paced the chambers sow echoing and
empty.

Before breakfast had ended everybody
felt by a sort of Intuition that tbe most
Interesting man at the table was Captain"
Ogilvie himself. His niece, Elizabeth,
who was taking a voyage of pleasurs
with her uncle, resembled him in some
respects and he had her gray eyes and
dark hair; but the expression of h's face
was widely different and it puzzed all
strangers by a certain sense of peculiarity
which those who gazed upon h!m felt in
stantly/but were powerless to define.
Itr. Macabe. the first engineer, sus
pected- he must, be a mesmerist, and
Btcutly held to that opinion; others ad
vanced more plausible theories; In reality
a very definite reason existed for the cap
tain's singular expression and strangely
varied moods; but only a medical man
would have known it. .
Alister Ogilvie had a; wide reputation
as shipmaster and navigator, for a man
whose years numbered no more than five
and forty. He stuck to the sailing ships
for choice through many years, but had
now been in "steam" since he was 40 and
appeared quite content to stop on a ship
he liked, possessing neither wife nor chll-'
dren to make him ambitious. Â¦ 'Â¦*
:Â¦'Â¦ He . had commanded the Morning Star
for five years, and he gloried in his ship,
for she could saJKupon occasion as well
as, steam. He was popular both with the
owners and crew; but of, late there were
rumors that Captain Ogilvie had changed.
and his old boatswain, Dan Hook, a man
who deemed , himself as muchj a part of
the; Morning Star as her spanker boom,
growled sometimes in secret at harsh
words undeserved arid advanced | all man
ner of theories to account: for a gradual
change in the skipper's character..
Off | the Isle of Wight a little private
steam yacht, all aglow with cream-colored
funnel,? shining v spars ; and bright? brass
work, came tumbling alongside the Morn
ing Star and a thin, red-bearded man in a
fluttering gray ulster hailed, the vessel
through a ; speaking trumpet. ".: \ . . â¢

preserved a silence and mystery most

LOVE.
Long before . the Morning Star had
left the Red Sea, the Justice of Lord
Winstone's fears concerning Captain
Ogilvie wu too surely proved.
- On a fine morning, when the men were
watching a pilgrim, ship conveying do- "
rout Moslems to Jiddah for Mecca, the
skipper's cabin boy came rushing on
deck with the sensational announcement
that Captain Ogilvie was dead.
Roy Meldrum, Mr. Messenger, the mis
sionary and Lord Winstone Instantly
hastened to the cabin to find MIm
Ogllvlo in the extremity of grief and hey
uncle lying open-eyed but quite uncon
scious upon his bunk. He had been in
visible for two. days and Meldrum. aa
well as the clergyman, was shocked to
see the change* In him, but Winstona
showed no alarm. He examined the tick
man's eyes, then sent an order along t9
the galley for strong coffee. HÂ« had al
ready convinced himself of the facts, and.
unnoticed by anybody but Meldrum, had.
picked up from the ground near the cap
tain's bunk a little nickel-plated syrinx*
âthe instrument with which the unfortu
nate man had administered the poison.
Clearing the cabin of all but Miss Ogtl
vie and bidding Meldrum exert hi*
strength on the prostrate figure. Lord
Winstone shook the captain into some
semblance of life, roared and shouted at
his ear and then kept him tottering up
and down on his legs until the coffee
came. Two hours later the danger was
passed and the captain sitting quietly on
deck with his niece.
Elsewhere Lord Wlnstone had a private
chat with Meldrum and Tracy Fain.
"This is the thing he has been squirt
ing death and damnation Into himself
with," he said, showing the little syringe.
"I've suspected It for some time, as Roy
la aware; but to-day Ogilvle's face told
me all I wanted to know without any
thing further. Did you see his eyes? The
pupils had practically vanished altogeth
er. He's had a big debauch, evidently,
and he'd have been a dead man to-day
but for our timely intervention.?
"He must be accustomed to heavy
doses," said Fain.
"Exactly. Now, the question is. what's
our duty? Shall I give this back when
he asks for it, or not? Personally. I in
cline to keep it. out of regard for the
safety of the ship and Its passengers."
"It might kill the man altogether to go
without now," suggested Meldrum.
"No, that's a fallacy. He v.ouitl have a
very bad time ar.d endure a lot of ghsstly
misery, no doubt, while his- r.crvea ciam
ored for the poison; but he'd get over ft,
and be tbe first to thank me afterward.
He may have another syringe, but if he
.hasn't we shall soon know, because this
form of opium Is of little* use. I fancy,
without the hypodermic needle to put it
Into him. Very well. then. I'll keep "
He did not finish the sentence, for sud
denly a long arm and a thin, hairy hand
shot between Fain and the speaker, and
before the startled man could close hi*
fingers upon the syringe it waÂ« gone.
Ogilvte, untieen and uhhrard, had comÂ»
up behind the group, and his eye had
noticed the deadly weapon in Lord Win
stone's outstretched hand. At sight of it
the man's face became violently agitated.
His teeth clenched, his forehead grew
wrinkled. He divined in a flash the cours*
of events and knew what had led to the
present situation; but he did not hesitate
a moment. With one action he drew doe*
and the next moment had stretched out
his arm and snatched hlg property. "*
"Mine. I think, my Lord!"
Not another wcrd he said. Only h!s eye*
Cashed at the startled company as he
turned on his heel and went in the direc
tion of his cabin.
But Wlnstone was not done with. Â»"4
now he hurried after the departing- flgur*
and entered without any formality.
"Listen, Captain Ogilvie; listen. I beÂ«
and pray, of you. I saved your Ufa this
morning; the least you can do is to hear
me now."
"A pity you meddled," said tho other
shortly. "My life's my' own, and IX I
chose toâ"
"Hush, hush, for God'* take! You a
man. and dared to think of that! To what
depths has this cursed drug reduced you!
I Implore you to consider, sir, the gravity
of your position. Who is therÂ» upon this
ship that can adequately take your placa

mate, you know as well aa I do whether
the man's to be relied upon to handle a
big. heavy ship with weak engines, on ft
dangerous coast, even if he can at sea,
It was not only suicldÂ© you contemplated,
but murderâ wholesale murder for all you
know to the contrary." Â¦-
This attempt to frighten Ogilvie failed.
"You. at least, are not the man to fear
me," he said, "and if you think I fear
you. you are mistaken. Lord or not,
you've* no right to tell me my duty to
myself or my ship, or to God or to tho
devil. I'll do what I please and as I
please. Opium is the only thing that*
inakes my life worth living- It's my slave,
not my master. Who dares say that I let
it stand between me and duty? By God.
'the man who says it Is a mutineer, and
I'll treat him Ilka one." .
"You've changed your ground now al
together; but I'm not here to argue with
you. You're soaked with the poison still,
and no more able to reason at present
than a man in drink. You're risht. at
least, when you say 1 don't fear you: but
you've more than fifty soul3ln your care

realizing" that at present, all words'/were
vain, withdrew. He walked pensively,
litfe some lonely stork or heron, up and
down the deck; he scratched his great
red beard awhile and then shook bis head]
Â¦and retired, baffled and uneasy, to his
cabin.
But the unfortunate victim appeared to
realizs the truth of his passenger's re
buke. Indeed, within a week he had
spoken to Lord Winstone again, ex
pressed profound regret for the past, and
made a solemn assurance that he was
fighting the poison and lessening tha
doses.
As for hia, accuser, he knew too well
what a morphia maniac's promises are
worth; but it was beyond his power to
do anything practical: and he therefore
contented himself with hopes that the
captain spoke the truth, and was hor,est-i
ly endeavoring to cure himself. {

CHAPTER IV.
WambasI, a tributary of that gigantic
Ftr< am the Luapula, which flows between
Lake Mweru and Lake Bangweolo, In Lo-
Lira. Â«Â£ tf
Upon this tributary existed the territory
of the Biitoncas, and at tome point out
pidc the central Etronghold of that people
it was clear that the dead man had dwelt
for a time In harmony with them. Then
danger threatened, the tribesmen changed
their attitude toward him, and he pre
pared to escape, but left action until too
late. :K â¢
It was clear that he had been elain on
the day of flightâ in all probability by his
treacherous friends. The missive thai oc
cupied him in the very moment of death
had evidently represented high fetish to
his murderer, and became an amulet of
power accordingly: but it was certain
that the savage responsible for the mur
der could not read what the dead pros
pector had written; therefore, in all hu
man probability, the diamonds etiU lay
within the "stony seed-pods" of the
manuscript.
This much Roy Meldrum knew as well
as his cousin; but the additional light of
the single line was possessed by Fain
alone. It Indicated that at some point in
the Batoncas' land there rose, near or ac
tually upon the river WambasI, an em
inence known as Antelope Head bluff,
probably on account of its resemblance to
a beast familiar In that region. From
cone point of eight the horns of this
â¢tone animal might be observed in line,
one hlfllng the other; and, at a certain
elevation of the sun. tho natural phenom
enon of a rainbow on the mist thrown
up by a waterfall was also to be seen.
And where the purple ring of that rain
bow fell upon the shore amid forest trees
âthere thould be found a white ants'
nest.
That was all the dead man's directions,
but Tracy Fain could read the rest with
out words. In the ants' nest were the
pods of the tree, and in the podÂ» the
diamonds.
He sat and thought until Big Ben sol
emnly thundered 2 o'clock. Then, with the
tame sidelong glance as before, he took
out his knife and neatly cut away, half
an inch long, the bottom of the manu
script. This mutilation left the main
statement and the great rusty drop of
blood untouched. Indeed, the face of the
paper was unchanged; but now the line
cf explanation had vanished from the
back of it, and soon occupied a secret'
place in Fain's pocket book. Then he
drank a stiff glass of whisky and soda,
knocked out his pipe and retired for the
'"L'ntll this little discovery of mine our
expedition was madness." he said to him
self as he flung himself upon hia bed;
"but now, in the light of such a revela
tion, the thing comes more within the
range of practical politics. Yes, I sliall
delight old Roy to-morrow. I feel sure I
shall. His great, silly blue eyes will
twinkle when I tell him that I'm coming,
too. and he'll shout 'hurrah!' and grip me
by the hand till my finger bones ache.
And as to the diamondsâ why, we Bhall
see. Cf course I may tell him all about
this later onâ and again. I may not. In
this rotten world it's everybody for hlm
belf mid the devil take tbe hindmost."
With which reflection Tracy Fain re
ts<Â£ued himself to sleep. Yet the ideas of
the day pursued hlsi, and he moved and
growled in weird dream-scenery of tropic
trees laced with giant creepers, and full
of .chattering apes. The narcotic scent of
huge blossoms made him feel faint and,
eg re plucked them from the bough,
blocA JJkts a man's, burst from the broken
stems and trickled over his fingers, and
t*Ined and twisted end turned into little
live ccral snakes with diamond eyes.
He ehook them from him, for their bite
was death, and they fell wriggling into
night and silence. Then, through unut
terable darkness, sounded the monoto
nous, eons-like roaring of great beasts
and flashed fireflies and fell heavy tropic
rainstorms.
But the morning Â«of his t-ream dawned
m last, and the sun rose and brightened
t.vÂ».ry polished stem and 6hinir.g leaf of
the tropic wilderness. Then he looked at
the sun. to bless it for returning, and
labbed his eyes and looked again; for in
st< ad of the old sun there had risen into
i he sky the golden disc from the dead
Latonca's watch; and en its face shune

hit. own selfish aims and amusements and
interests he had heiixtily dedicated his
It happened, however, that he was a
very j>oor man and had been obliged to
vurK for hia living 6ince he left echool.
His life In the city redounded but little to
his credit. Originally on the Stock Ex
change and independent, he had overshot
the lr.ark, come to grief, and been "ham
mered" under circumstances that those
who knew the truth were bound to re
gard as highly discreditable.
Â¦ But it was Just the truth that the young
man hid from his relatives. His piteous
story of undeserved misfortune had com
pletely deceived Roy Meldrum (who
begged to be allowed to go into the city
to "punch" respectable men of business
on a grand scale whexfihe heard of his
cousin's misfortune), and it had also de
luded his uncle. Sir Rupert.
Through tae exertions of that kind
friend Tracy Fain indeed obtained his
present employment; and now, as senior
clerk in a small shipping firm, he pros
pered beyond his deserts and hoped some
day to be taken into partnership. As a
preliminary step to that end some six
months before the beginning of thi^ nar
rative he had offered marriage to the only
daughter of the head of the firm; but she,
though plain enough to shake the pluck
of even penniless men, was shrewd as
well, and had astounded Tracy by curtly
refusing htm without conditions.
Lastly, it need only be said that Roy
Meldrum was wholly Ignorant of his
cousin's real character, but recognized his
Â¦ undoubted ability, although he could not
see through his superficial charm of man
ccr and simulated generosity.
Roy swore by Tracy; and as for Fain.
he honestly felt regret of a sort for his
huge cousin, though the big man's medi
ocre Intellect, transparent elmpliclty and
natural trustfulness of disposition made
him eneer often enough In secret.
The cousins met on the following even
ing, and, as Tracy had foreseen, Roy
Meldrum greeted his change of purpose
with very hearty applause. Roy had come
armed with the latest and most expensive
map of South Africa to be bought in Lon
don, and upon it ihe men traced the tre
mendous Journey before them, marked
the sweep of the Luapula from one great
lake to another and speculated as to what
region upon the WambasI. where it vround
through the land of the Batoncas, the
capital and chief's kraal of that tribe was
most likely. to exist.
"A* to the journey." said Fain, "money
being an object and time not pressing,
I should suggest one course,' whereas had
time been precious and coin of no account
I might have proposed another. But it
doesn't matter to a month or two when
you start on our little trip, and the more
money you keep the mere likely ycu are'
to get through. So instead of going to the
cape in a Castle or Union liner 1 propose
a cargo boat. She'll be a bit longer, yet
not so much longer as you'd suppose if
you didn't know. Because there are
â¢tramps' that visit the. little two-penny
half-penny ports along the Mozambique
and the Zanzibar coast: and if we went
out to o&e of these small centers we
might start our expedition and work in-
chine on him so seldom now."
"Is he really ill? Has he any physical
pain to fight against? Some days he looks
such a nolendld fellow, and others he
seems shrunken and thin and starved."
"I can tell you no more than you have
seen for yourself. He won't take medi
cal advice. In fact he knows a good deal
of medicine and prefers to attend to him
self. The captain of. a sailing ship Is the
doctor, too. as a rule. So. he has had
plenty of rough experience in the past."
"Well. I wish I could cheer you up. It
may be something on your uncle's mind.
But if you have not got his confidence no
body on this ship can expect to get it,
that's very certain."
"I cannot say; I don't know if there Is
anything to know; but something lies
hidden, and sometimes I fear it is of the
mind, sometimes of the body. We must
be hopeful, yet it is hard to be." \
Fain approached at this moment and a
cloud crossed Roy's eyes.
"How tnat chap does find us out!" he
Â¦aid with a short laugh. "Well, two's
company; three none." I'll leave you and
be more sportsmanake than he was." .
"Don't. go. Why should you? Stop and
tell me about the diamond hunt. That
will interest Mr. Fain as much as It does
you."
Tracy now Joined them, and Meldrum
grew taciturn. Then he seemed suddenly
Impressed by an idea.
"I'll show you the fetich," he said. 'It's
a rum trinket, though it's got nothing to
do with the diamonds as far as we know."
Fain had little enough to say. albeit his
cousin's brief absence gave him an oppor
tunity. He stood with his back to the
bulwarks and his hands in his pockets:
but the girl in a deck chair with her eyes
upon the sea did not get a glance of the
dark, hungry face turned toward her.
Presently she looked up to speak, but
caught his eyes and said nothing, while a
blush brightened her cheek.
"This is a quiet- corner, and you get a
rplendid view of the shore Just at pres
ent," h* said carelessly.
"Yes, It is very perfectâ the shore and
the, sea, too; so is everything else of dear
Mother Nature's thaP men don't Interfere
with and spoil."
"Yet that splendid wall of foam, all
aglow with sunshine and iris colors,
â¢would not be there if "our bows did not
churn It up."
"I cannot argue with you, and I wouM
not have you think me a misanthrope, for
I am f;ir from that."
"God fnrbld! It would be hard if you
fc.ited 4 your fellow being-3, seeing that
they ail love you. Miss Ogilvie."
"That's not up to your usual pleasant
compliments, 3Hr. Fain; even clumsy for
you."
"The truth is apt to be clumsy. But
here comes my mammoth cousin."
Poy returned, exh't'te-1 the gold d!sk
Rnd told his story. The threa rat long to.
Tether, and it was not until a big bell beat
the hour, and a little one, in a lusty hand,
fcegan Jangrlir:g a summons to luncheon,
that they left the fascinating theme of the
treasure. Â¦ â¢
The ship's company had now shaken
Â¦ eic.vn and regular amusements filled each
cay. Lord Wlnstone p!ayed whist with
General Pcdesta and the two diamond
hunters, when the latter could be dragged
from, more attractive metal, while at
other times his lordship and Ihe old offi
cer had single-handed battles at cribbage.
Mme. Podesta developed a mild flirtation
'with Sis. Poltl. but the Italian, though
uniformly courteous, was somewhat unso
ciable and occupied most of his time in
readine.
Captain Ogilvie did not come as much
among his passengers as might have been
expected. He often spent whale days in
his own cabin, taking his meals there, and
only appearing on deck for a few mo
ments at a time.
â¢Mr. Crouch, hia first officer, however,
proved a man of exceedingly gregarious
instincts. He had fallen hopelessly in love
with his skipper's niece before leaving the
Thames, and now, with the ingenuous
frankness of most mariners, openly hinted
at his condition to his Junior officer, and
ostentationsly mourned his lack of means
and the hardships of a seaman's Ufa, es
pecially in the matter of marriage.
Passage through the Suez Canal was a
little Interrupted by a big French steam
er, which went aground a mile ahead of
the Morning Star, and it was during a
night of delay that Lord Wlnstone and
Meldrum had an Interesting chat in the
smoking room, after most of the passen
gers "were in their bunks.
."Some rum people on this ship," began
the sportsman. "I've a way of making
theories about everything and everybody,
as you know. Roy.. It's exciting work,
because the theories contradict each oth
er, and have regular battles among them
selves. In the case of our fellow crea
tures on this ship, two especially interest
meâ the skipper and that beetle-browed
Italian, Polti."
"He ought to have a monkey and hur
dy-gurdy to complete the picture," de
clared Roy. -"â¢
"He's got an ax to grind, I'll bet you.
not an organ. He's either a rascal or a
rascal catcher, that's my theory of him,"
"Perhaps he's both."
"It isn't impossible. He left his book
yesterday to go below for another cigar
and, chancing to pass'hts chair before he
came back, I took the liberty of glancing
at it. The elaborate coves is a blind. The
thing had cuttings from newspapers In it
all pasted on separate pages. They were
in Italian, which is Greek to me; but at
the head of one page, written In red ink,
was the word 'Ravogll.' and another set
of pages were headed 'Pannardo.' That
was significant, eh?"
"I never heard the namesâ and yet they
seem not quite strange."
"I should think not! Why, Ravogli was
the blackguard who killed the Archduke
Feedor of Russia. He stopped him at the
door of his summer palace in Oriel, Just
as he was going out shooting, and flung
.himself down and held out a petition.
The Archduke was begged not to take the
scroll, but he had leanings to socialism,
people said, and believed himself gener
ally beloved. So he-"waa in Orel, but not
by the. brood of vipers that are allowed to
ripen their poison in London and other
great centers. He opened the scroll, a
spring was broken and the infernal ma
chine exploded, killing the Archduke on
the spot and wounding three of his com
panions."
"An anarchist on this ship! By Jove!
that's a theory indeed. Fred."
"Either that or a detective interested in
them."
"But they've never been heard of in
Africa."
- "That's no reason why they never
should be. Imagine the blow to Great
Britain if such a man as Rhodes were
suddenly destroyed at this present criti
cal page in South African history!"
"Well, old man, you're a. cheerful com
panion for an ocean voyage. . And now, as
. to Captain Ogilvieâ what do you make of
him?"
"My theory of Ogilvie is, If possible,
still more serious."
"Good heavens! What could be worse
than an anarchist?"
"Nothing ashore, but several things
afloat. , Consider the crew of this ship.

to camp gear. If there iÂ» a man in Eng

out undue boasting, I am that man."
To this theme Lord "Wlnstone now de
voted himself, and an hour or two later,
after hearty expressions of thanks, Roy
kit his friend with a light heart and a
full notebook.
During the following week, while Tracy
Fain looked into the matter of a vessel
that would suit them, his cousin made the
necessary purchases, and the following
Friday found him nearly a thousand
pounds poorer in pocket. Chance was
kind in another directionâ at least so it
seemedâ for Fain renoi ted within a week
that one of the steamers of his firm had
bÂ«en signaled rathe-r unexpectedly off
Ushant and might be in London within
forty-eight hours.
"She is a fairly fast vesselâ one of the
old China clippers fitted as a steamerâ
but this voyage has been a record. She
must have had a farr wind behind her
ever since she left the cape. She will
load at once for the East Coast ports and
sail. If all's well, on the od of next No
vember. I've told the people at the of
fice I'm going, and when I went further
end mentioned the fact that I was think
ing of takine a cruise in the. Morning
Star they looked surprised, I assure you."
"Good news: and there's a chance of
Lord Wlnstone coming if he gets fit In
time. He pulled rather a face at the
idea of a 'tramp,' but he was awfully
tempted."
Fane looked uneasy.
"He wouldn't stand in with us, of
course?" -
"Why not? The more the merrier."
"What nonsense! What does a man
rolling in money want withâ ?'.'
my dear Tracy, don't fret your
self. That's all settled. I offered him a
third ehare if he would come, but. he said
he valued diamonds no more than | glass
and would give all the precious stones in
the world for a shot at a new antelope."
"You had no right to offer him a third.
-Half of anything we find is mine."
Meldrum flushed up and his blue eyes
grew bard.
"Great Scott! Has the very thought of
wealth made a miser of you already?
That's. not the spirit to pleas* me. Fain,
and you know It. You're a wise man and
I'm a foolâ granted; but we must under

Roy Meldrum, always a man of one
Hea at a time, "happened to know that
Lord Winstone was in town and the next
day spent a long morning with him. Ac
cording to his custom, the young- giant
set out every particular of the contem
plated excursion with absolute frankness.
His Lordship shewed keen interest and a
etrong Inclination to Join the expedition.
But he was little mure than convalescent
from a heavy attack of malarial feverâ
the outcome of his last experience abroad
âand could give no undertaking.
"I'm going in fear of my medical man
Just now," he said. "Yet, if 1 can bring
him round before you start 1 shou d dear
ly like to come. You're breaking new
ground for me, to some extent, and I'd
rather winter in. Africa than Eng.and,
fever or no fever; but I fear it's out of
the Question."
A long dlecussion followed and Meldrum
listened to the expert.
"Of course, modern ideas are all in fa
vor of a Lee-Metford repeater, with a long
conical bulJet and cordite behind it; but
I'm old-fashioned and shalUstiok to my
favorite battery as long as 1 can draw
trigger. A Elngle four-bore, sighted for
short range, and shooting twelve drachms
of powder and a spherical bullet, id the
first piece â for rhino and elephant, of
course, and dangerous game at close quar
ters. Then a double eight-bore, sighted
up to 200 yards; a doub.e .577 express, a
44 Winchester carbine, which is a weapon
I swear by at long ranges, and a twelve
bore shotgun. You won't want more than
that."
"But I'm on business, you know, not
pleasure."
"Business or pleasure, you must carry
guns in Central Africa."
His Lordship was silent a moment, then
continued :
"Yes, but be careful of your money.
You know Lord Wlnstone, don't you?
He's a famous East African hunter, and
he's been all through Central Africaâ at.
least through a good part of itâ after big
game. Have a chat with him about what
is practical. I rather fancy you ought to
lay in a cargo of beads and cheap knives
and rubbish. It won't cost much here
and will save your money on the other
side."
Tracy was going to ask him to write
the promise down, but felt rather . ner
vous of doing so. The other was touchy
on matters of honor, and might have re
sented it. Moreover, he felt safe enough.
A Meldmm's word was as good as hi 3
bond, and Fain knew that Roy would
have the power as well as the will to keep
his promise.
He thereforÂ© proceeded upon other sub
jects.
"We must leave nothing to chance. If
we can land at one of those small places
we can get little for Our expedition but
the necessary niggers. We must take
everything in the way of stores and camp
furniture with us."
"Heavy guns and Btores and" all the
reft of It."
land along one of the great rivers. From
Zambesi, on the coast of Mozambique, we
could follow the Zambesi River right
away for ISO miles and more northwest,
which would start ua well on our way;
or we might disembark at Rovuma - and
follow the river of that name along the
edge of German territory to Nyassa. That
would be In a fairly straight line for our
mark. "
Meldrum was delighted.'
"I can see you've been putting thought
into It already." he said.
"It's not thought; it's money that we
want."
"Well, and haven't we got mine? That's
all right Tou find the brains; I'll find
the brass. We want both." :,
"My people do some business with Zan
zibar and other email East African ports,
as it happens, and if you're game for a
cargo boat, I don't see why we should
delay taking our passages. There's only
one little condition I want to make. You
Â¦ee, I'm a beggar, excepting for what I
earn, and If we come back empty handed
I think I may reasonably ask you to
guarantee me as good a billet as I'm fling-
Ing up. Three hundred a year Is a flea
bite to many of the men you know In
Kent."
It did not occur to the other that, if
they returned empty' handed, he would
probably need a billet as much as his
cousin.
"That's all right, old chap. I'll see you
don't suffer. You may take my word for
it." .
"Because," said Lord Winstone, sol
emnly, "my theory of him i3 that the
man's a morphia-maniac and far ad
vanced on the road. I've had some bit

man and keen as a razor, but he'.-* not a

"What does that ail prove?"
"It proves that if the skipper fails
at a critical moment we might be In
a very unpleasant position.".
"But why imagine he will?"
"I do more than imagir.e. "I think it

worry you already, or I shall begin, to'
doubt it you are such a clever chap as I
always thought. As a matter of fact,
Fred VVinstone laughed at the Idea, of
finding the treasure at all."^
Fain was silent for a moment after this
sharp rebuke. Then he put out his hand
frankly, gripped Roy's with extreme ap
parent fervor and made a handsome apol
ogy.
"Forgive me. I beg your pardon ten
thousand times. As your Junior I had
no right to dictate and I hope you will
overlook my very foolish remark."
"That's all right, old man. And as to
the diamonds, Winstone absolutely re
fused my suggestion that ue should go
share and share with us. But he was
not hepeful, so be wise and don't set
your heart too much on what may prove
rainbow gold."
TJ^ word "rainbow" made Fain start,
an<rh</was glad it had grown too dark
for the other to see his face.
CHAPTER HI. . j
THE MORNING STAR.
On a bright sunlit evening in early,~No
vember the cousins found themselves lela
ureiy dropping down the Thames. ' The
river shone ruddy In the waning light and
the steamer set the water rippling and
twinkling along her sides und under her
tain ail like nery snakts wriggling In a
river of oil.
Through the gathering; darkness the
Morning Star passed down the Thames
and as Fain and Meldrum finally turned
In they heard a thousand unfamiliar
Eounds, the steady song of the screw, the
deep roar of the siren, the "fiendish rattle
of the ashes coming up from the stoke
hole and sound of many bells.
The novelty of their situation kept them
restless, but they slept at last, then woke*
before dawn to find the gentle, peace of
the river had vanished and, the * Morning
Star was beginning to shake herself and
wake up. They felt her lift, like a horse.
at a gate, as Hoy put It; an electric vi
tality seemed to inhabit the great hull
beneath them: overhead there was rac-;
Ing to and frd of heavy men, shouts and'
growls and whistles, . creaking and,groan
ing of timbers that uttered different com
plaints according to the force of the sea
and the hip and tumble of broken water
beneath the cabin porthole.
Meldrum got out of his bunk and tow
ered a huge figure in his pajamas. He be
gan by hitting his head and seeing stars,
then stumbled to the port to note another
Btrange concourse of Illuminationsâyel
low and green and crimson. Ghostly
things passed over the black sea; distant
lights flashed dimly and waved red and
yellow arms, tben vanished; a bell buoy,
tolling monotonously, slid past not thirty
yards from the cabin window. , Under his
feet the strong, bounding sensation of the
ship increased, and having no sea legs as
yet, Roy made but a poor Job of It re
turning to his bunk and carried away
- several objects before getting- back again.
Daylight found a fair wind blowing and
the Morning Star slipped speedily away to
the channel with "a bone in her teeth."',
Meldrum had' seen no more of j Lord
Wlnstone, but there was a rumor of
other passengers , aboard and at break
fast â served In a snug, deck . saloon of
dark oak â both Roy and Fain were agree
ably surprised to find no ; less = than ' five
fellow-voyagers, including two" ladles.".

a etrange blend of happiness and misery,
for love had come Into Itâ a great golden
first love that quite transfigured all
thoughts of the future and filled her lone
ly days with sunshine. Yet, before the
spectacle of her unfortunate uncle, her
young heart was torn with Borrow, and
her own powerlessness to aid made her
grief the greater.
Alister Ogilvle was the only near re
lation that his niece could claim. Born
at Cape Town, In 8outh Africa, she had
returned home as an Infant with her
mother, and her father. Richard Ogilvle,
a man of whom she could never get her
mother to . speak, was no more than a
name to her.
Once, after his wife'B departure from
Africa. Richard Ogilvle had written
home, and once his brother Allster. the
sea caotain. had visited him at Pieter
xnarllzburg, when hla vessel was lying for
a fortnight at Durban; but from that day
forward the man had never been seen or
heard of again. ,:'..%:,
There was a rumor that he had pro
ceeded with a big prospecting party Into
Matabeleland: whlJe other reports indica
ted that he had died of fever at Tham
bano, twelve months after his brother
last saw him: but tha truth was never
known and after eighteen years in igno
rance is to whether she was a wife or a
widow, Mrs. Ogilvle herself died in her
daughter's arms, and Elizabeth was left
aloneâ *t the age of one-and-twenty.
For her this. . her first voyage since
babyhood, had been fnll of sensations in
deed, and while she had found the man of
all others she believed most ltkelv to
max* her happyâ a man to whom her
lonely young heart went out with long
lsgâÂ«he, on her side, In all Innocence, had
set a light to two ardent beacons and
Btarted a rivalry between two friends â a
rivalry whlcn made one man bitter and
the other Â«ad.
There came a vtfll. hot night, when the
Morning- Star lay like a log under a red
moon. A faint gllmmar of light afar off
Indicated the Arabian shore, for the ves
sel had reached the portals of the Red
Sea and Captain Ogllvie expected to make
the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb on the fol
lowing day.
Just now, however, there had been a
ellirht accident in the engine-room which
called for some few hours' delay, and now
three red lights glared In a perpendicular
row aloft and warned craft to give the
Morning Star a wide berth as, for the
time being, she was unmanageable. She
might have made easy way under Ball,
but there was no wind to move a feather.
Some of the men were Dlaving cards;
the decks lay silent and deserted save for
the watch; from the fo'c'sle came a
rough "chanty" to the squeak of a con
certina and the clatter of bones. A small
awning was stretched aft. and under it
sat a man and woman alone.
With beating- heart and a strange sen
sation as of being In a dream world,
Elizabeth listened to Tracy Fain. So full
was her mind that she could hardly fol
low the thing he said, but the music of
his fine voice murmured melodiously on
her ear as he ran on. a
She had come there to be alone, per
haps to hide herself and follow the cur
rent of her thoughts without Interrup
tion; but Fain found her out and begged
to be allowed to stay. Timidly ehe gave
him leave, though she knew only too well
the reason for his petition. A moment
later and he had flung his cigar overboard
and was Bitting beside her.
"It's a story that's old as the hills and
as young es the daisies," he Bald. "It
comes to each In turn, like the waves of
a greaj sea. and tosses a man's heart
erest-hfgrh. like a cork on a billow. He
rises aloft, and then hÂ« sinks Into the
I depths, only to rise again on the next
Â¦wave of hope. I'm afraid my metaphors
and similes are getting mixed, but you
"Roy's character is very beautiful to
me. I did not know there was such a
simple, single-hearted man left in the
world. I worship him and I am a proud
woman to think I have won such a treas
ure as his love."
He bowed, then rose to leave her.
"You have my congratulations, and I
wish I could echo your estimate of our
mutual friend. But that he Is my friend
makes me silent. WÂ« need not speak of
him. But you will keep my secret. Miss
Ogilvie? I have a right to beg you to do
that"
"It is a eacred thing," she Â«ald se
riously; "none will ever learn from me
the honor you have done me, Mr. Fain.â¢
He was about to move away, but linger
ed. Many different thoughts coursed
through his mind, for the great agony of
his disappointment had not as yet crushed
into his heart. He could \ not realize
where he stood or that the hope and am
bition of the last four weeks were shat
tered.
He had counted In secret on victory;
he had read the signs, as he fancied,
and belltved himself safe. Now "no"
had fallen like a frost upon his soul and
had stricken him the deeper because he
expected "yes."
A purely trumpery, temporary Incident
now troubled Tracy Fain, and only a
great numbness crowding down over his
life yet indicated the suffering that was
to come.
For the moment he felt spark of anger,
not at his terrible mistake and unutter
able loss, but because upon Bessie's
throat hung the fetich of their present
adventure. The gold disk might mean
nothing; there was no good reason why
It should have the least to do with the
incomplete manuscript; but he chose at
this moment to resent Its present posi
tion, and told himself that Meldrum was
guilty of a breach of trust In thus play-
Ing in all a lover's foolishness with a
thing that might have the gravest bearing
on their future.
"I do not like to we that toy there."
he said suddenly, pointing to the disk.
"Roy has only a half interest in that
and he had no right to give it to you.
You might easily lose It."
She grew hot and her hand went up to
her neck.
"He told me the story and I understood
that you had the manusrlpt for your
share and that he kept this trinket. But
I will wear It no more. Indeed, knowing
the story of it I did not wish to do so,
only Roy Insisted. He said It would bring
him and you luck."
"You will be wiser to return it to him.
And now, good-night. Miss Ogllvie."
He passed away, moving silently like a
ghost, and she Bat long after he had gone,
until there came a sort of fear to her
heart and she shivered, though not with
cold.
Of Fain she had not thought a dozen
times since the beginning of the voyage.
Only after her hero proposed and was ac
cepted had she turned any attention to
his friends and tried to win Faln's regard
before the engagement should be an
nounced. Now she saw how he had mis
understood her, and she was very sorry.
Yet, while she pitied him, a. little uneasi
ness and even shadows of fear darkened
her mind. He was a strong inan, that
she knew, and a clever one. He had
never re-echoed his cousin's openly ex
pressed admiration for him. Now, unc6n-
Bdously enough, Elizabeth herself had be
come a stone of stumbling between them,
and her soul was full of vague presenti
ments as she retired to rest that night
CHAPTER V.
THE BLACK HAND FROM THE SKY.
Roy Meldrum's only fleeting sorrow up
to the last incident of this narrative had
Joker to Jericho from that day forrara.
He'd gone and wrecked his caste, you see,
an' was poison to all the other chapsâ a>
pariah, as they say. If he'd been a leper
man. they couldn't have glved un a wider
berth. *
"Well, the poor cove's life growed to bÂ«
a damn nuisance to him, beggin' pardon
for the fiery word. A nuisance it growed,
'cause the whites didn't know a syllable
of his lingo, an' his pals wouldn't be seen
on the same side 0' the ship with him.
"Then the 'old man'â as we allus calls
the skipper in the Mercantile Marineâ the
old man ups an' sez: 'I've . had about
enough of such tomfoolery. The poor
sweep'll go off his chump at this rate.
An' I Eez, That he will for sartain.'
"So skipper he pipes a muster ot the
niggers and has 'em up afore him In a
row and sends a quartermaster to tha
cook for the biggest ham he's got by him.
Then the old man Just gives 'em beans
an* tells 'em they be . the most knock
kneed, slack - twisted, herring - gutted
crowd as ever he sailed with.
"Then he sez, 'Now my Bons, I'll ; soon
settle this little matter once an' for all.'
So he takes tjie ham by the knuckle and
marches down that line of monkey- faced
La-scar men an 1 smacks each cove on the
head wi' the ham as he walks along!"
"That soon put 'em all level again; an* a
tidy fuss an' fury they kicked up, I as
sure 'e; but so 'twas, an' theer weern't
no more troubleâ not till the end of the
voyage, anyway."
Everybody laughed at Dan Hook's yarn
and thus encouraged he told one or two
more. . .
liien it was that a strange smell, that
staggered the nostrils of those who
sniffed it, attracted attention. It was
everywhere, but as Wlnstone " thrust his
sharp nose over the side of the ship he
started back In dismay, for the odor ap
peared to rise out df the sea; An open
port below, however, served to explain It,
and Inquiry proved that the window was
that of Signor Polti's cabin.
"A chemist, I'll lay," said Hook, not
guessing how near to and yet how far
from the truth, he had come. "I hope
theer ban't no harm in his powders an'
stinks, an' that he ain't arter any gert.
marvelous invention; for inventions, so
I've heard, is always discovered through
explosions and such like deviltries. I
blowed my eyelashes Into my head when
I was a bwoy, an' the door off its hinges
same time, but the only thing as I dis
covered was that my father could hit a
damn sight harder than gunpowderâ
beggin' your pardon for the fiery word."
Lord Wlnstone said nothing, but beck
oned his friends aside. ' .
"This awakes a suspicion that has slept
for some weeks now," he declared. "I
thought things were . steadying down,
and In so far as the captain Is concerned,
I believe they are. but Polti's up to
some sinister business, as sure as fate,
and it would be a rough piece of luck for
us if some high explosive manufactured
for other causes should blow the_boUom
out of the Morning Star."
"We can't prove anything "yet," an
swered Roy.
"Noâ excepting that he's a chemist and
occupies his cabin as a laboratory." said
his lordship. ."That's dangerous iii Itself.
He's no right to cook hell-broth* in this
shipâ or anywhere, for that matter. But
on board he would not De the only one
to suffer from an explosion. It's all right
when anarchists blow themselves to the
devil and makes one on better terms with
Providence generally; but it's all wrong
when they endanger the lives of honest
men."
Tracy Fain, however, did not share
their anxiety. He even sneered a little. S
"Perhaps the poor wretch is only mak
ing himself, some horrible, oily dish from
his mother-country that he cannot get
them to cook for him here. I'm sure, for
nrm engines did break down; lor ene De
longed to" that old-fashioned class of
ships on. which it was possible to make
sail. She carried not only steadying
staysails, but . canvas enough to push her
along in a good breeze.-
The storm broke in the afternoon and,
out of the darkness that suddenly spread
over sea and sky there came a yell and
scream and a jagged scrawl of blue light
that set every eye throbbing as it ex
ploded and seemed to tie huge ribbons
of livid flame at each masthead.
The sea rose instant and Ink-black.-
Great cross waves leaped alongside and
hissing tongues of water came aboard and
slipped here* and there snake- wise along
the dark decks. Hail flogged and churned
the sea and rattled like the discharge of
musketry on the skylights and Ironwork
of the steamer.
Invisible fingers seemed playing savage
music on the great harp of the cordage;
a screaming and sorrowing as of unhappy
spirits hurtled in the darkness above, and
on every, side came the thud of heavy
water; while almost within the first min
ute of the storm the Morning Star took
it black and heavy over her bows, and
the great ship stood still and shivered to
her keel plates like a frightened sheep.
The lightning blazed: its blue light
glared mistily over thÂ« raging sea and
showed where thÂ» hall had collected in
great," glimmering heaps along the Junc
tions of deck. and deckhouses, and wher
ever obstacles occurred to prevent it be
ing swept aft.
The Morning Star met the gale head
on, and now she had slowed down and
was pitching violently. The second en-,
gineer stood at the throttle valve, the
chief occupied ten places at once, but
the sea ran so tremendously high that
it was impossible' to do more than save
the propeller a little.
Now it stuck clean out of the water
and the vessel shook and groaned with
the awful race of the huge blades, then
down went the stern of the ship and the
whirling screw slapped into the sea
with a roar, tearing the heart of each
great black roller Into a caldron of ghost
ly foam, and putting luch strain as only
engineers can guess at upon shaft and
blade and throbbing piston. ,
-No attempt was made to travel against
the tempest! The log line hung Jerking
up and down astern; the "cherub," af
fixed to the taffrail, now tossed mute.
as the line hung limp, 1 now started to
run with a sound half purr, half screech.
Then perhaps came the "ting" of the bell,
again the strain was off and the hand on
the dial motionless. -

In his Judgment the center of the storm
was past, he edged his ship off a little
on her course again. But the attempt
was not successful. With the sea on her

Through that night and until the morn

been centered in a regret that his sweet
heart Imposed silence concerning their
engagement. He would have liked to tell
wery soul on board, to roar the gTeat
news through Captain Ogilvie's speaking
trumpet whenever another ship came
within hall, to shout his triumph to the
stars. Now, however, the truth was out,
in one quarter at any rate, and upon the
next occasion of a private talk with his
cousin Roy was surprised to find that
Tracy had learned the news. Thus Fain
unconsciously revealed his own secret.
As for Meldrum himself, he had been
swept clean off his legs by a tremendous
masculine tornado of love that shook his
big soul and banished every other emo
tion, thought and hope to limbo. His was
a nature incapable of much patience, and
before the Morning Star had left the Med
iterranean the young man had/ told his
love and asked Elizabeth Ogilvle bluntly
If she could ever care about a pAuper six
fe-et four Inches high, who worshiped the
deck she trod upon and the air she
breathed.
.Luckily for him she had long come to
the conclusion that she could. He was her
first love, and from the moment of ac
cepting him great Joy filled Elizabeth's
life, a Joy which even the sad and tragic
fate hanging over her uncle could not dis
pel. :Â¦':;$'
There came a day la the Indian Ocean
when the Morning Star was spanking
along at twelve knots and a little crowd
of passencrers sat around Mr. Dan Hook
and listened to that hardy mariner's yarns
of the past.
Dan was generally considered to be
rather broader than he was long, but his
proportions, such as they were, consisted
of nothing but hard muscle and harder
bone. Above this solid frame his bulldog
head, with small gray eyes, underhung
Jaw and fiat nose, rolled about on his
shoulders, now upon one, now the other.
It was always cocked sideways and he
very rarely took the trouble to open more
than one eye at a time.
The boatswain was a west country man
and the Devon accent tumbled and rolled
off his tongue In moments of excitement,
as It tumbled and rolled off the tongues of
Drake and Raleigh In the spacious days,
to the delight of good Queen Bess and the
merriment of her court.
Dan worked with lanyard and hand
spike, and as he did bo regaled the British
passengers with his doings on all the seven
seas. .The talk was of foreign sailors and
Mr. Hook's experience of them proved ex
tensive and peculiar.
"I was on a 'tramp,' by name the Fly
ing Fish," he said, "an* us had a Lascar
crew to her. Them cusses can work, if
you know how to handle 'em, but they've
gotten some blamed queer notions 'bout
matters of religion an' who be theer bet

stays when the ship pitched, an* corned a
cropper head fust. Not that that mat

against a gert ham, an* another Lascar

"Then there .was the douce an* all of a
tantara, I can tell 'e, because to touch
pork be so bad as to eat it if you'm a
heathen; an' tother niggers sent the poor
my part, garlic is more terrible than dy
namite," he said.
"No laughing matter, in my opinion,,
declared Roy, and Wlnstone agreed with
him.
Finally It was decided to speak to the
captain, whose health of late had con
spicuously Improved. They designed to
speak privately upon the subject and im
part suspicions, not unnatural under the
circumstances, yet of a sorj almost too
sensational for ready acceptance without
strong proof. Â»
The projected conference, however; was
not destined to be held. That afternoon
the pleasant conditions changed and cer
tain phenomena Indicated unfavorable
weather. The Morning Star was now well
on her voyage down the eastern coast
of Africa, and the following day.lt was
hoped she would cross .the line.
Her first port of call was Jumbo, a lit
tle town at the extreme south of Somali
land, notable as having given a name to
that African elephant of famous mem
ory whose 'loss London deplored l so bit
terly some few years ago. But now, out
of the Infinite horizon from the far dis
tant heart of the Indian Ocean, rose one
long livid purple line, straight and clean.'
It ascended, very slowly but steadily;
the glass began to fall rapidly and the
wind to fail and come in flaws.
CaptaUi Ogllvie found "himself a little
nearer shore - than he liked and, -fearing
heavy weather, furled all s^iil, for the
Morning Star always helped her steam
with sail In a fair wind, and stood out
a trifle to meet the oncoming doom.
Once or twice during the morning sharp
eyes had sighted the rugged mountain
region of the African coast. Now, how
ever, it swiftly fell beneath the horizon
and the dark and sullen violet' arch, of
the heavens rose higher ; and higher, . ap
parently increasing its npeed of progres
sion as it rushed from the east and dark
ened all the upper chambers of the air.
Toward the horizon and at the center
of the great cloud was one strange rift,
torn by an elemental chaos of which as
yet no Bound could be heard; but in " : Its
heart a savage, lurid, copper colored shad
ow, like some huge demon of the tem
pest, moved and Increased in size and
changed Its form as the darkness gath

with clawlike fingers; but amid Its pro
tean shapes each towered larger than the
last as It swiftly approached. -;;4raffi - '
Of the passengers none on board except
Lord Wlnstone had ever seen a storm at

the approaching chastisement none knew
beyond himself; but he liked it little
enough, and after his dark eyes had roved
in the still darker clouds, he withdrew to
his cabin and was no more seen.
/Captain Ogilvie faced the coming hur
ricane with' the self-command and confi
dence bred of knowledge and resource;
his niece felt perfect trust In him and had
no fear; the emotion in Meldrum's mind
was one of frank excitement at the pros

and the delight of the passengers, as the
sullen demon of the storm 'drew off and
fleeting but fierce tropic sunshine bright
ened the morning was sadly -dampened
upon the sudden mourning beating of the
ship's bell.
The funeral was not destined to follow
the usual procedure, however, for, when
the hands were ready and the dead man
laid peacefully on a grating In tight sewn
hammock with a round shot at his feet,
awaiting his last resting place, there
came a rumor that the captain was too 111
to conduct the 'ceremony.
Dan Hook brought the intelligence with
a blank face and whispered It to the first
officer, who was acting at the corpse"3
side for the captain.
A few of the passengers, including Lord
Winstone, Meldrum and Tracy Fain, were
present at the funeral; and now his Lord
ship was informed that, doubtless over
come by the privations . and anxieties of
the past four and twenty hours. Captain
Ogllvie had fallen back upon a worse en
emy than the ' storm Â¦' and' was lying in
capable of action. ' â¢
"And I beg and implore you'll read the
service, my Lord," concluded Mr. Crouch,
"for I'm no great shakes at such a Job,
best of times, and don't feel like it jus
now, I promise you. My arm is terribly
painful, too, from a blow I got last night.
There's a bone in the wrist carried away,
I fancy." Â« '^
Lord Wlnstone nodded, steadied him
self, and with one hand gripping a stay,
for the ship rolled heavily in a big sea,
and the other holding a prayer book, he
read in a high, hard voice the pathetio
words.
Then the grating was run out, even as
a greedy sea tumbled to the bulwark and
splashed the dead man's mates; and into
its dark bosom the corpse dropped with
Bolemn plunge, glimmering wanly through
the waves as it sank and fell astern.
"We therefore commit his body to the
deep, to be. turned to corruption', looking
for the resurrection of the body when the
sea shall give up Its dead." ' . â¢
At the end of the brief ceremony those
sailors who had been able to attend it
went forward, slow and gloomy, for the
dead man was a favorite; the officers re
turned to their duties and the passengers
disappeared into the saloon, where lunch
awaited them.
| Elizabeth Ogilvle walked sadly from her
uncle's cabin: With harsh words, he had
bid her depart and trouble him noamore. j
From the engine-room came clanking
of hammers, for some strain and damage
had resulted from tfie' storm, and in; the
saloon the clatter of; plates and business
of a meal went on as usual, though
voices were hushed before the sad Inci
dent of the morning, and those who knew
the truth concerning Alister Ogilvie Â¦wore
grave expressions at, that, other tragtdy
being . acted once more in the captain's
cabin. .
A gorgeous but brief sunset ended '.the
day, 1 and Roy Meldrum, with Elizabeth
Ogilvie and some others, stood above, the
throbbing screw that marked a great
green highway in the -wake of .the ship
and watched the ocean and Bky.
The sun. his disk having once touched
the sea, sank with 'amazing rapidity from
an orange horizon that faded toward the
zenith into pure, pale tones of beryL

wild whirl of wind-torn cloud.' all ruby

showed where the pavilions of the storm
etui tnrust their pinnacles above the hori
zon.
To north and south' crimson Islands,
great and small, floated through an ocean
of purple and merged together into flying
continents; while cloudy giants, under
tattered banners of sheer flame, rolled
above the sunset In awful battle, and all
the wide heaven burned and glowed to its
unfathomable heart with light' and with
flame.
Almost as they gazed these splendors
dwindled and the bewildering pageant
grew lifeless and pale. Then trembled out
a fleeting after-glow of pearly silver and
roseâ a dream sunset, on whose breast
hung, one planet, like a tear upon the
bosom of another dead day.
"Thus, in the hand of their God, do
wind and sun and the mist of the sun
magnificently labor together," said Lord
Winstone, gravely. "A sunset may be
more beautiful on shore- over high moun
tains and to the sound of bells and water
falls, but it is nevÂ«r so solemn as upon
the lonely sea," â¢ -
Roy nodded, and poor Bessie, sadly
overwrought by the stress of the storm
past and the"fear to come, could not
speak, but^gulned down her tears be
fore the dying glory of the sky and
squeezed her lover's hand under the
gathering darkness.
But another pair of eye* were survey
ing the sunset with added Knowledge and
very little sentiment.
Dan Hook knew the glass was falling
again; that a strange darkness was ad
vancing from the north to welcome night;
that the captain remained utterly in
capacitated, and that the first officer was
in his bunk with an injured wrist and
arm.
From the engine-room still came clink
ing and thunder of heavy hammers, "and
Hook turned his quid, sniffed the sea,
and stuck out his great under-hanging
Jaw till a row of yellow teeth showed
over his upper lip.
CHAPTER VI.
ON A LEE SHORE.
The Morning Star, as though she was
endowed with human -reason and human
distrust of the gloomy returning mon
ster behind her, made splendid progress.
Hook had given Mr. Macabe a bit of his
mind, and the engineer, alive to the sit
uation, was getting all he could out of
his engines.
A big following sea lifted the ship and
hurried her on her way, but each moment
the wind freshened and it became a ques
tion how soon she would have to turn her
nose to it or run the risk of ho'.ding on
until it was too late to turn.
Meldrum and Fain stood at the round
portholes of the, smoking-room, which
looked out aft, and watched ihe great
tumbling mountains of water rising above
the taffrail, all laced with the foam of
the screw. Each threatened to over
whelm the snip, but her nose dipped and
her stern cocked higher and higher, until
the treat mass slipped under her hull and
she wallowed, shaking and trembling as
before, with her propeller whirring naked
In the air.
"Wind freshening again," said Mel
drum. "By gad, it's a glorious thing to
think that men built of the same stuff
as. you and I invented ships! What a
fight! With the deep sea and the winds
of heaven and the lightning. And we
smoke our cigars and laugh, and pit our
brains and our steel and our steam
against the raving Titans, and beat 'em!"
"Not always. Only a fool would laugh
to-night, if you ask me. It was a circu
lar storm. Hook says, and is coming back
againâ with seven devils v worse that the
first from the look of it. The captain's
lying like a hog in hl3 bunk; Crouch la
moaning like a sick girl about nothing,
Wlnstone eays, and the second officer
can't work out his sights and knows lit
tle more about our reckoning than we do.
I wish we were out of it and I'm not
ashamed to say so. They've given up all
idea of calling at the first port with the
ridiculous name. In fact, we've passed it.
and shall be ofT Zanzibar before we
know It."
"So much the better. That's where we
â¢want to be."
Tho men were still friends to outward
seeming, but their relations had been not
a little strained since the incident of
Tracy's rejection. Fain, Indeed, taxed his
cousin afterward and ' blamed him bitter
ly for keeping his secret in the light of
hi3 own subsequent step; but Roy an
swered, truly enough, that he had never
dreamed that Tracy was smitten in the
same quarter with himself.
The subject was not one upon which
a man would be likely to unburden his
heart even to his dearest chum, and
though Meldrum had doubtless confessed
to his triumph proudly enough after Bes
sie's favorable answer to his prayer, yet
her own wish It 'was that sealed his
mouth. Afterward the mistaken girl's
efforts to win Faln's friendship had pre
cipitated the catastrophe of his proposal.
. On such a man as he wasâ proud, sensi
tive and not a little vainâ this reverse fell
with crushing force. It shattered his self
respect, terribly wounded his self-love
and awoke bad passions and reckless
, thoughts. His mind ran upon the future
and he brooded of what it might bring;
he allowed himself to sink into baseness
and dwelt on the picture of a future in
which he should return to England rich
beyond the dreams of avarice, while his
cousin and his cousin's future wife might
find themselves beggars.
Before this blackguard fancy hope
awakened. His busy brain . traversed a
thousand plans and possibilities, and he
told himself it was .never too late for a
woman to . change her mind.'
Between the men, therefore, Bessie had
come, and Meldrum' s magnanimity only
,made the 'position more , painful for his
'cousin. It is easy for a victor to be
generous, but difficult for him to escape
giving offense at every turn to those he
has defeated.
Unconscious Roy blundered daily and
inflamed a mind already bitter, and full
of gall. But Fain conducted himself out
wardly with propriety sufficient for the
case. His bearing toward Bessie was
well considered and she, wholly ignorant
of the truth, mentally commended her
disappointed lover and felt rejoiced that
he had taken; his sorrow in such manly,
fashion. So the position stood.
Meldrum and Fain shared a cabin, but
through those dark hours neither slept
much. The ship had been turned head
to. the wind at midnight, and now heavy
seas came over her bows and the cousins
In their bunks heard the crash and thun
*der of them and the hiss and rattle as
torrents of water dashed down the side
alleys scarcely two feet from their faces
where they v lay.
The deafening sounds Increased and
they felt themselves tossed and rolled
helplessly. The storm was evidently rising
and heavy seas flogged at the porthole
window, lighting : the cabin with a wan
Â¦ and ghostly , gleam from ' the phosphor
escence of the water, then falling with a
savage hiss back to the, deep and leaving
all In utter darkness.
is/very momeiii bugib uiua or crasn or
startled cry from deck seemed to sug- !
gest disaster; every moment Meldrura
was* about to dash out of bed and rush
to Bessie's rescue; but nothing definite
happened, and between the brief lulls
of .the shrieking wind he could hear, far
off In the hell of the waves, that slow
thud, thud of the faithful giant below,
and the sound warmed his heart, for he
knew that the Morning Star need fear
no 111 â given searoom â with sound pro
peller and engines.
The watch had been removed, both
from the fo'c'ale head and the forward
bridge, for no man could have stopped
upon the first, and there was danger on
the second; but though the cheery "all's
well!" did not echo across that savage
night, now and again came the windy
beat of the bell, tolling oft the half
hours, and that melody Is one of comfort,
too, to those In peril on the sea.
Few eyes closed on board the Morning
Star that night, and a sulky, leaden
morning at last illuminated the most ter
rible tempest that any soul on board had
witnessed. The laboring ship now slid
down sheer awful hills of water, lashed
and pitted by the wind; then, when the
destruction appeared a Question of. mo
ments only, with a shiver and stagger
and struggle, with the grinding concus
sion of a heavy sea aboard and a
smother of flying foam and green water
forward, her bows came up and her nose
gradually pointed into the sky.
Meldrum and Lord "Winston* climbed
up Into the wheelhouse to find the first
officer with his hand in a sllny and his
face drawn and haggard. His eyes were
on the wind gage, but It gave him no
hope, for the hurricane rather Increased
than moderated. -
Tho ship was straining heavily, and
from this altitude Meldrum was aston
ished to see what^a small thing the ves
sel looked in that awful sea, while the in
significance of the little creatures she
carried appeared almost appalling.
"How's the captain?" he asked.
"Better, Hook tells meâ or was last
night. But he didn't take anything to eat,
so I expect he had another dose."
This proved to be true. Ogllvie was
helpless, and * Lord Wlnstone, who went
to see him. did not stay a moment. But
the hypodermic syringe and a bottle of
morphia tablets, stuck into a small rack
at the captain's elbow, he possessed him
self of before retreating. Then, full of a
sudden determination, he pursued a rapid
search, and presently had the satisfaction
of finding the secret hoard of Allster
Ogilvie's morphia tubes hidden In a fiat
trunk.
Lord Wlnstone thought long before pur
suing an extreme measure, but, finally,
he removed every atom of morphia and
a moment later had flung it overboard.
He was familiar with the action of mor
phia and knew that Ogilvle, despite his
agony, would not die for lack of the drug,
but live to bless him.
For three hours the struggle with the
weather continued, and toward middayâ
as some slight improvement was reported,
and hearts began to beat more cheerfully
â there came a crash from the engine
room with cries and orders yelled louder
than the howl of the storm, and with
dense ribbons of steam curling and creep
ing through crevicea from below, to be
instantly blown Invisible as they touched
the wind.
A moment later came the terrible new?
that the screw shaft had broken at tht
third pair of thrust blocks. The ship, help
less and masterless, began to fall into tht
trough of the sea, and the question was
whether she could be got round tail' to
wind without going on her beam ends.
The steam escape pipes were shrieking a
veritable devil's song, and Mr. Macabe
tolled below where* the danger was a
bursting boiler; but every man stuck to
his post, though they knew the ship was
coming round and must, for some appal
ling moments, lie In the trough of the
seas.
Hook got a head sail or two on the
Morning Star, and of these one defied
the wind, though the other was blown
bodily away out of the bolt ropes.
But Providence helped the vessels at '
this critical juncture, for as '-she came j
broadside on to the storm there reigned
a few precious moments of comparative
calm upon the waters, and she was
nearly round before a heavy sea fell
aboard, swept her starboard side, sprung
her deckhouses, twisted a pair of davits
into corkscrews and smashed a boat.
A minute sooner and the whole weight
of this mountain of water would have
fallen into the ship and probably sunk J
her like a sardine box. Kow, however,
there was still a spark of hope.
Hook managed to get a little sail on
her, and then, at considerable risk, shook 1
out some more, for between two. perils, !
either of carrying away a mast or get
ting pooped, be chose the former.
Fortunately the sailing powers of the
Morning Star preserved her, for, as we
have said, she was rigged to carry un
usual canvas for a steamer even of her
day.
Hook's great and dally Jest with Mr.
Macabe had always been that their steam
power was merely auxiliary. Now the
chief engineer, with an engineer's usual
pluck and resource, was estimating the
possibility of tinkering the broken shaft
and getting a band round It with the
tools and appliances at his command.
But, meantime, the ship kept running
before the wind, and. as the storm abated
the first officer made more sail, until the
Morning Star, rejoicing in her old powers
and aided by the great following, seas,
tumbled and crashed forward at seven
good knots an hour.
Toward evening the sea grew a little
calmer. In the wheelhouse heads were
bent over a chart and anxious eyes fixed
upon the rugged and dangerous ccast line
of Zanzibar as represented in the map.
Where their ship was, exactly, neither of
the navigating officers could tell, but on
her 'present course they knew that she
must be rapidly nearlng the land.
"We'm on a lee shore, that's what we
be." declared Dan Hook. "We can stand
out a bit, no doubt, but Lord he knows
which way the currents set, or what we
ought to be looking for. I reckon we be
past Zanzibar this good few hours."
"The thing is to stand out a bit to
night anyway. We may get an obser
vation to-morrow," decided Mr. Crouch. â¢
The ship's course was altered, and as
she fell off a little another vessel was
reported through the gathering dusk.
She appeared to be about a mile or more
away, and was steaming steadily In a
northeasterly direction â a big, powerful
ship, which made little matter of the
waning storm, but pushed along rapidly
against it.
Suddenly a rocket went up from her,
then another as she was lost In the
gathering night. An answering stream
of fire* leaped aloft from the Star,
but nothing more of the strange ship
was seen, and whether she was signaling
for aid or warning her sister ship of
danger none knew until later.

"Let us not speak of those old stories,"
she said softly. The smile was gone out
of her eyes now. "Nor can I listen to
anything against Mr. Carlton.. He loved
me in his own way, I think, and, after all,
he was my husband, and a woman can
never forget that. I think of the dead
we should speak no evil."
"Of the dead?" said the man; in' quick
astonishment. "You meanâ "
"Mr. Carlton died five years ago."
"But you told me that your half mourn
ing was for your grandfather."
"So I did, and so it is. I did not think
It necessary to wear mourning â¢ for.' my

essarily a woman's enemy, and ehe felt
that what the man raid was true. Her
beauty was a little more full blown, but
I', was In comparison to that of her youth
as the perfect rose is to the opening bud.
For the man, time had worked Just the
change the wished to see. True, the
buoyant spirit of youth had gone from his
eyes and the would never again see the
f tar-chine in ihtrn when he spoke of his
hopes, his ambitions and his love for her.
Now they were dear and steadfast, look- .
ing out on the world with the confidence
of a foui that has proved its strength.
His hair was touched with gray over the
temples, but his face was ruddy with
health.
"It Is Ktranre that we should meet here
In the very shadow of St. Michael's," said
the woman.
-yes," said the man. "It Is strange.
"We were to have been married in St.
Michael's. Do you remember that older
time?" "Â¦.{Â¦'Â¦
They were walking leisurely up : the
ehaded avenue and it was some moments
before the woman replied. Then she said,
ecftly and without looking at hlmr
"A woman never forgets the older time,
but I had thought that it was different
with men. You know that hackneyed
quotation. 'Love Is of man's life a thing
Bp""t, 'tis woman's whole existence!* "
It is not often that a man notices a
woman's dress, but love made this man's
faculties keen, and he noted with a Joy
ful start that the woman's costume was
a sort of half mourning. He did not an
swer her last remark, but said:
. "You are wearing half mourning?"
He was looking at her with a keen
bepe in his eyes that the woman easily
read when she glanced up at him. Lower
ing her eyes, and veiling them with
long lashes eo that he could not see the
curious faint smile in them, ehe said with
a conventional Eigh:
"Yes, for my grandfather, who died re
cently. You had not heard of his death V
"No, I havÂ« heard nothing from any
one In the city for several years. I kept
up a correspondence with one or two of
ay friends for a few years and then It
dropped away and died a natural death.
When I noticed your half mournlnc I
thought for a. momeft't" â
He did not finish the remark, except
with a sort of half sigh that the woman
heard and understood perfectly. The cu
rious emlle in her downcast eyes became
more pronounced.
. The man went en, this time a little bit
terly:
" 'Man's love Is of man's life a thing
apart,' you say, and yet Jt seems that I
have better kept alive the memory of
that older time of which you spoke. You
married Carlton within a year of the
breaking of our encagement and never
gave me a chance to explain the accusa
tions that were brought againet me. I
at least have so well remembered that I
have never married." , â¢
"I was unjust," said the woman. "But
remember that I was very young and
knew very little of the world and of the
men and women who go to make It. It
can do no wrong to you nor to â to Mr.
Carlton to say that I have learned since
that I was all in the wrong. I would
have called you back, John, but my pride
would not let me. 1 waited until hope
died and then I ' married Carlton, who
had been, as you know, devoted to me
for a long time. I thought it for the best,
but perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps It
would have, been better to have waited
and waited." Â¦ .'.
The man looked down at her in sur
prise. His sense of honor was too keen
to permit him to make love to another
man's wife t and it was' a shock to his
memories o'f this woman for her to talk,
in this way. She had married Carltonâ a
man whom he despisedâ and It was not
for him to say anything to which the
most jealous husband might object. He
loved the woc.an, and- he was not will
ing that anything should be said by either
her or himself that would make the old
worship die away.
It was possible that the woman â¢ read
some of this train of thought in his face,
for she looked up at him once more. In
her eyes was a curious smile.
They had reached her house and she
asked him to come in.
"Thanks," he said, "but I fancy that it
will be Impossible for me to do- so. I shall
endeavor to catch the 12:15 train for the
West."
There was a cold dignity in his manner.
"You used to know Mr. Carlton, did you
not?" asked the woman demurely,.
"Yes," replied the man, 'a trifle grimly.

"Not with your light hair," said Arm

"Yes," and then both men laughed.
The message was as follows:
"Dear Brother Davie:- I am coming to
Boston. Please meet ma at the South
Station. The train leaves Hlnkley
Heights at 1 o'clock, and reaches Boston
at 2:32. ALICE ARMSTRONG."
"I didn't know jjou had a slater, Arm
strong."
"I haven't This li Â¦ my stepmother's
adopted child.. I haven't seen her for four
years; she was a pretty thing then; about
15. When my father and his wife went
abroad two years ago they placed the
child in a boarding school."
"I see she uses the name of Arm
strong."
"Oddly enough, that Is her own name.
My father's wife was a Mrs. Dana. In
adopting Alice she did not change the
child's name; and when she met and mar
ried my father she declared that Alice's
name was prophetic of what was to come.
I must go, Brainerd; I've barely time to
reach the station."
In the crowd at tha terminal he found
himself shoulder to shoulder with Bob
Tennessee, the detective.
"Hullo, Dave; gelng away?"
"No; expect my slater on this 2:31 Got
a cas* here. Bob?"
"Yes; a young fellow from Blanktonâ
bank messengerâ got fifty thousand on
him in cash and another fifty In nego
tiable bonds."
The 2:32 came slowly to a standstill, and
the passengers streamed out.
Armstrong had not long to wait. A
trim, stylish figure in gray, with skirts of
ankle length, and two heavy braids of
yellow hair tied in several places, school
girl fashion, with big black bows, rushed
up to, him. exclaiming. "Davla. Davle,
don't you know me. Davle V putting up a
pretty red mouth to be kissed.
Armstrong was surprised, but he wasn't
at all "slow," and as he walked away
with his pretty sister, he decided that
Alice had improved.
"Don't wait, Davie," pleaded Alice. **I m
In an awful hurry."
"Just a minute, child; Bob wants to
speak to me." t _
"Fooled, some way, Daveâ
"Got off somewhere else, perhaps."
"No, the 2:32 U express from Blank
ton." ' - â¢ '
"Mr. Tennessee, Alice; my sister. Miss
Armstrong,- Bob.."
Alice did not offer her hand nor raise
her eyes to Bob's face, as she- murmured
a faint acknowledgment.
"Will ' you take a carriage, Davie,
please? I am going to tha Cunard Una
pier. The Baxonla leaves at 8:30, and I
have engaged a stateroom."
"You are not going alone. Alice TV
"Oh, yes; mamma sent for me; she is
to meet me at Queenstown."
Armstrong, watching her bright face,
thinking It very charming, exclaimed sud
denly, "Alfce, what have you done to
your eyebrows?"
He was shocked at the quick paling of
the girl's face.
She was away before he could answer.
He waited patiently until the warning
came for "All ashore that's going ashore."
A smart-looking boy. with closely crop
ped, black hair, wearing a trim uniform
of blue, with gold braid on his cap,
rushed up to him. "Your sister was un
able to return. Mr. Armstrong, ar.d sent
this note. Hurry, sir; they are about to
lower the ulank."
Seated In the hansom, Mr. Armstrong
hastily reviewed the past hour. He was
annoyed and greatly dissatisfied. He had
disapproved of the elder Armstrong's
marriage, but nothing would Induce him
to be other than courteous to his father's
wife or kind to her child. He had met his
stepmother but a few times, and was
really not at all acquainted with this girl.
But she had appealed to him. as to a
brother. In a frankly affectionate way,
and he had been unwarrantably harsh.
"Why had he allowed that officious boy to
hurry him off the steamer In that way?
Poor, little thing; how she had trembled
as he held her against blm In the car
riage.
Bob Tennessee was waiting at Arm
strong's office.
"I'm eour on all the world, Dave," was
his greeting. "To think I should let that
little rascal slip through my hands! I
can't sea how It was done."
Armstrong wished Bob would go: hÂ«
wanted to read Alice's letter.
"I spotted that girl when she first got
off the train, but when I saw her make a
break for you I knew she wasn't my
bird."
"What was thÂ» description?" Arm
strong asked, trying to be polity.
Bob handed him a telegram slip and he
read aloud: Height, five feet five inches:
weight, about 130 pounds; blue eyes, black
hair, brows and lashes; uniform, dark
blue, black silk braid; vlsored cap with
gold braid.
Mr. Armstrong:, departing from his usual
habits, said "Damn!" very softly. This
was the boy who brought him the nota
from Alice! He put down tha telegram
and opened the note. "When ha had read
It. departing still more from his usual
habits, he said "Damn!" again, this time
very strongly.
He handed tha letter to Bob, and Bob
read aloud, slowly and carefully:
"My Adorable Davle: I didn't coma
from Hlnkley Heights. I boarded tha
train at Blankton. and it pulled out Just
in time for me to shake a 'day! day!'
from the rear end to the officers. I knew
they'd wire to Boston, but I was onto
their tricks, and 1 carried in my suit
case all the rigging for a tailor maid,
plus tha 'golden braid to hang down my
back.' I've had a proposing acquaintance
with the mest of the girls at Hinklfey
Heights, and the fair Alice didn't escape.
To soften her refusal, she told me she
had given her heart to another when sha
was only 15, and the early conqueror still
held the fort. I managed to find out tha
whole thing, and was shown your photo,
which has tha placa of honor in her den.
I didn't know then tha use I'd make of
the knowledge. I was afraid to trust to
the 'tailor maid' altogether, and you'll
admit it was a brilliant scheme to be met
at the station by so eminent a member of
tha Massachusetts bar as Mr. David Arm
strong. And I'd got enough of tha fam
ily history to carry my part with you all
right, all right.
"I enclose a - dollar bill. Please buy
some good cigars for our friend Bob.
"I'm telling you of the cinch you'v*
got with Alice, as a reward for the good
turn you've done me. Alice Is a peach,
but she hangs too high on the- tree for
arty but the very best, and I think you're
it. Yours truly. HENRY HARDY,
"Alsoâ Mark Browning.
"Otherwiseâ Jack Flnley.
"Aliasâ Little Freddie.
"Known to Mister Tennessee as Chum
- mis Charlie."
Bob groaned. Then he, too, said
"Damn!"â and said it forcibly and re
peatedly. "I wasn't prepared for this.
The bank people said it was a trusted
employeâ been with them over a year."
He rose, still groaning, and reached
for his hat: then He turned sharply to
Armstrong. "How is it you didn't know
your own sister?"
Armstrong explained.
, Tennessee shook his head slowly, groan-
Ing still more. ,
"Don't let my sister's name get mixed
up with this. Bob."
"I won't mention her. "vThere are you
going. Dave?" as Armstrong walked out
with him.
"To Hlnkley Heights. I must ba abla
to recognize my sister when I see her

But the outcome of his visit tÂ» Hlnkley
Heights is quit* another storx.

ages have forsaken home and family,
fighting more madly than wild beasts for

sacrificing religion, law, even reason it
self. Trailing along with the railroad
came the scum cf the earthâ thieves,
gamblers, eharpers of ell descriptions.
Women there were a few, whose lives an
unkind fate had linked with these grace
less ecamps of the frontier. They sat
now in the only habitable room of the
Gulch Tavern, a long one-etory shed, with
the usual white canvas roof. The parlor
boasted a Bteveâ a warm, luxurious stove.
Around this these women gathered in
xnute and ctony silence, inwardly dreading
the coming night, when the reeking dance
.halls, as near the gates of Hades as mor
tals can got In this life, would woo their
absent partners to the Insanity of cheap
drunkenness. L!fe was never very cer
tain at "The End of the Line." A chance
word, a quick Â«hot and only another man
tone. No one really cared.
The etorm had delaved the train six or
right hours, and long ago the last drop
cf llcuor had beep, drained to the Intense
prlef of the motley crew. One last hoarse
whistle announced the end of their Jour
ney, when a mad. precipitate rush was
made by the men, who paid scant atten
tion to the one woman who had spent a
terrified night in their midst, silently en
during the drunken orgy throughout her
tedious Journey.
Stumbling through the drifts, the men
eoon filled to oversowing the big general
room of the tavern, loudly demanding:
"Whisky!" "Plenty of It!" "Hot, and
C d Quick, too!"
In eucb awful ways doea civilisation
force Its inarch through a long line of
mertjTa. Science, fighting against ter
rific odda, was making an effort to reach
the new mines up among the clouds which
fcovtred over the mountain top.

it with savage fury, while the December
cold wu bo intense one's breath flouted
ahead in tiny ice crystals.
Nature never dreamed when she rent
the hills asunder, making a narrow cpen
lr.g to the plain below, that civilization In
it* crudest form would plant an outpost
there. t
The hills on both 6ldes of the frozen
mountain stream were covered with
ghai.edowr.6, mere shanties, whose rough
wooden 6ides. with canvas roofs and par
titions, were hardly covering sufficient to
keep out the wintry blasts.
There were three or four hundred of
these crude dwellings, besidf-s many tents
that had on extra covering of shaggy
skins, either bear or buffalo hide, which
served to chut out the bitterly cold wind
that swtpt eo pitilessly through the
Gulch.
Everything was hastily thrown to
gether In most clumey fashion, JuÂ»t for
the time cnly. for any day might come
the order, "L'p stakes, and move for
ward!" usually abuut ten miles ahead.
"The end of the line" only halted long
enough for these extra miles to be com
pleted. A new railroad was slowly and
painfully creeping through the Gulch.
Over the level plain of the "Great South
Park" tt had leaped with giant strides,
bavin* nothing to retard its progress
more formidable than the stiff grasses
and sagebrush that had etood untrodden
tor centuries. At the base of the moun-
ULlns facing this gorge it hesitated, where
rock upon rock and the steep ascents and
sudden turnings were enough to cause the
heart of the strongest engineer to quail.
Up came the road, first on one side, then

a ehaky foundation that was a near rela

quently eer.t stage horsea and passengers
down the inaccessible elde of the deadly
ravine, where their whitening bones wait
for eternity.
With one sweep the dishes were dis
posed of and the body stretched out to
await the dawn of another day.,
In the "crowd was a vagrant lawyer,
who hastily opened a sort of court to de
termine I what should be done with the
Duchess. Some one then remembered the
missing girl, and a search party was In
stantly dispatched in quest of her. During
its absence the celf-constituted Judge
FClemiily delivered his opinion: "That the
raid Dook Williams came to his death at
the- hands cf a woman whom he had de
ceived; that the said woman killed him
under great provocation, and that she
cercrves the mercy of the court in order
that she. may repent."
In this way a court that would have
lynched a claim Jumper on sight or a
horse thief coolly dismissed an every day
murder. While the -farcical court slowly
dissolved itself' the wretched woman
withdrew to her roomâ a tiny corner cur
tained off with blankets from the long
leading to the enter room, where the men
Â¦were still drinking.
"Come In here and eeÂ« what I have
done!" she shouted. Led by the gaunt
landlord, whose- firm favorite Paul had
been, part of the men filed in. The sight
of the dead face sobered them all. Tha
grief-stricken landlord rudely grasped the
Duchess by the shoulder. "My poor, dear
Paul, this she devil shall swing for It!".
Shaking off his detaining hand, the
Duchess faced the mob without a trace
of fear. "Swing nothln'; Dook deserved
all he got and more, too. He lied to that
paJe-faced girl; he lied to me. He swore
I was the only woman in the world worth
living for, and I wasn't a bad looking
woman before he robbed me of my other
eye. No, sir, there ain't no use a-talkin'
about swingin'. You Just make a p'ace
for Dook cut there on the table, where he
can lay."
The bright sunshine of th's splendid
day served to bring rut still more vividly
the sordid poverty of a miserable shake
down, which held in one corner a rude
camp bed, in another an old stove sup
porting a rusty boiler, while over a
steaming washtub bent a haggard one
eyed woman, who paused in her work to
mutter: "I with I hed let 'em done that
swingin'." Rtc, after it3 last journey
moved bodily with all its reeking wicked
ness, stands "The End of the ".Jne."
In June the hillsides were radiant with
beautiful variegated flowers and
grasses. The mountain streams glinted
nnd rippled in the sunlight. The rails
of a finished road wound ptacefully up
from the gulch. All around was lovely

storm, which grew fiercer every moment.
Soon the steaming "glasses of hot whisky
blotted out all remembrance of the young
girl or her fate.' . .
Outside, around the wretched tavern,
the wind still madly" raged. The broken
hearted girl, her senses dulled . by the
horror of the past scene, wandered aim
lessly until overtaken by night, with Its
mantle of darkness. On the hills the gray
wolves howled and howled. The swirling
snow piled the drifts higher and higher,
but no, silently and swiftly that soon all
trace of the wanderer was blotted out for
ever.
"Did you?" retorted she of the one eye.
"Then you'd better get b*ck there quick.

"I came to find my husband. Baby died
and I was so lonely." the girl said, more
to herself than otherwise.
"Who's your husband?"
"Paul W.ill!ams," she answered. Blmply.
"There ain't no man In the Gulch
narnM Paul Williams."
"Oh. yes; my husband wrote home from
here. He sent us mcrey. so when I was
alone I came out to live wif.i him. It 13
four years since he left us." repllPd the
girl, in a tired voice.
"WÂ«ll I tell you there ain't but one
man here named Williamsâ 'Dook' Wil
liamsâand he's been my liusband for two
years. You've come for nothin'."
"What shall I do?" cried the girl. In
sudden terror. "Oh, madam, you must
be mistaken. My husband is surely
here." â
"Well, I ain't, mistaken. You can juet
bet I ain't. I've been with this crowd
long enough to know every thief In It.
My husband Is the richest gambler in the
Gulch, and the hardest drinker, too. \ou

The girl, terrified by this brutal frank
ness, exclaimed: "How u-rriblcl Are you
not afraid of his?"
"Me?" the woman laughed scornfu.ly.
"me afraid? I guess not much. I put a

'The noisy chatter in the outer loom
was suddenly disturbed by the gen.-ral
welcome accorded to a new arrival. A
thick voice could be distinsusfced calling
out "Have one with me. boys."
After the clinking cf the g'.a-s<-s the
came voice asked: "NHiere's til-* Duchess?

the one-eyed woman.

stubbornly iterated the "Dook." ,
"Oh, ehe was. was she? Then what am

"You're aâ well, you're what you've a!

"Give me a name, you brute, if you

The man was fast lapsing Into drunken
nessâa bitter and recriminating drunken
ness. "You're a curse, a plain curse.
that's what you are. A d d plain and
ugly one, too, a one-eyed curse."
Finding herself alone, the solitary pas
senger, a pale, fragile girl, who looked
sadly out of place In such surroundings,
made her way with difficulty to the tavern
door. For a moment she stood dismayed
at the sight which confronted her in the
outer room. Then one man, kinder than
the others opened the door of the parlor
and the girl timidly entered the room
where the other women sat and made her
way to the stove. There she stood
amazed at the surrcundlr.es. impressed
above all with the unfriendliness of those
silent women. She carried a bag. which
she placed on the floor while she thawed
her numbed fingers. When the warmth
hnd Riven her courage she ventured to
speak: "I beg your pardon; this Is W es
ton Guich. is it not?" .
A coarse, one-eyed woman answered:
"Yes. Weeton's what It Is. Did you think
It was Boston?"
"I came from Boston," replied the girl.
Around the flre the other women still
sat. One roused enough to say: ''Kinder
tcvgh; she'll most likely freeze to delth."
"Hope she will; it's easier than
starvin'," said another.
"And she's made me kill the r'.che--t
gambler in the placeâ I may have to get
down to work again." was the savaga
comment of the Duchess, who again
kr.elt beside Paul, seeking for a sign of
life. Her deadly knife had done its work
only too well. Finding her task hopeless,
she again rose and threw open the door
"Take your traps with you and never
phow your face here again. 'Taint safe,
I tell rou!"
Opening the door, the girl for a moment
was daunted by the bitter cold. Then,
bravely facing the icy blast, she drew her
wraps tighter about her and was soon
swallowed up in the mas3 of swirling
Enow. '
Silently wrapping her shawl about her,
the girl walked toward the door,. Seeing
the bag by the stove, the woman threw
It after her.
"I killed him 'cause you came here:

She placed her hand over his heart.
"Yes; yes; dead, and I done It; done
Jt as he always said I would, and why?"
She gin need where the terrified girl
crouched silently weeping. The woman
rose and stood over her, shaking with
cruel rasslon.
Thoroughly enraged at this taunt, the
woman suddenly drew a knife from her
bosom and thrust It to the very hilt. Into

a sound. Then, throwing away her knife,
the bewildered woman sank to her knees
by his side.
"Have I killed him at last," she cried,
"the only man I ever cared for?"
THE SUNDAY CALL.

THE AND OF THE LINETHE SUNDAY CALL.I Vs^ 5 *^ EA^ HOLE at a recent meeting on behalf of Swanley
A|i Horticultural College spoke of a rich man to whom some
-^~|>o\ l|( QstB one sa "*Â« "Sir, your son has a marvelous talent for engin
.---^O*\ If eering. Place him in the workshop of some great firm and
/^-^r^^-ts^ I warrant you that in time the world will hear of him." The
\O/ ""^Svi father replied, "I wish my son to be a gentleman, not j a
"^^v^^^ stoker." "He maybe much worse than a stoker," rejoined
oSf^ the other; "he may be a loafer." The boy was sent to an
expensive public school and later to the unive-sity, and when he grew up he
did become a loafer, a barren tree in the orchard, a stumbling block in the
path.
To aim at culture as an immediate goal is to' invite defeat and to pave
the way to failure and disaster. In this respect culture is akin to beauty, the
pursuit of which as an end in itself always proved a sure sign of decadence
in the arts of architecture and sculpture. Culture and beauty form atmos
pheres which cannot exist by themselves, bui are the natural emanation from
honest and earnest work, and girdle with ambient grace the solid orb of use
ful arts and knowledge. The old-world opinion that usefulness is degrading
dies hard. Inherited from the sublime but inaccessible philosophy of the
Stoics, it tainted the teaching of the medieval schools and like a' noxious
weed still encumbers and renders fruitless many a seed-bed of education. The
record of the fact that the greatest being who ever trod this earth was a
carpenter should for all time have dispelled so absurd a heresy from Chris
tendom. To the credit of the Hohenzollerns and some other dynasties be it
said that the scions of royalty are invariably brought up to a trade or use
ful calling.
Theory and Practice Combined.
The unhappy divorce which until recent years separated knowledge from
usefulness went far toward permitting the world to be filled with idle schol
ars and ignorant workers. The demand for reform in educational methods
which is now reshaping the curriculum from the first step in the infant
school to the topmost rung of the educational ladder in the university owes
its success to the fact that it is the resultant of forces converging from two
different directions. It is urged on one side that the scholar, ignorant of
practical methods, is unable to apply his knowledge and is unfitted for the
real work of life, and on the other side that the worker who does not under
stand the scientific principles underlying his calling becomes a slave to rou
tine and is incapable of meeting the ever-varying requirements of progressive
trade and industry. Â¦ On the one hand there is a requirement for practical
work to counteract the school tendency to theory and on the other hand for
scientific instruction to enlighten practice. The educator of to-day endeav
ors to reconcile these apparently conflicting, but in reality complementary,
claims; he seeks to forge the link between theory and practice, and by com
bining science and art trains youth to be both scholarly and . skillful and
unites the aims of the workshop and the school.
Progressive Universities.
The Allied Colonial Universities Conference, held recently in London, re
vealed the fact that the universities of Greater Britain have adopted the view
that the avenues to culture and success may be made identical. The principal
and vice chancellor of Magill University said that "the universities beyond
the sea had long taken leave of the idea that a university can be held to dis
charge its whole duty if it keeps itself jealously apart from the practical inter
ests of life, and from the calls of the world's work."
Both new and old universities are establishing departments of commerce,
engineering and applied science, and are bent on adapting their teaching to
every-day requirements. Birmingham disdains not to teach the science and
art of wholesomely brewing the national beverage. Cambridge, has estab
lished a tripos in economics. The tide of affairs now surges within the very
portals of the ancient seats of learning. The cloistered seclusion of colleges
facing inward to a quadrangle is no longer in keeping with the altered rela
tionship between knowledge and business. The thoughts of men are uncon
sciously embodied in their architecture. In America a significant , struc
tural change has taken place in the arrangement of college buildings. These
are now turned outward and face the world as if typical of the manner in
which the successful student steps directly from his Alma Mater into v the
workshop or counting-house.
The close nexus which has been woven between the centers of learning
and the practical affairs of life is attended with mutual advantage. Busi
ness is enriched by the accession of well-trained . intelligence, and the basis
of culture gains breadth and strength. Where all forms of knowledge are
widely spread it is possible for gifted individuals to attain a higher, degree
of culture than whete the general average of education is on a lower plane,
just as the loftiest mountain peaks spring as a rule from a high range of sur
rounding country.
In nt> direction has the influence of the age been more marked. than in
the increased estimation of commercial callings. Trade and commerce are
the channels in which the bold and adventurous spirits of the modern world
embark their energies; success in these callings demands high intellectual
and moral qualities which have been enumerated by recognized authorities as
follows: Extraordinary energy, good judgment, courage, resourcefulness, in
sight for the purpose of selecting suitable subordinates, vivid imagination and
firm upright character. These aptitudes which not only deserve and
command success, but also* go far toward forming a cultured and admirable
character. Above all the active temperament is essential, for it is useless to
perceive the possibilities of a position without possessing the initiative neces
sary to grasp it.' .. ' . ; " /
The alliance of both culture and success with activity is destined to grow
more and more' intimate. The truth of the saying that action and not .
thought should be the aim of life is now universally admitted. In action
knowledge" is confirmed and doubt dispelled. The command of the ancient
oracle, "Know thyself," can be best fulfilled by . the modern injunction,
"Find out what you can do." But not only is well ordered and rightly di
rected activity the legitimate goal of knowledge, it is through action that
knowledge enters the human mind. Activity stands therefore with regard to
knowledge both as cause and effect. : ;
Muscular' Knowledge.
The recognition of the important part played by the muscular system in
imbibing knowledge has revolutionized the methods of education. Formerly"
the pupil was regarded as a passiverecipient of information. The active
mood was reserved for the teacher, who accounted himself happy if he was .
permitted with, the minimum of resistance "to bombard the ears and eyes of
his pupils with spoken and written words. The true meaning of the word ap
prehension" was lost sight of. The memory was crammed with matter pitch
forked at random without regard to the readiness of the active agents of the
mind to -receive, and arrange it in some sort of order. Had it not been for
the healthy playground art of forgetting indigestible and unsuitable material
the old type of school would have been a wholesale manufactory of confused
intellects and irresolute wills. Many children with feeble powers of resistance,
whose minds were filled with loose, unattached words, shared the perplexity,
of poor Paul Dombey, to whom whether twenty Romuluses made a Remus,
or Hie Haec Hoc was a. troy weight, or a verb always agreed with ah ancient
Briton, were open questions. (
All this has "now been changed. Systematic hand and eye training have
won a permanent place in the curriculum of every efficient school and have
been found not only to strengthen the powers of observation and to promote
neatness and dexterity, but also to quicken generally the power of intellect
ual apprehension, so that the faculty of acquiring information from books is
greatly increased. When these new methods were first' advocated it wa3
claimed that the workshop might fairly be regarded as a usefuf adjunct to the
classroom, but so, successful has the new departure proved that in some cases
the schoolday is divided into two equal parts, half only* being spent 'in the
classroom and the remainder devoted to the workshop, laboratory and garden.*
The fear that over-pressure might result from the addition of these studies
has been dispelled; they form in reality a welcome relief from book work; they
are not so much new subjects as improved methods of dealing with all sub
jects so that a skillful co-ordination of workshop and classroom does not ex
tend the field of study, but rather provides a deeper tilth of ground, already
occupied but imperfectly cultivated. The lessons are not merely .read, but
marked, learned and inwardly digestad, and information thus acquired, be
comes thoroughly assimilated. Thus! are satisfied the requirements of cul
ture no less than of success, and in this path both aims are reconciled.
A General Training Indispensable.
The training of the senses to appreciate the beautiful and of the will to
choose the right are also essential conditions of culture, and these are in no
other way fulfilled so well as by education through activity, which alone sat
isfies, the desideratum of training of head, hand and heart. The road of gen
eral education ; for success may now be said to be fairly well .defined and in
most respects is found to be identical with that of true culture^ but there are
no short cuts to the goal of immediate utility. Too early specialization
stunts intellectual growth and unduly narrows the view. No; matter what
shape the, vessel is destined ultimately to assume, all the clay must alike un
dergo a preliminary tempering and preparation. The technical school by its
promise of immediate fruit must never be allowed to'usurp the years which
should be devoted to preliminary education. On a sound . stock, of general
training the special aptitude for any particular/ calling can be readily en
grafted. The simultaneous and harmonious development through exercise of ;
all the faculties of mind and body during the plastic years V of youth ' consti
tutes the brst possible guarantee for a successful and well spent life, but woe
be to the educator who measures success byV mere: money making. This
would be an infinitely) more deplorable and fatal error than the old-fashioned
view of education as the mere: acquisition of iknowledge. : The' ; teacher is the .
gardener of humanity whose 'object. should be to Increase and strengthen the
heart wood of the tree. Accretions, whether of " facts in the â¢ head I or , gold in
the pocket, are as lichens which entrust ' the ; bark but are not indicative of i
real growth. : â¢
â¢ In this respect it is well to call to mind the glowing words with which
Mrs. Ewingconcludes the, story of "Jackanapes": ,.'-â¢,
"Very sweet are the uses of prosperity,: the harvests, of peace and prog
ress, the fostering sunshine of health and '. happiness and length" of ; days in the
land. But there <be things i**.*i,'the;goodoffcwhich' and: the ;. use of
which are beyond all calculation of worldly goods and earthly fuses; things
such as Love and Honor and the Soul of Man, which cannot ;be bought with
a price, and which do not die with death. And they. ; who : would fain live
happily ever after should. not leave these things out of the lessons of thdr
lives." .^ Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦Â¦.Â¦. .â¢*'".-Â¦ Â¦-.-.--. â¢"-
Shall the child be sent to public or private school? This is a hard ques
tion to answer, unless it be answered by saying that he should be, sent to
the best school. Other things being equal, that school will be where ia
found the ' best teacher. ajp^gÂ§gBg|
Someprivate schools have certain advantages over the public schools
of some localities. The convictions of some lead many to send to schools for
that religious instruction which they feel is a necessity.* Manv of these find
it best to transfer to the public schools as soon as they can conscien^ously
do to.
Where they are what they should be, it will generally be found that the
best training is given in the public schools. Their equipment is generally
far; superior. The State requires a certain, definite pedagogical training
of every teacher; while any one. without special preparation, can teach in a
private school. . .
Too many parents send their children to private schools because, so
long as the, tuition isypaid promptly, their children are permitted to* do
about as they "please and study when and what they like. Thus they un
wittingly injure their chances for. the future. Before it is too late many
discover the mistake and send to the public school, where thev are treated
just as they deserve to be. regardless of the homes from which they come.
This is ' certainly the best preparation for life.
Private or Public Schools.
The age at which children may be sent to the public school raries id
the different States. Six admit at the age of four; nineteen at five, twentfl
at six. Some children develop more rapidly than others, but few. if any,
are sufficiently developed to be deprived of their mental and physical free
dom before they are five years old. Many who have reached the age of six
should not be kept in school more than one-half a day, unless the work Is
imbued with the kindergarten spirit. The records prove that most chil
dren who enter at the age of seven or eight soon overtake and pass thosa
who have entered at an earlier age. Worse than this, too often those enter
ing early become dwarfed mentally when they should be at their best. It u
important to remember that these first years are the time for physical
growth. By their childish play and simple investigation they will learn
more between the ages of three and six than'they will ever learn a! school in
twice that time. - . *
The child who is sent to the kindergarten should be sent before the agÂ«
of six. Better at the age of five, provided it is a kindergarten in fact and
not merely in name. If the so-called kindergarten instills, in a pleasant
way, habits of obedience, attention, truth, tidiness, order, courtesy and good
manners in general, it is a good kindergarten. In too many most of thesa
ends are not reached. If the teacher 13 well prepared and has the right
spirit it is safe to trust your child's interests to her. Otherwise, it is not.
The right kind of a home will be far better than such a school.
Age of Entering School,
[S â * _ ..JlEz&fi EARS ago. while passing along the street in New York, a
Ii"^^^^v5^<il yÂ° un K artist saw a beautiful child, in which hl3- trained eye
perceived more perfection than he had ever seen before in
l/Â£i^lvv'fil any human bcm K- He could not pass Jt by. He gazed
and RazcdI The more he studied the little boy the more
Ty(^iM^6^^ angelic his perfection seemed "I must paint that child's
f j^^^^aif>^a picture." he exclaimed. "I will never see such a child
again." He painted it; and, it is said, drew from It the
inspiration which made him famous, for it filled him with the highest and
noblest of thoughts.
Because of his love for it, he refused fabulous offers. Those who had
children ofwtheir own loved them better because of the sight of it. ThoM
who had no children longed for them as they gazed upon the eanvaa,
Those who had lost their little ones seemed lifted nearer heaven as they,
stood before it. The artist said: "If I can find a human being sufficiently;
hideous, I will paint it to show the contrast." Many years passed before his
search was rewarded. Finally, in a foreign country, he found a hideous
man, the personification of all that 1 was vile and Infamous. He lay upon tbd
prison floor, clad in rags, with haggard face and bloodshot eyes, cursing God
and man, while he waited for the summons to the gallows to pay.tha pcs>
alty of one of his foul murders. The artist received permission to paint thd
picture*. The contrast was something terrible in its* completeness. Imagla*
if you can the dreadful shock to the artist when he discovered that he had.
painted two pictures of the same person. The angelic child, because of tha
improper training received from his parents, had developed into thÂ« inhu
man fiend. . Â¦ . '
About this time of year many anxious parents are asking themselves
asking such questions as: At what age should a child start to school?
What about the kindergarten? Shall I send to public or private school?
Since the future welfare of a child may largely depend upon the proper aa
swers to these questions, they are of vital importance; for next to. his homo
his school home most powerfully influences each child's development.
Too many parents send their children to school for the purpose of scat
ting rid of them. It is quite natural that the tired mother should feel di*Â«
posed to shift the responsibility to the stfoulders of the teacher. However,
is it not the parent's duty to consider, not her own comfort, but rather thg
mental, moral and physical welfare of the child? ':' i

A CHILD'S SAD
DAYS.
FiftnTalR by W. J. Shearer, A.M., Pd. D.
* -i-^i, iji OPEKA. Kans., Oct ia.â The*" women of Kansas recently won their greatest political victory ovÂ«r*
r5y^5ri3n5 their husbands, brothers, fathers and sweethearts, and the reports of the affray are reaching the
! SB 139 office of 'the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in the form of returns from the/ school
l-K S&; district elections. These returns indicate that the women have elected a majority of the members
gÂ£^ Safe Â°^ the country school boards in the two thousand district* of the State. The platform on which
Â«3 *Wi thc womrn conducted their campaign for control of the schools was kept a secret until the day of
hS5Â»Â«r%Â«-3\\ the balloting. It declared for wiping out the objectionable provisions of the teachers' contracts
*Â¦Â¦ Â¦ wmmm * which forbid the women teachers to receive attentions and calls from their gentlemen admirers
during the school term and provide for forfeiture of a portion of their salaries If the women marry before the end
of their terms. . . .
The campaign which the women conducted for control of the schools was one of the most secret m the history
of the State. For .genuine "gum shoe" work it has no equal in political 'Campaigns . in Kansas, and there have been
a number of very quiet ones in the State. When it became known three months ago that the country school
boards, which were then controlled by the men, would not make contracts with women teachers for the coming
year unless the contracts contained the provisions in regard to marrying, the women decided to gain control of
the boards. They kept their intentions to", themselves and started a secret campaign. Every woman in the districts
affected by the new order was urged to come to the polls on the day of election in July or August and vote for
three women for members of the district board. Only in a few of the districts did the fact become known that the
women were after the offices, and in some of these the men made stubborn fights.
A majority of the elections were held in August However, some were held in June and July. A majority of
those held in July were won by the woman because the men were too busy in the harvest fields to pay much atten
tion to public affairs. The August elections also found a majority of the men busy and the women won nearly all of
them.. The women did not appear at the polls until the afternoon of the day of the voting, and then they came in
force and carried the day before the men could rally their scattered strength. It was a carefully planned 'surprise
and well executed. Thc men could scarcely believe the stories they heard after the votes had been counted, lien
who had served'on the district boards until they had come to be looked upon as owners of the school buildings
were unseated by large majorities and found that the wife or daughter of some neighbor had been elected in their
stcaÂ£ . . *
Every contract which has been let by the new boards leaves the teacher free to receive calls from gentlemen
friends and to get married before the end of the school term if she desires. In the districts where the women
elected all three of thc members of the boards they are even talking of depriving the male teacher of the privilege
of smoking on pain of forfeiting, a part of their monthly salaries. This action, would be taken only by way of retalia
tion for the action of the boards which have prohibited the women teachers from marrying.
In nearly all of the districts where the: women were successful the men have cheerfully given up their places
and have announced their intention of making the next fight a harder one. In other places the men have threatened
to carry the contest to the courts. They have declared that the women used illegal methods to influence voters and in
conducting the campaign. Very few of tfiese threats show signs of, materializing. ''/-â¢
One report which has reached the State Superintendent is to the effect that force was necessary to obtain. the
places on the board in a Morris County district. The women there had elected their candidates â¢ and . all .the men
surrendered their places with the, exception of W^T.rEckert; the chairman of the board, who has had the place for
thirty years. The women" made no* demonstration" until thelday of the next board meeting, 1 ? when they gathered at the
schoolhouse door and forcibly took the keys of thc-building from Eckert's person and-drbve him away: from the
meeting. â¢ -...: "Â¦."'*%: . ".. " ,â¢ "I;.

It meant that Mr. Coolidge was. to '.put

"Mr. Coolidge is In your private room,

President Willetts in particular. It .was a

Such was the first of a series of skir
mishej by means of which the diminutive
Napoleon : of the Street captured the float-
Ing supply of Iowa Midland stock, until
he had not less than 65,000 shares safe In
his clutches.
All the old tricks that he knew and new
devices he Invented were used , to hido
from the Street the fact that Mr. Greener
was buying the stock on every opportun
ity. ,BUt beyond a certain limit extensive
purchases of a particular stock cannot be

violent : fluctuations' - of the past .few
months. This fact and the remarkable Im
provement of business alone the line : of
the road caused a.- "substantial ' rise" ' in
the price of the company's. securities.' But
no one suspected the little Napoleon with
the shifty eyes and the squeak and the
genius, who had bought in the open mar
ket, through unsuspected brokers,' and' in
Iowa from the local holders, by means of
secret agents, until he had accumulated
78,600 shares.
In- addition, Coolidge, employing several
brokers, purchased 23,000 shares in all,
â¢yvhlch meant that Mr. Greener, after "cov
ering" Brown's early "short sales," was
'in. possession of fully 14,000 shares of the
common fctock of the Iowa Midland Rail
way Company, at a price averaging near
ly 6 points lower than they could have
been bought on the preceding day, which
Is to say $75,000 cheaper.
But Erowh & Greener had made as much
on their short. sales, which was actually
equivalent to having the lambs pay a man
for the privilege of being shorn byhlm!
Each reporter. who saw that smile went
away convinced to the life wagering point
that Mr. John' F. Greener was in control
of the Iowa Midland. And they wrote ac

skillful display, of unwillingness, : that he
had bought Iowa Midland , stock. As to
the amount, he said that was not of Inter

finally cornered him and succeeded in
making the little financier say, with a
fleeting and very peculiar smile: "Yes, It

etc.Â» etc. , that Mr. John F. Greener had
been responsible for the fall and rise of
Iowa Midland stock: that for months he
had been buying' it on the Stock .Ex
change; that he had quietly picked up
some large blocks In Iowa. All of which
was very sad, and, worse still, true. Also,
that Mr. 'Greener now held. 182,300 shares
of the stock, which was even sadder, but
untrue.
The clerk had studied Greener's Napo
leonic methods for two years. He had
learned patience for one thing, and he had
waited for his chance. It had come at
last and he- knew it... I.
The clerk all that wee* did nothing but
collect .the Iowa Midland proxies prom
ised by the complaisant trust companies.
They amounted to 21,200 shares. Prom

Rock, and I think it is worth more to me
than to anybbdy else. I'll raise your sal

than I had at your age, Mr. Rock."
"Very well," said Rock quietly. "I'li do
the best I can." But once away from
Greener, his face flushed with anger and
indignation.' '"Ten thousand for what
might be worth ten millions to the Rn&n

"Is that a good price for the work, Mr.
Greener? I may have to pay out a great
deal," added the young clerk, with a faint
touch of bitterness. * â¢ - - >
Not by bo much as the twinkling of an
.eyq 'did .the. little man betray that he was
Interested in Rock's words, or that the
clerk's meddling with the firm's affairs
was at all out of the ordinary. - >
."Mr. Greener," said the clerk, very ear
nestly, "I should like to try to get them
for you." '
"Yes," he squeaked, absent-mindedly.
"Yes, sir," answered Rock.
"Go ahead, then," said Mr. Greener,
carelessly. "Let, me know next week
how you are getting on." â¢
An expression .of disappointment came
Into Rock's fa.ee, whereupon Greener
added, "Of course, if you succeed, I'll do
well'- by you."
"What will you do, Mr. Greener?" asked
the clerk, looking straight at him.
"I'll give you," he squeaked, encourag
ingly, " ten thousand .dollars." Â¦
"Eh?" squeaked Greener, Innocently.
"I figure that; unless you are doing
something outside this office, you will
need proxies for 60,000 shares more to give
you absolute control and elect your own
board of director* and carry out your
plans in connection with Keokuk and
Northern." .
'Midland was best of all, if It only could
be secured. But of this this shallow-faced
little man with the high forehead and the
shifty eye* -was doubtful.
. He estimatedâ It had cost him $11,000 to
secure. the necessary dataâ that Wlllett*
and hi* ellque held 105,000 share*. *o that
there were still 122,000 share* unaccounted
forâ probably scattered among small in
vestors throughout the country, who did
not care who managed the road so long
as^ they received pleasant promises of
dividends, and also among- banking houses
and anti-Greener men, who, though they
did not approve of Willetts, disapproved
even more emphatically and vehemently
of Greener and his method*.
If he could not buy the stock itself he
must try to secure proxies.
Ho knew that some of the -trust com
panies held a fair amount of the longed
for stock. He laid siege to them. He
bombarded them with pledges and pTom
lses bo honorable, so sound and business
like, as to pierce the armor of their dis
trust. In the end they actually grew to
believe that they were acting wisely when
they pledged their support to Mr. Greener
and .they agreed to give him their proxies
[whenever he should send for them.
He called his clerk. Rock and told htm:
"Go to the Rural Trust Company and to
the Commercial Loan and Trust Company.
See Mr. Roberts and Mr.. Morgan. They
will give you some Iowa Midland proxies
made out to Frederick Rock or John F.
Greener."
Rock waa a good-looking, quiat chap,
with a very well shaped head and a reso
lute chin. His manners were pleasing. He
had 'a habit of looking one straight In the
eyes, but. did. not always succeed thereby
In conveying an impression of straight
forwardness. But he certainly impressed
one as being' bold and keen.
"Mr. Greener,", said Rock, "you are
carrying 110,000 shares of stock, are you
not?"
"Good morning; Mr. Weddell"
"Good morning-, sir," *ald the basks*
coldly, "I ! must say I'm somewhat sur
prised at the presumption of your people
In sending- you to me."
"Mr. Weddell." said Rock. Tv* left thÂ«
firm of Brown & Greener. They were." he
added, youthfully, "too rascally for me.**

feared an application for a position,
"Ye-esT" he said. His voice matched

"Mr. Weddell." said tha yocnx elerk.
looking* straight into the old banker**
eyes, "you. In common with other honest
men, have been wlshlns; you could pre
vent Mr. Greener from wrecking- thÂ« Iowa
Midland. Now, Mr. Weddell," h'e went
on eagerly, a* the enthusiasm of the plaa
grew ut)on him. "I know all about Mr.
Greener's plans and resource* and I want
you to help me fight him. If you do we
win win, sure."
"How will you f o about It 77 asked the
old banker, evasively. He was not cer
tain this was not some trick of the versa*
tile Mr. John F. Greener.
"Mr. Greener." answered young- Rock.
"has not control of the> property. â¢ He baa
only 110,600 shares.. I had access to the
books and I know to a share."
"I don't wish you to betray an employ
er's secrets, even though he may be my
enemy. I do not care to hear any more."
He was an old fashioned banker, was
Mr. Weddell.
"I am not betraying any secrets. Ha
himself said he had over 110,000 shares,
and all the reporters Jumped at the con
clusion that he had actually a controlling
Interest. And that Is what he will have
unless you help me. I have proxies here
for 28.300 shares from the trust companies
and commission houses. . My plan Is to
get all the proxies 1 can from the ahti-
Greener and thÂ© antl-Willetts stockhold
ers. Then we can make Mr. Wllletts give
us pledges in black and white to inaugu
rate the much needed reforms and stop
his policy of extravagance and his costly
traffic arrangements. WiUetts will do It
to save himself and the road from falling
Into Greener's hands. But there"3 no time
to lose, Mr. Weddell," The excitement
of the, game he was playing stimulated
him like- wine. .
"And you?" queried tht. oli banker,
meaning!}'. "Where do you conÂ»e,ra?"
The insinuation was his last, weapon.
"I? It might be, Mr. Weddell, that
of alluring and unauthorised promise*, he
secured 7100 charts; In ail he had 23.3CO
Â¦hares. This meant that the approaching
annual meeting Mr. Greener could vota
1S3.900 share* out of a possible total of
CO .oca Unless the opposition could unit*
the election was already cure, tÂ» **gÂ» Mr.
Greener** way." . -
From time to time, when the little finan
cier would ask Rock how he wu progreas>
lns, the clerk would tell him he wu do
ing: as well as could be expected. He also
told Mr. Greener that the trust compa
nies had given only 14,000 snares, and h*
Â¦aid nothing- whatever of the 7100 shares
be had secured from the friendly broker*.
It was a desperate chance, this concealing
from. Mr. Greener how well ho had done;
but the clerk wu bold. '
The moment Rock became convinced
that there were no more pro-Greener
proxies to be had by hook or crook, he
beyejn his attack on the enemy. IDs
problem was to capture the anti-GreÂ«ner
votesâ or stock. ' And the plan of thJL
healthy clerk with the unflinching- *yeÂ«
and the rnolut* chin was worthy of the
sallow- faced little man with the furtive
look and the great forehead.
"It Is a case of heads I win. tails yea
lose," Rock muttered to him self exultÂ»
tag-iy.
The young- man presented himself forth
with at the office of 'Weddall, Hopkins *
Co., prominent banker* and btttar Â«nÂ«mle*
of John F. Greener and his methods.
They knew Rock as on* of the confidential
clerk* of Brown & Greener, and he had
no difficulty In securing- an audleno* from
Mr. Â¦Weddell-

\J Greener, as he turned away

the board find sÂ«Â« how the mar

much stock there Is for sale and who
has it."
"What's up in it?" asked his partner,
curiously.
"'Nothingâ yet," was Greener's quiet an
swer.
He was a sallow-faced, black-bearded
little man, slender â almost frail looking- â
with a h:gh but rather narrow forehead.
His eyes were furtive, shifty bits of brovrn
lip-ht. He was thinking, and thinking to
some purpose. Any one. even a stranger,
t-Â«eir.p him would have known that he was
thinking of something bisâ the forehead
was responsible for the impression ; and
ei.--o of something tricky, unscrupulous,
cold-bloodedâ his eyes were to blama
there. At length his brow cleared. He
muttered, "I most have that road. Then
a consolidation with my JCeokuk and
Northern, and a new system that will
endure as lor.jr r.s the country!"
Brown returned In a half hour and re
ported. There was very little stock for
pale below Ji? a share. The vendible sup
ply increased at 44. and &t 40 inside stoc'i
would come out. It was thus evident
that the greater part of euch stock of the
Iowa Miaiand as the street was "carry-

Greener squeaked after him: "'Keep thtm

A few minutes tattr the Iowa Midland
"j,osl" on the floor of the Stock Exchange
was surrounded by a dozen puzzled and
apprehensive but gentlemanly brokers.
And still a few minutes '.ater the same
rpot was a sf-cth:ng whirlpool of maniacal
humanity. And all that caused ihe trans
formation was the fact that Mr. Bro'wn

to the Iowa Midland crowd and sold 1000
shares at 42U a^d 42.
Then Mr. Brown had been seen speaking
iritfl W. G. Csxleton in what struck wit
nesses as beirg a more or less agitated
manner, and later Carleton had sauntered
carelessly over to the Iowa Midland pre
cinct, and. after displaying very grreat in
difference about the world in general, but
rcost particularly about the market for
Iowa Midland, had sold tfOO shares to
Bas'ty. the specialist, at Â«*i. Â« 3-S and
Tlr. Brown was now observed to look
about him apprehensively and then bÂ»Â»Kln
to converse with Frai.k J. Pratt; whenâ
upon Pratt, as fast as his fat k-gs would
carry him. hastened to "Iowa Midland"
dnd sold T0OO shares at an average price
of <1. The observant eyes had by this
taken on a new expression â of Indecision;
but when they beheld Mr. Brown anxious
ly beckon to his "particular" friend. Dan
Simpson, and saw shrill-voiced Dan rush
like mad into the increasing crowd and
sell 5000 shares of Iowa Midland, appa
rently regardless of price, the observant
eyes ceased to observe Brown. Activity
T.'as tr*nsfeiTÂ«d to their owners' throat?,
as they thought to emulate Simpson and
the rest of the Brown "whisperees."
It was a confident and yet a mystifying
movement. It became more maddeningly
perplexing when certain brokers, believed
to be "close to the inside." also began to
Ft 11 the stock. Everybody started to do
likewise. Arid everybody asked the same
questionâ "What's the matter?"â and re
ceived an avalanche of answers, all dif
ferent, but ail unfavorable. One man said
it was crop failures, another mentioned
divers kinds of bugs, a third asserted it
was extensive washouts and ruinous land

. It was hard at first, but the. habit of matrimony grows with what it
feeds on, and as he "grew older and tougher Samson became able to even
pity thÂ£- few men whose wives let them run wild unchaperoned and un
chained. 7 -'At last^ accounts he was willing to testify that even the matri
monial muzzle had its advantages. The man who spends the most of hia
time under; his wife's thumb always knows where he is at anv rate.
R. SAMSON T. JONES was Ion* on ideas for the-sub
jugation of women. That is to say, he was unmarried.
You never catch a married man, -unless- he haooens to be
a professional humorist, offering the world any thoughts
on the subject of the predominance of the male bird in
the conjugal coop: He knows. better. It's only the bach
elors who fail to see the joke in the word "obey" in the
marriage! service. But Samson, being unmarried, believed
that man was the natural ruler in affairs domestic; and a ruler he is if
being kept straight for sixteen hours out of the twenty-four has anything to
do with the production of that useful instrument
His idea of the proper adjustment of the matrimonial relation was based
upon the theory that the hand that corrals the shekels is the hand that
rules the world. According to him the male portion of the establishment
should spend the day in thawing out selected ' portions of the â¢ cold, cold
world, while the female contingent should sit quietly at home keeping ooo
eye on the cradle and putting the socks and other equipment of the afore
said male contingent in the dry. dock for repairs and general overhauling. II
he should succeed in getting the landing net under some choice Delilah ha
confidently expected that she would sit at his feet and soak up the words of
wisdom that would exude from his intellectual pores.
The verdict of William the Recent that the activity of woman should bÂ«
confined to the four "ks" of cooking, clothing, children and church suited
him' down to the ground and as far up as he extended- It had never oc
curred to him that William-was more or Jess married himself and really meant
dubs, capital, clothes and calling. Being only a man Samson never
thought that any sensible woman could have a higher aim in life than to fol
low him around with a needle and thread looking for loose buttons, or meelc
ly making a graphic chart of his appetite in OTder, to give the cook her run
ning orders.
At last the day came that comes to most men who are not deaf, dumb
and blind or marooned on a desert island, and he paraded proudly down the
church aisle, accompanied by a bunch of orange blossoms and a long whita
veil inhabited by Mrs. Delilah Jones, nee Robinson. At that stage of tho
game he firmly believed that the nee was an abbreviation of ne plus ultra;
later on he wavered between needy and nefarious. Mrs. Delilah .was fair.
flushed and fascinating, and Samson congratulated himself on having landed
a fish that seemed likely to, make so little objection fo the boat or the fisher
man. v He fondly but foolishly imagined that it was the bait that had done
the business for her. Being only a man, as has been intimated several
times, he never knew until she told him that Delilah was really the fisher
man and that he was the one .who had been landed by hook or by crook.
His sensitive feelings received cruel shock number one when he returned
with Mrs. Delilah from a protracted .visit to the honeymoon and the wife of
his bosom proceeded to lay violent hands on the furniture and fixtures.
wall paper, bric-a-brac and other impediments which he had inflicted on the
flat of his choice. He was informed in honeyed accents that the chairs
would have been quite in their element as part of the equipment of a physical
culture institute,; while the wall' paper was redolent of suggestions of the al
coholic ward. Being new to the matrimonial business, he gasped one or .two
long-distance gasps and then sat down heavily to call the roll of his points
of masculine superiority to see how many of them should be reported as
killed,-)wounded or missing in the engagements. Then he was gently but
firmly 'allowed to discover that he could not have hit upon a more undesir
able location for ; housekeeping in the whol.e city if he had been blind and a
paralytic to boot Furthermore. Mrs. Delilah had never cared for a flat;
nothing less than a ten-room cottage with a yard and a barn and carriage
house' on the 'side would square with her ideas of domestic bliss.
Thisvwas -only the beginning. As she warmed to her work Mrs. Deli
lah proceeded to .lay down a plan of operation for her lord and master that
bore about as much resemblance to his own carefully conceived scheme as a
wheelbarrow to an eighteen horsepower automobile. In Salmon's luxu
riously furnished mind mea always kept a half-Nelson on the^ family purse
and air vouchers -were carefully audited by the male person, Lnder the nevr
regime poor Samson discovered that all he had to do was to pass over his lit
tle yellow envelope with its contents intact every Saturday night and Mrs.
Delilah would do the rest. Barring a rebate of $3 75 for car fare and lunch
there was nothing more to it for Samson. Also he discovered that the riot
ous friends of his sinful youth were distinctly persona non grata to Mrs. De
lilah and that the' presence of tobacco smoke in the window curtains consti
tuted a compound fracture of the laws of domestic, harmony.
* All these* things and many more were impressed upon Samson in the
opening months wherein he; had fully expected to demonstrate his masculine
superiority. He learned that the man who spends coin of the realm for
club f iues when there are new bonnets in the market is beneath the contempt
of all self-respecting citizens. He learned also that there i3 no place in the
married man's section of the hereafter for the sturdy oak who is seen on the
street unaccompanied by his vine after 9 o'clock at night.

I ..was beginning to take an interest in Jim,- so Lbrought him into the

for I knew it wascostine me money that; wasn't .back: "but -every

there, was a fortune Awaiting for me- just around, the corner. "~
Graham's Extract . started out'. by" being something that you could make
beef tea out ofâ that was all. But.before.Jimihad.been fooling .withHt for.
a month he had got his'girl to think.up a hundred different ways in which it
could'be used, and had advertised them all. It seemed there ; was 'nothing
you could cook that didn't need a dash of it He kept -me between a chill
and a sweat i all the , time. / Sometimes, but ', not often, '. I just ; had . to .grin at
his foolishness. I remember , one ' picture* he got out : showing ; sixteen cows
standing : between something ; that ; looked like a letter-press, and tellinjj how
. every pound or so of Graham's Extract ; contained / the . juice , squeezed from
a herd ; of steers. If an explorer started for- the north pole Jim would send
him a case of Extract and then advertise that it was the great heat-maker
for cold climates: and if another fellow, started ; across Africa He sent "him a
case, too, and advertised what a. bully/drink itjwas served up with a little ice.
~ r He broke out in a new place every -day,; and every time Â¦ he . broke out
it ; cost the^ house money. Finally, 1 I made ; up my mind to swallow the loss,
and Mister Jim wasabout to lose;his' job sure enough: when orders for Ex
tract began to look Tup,' and he' gotia ! reprieve; then he began to make ex
penses,*- and hefgot \ a . pardon ; and finally a 1 rush" came" that left him ; high and
dry- in a permanent; place.
Jim was all right, in his way, but it was a new way, and I hadn't been
broad-gauged enough , to ' see that Â¦ it was a better way.
That Â¦ was Vwhere : I [ caught â¢ the ' connection : between - a â¢ college education
and business. I've always made it a rule -to -buy; brains and; I've" learned
now that ; the better , trained they, are i the 1 faster \ they find reasons for getting

mer. By permission of Email, Maynara & Co., PTjJdJsberB, Boston, Mass.
I thought that would settle Jim and let me out. for it's no joke lug
ging beef or rolling barrels and tierces a hundred, yards or so to the car*.
But Jim came right back at me with: "Done. Who'll I Teport to?"
That sporty way of answering, as if dosing a bet, made me surer than
ever that he was not cut out for a butcher. But I told him. and off he start
ed hot-foot to find the foreman. I sent word by another route to see that he
got plenty to do.
I forgot all about Jim until, about three months later, when his name was
handed up to me for a new place and a raise in pay. It seemed he had sort
of abolished his job. After he had been - rolling barrels awhile, and the
sport had ground down one of his shoulders a couple of inches lower than
the other, he got to scheming around for a way to make the work easier,
and he hit on an idea for a sort of overhead railroad system, -by which the
barrels could be swung out of the storerooms and run right along into the
cars, and two or three men do the work of a gang. It was just as I thought
Jim was lazy, but he had put the house in the .way xtl saving so much money
that I couldn't fire him. So I raised his salary and made him assistant
timekeeper and checker.
Jim kept at this for three or four months until his feet began to hurt
him, I guess, and then he was out of a job again. It seems he had heard
something of a new machine for Â¦ registering" the nien, that did away with
most of the timekeepers, except the fellows who watched the machines, and
he kept after the superintendent until he got him to put them in. Of
course he claimed a raise dgain for effecting such a saving, and we just had
to allow &flBH fifiH
Finally, after about a month of this, he wore me down so that I stopped
him one day as he was passing me on the street I thought I'd find out if
he really was so red-hot to work as he pretended to be; besides, I felt that
perhaps I hadn't treated the boy just right, as I had delivered quite a jag
of that wheat to his father myself.
"Hullo, Jim." I called; "do you still want that job?"
"Yes, sir," he answered, quick as lightning.
"Well, I'll tell you how it is, Jim," I said, looking up^o himâ he was
one of those husky, lazy-moving six-footersâ "I don't see any chance in
the office, but I understand they can use another good, strong man in one
of the loading gangs."

I fvfiLVj 1 ner wncat - â¢^ n(^ tne bÂ° y to Â°k a^ l^ e fancy courses and
V trirnmincs at college. The old man was mijjhty proud of
Ub jfriiimtL^Ji Jim. Wanted him to be a literary fellow. But old Dur
ham found out what every one learns who Rets his ambi
tion mixed up with number two redâ that there's a heap of it lying around
loose in the country. The bears did quick work and kept the cash wheat
coming in so lively that one selling day half a dozen of us had to Ret under
the market to keep it from coiner to everlasting smash.
That day made young Jim a candidate for a job. It didn't take him
long to decide that the Lord would attend to keeping up the visible supply
of poetry, and that he had better turn his attention to the stocks of mess
pork. Next morning he was laying for me with a letter of introduction
when I got to the office, and when he found that I wouldn't have a private
secretary at any price he applied for every other position on the premise*
right down to office boy. I told him I was sorry, but "couldn't do any
thing for him then; that we were letting men go, but I'd keep him in mind,
and so on. The fact was I didn't think a fellow with Jim's training would
be much good, anyhow. But Jim hung on â said he'd taken a fancy for the
house and wanted to work for it. Used to call by, about twice a week to
find out if anything had turned up.

ADVEBTISEMEUTS.Another swell ona Is made of chln
rhilla. Just a plain, wee bit of a capÂ«
irtth long floating ends to give length,
jut tha smartness comes from tha lace
;hat peeps out at every opportunity. All
iround the cape it circles and then rlp
>les in - great cascades down the front,
where it is lost In the billows about tha
feet.
For those who affect black there Is the
Persian lamb and tha mora expensive
:>road tall, and when they are well cut
:hey are a source of perfect satisfaction.
CVbile they axe sweet and dainty, there
.s no retting away from the fact that
;rmlne, squirrel and chinchilla soil easily
uid frequently . color a peculiar yellow,
which means frequent trips to tha fur
rier, but fortunately little expense; but
the lamb is Just as good and as fresh
at tha end of a winter as It was in the
beginning, and where the art of economy
must be studied Is a far more satisfac
tory fur to buy. â¢ â¢
But after all sable Is the fur of furs
and is' the only one Jo wear if you have
a long, golden-lined pocketbook. other
wise don't raise your hopes above seal.
A tiny boa. ihat would be considered
skimpy and miserably mean in anything
else, runs into the hundreds of dollars,
and a coat of ordinary length and make
costs well into the thousands. But it is
worth every dollar if the price is not a
necessary and annoying consideration.
The warm browns, blending from one
shade to another, the exquisite texture
and Its wonderful pliability make It one of
the most becoming furs that can ever be
worn.
And there is no danger whatever of its
getting common.* Well, rather not. Where
one In a hundred can* afford seal, one in
a thousand can buy sable, and then more
than likely but a collar and cuffs.
One of the most attractive sable novel
ties is patterned from your great grand
mother's cape, the only exception being
in the collar and tail trimmings. In cut
it is severely plain and rather tight fit
ting about the shoulders, coming about
to the elbow In length, and having the
stole effect in front. In itself it would be
rare because of the fur, but all about It,
tumbling here and there are a multitude
of tails that make It a stunning gar
ment to be worn ; only by a superbly
gowned woman. ' j
Last . winter was decidedly and em-
Ywrsal demand for them. 'In an ooncslv- ;
able furs. In svery possible oolor and In <
all shape* you may find them, and at
almost any price, too, so there really Is :
not a shadow of an excuse for not own- :
Ing one, especially as no chlo costume ,
seems quite complete without its finish*^;
Ing touches. :^
Squirrel is a light, pretty fur for even
ing wear, particularly when its only use
Is to add piquancy. An especially fetch-
Ing stole is fashioned somewhat like an
old fashioned collar, broad and fitted in
ths back, tapering enough, to tha front
to bs gathered Jnto a bright silver clasp
with a fall of soft, yellow lace, and then
widening to some eight or ten Inches and
facing gracefully to tha bottom of tha
skirt; : ' v .'â¢>< :Â¦%--
phatically a white one. BvÂ»rythlng--ftrt>cx,
coat and hatâ ell expressed tha same
tone, but this fall fickla Dams Fashion
has veered about and shown a preference
for soft pinks, baby blue* and dellcata
greens. Instead of the white coat she
,has set her mind and heart on Jackets,
blouses and whatnots of soft, light furs,
and the girl who Is lortunate enough to
possess such a garment finds herself
thrice blessed.
Of all squirrel Is about the cheapest and
the' most effective. Tha soft Russian
blouse, belted with a bit of satin rlbboa
and clasped with a. jeweled buckle, is far
more suitable for all occasions than Is
the white broadcloth. In the afternoon
it Is much less conspicuous; although not
less handsome; it Is Infinitely morÂ» appro
priate with a silk dinner gown, and to all
intents and purposes answers quit* as
well In the late evening.
The girl who wants a blouse entirely for
evening wear can change its appearanos
radically by adding broad revers as4 wida
cuffs of ermine, but as soon as the fur of
royalty is added it is the worst possible
taste to don it beforo 8 o'clock.
Seal always has been and probably at*
ways will be a wonderfully popular fur
on account of its great* durability and its
delightful softness, and besides, it is not
the most expensive by any manner of
means. A staple Jacket, such as is worn
year in and year out. can always bo re
lied upon, and when it rubs and looks
worn it can be made over and over and
will look fresh and new for years.
Finally, when It gets utterly hopeless. It
can be â¢ shipped to London and re-dyed
and there you are again as fit and as fins
as a daisy.
. Pointed* Russian sable Is somewhat of a
novelty, but such an elegant one that
there will never be the slightest danger
cf its ever going out. It is a blended fur
and the tiny white hairs that dot It so
thickly are all put In by hand. Fancy the
time, the labor and the great patience It
tak*es. Hour by hour, month by month
and year in and year out the Russian
peasants sit and stolidly cater to an ldla
whim of capricious women.
Fur fashions are more or less Influenced
by the prevailing. cut of the day and now
and then you may see a swell afternoon
coat of Persian lamb and trimmed with
a contrasting fur, built on the military
effect. Â¦ . .- *;
It Is long and graceful, generally belted
in, although not always, with a bit of
black silk elastic that holds the waist Una
firmly In place.
And, by the way, elastic Is an entirely
new wrinkle. The new buckles that fit
into the curvo of the back are responsible
for it, in a measure, although if you eve;
tried to match fur, especially after It has
been worn a little and changed lta color,
you would appreciate what a blessing la
disguise It really Is. It comes in almost
any width, but generally about three
quarters of an inch is best liked; it fits
snugly and gives a good curve to tha
waist that is often difficult to get In
heavy fur garments and it always af
fords a decided and good contrast.
It goes without saying that boas of
every description are always la demand
and they possess the happy knack of
dressing up a plain tailor suit and making
one feel most comfortable. The great
bear ones, both black and brown, are a
splendid Investment as a good drenching
and a vigorous beating only seem* to do
them good. From early morning until
lato at night, and with all manner of
gowns, they aro appropriate, smart and
warm and they never look as through they
had been a part of your wardrobe a
century ago.
This Is to be a fur winter, and â¢m&mSaily
of the light ones, and have them you
must or be most wofully behind the times.
Bo, mlladl, be absolutely reckless in trim
ming a hat or even a gown, for no
matter how it Is dona, ther* la no
possibility of making a mistake, and therv
la every probability of looking mn"h botÂ»
ter gowned than your next door neighbor.
THE SUNDAY CAM*
FTTR3 are an absolute necessity
these days, that is. If you would pet

the actual warmth, for is this cli
mate they are more of & luxury
than anything else, but for the stunning
effects and the natty touch that they In
variably lend.
The first cloudy day of early fall makes
the smartest of summer frocks look
shabby and it is straightway uppermost
In the mind of every woman who takes
the slightest Interest in being well gown
ed to freshen and brighten up her rusty
wardrobe and make it last until the win
ter styles are fairly fashioned.
If she be wise she will naturally turn
to fur, for it is not only wonderfully be
coming and suitable, but it possesses the
happy faculty of toning down crudities
better than anything else, and reaJly
when you stop to consider all things is
not more expensive than a host of fragile,
perishable frills and furbelows.
J. pood bit of fur. whether It is a boa, a

THE
SMARTEST
OF THE
SMART IN
FURIn this way the big, bluffing engineer
gradually worked Delaroo Into all the se
cret benevolent orders In Medicine Bend
that meant pretty much every one on
earth. ; There arose always, however. In
connection with the Initiations of Delaroo
one hitch; he never seemed quite, to know
whom he wanted to leave his insurance
of their time, dodging first-class trains;
and evening* when they got in from their
runs Delaroo, having nowhere to go, used
to wander, alter supper, to Sampson's.
At Sampson's he would sit In the shade
of the lamp and smoke, while Maje, In his
shirtsleeves, held forth on the benevolent
orders, and one boy crawled through the
bowels of the organ and another pulled
off the table-c|othâ Delaroo always sav
ing the lampâ and a third harassed the
dog, and a fourth stuck pins in a fifthâ
and Martie, sitting on the dim side of the
shade, so the operation would not appear
too glaring, mended at Maje's mammoth
trousers. . . Â»-*'.]'.'
Delaroo would sit and listen to Maje
and watch the heave of the organ with
the boy, and the current of the table
cloth with the lamp, and the quarter in
which the dog was chewing the baby, and
watch Martie's perpetual motion fingers
for a whole evening, and go back to the
boarding-houso without passing a word
with anybody en earth, he was that si
lent
Had he no relations back in the moun
tains? Nobody up in thÂ» Spider country?
No wives or daughters or fathers or
mothers or friends or anything? Delaroo
always shook his head. If they persisted
he shook his head. Maje Sampson, sitting
after supper, would ask. and Martie. when
the dishes were sidetracked, would begin
to sew and listen, and Delaroo, of course,
would listen, but never x>y any chance
would he answer; not even when Maje
tried to explain how it bore on 18 to 1.
He declined to discuss any ratio or to
name any beneficiary whatsoever. The
right honorable recording secretaries
fumed and denounced It as irregular, and
Maje Sampson wore holes in his elbowa
gesticulating, but in tne. matter of dis
tributing hla personal share or the un
earned Increment Delaroo expressed no
preference whatsoever. He paid his doss;
he made his passes; he sat In his place,
what more could be required? If they
put him in a post of honor hÂ« filled It
with a silent dignity. If they set him to
guard the outer, portal he guarded well;
it was perilous rather for a visiting frater
or even a local brother to try getting past
money to. He could go the most compli
cated, catechism without a hitch every
time, for Maje spent weeks on the sidings
drilling him, until It came to naming the
beneficiary; there he stuck. Nobody could
get out of him to whom he wanted his
money to go.
yard nobody would come within a mffe
of him. He set out the boxcar below the
stock pens, cross lots from his house, up
on the hill, and, not being able to get ad
vice from anybody else, went home to
consult Martie.
Though there were a great many women
In Medlcino Bend, Maje Sampson looked
to but one, Martie, the little washed-out
woman up at Sampson'sâ wife, mother,
nurse, cook, slaveâ Martie.
No particular color hair; no particular
color eyes; no particular color gown; no
particular cut to It. A plain bit of a
woman, mother of six boys, large and
small, and wife of a great big. windbag
engineer, big' as three of her by actual
measurement. By the- time Maje had
taken counsel and walked downtown
prominent business men were fending off
his approach- with shotguns. The city
marshal from behind a bomb-proof asked
what he was going to do with his patient,
and Maje retorted he was going to take
him horn*. He wasn't a M. R. W. of T.
nor. a P. S. Q. of W E., but he was a
roundhouse man, and between Maje and
a railroad man, a wiper even, there was
a bond stronger than grip or password
or Jolly business of any kind. The other
things Maje, without realizing it, merely
played at; but as to the railroad layâ if a
railroad man was the right sort he could
borrow anything the . big fellow .had,
money, plug tobacco, pipe, water bottle,
strong bottle, it made no odds what. And,
on the other hand, Maje wouldn't hesitate
to borrow any or all of these things in
return; the "railroad man who got ahead
of Maje Sampson in this respect hid
claims to be considered a past grand in
the business.
The .doughty /engineer lifted and
dragged and hauled I Delaroo home with
him. If ' there was no hospital, Martie
had 'said, no pest house, no nothing, Just
bring- him : home.' They had \ all had .the
smallpox up at Sampson's, except ,<he
baby, and trie doctor had said lately the
baby appeared to ' need something. They
had really everything up at Sampson's
sooner, or later; measles, diphtheria,
croup, everything In earth except money.
And Martie Sampson, with the washing
and mending and scrubbing and cooking,
nursed the outcast wiper through . bis
smallpox. The baby took It, of course, and
Martie nursed the baby through and went
oh just the same as beforeâ washing,
mending, cooking, scrubbing. .Delaroo
when he got well went to firing: Neighbor
offered the Job as a kind of consolation
prize; and he went to firing on the 264 for
Maje Sampson. â¢
It was then that Maje took Delaroo fair
ly in tiand and showed him. the unspeak
able folly of trying . to get through the
world without the comradeship and bene
fits of the B. S. U.'s of XL, and the fraters
of the order of the double-barreled star
of MacDuff. ', Delaroo caught a good deal
of it on the sidings, where they lay most
and hirgs. Prow ilit cab window he
Icoketi . i 14-year-old boy springing
out of a 10-year-old Jacket. Three things
only made Maje tolerable. First, the
number of bene-volent orders he belonged
to; Eecond, Delaroo; third, Martie.
Maje Simpson was a joiner and a slttet
up. He would Join anything on the west
end that had a ritual, a grip or a pass
word, ar.d he. would sit up night after
night with anybody that had a broken
leg or a fever; and If nothing better of
fered. Maje, rather than go to bed, would
tackle a man with the stomach ache.
This kind of took the cuss off; but he
was that peculiar he would sit up all
night with a sick man and next day maka
everybody sick talking the money queb
tionâat least, everybody but Delaroo. If
Delaroo was bored he never showed It.
As long as Maje would talk Delaroo
would listen. That single word was, In
fact, the key to Delaroo; Delaroo was a
listener; for that reason nobody knew
much about him.
He wasn't a railroad man by birth, but
by adoption. Delaroo came from the
mountains; he was just a plain mountain
man. Some said his father was a trap
per; If so, it explained everythingâ the
quiet, the head bent inquiringly forward,
the modest, ur.obtrusiveness of a man
deaf. Of a size and shape nothing re
markable, Delarooâ but a great listener,
for though he looked like a deaf man ha
heard like a dispatcher and saw marvel
ously from out the ends of his silent eyes.
Delaroo for all the world was a trapper.
He came into the service as a round
house sweeper; then Neighbor, after a
long time, put him at wiping. Delaroo
said nothing, but wiped for years and
years, and was in a fair way to become
liked, when, instead, he became one
morning pitted with umbilical vesicles,
and the doctors, with Delaroo's brevity,
said smallpox. The boarding-house keep
er threw him out bodily and at once.
Having no better place to go, Delaroo
wandered into Steve Beyer's saloon, where
he was generally welcome. Steve, how
ever, pointed a hospitable gun at him and
suggested his getting away immediatelT
from the front end of it. Delaroo wei t
from there' to the roundhouse with h> 
umbilicals and asked Neighbor what
man with the smallpox ought to do wltn
it. Neighbor wouldn't run, not even from
the smallpoxâ but he told Delaroo what
it meant. to get the smallpox started in
the roundhouse, and De'laroo wandered
quietly away from the depot grounds, a
pretty sick man then, staggered up the
yards, and crawled stupid into a boxcar
to die without embarrassing anybody.
By some hook or crook, nobody to this
day knows how, that car was switched
on to Maje Sampson's train when it was
made up that day for the West Maybe
it was done as a trick to scare the wlnd
brg engineer. If so, the idea was suc
cessful When the hind .end brakeman
at thÂ« second stop came forward and re
ported a tramp with the smallpox in the
empty boxcar, Majo was angry. But his
curiosity gradually got the upper hand.
This man might be, by some distant
chance, he reflected, a P. Q. w. of A., or
a frattr, or a fellow or a knight or
something likeâ and when they stopped
again to throw off crackers and beer and
catsup, Maje went back and. entered the
infected car like a lion tamer~to try lodge
signals on him. Maje advanced and gave
the countersign. . It was not cordially re
ceived. He tried another and anotherâ
and another; his passes were lost in the
air. The smallpox man appeared totally
unable to come back at Maje with any
thing. He was not only delirious, but by
this time so frightfully broken out that
Maje couldn't have touched a sound spot
with a Masonic signal of distress. Finally
the venturesome engineer walked closer
into the dark corner where the sick man
layâ and, by heaven! It was the Indian
wiper, Delaroo.
When Maje Sampson rot back into the
cab he could not speakâ at least not for
publication. He was tearing mad and
sputtering like a safety. He gathered up
his cushion and a water bottle and a
bottle that . would explode if water
touched it. and crawled with his plunder
Into the boxcar. He straightened Delaroo
up and out and gave him a drink and by
vay of sanitary precaution took one per
sonally, for he himself had never had the
smallpoxâ but once. When he had done
this little for Delaroo he finished his run
and came back to the Bend hauling his
pesthouse boxcar. . The fireman quit the
cab immediately after Maje exposed him
self; the conductor communicated with
him only by signals. The Anderson op
erator wired ahead that Maje Sampson
was bringing back a man with smallpox
on Thirty, and when Maje, bulging out
of the 261 cab, pulled into the division
I.
If you want him. Quick and short, it
would be: whiskers, secret socleties # sta
tistics and plug tobaccoâ the latter most
ly worked up. That was Maje Sampson.
Bluntly, a wind beg: two hundred and
seventy pounds of atmosphere. Up on
benevolent fraternities, up on politics, up
on the money question, up on everything.
The Seven Financial Conspiracies engaged
Maje Sampson's attention pretty continu
ally, and had for him a practical applica
tion: there were never less than seven
conspiracies afoot In Medicine Bend to
make Maje Sampson pay up.
Pay? Indeed, he did pay. He was al
ways paying. It was not a question of
paying. Not at all. It was a question of
paying up, which is different.
The childrenâ they were brickbats. Tow
headed, putty-faced, wash-eyed young
tters cf all sizes and conditions. About
Maje Sampson's children there was but
one distinguishing characteristic: they
were all boys # nothing but boys, and they
tpread all ovtr town. Was there a baby
run over? It was Maje Sampson's. Wai
there a child lost? Maje Sampson's. Was
there a violently large headed, coarse fea
tured, har.g deg, clatteriug sort of a chap
enywHere around? In the street, station,
round house, yards, stock pens? It was a
brickbat, cure, one of Maje Sampson's
brickbat bovs.
The Sampsons were at the end of the
street, and the end of the street was up
the mountain. Maje Sampson's lot
"ralred." as Neighbor put itâ stood on its
bind legs. His house had a startling tum
ble-over arpect as you approached it. The
back end of his lot ran up Into the sheer,
but he marked the line sharply by a kind
of horizontal fence, because the cliff just
above belonged to the corporation that
owned everything else on earth around
Medicine Bend.
Maje Sampson did not propose to let any
grasping corporation encroach on his line*.
bo he built, and added to from time to
time, a cluster of things en the hind end
of his lotâ an eruption of small buildings,
like pimples oh a boys nose, running down
in size from the barn to the last dry
poods box the boys had heaved up the
elope for a doghoure. To add to the
variety, some one of the structures was
always getting away In the wind, and If
anything smaller than a hotel was seen
careening across lots In a Medicine Bend
breeze It was spotted without further in
vestigation as Maje Sampson's. When the
gale abated Joe McBrackcn, who conduct
ed the local dray line, was pretty sure
to be seen with a henhouse or a wood
shed, or something likewise, loaded on his
trucks, headed for Maje Sampson's. Once
the whole lean-to of the house blew off,
but Joe McBrackcn stood ready for any
emergency. He met the maverick addi
tion at the foot of the grade, loaded it
en his house-moving truck, hitched on
four bronchos, crawled inside the struc
ture, and. getting the lines through the
front window, drove up Main street before
the wind had gone down. was photo
graphed in the act, and afterward used

Now a man like Maje wouldn't be likely
to have very much of a run nor very
much of an engine. He had the 2C1, an
old pop bottle with a stack like a tepee

everything else sidetracked Twenty-nine

THE MASTER
BOLD, THRILLING, DARING TO A WONDERFUL DEGREE.
....THE DISPATCHERS STQRY--NEXT SUNDAY....
v : 'l'[ ! FRANK H. SPEARHAN HAS QUITE OUTDONE HIMSELF IN THIS.Carborundum we may consider as a
very satisfactory product for the first
step in the process. The carhon in the
coal has by a single operation been trans,
formed into small granular crystals, dis
colored and impure, but exceedingly hard
and closely akin to the diamond. The
cause of these unsatisfactory features we
have already seen; now the remedy:
Let us suppose, for instance, that a tun
nel or shaft be excavated to a point a
hundred feet below the surface of the
earth, a quantity of the already purffled
carbon (carborundum) be placed at that
point, the necessary wire connections
made, the excavation refilled and the full
force of the electric current turned on
for such time as may be possible, or nec
essary to fuse the carborundum and to
greatly heat the surrounding earth.
Here we would have probably all the
heat necessary, a considerable degree of
pressure, and possibly some months of
tk'me for the process of crystallization.
Who dares sa y that this process, or a
repetition of it, might not result inâdia
monds? G. M. UTTLE.
This of itself is an achievement of no
small proportions.* scientifically consid
ered, but still falls short of success.
Theoretically, it seemed. It should have
produced, the diamond, but practically it
did not. Something Was not as it should
have been. Something in nature's labora
tory was more perfect than man's; some
law necessary to transform the carbon
in the coal to the pure, hard crystal of
the diamond had not been fully complied
with. Perhaps this law can yet be more
accurately interpreted.
First, let tia look at the laws of crys
tallography. Crystals are produced, gen
erally speaking, from a substance more
or less in liquid form, either In state of
fusion or solution, and it 13 well known
that they are greatly affected In stze,
shape and purity by the conditions under
which they are formed. In genera!, large
crystals require more time to form than
small, so that a short period of cooling
or crystallization will result in small
granular crystals. As each substance has
ita own characteristic crystal, it follows
that to be perfect In form It must be- pure.
In order that a crystal be pure It la not
essential that the original "liquid" con
taining it shall be pure. It la always the
tendency of the crystal in forming to ex
clude foreign matter, as will be realized
by those who have observed comparative
ly pure ice upon a muddy pond. There
are two ways by which a pure crystal
may be formed from an Impure source:*
First, by a sufficient lapse of time diirinjf
crystallization to enable all foreign mat
ter to be excluded, which Is nature's way;
second, by successively taking the par
tially purified product of one crystalliza
tion, remelting and recrystalllzing, until
purity Is reached, which Is man's way.
Now by analogy why not apply these
principles to the manufacture of the dia
mond? For nature's great advantage of
unljmlted time why not substitute recrys
tallization?
haps no more daring conception has
taken form and life than the attempt to
subjugate and direct nature's own forces
to the production of one of her greatest
masterpiecesâ the diamond.
By means of the great power plant at
Niagara Fallsâ that magic wand of mod
ern science by which the tremendous
force of gravity is transformed Into elec
tric heat of an Intensity which rivals
even the primal heat of the earthâ was
produced, not the diamond, but the won
derful carborundum, the flrsÂ£ (but arti
ficial) cousin.
IN the realm of science, since thÂ«
golden dream of the ancient alchem
ists first stirred man to probe among
the Innermost secrets of nature, per-
Is the Artificial
Diamond
Possible?

When they turn at Maje Sampson'*
placeâ there's a gate there nowâ Martie
and more or less of the boys and Maje
kind' of Join In along and go over with
them, carrying a basket or so of flowers
and a bucket of water.
The boys soon stray over to where the
crowd is, around the graves of the heroes.
But Martie gets down by a grave some

all up loose with an old caseknife. You
would think she might be kneading bread
there, the way she sways under her sun

Bend. Decoration day tnere Is an attempt
at a turnoutâ a little speeching and a lit
tle marchingâ a thin, straggling column
of tha same warped, bent old fellows in
the same faded old blue. Up the hill they
go and around to the cemetery to deco
rate.
They buried Delaroo. But even* then
they were not through with him. Dela
roo had Insurance In every order In the
Bend, which meant almost 'every one on
earth. There was no end to his benefit
certificates, and no known beneficiaries.
But when they overhauled his trunk tho
found every last certificate filed away up
to the last paid assessment and the last
quarter's dues. Then came a shock. Peo
ple found out that there was a bene
ficiary. While the fraters were busy
making their passes Delaroo had quietly
been directing the right honorable re
cording secretaries to make tho benefits
run to Neighbor, and so every dollar of
his Insurance ran. Nobody was more
thunderstruck than the master mechanic
himself.
Yet Delaroo meant something â¢ by It.
After Neighbor had studied over It nights
the best of a month; after Maje Sampson
had tried to take the color test and failed,
as he persistently said he would; after
he had gone to tinkering in the round
house and from tinkering respectably
and ' by degrees down the hill to wiping
at a dollar and forty cents a day with
time and a half for overtimeâ Neighbor
bethought himself all of a sudden one
day of a paper Delaroo had once given
him and asked him to keep. .
He had put it away in the storekeeper's
safe with his own papers and the draw
ings of his extension front end patentâ
and safely forgotten all about it. It was
the day they had to go into the county
court about the will that w'as not, when
he recollected Delaroo's paper and pulled
it out of its envelope. There was only
a half sheet of paper, inside, with this
writing from Delaroo to Neighbor:
R. B. A.â What is coming to me on en
surance give to Marty Sampson, wife of
Maje. Give my trunk to P. McGraw.
, Rispk.. P. De LA ROUX.
When the master mechanic read that
before the probate judge Maje Sampson
took a-trembling, Martie hid her face in
her shawl, crying again. Maybe a glim
mer of what It meant came for the first
time in her life over her. Maybe shff re
membered Delaroo as he used to sit with
them under the kerosene lamp while Maje
untiringly pounded the money question
into himâ smoking as he listened, and
Martie mended on never-ending trousers.
Looking from Maje Sampson, heated with
monologue, to his wife, patiently stitch
ing. No comments; Just looking as Pierre
Delaroux could look.
Strange, Neighbor thought it, and yet
maybe not so strange. It was all there in
the paperâ the torn, worn little book of
Delaroo's life. She was the only woman
on earth that had ever done him a kind
ness.
\ Nobody at Medicine Bend quite under*
stood It; but nobody at Medicine Bend
quite suspected that under all the bar
renness up at Maje Sampson's an ambi
tion could have survived; yet one" had.
Martie had an, ambition. Way down un
der her faded eyes and her faded dress
there was an. ambition, and that for the
least promising subjects in the Rocky
Mountainsâ the brickbats. Under the un
ending mending and the poverty and the
toll Martie, who. never put her nose .out
of doors, who never attended a church so
cial, naver ventured even to a free public
school showâ had an ambition for <he
bo>'s. She wanted the two biggest to go
to the State Universityâ wanted them to
go and get an education. And they went;
and Maje Sampson says them boys, ary
one, has forgotten more about the money
question than he ever knew. It looks as
if after all the brickbats might come' out
âa bit of money in Martle's hands goes so
far. .
There are a few soldiers buried at' the
"It wouldn't worry ine so much If it
wasn't f'r the family, Neighbor. The
woman â and the, boys. I ain't much a
savin'; you know that. If you can gi' me
a job I can get bread an' butter out of,
give It to me/ I can't pull a train; my
eyes went out with this man here. I wish
to God It was me, and him standing over.
A man that's color blind, and don't know
a thing on God's earth but runnln' an en
gine, Is wos'n a dead roan."
Neighbor went home thinking.
"True as God's word. You might as
well know It now. There's a man that
stood between me and the loss of my Job.
It's been coming on me for two year. He
knew it, that's why he stayed in my cab.
He stayed because I was color blind. He
knowed I'd git ketched the minute a new
fireman come In, Neighbor. He watched
the' signalsâ Delaroo. I'm color blind,
God help me." Maje Sampson sat down
by the coffin. Martie hushed her crying;
the three sat in the darkness. J
- â r
up. But now his day was as one that Is
darkened. When Neighbor went up next
night to see about some minor matters
connected with the funeral and tha pre
cedence of the various dozen orders that
were to march he found Maje Sampson
and Martie alone in the darkness of the
parlor with the silent Delaroo.
Maje turned to the master mechanic
from where Delaroo lay. "Neighbor, you
might as well know It now as any time.
Don't you say so, Martie? Martie, what
do you say?" Martie burst Into tears;
but through them Neighbor caught the
engineer's broken confession. "Neighbor
âI'm color blind." . The master mechanic
sat stunned.
It was November and great weather for
running, and when the rails were riot
springing under the soldiers west-bound
they were humming under the steers east
bound. Maje Sampson, with his beer kegs
and his crackers and his 264 and his be
knighted fireman, hugged the sidings
pretty close that week. Some of the
trains had part of the rights and others
had the remainder. The 264 and her train
took what was left, which threw Maje
Sampson most of the time on the worn
out, run-down scrap rails that make cor
duroy roads of the passing tracks. Then
.came the night, that Moulton, the Philip
pine commandant, went through on his
special. With his staff and his baggage
and his correspondents and; that kind he
took one whole train. Syme Crowley
pulled them, with Ben Shearer conductor,
and, whatever else may be said of that
pair, they deliver their trains on time.
Maje Sampson left Medicine Bend with
Twenty-nine at noon on his regular run
and tried to get west. But between the
soldiers behind him and the steers against
him he soon lost every visionary right he
ever did possess. They laid him out
nearly every mile of the way- to the end
of the run. At Sugar Buttes they -held
him thirty minutes for the Moulton spe
cial to pass, and, to crown his indignities,
kept him there fifteen minutes more wait-
Ing for an east-bound sheep train. Samp
son afterward claimed that Barnes Tracy,
the dispatcher that did it, was a gold
Democrat, but this never was proved.
It was nearing dark when the crew of
local freight Twenty-nine neard the dull
roar of the Moulton special speeding
through the canyon of the Rat. A pas
senger train running through the canyon
at night comes through with the far roll
of a thousand drums, deepening into a
rumble of thunder. Then out and over all
comes the threatening purr of the strain
ing engine breaking into a storm of ex
hausts, until, like a rocket, the headlight
bursts streaming from tho black wall,
and Moore on the 811 or Mullen with the
818, or Hawksworth In the 1110, tear with
a fury of alkali arid a : sweep of noise over,
the Butte . switch, past caboose and' flats
and boxes and the 264 like fading light.
Just a sweep of darkened glass and dead
varnish, a whirl of smoking trucks beat-

Twenty-nine, local, was used to all this.
Used to, the vanishing tall lights, the
measured, sinking of the sullen dust, the
silence brooding again over the desert
with,' this "night, fllteen ( minutes more to
walt'for the east-bound stock train before
they dared open the switch. Maje Samp
son killed the time by going back to the
caboose' to talk equities with the conduc
tor. It was no trick for him to put away
fifteen minutes discussing the rights of
inan with himself; aud with "an angel of
a fireman to watch the cab why not?
The 264 standing on the side was chewing
her cud as sweet as an old cow, with may
be a hundred and forty pounds of steam
to the right of the dial, maybe a hundred
and fiftyâ I say may be, because no one
but Delaroo ever knew-when the sheep

Bo the MaJÂ« Sampson combination, but
quite as brassy as though It' had rights
of the 'first class, dodged the big fellows
up and down the line pretty successfully
until the Government began pushing
troops Into the Phillppines.and there came
days when a Rocky Mountain sheep could
hardly have kept out of the way of the
extras that tore, hissing and booming
over the mountains for Frisco. For a
time the traffic came hot; so hot we were
pressed to handla It. There wa*' a good
bit of skirmishing on the part of the pas-;
senger department to get the business,
and then tremulous skirmishing in the
operating department to deliver the goods.
Every brokendown coach In the backyards
was scrubbed up for the soldier trains..
We aimed to kill Just as few as possible
of the boys en route to the islands,
though that may have been a mistaken
mercy. However, we handled them well;
not a man in khaki got away from us in
a wreck, and In the height of the push
we put more livestock into South Omaha,
ear for car, than has ever gone in before
or since.
At dawn hot coffee was passed among
the wreckers, and shortly , after sunrise
the McCloud gang arrived with the sec
ond derrick. Then the men of the night
took hold with a new grip to get Into the
heart of the pile; to findâ If he was thereâ
Delaroo. ' , ,- -;
â¢ None of the McCloud gang knew the
man they were hunting for, but the men
from the Bend were soon telling them
about Maje Sampson's Indian. 'Not a
mute nod ' he ever gave; not a piece of
tobacco he ever passed; not a brief word
he ever spoke to one of the battered old
hulks who rode and cut and slashed and
stormed and drank and cursed with
Benedict Morgan was forgotten then.
Every slewed, twisted, weather-beaten,
ciippled-up, gin-shivered old wreck of a
wrecker^-they were hard menâ had some
thing to say about Delaroo. And with
their hair matted and their faces streaked
and their shirts daubed and their elbows
in blood, they said ftâ whatever it was.
much or littleâ of Delaroo.
The picks swung, the derricks creaked,
and all day/ with the heaving and the
calling they tolled; but the sun was sink
ing before they got to the middle of it.
Then Benedict Morgan, crawling under
the drivers of the hind mogul, partly un
covered, edjred out with a Bet face: he
swore he heard breathing. It was 'alcohol
to the veins of the double gang. Neighbor
himself went in and heardâ and stayed to
fasten a grapple to pull" the engine truck
off the roof of a box car that was Jammed
over and against the" mogul stack.
The b!gr derrick groaned as "the slack
drew and the truck crashed through a
tier of stays and swung whirling into the
clear. A giant wrecker dodged the sus
pended wheels and raising an ax bit a
hole Into the jammed roof. Through that
they passed a second grapple, and pres
ently it gave sullenly, toppled back with
a crash, and the foremost axman. peering
into the openlne, saw the heart of the
wreck. Bending forward he picked up
something struggling in h'is arms. They
thought it was a man; but it was a sheep,
alive and uninjured under all the hprror:
that was the breathing they heard. Bene
dict Morgan threw, the man and his bur
den aside and stepped himself into the
gap and. through. One started to follow,
but the chief of the wreckers waved him
back. Close by where the sheep had been
freed stood Delaroo. He stood as if with
ear alert, so closely did the counterfeit
seem the real. So sure was the impres
sion of life that not until Morgan, speak
ing to the fireman, put his hand on his
shoulder did he realize that the "Indian
stood quite dead Just where'the shock had
caught him In bis cab.
Stumbling: over â¢ the wreckage . they
passed. him"' in the, silence of the sunset
from hand to hand into" the open. A big
fellow, pallid and; scared, tottered after
them and when they laid the dead man
down, half fell at his side; it was Maje
Sampson. / ; .
It surprised everybody the way Maje
Sampson \w en t to pieces after Delaroo
was killed. The Indian was carried back
to the Bend; and up to ; Sampson's and
laid out-In" the God- fdrsaken parlor; but
Maje wasn't' any good fixing things up
that Â« time. r He usually shone on like oc
casions. Ha was the comforter of the
afflicted to : an extraordinary degree: he
gave the usual mourner no chance to let
men testifiedâ but however or whatever
it wasâ whether tho Moulton special frac
tured the tongue or whether the pony of^
the lead engine flew the guard, or whether
the switch had been opened, or whether/
In dosing, the slip rail had somehow
failed to follow the rodâ the double-headed
stocker went Into that Butts switch, into
that Butte siding, into the peaceable old
2M and the Twenty^nlne. local, like a lyd
dite shell, crashing, rearing, ripping,
scattering two whole trains into blood
and scrap. Destruction, madness, throes,
death, silence; then a pyre of dirty smoka,
a wail of sickening: bleats, and a scream
of hissing 8tÂ«am over a thousand sheep
caught in the sudden shambles.
There was frightened crawling out of
the shattered cabooses, a hurrying up of
the stunned crews, and .a bewildering
count of heads. Both engine crews of
the stock train had Jumped as their train
split the switch. The train crews were
badly shaken; the head brakeman of the
sheep train lay torn In the barbed wire
fencing- the right of way; but only ona
pan was missingâ the fireman of Twenty
nineâDelaroo. .
. "Second 86 Jumped west switch passing
track and went into train 29, engine 264.
Bad spill. Delaroo, fireman the 264, miss
ing," wired Sugar Buttes to Medicine
Bend a few minutes later. Â¦
Neighbor got there by 10 o'clock with
both roadmasters and the wrecking outfit.
It was dark as a canyon on the desert that
night. .Benedict Morgan's men tore
splintered car timber from- the debris, and
on the knolls back of the siding lighted
heaping bonfires that threw a light all
night on the dread pile smoking on the
desert They dug by the flame of the fires
at the ghastly heap till midnight; then
the moon rose, an extra crew arrived from
the Bend, and then they got the derrick
at work. Yet with all the toil when day
broke the confusion looked worse con
founded. The main line was so hopelessly
blocked that at daylight a special with
ties and steel was run in to lay a tempor
| ary track around the wreck.
"What do I think of it?" muttered
Neighbor, when the local operator asked
him for a report for Callahan. "I think
there's two engines for the scrap in eight
âand the 264, if we can ever find any
thing of herâ and about a million sheep to
pay forâ" Neighbor paused to give an
order and survey the frightful scene.
"And Delaroo " repeated the operator.
"He wants to know about Delaroo-: â "
"Missing." :v*>^

house. Neighbor began to hold him up
as a model for the division, and the boys
found that the way to Jolly Neighbor was
to say nice things about Delaroo. The
head of the motive power would brighten
out of a eulk at the mention of Delaroo's
came, end he finally fixed up a surprise
for the Indian man. One night after De
laroo came In Neighbor, In the bluff way
he liked to use In promoting a man, told
Delaroo he could havÂ« an engine; a good
one, one of the K class; as much finer a
machine than the old 264 '.as Duffy's
chronometer was than a prize package
watch. Delaroo never said aye, yes or no;
be merely listened. Neighbor never had
a promotion received In Just that way; it
nearly cave him the apoplexy.
But If Delaroo treated the proposal
coolly, not so Maje Sampson; when the
newi of the offer reached him. Maje
went Into an unaccountable flutter. He
acted at first exactly as If ha wanted to
hold hi* man back, which was dead
against cab ethics. Finally he assented,
but his cheeks went flabby and his eyes
hollow, and he showed more worry than
.his creditors. Nobody understood It, yet
there was evidently something on, and the
Major's anxiety increased until Delaroo,
the Indian fireman and knight companion
of the Ancient Order of Druids and
Fluids, completely took Neighbor's breath
by declining the new engine. That was a
West End wonder. He said if It made no
odds he would stay on the 264. The men
all wondered;, then something: new came
. up and the thins was Â¦ forgotten. Maje
Sampson's cheeks filled out again, he re
gained his usual nerve, and swore on the
~ money question harder than ever..^ .
After that it was pretty generally : un
derstood that Delaroo and Maje Samp
eon and tho 264 were fixtures. Neighbor
never gave any one a chance to decline
an engine mere than once. The, boys all
knew, If Delaroo . didn't, that he would
be firing a lone time* after throwing that
chance by; and he was.
The combination came to be regarded
as eternal. When the sloppy 264 hove In
eight, little Delaroo and big Majo Samp
eon were known to be behind the boiler
pounding up and down the mountains, tip
and down, year in and year out. Big en
gines came Into the division and bigper.
All the time the division was crowding
on the motive power and putting in the
mammoth types, until when the 264 was
stalled alongside a consolidated, or a mo

truly artistic significance, "could be $5000
a year. I have been getting Just one-half
of that" His salary was exactly $1600;
but why minimize one's commercial
value?
The old banker walked up and down.
"By gad, sir, you, shall - have our
proxies," said Mr. Weddell at length.
Weddell, Hopkins & Co. held 14,000
shares of Iowa Midland stock, and on the
next day Rock received their proxies.
Coming from so well known, so notor
iously anti-Greener a house, they served
as credentials to him, and he was able to
convince many doubting Thomases. He
secured proxies from practically all the
anti-Greener stock held In the city, as
well as In Philadelphia and Boston.
All told, the proxies he had secured
from Mr. Greener's friends and from his
foes amounted' to 61,830 shares. It was
really a remarkable performance. He felt
very proud of It As to consequences he
had carefully weighed them. , He was
bound to succeed, on whichever side the
coin came down.
Mr. Greener called him into his private
office.
"Mr. Rock, how about those Iowa Mid
land proxies?"
"I have them safe," answered the clerk,
a bit defiantly.
"How many?" .'.-Â¦â¢

"Yes," admitted Mr. Greener, meekly.

make important reforms. My reward is to

backing of Weddell. Hopkins & Co.
"I'll do as much and give you $20,000 In
cash," said' Mr. Greener, quietly.
."No. I want to Join the New York
Stock Exchange. I want you to buy me a
seat, and I want you to give me some of
your business. And I want you to lend
me $E0.0OO on my note."
"Mr. Greener, you know what I can
do ; and I know what the absolute con
trol of the Iowa Midland means to you.
And I want to be your broker. I'll serve
you faithfully, Mr. Greener."
"Rock," squeaked Mr. Greener, '.'shake

about this. I'll. buy you a seat and I'll

shall have Just as soon as It . can be
bought. My interests shall be your Inter
ests in the future."
"I've : made ' all the necessary arrange
ments. I can buy the seat at a moment's
notice," said Rock, calmly, though his
heart was beating wildly for sheer Joy of
victory. "It will cost $23,000."
"Tell Mr. Simpson to make out my per
sonal check for $25,000," piped the Na
poleon of the Street, almost cordially.
"Th- thank you, very much, Mr. Green

"Oh, that's all right," Interrupted Mr.
John F. Greener. VYou'U go to Des

I've long wanted a man like you. But.
Rock, nowadays young men are either

plaintive squeak. r

squeak.
"We may as well have an understand

Greener." Rock's eyes eld not leave tho
sallow face of the great railroad wrecker.
He knew he had crossed the Rubicon. He
was fighting for his future, for the.suc
cess he had dreamed of. And he was
fighting a giant of giants/ All this the
clerk thought: and the thought braced
him wonderfully.
"What* do /you mean?" squeaked Mr.
Greener, naively.
Mr. Brown entered. He was Just in
time to hear the clerk say.: . "You have,
all told. 110,000 shares of Iowa Midland.
President Wllletts and his crowd con
trol about the same amount."
"Yes," said the sallow-faced little man.
His forehead was moistâ barely moistâ
.with perspiration, but his face was ex
pressionless. His eyes were less furtive;
tl<at was all.
"Well, some of the proxies stand In the

And Bill turned on more power. They
swung round the last corner before reach

sound greeted their ears, mingled with
shouts and screams. It was all over in a
secondâ the runaways, attached to the
heavy dray, dashed straight Into the am

air. Dr. James felt a blow somewhere,
there was an instant of blankness, then

toward the sidewalk with that deathlike

The thoroughly frightened woman re
plied, stammeringly: "Working, sir; we
don't know much about her, sir. She's
seen better days, but she tries awful
hard."
Would that elevator never reach the
ground floor? And was that hospital at
the other end of the city? Every minute
was precious now. He leaned toward the
driver.
He covered her face. The gaping crowd
should not see her. As they passed out
to the elevator he still grasped the wrist
of the forewoman.
"What Is she doing here?"
Dr. James leaned back moodily, and
the ambulance swung round a corner,
then stopped before the entrance of a
high factory building. A policeman stood
guard at the door.
"Right up the elevator. Doc. Pretty
nasty case, I guess. They've been work-
Ing over her quite a bit"
"And doing the worst things possible,
I suppose," growled the young medical
man, as he stepped into the elevator. The
driver and policeman followed with the
stretcher. Up they shot, past floor after

sounded like the emphasized waves of

pitiless sunlight shot across the floor and
rested on the deathlike face. The police

In time to hear a groan, which came not
from the patient, but from the young
doctor.. He turned as white as his new

went to work with lips set grimly and

"How long has she been like this?"
"Half an hour," faltered the fore

Issued some sharp orders to his assist

"By ginger, but what a heroine," laugh

He understood the situation. He knew
that she was alone and ready to be scaied
Into a fit, but was making a brave bluff
against her womanly weakness. There
was a strain of chivalry In his composi

When he had disappeared down the
road Miss Sadie congratulated herself

of the veranda to look for a mad dog.
Aunt Deborau had said a mad dog
would come next. There was a slip
somewhere, however, for It was a robber
that showed- up about forty minutes after
the tramp's broad back had become only
a dot against the sky line. The robber
came from the west, walking In the mid

barn, a few rods below the house, he
turned In and was quickly lost to sight

"But Is there a loaded gun?" asked
Sadie, as she slightly shivered at the
thought.
"I guess that old gun behind the closet
door in my bedroom has been loaded for
the last ten years. Uncle Ellsha kept It
loaded for owls before he died. Don't
shoot a robber unless he comes to rob and

That Miss Sadie Davis was not a queer

the house as a summer boarder. He took
advantage of circumstances to woo aa.l

He lurched and staggered, and col
lapsed, and Sadie let the gun fall to the
floor and bent over him. It wasn't a
minute before she discovered that he was
burning with fever and shaking with a
chill at the same time, and all further
thoughts ,of robbers and shooting were
driven from her head. She brought him
water and later on stopped a farmer driv
ing by and got help to move the stranger
to the house and put him to bed.
"He's no tramp." said the country doc

"Yes? Well. I don't care much."
Sadie waited with beating heart for tea
minutes to see If he intended to advanca
Â¦upon the house from the barn and take
her by surprise; but as time went oa aha
made up her mind that he had com* to
steal hay or straw Instead of household
effects. He must be driven away Ju#t thÂ«
same, and she was the only one to drive)
him. Aunt Deborah depended upon her.
It was another ten minutes before the
girl could work up courage enough to
go In after the old shotgun and drag it
forth by its muzzle. But once armed, Â«hÂ«
felt braver and made her way Along the
path to the barn, whose doors stood wide
open to the summer wind and sunshine.
She approached them cautiously, fesxlns;
that the stranger was In ambush and
ready to spring forth; but as she finally
stood and looked Into the barn, she was
considerably relieved to find the maa

California did not lack for political ora

was'more arduous then than now. There
was not a railroad in the State except the

Henry Edgerton was one of the most
brilliant orators and most fascinating
men that ever delighted public audiences
in the Golden State. His voice in public
speech was magnetic, his presence im
posing,' his manner modest, ' and his
matter original. In the art of ridi
culing an opponent he had no superior,
"The gentleman observes," said Edger
ton in the course of a legislative debate,
"that he fears no man who, like himself,
is of woman born. He exalts himself un
duly. He is endeavoring to obtain credit
for manhood under false pretenses. He is
not the offspring of a woman; he was
born of a brass foundry." Of an editor
who slandered him, Edgerton 'said: "He
lies by day and he lies by night, and he
lies for the very lust of lying." Of the
speech in a secession convention of a dis
tinguished San Francisco lawyer of dark
complexion, curly hair, and Hebraic fea

I have canvassed California fourteen
times and have no regrets, for having
given so much time and effort to service
that was uncompensated with money, for
"the song in the hinging of It" and "tha
deed in the doing of It" bring their own
reward. I have read reports at various
times of large sums alleged to have been
paid me for political speeches. I regret
that these stories were not true. Usually
traveling expenses -Jiave been allowed.
Sometimes I have defrayed these myself.
Only once did I receive anything like a
large compensation. That was In 1S3OÂ»
when, weary of politics and Its disap
pointments, and In order to rid myself of
the Importunities of a persistent member
of the State Committee. I named $5000 as
the price of my services for ten speeches.
To my astonishment the committeeman

traveled with Senator Stanford and did
my best for the cause and for him, but
honestly, I do not think that I earned the
money. I learned afterward from Sena-,
tor Stanford's testimony before the San

expenses that the committeeman who
acted as my walking delegate collected
$10,000 from the Senator for my services.

The death of Senator Broderick at the
hands of Judge Terry the previous year
was still a topic of public and private dis
cussion. At this day I am inclined to the
opinion that the duel between these gen
tlemen was not conducted unfairly, but
such was not the opinion of many of the
friends of Senator Broderick in 1SS0, and
the tpeaier, whether' Republican or Dem
ocrat, who was most affluent in the use
of vituperative English in speaking of
the affxir was likely to receive the largest
nuasurt of applause.
Carried away by the enthusiasm of the
occasion, and unmindful of the adage
which classes the intellectual status of
those who rush in where angels fear to
tread, my remarks concerning the gen
tleman who acted as second for Judge
Terry on that occasion were more pun
gent than parliamentary.
Eariy next morning I received a visit
In my bedroom at the hotel where I was
stopping from two members of the State
Committee of my party.
"Have you received any challenge from
Calhoun Ber.ham on account of your
epeech last night?" said one of the com
mittee. "Why. no." I replied, wondering
ly. "Do they usually send challenges
hÂ«re before breakfast to a man to fight
because of references to a public matter,
made in a public speech the night be
fore?" "Sometimes," replied the other
committeeman. "but I do not think you
will be troubled in that way. They know
that you are a Northern man, and they
will assume that you do not recognize
the code. They will probably In your case
make it a street attack."

tained among her passengers sev
eral returning delegates from the
national political conventions, and in the
â¢muking-room and on the promenade deck
political discussion ran high. A
eyed and wooden-legged schoolmaster en
route fur Oregon challenged me to discuss
the political issues of the day. I probably
knew as little about them as he did, but
I accepted his challenge ar.d made my
first public speech on the forward deck of
the eteamer. One of my auditors chanced
to be a member of the State Central Com
mittee of his party, and after we reached
San Francisco this gentleman arranged a
meeting at Plan's Hall, which I accepted
his Invitation to address.
There was no Republican newspaper
then in Butte County, and the posters an
nouncing the meeting were printed at the
office of the Democratic county organ,
and either through accident or with
malice prepense the abbreviation of Thos.
for Thomas In my name was divided by
an unnecessary period and printed as "T.
Hoa. Fitch." "Fellow citizens," said the
chairman, "we have with us a distin
guished orator, lately from Wisconsinâ
the right Hon. T. Hos Fitch. Though
young In years he was one of the editors
of the Milwaukee Free Democrat, and he
had written many scurrilous aTtlc'.es in
favor of the Republican party. He Is
well named. When you have heard him
you will conclude that he is not only a
hoss, but a whole team. He spoke the
other night at Orovllle, and never, never
before in all my life, did I listen to such
a magnificent collection of platitudes."
I. was not troubled, however, either by
a challenge or a street attacK Under
the auspices of the State Central Com
mittee I made sixty-two speeches, mostly
in the mountain counties. The Democrats
in California were eaually divided be
tween those who supported Breckinrldge
and those who supported Douglas, tho
first being designated in the political or
gun of the day as the "chivalry," and
the latter as the "Shovelry." Gilbert A.
Grant, who managed the Republican State
committee, declared that there were- two
kinds of Democratsâ those who threaten**!
to shoot the top of your head off and
those who promised to knock tho stuffing
out of you. It was this same gentlemen
who was appealed to by his colleagues to
co-operate with them in removing from
the Republican electoral ticket a nominee
who had been indicted in Michigan for
horsesteallng. "Keep him on," growled
Grant. "Keep him on, he will strengthen
the ticket. Half of his constituents have
taken horses."
I shall never forget my introduction to
an audience at Chlco. now a flourishing
city, but then a collection of a few houses
and' shops about Bidwell's mill. The
meeting was hfld in the afternoon and
was attended by hundreds of farmers,
some of whom had come many miles for
that purpose.

"I think," remarked the other committee
man, "that at close quarters you will find
this more useful â " and he pulled from his
pocket a long, glittering, ivory handled
bowie knife, and laid it upon the bed
alongside the pistols.
For a moment I suspected my callers of
indulging in a practical Joke at my ex
pense, but a look at their faces, convinced
me that they were in dead earnest. Nev
ertheless the ridiculous side of this "wel
come to California" struck me keenly,
and 1. could not help laughing as I replied:

And his heart was filled with gratitude when he finally set about
To reach beyond the waters deep and claim the dreamed-of lands.
Wherein were fabulous riches from the hills down to the sands. '
"How shall we reach this land of dreams?' the King in time did ask,
And it was plain he could not see a way to perform the task.
"Leave all to me, O King of mine," old Grandpa grandly said,
"And if I do not find the place we seek you may have my head."
The monarch Blapped him on the back and spoke in earnest tone:
"I ne'er have seen such confidence and such a firm backbone." Tlf'-M

Grandpa went to the golden beach in time to see a squall.
He had planned to go exploring in tubs of stanchest make,
But the sight of the sea so angry made him fear and quake.
"Ill have to change my plans'," he said, "for we cannot go to sea,
While its bosom is so much disturbed by such wild revelry."
To a shady nook he hied himself, where he could think alone,
And when he showed himself again his face with brightness shone.
"I have a plan," he shouted loudâ "a plan that's best of all!
"We'll build a tunnel long and strong and thus escape the squali.
"Your brilliance, subject good of mine," the monarch proudly said,
"Ne'er has seen its equal in the realm of which I'm head.'V
Cheers that rang far out to sea went up for Grandpa Prune,
Who, spurred by this approval, was busy very soon.
Crab Apple and Old Turnip surveyed along the beach, â¢â¢ .
And the former stood on the latter's back because of his short reach.
Tiny Willie Straw Berry was appointed water boy,
And while he-took his pail about he showed the greatest Joy. _ r
Old Onion carried the heaviest stones because he was so strong,
And our- old. friends 'Squash and Carrot shouldered timbers long.
Happy Pat. Potato gave up his helmet, star and mace
And used a pick so vigorously that drops fell from his face. f-y'-
One of the ablest, workers 'was lovable Bartlett Pear, :||||
Who wheeled the barrow here and there and -almost everywhere.
Dill Pickle carried all the bricks and did his work real well,
And the earnest little Pepper had charge of the dinner bell.
Old Water Melon worked an hour and then said that he .was ill,
But Old Grandpa Prune was very mad and wouldn't pay his bill
The, big old fellow stood near by and smoked a big cigar,
Atid because of this there was some talk of feathers, fire and tar.
It was not long, my sweets, until the tunnel was well started,
And the King, who stood upon the land, was from his subjects parted.
For many a "day the workers dug beneath the waters deep,
A,wi t'vÂ» hrxrA it tnlrt that not one cave a moment up to sleep.
The progress at times was fast and at other times 'twas slow.
And once or twice discouragement in some began to show.

When the land of dreams should come to view and give to all. great cheer*
On the morn of the fortieth day great terror came to all,
And for once the brave old Grandpa Prone felt courage growing Â«r"*n.
A thousand miles away from home the last light flickered out!
And left the willing workers to grope hopelessly about.
"1 do not see what we can do but to do the best we can,"
Said Grandpa Prune in manner calm, for he knew not what 1 to plan. *

Many avenues were made beneath the home of the speckled bass.

Wherein in after years, my sweets, he gained his great renown.
A crowd of Peaches dug southwest; and they did not badly fare,
For some came up in Michigan and some in Delaware.

Tiny Straw Berry dug his way to a beautiful patch of sand .

XEW YORK. Oct. 17.-After a month's
treatment by the application of the X
rays. Miss Elsie Winkler, 16 years of age,
has been relieved of semi-dally attacks
of epilepsy and her complete recovery
seems almost certain. Miss Wlnkler's
case, presented at the clinics of the Post
Graduate Hospital, has been the object
of much inquiry from physicians Inter
ested in electro therapeutics.
From; a condition where she suffered
attacks on an average of .two each day
with accompanying physical exhaustion
Miss Winkler is now ruddy cheeked and
vivacious and declares she is cured.
"I would be glad to discuss the mat
ter," said, her physician, "were it not for
the fact that before long I intend to pre
sent thÂ« record of her case with those
of about twenty others before my col
leagues for their criticism. I would rather
accept the truths left after the most rigid
investigation. As it is I can hardly be
lieve what I have myself seen of the re
sults of the application of X-rays to epi
leptic patients."
From other sources it was learned that
â¢the majority of cases, treated have re
sponded to the application equally well.
A worklngman who was subject to four
convulsions a day has been treated only
a few weeks and is about . to return to
his work, from which by epileptic attacks
he has been prohibited . for, two j years.
If it is demonstrated that: the discovery
by Dr. Brant effects permanent cures in
this disease, which hitherto has been be
lieved to be Incurable,' there will 'be added
epilepsy to epithelioma, , lupus and sev
eral other diseases which have been made
curable through the agency. of the X-rays."

Whether or not Wickes will again enter
the Cook County divorce courts, with his
fourth wife aa an opponent, will depend
largely upon the decision of his attorney,
William Burry, who arrived from New
York to-day.
Attorney Frederick L,. Devine and Con
stable Frank McDonald were the- two who
rescued Mrs. Wickes and her wearing
apparel from the Drexel boulevard resi
dence last week.. Attorney A. S. Trude,
whose family home Is; opposite the
Wickes 1iome on Drexel boulevard, la
watching Mrs. Wickes' interests if di
vorce proceedings develop.
Mrs. Wickes stoutly maintains that she
has been a virtual prisoner. In her home
for the past six months. Though every
luxury ' which money could supply sur
rounded her and she had servants to obey
every beck and call, she asserts that she
was as effectually cut ofT from the world
as If the windows of the gray stone paJ
ace were latticed with Iron bars and
armed guards stood in front of its heavy
ddt-glass doors.
"My family affairs are not for discus
sion in the newspapers," Is all that
Wickes vouchsafes In reply to his wife's
allegations. As to where she is now shel
tered he emphatically repeats that he does
not know.
CHICAGO, Oct. 17.â Thomas H. Wickes,

posed to be hiding with friends on the

. The fire is still raging and it is an in
spiring spectacle as the flames leap from
the timber and brush. The entire damage
cannot be estimated, but it will run into
thousands of dollars.
MILES OF FLUME LOST.
Five miles of f.ume belonging to the
Ban Antonio Water Company were eaten
up by the hu:igry blaze. While putting
out the fire on top of his house Kred
Udall was badly burned about the face
and head. His whiskers and hair were
burned off. W. L. Hall suffered heavy
Iocs. He had a long private line of flume
ruined. The Ilendrickson and Green
orange packing house was saved by hard
fighting, as was the adjoining house of
H. H. Hughes. Many trees in the outer
rows on the orange, k-mon and almond
Sroves along the foothills were ruined.
Thousands of acres of mountainside are
now black and charred.
This morning the wind carried the
flames to the northwest. Within three
hours time the houses of C. E. Sackett.
Edward Senior and W. J. Davies were de
stroyed. The latter also lost his pumping
plant, water tanks and outhouses. The
barn of James C. I^eslie was burned and
his house caught fire, but neighbors
saved It. He lost many stands of bees.
They wcu'd have been paved, but the an
gTy bees drove the fin-men away. One
man was badly stung.
CAUL FOB, ASSISTANCE.
In answer to the first call fifty men
were sent out in carriages and on horse
back. The farmers and residents of the
vicinity were also fighting. At one time
this afternoon several hundred people
were battling- with flames in the various
canyons. That the Thatcher school
buildings and the Smith Academy were
not destroyed was due entirely to the
wind and the heroic efforts of the stu
dents.
All the Nordhoff stores were closed to
day to allow the men to go to the foot
hills and fight the roaring blaze. Every
able firefighter was brought into service.
The conflagration soon spread in many di
rections and the forces were divided.
The Sre started near the Casa de Piedra
school. It seems that Miss Elizabeth
Smith started a brush fire near the school
and a stror.s wind scattered: the sparks.
Headmaster S. D. Thatcher_ca"Iled out the
pupils to prevent damage. . This was at
10 o'clock and before noon Thatcher wa.s
compelled to telephone to Postmaster
Smith at Nordhoff for assistance.
VENTURA, Oct. 17.â A devastating
mountain fire swept over the foothills of
the Ojai Valley to-day. It is now raging
alo:ig the mountain tops. The flames de
stroyed farm dwellings. Irrigation sys
tems, pumping plajjts, fruit trees, bees,
feed and timber.
Speclel r*Â«pÂ»tch to ThÂ« Call.
The defendants renewed their bonds for
a new trial and District Attorney Mc-
Pherson was unabie to state whether
there would be another hearing of the
case set for the present term of court.
While neither side indicated any gratifi
cation over the result, it was evident that
the many employes of the Government
who were present were disappointed.
Judge Thompson then questioned the
jury as to the probability of reaching an
agreement and was advised that there
was no such probability, without addi
tional instruction.
While there were unconfirmed reports
that the jury stood seven to five for con
viction, it was generally understood in
the courtroom that the jury was unable
to agree as to whether Miller had any
connection with tha dealings between
Ryan and Johns, or as to whether there
was any conspiracy between the defend
ant?.
The disagreement of the jury was gen
erally regarded as somewhat favorable to
the defendants, as the Government had
shown its hand fully in this trial. The
jury was considering the case for six and
one-half hours. It was undisturbed from
5 until 11:10 o'clock, when Judge Thomp
son sent for it, and the jury asked for
further instructions. Judge Thompson
then told the.jury he would instruct them
about any matter of law. but i.ey must
settle matters of facts among themselves.
He directed the jury to retire again and
submit their request for further instruc
tions In writing. At 11:35 o'clock the Jury
came in again and. In writing 1 ; reported
as follows:
"We are unable to agree upon a matter
of fact."
CINCINNATI, Oc* 17.-The jury 1n the

Joseph M. Johns, on trial in the Federal
Court here all week on the- charge of an
alleged conspiracy to extort a bribe, re

Judge Thompson. The trial attracted un

tion of those in relation to the
Portland Canal, which Canada wins. All
that now remains to be done is for the
Commissioners to affix their signatures
to the decision and complete- the map
which will accompany it. On the . map
will be marked the boundary line, defi
nitely fixing the division of American and
British territory on such a basis that no
American citizen will lose a foot of land
he already believed he held, while the
United States will get all the waterways
to the rich Alaskan territory, with the
exception of the Portland Canal, which
gives Canada the one outlet she so much
needed.
The long-standing dispute was settled
only after a week of keen, trying, secret
deliberations between the arbitrator?.
Even up to noon to-day there was an
acute possibility that a disagreement
might result and the whole proceedings
fall to the ground. Lord Alverstone.
though openly Inclined to believe in tho
Justice of the American argument that
the United States was entitled to the
heads of Inlets, as contained in question
5. held out that Canada had established
her case in questions 2 and 3, including
the Portland Canal.
After luncheon Senator Lodge. Secre
tary Root and Senator Turner agreed to
cede those points and start the American
boundary line from the head of the Port
land Canal, thus giving the Canadians
that channel and some small Islands on
which there are only a lew disused store
houses. This accomplished, the majority
of the tribunal agreed to fix, with this
exception, the entire boundary as out
lined in the American case.
Whether, Aylesworth ana Jett. the Cana
dian Commissioners, will refuse to sign
the decision and make It unanimous Is
not known, but It will not affect the
validity of the agreement If a minority
report Is submitted. By Monday after
noon, it is hoped. . everything will be
ready for signature, though the actual
making of the line on the map which *hall
forever determine the respective tenito
rles will occupy some time.
The majority of the Commissioners left
the Foreign Office early this afternoon in
order to catch trains tor week-end visits
to the country. Nothing had occurred
which led the few onlookers even to sus
pect that the dispute had reached its
practical end. The commissioners them
selves are still bound to secrecy until thÂ«
decision Is- actually rendered and prac
tically few others were aware how great
a degree of success had attended tho ef
forts of the American members of that
tribunal.

of the country to discuss questions that
would aid in bringing them closer to
gether. It was in reply to one of the
speakers, the editor of a New York paper,
who at the session of the day- before
took occasion to tell the employes,
in the event of a possible financial reac
tion, not to make any unreasonable de
mands on the employers, that Gompers
spoke of the harm that would follow any
attempt > to lower wages. President
Gompers answered many of the charges
made by the speakers and took particu
lar exception to some of the statements
made.
CHICAGO. Oct. 17.â A warning to capi
tal against cutting wages if financial de
pression comes, by President Gompers of
the American Federation of Labor, and a
plea for harmony between employers and
toilers by Senator Hanna were made at
the closing session of the National Civic
Federation conference to-day.

Maps, pictures, affidavits and informa
tion regarding the property and work now
being done wftl be furnished free upon
application to A. P. Fuller, secretary, or
"W. G. Rifenburg. E. M.. at the office of
the company, suite 402. Callaghan build-
Ing, 1212 Market street, San Francisco,
who will personally be glad to assist any
Interested person to a clear understanding
of this opportunity, and any persons who
are desirous of seeing this property the
company would be pleased to show them
the ground and pay all expenses if a suffi
cient amount of stock would be pur
chased, provided the proposition proved
as represented.
If there are any readers of this paper
who desire to stand In in a small way on
this wonderfully rich proposition they are
advised to put In their applications at
once. a3 the opportunity will last but a
very short time, for more than one-half
the money required Is now In the treas
ury. '
This stock Is absolutely non-assessable
and non-forfeltable. If any subscriber la
unable to meet deferred payments It Is
arranged so that stock for every dollar
he has paid will be issued him.
The incorporators of the company have
subscribed a number of thousand dollars
for the preliminary work of getting to
gether the necessary material for work-
Ing this proposition, and now they have
concluded to place a limited amount of
the treasury stock within the reach of
small investors on monthly payments, if
desired, on the following terms, the par
value of the shares being $100, % and tho
company being Incorporated for ' 10,000
shares. This small amount of stock will
be sold at $25.00 per share. $5.00 per share
being cash and the balance at the rate of
$3.00 per month. The day the' dredger is
installed the company will have an In
come of $1COO.OO a day, and as the company
does not owe a dollar no more stock will
be sold and the dividends will begin' im
mediately. Not only will dividends be
paid, but the stock will advance to par at
once.
The company owns two and a half mile*
of this creek at the point shown In the
picture. The ground is free from logs or
large bowlders, and can be successfully
worked by a dredger of modern . type.
Such a dredger will be incorporated, and
will handle 2C00 cubic yards of gravel per
day of twenty-four hours, with modern
concentrators for working the black sand.
These dredgers are no experiment, aa they
are to-day working: successfully In nearly
every gravel mining camp on this conti
nent, as well as in South Africa. The
profits from such a dredger at Calaveritaa
would be over $1000 a day net. Samples of
the free gold and black sand heretofore
mentioned can be seen at the office of the
company in San Francisco.

WARNS AGAINST
CUTTING WAGES
The people of British Columbia ex
pected to receive much more at the hands
of the Commissioners, but as one of the
officials of the British Columbian Gov
ernment said this morning:
"If the people of the province find that
the case has been rendered on its merits
and on its merits alone, they will accept
the decision frankly; but if, as has been
the case in other arbitrations where this
province has freen affected, and notably
the pelagic sealing arbitration, the deci
sion has been reached as a diplomatic ar
rangement between Great Britain and the
United States, it will cause extreme irri
tation in Canada, whose people are be
coming tired of being garlanded with
flowers and sacrificed to make diplomatic
arrangements between Great Britain and
the United States. British Columbia ex
pected much more and cannot see on
what grounds the decision was given
against them."
I VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 17.â Pending the
receipt of full details regarding the de
cision of the Alaskan Boundary Commis
sioners in London, British Columbia Is
suspending judgment, and beyond expres
sions of keen disappointment at the de
cision, which concedes everything to the
United States with the exception of Port
land Canal, officials will say little on the
matter. ..
Feeling Exists That Diplomacy Is
Behind Boundary Affair.
BRITISH OOI/TJMBIAJIS ANGRY.
To the Calaveras Dredging and Mining
Company, San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: I
have finished the examination of your
property, situated at Calaveritas. I find
by careful free tests that the gravel will
pay 60 cents per cubic yard In free gold,
this principally from surface work; that it
contains seven pounds of black sand; that
a portion of It is the richest I have ever
worked. The lowest recovery was forty
one ($41.00) dollars per ton; the highest
was six thousand ($6000.00) dollars in gold,
the richest sand known to me ' on the
globe. It is a great mystery to me jthat
this has not been worked before. How
ever, I obtained the values and am pre
pared to do so again.
ThÂ« richest sand I ever tested before
was from the Porcupine district, in Alas
ka, it running two thousand three hun
dred ($2300.00) dollars per ton. I frequent
ly find values as high as two hundred and
fifty ($2d0.00) dollara to three hundred
($300.00) dollars per ton. I believe your re
coveries will not be less than three mil
lion ($3,000,000.00) dollars from this deposit.
I consider your selection good, and must
recommend you to invest and push this
to a finish. Taking the situation and nat
ural advantages, a better property will be
hard to find.
There is no method that will surpass
the modern dredger 'for working gravel
and recovering gold. There are hundreds
of them now working. The modern
dredger is with us and has come to stay,
licspectiully yours,
(Signed) W. G. KIFENBURG. E. M.
Mr. Rlfenburg hastened to San Fran
cisco, and after co-operating with a few
gentlemen formed a company, to be
known as The Calaveras Dredging and
Mining Company, to whom he had the
property deeded and made the following
report:
There_is perhaps no more fai^>us min
ing district in the world than Calaveras
County, California. In the early *50's Cal
averitas was a thriving ~mtning camp,
with a population of upward of 2000 peo
ple; money flowed like the water in the
creek by the same name that ran through
the town. In those days mon got rich
separating the gold from the gravel of
the surrounding country with the crude
rcckers then in use. and millions of dol
lars have been carried from this section
on pack mules to the then distant town
of Sacramento, thence to the seaboard at
San Francisco.
Now at this point there are but a few
deserted cabins, an occasional ranch and
the bed of the old stream, dry in sum
mer but a tumbling torrent in the win
ter, while for forty-five years not a pick
or shovel has entered this ground.
Calaveritas is situated on the mother
lode about midway between San Andreas
and Angels Camp, and it was here that
W. G. Rlfenburg, E. M., a miner and pros
pector of years of experience, uncovered
a deposit of gold a few months ago that
proved,, so rich as to dazzle the Imagina
tion of even the most experienced and ac
customed assayers. At a depth of twenty
feet in the bed of this creek he found a
black sand, the assayer's recovery from
which was $6000 per ton in pure virgin
gold, while the free gold was $40 per ton.
Mr. Kifenburg states that this is the rich
est sand In the world yet discovered.
Mr. Rlfenburg announces that the only
way to work this property Is by- a mod
ern dredger. â¢"

RICH GOLD DISCOVERY IN CAL
AVERAS COUNTY
In that year, following the rich discov
eries of gold in the Klondike and 01 her
Yukon districts, as well as in tho Porcu
pine, Canada set up an interpretation of
the treaty never before advanced and un
der it made claim to all the upper part of
Lynn Canal and the Taku, Stikine and
other estuaries from a few miles above
their mouths and to Portland Canal in its
entirety, with a territory adjacent thereto
etlual in size to the State of Massachu
setts.'.. Â£ ; .. -" ;.-. ; ,, , . "..'. , ,
Several incidents involving the question
of jurisdiction over parts of the lower end
of the "Hslere" or strip of coast lying
near the â¢ theoretical boundary having
arisen previous- to 1892, in that year the
Governments of the United States and
Great Britain entered Into a convention to
delimit or mark out the boundary line.
Little or nothing was done, however, and
the question remained as it was until
1898.
Article III â The line of demarcation between
the posueMons of the high contracting parties
upen the coast of the continent and the islands
of America to the Northwest shall be drawn
in the manner following:
Commencing from the southernmost point
of the Island called Prince of Wales Island,
which polntNJies in the parallel of fifty-four
degrees and forty minutes north latitude, and
between- the "one hundred and thirty-flrst and
one hundred and thlrty^-thlrd degree' of west
longitude (Meridian of Greenwich), the said
line shall ascend to the north along the channel
called Portland Channel, aa far as the point oÂ£
the continent where it strikes the. flfty-nlxth
degree of north latitude: From this last men
tioned point the line of demarcation ehall fol
low the summit of the mountains situated par
allel to the coast, rb :"ar as the point of inter
section of the one hundred and forty- first de
gree of longitude (oÂ£ the same meridian); and
finally, from the $aid point of intersection, the
meridian of the one hundred and Â¦ forty-first
degree, in its prolongation aa far as the frozen
ocean, shall form the limit between the Rus
sian and British possessions on the continent
of America to the northwest.
Article IV â With reference to the line of de
marcation laid down in the preceding article,
it ia understood:
Firstâ That the island called Prince of Wales
Island shall belong wholly to Russia.
Second â That wherever the summit of the
mountains, which extend In a direction parallel
to the coast from the flfty-Plxth degree of north
latitude to the point of intersection of the one
hundred and forty-first degree of west longi
tude, shall prove to be at a distance of more
than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the
limit between the British possessions and the
line of coast which Is to belong to Russia, as
above mentioned, ehp.ll be formed by a line
parallel to the windings Cslnuositles) of the
coast, and which shall never exceed the dis
tance of ten marine leagues therefrom.
The articles referred to. written origi
nally in French, the diplomatic language
of the time, translate as follows:
The paramount question before the
Alaskan Boundary Commission was the
interpretation to be put upon articles 3
and 4 of the treaty of 1825 between Great
Britain and Russia, fixing the boundary
line between their respective territories.
These sections were quoted literatim et
verbatim in the treaty of 1867 between
Russia, and the United States, by which
the territories of the former power in
North America were ceded to the latter.
Interpretation of Old Anglo-Russian
Treaty the Issue.
HISTORY OP THE DISPUTE.
OTTAWA, Ont.. Oct. 17.-The Canadian
Government has not yet received official
notice of the decision In the Alaskan
boundary case. If .the decision is a. re
ported, namely, that Portland canal is. to
remain in Canadian territory, there is a
feeling 1 in official circles that the Dominion
has not much to be thankful for. Can
ada, In holding the Portland canal, re
tains Prince of Wales and Pearse Islands,
which overlook Port Simpson, the pro
posed terminus of- tte Grand Trunk Pa
cific It would be inconvenient to have
lost' these islands, but as they were
clearly marked on Vancouver's map as
being in Canada it is difficult to see "how
this could have been done. As the Gov
ernment has no official information, none
cf the Ministers will speak on the subject
for publication. J .
North of Port^Simpajon Canada will
have no harbor and no outlet on the Pa
cific Coast from the Yukon gold fields.
In the House of Commons to-day Gour
ley, member from Colchester, N. 8..
whose speeches in the House have gained
for him much notoriety, took occasion to
refer to the decision In the Alaskan
boundary case. He said: ' v
"If the news is correct that we hear in
Sensational Speech in the Canadian
' House of Commons.
CALLS BRITONS DEGENERATES.
slon has not handed down a formal deciB
lon, the press announcement may be tak
en as a correct forecast of the nature of
the decision, which probably will be made
public on Monday. The contention of
the United States regarding the Portland
canal was the weakest part of the Amer
ican case and the strongest point in the
Canadian contention. It is but a minor
detail of the controversy. The Canadi
ans contended that the Portland canal
ran to thÂ© north of two small Islands;
the American contention was that the
channel ran alongside of these islands.
On this point there was ground for argu
ment. Pearse Island and the other Bmall
Island are both of little or no importance
and their acquisition gives Canada prac
tically no additional advantage. The de
cision of the Alaska, boundary commission
will be a complete victory for the United
States."
State Department officials naturally are
profoundly gratified that an agreement
has been reached favorable to the Ameri
can contention. As was pointed out to
night by a high official, the decision is a
"complete Justification of our claims, an
evidence of the skill with which the
American case has been presented and a
trlbuteUo the fairness and broadmlnded
ness of the British member of the com
mission, Lord Chief Justice AlverstonS."
The effect of the decision, it Is said here,
is to leave the Alaskan boundary practic
ally where it is now. The main point of
the Canadian contention Involved th* out
let from the Klondike gold field at the
head of Lynn canal, Including the port*
of Bkagway and Dyea. through which the
Klondike business is transacted. Ttieae
ports remain American territory.
The decision la taken to concede the
American claim to a strip of territory
ten leagues in width from tidewater and
extending from the head of Portland
canal to the' 141st" meridian of west longi
tude. The Americans laid especial stress
upon their contention that this strip
should be measured from the heads of es
tuaries or bays, while the Canadians ar
gued that the measurements should be
from the main water of the ocean. The
control of the Bites of Skagway and Dyea
Â¦was involved In the controversy.
the corridors (and I hope it is not), all
that the United States have got to do is
to make a. claim from Canada and they
wiU.get if by boastfiilness and* dishonest
effort. If it is Â¦ true, we might as well
throw away. our national aspirations. The
last two generations of Englishmen were
degenerates and cowards. They have had
no leader since Pitt died. Thank God.

against speaking . about Englishmen in
this way. aqd Gourley retorted that they

NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â The Financier
says: The notable feature of the official
statement of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the unexpected loss
of $604,400 in cash. The estimates which
were based upon the traceable movements
of money during the week seemed almost
unmistakably to indicate not only an in
crease oi, $1,418,400 in cash, but even a
larger amount as the result of Friday's
Sub-Treasury operations. While there
might have been some slight error In the
calculation of loss on the interior bank
movement, the reports upon which tho
gains in cash, through receipts of new
gold, the payments for redeemed bonds
and- the Sub-Treasury operations, were
computed could scarcely -fall to be accu
rate, and it was from these items that
the net results were obtained.
The discrepancy of $2,000,000 between
the estimated gain and the official loss
cannot be accounted for on the theory of
averages. The loans, as reported by the
statement, decreased $4,836,000; this was
probably the result of the liquidation in
stocks early in the week and of subse
quent contraction of bank loans as a con
sequence of the depression In the market
for the greater part of the remainder of
the week.' The .deposits were reduced

CITY OF MEXICO. Oct 17.â The Inter

America, W. H. Hunt, president, with
branches in New York and San Francisco
and various points throughout Mexico,
closed its doors this morning in voluntary
liquidation and posted a notice to that
effect on the doors of the bank in this
city.
Thfs institution has advertised that it
has a paid-up gold capital of $l,S50,000 and
deposits of about fl,500,000 silver. The in
sltution has been in existence for some
four years and had until recently enjoyed
public confidence. The cause of the fail

Railroad officials continue to speak in
very sanguine terms of tho present busi
ness and prospects of the roads under
their charge. , Statistics of earnings bear
'out these claims and continue the average
increase over the corresponding periods
of previous years. Reports of freight
blockades and of car shortages owing to
enormous demands of traffic have been
received from various parts of the Middle
and Far West. Bank clearings the coun
try over are well maintained. The past
week has marked the passing of the pe

Government's statistics point to a large
crop safely made. Money continues easy
and fears of stringency are no longer felt.
The foreign trade statement for Septem
ber reflects the late outward movement
of corn and cotton, due to the lateness of
the crops, but shows general exports well
maintained, while a decline from the re

excess of export values up to only about

partly effective in offsetting the* weight on

JAPAN DEMANDS
BINDING TREATY
Wants Russia to Mark
Off Her Sphere of
Influence.
BERLIN, Oct. 17.-The negotiations.be
tween Japan and Russia, according to
the view of the situation taken Here, arc
not making progress. Neither side, it ap
pears from official Information, will yield
on the essential propositions. Japan per
sists in requiring an agreement that shall
now delimit their respective spheres of
supremacy and declines to consent to the
general policy of "drift" under which
Russian Influence will, the Japanese say,
steadily bear upon Korea and edge for
ward until the time Is ripe for acquiring
a part or of the whole country.
Japan, as previously cabled from here,
is determined, according to the German
view, to have a settlement with Russia by
a treaty whereby both must abide or elser
and the threat 1b ever In the near back
groundâhostilities will begin. This is the
danger In plain view. The Japanese Gov
ernment seemingly makes no particular
concealment from the diplomatic corps at
Toklo of this attitude, one Impression be
ing that Japan is merely playing a diplo
matic game and another that the Govern
ment Is In deadly earnest.
Russia's ever-increasing military opera
tions in thÂ© Far East and Japan's nearly
completed equipments are regarded as
pointing either to a settlement before
December or to hostilities. Japan's orders
for war material were placed in Germany
a year ago, and since then have all been
delivered or are afloat. Four Japanese
officers who have been buying war ma
terial and supervising artillery construc
tion at Essen left Germany for Japan last
Tuesday. ,
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 17.â While ex
pressing the hope of a peaceable issue of
the Far Eastern crisis, the Xovoe Vremya
points out that If war breaks out the
Russians will rise as one man at the call
of the Czar, and there can be no doubt
regarding the ultimate Issue. The Novoe
Vremya asserts that the- Japanese belief
that Viceroy Alexieff represents the Rus
sian war party is quite erroneous.
YOKOHAMA, Oct. 17.â A Cabinet Minis
ter says that Japan, agreeing with the
Marquis Ito, while stipulating the integ
rity of Korean and Chinese sovereignty,
makes no point of the military evacua
tion of Manchuria, thus simplifying the
negotiations. The bellicose rumors con
tinue, but the reports of Russian aggres
sion in Korea are proving to have been
exaggerated.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 17. â The Grange to-day took
steps to prevent the sending out of fruit from
other counties bearing- Santa Clara County
brands. Campbell Grange has joined hands in

The troubles In the structural steel
trade are attributed In a large degree to
the tying up of building operations by
strikes in New York and other large
cities. The intended reduction of forces
In the steel works Indicates the reaction
ary effect of this cutting off of Important
consumption. With the reduction of work
ing forces on railroads the economic prob
lem of reduction of consumption growing
out of stoppage of wages gains Increasing
weight in the consideration of the out
look.
The sentimental effect of the United
States Shipbuilding proceedings upon the
stock market would be difficult to esti
mate. There is no difficulty for the well
informed to make discriminating Judg
ment among the many industrial securi
ties In the market, and there Is no dispo
sition in such quarters to view the ship-;
building instance as other than an ex-
EFFECT OF STRIKES.
At the same time the market has not
been free from depressing influences
drawn. from Industrial developments. The
reduction In the dividend and the formid
able . decrease In the net earnings of the
United States Steel Corporation has been
a persistent influence. Official admissions
of large reductions In working force by a
number of great railroad systems have
pointed -to a general policy of retrench
ment In that quarter of the industrial
wqrld. The departure of an Inspection
party of United States Steel officials with
the avowed purpose of seeking measures
of economy of operation and reduction of
working force where possible pointed to
the same conclusion. . ,
The stock market has been unsettled
during the week by a number of disturb
ing factors and continuance of liquidation
in spot. The trouble has centered in thÂ«
Industrials as for some time and the
dwindling line between that class and the
railroad stocks has grown distinct. This
has led to some effort on the part of pro
fessional operators to Inaugurate an up
ward movement in the railroad list In
face of the continued depression in indus
trial. But the attempt -met with meager
success, beyond the comparative steadi
ness of the shares of railroads, until the
sharp rally on Friday. The disturbing
Influences have come from outside sources
rather than from local quarters and still
have' to do largely, with security market
considerations rather than general busi
ness and Industrial factors. Thus the un
settlement on the Plttsburg Stock Ex
change has been reflected on the New
York Exchange. The prospect of thÂ©
passing of dividends on the Crucible Steel
preferred stock caused by the falling
through of the intended purchase of the
Clairton Steel Company by the- United
States Steel Corporation has thrown a
burden' of liquidation of more readily
marketable stocks upon the New York
market, especially of United States Steel
stocks, which have figured conspicuously
in the week's disturbance. The London
stock market has passed through a trou
blesome settlement during the week
which proved a severe strain and' re
flected some influence upon the outside
financial world. , .
DISTUNING FACTORS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Yesterday's
sharp recovery In prices brought In a
large number of buying orders this morn-
Ing: and the stock market -was very ac
tive durlnsr the first hour. -By the end
of that time It became very evident from
harrow movement of prices that the de
mand was being freely fed to take profits
on yesterday's advances. The bears there
upon became less solicitous to cover their
short contracts and -commenced to buy.
The sellers allowed prices to slip back
to about last night's close, at which level
there was a large decrease in the volume
of business. The market for the r^st was
somewhat hesitating and lrreeular. An
advance of about a point in Amalga
mated Copper, United States Steel pre
ferred and Union Pacific had a reassur
ing effect and steadied the market, but
failed to lift it to a materially â¢ higher
le%-el. A number of the industrials which
had suffered violent losses during the
week made sharp recoveries and the high
priced coalers were marked up several
points at a time on the professed confi
dence that accumulations of steam sizes
of anthracite are being worked off.
The bank statement was regarded as
favorable. The furmer contraction in
loans is a satisfactory development and
the small decline in cash reserves In face
of the apparent gain by the banks on
the week's currency movement Is attrib
uted to possible withdrawals by the trust
companies. The market did not hold and
closed easy but dull.

BUTTE, Mont.. Oct. 17.â At an early
hour this morning two masked mounted
men rode up to the little station at
Welchs Spur, twenty miles east of this
city, and covering the operator with their
revolvers, drove him inside his office and
locked hint in. They then turned the sig
nal light so as to stop the next train. The
North Coast limited, the crack filer of tha
Northern Pacific, was due in half an
hour. The operator, F. K. Law, a boy of
20, threatened with death if he moved,
crawled on his hands and knees to his
telegraph keys and reaching from under
the table wired the operator at Home
stake to tell the engineer of the North
Coast not to stop, that bandits meant to
hold it up at Welchs Spur. The train
went through the latter place at forty
miles an hour and the bandits then rode
off. A posse took the trail at daylight.
NEW, YORK, Oct. Â±i.â a letter was re
ceived to-day from Simon T. Bartlett,
captain of the ship Neptune, which is con
veying the expedition sent out under the
auspices of the Canadian Geological Sur
vey to undertake the exploration and
acquisition of Arctic territory- Besides
the scientists on the ship, the party in
cludes a squad of Canadian police, and
part of the purpose of the expedition is
said to be the checking of poaching in the
whale fisheries in Canadian waters. The
intention is, it is said, to survey the lands
north of the British territory and take
formal precaution, as far as possible, to
raise the British flag over lands here
tofore looked upon as neutral. The let
ter, which brings the first news of the
expedition since its departure from Hall
fax August 24,- follows:
PORT BUR WELL. North Labrador, Sept. 1,
1903. â We are now at the extreme end of Lab
rador and In the morning will leave for Cape
Haven and Black Lead In the Cumberland Gulf.
We hope to be in winter quarters by the 20th.
Expect to connect with a Newfoundland steam
er here about July 25, 1904, with coal and pro
visions, after which will proceed north along
the Greenland coast, crossing over to Ellsmare
Land, following the coast up Lancaster Sound,
returning by way of Cumberland Gulf, up Hud
son Bay to winter quarters, land the Governor
and his party and lay in a harbor at the mouth
of Hudson Strait as late aa possible, returning
home" via St. Johns. We are very comfortable.
We have material on deck to build a hnuÂ«-\
On leaving we had 600 tons Welih and 30 t%is
anthracite coal, so we shall be able to keep
ourselves warm.

RISKS HIS LIFE
TO SAVE TRAIN
Behind the idea of peopling the West
with prospective passengers and shippers
there is another motive influencing the
Union Pacific Railroad in the opening of
its lands to free settlement. By an act
of Congress approved July 10. 1S86, all the
granted lands, . excepting those unsur
veyed and those situated in unorganized
counties, were made taxable and under
this act the company has since paid a
total of $3,132,167 35 taxes. Men directing
the finances of the road have reached the
conclusion that the burden is one to be
thrown aside at the earliest possible mo
ment. .
The railroad officials assert that the
best land they hold in the- category men
tioned will be disposed of as quickly as
the least valuable. Irrigation has reached
the highest point of utility in Utah and
California. In Wyoming, ( Western Ne
braska and Kansas and in Eastern Colo
rado competent and conservative land
men say there i3 much land that with
scientific irrigation will be worth as much
as that in States .where irrigation is older.
The Union Pacific's total land grant
originally amounted to 18,547,844.24 acres.
The selling of land commenced in 1868 and
to-day there is still for sale 4,500,000 acres.
Under the plan of a year ago the sales of
land up to the first of the present month
were actually less than for the entire
year preceding, amounting to only 72,923
acres. This interesting information re
garding the sale of Union Pacific lands
would not be forthcoming were it not
for the abandonment of the old plan. It
is on the authority of Birdsall A. Mc-
Allister, land commissioner of the Union
Paciflo Railroad at Omaha. In extenua
tion of the failure of the plan to secure
colonization it Is pointed, out that this
small acreage netted to the road $225,869.
Last year 83,700. . acres brought $116,000.
The experience of Hill in the North
west was that even $3 an acre for landâ
and this, was a high figureâ would not
yield the financial returns in the future
that would 1 an assured settler at a few
cents an acre. The officials believe that
free land will result in unprecedented im
mlgrationi j It will be difficult, they think,
to devise means of securing actual settle
ment <by- provisos in the transfer papers.
4,500,000 ACRES FOR SALE.*
At the next meeting of the directors of
the Harriman roads the project will be
submitted and recommended by officials
at Omaha, whose advice is always heeded
in the railroad councils. By that time it
ls^xpected that Congress will have passed
the bill throwing open for settlement the
lands in the Rosebud Indian reservation,
in Gregory County, South Dakota, of
which there are homes for 2600 settlers.
The Northwestern road last year com
pleted a projection, into this domain and
is making an aggressive effort to promote
its development, so that if the Union Pa
cific opens a considerable part of its west
ern unoccupied possessions at the same
time it is not unlikely that the greatest
settlers' rush in Western land annals will
happen in consequence.
Hatriman is said to -have â¢ concluded
with. Hill that selling off land obtained
under Government grants at v prices now
prevailing is an unprofitable way fo' settle
a country and develop railroads. The se
cret of profit-getting for the railroads in
yearg to come is colonization. What the
railroads want is not to be rid of the land
alone, but settlers, cattlemen and the
syndicates stand ready to take the land
off the companies' hands at substantial
prices, but the far-sighted railroad execu
tives know that land bought in this way
will .remain cattle ranges and unoccupied
investments for years to come.
The motives of the railroads stand re
vealed when the statement is 'made that
the Union Pacific carries twice the ton
nage from West to Kast as It does from
East to West, i What the railroads want
is freight from the East. Settlers alone
will solve the problem how to get it. The
great arid stretches of land which are
bound to be developed by irrigation can
be transformed Into populous cities and
prosperous agricultural Â¦ centers which
will furnish the demand for commodities
manufactured in the East. The Union
Pacific reads in the reports of increased
traffic westward on thÂ© Hill lines a les
son it was not slow to learn.
GREAT RUSH MAY OCCUR.
It was believed by the officials in charge
of the land department of the Harriman
road a year ago that the establishment of
a central office at Chicago, with branches
in the other cities of importance along
the line, for the sale of lands at small
prices would result in immigration out
stripping similar previous movements.
AVhat the expedient actually accomplished
wae considerably Increased receipts at the
expense of decreased colonization. Syndi
cates purchased the land fo,r speculative
purposes, and there were fewer immi
grants than in a single year for a decade.
The average price of land disposed of
during the past year the statistics show
to be greater than during the previous
years. The acreage disposed of was less
and the country was not populated as
thickly and quickly as was expected by
the originators of the plan. .
OMAHA, Oct. 17.â Satisfied that the plah
which has been In operation a year to
place the vast area of semi-arid lands
along the Union Pacific Railroad in the
West in the hands of home-builders is a
failure and that it is no longer financially
expedient to pay the Government large
sums annually in taxes, the executives of
the railroad have decided to adopt rad
ically different means to promote coloni
zation and secure relief from taxation.
It will be the opening for free settle
ment of a part of the lands in Western
Nebraska and Kansas, Eastern Colorado
and all of Wyoming. Possibly nominal
sums will be asked of the settlers, but the
plan is practically the same as that
adopted by James J. Hill in the North
west two years ago, with gratifying suc
cess.

WASHINGTON. Oct. IT.â General Fred
erick Funston in his report on the Depart
ment of the Columbia gives a general re
view of the conditions existing in the de
partment, which includes the Pacific
Northwest and Alaska. As the result of
a personal tour of Alaska during the sum
mer General Funston suggests that a dif
ferent station be found for the troops at
Valdez. because a mountain two thousand
feet high lies just south of the post,
which shuts off the sun for a large por
tion of the day. At Fort Egbert, which
is near the Arctic circle, he found that
the officers had a culitvated garden In
which they raised their own vegetables.
He cays that the question of maintaining
all the military posts In Alaska Is one
â¢'requiring more knowledge of the policy
and intentions of the Government than
if vouchsafed to department commanders,
before it can be intelligently dealt with."
At four of the pests on the military tele
graph line all the available force is needed
10 maintain the line. He recommends
that Fort Davis, near Dawson, be aban
doned, as the military is not needed there.
The people of that community, numbering
about 10,000, are not turbulent, and most
of them, he cays, could be called uporl
to support the civil authorities. General
Funston speaks in high terms of the sig
nal corps which has constructed the
miltary telegraph line In Alaska.
General Funstcn recommends that a i
large tract cf land at American Lake, i
near Tacoma, be acquired for the pur- j
pose cf a drill ground and camp for con- '
centration In case of war.

PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 17.â If the plans
of the John 'Burroughs Bird Society here
meet with success no woman in Oregon
will be able to wear a hat decorated with
the plumage of a bird. At a meeting last
night a committee was appointed to call
upon the proper officials and secure the
enforcement of a law which the Legisla
ture passed last winter and which reads
in part as follows:
"No person shall within the State of
Oregon kill or catch or have In his or her
possession, living or dead, any wild bird
other than a game bird, or purchase, offer
or expose for sale, transport or ship with
in or without the State any such wild bird
after it has been killed or caught except
as permitted In this act. No part of the
plumage, etaJn or body of any bird . pro
tected by this section shall be sold or had
in possession for sale."
Fines of from K to $100 or imprisonment
8t the rate of one day for each dollar of
the fine are the penalties for violation of
the law.

SAN JOSE, Oct 17.â A move to quash
all pending litigation over the estate of
the late James Campbell, the Hawaiian
millionaire, was taken In the Superior
Court here to-day by Mrs. Abigail Camp
bell-Parker, the widow, through Attorney
C. T. Bira of this city. This waa In the
form' of a notice that on October 24 she
will ask the court to vacate the order of
August 14 appointing II. L. Gear of San,
Francisco guardian ad lltem of Muriel
and Mary Campbell, her minor daughters.
She alleges she la the mother and natural
guardian of the children.
In Gear's petition he sought to contest
tha will of the late millionaire Campbell.
An objection was made to' the final distri
bution of the estate in this county. The
St. James Hotel property, part of the es
tate, was sold for $180,000, and the money
given Into the custody of the trustees,
who are to -manage the two-thirds inter
est of the $8,000,000 estate left in trust for
the children. Gear claimed the money
secured : from the sale should have been
distributed among the children, it was
also intended to attack the . trust on the
ground' that It was illegal, in that It ex
tended beyond the life of the beneflcla
rlea. -
In the notice filed to-day Mrs. Campbell
alleges that the court had no jurisdiction
to make the appointment of Gear aa
guardian, aa the final decree was made on
February 25, 1903, and the time for appeal
had expired. Further, that there was no
proper showini made that the necessity
of a guardian existed, and that the state
ments upon which the .guardianship was
granted were. not true; that G. A. Davis
was or is not the guardian of the estates

campaign will stop all this. It is a little
strange that the milliners (themselves,
who are directly affected, do not, many of
them, .look with disfavor upon the law.
In fact, some of them say that they

the bodies, heads and plumage of blrda
for hat' trimmings."
SAN JOSE. Oct. 17 Â»â Miss Cora Belle

whole the celebration waa a perfect suc
cess. Everything went without a hitch.
The committees saw to it that no exor
bitant rates were charged for the occa
sion by the hotels and livery stables.
Every guest who came to the celebration
went home well pleased and with kind
words for the entertainers. Â¦ Â¦ ,
' At night the visitors were entertained
by the most expensive display of fire
works ever Been in the valley. There
were many novelties and set pieces which
drew applause from the crowds. As a
Tears came to the eyes of. many visitors
as bronzed ranchers, tottering old women,
day laborers and local business men, all
of whom have made sacrifices and some
of whom have given all to the cause filed
by. Some were grave and heaved a sign
of relief as they passed the wire basket
Others tore the bonds into bits and hurled
them viciously among their fellows, while
occasionally a man would Jump on a bond.
When the last bond waa deposited the
basket was closed and swung into* full
view of the people, where they remained
while the Governor made his speech.
Governor Pardee spoke earnestly and his
simple, sincere words went straight to the
hearts of the hearers. He spoke with sym
pathy of the long, weary, and at times
seemingly hopeless struggle of the peo
ple, and as he pointed at tho bonds to
which he /would â¢ presently apply the
torch he spoke words of congratulation
to the citizens on their triumph.
When the cheering announced that the
Governor had finished a bomb was shot
a thousand feet into the air, where it
exploded and an enormous .American flag
unfurled. Great cheering greeted this
novel feature and aa Old Glory floated
majestically In the air a band played
"The Star Spangled Banner."
Governor Pardee then lighted the bonds
and as the paper which at one time was
valued at $700,000 burst into flame the
bank struck up a "Hot Time," to which
the crowd lent their voices. And as the
last embers of the fire died away two
buglers from the militia sounded "Taps."
BONDS IN THE BASKET.
Then the preliminary ceremonies of the
bond burning began. â¢ The bonds were
laid out on the table, while a huge wire
basket suspended from a crane at the
corner of the stand was lowered to the
platform. As the Governor placed the
first bond in the basket the crowd broke
into a mighty cheer. Each of the distin
guished visitors then passed the table and
in turn placed a bond in the basket. Then
came the'members of the bond liquidation
committee and the board of directors of
the irrigation- district. After this the
taxpayers themselves came upon the
stand to deposit the 'remaining bonds for
their cremation.
At 2 p. m. 10,000 people were gathered at
the handsomely decorated stand at the
pavilion, where the most dramatic event
in Tulare County's history was soon to
take place. The arrival of Governor
Pardee and his party was greeted by a
burst of cheering. The bonds, in a huge
basket, were then escorted to the stage
by the visiting militia. The Hon. J. "W.
Davis, master of ceremonies, made a
short speech, after which ho introduced
the Hoa. i "William H. Alford, who made
a few remarks.
At 11:80 o'clock the parade reached the
pavilion. Thousands of people were gath
ered to see the Governor and listen to
the speeches. On the south side of the
building a small army of men were bus
ily employed in making ready to serve
some fifteen tons of roast meat. Tho
barbecue was excellently managed, the
food being abundant and the tables ca
pable of seating a thousand people at one
time.
TULAHE, Oct. 17.-To-day Tulaxe cele
brated her independence from bonded In
debtedness. At sunrise the roaring: of can
non and anvils told that at last, after
weary years of waiting, the great day
had come. Flags and bunting were every
where. Every face bore a look of happi
ness, for Tulare was to be free.
At 10 o'clock the bond parade formed on
North K street, marching to Tulare and
down Kern street to the pavilion, where
the addresses were to be made. Sherhf
Collins of Tulare County was marshal of
the . day. First In the parade came the
bonds float, escorted on either side by
military companies of Hanford and
Bakersfleld. As the glass case containing
these bonds was borne through the streets
its progress was marked by one continual
round of cheering.
Following was the carriage of Governor
Pardee and Mayor John Tuohy of Tulare,
carriage;' bearing other distinguished vis
itors and the various committees who
have labored to bring about the settle
ment. Then came the High School stu
dents In festal regalia. The remainder of
the parade was mado up of representa
tives from local and visiting organiza
tions.

It is something unusual for highbinders
of this race to organize. Much trouble
has been experienced from Chinese of
this class, but the Japanese are usually
very orderly. The polic-j now fear that
they will have another source of this sort
cf trouble to cope with and strict In
structions have been given officers to put
a atop to the annoyance before it gains
any headway.
There? are about twenty alleged Japa
nese highbinders and all are reported to
be armed. Much trouble ha3 recently
been caused in the section, including two
or three cutting Bcrapes, for which ar
rests have been made. According to busi
ness men it is the plan of the lawless ele
ment to visit business houses and restuur
nnt.t, as well as houses of ill-fame and
gambling Joints, and levy blackmail. The
merchants fear the band and in cases
where they have refused lo accede to the
demands they have been assaulted.
The police have been informed that a
number of Japanese highbinders are op
erating in the neighborhood of Pine and
Dupont streets and efforts will be madt
to suppress them* It, is alleged that the
men attempt to levy blackmail on houses

The efforts of Benjamin Ferner to pre
vent by aid of the law the police from
interfering with him in the possession as
lessee of the notorious Hotel Nymphia, at
Pacific end Stockton streets, met with de
feat In Judge Murasky's court yesterday.
Judfe MuraEky refused to issue an In
-Junctlon preventing the police from raid
ing the place, holding that if the place
was a hotel, as was claimed by the plain
tiff, there would be no need for the police
to enter It. He said that he could not

pl&ce was a respectable house were true,
why it was necessary to surround it with
a high wall, like a fortress. "In view of
the evidence adduced." said the court. * 1
cannot give you the Relief prayed tor. Let
judgment be entered tof the defendants.'
The decision of Murafky is in line with
a decision rendered by him when the case
first came up for trial. At that time the
plaintiffs asked for a preliminary injunc
tion pending the trial of the case on its
merits. This was refused by Murasky be
cause of the refusal of the plaintiffs to
promise that the place would not be run
as a house of prostitution, which refusal
In the eyes of the couit stamped the
plaintiff as one coming into court with

with having falsely sworn that he was

fore a United States pension agent and
made application for a pension, represent
ing himself to be Randall. Malmgrist is
CO years of age. He will be sentenced on

Judge de Haven sustained the demurrer
in the case of the United States against
Captain T. C. Lockyer, indicted for an
infraction of the customs laws. It was
alleged that Captain Lockyer several
years ago. while in command of the tug
Hercules, went with his vessel outside
the heads and received from the Ameri
can schooner Winchester 170 fur sealskins
valued at $1700. The point raised by the
demurrer was that more than five years
had elansed before the amended com
plaint was filed and that the statute of
limitations had intervened.

U. S. DISTRICT COURT
Deserter Malmgrist Pleads Guilty
According to Harper's complaint he
gave hl3 credentials to Moore on April
3 last, with the understanding that they
were to be returned upon demand. On
October 12, alleges Harper, he asked
Moore for his papers and was told they
were in the possession of the other de
fendants, and they still keep them, he
says, notwithstanding that on October
14 he requested that they be given to him.
Harper claims the papers are of great
value to him, easily worth $10,000. With
out them, he says, he cannot follow his
chosen calling. They were only obtained
after years of study, he says, and by the
expenditure of large sums of money.
The documents are Harper's credentials

church and aa an elder of the Methodist
church south.
Rev. E. J. Harper, the Methodist divine
who is In difficulties with the elders of

credentials which he claims are being
wrongfully withheld from him. In lieu
of the credentials he asks for $10,000, their
alleged value. The suit is against Revs.

The officials of the Southern Pacific
Company aro exerting- all their energies
to provide the necessary "equipment for
the expeditious movinjr of the products
of California to the East, and they are
confident they now have the situation well
In hand. The growth of freight traffic
from this State during recent years has
been phenomenal and has forced the rail
roads to go to enormous expense for the
purchase of new rolling stock.
In the last three years the Southern
Pacific Company has bought more than
15,000 new freight car3 and 337 new loco
motives of the -most powerful ahd ap
proved type have not only been ordered,
but most of them have been delivered and
put Into servioe. Forty-one % thousand
carloads of California products were car
ried over the Southern Pacific lines to
Eastern points during the fiscal year end-
Ing June 30. an increase of 4000 carloads
over the preceding year. Shipments with
in the State also showed a large increase.
The local officials of the Southern Pa
cific are Just now doing a great deal of
crowing over what they claim to be re
markable transportation feats in railroad
transportation of freight. The first and
most gratifying was the rapid handling of
a cargo of silk that came in on the
steamship Korea. The consignment was
placed on the cars and rushed across the
mountains in passenger train time, the
trip from this city to Ojjden being made,
it is claimed, in Just thirty-six hours and
twenty minutes. .Almost as fast time was
made in the handling of the big cargo of
tea brought to this port from the Orient
last week on the big steamship Siberia.
The chests of tea were taken from the
vessel's holds and loaded on the cars
with all possible dispatch and the big
train was sent over the heavy grades to
Ogden in just sixty* hours, which, railroad
men say, is remarkably good time for a
heavy freighter.
According to a statement recently issued
from the office of the railroad company,
the orange and lemon crop of California
last season required 5601 cars to carry it
East, green fruit 7673 cars and canned
goods and dried fruit &000 big freight cars.
It is estimated that the present season's
raisin crop will require not far short of
Â£500 cars to move It.
During the last two months, which rail
read officials say is the rush season, cars
have piled up to some extent at certain
Junction points, but they add that such
"blockades" mean nothing more than the
necessary criss-crossing of trains to roach
points of destination.

TH* VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is-
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal Is the
Fa'fft and most efficient disinfectant and pur-
ifier in nature, but few realize Its value when
taken into the human system for the same
cleansing- purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more you take
of It the better; It Is not a drug at all. but
simply absorbs the gases and Impurities always
present In the stomach and intestines and car-
rles them out of the eystem.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smoking,
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous' vegetable*.
Charcoal effectually clears, and improves the
complexion. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious gages which collect
In the stomach and bowels; it disinfects the
mouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one form or an-
other, but probably the best charcoal and the
most for the money Is In Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal, and other harmless an.
tlseptics in tablet form or rather In the form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
bring mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges win soon
tell in a much Improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of it Is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinued use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
sorbent Lozenges to all patients suffering from
gas In stomach and bowels, and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat: I also believe the liver Is greatly bene-
fited by the dally use of them; they cost but
twenty-five cents a box at drug stors.. and al-
though in some sense a patent preparation, yet
I- believe I get more and better charcoal In
Etaart's Absorbent Lozenges than In any of
the ordinary charcoal tablets."

There are some signs, not particularly encouraging, that the bantam republics of Central America
intend to make an effort to reduce themselves to a condition of peace among themselves with- perhaps

The decision of the Supreme Court, suspending final decrees in divorce until a year after inter

whose daily grist is shame and scandal.

of Abyssinia. "Are there no Jews in your country ?" asked the King. The missionary admitted that
there were many. "And in the countries that you passed, through did you find no Jews nor heathen?"
asked the Socratic monarch. ' The missionary confessed that Jews and heathen were fairly abundant all

WITHIN the last six months there have been thirty murders of women by rejected
and importunate suitors. Two have occurred in this city. In all of these cases the reports
say that the man has pressed his distasteful and unwelcome stiit by threats to kill, if he be
rejected. The Call has" of tenj;alled attention to the unprotected condition of women in
such trying circumstances. The erotic lunatic cannot be proved insane.' If arrested and bound over
to keep the peace his bond is no restraint. Juries say.it is no crime to court a woman and the subject is
treated with unbecoming lightness and levity, but the slaughter goes on. If the young women who were
recently murdered in this city had only understood that the frequent threats made by the men who pur
sued and annoyed them meant that they were in real peril of their lives, and had maje relatives with
the right to protect them, such relatives should have been confided in. The appearance in such an
affair of a man with authority to protect the imperiled woman should mean always that he will punish
to the death, if needbe, the cowardly fool who threatens a woman in that way. / r
The law has an office in the matter, for which it should be equipped by legislation. The threat
to kill a woman for rejecting a man's suit should be made a felony and should be punished with a long
term of imprisonment. Perhaps it would be well to precede the imprisonment with a public whipping
in the jailyard. It is a high demand of civilization that the women of a country be protected. Next to
lynching, these murders of women by lust-crazed fools is the greatest of evils now apparent in this coun
try. It is a crime that seems to respond to the incitement furnished by the yellow press in its lickerish
exploitation of erotic sensations. It is yearly on the increase and is a real evil that decent men should
thoughtfully recognize and seek to remedy and prevent by law.
Unless this is done, the only recourse will be in the hands of such male relatives as can be ap
pealed to, and if they go to extremes they must trust to the common sense of juries for vindication.
This is a state of things that should be avoided if possible, and the only way to avoid it is by the seven
ties of the law.
EROTIC MURDERS OF WOMAN
IJC Burop* large Interest has been taken
of late years la cranes for heavy
dockyard work, and while electric
motors have been applied in many
cases and have been found to be
economical in operation for the very
heavy work preference Is still given to
the Eteam, crane.
A powerful LX>-ton steam derrick crane
recently erected at the wharf of Blohm
& Voss. Hamburg, Germany, has aroused
much Interest in shipping and naval cir
cles on account of the facility with which
It can be operated in placing great and
cumbersome weights.
The picture, taken from the Scientific
American, shows the crane In the process
of mounting a heavy gun in one of the
turrets of the Kaiser Karl der Grosse,
which feat was performea with ease In
a remarkably short time.
Its maximum lift Is 145 feet. Speed with
150-ton load. 6 feet per minute, with 10-ton
load, 40 feet per minute.
This type of crane has many distinct
advantages over the hammer cranes, with
horizontal Jib, and Jt is especially suitable
for wharves where a full revolution of
the crane of 2C0 decrees Is not required,
or is. In conseauence of local conditions,
tmjxjsslble. Little space Is taken up by
the three-legged frame and traffic on the
dock Is not disturbed or impeded In the
least, while even locomotive cranes with
large Jibs may pass under the principal
ley of the crane -without difficulty when
they are required for auxiliary service.-
One of the advantages of this crane lies
In the fact that it Is provided with an
â¢djustable Jib. whereby the height of the
â¢kip to be served is of no consequence,
KÂ£ the masts are easily avoided, and any
pert of the ship betweÂ«i the masts may
2>e reached. The crane is much lighter
because of the absence of a counter
mwight, and the great height of the pul
ltjrÂ«â45.25 meters with the Jib drawn Inâ
renders It possible to reach the highest
Â¦parts of the ships, even if they 'lie In
the dock.
"When this crane is operated with a load
of 150 tons, and at the highest projection
of Jib of twenty meters, the speed is 1.3
meters per minute: but with a load of
eeventy-flx-e tons and the came projec
tion the rate Is Increased to 2.6 meters
per minute, or double the speed under
full load. When the Email hook is used
with a load of thirty tens, the highest
projection being 22.5 meters, the rate of
operation Is six meters per minute, and
double this Fpeed, or twelve meters per

Consequently the proofs underwent con
siderable revision. These revised proofs,
in turn, were subjected to further altera
tion at the suggestion of certain relatives

the chapters before they .were finally
passed for the press.
In order to carry out thÂ« work under
the most favorable conditions, Mr. Morley
rented the "Red House," at Hawarden.
on several occasions.
and handed It to his assistants to copy.
It was not that Mr. Morley at any time
during tho compilation of tho work took
any rest. From beginning to end he
never relaxed his work, even when the
book was in the hands of- the printers,
for much new light was thrown on cer
tain phases of Mr. Gladstone's career by
matter which came to hand late. .
These experiments with liquid hydrogen
have led to the curious discovery that
freshly prepared salt or solution of ra
dium has a comparatively feeble power
of giving off heat at all temperatures, but
the power steadily Increases for about a
month, when it reaches its maximum ac
tivity, which it then maintains apparently
indefinitely. These remarkable results
have failed to throw any light upon the
process whereby radium maintains a con
stant emission of heat radio-activity.
Edward D. Adams has presented to
the New York Natural History Mu
seum a tube of radium of 800,000 power.
This was secured through Dr. George F.
Kunz, the gem expert of Tiffany's, where,
as well as at the museum, some most In
teresting experiments have been made on
precious stones and crystals. Including tho
new Wunzite. Working In experiments
together. Dr. Kunz and Dr. Charles Bas.
kervllle of the University of North Caro
lina believe they have made a valuable
discovery In connection with a trtllemlte.
By mixing radium with natural Â¦willemlte,
pulverized to a powder, ; the % activity or
power of the former substance Is multi
plied a hundredfold, and probably â for no
Instrument has been devised for measur
ing the increase of the activityâ a thou
sandfold. That at least is the temporary
effect of the mixing of the two sub
stances. Time must tell whether one will
nullify the other. Willemlte is a compar
atively cheap silicate of zinc. It Is possi
ble, also, that there is In wlllemite a sub
stance which Is as yet unrecognized as a
distinct element, but which produces the
radio-activity that has awakened the en
thusiasm of the two experimenters. But
thus far it is taken for granted that the
one substance merely stimulates the.ac
tivity of the other. The germ of a very
valuable discovery seems to lie here. Mr.
Adams has now supplemented- his pre
vious generosity by authorizing Dr. Kunz
to secure some radium of not less than
1.800,000 activity, which will probably b9
placed at the disposal of some of the
hospital authorities for experiments on
the alleviation or cure of disease.
Professor Curie has communicated to
the French Physical Society still another
remarkable property of radium. But a
few months ago scientific men shook their
heads when it was proclaimed that the
new Eubstance possessed the property of
maintaining a temperature higher than
that of the surrounding atmosphere. Pro
fessor Curie now announces the amazing
fact that the change in the rate of heat
emission of radium within the compara
tively short distance of absolute zero is
exactly In the opposite direction to what
might be expected in view of the effect of
low temperatures on ordinary chemical
action, for at the temperature of liquid
hydrogen the heat emission of radium,
instead of being reduced, is augmented.
In simple language, the substance which
does not change Its heat at all tempera
tures from that of an ordinary room to
that of liquid air gives out a greater heat
when subjected to the greatest cold that
scientists have yet reached.
That the light given out by radium
when phosphorescent is practically Iden
tical with that radiated by the rare gas
helium seems to be proved by recent spec
troscopic observations of Sir William
Huggins, reported in the London Times.
This paper goes on to say: "It will be re
membered that la?<t year Professor Ruth
erford produced striking evidence- for the
view that in the slow break-up of radium
that Is concomitant with its radio-activity
the Inert gas helium Is one of the pro
ducts formed. Recently Sir W. Ramsay
and F. Soddy have succeeded in detecting
helium by the" spectroscope in the gases
extracted from a radium salt. If, as the
present observations indicate, the radium
salt shines spontaneously in the dark
largely *by light belonging to the different
element helium, another important step is
gained In elucidating the nature of the
Instability of such chemical elements of
high atomic weight and the radio-activity
associated with it."
The crane is worked by two double
cylinder steam cngrnes, ono of which
drives tho gear for lifting, the other
transmitting the power for slewing, and
altering the radius of the jib. The energy
produced by slewing is mostly consumed
by a friction clutch built Into the shaft
of the revolving gear, which excludes any
compression on the frame or the driving
gear. The crane is lighted by an electric
arc light mounted on the top of the
frame, as Mill be noted in the Illustration.

"To begin with, Mr. Morley had about

It may be interesting to know' that the
authoress was born in Jamaica, educated
in. London., and introduced to the public
through the medium of Sir John Leng's
popular weekly, the People's Friend. But
It was not till her father died that she
took up literature seriously. Her hus
band is Eugene Lee Hamilton, whose
poems appeared recently in the Canter
bury series, and who has written that
remarkable historical novel, "The Lord
of the Dark Red Star." Mr. and |frs. Lee
Hamilton live at Florence, in a charming
old villa on the slopes of Flesole.
Automobiles have become so popular
that it is surprising 1 they have not been
utilized by authors as prominent features
in their stories more than has been the
case up to the present. There is one
automobile novel coming out. It Is called
"The Motor Pirate," and is written by
G. Sidney Paternoster and published by
Messrs. Chatto & Windus. .
Mrs. Lee Hamilton, known to readers
as Annie E. Holdsworth, authoress of the
very successful books "Joanna Trail.
Spinster," and "The Gods Arrive," has
another work ready, which, I believe, will
be published serially before , It receives
book form. It is to be called "The Tri

. The other biography, which will be pub
lished in a few weeks, comes In the na
ture of a surprise. It Is from the pen
of Sir Arthur Sullivan's cousin, B. "W.
Findon, better known as a dramatic critic
than as an author. It will deal with Sul
livan's works as well as with his life/
Sullivan family. OnÂ© biography
which ought to be interesting Is being
prepared under the direction of Sir Ar
thur Sullivan's son Bertie, who is super
vising the selection of suitable matter
from the dead composer's private letters
and diaries, which are full of references
to both the British and German royal
families.

ALREADY it is apparent that the recent incidents in Wall street, arising in overcapitalization of
trusts and the manipulation of their stocks, will cause an expansion of the law to cover and
prevent such pseudo financiering/ Taking the International. Mercantile Marine as an ex
ample, it was capitalized with $60,000,000 of common and $60,000,000 of preferred stock and
$75,000,000 of 454 per cent bonds. The squeezing and liquidating process of the last two months
has pressed this mass of paper down to its true value. The common stock is selling at 3^, the pre
ferred at 14 and the bonds at 30. This means that the whole capital of $1*95)000,000 is proved to be
worth, at market prices, $33,000,000. Those who saw a vision of appalling dimensions in the bloated
capital of the trusts did not take into account what was sure to happen in the shrinkage to natural and
right measures. V ;
What is needed is legal restriction that will, in the future, prevent any but the natural measure
of value being attached to such enterprises. President Roosevelt has from the beginning insisted upon
such publicity as will protect the public from investing in anything that has a false and unnatural meas
ure of capital. The public, against all prudence and all warning, has heretofore invested in these enter
prises at the valuation fixed by their promoters, as if they were run by wizards, who by some super
natural process could make something out of nothing. As people will continue to follow the illusions
of hope, it is proper that the law protect them against the glamour of self-deception. Those who have
despaired of the expansive force of the law might have reinforced their foresight by taking a back sight.
Every human relation is subject to abuse and misuse. The dearest and most intimate relation
is that of the family. But to prevent its abuse the regulation of law was necessary, and we have the law
of domestic relations, of husband and wife, parent and child, master and servant. Business was once a
partnership activity, before joint stock companies and corporations, and, to safeguard it, legal principles
were expanded in the law of partnership. When the corporation appeared the evifs of its physical im
mortality, by reason of its perpetual succession, were regarded as so formidable as to threaten the over
throw of society. But concurrently with the development of the corporation arose that great body of
corporation law, by which* the power of co-operation was preserved for every useful purpose, while its
agency for evil was restricted, limited and finally destroyed.
So it is destined to be with this new system of incorporated corporations, called trusts. If they
survive at all it must be under an expansion of the law that restrains them from the beginning of their
existence to the last and least of their operations. If, under such protective and restrictive law, they
have a useful office in the busy world, they* will survive and fill it efficiently, as the partnership and the
corporation did. If they cannot do this it will only prove that the law, which furnishes a remedy for
every wrong, has found their existence to be inconsistent with the interests of mankind.
Every great advance in business, and every extension of the vast operations of trade, and every
period in which the common prosperity is greatly enhanced carries also a myriad of devices to unduly
appropriate to a few the gains of the many. In one period these devices take one form, and in an
other they appear in different shape. But no matter how protean their character, their object is the
same, and the great principles of the law need to be constantly invoked to curb their cupidity, which is
their permanent object never lost sight of through all the forms in which they appear. So far the world
has been protected against them by invoking the law, and the better condition of the mass of the people
in nearly all of the modern nations, the rise of each generation of the common man to common use as
comforts of those things which were the luxuries of the few in generations past, testify to the expansive
and protective capacities of the law in so high a degree as to inspire all men with profound respect for
that science of human life, which progressively protects every man in the enjoyment of his own.

of the shut-down is said to be lack of or

ST. LOUIS. Oct. 17.â At the headquar
ters of the Brotherhood of Expressmen,
President F. E. Moody of Chjcago to
night said in effect that unless other ex
preES companies stopped handling 'ton
nage for the Pacific Express Company a
general strike would be ordered among
the employes of the different companies
who are members of the brotherhod.
Members of the brotherhood declare
themselves well satisfied with the prog
ress of the strike in St. Louis, which has
been augmented by employes in Missouri.
Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas. Indian
Territory and Texas.
Officials of the Pacific Express Company
say that their business is not suffering to
any extent from' the strike. General Su
perintendent Gentsch Baid the company
was somewhat behind in getting express
matter out of St. Louis, but he was con
fident this would be overcome by the first
of next week.
From descriptions furnished by. Ede and
Walsh, tho police are led to believe that
the men are the same ones who were op
erating earlier in the night.
The pair slid over the side of the
tender and disappeared in a nearby
marsh. As soon* as the train arrived at
the Oakland station the police were no
tified. â¢
Shortly after midnight the engineer and
fireman of a special freight train were
held up at the West Berkeley stock yards
by two masked men, supposed to be the
same ones who robbed Kley's saloon ear
lier in the night. They boarded the tender
of the engine, climbed on to the cab and
at the point of revolvers held up Engineer
Robert Ede and Fireman John Walsh, se
curing the street clothes of both and $10
from Ede. They then jumped off the train
and disappeared In a marsh near by.
The freight was slowly pulling into the
West Berkeley stock yards when the
highwaymen boarded the tender. Their
presence was not noticed by either the
fireman or the engineer until they com
manded the trainmen to throw up .their
hands.
Both Walsh and Ede were taken en
tirely unawares and quickly obeyed the
command The desperadoes searched
both men carefully. They took $10 from
Ede, all the money he had. Walsh had
none, so the men decided to take his
street clothes which were lying in the
cab. As they were about to leave, they
noticed Ede's clothes and took them also.
Nusbaum was the only man who was
required to stand against the wall, and he
finally gave up the contents of the till,
amounting to some $30. . The sum of $9
was secured from Louis Davis, but the
other men had nothing. During the ex
citement the mask covering the face of
one of the men dropped sufficiently to
show that he was a young man with a
light mustache. Otherwise no description
of the robbers was secured.
A pair of desperate masked men com
mitted two daring hold-ups at the points
of revolvers last night. Early in the
evening- they entered the saloon of Chris
Kley at Tenth and Kirkham streets and
robbed the bartender and all the patrons
of the place, securing $50. While 'the po
lice were busy seeking clews to the des
perate pair they climbed on the engine
of a . special freight train as it was near-
Ing the stockyards at West Berkeley and
robbed Engineer Robert Ede of $10 and
his street clothes, and also took the wear-
Ing apparel of Fireman John Walsh.
At Kley's place the barkeeper and all
of the' occupants of the saloon were lined
up against the wall and the plac was
cleaned but. The men then made their
escape and those in the saloon say that
they are unable to identify the robbers.
Kley's saloon- is in the center of the res
idence district, away from the usual beats
of the policemen, and the location is fa
vorable for any attempt of this kind.
Fred Kusbaum, son-in-law of the pro
prietor of the place, was on duty to-night
shortly before 8 o'clock, when a man in
a black mask entered through a side door.
He had a revolver, which is described as
a "blue gun," and ordered everybody in
the saloon to throw up his hands. There
was an indication on the part of Nus
baum to flght, when another man with a
white mask and a "bright gun," made his
appearance at the front door and rein
forced the demand of the first man that
hands be thrown up.
There were three men in the saloon at
the timeâ Joe McCutcheon. Arthur Beau
champ ana Louis Davis. When they saw
the second man with the revolver appear
they decided that discretion was the bet
ter part of valor and they yielded to the
command.

' PATTOSIEN'S
Christmas Idea!
Pattosien Co. has hit upon a novel plan of
saving; money for Christmas.
It will not only help you save, but insures
your getting something useful in the home,
from the mostJ reasonable and best Furni-
ture and Carpet House in the State.
You can almost guess when you see
the bank.
Here's the Proposition.
You know that Pattosien Co. runs a strictly
cash house of the highest standard. Many
people would like to get some of their
Christmas goods here, butthey haven't the
cash readyâ they haven't saved enough to
get the piece they fancied, so they go
down to one of the installment houses and
pay about twice as much in the end.
Save It Now!
It's much easier to save now and buy
Christmas than to buy then and save
afterwards.
Come and get one of these oxidized metal
banksâ with a dollar depositâ to be re-
funded when the bank is returned. Take !
it home and drop in your savings and by
Christmas time you'll have enough to get
something very nice â something that will
be appreciated. YouMl feel better to know
it's paid for in its real value and that you've
saved 40 per cent by purchasing from the
largest Furniture and Carpet House on the
Coast.

Judge Fritz yesterday for the arrest of
C. R. Mabee on a charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses. He alleges that
on September 13 Mabee represented to him
that he waa half owner of the American
Telephone Directory of Oakland and he
had sold a part of h's Interest to "John
Doe" of Oakland for $630. On these rep
resentations, which Filcher says were
false, he advanced Mabee $160.

enormous amount of clerical work since they

Chauncey Dppew stated at a large pub
lic meeting, "The young man who grad
uates from college (literary) and who en
ters business without going through a
business school is enormously hampered
in his progress in life."
In other words, the average graduate
of Yale. Harvard or Cornell needs a. busi
ness education as much as the high school
graduate.
Practical education is a necessity. Lack
of businrss training is not only responsi
ble for numerous business failures, but
is the true solution of the problem of

Suddenly, however, she came 'out of the

Captain Anderson of the Oakland had
little to say of the accident. He blamed
the fog and seemed to think that the
Newark was a long way out, of her
course. He heard the Newark's fog whis
tle, but was unaDle to locate her, and was
taken by surprise when she loomed up,
heading directly for him.
Captain Bradley of the Newark; who
has the reputation of being'Â»Ohe of the
most careful navigators on Q&.bay, was
equally brief, in his discussion of the af
fair. ,;i
The Newark escaped with the loss of
a Jackstaff and a few feet of rail and
the Oakland, although more seriously
damaged, was able to make a couple of
trips before she was laid off for repairs.
THE CAPTAINS' STORIES.
The Oakland fortunately had on board
comparatively ftw passengers, but on
the Newark were nearly a thousand men
and women bound for the 'shops and of
fices of the metropolis. The screams of
women mingled with the crashing of glass
and tearing apart of timbers. Women
added the disorganizing element* of hys
terics to the general confusion and strong
men fought with' each other for lifebelts
and convenient places in the vicinity of
the small boats. Above the confusion,
however, from the lusty lungs of the
officers came assurance of perfect safety,
and by the time the reversed engines suc
ceeded in tearing the boats apart a meas
ure of self-control had settled down over
the passengers of both boats.
Both boats were going ahead slowly and
both sounding fog whistles. Each pilot
heard the whistle of the other boat, but
the hills of Yerba Buena helped to dis
tort the sound and neither could locate
the other by the long, regular blasts
that came floating through -the white fog.
Suddenly the boats came within sight of
each other. Engines were stopped and
reversed, and when a collision was seen
to be inevitable skillful steering reduced
the force with which the big vessels came
together.
The Oakland, commanded by Captain
Charles J. Anderson, loomed up, heading
right across the bow of the Newark, of
which CaDtain Charles H. Bradley was
in charge. The wheels of both boats were
going full speed astern when the collision
took place, but the great weight of the
Newark carried her on with considerable
force. She struck the Oakland a little
aft of amidships. The Newark's blunt
nose forced its way under the Oakland's
guard and in the Impact the latter boat
was heeled over at an angle of terrifying
acuteness.
BOATS GOING SLOWLY.
It is customary during the prevalence
of foe as thick- as that which yesterday
blanketed the harbor to rearrange the
ferry schedule so that only one. boat is
away from the wharf at a time. This
Js for the purpose of preventing Just what
happened yesterday, as when traveling
under the slow bell required by the reg
ulations in foggy weather it is impossible
for the pilot to adhere to his usual course.
For some reason no such precaution was
taken yesterday. The Newark was late
In leaving the Alameda mole and the cap
tain of the Oakland, figuring on the New
ark having left on time, took no account
of the possibility of an encounter in mid
channel. >
The Oakland, bound for the Oakland
mole left this city at 7:20. The Newark
left the Alameda mole for this city about
the same time. The boats met about
midway. There -was a strong flood tide
at that time and the fog was extremely
thick. Both boats were traveling at slow
speed and both pilots, on account of the
lagging pace and fast running tide, had
to guess as to the leeway they were mak
ing and consequently as to their exact
whereabouts.
heavy fog and, although the pas
sengers on both boats escaped with a
bad scare, some of them will suffer from
the nerve jar for many a day to come.
That thn accident was not more serious
was due to the presence of mind of the
men in charge, of the boats. . With little
margin in which to do anything, what
they did, was done promptly and, fortu
nately, turned out to be the proper thing
to do.

If there is one thing more than all others
that will give a man a forlorn and friendless
appearance and make him morbid and
"cranky" and disagreeable, that thing Is dys-
pepsia. It makes one forget his friends and
become morose and irritable. He <Â« so wrappsd
up in his own misery that he is inconsiderate
of every one else. Relieved of this terribU
and depressing ailment, hÂ« again becomes a
good fellow and a man among men.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are beyond ques-
tion the most effective and' popular remedy
ever offered to the 'sufferers of this terrlbla
disease.* The thousands and thousands of
cures they have brought about and the enor-
mous Increase of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are. above all, a natural remedy. Ther
possess exactly the same properties that thÂ»
gastric juices and other digestive fluids or the
stomach Dossees, and they actually do the di-
gestive work of the stomach and enable that
organ to rest and recuperate and become sound
and well. They act in a mild, natural manner
and cause no disturbance In the dlgestlv-s or-
gans. They prevent any fermentation of tha
food which causes sour stomach. In fact, un-
der their influence tha subject forgets that he
has a stomach' end his resulting cheerfulness
presents a great contrast to his former dejec-
tion. . Â¦
Millions of boxes of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets are sold annually and they are but in the
dawn of their popularity. Every mail brings
letters of thanksgiving from grateful ones who
have been cured of this terrible disease. The
following is one of hundreds received each
â¢week: .
Rev. J. R. Hoag of Wymore, Nebr., writes:
"For six years I have been' troubled with dys-
pepsia. Last fall I became Aery much alarmed
at some symptoms of heart trouble and came
to believe there was a sympathetic relation be-
tween the two diseases, or rather that the
stomach trouble was the cause of the. heart
disturbances.. I hit upon Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets for a remedy and Invested a dollar and
a half for three boxes which lasted. me three
months, and I can eat any kind of food I want
and have a good, vigorous appetite. Although
I am 77 years old, I now feel perfectly well
and without being requested by any one I
make this statement as a compliment to the
virtues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets." : ' Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for sale by

HENCHMEN of Ruef's candidate
for Mayor attempted to break up
a Republican meeting at Silk's
Hall last night, but failed.
Cheers were given for Schmltz,
but these were drowned by heartier cheers
for Henry J. Crocker, the standard-bearer
of the Republican party. After two or
three men had been threatened and an
other thrown out of the hall the speakers
were given a hearing.
Maurice Asher. candidate for Supervisor,
turned the Incident Into some ' good by
saying he regretted that the "Schmitz
man" had . been thrown out the window,
as had he remained and listened to Henry
J. Crocker he would cast his vote for him
and not for the incumbent. Mr. Crocker
nlso secured a laugh by telling the crowd
that he had heard there was "something
doing" before he arrived, and he regret
ted he was late.
The hall was too small to accommodate,
the crowd.. Hundreds of voters filled the
place und cheered lustily for Crocker, and
the other candidates on the ticket. Excel
lent speeches were made and many con
verts to the standard of the Republican
party were gained.
The success of the meeting was due to
the efforts of the following members of
the campaign committee of the .Thirty
third District: Louis Taylor, J. J. Calla
han, John Hogan, James J.. Ryan,- John
Feno and Joseph McTighue.
John S. Partridge presided at the meet
ing,, and he carried - out his part with
great skill. His opening speech was full
of logic. !He pointed out that it .would be
wise for the people to elect Henry. J.
Crocker. He showed that the administra
tion of municipal affairs with Crocker at
the helm would be the finest the city haa
ever had. He dwelt at length on his qual
ities as a business man and as . a citizen
of the city of his birth. Continuing he
said: Â¦"'?Â¦Â£%'Â¦ *<VJÂ«
REPUBLICANS UNITED.
There has never been a time In the history
of this city and county when Â¦ the Republi
cans were' so absolutely, together as they are
in this campaign. We have at the head of
our ticket a man who does i not owe allegiance
to any boss or to any political faction. He
Is an upright, decent Amercian citizen. I have
traveled this city from one end to the other
and I hear Henry J. Crocker's name every
where. It seems to be In the air.
I know Â¦ the candidate on the Labor ticket.
He is a decent, agreeable gentleman.. I -know
the candidate on the Democratic ticket. >He.ls
also a pleasant, affable â¢ gentleman, but I . do
not believe that either of these gentlemen
could do for San Francisco that which has
to be* doneâ the. expenditure : of eighteen'mil
lion dollars â better .than our candidate for
Mayor. He has promised to see that the work-
lngmen get the most of the money expended.
The Republican party is the truest friend the
workingman has ever bad.
A PLAIN CITIZEN.
Charles Alpers created a great deal of
merriment by his rhyming talk. He has
the happy faculty of putting into verse
what other people find difficult to put into
prose. He appealed to the voters to
stand by the Republican ticket. He also
criticized Mayor Schmltz ' and his advis
ers. \ The speaker was interrupted fre
quently by men in the back of the hall
who were In favor of the opposition tick
ets, but he did not mind the interruption.
Theodore Lunstedt, one of the party's
clean-cut! candidates for. Supervisor, re
ceived a hearty welcome from the voters
present. In the course of his speech be
said: Â¦ ,
I hare been Informed that the time limit
for candidates for Supervisor is one minute,
and I will not overstep it. I want to make
the same statement to-night that I have made
every night, during the past week, and when
I make this statement I want every Republi
can resident in this district to know I mean
it. The Republican convention has placed
before the community of this city % ticket
that Is as good as any in the field, and I
say It Is the duty of every good Republican
to go to the polls on November 3 and vote the
ticket straight, from Henry J. Crocker to Ed
die Sweeney. (Applause.)
I want to correct an erroneous Impression in
regard to our standard-bearer. There seems
to be an Impression that Mr. Crocker is an
aristocrat. I had the pleasure of Initiating
Henry J. Crocker Into a lodge of Native Sons.
over which I presided, some years ago. I want
to pay that he was a plain man then and he
is Just the same man to-day. (Great applause.)
For myself, gentlemen and fellow-citizens. 1
can only promise, n" you will give me- your
support and If I am elected, that I will give
you a fair and honest administration of the
duties of t^e otflce.
Judge Joachimsen was given a good
rally when presented to his large audi
ence. He told of his past record; of the
boys and . girls he had saved to be better
citizens. He said if he was deserving he
wanted the voters to stand by him and
the balance of. the ticket.
George R. Wells, Maurice Asher, Fred
Eggers and Joseph S. Nyland were given
hearty greetings when presented. Ashor
scored quite a hit in his speech. He said:
r "l am sorry they threw the Sghmltz
sympathizer out of the window, because I
am sure if he had waited and heard Mr.
Crocker he would have voted for him."
(Laughter and applause.)
CREATES SENSATION.
When Henry H. Lynch was introduced
a voice could be heard above the hearty
cheers for the candidate for Sheriff. A
man rushed toward the platform yelling:
Contlnued on Page 37, Column 1.
HENRY J. CROCKER, Republican
candidate for Mayor of San
Francisco, Is developing consid
erable support In the camp of or-
gadzed labor. The magnitude of
his vote on Nevember 3 will surprise the
followers of Lane and the henchmen of
Schmitz. An exceptionally large number
of Republicans will vote their straight
party ticket at the next election. Many
Republicans are saying that they will
stamp inside of the circle at the top of
the ballot and also stamp for each Indi
vidual candidate down the column. Op
portunity will not then be given for any
misinterpretation of the vote by unfriend
ly election officers.
The new ballot law adopted at the last
session of the Legislature goes into prac
tical effect in this city on November 3
next. Republicans will make no mistake
in voting the straight Republican ticket
from top to bottom. The Democrats recog
nize the fact that San Francisco Is a Re
publican city and are therefore particu
larly anxious that three or four of the
Republican nominees for the Board of Su
pervisors should not receive a straight
party vote. The coon in the Democratic
woodpile is not wholly concealed. If Re
publicans should make the mistake of voU
'Ing for two Democratic nominees for thÂ«
board and then fail to stamp the cross
opposite the name of each of the remain
ing sixteen Republican candidates the en
tire ticket for Supervisors would be
thrown out In obedience to instruction?
from the Registrar's office. Unfair or un
friendly election officers might insist on
th'rowing out the entire ballot.
To avoid any possibility of mistake let
Republican voters stamp inside the circle
at the top of the column and then go
down the line and stamp for each candi
date In the Republican column. It will bÂ«
time enough after the new ballot law has
been construed by the election officers for
Republicans to discriminate In favor of an
exceptionally good man on a rival ticket.
The safe proposition in this election for
Republicans is to vote the Republican
ticket straight, beginning with Henry J.
Crocker for Mayor and ending with Ed
win M. Sweeney for Judge of the Poll?*
Court. M; Â¦;-
It is common talk In political circle*
that Henry J. Crocker will be elected
Mayor. It is true that the Schmitz meet
ings are well attended, but Schmitz ha*
a large following of office holders con
nected with the various commissions and
departments of the city srovernrr.t* nt.
Many of them neglect their official duties
In daytime to do politics for the man who
put them next to the public treasury, and
nearly all of them are campaigning at
night -{or Ruef and Schmltz. They 3hout
lustily for the Mayor whenever Ruef
gives the signal. The promise is out that
Ruef will allow a wide open town in ths
event of Schmitz's re-election. Fire De
partment attaches and policemen are do
insr politics for Ruef and Schmltz.
The Republicans, however, are holding
the largest and most enthusiastic meet
ings of the campaign. It is freely predict
ed that Crocker will get more than ZJ.OO
votes on November S. The support ho is
gaining from the ranks of the working
men Is especially gratifying to the Repub
lican leaders. Mr. Crocker Is making a
manly campaign. Lane Is not doing any
thing to speak of aside from casting *ome
reflections on the Schmitz administration.
At the Potrero last Thursday evening he
was advised by a committee of hla follow
ers to talk of sewers. Lane heeded tfhe
advice and made a short talk on drain
age. The to^Ic Itself Is not so alluring,
but it is a changeâ a reltef from Candidate
Lane's incessant twaddle about himself.
The Election Commission has ordered
the names of about SCO men to be stricken
from the great register because they coul-.i
not be located at the residences whicb
they had given when registering.

The final number on the programme
was an exhibition drill by the Temple's
Arab Patrol, under. command of George
Filmcr. captain: William P. Humphreys,
first aid; Charles Jellinek, second lieuten
ant. The drill was perfect, every
movement being made with a precision
equal to that of the best .drilled military
compans*. Many of the evolutions were
unique and there was frequent applause.
Those who took part in this drill are:
Company B, Captain Walter N. Kelly,
then gave an exhibition of bridge build
ing without nailing, simply using ropes
to fasten the timbers. The work was
well and quickly done, winning the ap
plause of the entire audience.
Troop A. Captain Charles Jansen, gave
an exhibition saber drill which proved
conclusively that the men of the troop
know how to handle the arm named.
The section from the Naval Militia, un
der Gunner D. O'llearn. gave an exhibi
tion of drilling with a Hotchkiss one
pounder which was a revelation -to many
who never before had witnessed the
handling of a gun of that description.
The Jackies, like the others, were loudly
applauded.
The first event of the evening was a
rrand entree and march in review in the
following order: Troop A, N. G. C. ; Com
pany B. First Regiment Infantry: one
section from the U. S. B. Marion, and the
Islam Patrol Drill Corps, all under com
mand of Major George Fllmer. The sev
eral organizations made a fine appear

assembled in the' big building to witness
the entertainment. Many of the ladles
were in evening costume and all the mem

one of the most fashionable audiences
that has gathered in that building in
years.

HENRY J. CROCKER ADDRESSING A PACKED MEETING AT SILK'S
HALL LAST NIGHT, AND THREE CANDIDATES WHO ARE CAM
PAIGNING WITH HIM ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET.
Inmate of Almshouse
Wields Weapon on
Keeper.
Justice of the Peace Van Nostrand yes
terday gave Judgment In the sum of $2G0
against Sheriff Lackmann, who was sued
by Adolph and Max Lehmann for hav
ing attached two printing presses which
the plaintiffs had bought in good faith.
After the plaintiffs had bought the presses
the Sheriff's deputies took possession of
them on a writ of attachment served on
the man who had sold the presses to the
Lehmanns.
Lackmann acted under an amendment
to the Code of Civil Procedure which was
adopted at the last Legislature and pro
vides that the selling of goods in bulk
or as stock In trade is not valid unless
due notice of the same has been filed
with the County Recorder for at least
five days before the sale, together with
the name of the vendor and vendee and
the amount of the purchase price.
Lackmann contended that the man who
cold the goods to the Lehmanns had not
complied with the law in the manner
mentioned and therefore the goods had
not legally passed from the possession of
the seller to the buyers. As the writ of
attachment was directed to the sellers
Lackmann's deputies seized the printing
presses after the Lehmanns had obtained
possession of them, on the ground that
the sale was an absolute nullity since
it had never been recorded. Â¦
In deciding the case against the Sher
iff. Judge Van Nostrand practically rules
that the amendment requiring five days'
notice before sale is In direct conflict with
Federal and State laws and is therefore
unconstitutional. Van Nostrand held that
the amendment was a deprivation of prop
erty rights, which always included the
powers to buy and to sell, without any
due process of law. Van Nostrand was
fortified In his ruling by a Federal court
decision in the State of Ohio, which held
that a similar provision making certain
requirements In the sale of goods was
unconstitutional.
*'I must have be*Â»n pretty drunk when
I did this," said the prisoner. "I had
rarnc d !!5 cents for washing some clothes
and with it went to a nearby saloon,
Where I jrot a quantity of red wine. When
I returned I wanted to stay out in the
yard, but they would not let me and that
.made me mad. Pulling out the knife, I
Â»=aM they would let me do as I wanted,
but they finally had their own way about
it. I do not remember having cut the
guard ar.d I thought little of it until I
found that 1 had been charged with as
sault to murder.''
It was soon after 7 o'clock on the night
"cf the quarrel that Donovan was discov
ered strolling about the yard. He wu
ordered inside, but positively refused to
gro, and another guard came to Guard
John O'Brien's assistance to take him by
force. Donovan was very excited and
resisted the efforts cf the officers to move
him. After a short struggle he drew an
eld knife out of his pocket and plunged
It into O'Brien's back. The wound was
not deep or serious and the injured man
craa able to continue In the struggle and
trlsg his man into submission. Donovan
was locked up in a cell Friday night and
ifFterday morning was Turned over to
Sergeant Helms at the Park police sta
tion.
Jeremiah Donovan, an aged inmate of
the A5mshouse. is under arrest for having
gabbed a guard Friday night. He is now
*t the Central police station and the
charge against him Is assault to murder.
According to the prisoner, he was intoxi
cated at the time he committed the
crime, having consumed 25 cents' worth of
c!aret at a neighborhood saloon.
, The deceased had lived at the place
where his death occurred for the last
twelve years. He was nearly blind as a
result of an operation to remove a cata
ract from one of his eyes, and was gen
erally in feeble health. He was remark
able for hl3 thrifty habits. He cooked
and slept in one room, and. some of his
neighbors cla'm he obtained most of his
provisions from rejected stuff at the mar
kets and what he could glean from swill
barrejs. . .
Before he became disabled by partial
blindness Page drove a sprinkling cart,
being employed -by "his . brother, Robert
Page, now deceased, who'at one time held
the contract, for the sprinkling of the
city's streets. It is claimed that he was
a partner in the' contract, although his
name did not appear as' one of the parties
to It. . : : â¢
The body of Henry Page was found in
a bathroom of the lodging-house at 123
Tenth street yesterday morning by W. T.
Brown, the proprietor of the house. The
deceased was aged 73 years, and the cause
of death was evidently heart disease. He
appeared in good health and spirits when
he retired Friday night.
The dead man was a teamster by occu

AGAINST SHERIFF
She was attired in a handsome dress of
black silk, with black hat. At her right
side was the empty. bottle and at the left
was her silk handbag, containing her
false teeth and a purse with $3 50 in It.
â¢There was nothing about her to in any
way show her Identity.
About twenty feet away was found a
tin cup. From this she had drunk the
poison and then thrown It away from her.
The remains were discovered by W. J.
Barnard of 1630 Page street and Oscar T.
Schuck, Parrott building, as they were
climbing over the hills.
They at once reported the matter to
Beargent J. H. Helms, who telephoned
to the Coroner's office and Deputy Coro
ner J. Fennell and Officers Nelson Norton,
J. S. O'Shea and J. J. Dow were prompt
ly on the scene and the body was at once
removed to the Morgue.
Charles Schwebs said he thought Mrs.
Brodt was laboring under -an attack of
temporary insanity. : aa he knew of no
possiblo reason why she should take her
own life, as her family relations were of
the most pleasant character.
The deceased was about 62 years of age.
Another eon, Lincoln Brodt, is residing
at 2328 Tenth street, Berkeley, Friday his
mother sont him a note saying: that she
intended doing away with herself and on
receipt of the letter he at once came to
town and sought his brother-in-law,
Charles Schwebs of 37 Langton street,
and asked him to try to find his mother.
Schwebs visited the Morgue late last
night and at once identified the remains
found in the park as those of Mrs. Brodt.
Mrs. Brodt chose a picturesque, seclud
ed spot on the brow of Bell Tower Hill,
just adjacent to the cyclers', rest, and
there, on a sloping, mossy bank at the
foot of a tail eucalyptus tree . and sur
rounded by a thick growth of oak trees,
took the deadly potion that ended her ex
istence.
The dead body of Mrs. Eva Brodt of
Quaker Hill, Nevada County, was found
In Golden Gate Park yesterday afternoon
at 2 o'clock. By her side was an empty
bottle, which had contained carbolic acid.
What were the reasons that caused her
to take her life are not. known. About
three weeks ago she arrived In town from
Los Angeles, where she had been visiting
friends. Her husband is residing in
Quaker Hill, and" a son, William, is living
in Fresno.

yesterday on the National basebalf

goals, Vancouvers 3 goals. The winners
played a closer game than the losers and
excelled them In shooting for goal. In
other respects the teams were evenly
matched. Little Currle, the center of the

the spectators by his brilliant play. He
was loudly applauded on many occasions.

WEST POINT, N, Y., Oct. 17.â Under
extremely bad weather conditions Har
vard defeated West Point to-day, 5 to 0.
There was much fumbling on both sides.
It was probably the most desperately
fought football game ever seen on West
Point's field. Exchanges of punts were
frequent. Near the close of the first half
Hurley of Harvard made a clever rush
at the side of the formation and, evading
theetads, ran twenty-five yards, crossing
West Point's goal line and making the
only score of the day. The plays through
out the first half were mostly in West
Point's territory. There was no time dur
ing the game that Harvard's goal was
threatened.
Soon after the second half began Prince
of West Point got possession of the ball
within twenty yards of the army's goal
and ran the entire length of the field,
crossing the enemy's line. The wildest
enthusiasm prevailed for a minute, but
the official declared the play out of order
and the sprinter was called i>ack. Near
the close of the last half Harvard at
tempted a goal from the field, but the ball
went wide of the mark. <
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 17.â Yale de
feated the Pennsylvania. State eleven to
day in a rainstorm by a score of 27 to 0.
Yale scored two touchdowns In the first
half by bucking the line and end running.
The play was of the simplest throughout
and the superiority of the Yale halfbacks
rather than the attacking power of the
forwards is responsible for the big score.
PRINCETON. N. J., Oct. 17.â In a pour-
Ing rain Princeton defeated the Carlisle
Indians this afternoon by a score of 11 to
0. Princeton kept the ball nearly all the
time, but made twelve fumbles. The first
score was made on a series of plays in
which Short figured prominently by line
plunges and part by long runs. Hart
crossed, but fumbled, and-Vetterlein made
a sensational run of fifty yards and was
downed on the eighty-yard line. Foulke
scored around left end.
ITHACA, N. Y., Oct. 17.â The hardest
game on the Cornell schedule played this
season waa played with Bucknell tiTiS
afternoon, when Cornell had difficulty
scoring a single touchdown. The final
score was 6 to 0. In tho first half neither
side scored. Early in the second half the
visitors carried the ball to Cornell's thir
ty-yard line, when Rice got in on a,fum
ble. Line piunging by McAllister and
Hunt brought it to the . fifty-yard line.
Breweter gained twenty-five yards on a
fake kick and Rice, with a clean run,
scored a touchdown. Brewster kicked
the goal.

The following matches were played
L. C. Bozarth, an enthusiastic park
player, who recently joined the club, la
improving steadily. He beat K. B. Dag
gett yesterday ' handily. Bozarth won
both sets.
Counter attractions made the attendance
on the tennis courts rather lighter than
usual yesterday afternoon. Many of-the
cracks, too, preferred not to play as they
expect some hard matches in the tourna
ment to-day and are desirous of entering
them Jn the best possible condition..-
Will Allen and Merle Johnson furnished
the best game in singles. Johnson has
played but little in the past few months,
but managed to break even with his op
ponent. Allen played good tennis in the
first set, which he won by fast work at
the net. In the next set Jonnson used his
clever chop stroke and passed his op
ponent constantly. He won this set and
thus evened up matters.
An exciting .doubles match was played
by Dr. Hardy and Sidney Salisbury and
Drs. Hill and McChesney. The latter
made a good showing in the first set and
several times came near winning. Hardy's
cleverness finally enabled his sJde to win
both setB.

From the cardinal aggregation there
gleamed forth thuee particular stars,
Weller. Stott and Stephenson. Weller Is
the human mogul engine; he just drives
and drives at the line, with his opponents
flapping wildly at his waist like so many
flics. He makes his distance on nearly
every down. Stott distinguished himself
by making one of Chet Murphy's old-time
runs fcr the goal. Starting on the forty
five yard line with a double pass from
I'ack to quarter, he cleared the scrimmage
und raced for the white line. LJttle red
h*>sded Stephenson made a brilliant effort
THEEE CABDINAL STABS.
Out of the nebula of doubt and waver
ing uncertainty which always surrounds
a freshman team the youngsters from Dr.
Jordan's school suddenly shot into the
gridiron world a finished unit of football
efficiency. The freshman team is always
the roc's egg of college athleticsâ you
never can tell whether there will be
hatched a fighting bird or an ugly duck
ling. From Coach Lanagan's incubator,
however, there sprung yesterday as fine
a^rood of game chickens as ever clicked
epurs on the checkered field.
(Jood, clean, hard football was what
won the day. The freshmen from Stan
ford played like a piece of pewerful ma
chinery, all together, never ceasing:. Their
team work left nothing to be caviled at;
their hammering was persistent and at all
times effective; the generalship of Cap
tain Stott in the quarter's position rarely
.failed to find an advantage and to follow
it when once discovered.
The Berkeley boys played for all that
was in them, but their all was not suffi
cient. They were not "quitters." They
stayed with an uphill game with their
team criprlcd by the loss of their captain
ar.d star flayer. Kern. They were simply
outpointed at every turn of the game.
Their team work was scarce worthy the
came. They were slow to get into the
play and slower still to follow the ball in
case cf a damaging fumble. The Stanford
freshmen should have made the score 24
instead of 12.
Eleven Stanford freshmen will wear a
b'.g white "07" on their cardinal sweaters
with just pride, for they defeated the
Berkeley baby team yesterday by as neat
nsid clean-cut a victory as has ever been
registered by either of the two big var
sity elevens. The score was 12 to 0.
.In the second half -the Berkeley men
took a wonderful brace and kept Stan
ford from scoring again. The same story
was repeated. Stanford would buck the
ball so far and then Berkeley would make
a desperate stand and get the ball only
to DÂ»nt out of danger. Only once was
the Berkeley goal threatened, and that
was when Stephenson made his
run to Berkeley's 20-yard line. A fumble
lost Stanford the chance of scoring again
and the game ended with the ball in the
center of the field.

With Kern out of It and. with no chance
for a touchdown themselves, the Berke
ley players forced a punting 'duel for the
reEt of the' half, in which honors were
even between Stephenson and Gabriel,
upen whom devolved the task of booting
the leather when Kern went out.
Â¦ Stott gave the signal, the ball was pass
ed by him to Dole, but Dole backed up
against his line and passed the leather
back to Stott ag^iinâ the old double pass
trick. It worked beautifully and Stott
was dodging through the Berkeley play
ers and off toward the goal for a touch
down, before the blue and gold men had
rubbed the sand out of their eyes. Again
Dole kicked the goal. Score, 12 to 0.
â¢TJ. C. -TAKES A BBACE.
Twice Kern tried the Stanford line and
once Tweedy did so, but it was like bat
tering against boiler iron. Kern had to
kick down to Stephenson on the fifty
yard Jlne. Then Stanford began firing
Weller and Brannan through tackles and
circling Dole about Gillis, Berkeley's left
end, until the whole fifty yards had been
bucked through and Dole had slid over
the line for a touchdown just seven min
utes after the first whistle was sounded.
Dole kicked the goal; score, 6 to 0.
Kern started the ball again by kicking
out of bounds on the kick-off. It was
brought in to the twenty-five yard line
and there kicked back to Kern at the
center line by Stepbenson. Again Berke
ley tried to buck. Tweedy, Kern and
Gabriel were shot at Stanford's guards
and tackles to no avail and Kern was
forced to kick out again. Stephenson re
turned the punt to the middle of the field.
Then the two teams see-sawed, Berkeley
punting and Stanford bucking until the
ball -was on Berkeley's forty-seven yard
line.
There was nothing like the crowd of a
big game â¢which assembled on Richmond
field to see the struggle of the under
classmen. The grand stand was about
half filled by the brilliantly gowned and
beribboned feminine partisans of the two
universities, while the bleachers were
given over to the leather-lunged onesâ
those who bark out doggerels to inspire
the players on the gridiron. Presidents
Jordan and Wheeler were there to look
after their boys and they themselves
came in for rounds of cheers from the
college youths. Of the old footballers
there were Hall, Kaarsburg, Franken
heimer and Spauldlng, who had come to
yell for the baby yearns.
The two teams lined up on the gridiron
at 2:40 o'clock and at the blow of the
whistle Dole kicked the ball off. It flew
out of the limits, however, and had to be
brought back. After a second kick it
flew into the arms of Kern on the ten
yard line. Kern ran It in twenty yards
before he was downed. Then everybody
waited breathlessly to see what the U.
C. freshmen could do on bucking.
BERKELEY IS WEAK.
ATTENDANCE IS SMAIi.

to duplicate his captain's feat, but was
stopped after a dash of nfty-nve yards.
The game was a good one to watch, but
evidently a hard one to 'play. There were
enough brilliant plays and ticklish mo
ments to keep the spectators gripping
their scats. It was fierce football and
many a player lay sprawled after the
scrimmage. To Captain Kern of the
Berkeley freshmen belongs all honor. He
went into the game with several weak
ppots in his anatomy and was put out
time after time by the fierce rushes of the
cardinal. After brief moments of semi
unconsciousness he would rise stiffly to
his feet and get into the game again, but
finally he fainted from pain and exhaus
tion and had to be carried off the field.
Kern has lots of grit.

If the Cripples only got Into the game

the trick. Their old- falling of- piling up
errors when men were on the bags was
kept up with regularity, and In the mean
time the Angels sneaked In with victory.

Southpaw Cooper pitched the kind of
ball that generally wins ball games, and
with any sort of backing up he would
have buffaloed the Angels into losing.
When the Cripples did finally settle down
after the third spasm the Angel tossers
made no more runs and only one lonely
hit, in the eighth inning.

ed a pass to first and Smith was safe on
an error by Cooper. Dillon lined one to
O'Hara, and the latter let the ball go
through his mitts, so the silent Hoy had
little difficulty in sauntering in.
T^ey finished up for the day in the third
round, when three tallies were accumu
lated. Wheeler and big Smith each tore
oft solid ones, and ,ere the crowd had a
< hance to think Dillon sent the_ ball on a
mad chase to center for two bags and
scored both players.
Murdock singled In the fourth for Oak
land and went around to third on a "Tex
as leaguer" from the bat of the Moose.
Wheeler then threw badly to third in an
attempt to catch Murdock. and the latter
ambled home on the error.
The big rally on the part of the Cripples
was reserved for the ninth spasm. Deve
reaux waa given a chance on an error by
Dummy Hoy. and immediately came In
when Messerly punched out a double. Old
Peter sent a single to center and Messerly
came over the pan. Just then Mosklman
hit Into a double play and it was over for
keeps. The score:

FACULTY GIVES ORDER
FORBIDDING FOOTBALL
Carroll College Students Will Not Ba
Allowed to Play the

CHICAGO, Oct. 17.â A dispatch to the
Tribune from Waukesha, Wis., says: Be
cause of the frequent accidents during
football practices, which resulted In five
students being injured In the last ten
days, one so seriously that he was sent
home, the faculty of Carroll College has
forbidden the game. This action was
taken after putting the question to a
vote, first of the football teamÂ«and then
of the students of the college. Failing
to secure their approval, the faculty per
emptorily ordered the football eleven to
disband for the season.
The fifth semi-annual district convention

business portion of the affair there .will
be a social function that will relieve the

Degree of Honor Convention.
LOS AXGEI^ES, Oct. 17.â An unfor
tunate decision rendered by the judges
at the finish of the Pasadena* stake
at Agricultural Park this afternoon
almost caused an Incipient riot. Be
yond peradventure of doubt. Blissful,
ridden by Waterbury, finishing out In the
center of ths track, defeated the favor
ite. Kenilworth. with See in the saddle, by
three parts of a length.
Taking time by the forelock, the mark
er man across tho track chalked up thÂ«
numbers with Blissful first, he evidently
thinking the mare's victory a clean-cut
one. Then came the decision from the
stand, giving the race to Kenilworth. and
this precipitated the trouble. More than
1000 people gathered about the Ju<lgeÂ»*
stand and In an instant the occupants of
the grand stand were on their feet.
For a time it looked as if the services
of a corps of carpenters would be re
quired to repair the officials' stand, but a
sergeant and four officers* prevented any
muscular display. There was apparently
no appeasing the wrath of* the mare's
backers, for the crowd continued hooting
and Jeering, Interspersed with cries of
"Robbers." "Thieves," etc., until the
next race was called.
A like demonstration has not before
been seen on a California course. For the
benefit of the spoVt the occurrence was
moat unfortunate, but no officials are in
fallible and mistakes will happen. The
stake was worth $530 to the winner, and in
the ring Kenilworth was quoted a 9 to 20
chance. Blissful was 2 to 1, and Durbar,
the only other ctarter, 4.
See on the favorite went down fcr
wraps right after the start, his handling
of the brown horse being a case exhibi
tion. In the stretch he sat down, to f'.de.
but could not get up. Blissful reeling off
six furlongs Jn l:13\i. However. See was
too dumbfounded to see his number on
top as he returned to the stand. Then
followed v unhappy moments for the
judges, moments when they would liked
to have -bÂ«en left alone.
Perfect weather prevailed, the track
was lightning fast and the attendance was
large. Ivy Powell distinguished himself
by piloting the last three winners. Fa
vorites were thrice returned first. There
was some semblance of a contest In the
Wlnship stake for 2:20 class trotters. Sut
ter. driven by Mastern. held sway in the
betting, but Walter Maben's superior skill
behind Zombouyette landed that mare
winner after each had captured two heats.
A mile selling event introduced the run
ners and was taken by Billy Mcore.
Chandler had the mount and hustled trie
brown gelding off In front at the start.
Both George Dewey and Flamero made a
bold bid for the purse in the stretch, the
three horses finishing heads apart on the
wire. The ring held Flamero a slight fa
vorite over Dewey.
There were but four starters in the spe
cial handicap, with Tower of Candles,
ridden by Chandler, a 2 to 3 favorite. E.
M. Brattain was not coupled with the
first choice and came next in demand at
2. Threes could be had about Colonel
Van and Cruzados, all of which figured a
book that should have delighted almost
any syndicator. Tower of Candles .was
rated in the early part of it, with E. M.
Brattain being allowed to make his own
pace. This suited the gray sprinter and
he won handily from Colonel Van In
1:13*4- The favorite was third.
El Piloto. at odds of even money,
stubbed his toe again in the three-quarter
selling race. The Miller, next in demand,
won all the way. El Piloto dropping in
second ahead of Wachusett.
George Webb's Solon equaled the track
record in the mile and a furlong handi
cap, covering the distance in 1:53. Tha
gelding was a 4 to 5 choice and, perfectly
ridden by Powell, nabbed and downed
Cambaoeres with ease. Bragg finished
third, beaten a dozen lengths. Diamanta
was away from the post' poorly. losing all
chance. Powell had the leg up on Fox
Lake in the final two-year-old dash and
won from Metlakatla with speed in re
serve. Almansor took the show. Lester
ReifC started Turtle in the event, a good
looking colt by Scorpion.

pant. aged 14 years, died this morning at
the home of his parents. Mr. and Mrs.
Edward D. Moisant, 1515 Everett street,
as the result cf an injury to his spine
sustained Fix weeks ago by diving Into
shallow water at the West End and
striking his head on hard, packed sand.
An operation was performed yesterday
afternoon in an effort to save the boy's
life, but he failed to recover from the
fhock. Deceased was a native of this
city and a brother of Harriet, Shirley and
Bertin ifoisant.
If. W. Rarnh'll recovered the body of
Charles McCondah from the shore of Bay
Farm Island to-day. McCondah was the
cook who was lost from, the oyster
pchooner Admiral, that turned turtle in a
hravy blow on the 9th of this month. The
vessel capsized opposite Hunters Point
and McCondah and a sailor namea Emii
Larson were drowned.
The remains were identified by William
J. Klanchard and William M. Duncan,
members of the Cooks and Stewards*
Union of San Francisco, of which the
<3Â«>ad man was also a member.
George Phelps, 17 years of age, who re
eides at 1733 Central avenue, had the
muscles of his right arm near the elbow
fhot away to-day through the accidental
dircharge of a gun he was removing from
a duck boat. Phelps and Andrew Fisher
had been hunting and were in the act of
disembarking at the High-street trestle
when the weapon which Phelps was tak
ing from the craft with the muzzle to
ward him went off. The youth lost con
siderable blood before receiving medical
attention.
Anderson was anxious to plead guilty
to petty larceny, but the Judge refused
and said he wanted to make an example
of him as a warning to other thieves who
wantonly destroy property for the sake
of the few dollars It would bring them.
"There must be some way of stopping
this sort of thing," said the Judge. "I
have received numerous complaints from
real estate agents of empty houses being
entered and cas fixtures and lead pipe
torn out and stolen. It seems that a
short term In the County Jail is not suffi
cient punishment, otherwise that sort of
thieving -would not be so prevalent, and
a term In the State's prison may have the
desired effect."
Clarence Anderson was held to answer
before the Superior Court by Police Judge
Mogan yesterday on a charge of burglary.
He broke Into an empty building at 895
Jackson street on October 3 and cut out
all the gas pipe and gas fixtures. He
was arrested while carrying away the
loot.

-The recent criticisms of the National
Guard of California by Colonel' Koster,
while they" have been adversely comment
ed upon by many of the organizations,
have had an effectâ that of arousing the
many company commanders and making
them a little more attentive to the duties
Imposed upon them. Each how expresses
a determination to put his command in a
condition by the time the next Inspection
is held eo that praise shall follow cen
sure. To accomplish this result will re
quire a great deal of time and close at
tention, as well as a brushing up of the
common duties of the enlisted men and a
change from slouchy to soldierly appear
ance.
One matter that has been severely com
mented upon and has had a tendency to
make the members of the guard look un
soldierly is that of the uniforms that are
furnished' to the men. While it is admit
ted that shop-made uniforms, made ac
cording to specific Blzes, are not expect
ed to lit like custom-made goods, It Is
contended that the regimental tailor can
alter such so. as to make them present
able and give the men a chance to appear
o little better. than scarecrows. Neatness
In. uniforms will hereafter be one of the
matters that will be insisted upon. 'X:'i

Final Cottlow Concert
The third and final Cottlow concert was
given yesterday afternoon at Lyric Hall
and from an artistic point of view was
fully as successful as the two previous
performances. Miss Cottlow was assisted
by Natorp Blumenfeld, the violinist.
Among the violin numbers was Beetho
ven's great masterpiece, the "Kreutzer
Sonata," which was beautifully rendered.
Miss Cottlow has a faculty for making
immediately a favorable impression with
her audience. Yesterday she opened with
the "Intermezzo" In A flat major by
Brahms. There was another Brahms
number, a "Berceuse" and a "Polonaise"
by Chopin, and "Etude" In G minor by
Zarembskl and two Schubert-Liszt num
bers. Mr. Blumenfeld. besides the
"Kreutzer Sonata," played the Sarasato
"Zlgunerweisen" and a WienlawBki "Ro

Mr. Emile Dore, Ivy, Modoc County, Cal., writes me: "I have had no indication of my old weakness since I have worn your
Belt, and the varicocele is yielding nicely. I am very well pleased."
Mr. L. J. Barnett, Tillamook, Or., says: "I would not part with the Belt for any money if I could not get another. I can't

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
The present scarcity of cars on the
Southern Pacific Company's system Is
causing no small concern to the lumber
mill, men in the northern . part of. the
State. Their efforts to secure much
needed cars to carry their lumber to mar
ket having failed after repeated overtures
to the railroad company, a number of the
millmen continued to operate their mills
and pile the lumber up, hoping for relief
In the near future. J;
During the last few days, however, it
became apparent to the. lumbermen that
there were poor prospects ahead for their
getting cars, and, foreseeing trouble, a
number of the big millmen decided to
shut down, which they have already done.
Yesterday It was^nnounced that the rail
road company had advanced the rates on
certain local commodities, among them
lumber, which is expected to result in the
closing of a lot more Northern California
mills. In fact, one of the prominent rep
resentatives of the lumber interests said
yesterday that the raising of the rate and
the scarcity of cars left no alternative
for the millmen but to close down.
It is supposed that the advance In the
rates Is for the purpose of discouraging,
for a time, the shipment of California
lumber and thereby permit the railroad
company to use whatever empty cars it
may secure for the shipment of other
commodities to Eastern points and also
give the company the service of addi
tional engines, of which it is greatly in
need.
EUSTIS. Neb.. Oct. 17.â Six masked men
robbed the Farnum State Bank early to-day,
obtaining (4000. One of the men waa arrest
ed and the officers with bloodhounds are on
the trail of the others.
ABERDEEN. Wash.. Oct. 17.â Mayor
West to-day received offers of help from
Olympla and Portland, but has decided
that no help is needed from outside
sources. The merchants of the town are
not bankrupt as a result of the lire and
the outlook this morning Is encouraging.
The Montesano and Hoquiam firemen
returned home to-day, as no more damage
Is expected from the fire, which fs still
smoldering in places.
After a careful inspection of the burned
district the business men of the city to
day estimated the loss at no more than
$700,000. while the insurance experts say
that it will not exceed $500,000, on which
there is about $130,000 Insurance.
The loss of life is known to be three
men, but It is not doubted that a fourth
man perished In the Mack building, In
which the fire originated.
A mass meeting of citizens was held this
afternoon to discuss a proposed ordinance
establishing a fire limit and compelling
brick and stone construction therein.
This meeting also took steps toward the
formation of a building and loan associa
tion to aid In rebuilding the burned dis
trict. The work of clearing away the
ruins has begun.

Lewis. J. E. Barry and Henry Levison.
They said that In their various districts
the sentiment was strongly for Crocker
and the Republican ticket and all pre
dicted a magnificent victory on Novem

It was determined to appoint an ex
ecutive committee of seven members and
a campaign committee of twenty-five
members. The appointment of these com
mittees was left to the president, who
will report at the next meeting. The
president and secretary were .made mem
bers of the executive committee.
The Young Men's Crocker Club was
formed last night at CabriHo Hall, 414

Then the Mayor- went to a Labor Union
meeting at Butchers' Hall, on Eighth
street, near Folsom, and spoke for twen
ty minutes on topics that have been worn
threadbare In the present campaign.
At the Labor Union meeting the Mayor
again said that he did not favor array
ing class against class and accused his
opponents of doing such a thing. He de
clared the campaign of Franklin K. Lane
was but a subterfuge to draw votes from
the Labor party In sufficient numbers to
insure the election of the Republican can
didate. Henry J. Crocker.
Schmitz went over the familiar ground
of the teamsters' and carmen's strikes
and how he had refused to allow police
or armed deputies to be arrayed against
the strikers.
The Mayor Insisted that the Labor party
had earned a good record in the admin
istration of the city's affairs In the last
two years and It was not wise to elect
other men as an experiment to conduct
the business of the municipality, and for
that reason he aeked a re-election.
Powel Fredrick, Labor Union candi
date for County Clerk, was given a warm
reception at the Butchers' Hall. He ar
raigned the County Clerk's office and
dwelt upon the defalcations that' had
been discovered In the office. He said
that the present Republican nominee for
County Clerk was one of a crbwd that
had dominated the office for many years
The Mayor fir6t addressed a gathering
of newsboys at Scottish Hall, on Sutter
street, and the little fellows cheered the
Mayor, despite the fact that they ;xuld
not vote for him on election daj\
Mayor Schmitz was kept busy last night
canvassing for support at the coming elec
tion. He started in at 8 p. m. and fin
ished up his round of work after mid
night, addressing citizens, opening social
sessions and leading the dance at enter
tainments.

Franklin K. Lane addressed the Sunset
Assembly District last night at Park View
Hall before a good-sized but apathetic
audience. , He told hW hearer* that he
was not in the fight bÂ«causo he wanted
any gain that might accrue from tne of
fice of the Mayor, but that he
had gone into the fight because
he felt a sens* of dutv to the
city and because he wanted to save San
Francisco from an Infamous conspiracy,
He said the Republicans were playing a
crafty game, but one that would not bear
scrutiny, and he added, that the Union
Labor party was not a union labor party,
but was simply a branch of the Republi
can party.
Ruef also came In for a sound scoring
for tha part hÂ© was playing in the cam
paign. De Young's attitude was handled
without gloves. He referred to the Chron
icle as "that organ of sweetness and
light," and Etated that that paper had In
former times complimented his manage
ment of the office he represented, but now
he was denounced for Inefficiency.
The other speakers were Judge Ca

a sensation in the hall. The voters took

the building resound with acclaims for

Mr. Lynch thanked the voters for their
kindly reception and expressed the hope
that if elerted he would give the people
nÂ«> cause to regret voting for him. Harry
Raehr, candidate for Auditor, also re
cefved a warm greeting. He said:

paid It reminded him of the meetings held
for William McKinley, some years ago.
Joseph S. Nyland was hailed as "the

Dr. Thomas H. Morris, candidate for
Coroner, also received a f.ne greeting. He
told his auditors that If elected Coroner
he would give them a good, clear, admin
istration. He said there would be no mu
tilation of bodies; that no special under
taker would have the right to act for his
fVffice, and that bodies would not be re
moved from the homes unless circum

BAHBS' SON SPEAXS.
Judge G*orsre H. Bahrs Is suffering from
a eevere case of hoarseness, by reason of
his strenuous campaigning during the
past four days. His son. a bright young
lawyer, spoke in behalf of his parent and
helped win votes for his sire. He made
a ppler.did ppeech and was Interrupted
Â¦with hearty applause. He scored quite a
1'lt when he said: "It was last Wesdnes

friends said Dr. Dodge was invincible.
Gentlemen, nothing human is Invincible."
General Salomon, candidate for District
Attorney, discussed national issues and
showed the importance of electing the
Republican ticket this year. He aJso toli'
<'f'his record as a soldier and private citi
zen. He said he voted for Lincoln, and ,
had always stood by the Republican r^rty j
since its inception.
Maxwell McNutt. candidate for Super
visor, made an excellent Impression.
â¢<Ieorge Alpers, another candidate for
r^-electlon, was given a rally by his
friends.
Henry J- Crocker slipped Into the hall
rjuietly In order not to disturb the
speaker. When recognized he was
'theered to the echo. When the applause
had subsided Mr. Crocker spoke as fol

"The good times for the workingman,"
he said, "have always been under a Re
publican administration and they will
come more fully to and for the work-
Ingmen of San Francisco when we have
a Republican Mayor. I have known
Henry J. Crocker for many years and If
you had been a civil engineer with three
months' experience on the Board of Pub

mighty fine stop clock to record the
quickness of your decision* to vote for
him for Mayor. You can make no m}s

Another meeting will be held . In the
Thirty-third District next Friday- night.
After the meeting last night Henry J.
Crocker was royally entertained as a
guest at the fifteenth anniversary of the
Germanla Club Singing Section at 840
Geary street.
A. Van der Nalllen made the last and
one of the strongest speeches of the even
ing, full of rlth and good advice to the
working-man. He quoted the advice of
noted men to labor unions to keep out of
politics. He pointed out that, having been
a workingroan himself, he came out to
voice his opinion in politics because his
interests were Identical with those of the
workingman and he wanted them to make
no mistake.

make It a city that fvery voting citizen will

It Is about time for the people to take hold

AGGRESSIVE FOOTBALL
The railroad authorities here are ' reti
cent as to how the accident occurred, but
it is believed that the gravel train either
failed to see the signal or that the flag
man of the first train failed to go back a
sufllclent distance. *
The train bearing the men who were
killed and injured was made up of four
cars, two coaches m which the men were
riding and two flat cars in the rear. The
train stopped near Washington Crossing
to receive orders regarding the passing
of the regular passenger train. While the
train'- was standing on the track It was
run into from the rear by a gravel train.
The two, flatcars telescroped the two
coaches. There were about 180 men In the
two cars. As soon as the accident hap
pened the Italians became frantic and
made an attempt to do bodily harm to
the crew of the gravel train. Word was
sent to Trenton for police assistance, but
the men were finally quieted by the< fore
man.
TRENTON, N. J., Oct. 17.â Fifteen per-

PARIS, Oct. 17.â At Clermont the Fer
raud statue of Vercingetorix the Gaul
was unveiled to-day and M. Combes took
advantage of It to make a great speech,
in which he condemned clericalism and
nationalism and even laid down a pro
gramme for the political season. Including
the speedy passage of the budget of 1904
during the session, which will open on
October 20, and, then, after New Year's
day, the discussion of Important reforms.
These are an educational reform, with
the object of completely suppressing the
law of 1S51 which permitted the organiza
tion of teaching by religious congrega
tions, and a financial reform, with the
object of denouncing the concordat and
separating church and state.
The Income tax is frightening all French
financiers. As to the concordat, which has
lasted a hundred years, the Idea of its
suppression affrights many persons. The
struggle between church and republic is
going to continue. This country has
finally been persuaded that the existence
of republic and that of a state church
are Incompatible.

Charles F. Murphy, the leader of Tam

with the registration for three days. It
pclnts to a tremendous victory for the
entire city ticket."
Senator P. H. McCarren, Tammany's
leader in Brooklyn, eaya: "McClellan
will be elected, because the people are
cissatisfled with the fusion administra
tion and because the Republican party is
r.ft going to permit Itself to be disln
t< grated by being fusionized. McClellan
â¢will carry Brooklyn and so will the whole
Democratic ticket."
M. Linn Bruce, president of the New
York County Republican committee, says:
"The registration Indicates that the peo
ple are aroused and that the desperate
attempts of Tammany to regain control
of the city treasury will be defeated."
R. Fulton Cutting, bead of the Cltlrens'
I'nlon, says: "I believe Low will be elect
ed. I do not think it possible that the
people of this city after the administra
tion that Mr. Low has given will vote to
return to conditions which existed two
years aeo. They have too much pride in
the city and too much regard for their
own interests to Invite such calamity."

Two tournament matches were played
on the Scottish bowline: rinks at Golden
Gate Park yesterday. Many bowlera and
a large crowd of spectators were present
and watched the games with Interest.
The best match was that between W. R.
Eaton and W. A. Cook3. Baton held his
opponent down until hear the end, when
Cooks won by some clever bowling. Score,
21 to 17. In the other match A. Craig, con
trary to expectations, made no showing
whatever against James Gray. The lat
ter led all the ..way and - outplayed his
opponent from start to finish. The score
was 21 to 17. Gray has been bowling
cleverly of late and will prove Mc-
Naughfs most dangerous opponent in the
upper. half.. -

PARIS, Oct. 17.â The mystery of the
assassination in her villa at Alx les
Bains last month of Eugenie Fourgerie
has been solved by . the confession of
Mme. Giriat, known in certain circles aa
"La Nublen," an Intimate friend of Mme.
Fourperle.
In her confession Mme. Giriat stated
that the crime had been committed by
her lover, Henri Has sot. The woman said
that she had long coveted the jewels of

hundred thousand francs, and that she
Instigated Bassot to commit the murder.

day. Judge Ganneval examined the cy
clist Moranne, who claimed to have been
actually present when the automobile ac
cident occurred .which resulted In the
death of Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. Fair
In. August , of last year. Moranne
denied ; that he had made false

ments made before us by the prosecuting wit
ness during such investigation that the -charges
were made under a misapprehension on the
subjects Involved therein.
J. C. SIMMONS,
JOSEPH EMERY.
A. ODOM.
The report was hailed with much sat
isfaction by all of the members of the
conference. The result of the investiga
tion was just as anticipated.
When the report was adopted Harper
attempted to make a request that he be
restored to his church. His efforts, how
ever, were Ignored and his name was
stricken from the. roll of the conference.
Rev. M. F. Grove, pastor of the South
Methodist Church of Visalia, who was
expelled last March for marrying again
while his divorced wife was living, made
an appeal for reinstatement. The divorce
was not on Scriptural grounds. The dis
cipline prohibits marriage by a minister
of any person divorced for any reasons
other than Scriptural. Grove made an
appeal to the conference for reinstate
ment, and the following committee was
appointed to try the case: Jesse "Wood,
W. F. Coffin, J. C. Thomas, R. F. Allen.
J. L. Jones. C. C. Black, W. A. Booker,
C. E. W. Smith, C. Todd Clark and O. L..
Russell. The committee met this after
noon to investigate the matter.
Grove was sued by his wife for divorce
in the Superior Court of Tulare County on
the ground of extreme cruelty. He made
no defense and the decree was given to
the wife by default. Shortly after the
separation Grove married again, and it
was this marriage that caused his expul
sion from the church. No decision was
announced by the committee.
Tne Ladies' Foreign Missionary Society
occupied the morning session of the con
ference, and the Sunday-school anniver
sary was held to-night. I. N. Halliday of
the First Methodist Church of Oakland
and Charles' R. Fisher, State superin
tendent of Sunday-schools, were in charge
of the anniversary services.
'To-morrow will be given over to ser
mons by the various members of the con
ference in different churches In this city.
Monday will probably close the confer
ence.
The four Methodist clergymen â¢whose
characters were assailed by Edward Har
per, the former Centenary Church pas
tor, were completely vindicated of the
grave charges when the committee hav
ing the Investigation In charge made Its
report this morning.
When the conference opened the follow
ing Veport of the committee was read to
the assembled Methodists:
Tour committee of Investigation appointed
by the president of the conference required
by paragraph 274 of the dlsclllne to Inves
tigate charges preferred by Rev. H. C Mere
dith aralnst Revs. J. J. N. Kenney, W. O.
Wagtoner, W. E. Vaughan and J. A. Wailes
respectfully report that wa have carefully in
vestigated said charges and heard the evidence
in support thereof, and duly considered the
whole matter, and report thereon:
Firstâ We deem the charges entirely unsus
talned by the evidence.
Second â We deem a trial of the charges un
necessary as against or as to all or any of
the said elders so accused.

The Weird Elephant Spirit.
a a r^\ HUNDRED yards distant rusty masses of ironstone preceded
f I an undulation in the flat country, and toward the base of one
I "I tall block Lord Winstone descried an object which made him
JL rub his eyes with frank amazement.
"Near the foot of the rock, his back against it, and shadowed entirely
from the sun's liffht by a natural grotto in the stone, sat an enormou3
man or ape. Its stature was colossal, though smaller bv far than
the natives of Mapora had described; its naked body was bright ereen;
its hands were folded over its breast; its misshaped head was bent for-
ward, and wild, snakv hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly around it.
while pressed upon its crown was a wreath of flowers.
"In the midst of this strance kingdom, silent, motionless and alone,
with uncouth face and distorted limbs, reigned this huge green monster
in mortal shape.
"Lord Winstone cot out his field glasses, without which he never
hunted, and trained them on the grotto. He stared awhile, and then his
breath left his lungs in a gasp of surprise, as he returned the classes to
their case and pushed forward."
Without doubt the reader will gasp with eqÂ«al amazement and no Ies3
curiosity that such strange things can exist even in the Africa of to-dav.
but Eden Philpotts knows absolutely whereof he speaks when he made
the great Elephant Spirit of the Dark Continent one of the bit: features
of his new novel. "The Golden Fetich." now running in the Sunday Call,
the second installment of which will be published next Sunday. It gives
you Africa as it really is now and as it has not been shown since the
wonderful explorations of the creat Stanley. â¢
But unbelievable as the foregoing extract may seem, stranger thines
are being found richt here at home. Look in the next Sunday Call for
"Fitch's Mine of Mvsterv." It tells of the discovery under the very
feet of civilization in California, only a few months ago. of a mine of
fire that has utterly baffled the best scientists in the world. Chunks of
this wonderful mineral that has a flame which cannot be destroyed have
been taken from Fitch's mine, eround into powder, assayed bv every
known process, tested bv every possible standard, and still it remains a
mystery â and still it glows on with undiminished brightness. It cannot
be destroyed and it cannot be extinguished. Wonderful as is the newlv
discovered radium, of which/ there is less than one pound in the whole
world and which costs a fabulous sura for a single ounce. Fitch's new
mineral is even more astounding and by far more puzzling. And to
think that the earth in California is just full of it. but â read next Sun-
day's Call.

The Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruyter &
Co. says: 'Primary receipts are about the
same as last year. Cash markets were slow
nnd export demand not in evidence, although
some reports of higher bids were made.' Trad
ing is still mainly local and professional. The
prevailing sentiment is no doubt bullish. The
confidence seems based wholly on what Is the
strong domestic position. - Cash Wheat Is at a
premium in all markets. This cry would be a
strong feature if It were due to scarcity of
Wheat and an urgent demand. Its bullishness,
however, seems to us modified by the absence
of these conditions. Stocks of Wheat are, on
the whole, a little less than last year and the
receipts at primary markets on the average
about 10 per cent less, but the visible supply is
increasing fully as rapidly as last year, and
at the present rate of movement is likely to
increase more rapidly; than last year for the
next two months. There Is a demand for cash
"Wheat In this market from unusual quarters,
but the cash demand on the whole In aTl the
markets is below normal. It seems to us that
the strength of the cash position Is due great
ly to the congested situation in St. Louis. Kie
vator people owning the cash Wheat here are
afraid It will be spread out and go to that
market. Elevator people and millers in the
Nbrtnwest owning the cash Wheat are afraid
It will come to thlt market. ' In both cases
they are afraid of losing their Wheat. On the
theory, therefore, that the stocks on every
market will accumulate during the next two
months. It seems to be only a question of time
until this fear 'will disappear. Of course, on
the exoort demand, should It improve and

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 17. â General anxiety on tha
part of shorts to cover their UneB pending
possible further advances over Sunday caused
renewed strength in wheat. The opening was
rather quiet and easy, due to the indifferent
cables, the Liverpool market being barely
Eteady. notwithstanding the advance made here
yesterday. December was J /&c lower to %c
higher at Â£0%c to 80% c, and with some profit
taking by local longs prices declined a trifle,
December Flumping off to S0^4c early in the
day. At the decline local Shorts were good
buyers and the demand Trotn this quarter gave
a fair impetus to trading and the market
quickly rallied. Closing prices were at about
the best of the day, December being up &@
%c at 80Hc after touching 8I0.
The corn market still .felt the effects of
yesterday's heavy celling and ruled weak the
greater part of the day. Closing prices were
lower, December beine down Vic.
Oats were laboring under the same difficul
ties as corn. December closed %c lower at
36 Vic
Provisions ruled weak on a large run of hog3
and lower prices at the yards. AH January

CORNâ Continued weakness at Chicago,
whence we ate deriving the bulk of our sup
plies at present, keeps this market depressed,
though there Id no further decline. But Chi
cago continues to offer heavily on this market.
The Chicago letter of Bolton. De Ruyter &
Co. says: ' "The market still seems heavy,
December Corn is better suported than May.
The cash position does this. Â« Farmers' deliv
eries are still very small and although at the
moment the cash demand Is only moderate
stocks are decreasing. The immediate condi
tions of supply and demand are therefore likely
to control the December price to a great ex
tent; on the other hand the tendency of the
May ?. option seems to be toward lower
prices. Its tone is rather heavy.- It
seems to reflect the preponderance of
speculative' feeling that the new crop of
corn will be marketed at lower prices. Proba
bly the most of successful and Influential of
the local talent is disposed to operate on the
short side. We are Inclined to think, there
fore, we would sell May Corn whenever the
shorts cover freely and -a reasonable advance
takes place." â¢ .â¢ . . .

Prices of Potatoes were unchanged,- but the
miukrt was easy, with shocks of all- klnda
heavy. River BuTbanks, which are the weak
i es>t description, continue to arrive freely and j
i are eteadlly accumulating. Carrled-over stocks I
of Sweet Potatoes were offering freely and |
moved slowly at previous- prices. Receipts oft
Onions exceeded 2uOO bags and the market was !
easy. Some dealers were still asking 85c per
cental, but with a. majority of the trade 73c
was the to? price.
The early trade In Vegetables was quite ac
tive and confined cMefly to carrled-over stock.
! The trains with fresh supplies were delayed^by
I the fog on the bay and did not arrive until the
Â¦ afternoon, when business wan practically over,

Poultry and Game.
The receipts of "Western Poultry during the
week were unusually heavy, 7 cars being re
ceived from that source, and the receipts of
domestic stock were liberal. The demand dur
ing the last of the week was light, owing to
the competition of wild Ducks, and as a re
sult the market closed weak, with quite a
quantity unsold. Some dealers were willing to
make concessions yesterday In order to effect
sales, but buyers were scarce. Two cars of
AVestem. including one that came in on Thurs
day, will be on- sale to-morrow.
There were liberal receipts of Game and
there was a general decline In prices, as nearly
all descriptions showed the effects of hot
weather. Hare and Rabbits only were firm,
and the former were quoted higher. The bag
limit law was strictly enforced by the Game
Wardens and no dealer was allowed to handle
more than 50 birds.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Butter market la showing more steadi
ness and arrivals are working off better. There
were four steamers in with Supplies from Hum
boldt but they brought less than expected,
' henct? the better feelmg. There is no change
' in Cheese.' Kgge continue very firm, with fine

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. â¢
Fresh supplies of--frults-i from most ssctions
! arrived too late for the regular trade. Â¦ the
: trains and boats having bean delayed by the
fog. -The local demand was brisk, as usual on
Saturday, and carried over stock, which was
abundant, cleaned up w?U at about ' previous
prices. Strawberries that arrived late on the
preceding day wire sold to canners at the min
imum quotation, while fresh lots that came to
hand on the early express cleaned up well at
steady - rates. Raspberries arrived . late and
prices ranged lower. Cape Cod Cranberries
are well cleaned up, and as there are none ex
pected to arrive for aome time the market 1Â«
ttrm at $9 50 per bbl. Coos Bay lots are mov
ing ' more freely owing to the scarcity of the
Eastern goods. The Apple market was active,
but supplies were In excess of the demand and
there was no improvement in prices. 8 In fact;
nothing but fancy Spltzenbergs . brought the
top Â¦Â¦ quotation, Â¦ $1" being an' extreme for, all

liis latest exploit has netted him consid

1346 McAllister street, was entered early
Friday evening while the family was at

brooch, a lady's gold watch, an Elgin
silver watch and $10 in cash were carried
away. The daring theft took place be
tween 7 and S o'clock and an entrance
was effected through a side window. All
of the rooms in the upper portion of the
residence were ransacked. Detectives
have been detailed on the case and are

Ubiquitous Burglar Is Active.
ilarearet McKcnzle, who after almost
forty yean* service as a teacher In the
public schools of this city was in July,
lifOl. dismissed from the School Depart
ment after a trial by the Hoard of Edu
cation on charges preferred against her
by the parents of pupils attending the
Hancock Grammar School, of which she
was principal, was, in the opinion of
Judge Hebbard, illegally dismissed. In ac.
curdance with this opinion he issued a
â¢nit of review of the board"s proceedings,
thus riractlcaUy restoring her to her place
In the School Department and declaring
bcr entitled to about $0?0G In salary lost
l>y her by reason of her dismissal.
Judge Hebbard decides the case on two 1
points raised by Attorney S. V. Costello
lor the petitioner. The iirst was on the
la< k of jurisdiction of the board because
of the fact thut the charges against Miss
AIcKenzie were not preferred by the Su
perintendent of School*., as the charter
provides, and the second on the insuffi
ciency of evidence to prove the charge
against her of Incompetence. He sus
tains Costello's contention on both these
points, and la his opinion says:
APPUXS FOB WHIT.
The retitioner, Margaret McKenzie, vu a
teacher in the public ecIkxJs of San Francisco
from May. JS63. mull July, 1901. when the.
tlitn bein* the principal of the Hancock
Grammar School, was dismissed from the
fcH.hool l>ej>arimer.t by the defendant, the
i â¢ o : . of K<2ucatlon.
Petitioner now arplies to the court lor a
â¢ writ of ctrtiorarl annulling Bald proceedings; I
the board has made answer setting forth the
record Mifon which the dismissal was based,
end the pleadings are now eubmltted to the
crjurt for Judgment therein.
There are two questions involved:
1. Petitioner claims that the proceedinga
aptlnst her were not based upon any charge
Â«>r Â»harges. fomiaily or otherwise preferred by
tl;e Superintendent of Schools, as required by
eÂ»ct!on 1. subdivision 2, chapter 3, article VII
of the charter.
Her Mcond contention is that there was no
evidence be:cre the board whereon to base her
removal from the School Department. The so
called charges were In the form of communlca
tldns addrt-ssed to the board by parents and
i .. Â¦ ::^.> of pupils attend inc the Hancock
(irammar School, and were that the pupils of ,
thr eighth grade of that school had been will- !
lully and eroealy negrlected and Improperly '
taught; that the course in language, grammar \
nr.d iiiglisii had been esi>eclally neglected in .
ihat neither "Snowbound" cor "ThanatopslB"
had b*-^n taught them, and that monthly re
j^ns had not been received from the school
They further charged her with physical and
mental unfitness to teach, and with insubordi
nation and ur.profesFional conduct.
These charprs were not, apparently from the
rec> rd. investigated by the guperlntenJent of
t-'chix>Is. nor did he formally, or at all, make '
any chances against iH'titioner.
SUPERINTENDENT'S POSITION.
The position of the Superintendent, as shown
by the recrd, was that It any one desired to
prefer a charge or a complaint against a
teacher he would give the same consideration,
if made in compliance with the forms of his
c'nee.
The Superintendent evidently relied upon the
provisions of the charter as governing his con
duct in such matter.
Section 1. subdivision 2. chapter 3 of article
.All of the charter reads, in part, as follows
â¢Oiarges against teachers must be formally
made by the Superintendent after due investi
gation, and shall be finally passed upon by the
hoard after giving the accused teach* due
hearing."
The court must construe this language to
mean that the Superintendent himself must
first make investigation of the charges or com-
MÂ«int made by any one. and If he deems them
raffirient to warrant a trial of the accused
teacher by the board, then it would be his duty
to formally make and file the charges before
the board, and thereupon, and after a trial
the board may finally pass Judgment in the
matter.
Thif lr the plain meaning and intent of the
charter provision, and it is inconsistent with
no general law of the State nor with any rule
of the board.
Rut It Is certainly consistent with reason
and common wane, and no better Illustration
thereof could be givm than is presented bv
the record in this case. -
Margaret M'.Kf-nzie. aftor nearly forty yeare
of conscientious iab->r in the public schools of
thin city, is brought to trial upon some ram-
Ming charges cr neglect, slightly In detail
coupled with the grave accusation of insub
ordination, unprofefsior.al conduct and physical
Â«n.1 mental unfitnefs to teach, uttered In the
most general terms.
The evidence taken at the trial proves ab
solutely nothing of all these things charged
CEoept that there was some testimony given to
ft,* effect that some of the other teachers of
the Hsncnck School d!d not have '"Snowbound"
â¢ r.<5 "ThKnatopsis" rtad to or by the pupils
every day. but that â¢â¢FIvant.-eline" and "Chrls
r.:a* Carols" were rÂ»ad. and that some of the
pupils of tV eighth rrade. composed mostly
of children of foreign yarents. failed to pass
exMr.lntaion for promotion.
EVIDENCE FAVORS TEACHER.
The great bulk of (he evidence taken Is to
the tfTect thai Mi!=s McKenzie was a competent
and reliable teacher and ought not to have
l*<i dismissed from the department.
Tl.is must have berr. the opinion of the Pu
prinun.i'r.1. for whatever testimotTy was
plven bjr him at this hearing was favorable to
J!'*f lIcKcnxle.
. Yet thÂ«> boerd rroc^dod to try this teacher
w.ihout th* sanction of the Superintendent and
to pass Judgment upon her that Bhe be cj|Â«- i
misjfd from the Fchoo] Department, which
judgment necessarily carried with jt the loss
nf salary, the loss of her Interest in and enjoy
ment of the annuity fund provided for the '
veteran teachers of the department aft"r their I
retirement, as w. II as the ignominy which such
JuHgnicnt would cast ui>on her generally in the I
public estimation.
The court Is of the cpinion that had the rule
cf the charter b><-n enforced! by the board these
unfortunate r'-sults would never have hap
|*>ncd.
TIk- Hu perintendent could and would have
Snwstipat*^! theÂ«e complaints (I think he did)
Â¦nd. not considering them worthy of the basis
of formal charges, would have made none; the
iKirirri would have been saved the trouble of
the investigation *r.d the error of Its rulings,
end prfiHonfr would have been spared all this
unhapplnei-s.
The reason for the rule of the charter re
quiring Investigation and the preferring of
â¢ hargps sgainst a teacher by the Superintendent
is demonstrated acutely by the record In this
case.
The Beard of Education never had jurisdic
tion to try petitioner * n <l th Â« record shows that
ll had no reason tri convict her.
!>>t <be writ Issue as prayed.
Holds That Evidence Did Not
Justify Her Removal
From School.
Judge Hebbard Says Her
Dismissal by Board
Was Illegal.

Other breeds In Her Majesty's kennels
are Danes, Scotch deerhounds, collies,
rough and smooth Bassett hounds, grey
hounds, bulldogs galore, whippets, pugs,
spaniels and terriers. In spite of the fact
that he Is no longer strictly a "fashion
able" dog. Her Majesty, clings to her love
of the great Dane and has him in her pos
session to the number of half-a-dozen.
Her Majesty's recent photograph, here
with publishea, shows her with the dog
she has most frequently with her. 'It
is a beautiful little Pekinese spaniel, a
graceful, fluffy creature, more like a ball
of flossy silk than anything so' determined

It '3 eald that on an average half .the
Queen'p dogs are presented to her. The
other half she buys and the attendant
cost cf keeping up the kennels is esti
mated at not less than $5000 a year.
Having teen how the Queen gets her
dogs and where she keeps them, one thing
remains to be told. Where does she bury
them? Not In the plebeian dog cemetery
adjacent to Hyde Park, frequented by
such common folk as Dukes and Duch
esses, Lords and Ladies, but in a royal
burylng-ground of their own within the
LONDON, Oct 17.â ThÂ» Qoeea of
England owns more dogs than
any other woman In the realm,
and cut of her canine family ehe
recognizes more than fifty as
frleafis. Where ordinary people buy dog
biscuit fcy the box or by the dozen Queen
Alexandra buys them In ten-ton lots and
is manifestly one of the best patrons of
the purveyors of this delicacy. To every
2000 person* In England there are thirty
eight dogs, but in this respect Her Majes
ty has a truly royal advantage over the
average Inhabitant. The Duchess of
Newcastle and Her Grace of Bedford
follow the Queen close as seconds, but
.even these celebrated dog fanciers do not
approach in number the collection of
canines owned by the Queen of England.
- Now, although tbÂ« King teases the
Queen about her numerous pets he is
really ts fond and as proud of
them as she !a. and It la large
ly owing to a suddenly developed
affection on Edward VII's part that
the earre fieg. "Ecottle" by name,
%vÂ£.s rot tent to Â£t_ Petersburg as
the Queen first intended. She and the
King came upon "Scottie," a wiry lron-
ETay terrier, when yachting off the west
eciist cf Scotland. The Queen's answer
to the King's QueBtlon was: "I think I
ehall give it to Minnie"â "Minnie" being
r.o lesa a person than Her Imperial
Majesty, the Dowager Empress of Rus
e'.a. But In spite of his banter. King
Edward grew to like "Scottie" as well as
the Queea did and does. So "Minnie"
never got the dog. The Dowager Em
press shares Queen Alexandra's love for
animals as do most of the royal ladies
cf Europe, the future Queen of England,
now Princess of Wales, being one of the
exceptions.
Queen Alexandra is considered by pro
fessional Cog-breeders to be far ahead of
the average woman in point of common
tense. In this day of Jeweled collars, fur
coats, pocket handkerchiefs and night
gowns as necessities for dog wear. Queen
Alexandra remains free from such affec
tation. The King dislikes the idea of
dressing up the little animals and Her
Majesty Is said simply to loathe the ab
surdities of the fashion.

It fs not in this land of cere

such oddly, named offices, to find that Her
Majesty^ has artists, as It; were; in wait
ing to immortalize â¢â¢with the brush 'Â¦Â¦ the
beauties ' of such bulldog celebrities ; as

Fortunately, there have been few addi

since ' Alexandra became Queen, so, the
tombstones all bear the name of the then
Princess of rtVales." Â¦
One of the Queen's most practical tri
butes to the love of dogs is the member
uhip in the Ladies' Kennel Club. This is

canines often In attendance on Her
Majesty, who is said to like them because
they have such nice table manners and
are rarely greedy. A certain blue whip
pet, the cleverest of greyhounds In mini
ature. Is also beloved of tbe Queen.
It Is, however, as bulldog expert that
Her Majesty has most recently come be
fore the public. She appeared this Beason
for the first time as an exhibitor at the
twenty-ninth show of the Bulldog Club.

possible, took all the prices in sight
Their skulls were the biggest and squar

noses most finely turned up and blunted.
"Paul" is the son of "Peter." the King's
favorite dog at Sandringham.
Of the dozens of dogs the Queen owns,
most reside at Sandringham. Kennels
quite elaborate enough for the housing of
men and women occupy a, fine spot on
tbe Sandringham estate, not far fram the
house itself. A score of servants do noth
ing but attend to the Queen's kennels.
The sanitation of the doghouses is per
fect. Her Majesty visits them while in
residence at Sandrlneham with clock-like
regularity every morning after breakfast.
She will have no regal preparation mado
for her visits (such as carpets on' the
kennel steps), or any care taken which
reduces the feeling of professionalism
with which the Queen endeavors to breed

half-a-dozen other entertaining things.
So averse Is Queen Alexandra to the
foolish display of dog worship that she
teldom takes even her most precious pets
with her when walking or driving. The
dogs always In residence with Her
Majesty are given dally exercise by the
grooms. This eight may be Been in the

A season of six weeks of Italian opera
will be a feature in Paris beginning next
May. Once Paris had its regular Theatre
Italien, devoted to performances of opera
in Italian and supported by the best lyric
artists that could be secured, but latterly
this form of musical art has not flour
ished in Paris. As an odd circumstance
it may be noted that the Parisians look
forward as to a novelty to the perform
ances of Boito's "Mefistofele" and Pon
chielli's "Gioconda," neither of which
has been given at the Opera.
Marie Geistinger, the comic opera singer
and actress who died recently in Austria,
once the reigning operatic star in Vienna
and also favored by Offenbach for the
spirit with which she sang some of his
sprightly music, was equally successful
in comedy and tragedy. She toured the
United States as late as 1S97. â¢
On September 13 seventy-five years had
elapsed since the arrival in Berlin of a
young man who was destined to revolu
tionize pianoforte music â Frederic Chopin,
at that time 20 years old. His father had
sent him to Berlin in charge of Professor
Jarocki, and the trip from Warsaw by
stage had taken five days. He remained
in the city two weeks, and never had
occasion to return to it. He had oppor
tunities, however, to meet Mendelssohn,
Spontini, Zelter and other prominent mu
sicians of â¢ the time during his brief so
journ. The music he heardâ Handel's "St.
Cecilia," Spontini's "Cortez," Cimarosa'a
"Secret Wedding," etc. â has long since
disappeared from the repertory. Thera
were many thlnes abo.ut Berlin which he
liked, but the women he did not admire
at all. "It Is not true," he wrote to his
sister, "that the Berlin women dress with
taste; undoubtedly they like to adorn
themselves,' but I am sorry for the beau
tiful material wasted on such puppets."
thoven is the nucleus around
which the works of other authors will be
gathered, but there are novelties. A sym
phony by Witkowski will be given for the
first time. Two symphonies, respectively
by Dukas and Guy Ropartz, will be heard;
also the four symphonies of Schumann,
tha last five by Mozart, the fourth of
Brahms and the second of Borodine.
Among the symphonic poems will be two
by Liszt, the "Preludes" and "Orphee"
and "Death and Transfiguration," by
Richard Strauss. The second orchestral
suite on "Namouna" will be revived.
Wagner will be represented by the third
act, in concert form, of "Die Gotterdam
merung." Berlioz will be remembered by
"The Damnation of Faust" and "Sym
phonle Fantastique." The modern school
will be represented by works of Breville,
Busser, Erlanger, Le Borne, Lavade and
Lutz. Among those who are engaged are
Van Dyck, Hugo Hermann, Felix Wein
gartner, De Greef, Hubermann and Mes
dames Jeanne Raunay, Katchowska and
Taliero-Delacroz.
THERE Is some richness in the an
nouncements for the Lamou
reux concerts in Paris, to be
conducted by Chevillard. Bee-
Mascagni will need to look to his laurels
as the man at work on the most master
pieces at one time. Edmund Rostand is

they so willed it some of the most hard

San Francisco wept like watering carts.
I went out to see the aggregation and
know whereof I speak. In a chair near
me sat a man, CO years old if a day,
known in several clubs for an inordinate
thirst, a politician, a man of business,
â¢who would balk at an Intimation that ha
had any sentiment. From his eyes, in the
death scene in "Lady Bountiful," a little
ealty moisture stole. Presently it oozed
with accumulating volume. It salted a
nose that long ago reddened into fast and
imperishable ruddiness. It slid down his
cheeks and dropped like a glass bead upon
his otherwise immaculate raiment. The
three rainmakers had turned the faucet.
Monday evening was a great time for
the lachrymal glands. Damsels pulled out
enough handkerchiefs to convey the Im
pression .that they were preparing to give
the newcomers in the stock company an
innocuous Chautauqua salute. But the
truth is that the girls all came with the
jileasing anticipation of having a delicious
cry. The rainmakers furnished the op-
I>ortunity and excuse and the audience did
the rest.
The rainmakers axe of three radically
different physical types, and their men

Frances Starr has not the air of com

mental make-up. Her eyes are blue.

THE dramatic event of the week
was the advent of three rainmak

command of the emotions of the

to discuss the probability or lack of prob

Frances Starr confesses to being just
20. She does not look, off the stage, to fie
a day older. One might guesa 18. When
asked for definite information she said
simply and without annoyance that she
was 20 years old. â¢
Miss Block is a Bostoniin and made her
dt:but in "The Girl I Left Behind Me :> as
Kate Kf nnion. She played three years in
Albaugh's stock company at Baltimore,
at the Grand Opera-house stock in New
Orleans and the Davidson stock theater in
Milwaukee. She was with E. H. Sothern
one season at Daly's Theater in New
York in "The King's Musketeer" and
"The Song of the Sword." Then she
played as Iras, the Egyptian girl, in
"Ben Hur" at the Broadway Theater.
New York. She has been Glory Quayle In
"The Christian" and was leading woman
with Henrietta Crcsman, during which
time she appeared in "The Sword of the
King" and "Mistress Nell" and Celia In
"As You Like It." Miss Block says that
her preliminary training was at Wheat
croft's Dramatic School in New York.
Her favorite role is that of Maslova in
"Resurrection."
Miss Starr says that she first appeared
with an Albany stock company four
years ago. She then went 'to New York
as ingenue in the Murray Hill stock com
pany, then before a San Francisco au
dience at the Alcazar.
"I am an only child," she eays. "My
father Is dead. I felt, like any girl, that
I would like to do something to support
myself. I started In the Bond stock com
pany with a small part In Albany, in
which city I was born. Before going Into
the stock company I had appeared in two
amateur plays.
"But here I am talking about myself.
I do not like to do that, for it sounds ego
tistical. After the engagement at Albany
I went to Frohman's stock company in
New York. I was three years with the
Murray Hill stock company. You see
there is nothing to tell."
In the comparatively short experience
of Miss Starr she has played as Phyllis
Lee in "The Charity Ball," as the horsey
girl In "Hearts Aflame," as Wilbur's Ann
in "The Girl I Left Behind Me," Lisbeth
in "In Mizzoura," Sybil in "The Dancing
Girl," Simplicity Johnson In "Lovers'
Lane." Lydia Languish In "The Rivals"
and as "Jane Eyre."
It was Interesting to hear the three
principal actors in the cast discuss the
Lady Bountiful death scene. They calm
ly dissected various phases of Pinero's
play. Seldom is a chance afforded for
such frank expressions for the benefit of
the public that never goes behind the
scenes. ,
Miss Starr, who as Margaret dies on
the stage, said quite simply and directly
that she was always affected by the death
scene. She was frequently moved to real
tears by it. It produces fatigue from
which she would suffer if she were not
naturally robust.
She believes, she says, that the audi
ence prefers to be sorrowful. Sad books
catch the popular fancy. Sad scenes on
the stage bring out the deepest applause.
The deepest weeper is â the matinee girl!
She best likes to cry!

A correspondent of the New York Mall
and Express describes a Bayreutn audi
ence, in an unconventional way, but the
sketch may be pleasing to readers. Omit
ting any discussion of the musical fea
ture, the writer says that a feeling of awe
crept over him even before the opera be
gan. "And how the audience contrasts
with a Metropolitan gathering. It has
truthfully, been said that the courts of
Europe could not summon more splendor
and wealth than the Â¦ Metropolitan on a
gala night. /At Bayreuth only a low. mur

topic being ; the opera itselfâ whether

Ternina is the best Kundry, and the like.
Then he throws** himself down beside
his dead wifa and his head is on the ta-
The wife has changed her position. The
"sleep deeper than sleep" is upon her.
Her outstretched hand falls rigidly on the
table beside her and remains motionless.
Her face becomes drawn and dead. The
irrevocable facial change has never been
more closelv mimed.
Donald goes to her swiftly and touches
her hand.
"Mag," he says, hoarsely; "Mag, don't
leave me like this."
The wife looks on and smiles. The hus
band talks cheerily to the baby about
the better days to soon come to them all.
He is absorbed in this talkâ and In smok
ing! frA
"How loud the clock ticks!" he sud
denly exclaims.
Then the final scene between the hus
band and wife is prepared and moves for
ward. There is some preliminary conver
sation that leads toward the climax. The
pillows are rearranged in the chair for
the comfort of the wife. She will He there
and hear Donald talk to the baby, she
says. He will sit where she can see him.
From the programme the audience knows
that there is a death scene. But Donald
must get a pipe to smoke while he talks
to the baby. Lighting a pipe is slow
work. Finally Donald sits by the cradle
and turns it so that the baby can see a
clock that has suddenly begun a very
loud tickinc.
She takes from her own neck a costly
chain and locket and places the chain
around the neck of the baby for a keep
sake. She has added about all the gloom
she can to the situation so far as mak
ing a mental condition for the audience
is concerned.
"Often I have a sleep that is not really
a sleep," she eays brokenly. "It may
be some time so deep that when they
come to me I shall not wake up." \
Lady Bountiful kisses her, takes tha
letter, then devotes herself to the new
baby in the cradle.
The wife, who has been ill for some
weeks, "Is to come downstairs to-day for
the first time." The bankrupt and feeble
father of the bride, an old and broken
man, disappointed with the world, says
in a shaking voice that "it will bo like
old times." The tearful mother of the
wife and the hero-husband perform all
the premonitory/ little offices of love to
make the room more cheerful for the.In
valid. They procure the favorite roses
from their scanty funds. They place fruit
In a dish. The scanty cushions of the
house are gathered and tucked and patted
to make the chair the wife is to sit in
seem the softer.
When all is ready the husband brings
in the wife in his athletic arms and
places her in the' cushioned chair. The
family welcome her. The Lady Bounti
ful enters. She disposes of the husband
and the others by scnaing them away for
a time and so leaves tne way clear for
contributing her large share to the at
mosphere of foreboding.
The eick wife has been jealous of her.
Still is, although she declares to the con
trary. She must have the Lady Bounti
ful in her rich attire and in the bloom of
health stand before her that she may,
even In this time of illness, see why Lady
Bountiful had been loved by her hus
band in his earlier days. She draws the
Lady Bountiful to her, feverishly con
fesses her jealousy, writes a letter to her
husbandâ which she reads aloud to the
audienceâ to be given to him by the Lady
Bountiful in the event of. "her own death.
In this ghe writes that no shadow of her
is to come between the husband and Lady
Bountiful when she is dead.
cumstance in the death scene in "Lady
Bountiful" is that the surroumlings all
indicate poverty. The hero, who was
reared in affluence, has turned his back
to Lady Eountiful and has married, from
a 6ense of duty, a poor girl, the daughter
of a riding master. To them a child Is
born.
"Simply because," said the young lady
with the blue eyes, "my hand was cold
and rigid when I let it fall on the table."
In this Is the argument for and against
the lines of Pinero, or it may be the edict,
of the stage manager for what appears.
The point has not been lost on the audi
ences of the week. The element of prob
ability in this regard may now form a
theme for some after-theater discussionâ
thereby prolonging the agony!
Do actresses haunt hospitals to study
death scenes? How did Miss Starr learn
how to counterfeit reality In death so
grimly?
"I have never seen any one die," she
said. "If my face really looks dead on
the stage I am glad of It! I never studied
death, but I think of it a great deal."
More disquieting to the public, to whom
sham is made to seem so actual by the
stage people, may be the fact that Mr.
Durkin and Miss Block, who appear on the
stage to have been long-time lovers, dif
fer radically in opinion as to Whether
Donald was really in love with Lady
Bountiful at first.
"I don't think that he was," saya Miss
Block decidedly.
"Yes, he was," says Mr. Durkin with
equal decision.
"Then why did he not return to the
old life when she invited him?"
"He wished to go. He couldn't then,
for it was too late, for he 'had promised
to marry Margaret."
"Then he never loved Margaret?"-'
"Yes, he really loved her." [
"Then," inquires Lady Bountiful, "how
could he ever have married Lady Bounti
ful after the death of Margaret?".
"He has been away for years. Seeing
her In the old chapel, where as children
they had knelt together, the influence of
the old time was on him and the old love
for her took possession of him strongly."
Lady Bountiful is silenced, but does
not look convinced.
"And what fiay you, Miss Starr; how
could the husband so soon conclude that
you were deadâ just by touching your
hand once?"
Darkness falls suddenly on the scene.
Darkness and 'then a fiasn of light, then
darkness and momentary light alternat
ing for a few seconds, and then the cur
tain finally falls on the scene.
"It is wrong." says Mr. Durkin, the
husband in this scene. "It is not nat
ural. The first Impulse of the husband
under the circumstances would be to call
for assistance. The next would be to find
out whether the wife that he loved was
really dead. He would not take It so
easily for granted. Oh, yes, he loved his
wife at the end, although he did not at
the beginning. He had learned to love
her. He was grieved at her death, deep
ly BO."

The lack of a love story in the poem has

The Chicago Chronicle tells of three
young European musicians who have

greatly astonished and did not believe

The version of "Old Heidelberg" In
which. Richard Mansfield Is appearing in
New York as Prince Karl Helnrich is the
same that ran In England and on the
Continent. It is in five acts. The role of
Mansfield is that of a Prince who after a
youth choked with the etiquette and
fiunkeyism of a small court, having com
pleted his education, goes to Heidelberg
to take a doctor's degree and enjoy a
breath of life. Here he falls in love with
a fraulein, and sentiment and comedy rise
out of the # romance. One scene prepared
fcr the New York production shows Heid
elberg with the colorful life of the stu
dent corps. Nearly one hundred students
appear, and the action is enlivened with
the old German songs of the unlverslty
men.

De Wolf Hopper is arranging material
for a little volume, so says the Chicago

landlord. "In the book, which will be en.
titled 'Landlords Who Have Met Me,' he
will give some important recipes for one
night stand coffee, and various rules and
regulations for proper conduct in hotels
in small towns which have been impressed
upon his mind. The Pullman porter comes
in for a share of description under the
general title of 'landlord.' Slippery elm
towels, the unerring whisk broom and
early morning calls are mentioned among
the Joys of life in a Pullman car."
Where are all the diamonds, fusa and
feathers characteristic of a New York
audience? They are conspicuous by their
absence. The vast throng is composed of
music lovers assembled to drink in every
note, and not that they may be seen.
Many a poor student has denied himself
or herself the necessities of life to be able
to realize the ambition of hearing Wag

but they are all perfectly happy and
greedy to hear every word and note. The
opera may be staged as well, possibly
even super as well, in New York, but
Manhattan cannot hope to reproduce "the
atmosphere of the place and the crowd."

ONE of the local parlors, N. D. G.
W., has come to the conclusion that
the old saying, "Figures do not
lie," may be correct, but that they are
sometimes confusing. There was a charge
some time ago that the figures presented
at tho present session of the Grand Par
lor as to the accounts of the order were
not as they should be and a motion was
made that the grand treasurer be asked
to furnish "the correct figures." Tho
Krand treasurer did furnish a statement,
but it proved a confusion of figures, so
confusing that it was thought best to
return them with a request for a further
explanation. The figures that were pre
sented at the Grand Parlor showing the
financial condition of the Grand Parlor
were from the report of Grand Treasurer
Hammerly and were adopted by that
body.

lor No. 123, Gabrielle Gress and Sadie

on behalf of the parlor by the president
thereof. This was followed by a patriotic
song by Mrs. Bates, a reading by Ollie

cret was of the vigor, the spirit aM the

wicked-looking worsted or walking sol
emnly In the garden gathering rose
leaves constituted the exciting exercise
of her times! No wonder, she fainted
when a suitable occasion presented Itself
or ran off with the coachman Just for the
exhilaration caused; by the resultant ex
citement. Women have a need of a cer
tain amount of excitement in their livesâ
which are necessarily . more or less pro
saic or stupidâ and what . they obtain
from . a rational Indulgence \ in athletics
fulfills the requirement created within
them by the Heavenly Father And here
with let .the temperance workers take no
ticeâthe more athletics the fewer cock
tails. *Let those censors of society who
cry out against the encroachment of evil
of drink In social circles advocate the
promotion of open air athletics; and the
normal craving of women for excitement
will be assuaged without resort to false
and harmful stimulants. This is a de
duction made by physiciansâ they who
share women's secrets as do no othersâ
and surely their deduction is Indisputable.

The War Department denies the report
that the transport Sheridan, on which
ten young officers and their bonny brides
will sail for Manila, is to be decorafed
with tulle and Bride rosesâ and the rea
son offered is plain. An even distribution
of tulle and roses would not be compati
ble with the varying rank of the young
people. ' and an attempt to apportion the
decorations according to rank wouldn't
be nice, you know; but the department
has gone out- of Its way to recognize the
affair in a suitable manner, and has pro
vided a caÂ»se of rice and an equipment of
old shoes for the embarkation of the
bridal party, and friends will find the
same on the wharf on the day of sailing.

of the disillusionizing of the vaporous
