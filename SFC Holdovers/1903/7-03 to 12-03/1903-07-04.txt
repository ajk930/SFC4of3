NEW. YORK; July 3.â Attacked by an
infuriated "tried" bear, which he had ex
hibited in public thousands of times and
believed to be tame. WtllUm Winscher
mann, an animal trainer, would have
been killed this morning in a stable in
West Eighteenth street had not help
promptly reached him. It was only after
a desperate battle that the animal was
driven with iron bars from the prostrate
form of its master.
Wlnschermann owns several bears,
which he has trained. He went to the
stable to greet his pets. All seemed glad
to see him except Tony, a big cinnamon.
The animal was ma bad mood, but Wln
schermann paid no heed and took him
from a barrel box, in which he was kept,
to give him a bath. Tony growled omi
nously during this proceeding, but showed
no disposition to attack his master until
Winschermann chained him to his cage
irfid gave him. a piece of sugar. As the
trainer turned to walk away Tony leaped
upon him.
In an instant the giant animal had
forced him to the - floor and began lo
claw him. -The only person near was
George Griffiths, son of the owner of the
stable. Seizing an iron. bar, he made a
dash at the beast. With a swing of its
paws the bear knocked the bar from his
grasp and again attacked Winschermann.
With angry growls he tore at his master,
inflicting terrible lacerations on his arms,
legs and chest.
j By this time the street was thronged
with an excited crowd. Good fortune
seemed to favor Griffiths, for he managed
to land half a dozen powerful blows upon
the bear's head, temporarily stunning the
animal. Several other stablemen who
had been attracted by the uproar dragged
Winschermann to safety. 'Policeman
Hanifby summoned Dr. Thorne from" the

was taken to the institution. -His condi
tion Is critical. Winschermann is 36 years

HAY MAY RETIRE.
Secretary of State Said to Be Weary
.of Diplomacy!
NEW YORK, July 3.-A Washington
special to the; press says:
Unless there is a-deflnite clearing up of
the diplomatic situation in its relation to
Russian affairs, it will not be surprising
if ths present Secretary of State, . John
Hay, . retires from the Cabinet. Retire
ment was hinted at in different directions
to-day.
In the absence from the city of Hay
and all of his Cabinet associates it . was
impossible 'to obtain either affirmation or
denial of the suggested step. It has been
realized for a long time that Hay has
had a distinct and, definite ambition In
closing out his public career, arid that it
is to prevent the 1 partition of China. and
to get an arrangement which would make
such a division of the empire Impossible
for many years,, or, if divided,, would in
sure to the United States a perpetual open
door. . : . ...
Hay has told his friends he believed fu
ture generations would bless him ' more
for securing a, permanent open-door in
the Far East' thari^ anything it would be
possible forhlm to do in his public career.
Hay took a radical departure from the
methods of diplomacy followed"*by public
men of this country when he announced
this open door policy. Since that time he
has led in .many, things. In all.negotiaT
tlons in the Far East he has sought to
make his- pronouncement prophetic ;it
Is understood; here -that 'the President did
not consult Hay, before, letting the official

He was removed to the Emergency Hos
pital, where his wound, consisting of a
slight abrasion of the scalp, was dressed.
According to Dowahly he was walking
along the street when he felt a stinging
sensation and putting his hand to the
back of his head, -he found that the blood
was flowing. A crowd Immediately gath
ered around the man and a panic was
narrowly averted. Finally he was re
moved to the Emergency Hospital.
There were many people passing at th<Â»
time and numbers of them were firing off
pistols. It is thought that one of them
fired a blank cartridge close to Dowahly's
head and that the wad hit him.

TACOMA. Wash.. July 3.â The settle
ment of the coal miners' strike at Lady
smith and Cumberland, Vancouver Island,
adds another to the long list of victories
which James Dunsmuir has achieved over
his colliery employes. Last winter the
representatives of the Western Federation
of Miners, having headquarters at Denver
and Butte, succeeded in organizing unions'
among the Vancouver Island miners. The
organization was no sooner perfected
than a strike was ordered, it being be
lieved that the miners could at last win
their fight against Dunsmuir.
Promises of assistance were made by
the Western Federation of Miners, but
the assistance rendered when the pinch
came was only a tithe of that expected.
When the miners and their families were
hungry and implored aid from Denver
they were given a thousand dollars when
they expected ten or fifteen. The miners
finally became disgusted and have now
gone back to work at Dunsmulr's terms.
They will leave the Federation of Miners
to fight Its own battles. The first train
was operated this morning for nearlyfour
months and carried the Ladysmlth min
ers out to the coal pits.
The Western Fuel Company of San
Francisco will reopen the Harwood mine,
which has been closed down for more
than a year. President Howard says
that the competition of fuel oil has about
reached the limits of its field. Ho antici
pates a very busy season* for all the Van
couver Island collieries.

VIENNA. July 3.â Medical circles her*
are greatly interested In a report, com

Physicians, and read at a recent meeting
of the Imperial Academy of Science, to
the effect that a long-standing case of
cancer was cured by radium rays at the
clinic of the late Professor Gussenbauer.
The patient, who was 61 years of ase. had
long- suffered from cancer of the palate
and lip and had repeatedly been operated
upon fruitlessly. In the autumn of 1902.
when the physicians of the Viennese Hos
pital declared it was absolutely useless
to operate again, one physician deter
mined as a last resort to try radium
rays and treated the afflicted parts by ex
posing them to the light of radium bro
mide, the strongest radium preparation in
existence. He was rewarded by a grad
ual and complete disappearance of tha
tumors.

R. G. Dun & Company's Weekly Re
view 'of Trade to-morrow will say:
A new lineal year has commenced under
more favorable auspices than appeared
possible a short time ago, the Im
provement being due In no. small
measure to the. greater conserva
tism that was an , outgrowth of
unsettled conditions. Seasonable weather
has also contributed to the better distri
bution of merchandise, besides encour
aging buoyant sentiment in the agrlcul
tural districts. Railway earnings and the
output of pig Iron were larger, while In
! solvencies were fewer. Earnings of, rail-':
ways thus far> reported for June surpass
last year's by 10 per cent, an<J those of
1901 by 19.1 per cent. %
More .inquiries for pig. iron have ap
peared and although the actual contracts
*re for comparatively - small - quantities,
Foreign iron and steel are apparently
out of the market to stay. . Hardware Is
in better demand, though not as good as
a year ago, but manufacturers- arc re
ported, to have agreed to maintain prices
at last year'B rates. Copper is weak, with
rumored sales at one-quarter cent re

NEW YORK, July 3.â Bradstreet's to
jnorrow will say:'
Warm, forcing weather has been the
keynote of the situation this week, induc
ing favorable conditions for the winter
wheat harvest, special progress by^corn
and cotton, enlargement in retail trade in
summer goods, generally heretofore back
ward, and, which is most important of
all, bringing about a mueh more cheer
ful feeling as to the future outlook for
business generally.
Additional reports as to six months'
trade are more favorable, despite earlier
unfavorable conditions. June bank clear
ings, though aided by stock, grain and
cotton speculation, large semi-annual dis
bursements and the pulling through of
large dealingf*, have not been wholly de
pendent thereon for the marked expan
sion shown last year. Failure returns are
likewise favorable. In that six months'
embarrassments were the smallest in
number reported in twenty years, though
a comparatively few large suspensions,
widely separated and generally unre
lated to each othrr, swelled liabilities 5
per cent above these last year. Gener
ally speaking, the second half of the year
opens auspiciously.
A slight decrease in sugar, designed tp
encourage backward demand, is noted.
Yellow pine and white pine lumber is
weaker at tho Wc-st, but unchanged at
the East, while hardwoods are generally
firmly held.
Aflde from the continuance oft the.
slightly better feeling noted in iron , and
steel last week, developments are fe*?.\
New buying is still small, though better
than for some weeks past. Better crop
reports and the placing of large rail or
ders for next year are a source of con
fidence.

of slackening speed at the crossing, ran
on and crashed into the other car. When
it was seen that a collision was imminent
the passengers became panic-stricken.
The impact was so violent that the Olive
street car was hurled completely over on
its side and all the passengers piled in a
heap. All the injured were taken In am

ETROIT, July 3.â "This confer
once declares itself in favor of
maintaining the historical Sab
bath as a fundamental institution
of Judaism and of exerting every
effort to improve Its observance and In
struct the executive committee to appoint
a special commission to study methods of
carrying this Into effect-"
The Central Conference of American
Rabbis placed itself on record on the
Sabbath question to-day by the adoption
of the above amendment to the report of
the Sabbath commission on the question:
"What is our attitude on the Sabbath
question?"
The officers v were also ekcted this after
noon, all business was transacted and the
conference adjourned sine die.
The Sabbath question was taken up at
the forenoon session after several com
mittee reports had been disposed of and a
telegram ordered sent to President
Roosevelt congratulating him on hia de
cision to forward the resolutions of the
Society of B'nai B'rith to the Czar and
thanking him for it. Rabbi Voorsanger
of San Francisco, the chairman of the
commission, Introduced the commission's
sub-report, which the conference ordered
last Wednesday after the first report had
been declared too lengthy and not posi
tive enough in Its answers to the seven
questions It was organized to report upon.
Dr. Sllverman turned over the chair to
the secretary after the report had been
read and offered as a substitute for the
commission's reply to the first question
the statement that was adopted this aft
ernoon, favoring the maintenance of the
historical Sabbath. He declared that the
commission's report vras a mere begging
of .the question and stated with great pos
itiveness that the conference must at this
time declare itself in unmistakable terms
on this Sabbath question.
When the vote was taken Dr. Silver
man's amendment was adopte<l_by a vote
of 2S to 9. Dr. Voorsanger, Dr. Phlllpson
and several others who voted no wished
to have it made clear that in so voting
they were not opposed to the historical
Sabbath, but were merely upholding the
commission's attitude on the question.
Consideration of the rest of the Sabbath
commission's report was then postponed
until next year. The following officers
were elected:
Honorary president. Dr. K. Kohler of
New York, president-elect Ct the Hebrew
Union College at Cincinnati.
President, Joseph Krauskopf of Phila
delphia.
â¢Vice presidents, Joseph Stolz of Chi
cago, Dr. J. Voorsanger of San Francisco.
Treasurer, Charlrs L-vi of Peoria, 111.
Corresponding secretary, W. Rosenau
of Baltimore. . *

The Tyfold Collar
The picture shows how the
collar is cut out on each side
to allow for adjusting a neck
tie without springing the col-
lar open. Tiie collar comes
close together in front, it keeps
the tie in place and you don't
see the cut-out part. Besides
the tie is retained just over the
button, which is also kept out of sight.
Your summer comfort will be increased
if you wear one, and you'll thank tS
for the style. Dealers sell them.

ACTIVE OPERATION.
The present concerted movements on the
part of two wide agencies of the Govern
ment of the United States can only take
place once in ten years. While this is go
ing the annual report of the California
State Mlneralogist-is held back until all
the authentic returns, gathered by the
Government, shall be in and available.
The result of this delay ought. to be that
the next annual report of the State Min
eralogist shall be just the one, of all
others to be sent to the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 for
the benefit of California.
The date for gathering the mining cen
sus statistics for the Government and the
coincident preparations for making a min
eral show of California mining resources
come happily together. This is perceived
by officials and is. appreciated by the
California Commissioners to St. Louis.
Supplementary to the fine display of Cali
fornia minerals and California oils that
will be made in the mining building at St.
Louis will be the accurate statistics now
In preparation.
In California has always kept its affairs
Eecret as far as possible. The advantage
of having the State credited with its full
mineral output is too important to need
explanation except in a general way.
For development outside capital is
needed, which is attracted easily or other
wfse In accordance not only with the
proven merits of any particular mine, but
also on account of the reputation of the
section for being rich ln mines and min
ing. . .
The fact that the squadron will meet on
the Marion and have its officers installed
on board a man of war delights the mem
bers of the organization, who expect to
have at least' 100 in the parade of the
Grand Armr.
The following officers will be installed:
Captain. Charlea Edelraan. commanding, a.
veteran of the volunteer navy, 18U1-5, on board
in crther ways during the Grand
Army National Encampment In this city.
The newly elected officers of the squadron
will be installed next Monday evening on
board the U. S. S. Marion. The ceremony
is scheduled for 8 o'clock and all those
who are eligible are invited to witness the
installation ceremony and remain for the
reunion and smoker, which will be given
on board the Marion after the ceremony.
Those eligible to membership are of
ficers and enlisted men who were in the
service from 1S61 to 18G5; also those who
were in the service during the Spanish-
American war, including the United
States regular navy, volunteer navy, ma
rine corps, revenue cutter service and the
naval militia in active service during
those periods. The squadron ls a branch
of the parent organization with headquar
ters at Cincinnati and was recently or
ganized in this city for the purpose of
bringing the naval veterans closer to
gether and to promote friendship, loyalty
and fellowship among the men who serv
ed the flag on sea during war times.

there is some question concerning the en

they have understated the total mineral

The significance to the public in these

KING EDWARD'S tour through Portugal,
Italy and France has set European authori
ties to guessing what could have been the
diplomatic motive that prompted it. Among the
suggestions offered by way of explanation there are
of course many relating to the British desire to get
possession . of the Portuguese territory adjoining
British South Africa; to the much discussed ar
rangement with France for the settlement of the
Morocco question, and to arrangements with Italy
in relation to her African interests. Such sugges
tions afford nothing new in the way of diplomatic
speculation, and are of comparatively little interest,
but there remains one that has at any rate the
charm of novelty. It is to the effect that the Brit
ish Government desires to make an important deal
with Spain and has sought in Portugal, Italy and
France for support for the proposition. ' A;
The deal is nothing less than an exchange of the
formidable and famous, rock of Gibraltar for the isl
and of Minorca. Whether such a project is really
under consideration by the British Ministry or not,
it has given rise to a considerable discussion in both
the British and the Continental press. The argu
ment is that Spain would be well pleased to ex
change a small island which is of little value to her
for a fortress whose possession by a foreign power
has always been a source of irritation to Spanish
pride and patriotism. On the other hand, Britain
would find Minorca so much more advantageous for
her purposes than Gibraltar that her Government
would be glad to make the trade, notwithstanding
the enormous amount of money that has been ex
pended to make the great rock the strongest
fortress in the world.
The argument for the exchange on the British
side is that Gibraltar, while a strong fortress, has

Whether Bryan has brains enough to profit by the
lesson remains to be seen. It is clear, however, that
his hold upon the party is rapidly weakening, and
those issues of the Commoner that used to be looked
upon as* thunderbolts powerful enough to kill what
ever candidate they fell upon will now pass as some
thing even less potent than summer lightning, and be
counted as of no importance in the party campaign.
Reports from Missouri arc to the effect that Lon
Stephens is little in peace, but large in a fight.
He*is known as "the vvasp of Boonville." One au
thority says: "He is a featherweight in build, but a
catamount in a sudden scrap. He wears glasses, but
he can see a long way with them. He-has got money
to burn and a backbone to lean upon. His record as
a Missouri Democrat of the honest, wool hat, last
â¢ditch order is unimpeachable." Such a man of course
could not remain silent in the face of any man who
offered him an excuse for a fight, and accordingly he
has gone for Bryan like a thousand wildcats.
It is significant that the attack of Stephens has
been greeted with favor, not only in the East, where
there has long been a desire for some Western man
to take a fall out of the domineering Platte River
man, but in the South, where Bryan has long had
a following that would listen to no criticism of his
conduct. Evidently Bryan has alienated even that
faction of his party, for the Atlanta Constitution in
reviewing the attack of Stephens says: "The excori
ation he handed out to Mr. Bryan need nor be re
peated here. It was largely personal, but it is indica
tive of the restive spirit of many Democrats over the
attempts of Mr. Bryan to figure as the Sir Oracle of
the Democratic party. While Mn Bryan has yet a
host of friends and admirers in the party, men who
would resent any injustice attempted upon him and
his followers in 1896 and rooo, the fact grows more
apparent daily that the party at large does not feel
bound by any valid obligation to allow him the cen
sorship of its personnel and platform in the coming
national campaign."
WHEN Bryan announced some months ago
that he would review the various aspirants
for the Democratic nomination for the
Presidency and separate the sheep from the goats
among them he doubtless believed that no one would
have the temerity to question his decision. He went
upen the theory that those whom he commended
would be glad to commend him in return, and that
those whom he disapproved would be so eager to
harmonize the party they would not venture to fight
back. For a time it looked as if the would-be auto
crat of his party was right in his reasoning. He went
about commending here and denouncing there witli
great zeal and no one said him nay. Like all rash
men, however, he has at last gone too far, and now
he has a fight on his hands.
Not long ago it pleased Mr. Bryan to read ex-
Governor Lon V. Stephens of Missouri out of the
Democratic party because that gentleman expressed
a desire to see David R. Francis of St. Louis nomi
nated for the Presidency by the Democrats next
year. Bryan objects to Francis, and accordingly he
asserted that no man who supports Francis can
train as a loyal Democrat. The statement was not
pleasing to Missourians, for Francis is their State
candidate, their favorite son and their expectant win
ner. Consequently when Bryan declared that no
man who supports Francis is a good Democrat he
got into trouble at once.

There will be no question in the mind of
an impartial reader of this work that re
ciprocity as a means of regulating either
our fiscal system or our international re
lations, has been proven wholly unsatis
factory. The work is worth studying as
a matter of history or as a matter of pol
itics, and merits a wide reading.
"Reciprocity," by J. Laurence Laughlin
and H. Parker Willis. Published by the
Baker & Taylor Company. 33 East 17th
street. New York. Price $3.
twenty years the pendulum of public
opinion has swung back and forth from
reciprocity to tariff reform. Disappointed
in the one it has turned to the otner. Yet
it has never succeeded in getting a defin
ite* trial of reciprocity until the passage
of the Dingley act. Under that instru
ment the futility of reciprocity efforts has
apparently been shown with greatest con
cluslveness. It is time for a revulsion
of public opinion, and that revulsion
seems now well under way." .
Professor Laughlin of the University of
Chicago, and Professor Willis of Wash
ington and Lee University, in setting out
to write in collaboration a treatise on
"Reciprocity," found themselves confront
ed at the start by a difficulty in getting
a good definition of the term. After citing
many given by various authorities, and
pointing out that none of them would
fully express what has been the Ameri
can practice with respect to that phase
of our international relations, they were
forced to resort to a history rather than
a. definition of the subject, and accord
ingly the first chapter of their book deals
with "the origin and nature of the reci
procity Idea."
In concluding the chapter, the writers
say: "One who examines the reciprocity
treaties now pending In the Senate will
readily understand how, it has resulted
that the reciprocity of to-day is no more
than a jumble of tariff concessions, dic
tated upon no logical principles and sub
ject only to the requirements of the nego
tiator. We appear before the world In the
light of one who seeks to drive as good
bargains as possible with his fellows, but
who strips these bargains even of any
semblance *f equity they might other
wise have, by concluding- other bargains
at a later date, which destroy, or at any
rate may destroy, the advantage accru
ing from the earlier ones."
The scope of the work includes a com
plete detailed history of our various at
tempts at reciprocity treaties with differ
ent nations. The various chapters are:

New York.
A striking illustration of the extent and
variety of corporation activities in our
American life is afforded by the 1903 edi
tion of Moody's Manual, which has just
been published. The volume contains
more than 2400 pages and treats of up
ward of 11,000 different corporate enter
prises.' Such a compilation presents, a
comprehensive review of our vast corpo
rate developments in recent years, and
shows to what extent industries are now
being carried on Â«toy such associations.
The scope of the work is sufficiently
large to permit giving all statistics and
information required to give the public
a clear understanding of the salient fea
tures of every one of these numerous cor
porations. Each is described as to prop
erty owned and controlled., capitalization,
funded debt, dividends paid, financial
condition and earnings. The manual gives
the Hats of officers and directors of cor
porations, and includes statements of
many industrial concerns, Including nu
merous gas and electric light plants, tele
graph and telephone companies, not
found in any other publication.
After a most delightful and restful out-
Ing during the afternoon the President
and Mrs. Roosevelt returned to Sagamore
Hill in their boat. The remainder of the
party returned on the Sylph.
Early in the forenoon the President and
Mrs. Roosevelt entered a light skiff at the
Roosevelt pier, below Sagamore Hill, and
started for a point on Huntington Bay,
six or seven miles distant. Arriving at
their destination they were joined soon
afterward by their own children, their
house guests and some of the members of
the family of William Emlin Roosevelt,
who followed them on .the yacht Sylph.
Old-fashioned clam ovens were dug Jn the
sand pf the beach and a rare picnic din
ner was soon in readinesf^for the party,
the clambake being . supplemented by a
hamper luncheon brought from the Presi
dent's home. ; :-'.-\'\'
OYSTER BAT. N. Y., July 3.-President
Roosevelt to-day enjoyed his first clam
bake of the year. It was preceded by an
Invigorating row of several miles in a
small boat, and both the President and
him family and friends were quite ready
for the feast when it was ready for them.
On Tahiti a few days ago a lightning

of an eighth of a mile felt the shock. No
one was seriously injured.
PAPETE. Tahiti. June 20. via San Fran
cisco; July 3.â The Government of France
has decided to modify H* colonial policy
with reference to tfcia .section. The local
povtrr.ment will henceforth assume the
burden wholly of the expenses of thu
civi!. judicial and military branches. The
latter force will be reduced to a *rore vr
more in the near future. The naval con
tingent will probably be dispersed with.
.During a number of years France has
generously contributed toward the sup
port of the local government. There are
other changes, notably the enlargement
of the Cabinet of the Governor J>nd the
doing away with the popular Assembly.
The local authorities favor an economical
administration. Probably the subsidy for
the Inter-island service will be reduced
from 120.C00 francs to 50.000 francs or
less. In that event, so It is said, two
120-ton gasoline vessels will be acceptable
to the Government in place of a steamer
of 450 tons capacity as at present.
The American Consul after a trip to
Raiatln, one of the Leeward Islands, In
the Society group, reports that there was
a cloudburst on that Island that caused
damage to the road and destroyed prop
erty to some extent, but no lives were
lost.
That this power has been put in the hands of the
people in so many nations; to err. to be unwise, to
make mistakes and correct them, is due solely to the
example of the United States, and that example was
made possible by what happened in Independence
Hall six score and seven years ago. It will soon be a
hundred years since Charles Carroll, the latest sur
vivor of the Declaration of Independence, died. The
old document itself, called in its title '"The Unani
mous Declaration," has faded away. Text and the
signatures are no longer legible. The venerable
parchment is hidden away from the light in the
vaults of the State Department at. Washington. .^The
bell that rang: out liberty to the world when the/last
name was signed is cracked and voiceless. But that
silent metal and that faded parchment were proper
tics in the world's greatest drama. The bell rings
no more, but its triumphant tongue in 1776 cried to
the world a message that will never be silent. Wher
ever man is enfranchised and the master of himself
it tells the story of his happiness; and wherever he
is in bonds in the keeping of a master, the thrall of
a man like himself, it sings the song of his hope.
The pigments on the old parchment have faded.
The signatures in which the signers wrote their
death warrant or their title to immortality, they knew
not which, have disappeared. But the mind of man
writes it over with the story of his emancipation or
the expression of his hopes, and the mighty palimp
sest becomes the handwriting on the wall to the few
Belshazzars that are left to curse the modern world.
The <ieed done on this day we celebrate was
mighty, and mighty were the men who wrought it.
It gave us a birthright greater than men were born to
before that day. As it is great, let it be greatly
guarded. There can be no liberty without law and
no law without equality in its application.
Unequal law is tyranny. Under our form of gov
ernment the law, like the sunshine, the air and the
rain, is for the equal enjoyment and protection of
all. When one man, no matter how poor and hum
ble, is denied by any force the rights that are his by
law, that denial is treason to all for which this. day
stands.
IT is difficult for the mind to go back 127 years
and enter into the conditions under which the 4th
day of July was made the greatest civil anniver
sary ever celebrated by man. Other nations ha\e
their great days, and some of them keep anniversaries
that are derived from some step gained in the
progress of liberty. But this American day signal
izes no step, no day's march, but the whole emer
gence of man into the clear air of complete freedom
and self-government. It was the immediate and en
tire accomplishment of Thomas Paine's declaration,
"These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent states." That was treason when he
uttered it. It was still treason when put in form by
the Continental Congress a hundred and twenty
seven years ago. But on that treason has been
founded the world's greateA free society, and it be
came the expression of man's aspiration for liberty
that has not ceased to move the race forward toward
the light.
Six score and seven years ago the people had but
little representation in government. England alone
had a parliamentary system, which was slightly im
pressed by a much restricted franchise. Wherever
else there was a legislative branch of government it
was subject to the will of the monarch and not of
the people.
Now Parliaments are the rule, the lack of them
the exception. The people speak through represen
tation. The republican principle grows daily. Kings
and Cabinets bow to the public will, and there is a
condition in government that would ' have made
Frederick and Louis and George, Rex, rub their
eyes. Critics of this condition sometimes complain
that the people do not rule wisely. Well, did Kings?
Was the first Charles wise when he asserted his
paramount prerogative, levied ship t^x inland, pro
voked Hampton, conjured Cromwell from the mass
of the people, and by violation of the constitution
brought his head to the block and prepared for the
end of his dynasty? Has the best of Princes â¢ even
ruled always in wisdom? Being . men only, why
should they? Being men only, why should it be de
manded that the people be always wise in their rule?
Partaking of human weakness, the people err, but it ,
is their own error and they are its victims. When they
discover their mistake they correct it. Princes err on
the side of their own power, their own selfishness,
their cnvn dynasty, and, like the first Charles and the
sixteenth Louis, they stand by their errors, refusing
correction or amendment, because they are the bene
ficiaries and the people the victims. Free govern
ment has that advantage, then, that the people if they
err hurt themselves. The wound is self-inflicted, and
when felt can be self-cured. d

but a poor harbor and affords little facilities for a
naval base~bf supplies. Britain needs a naval base
more than she needs a fort. Minorca has at^ Port
Mahon a magnificent natural harbor, and British
money and skill could soon make it impregnable to
attack and ample for all the needs of her Mediter
ranean fleets. The strategic position of the island
with relation to both the European and the African
coast is said to be superior to that of Gibraltar.
Hence the desire on the part of the British mili
tary and naval authorities to make the exchange.
The discussion of the project by the European
press is the more significant because it follows so
closely upon the discussion of a* similar reported
project of settling disputes between France and
Great Britain over Morocco by permitting France to
have a free.l.-nd in the conquest of that country,
with the exception of a port on the Mediterranean
which Britain was to be permitted to fortify and
control. The fact that such pjanÂ» have been under
discussion between the two countries gives support
to the new report of an exchange with Spain. The
proposed deal would leave all of Morocco to France,
restore Gibraltar to Spain, and at the same time give
Britain the harbor she needs. It is therefore by
no means improbable that it is actually under con
sideration by diplomatists as well as by the press.

The latest thing in gentlemen's socks is the New

PRESIDENT HADLEY of Yale improved
commencement time to deliver a much needed
denunciation of the luxury in which rich' stu
dents live and the evil wrought by the example of
their extravagance.
Many a young man whose prospects in life were
fair and whose parents have loyally skimped and
saved to give him a college education is morally
ruined by contact with the lavish expenditures of rich
and reckless students. One remedy would be en
forcing residence in college dormitories furnished
exactly alike and other limitations upon sumptuous
expenditure.
President Hadley says the college life of the or
dinary man who has neither money nor influence be
hind him can be made big enough to be the really
important thing in the institution. If so, that whole
some example will take the place of the evil now
done by extravagance in spending and' its consequent
vice and immorality, all so sweetened by riches as to
seduce the unwary away from their duty to them
selves and. their college and their family.

the site of the former prosperous town of
Dyea. at the head of Lynn Canal, it
covered with tide water. An earthquake.
which shook things up along tlw Alaskan
coast two weeks ago, settled a part of
the beach adjacent to Dyea harbor, with
thÂ© result that the tide now runs freely
through what were formerly streets of
the busy town forming" tho gateway to
the Klondike vla-Chilkoot Pass. Many
houses have been floated out Into Lynn
Canal, there to be caught by Chiikoot In
diana and towed ashore. Brave? in waÂ»
canoes have been engaged for ten days S
in securing as many houses as possible.
Some of the houses have been towed a?
far as Pyramid Harbor.
Dyea was quickly built during 1307 and
1S9S, following the discovery of the Klon
dike. It rivaled Skagway in importane*
until the White Pass Railway was built,
folowlng which the Chiikoot Pass routs
to the head of the Yukon waa abandoned.

WHILE. San Francisco people

tryir.g to maintain their

dodging the ' cold *pray from the big

from stem to" stern. In ordinary wettiher
â¢â¢th? Curacao should have reached port
..from Guaytnas early Thursday afternoon,
'â¢but U was not until the email hours of

TO ARRIVE
- Â¦ - ' ' 'Â¦ . )
William Doll, who wan arrested on
Thursday on a warrant charging him
with obtaining: money by false pretenses,
appeared before^ Police Judge Conlan yes
terday and he was instructed as to his
rights. By consent the case waa con
tinued for a week.
William -Roehl. '42% Turk street, the
complaining witness, * alleges that Doll
made him believe that he owned the
patent for a device worth $25,000 for ex
tinguishing fires and on June 22 got from
him- $190 as, part payment of an interest
in the patent, which. Roehl says, only
existed in Doll's imagination.
Roehl . makes other serious charges to
the police against Doll and his wife. He
said that, he had fallen heir to an estate
valued at about. $100,000 In Hamburg, Ger
many. ; He was in Honolulu when he was
notified of his good fortune. When he ar
rived here i from Honolulu he accident
ally met Doll on the wharf, who spoke to
him arid claimed that he was born in the
same town in Germany as Roehl. As.
Roehl was a stranger- in the city he read
ily accepted Doll's Invitation to spend a
few days at his home, 376 Fifth street.
Roehl had not been long there when,
he says, he received a draft for $1000 from
Germany. By this time Doll and his wife
had learned of Roehl'a'good fortune and
he says they kept pouring liquor lnjo him
and he had not a sober moment for sev- ,
eral days. Meantime Doll had suggested
to him to go into mining speculation and
by various pretexts Doll succeeded in ob
tainins from him the whole" of the $1000,
with the exception of ?40. All that he
could positively remember of the many
schemes was the patent fire extinguisher
and after he sobered up a little he, got
away from Doll's house, where, he says,
he had practically been kept a prisoner.
As Roehl alleges that Mrs. Doll was as
deep in the scheme to get his money as
her husband, the police are considering
the possibility of arresting her.

YELLOW. ROSES *
By Franz Mortelmans Â¦.*Â«, â¢.-;
y a his picture shows a bouquet of yellow roses, nearly life size,
in a dark blue jardiniere, standing out clear from" a dark background.
( It is a reproduction of an original oil painting By Fran* Mortel-
mans, the distinguished flower painter of BelgVom. , It won a gold
medal for him at the Brussels Exposition in 1890. -
Franz Mortelmans was born in Antwerp in 1865, and is consid-
ered by many the greatest living painter of flowers. His father was
a painter of artistic tastes, whose greatest joy was the progress and
1 education of his children in the arts he loved so well â painting and
music. It was his habit to take them frequently on excursions to .
the woods in search of^flowers. 'Nothing pleased the little Franz
*' more than to draw crude forms in the dry earth and sand. Dis-
playing unusual aptitude in outlining flowers and still life, at the
early age of xi he went to the academy to become a decorator and
scene painter. At the age of 16 he sent a canvas to the biennial
'.-â¢-' 1 salon at Gaud. Another, exhibited in London, sold for 40 pounds
Â¦ sterling, being the only Belgian picture purchased. After spending
" â two years in the army he studied at Verlat, and at the Institut
Superieur. In 1889 he exhibited at the Exposition of Ghent and
received governmental reward. In 1890 the same honor was granted
him at Brussels. His studio is now in Antwerp, and his paintings
are in demand throughout Europe and America. The Queen of
Belgium recently purchased" one of his rose pictures. He is a lover
of sport, and he is frequently seen in the country, followed by two
Jogs, giving free rein to his ever-working imagination.

AN announcement made some months
since by the officers of the Interstate
Coursing Club has apparently been
misunderstood by the leashmen and some
it nf usion has resulted. -
The action taken was to extend the
time in which puppies could be liste-l for
the Futurity from sixty to ninety -.lays.
TIJa was intended to give the Eastern
owners an opportunity to list th>:ir pup
pics. Some of the coursing men thought
the extension applied to. the< registering
cf litters with the California Coursing
Committee, the governing body of the
sport on this coast. No such actioa was
taken. Litters must be registered within
thirty days of whelping, the fee betn-.? fl
per litter. A penalty of $3 is imyosei It
they are* registered between thirty on-I
sixty days.
The second payment on the puppies in
the California Futurity became due on
the 1st inst. The stake will be run at
Union Coursing Park In September. $1500
being added by the association. There
has been apparent a quickened interest
In this event during the past two weeks.
Some promising candidates have been
seen -in public, notably the Fetter Free-
Motto puppies, but there are many others
of class scattered between this city and
Butte and even as far as Dallas, Tex.
Modesto, Stockton and Sacramento and
other interior points have candidates of
which much is expected.
When the schedule committee made 'up
the matches for the season. Sunday, July
5, was set off for the trip to Lake Coun

San Francisco and Alameda cricketers
will pick up sides to-morrow on thÂ«
grounds at Webster street. Alameda. %
The San Francisco County men made a'
journey to Santa Crua'on June 21 s and 23
and the Pacific team will visit the sea-Â°
side city on the ,26th inst. Had It been
possible to get two clear days of cricket
in Lake County more city players would
have been ready to make the trip, but
the visitors would not have arrived at
Lower Lake until about 3 o'clock this
morning and would have been obliged to
make an early start to-morrow morning
on "the homew*rd journey to San Fran
cisco. Jt is much to be desired that the
annual meetings between the city and
Lake County cricketers should be, kept
up, as they constitute almost the only
bond between them. The Lake County
trip has been the pleasantest of the sea
son for all the city cricketers who have
made it in past years.
President Arthur E. Rendle of the
Metropolitan District Cricket League of
New York offered the Rendle merit
medals at just the right time. His let
ter offering to present a silver medal to
any member of a club in the California
Cricket Association who makes a hundred
or more runs in an innings or captures
three wickets with three consecutive balls
in a first-class match, was written June
13 and was received here about June 13.
On June 21 Harold. B. Richardson made
103 runs at Santa Cruz and on June 2S B.
Kortlang made 100 runs at Alamedal
Both cricketers are looking forward to
the silver medals, which should reach this
city shortly, Mr. Rendle having been
notified of the performances by a letter
written last Monday.
MUCH to the regret of those mem
bers of the city cricket clubs who
have partaken of the hospitality
of the Lake County cricketers, it was
found impossible to make up a team vo
visit Lower Lake at this time.
Four or five members of the . Pacific
Club were ready to make the trip to

On Independence Day caddies are scarce
on the links of the San Rafael Golf Club,
as the youngsters prefer patriotic cele
brations to the profits of carrying a golf
er's clubs. In eplte. however, of a prob
able scarcity of bag-bearers,' there will
be a handicap competition over eighteen
holes for the members to-day.
It is expected the new eighteen-hole
course will be ready for the use of the
golfers who will assemble at Del Monte
for the golf week at the end of August.
Men are at work preparing the course and
laying water pipes to the putting greens.
Even if the whole course should not be
ready for play, it will be possible to get
a nine-hole course which will be much
longer than the old one. The competi
tions wilt take up the whole week from
August 24 to 29, inclusive. The Del Monte
Cup and a trophy for the runner-up will
be open for competition by all amateur
golfers. The Del Monte Cup for women
Is open to all women golfers. The J.' W.
Byrne trophy will be competed for by
teams representing the golf associations
of Northern and Southern California. As
each association has won the trophy once
it will become the permanent property
of whichever association is victorious this
year. For the open championship contest,
which Is open to all golfers, amateur or
professional, entries must be made with
R. Gilman Brown, secretary of the Pacific
Coast Golf Association, before August 20.
This contest will be over seventy-two
holes, metal play, and will occupy two
days. Three prizes, of $100, $30 and $20,
are offered for the first three players, If
professionals. Amateurs taking any one
of the three highest places will receive the
gold, silver or bronze medal of the Pacific
Coast Golf Association.
THE fifth- annual contest for the
PonlatowBki Cup for women golfers
will be played to-da/ over the
course of the Burlingame Country Club.
Though the trophy is to become the per
manent property of the lady who first
wins it twice, It is practically certain
that' it will remain unwon for at least
another vear.

SUMMARY.
THE home team erred often at Rec
reation Park yesterday and all the
errors counted for runs at the little
meeting with the Oakland team. The
Cripples wece really the best and would
have won anyhow, but at that the natives
should have given them a better battle or
at least have tried to give the. spectators
about two bits' worth of baseball instead
of a dollar's worth of foolishness. Score:
Oakland 8, San Francisco 3.
The Cripples were in the game pretty
near all thejlme and when they started
to make runs they succeeded as a rule.
Then they were aided so much by tho er
rors of the locals that really it was not
such a difficult matter to set away with
the game without half trying.
Ham Iberg was not himself and the
Cripples were aware of this fact, judg
ing by the wcy they got to him every
once and a while. Ham was liberal with
his passes and easy to hit. The Cripples
landed for eleven solid ones, most of
which were torn off when men were on
the. bags, so they counted all the time.
Graham pitched a very good game for
Papa Pete and would have nearly shut
the locals out had not a few errors early
in -the game interfered with bis plans.
The score:

THE second day of the men's

brought out much better
matches than did the previous
day. The heat was intense and
the playtJr's suffered greatly.

Will Allen, Harry Routh and Grant
Smith. At 10 in the morning Collier will
meet Allen and Routh wll! be opposed to
Smith. The winners will meet at 2:30.
One of the best matches ever seen at
San Rafael was that in. which the con
testants" were R. N. Whitney and Harry
Weihe. The latter won the first set, 6-1,
on the previous day and- led at 1-0. The
match was continued yesterday and went
lip full five sets. Weihe started playing
brilliant tennis and won the first two
games. At this point it seemed he would
win quite handily. When Whitney got
started he took five straight games. This
set went to Whitney, 6-4. The latter was
Improving steadily and won the next eet.
6-0. Weihe appeared to havMittle chance,
but turned the tables on Whitney, win
ning, tf-1. ,
In the fifth set tlfe real struggle began.
Weihe. won the first two., games! but
Whitney took the next four. Weihe
braced at this stage of the game and won
two love games, tying the score.
The ninth game went to Whitney, but
Weihe again made It games all. Wfihe
was* fast tiring and Whitney by cleVer
lobbing and driving took the next two
games and the match.
It was great tennis throughout and was
'Great interest Is centered In the finals

It Lr expected Collier and Smith will

to play hard matches In the morning. Fol

score being 6-1.
Like Whitney, Bcyfuss was too much

Smith played only one match to reach
the semi-flnals.
.After putting Weihe out Whitney was
too tired to proceed and defaulted to Will
Allen.

The Stanford man put up a game, fight,

SHEEPEHEAD BAY, N. Y., July 3.-
Tbe racing to-day lacked Interest.
When a moderate horse like Andy
Williams Is top weight at 130 pounds in
a handicap It Is easy to realise that the
class of hia rivals 1b not high.
The overnight handicap at a mile and
three furlongs was the only event of any
pretensions on the card. Andy Williams
cut no figure in the contest. Perhaps It
was the horse's fault, for he appeared
core before the race, but George Odom
was made the subject of some criticism
because he Buffered his mount to be car
ried wide on the first turn and thereby
lost ground.
Thorneycraft made the running for
about six furlongs. Then Surmise -Went
on in front, but Thorneycraft again chal
lenged and Bullman was forced to ride
his hardest, without resorting to the
whip, however, to win by a head. The
lime was good for a mile and three fur
longs. 2:20. Summary: â¢'

Governor Pardee Will
Deliver Address of
the Day.
"We must get more material and study
all carefully. In the meantime we must
withhold judgment. If. the remains are
genuine they furnish: the best proofs that
have yet been found of man's early exist
ence in America. If . only ,' water-worn
fragments, they are still an Interesting
chapter from the history of life in this
part of tho world. And the man himself
we may find in some other cave, and his
history may be read by the record being
obtained at Potter Creek."
In* introducing his subject' Professor
Merriam spoke interestingly of the results
of the scientific study, of man's history.
The scientists, he said, had been able to
trace man to a period 50,000 years .ago.
This was accomplished through examina
tion of fossils -found in caves and' plain
deposits. .â¢';.
"No other cave in the world," said Pro
fessor Merriam. "furnishes such well-pre
served specimens of remains as this.
There are other caves in Shasta County
still to be explored, however. I believe
that an extensive examination . of these
would furnish results that would repay all
the time and money spent on them. But
the work must be done by careful/ expe
rienced hands, for. It is a very easy mat
ter for one not experienced to destroy fos
sils of inestimable value.
Potter Creek in Shasta County, however,
is richest In fossil remains. The cave was
found in 1S7S by J. A. Richardson, who
discovered there the skull of a large ex
tinct bear, now at the American Mu3eum
in New York. E. L. Furlong rediscovered
the cave last year. It is 10$> feet long und
2a feet wide and is reached by a rope
ladder. In thia cavern were found a large
number of fractured bones in a good stute
of preservation, and some skulls. Traces
of man's existence have been diligently
sought, and a number of polished and
pointed bones were . found which might
have served/ as implements, but so far
there are no positive results.
In a lecture this evening at South Hall
on the "Exploration and Excavation of
the Caves of California" Professor John
C Merriam, professor of palaeontology at
the University of California, said that
the fossil remains found in the cave? of
the. State furnish more satisfactory
proofs of man's age in America than any
so far obtained in other parts of the
country.
Professor Merriam described in detail
the caves of Calaveras, Tuolumnc and
Shasta counties. Those of Calaveras and
Tuolumnc, he said, arc limestone in their
character, a formation which preserves
almost intact the remains embedded in It.
Here have been found many skulls of In
dians of the low-browed type, which must
have belonged to the bodies of men who
lived ages ago. Some of the remains
found at Murphys, in Tuolumne, and. Cave
City, in Calaveras, he saia, are of doubt
ful origin; that is, it is impossible to dis
tinguish whether they arc human or ani
mal bones.

At the time of the action taken in the
matter the Goodes were occupying a
house belonging to C. H. King at 370 East
Eleventh street. Goode states that he
was served with a peremptory notice to
vacate the house, but owing to the condi
tion of his wife was unable to do so. Car
penters were then sent by King and the
house was raised and a new foundation
placed under it and then the shingles
were torn off and replaced by new ones.
Guode pays King and his agents. Wood
ward & Watson were both Informed of
the condition of his wife, but would take
no action in the matter. This occurred at
the first of the year.
Mental and physical suffering are set
forth as the grounds for a $10,000 damage j
suit instituted to-day by J. D. Goode and j
his wife. Saiah, against C. H. King, an

on a sick bed with n new-born child j
when, it is alleged, carpenters began tear- ,
ing away, nrst the foundations of the j
house and then the roof, under orders I
from King.
The noise and jarring, together with the
delicate health of Mrs. Goode. it is al

health of both mother and child. They

MAYO.* DECLINES TO
TALK ABOUT WATEB
.'â¢. According to the story told by Mrs.
.'Â¦Mills to the police last night, a man
iailedat hrr residence on Wednesday aft
: !rrnÂ»bn and asked the Japanese servant if
â¢.lhe fdl&s were in. The servant said no
. and Â»he man went away. Nothing fur
â¢ thef was thought of the incident until
â¢ later developments.
Â¦'.': Shortly after 2 o'clock last Thursday
â¢Â¦. *nornir.g the Japanese servant was awak
'â¢ciied by two men. who had evidently en
â¢ â¢â¢tered the house by the aid. of a skeleton
â¢key.. In rough tones th.'y commanded
â¢. lihn'to show them through the house and
'reveal the place where the valuables were
: :kÂ«pt.
. â¢ The servant led the way to the parlor.
â¢>ut suddenly showed tight, lie grappled
Â¦ fiercely with uno of thÂ«- men and threw
- h;m to the floor. Then th<* other came to
7 tRe fallen -man's assistance, whereupon a
' ha.ird Itght ensued. The Jap was tinally
"â¢..overpowered- and rendered unconscious by
/."a. Llow over the right eye with the buvt
â¢ H.*nd of a revolver.
â¢ [ When the servant was laid out on the
â¢' floor the two men bound Mm with a nura
">>rr "of Decktfefl betonstas to Mr. Mills.
Â¦Â¦-They were found in the room. They
â¢ lfiricw the unfortunate servant into a
'S-Ibfce.t. so that his screams would not
;.uwak.eYi the -neighbors if he happened to
. r.epain his guises.
â¢ â¢The two men lost no time in going
' through the house and taking all they
â¢'could lay hands on. In their hurried
./search- they discovered a handsome gold
'* watch and chain l>elonging to Mrs. Mills.
a diamond pin valued at several hundred
â¢ dollar*", a handsome geld clock and a
bnrnd new suit of clothes belonging to
*.. Mr.. Mill?.
The .robbers lost no time in making
their et-cape. and they departed as mys
"teriously as they entered, leaving no clew
" behind' them. Mr. Mills, who had been
detained downtown late that night, re
turned about 3:30 o'clock, liis attention
.tias' attracted by the screams of the Jap.
.whw had regained consciousness. Mr.
Â¦ .-Mills at once released him.
The Jap is a bright sort of a fellow and
is able to give a pood description of the
"men. He states that they were Tjoth
â¢ ab'oujt five fep t seven inches tall, light
â¢ womplexioned and both wore mustaches.
.Born were young, apparently about 28 or
-Years "of age. and both wore blue army

. the day. after being informed by her hus
.tiand of the robbery. She- is very anxious
to'.regain the stolen articles at any cost.
â¢TRi: they were family heirlooms and price- '

Assessor Dalton also states that he and
Assessor Dodge will both assess the fran
chise, of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, so that if the company escapes in
one county it will be caught in the other.
The water company will be assessed at
$6,000,000, which is $1,000,000 more than last
year and is in reality $2,500,000 more, as it
escaped a $1,500,000 assessment. The Oak
land Transit Consolidated is to be raised
from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000, and the Oak
land Gas, Light and Heat Company for
as much more on their assessments over
last yeai.
"I am not decided as to what to do in
the matter. There is plenty of property
â¢we can seize and it need not necessarily
be a ferry-boat. We can take anything
for taxe3 that belongs to the corporation.
I have until the third Monday In July
before I have to take action. I wish,
however, to consult with Assessor Dodge,
as we will probably act together in the
matter."
Up to closing hour this evening nothing
had been heard at the Assessor's office
from the Southern Pacific Railway in re
gard' to ; the demand made upon the com
pany by Assessor Dalton for the payment
of taxes on a $1,050,000 extra assessment
on its bay franchise. This was the last
day for such payment. Assessor Dalton
states that he will take no action before
Monday and that in the meantime he will
confer with Assessor-Dodge of San Fran
cisco as to the best course to pursue. In
this regard he says:

"Me fix that," the Chinaman answered,
without a moment's hesitation. "Me go
to window, call a Chinaman friend up
from street. "When he come to this door
you pull him in and I run out. See? You
have eleven plisoners allee same, and po
lice can't tell one Chinaman from, other."
But notwithstanding his cunning, John
had to go to the station, and his "velly
important engagement" was broken.â
Brooklyn Eagle.
"Can't do it, John." Drennan persisted.
"They've got you prisoners all counted.
If I turn over only ten I'll have troubles
of my own."
Some time ago a squad of Manhattan
police raided a fantan game in China
town. Eleven Chinamen were captured
and kept in a third-story front room In
charge of Detective Drennan until the pa
trol wagon came for them. While they
were waiting for the wagon one of the
prisoners said to Drennan:
"Me got to go. Me got velly Important
engagement."
"I suppose so," said the detective, "but
you've got a more Important engagement
at the police station."
The Chinaman begged like a good fel
low, but Drennan was obdurate.
"Me give you five dollala if you let me
go," the prisoner finally whispered.
"Xo use, John. Even if I let you out of
the room," said the detective, "the police
-would cafceh you at the lower door. They
are guarding that."
As quick as a flash the Chinaman an
swered: "That's allee light. You let me
out, me go upstairs, get out on roof and
go down other building. Police no catches
me."
Wily Way of the Chinaman.

of the condition of the crop, but the cornered
condition of the staple leaves little room for
Juet Inferences of crop conditions from the
price movement. The Improvement in the
condition of the crop 6lnce the last report was
received with eatisfactlon in the stock mar
ket. Neither this influence nor any other
caused anythmc but a trivial movement of
prices.
The bank statement was without appreciable
influence, although the showing was a weak
one. The increase in the loan averaces of
*.i.Â«9i,.Wio was moderate, in view of the heavy
operations of the turn of the fiscal year but
the decrease of *4.502.itOO in cash reÂ«.r\>s was
a disappointment. Of this $J,012.G00 went to
the Sub- Treasury, the operations of that in
etltutun havine failed to reflect the Govern
ment interest disbursements until to-day, when
"thad a debt at the Clearing-house of $1,021.- [
l-"5. .There are caid to have been large ship
meats of money to New Orleans, Cincinnati,
fet. Louis, Boston and Canada during the week.
There were very few features in the market.
The drop to 80 of Hocking Valley was ex
plained b> the oiflcial announcement of the
payment of 1G5 Xbr the pooled common stock,
constituting a majority of issue, with no pro
vision made for the minority stockholders. The
majority stockholders at one time cherished
the hoc>e of a guarantee or 4% or 5 per cent
dividends. The announcement of an advanced
rate of exprets charges was folowtd by a fall
of i points In United States Exprtss.
Demand for remittance by to-morrow's
steamers advanced the rate of sterling ex
change and the figures of the week's exports of
grain chow a decrease of several hundred
thousand buehels. The dull, sagging move
ment of the early part of the day gavÂ« place
to a hardening tendency at the last - and
brought the level or prices for the jirlncipa!
active stocks to a fraction above last night
and the closing was firm.
The bond market was dull and irregular.
Total sales, par v*lue. $1.9UÂ»,O0O.
There was some stirring of t^eculativ? In
terest in stocks -early in the week which
aroused ho^es of an awakening market for
securities, but proved unfounded, and the level
of activity fell away to the low level again
late in the week, with a sagging terfdency of
values owine to the almost tolal lack of de
mand. The increased animation with which
the market started off on Monday was largely
due to the good impression caused by the out
come in the Pennsylvania etock sub
scription. It was feared that some
artificial cuprort had been given the
stock durinjr the subscription period and that
with the closed subscription and this support
withdrawn there would be a further fall In the
Ftock. When the price advanced on Monday
the whole market was benefited. It was con
sidered of the best augury for the money mar
ket also that this creat operation had been
carried throueh with scarcely a ripple. With
HU per cent of the fubscriptiens paid in full,
instead of only the 50 per cent Installment of
the subscriptions called for. the requirement
upon the money market amounted to $S1,000,-
OuO. The fact that so strong a proportion of
the subscribers availed themselves of the
privJUge of deferred payments was regarded
as a striking evidence of unexpected resources
in the money market. The official assurances
given that the Pennsylvania's $40,000,000 loan
would be repaid at maturity in the second and
third weeks of July instead of being extended
according to prtvilece promised further relief
to thÂ« money situation. The action of the
money market over the turn of the fiscal year
failed to develop any signs of a squeeze. So
far as the fears of a squeeze in money had
deterred buyers of stocks from corain* into
the market, this element seemed removed. But
the demand lor stocks has failed to develop
and the professionals who bought stocks ottrly
in the week in expectation of It have again
withdrawn from the market.
Whatever may be the cause of the apathetic
market for stocks. It Is evident that it is not
removed by the passage of the semi-annual
settlements and the completion of Pennsyl
vania stock subscriptions as was hoped. It Is
probable that the present easy condition of the
money market has not entirely relieved ap
prehension that the autumn requirements will
demand all the resources available. The con
tinued high level of bank loans after the ex
tensi\-e liquidation which has occurred makes
a deep impression. The Comptroller's report
shows loans and discounts of all the national
banks on June fl to be $193,180,119 larger
than en July 1<> last year. In the same per
iod specific holdings by the banks have fallen
off $16,147,590 and lepal tenders $1,261,403.
The percentage â¢ of lejral reserves on June 9
was 22.0S as against 22.33 per cent on July
16 last year. The Treasury Department's
statement of money in circulation in the coun
try exclusive of holdings in the Treasury on
July I shows an increase of $129,378.Â»52 since
July 1 of last year. The decrease for the
same period in the cash reserves of the banks
argues an extraordinary growth in the de
mands of the circulation and is a convincing
evidence of the high activity of business. But
It <l#es noÂ» indicate an Improvement in the
banking- situation. The conclusion In drawn
that the banks have had to take over enormous
loans from foreign lenders to whom they have
been paid durnig the prolonged period of liqui
dation in the securities market. The appoint
ment of a receiver for the United States Ship
building Company and the developments In the
courts regarding that organization and the
plans for the reorganization of some of the
minor industrial combinations have caused a
deep Impression throughout the financial world
and have awakened a eplrlt of distrust against
the whole of that class of securltien The iron
market is closely scanned for indications of
the basis for the coming year's business and
for light on ita volume. A good impression is
caused by reports of large orders placed for
eteel rails and the eudden , marking up of

regarded hopefully as a possible heralding of
a demand for securities of this class. The
price to which thin etock was lifted is that at

faction ameng holders in the ranks of em
ployes. The very large earnings shown' by
the anthracite coal carriers for May gave them
a firm tone in the market and made them fa
vorites in the abortive upward movement. Net
earnings for May in other territory â¢ reflected
such laree encroachments by operating ex
penses as to deprive them of stimulating in
fluence upon prices. The stock market is keen
ly attentive to the crop news, as a matter of
course. The highly speculative conditions in
the cereal and cotton markets make the de
ductions to be drawn from price movements
unusually confusing. The existence of a cot
ton corner Is a cauÂ»e of uneasiness over a
possible speculative collapse. Any good effect
of favorable reports of the corn crop Is met by
the probability that its final stages will be more
than usually subject to hazards of frost. The
doubt over the outcome of the crops and the
unsettled labor conditions are the ground for
an appreciable spirit of skepticism over the
future, which helps to keep the demand for se
curities at a low level.
The investment demand for bonds, usual at
the periods 'of disbursement of dividends and
interest, has been present In only moderate
degree. The point is made that labor troubles
have resulted in large withdrawals of savings

ir,f^?>T F i" anC v r J ay ' i: , The offlclal statement
of the New \ork associated banks last week
was surprisingly unfavorable for though a
loss of cash waa expected, the decrease was
much larger than was anticipated. The other
notable feature was the change in deposits,
which failed to reflect the net amount result
ing from the loss of cash and the increase in
11 ? statement showed ' a decrease of
$4,502,900 In cash, of which $4,407,900 con
sisted of specie. The required reserve was
f, U - K , m , c^ t ! d ' 43 - 275 through an increase of
$li3.100 in deposits. Adding the Increased re
serve in the requirement to the $4,502,900 loss
of cash makes $4,546,175 as the decrease in
surplus reserve, which item now stands at $8
837,675. Calculated on the basis of deposit
less those of $37,263,200 of public funds the
surplus reserv^ ' lÂ» $17,003,475. The loans 'were
Increased $3,697,300 as the result of loaning
early in the week of funds deposited in an
ticipation of the payment of dividends The
io^^oJ 4 ' 602 .- 900 cash and th Â« increase of
$3,097,300 in loans called for a reduction of
$805,600 in deposits, whereas above noted these
were increased $173,100; therefore, the state
ment was technically out of proof. The cir
culation decreased $179,500. The loans of the
banks were in excess of deposits by $13 551 -
300: In the previous week this excess' was
$10,027,100. The dally average of clearings
last week was $274,000,000, against $188 -
000.000 in this week ending June 27; the In
crease was due to the operations incident to
the semi-annual settlements. The condition
of the banks as regards cash reserve was
doubtless better at the end of the week than
was shown by the statement, for the dis
bursements by the Sub-Treasury for Interest
were heavy on Friday. * Comparisons of
changes in the items of loans show a net in
crease by six banks of $1,700,000: one institu
tion Increased this item by $4,500,000. The
changes in specie show a net loss of $2,700,
000. One bank made the surprising gain of
$6,900,000.

The local demand for fruits was only fairly
steady, as is usually the case on Friday, and
there was not much doing in the snipping line.
The fruit boats from the river arrived too late
for the regular trade and prices of Peaches,
Apricots, Plums and Prunes were easier in
consequence. A large portion of the receipts
from the river section were still on hand at
the close. Receipts of Cherries were light and
good sound stock cleaned up quickly at firmer
rates. The receipts included some poor and
â¢soft stock, which sold at less than the quoted
prices. Figs were in heavy receipt and only
the best stock received any attention. Apples
were abundant and choice, well-packed stocK
alono was firm. Bartlett Pears appeared from
the river and sold at $1 B0 per small box.
when choice. A quantity of windfalls was re
ceived, but were too poor to invite custom.
Other varieties of Pears, such as Lawsons and
Madelines, moved slowly. Watermelons
and Cantaloupes from Coachella met
with a steady demand owing to the
warm weather and were pretty well cleaned
up. No fresh stock came in. Berries ana Curr
rants were easy at previous prices, receipts or
all descriptions being ample. The canners were
buying Loganberries at the bottom quotation
and secured some Currants at $1 7o per chest.
There was no auction sale of Orange3 neia
yesterday and it is not -likely that there will
be any more sales this season. The Citrus
market was generally easy. Â«Fancy Lemons
'were in fair request, but everything else was
dull. â¢ >
Reports from several interior counties say
that the fruit crops have been badly damaged
by disastrous hot wind storms. In some sec
tions the crops were almost totally destroyed.
Bartlett Pears, Peaches and Apricots are sal*
to have suffered most. ,

There is only one statue In Great Brit
ain with an umbrella. This is to be seen
at Reading and 'represents Mr. G. Palmer,
of biscuit fame, standing bareheaded with
a silk hat and umbrella In hand. "
"And that," said the clergyman, quick
ly, "Is exactly my position. I am never
in the same' field with the houndd."â
Youths' Companion.
The clergyman had known the Bishop
for many years, eo he ventured to mur
mur a query as to whether the Bishop
considered hunting worse than attending
balls. i
"I know to what you refer," said the
Bishop, with a slight accession of color
"But I wish you to understand that, al
though my name appeared as that of a
guest at Lady Brockmorton's ball, I was
never in the same room with the danc
ers." r/ 28Si
A story is told of an English Bishop
who was reproving: one of the clergy for
his interest in hunting. "It is unfortu
nate." he said gravely, "that your name
should appear in connection with the
eportâ most unfortunate."

The capital statistics for other parts of
the* world cover about four-fifths of ' the
mileage,-and : for this the total Is $15,490,
000,000, 'and $56,254 ber .mile. ' which is 45
per cent of the average in Europe. In
this latter statement, the capital of the
railroads in this country Is "swelled $2,205,
600,000 by including the stocks' and bonds
o wnei; by the, . railroad I companies v them
selves, which . is . nearly ; one-fifth of - the
total. . If the capital of tho railroads not
reporting is in\ the, same, proportion r as
thatof those which do, the total capital
Invested in railroads in the world is about
$36,850,000,000, : which is a tidy , sum ; to be
invested within 75 yearsâ enough to carry
on about ten had" wars.â Engineering
News. â¢ .â¢
.The Archiv fur Eisenbahnwesen has re
cently begun to publish tables of capital
invested in railroads in the several coun
tries of the world. These are more In
complete than the tables of mileage, but
are good so far as they go. For,Europe
they are Bubstiantially complete, and
show an aggregate investment in rail
roads of $20;246,000,000,, and $123,253 per
mile,' ranging from $252,707 in Great Bri
tain, .to $143,793 on the Belgian State
Railroads. $120,697 in France, $107,107 in
Austria-Hungary, $98,244 in the German
Empire, and $67,0S8 in Russia, down to
$41,636 on the .Swedish, state railroads,
$37,743 in Norway. and $21,251 on the state
railroads 'of Finland. Â¦
Of European countries, the German em
pire leads in mileageâ with 32,753 miles;
but It is followed closely by Russia, with
31,945, and the latter will doubtless soon
tr.ke the lead, for it has 365.8 inhabitants
and 6.S square miles of area per mile of
railroad, while the German empire has
but 6.4 square miles Â£f area and 1712 in
habitants per railroad mile.
Great Britain makes but a modest show
in the list under its own name, having but
22,100 miles in Europe; but It has more
railroads in Tndia than in' Europe, has
two-thirds of the railroads In Africa/and
with those of its colonies in America and
Australia, counts up an aggregate of 91,
845 miles, which .is, more than twice as
much as any other natioo can claim, ex
cept the United Slates, which, with/its
197,237 miles in the middle of 1901. which
must have been as much as 200,000 by the
end of that year, may be considered hors
# concours. It has so many, in fact, that
"the burden of supporting a mile of rail
road falls on about 300 people here, while
It is divided among 2205 in .Europe. 1S84
in Great Britain and Ireland, 1425 in
France, 1712 In the German empire, 2012 In
Austria-Hungary, 1668 In Belgium and 32$5
in Italy. And besides this we are bur
dened by the support of street railroads,
which are still more numerous in pro
portion to- population than in any other
country. If any one should hint that we
get more than they cost us out of these
seemingly superabundant means of trans
portation we shall not dispute him. In
some way, we have contrived to-produce
an extraordinary amount of this world's
good?, and we suspect that our railroads
have helped more than they have hin
deredâthat, in fact, the rapid develop
ment and utilization of the resources of
this new. country have '.been made pos
sible only by our vast network of rail
roads. They have come before their time,
doubtless, sometimes, but the develop
ment of natural resources T6r the most
part is impossible without them, and wo
see that Canada has but 294 inhabitants
per mile of railroad and Austrafia but 316.
ENOBMOUS CAPITAL INVESTED^
The biggest drunkard of all is perhaps
the palm civet. So addicted is this ani
mal to the drinking habit that he has
been termed the toddy cat. And a more
helpless, foolish-looking creature than he
Is when he is thoroughly intoxicated with
the palm juice It would be difficult to
find. There are many other animals giv
en to this failing, but all those I have
spoken" of live In India and it may be
that the heat which induces extreme
thirst â a frequent â¢ excuse among men
is no doubt the direct cause of it.âCol
lier's Weekly.
The sloth bear is another animal given
to this falling. The natives of India .are
in the habit of hangng little vessels^on
the palm trees for the purpose of catchng
the juice. This juice is so attractive to
the sloth bear that, although such a poor
climber, he -will scramble up and go on
drinking the. juice until he Is sO drunk
that he can only slip helplessly to the
ground and lie there in a drunken stupor
until the effects have passed off.
But the sloth bear is not the only ani
mal who is so partial. to this Juice of the
palm tree. The curious little fox-bats
(family pteropodidae) are particurarly
fond of It. This peculiar little combina
tion of beast and bird, with its foxlike
face, reddish furry body and black, un
canny-looking wings, the delicate mem
brane of which is always quivering down
to the very tips, will fly to these vessels
in company with 'some hundreds of his
companions and they will suck the juice
until the ground below the tree will be
dark with the bodies of these bats, who
will lie there tpo helplessly intoxicated to
move or defend themselves no matter
what may turn up.
Although it has often been said, when
speaking of drunkenness, that even the
beasts of the field do not get drunk, It Is
nevertheless a fact that a great many ani
mals do get intoxicated. Take the ele
pHant, for instance. He is particularly
fond of the fruit of the Ungana tree, and,
although Â¦ he appears to have some idea
that it is not good. for him, he will go on
eating when he has once begun until he is
wildly excited and so intoxicated that he
will stagger from side to side. Every now
and then he will put himself up, shake his
)ju-j;e head and tear madly through the
forest trumpeting at the top of his voice
and terrifying every living creature.. It
is said" that he will even dare and defy his
most dreaded enemy, the .tiger, " when in
this condition, but we have no means of
verifying this. It is well known, how
ever, that an elephant is in a most
dangerous condition when suffering from
the effects of eating this beautiful fruit
and all who can take care to keep out of
his way as much as possible. â

The tables of the railroad mileage in
all the different countries of the world
published: in the last number of 4ho
Archiv fiir Eisenbahnwesen show that
in the first year of the twentieth century
the aggregate length of the railroads of
the world for the first time exceeded half
a million of miles. It was a ' year of
larger construction than any pther
since this country's great feats in that
direction between 1S79 and 18S7. The
yearly additions to the world's mileage
have been:
1S96. Â¦ 1S97. 1S9S. 1899. , 1900. 1901. j
9,706 ' 10,747 10,864 13,5a) . 10,798 16,947
Europe, Asia and Africa all built more
railroad in 1901 than in 1900; America a
little less. In comparison with previous
years, Asia has made unprecedented ad
ditions, building a little- more tha\i
Europe even in 1901, though the figures
published somewhat exaggerate â¢ this,
some of the mileage in Siberia and Man
churia credited to 1901 having had the
track laid before, though not formally
opened (as part of it is not yet).
The mileage of the railroads in opera
tion at the end of 1901 on the different
continents was:
Europe 180.70S
Asia 41,814
Africa * H.187
Old World â¢ 236,709
North America ......7 226,503
South America 28,654
Australia 15,649
New continents ..'...... 270.806
âgiving a grand total of 507,515 miles,
against 450,568 at the close of 1900. In the
above table the West Indies are included
with South America. They are together
credited with 1791 miles.
MILEAGE IN TWO AMEBICAS.
North 'America, it will be seen, has
more railroad than Europe and Asia to
gether; thÂ« two Americas, more than all
the rest of the world. For the four years
ending with 1S99 Europe built more rail
road than America, which had not hap
pened before for a long time, -but in the
two following years America nas again
built more than Europe.
As we have noted before in reviewing
these statistics, the most notable fact of
recent years has been the amount of
railroad construction in Asia and Africa.
The mileage opened as yet on those con
tinents Is trifling in comparison to their
area and population, but it is beginning,
and especially in Asia seems likely to be
continued at an increased rate. There
and in European Russia are the two great
fields promising immediate returns for the
improved transportation. Asia at the end
of 1895 had but 27,960 miles of railroad, so
that in six years it has made an increase
of 50 per cent. This has been due to
British India more than to Russia, though
the long lines of the latter country are-
more in the world's^ eye. . British India
had 23.S73 miles at the 'end of 1901, Russia
in Asia, Including the Chinese Eastern,
only 7323â but as India has forty times
the population of Asiatic Russia, this is
what should be expected. Even the in
crease in mileage in the past four years
has been greater in India, than in Asiatic
Russia. Russia, however, in that time has
built 70 per cent more railroad in Eu
rope than in Asia and has great need of
more in Europe, while its Asiatic teritory
ia yet to be developed. ' Â¦-Â¦>_'

Both children are now suffering untold

of their survival they will carry evidence
of the accident through life.
The boy, Arthur, was the proudest lad
on McAllister street when he got home
yesterday with a big brass cannon and
a quantity of powder with which to load
it. Little sister Ruth followed close on
her big brother's heels, just as proud as
he, for she carried the- punk by which the
cannon was to Ae made to do Its duty
in heralding the coming of the Fourth.
Arthur somehow dropped his powder
can and the contents spilled. Realizing
that there might be danger should Ruth's
punk come close, he ordered her to throw
the thing away. She did as ordered, but

When General Manager Chapman testi
tfed he spoke so enthusiastically of the
fcaimy climate of San Francisco that the
California Promotion Committee's press
a^rent noted the fact.
Being examined by LJvernash, Chap
rhan 6aid he knew of no city in the United
States where the climate was so favor
?.Vle for operating cars and for carmen as
San Francisco. He said that there were
â¢Vvut two public thoroughfares here where
â¢streetcar traffic becomes congestedâMar
ket and Mission streets. Where steep
grades are encountered there is a dearth
of : traffic and this could be proved by the
..fact that grass grows on the streets in
lhfse epots.
â¢ : As to getting high standard men for
'.Â¦'ormen. Chapman said that he tried to
hire the very best men he could. The
run of men hired were of the aver
age intelligence, but if he could better
.rhj?m he would always do so. He made
the rule that men must be fully five feet
â¢f'svr.ri ar.d a half inches tall and must
weigh 150 pounds. He thought the aver
age man -would come up to this standard,
j. Returning to the subject of grades.
â¢.Chapman thought that the nerve-racking
.strain on carmen in this city was not
greater, nor as much, as in many Eastern
â¢eifles. He quoted tiem York, Chicago,
Boston. Philadelphia and Kansas City.
.He thought that car work v.-as exception
ally easy here owing to the broad streets.
He. admitted that the corporation saved
roonty by net having to use fuel in the
â¢cars. On the other ha:id the hills in San
l-Tfancisco made it necessary to operate
-i.Ji'ble cars, which are more expensive
tiran the electric.
â¢The case will be resumed Monday morn
ing- at 30 o'clock, when Manager Chapman
Â«i;i present tables shewing the earnings

The arbitration proceedings between the
â¢Carmen's Union and the United Railroads
wÂ«re resumed yesterday morning. The
session was rather brief. President Cor
nelius of the Carmen's Union and Mana
. Â«^r Chapman of the United Railroads
wen reoalled.
.Cornelius testified that in April he met
President George A- Newhall. also the
.secretary and one of the directors, of the
Union-street line. President Newhall was
then notified by him that the carmen on
ihÂ» TJnion-etreet line wanted their wages
increased to $3 for a day of nine hours.
Cornelius testified that Xewhall heard the
cemands patiently and said he could not
then answer positively whether the com
pany would pay $3 a day. but he was
willing to raise the wages 25 cents a day.
â¢itcn were then earning $2 60. Cornelius
ea'd that no further action was then
taken In the matter. The men thought
their cervices were worth $3 a day and
would not accept $2 75. Another reason
for the refusal was because they knew
th>t arbitration would take place between
the carmen of the United Railroads and
their employers and they wanted to
vwa'.t results. '

ties.
The plans submitted show a basement
in the front, which Is to face O'Farrell
street. The basement will have two en
trances and two stairways will lead from
it to the first floor. It is arranged for one
classroom, a cloakroom, laboratories,
heater and fuel rooms. .
The first story can be reached from the
outside by three entrances. The arrange
ment shown for it on the plans provides
for two classrooms, a central hall and the
auditorium.
On the; second story, reached by two
staircases at the ends of the building,
will be two classrooms, a room for the
principal, cloak and toilet rooms, also the
auditorium gallery and balcony.
On the third story there will be I two
classrooms, a physical laboratory, a
chemical laboratory, each with a store
room and a large lecture-room, also a
teachers'- room, closets and toilet.
The. building is to be provided with mod
ern heating and ventilating apparatus and
is to be wired for electric lighting.
The estimated cost of the building Is
$165,000. .. ' . -
On the ground floor there are to be
lunchrooms, workrooms and' the like, stor
age and carpenter rooms, a boiler and a
fuelroom. The building is to be heated
and ventilated and wired for electric

brick, with sandstone trimmings of the
same general style of architecture and
finish as the present Girls' High School.

vestibule, adjoining which are a main re
ception and a teachers' room. "
Two nights of stairs will lead to the
upper stories. On the first floor will be

samples of the twenty-seven school build
ings that are to be constructed under the
new bond issue, to be passed upon by the
voters at a special election.
The plaintiff alleges that the members
of the board have not been appointed by
the Governor nor by any other person,
board or officer having authority under
the constitution. The plaintiff desires the
defendants ousted, as each of them has
usurped and ?ntruded into the office and
unlawfully exercises the functions there
of.

elected as members of the Board of Medical
Examiners of the State of California by these
several medical societies hereinbefore referred
to, to wit, the said defendants, Dudley Talt.
David Powell. D. E. Oeborne. W. S. Thorne
and B. L. Wilbur, and were elected as such
members of said board by the said medical *o

of the I/ecislature hereinbefore referred to;
and by reason of said appointments as above
set forth said defendant*, and each of them,
claim to be public civil officers, to wit, mem
bers of said Board of Medical Examiners. of
the State of California. But said elections and
appointments, and the election and appoint
ments of each of said defendants were and are
without authority of law and are null and
void.
That there is no other provision made by
law (or the appointment of said officers, to
wit, the said nretnbers of the said Board of
Medical Examiners of the State of California.
That each of raid societies is a private, civil
corporation, organized and existing under the
laws of the State, and has no authority, and
neither of them has any authority uno^r the
constitution and laws of the State to elect or
appoint said members of e&ld board, or any or
either of the members of said board.
Joined by the Attorney General.
The complaint sets forth that at the
thirty-fourth session of the Legislature
an act was passed entitled "An act for
the regulation of the practice of medicine
and surgery in the State of California
and for the appointment of a board of
medical examinera." This act became a
law without the Governor's approval,
February 27, 1901, and a. board consisting
of nine members was appointed. The act
fixed their compensation and directed that
five members be elected by the Medical
Society of the State of California, two
members by the California State Homeop
athic Medical Society and two members
by the Eclectic Medical Society.
The complaint recites the following:
