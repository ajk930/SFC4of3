Prince Galitzin, who was sent to his
present post a year ago last April, was
charged with having recommended the
transfer of the church property and sev
eral times his life has been threatened
Dispatches from Trans-Caucasia within
the last month show considerable unrest
at Tiflis on account of the transfer of the
Armenian church property to -the Russian
Government and the decree of June 25.
Demonstrations have been reported at va
rious points, in which quite a number of
lives were lost, and the Armenian church
authorities are said to have threatened
to transfer the headquarters of the Ar
menian Catholic church to another coun
try.
The outrage has produced great Indig
nation, the Governor General having be
come very popular on account of his in
terest for the welfare of the people.
On account of the excitement that pre
vailed all the theaters suspended business.
The heavy cJoak worn by the Prince un
doubtedly saved his life.
After his injuries had been dressed
Prince Galitzin attended a banquet given
by the citizens of Tiflis.
TIFLJS, Russian Trans-Caucasia. Oct.
2S.â Prince Galitzin, Governor General of
the Caucasia, had a narrow escape from
assassination to-day on the outskirts of
the town. Three natives stabbed the Gov-i
ernor General thrice. They fled, but were
subsequently shot down by Cossacks.
Prince Galitzin was driving with his
wife when the would-be assassins rushed
upon the carriage, daggers in hands. Two
seized the Governor General and attempt
ed to drag him from the vehicle, while
the third man Inflicted two ugly wounds
on the Prince's head and a third cut on
the hand.
A Cossack who was in attendance upon
the Prince threw himself upon the. assail
ants. While a hand-to-hand fight was in
progress the carriage was driven off at a
gallop. Ultimately the assailants fled,
followed by a mounted guard of Cossacks,
who had hurried to the scene.
The Cossacks chased the fugitives
through the brush, firing constantly with
their rifles. They killed one man In
stantly. The other two were shot down
and died soon afterward.
The toilet is located In the basement of
the building. It is open day and night.
While the stuff may have been there un
noticed for a longer time, it Is believed
it was placed in the basement to-day.
An explosion of dynamite occurred at
First and Jackson streets to the rear of
the Capitol Hotel early Tuesday morning,
not more than 150 feet from the depot
building. Then it was supposed that the
explosion was the work of some drunken
man. Now the matter is viewed in a dif
ferent light and a searching investigation
is being made by detectives.
' Three weeks ago a man, who gave his
name as Will Shannon, was arrested in
the Idaho saloon in the restricted dis
trict, with fourteen sticks of dynamite' in
his pockets. He claimed the stuff had
been given him by an unknown man. A
few days after he was : identified as a de
serter from the army; and was surren
dered to the authorities at Fort Lawton. 1
Two days after the arrest of Shannon
a man named Robinson, while walking
on the* Arlington dock,', came "across" two'
sticks of 'the explosive hidden between a
pile and . the \ run-beam of 'the wharf.
General Manager ' Grant of the street
railway company, when informed of the
find in the depot, said:
"I cannot Imagine why It should be
placed there. We have not had any trou
ble with any one which would be likely
to inspire such a crime." s
SEATTLE, Oct. 28.â Twelve . sticks of
dynamite done up in two packages, with
split fuses attached all ready to light,
were found concealed In the toilet of the
Interurban depot. First avenue south and
Jackson street, this* afternoon. There
was enough of the explosive to have
blown up all the . buildings within a ra
dius of two blocks and to damage proper
ty for a distance of ten blocks from the
depot.
The news of the startling discovery was
received at the police station over the
telephone, and Police Sergeant Stuart
made a personal investigation.
One package, containing six sticks, had
been carefully rolled up and placed be
hind the washstand of the toilet. The
other, containing the same amount, had
been wrapped in the same manner and
secreted from view behind the toilet
bowl. Around each of the packages in
side of the paper in which they were
rolled was a long fuse so arranged as to
connect with the sticks. The end of each
of these fuses had been split with a knife
for a distance of about an inch, exposing
the powder to view through the wrapper
and would permit of immediate ignition.
The discovery was made by a laborer
named Wilson. When his eye fell on the
package behind the washstand and the
fact that it was concealed struck him as
peculiar. He pulled it out and discovered
it was dynamite.

Accompanied by Professor Milyoukov of
the University of Chicago, Crane spent
several weeks in Bulgaria. When \ it was
noised about that the Chicagoan, besides
his wealth, was intimate with President
Roosevelt, ex-President Cleveland and
other Influential Americans, the insur
gents proposed to capture him on J the
occasion of one of his journeys to Rila
Monastery, near the frontier, where the
country swarms with bands and the hills
are Inaccessible. .Crane, when advised of
the plot, laughed unconcernedly.
SOFIA, Oct. 28.â Saraf off 's- insurgents a
few weeks ago were considering a plan
to capture Charles R. CraW the Chicago
millionaire, andrholdhim In the hope of
inducing the United States to interfere
in the Macedonian crisis. ,'The plot was
abandoned on the urgent 'representation
of Dr. Tataricheff,". chief of the inner In
surgent council, that it would cause the
Macedonians the loss of the sympathy of
the world.
Special Dispatch to The Call
According to a circumstantial account
published this morning, two foreigners
were seen making their way toward the
Thames soon after the murder of Sa
gouni. As a foreign sloop disappeared
immediately afterward, it is believed the
murderers escaped therein.
Other witnesses testified to Sagouni's
lively protests against the collection of
funds in the United States by the rival
faction. The inauest developed little be
yond what is already known. H. Smith,
a man living in the house of the de
ceased, heard the shots and went to a
window in time to see the assassin hold
open a wooden gate with his right hand
and fire the last shot at Sagouni with me
pistol In his left hand. The revolver was
single acting and required cocking be
tween each shot, and the rapidity of the
fire suggested that the assassin was an
expert in handling the weapon.
Sagouni was always well armed. A
stiletto in a case was found attached to
the inside of the lett breast of his coat.
He also had an automatic revolver.
A member of the Armenian society who
described its object as being "to free my
land from Turkish rule." testified that he
was with Sagouni when the latter died.
Sagouni was unable to identify the mur
derer as the same man he saw on board
the boat while coming to England from
Dieppe, France, but the society believes
he is identical. Sagounl'a home was at
Baku. Trans-Caucasia.
A verdict of willful murder was ren
dered.
LONDON, Oct. 23.â The search of the
police for" the murderer of Sagatel Sa
gounl, president of the Armenian Revo
lutionary Society in London, who was
shot and killed by an unknown assassin
in the suburb of Nunhead late Monday
evening,: had been futile up to noon to
day. Several foreign revolutionary clubs
were raided during the early hours of
the morning, but with' no result.
The inquest opened to-day and it trans
pired that the police yesterday evening
were misinformed on the subject of the
pistol used by the assassin being an' au
tomatic ten-shooter. It is an ordinary
five-shot silver plated revolver, num
bered 1056. .
An Important point developed at the In
quest was that the murderer shot with
his left hand.

PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 28.â The unusual
spectacle of the explosion of sixty tons
of dynamite in three blasts of twenty
tons each was seen at Bugby Hole, on the
Columbia River, about twenty, miles
above Astoria, Or., to-day. The blasts,
which were fired simultaneously, were ex
ploded for the purpose of securing rock
for the construction of the jetty at the
mouth of the Columbia River. The face
of the bluff for hundreds of feet was torn
away with a shock which shook the earth
for miles around. It is estimated that
100,000 tons of rock were dislodged by the
explosions. So great was the force of the,
explosions that the tracks of the Astoria
and Columbia River Railroad, which run'
near the quarries, were .torn from their
fastenings and the roadbed covered with
a mass of granite, which will take at least
twenty-four hours to remove. Traffic on
that section of the road will "be delayed
for a somewhat longer period.

In the future the sombrero will be the

and the white "plug" stand for the senior

other class will be allowed to wear the
sombrero and any girl of any other class
caught wearing them will be warned that
she is encroaching. '- Some of the Â¦ more
radical of the leaders In - this new move
ment advocated tearing the sombreros
from the heads of their sisters, as the

tbe calmer ones prevailed in their advo
cacy of persuasive and pacific measures.
In other words there will be no "rush

noon to take action on the petition of
the Geary-street Railway to operate Its
cars for a temporary period from No
vember 6, the date of tbe exDiratlon of
Its franchise, until a new franchise is
granted by the board.. Chairman Braun
hart has consulted with . a prominent at
torney and Is of the opinion that it will
not be necessary to pass a formal reso
lution granting: a temporary permit, but
that it will be sufficient to tacitly allow
the company to continue operating the
line until the new franchise is granted
to the highest bidder, which will be some
time In April. It is aimed to prevent the
surrendering to the company any rights
which mlzht stop the award of a new
franchise under the terms of the charter.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 28.â Advices re

official sources indicate that there again
has been a change In the sentiment ia the
Colombian Senate respecting the Panama
canal, and there Is a considerable increase
of the strength of the element which is
willing to make terms with the United
States. The agents of the State Depart
ment have found It difficult to make plain
the fact, even to the Colombians, that the
Hay-Herran canal treaty is absolutely
and finally dead and that no act of the
Colombian Senate can resurrect it If
there Is to be anything done in the direc
tion of the Panama canal under United
States control It therefore must be the
result of entirely new negotiations, and
none such ha\*e been instituted.

Concerning the announcement to the
effect that the United Railroads . would
soon discontinue the exchange of trans
fers with the Geary-street. Park and
Ocean Railroad, the officials of tbe for
mer company said yesterday that the
termination of the long existing relations
between the two companies was in no
way to be construed as a plan of the
larger corporation to acquire the prop
erty of the smaller one.
According to a statement of the repre
sentatives of the United Railroads, when
the latter came Into possession of the
Market-street system it found a transfer
and traffic arrangement existing between
that company and the Geary-street Com
pany which It considered quite one
sided in its character, in that It consid
ered that the Market-street Company
was getting a comparatively small return
for the privileges granted. Â«Â¦-
"The fact is," remarked one of the
officials yesterday, Â¦ "that more than a
year ago the. United Railroads gave- notice
to the Geary-street Company that the
transfer and traffic arrangement between
the two companies would cease after the
expiration of the minimum time required
for that purpose upon the then existing
contract between the two companies; but
at the request of the Geary-street Com
pany, however, the arrangements then in
existence were permitted to continue In
force In a modified form until November
1. 1903."

was missing. During his absence two
men called and asked to be shown a
room. Mrs. Rothman conducted them to
the apartment occupied 'by Chen, as he
had signified his Intention of leaving. It
is supposed that the two strangers saw
the wallet lying on the dresser and pur
loined It. Detective Bailey has been de

- The police. In trying to handle tha
crowd, shoved many persons Into the gut

fights were barely averted. . â¢
Toward noon the crowds gradually
diminished and the panic was allayed to
such an extent that many persons made
new' deposits Instead of withdrawing the
old. . Â¦â¢ - Â¦. - â¢'..Â¦ y/ -f^'^'L/j.
When- as many persons as' could be ac
commodated at one time in. the banking
rooms had 'formed 'in the two' lines further,
admission was refused until eome of the
first-comers had . left by a separate en
trance, then others were admitted and
forced to keep in line and leave as soon
as they .had transacted their business.
By 10 o'clock 'the- crowd around the
building had increased to such an extent
that the police were totally unable to
control It and the officers stationed at
the doors were swept away from "their
stations, almost as rapidly as they could
regain them.'
Women, who, as on ' Tuesday, consti
tuted a large percentage of .the crowd,
were crushed In the Jam, and In the strug
gle their dreseea were torn and their hats
knocked off. - '

Owing to the action taken last night
by the officials of the eight trust com
panies doing business in fit Louis re
quiring thirty and sixty day notices of
Intention to withdraw funds, depositors
were .not able to get any j money. All
they could do was to declare their inten
tion of withdrawing their deposits at the
end of the .time- taken advantage of by
the companies under their rules. The
trust companies also decided not to pay
certificates of deposit- before maturity.
The greatest crowd was before the"
doora of the .Mercantile Trust Company.
Locust and Eighth streets were- Jammed
for a distance of several .hundred feet,
and all efforts to' keep thenr -'clear were
practically abandoned, while the police
directed their efforts chiefly toward main
taining some degree of order aÂ£ the doorsl.
At 9 o'clock the doors were opened and

some semblance of order was restored.
ST. LOUIS, Oct.- 28.-The statement of
President Julius S. Walsh of the Missis
sippi Valley Trust Company, whose senti
ments are echoed in statements given by
other trust company officials of St. Louis-,
that "the situation is thoroughly in hand,
the excitement has subsided and from
this on we expect business will be con
tinued in the usual orderly manner," ex
presses the opinion that seems general
to-night after .the unwonted financial
changes that prevailed here during parts
of yesterday and to-day. Officers of all
the trust companies say that voluntary
offers of help were received from financial
Institutions in New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago. New Orleans, Kansas City.. Bos
ton and many of the smaller towns of
Missouri and Illinois. . but . all were de
clined., for the reason that they had suf
ficient cash with which to handle their
business. Expressions of confidence and
offers of aid on the part of national banks
and other financial institutions . of St.
Louis helped to strengthen the situation
and restore confidence.
Long before 10 o'clock this morning, the
hour of opening, lines of depositors
stretched away from the doors of the
Mississippi Valley Trust Company, the
Lincoln Trust Company, the Mercantile
Trust Company and the Missouri Trust
Company. Small crowds were assembled
before the doors of the other savings
institutions near by. It was observed that
most of those In line were working peo
ple and many of them women, whose
savings were not heavy..

Further advices have 'been received by
the State Department from United States
Minister Powell touching the outbreak of
the revolution, confirming the report of
tbe seizure of the port, of Puerto Plata
by adherents of the late President. Jim-
Inez, who are seeking to overthrow Pres
ident Wos y OIL He makes no mention
of the reported blockade of that port by
the Government warship Independencia

WASHINGTON, Oct. Â».â Acting Secre
tary of the Navy Darling this afternoon
sent orders to the "Norfolk navy yard for
the cruiser Baltimore to proceed forth
wltb to Puerto Plata, Santo Domingo, to
look after American Interests at that
blockaded port. It is believed the Balti
more will leave to-morrow and 'should
arrive at her destination by Tuesday. .,
The police this afternoon put the entire
Bechtel family except the mother under
thorough examination. All denied any
knowledge of how Mabel came to her
death or who placed her body In the
area way under the home on Tuesday
morning. Martha, John and Charles were
discharged after they had been examined.
Thomas was held as a witness before the
Coioner's jury because of supposed blood
stains found on his overalls and in his
room. Eckstein was similarly held. Neither
could get the ball of 51000 asked for. The
mother was not called because of her
hysterical condition.
Eckstein was Miss Bechtel's accepted
lover, though she also received attentions,
from Welsenberg. Eckstein and the girl
were to have been married on November
22, but the' event was recently postponed
until Christmas. They had frequent quar
rels over Weisenberg's attentions, Eck
stein being jealous of him. He had ex
pressed threats to several persons that
he would kill both. It is said he occa
sionally beat' Miss Bechtel severely, and
as recently as last Thursday evening,
when they went to Philadelphia together,
Eckstein was seen to pummel her on one
of the . principal street corners, whence
the trolley leaves for Philadelphia. Be-
. cause .of. this and because Eckstein was
at. the Bechtel home on Monday evening
h.e is being .held. The Bechtel family
Â¦sided with. Eckstein, preferring him to
Welsenberg as a prospective- member of
their /amily. Welsenberg wasnot allowed
to enter the Bechtel homeland In the
year and a half that he courted the girl
he never did so in her own home. They
met on the street and went , to public
'places together..
Police Sergeant jÂ£nauss returned to Al
lentown from New York to-day with
. Weisenberg. The, latter gave -ardetailed
statement of his movements., . since -Sunr
day, which was corroborated"fullyv "He
had not seen the girl since Sunday even
ing; then he met her by appointment on

tachment for Welsenberg; that a blow
struck in anger may have been more Be-;,

girl's murder was thus accomplished and
the body disposed of as found, the story
being concocted as related by, the mother.

In a police station cell, the Allentown po
lice are resting their work on the- murder
case of yesterday morning until Coroner
Schelrer'a Jury meets to-morrow evening.
.The mystery 'â¢ Is still, practically un
solved, except that Indications point to a
family quarrel, in which Eckstein may
have participated, as he admits he was at
MIsb Bechtel's home on Monday evening
for an hour and a half. Because Mrs.
Bechtel had said her daughter had left
for a drive on Monday morning at 9
o'clock efforts Were made to trace , the
girl's movements away from home.
-Rumors that she was at a roadhouse near
the city were found to be groundless, and
the police do not believe the girl was
away from home at all on Monday. Her
brothers, Thomas, John and Charles, say
they did not see her on that day, and bo
says her sister Martha.
The father became suspicious some
time ago, when tbe young man demanded
money. How much he secured the old
man .will not tell, but he notified tbe po
lice of the Imposition to-day. The alleged
son Is supposed to be an Italian. It la
believed that he met the lost son of the
Hechtman s in his travels and learned all
the history of his lifo from him. The
scar was faked.
PORTLAND, Or.. Oct. 28.â Marcus
Hechtman, who. passed himself off as the
long lost son of Benjamin Hechtman, is
said to.be an impostor. Last September
he" walked Into ' Hechtman' s ' second-hand
store and represented himself as his son,
who had dlsapneared fifteen years ago.
The mother and sister took him to their
arms. He said he had been, kidnaped by
a red-hatred woman and taken to Eu
rope, where he learned to be an acrobat.
He would, not tell the names of those who
kidnaped him, saying that he hoped to
take out his revenge on them. His identi
fication was made complete by a scar on
his face.
Special IMspfttch to The OH.
Professor Hilgard subsequently for
warded a quantity of rushes to thÂ« mat
ting factory in Maine, where they were
given a practical trial. They turned out
to be superior In many respects to the
rushes now imported from Japan and
China and the manufacturers were ac
cordingly pleased. A piece of mattingâ
the first ever woven from American-grown
grassâ was received at tba university to
day.
Now that the California rush baÂ» been
found good for matting the plant Intro
duction bureau of the United States De
partment of Agriculture Is interesting
itself in the subject. Several hundred
roots of the smaller native rush, from
which tbe first matting was made, were
recently sent to Washington by the uni
versity. They will be used for experi
mental culture In various parts of the
United States.
- The experiments with California rushes
were made by Rufus H. Sawyer, manager
of tbe Goodall Matting Company of
Maine, who met Professor Hilgard white
visiting the university and after a visit-*
to Japan. He learned then that California
rushes are being used largely by the
Italians In the vegetable markets of San
Francisco and asked that he be supplied
with samples from the various marshes
in the State.
Berkeley Office San -Francisco Call,
ZUS Center street, Oct. 23.
Tbe way for a new and profitable in
dustry for California has been opened by
Professor E. W. Hllgard. head of the
agricultural college at the University of
California. It is the fanning of the tales
or native rushes of California, which have
been found to make as good mats as those
that have been Imported for years, from
Japan or China. Not only may the rushes
be fanned but capital may Dulld' factories
In California to manufacture matting.
The Crar refers with Dleasure to hlÂ» own
visit to I'arU and to the visit of President
Loubet to St. I'ttersbunr. Russia, continues
the tetter, will firmly pursue the policy of.
peace enunciated in his previously expr*Â«Â«Â»<l
views and affirmed by his Initiative in the
bringing about of The Hogrue arbitration court.
He hopes to remain a friend and ally of
France and to co-ot)erate with France In the
peaceful task of securing a happy settlement
of oendins Question* in both the Near Eaet
and the far East. The letter conclude* with
the presentation of the Czarina's compllnv?nts
to President Loubet.
Count Lamsdorn* will give a breakfast
st tbe Hotel Rltz Friday In honor of M.
Delcasse, which will be attended by
prominent French and Russian officials,
including Count Casslnl.
The final event of the visit will take
place Friday evening, when M. Delcasse
will be the host at a dinner, at which the
ladles of the diplomatic corps. Including
Countess Cassini, will be present.
The presence of Cotmt Casslni at the
dinner Is considered to indicate that the
attitude of the United States Is a factor
In the present discussions. Count Cas-
Einl's knowledge of Chinese affairs is also
expected to serve a useful purpose.
A French official In close touch with
M. Delcasse informed the Associated
Press to-night that as a result of the ex
change between M. Delcasse and Count
I^amsdorff France recognized the para
mount importance of the Interests of Rus
ela and Austria in the Balkans and there
fore waives her former objections to rep
resentatives of these countries alone su
pervising the execution of reforms there.
France thus supports the attitude of Rus
sia In the carrying out of these reforms.
The situation in the Far East also was
discussed with the result that the atti
tude of France will not be modified by
the possibility of war between Russian
and Japan.
Though the Czar's letter to President
IÂ»ubet has not yet been made public, the |
Echo de Paris gives the following sum- i
mary of Its contents, which it claims is
correct:
TblÂ» evening 1 Prince Ourosof gave a
email and select dinner at the Russian
embassy, which was a ' veritable . love
feast. Among those present were Count
Lexnsdorn*. M. Delc&see; Count Casslnl,
Russian Embassador . at Washington;
Count Beckendorf, Russian Embassador
at LÂ«ondon; M. Murarleff. Russian Minis
ter of Justice; several French officials
And tbe staff of tbe Russian embassy.
Count Lamsdorff Is greatly pleased with
the character of his reception and Is con
f.dent that French feeling toward Russia
is as cordial as ever. He declared he is
here to do everything to show the friend
ship entertained by the Czar for the
French.
PARIS, Oct. 2S.â The* first formal con
ference between Count Lamsdorff and M.
Delcaase occurred at tbe Foreign Office
this afternoon. Tbe Russian Foreign Min
ister remained fully an hour with M. Del
caase. Later thÂ« two statesmen proceed
ed together to tbe Elysee, where President
Ixmbet received Count Lamsdorff, who
gave tbe President of tbe French republic
an autograph letter from the Crar. The
conference at the Elysee lasted over an
hour and ten minutes. t
At 2 o'clock a lucky shift In the wind,
coupled with"' desperate work by the flre
department, resulted in the flames being
brought under control.'

THEEE TEACHEBS BETIEE
FROM SCHOOL DEPARTMENT
Mr. Lynch's predominant character
istic is his sympathetic nature. As one
of his admirers said the other day:
"Henry Lynch has spent the greater por
tion of his time for twenty years hunt
ing Jobs for poor devils out of work. His
heart is so big that I wonder he can car
ry it around. He has earned two or
three fortunes and has given them
away. He stakes his sick friends, hires
doctors for them, takes care of their
families and when they recover provides
them with work. A nobler, more sym
pathetic, more generous fellow doesn't
live than Henry Lynch.
"I remember." this gentleman contin
ued, "a single instance of his generosity,
which is only one of a thousand. "While
he was building the Powell-street road
out near the Presidio one of his laborers
fell by the wayside. This man had a
large family. His name was Kelly and
he lived somewhere down on Tar Flat.
Lynch was busy those days, and he did
not miss Kelly from among his hundreds
of employes until one windy, blustering
afternoon in winter, when, covered with
dirt, he was laying track on Jackson
street hills, a ragged little girl about 6
years old. weeping with cold, accosted
him. .
â¢The child was half clad, blue and
nearly frozen. She was Kelly's oldest
girl. She had walked three miles in a
driving wind to see Lynch. She told
him, between chatters, that her papa was
sick and that her mother and brothers
and sisters having gone the limit at
the grocery and butcher shop, were
getting perilously near starvation. For
three dfu - s none of them had had a meal.
What did Lynch say to her? Did he
tell her to go away and not bother him,
as most busy men situated as he was
would have done? Not much. The.
devil,' said Lynch, 'this won't do!' He
quit work, wrapped the child in his over
coat, got into his bugfcy and drove her
home. He did this just as a matter of
course and without thinking.
"The' Kelly family had something to
eat that night, you bet. A doctor was
employed and the trouble was over.
Lynch put Kelly back on the payroll and
paid him hisi wages for eight weeks,
though he didn't do a stroke of work the
whole time. The little girl is a woman
now, and has children of her own. Maybe
you think the whole family ain't out
hunting for votes for Henry Lynch.
"Lynch has been doing this sort of
thing- all his life, and you can find hun
dreds of men till over San Francisco who
will knock you down if you say a word
against him. If he Is elected Sheriff I
predict that he will put In his time sign
ing petitions for pardons for the miser
able devils he is compelled to lock up
and paying the rent of the poor families
the courts order him to evict. Ho spends
all his money that way now. and he Is
too old to change. In fact, he has the
largest private pension roll of any man
in San Francisco to-day.
"But it don't make any difference
whether he is elected Sheriff or not. God
will take care of him. A noble fellow like
that Is sure to prosper, and when he
dies he will take his seat In heaven
along with the angels, and don't you for
get It." â¢
On his return to this city, about 1884,
Mr. Lynch, backed by Thomas Magee,
W. H. Martin. John Ballard and others,
obtained a franchise from the Board of
Supervisors under which he built the
Powell-street cable railway system.
Upon the completion of that road he be
came Its superintendent and general
manager. He continued in that position
until the consolidation with the Market
street company's system; then he was
appointed superintendent of construction
of all the roads owned by that corpora
tion â a position he has since tilled and
now fills under the United Railroads
Company.
As chief engineer of the principal
streetcar system of San Francisco, Mr.
Lynch has built all the extensions of the
Market-street company, including the
San Mateo line, and has thus acquired
a national reputation as a constructor
of urban railways. For years he has
been the largest employer of labor in San
Francisco, and the fact that he is uni
versally loved and respected by all hi3
employes proves that he is a Just, sym
pathetic and upright man.
During the strike on the Sutter-street
car line many years ago he gave several
of the strikers work on the Powell-street
road. In fact, there are men employed
on the Powell-street line to-day who
were put there by Mr. Lynch during this
strike. He has never had a dispute with
his men about hours or wages. Having
worked with his hands all his life, his
heart and sympathies are invariably with
the toilers.
Henry H. Lynch, the Republican can
didate for Sheriff, is an interesting char
acter. He came to California from Wis
consin when a boy of 16. and at first
worked at the carpenter's trade. Later
on he went Into the planing mill busi
ness, and his hands still bear the scars
of several encounters with the knives
and saws of this establishment. About
1876 he entered the employ of General
Thomas H. Williams, father of "Tom"
Williams, the California Jockey Club
magnate. General Williams set him to
reclaiming â¢ his Sacramento River
marshes, and while so engaged Lynch
became an expert dredging engineer.
After the death of Williams he went to
Panama with the late H. B. Slaven and
for two or three years carried on dredg
ing operations under Panama canal con
tracts awarded by the De Lesseps Com
pany.
(Tnm thÂ« "Evtnln* Bulletin." October 21.)
The committee of druggists represented
to Mayor Schmitz that the ordinance Is
unjust, as it would compel the manufac
turers of medicines to make public the
formula used In their preparations to the
detriment of their business. They claimed
that the ordinance was unconstitutional
in that no citizen could be forced to di
vulge the secrets of his trade. They
urged the Mayor to veto the ordinance
and his Honor, being impressed with 'the
arguments put forth, .promised to give
the matter his earnest consideration. He
said he would see the health officials and
ascertain the object of the ordinance and
what abuse It was designed to cure. It
was explained that the ordinance was
aimed at goods preserved by artificial
means, but that Its comprehensive terms
would bring all articles under Its prohibi
tory provisions.
The penalty provided for each violation
of the ordinance is a fine of $500 or im
prisonment In the County Jail for six
months, or by both such fine and Impris
onment.
A delegation of local druggists headed
by S. A. McDonnell and W. A. Searby
waited on Mayor SchmitE yesterday and
strongly protested against the ordinance
passed by the Board of Supervisors at
Its last meeting which requires the plac
ing of labels on packages containing sub
stances, intended for human consumption.
The ordinance is designed to aid In the
enforcement of the provisions of the new
sanitary code recently adopted by the
Board of Health and is now in the hands
of the Mayor for his approval or veto. ;
The druggists are up in arms against
the enacting clause of the ordinance
which makes It a misdemeanor for "any
person, firm or corporation to sell or of
fer for sale or give away any package,
box or bottle containing any drug or sub
stance or fluid intended for human con
sumption, unless such package, box or
bottle have thereon a label showing, in
plain Roman letters, the name and true
quality and ingredients of the contents
thereof."
The board decided to order grade
changes on South Broderick, Tilden and
Lotta streets and Park Hill and Parnas
sus avenues and overruled protests
against the changes.
M. Joyce of the Laborers' Protective
Union appeared before the board in sup
port of its petition that the pay of labor
ers be raised from $2 50 to $3. The Board
of Supervisors had passed the matter up
to" the Beard of Works. Commissioner
Schmltz wanted a motion put fixing the
per diem of laborers at $3, but President
Casey refused to put the motion, saying
he rteslrcd to take the matter up with a
view to having the pay of all laborers. in
the city's employ raised, including those
under the Park Commission.
"If any one -puts a drop of oil In front
of my property I will shoot him down,"
said the irate Blank.
H. U. Jaudln. president of the Point
Lobos Improvement Club, said the pro
testants were obstructionists and declared
that if the street were oiled it would
never be accepted by the city. His side
threatened to have the crossings of the
street bitumlnized, as a protest In that
case would be of no avail. The board
thereupon postponed action for two weeks
in the hope that the opposing property
owners would settle their differences.
The City Engineer was directed to draw
up plans for a sewer to Connect with the
new Flood building at Market and Powell
streets and the Mission-street sewer. The
work is of some magnitude, as the sewer
will be built along Market street and then
under the Market-street sewer and the
cable road at the Fifth-street, crossing
and thence along Fifth street to Mission.
The Market-street sewer is higher than
the basement of the building, which ne
cessitates the adoption of another plan.
Property-owners In the Richmond dis
trict locked horns at yesterday's meeting
of tha Board of Public Works over the
petition of the Point Lobos Improvement
Club that Clement street, from First to
Tenth avenues, be bituminlzed and the
width of sidewalks be reduced by three
feet. M. Kewberry had secured a two
thirds protest against the performance of
the work and asked the board to abandon
the proceedings. After considerable de
bate Newberry stated that his clients fa
vored the treating of Clement street with
oil. This caused angry protests from the
opposition and G. A. Blank became much
excited.
C. I* Wayland was the next witness.
He produced various documents used as
evidence In the case and one concerning
the payment of a freight bill of $1SOO by
the Postmaster of San Francisco on be
half of the Government for the time In
dicators. The witness said that he had
seen eighteen patented devices and the
models In Machen's office, the most of
which devices were much simpler than
the one offered by Richardson and his
associates. One of the time Indicator de
vices could be manufactured and sold at
75 cents. It was the practice and the duty
of the department, he said, to advertise
or Invite bids for patented articles of all
kinds from typewriters down, and there
was no urgency or other reason why the
bids had not been solicited in this case.
The investigation will be resumed at
2 p. m. to-day.
Further testimony was taken yester
day by United States Court Commissioner
Heacock In the matter of the extradition
of James W. Erwln. who was indicted
In Washington, D. C. with A. W. Ma
chen and George W. Beavers for con
spiring to defraud the Government. The
witnesses were Daniel S. Richardson, su
perintendent of the San Francisco post
office, and C. I* Wayland. a postofflce In
spector from Washington, D. C
The examination was conducted by
United States District Attorney Marshall
B. Woodworth on behalf of the Govern
ment. Samuel Knight appeared for Er
wln.
Letters written by Richardson as presi
dent of the Postal Device and Improve
ment Company to Perry Heath and
Messrs. Machen and Beavers, and letters
from them to Richardson In reply, were
introduced In evidence and Identified by.
Richardson. They were all on the sub
ject of the adoption by the Government of
the time Indicator made by Richardson's
company.
President Richardson testified that he
received a letter In 1899 from Perry S.
Heath informing him that the Government
had decided to give the Montague time
indicator device a test. Richardson bad
proposed that the department should equip
2OS9 letter boxes In California with the
improvement at the cost of $4 per box.
On the following January he received an
order from the department for 7000 boxes.
The size of the order surprised him and
he said he did not know why
an order had been given for 7000 when
the'order for only 20S9 had been solicited.
In February, 1900, the witness had sent
some stock In the Postal Device and Im
provement Company to Machen and
Beavers as a gift. The witness explained
that the price of $4 for each of the small
est sized devices had been fixed, based
upon the cost of manufacture, the freight
and the expense of attaching the Indi
cators to the boxes. It was found that
the price was inadequate and it was
raised to $4, $4 50 and $5 for the different
sizes.
In response* to searching inquiries of
Mr. Woodworth Richardson admittted
that the Government had paid all the
freight In addition to the Increased price
on the boxes. The Government also had
paid the cost of attaching the devices to
the boxes in all places outside of San
Francisco. The cost of the attachments
in this city was defrayed by the Rich
ardson company. He admitted also that
there was no reason of urgency why the
devices should have been purchased with
out bids having been asked for. Out of
the sale of the 7000 boxes Richardson and
h's company received from the Govern
ment about $30,000. he said.
In July, 1903. his company received an
order from the department for 10,000 more
boxes, but the order was rescinded before
the company had had time to fill it. In
June. 1903, the witness wrote certain de
tails about which It was necessary for
him and his company to have an under
standing with the department, and he
gave the letter to Mr. Erwln with the
request tha.t he should show It to Mr.
Machen.
Auditor Baehr In replying to the tardi
ness of the getting out of the fiscal re
port, jays that it is utterly Impossible to
get the figures together in the time al
lotted by the charter. The expert of the
Board - of Supervisors did not finish with
the accounts until long after the first of
September, the date on which the charter
provides that the Auditor's report shall be
ready.
The 'Treasurer of the city holds every
demand of this amount of money, which
the Examiner wants to know what has
become of. All that It has to do is to
examine the official reports of the two of
fices controlling the city's funds and the
truth of -the above statements will be
manifest.
The Auditor's report shows a surplus
of between $30,000 and $40,000 for the last
fiscal year.
The park fund appropriation set aside
the mum of $283,500. An amount of 1315,
677 80 was audited, a sum In excess of the
appropriation,- but the money derived
from taxes and other revenues, along
with the 7 per cent of all taxes provided
by the charter to go to the park fund,
amounted, with the provision, to $322,
700 45,. leaving a surjjlus of over $7000.
The school fund appropriation amounted
to $1,220,000, and., with the surplus amount
ing to $133,451 61. the fund was increased to
$1,358,451 61. The amount audited was
$1,313,017 33. leaving a surplus of over $15,
000. . , - Â¦
Net one cent of the above money amount
ing to the sum of $391,670 64 was provided
for by. the Supervisors, showing where
$45,919 04 above the Examiner's alleged
deficit was expended.
The Trocadero Gulch account was ap
propriated in 1900 and set aside by the
Treasurer. From this account $9996 49 was
audited during the last fiscal year.
TREASTTBEB, HOLDS DEMANDS.
Then there is the police relief and pen
sion fund. The Board of Supervisors does
not provide any appropriation for this
fund, but the charter provides that it be
made up from police fines, contributions
from the officers and a certain percentage
of all money derived from, the liquor li
censes Issued by the Police Commission
ers. From this fund $58,068 13 was audited
and paid out.
Loans from what Is known as the Rob
inson bequest fund, for which the sum of
$30,000 was set aside by Robinson for the
keeping up of the Robinson name, ac
counted for the sum of $2375 90. This
amount was drawn out on the demand of
the Mayor and distributed by him to the
charities of the city. The Wlndel bequest
fund, a similar fund, gave to the city
charities the sum of $1561 20. This money
was also drawn out by the Mayor. Every
year the revenues derived from loans
from these two funds are drawn out and
distributed to charity by the Mayor.
A fund known as the special permit
fund and placed on deposit by the con
tractors of the city to Insure their leaving
the streets In perfect condition after the
performing of any work about them,
yielded the sum of $45,025.
Taxes collected erroneously were re
funded to the amount of $4321 21 and from
the surplus fund the sum of $17,713 33 was
paid on all outstanding obligations. From
the fund known as the Teachers' Insti
tute fund, deposited by the school teach
ers of the city In the treasury, was paid
out $246 55 for a purchase for which no
provision was made for.
From the house-moving fund set aside
by the department of electricity the sum
of $674 50 was audited. This money is
provided for from deposits by the house
movers Jn the city treasury to Insure
their leaving the city wires In good con
dition. From a similar fund deposited
to the Board of Public Works the turn
of $3045 was audited. Money refunded for
the overpayment of personal property
taxes, due to the change of tax rates,
amounted to $1134 10.
To begin with, there Is the advertising
fee Item, for which the Board of Super
visors makes no appropriation. On the de
mands of that body the sum of 15839 14
was paid out of the treasury for advertis
ing purposes.' Court orders from the Su
perior Judges, for which no provision Is
made, were Issued to the sum of $2 10. For
the fiscal years of 1901-02 the outstanding
contracts for the construction of streets,
sewers and echoolhouses certified to by
the Auditor and set aside by the Treas
urer, and, of course, not provided for by
the Supervisors, drew on demand from
the treasury $242,802 09.
Auditor Baehr's supporters claim that
the account printed about his auditing
$245,751 57 more than was appropriated by
the Board of Supervisors Is a canard pro
mulgated by the Democratic bosses.
William Brod trick knows well that the
story printed yesterday in reference to
Auditor Baehr's alleged misappropriation
of the city's funds to an amount running
up Into the thousands is filsc. He knows
also that every dollar audited by Mr.
Baehr during the last fiscal year was hon
estly accounted for, and that the Treas
urer holds the Auditor's every demand
for money drawn from the city treasury.
These demands the Treasurer holds, and
they are open for any investigation that
any one wishes to make.
Auditor Baehx does not ask the public
to believe him, but merely to refer to the
report for the last fiscal year.
Just to show what causes the "glaring
discrepancies" referred to, the following
figures were taken from the official report
of the Auditor's office for the year ending
June 30. 1903.
All of the expenditures were within the
appropriations made by the Board of Su
pervisors. There were twenty-one Items
on which money was drawn from the
treasury for which the Supervisors made
no provision. For these Items the sum of
$391,670 &i was audited by the Auditor on
demands from the proper officials. This
amount la far in excess of the alleged de
ticit and more than accounts for the fake
misappropriation which the Examiner has
been howling about.
FEES NOT PROVIDED FOB. _
In reply to the question propounded In
yesterday's Examiner, "Where fcaa that
money gone, Auditor Baehr?" Mr. Baehr
â¢hows conclusively by his report for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1903. where the
money has gone, and the figures he pro
duces will bear the most rigid investiga
tion.
The charge Is that Moody withheld from
Mrs. Conroy thÂ«e letter from the depart
ment. His counsel says, however, that he
did not do so, but acted In the transac
tion solely at her own request and with
out any interest whatever in the mat
ter.
.â¢ The letter In question was addressed to
Mrs. Margaret L. Conroy and was from
the Comptroller of the Currency, contaln

. According to the indictment the letter
vas passed out by Postmaster Patterson
r.f The Dalles postofSce on the promise of
Moody* that he would readdress it and
send It to the person to whom it was di
rected.
"When seen Moody said:
'"It is an outrage. I am shocked and
mortified beyond expression that such a
charge against me cou'd possibly be made
by a. Grand Jury. It is false and malici
ous, which I will fully show without de
lay. The charge is trumped-up for politi
cal purposes."

J If you are about to start in search of new Carpets
for your house or flat we ask you to peruse the follow-
ing brief price list with but this one thought in your
mind â "these are Carpets of quality, and they are
guaranteed to be genuine dyed-in-the-yarn goods."
It is unnecessary for you to tell us that these are
not the lowest prices being quoted on Carpets to-
day in San Francisco. We know it. We admit it.
Furthermore, we are proud of it.
But, quality considered and cost of manufac-

but it does not keep them tramps. The
man and the Job cannot always keep
apart unless the man so wishes. Tha
proof is the fact that thousands of men
have been tramps and are so no longer.
And these men did not owe their escape
from tramphood to anything that any
body did for them. They owed It entirely
to themselves. Taking hla life through,
the average tramp Is such because he
wishes to beâ because he falls into the
delusion that It Is easier to beg and steal
than to work. One " of . those economic

him to tramping. But when this lull was
over he did not remain a tramp unless
he- wished to.

Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes of Boston
told the other day an anecdote of his
father, the noted poet and physician.
Judge Holmes said that a prolific young
novelist, whose works are now very popu
lar, once consulted his father regarding
his health.
"Perhaps," the young man said, after
narrating his symptomsâ "perhaps I write
too much for ray constitution." "
"Not for your constitution," Dr. Holmes
corrested him. "For your reputation."â

A young Delaware farmer pleaded guilty the other day

why even a Korean' Prince should be punished for the

A lady visitor at a fashionable resort
on the Main* coast this summer went to
the UnlversaMst church in the place the
first Sunday morning of her stay and
was politely shown to a seat. There was
no hymn book, however, but the occu
pant of the pew behind her reachel over
and placed one in her hands. At the
close of the eervico the visitor turned
around and thanked the person, saying,
as she was to attend that church all
summer; she should like to buy a hymn
book. "Well." eaid the other woman, "I
guees you can have that book if vou'H

"Canon Barnett. preaching at St. Paul's

In which many human relations had come
to be expressed In war terms," says a
London paper. "There was strife between
labor and capitalâ a big fight for the
schools â a tariff warâ a struggle for su
premacy. It was the noise of our own In
ternal battles which drowned the cries
from the Balkans. He urged that the
fighting spirit was impossible to any one
who accepted the gospel teaching that
power is on the side of love and gentle
ness. It was not for a preacher of Chris
tianity to take sides In any conflict, but
he was bound to condemn everywhere ag
gressivenessâthe spirit of arrogance and
intolerance, the suspicion of others' mo
tives, the greed of others' gain and the
desire for master)'. He concluded a pow
erful discourse by asking the great con
gregation before him how any one of
them could dare to call Christ his Lord
and master and then act aggressively,
adopt the fighting spirit, refuse his way
as Impracticable, his policy of giving
gcod for evil as & policy fit for slaves and
his hope of peace on earth as stuff for
dreamers."

Russian newspapers are authority for the assertion that
the Czar will probably attempt to secure from China a modi
fication of the treaty with the United States which insures
to us an open door to Manchurian trade. Russian news
papers should give the Czar the credit of knowing enough
of international politics to understand thoroughly that there
is a vast difference between Japan and the United States and
that we have cultivated a habit of defending our own.
The report of Bristow, the Fourth Assistant Postmaster

"Representative investors of the best class have sent
their agents to buy promising mines, and they arc meeting
with great success. Out of all the numerous properties that
have changed ownership of late there is not one that is
not proving a wise and profitable investment."
If the outsiders can be convinced of the entire accuracy
of these representations, after investigating, the induce
ment to buy Nevada County, quartz ledges will be strong.
The gold output of Nevada County in 1002 was $2,142,740.
Calaveras was the: second county inr gold production in
California, making a record of $2,070,000. "
THE Nevada City Transcript announces that "the in
creased activity in mining circles and the constant
influx of capable and representative mining men to
Nevada County, with their capital, betoken the fact and give
assurance that this section is shortly to experience a min
ing boom of great magnitude â perhaps greater than we
have yet experienced."
Particularizing somewhat the Transcript asserts that,
by reason of the demand for quartz properties, an un
usually large number of claims are under development in the
county on which assessment work only has been performed
previpusly. "Representatives of large capital have been exam
ining and inspecting two of the leading quartz mines in this
locality, and negotiations have been entered intQ for buy
ing them. Several other properties that have not been
worked for years have been examined within the past week
and trial tests of ore have been so satisfactory that there is
a strong probability that they will also soon pass into the
hands of new owners."
It is also asserted by the Transcript that "never in the
histoty of this district has there been such a growing de
mand for mining properties. While local owners of mines
demand, and always obtain, a fair price from outside capi
talists, they have discarded the erroneous policy of some
years ago, when they would double and treble the selling
price whenever prospective buyers approached. Many
moneyed men who are now investing their capital in this
favored mining, section are causing almost unprecedented
activity and are giving a stimulus to the mining industry
of Nevada County, which is increasing daily and has every
indication of developing into a veritable mining boom be
fore the advent of another summer."
'There is room in California for all the gold mines that
can be discovered. No one mine competes with another in
the market. Each furnishes the treasure for the financial
operations of the world, and there is. always a demand for
more. The Transcript vaunts the fact that Nevada County
has for some years enjoyed the reputation of being "the
banner gold-producing county of California," and boasts
that "it is not going to lose its laurels very soon." .
There are always investors to engage in working gold
mines where it can be shown- that profits, will follow.
Every mining investment is naturally a distinct proposition.
Each property is separately scanned. Definite statements
are made by the Transcript concerning the success that
has attended the recent investment in Nevada County
mines. " ,

A nurse in an Eastern city, desperately determined upon

The Fish Commission is frequently in
receipt of ridiculous communications from
people of the interior who have rather
a vague Idea of the functions of the bu
reau. A retired merchant from one of
the hill towns, desiring to devote some of
his spare time to the study of zoology,
sent the following letter of inquiry to
Chief Deputy Charles A. Vogelsang:
"I am interested in natural history and
want to get hold of a dear for scientific
purposes. Do you know where I can buy
one? If so, get a good one for me and
express it in a box C. O. D.. together
with a permit for keeping same. One of
the common varieties will do. I will pay
all expenses." , .,
After pondering over the communication
for some time Vogelsang dispatched the
following reply:
"Dears of all kinds are abundant In this
neck of the woods, and If you are not
particular as to color or breed I can eas
ily comply with your request. Most of
them would object, however, to being sent
in a box by express.- If you will agree to
assume the cost of perpetual maintenance
I will promise to send you a dear who
will be useful, both for scientific study
and for housekeeping. I am not author
ized by the laws of the State to issue such
permits as you require, but you may get
one from the County Clerk. I would re
spectfully request that my old friend,

Ixmg fLgc>, in the dim ages, before
houses, before writing, before language,
when men lived in caves and saw all
things in one color, seme primeval human
being found that a great stone, too heavy
to be moved by cheer strength, could be
raised by another method. So he wedged
a long stick between the rock and the
ground, placed another stone under the
stick and then by prepslni? down upon the
other end of the stick easily moved the
ptone, otherwise too heavy to be lifted.
This far-off human or subter-human be
ing, more Ingenious than his fellows, was
utilizing a device now known to engineers
as a lever of the first class. Yet in the
very act of bearing down upon the stick,
the improvised crowbarâ In the act of
standing with slightly bent kneesâ our
primitive engineer was In his own body
calling Into requisition a number of levers
of exact'}' the same kind, all made in the
most perfect manner.
TberÂ« are a number of pulleys in the
bodyâ muscles which pass through a pul
ley of bone to move certain structures.
The most familiar and the most beautiful
of the*e is the muscle known as the su
"perior oblique muscle of the eye. This
nrusel** is attached to the bony structures
behind the eyeball and extends forward
and upward till it reaches its "pulley,"
then, turning sharply to one tide, it is
buried in th# eyeball. Its action is to ro
tate the eyeball on antra-posterior axis.
Ttie dlgastricus, a muscle in the fore part
of the neck, is also an excellent example
of a "pulley."

of them. The Joint* of the fingers, toes,
knees and elbows are perfect hinges. At
the shoulder and hip are found beautiful
Famples of the "ball and socket," or. as
mechanics call it. the "universal" Joint.
Inclined planes are found in many places,
notably at the wriFt and ankle. Joints. In
the veins, which carry back to the hea-t
blood returning from the tissues, are most
beautiful little trapdoors, which also act
as valves, opening to allow the blopd
stream to move toward the heart, but
closing promptly to prevent "back flow."
Tbe heart Itself Is a marvelous pump for
rather two pumps, for in reality there are
two distinct hearts, whldh, though Joined

a* one of the most perfect merchanlsms
in the world, propelling every minute

finrt to the lungs and then to the tissue!".
Viewed from any standpoint, the human
heart is one of the most wonderful things
known to man. -

THE Los Angeles Express estimates the new citrus
crop of Southern California, barring the frost or
other contingencies, to exceed any heretofore, grown
and shipped from that section of the State by nearly
io,ooo cars. "The crop," it says, "may amount to 37>ooo
cars, and will exceed 35,000 cars.'^ Accepting this estimate
upon such authority, the picturesque suggestion is afforded
that if all the citrus fruits of the southern tier of counties
were to be shipped on one train the imposing array of roll
ing stock necessary to carry it overland would be on the
basis of the lowest figure mentioned more than 300 miles
long.
"Estimated in money," says the Express, '"the addition
will mean to the growers, shippers and the railroad com
panies close to $5,000,000 mqre money than has ever be
fore been circulated in local territory from citrus fruit
production."
The new season will soon begin. Early in November
the earlier fruit will be ready to be moved. The orange
growers are inquiring whether the transportation lines
have the requisite facilities for taking the crop promptly to
market. The Express says that the question cannot, be
answered at this time.
At the Santa Fe headquarters in Los Angeles it is in
sisted that the situation is understood, that due prepara
tion has been made and that the crop movement will be
uninterrupted. "At Southern Pacific headquarters those in
authority are putting on a bold front, but they admit that
it will be an effort to move the fruit." It is estimated that
from the beginning to the end of the season 15,000 cars will
be required. They will be kept in active use.
This announcement cannot fail to prove of great advertis
ing advantage to the resources and climate of Southern Cal
ifornia. The upper end of the State has the same climate.
Oranges are grown successfully hundreds of miles north of
San Francisco. Citrus culture has not been practiced as
extensively in this part of the State as in the south, but the
industry is constantly growing and already has large pro
portions. Very likely in a few years the central and north
ern counties will make as great a seasonal aggregate of
shipments of citrus fruits as the Express now forecasts for
the south in the season at hand. The capacity of widely
separated sections north of Tehachapi to produce fine and
early citrus fruit was demonstrated by the Thanksgiving
citrus fair that was held in this city.
The southerners are not going to rely wholly upon im
posing citrus crop figures to attract the attention of the
world. They have planned to have an acre of growing
orange trees displayed in the grounds surrounding the Cali
fornia State building at the St. Louis Exposition. The
trees will be taken on in tubs, some in flower and some
in bearing, and placed at St. Louis without disturbing the
roots, the tubs containing them being buried. This will
give the idea of a Southern California orange grove in ac
tual bearing and under the customary conditions. As
oranges on trees from California ripened at Chicago, there
is no reason to doubt that citrus fruits, care being taken to
wait for the planting of the tubs until the stormy spring
weather has passed in St. Louis, will mature fully before
the eyes of the cosmopolitan gathering that, will to the
number of millions swarm about the St. Louis Exposition.
The people of the south, as will be seen from these
statements, have no more intention now than they ever had
to hide their resources. They are not putting their light
under a bushel. "
These two whids were politically ingenious. If the bills
were left to raise the presumption that Mr. Oelrichs looked
with favor upon the Mayor, it would help to ingratiate him
into the confidence of the capitalists and business men of
the city. Being ordered down, the excuse was furnished
Tor an appeal to the labor and non-capitalist vote to resent
the insolence of the rich. Mayor Schmitz so well under
stood the political value of the conclusion of the incident
that he referred to it in his speeches, and drew out a let
ter from Mr. Oelrichs to the effect that he knew nothing
about it and cared less. f
Then Mr. Lane's Juminous evening organ entered the
field of prevarication and has held the center of the stage.
It selected a prominent Republican business man and in
vented for him a tumultuous rush into Lane headquarters
to declare his opposition to Mr. Crocker and his intention
to toil tooth and claw for Lane. Though the same gentle
man has been prominent in the ranks of Crocker workers
and has made speeches for him nearly every night, the
sunset organ has not recalled nor corrected its whid, but
has gone on inventing others with a fecundity of falsehood
that would rouse the envy of Ananias. Mr. Lane, who is
a gentleman in his personal way and manner, really ought
to call down his organ or make it blow a little truth on its
bully tin horn.
Then the Examiner, the Beelzebub, the father of liars,
the leviathan of falsehood, the old, original and only Goliath
of slander, has outdone the rest, as was its duty to do. It
has with the scent and eyes of a ferret gone in and out of
every political rat hole in the city, has turned over every
chip, clawed the depths of every garbage pile and come
forth reeking. The contractor for advertising space in the
street cars puts up the card of a Republican candidate, in
the regular course of business, and at once the Examiner
bristles with the incident as proof that the United Railroads
corporation has bought that candidate for the privilege of
using its cars to display his card.
Two men are seen to exchange greetings on the street,
and immediately Lane's organ invents a conversation be
tween them which never took place, and in which only sod
den idiots would engage in public and in hearing of ad
verse parties. That the conversation is immediately de
nied makes no difference. In fact, the two organs vie with
one another in the invention of whids. The lying inventor
of interviews with the Pope, the Queen Regent of Spain
and Mrs. McKinley is not disquieted by exposure. The
enly shame it feels is for' the moderation of its invention.
In its view disgrace does not consist, in being exposed, but
in failing to tell a lie more- deserving of exposure.
From now until the election it may be expected that
Mr. Lane's evening organ will play Sapphira to his morn
ing organ's Ananias. There must be some people, whose
votes may be influenced by lying or these newspapers would
not invest so much ink and ingenuity. in that work. But
there are far more people who are repelled from a cause
that requires such tactics and Uses them, and these will
only gird them with a stouter purpose to rebuke lying and
unfairness by going to the support of Mr. Crocker, who is
the object of this whid campaign.
PERHAPS it may seem too harsh to call the misrep
resentations that are published for political effect
lies. The Scotch have a soft euphemism for that
sort of thing and call it a "whid." The anti-Republican
corners of the present triangular fight in this city have been
the source of many whids.
Early in the banner and streamer campaign of Mayor
Schmitz his brush and paste brigade plastered the Fair
mont Hotel structure with bills, which assured the reader
in large letters that the Mayor is "tried and true." As this
disfiguring of the structure could be only by the assent of
the owner or contractor, immediately the word was glee
fully passed that th.Â» owner. Kir. Hermann Oelrichs, was
supporting Schmitz, and this rumor heartened the Mayor's
forces for many days. Then the "tried and true" posters
were effaced, arid this begot another whid to the effect
that capital had reared its reptilian head and struck at the
Mayor through his posters.
THE LIES OF THE CAMPAIGN.
I think there will in time be a reaction
from this sort of empty, idle, vain exist
ence. People will tire of it. will see how
little it amounts to and will return to the
"home idea."
Still another- cause of uncongeniallty
among the rich is the absence of family
life. In ordinary homes the husband, wife
and children meet daily at table and else
where and the sweet old-fashioned home
relations maintain. If an outing or good
time of any sort is afoot all the family
participate in it and it becomes a general
merry-making. A Borrow to any member
of the family becomes In like manner a
general grief. Such experiences go to
ward the closer knitting of family ties.
In many rich families, however, the
children are put out of sight. In a nur
sery with a governess or at some fash
ionable boarding-school, and are thus de
prived of any knowledge of what home
life In its truest sense really Is. A multi
tude of social engagements, too, rob the
husband and wife of much of each oth
er's society. How can home exist in such
circumstances? The wife is absorbed In
the duties that throng the path of a wo
man of fashion. The husband's time and
thought are taken up by his business or
his club. Absorbed in diametrically dif
ferent interests, they naturally drift
apart. In the summer the wife goes lo
Newport or to Europe, Her husband
stays at home watching the stock market
and taking advantage of such recreation
as comes his way.
There are, of course, countless excep
tions to this rule. There are many happy
marriages among the rich, many luxuri
ous homes where as true affection reigns
as In less pplendid dwellings.
I have an old-fashioned belief that a
husband and wife shouM be real help
meets; that a husband's business cares
and perplexities should be understood and
shared by his wife: that his business
losses should be her losses and his tri
umphs her triumphs.
Often among the rich this Is not the
cas*. The wife, brought up to wealth and
luxury, gives little heed to the source of
that luxury, nor In what way the riches
that surround her are gained.
She knows little and cares less about
her husband's business affairs. She has
no real sympathy with him in his hard
ships and trials, and in consequence he is
sometimes apt to go elsewhere for appre
ciation and advice. ShouM his fortune be
swept away his wife, who knows nothing
of his frantic efforts to keep that fortune
together for hÂ«Â»r sake, blames him for
carHess management. If her own money
is also involved in the crash ehe has etill
less sympathy for the man to whom she
attributes the misfortune. All she realizes
is that the one attraction which made him
bearable has been removed. And she
looks elsewhere for the happiness she has
lost.
Another cause Is the manner of life led
by bo many of the very rich. They have
little of real interest to occupy their at
tention. Their lives become idle and va
pid. There Is too much leisure. Where a
poorer woman would be too busily occu
pied with her home and famlliy the wom
an whose home cares are reduced to a
minimum by money has time to become
bored hy her husband or to yearn for
other interests.
Such people are, after all. but human,
and a woman who is forced by her fam
ily's ambition to marry a man for whom
she has no natural inclination or affec
tion is not unlikely later to meet a man
with whom she falls seriously in love.
This is a condition which might perhaps
have been wholly avoided had she- been
bcrn in a less exalted financial sphere and
allowed to choose a husband for herself.
Family fortunes are thus maintained or
raised, sometimes at a cost far greater
than mere money involves.
Foremost, however, among the reasons
for especial matrimonial unhappiness
among the rich (if such unhappinejss real
ly exists to a greater degree than
among the poor) is the "marriage of con
venience." Among people composing the
wealthy set in our large cities marriages
Â«re oftener matters of policy and desir
ability than the mere outcome of mutual
affection. There Is. in many cases of this
sort, no real love from the very outset.
Â¦Women marry men of great wealth and
social position because their families are
ambitious and desire to see them well
placed in the world.
It is but natural under such circum
ctaneeg that more or less jar and lack of
congeniality should ensue. Nothing but
an unusual degree of tact can avert such
friction.
Â¦' Â¦ â¢ ' Â¦ *
at large takes In the wealthy, st'r up the
dissension, exaggerate it, perhaps, and
flash it in its every phase before the pub
lic. In short, two people's marital differ
ences, which should be sacred to them
alone, become at once public property,
whereas in the case? of the poorer, less
prominent perpons. their private quarrels
KO unnoted. If a millionaire says a sharp
word to his wife in public, columns may
be printed on the subject. If John Smith,
a 112 a week clerk, throws his wife down
stairs the chance? are against his note
worthy act receiving a line of printed
comment.

Mgr. Merry del Val has on several occa

I have been informed that my name has been used in connection with th; fight now being made by Eugene
E. Scr^itz for the Mayoralty, and it is due to the many thousands of citizens who constitute the organization of
wfcice I have the honor to be head, in order that no misconstruction may be placed upon their attitude, and who are
eminently able and qualified to think and speak for themselves, and to myself, that thsre be left no doubt as -to my
â¢position. '.
The Building Trades Council, of which I speak, is composed of many thousands of conservative citizens who be
licve with me in the rights of life, liberty and property, and if anybody has. struggled more faithfully to maintain them
inviolate ar.d to preserve the standing and integrity of that organization free from encroachment and danger than I
have, I do not know who he is.
The Building Trades Council has always been found upon the side of right and has been second to none in the
advancement of measles intended to improve our municipal institutions. Having accomplished these results, it now
believes, and for all time will possess the conviction, that without the enforcement of the provisions of the charter
These conditions, together with the expressed thought of many of my fellow craftsmen, are sufficient to convince
me that there is but one course to pursue.
Our citizens have adopted a charter, calculated to insure a government free from stain and scandal ; but while
such a law prescribes the manner in which departments shall be conducted, personal action, which cannot be controlled,
has been responsible for great wrongs.
I believe that any man charged with the performance of a public duty must perform it with an eye single to the
public interest. If that authority is perverted, that man is guilty of corruption, and all who aid and assist him are his
accomplices in crime.
Those of us who are engaged in the building business are largely responsible for the adoption of our charter.
I^ana partly responsible for the conduct of one of the most important branches of our municipal government, and,' re
alizing this responsibility, I shall do all in my power to accomplish the restoration of decency and honesty in the ad
mmistraticn of public affairs.
During the past two years each and every branch of the municipal government which
has presented an opportunity for political manipulation has been tampered with.
Capable and honest officials have been made the subject of unjust criticism to
aCCOmolish enrnt nf onrfv
Faithful officials have been replaced with practical politicians in violation of the
We are about to enter upon a new era of improvement. Millions of dollars will be devoted to the building of a
greater San Francisco. To see that this money is honestly, wisely and judiciously expended "will be the duty of the of
ficers now to be elected. Shall it be committed to the care of those who are now carrying on municipal business as a
private enterprise? History tells us that it has been the experience of the world over that all the corruption and rnis
government with which this earth is cursed grows out of this fatal proclivity of public servants to make a business of
their duty.
Let us~*not fall into this regrettable condition, but let us bestow upon men above and beyond reproach the ad
ministration of our public matters. Let us commit these all-irnportant concerns to the care of those whom we know
to be honest and who have no private interests to propagate.
Careful and extended inquiry and investigation has shown Henry J. Crocker to be
such a man. Careful and deliberate investigation convinces me that Henry J. Crocker
is a representative Republican in politics, against whose life and action, public and
private, nothing can be said. He possesses the confidence of his party and of thousands
of his fellow citizens outside of that party. He stands to>day infinitely stronger than any
candidate in the field.
These are conditions which guide me, as well as thousands of my coworkcrs, and are the conditions which
should guide every citizen in this community who takes a pride in his city and desires to see it properly governed.
These are conditions which should appeal to every laboring, professional and business man who desires to see
the proper conduct of public affairs and the vast improvements now under contemplation properly carried out.
It is for us to determine whether the name of San Francisco shall bespeak honesty and purity of government, or
shall be held out to the world as the synonym of unparalleled political corruption. [ P. H. McCARTHY.
The dastardly attempt to defeat and demolish that bulwark of good government, the civil service, is still fresh
in the minds of. the citizens, and the discovery of the criminal acts of Mershon stands boldly out as one of the results
of the present adminstraticn.

1:58%. The trial to-day was made with
-the customary two runners to set the

driven by Doc Tanner, and the finish was
made in a drive with two runners along
side the trotter, all three horses flashing
under the wire noses apart. The start
was effected at the first attempt. The
quarter was reached in :29%, the half in
:59U. the three-quarters In 1:29% and the

trailing behind, and just before the wire
was reached the runner drew alojjgs'flo
and under the wire the three horses went
for the trial against time. At the quarter
the time was caught in :S2Vi, the half in

and a half, neither one striking a blow.
Two other youngsters were substituted
and they were worse, so that bout was
stopped in the first.
George Burk outpointed Walter Need
ham. James Leary got the decision over
George Cole, and Nobby Otts .won on
points from James Keegan.
The fight, though fast, was hardly what
was exoected. Carroll commenced to use
a straight left at thÂ« outset. He would
Jab Powell In the Jaw and then clinch.
He also held on at every* opportunity and
this handicapped . Powell . throughout.
Powell made his best, showing in the last
round, when he began to rush. It was
then too late and the Judges decided In
favor of Carroll.
The much talked of boxing bout be
tween Joe Carroll and Lev Powell, two
vhining lights in the amateur ranks, was
decided last night under tne auspices of
the Bay City Club. The former Jabbed
himself to victory with his straight left.
Powell was overweight, but rather than
disappoint the spectators Carroll consent
ed to z6 on.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
There was another reversal of form
yesterday ' afternoon at Recreation ball
park. The Cripples played the game like
an aggregation of pennant winners, while
the Senators were awful and would have
succumbed before a team of sand lotters.
Score, 9 to 0.
The first Inning practically broke up the
game. It was then the Cripples began
to hit. the ball and the Senators began
to boot It around the lot. The flgohy
lasted till six of the tribe of Peter had
made the circuit of the bags. This seem
ed to take the life out of the lawmaking
tossers. and It also tended to fill the Crip
ples with the real enthusiasm. (
It could plainly be seen that young Mc-
Kay woujd bring home the money as
soon as he entered the box. That pecu
liar swinjj: of his was even more pro
nounced than usual, and besides he had
a lot of speed, good control and change
of pace that waa bewildering. Conse
quently the Senators swung their heads
off for nine rounds and still not one of
them could hit hard enough to brlug a
run over the pan.

It was almost twilight when Stott got
in his fine work, and the moon was scat
tering shadows when the whistle an
nounced the end. California scored 40 on
the Chemawa team last Saturday. .Stan
ford . plays Reliance on Saturday. The
line-up yesterday was as follows:

Chalmers-M. Hyde R. H. B Bensel
Dole-Tarpey. L. H. B Davis
Scholfleld Fullback Decker
Lanagan had almost an entirely new
eleven representing the cardinal before
the second half had hardly begun. The
redskins never held the ball for two min
utes at a time and were constantly on the
defensive. Stanford had no difficulty in
advinclng the pigskin from five to ten
yards at a clip. Four touchdowns were
made In twenty minutes of play, but Ste
venson missed three of the goals.
Stanford carried the ball down the field
after the kick-off with but few Interrup
tions. The ball was within two feet of
the Indians' goal post when the half
ended.
Lanagan has succeeded in getting more
gfnger into his pupils, and they were
quicker in taking position after the .ball
was down yesterday than at any time
heretofore this season. The line is Â»tlll
rather loose, but the men play lower,
which Is an improvement over the 8ea
son's past games. The coach is bringing
back his heavy men for the Une-bucklng,
and that will prove a help. Altogether
Stanford is improving rapidly. The root
ers are feeling much better over the pres
ent situation, and It seems rather harder
to pick a winner In the championship con
test than previously.
Overall and several other huskies from
California watched the game yesterday
with interest. â¢ The Indians had a weak
line and tackled about the neck. It was
only by good luck they escaped being
beaten by a larger score.
Chemawa. kicked thirty-five yards to
Chalmers on the start, and the cardinal
back carried the ball nearly to the center
before he was laid low. Stanford was
penalized for .offside play Immediately
thereafter, but when the cardinal eleven
got the ball again they carried It down
the field in four and five yard gains. After
three minutes of play Chalmers was sent
around the redskins' right end for twenty
yards and a touchdown on a trick play.
Sprott kicked the goal.
After the kick-off both teams fumbled
two or three times apiece and exchanged
punts. Stanford finally got the ball near
the middle of the field and commenced
advancing it by line plunges. Dole, Hyde
and Thompson all made steady gains,
ably assisted by the rest of the eleven In
good team work. Scholfield carried the
ball twenty-two yards through Chema
wa's right tackle for a touchdown. Sprott
kicked the goal.
The cardinal football eleven rolled up a
Bcore of 33 points against the Chemawa
Indians in forty minutes of play yester
day afternoon on the Stanford gridiron.
The redskins never made their distance.
Fortunately they had an excellent punter
in Saunders, and were thus enabled to
send the pigskin down the field when it
came into their possession.
Coacji Lanagan played twenty-one men
during the game. Stott, the cardinal's
substitute quarter, made two sensational
runs in successive plays just before the
end of the last half. The first wa$ for
thirty yards and the second for thirty
flve. The spectators on the bleachers
arose in a body and gave the agile little
chap the cheering he deserved. Chalmers
at right half, Thompson at left guard and
Clark at left end also did fine work for
the home team.

A six furlong sprint followed, for which
Legal Maxim rater a 6 to 5 choice.
Powell did his best on the short-priced
one. but could not overhaul one of the
despistd outsiders, Ingo, a 5 to 1 shot,
which led out the favorite half a length.
King Dellls took the show. Powell, on
Step Around, led from the Jump in
the sixth race, just heading out El Piloto
at the wire. Little Margaret, the fa
vorite, ran unplaced. Laureted finished
third and with better handling could have
won. F. E. MULHOLLAND.
Ira, driven by Walter Maben, annexed
the 2:20 pace in straight heats, selling a
10 to 4 choice over the field. In the 2:14
trot there were rumblings, with occa
sional external disturbances. Hollo
brought 10 and the field 7. Limonero cap
tured the first heat from the favorite in
2:18. Then Forest W grabbed two heats,
Limonero being distanced in the third.
Under the rules all went to the barn now
but Forest TV. Hollo, it was claimed, had
been eased up in his work since last he
appeared In public or â¬lse a set of new
shoes pinched. There was a howl at any
rate from his backers, so the judges de
clared all bets off on the race. McDon
ald, the driver of Forest W, was .fimd
$50 for laying up the first heat.
Out of the original twenty-nine nomina
tions for the Long Beach handicap, at
six furlongs, only three went to the bar
rier. The race resulted in a farcical vic
tory' for Princess Titania. The winner
was coupled with E. M. Brattaln and the
books held the stable at 1 to 4. Blissful
measured strides with Brattaln to the
stretch turn, where Chandler, on the
Princess, took command and she actually
rolled in. Blissful finished second. From
the looks of tbe betting the stable folks
apparently did not fancy the chances of
Doilie Weithoff, favorite for the first run
ning event, for her odds went from evens
to 6 to 5. She ran unplaced. Adonis, with
Jackson up and played from 2 to 3 to 2,
led from start to finish, boating Sir Chris
topher less than a length at the end.
Phyz, always a contender, ran a good
third.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2S.â After several
rehearsals and half a dozen postpone
ments the hurdle race extravaganza was
finally produced at the matinee perform
ance this> afternoon at Agricultural Park.
It was put on with special scenic set
tings and attracted a fair-sized attend
ance. Held over one and one-eighth
mlk-s. there were only 'four starters, and
on Chicago form George Cochrane's
Jumper, Indian II. opened a 1 to 2 favor
ite. After a postgraduate course the
smart ones unloaded on Limber Jim,
knocking down his price from even money
to 2 to 5. while the odds about Indian II
went to evens. Unfortunately, Limber
Jim and Martin Brady came to grief at
the first obstacle, their respective riders,
Richards and Gilpin, luckily escaping in
jury- Then The Devil, the rank 7 to I
outsider of the quartet, went on and de
feated Indian II without great effort. The
result was practically an eagle bird for
the bookies.
Two harness events were decided, with
one favorite earning laurels. Five runs
were then pulled off, but one favorite
plugging a bullseye.

MALARIA A
Germ Infected Air. l^\
Malaria is not confined exclusively to the swamps W^x^\
and marshy regions of the country, but wherever there is f^-^r^A
bad air this insidious foe to Health is found. Poisonous fc^/sl^A
vapors and gases from sewers, and the mttsty air of damp l$iÂ»5oÂ£l
cellars are laden with the germs of this miserable disease, . i||EXsSf
which are breathed into the lungs and taken up by the &Â¦*$Â¦Â¦$
blood and transmitted to every part of the body. Then JF&w^-J
you begin to feel out of sorts without ever suspecting the vlj?'w
cause. No energy or appetite, dull headaches, sleepy and V^vj-tv
tired and completely fagged out from the slightest exer- t-^r-A
tion, are some of the deplorable effects of this enfeebling w ; r3ift
. malady. As the disease progresses and the blood becomes vwf|i \\
more deeply poisoned, boils and abscesses and dark or â -%
yellow spots appear upon the skin. When the poison is -^Â«Â£Â«Â§Â£2i3Â£^
left to ferment and the microbes and germs to multiply in ~^sâ S^\^â^
the blood, Liver and Kidney troubles and other serious complications often
arise. As Malaria begins and develops in the blood, the treatment to be
S, --, effective must begin there too. S. S. S. destroys
(^4 |O^ the^ erms an( * poisons and purifies the polluted
VJ^w V^^ blood, and under its tonic effect the debilitated
S3/ constitution rapidly recuperates end the system i3

Lane was accorded a rousing welcome.
His speech was mainly devoted to uphold

candidates of -. the * party he represented
and to showing up Abe Ruefs methods In
the present campaign.
He said in part:
Our platform stand* for sincerity and hon
esty and truth ' and I am proud " to be at tho

The police are investigating the assault.
Pleases Thirty-Ninth District, but
Fails to Appear at Butchers' Hall.
SCHMITZ SPEAKS W K I iTV .
Mayor Schmitz was kept busy last even
ing in attempting to attend the numerous
meetings at which he was scheduled to
appear. In the downtown district Mayor
Schmitz spoke to the retail grocers, after
which he rushed out to Park View Hall
to address the voters of the Thirty-ninth
District. He was enthusiastically re
ceived and made a good address. In part
he said:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It U
indeed gratifying to me to see the Intense en
thusiasm displayed here this evening. 1 find
the same feeling prevails In the different dis
tricts I visit, and I now feel assured that on
November 3 there will come a heavy landslide,
and the Cnlon Labor ticket will be elected from
top to bc-.tcra by an overwhelming majority.
We shall be able to say that we fought our
fight alone and unaided, as we have bad no
paper to stand by us during the campaign. I
wish to impress upen your minds not only the
Importance of my election, but also the entire
ticket. .
Be careful how you put your marks opposite
the name* for Supervisors, as that part of the
ticket Is of vital Importance to a successful ad
mlnistratlcn.
From Park View Hall the Mayor drove
to Richmond Hail, where he addressed a
large assembly. *At Butchers' Hall, on
Folsom street, the voters of the Thirtieth
District were assembled In strong force.
The Mayor had promised them a visit last
evening, and the hall was packed to its
utmost. Schmitz was scheduled to arrive
at the hall at about 11 o'clock, but when
the time came and Schmitz was still ab
sent and all the available candidates had
taken the stand' and finished the crowd
began to file out j
A. M- Armstrong, a strong Schmitz ad
vocate, took the stand and commenced a
hot attack on Lane and Crocker. At 11:30
o'clock the chairman announced that
Schmitz's buggy had broken down and
that he was riding over to the meeting
In a street car. Still Armstrong held the
floor. Â¦ By that time - Lane and Crocker
were thieves and crocks. - At 13 o'clock the
chairman, announced that Mr. Schmitz
was due in eight minutes. Jnst at that
moment Lane was making $10,000 a year
out of the office of City Attorney. At 12:10
o'clock Mr. Armstrong admitted that he
had been talking against time and that
there was no possibility of the Mayor's
arrival, as the accident must have . been
more serious than was at first supposed.
When a' man was sent out to ascertain
whether Mr. Echmitx was, on his way to
the meeting he found that his Honor was
quietly slumbering after a cold bath.
There was no accident--

would be spent In the districts for
which it wa* voted and for the purposes
for which It was Intended. On his per
sonal honor he guaranteed that none of
the vast amount would be misused.
Gradually he gained his audience and
when he closed he was greeted uproari
ously by the very nea who had been op
posing him. As he passed out of both
meetings he was stopped and held a gen
eral handshaking reception. Without any
cf the studied art of oratory, but because
he was honest, straightforward and man
ly, he succeeded in winning two opposition
camps.
The first meeting was held In South San
Francisco at Masonic Temple at Four
teenth street and Railroad avenue. At
this meeting M. J. LJnehan made a stir
ring speech favoring the candidacy of 1L
H. Aipeltinger for Supervisor. He ex
tolled his past administration In the of

McKlnley.") Lane replied: I don't know any
thing about that but I do, know that in this
present cause I am first and I da know this,
that I try to be true to myself, and In being
true to myself I am true to the people, the
policy and the party I represent. I know
when I am acting in accordance with the dic
tates of ray conscience that I am pretty
near rUht. and bo long as I have this to guide
me I cannot g-o far wrong.
When you organized the Cnion Labor party
you did what you thought was right, but the
party you organized wu a very different
proposition at that time from the party of to
day. Ate Ruef has tumbled that party down,
so that now It is a mere shell of what it was.
Ruef has been kicked about from one faction
to another until he really does not know where
he actually stands, but in the general knock
ing about he has for the nonce landed up
against the so-called Union Labor party. We
cannot go about trying to buy votes with free
beer and poprycock. WÂ» only -appeal to the
Intelligence of the people and ask them to drop
party lines and look Into the different char
acters of the people who are candidates for of
fices in the municipality in this coming elec
tion.
We don't want any more grafting and hood
ling in cur politics. We are fighting for
cleanness of government. We want an hon
est expenditure of money that you pay as
taxy. If you want an honest government
vote for it; If you don't want an honest gov
ernment don't vote for me.
Last week I was out at a halt in the West
ern Addition on Union street, where some of
the forces of ocr opponents â and I heard
It reported that they wera McNab people â
â¢prickled red pepper on the floor and tried to
break up the meeting. Their trick did not
succeed. Every one. In the audience stayed
until I had finished my speech, and I am
proud to say that a lanr* portion of that au
dience were the representative women of that
part of thlfl community. I want you all to
keep popping questions at me right along and
I will stay here all night if it takes that
length of time to answer them.
At the close of. the address, three.rous
ing cheers were given for Lane, and then'
some one proposed three "cheers tor
Schmitz. These were* given, but "with a
great Tack of gusto. The candidate for
Mayor at once ex claimed: "All right my
friends over there who are. cheering for
my opponent. I now. Invite you all to
come up to the, City Hall on the 9th day
of next January and call on me on the
first floor, where you will receive a hearty
welcome." â¢
J. J. Sweeney acted as chairman of the
meeting. Others who spoke were Ed
mond Godchaux. Judge Mogan, Dr. Dodge,
P. J. Curtis, John Barnett. Judge Ca

CUT IT OUT

A tale that sound* IIkÂ« magic, j-ct ia
but a elinple evidence cf what proper food
can do In the place of improper food:
A lady of Qulncy. IH., says: *Tt seems
impossible that I could ha\-e *one
through what I did and be alive and well
to-day. I was most of my life troubled
with a weak etcmach and severe head-
aches and as I grew older I slowly got
worse. One phyelclan treated me five
years for dyspepsia, without any help,
and I wect to another physician, who said
I had a tumor, and I believed him. I
was unable to bear even the loosest cloth-
ing and could scarcely lift my head, final-
ly becoming 1 entirely beendden.
"Then I changed to another doctor, who
said I had chronic catarrh of the stomach
and advised a change of climate, telling
me I would get well if I would winter In
California. He might as wpU have ad-
vised a triD to the moon In my case.
Then I tried -a change of diet. It seemed
I could not live on crackers and tea, nor
cculd I find anything else to agree with
me. and it began to look as though I
was doomed to die. So I made up ray
mind to eat everything that I craved and
determined to die happy, at least in the
thought of not starving to death.
"Now that I look back at it I don't see
how it is possible for a human beinsr to
live through such misery as I did. Of
course, ray stomach trouble gTew worse
and my head grew worse. I had all my
hair cut off. but It did not help rae, and
when one of my headaches was on I was
really and truly crazy and did not even
recognize my husband. The doctor would
Â«rive me morphine tablets to stop my
crying.
"Then a frlÂ«nd who knew what she
was talking about advised me to give up
white bread and tea. and coffee and try
the.prefilgested food Grape-Â£Â«"uts and Pos-
tum Coffee in place. I did so and I have
bad grand results. The improvement be-
gan trcm-dlately. I had fallen from 125
pounds to S3 pounds in my sickness and
â¢ with my hair cut off and gray, too, I was
a fright.
"In a few days after I started Grape-
Nuts I could eat a little beef and crack-
ers without the least discomfort, my face
began, to fill out and the awful distress
In my stcmach soon ceased. Then my
headaches bes^n to grow less frequent
and the eick, dizzy spells have gone from
nse-kltocether and I have reached and
passed my former, weight and am now
comparatively well and strong. I am cer-
tainly happy and I never touch coffee
now. for I ara certain that coffee and the
white bread and biscuits caused all my
trouble. As soon as my body got the
proper food it did not take it long to put
me rteht bcih in body and mind. AH the
credit is due to Grape-Nnts and Postrjm
in place of white bread and coffee." Name

Chief Engineer James Ward, who also
returned en the Chico, says that the South
Portland's boilers did not explode, there
being no steam in them at the time the
vessel sank. What was mistaken for a
bolkr explosion was the blowing out of
the bulkheads caused by the sudden rush
of water as the vessel took her last dive.
CAPTAIN J. B. McINTYRE, who
was in command of the steamship
South Portland when she was
wrecked on Blanco Reef, arrived
here late Tuesday- night on the
steam schooner Chico. He reported yes
terday at the office of W. S. Scammcll &
Co., the owners of his ill-fated charge.
The captain seems to realize the cloud
under which he rests and has nothing to
say at present in explanation of his con
duct in hastening away from the wreck
in the one remaining lifeboat, taking with
him only five people in a boat that would
have accommodated thirty and leaving
on the sinking vessel a dozen of his ship
mates, whose only means of escape was
such a hurriedly constructed raft as they
could make with their own hands. Mc-
Intyre's report to the .Government inspec
tors will be awaited with interest. It will
not be made public until the official In
vestigation into the causes of the wreck
is held.

Bran and Middlings continue In good shape

The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"There has boen a marked diminution In
shipments of hay during the past week the
total with to-day's arrivals being 1900 tons In
comparison with 2400 tons for the week pre
ceding. These are the lightest arrivals noted
for several months, but In spite, of this fact
we can report no particular change with the
market here. Dealers have been working on
their city warehouse stocks, evidently believ
ing that prices should show no material
change for some little time to come. It looks
to us,, however, as though there might be a
mm* rial advance very shortly, due to a con
tinuance of light receipts. The railroad com
pany admit their Inability to furnish cars as
required and some officials predict a worse
state of affairs than was experienced last win
ter. During November and December of 1902
cars were exceedingly scarce and shipments of
hay were so light that prices took quite a
jump during that time. We are Inclined to
look for a recurrence of this *tatÂ« of af
fairs and believe that shortly After th* 1st
of November our local market will be $1 per
ton higher than it Is to-day: There Is, of
course quite a bit of hay around the bay
available by boat, but by far the greater ma
jority of the crop cannot be so marketed. If
the rain continues to hold off there will be a
still stronger tendency toward higher prices
In the near future.
"There Is very little of Interest to be reported
here concerning our local market at the pres
ent moment. Alfalfa constitute* . the main
portion of shipments by water and most of it
has been contracted for previous to Its arrival.
Other grades show no change.

CHICAGO. Oct. 28. â Under thÂ« Influence of
the large export buslneâ¢ of yesterday and
more reassuring news from St. Louis In re
gard to the bank situation there, wheat opened
firm with' a good general demand. December
being up %6"4c. at 80"54Â«80%c. Traders
watched carefully the action of the St. Louis
market and when prices there began to de
cline soon after the opening, apprehensions of
further trouble seized the pit and a selling
movement begun, which became general
when the December option at St. Louis showed
a. loÂ«Â« of over a cent within the. first hour.
Prospects of increased receipts In the North
west also helped In bringing out selling orders
and the market soon became weak, December
declining to 80%c. The uncertainty of condi
tions In thÂ« Southwestern market caused trad
ers to withhold irders and await developments,
which resulted In a tame market toward the
middle of the day, with prices holding about
steady. I/at*, strength In corn, with a recovery
at St. Louis, caused fair buying by pit traders
during the last half-hour and the early loss
wan all regained. December closing He higher,
The early strength In wheat caused a firm
tone in corn ftt the opening, but later, with the
decline In wheat, there, was much corn for sah\
and price* eased off. December closed at 44 %c
a gain of %&**<?.
â¢ Oats, were Influenced mainly by the Action of
wheat and corn, showing some d<>pllne early
In the session and later rallying and closing
at a small gain. December closed %c higher
at 36%c.
Trade In provisions wsn extremely dull, but
Inclined to firmness, considering the decided
weakness In hogs reported from the yards. Buy.
Ing by packers was the chief source of sup
port. Closing prices were firm, with January
pork up 10c at $12 10; January lard a shada
higher at $6 65@Â« 07% and ribs 5c higher at
$6 32%.

AprL*>ts this week seems to be undoubted. In

cause assigned for this spurt of activity la
that the French crop seems to have been a
failure, and It Is probable that a considerably
Increased foreign demand may result, tending
to maintain values for some time to come at

The fruit market was quite active under a
good demand for shipment on the Puget Sound
steamer. Grapes were the leading feature and
supplies of choice stock In crates were Insuffi
cient to satisfy the demand. The top quota
tion was obtained only for the Tokay variety,
65c being the ruling price for the other kinds.
Receipts of large open boxes from Martinez
were very llcht and dealers were enabled to
clean up the old stock that had been accumu
lating for some days. The quotations for Wine
Grapes were largely nominal, as the demand
was light and dealers were willing to clean up
the general run of offerings for what they
would get. Apples were quiet and the top
quotation was obtained only for exceptionally
fine lots of Spltzenberg and Newton Pippins.
$1 being about the top for the general run of
fancy stock. Good Quinces were in fair re
quest and steady, but there were a lot of culls
offering which could not be sold at any price.
Fancy Pears moved freely at steady rates,
while low grade offerings, which were abund
ant, were overlooked. The other tree fruits
were unchanged. Supplies of Melons were
more than sufficient for requirements and
prices were unchanged.

supply and prices showed but little variation.

was nothing new to report In Citrus or Tropi

WHEAT â Chicago declined It4c. The dally
letter of Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. eald:
"Strength came toward th* close and was
mainly on scalping operatlor*> and covering of
shorts put out early in the day. Cables Indi
cate only dullness. Broomhall wires the. lat
est estimate on tne German wheat crop and
places It at 160,000,000 bushels, against 174,000,.
000 last year and the, rye crop at 375,000,000,
against 402,000,000 a, year ago. Primary re
ceipts are a little larger and about tho same
as last year. There was less talk of export
business than during the last two days. The
Northwest seemed to be the principal seller In
this market and prices there, were relatively
weak, j This probably reflects their Increasing
movement. The artificial condition of the St.
Louis market ts still a disturbing factor. This,
together with the uncertainty regarding the
primary movements and regularity of the ex
port demand, all tended to deprive the mar
ket of decided tendency. It. looks as though
scalping operations were becoming more
profitable for the time being. : Argentine ad
vices continue very favorable.
Other Chicago advices reported that the St.
Louis corner tended to unsettle the market.
New York reported very little export Inter

V- The Immediate Outlook.
.Â¦â¢ The Kew York circular of Henry <~"iews says:
â¢â¢ â¢ "Beyond financial preclncta the outlook.
Uscugh conflicting. 1* not discouraging. Every
-cc* is familiar with Use fart that agriculture.
â¢ ike backbone of the nation, has Just secured
-:->.icthfr profitable harvest. The mercantile
â¢ c!vsÂ« are alto In rood shape. There has been
â¢ IS*HÂ£i H My. overtrading of importance; our
. merrhant* having escaped the speculative
frenry which so nearly overwhelmed Wall
*Â»rÂ«et. The least satisfactory feature in the
rutloek U the industrial situation, which Is
euffering from the consequence* of the trust
. mtn!Â» and labor agitation. Both cantal and
â¢ labor have been aiming at monopoly; both have
: been defying natural lawÂ» ; both have been
. working on lines opposed to the strongest im
, pu!ses in hutr.an nature, and both mutt pay
â¢.the .penalty. Capital has already taken con.
Â¦ siderable cf its punishment, and labor Is be
ginning to se* the Inexorable consequences of
unwise leadership. Now that the iron boom
;â¢ over, the Inflation based upon those phe
."â¢ nomena is rapidly passing away. It must not
; b* forrotten thst we are Just leaving behind
'the. most extraordinary movement In Iron thÂ»
â¢ world ever saw. Its chief source being the
practical rebuilding of American railways dur
/lRg the last fiv* years. This being accom
â¢'â¢plishea, the Iron trade must subside to normal
ccn^SUons. Possibly this may mean a period
â¢ ,<\f temporal-}' prostration: but with lower price*
ether demand* will develop, and the export
Is Â«-,pen as a safety valve. Other lndut
"Â¦ tries ar* in much better shape than the iron
â¢.trade, and there are. few signs of overpro
-"â¢du'-tlon. the only restraint upon business being
â¢the Mjrh prices induced by high costs of pro
â¢ ductton. Nevertheless, outside of the &bovÂ«
â¢drawbacks, the outlook is for at least anctheT
*ix months of good K>flne?s. Railroad traffic
unSitr.lnished, and there *re r.rt serl
us-signs cf reaction in either the West or
â¢â¢South. The Wall street rollsps* !s likÂ»ly to
â¢exercise a reytraining influence all through the
Â¦country : H is even conceivable that In some
. districts * slight falling off may be experi
enced, but the business situation as a whole
affords no good reason for discouragement.
. When the inevitable readjustment Is more
â¢complete the ouUook will be still brighter."

.\EW YOP.K. Oct. 2Â»â The effect of the fiÂ».
Lout* situation on th# etock market wÂ«Â»
fwnem-ha* obecure to-day. The expressions cf
'onfidence ovÂ«r night from that <-enter that the
tunatioo u toucd had a reassuring effect or.
the earlr trading, and the prices hardened. The
opening cf business in St. Louie, which was
later, owing to the difference In time, was fol
lowed by a reaction In stocks. The heavy
withdrawals of currency from this center by
St. Louis carried the level of prices of stock
generally below laÂ«t night. But the la*t hour
cf the market ehowed the best price* of the day.
the morning level being generally exceeded by
a fraction. In the final dealings prices yielded
again and the closing wu rather easy. A
suney of prl<~e chafes will show that the
wholÂ«> movement was very trivial and net
<-har.ges mere insignificant except in a few
cast?. The dullness of the market was In itself
a reflection In some eort of uncertainty felt
over the St. Louis situation, which prompted a
waiting attitude rather than a .disposition 10
â¢ell. There was no selling which was attributed
to St. Louis account. unle?s It might have been
in. American Car. The quarterly report of net
earning* In Pressed Steel Car Company, show-
I Ing them to be less than half of those for the
I corresponding quarter of last year. â¢ naturally
had a sympathetic effect on American Car ak
well at weakening the Pressed Pteel Car Â«ocke.
On the other hand, the stocks of the Gould
Southwestern Railroads centering In St. Louis
were among the few features of positive
strength in the market, although there was
nothing to show there â¢ wae any significance
locsl to St. Louis attaching to the movement.
Pennsylvania was also strong, and People's
Gas had an early advance on a favorable court
derltion. TJie speculative movement In Amal
gamated Copper might be clashed as marking
time, and the dealings in the stock were In
much diminished volume.
The situation at Pt. Louis resulted In tele
Â¦ graphic transfers to that city from here frcm
! the gub treasury of $2,100,000. In addition
*%0.<>0iÂ» was sent to Chicago and $200,000 to
! New Orleans. Banks an also known to bÂ«
shipping heavily through other channel*. This
ts a plain Intimation that the Western crcy
movement needs, though long deferred, are
making large inroads on "local banking reserves,
quite aside from the emergency requirements
at St. Louis. It was not surprising, therefore,
that the rate for call money should rlfee to 6
per cent this afternoon and the rate for time
money Â«rrew dietin'-tly firm. The rite In local
money rates may have contributed to the sharp
I break in sterling exchange, although the offer
ings of cctton mills in that market were re
j ported In very Urge volume and heavy export*
j of grain were also enffap^'J. This prepared Â«x
1 peÂ«-tst)on for a weakening of the bank showing
of next Saturday. But with New York bank
reserve* higher than in th? rorretpcndlng period
for several years, and with the limit of Gov
ernment deposits promised by the Secretary
SL th * Treasury to relieve the situation still
125/iOO.OOQ away, there !s no real present un
j eaFinesn over the monetary situation. As an
evidence over the spirit of distrust toward
banks and trust companies, the St. Louis
j episode .Â« neverthelem deeply impreopive. to the
apprehension of the financial world.
There was some falling off from the recent
volume cf bond transactions and a reactionary
tendency in fpots made the market irregular.

Â¦ ThÂ» best grades of table Potatoes wer* dull
under a limited demand and liberal supplies.
River Burbanks had a steadier tone, as cheap
stock wa* well cleaned up and prices had a
narrower range. There were several In
quiries for shipping stock, hut the firmer
prices checked the movement in that direc
tion. Sweets continued to arrive freely and
price* stood as previously quoted. The best
offerings of Onions were steady at the top
quotation while poor and inferior stock was
dull at 6O@70c per cental.
Fresh supplies Of most kinds of vegetables
arrived too late for the regular morning trade,
but the market was amply supplied with car
ried-over stock, which moved off well at rbout
previous prices. Supplies of Tomatoes con
tinued too heavy for the market to absorb
and there was quite a surplus unsold at the
close. The canners were offering 17%c per
box for poor Btock, but no sales were- reported
at that figure. Hubbard Squash was offering
again, but moved slowly owing to the abun
dance and low price of Marrowfat.

Captain Cochran immediately before his

the : evidence that Captain . Cochran had
been unjustly treated by the special 'offi
cer who placed him under. arrest within
a stone's throw of his apartments' at the
hotel. While It is not denied that the
captain had been imbibing freely -during
the evening,' the statements of witnesses
go to show that be was not in a* condi

TO BE SWELL FUNCTION
SANTA CLARA, Oct. 23.â Observations
at Santa Clara College this morning by
Rev. Jerome Ricard, S. J., professor of
astronomy,' have revealed the sun spot re
ported In The Call of October 15. Since
that time the sun has completed half a
revolution,, bringing the spots again into
view on the opposite edge of the sun's
disk. Professor Ricard In talking of. the
discovery this evening said: .
Â¦ "The large sun spot that disappeared on
the 14th inst. at thV> eastern edge of the
sun's limb at 10:30 a. m. has just reap
peared on the opposite side of the photo
sphere. There can be little doubt that
this new sun spot is the same as the old
one. If we judge from the present 'con
figuration as compared with the one It
had at the time of disappearance, only the
Intensely black markings at the south
end have filled up and developed Into
what may be called a new spot, and the
protuberance at the north end has grown
a bushy tall, with a rather faint spot at
Its extremity. The reappearance of this
triple sun spot was announced for twen
ty-seven days - and six hours after the
time of disappearance, 1. e.', at the end of
this period it would again appear at the
same meridian, this on the assumption
that the regular order of such phenomena
was followed. Therefore In half that time,
when the sun had completed a semi-revo
lutloa around its own. axis, the spot would
again be visible at the opposite edge. The
fact seemes to have corresponded exactly
with the. prediction."* Â¦ \

of departing upon a honeymoon trip.
The wedding of Miss Bertie Bruce and

To-day at noon Mrs. I. Lowenberg's
breakfast will take place in the Maple
room of the Palace. Over 200 guests will
gather at the* annual functionâ for such
It has come to beâ and from Indications
there will be much toasting, both grave
and gay. But isn't a grave toast a rather
funny thing? Â¦' KÂ§3I
The Entra Nous will hold its cotillon
on Friday night at the Maple room of
the Palace. This is the fourteenth year
of the club's existence, during which
time it has given many delightful affairs.
An innovation has been introduced that
promises to abolish that abomination to
dancersâ lookers-on who monopolize the
most available seatsâ for only chaperones
will be permitted the privileges of the
ballroom. It is said that some stunning
gowns are to be shown on Friday night.
One of the most picturesque home wed
dings of the season occurred last night,
when Miss Edyth Wardwell Marion, the
charming daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Washington Irving Marion? became the
bride of Joseph C. Myersteln, the well
known attorney at law.
The bride, stunning ever, made a rav
ishing' picture in her wedding robe of lace,
enveloped in a filmy veil of tulle.
The bride was given into the keeping
of the groom by her father, and was at
tended by Miss Florence Sankey as maid.
The decorations were unusually effective,
the entire lower floor having been
wrought Into a greenwood bower.
After the ceremony . a reception was
held, when 150 guests extended to the
happy pair the rarest of good wishes and
much good advice. They will be away
for three weeks on their honeymoon trip.
The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Father Coyle. during which the or
ganist rendered "Call Me Thine Own" In
softest, 'tenderest tones.
After the ceremony a reception followed
at the home of the bride, where the halls
and reception rooms had been trans
formed Into a garden of blossoms. Fair,
Indeed, was the dining-room, where yel
low chrysanthemums and yellow shades
made a fine setting for the gay bridal
party.
The young people left for a month's
tour of Oregon and Washington.
Yesterday the chancel of St. Mary's
Cathedral was aglow with lights that
gleamed from behind countless ferns and
palms, when Miss Elsie Moraghan plight
ed her troth to Dr. Francis Frederick
Knorp in the presence of many friends.
A pretty bride was Miss Moraghan as
she entered the church on the arm of her
brother, Charles A, Moraghan. She was
charmingly gowned in white cloth and
wore a large white hatâ a feature that in
the East is considered very "smart" just
now for midday nuptials. The bride was
attended by her sister, Miss Eugenie Mor
aghan, who, too, was gowned in white,
wearing a stunning ermine hat with pink
roses. She carried bridesmaid roses,
while the fair bride's bouquet was of
white orchids. George Knorp attended the
groom.
The Tacoma's hull Is of steel, sheathed
to the water line with teak, which in
turn is sheathed with copper. In the cases
of the little Wheeling and Marietta this
sheathing proved a success. How It will
serve in the c^so of the Tacoma remains
to be seen. Some naval constructors
contend that the combination of the steel
and copper, with the action of the salt
water, will cause decomposition of the
hull through electrolysis, i
The Tacoma is the first of the larger
type of vessels built in Pacific waters to
be copper -sheathed. This protecting
armor is expected to do away with the
frequent docking so necessary with Iron
ships. Instead of docking once in nine
months, as customary,; especially when
navigating tropical waters," it Is believed

'This band, to which it would be a
pleasure to listen even In "Yankee Doo

of . the biggest Hying orchestral figure,
Richard . Straussâ the symphonic poem
"Don Juan"-*-to be played here. The com
position is profoundly Interesting, Intense
ly dramatic and unexpectedly melo
dious and ready of appeal. I heard it at
Stanford University on Tuesday. The
Waller number Is also new and a distinct
ly .1 worthy composition, and the Salnt-
Saena is charming. .
Then Mrs. Katharine' Fisk iii the "Sam
son and Delilah" number is perhaps the
most accomplished of American contral
tos at her best,- and Nahan Franko's fid
dling, is of the best of the art, his Corelll
"Theme and Variations" of the best of
Its literature. Then there is the only mil
lionaire conductor, J. 8. Dues, to see and
to like. What more can one ask?
Yesterday "Chorale and Fugue" was
perhaps the most notable of the pro
gramme's features. It was nobly ren
dered. 'The "Valkyrie Ride" went stun
ningly,' Mr.. Duss' mlllionaireshlp quite
forgotten in the manifest sympathy of his
beat.
Mrs. Fisk has sung better, but delighted
nevertheless with her fine art and charm,
ing presence. v She sang a song composed
by Mr. Duss of more- than ordinary merit,
the Bizet "Adieu du l'Hotesse Arabe" and
the Bruguiere "I Arise From Dreams of
Thee." She responded graciously to. the
many encores.
Mr. Franko's solo was the Sarasate
fantasle "Mignon," and showed Mr.
Franko as a superbly poised and highly
temperamental player. Romayne Simmons
accompanied in accomplished fashion.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON t
The empty acreage at the Alhambra
yesterday, at the second concert of the
Metropolitan Opera-house Orchestra, was
a lively disgrace to. the town. Presum
ablyâand the presumption is an imper
tinenceâthe absence of Nordica from the
solo list was the reason. This argues us
provincial Indeed, and our musical veneer
of the i thinnest. Not Nordica, though one
is profoundly - grateful - for her, not Mrs.
Fisk, not Nahan Franko as a soloist, are
the bigfact8 of these blgr concerts. It Is
the "orchestra, that most wonderful of In
struments, here in wonderful evidence,
that is their vital attraction.
Here is. a. band of . nf ty-six men, every
man of i them /an artist, virtuosi Of the
first. rank many. of them. It is a band
lovingly welded together by Seidl, Emll
Paur, Mancinelli, Damrosch and their
kind. It Is a band soaked through with
the best music, blood-brothers In art. It
Is a band . that plays , through page after
page " of , Wagner with hardlya glance at
the notes, the nuance of It a simple habit,
the Impeccable Interpretation, an inherit
ance from Seidl, who descended ! from
Wagner, j It is a band to which It Is pure
pleasure to listen, simply for the tone
colors of the Instruments, each splen
didly, characteristic. of Its kind. No mat
ter \what â¢ Is played," the orchestra Is de
lightful, Intimately interesting to listen to.
And when as yesterday, there is a Chorale
and. Fugue of Bach and the "Ride of the
Valkyries" on the programme, there is no
excuse for any, music-lover with the ne
cessary .* nickel and time to stay away.
. To-night another concert will be givenâ
without Nordica. Here is the programme,
let us.. look at it:
Overture, "Rlenzi" (Wagner): symphonic
poem, ."Don Juan" '.(Richard Strauss); aria,
"Softly Awakens My Heart," from "Samson
arid: Delilah" (Saint-Saens),' Mrs. Katharine

was an exceedingly pleasing one. as was

through her first paces. She made better
than seventeen knots, and, as her. contract
only calls for 16%. builders and the navy
officers who have superintended her con
struction were, well pleased with the work
of their hands. Everything worked har
moniously throughout the trial, and all

of adding a few golden coats to San

as nearly a thing of life as can be con

FBOM THE SHOE BUSINESS
A flne surprise awaits the unsecured
creditors of Eppln&er &. Co. Heretofore
It had eenerally been supposed that out
of the wreck of the grain firm's business
not more than 10 or IS per cent would be
realized to the unsecured creditors. Re
ceiver "Wadsworth said yesterday that he
row thlnks.it probable that what is saved
may amount to 25 per cent
This Increase for the benefit of the
creditors Is accounted for by Mr. Wade
worth as the result of finding: various
properties that were not at first known.
Generally the assets have been largely
disposed of and it is known of what value
they are. having been turned into cash.
The cattle and sheep have been disposed
of to buyers. Yesterday Receiver Wads
worth asked the Superior Court for an
order to sell all that remains in his hands.
"I look for a speedy settlement quite
soon now." said the receiver. "The only
obstacle to petting everything closed up
early lÂ» found in banks which still seem
to entertain the Idea that they have some
ownership in the grain that was in the
warehouses of Eppinger & Co. at the time
the firm suspended business. Their suits
are In court. The receiver does not think
their claims are valid. The time to be
taken in reaching a determination on this
point In the case of each bank interested
Is the leading element of uncertainty when
estimating the time that will be needed
for final accounting. Some of the banks
have not filed any claim."
The value of real estate may reach $50,
000. exclusive of the warehouses at
Crockett, which are estimated to be worth
somewhere from $60,000 to $70,000. The
realty that is held as security by the
London, Paris and American Bank will be
sold, Altogether the various properties of
Epplnger & Co. may bring $350,000 to $600,
000 In cash.
