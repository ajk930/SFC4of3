' He wanted to advise her to let him help
Howard. He recalled their talk once
about the false pride of those who would
not take help from even those who cared
for them and wanted to help them. He
ventured: "Can we not arrange some plan
for me to help Howard until"â he began,
but stopped for the look In her eyes.
She did not say anything, perhaps she
could not speak, for the hurt he had given
her. But he saw, without one word be
ing said, that his advice could not take
the shape of an offer of the kind help he
would have - gladly extended to Howard;
that if he did not want to imperil his own
chance of receiving the word he longed to
hear ' Grace .'Â¦ speak,' ha -'must, respect the
pride . for : her brother he saw shining In
hefeyes." "May I see 'the letter you re
ceived T" he asked. -
In Mrs. Hartley's little parlor she did
tell him. Howard had gone out of town,
the night before, she said. That morning
she had received a letter from a news
paper friend of his, containing a message
from Howard. But the letter was de
signed to .keep from her some misfortune
of Howard's. It was meant to deceive
her, f he had felt sure, as soon as she
read it. Why? Tes, she would tell him
allâ because it contained a sum of money,
as if coming from Howard, which she did
not believe Howard could have sent Her
fears aroused, she had gone at once to
Howard's bachelor apartment. She was
told that Howard had not lived there for
months, although he always called there
for. mail. He had done that.
Grace then knew to keep up the decep
tion, and this letter was a part of
the same deceit. Her heart was utterly
miserable. She had been a burden. In
stead of a help, to her brother: and if she
had not been blindly selfish, thinking only
of her own plans, never of his, she would
have discovered the truth before, and
gone to him and shared his poverty, per
haps helped to make It less hard; anyway
been by his side to encourage him. Instead
of burdening him with her selfishness and
extravaganceâ and she was very misera
ble. Now, Howard was always being ship
wrecked and she did not even know where
his room was, to go there at once, and
live near him and share his lot, whatever
it was; and be there to welcome him when
he returned from his shipwrecks. And
, she was very miserable and it had been a
relief to her to tell her troubles and she
wanted a man's advice and perhaps Mr.
Worthlngton could advise her. . -
Something in her voice exalted the
young man. The crowd, with its thou
sand interests, the busy, the idle, the
hunted, swept and surged about them,
few seeing, none caring, though some
may have mused a moment on one group
of the passing picture, a young man, with
exulting eyes, close guarding a young
woman whose eyes were downcast, and
filled with tearsâ but not wholly sorrow
ful.
"Will you tell me what makes you un
happy?"
"Yes." .
"No. no, no! Tou must not!"
They walked on for a time In silence.
dose together, so as not to be separated
by the surging crowd; and then, after
glancing at her sad face with a love
In his - own -eyes which she saw. and
sometimes met with her own eyes, steadi
ly, sometimes drooped her eyes before,
he said to hÂ«r gravely, "Will you not tell
me why you are unhappy?" Her eyes met
his again, wistfully, as If It' would be a
relief to. tell him everything, but she did
not speak and he added, "Because I love
you very much and want to comfort you
If I can, to sympathize with you. to help
youâ because I love you very much!"
He had forgotten every one of the thou
sand phrases he had thought of to tell
his love; forgotten the time, place, 'cir
cumstance he had Imagined would most
favor his declaration, and In the solitude
of the crowd, unmindful of the world that
pressed them close side by sideâ or else
would part themâ he seemed to be alone
with her, and in homely words which he
had not numbered among all those he had
rehearsed, he told her over and over he
loved her. ' "
"No, no, no!" sheÂ»whlspered. "you must
not! I am unhappy! I am unhappyl"
"Not because I say I love you?"
tÂ«r. with a responsive glance at Jack,
said, "I am going to shop; but Grace
Paxton, who has a headache because she
works all day and all night, and worries
the rest of the time. Is going as straight
home as ever was." She gave Jack an
other look as if saying, "and you are go
ing home with her." She avoided Grace's
detaining hand, hurried ahead a few
steps, turned, and said, "Mamma Is to
meet me, so you two go home and have
tea together," and rushed on Into the
crowd. . â¢

you severelyâ as dear old dad Used to say

Turnbull said, as he gave the letter to
his companion. "I've a strong impression
thnt Paxton reveals In that letter facts
about his affairs which, he has tried to
conceal from his sister. If it Is so. I hope
it need never be. sent. I had good news
to tell him about some of his workâ that's
why I followed him." '; â¢
It was rot strange that' Turnbull. with
his intimate knowledge of Howard's af
fairs and his sympathetic perceptions'
sharpened by his feelings for Grace, had
made so close conjecture as to the con
tents of the letter. Perhaps, had he read
it, he would have known better than an
other, the heart-ache, the bruised pride,
the stormy half-dazed mind, with which
the letter was written in its brave at
tempt to conceal the truhâ yet tell It!
This was the letter:' r r
He was silent while George fumed and
fretted and swore; making frequent tip
toe trips to the bed room, and at last
busying himself putting away Howard's
clothing, which had been hastily thrown
about the room. He gathered up a num
ber of things fallen from the pockets,
among them a letter addressed to Grace.
"That's the trouble on his mind," George
said, throwing the letter to Turnbull.
"The poor fellow Is muttering her name,
over and over, in his sleep."
Turnbuil took the letter, laid it on the
table before him, and looked at it a long
time before giving it to George to return
to Howard's pocket. It was a letter
Howard wrote to his ; sister Just before
he started out on the story, Intending to
post it.
'â¢Nothing of the kind," Turnbull said
wearily. "In the first place we couldn't
get a witness. Even that half-witted sea
food man would not dare tp testify to
what he knows. . A,nd do we want
Howard's eisler to read the story? She
must know nothing If we can prevent It.".
the surgeon returned, which he promised
to do at noon.
Turnbull told George that he had been
at work in his office until nearly mid
night, and then had gone to the office
of the paper oh which Howard was em
ployed to. Â»ee him about some work he
had" found for him. He learned that How
ard was out on a murder story, and he
(Turnbull) was on his way to the police
station, where he expected to find How
ard, or learn where he was, when he
came upon him in his pitiable plight.
"The dogs!" cried George. "The Sioux!
The thugs! I'll find the murderer who
struck Howard and kill him. My father
himself shall prosecute the ruffian. The
cut-throat!"
"Oh. no!" she cried. "Because he knows
Howard's first thought la always of me!"
"I will see Turnbull," said Jack, "and
learn what I can."
"And find out where Howard's room is,
so that I can move tnto one near his and
be there when he returns."
"And I will come there for you,"
"For me?"
"To take you away as my wife."
"I have not said that I will marry you."
"But you willl"
"No. I shall lire with' Howard and
study and workâ designâ and help him."
"Howard will be a successful, busy man
and won't want you around him."
"Tou are a successful, busy man."
"I agree to try to be one when you are
ray wife."
"I haven't said that I love you."
"Tou do."
"How do you know?"
"Because you haven't said that you d*>
not."
It seemed only a minute or two later,
but It was really an hour, when Grace
said, "Florence and her mother are com

"May I tell them?" he ukeaL
"No. I haven't promised."
"Then I shall go." bÂ« laughed, not at
all in the manner of a man wboÂ«e doubts
had not been removed. When he had
opened the parlor door, he turned hack:
"I'm going to the theater to-night with

long-standing engagement. If you care,
I'll not goâ have an Illness."
"Have a good time." she laughed, and

"I've often heard Harry speak of Mr.
Paxton as the only boy friend he had in
the West, where he was to school. I
wouldn't take ! It." she added, weeping
softly, "only that we are so poor now."
The surgeon returned, saying that an
ambulance was at the door, and a minute
later Harry came back, with George Ban
nister. ThÂ« latter was white and trem
bling with rageâ he had forced the true
story of the brutal attack from Harryâ
and his torrent of anathemas . was -so
unceasing, so picturesque, so baleful, that
the sureeon more than once looked up
from his . careful preparations to move
Howard to glance at the young man In
surprise.
"Harry?" repeated Turnbull vapuely,
not removing his fixed gaze from (How
ard's face.
"Harry, my husâ the sea-food man, who
helped you."
Turnbull glanced about the room. "We
shall not trouble the policeâ the vermin!â
about this. There's no trouble for. Harry
there." She was sitting on a trunk, he
on the only chnlr. The bed and a small
cookstove completed the room's furn'ture.
"Will you take th!s for the help Harry
has been to us?" and he gave her a ten
dollar bin.
There were a number of scratches on
the sea-food man's face, which the sur
geon quickly washed and dressed, stop
ping in his work to exam'ne curiously
an old dlmpte-Jike scar en Harry's cheek,
but saying nothing. Th^n Harry hurried
away, important that he was to be a
messenger in this wonderful affair and
to ride in a carriage! "He'll be gone
half an hour, I suppose?" the surgeon
paid. "I can get an ambulanceâ one off
dutyâ from Roosevelt Hospital in \ that
time. I served my tim* there."
"Thank you." said Turnbull. "Go to
any expense. You are very thoughtful."
The surgeon went away, and Turnbull
rat by the bedside, murmuring: "Poor
boy! Who Is to tell her? If I had only
caught us with him in time!" He was
staitled out of his troubled thoughts by
Bessie asking tearfully: "Will Harry Set
Into trouble with the police over this?
The doctor said It was a police club
wound."
"Can't the doctor do something for
Harry's cuts first?" asked Bessie timidly.
"I'll hurry," answered Harry excitedly,
changing his apron for an old overcoat;
one too old and torn and stained . to be
pawned.
"It's a bad scalp laceration only, so far
as the superficial wound itself goes," the
surgeon said, "but there are some symp
toms of concussion of the brain." '
"Can he be moved from here?" Turnbull
asked.
"Yes; better now than laterâ and he
should be. This Is no place for him."
Turnbull called to Harry: "Get in/o
the carriage we came in and go to this ad
dress as fast as you can. Don't come
back without the gentlemanâ Mr. Georgo
Bannister."
The doctor stepped to the door and mo
tioned to Turnbull. Bessie had quickly
cleared away all traces of the dreadful
workâ the blessed work! â and Howard,
his head neatly bandaged, lay on the bed,
Â¦till unconscious.
"I've got a paper with his father's name
on It." Harry whispered mysteriously, as
if to force himself on Turnbull's atten
tion by startling his mind toward him.
"Do you know a deed? Does a man
listen, Mr. Turnbullâ does a man own a
deed that was his father's, when his
father is dead? Eh? I could show It.
too. If it'e any good to him and the po
lice weren't told."
"Listen!" cried Turnbull. "Did he
moan?"
"Who is it?" whispered Nora. "Harry,
tell me, who is in there?"
"Mr. Paxton. Howard Paxton. I know
him."
"So do I." whispered Nora. "He's the
gentleman who gave me the money the
night I wouldn't have had the rent, and
when we had the nice dinner. That was
his. tooâ the money for that."
"Was It?" asked Harry, quick tears
coming to his eyes. "He was always bet
ter, kinder than other men to me." He
turned again to Turnbull. "Would I have
to go to court if I gave Howard the pa
per I've kept all this time?'
"What paper?" asked Turnbull, but so
sharply that Harry was frightened and
only raid, "I never meant to keep it. If
it's any good to him he can have it. Is
a deed valuable?" â¢ - -.
"Always! Alwaysr Harry cried, eager
to free his mind on this Important sub
ject. "I'm from his home, too I'm Harry
Lambert. I always knew him. He was
nicer to me than any , one else. Helped
me with arithmetic and history."
But Turnbull was again listening for
any sounds from the front room, other
than the quiet even voice of the surgeon,
directing Bessie.
"Find cut for me at least If the man Is
p'fve or dead," he whispered hoarsely to
Harry.
"He's alive," said Harry, when he re
turned to TurnbulL "They shaved the
hair away and the doctor's stitching, and
Bessieââ"
"Don't tell me those things, you hound!"
moaned TumbulL "Have you been say-
Ing that you knew Mr. Paxton? How the
devil did rou ey^r know him?"
Turnbull stared, to find the figure In
bed staring at him. "Aren't you one of
the girls who work In the office?" he
whispered.
"Yes, Mr. Turnbull."
"Then what in the name of heaven are
Â¦yep doing here?"
"She's my sister," Harry whispered.
"She's my sister. Tou know me. You've
written pieces about meâ Smiling Harry-
I know Mr. Paxton. He always helped
me at school."
ITs.rry was In a frenzy of excitement
and kept repeating over and over, "We
were boys together; he helped Harry at
school."
Hut Turnbull had forgotten him. the
staring: figure on the bed. even where he
â¢was. In the eagerness with which he lis
tened for sounds he dreade4,to hear from
ikt> next room.
The poor woman, thinking that the
man's wavering mind had wavered wholly
out. began to try to quiet him. but the
appearance of two men carrying a bruised
and bleeding body between them called
all her woman's sympathies into prompt
and calm play, and without question she
prepared the bed and helped the surgeon
in ways that Turnbull could not. He
turned his head aside, weaker than Bes
sie, when the surgeon began his work,
but Bessie was a quick-witted assistant.
"Is there another room? Can I go
somewhere elseâ near byâ untilâ for a lit
tle?" Turnbull asked of Harry.
"This way." Harry said, drawing him
to an inner room, where he lighted' the
pa-. Ac he did eo a little bent figure rose
tip In the bed In a corner and asked In a
friphtenod tone, "What's the matter,
Harry?"
Bessie was up. sewing, when Harry
burst Into the room and frightened her,
he looked so wild. 'Howard Paxton!" he
cried. "From my old home. He was al
ways kind to me. Hurry, Bessie! The
bed. Clear the bed. The doctor's coming
licre with him!"
"That's It, then." Turnbull said, as he
helped the surgeon lift Howard Into the
carriage.
or tare what, why Turnbull did not want
the story known; that meant that he
t;< <-d not fear a newspaper "roasting,"
trad to be the subject of that treatment,
especially when the "roasting" was done
by Turnout!, was an experience the officer
pn-atly feared. Thus reassured, he took
cVarge of the situation In a friendly man
ner. "Here, you loafers! Make room
there!" and he prodded the too curious
with bis club. "Give the gent air."
"He needs prompt attention," the sur
jreon said to Turnbull. "Decide quick
where Is to be taken."
"Here's Smiling Harry with the car
riage." the officer said. "If you want to
give Mr. Paxton quick attention take him

"it's too bad to be properly dressed.

.i'viination. "Have you sent In an ambu

"No ambulance/' Turnbull said sharp-
I; . "Ambulance cases are news stories.
Ttia must not get Into the newspapers."
- J s thought was of Grace.
The guilty police officer sighed with re
\'.<il. There was a reason, he did not know
Turnbull was not listening. "Poor boy!
Peer boy!" he whispered, as he rested
Howard's bead on his arm. "Run for a
carriage. Quick," he said, looking up.
Harry ran to tbÂ© corner nearer Broad
way, and soon returned with a nighthawn
carriage.
'"So aid I." added another officer, who
had quietly crossed the street. "And so
did a dozen witnesses over on the corner.
"You can't make no holler about a police
outrage here."
One of my men?"
Turnbull fell to his kneei by the side of
Howard, lifted his head until he saw his
face and white with rage looked up and
said. "What devil work Is this?"
-He fell, Mr. Turnbull. Honest he did.
Why, these two parties here, Giinny and

"â¢j--;iw him fall."
"Well, ret to hell out of here with him."
the offioer said, noticing a man. not of
the neighborhood, approaching. "It's too
bad the gentleman fell and cut his head
en the curb." he added aloud, as the
stranger drew near. The stranger was
attracted by the attitude of the three
znen standing over the body, fallen, mo
tionless, silent. "What U It?" he said,
seeing the blood, dully reflecting a near
by electric light, but not seeing the face,
which was hidden.
"Hello, Mr. Turnbull!" exclaimed the
cflcer, "I'm glad you happened along;.

She had dropped her cloak In the chair,
and looked very beautiful in rich evening

aflame with such excitement that - he
feared for her reason.

Â¦peaking rapidly, now, but hoarsely.
"Listen to me, I muit know where that

Worthington was shocked. He could
only believe that the girl was distraught;
and considered If It was not his dutv to
call a servant, though she forbada J*â¢
"Will vou find him. Take me to himr

for there can be no purpose In my doing
so Your condition distresses me, and I
wish you would let me call your maid."-
In his real concern his voice had grown
kind. She had never heard that tone In
it. and tears came Into her eyes. She
spoke more calmly In reply, but with an
Intense earnestness. "Of course, you
don't understandâ I must make you un

you think I am. Mr. Worthington. It Is
not to have that man punishedâIâIâbe

"Stop! Stop! I'll tell you. Y\\ tell you

She etrode the length of the room, her

close to him. looking Into his eyes as she
spoke:
"Mr. Worthlneton. theyâ I know

"He Is everything to me!"
"What Is he to you?"
"Now you hate me again. Listen, then!
He is my husband, and I love him!"
Worthlngton's mind was staggered. In
stead of the woman's startling statement
confirming his first Impression that she
was distraught It began to dispel that be
lief: for there was the manner of truth
about her now; 6he was outwardly more
calm and recoverlns from the shock that
had at first paled and drawn her face,
and shot her eyes with wildness. She
, might be mistaken, but he no longer

"Your husband!" he gasped.
"My husband! We were married more
than two years ago. They sent him away
from me! Tricked him away! They told
me he was dead. But I never believed It
I never believed It!" and she struck her
breast violently.
"Is it not probable that you are mis
takenâyou saw him but a moment"
"No! No. not mistaken!" she cried. "I
would have recognized him In heaven or
bell, as I did thereâ positively: In an In
stant! Oh, find him for me!"
"Why is It not better that your father,
rather than I. should do that for you?"
"No, no. no! He would send him away
again. He Is accusedâ It is a wicked lie!
MrT Worthington." she added rapidly, as
If a new thought had suggested to her
why he hesitated to help her. "think as
meanly of me as you like, but not that I
under any circumstances would have
wronged you by marrying you. Even if
they had dragged you to consent to ask
me to be your wife I should not have let
you remain Ignorant of who I am â what
I am. Don't think that of me. Pity meâ
and help me. Oh, did you see his poor,
scarred face! You are a man; I am not
asking an unmanly thing of you. Not a
thing a brave man cannot do for a wom
an. Help tne!"
"I will help you," he said, his blood
rising In his face. "First tell me, did he
recognize youâ It will prove that you can
not be mistakenâ did he recognize you?"
"Yes!" she whispered, a wonderful
change softening her face. "He knew me
âbecause hÂ« smiled at me. Did you not
see him iznlle? I tried to speak; to call
out 'Harry,* when he smiled at me. but
my brain reeled, and before I could speak
we had started."
Worthington was silent for a little, and
then eaid. "I will bring you his address
In naif an hour," and he started for tho
door.
"Thank you." she saldÂ« and she touched
his hand, not offering hers. "But do not
goâ eend. The others are coming. They
would ask questions. Send. There is writ-
Ins material on the desk In the next room,
there. You will keep my secret for the
present?"
"I will."
Daisy went to receive the guests, and
Jack wrote this note, addressed to the
police sergeant of his home precinct
whom be knew: "Dear Sergeant:
Please learn, and send to me by the
bearer, the address of a theater district
character, called in newspaper stores
â¢Smiling Harry.* He Is a peddler of 6ea
food."
Jack addressed the note, gave It to his
footman to deliver, and Joined the other
guests at aupper, loklng so conscious of
his secret that It was the general opinion
at the supper table that he had devised
his early return to the house with Daisy,
for the sentimental reason suggested by
his happy bearing In the early part of the
evening. A telephone message from Isaao
Bunton explained his absenceâ an unex
pected meeting with some Western
friends at the theater exit detained him.
After supper, and in the confusion of gen-
era! departure, his servant gave Jack a
note. He glanced at It taw that It con
tained an addrees, and. gay* It, unnoticed
by the rest, to Daisy. ; X -^
XIX- THD SEA FOOD MAN'S BISEL
Isaae Bunion had Beta I the sea-food
TTinn Just when Daisy did, and h* had
been nearly as much affected. For a mo
ment h* did all but lose consciousness,
and saw nothing of the glare of light and
color, and the confusion of motion- about
him. â¢â¢ His first impulse, when ha was con
scious of any,, was to stize Harry, but
when he looked around him the polios had
roughly shoved the sea-food man out of
tho way of Mr. Worthington, and that
gentleman was helping Daisy into j the
brougham. Bunton broke through the
crowd, circled It, hurried from corner to
corner, but the white-aproned peddler was
nowhere to bÂ« seen. Harry, more -afraid
of tha police than ever, since the experi
ence of the night ' before, when he had
witnessed the assault en Howard Paxton,
now cunningly concealed himself In the
black shadow of a deep hallway, until tho
officers .who had . hustled him out of the
crowd should have moved on. But a
greater fear seized him there, a f eÂ»r that
dazed and shook him; he saw his old em
ployerâfrom whom h* had stolen money
saw him searching for some oneâ for him.
Harry had not seen Daisy.
Bunton, trembling /and half stunned,
wandered about the streets aimlessly for
an hour before he thought to telephone to
his wife an excuse for his absence from
supper. Then, not daring to face her in
quiring eyes, the questions she would be
sure to ask about his haggard looks, went
to a hotel. But he did not. sleep in the bed
room v he hired, nor at all that night His
affairs were approaching a crisis In 'Wall
Street: he would soon make or lose a for
tune and he had come to recognize, in the
past few-weeks, that the chances were
much against him. The marriage of Daisy
to young 'Worthington and the. absorption
of the Bunton mining property ji by the
Worthington Interest at Burito'h's own
terms, meant his financial salvation.. But
Daisy had seen and recognized her hus
band In the sea-food man! She had
fainted at the door of the" carriage.. where
the sea-food man stood. That' told the]
story; ended Isaac Bunton's* hope of help
by the marriage. Morel Could he now
undertake the desperate hazard of selling
the landâ with Harry Lawton alive? Cer
tainly not unless he could buy Lawton
off: make sure about the deed and destroy
it if In existence! Would he do It? Could
he do It? He asked the question a thou
sand times and for far Into the night the
only answer was, "If you do notâ Ruin I
Ruin of your fortune, hopes, . ambitions,
reputation!"
Who was Howard Paxton that he was
to be considered? Must he be given the
property for which his father had paid
what now would not be a month's Income
on Its value? Had not Isaac Bunton done
much for Dr. Paxton â secured him office,
promoted his political designs at cost of
time and money? Men had paid as much
as five thousand dollars for an office, no
more desirable; arid was Howard Paxton
to realize from his father's loanâ "I have
a right to consider It only a loan." he
thoucrhtâ was Howard to realize from that
"What did you say, captain?" 'he'; asked,
after the captain- had been at work for
five mlnutts on his reports. V. ' :' â¢

"Oh, yts!" T ".\
This Information seemed to -give the:
captain excuse to return to his reports,,
and he did so. Isaao Bunton . wiped his :
forehead, looked out Into , the â¢ dismal ;
street crowded with children of the tene
ments so young, so cold, so thin, so.
poorly fed, and so frequently under ! the:
wheels of passing teams that not one of
them seemed destined to become \ofi age,
or to have any one at all concerned over
that remote possibility. But neither the
scratching of the captain's pen' nor- the
shrill squeals of the children helped' Mr.'
Bunton to think; and. It was a long time
before he said slowly, "Yes, she is of
age, and they were legally married. I
may learn more when -I go -home; but I.
should likeâ If my wife doesn't know
where they areâ to see that man. As soon>
as possible." ->* " -Â»

XXâ CALEB BANNISTER ON THE
TRAIL.
Another man. more Important than
Isaac Bunton, was seeking Harry Law
ton; a man whose appearance , in the
case increased the Interest of the captain
of detectives measurably. This was Mr.
Caleb Bannister, chief adviser of the
Worthington interests, and a man in
whose behalf the Captain had done much
work; little of which was known to the
public and little of which appeared on
the re'eords of the Police Department
"Dld you get any notion of why How
ard â¢ should go to bis assistance ? It was
a. rash thing, tor do." -
''Oh. let mÂ« â¢eel" George replied, trying
to remember. _"Th* ! foolish fellow said
that he. went 'to" school with Howard, and
he said something â harped on some

"And' what did he say about a deed?"
"Why. . dad. : I can't recall. % I think _he
would have said moreâ it was on our way
to his rooms, where Howard was then â
If I'd not threatened to throw him out of
the carriage if he didn't stop his chatter."
The lawyer, groaned. "I wish, my son,
you had some of your father's command
of 'temper." Â¦ .
"And listen to a half-witted tea-food
man's prattle?" ''
â¢ "You'll learn more by listening than by
talking." Â£
Htre a servant brought in the card of
David Turnbull. "Admit him," Mi. Ban
nister.' said quickly.
"Well, Turnbull. how arÂ« my honest
friends Carson-'and Faulkner?" he asked
when the reporter entered.
â¢ "Both of those honest gentlemen are
prospering, ".Turnbull 'said gravely. "And
they are possessed by a great dcs.re that
I should obtain your views . on the pro
gress of the Iron f combine. It seems that
the- street is much disturbed in its own
mind by the hitch In negotiations, and is
torn by conflicting, rumors as to the
cause."- : ; Â¦ \ : . .
"Dear me!"- exclaimed th* lawyer. "I
should be cruel, indeed,- if I withheld any
Information that might allay the fever of
the, street, .<What are the rumors?â that I
may talk intelligently." . Â»
"For Instance, that one isaae Bunton?
one of the Western plungers, is In a con
spiracy to hold up the interests you repre
sent and is elylnjc you trouble."
"Isaac Bunton? Now, would he be the
gentleman hailing from White River?"
Mr. Bannister asked, as if not quite cer
talnwho Isaac Bunton might be. !
' ."The same," Turnbull answered.
"Well, of course. If I have anv Infor
mation deeply affecting the Interests I
represent' I could not bear to withhold it
from my â¢ honest - friends Carson and
Faulkner, no matter how much it might
injure my clients to disclose their plans."
"Of course not." Turnbull said, bowing
gravely. "I took the liberty :o say as
much when I was asked by your honest
friends to interview you. Seriously, Mr,
Bannister, is there any UiformaUon you
care to make public, as on authorized
statement, or otherwise?"
"There may be. Turnbull. Let me con
sider a little. In the 'meantime I must
tell you how distressed I am to hear of
our young friend Paxton's mishap."
"A bad business, sir. But by to-morrow
I shall, with the surgeon's permission, tell
him the good news I wanted to tell him
the night he. was hurt"
"That will hurry his cure, no doubt By
the way, have you spoken to him about
the curious claim the manâ what's his
name: Harry Lawtonâ makes, that they
Isaac Bunton, and Isaac Bunton alone, to
have been killed more than two years ago,
and on the day Harry Lawton left Bun
ton's office for the last time Dr. Paxton
drew $5000 from a. bank, and on that day
he' visited Bunton's office, as his memo
randum book shows; and on that day
Bunton closed a deal In plgiron which we
have found out he had been trying for
several days to close. Harry Lawton.
Harry Lambert Um! A deed? Show the
gentleman in." this to the servant who
brought the captain's card. -
"They caught me by 'phone at the
twelfth precinct and I drovÂ» right ovÂ«r
here," the captain said.
"Hope I didn't take you away from any
Important business, captain." the lawyer
said, shaking hands cordially with the de
tective and offering him a cigar as he
motioned him to a seat They had often
conferred, these two men.
"A matter of no importance at all, only
it has riled my temper and I've been read-.
Ing the riot act to the plain clothes men
of that precinct Here I am. asked by
a gentleman to locate a well-known char
acter, and I say It will be no trouble to
do it, but I slip up. Why, if my ten-year
old boy had been sent out to locate Smil
ing Harry, the sea-food man. and didn't
do It In half an hour. I'd spank him; but
these plain clothes men have been potter
ing around like a lot ofâ what's the mat
ter, governor?"
They had talked together in low tones
and with deep, concentrated Interest for
half an hour, and then each sank back
In his chair and regarded the other
thoughtfully through clouds of smoke
from freshly lighted cigars.
"And you say, governor," the detective
at last asked, with a perplexed manner,
"that you cannot account for young
Worthlngton's asking for Smiling Harry's
address the very night before Bunton
asks me to find the party."
"What I say .s that I am almost posi
tive that it had nothing to do with this
suggestion of a deed. I can imagine a
reason: he was at a theater party with
the Bunions that nightâ my wife" was of
the party at my requestâ and the girl.
Miss Bunton, may have seen her hus
band. Smiling Harry, on the street and
asked Jack Worthington to find him for
her."
"That sounds like mighty good reason-
Ing, governor."
"But of no Importance as I can see, as
we already know that the fellow disap
peared the next morning with Miss Brun
tonâor his wife, Mrs. Harry Lawton, as It
seems safe to call her."
"Governor," the captain said, after^ a
pause, "I guess the detectives out th'ere
in White River are not a strictly first
class article."
"But we've had our men at work out
there." x
"They didn't work with all the N Infor
mation we have now. I'm feeling like a
few days oft on sick leaveâ I'll take them
in White River."
A week later the captain called on' Mr.
Bannister, and gave him the result of his
visit to the old home of the Buntons and
Paxtons. It did not seem to be very Im
portant, only that the captain had found
a man named Dan Mannlx, formerly em
ployed by Isaac Bunton, who recalled
tut Harry Lawton, when he last left
Bunton's office, had said to him, Man-
pleasanterâ to you. So Miss Paxton has 'Â¦
consented to make you happy?"
"She has, sir," he replied, radiantly.
"I hear a good . deal of thÂ« Paxtons
through my children. The young man has .
good pluck." '
"Indeed he has. And she is as brave i
as he la. I consider that If I have no
other good fortune in life than to win har -
for a wife, I've had my shareâ more than
I deserve!"
The old lawyer smiled at the eagrsr
youngster, and said, "It is a good thing
for a woman to be so lovedâ and for a
man to love so. Does the lady give you j
hope of an early marriage?"
"She talks of years! She wants to stand
by her brother until he's well I enough j
established to marry, and have a horn*,
of his own!" â¢ â¢â¢ . -
"And thenâ sooner or laterâ she will
make you happy?".:
"She has : promised. If It were not for
their. prlderâ " i
"Yes,- I, know," Mr. Bannister inter
rupted, -a'-little hastily. "If it were not
for their pride the brother would not ob
ject to prosper by means of a rich
brother-in-law. That wouldn't do. Not
do at all! I like his pride."
' "So do Iâ at the expense of a great daal
of patience." Jack laughed on his way
of the outer room, but before be reached
the door a clerk entered with a telegram.
Mr. Bannister glanced at the message. I
wrote the word "Yes" on a blank and I
told the clerk to hurry It off. ". ..':. I\
"You will find the study of plant life.** h
he said to Jack, as he walked toward the 1
outer door with him, "an aid to the un- K
derstandlng of certain human abnormali- W
ties. Now. I must be off for an engage- Ii
ment" ' I
The telegram he had received read: I '
"Bessie Day has bought a ticket for a I
train that leaves In an hour by the New ft
York, New Haven and Hartford. Can you E
go with me?" Eg
*' XXIVâ THD CHASE ENDED. Ji
Bessie Day had been shadowed by the 1 1
police for many weeks, and when she I
went to the Grand Central station and k
bought a railway ticket her shadow tele- Di
phoned the fact to the captain of de- W
tectives. He hurried to the station, to
learned that Bessie's train would not B
leave for an hour, and notified Mr. Ban- W
nister of the situation. a
It was In the middle of the afternoon ft
when the tralnireached Hartford, and m
Bessie started off briskly, followed by the m
captain and the lawyer. She went at H
once to the theater, spoke a word to a fa
man in the box office, -and passed In. rj
The captain bought two tickets for the W
matinee performance going on. and they F
followed Bessie in. The chorus was on I
the stage, with some minor people, but n.
Bessie watched the chorus only, for she II
and some others of the newly engasrjd II
were there for that purpose. The cap- JV 1
tain watched Bessie. He seemed sur- IA
prised. She had Joined some other women ft,
and was talking over the work going on uk
upon the stage, in a manner too profes- W
sional to suggest that she was there in Â¦
search of Harry, or expected to see tho a
woman who had stolen him from her. B
But when a little later Daisy came on j
the stage. Bessie started violently, and I
half rose from her seat She sank back. V
and her companions questioned her, but 01
the wealth and position now all but se
cured by Isaac Bunton: only needing this
land to be secured absolutely? , L 5
So all through the night he Juggled with
conscience and took advice with the devil.
Yet when morning came he was not-de
terminedâso he told another Isaac Bun
ton who once lived on a farm and scorned
lying and falseness-rnot determined yet
to rob. But he would find Harry Lawton
and learn if the deed had been kept all
this time, and If lost, destroyedâ why,
then he would consider.
.He breakfasted early, for he was eager
to- have the police find Harry for him.
He went down toward police headquar
ters, but it was so early he feared that a
call at such an hour would suggest to the
police more importance to his business
than he wanted to appear. So he went to,
his office and forced himself to wait there
for an hour. At headquarters he sent his,
card to the captain of detectives and was
at once conducted into the presence:, of
that official. "Captain," he said, and
though he tried to speak In a carelosa
voice the Captain looked up sharplyâ and
then looked awayâ "I want to be put Into
communication with a peddler of crabs
and such like, I saw near one of the thea
ters last night." . V~~ . ;
"Chap with a smileâ always smiling?"
the Captain asked briskly. ,'
"Smooth face, white apron, basket cov
ered with a towel, cries his wares, 'Sea
food!' Is that about the description?"
"Precisely, as I remember."
"Not much trouble about that." the Cap
tain said, drawing a desk telephone to his
lips. He asked the Information
Bureau in the same building for a
connection and it was made with
surprising speed, and then he tele
phoned: "Sergeant, send a man out and
locate Smiling Harry. Be lively; party
is waiting here. You know the place,
ch? Well, send a man around there to
see If Harry is at home."
He shoved the instrument to the back
of his desk and said to Mr. Bunton, "He
lives only a block or two from the
Twentieth Precinct station-house. I'll
have word in a few minutes."
"As this matter is not quite In your
line. Captain â that Is, not criminal â I'm
disposed to pay for any trouble," Mr.
Bunton said.
"No trouble at all, sir," the captain re
plied, smiling, and turned to a pile of
papers. In less than a quarter of an
hour there was a ring at the call bell,
and when the captain caught the first
word through the telephone he nodded to
his caller, as If saying, "Here we are.
Quick work, eh?" ;H i"
He did not speak a word through the
instrument, but listened to what seemed
to his caller a long report. Then he said
to Mr. Bunton, "The party you inquire
for is not at home. I can give you his
address,* but I should tell you that it is
not likely that you will find him."
"Why not?" Mr. Bunton asked, in a
sudden fear the captain mentally noted.'
"Perhaps you can tell me that better
than I can tell you. But I don't ask -you
to tell. It's not Harry's habit to leave
his rooms before dark. But Â° this morn-
Ing, a few minutes before the officer
called, he left his rooms. As he reached
the sidewalk a cab drove up. a stylishly
dressed woman got out of It, called to
Harry, who was nearly In a faint at see-
Ing her, they kissed each other, she
nearly dragged him into the cab, and
they drove off. The officer got the story
quickly and easily from a woman named
Bessie Day, living at the same address,
' and who was enough interested to rush
out of the house and run after the cab
until she dropped in a faint I'm sorry
to see that the story distresses you, Mr.
Bunton, but I supposed .you'd want to
know It I don't ask you to tell me what
the case is. but if you care to do so, I'll
do what I can for you."
Isaac Bunton was staring at the speak
er, not half understanding what, he -said
after the words "a stylishly dressed
worfcan." That told him too much!
The entrance of Mr. Bannister Into the
case, which now greatly interested the
Captain, came about through the fact
that the lawyer had a son who was
highly impulsive, and strongly emotional.:
The recovery of Howard Paxton was
rapid; a few days of careful nursing and
rest had him so much restored that the
surgeon said he mighttdo some writing.;-
A. little work, he sald/would do" the pa^ ;

he had contrived to be alone with him,
"I have something; to. say to you."
"So I have seen.-my boy. Â¦ Is it money?
Your allowance has accumulated for a
year now. Don't let your pride bring you
a fall."
"My pride and purse are all right," the
youth answered, smiling. "I told you that
I would prove myself capable of support

"You have, my boy, and I'm proud of
you, rather.- I dare say I'd be so wholly

"You're making fun of me, dad."

George had Jumped to his feet, kissed
his father, rushed Into the adjoining room
and surprised his mother, and sister, In the
same way, tore back to his father,, raised
both hands aloft, and exclaimed.'-"Ger

He told his father the whole Â¦ story of
Howard's misadventure and concluded,
"And now what can we do to punish that

"Meaninsr?" " Â« '
"The policeman." Â¦

â¢"Oh, the sea-food man will suggest you

lawyer -stepped- briskly: to the telephone
and." called up 'police .headquarters.
"Wherever, - the- captain of detectives Is
have him call at once at .the residence of
Caleb . Bannister.'* Â¦ . "Certainly,'- sir." â¢
: Then: he , returned ' to : hii ; chair Â¦ and

/-man who has â¢ been ; dead more ; than . two
years. Harry Lawton- was reported by
nix, "I'm going to dt. .raxion s nouse
Â¦with a paper the doctor forgot." Also the
captain found the Paxtons' servant girl,
and she was sure that Harry Lawton had
not called at the doctor's on the after
noon in question. She was sure, because
the local police had questioned her about'
all of the callers at the house on that
dayâ the day of his deathâ and If Lawton
had been among them she would remem
ber It.
But the present the captain received
from Mr. Bannister for bringing this in
formation was not email or unimportant.
"And now, captain," the lawyer ..Bald,
"we must locate the sea-food man." ; .
"Oh, I'll take that matter Into my own
hand, governor. I've got Bessie Day lo
cated alreadyâ the fools had let her out of
sight!"
"Bessie Day?"
"Yes, sir. A woman in the case. When
there's a woman In the case, wise detec
tives don't look for the man they want;
they keep track of the woman."
"Ah, I see! Captain, I've often urged
you to take up the study of plant life.
You'd enjoy.it. Good day to you."
XXIIâ THE CHASE BEGUN.
Jack had at last secured Grace's defi
nite promise to marry him, and it wa3 his
duty to impart that news to Mr. Ban
nister. Ur. Worthington Sr. and his wife
Had delayed their return; his health did
not Improve as much as was expected by
the physician accompanying them, and a
longer stay had been made in Mediter
ranean ports. But now the return was
definitely announced, and Jack went to
the lawyer to tell him that the will could
be changed as ordered.
"We'll take a little time to explain
things to your father, first," Mr. Ban
nister said with a faint smile. "Perhaps
the fact that the young lady he wanted
you to marry already had a husband may
alter your father\s views on the subject.'*
The young man^Â«tarted. He, certainly,
had not revealed to Mr. Bannister, nor to
any one, what he had learned from Daisy
when she confessed to him that the sea
food man was her husband. Neither had
he heard any gossip which led him to
suppose that the marriage was generally
known. He' had heard in casual small
tali^"that Miss Bunton was on a visit to
her grandfather In the West, but that
statement was accompanied by an "am
biguous giving out," or sign that It was
not accepted as the simple and natural
fact. Was the clever lawyer fishing?
"I do not understand you," he said to
Mr. Bannisterâ and it was the truth, in
one sense.
VI supposed that you know,, from some
thing I learned, that Mr. Bunton's daugh
ter was married." .
Jack, embarrassed, made no reply.'.
â¢'Understand." the lawyer went ' on,
"I'm not trying to learn whether it's a
fact. I know that it is."
"Even if it is," tha young man said, "it
may not alter my father's views as to my
disobedience. I refused to obey his com
mand, when there was no known reason â
If there be one nowâ why I should not ask
the lady to be my wife. My refusal con
' Btltutcd and completed the offense. An
existing husband would not clear me. un
der my father's process of reasoning." '
"We'll see.. I want to ask you a. ques
tion. Jack." ' ,
"I'm attention, sir."
"Do you object to telling me why, one
night several weeks ago, you secured
from the police the address of a peddler
known as the sea-food man?"
"No objection other than that I am not
at liberty to give my reason."
"May I ask another question?"
Â¦ "Fire away, 'â¢' Jack said, smiling'.
"Was your reason in any way related
to our efforts to secure Bunton's mining
lands?"
"Not in the remotest"-^Jack began
lightly, and paused. "In no manner that
I : .was or > am > aware of," he continued
thoughtfully, "or can Imagine now."
"Well, my boy. I'll not bother you. any
more on the subject' There Is something
she did not reply.
"I think that's the party Bessie's been
looking for." the captain muttered, "but
she didn't expect to find her here. Queer.
If wÂ« get our man. It'll be by accident.
But It's always safe to follow the woman
In the case. If they don't get the right
trail themselves, the devil puts them onto
It Just for fun." Then he said aloud to
his companion. "Nice show. Governor."
"Is It?" the lawyer said dryly. "Who
Is that young person singing? ->ha has
quite a manner."
"That party," the captain said, looking
at hl3 programme, "unless I'm mistaken.
Is Mrs. Harry Lawton, alias Marguerite
Boynton." formerly Miss Daisy Bunton."
"Indeed? I'm not a Judge of this form
of art, but I hazard the opinion that she
Is possessed of a high degree of chic."
Daisy heard this same Judgment, dif
ferently expressed, as she left the stage
at the fall of the final curtain. She was
met in the wings by Harry and a bent,
grizzled man in shirt sleeves. She smiled
at her husband, pinched his cheek, and
gave him to carry a light silk cloak she
had worn in the act, and waited for h?m
to throw over her shoulders a \ heavy
wrap, for protection against draughts.
Then she turned to the other man with a
look of eager inquiry. He took both her
hands, and said, ''Well, Miss Boynton.
you've put me out of a Job. You'll not
hear my cross old scolding voice again;
anyway until the next piece."
"Oh, do you mean It!" she exclaimed,
with a beaming face. .
"I'm going back to town to-night," he
answered, smiling. "Tour performance
this afternoon Was as good as I hoped to
see It In six months. You're all
right. If you don't knock Broadway silly,
I miss my guess."
"You dear old dear!" she cried, drawing
down his head and kissing him. Harry
smiled his delight In the scene. "If I
make a hit on Broadway," she continued.
"there'll be a'.blg diamond ring on that
hand you've raised In caution to me so
many times," and she kissed him again.
It was datk. and a raw, cold wind was
blowing when they left the theater, and
Mr. Bannister said to his companion. "I'll
go to a hotel and wait developments. I
feel disinclined to be present at your first
interview with these young people."
The captain laughed. "That's the way
with those who don't have a professional
interest In this business. They are keen
to be In at the death, until the game Is In
sight. But, governor, I'd rather have you
along with me. If the land lays as I've
figured It out we can clear the whole Job
up at the first shake out of the box."
As he spoke he was edging the lawyer
along, for Bessie Day was hurrying to
ward the stage door, and the captain, still
talking to the lawyer, was keeping her la
eight.- '
"Perhaps you are right." Mr. Bannister
replied, moving with the detective, but so
reluctantly that his companion smiled.
At the door of the theater one publlo
carriage stood, and Bessie easily learned
from -the driver that It was waiting to
take Mis* Boynton to her hotel, the ad
dress of which Bessie also learned. She
walked toward it rapidly for a time, then
ran, and then slowed her pace and con
tinued Irresolutely. At last, within a block
of the hotel, she stopped and waited until
a carriage passed her and drove to the
entrance of the hotel. Then Bessie sud
denly started forward, with more deter
mination in her movement, and reached
the hall entrance of the hotel Just as
'Harry came from the office with letters.
Joined Daisy and ascended the stairway.
Bessie followed them and the detective
and lawyer followed bar. -
The first couple went up bat ons flight
of stairs, turned and -entered a private
parlor, where a grata fire burned brightly,
and a table was already set with the
early, light "artist's meal" which Daisy
took Â¦ between performances.

table tor Daisy, when tho door opened
and Bess) a entered. Harry uttered a cry
of dismay and shrank behind his wife.
"Who are you?" Daisy demanded, plac
ing a hand on Harry's arm, where ha
stood behind her, trembling.
Beesla was thinly clad in cheap, poor
stuff, which in design and color made a
pittful attempt at gay bravery; sho was
shivering with cold and hunger and ex
citement, and in tho full stress of her
rage at first confronting tho woman sho
so hated she could not speak.
"Who are you, and what do you want
here?" Daisy repeated. "Can't you speak?
Or shall I send for tho police?"
"No, no!" pleaded Harry, "not the po
liceâno trouble."
Bessie's power of speech was restored
by the sound of Harry's voioe.
"Who am I?" sho cried hoarsely. "Ask
him? He is mine. I want him!"
"You fool!" Daisy ecr earned, and then
she laughed. "You poor fool, he's my
husband!"
"It isn't so! Is It, Harry T Come back
to me, I've got work now. I know that
she stole you away. I'll forgive you."
"But. Bessie," Harry explained, "this Is
my vrlfeâ my real wife, and "
He stopped and all but collapsed, as the
captain of detectives, whom he recog
nized, followed tho lawyer, quietly entered
the room.
"You lie!" Bessie cried, too angry to
notice the new comers. "Sho Is no more
your wife than I amâ not as much."
"Well!" demanded Daisy, rearing her
head with rage at tho sight of tho men.
"Will some cno tell me what this means?
Is this my private room or the public par
lor of the hotel? Harry, send for t"|e ho
tel clerk ,and have this woman and these
men ordered out. Why, Harry! Harry,
darling! What is the matter? Who are
you?" she demanded, turning to tho cap
tain. "Blackmailers, come to help this
creature set money from me?"
She was in an awful rage now, but
gently placed her arm around Harry, and
drew him close to her Bide, turning her
blazing eyes from Bessie to tho men.
"Now. Beesle," the captain said, in a
quiet, cheerful voice, "we'll excuse you
for a little time. Just step outside whero
we can call you If you are needed, and
if we don't need you here, I'll want to see"
you afterward, any way."
As he spoke he smiled, but his eyes
were holding hers sternlj-, and hers
drooped undtr his gaze.
"Yes, captain," she answered faintly,
and then lifting her eyes timidly, .whis
pered beseechingly, "it's no trouble for
Harry, is it. captain? He's always been
straight, captain. He wasn't going to tell
on the officer who struck Mr. Paxton,
Were you, Harry?"
There was a brief, grim smile under
the captain's mustache, then he said,
"You are all right. Bessie, and Harry will
be all right, if ho Is a sensible little man.
You heard mo tell you what to do. Do it."
"Tes. sir. captain. Thank you," sho
eaid, and with a look of hatred at Daisy,
ehe left the room.
Daisy, who had been half supporting
Harry's form, now led him to a sofa,
Â¦where he sat down with a weary sigh, but
smiling, and holding one of her hands.
"Now. DerhaDS. I am to bo told what ex-
few threads holding a paper in
place between the cloth and lining, and
handed the paper to the lawyer. Mr.
Bannister gave It a searching glance, ex
amined tho acknowledgment and signa
ture, draw a long sigh of relief and turn
ing to Daisy said: "Madam, you are quite
right in demanding that your husband
shall not give up a thing of possible value
without some evidence to protect him in
an emergency. Will you bo good enough
to let me uso the writing paper on that
deek for a minute?"
She looked at him with Interest; his
tone and manner, so different from his
comp'anlon's, encouraged her to say, "You
show mo consideration, sir. May I ask "
"I am Caleb Bannister, Mrs. Lawton."
"Oh I I hope you will excuse my rude
ness. I feared that this might be a part
of the trick which onco cruelly separated
me and my husband. He has a very
sensitive nature, and I must stand be
tween him and those who for some reason
sought to part us once, and might do so
again." This wu in her gentlest man
ner, and a very pretty one, too, and as
sho spoke and her confidence grew in the
knowledge of whom ehe addressed, she
began to enjoy tho situation, her own part
in the Interview, its dramatic points. As
the lawyer sat at the desk and wrote
she returned to Harry and said soothing
ly: "It's not that old false charge, Harry,
dear; not the trick they separated us by
before. Mr. Bannister Is a gentleman,
sweetheart. He won't do us any harm.
Don't bo frightened, darling; I'll see that
' you're protected in giving up the paper
whatever It is."
"Now, Mr. Lawton," Mr. Bannister said
after a few minutes' writing at the desk,
"I'll give you a receipt for this paper,
when you havo signed here." Harry, won
derfully revived by his wife's words and
by being celled "Mr. Lawton" by tho
great lawyer, stepped over to the desk
briskly. "You see," said Mr. Bannister,
"this -is 'a simple statement that a paper
you havo voluntarily surrendered to me
was .given to you by the party men
tioned to deliver as set forth here, and
that through an oversight you neglected
to deliver it tnen; that it has remained
in your possession. continuously since, un
altered in any manner. A mere statement
of tho facts, you see."
Harry, with a great air of importance,
smiled, and blinked wisely, as he attend
ed to the lawyer's words, signed where
directed and took the receipt for the pa
per, as if concluding a very satisfactory
business transaction. Mr. Bannister took
his hat and looked inquiringly at the of
ficer. Harry was whispering to Daisy,
who nodded her head approvingly, when
he said aloud, "Gents, we'd like you to
stay and have dinner with us. A Email
bottle and a bird. Eh, captain?"
"Delighted!" answered the detective,
with prompt cheerfulness. "Governor?"
"I should like to reach the general post
office before it closesâ It is some minutes
of 6 yet. And I have somo telegraphing
to do. You remain, captain, and meet me
at the train."
He bowed gravely to Daisy and left the
room. In tho hall he stopped and pressed
his hands to nis temples. "If I had not
seen it â actually seen Itâ I could not be
convinced. And I thought I knew human
some use of tha deed If he had saved it
from the wreck. Â¦ ,
"No," he â¢ thought; "if Harry had
the deed he would have ap
proached me, or Howard . Paxlon.
with an offer to produce it for a re
ward." This reasoning encouraged him
very much. Its faultlness, the fact that
he did not consider Harry's . cowardice,
would havo been seen by any reasoner
not so desperately Intent upon proving
his own safety. The time had arrived
when .ho must prove that he was both
justified and secure in making, an offer to
sell the land. So his decision met his
necessities. Having determined to play
his hand as fate had dealt it to him he
would play it boldly. Instead of ' calling
upon Mr*. Bannister he sent the lawyer a
note asking him to call, and he was glad
he had shown that evidence of confidence,
when he received a polite reply, naming a
time when the lawyer would call, "if it
suited Mr. Bunton's convenience."
The interview was a pleasant surprise
to Bunton. Mr. Bannister expressed his
satisfaction that the prolonged negotia
tions promised to come to a speedy end.
"You've mentioned tho very point In
volved," Mr. Bunton said briskly. '."Speed.
Now that I've made up my mind to sell
the property I want to have the business
ended am soon as possible." \ -
They discussed the details. The mat
ter of price no longer stood between
them. Mr. Bannister admitted that tho
recent exploration of the land had justi
fied Mr. Bunton's view, of its value. The
deal involved was so large, the necessity
of an assured supper of ore so admit
tedly great, ths peril to th'elr position,
if the Bunton land fell into the hands ot
a rival, so manifest, he. would not dis
pute the price.
ThLi was giving away his hand so free
ly that Bunton looked at the speaker to
see if he could divine a tricky Intention.
But the lawyer's expreaslonless face re
vealed nothing.
"I feel justified In saying," Mr. Ban
nister concluded on this point,- "that my
principals will agree to tho figure, or
one substantially that. A hundred thou
sand dollars one way or the other will
not keep us apart on the price, eh?"
"Certainly not," the other replied, and
he tried to repress the great sigh of re
lief with which he heard the words." As
to the manner of payment there was
some discussion. Mr. Bunton wanted the
greater part cash, the lesser part stock
and bonds of the proposed company; Mr.
Bannister asserted that the greater part
should be paid In the company's securi
ties, but again he was disposed to think
that Mr. Bunton's wishes would be met in
that respect also. The question of the time
of transfer brought them to a hitch. Bun
ton said thAt the title of the land had
been so often, and thoroughly examined
of late, the transfer should be concluded
after another merely perfunctory search
of the title.
"No," the lawyer responded, slowly and
thoughtfully, "that will not. do In this
case. If we were considering an ordinary
transaction it might do. But, as the at
torney for the intending purchasers, 1
must insist, in a case of this magnitude,
that a thorough and extended search, by
experts, must be made before we prt>-
for months, was a relief. It might have
beenâ oh, God! that, other thought had
been such a burden of dread that to hear
this fact was a Joy. < Daisy might suc
ceed. Women had . gone from a life as
sheltered as hers and succeeded and been
respected. In the exposed life of the
theater. So, gradually, in. the deep gloom
of her sorrow and misgivings /about her
husband, Mrs. Bunton came to think of
Daisy as happily removed from tho gen
eral worry and care with which her own
life was beset. Daisy wrote to â¢ her
mother secretly, sending many favorable
newspaper notices of Marguerite Boyn
ton: and- as these notices grew in im
portance the mother's pride was aroused,
and she looked forward to seeing Daisy
perform, as her daughter urged that sho
must, when the troupe neared New York.
She did not tell her husband. of Daisy's
whereabouts. He had, after the first,
seemed not to want to know. where his
daughter and son-in-law were. She did
not even tell her husband when she
heard from Daisy that she had had a
"funny experience." A lawyer had come
and got from Harry a paper that her
father gave him to deliver more, than
two vears ago and which the dear, care
ful fellow had kept so well all the time
he was In such trouble that the lawyer
found It to be all right. Mrs. Bunton
would have told her husband of this had
he not seemed to suffer at any chance
reference to Harry.
Isaac had another cause for worry
just at that time. His father had seen,
in the AVhite River Advocate, the article
ropied from the New York paper about
the cause of delay In the Iron. combine
proceedings. He wrote to Isaa^c about
it. brt was not satisfied with the reply.
The White River papers frequently had
stories about the social and financial
triumphs of Isaac Bunton. and in this
wf y the old farmer-banker had learned
much to worry him about his son. He
wrote that the New York affairs of the
bank required attention and that he
would make that an excuse to visit his
son.
Isaac's- exposition of his financial af
fairs did not satisfy his father.
"Even if you sell the land, Isaac." the
market '11 have to go your way to let
you draw out without using up a lot of
the purchase price, large as it is."
"But, father, when I've sold this to
the Worthington interest the market, or
at least the shares I'm interested In, will
probably advance rapidly."
"Do you mean that they are depress
ing y^ur holdings to force you to sell the
land?"
"That's the judgment of. many shrewd
operators; the crowd I train with. The
stocks we are known to fancy have
Kilned strength, just on the rumor that
I'm going to let go of tne land, at l?st.
The deal will probably be. closed to
day, ns I have a. note from Mr. Bannister
that ho will call to-day. I'm glad that
you'll be at my office to meet him and
be In at the end â It will be a newspaper
sensation."
Mr. Bannister showed some surprise,
after being introduced t > the elder Bun
ton, and talking with him for a time on
Western affairs, that the younger man
did not suggest retiring 10 the inner of
fice for their conference. At last he said,
lawyer In the case was very reticent,
but did not deny that Mr. Bunton. had
parted with the land); her beauty, her
stage appearanceâ a suggestion of Car
mencita and Cleo.de Merodoâ wero writ
ten ofvwith enthusiasm; and she was
envied, by ten thousand good women.
And her mother sat in her dressing-room
all of one evening frightened, ashamed,
stunned; while Harry hovered about,
smiling in the ecstasy of pride and Joy.
XXVIâ A LETTER OF MARK.
On one of those February days whose
deceit we forgive for their beauty, when
New York, with unfailing faith, each
year believes winter vanished and
spring triumphantâ and for its faith takes
cold in its forgetful head â on such a day
Howard Paxton turned into tho cavern
ous entrance to tho Brooklyn bridge, in
tending to mount therefrom to the Third
avenue Elevated. His frank smile and
brisk, buoyant step wero not wholly duo
to his delight in the fair false promise
mado by soft sky and warm sun; ho was
rejoicing In a promise as bright but more
real, and was hurrying home to share
with Grace the lightness of his heart.
"When she received that check for fifty
dollars for her carpet design she wanted
to do large and ' strange things to cele
brate," he was saying to himself. "It
took all of my etern brotherly influence
to dissuade her from a revel of tea and
jam, to say nothing of insinuating cake,
candy and all vain vanities. Sho would
have guests to share our realized dream
of riches! A serving maid sent in for the
evening to emphasize our grandeur and
advertise our splendor! But my reason
ing prevailed and sho consented to the
purchase of a spring wrap and necessary
gloves. But now! Now revel and merri
ment! Guests and ale and sausages, and
gaiety and gaiters and gas-stove cooking
beyond the dreams of Lucullus!"
These riotous Imaginings were pro
moted by an interview Howard had
Just had. The identity ho had
concealed under his pen names had be
come known to several of the editors to
whom he had sold matter. The discovery
had affected them differently. Some had
dropped his work indignantly; some had
laughed at the deception and continued
to use his contributions under his pen
names, and one had sent him a note to
call and talk the subject over. This edi
tor, whom he had Just left, had said:
"I think that a lot depends upon the place
where your work is used, whether It Is
hurt by your own name. Now, I've been
thinking that not one of our readers out
of a thousand ever saw your name In
the Chronicle, but they did see it often
while you were known as tho White
River Advocate Man, and would like to
see It again. In short, we've concluded
that, so far as our publications are con
cerned, your own name has a value and
we v.*?.nt to uso it."
There were many things about tho busi
ness of his profession of which Howard
was ignorant when he first went to New
York, but which ho had learned by paln-
bo out of trouble, I'm further in tne
woods than ever beforo In my life. Grace
and I are the owners of the sensational
mining lands I Please, Worthington, sit
down here and tell me as much as you
knowâ or tell me until I wake up."
Jack told tho story to his astonished
and delighted audience. Ho know It pret
ty well, for his father's return had made
it necessaryâ or expedientâ that both tho
Worthingtons should be acquainted with
tho situation. Mr. Bannister had Im
posed secrecy upon Jack until tho ulti
mate legal safeguard had boen estab
lishes around tho Paxton title to the
land; and that had not been done to tha
final satisfaction of the cautious old law
yer until that day. Mr. Bannister, hearing
from George and Madgeâ so Jack suggest
ed in conclusionâ where they , were to
spend tho evening, had given tho letter to
George to deliver, that tho occasion
might not lack any causa for celebration
tho lawyer could supply.
Jack took plenty of tlma to toll his
story, and so dawnings of what it all
meant began to light up Howard's con
fused understanding. When Jack finished
Howard's eyes turned to Madge, but sho
suddenly became crimson and frightened
and ran to her coffee urn. and only looked
up to dart a glance of intense scorn at
her brother when he laughed at her and
drew attention to her cheeks and eyes.
XXVII-MARRYINQ THB LAND.
It was not until ho had had many In
terviews with Mr. Bannister and the law
yer from Whlta River that Howard re
alized the story Jack Â¦Worthington had
told him. Then ho began to regret that
it was true. Than, for Grace's sake, he
was glad that it was. Anyway ho should
go on with his work. There was a stigma,
on his nameâ undeserved, trot thereâ and
he would work as if 'this good fortune
had never come, until that stigma was
wholly removed. Mr. Bannister mildly
suggested that making a lw*Â« check
good by signing his own name to it was,
by way of removing a stigma, a better
process than making a poem sell by sign-
Ing his own nama to Itâ as this world
goes. Thon Howard said tha thing
bothered him. Ha knew nothing about
mining, and probably could not learn.
His work was affected already by thought
of mines and mining lands. Mr. Ban
nister had a way out of that trouble:
sell tho land. . Tha very thought was a
relief to Howard, and the transaction
went forward, but without speed. IX
dragged. Then Jack went to his father,
and asked, as a dutiful son should. If ho
had any objections to welcoming Into tho
Worthington family, as a daughter-in
law. Miss Paxton, sister of the gentleman
from whom they were trying to buy the
Iron lands. Jack thought the marriage
would, expodlto tha land sale tor which
his father was anxious. In reply tho
elder Worthington mado tho only humor
ous remark of his life. "My son." ho
Bai<l to Jack, "your father is a wiso
oldster, after all. I started out to have
you marry that land, and by Georgo you
end up by marrying it. Eh?"
He repeated that joko. not often, but
cuse there Is for this Intrusion," she said,
turning Instinctively to Mr. Bannister, as
the one she must look to for considera
tion.
"Mrs. Lawton." he said gravely, "our
visit Is In no way related to the \islt of
tho young woman who has Just left here.
Wo coma to make Bome Inquiries of your
husband which can be conducted briefly,
and without distressing you, I sincerely
hope." He glanced at the captain, who
eaid, in a tone of friendly confidence,
"Harry, all wo want Is that deed you for
got to deliver to Dr. Pax ton two years
ago last October, and which such a care
ful business man as you would not lose,
or part with, except to the right
party. Ah! I see that I'm right. It al
ways pleases me to start right, for then,
as the fellow In the book saysâ or was
It a play?â you can go ahead."
The captain had lengthened his dis
course, only because he saw that Harry
was speechless with fright, and he want
ed to give him time to recover.
Daisy had listened to the officer with
keen attention. "Is this eo, Harry?" she
asked. "Have you such a paper?"
The poor fellow's teeth were chattering
behind his smile, and he looked at her
plteously, but could not answer.
"Perhaps I can refresh his memory, as
the lawyers say." the officer continued,
with unabated good nature. "When you
left Mr. Bunton's office that day'â
Harry shook so at these words that
Daisy drew his head to her side, and pet
ted Itâ "you told Dan Mannixâ nice chap.
Dan; sent his regards to youâ that you
were going to Dr. Paxton's to deliver a
paper. Having to meet the present Mrs.
Lawton on that very self-same day, you
overlooked the errand to the doctor'sâ
as the Paxtons' servant girl was telling
mo the other day. Nice girl, that Then
when you reached New York, with that
blood-stained overcoat, which Katie
mended for you, she sewed up a paper In
the lining for you. And Katie's a very
respectable woman, too," he added, turn-
Ing to Mr. Bannister, as if it was a mat
ter of importance. Ho .was watching
Harry closely as he continued to the law
yer, "a decent woman. I was talking to
her tho other day. Keeps a respectable
boarding-house. Bui, sir, It's queer the
way women like her remember some
thingsâ like they happened yesterday,
when they may have happened as long
ago as when Harry first came to town.
"For heaven's sake, stop that chat
ter!" Daisy exclaimed, turning upon tho
officer savagely. "What is it, Harry?
Sweetheart, darling! I sha'n't let them
hurt you. Have you grft the thing they
want?"
He muttered something about not
wanting to give it to tho wrong people
and get into more trouble. Then Daisy
turned to the men and said haughtily,
"I don't know who you are, or what
right you have to ask my husband to
give you anything. This sounds like
some sort of blackmailing scheme, and
I'll not let him give you anything until
I've seen ray lawyer. I bid you good
evening, gentlemen."
This was said in a superb manner, and
the detective nodded his head in approval
of It, but at the same time it was wear-
Ing on his patience. "As you please.
madam," he said. "You don't know who
I am. to bo sure, but Harry does, and he
knows what a warrant of arrest and
extradition looks like."
At the mention of such a remarkable
document Mr. Bannister glanced at the
detective and saw him draw from an In
side pocket of bis coat a legal looking
paper, which was tho lease of his Har
lem flat he had chanced to havo renewed
that day. At sight of It Harry burled
his face In his hands and wept He
called bis wife's name and she bent over
him to catch his whispered words.
Then she went to a trunk In a corner
of the room and took from tt an old
overcoat, which she tossed to* the de
tective. The latter quickly and lightly
ran his fingers over the garment, opened
a eeam with his pocket knife, cut a
nature!"
At the head of the stairs he met
Bessie. "Is It true, sir, that they are
married T' she asked.
"Ah. you are the young: woman Yen.
I advise you to go home."
She was weeping. "I love him! Must
I give him up? I've got work, now.
Must I give him up?
"I should suppose so," tho lawyer
sa!d. and again he made the unusual
motion of putting his hands to his tem
ple?. "Are you in need?"
"Won't this relieve your â will you
tnke this?" and he handed her a bank
bill, which she took.
."But Harry's in no trouble, sir,Â«lf you
please, is he, sir?"
"No other trouble than Mrs. Harry,"
the lawyer said, hurrying down the
stairs.
A few minutes later he had sent tho
deed in a registered package to Howard
Paxton's lawyer in White River and
telegraphed him of the fact, with di
rections to have it recorded without de
lay.
XXV-A GOOD DEED.
"Dear Mammaâ I've found Harry. I al
ways felt that he was not dead, and that
I should find him again. He has suffered
much, but he is happy now. I forgive
papa, now that I have found Harry. Do
not worry about me. I am going to be an
actress. There is no use telling people,
until I succeed. I shall succeed. I shall
be famous, and earn money for Harry
and, myself. If that was what papa
feared, he need not fear any more. I
shall earn all the money Harry wants,
without asking papa for any. I have ta
ken all my jewelry, but nothing else. Af
fectionately, DAISY.
"P. S. â I am all right, so don't you
worry a bit. Tell folks, If they ask, that
I'm visiting grandpa. â¢ D."
Thla was the letter that Mrs. Bunton,
her sad face tear-swollen, gave to her
husband when he returned home, after
learning at police headquarters that
Harry Lawton had gone away from his
room with a sty-Hshly dressed woman.
When he had wearily read the letter his
wife looked at him and said, "You knew
it, Isaac?"
"Yes, Carrie." .
"Do >u*i want to tell mo what you
know, Isaac>*
He was sitting bowed over a table, and
Shook his head in Mswer to her question.
After a silence, bro.Vn only by his deep,
troubled breathing, e,-id her sighs, she,
said, "Can we not go home now?"
He raided his heat/ and looked at his
wife for a time, but as if he did not see
her, then replied, "Not now, dear. Per
haps after a while. Iâ I can't, explain
now. You won't ask me now, Carrie?"
"No, dear. But if there is any other
trouble, won't you tell me? It seems as
if there was somethingâ I don't know
something awful, Isaac, that's threaten
ing us."
He forced himself to smile, and said
with an effort, "Nonsense, Carrie! I'm
bothered by this, but we'll come out ail
right."
But things would not come all right.
He no longer made a pretense of playing
a game of skill in Wall street, but gam
bled in stocks with a dice thrower's in
fatuation and desperation. . Luck seldom
favored him, and at last a crisis came
when he had to realize on his only un
pledged assetâ the mining land! Beforo
he made up his mind to take that step ho
considered long the chances agaliÂ»t him
in this last throw of the dice. He con
vinced himself, or said to himself that
he was convinced, that he had been fool
ish to suppose that the evidence of Dr.
Paxton's ownership was not destroyed.
Harry had escaped, to be sure.. but his
own eyes furnished the evidence that the
valise Harry carried was wholly de
stroyed. Now that he had some notion of
the life of the sea-food man, he argued
that such a wretched existence would
have surely prompted Harry to make
ceed further than to a written agreement
as to terms."
"And that will take a couple of weeks,
I suppose," Bunton said, with a show of
impatience.
"A couple of months would be nearer
the time. I think."
"The time is long. It will inconvenience
me in certain plans I have made."
"I regret that. I can only promise to
expedite my inquiries as to your capacity
to jfive title."
"My capacity, sir!" Bunton's heart beat
fast. "
"It is an almost obsolete phraseâ but I
am an old-fashioned lawyer.".
"In the meantime I may lose an equally
good chance to sell." . i
"We will deposit $100,000, with our agree
ment, in escrow, to be forfeited to you if
we fail to complete a purchaseâ when it
is proved that you can give a good title."
Again Bunton started.^ He could not help
it, though he had tried to prepare himself
to hear Just such words. Was it a sharp
rlaw, suddenly, darted out and with
drawn, that had pricked him? No, the
heavy, well-colored face of the lawyer
suggested bovine rather than feline char,
acterlsties.
"Two months seems an unreasonable
time."
"We wish to be reasonable, but matters
of s>uch importance as are Involved In our
modern combining of great Interests de
mand searching investigation in every di
rection that prudence and experience sug
gest, lest some incurable flaw be discov
ered when it is too late to apply an hon
est remedy."
"Oh, of course!"
"And naturally, Mr. Bunton, you and I
are equally desirous that the first steps in
this transaction shall be s*o fair and open
that there- shall be nothing to conceal
from public scrutinyâ so far as you and I
are concerned."
"Naturally, sir." Isaac Bunton tried to
say this without first clearing his throat,
but he could not. He inwardly cursed
that his voice was hoarse, and boldly re
peated. "Naturally, sir; naturally." "This
lawyer of great reputation seems to be a
prosy, rather thick-witted fellow," Bun
ton said to himself, "and is incapable of
playing with me, as his words In the
mouth of a bpigjtiter man might suggest.
Nothing to fear here!"
"Naturally, Mr. Bunton. So I Bhall pro
ceed in my way. hastening matters aa far
as seems prudent, an3 when I am satis
fied that the title you offer is perfect I
ehall communicate."
"The sooner the better," Bunton nald
hastily, beginning to tire of the lawyer's
slow talk, that had so many phrases sug
pesting' doubt where there could be no
doubt. 1
But could there be a doubt? Was the
lawyer suspicious as well as cautious?
Had he not % needlessly repeated those
phrases that made the hearer start; had
he not laid meaning emphasis upon them?
These questions would not leave his mind,
and, when the morning after the Interview
with the lawyer he saw in the Chronicle.
In an article on the iron combine, a sug
gestion that proceedings were dragging
because of a possible flaw in thfe title of
one of the undeveloped properties in
volved, he was possessed by a' sudden
fear and kept his paper In front of . his
face that his wife, might not see him, for
he thought he must be very paleâ he was
so cold! " . -
But the wife knew-knew that Isaac
was in more trouble than ever before
and that now; for. the first time in their
llyes together, it was a trouble he could
not tell her. So she only grieved
silently for him; keeping up, : for he
seemed to wish it, their show of enter
taining and being entertainedâ of living
a society, life! Arid her heart broken for
him! For himrnot for -Daisy. ' â¢-
The shock of hearing ! that Harry : wa3
alive was not an unpleasant one to Mrs.
Bunton; nor was she deeply grieved that
Daisy had gone into the theater for a
career. That, as a solution" of the mys
tery of her daughter's unwatched hours
"Shall we go inside ar.d take up the
land matter?"
"We shall not be disturbed here," Isoac
replied.
"And will your father remain?" the
lawyer asked.
"Certainly."
Mr. Bannister was silent for as much as
half a minute, looking at the old farmer,
and Isaac saw the look and felt as-, a
prisoner must \f eel when he watches h
Jury return from their deliberations, and
sees "Guilty!" written on every stern
face. He would have liked to make soms
excuse to ask his father' to retire, but
he cou'.d not ppeak.
"Very well," the lawyer said slowly
and calmly. "Mr. Bunton" â he turned his
eyes on Isaacâ "can you give me a better
deed for the land than 'the one you pave
to Dr.' Paxton. iwo yeara ago last Octo
ber. I refer to the deed this telegram
reports as having been recorded by How
aid Paxton's attorney, In AVhite River,
yesterday?"
Isaac moistened his lips several times
before he answered, but when at last ho
did speak it was in a quiet and natural
tone: "No, sir, I cannot," he said.
His father rose, staggered, and would
have fallen had not Mr. Bannister caught
him. Â«
| "What does this mean, Isaac, my son?"
the old man whispered faintly.
Isaac went to his father, put his arm
around him, and led him to a chair. "I'll
tfll you everything, father. Don't go,
Mr. Bannister. I'd rather-you heard."
He sat with one hand shading hla eyes,
the other idly fingering his watch chain,
his head bent, but still speaking In ; a
quiet voice. He told the whole story; not
Bhleldlng or excusing himself much ex
cept when he safd that he intended to
share with Howard, somehow; tell him
that his father had an Interest in the
land. At the end h e looked up, and ask.^d
the lawyer, "Do you want me to tell th's
to any one else â the law officers?"
Mr. Bannister looked at the father, saw
th4 unheeded tears course slowly down
his quivering face, the daze of shame aid
grief in his eyes," and then he said, as if
he had not heard the question, but firmly
and with intention. "I am sorryâ very
sorry for you, Mr. Buntym; and if I can
be of any heia to you in straightening
out affairs, my services are at your com
mand."
He had, not looked at either as he
spoke, and no listener could have told
whether he addressed father or son. But
the father replied, "God knows, sir, that
we have no right to aBk your helpâ any
man's. I have never asked help of any
man before, butâ"
The old man's voice faltered and broke,
but his eyes looked steadily at the law
yer. ' , ' Â¦
They worked over, books and accounts
until far Into the night: and for many
days father and son went on with the
sorry task of settling the son's affairs, al
ways advised by Mr. Bannister. Tne
elder Bunton had at once placed all his
property at the lawyer's disposal, making
no complaint when it seemed that not
only all the earnings of his lifetime 'of
thrift would be sacrificed; but the inher
ited farm, as well. . .â¢.'..'.
"But I'ii save that farm for the old
man," Mr. Bannister res6lved, "if I have
to make Wall street pay for it.". And he
didâ just the old farm and. the old home
stead: not , any other thing* of value. .
"Now, ylsaac," the old man said, with
no tone of reproach in his voice, "we'll
go back to the farm and begin life over
again." . ; '. Â¦.â¢ -. â¢ Â¦ ' - '
Before they left Mrs. Bunton. said that
she was going away over. one night and
they. did not ask. her whero. They knew
it was to see Daisy, but her name was
never mentioned now. â¢..::#*,
â¢ All one evening Mrs. , Bunton* sat in
Daisy's dressing-room. The , date had
been announced : for . her* appearance in
New York ; : her \ identity was â¢ disclosed ;
the Chronicle was in- Us element; ;she
was - pictured ;"? as the daughter of the
Western, millionaire, Isaac Bunton, ..who
had Just' sold some mining' land to the
iron combine at a startling . figure (the
ful experience since them. He knew that
this editor's use of his name would help
its value as much as the Chronicle's use
of it had injured it. and he was rejoic
ing over that thought as he turned into
the bridge entrance, promising himself
the pleasure of giving Grace a treat.
It was a notable supper at the Paxtons"
apartments that evening. Besides the host
and hostess George Bannister and his
happy fiancee, Mrs. Carr and George's
sister Madge and Mr. Jack Worthington
were present. And the menu was as good
as the company. Grace made Welsh rab
bit and Gertrude chocolate fudge. Jack
cut bread for the sandwiches and George
ground a paste of sardines for the same;
Howard presided over the store of bottled
beer for the men and Madge over the cof
fee urn for the ladles. George Bannister
made no less than a score of speeches
over the happy event they celebrated, the
passing of the eclipse of Howard's name;
that writer himself read a poem humor
ously describing the same passing of a
shadow; Gertrude burned the fudge and
her fingers at a chance allusion to Brook
lyn; and Madge, a wild pleasure of secret
joy in her eyes, was silently observant of
all, but now and then looked In impa
tience at her brother. George caught one
of those looks, blushed guiltily and drew
a sealed letter from his pocket and gave
it Ltd Jack, saying, "Father told me to
hand you this, but I forgot, until Madge's
reproving eyes reminded me. She must
know what it's about; I don't."
Jack took the letter, glanced at it, laid
It down hastily and went to Grace. He
was deeply in earnest and spoke to her in
low eager tones, so the others were dis
. creetly busy and noisy about their occu
pations. "Oh, George!" said Worthing
ton, glancing over his shoulder a moment,
"there's something in that letter about
you. Better read it."
Madge's wild eyes were dancing, now,
and she watched her brother Intently.
George ran his eyes down the letter un
til he came to his own name, and read,
"Say to George that the Consolidated
Chemical Limited goes into the hands of
a receiver to-morrow. It is an irretriev
able failure."
Having read these words George dashed
the letter- to the table, rushed to Ger
trude and exclaimed, "Love moon of my
heart's night! Guiding star of my soul's
flight! Anchor of my storm swept life!
The shadows 'of earth, the mists of
heaven are dissolved and banished, and
unending sunlight plays and dances over
the course ofâ ofâ Gertie, that damn
Chemical Consolidated . is bust, your
mother must admit that my father was
all right, and keep her promise. We
marry!" He turned to the startled com
pany and repeated in a voice of rapture,
"We marry!"
He caught sight of his ' sister's laugh
, Ing face, stopped, went to her, and salO,
"Madge, you knew this! Father told you,
and you have been heartless enough to
keep from your brother for. hours tEe
knowledge that the cause of difference
that has kept two hearts apartâ Madge,
how could | you!" Ho caught Madgo
around the waist, and drew her over to
Jhis blushing and laughing sweetheart to

PUNISHMENT OF CHILDREN-Fourth TalK
Â¦ * ",'Â¦*Â¦
will frequently be seen that the parent and not the child is deserving
of the punishment.
When possible punishment should be natural. For, example: If a
boy uses his. knife to cut the furniture he should be deprived of thp
knife. Punishments which are natural follow as the results of actions
and are always powerful as correctives. This is the fundamental char
acteristic of divine punishment.
Punishnjents should ndi destroy self-respect. Such as do are fiend
ish. The great object of moral training is to develop self-control and
self-respect, not destroy them.
Punishments should be inflicted in kindness. By word and man
ner the parents should show that it is an unpleasant task. Nothing
will cause the lesson to sink more deeply and be remembered longer.
There arc some methods of punishment frequently used, yet for
which no parent worthy of the name would say a word in defense.
They are never right under any condition. Among' those of more fre
quent use may be mentioned the following: Blows upon the head,
boxing op pulling of ears, violent shaking, calling of names, sarcasm,
scolding, 'nagging, threats, solitary confinement.
Displeasure of parents is one valuable punishment. Other things
being. equal, "the greater the love between the. child and parent, the
greater the effect of the expressed displeasure* Like the parents, the
child cares little for the criticism of enemies and much for the unkind
words from those whom he loves. Properly used, the heart of almost
every child will respond to it and inwardly resolve to do better. \
One of the most effectual kinds of punishment, with most children,
is that of depriving. them of seme privilege. If, in place of some ex
pected pleasure, the child is required to sit down and think over the
cause of the loss, he will come to the conclusion that it does not pay
to lose a great pleasure for a small one. Â¦
The keeping of some record of a child's shortcomings may also be
made use of with good effect, with most children. ' This record may be
merely a number of marks made when the child fails to do as he should.
When it is found that a number willmcan certain punishment and that
by especially praiseworthy conduct some marks can be removed it is
remarkable how great an influence this device will have upon conduct.
. . Punishment should always be upon the fleshy parts op the body
with a switch, strap, piece of small rubber, hose or similar instrument,
which cannot inflict such injury as the parent may regret for years to
come. " Â¦ ,- â¢ : ' Â¦Â¦'Â¦':.â¢ â¢.Â¦ -.Â¦-Â¦-Â¦â¢
Parents should take great care -lest they inflict corporal punish
ment in such a wav as to make it appear that they are vindictive or
"'trying to get even." '. \, Y , - Â¦Â¦:
.':'Â¦- The blows shouM not be more frequent than once or twice each
minute. If this'is done, and the strokes interspersed by such expres
sions and admonitions s s will prove that the parent desires only the
good cf, the child, the punishment will' be very effective. The loving
kindness "may have failed: the harsh application of the rod may not
give the deÂ«ired results, but the combination of the two will surely
never be forgotten and is almost certain' to produce the desired result.
than in the preceding century. Compare the national feeling disclosed
in the Paston Letters of the middle of the fifteenth century with that
displayed in the writings of a Shakespeare or a Raleigh. The letters
are mostly the production of agitated times, when the crown of Eng
land was continually at stake.nevertheless there is not a gleam of pub
lic spirit in them from one end to the other. The nation clearly needed
an ideal, and when this came in the shape of conquest and discovery
and wealth and self-respect and weight in the annals of Europe, and
everything that we now call imperialistic, it raised the national charac :
ter to a height which a contemporary of the Pastons would have
deemed incredible.

< 0kbP ebb=b &&M tory, and very frequently the control of, and con
sequently the responsibility for, numerous peoples
of an inferior grade of civilization. The imperialistic sentimenÂ£ may
be defined -as that feeling of complacency with which the citizen of
Â«uch a dominant nation regards the fact that his country counts for
tnnch in the affairs of the world. So long as the question is contem
plated from this abstract point of view it seems extraordinary that there
should be any difference of opinion upon the subject The proposition
that it is better to be the citizen of a great country than of a small one
seems as obvious to common sense as the proposition that it is better
to occupy a higher than an inferior position in society. When, however,
we descend from the region of idea to that of fact, we find that the
assertion of an imperial position is associated with many dangers and
inconveniences which may well lead a cautious statesman to" question
its expediency. With this aspect of the matter our inquiry is not con
cerned, but on account of the confusion continually arising between
imperialism and patriotism it is necessary to point out that the propo
sition that imperialism, however majestic in the world of ideas, is in
jurious in the sphere of material interest is one which may conceivably
be held by a good patriot Every imperialist is necessarily a patriot, j
but every patriot is not necessarily an imperialist On the other hand
it is easy to show that some of the charges brought against imperial
ism, as an influence detrimental to the national character,* arise from
confounding it with the general sentiment of patriotism. ;
Rowdyism Not Imperialism.
Such charges are bejt illustrated by concrete examples. We shall
therefore instance two phenomena of recent occurrence, justly consid
ered by reflecting men of all parties as discouraging signs of the times.
One is the foolish and undignified character of the popular rejoicings
over important successes, which has enriched or disfigured the lan
guage with the term "mafficking." The other is the systematic, break
ing up of public meetings by those to whom the opinions of the con
veners were distasteful, as great an offense against the foundations of,
British liberty as it is possible to commit These incidents were
charged upon imperialism, because the majority of those concerned
would have called themselves imperialists, but they had no more neces
sary connection with imperialism than with any other phase of public
opinion. They were outbreaks of an ill-regulated patriotism, which
might just as easily have, been maqifested on the other side had this
been numerically stronger than it wax. An imperialist has not, as
such, any more inclination than a member of the Peace Society to dis
turb a public meeting.. Either may misconduct himself in this man
ner if he is naturally akssionate and intolerant, and it is to be feared
that the only absolute^uarantee for good behavior is that he should
feel himself in a small minority or be aware that transgression will ex
pose him to the stern rebuke of public opinion.
We must, therefore, in any inquiry as to the influence of imperial
ism upon nstional character distinguish between patriotism, or love
of country, a sentiment liable to abuse; but indispensable to the exist
ence of the very smallest state, and imperialism, or that feeling of
patriotic pride which comes with expanded dominion, which could
therefore hr.vc had no existence before this dominion was acquired,
and whiÂ£h, in the event of its disappearance, must itself pass away,
even though the patriotic sentiment from which it was developed
should remain unimpaired. Tbe, question is: Was the national charac
ter exalted by its manifestation while circumstances permitted? '- And
is it impoverished by its withdrawal? 'â¢Â»â¢*'-Â¦- Â¦' :'.'
The conclusion of reasoncrs. nevertheless, wt>uld be of little value
if they were refuted by the testimony of history. But the voice of his
tory is entirely conclusive as to the ennobling influence which the pos
session and the sentiment of power may exercise upon the national
life. The st6ry of Rome portrays a long course of education in public
morality, due to the development of imperialistic sentiment The age
cf Roman conquest under the republic is one of undisguised rapacity.
The age of Roman administration under the empire, until the irrup
tions of the barbarians, is one of order, and justice and general content,
the public weal munificently promoted. ;the pax Romana everywhere.
It is not meant that the genius of Rome was other than imperialistic
even under the republic, but that the imperial training was. imperfect.
It was only by governing that the Romans could learn to govern. An
equally strong instance of the value of imperialistic conceptions to a
nation is afforded by memorable eras in our own annals. There never
was a period in our history when the imperial spirit was more active
than during the reign of Elizabeth, or one "in which it was more inert
fRIMARILY there must be some punishment for
wrongdoing. But for this there could be no gov
ernment either in the state, or in the family, upon
which the existence of the state depends.
There are many who say that a child should
never be punished. Most of these mean that the
-, ? -,Â£ child should not be whipped. They have in mind
_ JJL the brutal treatment of children. Some may really
mean that they think a child should never be punished in any way.
This class is generally composed of those who have had little or no
experience in the management of their own children or of the children
of others. . .
In the divine economy it has seemed necessary to provide punish
ment for wrongdoing. Does it not appear senseless for.' mortals to at
tempt to improve upon his methods? While some punishment seems
absolutely necessarv, too great care cannot be taken by parents in order
that their mode of punishment may be such as will reach the desired
end without any of the evil consequences which are sure to follow in
judicious or ill-considered punishment. â¢
The one great object which justifies a parent's punishing a child
is the honest desire to reform the child and to lead him to do : what is
right. In every case of doubt the parent should ask himself the ques
tion, "Is this the best way to influence my child to do better?"
Another legitimate object of punishment is found in the fact that if
properly administered it condemns the wrong and upholds what is
right. i
If there are several children in the family, another very important
object of punishment is its effect in deterring all from doing wrong.
Punishment may be inflicted upon one child in such a way as to make
it unnecessary to punish other children for similar offenses., Happy the
child who lives in a family where the parent makes such use of it.
Every child should understand clearly the cause of the punishment.
Too often children are punished in anger before an explanation 'is
given. Under "uch circumstances punishments cannot,, possibly .do
good, but will certainly do harm. . Â¦ :
Punishments must be just. A guilty child may seem 'to resent a
punishment, but in his heart he does not, when it is properly adminis
tered. Punish an innocent child and. in spite of love and respect, for
parents, he can : scarcely ever foreet it. - , /
, Punishment should be certain. Much more j depends upon cerr
tainty than' upon severity. To overlook an. offense at one time and
punish it severely at another time is an excellent way to encourage
children in wrongdoing. â¢ / . Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Punishment should be mild. It should never be more severe than
is necessary to reach the desired end. It is a kind of medicine,'-the'vir
tue of which depends upon its being used sparingly. / ;
Punishment should be. deliberate.'-;. If time is taken for reflection it
Whatsoever evil may attach to imperialistic ideas is likely to bÂ«
minimized in the United States and Great Britain, from the necessity
under which, unlike the great military monarchies, these countries Ho
of depending as far as possible upon moral force. America must be
averse for msny reasons to sending expeditions by sea and the expan
sion to which she is destined in Eastern Asia and South America need
not involve th; acquisition of ' territory. She cannot, however, exer
cise a protectorate over these regions without skillful and cautious dip
lomacy and the clearest proof to the inhabitants that it is well for them
to be permeated by her influence. It may seem ironical to speak of the
moral suasion of a power which has achieved so many conquests as
England, but in fact the most important of her possessions ar* in
habited not by conauered alien?, but by her own children, jealous
of their freedom, susceptible in their feelings and keenly alive to their
own interests. To keep so widely dispersed a congeries of communities
within the imperial fold will be a feat of the highest statesmanship, im
possible without continual concession, conciliation and compromise
and impossible even then if the imperial idea had not in the meantime
taken deep root in the minds of the dwellers abroad and at home.
Thirty years ago the veteran officials of the Colonial Office, who had
no such idea, thought it impossible, and it may at all events be said
that no nation has hitherto attempted the like. But even in conquered
countries and crown colonies the progress of moral force as a political
agent is very apparent. The condition of the protected princes of India
is a remarkable instance. Half a century ago the tendency was to get
rid 'of them as opportunity offered and to incorporate them in the
British raj. This was seen to be wrong, and now nothinjr,is safer than
the throne of an Indian prince, so long as he does not aftisgovern his
subjects" or fail in allegiance to the paramount power. ' Â£ven should
he- do so the consequences will be strictly personal to himself. As
India is and must be governed on imperial principles, this seems a clear
proof that imperialism is not necessarily incompatible with justice or
synonymous with the lust of territory. It means, in farct. nothing more
than that it is better to be the citizen of a great state than of a small
one, and that character is ennobled by taking in the virtues which gain
and retain empire.
Force of Moral Suasion.
Proof of a converse kind may be derived from the examples of those
states which at one time took a leading part in the affairs of the world,
but have now fallen to the condition of second-rate powers. Such
are Spain and Sweden, and as regards the colonial empire which alone
made them great, Portugal and Holland. These countries may be as
patriotic as ever, but cannot be imperialistic, for imperialism is patriot
ism inspired and buoyed up by a sense of the power which they no
longer possess. Has the national character improved since these
losses as", if imperialism be indeed the demoralizing influence it has
been represented, it assuredly ought to have done? Do the inhabitants
of these countries at this time of day exhibit a finer type of character
than did their ancestors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries?
Apart from the universal leveling up in enlightenment and civility,
which they have shared with all European nations, it is certain that
they do 1 not, and that they would be the last to exalt themselves over
progenitors, to whose days they look back as to a heroic age. Their
advantages over their ancestors are nevertheless many, but not one can
be connected in the remotest degree with the dying out among them
of imperialistic spirit consequent upon the loss of empire.
Let us now produce an instance of an opposite description. Littls
more than a hundred years ago the United States of America were ad
mitted among the family of nations, but it was long ere they ranked
among the great powers. They had not attained this position when,
in 1803, Charles Brockden Brown, best known as the first American
novelist, but also as a publicist, sought to persuade his countrymen
(who did not require much persuasion) to acquire Louisiana from Na
poleon. Writing in the character of a French Councilor of State,
he enumerates the causes which are thought to render the American
nation weak. Among these are "the want of national spirit, patriot
ism, sense of nation honor or love of national glory" â the very
things in which America has long superabounded. To what can so vast
a change be attributed but growing national strength and the con
sciousness of an imperial mission? And is not the last state better
than the first?
EFFECT OF IMPERIALIST ON NATIONAL CHARACTER
By Dr. Richard Garnett, C. B.
"I see no reason for the retention of the word obey," declared the Rev.
Julius B. Remensnyder. pastor of St. James Lutheran Church. New York.
"Because," he continued, "the marriage service of the church is historical.
and it was determined by the church which saw fit to omit the word obey/
"Luther translated the ancient forms from the medieval Latin into the
German liturgy of Cologne in 154.1- This was the first Protestant liturgy
ever published, and the men at the conference did not consider that the word
obey was authorized or demanded by the liturgical practice of the church,
and therefore they omitted it.
"In the Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal church it was, how
eve;, used. This is one of the slight differences between the Lutheran and
Episcopal marriage services.
"In view of thi historic data and of the fact that the word obey has come
to be a mere unmeaning form which the bride, according to our modern con
ception of the domestic relations, has no idea of literally subjecting herself
to, there would seem to be no good reason for its retention."
TheWord "Obey" Not inLtitHeran Service
"In all my married life â and I have been married
happily for several yearsâ I have never before had the ques
tion of whether or not a wife should promise to obey pre
sented to me," said Mrs. Ralph Trautman.
"It seems just a little absurd to me, for I am a follower
of the old school, and believe that a woman should look
up to and follow the counsels of her husband. .
"Even in disagreements,, separations and divorces which"
have come under my personal observation not once could
the cause of unhappiness be traced. to the word 'obey.'
"A man and woman who have been married should
strive to meet each other's views in every way. If this
means a little giving in on the part of'one, then let that one
yield. It will bring greater happiness for both in the end."
"The woman is 50 per cent of the marriage â not 49 or
48 per 'cent. She is not the tail of the kite.. If she loves
there will never be any question of obedience â she will do
what is right, not because' she feels that she must live up to
her marriage contract, but because she really and sincerely
wants to. If there is mutual love, sympathy and deep feel
ing the couple will strive to be happy together, each one
considerate of the other, and there will be no question of
obey."
Real Love Does Not Object.
"The question of equality between man and woman is one that comes no \
very frequently," said Baba Bharati, "but when it touches upon the marriage ,
service and the word obey, which is so important a part of it, I must ranae :
myself on the side opposing the elimination of the word.
"If there is love there is homasre, for love is homage. Wherever there
is a home you will find devotion, service and obedience. Without homaee
there is no love, without love there is no obedience. Love is a slave and
love is a master. â¢ . .
"In India the man says the same as the woman; she makes no promises
that are not also required of him. Very often the woman is really the mis
tress., and the man through his great and deep affection for his wife becomes
her .slave. .
"The girl who objects to promising to obey will nevertheless obey her
husband in every moment of her life. It seems to me that women fence with
words, that they pay too little attention to the real meaning of the tenets
and customs of the land."
"Women War Over Words."â BabaBharati
"You might as well . strike out 'with all my worldly
goods I thee endow' from the marriage service as the word
'obey,'" asserted Miss Jeannette Gilder when asked her
views on the much discussed question of whether or not a
woman should promise bbedience to her husband.
\ "It is more of a farce for an impecunious foreigner who
marries an American heiress to say 'with all my worldly
goods I thee endow' than for the woman to say 'obey.'
"People as a rule pay no more attention to the Word
than if it were not there. It stands as a relic of another age,
when women were indeed the slaves of men, but it must no
longer be taken literally.
"Nowadays a woman does not actually promise to obey.
She may go through the form and utter the simple little
word, but neither she nor the man she marries looks upon
the promise as one actually binding her to obey him in every
particular. ,. ,
"To my mind there seems to be no more reason for the
woman to say this word than for the man, and it really
makes' very little difference about leaving' it out altogether.
"The general interpretation of the wqrd, according to
moflern views, is that the two promise to live together in
peace and happiness, which is, after all, the end in view,
or it should be.
"It is always possible, you know, for a woman to make
a mental reservation even if she does repeat the entire words
of the marriage service, but after all if she-love her husband
she is quite willing to obey him â within the limits of
reason." . ' .
Relic of Another Age.
Father John Talbot Smith of New York says that the
word obey is not used in the Catholic marriage service.
"The marriage sacrament," states Father Smith, "is an
agreement between the two parties. The man says, 'I take
you' and the woman says the same. There is no such word
as obey in our ritual. The couple are, however, exhorted to
mutual love and -acceptance of each other, which is the es
sence of marriage.
"The theory of marriage in the Catholic church is that
the husband is the head of the family and the wife owes
him love, honor and obedience, while he owes her love, re
spect and maintenance. He is bound to maintain her as
besthe can, but he does not have to obey her.
"To tell the truth, I do not think it is a practical ques
tion at all, this one of eliminating the word obey. It is
in the nature of things that the man should command and
woman should obey, no matter how many statutory pro
visions you make, simply because a man likes to command
and a woman likes to obev.
"What is the use of statutes against a natural proclivity
or condition?' You can see the wisdom of the church in
omitting th,e word from its ritual.
"A woman who refuses to obey might please her fancy
by the mere declination to follow a custom, yet she might
be the quickest to obey her husband.
"That is where nature is stronger than ideas. Ideas
may become fads,' existing for a short while, but nature
goes right on. /
"I notice that men are glad to get the women they, want
to" marry and the women are equally glad to marry, obey or
not, regardless of all fads and fancies." ,
"The Jews have no such word in the service. The first
couple, you know, were Jews, and they lived and loved to
gether, each a helpmeet for the other.
"If I loved a woman enough to make her my wife I
should want her to be my associate in everything. , She
should not say 'obey' any more than I. j The word implies
inferiority, and the angel whom we worship, whether it be
the man's wife or his mother, must not be made to descend
from the exalted pedestal to which man has raised her and
be brought to the level of a slave.
"I admire the pluck of the girl who the other day re
fused to promise to obey the man she was about to marry,
and insisted on having the word barred from the service.
That girl is a pioneer. She thought more of her principle
than of marriage itself and she has the stuff in her to make
a good wife. It was her womanhood that prompted her
to take the action, and womanhood counts considerably
toward making marriages happy."
"In feudal days, when women were nothing more than
serfs, when they plowed the fields and did the hardest part of
the work, sometimes yoked to oxen or dogs, they were com
pelled to obey their lord and master, but we have pro
gressed^far beyond such an unequal arrangement, and now
adays women arc entitled to the same consideration and lib
erty enjoyed by men â that is, of course, speaking generally.
"Chivalry prompts me to declare myself emphatically for
the elimination of the word obey from the marriage ser
vice," said A. H. Hummel, New York's famous divorce law
yer, adding with a smile: "Perhaps I could speak more
fluently on the actual tie itself. However, being a lawyer
and a bachelor does not prohibit one from holding views
on the subject of marriage contracts,' and it seems to me
that it is high time for us to get away from this particular
relic of barbarism, thÂ»s making a woman promise to obey the
man she marries.

"Oh, Prisdlla! Were it you who took

"And she. Miss Broadhurst If I can
picture her as I see her, should make
me famous. I thought one so sweet and
charming could not exist until I saw you,
and you are her counterpart"
It was no idle compliment no silly at
tempt at flirtation. Swiftly the girl
searched Cartright's mind and found him
sincere. "Thank you, Mr. Cartrlght," she
said simply, yet she colored with.pleas

"It may seem queer," he continued,
"but there is a feeling, too strong to be

my literary conscience. Often I know
that my stories would sell better were I
to change in some cases even a single

That will ever be a golden afternoon in
Cartright's memory. At times he read
aloud from the book of poems with which
Miss Broadhurst had planned to while
away an hour alone by tha river. More
often they chatted of many thingsâ plays,
books, mutual acquaintances, themselves.
And then long silences would fall, silence

this perfect sympathy and companionship

banished these thoughts whenever they
came. "This one afternoon shall be ours,"

Cartright had inherited a passion for
tramping through the dew. He dressed
Quickly and started out for a brisk walk.
But inspiration refused to come at Cart
riglit's bidding. With an Instinctive
grasp of the magazine's style, he had
sketched the principal characters of his
story. There must be two â a man and a
woman. The former must be fine and sin
cere and honorable, a gentleman in every
respect who had made a place in the
world by his own efforts. The girl must
be sweet and true, with softly curling
hair, and wide, frank, innocent blue eyes.
The characters must be ideal companions,
warm friendsâ but not lovers. Cruel cir
cumstances and their own ideals of honor
must send them through the world apart,
even though their very souls, as if alone
In a wilderness, cried each unto the other.
He had been mistaken in his feeling
that morning that the plot was about to
disclose itself, for after breakfast it still
eluded him. He could not think effective
ly in his 6tudy. The free, windswept
porch and his easy chair and pipe were
not the solaces and aids to Â«stfought he
usually found them. In despair he seized
a fishing rod and started for the river, a
half-mile away.
A Eplash in the water and a little cry
awakened Cartright from the reverie in
which he had fallen. A girl was stand-
Ing on the bridge; her sailor hat had
blown into the river and was floating laz
ily toward him. The fishing rod was
brought into requisition, and a moment
later, bowing, he was presenting the drip
ping hat to its owner.
She was the girl of bis story personified.
He had Imagined his heroine with wavy
hair curled softly about her temples, just
as this young lady's did.
A single glance and she knew him for a
gentleman. Soon they were seated side by
side talking like old friends.
He discovered that her name was Ruth
Broadhurst, and that she was visiting at
Banker Lawton's. Miss Broadhurst knew
of John Cartright, had read some of his
stories. The young man's character and
achievements had been highly spoken of
by the Lawtons, and although the irreg
ularity of their meeting at first troubled
her, the lack of a formal Introduction
soon ceased to make Itself felt
The girl unpinned a rose at her breast
She kissed it and handed It to Cartright
and went her way unseeingly, for her
eyes were filled with tears. She turned
once and looked back. He stood upon the
spot where they had parted. The rose he
held to his lips.
He held It between his own. and bent
impetuously toward her. "Xeetf *ve say
good-by?" he said. "May I not call to
night?"
She raised her eyes to his. They were
both glad and troubled at his words, yet
within their depths vas an appeal he
could not mistake â an appeal to his chiv
alry. "It must be good-by," she said
and then, "And ' so am I." he replied,
gloomily. "I suppose after the 12th of
September I must not even think of you
any more."
; "Wednesday, the 12th? Why, that is
my wedding day." â
"And mine."
Miss Broadhurst smiled as she turned
away. "Mr. Cartwright, there is the plot
for your story."
"Need it be written?" he asked pas
sionately, pleadingly. "That story is so
sad; the saddest I have ever known."
The sweet lips were tremulous, but the
eyes were brave and steady now. "It
must be written," she said softly. "Your
heroine was true and sweet Help her
to 'sweep behind the door,' to remain
true to herself and her promise. And oh
believe me! Though they parted, those
two In the story, she always remembered
him, and," breathlessly, "was sorry, per
haps," thatâ that they were not to be to
gether, nor even to see each other again."
"And heâ the man in the storyâ was
more than sorry. He would have said
much, yet honor forbade. She gave him
a rose which he always kept And that is
the end of the story."
Cartrlght helped her to her feet every
nerve thrilling at the touch of her little
band.
Everything must come to an end, and
this incomparable day was drawing to a
close. With a start of surprise the girl
noted the slanting sun. "I had no Idea
it was so late." she said. "How the time
has flown." - .
His companion nodded. "I know the
feeling. When I was a little girl my
mother gave me the task of sweeping the
parlor. I did not like it, and at first I did
it hurriedly, leaving unswept the places I
thought would not be discovered. When
mother came to inspect the room her tone
of mingled teproof and surprise filled me
with shame when she said. 'And my Ruth
did not sweep behind the door!' That was
all, yet whenever I am tempted to shirk,
or do anything which is not right I think.
'I must sweep behind the door.' "
Her naive simplicity delighted Cart
right, and he led her to talk of her home
town, her friends and her daily occupa
tions. Yet there "was never a word of
the ring, nor the man who had placed It
upon her finger, and Cartrlght respected
the fine delicacy of her nature.
"Never say die. little glrL We will

up the pen.

There was silence for several momenta
while Lee's pen traveled rapidly over tha
paper. At length he pushed back tha
chair again.
"It is finished," ha said, "and ready for

reading of this I shall be cast Into outer

a handsome fellow, despite the careless
manner in which he dressed, ami the new
stenographer often glanced at him ap
provingly when she knew he was looking
the other way.
Mr. Drummond. the senior partner in
the firm. Introduced Herman to the new
stenographer. He knew Herman's lepu
tation for shyness, and only by a great
effort kept down a smile when he saw
the big German blush conspicuously upon
meeting the frank glance of the young
girl. The Introduction over, Herman
promptly turned to his books, more for
the purpose of letting the blush die away
than for any other reason. As he pored
over the books he reflected with delight
that the girl's name. Helen Dumont, was
a name that eminently suited her.
This went on al% through tha spring
and Herman began to lose flesh under
thÂ« strain of trying to decide whether ha
was in love with a beautiful girl or a
beautiful voice. Time and again ha
wrestled unavailing with the shyness
which prevented him from getting better
acquainted ~with Helen Dumont He often
met her on his way home in the evening
and knew that she lived somewhere close,
but ha could never quite get his courage
up to the point of asking permission to
call on her.
Then ha made up his mind that ha
would sea tha owner of Tha Voice. Ha
knew that she lived In tha house next
to the place- where ha boarded, but a pro
jecting bay window cut off the view of
this house from his window and ha had
no way of knowing what room tha owner
of The Voice occupied.
One evening in June ha made his op

til he had rounded tha point of tha bay
raised to protest at tha muslo. From tha
window where tha singer sat a silvery
laugh floated out. Tha window closed
and the voice accompanied bis music no
more that night.
Next day at tha office he stola many
furtive glances at Miss Dumont and tried
to decide whether ha was in love with
her or with the voice he had heard the
night beforeâ already he was beginning
to think of it as The Voice, mentally cap
italizing the words. Before the day was
over he decided that hÂ© was in love with
Helen Dumont. The graceful turn of her
head and the. purity of expression In her
big brown eyes seemed to him worth all
the voices In the world. But in the even-

And It was in the spring that he fell in

grateful to his Teutonlcally sentimental

for a German musician to love two wo

corneringâ the world's visible suoolv of grass. But as we intimated above.
Mr. Careneedy's first aim and intent was to make an extra fine, all-wool
capitalist of himself. So far as he was concerned his fellow-man mieht emi
grate to Mars or Missouri or any other out of the way corner of the uni
verse, so long as the market for the particular style of grass that he was
cultivating: was not injured thereby.
For a time the *rass business flourished like a green bay tree â if the tree
can be bay and green at the same timeâ but as the years -rolled on and the
shekels rolled up the feeling beean to spread among the unfjfateful caters of
grass that they were payinz overmuch for their baled hay and were Retting
only an indifferent quality of chopped straw at that. Jn addition "to this sore
instance of base inRratitude. Mr. Careneedy's mowers began to murmur
among themselves and to insinuate that while they raked the hav and 'did
other Maud Muller stunts in the sweat of their brows Mr. Carencedv sat in
the lee of a roll-top desk in the shadow of the fretful telephone and the lo
quacious typewriter and did rather more than his fair share of rakine of an
other sort. In fact it was openly charged that while his barns were loaded
down to the Phrrlsoll mark with the finest quality of long green erass his la
borers were forced to content themselves with what they could comb out of
their hair after the day's toil was ended. These ignorant haymakers had
never learned that fundamental maxim of the business world that heaven helps
men who help themselves if they are careful not to get caught at it
Â¦- At first the worthy capitalist was too much engrossed in a scheme for
increasing the normal number of blades of grass three and even four times
-instead of only two, as was the old-fashioned business practiceâ by a iudi
acms process of irrigation to pay any heed to the jealous muttering of the
men who bought his hay or of those who cut it. It was not until receipts
began to fall off and there were rumors of a strike in the hayfield that he
wakened to the fact that his affairs were fast getting into a parlous condition
Now. no self-KSoecting capitalist likes to get into a parlous condition In
the first place it s a safe bet that he doesn't know what the word means
moreover, when he finds out he likes it even less, for parlous is merely the
French for all to the bad. â¢

other things I've heard ab # out that nearly makes my blood

"I knew by your look the minute I seen you that you'd

I didn't like the way he tried to. get up close to me, but
it seemed a little risky to move away from him, because you

There I got into an argument with a man who struck
me right off as a suspishus character. I could see by the
gieam in his left eye that he would as soon shoot a man
in the back as peel an orange, and there was something
about the way he drew in his under lip that made me fed
sure right off he was one of the degenerates we hear about.
I didn't want to have anythin' to say to the feller, thinkin'
it was just as well not to get into a fuss, but he started it
and I had to answer hhn, because I thought he might feel
insulted and want to pick a feud if I pretended not to
notus him.
"It seems to me," he says, lookin' at me with one of the
murderousest gleams I ever seen in a human eye, "that the
people in the North might be doin' a good deal better than
makin' a fuss about every little thing that happens down
here."
"Yes," I says, thinkin' I better agree with him, "they

I could act shully see him shivcrin', it seemed to shock
him so.
"Great heavens 1" he says, "what kind of people are yon
to let such outrages keep groin* on right along? Why
don't you order out the militia to stop it? I'd be afraid
if I lived up there where such things happen to ever let my
children out of the house alone for fear I'd never see them
alive again. But there's one thing I've read about that
simply can't be true, and that's about the way they doctor
the milk sometimes with poison and then sell it to people
to give to their babies. Stranger, it's terrible what you say
about the automobiles and railroads runnirr* over and
killin' ' people, but I believe you are honest, so I wouldn't
doubt your word, although it don't hardly seem possible
that such things could be in a civilized land where the twen

poisoned milk for the babies, that's too much. I won't be
lieve that about anybody." '

true, and he set there and looked at me with the pittifulest
look I ever seen on a human bein*. I could see that he
thought I was crazy on the subject and was just tryin' to
make things out worse than they were because I was proud

genus commonly known as tight-wad. People didn't object to his making
money by the pailful, but they were extremely sore over the fact that he im
mediately transferred it to a barrel and after driving in the bung with a sledge
hammer proceeded to sit on the barrel.
The only thing for our friend Careneedy to do in such a case was to un
limber his watering-can and sprinkle some of the blessings of Providence
and the hay business around among his fellow men. It wasn't so much that
he loved his fellow man as -that he didn't want him butting into his boudoir
some dark night with an injunction in one hand and a chunk of dynamite in
the other. Also he knew that it was more blessed to give than to receiveâ
what he was likely to receive if he didn't loosen up.
In accordance with this pious determination he forthwith announced that he
had decided to found a college for the study of decomposed languages and
the investigation of the private habits of dragon-flies. . .
By this time the worthy 'Careneedy's zeal was thoroughly fired with all
the furnaces going and the forced draught on. Not satisfied with the great
works for the uplifting of his fellow man that he had set on foot he said to
himself: "Go to. I will hold out the helping hand to my poor brothers
who faint in my hayfields. They have made hay for me while the sun shone
mighty hot and they have eaten their bread in the sweat of their browa â
because they couldn't afford salt. Now will I repay them even as a young
spendthrift to his long-suffering tailor on his way back from bis poor but
rich grandfather's funeral."
Then he called his hirelings together and gently broke the news to them
that he had prepared a special lot of benefactor stock to be issued free of
charge to his faithful employes. He omitted to mention that no dividend
would be paid on the stock until the holders of bonds and preferred and com
mon stock, the insatiable but necessary reserve fund, the fund for repair and
maintenance, and the fund' for the promotion of irrigation and general better
ment interests had been attended to. Being only ignorant workinjrmen the
hirelings jumped at the conclusion that a share in the hand was worth a raise
in the walking delegate's mind.
Then was all smooth sailing for the worthy Careneedy. His university
has prospered and became a power â one horse-^-in the land; his devotion
to the cause of science and advancement of civilization nets him half a bushel
of degrees every commencement: and he has a fair chance to go to the grave
amid the tears, of a sorrow-stricken populace, weeping because they can
touch his handâ or his pocketâ never again. His hay is known and bought
by a grateful and loving people in preference to any one else's because he is
such a philanthropic soul, and his jolly(ed) haymakers have stood for two
cuts in their wages since they learned his philanthropic intentions toward]
them. i "I > '-" ? . â ,. '^. :: '. :
The lesson that his career contains for all struggling capitalists every
where is that it pays to cast bread upon the waters if we are careful to tie
a strong string to it before making the cast.

As the prisoner obeyed Instructions
Flemming rose to his feet and began
feeling In his pockets, drawing forth at
last a large brown ball.
"What Is . your, plan, cobbler?**^ asked
the King, with interest. Â» . ,,i .<Â¦
"I'm wonderlngjf this man would venÂ«

the rope." .suggested Flemming.
"Oh. I'll.- do that willingly!" cried the
prisoner. "But what Is- the use of It?
It's about ten times .too short, as the
Armstrongs well know."
"Are we 'likely/.' to be disturbed here
through" the night?" asked Flemming.
Peter had drawn. In the rope and its
sinister loop lay on the floor, its further
length resting on the window sill and
extending out to the enÂ£ of the beam.
The cobbler examined it with Interest.
% "Come," cried the King, "there is little
use letting a supper wait for the eating
merely because we seem to have gone
wrong In our inquiries about the cattle."
Neither thÂ« ooet nor the cobbler had
any appetite for supper, but the King
was : young and hungry, and did justice
to the hospitality of the Armstrongs.
"Have you been here long?" he asked
of the prisoner .In the corner.

"And I say the same," shouted Cock

Some of the opposition were about to
epeak. but the King held up his hand for
ellence.
â¢â¢'That' is treason." he : said quietly.
"Adam Scott. I have heard that you are
called King of the. Border. Scotland Is
blessed with a number of men who are
King of this or King of that, and I am
sure I make no objection, as long as they

This remark seemed to encourage cer

border forces, he will have destroyed a

The robber looked Intently at the King.
"I think not." he said.

motionless.

Nevertheless, when... the King came to
the inn where he had been captured there
were but twenty trooper^ with him. Sir
Donald was the sDokesman on that occa
sion. He said to the. landlord, vhose rov
ing eye was taking count of the number
of horses:
"Go to Johnny Armstrong and tell him
that the King, with twenty mounted men
at his back, commands his presence hÂ«re.
and see that he comes quickly. '
Johnny was not slow In replying to tha
Invitation, and forty troopers rode behind
him. " The . King sat on his horse, a little

There was silence now as the three
watched the deft hands of the cobbler.
It was a business of breathless Interest,
but at last the snakelike length of thin
rope lay on the floor at his disposal. He
tied an end securely to the beam just
outside the window-sill, so that there
would be no sharp edge to cut the cord,
then he paid out the line Into the dark

not become entangled.

over the stone sill and disappearing !n the
darkness. * The cobbler held the taut line
In his hand. No man- spoke; they hardly
seemed to breathe until the cobbler said:
When the King reached Stirling and
Â¦was dressed once more in a costume more
Â¦uited to his station than that which had
been torn by the brambles of the border,
he called to him the chief minister of his
realm.
"You will arrest Immediately,'* he said.
"Cbckburn of Henderland and Adam
Bc'ott of Tushlelaw and have them be
headed."
"Without trial, your Majesty?" aikad
the Minister in amazement.
"Certainly not without trial; but see
that the trial Is aa short as possible.
Their crime Is treason; the witnesses aa
many as you like to choose from our last
council meeting. I love and adhere to
the processes of law, but see that there
Is no mistake about the block being at
the end of your trial."
The Minister made a note of this and
awaited further Instructions.
"Place the Earl of Bothwell," continued
the King. "In the strongest room that
Edinburgh Castle has vacant. Imprison
Lord Maxwell and Lord Horn? and the
Lairds of Fairniherst. Johnston and Buc
clcuch In whatever strongnold Is most
convenient. Let these orders be carried

Tbe next man railed Into tha royal pres

"Have you five hundred mounted men

truly the woman who is an adept at It
deserves a flowery palm. For really it
requires no mean amount of skill and
tact to say ill-natured, vicious things with
a . smiling face and alwavs obtain the
desired results. Yet deliberately and with
malice of forethought she lays her
schemes and then sits, back and watches
them mature with grim satisfaction.
She is the kind of a woman who means,
although she is not frank 1 enough to say
It, "a choo for a chop." She' doesn't
entertain with a feeling of hospitality but
rather of decided hostility.

class of cirl and It isNhe that does our
hearts good ; and that makes us feel as
though life really was well worth living.
She's as full of life and high spirits as
an eg* is of meat and she gathers her
friends about her because she is glad to
be alive.
She's somewhat like the woman whose
friend said of her. "If her home w*rÂ» on
fire she might not invite you in, but un

So she resorts to her car, too. In order

Such was and such Is the captivating
Peggy O'Neal. .
Yet this Is exactly what the exquisite
Peggy of General Jackson's administra
tion did. Bhe was so secure In her ra
diant beauty that she dared do anything.
When the ladles about her gleamed and
sparkled with diamonds she knew that
they were not for her,' and straightway
troubled her pretty head not a little be
fore she finally arrived at the conclusion
that a simple string of coral pleased her
the best. She didn't need nor want lus
ter, for her eyes were like stars, and she
had discovered in her early life that sim
plicity was more becoming and Infinitely
more bewitching.
Bo she tossed her. curly hair to the
crown of her head and held it In place
with an old-fashioned comb. On the side.
Just where it pleased her ladyship the
most, she added a cluster of flowers, and
then In a careless mood let one .or two
long curls fall over her shoulders just' as
they [wanted to. Her hair was' distinctly

It Is one thing to lay down the law for
new fashions, but it Is quite another to
be brave enough to wear them, whether
any one else will or not. The slightest
deviation means attention, and it takes a
daring girl to successfully stand the
closest scrutiny and perhaps adverse crit
icism. Â¦ , â¢

outrivaled the only, the rreat, the
one Janice Meredith.
Just why probably will always be
a mystery. It so chances that there
ere a few things In this world that never
can be explained satisfactorily, and one
of them Is the whys and wherefores of
certain heroines of fact and fiction sud
denly and without the least warning step
ping In and twisting the fashions of the
day to suit their own sweet wills.. Yet
â¢oca Is unquestionably the case.
Three short years ago everything and
everybody was simply overrun with the
Janice Meredith craze, and In a measure
Mary Mannertng was responsible for It.
No matter how strenuously she may deny
It. tt Is the one and sole ambition of
â¢very girl to be beautiful, and when she
saw the fetching ccrl, the nobby boots
and the waist a la Janice, she promptly
hied herself to the modiste, the shoe
maker and the hairdresser, and, what Is
more to the point, she got there just as
fast as she possibly could. To see is to
be convinced, and she knew tn her heart
of hearts that at last she wu on on* of
the surest and best steps of the ladder of
beauty, and the tdea completely fas
cinated her.
The fair Mary simply couldn't endure
Janice and dubbed her "a silly, simper
ing thing." and If she had had her way
about It wouldn't have deluged the coun
try with colonial shoes with red heels, a
pointed waist line, the queer little square
effect for evening frocks and thÂ« tmmtni*
hoods that our grandmothers and theirs
before them used to think so chic.
At any rate. Janice bad her day, and
no one can deny that her Influence on
Dame Fashion was truly marvelous..;
Who doesn't know about her famous
curlT If there be any such don't for heav
en's sake acknowledge It. foe It has been
worn the length and breaath of the
United States, and, sad as It Is to relate,

adays parents send their children to col
lege in the confident belief that they will
receive physical as well as mental train
ing. In our own city the athletic clubs
are nourishing. Both sexes are beginning
to realize the necessity of exercise and
under the watchful eye Â¦ of experiencd
instructors are improving their physical
condition.
Next to handball, the most popular
form of exercise at the Olympic Club
Is tossing the "medicine ball." Athletes
know that this form of exercise will put
on muscle and take off superfluous flesh.
The "medicine ball" Is seven inches to
one foot In diameter and is filled with
hair, weltjor some other material. It Is
covered with leather and weighs from
four to eight pounds.
I have arranged a series of exercises
to be used by my pupils and they never
find It Irksome. Some of the ladies who
have placed . themselves . under my caro
have decreased their weight and secured
development where it was. needed. The
ladles whose pictures accompany this ar
ticle have succeeded in taking"' off twenty
pounds or more by tossing the "medicine
ball." It is a mild form of exercise and
is attractive.
The ball is passed with either hand and
the body Is turned In every direction. The
back, arms and chest are strengthened
and the constant bending reduces the
girth. Many members of the Olympic
Club have developed ridges of muscle on
their stomachs from bending and tossing
the ball. For people who take on weight
easily the exercise will do much to re
duee them.
Beanbags are not to be despised as
means of exercise. They are social in
their nature, as a number of people can
play at the same time. The double bean
bag pass did a whole lot of - good for
Corbett and will certainly help ethers.
Fair, pupils of mine, who find the "medi
cine ball" too strenuous a form of ex
ercise, have adopted the beanbag. These
light and yielding things can be, thrown
back and forward with speed and in less
than two minutes the players begin ' to
perspire.

time they do so is when sickness
overtakes them and It is absolutely nec
essary that they pause and think. Much
of the Eickness in this world can be ob
viated by proper exercise. Exercising for
health is a subject that is gradually Im
pressing Itself on the minds of the en
lightened. A few minutes' work In the
morning and again before retiring at
night will work wonders for those who
are not too lazy to wcrk. Walking In
the cj>en air and the proper care of the
body will add years to one's life..
There are many forms of exercise that
one. can take without tiring. Men play
baseball, handball and football because
competition makes them forget that they
are exercising. The fair sex cannot play
these games because they are too violent,
but there are exercises they may take
that will benefit them materially.
How often have I seen little, girls on
their way to school playing beanbag. This
childish eport has done much to develop
the little ones. It keeps them in the
open air. makes their cheeks rosy and
adds strength to thsir arras and body.
Watching the children at the game gave
me the idea that if properly developed
beanbag would be the proper form of ex
ercise for elderly persons. When James
J. Corbett. the famous boxer, was train
ing for his contest with Jeffries he played
beanbag. This may appear incongruous,
but it Is a fact. Corbett needed speed to
telp him in his work, bo his trainer pre
pared two beanbags which weighed not
more than three pounds each and the
pugilist and trainer would pass the bags
to and fro In a rapid manner. .It not
only developed Corbett's eye but also
made him agile. After playing the game
for a short time both men would be suf
fused in perspiration.
Thus. I say. beanbag has Its benefits.
If a man who Is training for the se.verest
kind of eport stops to play the game It
must be worth trying.
For women beanbag Is beneficial. It
win refluc* weisrht and bring color to
cheeks that 'lack color. It will put a
sparkle In the eyes and will bring health
and strength to bodies that need it.
The "medicine ball" which Is used by
athletes in training Is also a splendid form
of exercise. The ball used by men Is
much heavier than that which ought to
be used by women. Pupils of mine have
taken off many pounds by tossing the ball.
It- requires bending in every direction and
adds grace to the figure. At first one will
feel a trifle sore, but if the exercise Is
continued the soreness will disappear and
the person will begin to enjoy It
During the past years the science of
physical culture and hygiene haa made
rapid strides. The elementary laws of
health have been more widely diffused
and more intelligently followed by the
people at large. Air, food and sleep and
exercise when properly administered are
great remedies as well as great preven
tives of disease. This fact Is becoming
to be realized by doctor and patient. Our
bouses ere better ventilated, our table
more healthfully provided and the con-,
tfitlon of our families shows marked im
provement. Outdoor games are more pop
ular. Our style of dress has been modi
fled In favor of health and comfort. Now-
IN these strenuous times, when every
one Is hurrying and scurrying through
life, but one-tenth stop to consider
their phyeical condition. The only

The first time they had seen him since
he had made a name for himself and for
his road from Newport News to Frisco,
and. they meant now to kill him, dead.
You know about what It meant and
about how It went, how it had to go.
What could Martin say to the man who
had made him all he was and who stood
now a boy again among the boys of his
boyhood, and asked If fifteen minutesâ a
quarter of an hour tor De Molay No. 4?
It threw the little chief completely off
his schedule; Just fifteen minutes was
more then enough to do that All the
work was done, the anxiety nearly past-
Martin had risen to rest his thumping
head. But fifteen minutes; once in a life
timeâBucks asking It.'
T)uffy turned to big Jack Moore stand
ing at his Bide ready to pull De Molay
over the pass and spoke to him low. Jack
nodded; everything went with Jack, even
We had seen a good many swell trains
that day, the swellest that ever pounded
our fishplates, Pullmans solid, and the
finest kind of people. Boston, Washing
ton. New York, Philadelphia sent some
pretty gorgeous trains. : But with at
least half the town on the platform,
when De Molay Four rolled in it took
their breath so they couldn't -yell till
the Sir Knights began pouring; from the
cronies of his youth. Little fellows they
were in railroading, when he rode the goat
with them, but now mostly, like him, big
fellows. Half a dozen old salts had been
pounding ahead of him all day over the
wire. They were to Join him and Mr. and
Mrs. Callahan for supper in the private
car, and the yellow cider lay on the thin
shaven Ice and the mountain grouse
curled on the grill Irons when De Molay
Four. Pittsburg, pulled into Medicine
Bend. Â¦ Â¦
day morning on. It was all against Duffy.
When | the , chief took the middle trick
there were fourteen Templar, specials still
to come with the last one just pulling out
or McCloud on the plains. ' They were
orflered to run with right of track over
all eastbound trains thirty minutes apart
all the way. through. ., ' . .;-.'
: A minute after Martin Duffy sat in the
conductor of the train below registered
out. " There ' .was â¢ a" yell pretty soon and
away went the ' Baltimore ' crowdâ and
they were corkers, too, those Baltimore
fellows, and traveled IlkÂ© lords, ../.

and, as far as young Giddings -could see,
Duffy, , after five ;;Â¦ booming ; hours, was
fresher than when he took the chair. The
little dispatcher's capacity f or '; work was
something enormous; It' wasn't till after
supper time, with the worst of the figur
ing behind, him, and in the letting down
of anxiety, that Martin began to look
older and his dry Indian hair to crawl
over his forehead. By that time his eyes
had- lost 'their snap, and when he mo
tioned Giddings to the key, and got up to
walk up and. down the hall In the breeze
he looked like a. wilted potato vine. His
last batch of orders was only a little one
compared with those that had gone be
fore. But with the changes to the dif
ferent crews they read about like this:

We worked the whole spring getting
things up along the line, from Omaha to
the Sierras, for that conclave. Engines
were overhauled, rolling stock touched* up,
roadbed put in shape, everything shaken
from end to end. Not only were the pas
senger records to be smashed, but be
yond that a lot of our big general officers
were way-up Masons and meant that our
line should get not merely the cream of
the business but the cream of the ad
vertising out of the thing. The general
.tenor of the instructions was to nickel
plate everything, from the catalpas to
the target rods. For three months be
fore the conclave date we were busy get
ting ready for it, and when the big day
drew near on which we were to under
take the moving and the feeding of six
thousand people one way- on one track
through the mountains,- the - cartinks
smoked cross-cut and the Russian sec
tion men began to oil their hair.
Callahan was superintendent under
Bucks, then general manager, and Martin
Â¦Duffy, chief dispatcher; Neighbor, super
intendent *of motive power, and Double
day, division master mechanic, and with
everything buttoned up on the West^3nd
we went that Sunday morning on the fir
ing line to take the first of the Templar
specials.
Medicine Bend had the alkali pretty
well washed out of its eyes and never be
fore In its history had It appeared really
gay. The old Wickiup was decorated till
It looked like a buck rigged for a ghost
dance. Right after daybreak the trains
began rolling in on Harold Davis' trlc!c
Duffy had annulled all local freights and
all through odds and evens, all stock
tramps east and* all west-bound empties
âeverything that could be had been sus
pended for that Sunday, and with it all
there were still by five times more trains
than ever before rolled through Medicine
Bend in twenty-four hours. - ,
It ' was like a festival day in the moun
tains. Even the Indians and the squaw
men turned out to see the fun. There
was a crowd at the depot by 5 o'clock,
when the first train rolled up the lower
gorge with St. John's Commandery No.
River Junction â struck up on his mouth
organ "Put Me Off at Buffalo" they
dropped seven dollars odd and three bag
gage checks Into his hat while the crews
were changing engines. It appeared to
affect them uncommon to see a fellow
without any hands or feet play the mouth
organ, and before sundown Shorty made
the killing of his life. With what he
raked in that day he kept the City Mar
shal guessing for three monthsâ which
was also pretty good for a man without
any hands or feet. â¢
All day it was that way; train after
train and. ovation after ovation. The day
was cool as a watermelon â August â and
bright as a baby's face air through the
mountains, and the Templars went up
Into the high passes with all the owing
and noise we could raise. ..Harold Davis
took it all morning steady from 4 a. m.
at the dispatcher's key. He was. used up
long before noon; but he stayed, and just
at 12 o'clock, while a big Templar train
from Baltimore was loading its command
ery in front of the Wickiup after an early
dinner the big Templar band played a
tingling twostep, Martin Duffy stuck his
dry, parchment face Into the' platform

through it, climbed the Wickiup stairs,
walked \ Into the dispatcher's I room and,
throwing off his hat and coat, leaned over
Harold Davis' shoulder and took a trans
fer. -.; ' â¢ .-â.â..Â¦.... .
Young Giddings had been sitting there
in a perspiration half an hour, then; he
copied for Martin Duffy that day. j At
noon they figured to get the last Templar
over the' Eagle Pass with the set of the
sun. When Duffy took the key he never,
looked his force cleaner, only he was
tired; Giddings could see that. The reg
ular man had been sick a week and Mar
tin had been filling in. Besides that, all
Saturday, the day before, he had been
spiking the lineâ figuring ' what could be
annulled and what couldn't; what ' could
be run extra and- what could.be put Into
regulars. Callahan had just got married
and was going out to the , coast on - his
wedding tour Jn Bucks' car. He had rer
fused to look at an order after Saturday
night. Sunday morning, and from Sun-
silent, I expect, but p]eading-like. It
was left largely to Martin, for the young
fellow was already chief; and that was
the trouble â he hated to bear down too
hard; so he compromised by asking his
superintendent not to fire Bob. but to set
him back. They -sent him up as night
man to Rat River, the meanest place on
the whole system. That was the summer
of the Templars' conclave at San
â¢Frisco.
3 from Buffalo, and the Pullmans were
gay with bunting. The Medicine Bend
crowd gave them an Indian yell, and in
two minutes the Knights, with their
scalps In their hands as a token of sur
render, were tumbling Out of their sleep

like schoolboys, and when Shorty Love

and their movements, up to the lives,
then CHIEF!â with the honor of the divi
sion all clutched in Martin Duffy's three
quick rijrht fingers on the key and his
three quick left fingers on the pen at
the fan* Instant scratching orders across
Bob Duffy was taller than Martin and
I would repeat, handsomer; but I can't,
because Martin had absolutely no basis
of beauty to start with. He was parch
ment-like and palish from sitting night
after night and night after night over a
Â»ounder. Never a sick day In his life;
but always over the sounder until, sleep.
Ing or waking, resting or working, the
current purred and purred through his
great little head like a familiarity taking
old tomcat. He could guess more off
a wire than most men could catch after
the whole thing had tumbled in.
It was then that Martin reached out
a hand to his elder brother. There were
really Just the two brothers; and back
of them â as there Is, somewhere, back
of every railroad man â a mother. No
fatherâ not generally; Just a mother. A
quiet, somber little woman in a shawl
and a bonnet of no special shape or size
just a ehawl and a bonnet, that's all.
Anyhow, the Duffy hpys* mother was
that way, and there's a lot more like
fcer. I don't know what gets the fathers;
maybe, very often, the scrap. But
there's almost always, somewhere, a
mother. So after Martin began to make
a record, to help his mother and his
brother both, he spoke for Bob. Cal
lahan didn't hesitate ox jolly him as he
used to do with a good many. He
thought the company couldn't have too
many of the Duffy kind; bo he said,
"Yes. sure." And Bob Duffy was put
at workâ tame thing exactly: carrying
messages, reading hair-destroyers and
blowing bis salary' on pie.
But pie acts queer. Sometimes It makes
a man's head solid and his heart big;
then again It makes a man's head big
end his heart solid. I'm not saying any
thing more now except that pie certainly
acts different. '
Martin bepan work In the telegraph of
tfee: he really learned the whole thing
right there at the Bend under Callahan.
r>san carrying Western Unions stuck at
his waist under a hear-y leather belt. He
wore in those day*, when he had real re
rponsiLility, a formidable brown Stetson
that appeared bent on swallowing his
car?: it was about the time he was rising
trousers and eleven. Nobody but Sinker
ever beat Martin Duffy delivering mÂ»
pafres, rd<1 nobody, bar none â Bullhead.
McTerza, anybodyâ ever beat him eallr.K
pie. It was by eating pie that he was able
to v.e.ir the belt to longâ and you may
take that either way. But I Bpeak "gladly
of the pie, because In the usual course of
events there isn't much pie in a dispatch
er's life. There is. by very large odds,
more anxiety than pie, and I Introduce
the pie, not to give weight to the inci
dents that follow, but rather to lighten
them: thoug-h as Duffy has more recently
admitted, this was not always the effect
of th* pie itself.
I do not believe that Martin Duffy ever
had an enemy. A right tight little chap
he was, with always a good word, even
under no end of pressure on the single
track. There's many a struggling train
man that will look Quick and grateful
when any fellow far or near speaks a
Â¦word about Martin Duffy. Fast as he
climbed his head never swelled. His hats
rested, even after he got a key, same as
the original Stetson, right on the wings
of his ears. But bis heart grew right
along after his head stopped, and that's
where he laid over some other railroad
men I could mention if I had to, which I
don'tâ not here.
About the time it looked as If Martin
would make a go of It on the road, the
postoffice Inspectors were thinking Bob
would make a go of It over the road.
But he was such a kid of a fellow that
the postmaster convinced the detective
Bob's way of doing things was simple
foolishness, which It probably was, and
they merely swore him out of the ser
vice.
The 6ource of its illumination is be
lieved to be understood. I say believed,
because in a day when yesterday's be
liefs are to-morrow's delusions I commit
myself personally to no theory. Whether
it is a thing living or dead; whether ma
lign to mackerel or potent In its influ
ence on imperfectly understood atmos
pheric phenomena, I do not know. I doubt
whether anybody knows, except may be
Monsoon himself. I know only that on
the West End Monsoon's headlight, from
every point of view, stands high, and that
en one occasion It stood between Abe
Monsoon and a frightful catastrophe.
There have been of late studied efforts
to introduce electric headlights on the
Mountain Division. 'But there are grlz
rled mtn in the cab who look with dis
trust-silent, it Is true, yet distrustâ on
the claims put forth for them. While
Monsoon-s headlight does its wofk-as it
has done even lone before Monsoon fol
lowed it to the West End. and will do
long after he leaves the West Endâ why.
they say. ar.d reasonably enough, take
en new and theoretical substitutes?
While the discussion deepens and even
rases in the Wickiup. Monsoon himself
Is silent. Brave men are modest men.
Among ourttlves we don't use adjectives:
where Monsoon :Â«< known it is not neces
sary to put anything ahead of his nameâ
except', may be, once a month on the
payroll when the cross-eyed accountant
adds A. or Abe or Abraham, Just as he
happens to be fixed for time. Monsoon's
name in itself stands for a great deal.
When his brother engineers, men who
have grown seamy and weather beaten
In th* service, put up their voices for
Mpnsoon's headlight: or when talkative
storekeepers, who servilely Jump at head
quarters' experiments in order to court
the favor of the hljrh. ppeak for electric
ity, Abe Monsoon himself is silent. His
light is there: let them take it or leave
It as they will. If the superintendent of
motive power should attempt to throw It
out for the new fangled arrangement
Monsoon would doubtless feel that it was
not the first time Omaha had gone wrong
âand, for that matter, that neither he
nor anvbodv else had assurance It would
be the last. Howeverâ

right from the start, was what I call a
pood-lcoker. and being the oldest bey. he
had more of the swing anyway. When
Martin fame along his mother hadn't got
over thinking about Bob. Doubtless she
thought, to", of Martin, but he was kind
of overshadowed. Bob began by clerking
in the po*tcfnce and delivering mail to all
the pretty girls. His sympathy for the
girls was fn great that after awhile he
bepan parsing out letters to them whether
they were addressed to the girls or to
pomrbody Â« : 1Â«<Â». This gradually weak
ened his influence with the Government.
VERT able men have given their
lives to the study of Monsoon's
headlight, yet science, after no end
of investigation, stands in Its pres
ence baffled.
When young Giddings sat in the sun
was dropping between the Tetons. In the
yard the car cleaners were polishing the
plates on -Bucks' private car, and the
darky cook was pulling chickens out of
the refrigerator. Duffy had thirteen con
claves moving smoothly on the middle
trick. . The final one was due and the
hostlers were steaming down with the
double-header to pull. it over the pass.
This, the last of the commandery - trains.
was to bring De Molay Commandery No.

Bucks looked the least bit uncertain
as he considered the opening request.
It wasn't much In some ways, what they
asked; In other ways It was~a good deal.
He laughed and bantered and Joked

then he called up to Martin Duffy, who
was leaning out the dispatchers' win

But there was the little mother up home,
the clip. Talk about ambidexterityâMar

to use one hand at a time. If Martin
Duffy said 'right, trains went right, i If
he said wrong, trains went wrong. But
Martin never Â«ald the wrong: he said
only the right Glddlnga knows; he cop
led for him long enough. Giddinies and
plenty more of them can tell all about
Martin Duffy.
Bob didn't rise In the service quite so
fast as Martin. He did more of the so
cial act. and that pleased his mother,
who, on account erf her bonnet-and-ihawl
complexion, didn't achieve ' much that
way." Martin, too, was proud of his
brother, and as soon as Bob could handle
a wire, which was very soon (for he
learned things In no time) Martin got
Callahan to put him up at Grant as ope
rator. Bob got the place because he was
Martin's brother, nothing else. He held
It about two months, then he resigned
and -went to San 'Frisco. He was a rest
less fellow; it was Bob up and Bob down.
For a year he wandered around out there,
telegraphing, then he boDbed up again
In Medicine Bend out of a Job. He wanted
to go to work, andâ well. CallahanâMar
tin's brother, you knowâ sent him up to
Montalr as night operator. Three months
he worked steady as a dock. Then one
night the dispatchers at the Bend couldn't
fret Montatr for two hours. It laid out
No. 6 and a special with the general man

THE OPERATOR'S STORYoffice. Martin Duffy pushed his sallow
hair back for the last time, and, leaving
young Giddings to get the last O. K.'s
and the last Complete j on his trick, got
out of tho/chalr.

ture of Third : Eighty at Rat : River. Just
Third Eighty's signature f or . the . Rock
Point : meeting, and the biggest Job ever
tackled by a single-track road In Amer
ica, Glddings thought, was done and well
done. ,. . â¢
So the ambitious Glddings by means of
whera he had absolutely nothing to do
but smoke cigars and drink champagne,
and Pat Francis In the aisles, and Bucks,
with Mr. and Mrs. Callahan and their
crowd In private No. 12â there was that
much shouting anu tooting and waving
that Martin Duffy simply couldn't think
for a few seconds; yet he held them all,
for life or for death, every last one, in
the curve of his fingers.
' So they stood reaay in mg gorge while
Duffy studied wearily how to handle
First, Second and Third Eighty against
them.
First, Second and Third Eighty! If they
could only have been wiped off the face
of the rails as easy as they might have
been wiped off a train sheet! But there
they were, three sections, and big ones,
of the California fast freight. High class
stuff for Chicago and New York that
couldn't be held or laid out that Sunday,
not for a dozen conclaves. All day First,
Second and Third Eighty had been feeling
their way east through the mountains,
trying to dodge the swell commanderies
rolling by impudent as pay cars. But all
the final plans to keep them out of every
body's way, out of the way of fez and
turban and chapeau and Greek cross and
crimson splashed sleepers, were now
dashed by thirty minutes at Medicine for
De Molay Four.
Order after order went out from under
his hand. New meeting points for First,
Second and Third Eighty and De Molay
Four, otherwise Special 32C.
Pat Francis snatched the tissues from
Duffy's hand and, after the battalion had
dispersed among their wives and sisters,
and among the sisters of the other fel
lows; after the pornponed chaps had
chucked the trombones and cymbals and
drums at old John Parker's shins: after
the last air-cock had been tested and the
last laggard crusader thrown forcibly
aboard by the provost guard, the double
header tooted, "Out!" and. with the flut
ter of an ocean liner De Molay Four
pulled up the gorge.
The orders buttoned in the reefers gave
De Molay a free sweep to Elcho. and Jack
Moore and Oyster were the men to take
It, good and hard. Moreover, there /was
glory aboard. Pennsylvania nobs,* way
up railroad men, waiting to see what for
motive power we had In the woolly West;
how we climbed mountains and skirted
canyon walls and crawled down two and
three per cent grades. Then with Bucks
himself in the private carâ what â¢ wonder
they let her out and swung De Molay
through- the gorge as may be you've seen
a particularly buoyant kite snake its . tail
out of the grass . and send It careening
skyward. When they slowed for. Elcho
at nightfall, past First and Second
Eighty, and Bucks named the mileage,
the Pennsys refused to believe it for ; the
hour's run. But fast as they had sped
along the iron trail, Martin Duffy's work
had oped ahead of them, and this. order
was waiting:
Telegraphic Train Order No. 79.
C. and E. Third No. SO, Rat River.
C. and E. Special 326, Elcho.
tha turntables that stock with other en
gineers. Martin In his shirt sleeves leaned
out ,tbe window and, looking down on tha
turbaned and turbulent mob, spoke so
Bucks could hear.
"What is itr* demanded tha most puis
Â»ant commander of De Molay, excitedly,
"what does he say, Bucks?"
"What says the slave?" growled a sac
end formidable crusader; "out with It!"
"All we want Is fifteen minutes."
"You wouldn't turn us down on fifteen
minutes this far from an oasis, would
you. Bucks V protested a glass-eyed
Bhriner.
Bucks looked around royally. "Fifteen
minutes?" he drawled. "What's a quar
ter of an hour in a lifetime, Jackman,
on the last oasis? Take off your clothes
you fellows, and take half an hour. Now
will you be Â»rood?"
De Molay put up a Templar yell. They
always get the good things of life, those
Pittsburg men; things other fellows
couldn't begin to get. They passed the
word through the sleepers and the women
began pouring from the vestibules. In
two aulck minutes out came the Du
quesne band in. red pompom, duck trous
ers and military Jackets white corded
with black. The crowd broke, the band
marched down tha platform and, strik
ing up the "Washington Post." opened
ranks on the grass plat above the Wickiup
to receive the De Molay guard. One hun
dred Knights Templar in fatigue de
bouched into a bit of a park and In the
purple of the sunset gave a commandery
drill to the honor of Bucksâ Bucks and
the Wcet End.
It was Sunday night, and still as Au
gust could make it. The battalion, mov
ing silent and mobile as a steamer over
the grafis. marched, deployed and rested.
They broke, to the clear cut music, Into
crosses ar.d scuares and crescents and
stare until email boys went cross-eyed,
and wheeling at last on the line they sa
luted Buck*â himself a past grand com
manderâand the railroad men yelled.
Meantime the general manager's pri
vate car had been pasted on the tall end
of De Molay Four', and a pusher edging
up ctuck its nose Into the rear vestibule.
On the head end Jack Moore and Oyster
Â¦were backing down on the olive-green
6trlng with the two smoothest moguls on
the division. Bucks and Neighbor had
held back everything good all day for
D* Molay Four, down to engines and run
ners and conductor. Pat Francis carried
the punch, and the little chief sat again
Jn the dispatcher's chair for De Molay
Four.
And while the lovely women strolled in
the cool of the evening and the odor of
mountain sweetness and the guard drilled
and the band played the chief knit his
brows over hip train sheet. It looked now,
rearranged, reordered, readjusted and re
organized, as If a Glla monster had claw

ture. Under Giddings' eye, as he sat.
ticked Martin Duffy's chronometerâ the
watch that spilt the seconds and chimed
the quarters and stopped and started so
impossibly and ran to a second a monthâ
the watch that Bucks (who never did
things by halves) had given little Martin
Duffy with the order .that- made him
Chief. It lay at Giddlngs' fingers and the
minute hand wiped from the enameled
dial seven o'clockâ fifty-five, fifty-six,
seven, eightâ nine. Young Giddlngs
turned to his order book and in
spected his entries like a methodical
bookkeeper, and Martin Duffy's chronom
eter chimed the fourth quarter, 8 o'clock.
One entry he had still to make. Book In
hand, hÂ« called Rat River.
"Get Third Eighty's signature to Order
79 and hurry them out," he tapped impa
tiently at Bob Duffy.
There was a wait. Glddings lighted his
pipe the way Callahan always lighted his
pipeâ putting out his lips to catch all the
perfume and blowing the first cloud away
wearily, as Callahan always did wearily.
Then he twirled the match meditatively,
and listened and grot suddenly this from
Bob Duffy at Rat River:
"I forgot Order 79," came Bob Duffy's
message. "I let Third Eighty go without
It. They left here at seven fifty"â fifty
something. Giddlngs never heard fifty
what. The match went into the ink, tho
pipe into the water pall and Giddlngs, be
fore Bob Duffy finished, like a drowning
man was calling Elcho with the life and
death, the Nineteen call.
"Hold Special 326!" he cried over tha
wire the instant Elcho replied.
But Elcho, steadily, answered this:
"Special â Three-twenty-six â leftâ
hereâ seven-fifty-flve." ;
Giddlngs, with both hands on the table,
raised up like a drunken man. Eighty
in the open and going against, the De
Molay Four. Bucka. Callahan. wife â
everybodyâ and Rock Point a blind sid
ing that no word from anybody on earth
could reach ahead of Third Eighty.
Giddlngs sprang to the open window
and shouted to anybody and ' everybody
to call Martin Duffy. But Martin Duffy
spoke behind him. Â¦
"What do you want7" he asked; It
came terribly quick on Giddlngs as he
turned.
"What's tha matter?" exclaimed Mar
tin, looking Into the boy's face. "Speak,
can't you? What's the matter, Gid
dlngs?" .
"Bob forgot Order 79 and let Third
Eighty go withoutâ and Special 826 Is
out of Elcho," chocked Giddlngs. . .
"What?" t^vvJk.*^
"Bob atâ Rat Riverâ gave Third Eighty
a clearance without the, Order 79."
Martin Duffy sprang straight up in tha
air. Onca ha shut his lifted hands; once
he looked at Glddings, staggering again
through the frightful news, â¢ then ha
dropped into the chair, looked wildly
around, seized his key like a hunted man,
stared at his train sheet, i grabbed the
order book, and listened. to Olddlngs cut
ting off one, hope after, -another of stop
ping Special 326. .His fingers set mechan
ically and he made the Rat River call,
but Rat River was silent. With Barnes
Tracy tiptoeing Â¦ In behind on the in
stinct "of trouble, and young .Giddlngs
shaking like a leaf, the chief called Rat
River. Then he called Elcho, asked : for
special 326, and Elcho again repeated
steadily: .
"Special â 326 â left â here â on â or
derâ7Â£-^at-seven-flfty-five p.' m."
Martin Duffy, bent before tha message;
young Glddings, who had been whispering
to Trapy, dropped on a stool and covered
his facÂ«. '..'Â¦'. .
"Don't cry, Giddlngs." It was Duffy
who spoke; dry and parched his voice.
Doubleday and the company surgeon.
Dr. Carhart, rushed Into the room almost
together. Then cama with a storm tha
wrecking boss. Benedict Morgan; it was
only an evil hour that brought Benedict
Morgan Into the dispatchers' office. Stoop
ed and silent, Martin Duffy holding the
chair, was calling Rat River. [ Carhart
watched him Just a moment, then ha took
Barnes Tracy aside and whisperedâ and.
going back, bent over Duffy. Tha chief
pulled himself up.
"Let Tracy take tha key," repeated the
doctor. "Get away from the table a min
ute, Martin. It may not be as bad as you
think."
Duffy, looking into the surgeon s face,
put his hand on his arm. "It's the Da
Molay train, the special 326. witu Bucks'
car, double-headed. Oh, my Godâ I can't
stop them. Doctor, they will meet!"
Carhart unfastened the fingers on his
arm. "Come away a minute. Let Tracy
have the key," he urged.
-J'A head-ender, eh?" croaked Benedict
Morgan from the counter, and with a
frightful oath. "A head-ender!"
"Shut up, you brute!" hissed Carhart.
Duffy's hands were creeping queerly up
the sides of his head.
"Sure." growled Benedict Morgan, low
erlngly, "sure. Shut up. Of course. Shut
up."
Carhart was a quick map. He started
for the 'wrecker, but Duffy, springing,
stopped him. "For God's cake, keep cool,
everybody," he exclaimed, piteously.
There was no one else to talk, to give the
orders. Bucks and Callahan both on tha
specialâ may be past order giving now.
Only Martin Duffy to take tha double
load and the double shame. Ha stared,
dazed again/into the faces around as ha
held to the fiery surgeon. "Morgan," he
added steadily, looking at the surly
wrecker, "get up your crew, quick.
Doubleday, make up all tha coaches in
the yard for an ambulance train. Get
every "doctor In town to go with you.
Tracy, clear the Una." ; j .
The master mechanic and Benedict Mor
gan clattered downstairs. Carhart. run
ning to the telephone, told central to
summon every medical man In tha Bend,
and hurried out. Before he had covered
a block roundhouse callers, like flaws of
wind before a storm, were scurrying the
streets, and from tha tower of tha flre
house sounded the harsh clang of the
emergency gong for the wreckers.
Caught where they could be caught, out
of saloons, beds, poker Joints, Salvation
barracks, churchesâ the men of thÂ«
wrecking crew ran down tha . silent
streets, waking now fast lntofllfe. Con
gregations were dispersed, hymns cut.
prayers forgotten, bars deserted, 3 hells
emptied, barracks raided as that call, the
emergency gong call, fell as a fireball, for
the mountain division wrecking train.
While the yard crews shot up and down
the spurs switching coaches Into tha re
lief train Benedict Morgan with solid vol
leys of oaths was organizing his men
and filling them at tha lunch counters
with huge schooners of coffee. Carhart
pushed again, through tho Jam of men
and up to the dispatchers' office. Befora
and behind him crowded tha local physi
cians with Instrument bags and ban
dages. The ominous baggaga deposited
on the office floor, they sat down about
the room or hovered around Carhart ask
ing for details. Doubleday, tall and grim,
came over from the roundhouse. Bene
dict Morgan stamped up from tha yardâ
the mountain division wu ready.
All three dispatchers were in tha room.
John Mailers, the day man, stood near
Tracy, who 'had relieved GIddlnjs. Tha
line was clear for the relief run. Elcho
had been notified of tha Impending dis
aster, and at Tracy's elbow sat tha chief
looking fixedly at the keyâ taking the bob
of the sounder with his eye. A doien
men In the room were talking; but their
spoke as men who speaking wait on tha
life of a fuse. Duffy, with suspense deep
ening Into ' frenzy, pushed Tracy's hand
from the key and, sliding Into tha chair,
began once more to call his brother at
Rat River.
"R, T fâ RAT â R, T â R, T," clicked
the River call. "R, T â R, TV Bobâ Bob
âBob," spelled the sender. "Answer me,
answer, answer. R, T â R, T â R, T
R. T"â
And Barnes Tracy edged away and
leaned back to where the shadow hid his
face. And John Mailers, turning from
the pleading of the current, stared gloom
ily out of the window across the yard
shimmering under the double relay of
arc lights: and young Giddlngs. who
couldn't stand Itâ Just couldn't stand It
bending on his stool, shook v-ith gulping

all knew the trackâ knew whera thÂ«
trains would meet; knew they could not
by any possibility see each other till they
whirled together on the curve of the Cin
namon cut or on tha trestle west of It,
and they waited only for tha breaking of
the suapense that settled heavily over
them.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty minutes went,
with Martin Duffy at intervals vainly
calling. Thenâ as tha crack opens in tha
mountain slide, as the sea gives up at
last Its dead, tha sounder spokeâ Rat
River made tha dispatcher's call. And
Martin Duffy, staring at the copper coil,
pushed himself up In bis chair Ilka a man
that chokes, , caught smothering at his
neck, and slipped wriggling to the floor.
Carhaxt caught him up, but Duffy's eyes
stared meaningless past him. Rat River
was calling him, but Martin Duffy was
past tha taking. Like the man next at
the gun. Barnes Tracy sprang into tha
chair with the I. I. D. The surgeon. Gld
dlngs helping, dragged Duffy to tha
lounge In Callahan's roomâ his chief was
mora to Giddlngs then than the fate of
Special 328. But soon confused voices be
gan to ring from where men were crowd-
Ing around tha dispatcher's table. They
echoed in to where tha doctors worked
over tha raving chief. And young Gid
dlngs. helping, began, too. to hear strange
things from the other room.
"The moon â "
"The moon?"
"The MOON'!"
"What?"
Barnes Tracy was trying to make
himself heard:
"The moon, damn It! MOON! That's
English, ain't It? Moon."
"Who's talking at Rat River?" demand
ed Benedict Morgan, hoarsely.
"Chick Neale.- conductor of Third Eigh
ty; their train Is back at Rat River. God
bless that man," stammered Barnes Tra
cy, wiping his forehead feverishly: "he's
an old operator. He says Bob Duffy Is
missingâ tell Martin. Quick, there isn't
any wreck â quick!"
. "What does Neale say?" cried Double
day with an explosion.
Tracy thought he had told them, but
he hadn't. "He says his engineer. Aba
Monsoon, was scared by the moon ris
ing Just as they cleared Kennel Butte."
explained Tracy unsteadily. "He took
It for the headlight of Special 32S and
Jumped from his engine. The fireman
backed tha train to Rat Riverâ see?"
While Tracy talked. Mailers at the
key was getting it all. "Look here," 1*Â»
exclaimed, "did you ever hear of such
a mlx-up in your life? Tha head brake
man of the freight was in the cab. Neale
says. Ha and the engineer were talking
about tha last Conclave train, wonder
ing where they wero going to meet It.
when tha brakeman spied the moon
coming up around Kennel Butte curve.
There's tho S2& Special!' he yelled, and
lighted out tha gangway. Monsoon re
versed and Jumped off after him so
quick ha knocked tha fireman over In
the coal. When tha fireman r;ot upâ ha
hadn't heard a word of It allâ ha
couldn't sea anything ahead but tha
moon. So ha stops the train and backs
up for tha two guys. When Neale- and
ha picked them up they ran right back
to Rat River for orders. They never
got to Rock Point at allâ why. they
never got two miles east of Rat River."
"And Where's Special 320?" cried
Doubleday.
"At Rock Point, you loco. She must
be there and waiting yet for Third
Eighty. The stopping of tha freight gava
her plenty of time to make the meeting
point, don't you see, and there she Isâ

fray to help do up the mangled Knights

"Not to-night," announced Tracy with
the dignity of a man temporarily la

A yell went out of the room like a tidal
wave. Doubleday and Benedict Morgan
had not spoken to each other since tha
night of the roundhouse fireâ that was
two years. They turned, wonder-struck.

catching the news from the rattle of
young Glddlngg, went wild trying to re
peat it to Duffy without losing it In his
throat. The chief was opening his eyes,
try-Ins to understand.
Engineer Monsoon was a new man, who
had been over the division only twice be
fore in his life, both times In daylight.
For that emergency Abe Monsoon was
the man of all others, because it takes
more than an ordinary moon to scars a
thoroughbred West End engineer. But
Monsoon and his moon headlight had be

the scrap.
Bucks cot the whole thing when Do
Molay Four reached Rat River that night.
Bucks and Callaban and Moore and Oys

grimly. Nobody else on Special C6 even
dreamed of leaving a bone that Sunday
night In the Cinnamon cut. All the rest
of the evening Bucks smiled Just the sams
at the Knights and Knightesses. and they
thought him for a bachelor wonderfully
entertaining. -r
A month later, when the old boys, mora
or less ragged, came straggling back from
Frisco, Bucks' crowd stayed over a train,
and he told his Pennsylvania cronies what
they bad slipped through In that delay
at Rock Point.
"Just luck." laughed one of the Eastern
superintendents, who wore on his watch
chain an enormous Greek cross with "Our
trust Is In God" engraved on it. ' "Just
luck." ha laughed, "wasn't It?"
"May be." murmured Bucks. looking
through the Wickiup window at the Teton
peaks. "That Isâ you might call It that
back on the Penn. Out here I guest they'd

That tribunal upon the hearing decided:
Firstâ That the Territorial Governor was
vested by the organic act with the power
to pardon, but not with any power to
commute, and that the commutation of
sentence to imprisonment for life was in
valid. (
The Attorney General of the new State,
noting the departure of Janes, began- to
make it troublesome for the Warden
who had permitted him to go and that
functionary, who had some doubts as to
the legality of his action, wrote to Janes
requesting him to return. The liberated
man did so and proceedings were at once
instituted to determine the legality of his
Imprisonment by the issuance of a writ
of habeas corpus by the Supreme Court
of Nevada.
The existence of this pardon was kept
quiet for political reasons until after the
Senatorial election. On the day that it
was to take effect the Warden released
Janes, who thereupon departed for Cali
fornia.
A man named Janes shot and killed in
a saloon In Virginia City, Nev., a bar
keeper named Dowd. The quarrel grew
out of a semi-religious discussion and the
Influence of the Celtic population was di
rected successfully to aid in the punish
ment of the offender. He was convicted
of the murder in the first degree, and, as
was supposed, sentenced to death. Be
fore the time arrived for his execution
James W. Nye, then Governor of Nevada
Territory, commuted the sentence to im
prisonment for life in the penitentiary at
Carson City. A month or two afterward
the State constitution . was adopted and
Nevada was admitted to the Union. The
Territorial Governor was authorized to
act e/ Governor of the State until the
succeeding first of January. During this
Interregnum Nye issued an absolute par
don to Janes, to take effect the succeed
ing February.
So Balrd could never love any one but
a beauty! She , carefully refrained from
asking herself why this should ; pique her
particularly; since her plainness had never
interfered with their friendship, "Â¦< and he
spent far more . time with her than with
any of the pretty girls of their set.; Stillâ
"Well, I don't care," she said aloud,' as,
glancing at the clock, she arose and be-
"Perhaps you are right," was the mild
reply, and the conversation drifted to
other and safer subjects. But there was
a speculative look In Barbara's eyes for
the rest of the afternoon, which would
have told a careful - observer that she
was .turning some plan over in her mind.
Her usual hour of rest ' before dinner
she spent lying at full length on the divan
in her room, with her hands clasped un
der her head and her eyes fixed on the
open fire, thinking.
There was more heat in his tone than
he liked, but he wasn't able to suppress
it. Somehow he didn't enjoy being made
to feel that he was not at all like her
Ideal man â even* though they were noth
ing but friends. â¢
Dunham was but five feet six, and
though he was well knit and substantial,
with a clean-bred look that was in itself
a recommendation, he was a trifle sensi
tive on the score of the six additional
Inches of height that he felt should have
been his. ' >â¢â¢;;<Â¦ Â¦
"A man's appearance Isn't of much con
sequence," he observed, somewhat stiffly.
"His field Is action. It is what he is,
rather than how. he looks."
Dunham â¢ glanced at her quickly. For
one startled moment he half thoughtâ
but no, Barbara was too good a fellow to
give a man a fleck on the raw like that.
It was a mere coincidence.
"You are right," she agreed, . with im
personal candor. "All women should be
beautiful." There was a sliught pause, a
hesitation Just marked enough to give
force to the conclusion of her sentence.
"Just as all men should be big and
strong!"
These were the questions she asked her
self hotly, but her voiceâ that low, vibrant
voice that thrilled one with Its rich differ
ence from other voicesâ betrayed In its
full evenness no trace of the resentment
that surged within her. s
"She's a beauty, all. right," Barbara de
cided, as she kissed her in greeting and
conducted her to her .room, and, .though
she "kept up her part of their animated
talk about old times and old friends, her
eyes feasted themselves upon Amy's love
liness. The latter's most ordinary move
ment was endowed with a ;. grace ', that
made Barbara - half believe .that beauty
was the only thing after all. When other
girls lifted their hands and removed their
hatpins it was an action - scarce worthy
of notice. But when Amy's arms went up
with a languid grace and her rather large
but beautifully molded hands, . with their
long, tapering fingers, drew forth a glit
tering pin and removed her hat. Barbara
felt vaguely that she was witnessing a
riteâ that she was seeing a poem.
But after a few days of her companion
ship the , glamour was always bedlmmed.
The eyes were feasted,' to be sure, but the
mind and heart were starved. ;, One wear
ied of heir rose-like, . fluttering 'color and
the : amiable but ..' unmeaning, smile,*, and
even ', of the very ';Â¦' perfect - rows ' of teeth

than all other things put. together!
"A few weeks of Amy. will be good for
him," she soliloquized as she went on
with her. dressing. Then, when she .was
ready for dinner, she sat down at her
desk and wrote a letter to her 1 former
schoolmate â the beauty of her class â urg
ing her to make her a long promised visit.
In the course of a. week or two the In
vitation had been accepted and Miss Av
enll arrived. That she was a beauty was
a fact as self-evident as that the sky is
blue (when it is so). It was a fact that
admitted of no difference of opinion.

thing from him before, but to-day for
the first time her patience gave way
utterly.. Apparently, all sense of her
womanhood had been sunk in their com
radeship. Instead of rejoicing in this
state of affairs, a feeling of injury out
rage â suddenly flared up in her heart.
Did he think that because her fea
tures were lregular and her complexion
dull. she was a girl who did not need to
be reckoned with? , Did he suppose she
was the less a woman because she was
plain?. Had he no Idea of the sting In
the remarks he was forever ' making
about feminine beauty? .
He paused and turned toward his
companion with a waiting, /expectant
look, as if he wanted to be sure that
she understood, and she answered the
unspoken question of his glance with
a slow smile that did not betray, by so
much as a flicker, the warm, .' reproach
ful, woman wrath in her heart. -

therein, he had more than once confided
to her that never could he fall in love
with a woman who was not a beauty.
"I can't exactly explain how I feel
about it," he said one day as they sat
together in an art gallery, where his
worshiping eyes- returned ever and
again to a pictured face of rare beauty
that looked down upon them from the
warm, red walls. "It isn't that I think
they are the most fascinating. Wit
and beauty * are not too fond of each
other's company. Besides, the most
attractive woman I've ever known was
ugly â so ugly x that at first she made
you gasp. After that â well, she was
your criterion of charm. . When you
left her. things became stale and life
less. All the color and sympathy went
from the scene. You simply hungered
for her."

at all I" pouted Mis3 AvexilL "I've spoken
If she had spoken all of her thoughts
perhaps she might have added: "So sweet
that at the end ot a month you will want
to kill her, or do something desperate and
outrageous.? But with .:Â¦ a commendable
self-restraint she banished this unruly
Idea to the dark chamber of unspoken
thoughts.
In the weeks :that followed she effaced
herself, pushing Amy Into Dunham's so
ciety, in every possible way, but doing It
so gradually and skillfully that he scarce
ly realized how little he was seeing of his
friend and comrade. ' If she saw: less of
him, however, she saw more of Jack Les
ter, whose companionship was a grateful
balm, because he was not forever talking
about beauty, however much he may have,
admired it.
At first Balrd haunted the house like a
spirit, while his plans for Miss Averill's
entertainment fairly tumbled over each
other In their eagerness. These plans, of
course, n 1 ways included Barbara, but
with a masterly skill she withdrew from
them more and more, until almost before
Baird realized what had happened, he no
ticed that he and Miss Averill were usu
ally, alone. With Miss Averill's exquisite
profile beside him, however, he was not in
a mood to complain. .
"Then, about the middle of the fourth
week, his soaring spirit suddenly touched
earth. He was guilty of a brutal, hereti
cal : thought. Right in the middle of a
long afternoon that they were to spend
together he was seized by a great weari
ness. For the life of him 'he could, think
of nothing to say. , He was bored! -
He stared at the beautiful Miss Averlll
with a sort of stupid wonder. It seemed
Incredible that the society of so exquisite
a creature should be so uncommonly like
muggy weather.' It seemed an age since
he ' had had a good, bracing Â¦ talk with
Barbara.; Now that he thought of It, Bar
bara must be seeing a 7 good deal of that

In the early days of Colorado the bench
"Scold me some other time, dearest,"
to you. twice and you haven't even heard
mo. It isn't nice of you."
"Ehâ what?" exclaimed Dunham, trying
to call his roving thoughts together and
insisting upon hearing the remark he had
Inadvertently missed.
"I asked if you don't Ithlnk the Waldorf
is lovely? I think it's Just sweet."
"Yes," assented he recklessly, "that ex
presses It sweetly. It's just sweet," and
he cast about In his mind for some ex
cuse by which the - hours that stretched
before them might be shortened.' He felt
precisely as he had once In his childhood,
when he had surreptitiously bought and
eaten six charlotte russes.
Miss Averlll confided to Barbara that
night that she didn't like Mr. Dunham so
well as she thought she did.
- "He's so dull! Don't you think so?"
she demanded.
"There have been times when he seemed
so," Barbara confessed airily. Then she
wondered If Balrd's ears were aflame?
Three days later the radiant Miss Aver
ill's visit came to an end. Soon afterward
Dunham dropped in to see Barbara, quits
in his old manner.
"Ah, this Is good," he said gloatingly,
as he sank into the depths of bis favorite
chair. "There's so 'much talk to make
up," he went on In genial enjoyment,
"that I scarcely know where to begin."
Barbara turned her head to one side and
surveyed him with half-closed eyes.
"We might begin with feminine beauty."
she suggested helpfully. "There's' so
much to be said about It."
A pause followed in which several new
Ideas entered Dunham's mind. Then he
demanded, not without a conscious sense
of guilt: *>
"Just what do you mean?**
He leaned forward and studied her face,
and though she flushed under his keen
scrutiny her eyes looked back at , himâ
proud,. unwavering and a bit defiant..
"I certainly admire beauty." . he . began
softly. "But I take back what X have
said about falling In love with one. You
see, little girl, I'm so used to you that the
beauties bore me." .
. "Really," "she scoffed, "for a worshiper
of the fair!"
But a. pair of strong arms were about
her and a rueful voice pleaded:
or eight men who became lost in the
snows. They camped and made a com
fortable shelter, but their supply of pro
visions after a few weeks gave out.
Packer, who was the most experienced
hunter in the party, went one day to try
and find a deer.
Returning late in the afternoon without
success, he was met by a German, who

Judge Geary had a friend and admirer,
a sort of barroom Boswell, who made it
his business to chronicle and laud the
acts of his Judicial friend. Packer at his
first trial was sentenced to death, as al
ready-stated, and in the Howlers' Resort
that evening the Judge's admirer stood
up the crowd against the bar, and gave
his version of thÂ» sentence.
Packer was taken to the military hos
pital, and a party was dispatched to the
tcene of the tragedy. Berore their re
turn Packer recovered, and. not being de
tained, was found missing one mornlnj.
A few days later the military party- re
turned. They found the cams, but they
also found evidence that Packer's tale
was not true and that he had undoubt
edly murdered and robbed his companions.
Nine years later Packer was discovered
in a mirJnsr camp in Montana, and was
arrested and returned to Colorado for
trial on a charge of murder. In the
meantime great mineral discoveries had
been made In the mountains, a county
had been created within\whose bounda

crime. This county was attached to the
Judicial circuit over which Judges Geary

In half an hour a notary appeared with
a complaint which had been prepared
for the occasion, averring that the Hornet
Company was the owners and in pos
session, etc This was passed through the
crevice in the door to Peel, who signed
It and Ewore to it as superintendent of
the Hornet Company and handed It back.
It was filed and served within an hour
and before nightfall a force of honest
miners, with picks and pistols, were at
work for the Hornet Mining Company.
The other company could, of course,
have commenced an action In ejectment,
but the suit in equity had precedence
and would have been first tried and so
the case was compromised.
Peel and his party were camped below
town, on their way to Montana, when my
client engaged his "professional" ssr
vices at a contingent fee of JoOQ. lor
which eum Peel agreed to take posses
sion of the Hornet mine and hold it for
twenty-four hours. Mr. Peel declined any
Assistance in his undertaking, avowing
that he could do the job better alone than
with his company. He required an ap
pointmentâwhich was duly made â as su
perintendent of the Hornet Mining Com
pany. Thus equipped he strolled leisure
ly to the tunnel entrance -where the guard
called cut to him: "Here, you can't go
In there; It's agin' the company's orders."
"Not agin' rat." replied Peel, continuing
his walk. "I'm hired to take Dan Bar
low's place on the shift, and I'm, goin*
In to see the boss." The guard hesitated,
but offered no further resistance to
Peel's movements. Arriving at the end
of the tunnel unnoticed. Peel placed his
back acalnst the wall and cried out to
the miners, "Hold on, boys, I have some
thing to read you." Pulling a paper from
his pocket he rapidly read his appoint
ment as superintendent of the Hornet
Company. "Now, boys," said he pleas
antly, "those of you that want to work
for the Hornet Company can go to the
office any time this week and sign the
roll call and when I want you I will let
you know. In the meantime the same pay
you are setting from the jumpers you
can draw from us. Just at present you
can all get out. Hold up your hands, all
of you, and keep them up. Bill Mullen,
don't reach for your gun, unless you are
looking for a Coroner's inquest. Come,
Â¦tart now; I am sroing- to count twenty,
and then I shall begin ehooting at any
man remaining in this drift. To those
as don't know me I will remark that my
name Is Fanner PeeL One, two, threeâ"
Before the word twenty was reached the
tunnel was empty, the big plank door
closed and barred' and a email blue flag,
the signal that Peel held the mine, flut
tered from a crevice In the door.
"Farmer" Peel was a chivalrous desper
ado of the period. He had eliminated
several rival "bad men" from the scene
cf human activities, but In doing so had
always kept the law on his side. To give
the other man the first shot was an act
not unattended with immediate danger,
but It was Peel's unwavering custom, and
proof of his observance of it had always
secured his discharge by t.Â»e examining
magistrate. There was no Instance oa
record of the other man ever taking a
second shot at Peel, for the latter was
quick and deadly in him aim.
Vet to do this it was essential that the
plaintiff must be isi possession of the Â«.i:s
pured premise* at the time of instituting
proceeaings. In his complaint he was re
quired to state that he was the owner
and in possession of a certain mine; that
the defendant asserted that it belonged
to him; that defendant's claim was un
founded; that the assertion of it injured
plaintiff; that tii-fendant be required to
come into court and show his pretended
right, and that it then be decreed that
plaintiff was owner, and that defendant
hau no rights If the plaintiff was unable
to allege that ht was in possession, he
was cum:>elled to btgin an action in
ejectment, ar.d that meant a jury and
large disbursements.
My clitnt was the owner of the Hornet
mine, situated near Belmont, a mountain
In Eastern Nevada, but possession of the
property was held by a party of jumpers
and the initiatory problem was to obtain
possession so as to be able to institute
an action to quiet title. The work done
upon the mine was by a tunnel, which
had been driven in upon the ledge, about
SOU feet. Entrance to the tunnel was pro
tected by a heavy plank door, which was
Always closed and bolted when men were
not at work. There were two shifts of
tight men, each employed at dihiercnt
places in the tunnel.
After the adoption of the State Govern
ment the Judges were â as a rule to which
there were exceptionsâ honest, while Ju
ries, often composed of nomads and ad
venturers, were sometimes willing to ba
bribed, and it was therefore an object to
an lntencing litig-ar.t. If he had the rijht
eide of thÂ« case, to bring his action In
equity.

But when his heart was heaviest, he saw a little hole. .
And through it in the dead of night he quietly, cautiously stole.
He ran back to the market place, but alas! to his surprise
He could not see one friend of old with all his many eyes.
"There's nothing left for me to do," he thought in deepest pain,
"But to wander back to the dear old patch and start to grow again."
He trudged away to his garden home and crept into his hole

He was placed in a dish of china which contained the richest cream
And was told that he'd be eaten up, which he thought was very mean.

And poor Berry, all a-tfembling, thought he aaw hia hour of doom,
But when the heartless man smacked hia lips and flashed his eyes.
Little Berry fleetly dashed away, to the big man's- great surprise.
He jumped to the floor from the table high and scampered at hot pace
Not resting till he'd gone a mile from the man's fine Queen Anne place.

HEARST TO ESTABLISH
LOS ANGELES NEWSPAPER
SUISUN, Oct. 10.â From present Indica
tions it looks as though Solano County
would at no distant day be covered by a
web of electric railway lines. Surveys are
now being made for the construction of
an electric road from Benicia to Vallejo,
thence westward to Napa. This road will
be built and operated by a syndicate of
capitalists of Vallejo and Los Angeles.
J. E. Woolley, an English capitalist,
who has extensive property Interests In
this county, has applied to the Board of
Supervisors for a franchise to construct a
like railway from Suisun to Vacaville and
Dixon. thence to the Yolo' County line.
This line "would .pass through the great
fruit belts of Suisun and Vaca valleys
and through the prosperous and thickly
settled grain-growing section in the
northern part ' of the county. With the
construction of these railway lines a large
portion of the county would be supplied
with convenient means of .transportation.

coast that he has made ; sweeping; reduc

Another and Important reduction , was
accomplished after several days' confer
ences between the representatives, of the
operating and traffic, departments. Their
meetings, it was given out, were for the
purpose of , considering a "few minor
changes" in the train schedules, but the
fact -that these changes were in the main
for the purposes of economy was not sug
gested by the officials.
Yesterday % this new,, time schedule [was
made public; through the Oakland office of
the company. There it was given out that
because of the Immense amount of freight
being sent ; East by Calif ornla producers;
and for the further reason that the orders
for cars placed Eastern t firms : can
not be filled promptly, the company â¢ had
been compelled^ In order. to gain trackage
and . power ; for/ the to make, the
change in ;thet schedules of " many ; of its
passenger"' trains. _ In'j some cases it , had
dedded;to take the trains off the run tem
porarily, and 'in othersi for good.
.Among! the; trains; dispensed with are
numbers ,41 * and i 42, between >PortT Costa
and Tracy ;B1 ; and 52, between Tracy and
Los Banos;-139 and 140, between Gait and
lone ; 19 . and^20, J between Sacramento and
Willows: Â¦; 23 fand . 24. V between iMarysville
and , El Paso ; ' 46; and 39; '; between ? Oakland
and : Ban ' Jose,; and 13 , to : Reno, and Â¦ some
of the locals on the coast line. Â¦Â¦; * : '
LOCALS ABANDONED.
While this curtailment was being
planned the operating department found
another opportunity for a cut of forces,
and an order went out dismissing numer
ous assistants along the coast route. Even
the night station agents along the coast
division, whose duty it Is to report trains
as they pass in the night, work for which
they receive but a meager salary, were
given to understand that their services
were no 1 longer needed by the company.
Jt was only about two weeks ago that a
night station was created at Menlo Park,
and one of the first to receive his notice
of dismissal was the new agent at that
point.
Some weeks ago a large force of men
was discharged from the shops at Sacra
mento, and yesterday It was common talk
around the railroad building that a .num
ber of men in the repair shops on Ken
tucky street are doomed to decapitation. â¢
The reduction of the force on the o.thier
branches of' the* western system Is pro
portionately as large as that on the coast
division, and will prove a serious, blow to
the men, who' find lfhard to secure lucra
tive employment as the winter months
approach: i^Vf; : Â»'
In the maintenance of way department
It was decided to lay off 100 men employed
on the construction of the double track
south of the city. The carpenter force in
the local shops of the same department
was next to suffer, thirty-five men being
declared off the roll. Apparently the cut
in this department . was not sufficiently
deep to. please General . Manager Krutt
schnitt, for soon after three working
trains were laid off on this side of the
bay. This means that three crews of four
men each will be Idle. As another means
of economy It was decided not to recon
struct the recently destroyed freight shed,
find it Is probable that' this decision will
result in the removal of a number of oth
er mechanics.
Among the first payrolls of the company
to receive a scrutiny was that of the
coast division along which men by the
score have been marked for dismissal.
The majority of these changes will take
effect to-morrow and the others will fol
low as soon as the company sees its way
clear to drop the men. One of the first
moves made was to consolidate the posi
tions of two train dispatchers and a train
master' 'on the narrow gauge system,
throwing all the duties of the three
places on the shoulders of the latter of
ficial, ""thus saving to the company the
salaries of two dispatchers. Then the po
sitions of traveling, conductors along the
divisions were scratched 'off the pay roll
and growing more reckless in the use of
their blue 'pencils, the chiefs of the oper
ating department turned their atten
to the recently created positions of train
agents, j They were promptly abolished,
saving to the company something llkr
$2000' a month.
WOBKINO TRAINS OFF.
Mindful of the fact that the business, of
the Southern Pacific Company, according
to Its own records,, has been Increasing
steadily at the rate of about 1000 cars of
freight per month above the same num
ber of the corresponding month of the
previous year, it was but natural that
Manager Agler, the division superintend
ents and the heads of important depart
ments, like the maintenance of" way,
should receive their Instructions with sur
prise. There was no alternative but to
obey them and in a few days they were
closeted together devising ways of re
duction.
CUT ON COAST LINE.
The keen-edged ax of the general man
ager of tha Southern Pacific Company Is
swinging fiercely along the Western ays
tern of the corporation. An order for re
trenchment on a scale unknown of before
In the history of the company has gone
forth from General Manager Krutt
schnltt's office and Is being followed most
rigidly by the managers and superintend
ents of the different departments. - \
It was learned yesterday that within a
few days between 250 and 300 men will be
discharged from the various positions
along the coast division and the services
of proportionate numbers employed on
the other lines' running out of this city
will be dispensed with. In all it is ex
pected that the present force of men In
the employ of the road on its California
lines will be decreased at least 1200.
For several days the heads of the vari
ous'departments of the Western system
have been holding secret meetings in this
city. Yesterday it developed that these
meetings were the result of a conference
held several weeks ago with General Man
ager Kruttschnitt, at which he informed
his assistants that retrenchment must be
gin at once and that every working force
on the company's lines must be cut to the
lowest possible number.

During the last year more than eighty
students have registered at the Normal
School in this city and out of that number
there was not a single man. so it would
appear that the supply of male teachers
is not up to the demand and that tha
prospects of having: the number lncrea*Â«4
are not at all bright.
Among the principal speakers were Dr.
Jordan and Professor Dcnlway of Stan
ford University. Professor Richardson of
the University of California and Profes
sor Murdock of this city. The subject of
having more men teachers In the ranks
was taken up and discussed. It was
unanimously agreed that the subject was
a complex one and at the present time

MANILA, Oct. 10.â The steamer Victo
ria, on which the defaulting officials Her
man and Johnson made their escape from
Cagayan, Mindanao, has returned to that
port without the fugitives. Arming them
selves with rifles, revolvers and carrying
a supply of provisions, they took to the
woods. when Nerroe, an Island of the Vis
rdjas group, was reached. The captain
reports that when the missing officials
ordered him .to make a landing at Ba
yauan, in Negros Oriental, for water
and fuel, he ran the vessel ashore and
told them It would take several days to
float her. Upon learning this the men at
once proceeded to load up with supplies
of food, ammunition ' and money and
itarted for Negros Occidental. â¢'
The captain aays further that the presi
dent of Bayauan refused to arrest the
fugitives wben asked to do . so, and that
by this time they, must have attained Â¦Â¦ a
long start ahead of the pursuing officers
and are probably now "well into the moun
tains. Reinforcements, will at. once be"
dispatched from " Hollo to" join in the
ucarcb for the runaways.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The Financier
says: One notable feature of the official
statement . of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the unexpected net
increase of $2,739,800 in cash, an amount
not only much' greater than that which
was looked for as the result of the trace,
able movements of* money for the week,
but a little over $1,000,000 more than the
total of the estimated gains -in cash for
the fortnight. So great a discrepancy In
this Item of cash cannot be accounted for
on the theory that it was due to the aver
age system, and therefore it must be,at
tributed to the derangements of the bank
statement Incident . to the merger last
week of the Western National Bank of
the United States with the National Bank
of Commerce, which merger also tended
to derange other items in the statement.
The loans were increased by tho insig
nificant sum of $135,400, whereas more de
cided changes were expected. Deposits
increased only $400,700, an amount less by
$1,276,000 than the sum of Increase In loans
and* the net gain* in deposits, this sum
calling for. an Increase of $1,576,700 in the
last named Item. Therefore the'statemeht
did not balance. ':"Â¦
The reserve required as the result of
the gain in deposits was $100,175, deducting
which from the net gain ; in cash left
12,639,625 as the increase in the' surplus re
serve of $16,577,125. This is not only great- 1
er, by $15,048,775 than the surplus of a year
ago, but larger by almost ! $10,900,000 than
that . recorded ; In the week ' of- last year
corresponding with the current week, 'and
only $1,200,000 less than the surplus, on
October ' 25, 1902, when the Â¦ reserve began
to-be decidedly affecfed by. the relief
measures which had , then , been ~ ; in
augurated by Secretary Shaw. Computed
upon the basis. of deposits, less those of
KC.5G9.300 of public funds, the surplus now
is $25,794,450. The : circulation increased

capitalization of corporations is one \ of
the least heinous offenses found in the
list laid at the doors of the leaders of
the great inflation of the last few years.
False representations of .values and
earning power, reckless diversion . of
credits of institutions to promotion pur
poses and secret ! pooling agreements to
assure the first market for the securities
of insiders under manipulation of paid
market managers are j some of the . inci
dents brought within the range ; of the
charges. The result has^ been a feeling of
profound distrust. among the whole ,. class
of shareholders In new industrial securi
ties and suspicion of motives and methods
in quarters which have been followed
with ' unmixed ' confidence. The force of
these considerations has been 'sufficient to
overcome any favorable factors. -in the
situation. : .The ' dread ; of a. 1 money: strin
gency has definitely passed away and ' a
growing activity '. In the market. for mer
cantile paper has ' followed, relieving any
fears of a contraction of i supplies for
regular commercial I purposes. Borrowers
who have supplied themselves .with extra
funds in fear of stringency find their pre
cautions unneeded and are reloaning, thus
relaxing the extra demand and leading to
freer offerings by regular traders. The

Governor Dockery, who arrived to-day
from Jefferson City, to-night made the
following statement : concerning . ,W." A.-
Morrow, his private - stenographer, who
has been indicted " in connection with
charges of naturalization frauds.
I shall not ask for Mr. Morrow's resignation,
and I would not accept it if tendered. I have
known him for years and for nearly three years
I have been in intimate and confidential rela
tions with him. There haa not been an act,
a word or hint by him during that time incon
sistent with the highest sense of personal and
public honor and rectitude.
Of the facts Involved I have no personal
knowledge, but I have a strong: and abiding
faith and conviction that he is innocent of the
charge against him.
charging fraud in connection with the
naturalization of foreigners during the
election of 1900 were, returned yesterday,
were arraigned before Judge Adams of
the United States Circuit Court to-day.
Both entered pleas of not. guilty. Mor r
row's bond was fixed at $22,000. JohnS.
Elliott of Booneville, Harvey W. Salmon
of Clinton and F. J. Wade of St. Louis
qualified as sureties. Morrow- came to
St. Louis from Jefferson City to-day vol
untarily.
Barrett, who was already under indict
ment on the charge'of abetting.naturaliz
ation frauds, was required to give an ad
ditional . bond of $24,000. This bond was
signed by Murray Carelton, president of
the St. Louis Transit Company, immedi
ately after the bonds were certified.
Judge Adams took charge of the indict
ments, notifying the clerk that under no
circumstances must their contents be
made public. The trial of Morrow was set
for. November 3. Barrett will be -tried
about the same time.'*

INDICTED MEN
ARE ARRAIGNED
This spirit of irritation over conditions
of promotion and flotation is enormously
aggravated - by the disclosures contained
in the testimony In regard to the United
States Shipbuilding fiasco. The tone of
much of the discussion in the neighbor
hood of the Stock Exchange during the
past -week has been of i a bitterness and
scope that Wall street heretofore has re
garded as . narrow and prejudiced when
coming from outside surces. Heavy over-
But the prevailing topic In- Wall^ street
has been the irritation and disgust of
shareholders over; the developments re
garding the properties. in which they have
embarked their money, leading . them to
abandon hope of better conditions and to
throw ever their holdings for what they
would bring. The reduction of 'the divi
dend on United States Steel from 1 per
cent to a 2 per cent basis was the first of
these developments. The long downward
course of this stock in the market seemed
a sufficient intimation of what was to
come. But the fact' remains that a com
mon expectation In speculative circles
was disappointed, as it was supposed that
the retention of the dividend involved a
policy connected with the formation of
the corporation which would not be de
parted' from while funds were available
for the distribution. The wisdom of this
policy 'came in for criticism when the
corporation announced its bond issue and
the necessity for Increased working cap
ital which prompted the bond issue. In
view of the partial failure of the bond of

SHIPBUILDING FIASCO.
OUTPOURING OF r SECUBITIES.
Developments during the week have re
sulted in a new outpouring of securities
on the market and an almost entire pa
ralysis of demand- for the stocks most
largely pressed for sale. The effect has
been a' renewal in the feeling of depres
sion and gloom which always gathers over
W&H street in a period of declining prices.
The liquidation has been of a most dif
ferent character from that of the recent
last,' which "was manifestly forced by
financial necessities due to 'the failure to
find a market for many of the new secur
ities formed out of recent promotion pro-
Ject*. This week the selling is attributed
to distrust on the part of the holders
over the Industrial outlook and over the
future earning. power of share- Incorpora
tions. There has been an occasional ac
count liquidated which seemed .to be
caused by the maturing of â¢ a", loan on
v;hich extension could not be had and f or
wb;ch the collateral therefor came upon
the market. ,
The contest was wholly professional and
not based on any news so far as. known.
London helped the depression here some
what and sold stocks moderately. Fears
are entertained there that next week's
Stock Exchange settlement may uncover
some embarrassment. The tone of the
weekly trade reviews is somewhat con
servative and reflected the state of doubt
which has been caused by the reduction
in United States Steel dividends and the
decline in profits in the iron and steel in
dustries. - The reports of weekly . bank
clearings show sharp contractions as a
whole compared with the corresponding
week of last "Â¦ year. But in the analysis
it is found that the decrease Is wholly
due to shrinkage 'in New York, Boston
and Philadelphia, the four other leading
cities showing considerable increase and
the average for all other cities a small
increase. The market stemed encouraged
by the bank statement and rallied mo
mentarily. The increase in cash was con
siderably larger than expected. But the
statement Is so complicated by the mer
ger operations of the National Bank of
Commerce and the Western National as
to throw It out* of balance. It is Inferred
from tho small loan change that com
mercial borrowing has kept pretty steady
pace with the llauidation on the Btoc't
market. . The market closed easy and
quite active.
-NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â Demand for
stocks was apathetic to-day and left the
market vulnerable to very light selling,
and there seemed to be a professional con
test in the late dealings. The party of
reaction centered their attack on United

This, stock sold* at 58%" last Â¦ month, but
otherwise never' sold before as low as
to-day's price. The . party favoring | sup
port in the market seemed most active
In Amalgamated Copper. That stock re
sisted the ' eeneral depression and' .was

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 10.â District At
torney Seymour has given an opinion to
the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento
County that by the amendment of the
county government act passed by the
last Legislature the so-called ."one
twelfth rule" has been abrogated and that
Supervisors may legally at any time after
the beginning of the fiscal year expend
any sum that does not exceed 70 per cent
of the money placed in that fund for the
fiscal year.
Under this opinion the Supervisors of
Sacramento County have allowed a large
number of bills that had accumulated and
that hitherto had been held up because of
the restriction of the "one-twelfth rule."
This is a matter of interest to Supervisors
and contractors throughout the State.
Sheriff Smith escaped with a few
scratches, but no serious cuts. Thompson
will probably recover. He was at one
time an Inmate of the Mendodno State
Hospital.
He started to get into the Sheriff's bug
gy*. Then he drew a razor, which had
been concealed and which the officers had
overlooked when they searched him. He
cut his throat in two places. Another
tussle resulted before the officers could
secure the razor.
As soon as Sheriff Smith approached
Thompson drew a large pocketknlfe and
rushed at him. The deputies were sum
moned, and after a struggle of several
minutes the maniac was overpowered.
After the officers had secured the knife
Thompson said:
"All right, Smith; I'll go with you."
L'KIAH. Oct. 10.â Sheriff Smith and two
deputies had a desperate struggle with a
crazy man In the Fashion stables this aft
ernoon. Bill Thompson, who has been em
ployed at the Btables, had been acting
queerly, and the Sheriff went to arrest
him with the inetntlon of taking him to
the County Hospital until he could be ex
amined. '?lh"i~

MANIAC FIGHTS
WITH OFFICEHS
OPINION OPENS
COUNTY COFFERS
The recent inspection of the National
Guard is generally spoken of as "Division
Commander Dickinson's inspection," al
though it was on its face the inspection
of the higher office. The results present
ed have caused much criticism, which
calls into question some of the "right out
from the shoulder" blows dealt by
Colonel Koster, the inspector, some
of the officers of equal, rank as
serting that "Colonel Koster doesn't
know as much of military in
spection as he believes he does." Be that
as it may, the ' inspection reports have
awakened the guard to the fact that it
id not up to the standard that warrants
the taxpayers in paying the large amount
yearly to maintain It. It is probable thai
the various organizations will be given n
probationary term and that within a
short time there will be another inspec
tion by some one whose military knowl
edge and ability cannot be attacked and
upon whose report will hang the fate ol
a number of the companies.
An effort will be made to have the va
rious organizations assume the attitude oi
the Ideal soldier when on duty and avoid
the slouchy appearance that nearly every
company presents when at drill in the
armory or on parade on the street. More
attention ijteo be paid to the setting uj
exercise, srks to relieve the men of thai
tired feeling. But little attention has been
paid to these exercises, which tend sc
much to make the soldier have a mili
tary bearing that commands attention,
with the result that about nine-tenths oi
the men In the ranks present , an unpre
possessing appearance and many of there
look as if they . were ready to fall apart
Not only is this noticeable in the com
pany flies but in the "officers, some o!
whom are stoop shouldered, giving their
a most ungainly appearance. An effori
will be made to have setting up exer
cises fifteen minutes on drill night twict
a week. â¢
The indications are that during the cur
rent weekjAdjutant General George Stone
will retire from the position he has held
for eomo time in the National Guard of
California and that his successor will be
nominated by Governor Pardee. In addi
tion to Charles Jansen, commander of
Troop A, Colonel "W. J. Schreiber of the
Seventh Infantry Is named as a possible
successor to General Stone, but it is no
sure thing that either of these two will
be the successful man, although several
weeks ago there was every possibility of
Captain Jansen being placed in the posi
tion that would enable him to draw down
a yearly salary of $3000. The knockers*
club has been at work with its large and
small hammers to In3ure tho chances of
the two named. A strong effort is being
made to retain Colonel N. S. Bangham
in the office of assistant adjutant general
and to find one who will accept the ad
jutant generalship with Colonel Bangham
as assistant Is a matter that worries the
Governor not a little, because the friends
of Colonel Bangham, who are many, make
a strong plea for 'him, while those who
are after the place want the privilege of
nominating the assistant.

Admiral Kempff was highly praised in
the British House of Parliament for his
course of action, 'and a vote of thanks
was passed by the House of Representa
tives of. the United States for his judi
cious conduct
notice, of late years by his attitude at
the time of the bombardment of the Taku
forts. In . opposition to the opinions of
the Russian, German, English, Japanese,
Italian and Austrian admirals, he coun
seled atrainst the attack on the forts,
believing that such action. would tend to.
add more peril to tue positions of the
legations and foreigners In China. He
maintained this attitude until the Monoc
acy was hit by one of the Chinese shells,
and then concluded that this act on the
part of the Chinese warranted reprisal.
Accordingly he joined with the powers in
the subsequent actions.

There is still a great deal of guessing
as to who will succeed General Warfleld

Cody . left Dover for Calais at noon to
day in a collapsible boat drawn by a kite.
A good northwesterly breeze was blowing.
Great interest was manifested in Cody's
attempt to cross the English Channel,
which, however, failed. When a mile and
a half oft shore the navigator appeared
to be in difficulty and he ultimately aban
doned his attempt. After being three
hours at sea the boat was towed back to
Dover. In an interview Cody said the
kite served splendidly until the wind
failed. He is confident he can accomplish
the channel trip.

city that he had. not made a will. Jones
says Miss Webb- also went by. the name
of Mrs. Williams and another name which
he had forgotten, and she claimed to be
long to a family in Kentucky.
, Kohn had a pocketbook under his. pil
low containing $1000 in currency and $2000
in drafts, which Miss Webb. told him she
had taken, as she was without a cent
in the world. The witness expected to
get some change, hoping Miss .Webb
would send him to buy the railroad ticket,
but she sent the bellboy Instead and left
him without a cent.
Jones' statement In reference to the
Jones oh Thursday, , in _ order, to induce
sleep, also gave Kohn a dose, of two -and
a quarter teaspoonsful of dormio. a prep
aration of chloral,, a remedy that had
been recommended ' by Dr. Edwards I of
Corohado Beach last spring. ; He usually
took three teaspoonsful; but -.two -and'; a

She had kept company,. with Kohn be
fore that time, but the witness never un
derstood that she was his wife. Since he
had been In the service of Kohn he had
never been absent long enough from
Kohn for, Kohn to have married any
body. At the date given by Miss Webb,
or Mrs. Kohn, as the time she married
Kohn at Beulah, Wis., Jones said, .Kohn
and he were at a watering place In In
diana. Jones met the woman first at Lake
Beulah last July, when she and Kohn oc
cupied a cottage together there.' They
came to San Francisco through the rec
ommendation of Dr. Shiels for, treatment.
They arrived here on Tuesday afternoon
at 3 o'clock. On Wednesday morning
Kohn's temperature was 102.6, and the
doctors persuaded him to remain in bed
that day, which he did. \ On Thursday
about 3 p. m. he went to. the sanitarium
and Dr. Gedge , told' him that he couid
continue the use of m'orpnine until Friday
morning, when the treatment would, be
begun. Kohn was of a very nervous tem
perament, and for that reason he request
ed Jones to remain, with: him ' 4 untll ; he
went to sleep. Jones administered a hy
podermic dose of one grain- of morphine
before Kohn went to sleep, which was ai
9 o'clock. Jones said he then went to the
Palace Hotel. He did not think that Kohn
committed suicide, because he did not be

Coroner Iceland's office and made a depo
sition in which he says he is a resident
of 2625 Indiana avenue, Chicago, and that
he is a graduated nurse of Bellevue Hos
pital of New York City.
On October 19, 1901, he said, he entered
the service of Abraham Kohn. He -and
his employer left Chicago a week ago last
Friday for the purpose of seeking medical
treatment In this city for the morphine
habit. He understood that Kohn had
been addicted to the use of morphine for
two years before he entered his service.

woman who claims to be the widow of
Kohn made to the Coroner varies mate
rially from that he made to several of
his newly made colored acquaintances in
this city yesterday! To them he said that
the drafts of the dead man had been
turned over early In the day to a local
financial firm and by it shipped by ex
press back to Chicasro.
This plan, the valet intimated, was car
ried out in order to avoid any possible at
tempt on the part of the local Public Ad
ministrator to gain possession of them.
As to the statement that Mrs. Kohn en
gaged a bell boy to purchase her ticket to
Chicago, it can be easily refuted by tha
man who sold it to her at the ferry build
ing and by several persons who witnessed
her purchase the same and sign the name
of Mrs. Kohn at the bottom of the ticket.
One of . the last to bid Mrs. Kohn good
by was Jones, and If he had knowledge
that she was wrongfully in possession of
his late master's funds he made no effort
to regain them.
Mrs. Kohn, Just before she went aboard
the Santa Fe boat, referred to the money
she had taken from Kohn's clothes. She
said that when Dr. Gedge advised her to
proceed Immediately to : Chicago she real
ized that she did not have sufficient money
with her to make the trip and at once
went : to the t dead man's clothes, from
which she took all the gold they pos
sessed, a trifle over $150. She said that the
balance of his money was in drafts.
The woman Is now well on her way to
Chicago, where she will arrive a day in
advance of the body of .the man she says
was her husband." Just what will follow
Is only a matter of speculation, but those
who | were ' slightly -Â¦ acquainted with ' the
young woman believe that -Â¦ her ; relatives
there will see that she is properly repre
sented by . a', lawyer; and her widow's
claims laid before , the courts " In , which
the estate of the deceased young capital
ist is"", to' be settled. .
The refusal of the hospital attendants
to admit that Kohn was dead hours after
it had become known that he had died,
and after Dr. Gedge had so advised the
dead man's relatives in Chicago, is now
said by the hospital attendants to have
been due to instructions issued by Dr.
Gedge, who had charge of the case. The
valet, Philip Jones, on Friday, ten hours
after his master died, visited the hospital
on two different occasions to inquire of
Kohn's condition, and both times he was
informed that his master was improving.
It was not not until long in the afternoon,
after his return from his second visit to
the Adler . Hospital, that Jones learned
that Kohn was dead. E;ven then he was
unable to confirm the news at the hos
pital. Why the valet, who had been at
tending Kohn for two years and had been
the servant of the Kohn family for years
previous, should have been denied the in
formation is as much a mystery as the
other strange incidents attending the
death of the young man at the hospital.
Before starting for the East last even
ing Jones told several persons that it had
been the intention to quietly ship the
body East, but this plan was abandoned
when It was found that the newspapers
were looking into the case. Prior to hid
departure for Chicago Jones appeared at
MYSTERIOUS ATTENDANTS.
-The previous night the doctor gave out
the statement that Kohn's death was due
to tuberculosis. The young woman who
claims to be Kohn's wife, and who was
with him when he died, has made the
statement that her husband passed away
shortly after midnight Friday, over
nine hours before the hour mentioned In
the death certificate.
THE body of Abraham H. Kohn, Â¦
the young Chlcagoan. whose sud- i
den death at the Adler Hospital â¢
early Friday morning has been
Ehrowded in mystery, was started
on its way to his former home last night
Accompanied by Phillip Jones, the former I
valet of the deceased, the body was ship- !
ped on the Central Pacific overland at 6 \
o'clock and with Its departure there was i
closed an incident that for a time prom- j
Ised to develop quite a scandal. '
So far. Dr. Gedge, who treated Kohn at j
the Adler Hospital, where he died, has !
failed to explain the reasons that '
prompted him to make contradictory |
statements concerning Kohn's death and |
to decline to furnish information regard- j
Ing the affair. He still appears in the j
light of making no effort to correct the
public impressions that have been i
formed. Yesterday morning he filed a
certificate of death at the health office, j
in which he sets forth that Kohn died
at 10 o'clock Friday morning, and that
the chief cause of death was morphinism '
and the contributing cause cardiac par
alysi?.

A Few Suggestions That May
Prove of Value.
A Record That Speaks lor Itscilâ Sonic
Prices ca the Renowned DccKcr & Son
Pianos- A Siring ol Used Pianos â
General Pommer-Eilcrs Store News.
You are in doubt as to where to buy a
piano.
You are In do'-bt about which make of
piano to buy.
If a. naa upon whose judgment you can
rely told you that he boug-fat a piano from
POMMER-EILERS MUSIC COMPANi'i
nearly two years agro; if he said that the!
instrument was always perfectly satisfac-
tory; that it had been pronounced a fine
piano by all of his musical friends and
callers; that he had been accorded most
courteous and considerate treatment by
the POMMER-EILERS MUSIC COM-
PANY, and that, last but not least, in
dealing with the POMMER-EILERS MU-
SIC COMPANY he had actually effected
a sartr.Â£ of something like $100 in the
price of . his ' piano, wouldn't this induce
you to come bere for your piano? It cer-
tainly would.
A VAST ARMY OF FRIENDS.
TYa commenced Business here about
twenty months ago.
We shall be fiad to supply you a list of
five hundred business men and â¢women of
San Francisco, all cf whom purchased
their pianos of us eighteen months ago

and women of California who have had
one of our pl&nos for over twelve months,
and there are over 500 who have owned
one of them for over six months. All. we
are sure, will cheerfully verify what we
hsve said in the above.
Would it net pay vou to investigate
this?
Other dealers who are not in position to
openly and fairly compete will permit
themselves to epeak disparagingly of
POMMER-EILERS MUSIC COMPANY,
their methods and their instruments; but
bear in mind that you cannct very well
expect to hear of the good qualities of
our pianos and as to the reliability and
trustworthiness of this firm from dealers
v.'ho have instruments of their own to
sell.
No honest man will dare to dispute the
high class and character of the Instru-
ment* sold by POMMER-EILERS MUSIC
COMPANY.
' If you v.-ili investigate thÂ« matter you
will find that with our facilities we are
in a posltlcn to furnish a better piano for
le?s money than can be obtained from any
other dealer or agency.

.irp sold b\ any other two houses in Cali-
fornia. --..-â¢ I

matter, as the bond issue has been de

hope that the city officials will see fit to
make the street into a boulevard, as the
city is amply supplied with street car

fork in the diagnosis of fractures, espe
cially of the lone bones. The test is
made by placing the bell of a stethoscope

where the soft tissues are as thin as pos
sible, and the handle cf a tuning fork as
close to the bone as possible beyond the
supposed Beat of fracture. The sound will
be transmitted through the shaft of the
bone to the stethoscope and through
the' stethoscope to the cars of the
examiner. When the bone Is intact, If
the test is properly made, the sound o* the
fork will be heard xvith great distinctness,
but if there is a lack of continuity the
sound will either not be Â»heard at all or
will be heard very faintly. By compar
ing the intensity of the sound on the Â«sus

similar conditions on the normal side, the
question of continuity of bone can be de
termined. The test for fractures is based
upon the fact that bone is an excellent
conductor of sound waves, while the soft

The investigations concerning the longi

Paris have now been completed. The work
has been of a particularly arduous and
protracted nature, necessitating enormous
calculations. Altogether the English and
French observers have carried out 230 ob

work each. Two English and two French
observers have been engaged upon thp
task. The observations were made at
Greenwich and Paris simultaneously,
and in order to obtain absolutely similar
results the instruments were frequently
interchanged. The results of these ob
servation have proved both the Greenwich
and Paris existent meridians to be erro
neous, the calculations finally working
out Just between the two. The discrep

The difficulty was solved by John C. Me

an approach that would not necessitate

According to Professor Richards of Le

modern blast furnace are capable of de

suitable gas engines. It is interesting to
note in this connection that the great
Niagara Falls Power Company up to a
few months ago was only developing some
50,000 horsepower by its turbines, and even
now, the power available at three modern
blast furnaces would be capable of pump
ing back again all the water they use.
The principal outstanding difficulty in
utilizing these waste gases lies in the size
of the scrubbers necessary to clean the
gases before passing them into the en
gines. If they are not washed thoroughly
free from tar trouble arises from the
gumming up of the valves.

THE magnitude of the irrigation work undertaken by the Federal Government is just begin
ning to appear. Five great projects are under-way, one |in Nevada, one in Montana, one in
Wyoming, one in Arizona and one in Colorado. In California the Government has just with
drawn from entry in the Colorado Desert 760,000 acres, and last week filed on four' million
inches of water in the Colorado River, to irrigate. The importance: of this is at once seen when it is
known that this filing takes all the water, of the Colorado, not heretofore appropriated, and leaves
none for future private enterprise. This makes it supremely important' for the interests of the State
that this large amount of water be as soon as possible applied to the reserved land, that it may be
opened to the settlement provided for in the irrigation law.
Senator Newlands, the author of the law, says that the Nevada project is farther advanced
than the others. It takes water from the Truckee River in a canal thirty-two miles long, fifty-three
feet wide at the top and twenty-one feet wide at the bottom and fourteen feet deep. It is intended
to carry 1400 cubic feet of water per second, and will irrigate 344,000 acres. The fund to complete all
these works is derived from the sale of public lands, and amounts now to $i6> 197,836.
There has been much discussion about abandoning all State control of water and of irrigation
to the Federal Government. The consensus of opinion on that subject seems to be that such course
is not wise. The example, of Nevada is likely to bs followed. That State has a greater percentage of
public land than any other, as only about 3 per cent of its lands have passed into private ownership.
It would seem that there the Federal Government has a- freer hand than in any other part of the arid
region. Yet Nevada has passed a code of State irrigation laws; supplementing the Federal statute, and
providing for the co-ordination of the two jurisdictions.^
This is a subject of great importance to California, where but little land, comparatively, re
mains in the public domain. Under the law the Federal Government can file on the unappropriated
water of the Sacramento and San Joaquin, as it has on that of the Colorado. But the land that can
be irrigated by the water in those streams so filed is in private ownership. Taking away the water
makes its use for irrigation, by private enterprise, impossible. If the- landowners want the water
they must deal with the Federal Government. It will be seen that, such a situation requires the inter
vention of the State, and we can well afford to follow the example of Nevada in that respect.
The irrigation of the Colorado Desert is of very great importance, since it promises to bring
into action land that will add new. products to the list? of California crops. The Agricultural Depart
ment has conducted a long series- of observations on that desert, covering the chemistry of soils, tem
perature, air dryness and all the physical conditions which' affect production. These observations prove
positively that the region will produce in perfection the most valuable date of commerce, the deglet
noor, the date of light, which is now grown only- on the oases of the Sahara in Northern Africa. The
only requisite is water. When this is supplied the department is prepared to facilitate the supply of
a stock of date palms. At. present this greatest of the dates is transported by. camel caravans across the
desert to Mediterranean ports and is eagerly sought in Europe at a high price. But little of the fruit
reaches this country, as the nearer demand exhausts the supply.
If it is domesticated on the Colorado Desert it will add several -millions a year to our fruit
export and will further notify the world of the wonderful resources of California.

need guidance.
These matters have been in the -hands of the Treasury Department until recently. The crea
tion of the new Department of Commerce has transferred them from the treasury to the new de
partment, and they are now in charge of Secretary Cortelyou. Our mariners and commercial bodies
will find this a, favorable time to secure attention to these needs. They should see to it that the atten
tion of our members of Congress is called to the matter, and should seek, to directly reach Secre
tary Cortelyou. We have here only one lightship. When she needs repairs she is withdrawn from
her station for that purpose and no substitute is provided. The location of this lightship is given on
all the official charts issued to the mariners of the world. Many ships are at sea, en route to San
Francisco, and cannot be notified when the single lightship is. off station for repairs. In the night, or
fog they near our coast, on the lookout for the lightship. A stationary light is mistaken for that of
the ship, and instead of being sixty miles off the coast as the lookout* thinks, a ship may be near the
rocks and in danger of wreck.
There should be two lightships here, so that when one is brought in for any cause the relief
Much is said in Congress and throughout the country about the increase in our Pacific trade.
I It has increased and is increasing, constantly requiring more bottoms and more sailors and greater
I tonnage. But in all deep sea trade is the element of "risk as the coast is approached. If that risk is not
i provided against and reduced, shipowners and shippers will avoid the ports that are less protected for
those that are more protected. When the isthmian canal , is finished we are to have south of us the
stiff. rivalry of San Pedro and north of us that of the Puget Sound ports. In a fight for trade every
thing counts, and when it is sea-going commerce the safety of ' ships is far. from being the least of
the makeweights.
The pilots and the Pilot Commissioners and the association of shipmasters and the marine
underwriters located here can give our Merchants' Exchange and Chamber of Commerce and our
members of Congress much information on this interesting subject, and all concerned should move
! together in the matter.
The betterment of our coast lights, fog signals and buoying is not alone necessary for San
Francisco, but may apply to the whole coast, and the matter needs an expert examination from Alaska
south to Mexico. It is probable that the recharting of part of the coast waters, and especially of the
sound waters of Alaska, will be found necessary. When these conditions between us and rival ports
are equalized, and all have the best provisions for the safety of navigation, commercial rivalry will
be upon a basis of equality in that respect and primacy will depend upon enterprise alone.
WRECKS will occur as long as, men go down to the sea in ships. But the liability of wrecks
x along a coast is reducible to a minimum by proper lights, buoys, fog signals and' light
ships. The sea-going" commerce of California requires for its safety that the. Federal
Government pay more attention to these precautions for the safety of ships on our coast.
San Francisco is especially interested in this. We have powerful and highly enterprising
rivals for the deep sea trade, which has heretofore been attracted to us by the ample harbor and rail
shipping facilities which we enjoy. Any lack of coast lights and other means of guiding mariners
to our port begins to work against us. It is the opinion of shipmasters that, as compared with the
lighting of the ports of New York, Boston and other Atlantic coast points our coast and harbor
lighting is very deficient. In such equipment our coast has had but little improvement in the last
twenty-five" years. There is a lack of .means of identification of our coast lights, so that one is often
mistaken for another, and sailors are left to the mercies of dead reckoning at a time when they most

Auditor Baehr decided yesterday to re
quest the State Board of Equalization for
an additional extension of ten days with
in which to turn over the assessment roll
of the city to Tax Collector Smith.
After the board had raised the assess
ment SO per cent Bae'hr was compelled to
ask for an extension of ten days from
next Monday, the day on which the law
says he shall turn over the books. "The
extension was necessary in view of the
fact that the matter was brought to the
Supreme Court, which has decided that
the State tax rate of 56.1 cents must be
calculated on the valuation of $530,000,000
as increased by the board, and the city's
rate of $1,076 as fixed by the Board of Su
pervisors last June must be calculated on
the valuation as returned by Assessor
Dodge, namely, $420,000,000. By the de
cision the new rate of 84.4 cents as re
enacted by the Supervisors on the third
Monday in September becomes void. -
Auditor Baehr will put nearly 105 men
to work beginning to-morrow extending
the taxes on the assessment â¢ books. He
thinks that with the additional extension
of time which the State Board of Equal
ization can grant, him under the law he
will be enabled to turn over the books to
the Tax Collector before November 1.
Taxes will not be delinquent until the lat
ter part of November.'

Florence May Goddard and Joseph
Charles Goddard were married at Oak
land in April, 1901. They have one child,
aged 4 months. According to a complaint
for divorce filed by Mrs. Goddard their
married life has not j been a happy one
because of the cruelty of her husband.
She charges that he frequently cursed her
and accused her of being an unfaithful
wife and once assaulted her with a knife.
She also charges that a short time ago he
attempted to burn her clothes.
Judge Hebbard granted Mayme I.
Thomas an interlocutory decree of divorce
from Elijah Thomas for desertion and
Judge Sea well granted a similar decree
to Helen L. Marston from Jothan Mars
ton for neglect.
Helen M. Brown wants a divorce from
Wesley W. Brown and permission to re
sume her maiden name, Manning. She
says that for the last year he has com
pelled her to depend upon her own exer
tions and the charity of her friends and
relatives for her supoprt. They were
married in June of last year.
Desertion Is the ground on which Eu
phemla Lautner is suing Cleon E. Laut
ner for divorce. He is foreman of the
works of the California Casket- Company
at S23 Ellis street.
Joseph J. and Viola Rodgers, who were
married at Benlcla in October! 1900, are
not living in peace and harmony. In a
complaint for divorce on the ground of
cruelty filed by Rodgers he says that it
is his wife's fault. He claims that she
has preferred going to the beach and
Cliff House to cooking for him, and says
that when he remonstrated with her she
told him to mind his own business or
consigned him to regions noted principally
for the heat supposed to exist there. She
also told him, he says, that, despite his
objections, she would go "whev she
pleased, as often as she pleased, and stay
as long as she pleased."
SUPPORTS HERSELF.
Gottfreid Schmitt, a tailor, is being sued
for divorce by Kay Schmitt. They were
married in 1S96. Mrs. Schmitt says th^t
last February her husband told her he
had a "good mind to cut her heart out."
She says that as he was holding a large
knife In his hand at the time his threat
was made, Bhe became very much fright
ened and as a result suffered mentally.
Mrs. Schmltt's name was Brownlee when
she married the tailor and she would re
sume that name.
After graduating from the school Mar
guerite went to Seattle. She Journeyed
thither by water and on the steamer on
which she was a passenger she met
Charles J. Mackintosh, the chief engineer
of the vessel. It was a case of love at
first sight, and when the vessel docked
at Seattle Mackintosh had procured the
girl's promise that she would become his
wife. They were wed, and for a time â
a very short time â they were happy.
Then, according to the young woman's
complaint, Mackintosh grew harsh in his
treatment of her. Instead of kind and
loving words, she says, she received only
abuse, and it so affected her that she
became ill in mind and body. This harsh
ness, she avers, continued for months,
ending finally in threats to Injure her.
She left him on the 8th lnsL and returned
to the home of her mother at 1748 l^arkhi
street, where she is now. She says that
even at her own home she Is not safe
from her husband, and she appeals to
the court to protect her. In her com
plaint, filed by Attorney Steven V. Cos
tello. she asks for the issuance of an
order directing Mackintosh to refrain
from visitlne her mother's home, alleg
ing that he has called there and repeated
his threats to do her bodily harm.
Mackintosh is at present employed as
chief engineer of the new ferry-boat San
Jose. His salary, his wife says, is $175
a month, and she prays the court to com
pel him to pay her sufficient monthly ali
mony to defray her living expenses.
FEAES DISSECTION.
"LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
But little more than a year ago Mrs.-
Mackintosh, who Is still In her teens, -was
a pupil at a private school In San Jose.
She was pretty as a picture, bright and
vivacious and of an exceptionally charm
ing disposition. She numbered her friends
by the score, and in conaecuence when
graduation day came and she left the
school to enter upon the duties of life
there were many touching farewells. It
was in May of last year that she left
the convent.
ThÂ« filing of a suit for a divorce yes
terday by Marguerite Mackintosh against
Charles J. Mackintosh is tha commence
ment of the final chapter of a romance
begun on the high seas In May of last
year. It Is also conclusive proof that
there Is considerable truth In the old say
lag that a hasty marriage means leisurely
repentance.

TH5 VALUE OF^CHARCOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health, and Beauty.
Nearlr everybody knows that charcoal is thÂ«
safest and most efficient disinfectant and pur-
ifier in nature, but few realize its value when
taken into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more you taka
of It the better; it Is not a drug at all. but
eimply absorbs the pases and Impurities always
present in the stomach and Intestines and car.
rles them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smokln*.
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
complexion, it whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which collect
tn the stomach and bowels; it disinfects th*
mouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell, charcoal in one form or an-
other, but probably tBo best charcoal and tha
most' for the money Is In Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal. "and other harmless an-
tiseptics in tablet form or rather in tha form
of Urge, pleasant tasting loze&ges. tha charcoal
being mixed with honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will soon
tell in a much Improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath -
and purer blood, and the beauty of it is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinued use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
sorbent Lozengea to all patienU Â«ufterlng from
gas In stomach and bowels, and to clear tha
complexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is greatly bene-
fited by the dally use, of them; ; they cost but
twenty-five' cents a box at drug s tors, and al-
-.hough in KT.e sense a patent preparation, yet
I belie\ a I get mors and better charcoal in
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges than in any of
the ordinary charcoal tablets," *

Ladies and Gentlemen. Citizens of San Fran
cisco:' When a Republican President of the
United States' conies to a. city as fair as! San
Francisco, as beautiful in her surroundings, as
richly endowed with everything .that nature
and Hod himself could contribute to her: where
the workiagtnan Is better fed, Â¦ bstter housed,
better clothed, .better paid, than In any. city
under God's sun to-day (applause), he has a
right to expect that the city's chief executive
is a Republican. (Renewed applause.) Civic
pride, love of our fair coast, endearment to the
surroundings of dear old California should
make every man. woman and child stand by
the organization that from the time of Lincoln's
debates with Douglass up to the present time
has maintained , the grand central . Idea of pro
tection "to American Industry. When I * was
21 years of age my fir3t vote. was cast for the
greatest: labor union organization the earth ha3
ever known (applause), a -union that draws no
distinction of color: a union of labor bo great
and so. grand that party purpose in the words
of the Immortal Lincoln, "Fondly do we hope,
profoundly do. we pray that this bitter scourgo
of war may pass from us; but If God's will Is
that ' It- --continue ''-until every -drop of blood
drawn by the -lash shall be paid by another
drawn by the . sword. . we are in favor of an
honest, a free, an untrammeled union of labor,
no matter what the- color of a man's skin may
be." (ApDlause.) And it is that kind of an
organization that i appeals to fair .San , Fran
cisco in, this "campaign. . .
lican League, opened the. meeting with a
stirring speech. Mr. Riordan was given
the closest attention â¢ and was cheered
throughout/ He spoke as^ follows:
On behalf of the Republican campaign com
mittee it Is both my duty and my pleasure to
extend to you a sincere and a cordial greeting
and also our heartfelt appreciation at the gen
erous response that you have made to-night to
our invitation to assemble here at this. ' the
opening meeting of the Republican campaign.
(Applause.) It Is neither my privilege nor
my desire to-night to discuss with you any of
the vital principles that are involved In the
forthcoming campaign.- -I- may. however,- be
permitted to state to you that in our opinion
this Is and should be and will be a Republi
can year, and that it is essential that -the
men who shall be elected to fill >Â¦ the : various
offices to be voted for at the forthcoming
election be men In whom all, the' citizens and
taxpayers of this community can ; repose the
utmost confidence; men who can - assure them
that the affairs of this municipality during
the forthcoming two years will . be honestly
and faithfully administered.' (Applause.) It in
therefore but meet and proper that you should
have been Invited to meet us to-hlght so that
you may see the gentlemen who were selected
by the last Republican convention r to control
and guide the destinies' of thU municipality
for the next two years, and hear them renew
their pledges to support .the platform adopted
by that convention and all the principles and
policies of the Â¦ Republican party and to as
sure us that during the next two years they
will give this city an honest and an econom
ical administration. /â¢We ' confidently .believe
and we beg to assure, you that' we* think the
men who were nominated 1 for the various .offi
ces at the lant convention fulfill to the ut
most extent all these requirements : and Â¦â¢ that
they will honestly and conscientiously admin
ister the affairs of â¢thla-.mnnicipallty during
the ensuing term. ."We also Â¦ assert, but w*
believe. our assertion Is not necessary, that th<Â»
gentleman Mr. Henry J. Crocker (cheers), who
has b*en selected to pilot us to victory on
November's and who will bring victory to the
Republican 'banner at. the -next election. Is a
man In Â¦ whom every voter and taxpayer In
this community can Â¦Â¦ repose confidence and be
sure that when he dons- the Mayor's toga
after the first Monday In January he will give
to this city, as honest, aa conscientious, m
faithful and efficient an administration as
this city has. ever had. (Applause.) We can
also assure, you that Mr. Henry J. Crocker
will fulfill the pledges and will fulfill the
wishes of the voters who voted for, the bond
issue in September and will see . that that
money Is expended so that this, our beautiful
city will be a' newer/a better and a'rreater
San' Francisco. (Applause.) f I '
And now ladies, and gentlemen. I. havÂ« the
honor of Introducing to you a gentlemanf who
needs no introduction, who will act as chair
man â¢ of > the evening.' - the Hon. George A.

Â«
publican purpose to give
San Francisco better gov
ernment were regarded as
signals of victory which
every voter could plainly
read.
The audience represented
the best type of citizenship.
It was composed of business
men, workingmen and tax
payers â the men who fur
nish the money for the
maintenance of local gov
ernment â the men who are
firm in their determination
to wrest the control of mu
nicipal affairs from the
grasp of professional poli
ticians.
Henry J. Crocker spoke
manfully and frankly to his
fellow - citizens. Mighty
cheers attested the confi
dence of the people in their
leader. Inspired by the
great reception accorded to
him, he goes forward with
renewed courage and added
energy to do battle in the
cause of San Francisco's
advancement on true lines
of greatness.
It is obvious to the clos
est observers of the political
situation that the contest for
Mayor is really between
Crocker and Schmitz.
Lane's much heralded meet
ing at Turk-street Temple
last night was a fizzle. Only
twenty voters attended. He
fancies himself in the race,
but "where ignorance is
bliss 'tis folly to be wise."
The' vast attendance, the
inspiring cheers, and the
earnest declaration of Re-
r T^ HE Republicans of
Â£ San Francisco, united
and enthusiastic, pro
pose to make a brilliant rec
ord of success at the elec-r
tion on November 3. The
great mass-meeting at the
Alhambra Theater last
night was a significant pop
ular demonstration. It sig
nified, to the wavering non
partisan voters that the peo
ple of San Francisco have
resolved to abolish "graft"
at the City Hall,^to oust
job-chasing political flim
flammers and elect Henry
J. Crocker Mayor of the
city.

greatest enthusiasm.
Samuel M. Shortridge- also was to have

ever, he tent a. letter In which he ex
j.reused his regrets and paid high tributes
to the leader In the present contest The
Sum Booth Quartet appeared" and with its
aced leader at the head eang some songs
Geo.-ge A- Knight made an Ideal chair
irsaii. His magnificent voice could bÂ«
hoard in all parts of the- building, and as
It rang out in eloquent tributes to past
the big hall w&s taken and
the late- comers were content to stand
for hours to hear the splendid speeches
delivered by the leaders of the
pare- It waÂ» an enthusiastic meet-
Ing. "Whenever the name of Henry J.
Crocker, the standard-bearer of the party
at the coming municipal election, was
mentioned it was the signal for Intense
enthusiasm, and great cheers greeted the
rurnes of Lincoln, Blaine, Garfleld, Grant,
ilcKinley ar.d Roosevelt.
The arrangements lor the meeting were
perfect- The decorations were simple and
consisted of American flags and bunting.
Throughout the hall the banners of the
various candidates were displayed. The
candidates occupied seats on the* plat
fcrm with ether distinguished workers of
the party.

packed to its capacity at the

I maintain that the best interests of San

citizen*. It never 'can be fersotr#n ar.d it
never should be forgotten, and of all the cities
In t*e world that should net farset it it is
San Francisco, that America to-day is .waging
a contest against the world for supremacy,
which if once attained, will b-? i worth more
to San Francisco than the election of all thÂ«
officeholders or ofnceÂ»eekers that coulJ be pro
vided from a generation. Xo chain I* stronger

Jud C. Brusie, one of the best cam
paigners in the party, was introduced and
created a great deal of merriment by h'.s
clever stories. There was a great deal of
sound advice in Mr. Brusie's speech, and
his auditors listened to him with a deep
interest. His little paraphrase on old nur
sery rhymes and hi3 parrot story caught
the crowd. He spoke In part aa follows:
Sound Advice and Humor Character-
BRTJSIE IS FACETIOUS.
Hon. Arthur G. Fisk. Secretary Campaign
Committee â Dear Sir: A professional engage
ment will -deprive me of the pleasure and priv
ilege of attendinc the meeting at the Alham
bra. to-night and Joining in ratifying tile ticket
beaded by our next Mayor, Henry J. Crocker.
That ha Is honest v.-ill not be questioned:
that he I* capable is not to be doubted: and
thatâ all things considered â he la the best man
for the place can. I believe, be' made plain ant
clear to all thoughtful citizens. I would attack
no man's character. I would Impugn no man's
motives; I would simply apply the Jeftersoniaa
test â lntesrlty, capacity, fitness. Measuring
candidates by that standard, it would appear
upon dispassionate reflection that the- city's
great interests will be best guarded and ad
vanced by the election of Mr. Crocker. Friend
of all legitimate business enterprises and
enemy of none, looking toward the steady and
profitable employment of labor and capital, his
election would meaii and be understood
throughout the Unton to mean that San Fran
cisco wants Industrial peace and harmonious
co-cperatlon of all her people: it would be an
absolute guarantee ot an Intelligent and pro
gressive and. at the samÂ« time, an honest,
conservative and safe administration.
If it be true that a city be known by thÂ«
men It crowns, then as a citizen and as a Re
publican. I earnestly desire the election of
Henry J. Crocker.
I have the honor to remain, your* very
truly SAMUEL. M. SHORTRIDGE.
Samuel M. Shortrldge's letter was thea
read to the audience by Chairman Knight.
There were regrets that he was not pres
ent to charm with his eloquence. The let
ter was as follows:
SAX FRAN'CISCO. Oct. 10. 1903.
Sam Booth's Quartet sang: the stein
song -with words that appealed to the bir
audience. They sans the chorus with *
swing, and the crowd grew enthusiastic
again. The chorus ran:
We'll all stand together /
In every kind $f weather.
With a. cheer for Crocker
And a good sons ringing treat
Oh! we'll all stand tozethorr
In every kind of weather.
With shoulder to shoulder
We will go to victory.
Hon. Arthur G. Fisk. Mills, Building. Saa
Francisco: Illness prevents acceptance of
your Invitation. Every Republican should
vote the ticket headed by Henry J. Crocker.
There ought to be no doubt of Its election
and will be none if Republicans do their plain
duty. GEORGE C. PARDEE.
"When the chairman had concluded his
eloquent speech the applause was deaf
ening. After the audience had finished
shouting and applauding Mr. Knight read
the following telegram, sent by Governor
George C. Pardee:
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 9, 1903.
And when yon talk to the labor
people of Cnllfornin. and when you
talk to the laboring men of the
United Stntc* of America, all yea
nave to do la to nhoir themâ you
don't have to ihoir them, bat recall
to them and to their mintla the
history- of the party that lias done
no math for the elevation of labor,
and In their hearts' conviction* and
their nonlK they are Republican*,
and frill so vote If not driven away.
(Renewed applause.)
I never had any fear of the labor
ljnsf men of the t'nlted States of
America. I never had aay fear hat
Tvhnt Tvhen the time came. If they
have been led astray by fal*e
prophet* and by walking delegate*
who have no heart in their move-*
ment. the time will come when they
will come back to the Republican
fold and acknowledse by their
-votes and by their talk, and by their
act* that the place for every labor

America i* with the party that pro
claimed that the air of America waÂ»
too free to be breathed by a alave,
and that a man was entitled to an
honest ilny'Â» pay for an honest day'*
work. (Applame.)
And now, fellow citizens of, San Francisco,
feeling, as I do. the civic pride that every
American citizen should feel, and with the
hope that is no way tarnished by doubt, 1 be
lieve that San Francisco will achieve the r>ia<-'<Â»
deatised to her by the great Almighty who
brought us h*re and placed us upon the earth
to be active workers and busy bees In the hlvÂ»
Of progress. -
Fellow Republicans and fellow citizens of
San Francisco. I appeal to you to-night for an
organization, the history of which I need not
recall to you to-nl^ht. but suffice it to say
that It Is crowned with more honor. more
glory, more peace, more comfort to liod'a labor

been easily caught on a clear field. The batting

ing three straight victories ror the visitors.
The magnificent record made by Phlllppl in
winning the three games he pitched against
the Boston pennant winners led the crowd
to think be could do so again, but in this
they were disappointed. As he walked to the
center of the diamond to begin thÂ«' game he
was given the greatest reception ev<*r tendered,
a player on the local grounds and presented
with a diamond pin. He pitched a good,
steady game, but Boston's hits came when

Just as the last event in the intercol
legiate meet of last spring decided the
victory of the day, so did the last event
of the interscholastic meet held this af
ternoon on the Berkeley oval under the
auspices of the Academic League decide
with whom the honors of the day were
to rest. Melvin's jump of 20 feet 6 inches
gave him first place In the broad jump
and his school, the Oakland, the neces
sary points to win over its close competi
tors, Lowell and Ukiah. The three lead-
Ing schools stood as follows: Oakland, 2S;
Lowell, 25; Ukiah, 22.
The only record breaking of the day
was done by young Rose of Healdsburg,
the giant shot putter. Rose broke his
own world's interscholastic record by
putting the twelve-pound weight 52 feet
6 inches. His former record stood 62.22
feet. The other performances on track
and field were of as high order as those
of former years, but the rain last night
and this morning made the' track so
heavy that it was impossible to cover the

Skeotic "Wins Duke of York Stakes
LONDON, Oct. 10.â Skeptic won the
Duke of York stakes for 2000 sovereigns
to-day, at theÂ» Kempton Park autumn
meeting. Happy Slave was second and
Glass Jujr came In third.
Reliance failed entirely to puncture the
college men's line yesterday. They never
made their distance once, though on the
defensive they forced Berkeley to kick of
ten, Berkeley's line is going to look big
to . Stanford when the sweaters are
stripped off for the big game.

PLENTY OF MIRE.
Aside from the rich. black mud and the
occasional Jets of steel blue profanity
from Mr. Cavanaugh of the Reliance,
there was not much in yesterday's game.
Both teams wallowed through mire and
slipped on thefr own shadows. The ball
was sodden with moisture and cubed by
chunks of 'dobe, which made it almost
impossible to hold in a scrimmage.
Berkeley would have scored against Re
lianco by straight, clean bucking had the
ground been hard. Her backs showed
marked improvement over their former
half-hearted bucking. . If they had only
had solid ground beneath their feet they
could have beaten through the club line
for one touchdown at least. The appear
anceof little Mini at his old place behind
the line has added strength to Berkeley's
aggressive powers, for he goes through
a hole like a cat anÂ« down. a. scattered
field as a hare in a course.
They allowed Boynton and Elliott to
take turns at fullback yesterday, while
Snedlgar took a chance at half, alternat
ing with "Whipple. " The hew men showed
up creditably. Belknap got out the ball
at quarter. It is now a mooted question
whether More, last year's quarter, will
take fullback's position with. Belknap at
quarter or retain his old place behind
center with the chances of developing a
good fullback out of the material at hand.
.Belknap certainly plays a cracking good
quarter and should, be in the big game.
BERKELEY FORCED TO KICK.
ture the same question to a Reliance
man he will reply with emphatic punctu
ations that. there was no score on either
side and 'that' Berkeley 1 was. "given its
seven points by the referee. The^ referee;
an" old Berkeley graduate, declared that
the college team scored a. field goal and
a safety, all kicks of Reliance to 'the con
trary notwithstanding, and so the official
score stands, California 7, Reliance 0.
Reveree ."Evvy" Brown worked as hard
thumbing the pages of his latest Spald
ing's Guide as any of the giants of the
moleskin. In the second half all of the
trouble came. From Reliance's thirty
five yard line Overall sent the soggy pig
skin flying toward the goal from a place
kick. It soared dangerously near the
left post of the goal, but above It. Brown
declared it a field goal. The rooters
went wild and Cavanaugh, the Reliance
granite man, swore in a manner most
ungentlemanly.
' Then later, when from their five-yard,
the Reliance center passed the ball back
for a kick, complications arose. Mueller,
Btanding behind the goal line, yelled
"down" as soon as the ball touched his
hands, thinking to make a touchback in
stead of puntlngMt out of danger. Two
Berkeleyites brought him to earth.
Brown, the referee,: grew nervous for a
minute and then declared that a safety
had been scored, which gave the college
team two additional points. Mr. Gaffey
of the Reliance team thereupon refused
to play in Berkeley's back yard and quit
the field. .
IF you ask a Berkeley man who won
the game on the college campus
yesterday afternoon he will prompt
ly say California, 7 to 0. If you ven-

Jockey Club Desires Information Con

at Fort Erie.
NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â John J. Ryan,
formerly of St. Louis, known as a heavy
turf operator, has been summoned to ap
pear before the stewards of the Jockey
Club to' be. questioned,. It is Bald, regard

he was ruled off by the -officials of the
Fort Erie Jockey Club for an alleged
Infraction of turf regulations five years
ago. Ryan was on hand at the appointed
hour, but a quorum of the stewards was
lacking and the matter was postponed.

he returned to the betting ring. He is

Henry J K Crocker, who Is our local leader,
may not have been prominent In local politics
before, and some people may have taken a mo
ment to suspend Judgment, but they have
found in this short period of the ' campaign
that his acts, his words,- bis whole record have
already solidified sentiment . for Crocker und
the whole Republican ticket.' (Applause.) AnJ
that ticket Is not only one of the . strongest
that could be put up, but is stronger than
those of our adversaries.'
The Republican party is not on the defensive
in this campaign. We point to the Republican
national administration, we point to the lie
publican State administration, and we declare
to you that the candidates of your local ticket
will work for Republican principles and for
the general vote with the same Judgment, thÂ«>
same patriotism that sustains your comrade at
Sacramento. George C. Pardee (applause) and
your comrade at Washington, Theodore Koose
velt. (Applause.) Patriotism Is not the prop
erty of a class. However, common gratitude
and common eense which, with patriotism, dis
tinguish our party, demand that the people of
San Francisco rally to the support of that party
which forty years ago fought and bled for frea
labor, which for forty years has extended our
markets and kept our laboring men In â¢luplny
ment and which for forty years Is battl:i.g for
protection of American industries. And this
city is the active perpetuator of these Republi
can policies and traditions.
Marc Anthony, one of the young Re
publican orators of this city, closed the
meeting with a forcible speech. In part
he said:
Edwin Sweeney, candidate for Police
Judge, was Introduced and appealed to
the voters to elect him to the bench. He
said he had been elected for four days
and was now ready to fill the position of
Police Judge in a manner that would be
a credit to the party and the people who
elected him. Judge Joachlmson was also
introduced and made an appeal for the
election of the entire Republican ticket.
George R. Wells, candidate for Supervi
sor, said he believed in the future of the
city and would do all he could to make
it bright if he was elected. Robert Vance.
Maurice L. Asher. L. A. Rea and Fred
Eggers, candidates for Supervisor, were
Introduced and made short speeches. Dr.
Morris, candidate for Coroner, was also
presented and told what he would do if
elected.

VICTOR IN THE DEBBY.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10.â The fall meet
ing of the Los Angeles Racing Associa
tion opened at Agricultural Park this af
ternoon with a large crowd In attendance.
The old grandstand was well filled and
they lined up two deep against the out
side fence. Society came In automobiles
and tally-hos, and In all probably 5000
people saw some fair sport furnished
by a moderate bunch of horses, class be
ing entirely unrepresented..
To be sure, complimentary passes were
not as difficult to secure as Is an audi
ence with a king or an emperor, for as
a rule syndicators can afford to be liberal;
and this Is the one drawback to the meet-
Ingâ the betting sphere is not a free-for
aller. In extenuation the management
pleads It is in the hole more than a dozen
thousand over the result of last winter's
fiasco, when a city ordinance closed the
park, and could not afford to throw the
ring wide open. - Could any reputable
layer have been allowed to cut in there
would have been twelve books at least
chalking prices. Instead there were five
books under the shed, a field book and a
combination book. There- was a paucity
of big coin, short money being much more
in evidence.

I have heard It asserted here trvnight that
this is a. Republican city and that the Repub
licans have not elected a Mayor for some
years; but th* Republicans of this city are not
only going to have a good Republican Mayor
these next two years, but they are going to
have n good Republican ticket all the way
through. (Applause.)
I believe I can safely assert that I have be
yond peradventure of a dout>t the undivided
support of the entire Republican voting popula
tion of San Francisco. (Applause.) I believe
that I can assert, and I think It will be proven
true at the polls, that I shall have the support
of a great many sober-minded and thinking
Democratic friends who believe in good mulci
pal government. (Renewed applause.) I be
lieve, and I know, ladles and gentlemen, that
I will have the support of good worklngmen
without doubt (continued applause); and I will
give this city a government and an adminis
tration that shall do me proud. (Continuous
applause.) Â¦'.,-Â¦
There are more candidates to speak, and
there are more things to be said, and I will
take no more of your time. I simply want to
give you a few figures, gentlemen, that have
been Introduced Into this campaign. Records
have been searched and figures brought forth,
and some of them no doubt are very Interest
ing. There have been figures on the census of
this city Introduced; there have been claims
made by candidates that they are entitled to
election to this office because they have a child
born in this cltj. One candidate says to him,
"â¢Why I have two more than you, and I am
entitled to this election." Now, gentlemen,
take these census figures, take this population
record, take the best candidate that has spoken
up to date, and I will win two for one. (Laugh
ter and applause.) . \y. â¢ ; :
The commissioners appointed by the Mayor
of San Francisco will have the ordering of
these new clothes. They will control the ex
penditure of the money secured under the
bond issue. I pledge myself that I shall ap
polr.t men of known probity and honesty on
these commissions and men of standing among
their class. (Applause.)
As I have repeatedly asserted. I shall see
to it that the worklngmen of San Francisco
shall secure their full share of the money in
the shape of wages, and I shall also see to
It that the city gets value received for every
dollar she expends.
There are few cities in the world that are
so favorably located as is tnlB city of ours.
She ha* been most bountifully blessed ' by
nature. Situated as she Is upon her hillsides,
she should have the most perfect drainage sys
tem in the world. You have Just voted mil
lions of dollars to Improve that system. If
that money be honestly expended for these
improvements â and I pledge myself to see that
It is so expended â your sanitation will be well
nigh perfect, and you will have the healthiest
city in the world. (ApDlause.)
Our parks, our schoolhoui^s and our hos
pitals should challenge the admiration of man
kind. The people of this city have declared
In no uncertain tones that they want the best
that can be had â that our city mukt be beau
tiful and Improved In these particulars. I
promise you that If I am your Mayor I shall
take an especial pride In seeing to It that
your wishes concerning these improvements
shall be faithfully executed.
In accepting the nomination for the highest
office In the gift of this municipality I pledged
myself to support the Republican platform, and
I here unhesitatingly reiterate that pledge,
and I promise you that If elected â and I know
I shall be â I will carry out the policy laid
down la the platform. (Applause.)
San Francisco, within the last six years,
has had an awakening. Up to that tlm* we
were In a moribund condition. Her future
looked dark and forbidding. Her merchants
were despondent. Her mechanics and laborers
were unemployed and dejected. Then came
the thunder of Dewey*s guns In the Bay of
Manila, and the eyes of the universe were
directed toward this metropolis by the Golden
Gate. The world recognized the wonderful op
portunities that had come to San Francisco,
and under the fostering care of the wise tariff
and financial legislation enacted by the na
tional Republican party our progress has been
rapid and gratif ylng. Our merchants and me
chanics have taken heart knew, and only a
few days ago agreed by large majorities that
our city had outgrown her swaddling clothes
and th^t she needed an entirely new wardrobe.
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: At
the very beginning let me state that I neither
pretend nor claim to be an orator. 1 am a
"plain business man" who loves my city, my
State and my country. And It is because I
lore my city, because I am proud of her past,
because I have unbounded faith In her future,
that I have consented to leaj the ticket recent
ly nominated by the Republican party, which
ticket we hava assembled here to-night to rat
ify. (Applause.)
Maxwell McNutt, candidate for Super
visor, delivered a short speech which won
him the good will of all present. Ho
spoke forcibly and well.
Chairman Knight thought the time was
ripe to present Henry J. Crocker to his
big audience and In a few words he said
he would do so. In an instant hundreds
were on their feet cheering for the candi
date for Mayor. Mr. Crocker was escort
ed to the front of the platform and when
recognlxed was cheered loudly. The en
thusiasm subsided and was renewed. Mr.
Crocker spoke as follows:
Henry J. Crocker Beceives an Ova
tion From the Gathering.
NEXT MAYOR APPEARS.
After the quartet had sung a song en
titled "Fairy Tales," the chairman Intro
duced Percy V. Long, the "candidate for
City and County Attorney. Mr. Long had
many irtends In the audience and they
yelled approval of everything he Bald.
The audience attested to his popularity
by giving him a splendid reception. In
part Mr. Long spoke as follows :
I take it that I am to take this place on the
stage this evening more for the purpose of be
tng Introduced than to make a speech; but it
occurs to me that while we are talking loudly
of the newer and greater San Francisco, which
we are seeking to make more beautiful, we
niay pause and remembtr that we owe a debt
of gratitude to the great Republican party.
Throush the policy of the Republican party
for many year* paÂ«t and for the last lew years
particularly. San Francisco has been enabled
to be sreatly advertised throughout the world.
LONG'S ABLE PLEA.
Candidate for City Attorney Creates
Favorable Impression. .â¢ '*';
I Â«m a friend of the Native Sons, for I
have some in my own family and I want them
to succeed. I want them to buili up still
irreater this great and noble organization: but
I wast them to tie considerate of one thing.
We have in this State an organization which
is called the Promotion Committee, a com
mittee of citizens who are trying to promote
the interests of our great and glorious State.
They have epent thousands and thousands of
dollars to ad\-ertise cur climate, our resources,
our beautiful bay. our splendid valleys, our
magnlncent mountains, our woodlands and our
glens and vales to the whole world. We at
tended not lent a*o in this city the encamp
ment of the Grand Army of the Republic,
which brought 100.000 strangers to our city;
they were brought here to admire the re
sources of the Elate of Callfonil*. They
came here, they were no impressed with the
future of this State that hundreds and hun
dreds of their yount men have concluded to
come to California and make it their home.
Now, if you ten these men to come on here,
bring your energies, bring your money, bring
everything you can bring here to develop our
great Ptate. we welcome you with open arms,
but whenever you want * run for constable
look out that you are a N'ative Son (laughter);
now that 1s not fair to the Native Sons.
My frirnds. this city election is only a be
ginning of the great battlefield that awaits us
nest year. Let us do our duty here and we
will be In a fine condition to roll up such a
.wsajority next year that California will be
ranked among the first of the Republican
States, as it ought to be. There cannot be any
question about the political complexion of this
city. This Is a Republican city to the core.
We have a large Republican majority of voters
in this" city, and it Is the duty of every one.
as our chairman has told you much better than
â¢H am able to do, to turn out. to march to the
polls, - to speak to our neighbors, to Induce
every man to view this matter from the right
standpoint, and if we succeed in doing this we
are eure of victory. I believe that Henry J.
Crocker will be elected by a majority over
both of the other rival candidates. I honestly
and firmly believe that he will have more votes
than Mr. Lane and Mr. Schmitz together, and
be ought to have them. (Applause.)
I did not Intend to say anything for myself,
but since your chairman has been bo kind and
considerate and has mentioned my name as an
eld soldier and has referred to the early his
tory of my life. It seems to me I may be ex
cused for saying- one word on that subject.
There is one charge that Is brought against
me by the worthy gentleman who desires to
perpetuate himself In office, at least for a lit
tle while longer, and that Is a charge that I
cannot deny; but there are. some mitigating
circumstance* and I want you to consider
them. I am charged with one shortcoming,
and that !Â» that I am not a r.atlve eon. Now,
the mitigating circumstances in this case are
these: About the time when my friend, who
Is a native son. was struggling to get Into the
Â¦world. I was rtrjggllng to get out from under
a horse that was killed under me on the bat
tlefield of Gettysburg. (Applause.) And you
will ail perceive and agree with me that I was
so busy that 1 rtidn't have time to come to
California and become a native son. (Laugh
ter.)
I *ce before rr.e a sea of upturned, intelli
gent faces, and that is sufficient for me to
know that I am sddrf*?ir.g a meeting of stal
wart, good ru-publicans. I was pit-sent at the
birth of that treat party: I marched under
Its folds when its banner was carried by the
lamented Abraham Lincoln (applause): 1 fol
lowed it under the leadership of Grant, not
only to vlctoiy as & Ke'mblican, but through
this great land for the purpose of preserving
thlh grand and gloriou* temple of liberty that
has been erected for the benefit of all man
kind. (Applause.) I followed It under Gar
field, and under Blaine and under McKlnle>.
and now, my fellow- citizens, we are entering
upon the first battle of the campaign when
we will have to follow It under that great
standard bearer who uphrlds It now in the in
terest and to the credit of the Republican party
and for the benefit of all these United State:-,
Theodore Roosevelt. (Cheere.)
Chairman Knight introduced General
Salomon t-j the audience in a beautiful
speech. He told of the valor of the can
didate and of his services to the Repub
lican party. Mr. Knight grew eloquent in
his tpeech and when he presented the
general the latter was given a cordial
gre-etinp. The candidate for District At
torney spoke at length and won many
votes by his eloquence. In part he said:
Gallant Soldier Wins Golden Opinions
From His Hearers.
GEN, SALOMON'S ADDRESS.
Xt Is gratifying for me to be here this even
trt and to look over this large and intelligent
audience, and. I might say. of Republicans.
(Applause.) ThÂ» poeltlon for which I have
been nominated Is an important one. I can
sty for myself and the ticket that, if we are
elected, we will give you no cause to regret
placing us on your ticket. (Applause.)
Harry Baehr, the Auditor, of the -city
aad county, made a hit with the gather
ing by his modest speech. He said In
part:
The Auditor !s not supposed to be a public
epeaker and I fill that part of the bill to a let
ter. We are In the midst of one of the most
Important elections that has ever taken place
In the city and county of San Francisco. The
people voted to bend this city for many mil
lions of doll&re for the improvement of public
buildings, public whoote. city and county hospi
tals, sewer 5>>tem. etc., and it behooves every
cltiten and taxpayer to be careful who the of
ficials will be to disburse this money. You
have selected as your standard bearer one of
the most prominent business men of San Fran
cisco; a man who has carried on his private
business with fuccew. ani I assure you when
he takes charge of the Mayor"* office he will
conduct the business of this municipality with
the cust care he has given his private buel
aras. (Ari'l&use.)
Johli D. McDougrald received a hearty
welcome when presented to the big gath
ering. While he was speaking the mem
bers of the Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict Republican Club marched Into the
fct.ll and filled the place with their cheers
Xor Crocker and the ticket. Mr. McDou-
Caid eald:

not been fÂ«.>r the Republican party. I respect
the candidate of the L'nlon Labor party. He
made a creditable administration. N'o one
would he&r> abuse upon him. He la not de
â¢ervinjr of it. But where does he staad when
It comes to those treat bit matter* that per
tain to San Francisco? We are something;
more than a little village here. And where
does he stand when It comes to these treat
matters which help to shape the destiny of
the nation and of the world. Nobody has
â¢rer been able to find out yet. For a while,
he said, at the b&r.Quet of the Union League
Club, that rationally and that on the great
hlth planes he was a Republican. He also
proclaims himself to be an adherent of the
principles of the Union Uibnr party. Kot
ions" &ft> he took a flytnt trip East and c*n
vaesed a part of New York for a Democratic
rcmlnee for Conjrress. And at the very same
time he was hoping: that lightning might strike
from ihÂ« clouds of Republican hopes and that
he woulA still be the standard-bearer of both
the Republican and the Union Labor party.
A. little child sat on his father's knee and said:
How bit Is Mayor Bchmitz, pa, that people
call him treat?
la be like old GolUth, tall, his epear a hundred
welrfc*-?
Is he so tait that he can stand, like soma great
â¢teepl* h'.ch.

Ko^ no, tay son, as larte as I or Uncle Paul:
Tl# not fcls stature makes him treat, it's the
greatness of his tall.

and the policy of that party and the acts of
Us administration have been productive of
great prosperity to this city. The Republican
party has always advocated and Insisted upon
measures that would produce practical results
and redound to the honor and upbuilding of the
people.
It seema to me that the ticket headed by
Henry J. Crocker, that tried and truÂ« San
Franciscan, that native son who believes In
the future of hia city, who Is willing: to sacrifice
his individual business interests and *lve up
his time to the betterment of this city and make
It attractive to those who visit our city. Is the

which he was ruled off at Fort Erie and
that he refused at that time to go be

encercu â¢nu> a conspiracy to capture the Union
Labor i-uiivention. In pursuance with this plan
John Shakef i-eare Parry was sent to the Union
Labor eucvcultoti ostensibly as a delegate from
a labor orjraiv.zatiuii. After the election of a
temporary cltainr&n the credentials of John
bsaJbttMBN Parry were questioned on the
n- or. iiut the temporary chairman, against the
protests of &. large number of genuine labor
union men. made the eald John Shakespeare
Parry i"..a.rir.a:i of the committee on credcu
titls and as *uch he reported all credentials to
be correct. Including his own. of course.
A ticket was nominated. Eugene E. Schmitz
being the* successful candidate for Mayor, and
the n â¢n.lx-rs of the Primary League, who had
I â¢<-â¢Â¦!Â» bo active In the ncminatisa of this man
Kugene E. Schmitz, could not even sign the
peution to place the Union Labor party and its
candidates upon the official ballot.
The Union Labor party and Eugene E.
Schmitx es Its candld&te for Mayor would have
beÂ«n impossibilities If all voters, like he and
his Primary League followers, had vcted at the
primaries.
The word had gone forth before the prima
ries atkir-g all Union Labor men to refrain
from veffing at the primaries, bo that they
might J>e eligible to sign the petition by which
the Union Labor party and Its candidates could
have a place upon the ballot, but Eugene E.
Bcbmitz and his following of renegade Repub
licans, under the leaderefalp of Abraham Ruef
after having first taken caances with the Re^
publican party and lost, then . proceeded by
trickery and treachery to steal from honest
union labor men the results of their efforts.
Immediately after his election Eugene E.
Echmltx surrendered his public trust and turned
over to Abraham Ruef the office of Mayor, as
the following letter, which Abraham Ruef
raused to be published In all the dally papers
will show, the r&ltMul Republicans referred
to In It. being his renegade Primary League
followers, who, after proving traitors to the
Republican party, became wolves In sheep's
clothing among the Labcr Union- party:
"Mr. A. Ruef. Attorney at Law, 002 Ca'.ifor

thÂ« election is over and I am to be Mayor o?
our ruitlve city. I wish to express to you and
through you to all your loyal friends and faith

profound appreciation of the generous, whole
souled, substantial and effective support ac
corded me in the exciting campaign which has
JuEt closed. Viewed from your prominent posi

tarily and unconditionally offered me your val
uable aid, and I cannot In words properly give
utterance to my deep feeling In this regard. I
can only eay that your . action Is worthy of
yourself, and that no higher praise can be ac
corded you.
"I have now for fifteen years enjoyed your

without hesitation or flattery that I have yet
to find a more honorable, a more loyal, a more

and I Fhall not permit myself at any time to

For what object wu it written? Why riven

Fellow voters, this letter to Abraham Ruef
came from a man who is telling nlshtly that
no fault can be found with his administration.
And yÂ»t. r.lar. we have more to follow; our
history so far hag not reached his administra
tion, nor his determined efforts to cripple and
destroy the Union Labor party and build up
the AbÂ« Kuef Primary League. In his letter
he thanked -the Primary Leaguers, bnt had no
time nor inclination to write one word of
thanks or appreciation of the efforts and hard
work of his honest union labor supporters. They
must have been too small to notice.
UNION MEN HEAR SCHMITZ.
I The Labor Union candidate for Mayor,
Eugene E. Schmitz, addressed the voters
of the Twenty-ninth Assembly District
last nicht in Alex Greggalns* hall on i
Sixth street, near Folsom. |
He arrived late and was accorded a '
j warm reception. His speech was not one
I to arotise any special amount of entluisl
; asm t and was almost entirely devoted to
attacking "his opponents and the parties
they represent.
He opened his remarks by attacking the
press, stating that it would probably an
nounce in the morning papers that "only 'Â¦
i a hanuful of people were rrt the hall and i
! that those were mostly boys."
He said In part: '
I tddrws you as fellow union men. because
; I am still a union man, as I belong to the
: union the same now aa before I was elected
I Mayor. We have not tfce prens with us. We
have no public organ. Our only way to rain '
victory Is. for up to appeal direct to the people. :
.he recommendation we have to put forward -
| Is the record of the work of the representa
tives of the labor union during the past two j
yeais they hare held office. ........ â¢
Ovt opponents have used the combined ef- '
forts of capitalists to plare in power a man i
wfcesi they can use in their own behalf when i
they have need to further their ends. â¢
This Is not a question of the. election of any
individual; it Is a question of principle. This I
principle Rieans to the workingman peace and '
prc-sperity. In the times of strikes the wage- j
earner mutt have the same Justice as the em- I
ployer. I do not want to throw mud at the â¢
opposition, but when one of them states in his \
speech that It is necessary for the Republican j
party to succeed to save the city and maintain
tba chsrter. I wonder If he thought the charter
would be stolen and carried over to the Philip
pines.
At the election two years ago the ware-earn
ers began to realize that they had been voting
for the wronr party, and they determined to
have a :*rty of their own. They wanted to
save the city from the Phelan-Gavin-McNab
combination and they did it.
This '.n rot a fight between Democrats and
the Labor party, for the Labor party repre- ;
Rents nine-tenths of the Democratic party. The ;
Labor party is a new democracy, built on
broader views.
My views are to bring capital and labor to
gether and to look alter the rights of both.
Give me a backing and give me a friendly
Board of Supervisors to back me. Then I
shall be able to carry out plans to help and
benefit our party.
Then, the band played "He's a Jolly
Good Fellow." in the midst of which the
Mayor left the hall. i
Thomas P. Finn was chairman of the j
meeting. On the platform were J. J. Con- I
nolly. Harry A. Knox. Frank Jewell, M. I
W. Coffey. Powel Fredrick and several j
other candidates for office, who made
short speeches while awaiting the arrival
of the speaker of the evening.

The Health Committee . agreed that the
matter had no phase "affecting the public

The ordinance was once before consid
ered by the board after the Judiciary and
Streets committees had ' reported in favor
of its indefinite postponement on the
ground that it was unconstitutional.
In view of the approaching election and
because the labor unions are urging the
passage of the ordinance the members of
the board were unwilling to take action
and so referred the ordinance to ' the
Health Committee In order to gain time.
Now that committee refuses to accept the
responsibility and reports the bill back
for consideration by the board.

Tax Collector Smith said:
"I have heard the rumor that a few of
the civil service ellglbles have started to
oppose my candidacy for re-election be
cause I decided to get along with $6000
less for extra clerk hire than formerly.
If I am to be opposed because I intro
duced business methods in the adminis
tration of the office and thus economized
to the extent of $6000 in the Interest of
the city I suppose I will have to stand it.
I have certainly proven my friendship for
the merit system, and I must admit that
it was entirely owing to the efficiency of
my regular civil service clerks and depu
ties that I was enabled to get along with
a lesser number of extra clerks. I can
only refer to the fact that I have always
endeavored to subserve the best interests
of the public, whose servant I am, in con
ducting the affairs of the tax office. I
submit that any taxpayer who has done
business with my office can attest to the
fact that he has been waited upon with
dispatch, and not one has been subjected
to the interminable waits which obtained
during former administrations. I believe
I have introduced a business system In
the office, which if it has resulted in a
saving of $6000 to the city certainly ap
pears to me to be no good reason for my
being opposed in my ' campaign for re
election,"
SMITH HEARS RUMOR.
"Rule 27: Participation In Politics â Partici
pation of civil service appointees In partisan
politics, except to vote. Is contrary to the
spirit of the charter and subversive of the best
interests of civil service."
Smith's course in saving the money for
other necessary purposes has, however,
earned the displeasure of several civil ser
vice clerks who would have profited by
the Increased appropriation, and on that
account some of them have begun to use
his economy as an argument against his
re-election. In the absence of the Civil
Service Commissioners, Chief Examiner
Moran said yesterday that the commission
could do nothing if men on the -civil ser
vice lists chose to meddle in politics. He
said:
There is no power vested In the commission
by the charter whereby civil service ellgibles
or even appointees may be disciplined for tak
ing an offensive part In political campaigns.
The commission regrets this omission tn the
charter, as it is of the opnion that civil service
employes should hold aloof from politics. & rule
which obtains in the Federal civil service. The
commission discussed the matter for a long
time, and. while deploring that it could not
prohibit civil service employes in the munici
pal government from engaging In politics. It
felt that there was a moral obligation on thÂ«
part of ruch employes to refrain from any act
ive participation In political campaigns. On
that account it formulated a rule, which, how
ever, is only In the nature of an Injunction,
which reads at follows:
CLERKS ARE DISPLACED.
The attention of the Civil Service Com
mission was called yesterday to the fact
that some of the civil service ellgibles on
the list of ordinary clerks had threatened
to oppose the candidacy of Edward J.
Smith for re-election as Tax Collector be
cause that official had voluntarily agreed
with the Board of Supervisors to carry
on the business of his office during the
present fiscal year for $6000 less than
the amount he could be legally allowed.
The ground for opposing Smith is ad
mittedly a selfish one, as the ellgibles
claim that they will be prevented from
benefiting by the increased appropriation
which would have been spent for extra
clerk hire. The men give no thought to
the saving of $6000 to the city effected by
Tax Collector Smith, which would other
wise have been used In the payment of
salaries. The amount named was utilized
in thc sum appropriated for repaying
streets and other necessary improvements
and is part of the substantial results ob
tained by the taxpayers of the munici
pality.
When Tax Collector Smith informed the
Supervisors' Finance Committee at the
time they were preparing the annual
budget that he could get along with $3000
less than he had expended last year for
clerk hire the committee was agreeably
surprised, as Smith was the only city of
ficial who did not ask for an increased
appropriation. Smith explained that he
had systematized the work of the tax of
fice and had been enabled by his first
year's experience to Introduce business
methods In the conduct of the office, and
on that account he would not need a3
many extra clerks as he had employed In
the past. The committee was much grati
fied at Smith's economy, which It thought
could well be introduced in other city of
fices, and Â¦was able to increase the appro
priation for permanent Improvements by
exactly the sum of $6000.
1. Do you understand the purposes and prin
ciples of the California LJquor Dealers' Associa
tion?
2. Are you opposed to any one of its ex
pressed declarations? ', -
3. Are you friendly or unfriendly to the re
tall liquor trade?
4. Would you. If elected, vote for an ordi
nance or amendment to any law In opposition
to the expressed wishes of the association?
5. Will you. If elected, support the declara
tions of this association, as they have been
read to you?
i For the purpose of making their oppo
i sition effective in the city campaign and
j probably also with a view of guarding
i against the necessity for added expenses
; that hedge about the license privilege,
1 the association has appointed a commlt
i tee of five to see all the candidates for
â¢ Mayor and Supervisors and to propound
| to them the following questions, requir
i ing a direct and unevasive answer:
' 2. The asboclatton declares itself opposed to
I Sunday laws and ordinances of every kind or
character. Â¦
3. That it Is in absolute opposition to in
creasing the existing license tax.
4. That It opposes any legislation against
the combined grocery and bar.
5. That it is opposed to any -change in the
present laws unless the change be first ap
proved by the association.
' 1. That the association is opposed to local
option.
The liquor dealers have evidently had
reason to be dissatisfied with the way
their affairs have been managed ' under
the present city administration. IÂ£ may
be that Incidentals attaching to the mat
ter of securing a license such as attor
neys' fees, pull, etc., outside of the reg
ular fee therefor, have been irksome to
! some of the liquid caterers to the palate
I of San Francisco. At any rate, the Cali
fornia LJquor Dealers' Association has re
cently adopted resolutions, which, after
j declaring that the association is com
: posed of retail liquor dealers who have
: organized for mutual protection for the
; purpose of guarding, their business against
' unjust discrimination, go on to declare

crutches some of the best doctors that I saw told me that the only thing to
be done was to have my leg taken off. Having heard of people being cured
of rheumatism at the Electro-Chemic Institute, 118 Gran avenue, San Fran-
cisco, I managed to go to their office, and before I had taken ten treat-
ments the pain had left my knee and I was able to take off the heavy band-
age that I had been wearing. In some five or six more treatments I was
able to walk without my crutches, there being only a slight stiffness and a
small amount of weakness, due undoubtedly to a year's entire disuse of
the leg and knee joint.
"It gives me great pleasure to recommend this wonderful Electro-
Chemic treatment."
Elect ro=Chemic Proof.
For nearly two years we have been publishing the testimony of cured
patients in the leading San Francisco papers. We have not asked the pub-
lic to take our unsupported word for our claims of cures. Some of the
best people of San Francisco, through gratitude and a laudable desire to
benefit other sufferers, have kindly volunteered their public testimony.
These Electro-Chemic cures are quick, they are permanent and they are in-
expensive. Patients have been cured of CONSUMPTION, CATARRH,
ASTHMA, RHEUMATISM, CANCERS, TUMORS, DEAFNESS,
RINGING EARS, PARALYSIS, LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA, PILES, KID-
NEY DISEASES, BLOOD and SKIN DISEASES, STOMACH, LIVER
and BOWEL DIEASES. WOMEN suffering from SPECIAL DISEASES
peculiar to them have been cured painlessly and kept out of the surgeon's
hands. MEN have been cured of WEAKNESS, PROSTATITIS, VARI-
COCELE, SPECIFIC BLOOD CONTAGION, etc., etc., after having lost
hope through failures under the older medical treatments.
QUICK and PERMANENT cures are what we want. They are the
best advertising that we can get We have the largest special practice in
San Francisco, but we can do still more.
HOME TREATMENT.
We loan to outside patients our Electro-Chemic apparatus for home
treatment free of charge. We advise all our outside patients, when it can
possibly be done, to come to our office for a thorough personal examina-
tion. In most instances the patient can return home the same day, tak-
ing the necessary treatment along. When it is impossible to visit us,
write a careful description of principal symptoms, and full instructions
will be promptly forwarded for home examination and treatment.

0, FFICIAL Kansas is all amazement over a new clement thaf
has just obtruded itself into American politics and â won out.
Official Kansas is investigating, but meantime the women o!
an entire State are seeing* to it that their triumph of the last few
weeks is maintained and the cause of true love holds full sway.
They fought in a way peculiarly feminine for their risrht to recevre
their lovers. and to be wooed and won and married when, where and how
they pleased. The men fousrht against it, but the women won. and ia
pursuance of that victory they dragged the defeated candidates out ' of
office by main force. Hence official Kansas' perturbation. Hence,
too, official Kansas' effort to keep the facts quiet until it gets full
and final report of this astounding condition of affairs. Meantime Hy
men rules an entire State in a manner never before witnessed in all the
history of the world. The Sunday Call will put you in possession of all
the facts next Sunday, official Kansas* perturbation notwithstand
ing.
And did you ever read of Delaroo? He was an Indian. He was
more. . He was the shadow incarnate of Maje Sampson. He was even
more than that. He was the best railroad character that ever cauzht
the facile pen of Frank H. Spearman, who is himself the best writer of
American railroad stories in the world to-day. -This is Delaroo as
Spearman knew him:
"As long as Mai e would talk Delaroo would listen. That single
word was, in fact, the kev to Delaroo; Delaroo was a listener; for that
reason nobody knew much about him."
And this in brief is one of the most tense moments in all Soear
man's exciting narrative of Delaroo's career:
"What do I think of it?" muttered Neighbor, when the local operator
asked him for a report for Callahan. "I think there's two engines for
the scrap in sight â and the 264. if we can ever find anything of. her â and
about a million sheep to oav forâ ". Neighbor paused to eive an order
and survey the frightful scene.
"And. Delaroo." repeated the operator. "He wants to know about
Delaroo â "
"Missing."
If you have been reading Spearman's new series of two-pace stories
you will not need even these extracts to keep you on a sharp lookout for
Delaroo in the next Sunday Call. Spearman's stories are the sort that
you never forget. Thev cet a grip on your memory like the mysterious
fascination of railroadine itself.
However. Delaroo is only one of the big things in the next Sunday
Call.as, for instance. "The Golden Fetich." It is a new mystery story
âmore mysterious even than "The Mystery Box," more excitins? than
"Tainted Gold." more surprising by for than "Brewsfer's Millions" and
yet containing all the orijrinalitv of these three and more. You've read
them all in the Sunday Call. You know then what solendid oronme vou
may-expect in the first installment of "The Golden Fetich" next Sunday

LOVE'S VICTORY
AT THE POLLS
PERSONAL/MENTION.
Standing room was at a premium in
the caDacloua court at Central Park last
night. The final contest of the tug of
war tournament brought out a crowd
that taxed the grounds to their utmost.
During the previous evenings of the
trialu the adherents of the different teams
had always showed their loyalty In true
fashion, j but In last night's events the
spectators, nearly.- went = wild in spurring
on to victory the teams on which- they had
banked their confidence and likewise their
Saturday night's earnings.
Michael Casey's bunch of teamsters got
a drubbing from the plasterers.
When the- teams came together the rope
was hardly taut when the plasterers
started the teamster's going and kept
them on a run that would do justice to
-a Â¦ hundred-yard sprinter out for a rec
ord. In Just nine seconds after the ref
eree had fired the starting shot he had
to explode another cartridge to tell of
the teamsters' awful failure.
The bridge workers took a fall out of
the carmen'after a long, hard pull that
lasted nearly half an hour. The carmen
were game, but never during the tug
could they get a cleat on their opponents.
Two teams that had not suffered jdef eat
during, the tourney came together as the
evening's event.
Eight heavy men that handle lumber
longshore were pitted against a team of
carpenters of lighter weight. What the
carpenters lacked in avoirdupois they
made up, In cunning and cleverness and
in a second or two less than &ix' minutes
took ' the city, : front < bunch over, the line
In a scramble and won the tournament.

i-vj^ ERKELEY, Oct. 10.â Ill success
,^2^ in love caused J. 41!en McDon-
aid to take his own life some
'* time early Thursday night by
shooting himself through the
head in the rear of his little notion store
a.t S49 University avenue. West Berkeley.
The suicide's body was not found until
this morning, when J. H. Gentry, a bar
ber living next door, noticed the unusual
quiet about the store and began an In
vestigation. He found the lifeless body
of McDonald with a revolver tightly
clutched in the right hand. Close by waa
a carelessly written letter, dated Thurs
day, October 8. McDonald had evidently
meant the letter to serve both as a fare
well message and a will, as in It he gives
the money which he had on deposit in
the Hibernia Savings Bank to Miss Anna
Tham of North Berkeley. It is believed
the failure of McDonald's suit to win the
young lady was partly responsible for his
act of self-destruction. The letter read3
as follows:
Friends and Er.emlÂ»s: I wish you all health
and happiness. The money that is in the Ht
bernia Havings Bank I will to Miss Anna Tham
of Vine street, b^ttveen Walnut and Oxford.
The money in the Berkeley Savings Bank 1
will to Mrs. J. Vf. Harlan of San Francisco.
1 think shn was Miss Christina McDonald. She
was my father's sister.
And everything 1n the store, with tbe excep
tion cf the counter and the shelves, I will
to the Rebekah Orphan Home of I. O. O. F.
In Gilroy.
I winh Mrs. Gentry to hare ray kitten. I
didn't have the courage to kill the kitten.
Fay my telephone and electric light bills.
I want John Strelghtif to conduct my funeral.
Cremate my remains and scatter them to the
winds. J. A. McDOXALD.
P. S.â Brother Strelghtlf. put on all my re
galia. Oood-by, my love. Life is too long and
weary without you. Oood-by.
The Miss Anna Tham who . Is to re
ceive the money in the Hibernia Bank Is
living with her sister, Mrs. Hermann C.
Boettiger, at 1701 Walnut street. Miss
Tham has been confined to her bed for
some time on account of nervous prostra
tion . due to long Illness, and her sister
has kept from her the news of McDon
ald's suicide. Mrs. Boettiger says that
the man only called' once or twice, but
was not allowed to see her sister.
McDonald has been In trouble several
times recently and it is believed that his
mind was unbalanced. He was about 40
years of age and a member of Berkeley

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 10.â
The varsity eleven defeated the Pensa
cola football team in a very cne-slded !
game this afternoon by the score of 34 to !
0. Only twice during the entire game did '
the Goat Island team make their distance j
on downs, and Fullback Jones was re-'
Bponeiblo for thes* gains In both In- j
stances. The ecore hardly indicates the !
comparative strength of the two teams, t
for three times Stanford relinquished easy j
chances for touchdowns in order to give |
left tackle Sprott a. chance to try for field
goals. Sprott seemed unable to locate the
goal posts accurately, although he had
three good chances, all from points inside
the thirty-yard line and one from only
fifteen yards. i
The showing made by the varsity was j
satisfactory to both -coaches and rooters!
except for th'e fumbling. Stanford f um- j
bled a half-dozen times, principally in the
becond half, after almost the entire team
had been substituted.
-Stanford played twenty-five men during
the game, carrying out Coach Lanagan's
intention of playing at least twenty- three j
men in every preliminary game. George j
Clark '04. who played a star game at
right end last season, played his first
game of this season' to-day, showing up in
varsity form. Of the eight men that
played halves and fullback for Stanford !
to-day it would be hard to pick out any
one man as the starâ all played hard,

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 10.â Amherst's
readiness In taking advantage of Har
vard's inability to hold the ball enabled
hÂ«r to defeat Harvard, 5 to 0. Amherst
failed to kick the goal. The game was
played in a rainstorm. In rush Amherst
was outplayed. Harvard played a faster
game and showed to advantage both on
the offensive and the defensive, but
fumbled wretchedly. The touchdown was
made when Harvard had attempted a
quarterback kick from her ten-yard line,
which AmherBt blocked and Coggswell
dropped on the ball, pushing it acroes the
line for a touchdown.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 10.â Tale
and the Springfield (Mass.) Young Men's
Christian Association Training School
elevens played a sensational football
game on Tale field to-day that erfded
with a score of 22 to 0 in favor of Tale.
For a considerable part of the game,
however. Springfield plowed through the
Yale line and seriously shook up the vet
eran Yale eleven. Far better than the
score Indicates did they play and Yale
was more thoroughly tried out, both as
to attack and defense, than In any other
game of the season.
PROVIDENCE. R. I.; Oct. 10.â In a

CHICAGO. Oct. 10. â There was a good gen
eral demand for wheat throughout and prices
showed good gains. The opening was firm on
the higher prices in foreign markets, due to
the uncertainty in regard to the trouble In thÂ»
Orient. December being %c to %c higher at
78%Â©7S%c. One of the prominent bull opera
tors was an early buyer and there was also
buying of Northwestern houses, which carried
the prices Ftill higher. December advancing to
"'.'^T'.Hsc. Local traders took advantage of the
better prices to sell, influenced by the excel
lent weather, and the market eased off with
December selling down to 78%c.
Toward the noon hour prices again started
upward on a strong cash demand and the mar
ket continued strong the remainder of the ses
sion. After iellinur up to 78%c December closed
with a gain of %@%c at 79%!^79Uc.
â¢ An easier tone prevailed in the corn pit early
In the day, due to selling by scalpers on fa
vorable weather and Bradstreet's annual re
port making an estimate of this year's crop
of two and a quarter billion bushels, with the
quality superior to last' year. Later the mar
ket advanced on the bull excitement In oats,
local traders buying freely on the upturn. De
cember closed with a gain of %@%c, after
ranging between 45c and 45$ic.
An improvement In the cash situation caused
a sudden upturn in oats, while trading was the
liveliest of any of the pits. Leading houses
were active on the buying side, and the energy
they displayed caused shorts to become thor
oughly frightened and the demand was aug
mented largely by covering by these people. Of
ferings were ecattered. December ranged be
tween 37%c and 3S%c and closed l%Â©l!ic
higher at 38%c.
The weakness In October lard, the only weak
feature In the provisions market, was duo to
lack of support. There was fair local buying
of January products, based on an advance of
Ofi'lOc in prices for hogs, and pork and lard
closed 10c higher. January ribs were up 0@
7%c. " â¢

Current Trade Conditions.
Henry Clews eays, in his New York circu
lar:
â¢â¢Trie important influences affecting values
In the long run are money, crops, industry
and commerce. Let us briefly review each.
The monetary situation is vsstly better than a
year ago. Liquidation has immensely relieved
the bank*, epeculative demands are practically
nil, loans are decreasing, reserves are larger
\than a year ago. the banks are generally in
ttrong ccnfiitlon. funds are ample to move the
crtpe. the eurplr of raoney is about $124.OO-J.
<XK> larger than last year and bankers continue
conservative in rranting credits to all classes
of borrowers; consequently the much-feared
monetary crisis wheih was expected this au
tumn is naw en exceedingly remote possibility.
Secretary ShÂ»Â« is entitled to much credit in
tMs iWtinWIVtl for hi* vigorous and resource
ful arti^n in counteracting Government ope
ntCtaw in the money market, and it is now
QClte lik'-iy that before rr.any months are gone
11 r.py will be plentiful at lower rotes. Gold
!r"ip^ris rarnct be far distant, owing to the
incrcaslrsK supply of commercial bills and to
th* fact that Eurore will be necessarily a large
bcyer of our food products. The curative pro
i.<=Â« is probably more complete in the money
market than in the Â«ock market, and before
l_r.g the anoniaijus condition cf money cora
mai.dins better returns than securities will
.'.-^ :Â¦.;.;â¢â¢ *r. As to the crops there is nothing to
add to previous conclusions given in these ad
vice*, viz.. that the farming classes througTi
oi'i the country are practically sure of another
]TOF:x.-rous y<>ar. This fact cannot be too
itTMWtT impressed, for here is real Increase to
the national wealth, an abundance of traffic
Icr our railroads ar.d a good demand for all the
necessities of life. The West Is still enjoying
prosperity, and it is easy to forget that Wall
?trÂ«tt, though an important element, is not
the entire country. -Concerning industry and
commerce, or more strictly speaking the busi
ness eituition, there are both good and bad
features, the former unquestionably predomi
nating-. Some reaction must be anticipated.
Sharp economies will be practiced among the
wealthy, who have chiefiy Buffered in the re
rent stock decline. The chill received from
Wall street will inevitably result in some con
traction and new enterprises will be checked
and merchants will operate with greater con
servatism. Costs cf production, too, are often
too hlrh ar.d cannot be reduced without lower
priced raw materials. Labor will also have to
F.hare the reaction, either in the shape of shut
downs or lower wages, to which more or leeu
resistance may be expected. But these con
tingencies are somewhat remote and cannot
become acute cr pressing until we have more
positive indications of overproduction. Read
justment is progressing In the iron trade, and
i- is well known that much contract work is
being held back until prices of finished pro
ducts reach a more normal level and the de
mtiids cf labor ere moderated.
"All of these conditions, however, have been
over-discounted in the stock market, and when
buslr-efs reaction does come it would not be
surprising to find that Wall street had fully
anticipated the fact and was busily occupied
recovering from undue depression. Many good
securities are telling at bargain prices, and as
Uiere are no prospects of reduced dividends on
better class railroad shares, their purchasers
ax present prices will undoubtedly secure hand
tt&t profits in due time."

boxes, cleaned up quickly at a sharp advance.
Peaches were higher, supplies being slender
and the demand steady. Receipts of table
Grapes in large open boxes were light and
prices were firmer. Muscats were particularly
firm and occasional sales of strictly fancy
stock were I reported ' at $1 50. Offerings in
email packages were in free supply and prices
stood about Â¦ as before. Wine Grapes arrived
freely and were easy, as the rain kept buyers
away from the market. The Melon market
was overstocked and dull. There was practi
cally no inquiry for Watermelons and prices
were largely nominal. Special brands of Can
taloupes and Nutmeg Melons sold fairly well at
full figures, but the common run of offerings
were neglected. Fancy Apples continued to
movo freely at steady prices, but inferior of
ferings were dull -with stocks steadily accumu
lating. Prices of the other tree fruits had no
change worthy of note.

Yesterday was a sad day for Joe Cdr
bett. He stepped into the pitcher's box
with that air of confidence which be
speaks victory ere it comes. But it never
came. After pitching ten winning games
in a row and twenty-three innings with
out allowing the opposing teams a run,
the combination was broken up. The Na
tives got to the southern star for a tally.
This won the game and put the Jinks on
Joe's proud record. Scoreâ San Francisco
1, Los Angeles 0.
Little Llndsey, the wee southpaw,
showed once again that he has the Los
Angeles team on his staff. For the sec
ond time this week he returned them
runless. His performance yesterday was
about the .brightest thing of the game,
and would have won him a reputation on
anybody's ball field.
The lone run of the game was secured
during the progress of the sixth Inning.
Young Raymond furnished a mild sur
prise when he chopped the sphere safely
over second base. The Angels were the
roost surprised of any individuals in the
lot, for when Llndsey laid down a bunt
to second base Corbett, Spies and Dillon
all went after the ball and no one covered
the Initial bag, so the little pitcher was
safe and Raymond went to second. Shay
sacrificed and both runners moved up a
notch. Then Meany advanced to the plate
and tore off a solid one that went at a
mad rate to Dillon. The capfleraed the
ball nicely, but for a moment he hesi
tated before throwing it to the pan. This
slight hitch was fatal, for when thejball
arrived at the rubber Raymond was a
nose ahead of It, and so happened the
only run of the game.
The southern giants executed three fast
double plays and went through the game
without making an error. San Francisco
committed two- mistakes, both on hard
chances. Corbett was the only man on
the Los Angeles team to hit at all. He
banged two singles out of four chances.
In the ninth Joe came to the bat with two
out and a man on second, but he failed,
to make good and produced only a little"
pop fly to Pabst. The score:

In pieces. The loss of the Glfford once
more calls attention to the fact that the
North Pacific Coast of America is entirely
lacking- in adequate equipment for wreck
ing large vessels. The more progressive
of the local underwriters have tried re
peatedly to organize a company for this
purpose, provided with gear such as Is
used by the big wreckers on the Atlantic
Coast and at European shipping centers.
A large sum of money would be required
to acquire or construct the necessary ap
pliances, but although about 40 per cent
of the local underwriting firms have
promised liberal financial support, the
apathy of the remaining 60 per cent has
been such that the burden on the willing
ones would have been out of all reason
able proportion. Had there been a prop
erly equipped wrecking outfit at this port,
operated by men of experience. It is the
opinion of experts that the GifTord would
have been floated within a day or two
after she stranded. The loss on the Gif
ford represents a sum which would have
gone far toward providing an up-to-date
outfit and it is thought that the lesson
may result in the early establishment of
a salvage plant, which would find plenty
of occupation between this port, coast
points and Puget Sound.

at the half-mile pole, reaching it in 1
minute flat. Half a second was clipped
off at the three-quarters pole, which he
reached in 1:29V*. He went under the wire
in l:S9Va.
Lou Dillon then trotted out on the track
harnessed to a wagon. A thoroughbred
In front broke the wind and another be

She reached the quarter .in 31 seconds
and the half in 1:01. At the three-quar
ters pole, however, she slipped a quarter
second off Major Delmar's time, for she
reached It in 1:30%. The crowd went wild
when the figures went up in front of the
timer's stand. Down the stretch she came
with masmirtcent stride and it appeared
to the onlookers that she would overstep

Major Delmar was the first of the spe

accompanied by two runners, driven by
Spears and McDonald. Spears was driv

McDonald was driving slightly to the
rear of Major Delmar. ; The trotter had
the pole. 'He reached the quarter in 31
seconds and the half-mile pole in 1:OL
He made the third quarter In 1:31, but
lost ground in the home stretch and went
under the wire in 2:03%. He had trotted
a half mile, consisting of the second and
third quarters, in one minute flat, but the
wind slackened his time in the first quar
ter and in the stretch, striking him at
right angles.
Prince Alert then came upon the field
to make an attempt at breaking the pac

Justice was tempered with mercy in the
United States District Court yesterday,
when the three Cummings brothers, in
dicted for counterfeiting, appeared for the
purpose of pleading:. In the case of Fred
r> Cummings and James P. Cummings a
nolle prosequl was entered on motion of
United States District Attorney Wood
worth who stated that the physicians of
the Marine Hospital had signed a certifi
cate to the effect -that the two named
were afflicted with tuberculosis and ; that
imprisonment would be fatal to them. It
was represented further that this was the
first time the prisoners had ever been ar
rested for anything, and that the ends of
justice would be subserved by punishing
George A. . Cummings, .who .had 'pleaded
guilty. . .- .
The Cummings brothers were arrested
last April by United States Secret Service
Agents George W. Hazcn, Harry W. Mof-

talking and her expressive face betrayed
the disapproval she would not utter. It
was so plain that we were all struck by
It. .She took occasion soon to interrupt
the- Count and bade us good-by with a
charming smile and almost a look of
pleading. We felt as If she had begged
our pardon collectively and individually.
The next day I wrote to her to ask for
a photograph and she replied at once,
sending:' several^ which she said had been
taken : by .her. eldest . son... and which she
herself thought were* . good likenesses.
Each " one bore her autograph, which I

"Well, here > I stay until she returns,"

down in the hall and looked â¢ defiance at
the big 'Russian , servant ,in his - faultless
uniform and grand air. We had not long
to wait until one of the 'daughters came

then bade us welcome in perfect English

AMERICANS 7 WELCOME.
When we called at the Moscow, home we
went without letters of introduction 'of
any. sort, but our Russian guide told us
that being Americans, we would be sure
to be welcomed. But how to convey a
message of our nationality to Madame
Tolstoy was a different matter. The ser
vant at the door swore" that the Countess
was not in town. ' Then when' We . said we
knew she was, he swore that^she was
not at home. * "
Her receptions on Saturday when she is

It is perhaps not so strange after all
that she is not an enthusiastic follower
of her husband's extreme views, seeing
she has suffered such great deprivation
on account of them. She thinks many of
the Count's ideas are true, but she be
lieves that the . family has a right' to

terâSir: In reply to your letter: I was

"WILLIAM ' JAMES."
One thing in particular which has led to
comment on the King and Queen's inti
macy with the James is the general im
pression prevailing in. London society
that the latter are Americans. Having
heard it asserted .so often that Mr. James
was a, son of the stars and stripes I ven
tured to write him the other day. asking
if this was the case, and received from
him the following reply, which settles the
matter once and for all:
JAMES NOT AMERICAN.
London babies are for the first time
In London's history to have a hospital
of their own. A big building near Hamp
stead Heath, the happy hunting ground of
the London "cockney" on holidays, has
been secured. A long line of Duchesses
are on the committee of management,
the Duchesses of Teck and Portland lead
ing the list. The Question puzzling the
hospital at present is, "When is a baby
not a baby?" The age limit has yet to
be fixed, but it is likely no children over
two" years will hereafter be considered
qualified for admission.
Since Kins Edward came to the throne
it has been observed, in society circles
that "Willie" James and his wife have
excelled all their previous records in the
way of entertaining. The fast friendship
that exists between them and the King
and Queen is evidenced by the number of
private visits their Majesties pay to West
Dean Park, one of the loveliest homes In
England.
The Queen has always been a stickler
for observing court etiquette and society
is therefore somewhat astonished at the
familiarity- she encourages with regard
to the Jameses. It is rarely that sha
visits the house of a commoner and so
that she may not excite tne jealousy of
aristocratic big wigs she forbids the
Court Circular to . record her frequent
visits to West' Dean Park. There is an
other thing that compels her admiration
for Mr. James and his wife. They maka
It a rule never to paragraph the society
papers with the fact that they enjoyed
the company of the King and Queen on
such and such a day. with the result that
their Majesties'- visits grow more and
more frequent- The servant In. the James
household who is caught babbling about
the appearance of the King and Queen
on such occasions does not get time to
look out for a fresh place, but is ex
pelled there and, then.
Mrs. Adair. who was made almost ill

from her husband, the Irish soldier. But
she expects shortly to go on a visit to
her sister, Lady Barrymore. who lives In
a wonderful old place called Fota Island,
County Cork. Mrs. Adair and Lady Bar
rymore are daughters of the late General
Wadsworth of Civil War fame and all the
Wadsworths of "Washington and New
York are related to them. Miss Post,
daughter of Lady Barrymore by her
previous marriage with Mr. Post of New
York, is at Fota Island also.
MRS. ADAIR IN IRELAND
Her Royal Highness, it seems, has
looked with envy on the humble folk who
joyously make their way about London
on the omnibuses. But not until this sea
son did the idea arise within her that she,
too, might taste this delight. It was no
easy thing to gain the permission from
her father, but this has at last been ac
complished. His Majesty will permit his
daughter to enjoy herself after her
heart's desire if she does it "incog" and
under as much cover as possible.
From an Inside source the information
comes that the plan made by her Royal
Highness Is this:
Later In the autumn, when people ex
pect her to be at Sandringham and won't
look for her in town, Princess Victoria
and one of her ladles in waiting will
travel up to London unannounced, put up
at some quiet club or hotel and go in for
"busing." Her Royal Highness la said to
intend taking the longest and prettiest
rides, as well as the one so favored of
Americans, through Whitechapel and the
Petticoat Lane .district .T-'-
average royalties, and she is now
preparing for a tremendous adventureâ
the most thrilling of all her quiet career.
She is going riding on the top of an omni
bus. -
PRINCESS VICTORIA, the Kins'*
only unmarried daughter, is a
woman of Bohemian tendencies;
Bohemian, that Is, when con
trasted with the tendencies of
on in the world. It stands In a delight
ful garden and there is a brick wall seven
feet high surrounding it, so that the fam
ily live there almost as secluded as In
the country. The house Is low and two
storied, plastered on the outside, as it is
the custom in Russia, and with small
windows.
There is a small room on the first floor
where visitors are generally shown first,
then taken to "the drawing-room upstairs,
where the Counters is to be found. It
is a large room with a low ceiling, fur
nished very simply with. a few good pic
tures, a crand piano which both the
Count and Countess frequently use, and
a dainty tea table always -ready for a
passing guest.
Opening out from the drawing-room is
the Count's study, lined with books .and
portraits of friends in many parts of the
v;orld, and furnished with a fine old wal
nut writing desk. Before the Count's
long illness last winterâ an illness which
still har.gs on and necessitates the fam
ily*E remaining in the countryâ the Coun-;
less ppent many hours of each day with
her husband in this study, helping him in
hi* work.
The dining-room is furnished as simply
CAPABLE ENOUGH FOB, TWO.
There she lived for seventeen years in
a lonely, deserted place, miles away from
any town. Tolstoy was then going up
and down the Russian empire studying
social conditions and absent from home
for months at a time. The Countess at
tended to her houseworkâ they were too
poor to have many servantsâ she nursed
each one c f her thirteen children, she
dispensed with governesses and taught
them herself German, French and Eng
lish; gave them music lessons, made their
clothes and her own. Then as soon as
her husband began a book she began re
vising it, translating it from Russian into
French or German, copying it In her clear
handwriting so that the printer could read
itâ she is about the only person who can
make head or tail of the Count's writ
ingâand attending to the publication of
the book when it was finished.
And every night during these long,
lonely seventeen years at Polyana she
dressed herself for dinner with all the
dignity that a Countess Tolstoy, wife of
the head of one of the noblest families in
Russia, should observe. She never had a
beautiful or costly gown for many years,
but she always managed to appear like
the great Jady she is, and she had a few
wonderful old Jewels which were family
heirlooms.
Count Tolstoy pays no attention at all
to the royalties on his books, and he even
Â¦went so far vears ago as to declare to
bis wife that they had no right to re
ceive money for his work. But as the
family property had to be sold piece by
piece to ect the money to buy bread for
the children Countess Tolstoy rebelled and
threatened to leave him unless he let her
collect the money which was due to him.
Â£he thought they had as much right to
it as the publishers who were getting rich
from the Count's books. So now all the
business is transacted through her.
THE HOUSE IN MOSCOW. f
She has paid off all the debts on the
estate and a few years ago she bought
a pretty little house In Moscow, which
gives her a chance to see something of
life and people and know what is going
LOICDON, Oct 10.â Philosophers,
authors, teachers, those who' go
to learn, those who go to wor
ship at the shrine of Count Tol
stoy, those who take the long
trip out to Yasnaya Polyana for
mere curiosity's sake, all of them catch
only fleeting glimpses of the wonderful
woman. Countess Tolstoy. Those who go
to the Tolstoy home on businessâ as I
hare lately done â pee more of her and ap
preciate to the full the fact that but for
her Tolstoy would to-day be a beggar; a
decrepit Invalid with his physical pow
ers wasted and gone years ago; practical
ly unknown to the world, without pub
lishers to scatter his teachings broad
cast es soon as he is ready to give them
forth.
Perhaps this sounds rather strong, but
the writer, who has sepnt some days in
the Tolstoy family, has had excellent op
portunities of judging of the great nov
elist's wife and has since had a rather
definite idea that she has deserved a
larger share of her husband's fame than
the public has generally accorded to her.
Madame Tolstoy, handsome, highly ed
ucated, practical, has been the power be
hind the throne, engineer of the elaborate
Tolstoy machinery, which so speedily
would have gone to smash without her.
She persists in keeping herself in the
background and is quite content to re
main unknown. But if she survives her
husband, as is more than likely, as she is
twenty years his Junior, she probably will
yet have the recognition which her intel
lectual powers and accomplishments
should bring her.
When Count Tolstoy met her she was a
mere girl, the daughter of a physician in
Moscow. He was already a jaded man of
the world, with etrange religious ideas
Just beginning to crop out. He knew the
women of the Russian aristocracy well,
and had decided In his own mind that
there were no good women in the world
and that he would never marry.
So, ix> his customary erratic way, he
sold the lovely old mansion on his coun
try estate, which had come to him
through his grandfather, one of Cather
ine th* Great's famous generals. Then
he met the Countess and she changed the
whole world for him. They were mar
ried in 1S62 and she began her life of con
stant self-sacrifice by going out to a lit
tle hut on the Polyana estateâ all that
was left of the big house.

MISS ISIDORE RUSH, WHO TALKS TO THE INTERVIEWER OF HER
GOWNS,, OF COMIC OPERA AND OF NATURALNESS AS THE KEY
TO DRAMATIC SUCCESS. ;
Plays and the Players
George Fawcett's third annual play con
test is now^.under way, and several man
uscripts have already reached him at his
home theater. Chase's.. Baltimore, where
his company Is permanently located. "The
Favor of the Queen." in which Miss Percy
Haswell is to be starred this season under
Mr. Fawcett's management, was the win

one.- while a first-class production is guar
anteed of the winning play. Manuscripts

"GERTRUDE G. *N0RRI3."
William A. Brady, under whose direc
tion Wilton Lackaye la to star In "The
Pit." and Chanrting Pollock, who adapt
ed the play from Frank Norris* novel,
announce the. receipt of the following
self-explanatory letter: "1 have -Just
finished reading your drama of 'The Pit'
and both Mra. Frank Norrls and myself,
his, mother, are immensely pleased with
the, character of Jadwin. It is faithful
to the original in the book and. faithful
to the original manâ the character was
drawn from life. I think the closing
scene of the first act, where Corthell dis
covers the scattered rose leaves, 'very
good and the whole piece Is as striking
a dramatization a3 I have ever seen.
Both Mrs. Frank Norrts and myself wish
for a box the first night of The Pit's'
presentation in Chicago.
gis in "The Politician," and the first man
nish girl on the stage. ..,'".
"Tnie, too true," laughed the accused.
"Every man that has had his tie stolen
and his studs 'hooked* has me to thank
for it. But I was a nice, innocent, bil
lowy .girl before that, whose only loves
were linings and . lingerie. But Clemen
tina Sturgls was great fun. ' I used to
study every new tie, and collar, and cuff
that went up Fifth avenue. And I'd
watch eVery boy's walk. Then when
Clementina came to town every school
girl copied the *walk, and the raid on
brother's drawer . began. Oh, I've much
to answer for! Still, there were draw
backs. AH the suffragists used to come
to call on me, to ask my opinion on the
suffrage question. K Just as'.lf I wanted to
vote!"
"You don't?"
VNp; we" have enouch to do as it is," I
think," decided Miss Rush.
S "You were with, Roland Reed, sthen?"
I asked, for Miss Rush is the widow of
this clever American comedian and was
his, leading woman for years. "I had not
the pleasure of seeing Mr. Reed, nor. 'The
Politician.' " ,"
Mrs. Reed's sunny face looked proudly
out of the shadow that glanced across it,
as , she said: "You ; missed | seeing then
pardon meâ one of the greatest American
comedians. American, straight ., through
and buttoned up the v back."
"You began with' Mr.: Reed?" . j
"Yes, in '90, ; thirteen years aero," she
answered, "as leading ; womanâ the dignity
of it all, if you please." ' >
"How did you manaee'that?". . '.:Â¦Â¦;Â¦'. 'Â¦
Â¦ Then she Â¦. told _ mo in- her neat, rapid
English, as trim as her. gown.'of her.un
usual experience.' '
"I. went to'New York /one day deter-
IT was not rudeness but simple eelf
protection that led me to precede
Isidore Rush as we took the- Palace
elevator.
"Do you know Hiss Rush when
you see her?" I had asked the white
capped maid, the only Jerry's blooming
successor, as I sent up my card. I had
not then seen the Lady Holyrood of the
current "Florodcra."
The maid did not, but soon returned to
the little reception-room where I waitedâ
nice girl!â to tell me that Miss Rush had
been described to her and that she would
point her out to me.
It was kind, but superfluous. I had
only to trust to my knowledge of the
actress as a woman whose gowns are the
admitted despair of her rivals to be eafe.
If there were two Isidore Rushes they
would hardly cross the same orbit at the
eame time, and I knew the lady immedi
ately for herself as a slim, taut figure,
smartly sheathed in simple blacks, stood
before me. I had the unspeakable negli
gence, however, to forget to obtain the
maid's description. My own, undoubtedly
less picturesque, must serve. '
But it was clearly impossible that 1
thould follow Hiss Rush to the elevator.
I had no ardent desire to be taken for her
maid and the Inference would have been
inevitable with my workaday garb tag
ping after that poem In black etamine!
The conjunction of her incarnate neat
ness was difficult enough and had I been
addicted to the safety pin habit I think
I should have utterly collapsed. How
ever, we reached the parlors without dis
aster to my pride and immediately nes
tled into the obvious kubject of gowns.
Miss Rush took the rocking chair, but
was up again in a moment, joyfully in
sisting on my full taking-in of her 114
poundsâ "in Turkish bath costumo, I al
ways say," she ended with careful.frank
ness.
-I was quite willing to look at the ac
tress, as she explained that she was once
the "too much" of 155 pounds.
Perhaps five feet five at a generous es-
timate is Miss Rush, but looking nruch
taller. She Is broad shouldered and .slim
hipped, with not a line of her, blurred in
the drawing. The gownâ there is so much
of Hit* itwrii besides her 114 pounds in
her gownâ was pleated from neck almost
to hem. where it flared out in finny fash
ion into a slim train. A collar, tiny,
white, trim, tautly clasped her slender
rock and at the waist behind was the ac
tress' one bit ot jewelry, a diamond
horseshoe. The hat was also black, with
a drooping veil that gave the one willful
line of the picture.
For the rest Miss Rush Is not unlike
a slim Lillian Rupsell. Her hair is bright
gold, eyes big and blue, and -She has a
mouth that holds as sunnily infectious
Fmlle as you will find. The coloring is
clear red and white and obviously home
made.
"I say 114 pounds because it sounds so
well," Miss Rush went on, lifting her
arms lightly for me to take them in.
"How did you manage It?"
"Punching the* bag, medicine balls, rid
ing, clubs and so on," she laughed, her
blue eyes dancing. She put back her
shoulders, flat as a West Pointer's, as if
every muscle obeyed orders, and bent
lithely this way and that in puro en
joyment.
"Oh no! I shan't come apart," she
laughed, as I looked a little alarmed for
the relations of her skirt and waist.
"Couldn't if I wanted to. I hate women
thRt come apart and safety pins and belts
and things. Don't you?"
I did, wondering if these were also on
Mary MacLane's humorous litany of
hates.
"this dressâ all my dressesâ are in one
piece," the fortunate, lady, pursued. "I
can put them on in one minute and know
that there isn't any divorce at the waist."
Ladies, Miss Rush fastened at the back
and her skirt, slightly yoked at the top'
was beaded with a piping as .thick as a
strip of vermicllli. boiled.
"Do you always fasten at the back?" I
asked, awe-fully.
"Not at all," she replied. "I've a gun
metal uown that buttons from the neck
to the hra down the front."
"And is joined at the waist?"
"And is Joined at the walst-always "
"I fancy most of us are given to the
shirt waist habit because of Its econ
omy." I ventured.
"But look at tho laundry bills," said
practical Miss Rush, taking her rocking
chair again.
"Anyway, you were the inventor of the
shirt waist girl," I accused Miss Rush,
who was the original of Clementina Stur-
She-.just talks them,- you know."
"You're exactly Lady Holyrood," I ex
claimed suddenly, the chic, fluffy widow
of Sl Florodora fI and "Tact", looming up
before, me.
"I like the part," Miss Rush confessed.
"It's a thankful sort of role. I've always
been a â a â flippant comedienne" â she
phrased it. "I had a semi-musical en
gagemen.t before this, by the way, with
the Rogers Bros. I followed Delia Fox
there as Belle Money in 'In Central
Park.* " .
"One of the Fischer girls Is their lead
ing lady now," I added.
"Ah, yes. Lillian Coleman. Very pretty
girl, iarge eyes, sweet contralto, graceful,
I can see her. now." Miss Rush said, and
I noted the same unstudied kindness In
her attitude toward every Derson men
tioned during our chat.'
, "And- you like musical comedy?" I
asked then.
"Oh, yes! And I'm going on with It,"
she bubbled enthusiastically. . "I'm re
hearsing now for The Medal and" the
Maid,', to be produced in January next,
another musical comedy. Yes, I enjoy
the life altogether. Of course, the one
night stands are a little monotonous and
"it isn't so cheerful to come on and be gay
when you've had no sleep for two nights,
Â¦ as it was with me -our first night here.
But we have to take the bitter with the
sweet. And when one gets an audience
of nice people in front It's like a cocktail,
pulls you together immediately."
f 'Of course you areâ you all areâsensi
tive to your audience?" â
"I know whether they want me or not
after my second line," she earnestly put
It. "You have very wonderful companies
here in the summer, they tell me," she
said then, unexpectedly.
I told her of the summer harvest, and
more particularly of the splendid com
pany Henry MiUer brought here last year.
_, "Lawrance d'Orsay!" Miss Rush repeat
ed, from my list of the Miller people.
"Why, Mr. d'Orsay Is the hit of years in
â¢The Earl of Pawtuckef this season in
New York."
I told her Mr. d'Orsay had a very busy
press agent who told me so every week.
Also that from my Impressions of Mr.
d'Orsay; I was constrained to believe the
press agent.
"It is a*-matter of personality with
D'Orsay," the actress said. "He â erâ
reeks with personality," Which I thought
a very good way of saying that D'Orsay
cannot say two words like any one but
Mr. d'Orsay. :
"You said a while ago," I recalled,
"that you did not believe in the dramatic
schools." . Â»
"I suppose I shouldn't say that?" shÂ«
said, "butÂ»I believe it.. Now, : why,">and
she leaned forward earnestly, "why
should I use my. hand "likeâ Mrs. Wheat
croft,' sayâ to express some emotion? We
don't all use the same words to express
-thoughts. Why should we use the same
gestures? 1 find that most: actresses
taught in echools have simply to unlearn
most of the things they have been taught
before they can succeed. It is simply a
matter of being perfectly natural."
"Now, Miss Rush, isn't that absolutely
the most difficult art of , all?" # I asked,
"to be. natural, not oniy in another per
son's clothes, but in hl3 phraseology, in
his mental habits, in his emotional togs?"
"Yes, in that way," she granted. "But
my contention 'is that the cut and dried,
catalogued rules for doing these things
that are dealt out to you in* the schools
are a hindrance rather than a help and
that your own intelligence will place you
there* much more quickly." V . . .
"But what of the use of the voice and
. that kind of thing7"
>."The 1 less elocution the better." Miss
Rush r sized up the , situation. "VÂ»*hen the
actor has the elocutory Instinct it is good
. by * to . his .' naturalness.*,* Â¦
-"I mean rather the ability to throw the
voice over the footlights, pronunciation,
enunciation and that kind of thing?"
"What is the stage manager for?" MI33
Rush queried.
"But will the stage manager concern
himself with .such elementary needs?"
"If any girl will go to her stage man
ager and say, *I want to come down an
hour earlier to study that part with you.
I'm not sure of my interpretation. Will
you go over It with me?' the stage man
ager. I assure you. would then begin to
think the girl had something in her."
"But the time. Miss Rush":"
"Most of them would be only too glad
to give It," she said. "Now, for exam
ple, I had never kicked In my life when
I went to the Rogers Brothers, but the
stage manager there gave me the steps
I had to have and I practiced five hours
a day on them until I had them. And
Mr. Sea more would go through part.*
with me, suggesting a gesture, correcting
a wrong Inflection, pronunciation and so
on. all of which I would put on the fly
leaf of my part and go to my own room
to work out."
"The French are great believers In their
dramatic school, the Conservatoire."
"But they overactâ Bernhardt, for ex
"You feel that?"
"Very much," said Miss Rush. "In
'Tosca,' for example, her arms are always
In the air" â throwing up her own, shim
mering through the etamlne to illustrate.
"To me, the less gesture with the Illusion
the better. You and I don't do that so*t
of thing, talking' here."
"But we're not 'Toscas,' I laughed.
"Then again there is the fact that actirg
la not being perfectly natural, but look
ing It, and that to look natural everything
must be slightly exaggerated- But this ia
getting overdeep and it's late." Misa
Rush had told me that she was going out
riding in Golden Gate Park.
"Ah, the horseshoe," I had replied.
"All the jewelry you wear?"
And Miss Rush, as we came out, one of
.the most famous experts on rubies in tho
country, and with a collection of gems
that looks like a Tiffany warehouse, said.
"Yes, I think stage people are sufficiently
conspicuous" without gems en the street.
Don't you?"
Advisedly, as I regarded the miraculous
simplicity beside me sllhoucted against a
drab wall, I replied "Yes."

Oro Fino Circle of Jackson was found in
a nourishing- condition, and the work was
exemplified by the initiation of eight
Etrangers. This was by the officers, as
sisted by a drill team, and these did so
well that, under the good for the order,
the visiting supreme officers bestowed
many words of praise upon those who
officiated, dwelling particularly upon the
manner in which the floor work was pre
sented and the secret work rendered.
During the evening a beautiful banner
was presented to the circle. After the
business meeting there was a banquet
at which the most tempting dishes were
chicken and ravioli. The supper was
greatly enjoyed as to a.11 things on the
table by all except the supreme sub chief,
who drew the line at ravioli. This circle,
noted for its hospitality and loyalty to
the higher officers, had transformed its
meeting place into a bower of evergreens
and flowers and did everything to make
the visit enjoyable. The following even

companied the visitors to Sutter Creek

rt^iderits of Jackson. At Sutter Creek
trÂ« visitors were welcomed by Compan
ions Richards and Muprford, who escorted
them to the hall of Diana Circle, which
was tastefully decorated with ferns and
flowers. There was nn exemplification of
the work and the officers proved their
ability to perform it in an acceptable
manner. The officers and members of the
circle were complimented, the former for
their efficiency &i<l all for their loyalty
to the order, and the hope was expresed
â¢by the supreme chief that the circle will
continue in the good work until it be
comes the banner circle of the northern
part of the State. The close of the meet-

collation. The following: evening Com

And while no serious damage was done

unfortunate and no possible good can
come of it. The Daughters have banded

plucks out the weeds and undergrowths
of selfishness and indulgence, that, over
running the human soul that lives only
within itself, leaves it barren of fruit and
without the perfume that comes of good
deeds and clean thoughts.
A SOCIETY girl! Here indeed is a
classification that has suffered
eadly from careless usage and
to the popular mindâ which, by
the way, is not given to o'er
dcep thinkingâ carries with it a
mental picture of a butterfly maiden,
flitting here and flitting there, sipping of
sweets in the golden sunshine, blissfully
content- in the pursuit of her pleasures
and in the glorification of her beautiful
self and her trappings; who. like the but
terfly, knows not the wherefore of her
being, nor the relation she bears to the
scheme of life as planned by the Father.
Her pleasures, her possessions, her grati
fications mark the circumference of her
life as she lives it, and mother, father and
friends are valuable only in so far as they
contribute to her Elysiaa life. The sick
ness, the sorrows, the sufferings of the
world have no part in her lifeâ and thus
she drifts on forever in a turquoise sea
in a gilded bark!
Now, to him who knows her as she isâ
not as fancy paints herâ this popular con
ception of the society girl is not only ab
surd and ridiculous, but is absolutely un

community. But in our own city by the

themselves the, tasks of lightening bur
dens wherever they find the heavy laden,
of softening the sorrows of children and
tempering the trials of the aged. To find
in our blue book a name that is not in
some way connected with a charity would
prove a weary search; hospitals attract
the tender ministrations of some, sewing
societies for needy children others; ser

that brought out the "conduct unbecom

who visited her and her sister in New

sister's chair. Now that certainly was
reprehensible conduct m any gentleman,
but in a naval officer it was scandalous.
