CHEMIST FINDS EVIDENCE OF POISON
IN THE BODY OF LATE COLONEL BEST
AND DECLARES THAT HE WAS MURDERED
mystery, of the disappearance of certain organs from the body of IV. J. Best, the New York capitalist, zi'ho died under sus-
M. picious circumstances on April 6 while under the care of "Doctor" John D. Woods and his reputed sister at their home in San
Rafael, was cleared yesterday by the admission of W. G. Ward, who embalmed the body. He says that he removed the organs
during the process of embalming and consigned them to a sewer. The Marin County officials are confident of convicting Woods
and his alleged sister of grand larceny when they are appreiiended, and hope that confinement may break them down and cause them
to confess to the murder, which the officials feel positive was committed.

William G. Ward, the undertaker em

ter his death, made a full statement ti.is
evening regarding his connection with the
case, and it fully exonerates Sawyer and
Woods from any blame la the matter ot

also ample evidence ready to show that
the physical condition of the late capi

Woods and his reputed sister.
One witness was found by Detective
Frank H. Depue to-day who is willing to
testify that between April 1 and April Â».
when Woods represented to others, in
cluding the dead man's son, that Colonel
Best was in a comatose condition in his

LONDON, July 9.â Informally welcom
ing the American naval officers to Eng
land to-night, King Edward made an em
phatic declaration in favor of closer re
lations between the United States and
England. The King did not speak of an
alliance, or even an understanding, but
the impression was clear from his re
marks that he desired that the two na
tions move together In the interests of
the peace of the world: Some of- the
King's Ministers also impressed upon the
American officers their cordial approval
of the Monroe doctrine and their desire
that it be supported by' American influ
ence in a way which would place it above
all criticism.
The royal welcome was extended to the
American officers at Buckingham Palace,
where at 8:30 o'clock commenced the din
ner given in their honor by Kins, Ed
ward. The table was decorated with
Marechal Neil roses and gold plate

On the conclusion of the dinner the
King in a tactful speech expressed grat
ification at the acceptance of his Invita
tion and cordially welcomed Rear Ad
miral Cotton' and his* squadron to Eng
land. He asserted that what he said rep
resented the sentiment not only of him
self but of the whole, British people and
he proposed a toast to President. Roose
velt, for whom, the King said, he "en
tertained the highest consideration and
admiration."
Embassador Choate responded and in
an eloquent epeefch echoed the wish of
the King for - the maintenance and pro
motion of more cordial relations between
the two great English-speaking nations.
The King further emphasized his grat
ification by' writing at the table a mes
sage to President Roosevelt, in which he
stated that It had given him the greatest
pleasure to welcome the American squad
ron. King Edward's cordiality made a
great Impression on the American officers,
who left the function convinced of the
desire on the part of Great Britain to
maintain the closest relations with the
American republic.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, July 9.â In order
! that there may be an even more thor
ough prosecution of persons who are vio
lating the laws of the United States by
the peonage system In Alabama. Attor
ney General Knox has appointed Julius
Sterafelt special counsel to Assistant
i'nlted States District Attorney Reese at
Montgomery, Ala.
The extent to which this system of hold-
Ing men In servitude for debt has been
practiced in Southern States Is shown by
the facts that two weeks ago nearly 100
Indictments/had been found; that since
then several scores of Indictments have
' been found and additional cases prepared,
and that the number of offenses which
will be prosecuted before the hand of
justice will be stayed in Alabama alone
may reach nearly 1000.
The same system prevails in Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Miss
issippi and Texas. It is the policy of the
Department of Justice to have these of
fenders prosecuted with the utmost
vigor, in order to stamp out the abuse.
For the most part the persons guilty are
well-to-do planters, contractors or man
ufacturers. In league with whom, in al
most every instance, are local ' or State
authorities.
Constables, Justices of Peace, Mayors,
and County Judges are in the conspiracy.
They work with men who are on, the
lookout for unfortunate negroes who ere
in debt or who may have been fined, a
trifling amount in order to get their
service for almost nothing and bold them
in actual slavery, surrounded by armed
guards. â¢ â¢ -
The department is much interested In
the outcome of the appeal which has
been taken in the first conviction in
these cases. The case in question Is that
of S. N. Clyatt of Florida. Clyatt. was a
producer of naval stores. He held in
servitude a number of negroes who owed
trifling debts. Tlfe negroes escaped and
Clyatt's armed guards pursued and ar
rested them, dragging them back to
slavery, just as runaway slaves were ap
prehended before the war. This case was
tried in the Northern District of Florida,
at Tallahassee, and, on two convictions,
Clyatt was sentenced to four years in a
Federal prison. His appeal has been ar
gued before the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals at New Orleans and
the decision Is expected any .day.
Influence has been .exerted In vain to
induce the Department of Justice to cease
its efforts to break up this un-American
system." It is said, here that the very
best sentiment in South â¢ is enlisted
on the side of the Department of Jus
tice and Democrats- and Republicans
alike are giving the department encour
agement in its efforts.
Judge Jones, before whom the cases In
Alabama are being tried, is a Democrat.
His language in sentencing prisoners who
have been convicted is very severe.

m tEW YORK, July 9.â Despite the
f\/ revelations of the autopsy, on the
Ji T body of Colonel William Best, no
steps have been taken by the New
Jersey authorities, so far as can be as
certained, to find Dr. John Woods and his
wife. Warrants for the arrest ' of the
doctor and his wife on a charge of grand
larceny are now In the hands of : a de
tective . en ' route East.
It was thought -Woods might -return to
the home of : his mother,'' as he did once
before when; be was In 'difficulty.* With
her husband and ! her, elder son .she , lives
in "Union . Hill. N. ''Â¦'' J..' Her ' husband , Is a
laborer and heir | son- Is ; a helper ... in a
butcher store. .Whenithe son was 'seen to
night he said: Â¦'Â¦ â¢
â¢;';\Vo have not â¢ the slightest idea j where
John and his wife are. We have not seen
him in ; nearly^ three ; years, and . when he
came he .was in trouble. We* regard Tilm
as the b|ack sheep of the family."
It haÂ« been i learned ithat Miss â¢ Shope,
whose name] was attached to ; one^'-of
Woods' ? receipted' 1 Uls,' was : a'? nurse ' in
Steelton, Pa,, when "Woods . was ; a phy
sician | to^ the employes of ' the' Steel ton
Iron ' Company. . She was hired by him
to nurse his -, wife while. she was. 111. ;
-.When, .about a year ago. Woods and
his wife "were starting for California they
tried ,to ;. persuade Miss , Shope . to accom
pany I them, but Â¦ her friends , prevailed .' on
her not to . co. ;: This ? is taken as proof
that sha /was not' lnCSan with
them,' and therefore the receipt arid her
name signed to it Is probably a forgery. ,
, The sons of Best say , ; that Judging- by
the information which; has reached Â¦ them
'their' father had; learned , the real charac
ter of Woods and. had done or said some
thing which had 'offended him."
../â¢When.MissjHIckmott was in this city,"
said \ Alfred . Best. - "she told me -she was
in Woods' office on the day .myffather ar
rived in San* Rafael. " He ,werit ; to Woods'

SAf* RA.FAEL.July 9.â All mys
tery regarding the disposal of
the stomach and. other organs
of the late William J. Best,
whose peculiar death here and
the subsequent developments
surrounding it have . aroused widespread
interest, . was cleared to-day by the ad
mission of William G. Ward, the under
taker who embalmed the body, that he
removed the organs and disposed of them.
He says they, were consigned to a sewer.
They. have before now been resolved Into
their original elements by the waters of
the bay. ? ) ': â¢ Â¦*Â¦Â¦
The officials, both here and In the East,
who are prosecuting the case 'believe
firmly that the dead man fell a victim to
the : deadly potions administered to him
by â¢ "Woods under the guise of medical
treatment, but the loss of all the organs
which : could show the presence of poison
in the system' prevents the primary fact
being established that a murder was com
mitted,' " and consequently precludes the
prosecution of ' any one ; for ' a crime that
cannot be established.^.,' ...
This state of affairs is extremely disap
pointing to District Attorney Boyd and
the other officials who have been engaged
In ; ferreting .out the . alleged crime. Since
the advices â¢ received , from the Eastern
physicians who performed. an autopsy on
Colonel' Beat's , remains they have become
convinced -that his death was due to foul
means, -'and * believe. _' that^ Woods was re
sponsible for their employment. The fact
that he did not die* from apoplexy, as was
stated ;in i the' ; death certificate signed ; by
Woods iand Dr. Jones,' was a clincher to
the suspicions they had already enter

f B. Baldwin, chemist of the Newark. Board of Health,
said to-day as a result, of 'the preliminary chemical test
â¢ which he had made of one piece of intestine -found ad
hering to the body of Colonel Best' that he had found traces of a
powerful irritant poison. .Dr. Baldwin. said: ,.:'...:
"In my opinion the discovery of ; this poison 'offers sufficient
grounds upon which to base a charge of â¢ murder ; by poisoning.
All evidence I have deduced so far from the absence i of i the or
gans, which would most likely show traces of poisoning, and the
substitution of sawdust, shows â¢ clearly ., that Best was : killed by
some poison injected into the vital organs.
"District Attorney Chandler Pelser of Newark tells me there
is no reason why Essex County should assume, the expense of in
vestigating this crime, which was committed another' State. ; I
may be empowered to make an ; examination or the two remaining
organs may be sent in sealed jars to the; authorities in' California,

fi="rf=3 HE celebration of the fifty-sev-
I enth anniversary of the raising of
1 the American flag in California
**â¢ was observed yesterday morning
In Portsmouth square. * Â¦
The exercises were under the auspices
of the Associated Veterans of the Mexi
can War of 1846-8, and the Sloat Monu
ment Association. These had the co-op
eration of the Veteran Exempt Fire Com
pany and the gallant United- States bat
tery of Light Artillery, the latter taking
part by order of Major General MacAr
thur, commanding the Department of
California.
A little after 9. o'clock the Interesting
proceedings were begun by Major Edwin
A. Sherman, a veteran of the Mexican
War, wearing his sÂ«venty-four years-with
all the air and vigor of youth, introduc
ing Colonel Joseph StewarCU. S. A., a
retired president of the day. The gallant
colonel, though born In the long ago year
of 1822, stood amid his comrades, erect
as a youth, showing little of the nard ser
vice he had during a part of the-sixty
four years he had served his flag and
country.
Colonel Stewart came of age when serv
ing as a lieutenant of the United States
artillery at Fort Adams, R. I., on the
day when the lamented President Mc-
Klnley was born.
ASSEMBLAGE CHEERS.
The exercises were formally begun by
the colonel addressing the large" assem
blage in a few soldierly words, and then
the excellent band sent specially from the
Naval Training School at Yerba Buena
Island by Captain Bowman H. McCalla,
U. S. N., under the direction of Band
master J. P. Stanton, played, the "Navy
Forever," and ' the assemblage cheered
and cheered until the echoes resounded In
very quarter of ; the neighborhood.."
The exercises were continued by the reci
ting of a short prayer, which was fol
lowed .by the rendering of the national
hymn, "America.* finely sung by Alfred
Wilkie, accompanied by the naval band
and Joined by the hundreds of voices of
those who had gathered to assist . In ; the
celebration.
Then came the duty of reading the proc
lamation of Commodore John Drake
Sloat, which. In â¢ the absence in Lon
don df J. B. Whittemore, the late commo
dore's great-grandson, was ably deliver
ed by S. W. Boring.
The orders of Commodore Sloat,, the ad
dress and proclamation of Captain John
B. Montgomery, together with reports of
his lieutenants in connection with the rais
ing of the American flag at San Fran
cisco, Sonoma and other points, were re
cited by Major Sherman/
ANTI-CHINESE SPEECH.
While delivering an historical ; account
of the United States, Major Sherman,
prompted by . â¢ the sight i of - hundreds of
curious and interested : Mongolians on
roofs and at windows looking down upon
the veterans, paraphrased ; Tennyson's
"Charge of the Light Brigade," uttering
the following: / Â¦. c . ;
Chinese to left of ui,
Chinese to right of us.
Hall with Blind Justice In front of usâ
Some one has blundered. , *
The paraphrase was but the prelude tb
a scathing denunciation- of the tolerance
of the Americans, -as the major put tit,
in allowing the Chinese to remain in, the
country.
," He regretted to^see the heathens come
into America's' inheritance and In "the
name of the veterans; he. demanded^their
exclusion and return to their native coun
try. "jfBff|li|fflilt|l^^ Â¦Â¦-
The â¢ major then returned Â¦ to -the. inter-
est- which the celebration -had' awakened
In so many citizens, and in the name
of; the association of which he is a mem
ber he thanked the Exempt Fire Company
for the admirable arrangements it had
made ' for the observance of the day.
Alfred Wilkie gave* a- fine and impres
sive rendering of the patriotic song, "The
Sword of Bunker Hill," which was com
plimented with cheers.' The band then
struck up "Hail v Columbia," to. which and
to : the roaring' accompaniment of Â¦ a na
tional salute of twenty-one*guns'by the
United States battery of light artillery,
under command of Captain J. L. Hayden,
the Stars and Stripes were hoisted to the
top of the high- flag pole 'overlooking the
square by Comrade Isaac M. Baker, U.
-S. marine corps, retired, and Comrade W.
J. Hudson, acting for the Exempt Fire
Company.
AGED BATTLE HEROES.
.The .veterans then formed in, line and
marched for a little distance with the
battery of artillery and the day's pro
ceedings were left ,to be thought and
talked over by the citizens who had tak
en part in them. - â¢
Among those veterans of the
war who were present were Major Sher
man and Colonel Stewart and Orderly
Sergeant S. W. Boring, late of the* First
Illinois Cavalry. Sergeant Boring was
born in 1824 and fought under General
Zachariah Taylor, who was familiarly
known as "Old Rough and Ready," a
title earned because of the general's tact
and efficiency in fighting the Indians.
Boring was also in the Mormon war of
1844. -iF>\\
Major John L. Bromley, In his eighty
third year, and who fought under Gen
eral Winfleld Scott at the taking of the
City of. Mexico and all the preceding bat
tles, came upon the scene of celebration
with Â¦ the alertness that would be ex
pected of a youth of 20.
' Lieutenant W.'L. Duncan, another vet
eran of the Fourth Illinois Regiment, was
present, and In bearing showed not a
sign of advanced years.

SOME $145,000,000
WORTH OF EGGS
Amount of Business Which Is Done
by Our Hens Each
Year.
George Fayette Thompson of the Agri
cultural Department has written a trea
tise uyon the modern hen which contains
information of interest. In the first place
Mr. Thompson declares that the average
get-rlch-qulck concern stands in about
the same relation to an up-to-date hen
as does an ice wagon to an automobile.
As a rapid accumulator of financial re
sources the hen is in the same class as
oil wells and gold mines. The thoroughly
modern hen no longer wastes her time
hatching eggs. She leaves that work en
tirely to the incubator, while she devotes
jthe time thus gained to the more profita
ble labor of producing eggs. "
Consequently, Professor Thompson has
discovered that there is a proportionately
smaller number of fowls, but by the
adoption of labor and time savins: ma
chines the lesser number has been able to
produce a constantly Increasing output
of eggs.. The treatise contains so much
interesting information about the hen and
her product that Secretary^ Wilson has
determined to incorporate it, in' the forth
coming yearbook of the Department of
Agriculture. !
Professor Thompson, who is also a sta
tistician of reputation, has discovered
that In the city of New York* each family
of five persons consumes on an average,
four eggs a day. In Chicago, if it is ac
cepted that the city has reached a pop
ulation of 2.009,000, the ratio of egg con
suming is higher and every person In the
city manages to consume one whole egg
each day in the year.
The production of poultry and eggs is
the most profitable of all industries. Mr,
Thompson estimates that a thoroughly
modernized hen can realize 400 per cent
profit for her owner. In thirty-three
States and Territories the value of eggs
exceeds the value of the poultry product.
The egg product in the United States
amounts to more, when measured by dol
lars and cents, than the combined gold
and silver production. This does not take
the poultry into consideration at all.
' The value of the combined poultry and
egg product would be nearly double that
of the precious metals. The value of the
Industry Is just Fix times that of the wool
product. Still, eggs have taken only an
inconspicuous place in tariff debates. Pro
tectionists and tariff reformers are in a
perpetual row over wool, but the hen
makes no clamor for protection from Con
gress. Neither has there been any protest
against the introduction of machinery.
Prices did not fall with the. introduction
of the incubator. Instead, the poultry
raisers of the country devoted themselves
to the. education of the hen. so that she
would lay eggs during the time the old
fashioned fowl spent In sitting and tend
ing to her brood of chickens.
The grand total value of the annual out
put of eggs Is now 5145,000,000, while that
of poultry aggregates ' $139,090,000. Iowa
leads the States in the production of eggs,
the yearly product of that State being
100.000.000 dozen. Ohio comes next with
81.000,000 dozen. Illinois Is third with 86,
000.000 dozen, and Missouri fourth with 85,
000,000 dozen.- With tne exception of
Alaska and Hawaii, Montana pays the
highest price for eggs, the average price
being 20 cents a dozen. They are cheap
est in Texas, where the average price last
year was T& cents a dozen. The average
price for the 16,000,000.000 egg^which were
marketed in the United States last year
was 11.13 cents a dozen.
Professor Thompson resorts to the rail
way illustration as a means of impressing
upon the mind .the enormous proportions
of the egg Industry. The annual outp'ut
fills 43,127,272 crates holding thirty dozens
each. An -ordinary refrigerator car, which
has an average length of 42.5 feet, holds
409 crates. He maintains that a train' of
these cars sufficient to carry the annual
product would be SG6 miles long, or long
enough to reach from "Washington to Chi
cago and have several miles, to spare.
In closing. Professor Thompson says:
"The majority of the fowls of this coun
try are found in comparatively small
numbers on a very large number of farms,
where they gather their own subsistence
and receive practically no care. The con
sequence of this is that eggs are produced
at little cost. The development of this
industry to an extent incredibly , larger
than it is at the present time Is among
the easy possibilities."â Chicago News.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN BERNARDINO, July_ [ 9.â Mystery
continues to thicken with regard . to. Mrs.
Lena Schneider, the mysterious woman
who committed suicide at the" 'county hos
pital yesterday by taking opium. The
inquest was held last. evening andithough
nothing certain was brought, to light ai
to her husband, several of. ..the "hospital
attendants testified that -she. had stated
to them on several occasions- that he.wai
an inmate of the Napa Insane' asylum:
Who she is and from where she came,
even why she came- to this place,- is
shrouded in deepest mystery. When she
applied for admittance at the Institution
about a; year ago she .was dressed well
anTl had considerable Jewelry. All \.hef
wardrobe, and this Jewelry she had dia :
tributed among the inmates before she
took the fatal dose and it was the spirit
of unselfishness that won for her the un
usual good will of all about the institu
tion. Since her first entrance into the
hospltaPshe had been absent at Intervals;
but "never would talk of her visits away
nor give the least Inkling about her rela
tives. â¢
;, Five months ago she returned for the
last time and since then has had periods
when she would threaten suicide. Once
she stated that when she was ready to die
she knew where she could get something
that, would cause a speedy and painless
death, and at another time she referred
to the" matter as though it were a per
son who would supply the deadly â¢ poison.
Only a few days ago she stated that she
would soon call at. the depot for some
thing which she would take and die, and
though the popular opinion Is that she
got the deadly drug in town, yet her re
mark would tend to indicate that the
poison came through the express. Mon
day night she aroused the, head nurse and
informed her that the hour had arrived.
"I am not going to live; take these
rings, for if anything happens to me, they
are yours, and I don't want you to try
and pull me through. I want to die," she
said.
Nothing was thought of her remark,
and not until next morning was it really
known that she had actually taken a
drug. Dr. Meyer was then summoned,
and, though he knew instantly the nature
of the poison from" its effects, yet she
would not reveal what she had, taken.
He succeeded in rallying her several
times, but when she was thought to be
recovering she suddenly collapsed and
died, and it has been suggested that pos
sibly she managed to get the bottle of
opium.
From- occasional remarks she made
while dying it is almost certain that she
had an object in concealing her identity.
She was possessed of more than ordinary
refinement, was â¢ well educated, and,
though well along in years and an in
valid, yet there was still about her that
which suggested -past beauty. She was
buried in the city cemetery to-day,
dressed in a costly silk dress which was
found in her wardrobe at the hospital.

actly. but I should think that the stom
ach and intestines were among thorn. I
disposed of them by throwing them in thÂ«
cewer.
"My only object In removing these or
gans and disposing of them in thÂ« manner
2 did was hotter to conserve the body.
Tha remains were to be shipped n long
distance and I deemed It necessary In or
der that they might present a proper ap
pearance to the relatives In the Kes: to
remove these organs from the body. My
sole motive in doing so was that zny pro
fessional Judgment as an erabalmer dic
tated this course. I refilled that cavity
with sawdust in order that the contour
of the body might be preserved."
Asked If it was usual to remove the
Etomach and Intestines of bodies that
were being embalmed he said that it de
pended largely on the state of the body.
Its corpulence or thinness and other col
lateral reasons which differed In each in
dividual case.
NO AUTOPSY PERFORMED
"After I had opened the body." he con
tinued, "before 1 had removed any of the
organs, I telephoned to Dr. Jones, whose
name was signed to the death certificate,
asking him if ho wished to perform an
eutnjisy. Ho replied that none was neces
sary and I then went ahead with the em
lÂ«alirins. According to the statement of
Woods. Best died on April 6. His.rela
tives were notified and on April 9 a tele
pram was received from William Best at
Seattle authorizing the embalming of the
remains. They were removed to the un
dertaking establishment on that date am!
remained there until the arrival of Wil
liam Best from Seattle the day fol
lowing, when they were taken back to
Woods* residence. The day following they
were brought back to the undertaking es
tablishment and then placed on the train
en route to the East. I paw nothing
about the body that suggested death by
any other than natural causes." -
Dr. Jones, who signed the certificate
that Best came to his death from apo
plexy, is much disturbed over his connec
tion with the case. He bears a. high rep
utation in San Rafael and his friends are
extremely sorry for the unpleasant no
toriety that had been thrust upon him
?n the matter. He claims that he only
visited Best in a perfunctory manner on
two occasions and at neither time did he
make an extensive diagnosis of his con
dition. He thought he was suffering from
come derangement of the etomach, and
had every confidence that Woods was
treating his patient properly. He said
that Woods' intimate connection with the
faculty of the San Anselmo Theological
institute and leading members of San
Rafael society dispelled every suspicion
that he was other than he represented
himself to be and when he signed the
death certificate he did so believing
firmly that the facts therein were
true.
District Attorney Thomas Boyd is bend-
Ing every energy for the apprehension of
A\ oods and his alleged sister la order that
they may be returned to San Rafael. So
far the only f6rmal complaint against
them is that of grand larceny. When
they are caught and brought within the
Jurisdiction cf the Marin County courts
other charges may be preferred.
"I have chosen to proceed en the grand
larceny charges," said Boyd. "because we
â¢re reasonably certain to convict them
en that count. As regards the murder,
personally I am satisfied that Woods
made away with Colonel Best by means
cf poison and was aided and abetted In
the crime by his alleged sister. This be.
lief is strengthened to absolute convic
tion by the advices from the East that
Colonel Best did not die from apoplexy.
However, it is an entirely different mat
ter to prove this to a Jury and I do not
care to rush blindly into such a serious
undertaking and then make a failure of
it. I will be satisfied for the time if I
can secure their persons here in Marin
County- on the grand larceny complaints.
Once here I have hopes of fastening the
greater crime upon them."
On what these hopes were based he
would not disclose, but it is thought that
the officials rely upon one or both of the
accused persons breaking down.
DESCRIPTIONS BROADCAST.
To-night District Attorney Boyd re
ceived a telegram, from the Chief of Po
lice of Philadelphia asking for a full
description of the fugitives and the fol
lowing was sent to the heads of the po
lice departments in all of the large cities
of the East:
"Woods is about 40 years of age, but
looks younger. He is smooth-shaved,
has a eharp, narrow face, dark hair and
blue eyet; he is five feet eight inches
in height and very elender in build; is
a fine conversationalist and a gentleman
in dress and appearance. The woman has
little hair and false upper teeth filled
*ith sold. She is five feet three inches
In height and has a hooked nose. She
will pretend to be insulted If approached
by an officer. The child has gray eyes,
brown hair and round features; she is
6 years old and attractive."
A roll of kodak films was found to-day
In the house formerly tenanted by Woods
and the woman who passed as his sis
ter. The films were discovered by the
present occupant of the house and turn
ed over to District Attorney Boyd. who
had prints taken from them. They proved
of no value in the present case.
Detective Depue spent most of the day
searching for the missing organs of the
remains. He made a thorough .examina
tion of the basement and yard of the
house where Woods lived, but failed to
find am indication that anything had
been buried there. An abandoned well
in the rear of Sawyer's undertaking
place was also examined without result.
After Ward's return from Oakland," where
he had gone to conduct a funeral, and
the issuance of his statement regarding
the disposition of the micsing organs, all
further inquiry along that line was aban
doned.

Hickmott told me that at that time her
parents were opposed to her marriage, to
Woods and had urged her to Join them In
a long trip out of the city. She was tell
ing this to Woods In my father's pres
ence and she told me that as she ended
my father said to her he would advise
her to take the trip with her parents by
all mean.".
"This may have displeased Woods, who
was wo'rkJns; every end to make the girl
his Â¦wife, and he may have suspected, too,
that my father had made some discover
ies about him that were not to his credit.
As his whole future depended on his mar
riage to Miss Hlckmott. whose father Is
wealthy, it may be he decided to run no
chances of having his real character re
vealed. This raay have been the motive,
if a crime was committed by him."
By request of Inspector McClusky. the
Best brothers gave a full description of
Woods and his wife, whom they had seen
at Atlantic City. A general alarm was
sent out to-night by Inspector McClusky
for the arrest of Woods and the woman.

Â£i. When, shortly after
sunrise, * Dr. Lapponi
went -to see the Pope, he found
him in the attitude of prayer.
On the doctor inquiring
whether he required anything,
his Holiness replied : "To-day
finishes a week [since I was
taken ill. I am thanking God
for having given me ; strength
to still pray to him."
The injections given by Drs.
Mazzoni and Lapponi had in
part the desired effect, as the
Pope succeeded in getting some
sleep during the night.
j%OME, July, 9.-Mgr. Volpini, who
MJ was stricken with syncope yester-
day, died early this morning, short
ly after the in attendance had
announced that all hope of saving his
life- had been abandoned. Although the
condition of the Pope is still , tho center
of Interest, the case of 'Mgr.' Volpini has
attracted much attention, not , only be
cause of his office _ of secretary to the
consistorial 'congregation/, to " which ''- he
Death Deprives
Mgr. Volpini of
Cardinal's Hat
Three Eminent Prelates and the Metropolitan Church of the' Holy See.
The tragic death of Mgr. Volpinl was
carefully kept from the Pope throughout
the day. It was at first thought that It
would be necessary to Inform. the Pontiff
in order that Mgr. Volplnl's 'successor
to the office of secretary' of the consis
tory might be nominated, but after dis
cussion by the Vatican authorities it was
decided that the precedents admitted the
nomination of a secretary withouuthe In
tervention of the Pope. The^chief impor
tance of the. position is felt at the time
of a conclave, so that If It be considered
essential to fill Mgr. Volpini's place Car
dinal Camerlango will designate a secre
tary of the consistory. This procedure
will ' permit the news of Mgr. Volpini's
death being withheld from the Pope in
definitely- 'Â«>.-
When the amelioration in the condition
of the Pope presented favorable symp
toms yesterday morning Pope Leo decid
ed, after receiving Cardinal Rampolla, to
receive also all of the other Cardinals liv
ing in Rome, to the number of about
twenty-five, as a special mark of his grat
ification at the sympathy they had shown.
Cardinals Oregalla, Gotti and Delia Volpe
were received and held a short conversa
tion with his Holiness, but soon after
ward the dangerous condition of the pa
tient developed, compelling Dr. Lapponi to
stop tha otner receptions.
When a consultation was decided upon.
Dr. Rossoni being already in the ante
chamber. Dr. Lapponi cautiously inform
ed" the Pope that he had thought it bet
ter to ask the opinion and advice of an
other physician Jn view of the phases of
the disease being so variable. He added
that nothing grave had arisen, but that
Dr. Mazzoni and he, tnrough conscien
tious scruples, wished to interrogate their
colleagues. The Pope received, the. news
with calmness,' saying that' he .'would be
glad to see Dr. Rossoni. The latter, on
entering the bedroom, bowed to the Pon
tiff, saying he w-as highly honored to visit
him and tried to encourage the sick man.
The' Pope answered him, but In a weak
voice.
dinary calculations, they say, fail to ap
ply to this extraordinary case. One of
them remarked yesterday:
"Here is a man almpst a hundred years |
old retaining all of his mental and most
of his physical faculties and bravely com
bating the approach of death. Although
the conditions change from hour to -hour,
the essential conditions of mental alert
ness and physical vigor cdntinue unbrok
en. Never has there been tne slightest
lapse into incoherency." .1 Â¦-. *
Whatever "may be the outcome, the Vat
ican world has fully made up .its mind
that the demise df the. Pope ;ls onb' a
question of days at the- ra t 05t,. : a;n'd -111160-"!
ably only of hours. \Vith;'this - prevalenb'
view, every detail for conducting the" af-fV
fairs of the church during the inte-rrVg
num and for carrying out the election
of Pope Leo's successor is systematically
arranged, j Following advices from the
Vatican, the Cardinals throughout the j
world .are hurrying Rbmfiward, anticipat- â¢'
ing the - holding of a conclave for the !
choice of a Pope. These preparations are
undertaken in a spirit of profound grief
and as the performance of a sacred duty.
Throughout yesterday the court of the
Vatican leading to the Pope's apartments
was thronged by distinguished vis
itors seeking information aa to the Pope's^
condition. Practically the entire diplo-*
matic corps accredited to the Vatican was
among the inquirers, and many Cardinals
also were among the groups.
The popular solicitude for the Pope's
condition has led to an amelioration of
the rigid rules closing the entrances.
High and low corriine to ask about the
Pope's condition were equally admitted to
the inner court, where the bulletins signed
by the doctors were conspicuously exhib
ited.
One of the most remarkable features of
the sick room is the absolute simplicity
and the entire absence of the usual elab
orate equipments found in the sick rooms
of distinguished patients. There are no
trained nurses, the only attendants be
sides the doctors being the Pope's valets,
Centra an,d Dl Cestro. The doctors are
without a corps of assistants."^; rr;
SAD NEWS IS WITHHELD.
Following the i.ssi.anre. of this bulletin
the doctorc freely expressed their per
sonal convictions regarding the extreme
gravity of the case. Dr. Lapponi said,
without Qualification, that. the patient's
condition was beyond hope. He did not
expect a final collapse to-night, but rather
s. gradual sinking until the end came.
How long the'eufferer may last the doc
tor* will -not Â¦venture -any., predictions :Â¦ Or-
The mere fact of the consultation In
tself save rise to the gloomiest forebod
ingB. Indeed this was the first actual
consultation, as. the previous frequent
meetings of the doctors were not^SSE
ed as formal consultations. Yestcrdav
however. Dr. Rossoni, the distinguished
specialist of the bacilli school. waTcaE
in a consultalion lasting two hours dtir
ing which every phase of the patient's
case was minutely gone over. The con
elusions announced in the 7:30 o'clock bul"
letin showed that liquid is again Ea th"
ering in the pleural caVIty and that the
Pope's general condition is very grave.
EXPECT GBABUAL SINKINg!
The earlier, hopes had been insDired
largely by the Pontiffs outward evidence
of vigor, as he was able to rise, walk and
command all his faculties, but the later
consultation disclosed that these seem
Ing evidences of strength were entirely
deceptive, as the real danger consisted in
the gradual internal progrees of the in"
eidious diseases. â¢ Â¦
The condition of the Pope at times yes
terday morning seemed so favorable that
the hopeful Dr. Mazzoni and the more
Â«onservative Lapponi united in express
.ng the belief that there was some slight
prospect of recovery, but in a few hours
these brighter prospects disappeared be
fore the most alarming conclusions
reached after a lengthy consultation of
the doctors.
Dr. Mazzoni ended by ridiculing the
criticisms, objections and advice, which,
he said, persons, most of whom were fam
ous only for never being heard of, al
lowed themselves to proffer, even from
abroad, many of these persons having
seen the Pope only In photographs.
"The greatest accusation is that pleurisy
was not discovered in time," he said. "I
visited the Pope for the first time on
Sunday. On Monday evening I discovered
the fluid and on Tuesday removed It. Any
student of medicine knows." continued
Dr. Mazzoni, "that sometimes weeks pass
before the presence of serum is detected.
I myself once had pleurisy, which the
doctor did not discover until fifteen days
after I was taken 111."
FALSE SIGNS OF STRENGTH.
In reply to a question. Dr. Mazzoni said:
"I really cannot say whether the serum
in the oleural cavity has increased since
the consultation last evening, as I did not
examine his Holiness for such a purpose.
It must be undertsood that the Pope Is
too fra.il to be handled like other people.
Besides his thorax, through old age, has
become bent In such a way that the right
Fide, where pneumonia was first detected,
curves out in a very pronounced manner,
while the left eide curves in. In to-mor
row's visit attention will be especially
centered on the progress in the secretion
of serum. Then a decision will be taken
as to whether a new operation is neces
sary."
No right bulletin was issued, but at 1:25
o'clock this morning it was learned from
Dr. Mazzoni that the condition of the Pon
tiff had not changed since the issue of
the evening bulletin at 7:30 o'clock, which
announced that the patient's state was
grave, and at which hour Dr. Lapponi
had declared his fear that there, was no
hope, but that the end might not come
during this night. At midnight a report*
coming from the Vatican, gained currency
that Dr. Mazzoni had again operated upon
the Pope and extracted serum which had
again gathered in the pleural . cavity.
The representative of the Associated
Press immediately went to the Illustrious
surgeon and found him at his home at
1:30 o'clock this morning. Although ex
tremely tired. Dr. Mazzoni allowed him
self to be interviewed and said:
"It is untrue that a new operation has
been performed. I was with the Pope
from 11 o'clock until after midnight and
found his general condition stationary,
no change having taken place since the
afternoon, when the consultation with
Dr. Rossoni was held. To strengthen the
patient's heart and help the circulation
of the blood I injected camphor and caf
feine, after which the Pope, who seemed
somewhat relieved, said he remembered
having been treated with Raspiel water
on a camphor basis when he was nuncio
at Brussels sixty years ago."
HABASSED BY KNOW-ALLS.
Life Cannot
Be Prolonged
Much Longer
*y^OME, July 10, 2 a. m.â Another day
mJ of alternate hopes and fears has
V. passed and Pope Leo's life still
hangs in the balance. Beginning with re
newed hopes, yesterday closed with the
scale tending slowly but surely down
ward. How long this agonizing period of
suspense will last not even the attending
doctors care to say.
Â«T^3ME. July 9.â I ha>e just Inter-
B^m viewed Dr. Rnsponl regarding the
iT^r critical condition of the Fope,
â¢ â¢Â¦ whom he examined to-day. He
said:
"The terrible impression the Pope's
condition made upon me was, perhaps,
rfue to the fact that this was my first
visit to his Holiness. I bolieve.it is not
possible to retain any hope Whatever,
though he may live a few hours, or even
"As to the crisis which occurred this
afternoon. 1 do not, like Professor Maz
zoni. believe that it was due to the ex
ertion made by the Pope in the morn
ing, when he insisted on talking almost
incessantly. 1 believe, on the other hand,
that it is due to the malady Itself.
"This, in my opinion, is exudatory
pleurisy, and in this complaint effusion
always recur*. Another . operation will
he undertaken, perhaps to-morrow, to
draw off the liquid which has again col
lected, but it will be performed with a
view of merely prolonging the Pope's
life for a day or two and without any
hope of the patient's! recovery- However,
it cannot yet be said whether the opera
tion will take place, for the Pope's weak
ness may be so great as to render it in
advisable."

OME. July 9^â The news of the
g\ sudden relapse of the Pope, the
/w*^ consultation of physicians and
&\ the alarming bulletin which fol-
lowed w^cre unexpected thunder
bolts in what had already become in the
public feeling an unclouded sky. Tc-nlght
the idea prevailed that this brought to a
definite end all of the bright hopes which
were cherished this morning.
Professor Rossoni went through the most
careful examination of the Illustrious pa
tient, employing again what is known as
the bacilli system. The consultation last
ed more than two hours. The patient, as
one feature of the Investigation, was
made to pronounce the Italian word
"trentatre," which in a case where there
Is Indicated the presence of a badly act
ing heart and scrum In the pleura to any
one listening at the patient's side pre
sents a sound as if the consonants in the
word "thirty-three" had been dropped.
The experiment unfortunately proved not
only the presence of a fluid in the pleura,
but Its rapid augmentation, so that it al
ready a filleted the patient with the same
disturbances that were observed on last
Tuesday. Necessity for another opera
tion is indicated.
A state of great prostration has en
sued, rendering worse the affection of the
kidneys. It is likely that an injection of
salt water into the veins will be resorted
to. The diarrhoea, which appeared this
afternoon and occasioned the consulta
tion, ceased to-night.
That the Pope fully realizes that his
end cannot long be deferred is shown by
thÂ« attention he has given during the last
few days to the details of his final rest
ing place. It is well known that he has
discussed his testamentary dispositions
and* expressed his wishes as to the place
and manner of his funeral. Shortly be
fore he was taken ill the Pontiff repeated
'to Cardinal Satolli his desire td be burled
in the Church of St. John Lateran. The
spot he selected is on the left of the apse
above the entrance to the sacristy, cor
responding to the opposite niche in which
Is the monument erected by himself In
1S91 to Pope Innocent III. It is said that
a statue of Pope Leo, forming part of the
monument, has already been made, in
other respects the tomb will resemble
that of Innocent III, consisting of a sarco
phagus with a bas relief, two niches, two
statues and two medallions.
If there are real martyrs at the Vatican
they are Professors Lapponi and Mazzo
ni, who are inundated with letters and
telegrams from the four quarters of tha
earth imploring them to save their Illus
trious patient, who Is so necessary to the
church and the world. Unknown names
rub elbows with those of worldwide cel
ebrities, some of the senders . asking fur
telegraphic news two or three times a
day. A private secretary and a large for
tune would be required to answer them
all, which the eminent professors certain
ly have no intention of doing.
It does not even end there, for admirers
and worshipers of Pope Leo are sending
infallible remedies which they say if only
employed are sure to save the Pontiff' a
life. An American has sent wLu: he de
scribes as an extraordinary nutritive
liquid which would restore the dying to
health. A South American has sent a
hemorrholdal unguent in a very rich
flask. Besides these there are prescrip
tions from druggists and offers already
to embalm the Pontiff. Others offer to
make a death mask; some want to paint
a picture of Pope Leo and one writer
even offers to Impart the secret of petri
fying the body Into an everlasting status
to be offered to the Pope's nephews.
A new phase of the historic strife be
tween the noble families of Colonna and
Orsini has been developed by the Illness
of the Pope. Hoping to reconcile this an
cient family's hostility, it has been the
practice to designate the^ head of each
house as a prince assistant to tho Pon
tifical throne, these two positions being
the highest lay honors In the SEt of tho
Pope. In the case of the coronation of a
new Pontiff the two princes stand on
either side of his Holiness.
The head of the Colonna family, Don
Marco Antonio Colonna, was among: the
visitors at the Vatican to-day, but the
Orsini family is temporarily unrepresent
ed In this high dignity. Don Filippo Or
sini having resigned in favor of his son.
Don Domenico; Prince > of Solefra, and" the
latter's nomination not- having yet been
confirmed by Pope Leo." The Orsinis are
thus without representation and this cir
cumstance constitutes an Interesting his
torical curiosity.
A deputation arrived at the Vatican to
day from Carpineto. the birthplace of
Pope Leo, the news of the Pontiffs

those' around him and sent -Instead his

; The . Neapolitans are showing great
emotion over the approaching end of Pope
Leo, praying In the churches and doing
all that religion prescribes in appealing
to the Almighty to delay the catastrophe.
Cardinal Prlsco telegraphs that recourse
has been had even to the extreme -meas
ure of bringing out the blood- of "Saint
Gennaro. The blood of the saint is con
tained In a vial In a petrified form, which
turns into liquid and boils when the saint
condescends to Intervene. The miracle
is very dear to the heart of the Neapoli

The office of secretary of the
cohslstorlal congregation, to which Pope
Leo '] appointed the deceased prelate on
July 5â the last appointment made by his
Holinessâ must, be filled without delay, in
view of the possibility of a papal interreg

OME, July 9.â Pope Leo's condi-
M^B tion when he awoke this morn-
Jf^BT^ Ins seemed to be substantially un
â¢ changed. His Holiness was rest
less and impatiently awaited the
visit of the doctors. He asked Dr. Lap
poni: v;*0
"When wi'l Mazzoni. come?"
"Immediately," was' the reply, "if your
Holiness wishes.
"No," said the Pope; VI merely desired
to know the approaching time." .'?
Dr. Lapponi then informed his Holiness
that Dr. Mazzoni would be there about
8:30 o'clock.
Not since his illness did the'Pope begin
a day as satisfactorily as this morning.
Indeed hopes' of his- recovery /reached
such a point as to make the general pub
lic believe the Pontiff might soon be out
of danger. No ;â¢ better sny thesis of this
view could be given than., in. the v words
Dr. Lapponi uttered on leaving the sick
room at* about noon, that, although he
did not yet dare' to hope, he had perhaps
ceased to despair. This promising out
look, however, was followed by the start
ling announcement that the Pope had
been attacked with diarrhoea, apparently
caused by the large quantity of food he
had taken, and "that a consulting physi
cian had been sent for.
The patient, when he began the day,
showed only, more his iron mountaineer
fiber by rising and dressing almost with
out assistance, walking across- the room
to his armchair and having his toilet fully
prepared, even to the detail of J : being
shaved. Throughout this, procedure the
Pope showed no sign of being exhausted.
Indeed he jokingly alluded to the amount
of nourishment which, was being imposed
upon him, and said:
"I ougnt to grow fat, as I have never

the Cardinal. '-'I have been advised to

When the illness of the holy father took
a serious turn a few days ago he re

gesting that it woul<5 be advisable for the
Cardinal to : come o\v.
Orders have been given that the belld
of the Vatican and St. Peter's shall not
be tolledfor the death of Monsignor Vol
pint since it would disclose the death to
his Holiness. l
Besides the inquiries from all the reign
ing sovereigns, there were received at the
Vatican to-day sympathetic messages
from, the Count of Flanders, the Duke
and Duchess Paul of Mecklenburg-Schwe
rln, the Infanta Isabella. Count Caserta
(pretender to the kingdom of the two
Sicilies), Grand Duke- Serge of Russia
and Princess Mathilda of : Saxe-Coburs
and Gotha. Prince Albert of Belgium
not only inquired through the legation
but went personally, to the papal nuncio
at Brussels to give expression to his
grief. The Vatican was advised also that
the President of Argentina had visited
the papal inter-nuncio to demonstrate the
Interest taken by him, both as an Individ
ual and as an official. '
The Pontiff having expressed a desire
to see. the newspapers, and Dr. Lapponi
wishing to prevent him reading any of
the alarming news which has appeared
even in the clerical journals, had a spe
cial edition of the Voce. Delia Verlta (the
Voice of Truth), the Vatican paper, print
ed for the Pope, who was delighted In
hearing it read to him. Confidence in tho
steady amelioration In the Pope's condi
tion, however, is so rooted in his Immedi

were few persons present in the ante
chamber when the% medical bulletin was

said in part:
"Before he dies I wish to see the world
at peace. God bless him. Do not give
him up. The world needs him."
The Pontiff was much gratified. Said
he: ..
ended; but he came from the sick cham
ber long~~cnough to say a few words. The
doctor looked haggard and much depress
ed. The hopeful appearance which he had
shown 'early in the day had entirely dis
appeared. He said;
"I fear there is no hope, no hope what
ever, yet the enu may not come to-night.
Although the patient's condition is very
grave THe disease seems to be developed
through slow but certain processes."
Dr. ; Rossoni and Dr. Mazzoni left tfie
Vatican after the consultation,' but at 7
o'clock Dr. Mazzoni returned.
One of the most remarkable features in
the serious turn which affairs took was
that the Pope continued dressed and par
tially sitting up. His mind was perfectly
clear and "apparently the only cause of
alarm was that the doctors had detected
a renewal of the dangerous Internal com
plications.
The following bulletin was Issued at 9:30
o'clock:
, "The general condition of the illustrious
patient having become depressed, a con
sultation was held at 4 o'clock, with the
participation of Professor Rossoni. From
objective examination it appears that tho
liquid is again rapidly gathering In the
pleura." The sounds of the heart are weak,
without any symptoms of -valvular lesion.
The pulse' is easily compressible and It
has ninety pulsations instead of sixty
nine, which is normal. The breathing Is
superficial and at long Intervals^ The
kidneys are not performing thÂ«ir func
tions. The state of his Holiness is con
sidered grave.
"ROSSONI,

POPE LOVES AMERICANS.
â¢ As the Pope is much touched by the
evidences of .sympathy coming to him
from all parts of .the world, Dr. Lapponi
to-day, showed him some of the* telegrams
which had reached him as the Pope's phy
sician, including the following message

now."
STILL KEEN OF INTELLECT.
This buoyancy of spirit "was considered
to be one of the principal co-efficients in
the struggle with death which this ad
mirable old man has made in the last
seven days. The doctors, previous to the
alarming attack of this afternoon, said
there was not the slightest diminution in
the acuteness of the Pontiff's mental fac
ulties, as shown this morning -in a re
markable manner, when the Pope insist
ed upon going 'over some of the large
questions of church policy laid before
him by Cardinal Rampolla, the papal sec
retary of state.
' The Pope on learning .that Cardinal
Rampolla desired to see ; him received the
Cardinal at. 10 o'clock this morning. The
Pontiff said he had seen with great pleas
ure how the Sacred College was inter
ested in hjs person and he was equally
gratified at the manifestations' from the
good people of Rome. .
After this - his Holiness . spontaneously
asked Cardinal Rampolla whether there
were any urgent affairs to deal with, and
the Cardinal made a short summary of
the principal pending questions. The Pope
interested himself in all of them and. the
conversation i turning again to the Pon
tiff's condition 5 he said:
"Weakness has always been my great
est preoccupation.''
Dr. Lapponi, on leaving, the Pope's bed
room at 1 o'clock thls-afternoon, said:
"I cannot yet say that I hope, but I no
longer despair."
At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, al
though no wo r^e. the Pope was not re
ported to ' be any better and then came
the news of the Pontiffs sudden ..relapse
and of the sending for 'a consulting phy
sician.

WASHINGTON. July 9.â Secretary Hay
to-dajj communicated to the Jewish lead
ers the President's desire that they snould
call at' Oyster, Bay next Tuesday to con
sult- respecting' the disposition to be made
of the Jewish petition to Russia. The
Secretary took occasion to emphasize the
President's desire that there should be
no further delay in the submission of the
petition; that it must be ready next week.
It Is probable the course to be pursued
will consist in the dispatch of cablegrams
to Mr. Riddle, United States Charge at
St. Petersburg, directing him to inquire
of the Russian Government whether It is
â¢willing to receive a petition, the nature of
which wlll.be briefly outlined by Riddle,
and further proceedings will be governed
by the Russian answer.
The President is being deluged with
singly signed petitions on behalf of the
Russian Jews and these are forwarded
from Oyster Bay by every mail. The peti
tions are identical and as they are di
rected to the President alone, no ques
tion of tranmisslon to Russia is Involved,
and they are being filed at the State De
partment.

Petition, to Russia.

TO SUBMIT THEIR PLAN'S
BERLIN. July 9.â The German meat
law. which went into effect in April, is
having more serious consequences, com
mercially, than anticipated. As the reg
ulations require the inspection of meats
and lard to take place in bonded ware
houses before export, and the inspection
fees are heavy, the German merchants
complain that they are placed at a great
disadvantage In transit trade. They had
hitherto supplied Austria and Switzer
land with American meats and lard, send
ing directly from the warehouses without
expense. Since the meat law has been ap
plied, however, the Belgian and Dutch
shippers are getting all the Austrian and
Swiss trade and Germany is losing the
transit profits. The German shippers
therefore are calling loudly for the aboli
tion of the inspection requirements in the
case of export goods.
Inspection of Goods in Bonded Ware-
Houses Places Them at a
Great Disadvantage.
GEKMAN" MERCHANTS FEEL
EFFECTS OF THE MEAT LAW
The total loss will be in the neighbor
hood of $20,000, about equally divided be
tween the cargo arrd the vessel.
The vessel was on her.way from San
Juan Island to Seattle with 1S00 barrels
of lime and 129 barrels of salt salmon
in the cargo. Early this morning in De
ception Pass she sprang a leak, and as
soon as the water struck the lime the
fire began. Captain Ire Myers immedi
ately headed the Laconner for the beach,
which, she reached in time to allow the
officers and members of the crew to get
safely ashore.
ANACORTES. Wash.. July 9.â With a
cargo of lime burning in her hold, and
officers and crew In extreme peril, the
Sound steamer. Laconner steamed swiftly
to the beach tarly this morning and was
destroyed by the flames soon after all
the persons aboard abandoned her.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
In the discussion which followed Pro
fe?sor Orth, the late Professor Virchow's
successor, strongly combated the view
that human and animal consumption were
dissimilar and non-transferable.
"The series of experiments strengthens
Professor Koch's view that animal con
sumption as the cause of human con
sumption does not play the role generally
attributed to it. but delinitive judgment
requires further experimentation." Â¦
The commission decided to attempt the
inoculation of calves, not with matter
taken directly from human victims, but
with cultures made therefrom. The ex
perimentation covered thirty-nine separate
cultures, twenty-three from adults and
sixteen from children. The results were
that nineteen calves subcutaneously
treated, did not show the slightest effect;
nine showed after four months the slight
est changes of condition, and seven
showed more marked symptoms, but the
propagation of tuberculosis In the body
did not occur. On the other hand four
inoculations from tuberculosis children
infected calves with a disease which re
sembled a weak type of animal consump
tion and two of this number died from
tuberculosis.
The commission summarizes as follows:
BERLIN, July 9.â The Berlin Medical
Society yesterday evening assembled to
hear Professor Kossel of the "imperial
Health Office report the results of the
prolonged experiments of the tuberculosis
commission In Infecting calves with hu
man tuberculosis. Professor Koch's ob
servations, prior to the celebrated Lon
don address, caused the Health Office to
appoint the commission to make sys
tematic experiments. Yesterday's paper
was In the nature of a preliminary report.
The commission investigations cover three
forms of introducing tubercle bacilli In
calvesâ first, subcutaneous injection; sec
ond, in food, and third, by inhalation.
The preliminary report covers only/ the
first form, but the experiments with the
other fcrms continue. Â¦' - .-

SOME interesting statistics have been compiled
by Jhe Boston Globe concerning the extent of
trade carried on in the ten largest cities of the
United States by persons who do business on the
street* and thus save the cost of renting a shop or an
office. The calculation is that in the ten leading cities
of the country the amount of capital invested in such
business enterprises aggregates upward of $10,000,
000 and gives employment to more tha$ 100,000 per
sons.
In this, as in all other kinds of business, New York
holds the foremost place. In that city there are
found to be 32,851 persons engaged in' that kind of
trade, and, though they have more than $3,000,000 of
invested capital, they pay no rent. Chicago is cred
ited with 20,000 such traders, with a capital of $2,000,
000. Philadelphia has about 15,000 street merchants,
having a capital about the same as that of Chicago.
St. Louis, Boston and Baltimore are estimated to
have each about 5000 street traders, with a capital of
$500,000; while Cleveland, Cincinnati, San Francisco

In nearly every one of the cities named the laws
prescribe that a' man cannot establish a business on
a street corner unless he have a wagon, horse and
harness. It is estimated that these represent a value
of at least $3,000,000. Flower, fruit and boot

In the latest development of the oriental situation
even China must be able to see the sardonic humor
of the predatory nations. Japan has commanded Pe
king not to yield to Russian demands. If the Chinese
obey Japan they will offend Russia. If they submit
to Russia they will have Japanese wrath about their
ears. And if they d6 nothing they will antagonize
both. To say that China is on the horns of a
dilemma is only to express mildly the condition of
affairs.

IT is interesting to read that Wisconsin has just
authorized the creation of a Commission of
Forestry to take charge of the problem of re
foresting the State.
Primitively Wisconsin was clothed with fine for
ests. The white pine belt which covered both the
peninsulas of Michigan crossed Wisconsin into Min
nesota, arrd was originally the greatest forest of
conifers on that side of the continent. Men who saw
it before ax, saw and fire had marred it thought
that it was inexhaustible and indestructible. Through
it ran growths of white, red, black and burr oak,
and hard and soft maple and other timber that was
sheltered by the prevalent pine. But where is that
forest now? It is gone as completely as if shaved off
the earth's face by a glacial razor.
The northern peninsula of Michigan, once so
charmingly sylvan, is now a cold desert. The pine
forest grew in a layer of soil over sand. The fires
have burned this soil away and left the sand, in
which nothing grows. In Wisconsin white pine, all
the oak, maple and ash are gone.
In the sumptuous days of the rich pine forests the
lumber-jacks looked with contempt on the linn, lin
den or basswood, which grew there in great abun
dance. It was a soft wood with a mucilaginous cam
bium and bark, and bore a lovely flower, but was
"no good" 'in the eye of the forest assassin. But
now the. Wisconsin lumberman has turned his atten
tion to the despised basswood, and, sawed into sid
ing, rustic and other merchantable lumber, it has fol
lowed the nobler families of the forest to market,
and often even the basswood is gone.
. Wisconsin has waked up and appointed a Commis
sion of Forestry!
We are sleeping in California while our forests are
being destroyed. The end will come quicker than it
did in Wisconsin, and the results will be more dis
astrous because of the aridity of our climate. But
to talk about it seems to be .useless. The peop\ are
indifferent, the Legislature more so, and the tree,
"the mother of the fountain," is dying in the fire
while the ungrateful who drink of the living water she
has preserved for them look on and offer no preven
tion of the martyrdom.
Wisconsin took millions out of her forests, but to
repair the damage wrought by their destruction will
cost her two dollars for every one she made.

PERSOiNAL MENTION.
MORE than a week has gone by since the
Iowa Democratic Convention knocked Bry
anism down and dragged it out, with every
evidence of liking the job, and Mr. Bryan has not
been heard from. The strongest Bryan paper in the
State, the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, which read
anti-Bryan Democrats out of the party until that
old Democratic Gibraltar went Republican, incoher
ently and with some he-hysterics, and an air of
"PleasT forget." accepts the discovery that its idol
has clay feet, and, after a brief lamentation, falls in.
Where is "the voice" that used to make the
Platte tremble' The party has had a long attack of
aberration of mind. Mr. Bryan was the aberration. .
Many will recall a? a more than occasional ex
perience a man suffering from some brain trouble
who is sent to the asylum where he "sees things."
He fancies he is a locomotive and can be stopped
only by a red light: or he is Moses leading Israel
through the wilderness. Such afflicted persons have
been known to think they were women, and their
fantastic illusions have carried them through mater
nal duties. E\erybody sympathizes with such a man
when he comes back "cured," but still -everybody
:s afraid he will "get 'em again."
The Democratic party began to see things ten
years age and got worse until in 1896 it took Bryan
for a statesman, and 16 to 1 as the divine ratio, and
went stick, stark, staring mad. It may be getting
better of this affliction, of which everybody is glad,
but everybody is afraid it will "get 'em again."
The party has a singular history of failure to see
clearly in great crises. In the last half century the
country has passed . through two capital crises.
Prior to the Civil War the Democratic party had
practically shaped the policy of the republic since
1801. Its rule was interrupted during all that time
only by the election of Adams in 1824, of Harrison in
1840 and Taylor in 1848. The party made a credit
able financial reco r d, thanks to Jackson, and in the
main abided by its straight-laced notions of consti
tutional construction and its laissez faire idea of
government. But when the great crisis of 1861 came,
and men had to elect to support or oppose the Union,
the Democratic party had an attack. of aberration of
mind and went wrong. It saw visions in which
Lincoln \vaj> a Xero, Grant a Caesar; but Jeff Davis
was Washington, and Lee a mixture of Israel Put
nam, Horatio Gates and Anthony Wayne.
The party refused to follow its national leaders
then and march behind Douglass to the music of
the Union, but instead it put on butternut clothes,
wore the heid of Liberty cut out of an old copper
cent for jewelry, and got drunk when the Confed
erates had a victory. In its conventions it
'amented the coercion of States, the death and
burial of liberty, and in every possible way made a
I00I of itself. In spite of it the Union was saved,
but its hallucinations continued until Vallandigham
himself, in the convention at Dayton, Ohio, took a
new departure, acknowledged the restoration of the
Union and the constitutionality of the constitution,
and the party began to emerge from its fantastics.
In short, it got back from the asylum, and while the
neighbor? did not like to remind it that it had been
crazy, they did not care to do business with it for
irar that it might "get 'cm again."
The Dayton platform was adopted in 1866, but the
country required eighteen years after that to get
confidence enough in the soundness of Democracy's
mind to intrust it with the Presidency. Mr. Cleve
land, in whom the people had confidence, looked the
cra?y thing over and declared he could keep it
from hurtinjr itself or the country. He undertook
the job, and in the second great crisis, when the pub
lic credit ebbed, the treasury was near bankruptcy,
the Government was about to become insolvent and
ruin could be averted only* by sound financiering, the
old thing went crazy again, ran away from Cleveland
and whooped and hollered up and down the road un
til it Â£ot everybody scared.
Yet Mr. Cle\'cland only wanted to enforce the
ideas of Jefferson and Jackson as to the standard of
value. His ideas and plans were exactly and se
verely Democratic, but the mad party knew not the
jound of its own voice.
N'ow it has got back to where it was when the
Dayton platform was adopted. It is back from an
other turn in the asylum. The folks are gUd to see
it home again and hope it is well, but really they feel
â¢tiioicious and don't want to do business with it
WHERE IS THE VOICE?
The President, in replying to the ad
dress, said the visit to London had given
him the opportunity of discovering once
more that greater justice was done to
France abroad than she did to herself at
home. The impression which he had
brought back was profoundly satisfactory
and he felt patriotic joy in proclaiming
it aloud. M. Loubet concluded with ex
pressing the hope that peaceful accord
would gradually supersede conflicts, to
the great benefit of France and to hu
manity.
CALAIS. France, July 9.â President
Loubet met with a great reception here
to-day on his return to French soil from
big crowds of people. At the public re
ception which followed the President's ar
rival here the speakers congratulated M.
Loubet on trje happy results of his visit
to England.
PLEASED WITH HIS VISIT.
DRUIDICAL REMAINSâ J. P.. City. A
number of Druldical remains exist In
England and in Northern France. One
of these is in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and is
believed to be the ruins of a very largo
temple. On an open plain there are 650
large blocks of stone. One hundred are
set on end around a large area,
inclosed by a dep mound. The
area within is twenty-eight acres
In extent. It is supposed from appear
ance of the stones that within this large
circle there were two smaller circular
temples. These ruins have existed in
their present condition from the earliest
records of English history. There are
also Druidlc ruins at Carnac. in Brit
tany, Mount St. Michel. France, and
Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain, England.
CHATTEL, MORTGAGEâ A. M., Angela.
Cal. A chattel mortgage is the most com
mon form of collateral security. It is an
Instrument In the nature of a pledge and
conditional sale, to become absolute and
vest the title to the thing mortgaged,
without redemption, upon a breach of any
of its conditions. The chattels must have
an existence at the time the mortgage is
executed and must be correctly and truly
described. Subsequently acquired prop
erty will not be affected by It, and neither
of the parties will have any power to sub
stitute other property for that which was
.originally covered by the mortgage. The
mortgage must be given to secure a cer
tain indebtedness therein explained and
cannot be extended so as to become a
lien for the amount of another and differ
ent Indebtedness.
SALES BY SAMPLESâ A. M.. Angels,
Cal. The general rule of sale by samples
is that there has been an implied if not
a direct understanding that the good.* to
be delivered shall be of the same kind an<i
quality as the sample. The purchaser, if
the goods do not prove equal to the sam
ple, may return them, or may keep them
and recover the difference In value. TLe
purchaser Is entitled to a reasonable tlma
to examine the goods after delivery and
the right to use so much as may be act
ually necessary to ascertain If they con
form to the samx>Ie.
CATARRHâ Dally Reader. Salinas, Cal.
Catarrh, according to medical books, is
curable if treated at the inception of the
trouble, but when it is allowed to run, and
becomes chronic, the chances are against
a permanent cure. A newspaper cannot
suggest any remedy, as each case depends
upon the condition of the Individual suf
ferer.
OF the irrepressible war between Chicago and
St. Louis the country has heard much, and
long since learned to care little. There has
grown up in the public mind a conviction that the
controversy will never amount to more than, a blow
ing of horns and a beating of tom-toms. From that
serene state the American people must now be
aroused. The warring parties are indeed not yet
ready to engage in actual fight, but they are seek
ing to bring other cities into line on one side or the
other, with the .evident intention to so. arrange mat
ters that when the struggle breaks out in arms the
whole United States will be involved in civil war.
The facts are these: For some time past there has
been more or less typhoid in St. Louis, and the au
thorities of the city have contended that the evil is
due solely to the dumping of Chicago water into the
Mississippi River through the medium of the fa
mous drainage canal. For the purpose of prevent
ing Chicago from using the canal for sewer purposes
a suit has been brought in the proper courts and is
now "being heard. St." Louis has presented an awful
array of evidence concerning the impurities poured
forth into the Mississippi by the canal, and she has
also presented evidence of the existence of typhoid
within her confines ever since the canal water began
to mingle with the water of the big river.
Such a showing was something of a shock to Chi
cago, and she set about rebutting it. A New Eng
land scientist, name not given in the reports, was
called in to knock the St. Louis case silly, and he has
done so.. Incidentally he has alsp bowled over
Baltimore, and now there is a roar from the shores of
the Chesapeake. It appears that the unnamed
scientist from New England went on the stand and
testified that the typhoid in St. Louis was caused not
by the Chicago drainage, but by germs imported in
Baltimore oysters. He added that these germs, once
located upon lips by the process of eating oysters,
would be diffused through the city by the process
of kissing. . It will be readily understood that such
ja. statement set up as a defense for Chicago has been
highly .exasperating to Baltimore, where oysters and
kisses have been regarded as genuine luxuries well
suited to one another and absolutely harmless, no
matter how mixed or mingled.
Baltimore is very rightly protesting against the
effort of Chicago to defend a drainage canal by set
ting up the declaration that the waters are better and
safer than oysters and kisses. The whole people of
the United States will sympathize with Baltimore in
her efforts to refute the slander. Chicago has, in
fact, gone too far. She may if she will teach her
own youth that sausages and a handshake in Chicago
are better than oysters and kisses in St. Louis,. but
she should hot go so far as to put up a scientist to
swear on the stand that the generality of oysters and
kisses are more pestilential than drainage water.

King Edward's reply was as follows:
LONDON. July 9. â President Loubet. Calais.
France: The kind words of your telegram
touched me greatly. We are all delighted that
your visit pleased you. It is my most ardent
desire that the rapprochement of our two coun.
tries should be. lasting. EDWARD R. I.
Upon his arrival at Dover M. Loubet
embarked on the French cruiser Gulchen
and the vessel sailed at once to Calais,
escorted by a British torpedo flotilla and
followed by farewell salutes from the
fleet and castle. Before his departure
from Dover President Loubet telegraphed
to King Edward, thanking him for his
hearty reception. The text of M. Loubefs
telegram to the King is as follows:
LONDON. July 9.â Despite the earliness
of his departure, the route from St. James
place to the railroad station was crowded
and British "hurrahs" and French shouts
of "Vive Loubet" re-echoed throughout
the streets. When President Loubet en
tered the station he was met by the King
and the Prince of Wales, the Duke of
Connaught, Premier Balfour, other Min
isters, members of the French embassy
and a crowd of military and other of
ficials.
As M. Loubefs carriage drew up King
Edward advanced with outstretched hand
and, taking the President familiarly by
the arm, led him through the waiting
room to the royal car. For a few min
utes the King and President stood talk
ing with much animation. King EdwaJ-d
grasped M. Loubefs right hand and
shook it with extreme cordiality, while
with the left he patted the President on
the shoulder. Official as well as amateur
artists could be seen in all directions se
curing snapshots of the striking scene.
After renewed handshaking his Maj
esty showed" the President into the royal
car and stood chatting with him until the
train pulled out amid cheers and shouts
of "Vive Loubet," mingled with the
strains of the "Marseillaise." President
Loubet stood at a window of the car
waving his handkerchief in his gloved
hand until the royal special disappeared
from view.

Whether the schools and the universities can do
anything to rouse that class of citizens may be doubt
ful, but it will be well for them to try. Under our
governmental system civic virtue is of such impor
tance that we can well afford to resort to every
means to inculcate it. There can be no genuinely
gocd government where intelligent and loyal citi
zens arc indifferent to political duties, and that truth
can never be too often preached nor too thoroughly
taught.
QUITE a notable portion of the discussions at
the various educational meetings of the year
has been devoted to consideration of the
very tvident need of a better type of citizenship than
that which prevails among us. It has been sug
gested that the universities can do much to instill
a larger amount of civic virtue among its graduates,
and that the public schools can be made a means of
diffusing a similar sentiment among the general
masses of the people. There appears to have been
nowhere any dispute at all as to the. need of some
such training. In that respect educators agree that
the education they have been providing falls short of
the needs of the country and the time.
The issue of course is not a new one. The com
plaint now being made by the professors and the
teachers at their conferences has been made often
enough before by the press, by statesmen and by
preachers. The only new feature added by the edu
cational conferences is the suggestion that school
and college training can be made serviceable in pro
moting the desired increase of civic patriotism and
political interest among all classes of citizens.
One of the best addresses on the subject was that
made at the recent conference of the State Educa
tional Association of Pennsylvania by Professor Ed
munds of the Central High School of Philadelphia.
He began by saying: "The characteristics of the
ideal citizen may be classified as three â interest, in
telligence and loyalty. Any two of these without the
other will produce an unbalanced citizen, whose
very strength along one or another line may
be a source of danger to the community. It is the
combination of interest and intelligence without loy
alty that gives us the 'grafter,' or corruptionist,
whose masterly skill in'the lobbying of vicious legis
lation is the amazement and despair of our time. It
is the union of interest and loyalty without intelli
gence that gives us the mob, whose reason is over
swayed by the passionate appeal of the demagogue
into acts of violence and lawlessness. The citizen
who combines loyalty and intelligence without inter
est is a frequent type in our cultured classes, and
his lassitude and indifference to political and social
evils is a serious menace to the safety of the state."
It is the citizen of the third of Professor Ed
munds' classification whose problem is of most in
terest. The grafters will have to be dealt with by
law rather than by education. The mob very rarely
affects American politics. The citizen of intelligence
and of loyalty, who lacks interest in public affairs, is
the man upon whose shoulders rests most of the
blame for bad government in State and municipal
politics. He could save the situation if he would.
The problem is to determine how to get him to
do it.
Argument, exhortation and even invective have
been tried time and again to rouse the typical "good
citizen" to a sense of his duty in political affairs, but
nearly always with but little success. Sometimes a
spirit of reform stirs a community, and then we have
a fairly full vote, but ordinarily the vote is light and
the gangs of the bosses have little or no difficulty in
carrying a sufficient number of offices to give them
a virtual control of the municipality. Even when the
reform movement is successful it passes quickly and
makes no permanent impression upon the course of
political life, so that Professor Edmunds was right
in saying: "The American has not proven himself
capable as yet of an abiding and permanent devotion
to the daily business of the Government. Our ideals
are industrial and economic, rather than political, and
there is probably not one of us that would not read
an account of the personality of J. Pierpont Morgan
in preference to the work of the daily proceedings of
the municipal council."
We are soon to have a municipal election in San
Francisco, and we shall then have once more an op
portunity to put to the test of actual trial the virtue
of our intelligent and loyal citizens. It is a foregone
conclusion that a considerable number of them will
be found wanting in public interest. They will talk
of good government, they will sincerely desire to
have it provided, but they will not vote either at the
primaries or on election day. It appears that no
amount of argument can ever convince them of the
truth of the statement that their "lassitude and in
difference to political and social evils is a serious
menace to the safety of the state."
ELEMENTS OP CITIZENSHIP.
mcus, but of course there is no way of arriving at
an accurate estimate of the whole. In New York it
is calculated that the street trade of one kind and
another amounts to $2,000,000 annually.
From these small ventures there have emanated
some of the foremost merj of business of our time.
They get a start without paying rent, but once started
they find the street corner too 'small for their en
terprise, and ere long are doing a business that re
quires a whole building for their stock. The street
stand, in fact, does not look very big, but for the right
man "there's millions in it."

We will not concede that an employe has a
right to Inquire into the employer's books to
ascertain how much in the Judgment of the em.

company will not submit to a stand-up by
threats or otherwise on the theory that the
company is making or losing money, nor ad
mit that anything prior to Its acquisition can

Its investment. For the protection of itself
and all employers of labor, it definitely declines
to oiscuss with the f-mploj-fts its ability to pay

Secretary Willcutt refused to either
deny or affirm this statement, and then
Attorney Moore made the following ob
jection:
Argument between Attorneys Moore
and Livernash, representing the United
Railroads and the carmen's union, re
spectively, took up most of the session of
Commissioner Murasky's court yesterday.
The street car corporation still Ukes
the stand that the prosperity or depres
sion of traffic business has nothing to do
with the wage* of employes, and conse
quently none of its officials will testify
concerning nor are any books opened to
show the earnings of the company. TRIb
action on the yart of the United R&U
roads is looked upon by Livernaish ?.i un
fair. "You have no right," he argued,
"to close your books and seal the lips of
your officials." On the other hand. At
torney Moore contends thut if the arbi
trators wish or order the company to pro
duce its books It will consent to do so.
"But if they ehould ever make such an
order," s?a!u Moore, "rest assured there
will bo no more boards of arbitration.
No corporations are going to throw open
their books to their employes and allow
them to decide themselves whether they
are entitled to more money."
The" first witness called by Livernash
was Secretary Willcutt of the United
Railroads. Wtlleutt *UU refused to an
swer any questions where the value of
the company's property was involved.
This action on the part of Willcutt
aroused the ire of Llvernash, who made
the following statement:
My purpose In recalling Mr. Willcutt to the
witness xtanJ was to obUin from him evidence

H. J. Jardln, president of the Point Lo
bo" Improvement Club, urged that the
Residence dictrict. at Richmond was not
the place for the location of a brick-mak
ing concern. He said that the company
proposed to use crude petroleum and that
It would cause a nuisance. On behalf of
the members of the Point Lobos Improve
ment Club the president requested that
the permit asked for by the Golden Gate
Brick Company be denied.
Ex-County Clerk W. A. Deane also pro
tested against the contemplated location
of the plant and similar protest was made
by Charles Hubbs, president of the Rich
mond District Improvement Club.
Fred Dodd, manager of the Golden Gate
Brick Company, and W. Uridge, its pres
ident, explained that the plant would not
be a nuisance and that its process did
away with brick burning kilns.
The officials of the company presented
three citizens of the Richmond district,
who urged that the plant would be a ben
efit to the locality.
The members of the Committee on
Streets seemed inclined to heed the pro
tests of the citizens and refuse the permit
for the erection and maintenance of the
engines and oil tanks of the company, but
after listening to the company's attarney
the matter was laid over for one week to
afford the brick company an opportunity
to present petitions from residents that
favor the location of the plant, also to al
low the filing of further protests.
â¢Yesterday a protest was made by resi
dents of the Richmond district against
the Issuance of a permit to the Golden
Gate Brick Company to erect a brick
making plant in their midst.

Sometimes Help the Hair to Go.
In any changeable climate the hair Is
apt to become brittle and to break off
stubby here and there. This makes a
hair-dressing almost a necessity, espe-
cially to ladies. In using a hair dressing
why not get the best, one that combines
with It the efficiency in killing the dan-
druff germ, the germ that eats the hair
oft* at the roots, causing what is called
falling hair, and in time baldness. New-
bro's "Herplcide" is that kind of a hair
dressing. You have noddea how delight-
ful your scalp will feel, and how stylish
your hair, will appear, after an applica-
tion or two of Herplcide. It is certainly
a wonderful Innovation as a scalp anti-
septic and hair-dressing. Sold, by leading
druggists. Send 10c in stamps : for saml

PORTLAND, Ore., July 0.â The Browns
won one of the most excltlns games from
Morley's Stars ever seen here. Up to the sev
enth It looked hopeless for the locals when
they went In and came within one of tying
the score. Doc Newton took the box In the
eighth. In the ninth Inning Shea reached first
on Spies' error, took second on Engie's single,
and scored when Ross dropped Vigneux's fly.
Engle <ame home on Van Buren's out to Spies,
winning the game. Umpire Levy had an un

the crowd, and for a while It looked as though
there might be a mlx-up'on the field. Score:
PAST FINISH AT PORTLAND.
Special interest was 'taken in the final
of "the Grand Challenge cup because of
Third Trinity's misfortune in losing the
services of H. D. Goldie, who was Indis
posed and who had as a substitute an un
trained man. But for .this Trinity would
have undoubtedly retained the trophy.' As
it was, the race was a great one. Leander
from the start tried cutting down tactics,
but Third Trinity held the lead until
Fawley 1 Court. ' Amid a roar of cheerinjr,
the two boats. passed the Grosvenor Club
lnelosure" rowiriff level, but a little later
Leander. struggled forward and after a
great tussle won. ., '
The race for." the ladies'^ challenge cup
was another stirring contest. Magdalene
led by a length .when a,' furlong from
hbntie ' Eton made a magnificent spurt
and placed the boats almost level. Eton
was unable; however, to sustain the ef
fort and was defeated by a length.
vThe other events did not furnish excit
ing finishes and no f great interest was
taken In them" with' 'the exception of the
finals 'for the diamond Sculls. Rowing
rrien were curious -to,.: see how Beresford,
the victor over Juvenal of the Vesper Boat
Club, Philadelphia, would acquit himself
against -the; holder, of the" trophy. For a

From the start the game was a nice one
to look uponâ full of fast fielding and
clever work on the bags by the Senators.
Both pitchers were working up to tne top
notch of their best form and therefore
hits did not come in abundance nor were
they bunched very often. It was either
team's game for a hit at any time and
the result was always doubtful.
Five fast double plays were pulled off
during the encounter and tncy tavtU.ad
many, run?. Three of these were made
by the Senators, while Uncle's crowd
were responsible for one less. McLaugh
lin and Doyle each threw runners out
from their positions in the outfield and
each time it appeared as though the run
ners could make the distance easily.
The home team got in its good work in
the fourth inning, when both runs were
scored. In that Inning Irwin walked, but
was forced at third at Leahy. Pabst came
through with a nice double-sac'cer into
the center garden, which bounded away
from Doyle, and Leahy came right ! on
till the plate was crossed.
Pabst was waiting on second for some
thing to turn up, when all of a sudden
Krug landed for a terrific wallop down
to Casey. The ball was breaking the
speed record for the distance and the sec
ond baseman did not have a chance to
intercept its course. While- it bounded to
the outfield Pabst came in with the last
run of the local team.
Ham Iberg had all the Senators on his
staff till the seventh Irinlng was at hand
and then they began to get a little jerry
to his offerings. Casey hit and stole the
second' bag. Sheehan's out put him on
third and then Graham hit a hot one
down to Charley Irwin. Irwin was in a
hurry to do something great and there
fore threw a trifle high to the plate and
this let Casey score and saved the Sena
tors from being handed* the package of
double play in the last half of
the ninth round at Recreation Park
yesterday. Mike at the time had
two of his shining lights, on the
bags and only one was down. The
score was 2 to 1 and It looked as though
a tie might be possible, but Hogan hit
into the double play and all was then
quiet.
MIKE FISHER was rudely awak
ened from his dreams about
pennants and renewals of con
tracts by a fast and furious

NEW YORK. July 9.â James R. Keene's
Rigodon and Walter B. Jennings* Proper
furnished the best contest of the after
noon at Brighton Beach to-day, where
some 8000 enthusiasts sweltered and en
deavored to forset the heat in the spir
ited struggles which prevailed during the
day. The race in question was the Sea
gate stakes, worth $3090 to the winner.
Proper was favorite on account of his
good second to Goldsmith, when he fin
ished in front of Lux Casta and Afri
cander at Sheepshead Bay on June SO.
The race narrowed down in the last
half mile to a rare struggle between Gan
non on Rigouon and Odora on Proper. The
Keene coit had saved ground by coming
through next to the rail and this told in
his favor at the end, for only by ex
traordinary hard work did Gannon get
the big brown colt a head in advance, of
Prcpor. Dr. Savior beat Fire Eater a
head for thiid place. Summary:

Special Dispatch to The Call,
Jimmy Britt is training at Croll's Gar
dens, Alameda. with Corbett. Jack
O'Keefe's interests are being looked after
by "Western Al" Smith. O'Keefe started
in training a few days ago. He is work
ing at Shee-han's roadhouse on the ocean
beach. Britt and O'Keefe will fight twen
ty rounds under the auspices of the Spn
Francisco Athletic Club on the 31st of this
month.
Corbftt and Delaney discussed other
matters. Delaney trained Corbett for all
his big lights until Jim suffered defeat at
the hands of Fitssimmons at Carson and
since then has looked after Jeffries.
Delaney and Corbott and James W.
Coffroth. representing the Yoserr.ite Ath
letic Club, under whose auspices the men
will fight, met at Harry Corbett"s saloon
last night and discussed the prices for the
big â¢â¢go." Tlio maximum price will be
O and the minimum S3 a ticket. ; '
Delaney said Jeffries went out on the
road for the first time last Wednesday.
He says Jeff is in good shape and weighs
pounds. He thinks the big fellow will
weigh "la pounds when he enters the
ring against Corbett. Corbett attended
the performance at Fischer's last even
ing. He is in splendid condition and as
confident as ever of victory.
No othÂ«>r nansrs wore brought up in the
discussion over the third man to be in the
ring on the evening of the contest.
Oraney was agreeable to Corbett and also
to Jeffries. Delaney was authorized to
fcgree to the "little horseshoer" and the
selection was made without debate.
Graney's selection will meet with the
approval cf ringgcors. as he has given
s=at!sfaction in the past. lie is con
scientious and knows every move in the
game. Grar.ey rcfereed the contest be
tween Jeffries and Fitzsiramor.s last July
and his activity :n the ring arid the ease
with which he made the big heavy
weights obey his inft ructions pleased
everybody. Granry refereed the Hanlon-
Corbett. Corbett-McGovern. Eritt-Fitz-
Kerald. Gans-Fitzgerald and other bat
tles. In his youth he was the best ama
teur boxer of The Olympic Club. He was
the trial horse for all the professional
lightweights who made their appearance
before the old California Athletic Club.
Eddie Grancy will referee the Corbett-
Jrffries championship battle, which will
be broufrht off in Mechanics' Pavilion on
August 14. Ho was selected last night by
Corbctt and "Billy" Delaney. trainer of
the boilor-makcr. The selection was rr.acle
while the pair were crossing the bay last
evening. Corbett was on his way to his
brothers saloon to meet Delaney, who.
journeyed all the way from Harbin
Springs to complete arrangements for the
bis battle.

CHICAGO, July 9.â The Conqueror II,
outsider in the betting at 30 and 40 to 1.
won the Midway stakes at Washington
Park to-day. The race was thought to
lie between Hargis and John McGurk, and
they were backed to the exclusion of
everything else.
Hargis jumped into the lead at the start
and maintained that position until round
ing the far turn, where he faltered, and
The Conqueror, coming from behind, won
as he pleased.
After the last race thirty of the book
makers were arrested for violating the
anti-betting law, but were released In a
few minutes on bonds which had been
previously prepared?
Following the raid on the betting ring
a fl^e, undoubtedly of incendiary origin,
was discovered in the grand stand. The
blaze was discovered just after the last
race. The stand was nearly empty, and
of" the thousands who saw the afternoon's
sport, few were aware of the attempt to
destroy the club's property. Quick work
by employes of the club saved the stand
and the damage done amounted*. to only a
few dollars.
A quantity of some inflammable fluid,
either alcohol or gasoline, had been
poured into the fire , buckets. The
contents of the buckets were thrown
on the blazs, causing it to spread in all
directions. A line of hose was quirkly
attached to the pipe3 connected with the
water tank on the roof of the stand and
the flames were soon extinguished. Sum

Tour Among: Points of
Interest. .
OAKLAND. July 9.â Thursday. Aneust
20, has been designated a3 "Oakland day"
in the official programme for the national
encampment of the Grand Army of the
Republic, which will take place- next
month in San Francisco. Mayor Warren
Olney, himself a veteran of the Civil
War, has enlisted a large number of citi
zens in a movement to arrange a fitting
entertainment for the visiting veterans
on that day. It la proposed to give an al
fresco luncheon on the shores of Lake
Merritt, with a tour of the gardens and
hills of Piedmont and a flying trip
through the orchards of Haywaxds and
that vicinity. The Grand Army -posts,
other veterans' organizations and the
Women's Auxiliary corps will keep open
house during the day.
The committee appointed by Mayor
Olney organized to-day at the Board of
Trade rooms by electing J. Â»W. Evans
chairman and Edwin Stearns secretary.
An executive committee of twelve mem
bers, including Mayor Olney and Chair
man Evans, will be named to attend to
the details of the reception. Mayor
Olney pointed out that In all probability
the veterans would never again meet in
California, and he believed it was the
duty of patriotic citizens to unite in ex
tending a welcome to the old soldiers
before "taps" have sounded for the last
time.

no law which compelled the Southern
Pacific Company to carry passengers
without charge In the city limits. He
explained that the Interests of the com
pany and the residents of Alameda were
mutual, but If the people of Alameda
could get along without the railroad, he
believed the company could manage to
get along without Alameda,
W. J. Shreve wanted the City Trustees
to cause the Southern Pacific Cdmpany
to restore the stations at Second avenue
and Webster street. J. A. Robertson
was opposed to granting the franchises
for more than one year.
Samuel Green was of the opinion that
the railroad company should pay the
cit^r $2000 a year for Its franchises and
carry local passengers free. G. M. Ful
ton was opposed to a long-term fran
chise, and said that the sentiment of the
majority of commuters was that the,
gates be retained on the local trains.
S. M. Haslett asserted that the ma
jority of the commuters favored the
gates, because they protected them from
deadhead overcrowding and also less
ened the possibility of accidents to chil
dren and others.
Attorney Frank Shea appeared as the
representative of the Southern Pacific
Company. There was a difference of
opinion among the citizen spekers as to
what the City Trustees should exact
from the Southern Pacific Company in
return for the franchise privileges,
R. A. Dagiie. on behalf of the Board of
Trade, said that body desired the gates
removed from the local trains and pas
sengers carried within the city limits
without charge, and that the franchises
be granted for not more than five years.
Dajrue asserted that the Park-street
merchants had suffered because of the
charging of fares on the local trains and
that the future of Alameda depended up
on the conditions under which the fran
chise would be granted.
ALAMEDA, July 9. â In response to
an invitation from the West End Im

Work has progressed so far on the
terminus of Santa Fe Railroad at
Emeryville that it is almost certain that
trains will^be running into Oakland by
August 1, and the new ferry will be in
operation by that time.
The depot at the end of the long pier
has been completed and the work of
painting the building and finishing off the
interior has begun. The long pier itself
is complete and rail laying has almost
been finished. A fÂ«w days more will com
plete this work. The subway under the
tracks of the Southern Pacific Company
has been finished and the concrete walls
and floors are in. The steel work for the
subway has arrived and is being put in
place, and a week or two will finish thia
branch of the work. A little trouble has
been experienced from water, and men
are kept pumping the subway out. . A
pump for this work is to be installed.
The track Tor the electric system from
San Pablo avenue to the pier is com
pleted and is being used by material cars.
The electric power station Is finished
and the machinery is being installed. An
auxiliary storage battery system is be
ing put in place. Enough electricity will
be stored to run the roads for from, six
to nine hours In case of a break in the
power lines of the Bay Counties Power
Company, which supplies the electricity
for the system.
The electric lines to Berkeley will be
finished within a week or two. The Santa
Fe is rushing work on the completion of
the connecting link between Oakland an*
Point Richmond. Gangs of men are work
ing from both ends and car loads of rails
are arriving daily at Emeryville for thia
work.
Work on the electric line across town
through Fortieth street is very much be
hind, owing to the lack of men.

Professor Frank Soule of the State Uni
versity stated in a court document to
day that he is no loneer able to pay
his former wife, Ella Bacon Soule, a
monthly stipend of $75, which he has paid
her under the court's orders since July,
1S96. He pleads poverty and the facfThat
his former wife has since inherited a
large amount of property and no longer
needs the money.
The college professor and Ella Bacon
Soule were divorced in 1S95- Â¦ Mrs. Soule
was eiven the and awarded the
custody of the* two children with ali
mony. Since their separation Soule has
married strain. He states that his sal
ary is $275 a month/and that he is in
debt about $5500 and unable to keep up
the payments on his home. His former
wife, he asserts, has fallen heir .to a
sixth Interest in her father's estate, which
was appraised at $880,000. and at the death
of her mother got another sixth, and that
she is now a wealthy woman in her own
right and preparing withi her sister . to
build an expensive home on property be
longing to them on Webster street.
For years Frank ,6oule has been suing
the Bacon estate for $10,000 left him in
the elder Bacon's will. By a misreading
of the figures Soule's legacy was read
$2000, instead of $10,000, and the mistake
was not discovered for some years. He
has since been awarded judgment for the
additional $8iwv, with interest, which now
brings the amount up to nearly $13,000.
His action brought to-day was in the
form of a notice to Ella Bacon Soule and
her attorneys that he would appear be
fore the court on July 17 and ask for a
modification of the divorce decree in re-'

There is a great deal of feeling in Rich

are growing, one favoring Pursell and the
other Thornton. There is an indication

BARKENTINE WHICH BEAT
THE ANNIE JOHNSON IN
RACE FROM HONOLULU.
Captain Nelson said "Ha, ha!"
Captain Schmidt said "Pooh, pooh!"
and added that the Johnson was not so
much.
The result was that when circumstances
so ordained it that both vessels could
leave Honolulu together it was decided to
make a race of it.
The Irmgard has won. but by what
margin x^ill not be known until the An
nie Johnson comes in.
The Irmgard brought up 15,507 bags of
sugar.
each other, it was announced
by cable from the islands that they would
race. to this port for a prize, which was
variously estimated at values running
from the price of a dinner to $500. The
Irmgard arrived yesterday, twenty-four
days from Honolulu, and somewhere out
on the Pacific Captain Xelson is crowd
ing sail on the Annie Johnson in a vain
effort to make good his Honolulu boast
The Irmgard is one of a number of
sailing packets rated for speedy travel
ing. Among the windjammers blowing
between here and Honolulu there has
been always Â¦ a â¢ friendly rivalry. The
Irrrlgard has a record for a trip to Hon
olulu of nine days sixteen hours. Cap
tain Schmidt's satisfaction in this really
splendid performance was rudely jarred
while in Honolulu, when the Annie John
eon bowled around Diamond Head just
eight days sixteen hours from San Fran
cisco.

and the bark Annie Johnson
left Honolulu twenty-five

McCarthy admits that* he used one or
two profane words, but not 'within hear-,
ing of the. other passengers. Conductor
Nixon- called upon him to desist and a
discussion followed, which ended In the
saloon-man calling the conductor a liar.
Nixon then pinioned McCarthy over the
rear railing of the car and hostilities com
menced. A revolver in McCarthy's pocket
came into the possession of the conductor
and McCarthy's -head was scarred after
both had fallen to the street. McCarthy
says he did, not attempt to draw the
weapon; that it was dropping from his
pocket, whereupon he reached for it.
Nixon, however, says McCarthy tried to
use the weapon.
Captain Spillane ordered both men into
custody. Nixon was charged with ex
hibiting a deadly' weapon in a rude and
threatening manner, McCarthy with dis
turbing the peace. The latter's thumb
was severely wrenched during the strug
gle and was treated at the City and
County Hospital. McCarthy was a police
man for many years and is well known. !
A quarrel between Conductor David A.
Nixon of car No. 7 of the Valencia-street
line, and Jeremiah McCarthy, proprietor
of a Market-street saloon, caused commo
tion at the corner of Sixth and Market
street yesterday afternoon. In the strug?
gle both men fell to the street while the
car was in motion. A revolver was drawn
and McCarthy beaten on the bead by
the conductor. Women rushed to shelter
and screamed. Pedestrians scampered
out of the way of bullets, which they be
lieved were likely to fly, and finally sev
eral citizens separated the /combatants,
after which they were arrested.
According: to McCarthy's story he stood
at the corner of Market and Seventh
streets waiting for a car. He carried
several bundles and three or more grip
men ignored his signals and passed him
by. He then followed the Valencia street
car for half a block, and after catching
it he asked the conductor to explain why
cars did not stop at points designated. !

Oregon Crop Bulletin.
The report of Edward A. BÂ«e.ls. section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oijpgon Crop Bulletin for the week ended July
7. is as follows :
"TTie., rast week has been cloudy, with fre
quent Â»howere. and it was unseasonably cool.
The jainfall was light in the eastern part of
the State, but good rains f^ll in the western
ar.4 southern sections'. They were very bene
ficial to all late fowb crops, such as spring
â¢ram, potatoes and corn, and they also <5id
grÂ»-at gojid to the rar.jres. which have hereto
fore been short for the season of the year.
"Many meadows are now over-ripe, and
bright, warm weather is needed for haying.
TBonÂ« clover hay has beÂ«n cut. and the rains
have damaged it. but the amount sjv>Ued in
this way Is *ma'.l. as the farmers generally
have rut off haying until the weather be
comes more nettled.
"The condition of wheat continues to im
prove. Fell wheat is ripening nicely, and its
han>Â£t will become general In about two
, weeks. The heads of spring wheat are of
good size and they are filling under favorable
conditions. The oat crop ig in evea better con
dition than whtat. In Houthern Oregon the
rains came too late to help grain, and more
than the usual amount will be cut for hay.
Hoyi? continue making good advancement.
â¢"Prune* and rear* are unu?ua<:y promising.
Cherries have been fcadlv Injured by the rains.
KaFrberrles are plentiful, and the outlook for
apples is good."

NEW YORK, July 9.â The stock market de
veloped rather acute weakness to-day and the
volume of tales roee to more than double the
reoent average. The liquidation in New York
Central and the continued pressure to sell
United States Steel were the disturbing fac
tor*. There was no definite news to account
for the marked weakness of New York Cen
tral, but the tape was regarded a* giving
ground for ominous conjectures. These took
form in various surmises as to the measures
to be adopted by the corporation to secure
the capital which will be required to carry
on the vast terminal and other Improvements
which have been undertaken. Tiie fact of
this capital requirement is well known, and
the variation* in to-day's rumors had to do
simply with the manner of raisins it. There
were rumors of a projected ls*ue of new stock,
of a bond lÂ«sue and of a temporary loan on
the security of notes. The recent experience
of the Pennsylvania in floating Kb new stock
doeÂ« not offer encouragement for a simllar
undcrtaking by otner railroad coroorations.
It Is borne In mind that the New York Cen
tral *tookholders have authorized nearly $1S.
000.000 of stock, which It lies with the cred
itors to Issue. It ig also a fact that of the
general refunding mortgage for .<100.000.000
authorized in 1S97 $S5,000.000 was fcr refund
ing underlying bonds, while $15,000,000 was
reserved for new construction after l!Â«03. The
market rrice of these bonds never ftll below
101 until last week. When they sola at par,
and to-day they sold at 96. without any large
.blocks being marketed in the interval To in
fer an attempt to float a new issue of. these
boncg at present therefore seems unwarranted.
These conditions rave color to the day's ru
mor of the negotiation of a loan of something
like $18,000,000, the rumor as circulated carry-
Ing the further detail of an interest rate to be
paid at 6 per cent. The usual parallels were
alÂ«o drawn between Pennsylvania and ..New
York Central, which have been selling near a
parity, while the former is paying 6 per cent
with the flotation bMUmw stock achieved,
and the latter is paying 5 per cent dividend
with the new capital requirements yet to be
met. The downward plunge of nearly 4 points
in New. York Central was the event u(Â»on which
the whole market hinged. Selling cf the Steel
ttocks was aggravated by the Iron Agc"s show
ing of increased blast furnace capacity on
July 1. the increasing rate of accumulation of
pig iron and the slow recession In the steel
market. Pig iron was marked down during
the day and the rumors were" current of a
cut in steel billets at Plttsburg. United Stateg
Fteel soM within a fraction of its low record
levol and the second fives sold H 'ower than
ever before. The announcement .lust before
the close of the market of the engagement of
$2.0(X).000 in gold for export on Saturday
helped the late weakness. With the move
ment of currency from the interior arrested
and with a loss indicated already to Jhe sub
treasury of SX4SS.0O0, including payments for
gold exported and a surplus reserve liEt Satur
day of let* than $8,000,(100 in banks, the in
fluence of the future gold outgo reported may
be understood. The continued drain upon New
York tanks is in strong contrast to tl:e prompt
and enormous recuperation ghown by the Bank
of England and the Bank of France in their
weekly statement to-day following the semi
annual settlements. Developments In the cot
ton and grain market*, the new* cf the crops
and statements of railroad earning? were en
tirely Ignored In the day's *tock market. De
clines of 1 to 2 points were quite areneral and
â¢St. Paul. Heading, Norfolk and Western. Colo
rado Fuel and Tennessee Coal suffered even
more severely.
The bond market was heavy and sharp de
cline* were goored In some inactive mortgages.

IN COLLISION
You see, we buy great quantities of empty

here by machinery. It sometimes chances
Just what caused the explosion will
probably never be known, but it Is pretty
well' accounted for by John Bermingham
Jr., superintendent of the works and son
of the president of the powder company.
His theory is that the. accidental dis
charge of a percussion cap caused the
calamity. This precussion cap ignited a
small portion of powder and this instant
ly communicated to the powder in the
other, parts of the building, causing the
explosion and subsequent tragedy. Mr.
Bermingham said:

this city for further treatment. The doc-
Miss Woods was the first to be
taken from the wreck. She ,was
still alive, but a great wound in her
breast showed that she could not sur
vive. She was borne toward her home on
a stretcher, but died before her friends
could carry her beyond the scene of the
fatality.
phe is not known, but it came
without warning and left death and suf
fering where but a moment before was
the hum of industry. An ambitious
school girl's life was ended i^n a twinkling
and another girl from the same town now
lies maimed on a bed of pain. They were
trying to earn pin money during vacation.
Their names are Mary Woods, the dead,
and Mary Maguire, the maimed.
Mary Woods, a young girl engaged in
loading shells, was killed in a dreadful
manner. Mary Maguire was so seriously
hurt that she may die. and thre^ men
were frightfully burned. They are Jos
eph de Mello, Clyde O. Berryman and !â¢.
C. Kincannon. all of whom worked in the
cartridge plant, the scene of the disaster.
The cartridge plant occupies a position
apart from the other buildings at the
powder works. It was a wooden build
ing, partly reinforced on the outside by
corrugated iron. The structure was com
pletely shattered by the explosion, which
hurled down upon Its helpless victims
tons of heavy timbers and machinery.
The accident occurred just after 9
o'clock and it required an hour of hard
work by willing hands to fxtricate the
victims. Workmen and townspeople^ â
some of whom had relatives among these
working people^ â Â¦were attracted by> the
ominous rumble and they hurried to the
scene to offer assistance.
BODY TAKEN FROM WRECK.
A HUNDRED pounds of powder ex
ploded yesterday morning at the
California Powder Works, Pinole.
The exact cause of the catastro-
. Miss Maguire is also of. Elmira, where
she lived with her' mother. She is 17
years old. Berryman and- De-'Mello are
recently froni Santa Cruz; ..having been
employes of the powder works there.
Kincannon is a' San Franciscan.
The loss to the powder company will
amount to $5000. The -cartridge factory
must be entirely rebuilt and the machin
ery replaced. . The entire plant .was re
cently enlarged by the transfer of a por
tion of the Santa Cruz plant and ma
chinery to Pinole. .As the cartridge plant
is ' isolated, however, j there was no dam
age to the other buildings. .
A gang of line repairers for the West
ern Union Telegraph Company working
in front of the powder plant under their
foreman, F. C.TVIcColley, had as much
as they could do to . dodge the splinters
that came flying at them. The men were
at the^top of the telegraph poles at the
time and were nearly blown from their
perches. ' They were the first Ao" render
aid to the sufferers.
Miss Woods had been worklng.at the
powder works for three weeks. Her home
Is In Elmlra with; her '.parents, \Mr. and
Mrs. J. A. Woods. She was-a student at
the Elmira' High School and had intended
to work at the powder .works during the
summer months. She was 16 years old
and a native of Elmira..
Clarence Sylvester can thank his stars
that he was not killed outright. He was
standing in the doorway of the factory
meditating as to what he should do next.
He was the nearest person to the biggest
powder hopper, and was about to tur,n
toward it when It went up in smoke. He
was thrown out of the door some dis
tance, but landed safely."
James Athe was also lucky,' for he was
standing on the stairs between the first
and second floors. ,J3elng between the two
explosions he escaped the full force of
both and lives to tell the tale. ,
LINEMEN RENDER ASSISTANCE.
There were several narrow escapes. The
most remarkable was that of Miss Jessie
Merritt, a 13-year-old girl. She had been
assisting Miss Woods to load shells at
one of the machines, but was called to
another machine by Foreman Berryman
just before the explosion. She had barely
changed her place when there came a
great deafening sound, followed by the
falling of broken walls. Out of all this
Miss Merritt came without a scratch.
"But it hasn't geared me a bit," Miss
Merritt said In relating her story. "I am
perfectly willing to go back and work
there and take my chances."
SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES,
There was in the main hopper at the time
half a barrel of black sporting powder, equal
to about 100 pounds. One machine was load
ing smokeless powder and the other two were
loading black powder into shells. The smoke
less powder simply burned slowly, but the
black exploded up and down etairs almost sim
ultaneously. .
that in packing these a nail finds Its â¢way into
one of the shells. It. occupies the space that
should bo occupied by the percussion cap,
and when two things are trying to occupy the
same space .at the same time something
usually happens.
That is what probably occurred this morn
ng. Probably a nail was sticking; nut of one
of the shells and the macTilne forced the per
cussion cap against it. An explosion of the
cap of course followed and ignited the. powder
that was draining from the hopper above into
the shells that were being loaded by the
workers. It then exploded upward through
the hopper and pipe to the main hopper up
stairs.
The peddler was going along Mission
street and when he reached the corner ot
Third he was surprised to see McAvoy
leap on the back of his horse and start
the animal on a mad run along the street.
He called for help . and the louder ha
called the harder McAvoy urged the
frightened steed along till the animal was
going at a high rate of speed.
A large crowd gathered on the sidewalks
and seemed to enjoy the novel sight im
mensely. Several gave chase, but the
horse increased his speed and was in a
fair way to escape when a police of
ficer ran out to the middle of the street,
stopped the horse and took McAvoy to
the Emergency Hospital.
William McAvoy, apparently suffering
from the temporary loss of his senses,
created quite a sensation at the corner of
Third and Mission streets yesterday after
noon by jumping to the back of an Ital
ian fruit peddler's horse and startling the
animal so that It dashed through the
streets. He was finally captuYed and
locked up in the insane ward of the Emer
gency Hospital to await examination as
to his sanity.

this year's prices will rule lower than

Alexander Weingartner. United States
Consul at Catania, Italy, reporting on the
almond crop, states that the conditions
and prospects are much more favora-ble
than last year and that the crop will not
fall short of an average one. The crop
Is estimated at 60,000 bags of 100 kilos
(220.46 pounds), or 13,227.600 poonds shelled.
Present prices per 100 kilo* shelled.f. o.
b., Catania, are as follows:
Promptâ Palma-Glrgentl, 161 lire; Palma

ed, 174: Avola, selected, 190; Avola, cur
rents, 173.

A lire is .valued at 19.3 cents United
States gold.
An examination of the house showed
that a bed had been ripped open, also
the pillows, and the feathers were scat
tered all over the room. The drawers of
the bureau were pulled out and their con
tents strewn upon the floor. Pictures
were torn from the walls and carpets
were taken up in many places.
Mrs. Hughe? was prostrated by the
shock. She Aas tenderly cared for by
neighbors and put to bed. She suffered
bruises and cuts and is also suffering
from an aggravation of the injuries she
received in the street car accident. Mrs.
Hughes was unable to describe her assail
ant. She says she only saw one man,
but her head was covered before she
could get a look at him.
Police Officer McGovern has been de
tailed on the case and is making a care
ful investigation. The trio gained en
trance to the house from the rear. They
were evidently familiar with the interior
and the habits of the occupants, as ihey
selected a time when the helpless wo
man was alone. The husband is a brick
layer. He has informed the police that
he suspects a certain individual and a
sharp lookout is being kept for him. Mr.
Hughes says no one but himself and v/ife
and a. few relatives knew that his wife
had received a sum of money from tne
railroad.
The robbery occurred shortly after
coon. Mrs. Hughes was painfully mak
ing her way from her room to the dining
room with ih<? aid of crutches. Her littl-j
girl was playing outside the door. The
neighborhood is thickly populated and
she never dreamed of aanger. Suddenly
she was roughiy seized from behind and
thrown to tne floor. Her apron was
thrown over her head and her cries
tmothered by her brutal assailant. T.he
robber grasped the feeble woman by the
throat and forced her head against the
floor with great force. She was momen
tarily stunned and the man forced her
apron into her mouth as a gag. He still
held her down and searched her pockets.
In doing so he lore her dress in many
places. He ripped open the /bosom of her
waist and found ?15 in a purse.
Mrs. Hughes recovered sufficiently to
cry for help. She heard the other men
tearing up the carpets, throwing down
the bed and bureau and knocking the
chairs around in a vain search for the
money they believed was hidden in the
house. Mrs. Hughes' cries attracted the
attention of her eleven-year-old daughter
and as soon as she discovered her mother
was in danger the little one aroused the
neighbornood. Assistance" came too latt,
however, as the bold thieves made their
escape.
Believing she had a large sum of money
hidden in the house, three burglars en
tered the home of Mrs. Bridget Hughes,
314 Gough street, yesterday afternoon and
treated her in a brutal nunnei. The bold
trio were only able to secure $15, which
was snatched from the dress of their
helpless victim.
The robbery was a particularly daring
one. Mrs. Hughes was alone in her
house, being confined there through in
juries she received in the street car colli
sion between a Fillmore street electric
car and a ilaJght street cable car on Ala/
'M. She had received a large sum from
the railroad company as a compromise of
her claim, and, fortunately for her, she
had placed the money in a savings
bank. The robbers believed she had tne
money hidden la the house, and in th*ir
eearch tor it played havoc witn the fur
nishings.
H. W. Carey, United States Vice Consul
at Alicante, Spain, reports that the
almond crop In his district promises to
be abundant and the quality, he under
stands, is good. It is calculated that
more than double of last year's crop will
be collected. The planting of almond
trees is yearly largely increased in all
the almond growing districts of the pro
vince. Consul Carey reports that some
40,000 to 50,000 bales may be roughly cal
culated as this year's coming crop. Prices
will not be fixed until the middle of
August, when the first kernels are
brought to market. It Is thought that
ALMONDS IN ABUNDANCE.
The freight to New York via Liverpool
is 35 shillings per ton, plus 10 per cent
primage. The 10 per cent primage is re
turned at the end of the season to ship
pers who have not made any shipments
by direct steamers.
Consul I^ane's report also shows that
last year's prices for August and to the
end of October ruled as follows: Finest
Sultanas, 41 to 42 shillings per cwt. of 112
pounds; fine Sultanas, 38 to 40 shillings
per cwt.; good Sultanas, 2S to 30 shillings
per cwt.
From November 1 prices gradualy de
clined to the present, as follows: Finest
Sultanas, 34 to 40 shillings -per cwt.; fine
Sultanas,. 31 to 33 shillings, and good Sul
tanas, 26 to 27 shillings per cwt.
The report further states that it may
reasonably be expected that prices for
the coming season will bo lower than last
season.
The crop of Sultana raisins is considered
good, exceeding the average by 25 per
cent. Red and black raisins show a good
average. Last year's actual stock in the
hands of dealers amounts to: Sultana,
about -u0 tons; black raisins, 1600 tons, and
red, nil.
RAISIN CROP IS GOOD.
The grapes, reports Tourgee. not hav
ing blossomed, put out with unexpected
vigor, and a third of a crop may, at least,
be expected.
Rufus W. Lane. United States Consul at
Smyrna, reports that the prospects to
June 3 for 1903 show Sultana raisins aggre
gating 39,000 tons, black 16,000 tons and
red 11,000 tons, as against the crop of 1902
which yielded 33,000 tons of Sultanas. 15,
000 tons of black and 10,000 tons of red.
The Consul reports that there, is every
prospect of an ordinary crop of walnuts,
though it is too early, he says, to decide
with accuracy, though all reports agree
with his observations.
There is little likelihood, if any possibil
ity, the Consul states, that the prune crop
of the region under consideration for 1903
will exceed one-half of last yeaV's, which
was about one-tenth of an ordinary crop.
He says that owing to last year's short
crop there are practically no prunes in
stock, except what are left over of Im
portations from California last year.
The State Horticultural Commissioners
have issued an important and interesting
bulletin showing the present condition of
the foreign almond, prune, walnut, grape
and raisin crops and prospects for the
coming season, compiled from reports re
ceived from the United States Consuls at
Smyrna, Turkey, Catania/ Italy; Alicante,
Spain, and Bordeaux, France.
