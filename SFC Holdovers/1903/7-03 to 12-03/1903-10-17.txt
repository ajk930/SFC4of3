News of SarafoflTs Death Confirmed.
SALONICA. European Turkey. Oct. lo.â
The report of the death of Boils Sara
foff, the famous Macedonian leader, is
confirmed. An imperial irade has been
received here ordering severe punishment
to b* meted out to Eoldiers guilty of bru
tality, theft cr drunkenness.
From the engine-house the flre leaped into therDabley block, a one-story
structure, and to the, Anderson block, just north. All the" buildings in the -block"
bounded by Heron, Hume and G and H streets were soon in the grip of : the flames/
The fire was ajeo, playing; havoc: with the front of stores on the north side i of
Heron street" From Anderson's block the .fire jumped to the State Bank' arid'
every store from that corner to, the Hayes Bank and all the buildings in the
block bounded by Heron,' G, Wishkah and H* streets were burned, .'including the
Central School building/ Pf und's Jewelry store, Fuller's store, Brecker's grocery,
a new billiard parlor, the City v. Council chamber, .Wheeler Bros/ 'store/ Lucart's
candy kitchen and the express office. '.". George Wolff's i-dry goods store -inline' fine

equipped Crescent Hotel. *- -f :' . '.'Â¦Â¦- \-
GREAT VOLUMES OF FLAMES SHOOT INTO THE AIR.
From the Mack block the fire spread to the fine new hosehouse and head
quarters of the Fire Department and matters 'began to look exceedingly gloomy.
Great volumes of flames shot into the air and the heat became unbearable a block
dlstanU The saloon next to the engine-house was" soon: blazing: and then the
flames jumped across the alley to Walker's ; saloon, arid every building^ In 7." the
block bounded by Heron and F and G streets, Including Kaufman's brick block,
were destroyed. Word went along every business street to prepare for the worst
and as far. up as the Commercial block there were hurried' preparations, to get
out of dancer. Â¦ I8B8sÂ§8
The fire started in the old Mack building on Hume street, owned by Oscar
L. Cain, which had been regarded as a fire trap and a dangerously constructed
building. It was three stories high and was occupied by many single men, who
cooked their own meals, chiefly/on oil stoves. / It was in a room on the third
story where the flre started and the interior of* the building : was a mass of
flames before an alarm *was sent in. The building: was leased by -.Louisa Sel
borg, who had just fitted it up with new furniture.. She escaped wifh her chil
dren, saving no clothes. i
The fire was the most destructive in the history of the town and wiped out
ten business blocks and residences. Not more than one-half of the loss is covered
by Insurance, for the reason that the Insurance companies have refused to carry
any great risk on account of the inflammable material of which all' the build
ings in Aberdeen are constructed. Every business man in the city is a loser,
either by fire, water, removal or by theft. Not anticipating that the flames
could get beyond the Fire Department's control many waited until the fire was
close upon them before starting to move out The streets were soon 'strewn
and littered with all kinds of material and the rush and haste of teams â¢ and
people in every direction caused great confusion.
The injured: John Steen, kicked In the head by a runaway horse; J. D. Han
sen, head and body bruised; A. Bretberg, head cut; H..W. Lacey, kicked in the
head by a runaway horBe; John Mills of Hoqulam.foot injured; William Ogles

The Duke says he cannot reject the
Invitation of the Free Food League to
become Its president, although he must
accept that office conditionally. He con
tinues:
"It Is seventeen years since I took an
actH-e part in the campaign against home
rule. It is not in my power to take the
eame active part now that I took then.
I must be regarded as adverse to the
proposition, rather than as a combatant
of it. It is with some reluctance that I
consent to even this limited part in the
present controversy, but I feel that many
Unionist members of Parliament' whose
ideas I believe agree with mine are mak
ing great sacrifices in order to, maintain
their opinions, and I am unwilling that
they should regard me as Indifferent to
their political interests. Sincerely yours,
"DEVONSHIRE."
Mr. RltchJe, the late Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and Lord George Hamilton,
late Secretary of State for India, have
also joined the league. â¢ r
The Duke of Devonshire's adhesion ito
the Free Food League la .regarded as
gneatly etrengthening the free trade party.
PRESIDENCY ACCEPTED.
VIEWS OF HIS GRACE.
"Devonshire House, Oct. 13.
"Dear Beach: You informed me when
we last met that the wish had been ex
pressed that I join the league and take
a. part in its operations. I understand
.that the principal object of the league is
to oppose the new departure in the fiscal
policy, which has now been definitely an
nounced and which includes the taxation
of food imports from foreign countries
Â£jid preferential treatment for the colo
nies, as well 2s a general tariff on im
ported manufactured jroods.
"I understand that these objects do not
involve opposition to the policy of the
Government in so far as that Dolicv Is
limited to reserving to the Government
the right of proposing to Parliament tariff
legislation for the purpose of negotiating
commercial treaties and the mitigation of
hostile tariffs."
Continuing, the Duke of Devonshire re
fers to the desirability of restraining "the
6trongly protectionist tendencies mani
fested at the recent conference at Shef
field," and says the duty of combating
before the country the doctrines of the
Tariff Reform League ehould not be left
entirely to radicals and members of the
Cobden Club.
This important move in the fiscal con
test developed to-night at the meeting of
the Parliamentary committee of the
league In a letter from the Duke of Dev
onshire to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach. Mr.
Ritchie's predecessor as Chancellor of the
Exchequer, accepting the proffered presi
dency of the league under certain condi
tions, which was read. The committee
adopted a resolution unanimously accept
ing the conditions, and this action was
immediately communicated to the Duke
of Devonshire. The substance of the
Duke's letter follows:
LONDON, Oct 16.-The Duke of Devon
shire, late Lord President of the Council,
has conditionally accepted the presidency
of the Free Food League, which is or

policy of Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Bal

SAX RAFAEL, Oct. IS.â The steamer
Cazadero, loaded with commuters, was
nearly run into by the Santa Fe ferry
boat Ocean Wave last night. Both ves
sels were just off Alcatraz Island. There
was a heavy fog at the time. The Caza
dero was en route to Sausallto loaded
with passengers for various places along
the line of the N\>rth Shore road. They
left San Francisco at 6:13. The Ocean
Wave was en route from Point Richmond
to San Francisco and. was taking the
place of the San Pablo. When about
half way between Alcatraz and Wharf
No 27, 'the Cazadero â¢ showed up out of
the dense fog bank. Soon thereafter the
whistle of an approaching boat was
heard, but her location was not certain."
Suddenly the two boats passed each other
in close proximity. The screaming whis
tles aroused the fears of the passengers
and many of them, especially the women,
were badly frightened. The cooler ones,
however, knowing- the danger had passed,
quieted the timid ones and the passen
gers were soon thereafter landed on the
iausalito ferry slip.

FRESNO, Oct. 16.â George B. Mathis, a.
farmer living near" Wheatville, thirty
five miles west of this city, took a dose
of strychnine yesterday by accident and
died after suffering terrible agony for
several hours. Mathis complained of a
headache when he got up in the morn
ing. ; He' -at tended, to his chores, and on
returning to the house for breakfast
went to his bedroom to take a dose of
quinine. He had been in the habit of
taking quinine , in ' a powdered form,
measuring the dose on the point of a
knife. Wednesday Mathis had been to
Laton, the nearest marketing place, and
had there purchased "a small box of
strychnine, which had simply been label
ed "Strychnine; poison," and not marked
with the customary sign of the skull and
crossbones. Being a little nearsighted
he did not , notice the label, opening the
box and taking a dose of the drug before
he realized his mistake. ,*He called to his
wife that he was poisoned, but before he
could explain what had happened he was
siezed with terrible cramps and from that
moment until his death was writhing in
awful pain and unable'to speak. Mathis
was 49 years of age. He leaves a wife
and two grown daughters. ,

who were former Warden Agulrre's fa

morning that their services would be no

were made that the guards' services were
not efficient and no time was given them
to hunt for other positions before being
taken off the San Quentin pay roll. In
dismissing the guards the Warden simply
informed them that he wished to fill their
places by more efficient men.
2 Those who were dismissed to-day were
S. Taylor. F. Finney, D. Avila, J. D. Ma

Figueroa. Of this number three were
particular favorites of Warden Aguirre.
Their positions during the Agulrre regime
were coveted plums. Their work was
light and the remuneration handsome.
With the new Warden, however, the jobs
were not so pleasant and the work more
laborious. These three, D' Avila. Fig

tower, respectively. M. Powefl, one of
those dismissed to-day, was one of the

he had been located in the jute mill. To

Japanese agreement provides expressly
for the maintenance of Korean integrity,

"It. is not natural to suppose that the

The substance of the decision is that

priest in such a case is a duty laid upon
the conscience of the clergyman alone,
and that the legacy vests in the priests
and passes to his legal representative,

WASHINGTON, Oct. IS.â J. E. Ballaine,
chairman of the finance committee of the
Alaskan Central Railway, who has been
before the departments for the last week
on work connected with the construction
of the road, has been successful in his ef
forts. The projected road will extend
from Seward. on the southern coast of
Alaska, north to the Tanna River, 420
miles, and will open when completed all
of Central Alaska to daily communication
throughout the year. It is being built at
the rate of 125 miles a year.
President Roosevelt personally recom
mended to the heads of departments the
expediting of business Ballaine had with
them owing to the public dependence on
the enterprise in the development of re
sources in Alaska. The Postofflce De
partment established a postoffice at Sew

mate for the extension of the Government
cable along the southern coast of Alaska
an appropriation sufficient to make
Beward one of the cable's objective
points. The Interior Department gave
final approval -to the surveys of the road.

TOO YOUNG TO MARRY,
BOY . LOVER CONCLUDES
Wakens License Clerk at 2 O'clock
in Morning and Then Changes
Mind.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 16.â A young man giv
ing the name of .Joseph Groom and a pre
possessing young miss, .both ;of whom
were well under the 'age limit, made an
attempt to secure a marriage license
shortly after 2 o'clock this morning. Two
of the clerks of the County Clerk's office
were called up about Â¦ that hour this
morning over the telephone and asked to
come down to the Courthouse and Issue
a marriage license. Clerk Shilue dressed
arid went down, and found ..the couple
standing on the steps of the Courthouse.
There was a wet fog at the time and the
couple were nearly chilled through.
Clerk Shilue had just got the name of
the young man a,nd began swearing him
as to his age, when the would-be groom
was attacked by a case of "cold feet," and
said he had "concluded he was too young
to get married. The girl urged her lover
to get the license, but he was obstinate.
The couple refused to tell who they
were or where they came from. Groom
Is believed to be a resident of this city,
but the young woman is said to come
from ' either San Francisco , or Oakland.
It is believed, they came to this city last
night on the theater train from San Fran
cisco and at once went to the Courthouse.
No application was made for a license by
them to-day and it is thought they have
left the city. x â¢

LEGACY VESTS
IN THE PRIEST
SEIGEB AND BBITT
AT REQUIRED WEIGHT
Go Through the Farcical Operation
of Weighing In Although Not
Intending to Fight.
Jimmy Britt and Charley Seiger. the
boxers, weighed in yesterday at 6 o'clock
and saved their forfeits. The fact that
Britt spent the day In a hammara bath"
to get down to weight and that he Is on
crutches did not seem incongruous to thÂ«
Californian.
Britt had lived up to the letter of h *
contract with the San Francisco Athlet'e
Club even if he had not fulfilled its spirit.
It served to show how loosely drawn the
articles were when a disabled boxer could
go through the hollow mockery of weigh
ing in for a fight in which he could not
take part.
Britt was particularly unfortunate. In
getting Injured, as his friends believe he
would have found Seiger an easy mark.
This did not justify him, however, in
the course he pursued. The more sports
manlike plan would have been to ac
knowledge his InabiUty to fulfill his con
tract and then to make the best possible
arrangement. Britt weighed at the bath3
while Seiger stepped on the scales at
Corbetfs. Each weighed about 132.
pounds.
If Brltt's foot continnes to improve the
fight will be held on the 23th test. Rufe

Bismarck's Statue.
Bismarck's monument for the new Ber
lin Cathedral has at last attained Its final
shape. The Iron Chancellor is .to be rep
resented as a German knight of the Mid
dle Ages. At first the Kaiser was in
clined toward a cuirassier uniform, and
considered also the suggestion of a sculp
tor that Bismarck should appear as a
Reman Senator, but only to reject It.
When the Kaiser was Inspecting the
model the architect of the cathedral ven
tured to remark that Bismarck looked
rather ; like a protector (huter) of the
Hohenzollerns. â¢ The Kaiser at once re
plied: "Nonsense; we Hohenzollerns re
quire no protector. We protect our
selves."âNew York Times.

ROYAL GUESTS
VISIT THE MINT
DENVER, Oct. 16.-It was definitely
learned to-day that the charges on which
Brigadier General John Chase of the Colo
rado National Guard has been summoned
before a military court next Monday are
perjury and disobedience of orders. The
perjury is in connection with the impris
onment of Davis., one of the strike lead
ers at Crioole Creek.
General Cljase signed court papers
which stated that, Davis had been re
leased. His friends say he did not read
the^ papers carefully and committed the
act' Inadvertently. His enemies say that
is no excuse for the act.
Charges against Colonel Frederick Gross
and Colonel Frank Kimball have been
formulated by Major Arthur H. Williams
and General Chase. They allege that
loaded weapons were drawn by Gross and
Kimball on Major Williams and two or
derlies. General Chase will file charges
with the Governor against Adjutant Gen
eral Sherman Bell, but the Governor, it
is intimated, will not hand them to the
judge advocate unless Chase should de
mand a special court-martial.
Military Court -Will Hear
Case of a Colorado
Officer.
GENERAL JOHN CHASE j OF
THE NATIONAL GUARD OF
COLORADO. . .
â¢ Dr. A. B. Royal, who attended Rogers
in the sickness culminating in his death
February 25. last, says there were no un
usual- symptoms. The cas.e promises to
be one of the bitterest ever, fought in the
courts of Southern California, and sensa
tional developments are ! expected.
At the time of Rogers' death Rose
Kearns was employed In the house as
domestic. Miss Kearns says she was ap
proached repeatedly by Harrison with of
fers of money if she would consent to
repeat upon the witness 'stand whatever
he would dictate. ,
Mrs. Rogers, through her attorney, A.
R. Metcalfe, declares Harrison' is bent on
blackmail and â¢ that he has made every
effort to induce Mrs. Rogers to marry
him, that' he might get her property.
Harrison, says Mrs. . Rogers, suddenly
"discovered" that he was a long lost
cousin 1 of hers and thus worked his way
into her home. She met Harrison by
chance Just after her husband's body had
been cremated. Then he wooed and wooed
her, though Mrs. Rogers is nearly 70 and
Harrison but 30. Mrs. Rogers declares
Harrison has an agreement' with - the
Eastern heirs that he is to receive a
quarter of the estate If he can break the
will. â¢ -
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 36.â An effort, to
day, by the slighted heirs of the late Ben
jamin C. Rogers of Pasadena to break
his will. reveals a situation possessing all
the' sensational ' features of a sizzling
melodrama, j Death, cremation, charges of
poisoning, alleged blackmail, intimidation
and proffers of marriage having in view
a division of the Rogers estate are the
features. of the case. The estate is worth
$30,000.
C. S. Harrison of this city has called
upon the Sheriff" and District Attorney to
investigate the death of Rogers. Harri
son's attorney is G. A. Gibba and he rep
resents a brother and two sisters In the
East, heirs who were overlooked. Harri
son alleges that Rogers was killed by the
administration of arsenic forced Into
grapes. He asseverates that during a
residence at the Rogers home he became
possessed of verbal, written and collat
eral* evidence that point toward the poi
soning of Roger's. He exhibited a bottle
of strychnine,- grapes containing poison
and a sworn statement by "Dr." J. W.
Dinsdale of Los Angeles, in which the lat
ter sets forth that he was approached by,
Mrs. Rogers with an softer of $100 if he
would lend his assistance to her setting
rm of her husband.
Special Dispatch . to The Call.
A feature of the ', encyclical is that it
is not sealed with the fisherman's sign,
from which it is argued that thi3- relic
of the papacy has not yet been found
since the death of Pope Leo XIII.
Continuing the Pontiff says: "The de
sire for peace is certainly harbored in
every breast and there is no one who
does not ardently Invoke It. But to want
peace without God Is an absurdity, seeing
that when God is absent thence, too. Jus
tice flees, and when Justice is taken away
it is vain to cherish hope, of peace, for
peace is the work of Justice.
"There are many, we are weU aware,
who in their yearning for peace, that is.
for tranquillity of order, band themselves
Into societies and parties, which they
style 'parties of order.' Hope and labor
lost, for there is but one party of oider
capable of restoring peace in the midst
of_all this turmoil and that is the party
of God."
"Some will certainly be found who,
measuring divine things by human stand
ards, will seek to discover secret aims
of ours, distorting them to an earthly
scope and to partisan design.
"To eliminate all vain delusion for such
we say to theift with emphasis that we
do not wish to^ be, and with divine as
sistance never shall be, aught before hu
man societv but the minister of God, of
whose authority we are the depository.
Hence should any one ask. of us a sym
bol as the expression of our will, we will
give this and no other, to renew all things
In Christ."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16.â The text of
the first encyclical of Pope Pius X
reached Washington to-day. It is dated
Rome, October 4. The document will be
read by Catholics and non-Catholics
alike with intense interest, as leading
Catholics here say it reveals the person
ality of the new Pope as a written com
position seldom pictures the mind of its
author. It breathes In every line an in
tense religious zeal and indicates that
the new Pontiff is reactionary from the
scientific policies of Leo' XIII.
The Pope devotes 6everal paragraphs
to exhortations and then comes to prac
tical remedies, intimating that priests
must he apostles first and scholars after
ward. He exhorts Bishops to regard their
seminaries for the training of their priests
as the "delight of their hearts and to be
careful in the selecting of candidates."
He then specifies generally his theories,
and in this he reacts strongly from poli
cies of Pope Leo XIII. The encyclical
Indicates, in the opinion ot leading Cath
olics, that Bishops created by Pope Pius
X will be known more for their evangeli
cal work than for their learning or sci
ence.
The encyclical is more than 6000 words
long' in translation.
After detailing his sense of grief and
reluctance to take the "papacy, Pope Pius
X pays an eloquent tribute to his prede
cessor and then proclaims his own policy.
He says: "Since, however, it has. been
pleasing to the divine will to raise our
lowliness to such sublimity of power, we
take courage in him who strengthens us,
and setting ourself to the work, relying
on the power of God, we proclaim that
we have no other programme in the
supreme Pontificate but that of 'restoring
all things in Christ, so that Christ may
be 'all in all.'

CINCINNATI. Oct 1&â The evidence
was concluded and argument* were be
gun to-day in the trial of Miller and
Johns for alleged conspiracy to extort a
bribe. As six hours were allowed for
arguments and only half an hour was
consumed before court adjourned to-night
It- is evident that, with five and a half
hours for arguments to-morrow and ad
ditional time for the charge of the Jury
and motions, the case will not go to the
jury before to-morrow evening. The fea
ture to-day .was the testimony of the two
defendants. For the first time during the
week John" J. Ryan was not on the stand,
but Chief Inspector Cochran appeared for
the third time. After being on the wit
ness stand three hours yesterday Johns
was cross-examined for over an hour to
day. He denied that he had told Inspec
tors Vlckery and Fulton when they were
investigating him at Rockville that he
would talk If he thought nothing would
come of it except the dismissal of a clerk
in Washington. Most of his evidence to
day consisted of such denials.
Miller waa on the witness stand from
11:30 a. m. and left at 3 p. m. and was
generally considered to be an exception
ally strong witness for himself both la
direct and cross-examination. He was
cool and deliberate and the court fre
quently stopped him from arguing his
own case while answering questions. His
examination by Attorney Rullson . waa
considered an exceptionally strong pro
ceeding, while Miller afterward was con
fronted Â¦with the most severe cross-exami
nation without being disturbed, even in
trying to explain contradictions in his own
statements.
Reaction From Leo's Scien
tific Policies Is In-
Charge Among Other Things
That the Deceased Was
Poisoned.
The labor leaders declared, that those
who advocated the "open shop" were in
sincere.
Josiah Strong of New York and David
Coates, former Lieutenant Governor of
Colorado, were among the speakers at the
afternoon session.
Henry White, general secretary of the
United Mine Workers, spoke against the
restriction of output.
-Frank Buchanan, president of the In
ternational Bridge and Structural Iron
Workers' Association, spoke on "What
Can Be r>one to Establish Better Rela
tions Between Employer and Employe."
President' Buchana* said as long as the
"open shop" remained relations between
labor and capital would be inharmonious
and it would be better for capital if dis
honest representatives of each were elim
inated.
James McConnell, president of the In
ternational Association of Machinists,
talked on the question of the restriction
of output and the methods of paying for
labor performed.
Labor men predominated in the proceed
ings and at one time, when the discus
sion was becoming general, several In the
audience arose and talked on questions
which at times tended toward socialism.
Samuel Gompers, president of the con
ference, however, checked the debate and
compelled the speakers to limit "the dis
cussion to topics at Issue. Tfii: Â«
Among those in attendance were Henry
C. Hunter, commissioner of the Metal
Trades Association of New York; Marcus
M. Marks, president of the National
Clothing Manufacturers' Association of
New York; M. "Gunn of New York; James
N. O'Connell, president of the Interna
tional Association of Machinists; W. P.
Phalder of Philadelphia; Frank Buchan
an, head of the Structural Iron Workers;
John Phillips of Brooklyn; John P. Arch
ibald of New York; Former Lieutenant
Governor Coates of Colorado and Dr. Jo
slah Strong of New York.
CHICAGO, Oct. 16.â Although questions
of dispute and of great Interest to the
wage earner and the employer, such as
the "open shop," methods of paying
wages, piecework and bonus, came up be
fore the conference of the National Civic
Federation to-day, no action has been de
cided upon that will Improve the rela
tions of the principals in the controversy.
However, It Is not considered improbable
that before the session Is brought to a
close some action toward bringing labor
and capital eto^er together may be taken.
A number of the speakers'at the session
to-day favored this, saying the occasion
was opportune.

In order to stop the further progress of the flames dynamite \rcu3 used in
several buildings on which the flames were advancing.

way from Heron tip to I street, destroying: the residence of "W. B. Mack. *
Telephone messages brought the fire departments of Hoqulam and Montesano
to the scene and they did effective work. All sorts of reports concerning the
death or injury of well-known business men were current. While four deaths
have resulted from the fire, the accidents were comparatively few. At I o'clock
this afternoon the fire was under control.
Aberdeen has a population of about 7000 and the chief industry is lumbering.
Several large sawmills are located near the town, but the fire did not reach them.
Â¦When the nro had reached the Pullman saloon several men were hurt by a
wall giving way. Among the injured was Chief Koehler, who was rendered un
conscious, but later returned to his duties. J. D. Hansen and Colin McKlnzlo
were Injured by falling walls of the Ki.gle danca halL McKinzIe waa caught
under the heavy timbers and his back was broken. He was taken to the hospital,
where he died.
The other fatalities were at the Mack building, where Charles Rolf*?, a one^
legged man. was cremated. When the flames had completely enveloped the
building the spectators were iiorrlQed by seeing Daniel Webster, a well-known
character, appear at one of tiie windows. Before a ladder coul 1 be raised to his
aid he Jumped. Almost every bone In h is body was broken and he died soon
after being removed to the hospital. An unknown man was killed by a falling
wall.

Milton C. Quimby, one of the promoters
of the settlement, testified that Dresser
was not allowed to know what stocks had
been deposited. Learning of the. financial
embarrassment of Dresser, he said, he
had approached Dresser with a plan by
which he might be extricated from his
difficulties, proposing to deposit securities
for the payment of Dresser's obligations,
in return . for which Dresser should be
come president of a Staten Island realty
company and be given a large block of
the capital stock of $3,500,000. Through
Dresser's influence the stock was to be
marketed, the proceeds from a part of
Dresser's allotment to be used to redeem
the securities deposited. Dresser consent
ed, and Quimby then interested Alvord
and Timothy Cohalon, acting for them
selves and others, to deposit certain
stocks and bonds as security and to guar
antee a value of JS50.000 to them.
Elmer Alford identified an agreement
signed by him with other guarantors, to
gether with Dresser, to turn over J350.00O
worth of securities, the agreement guar
anteeing them to be worth this amount,
but he admitted that the securities depos
ited were worth much less.
Charles S. Mackenzie, one of the receiv
"ers, testified that he had learned for the
first time to-day that the securities which
had been represented to him as standard
stocks of a market value of JSS0.000 in
cluded In reality stocks and bonds of gold
mining and undeveloped railroad compa
nies, which were worth far less than that
amount.

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 16.â Dr. Jona
than Taft, one of the best known dentists
of the country and founder and for many
years dean of the dental department of
the University of Michigan, died at his
home here last night.
Distinguished Dentist Dies.
The other case was that of Harry Gas
per, a longshoreman, well known to men
employed about the wharfs. At 8:30
o'clock Gasper, who has lived for the last
two years at the house where "Walker"
sent a bullet into his head, was seen to
walk along the Washington-street wharf
toward the water. He approached Wil
liam Sanders, the watchman, and asked
him, "How is work?" Sanders repliea In
a Jocular way, "Work and I fell out a
long while ago." Gasper, who had evi
dently been drinking, answered, "So it
has with me," and walking about fifteen
feet toward the end j of the wharf cried
out, "Good-by" and, drawing a revolver
from his pocket, instantly shot himself.
The act wast witnessed by several men
employed on the Vigilant.
Sergeant Ellis of , they Harbor police sta
tion answered a call / and * had the â¢ man
conveyed to the Harbor Emergency Hos
pital." Dr. Henry Murphy found that the
bullet had penetrated the left lung 'and
lodged In the back. Gasper told Sergeant
Ellis that -he was tired of living. - .
He was later transferred to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where his condition
was " pronounced critical. " Gasper â¢ is a
brother of. Frank Gasper, a well-known
politician. '
One man committed suicide last night
by shooting himself in the head and an
other man attempted to take his own life
and will probably die from the effects of
the self-inflicted pistol wound. Both men,
by a strange coincidence, were from 'Â¦ the
same address and, it is thought, were
unknown to each other. There was but
half an hour's difference between the two
tragic occcurrences. .
At 9 o'clock a man entered the Tremont
House, 523 Kearny street and asked O.
F. Woods, the night clerk, for a room.
He registered . under the . name of
"Wright" and was shown to a room by
Woods. The night clerk had barely re
turned to the office when he was startled
by the report of a pistol shot. He has
tened to several rooms to ascertain
whence .the report came, and heard faint
moans in the room Just taken by
"Wright." He entered and found the man
lying on the floor ln^a pool of blood, a
revolver resting between' his legs. r An
ambulance was called and . Walker was
sent to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where he died later. He was, recognized
as a man named William Walker, who
made an attempt to take his life last
Tuesday by inhaling gas at the St. Da
vid's House, Howard street, and was ta
ken to the Emergency Hospital, where
he quickly recovered. As he left the hos
pital on that occasion he said, "I'll make
a better job of It next time."
Shortly after 10 o'clock Thursday morn-
Ing Mrs. Mendel returned to the hotel
after a trip down town. She looked about
the room for her 1 necklace, and being un
able to find ' It immediately became ex
cited and raised an alarm. Her friends
assisted her in searching the premises,
but the search resulted in nothing, and
it was decided to call the police. As soon
as Captain of Detectives John Martin had
been communicated with he dispatched
Detectives Mulcahy, O'Dea and Bailly
to the place. Â¦Â»
It appeared for a time as if a big case
of theft was'on the tapis. Mrs. Mendel
clung to the story that she had secreted
the Jewelry somewhere about the room
and that It had been taken. The sleuths
accomplished i a systematic search," but
without results, and, soon started to solve
the problem by questioning the attaches
of the house. The proprietor disputed
the theory that a robbery had been com
mitted and urged the lady to make a fur
thelr search. .
At the noon hour Mrs. Mendel was
changing her dress and after unloosening
the folds of her shirt waist was surprised
to see the necklace dropped to the floor.
The police were then telephoned to and
excitement was allayed. The string had
become unclasped in some manner and
slipped Into the dress. Good fortune pre
vailed that the gems were not lost in the
street and that they remained where they
did. '
Considerable of a flurry was created in
police circles Thursday, when Mrs. George
H. Mendel Jr., wife of the assistant sec
retary of the Fireman's Fund Insurance
Company, reported to the detective de
partment that a necklace valued at $15,000
had been lost or stolen. Three detectives
were hurried to the lady's apartments, at
the Richelieu Hotel, on Van Ness avenue,
and the case was a perplexing one for a
time. Mrs. Mendel Insisted that she had
placed the jeweled necklace under the
mattress of her bed and that it had dis
appeared. Later she found that the string
of gems had slipped from her neck and
was- concealed In the folds of her dress.

Social Dlrpatch to The Call.
William and Verel Redford. the parents
of the dead girl, have resided at Alto
about three months. Redford is the chief
engineer of the North Shore power-house
at Alto and occupies one of the company's
new houses near the electric plant.
His daughter Lizzie, aged 6 years, Is sick
at home, while her elder sister, Verel,
aged 11 years, was taken 111 in San Fran
cisco only a short time ago. The child
that died was ill only about three weeks.
The Redford domicile Is a new structure,
as is everything In connection therewith
Some tanks just to the rear of the home
are used for water to supply the plant
and for drinking purposes. Assistant En
gineer H. E. Walker, who lives in the
house adjoining the Redford home, does
not hesitate to say he believes Mary Red
ford died from drinking the water, which
had been poisoned by white lead.
Others who have been at the plant and
living near by are of the same opinion. In
making the connections it is presumed the
plumbers unintentionally let white lead
drop into the tank and did not clean it
out before the water was turned in. The
father of the dead girl was particularly
non-committal when seen at his home.
He would neither affirm nor deny that his
child died of Brlght's disease, but would
simply refer to Dr. Spottlswood. Dr. Spot
tiswood stated yesterday that none of the
other members of the family were 111, but
to-night when ft developed that the other
children were sick he refused to talk.
Circumstances surrounding the death,
together with the Illness of two others of
the same family, has aroused the suspi
cion of Coroner Sawyer, and to-night he
asserted that he would investigate the

host," under the leadership of John Alex
ander* Dowie, grarrisoned Madison Square
Garden to-day and completed prepara
tions to sally to-morrow on the work of
the "enemy."
The first detachment, numbering about
400, arrived early in the morning and the
remaining trains followed during the day
and evening. Leaving the ferry-boat, the
crusaders boarded special cars which were
in waiting and proceeded direct to the
garden to the music of their bands and
the singing' of hymns.
The general overseer himself, accom
panied by his family and staff, arrived in
his special train at the Grand Central
station, where, owing to a misunder
standing^ his private carriage failed to
meet him and he was compelled to go to
the Plaza Hotel in a hack. During the
confusion of leaving the train a thief
slipped into Mrs. Dowle's reception room
In the. car and stole a $1500 diamond and
pearl brooch.
From the Plaza Dowie went to the gar
den, -where 'he restored order out of the
general -confusion that prevailed and out
lined his plans in an interview with the
newspaper men. He denied that he in
tended to raise a fund of $50,000,000 while
here and declined to say whether ha was
going to found another Zion City here. It
is intended to begin the house-to-house
visitations to-morrow and the first public
service will ,be held In the garden on
Sunday. " Â¦â¢>.,

It must be almost inconceivable, even to
mar-y people who have been to the equa
tor, that within the sweltering barbarism
of the tropics there are places where
there Is any quantity of ice and Bnow,
says J. E. S. Moore in Pearson's Maga
zine. Natural ice, moreover, and not the
dirty apology for j it which is manufac
tured, and regarded now as a necessity
by the white people who are gradually
crowding Into the languid warmth peren
nially filling the equatorial portions of the
earth. Right on the equator there is
both ice and snow covering wide districts,
where, as In an English January mid-,
night, "the air bites shrewdly and it is
very cold."
As a matter of fact, If we look at a
spherical map of the earth, or a g!obe,
the line where snow lies perpetually rises
in a great curve, which begins at the sea
level within the Arctic circle and rises
and rises over the equator to a height of
between 13,000 and 14,000 feet. In the Brit
ish -Isles this line passes but a 4 few hun
dred feet above the tops -of trie Scotch
mountains, and it strikes the Alps about
7000 feet above the sea. The Alps and the
Caucasus,' the Pyrennees and the Hima
layas and the desolate Arctic wastes are
always covered with Ice and snow above
certain heights and above certain lati
tudes; but in all these extra-tropical re
gions the snow and the ice 1 shrink and ex
pand as the seasqns wax and' wane, the
snow of the Arctic extending during the
winters over wide areas in temperate
regions, "while from the high mountains
the "snow fields Invade j the deep forests
and the cultivated areas Jn the valleys
every time the winter sets in. The occa
sional oscillation of the snow lines on the
mountains, .and in the winter spreading
over the Arctic snows and ice, have each
of them far-reaching-effects upon the veg
etation of temperate climates, which af
fect the forests as well as the flowers
that grow under them, for they are both
covered up with snow, or frozen out, for
many months In the year. '. Â¦

"It was understood all along that this
masquerade was to be for 'the women
students exclusively," said Miss Talullah
Le Conte, chairman of the arrangements
committee. , "It wouldn't do to let the
men in and we did our best to keep them
out. I am glad we succeeded."
The committee of inspection for the af
fair consisted of Miss Le Conte, Miss
Bertine Wollenberg. Miss Agnes Peter
son and MIsÂ« Lura Bonestell.
It was all because the girls had said
men shouldn't come that they took steps
so the men couldn't come. Everybody
who knocked for admission had to pass
the scrutiny of a committee whose duty
It was to pick out the menâ if any dared
to come in disguise. Everybody had to
show first their card signed and counter
signed. Then they had to stick out their
feet to show that \ the shoes on them
were not men's size. Then they had to
exhibit their hands to- see if they, would
fit a No. 5 glove.
Their hair was inspected to determine
whether it was genuine or merely stuck
on, and lastly, their faces were looked at
for any Bign of a mustache or beard. If
the candidate succeeded in passing this
rigid examination it was pretty certain
it was a girl. .Even with all these pre
cautions, however, one or two bachelors
came near getting through. But their
thin disguise was penetrated in time for
one of the committee to call the Janitor,
who promptly bounced the intruders out
of doors.
There were no men among the gay
crowd of dancers at the masquerade for
the benefit of the Co-ed Boating Associa
tion this evening in Hearst Hail. There
were any number of pretty girls and
bachelor maids there, but the genus man
was absolutely prohibited by edict and
force of arms. . . *"

ary Injunction tying the hands of the
board, and. while an appeal can be taken,
the board Is free to act in the meantime.
Most of the members were In favor of
taking the question up and disposing of
it at once. Some wanted to hold a spe
cial meeting on Sunday, but to this Pres
ident Forderer objected and the Monday
morning meeting was the result. There
is no question that the franchises will be
granted on Monday. .
ALAMEDA, Oct. 16.â It 13 expeoted that
the two franchises asked for by the
Southern Pacific, Railway, which, have
been hung up in the courts for the last
six weeks, will in all probability ba grant
ed next Monday morning.
There was a meeting of the committee
of the whole this evening. City, Attorney
M. W. Blmpeon could not bÂ© located and
it was finally determined to put the mat
ter over. A meeting was arranged for 8
o'clock* on Monday morning, when It Is
expected the vexed question will be set
tled.
The accused destists claim they do not
understand why they should be called
into court upon a criminal charge, but
they admit that it is probably because of
some technical infraction of the law cov
ering the practice of dentistry in the
State. The new law makes certain re
quirements ' of dental . practitioners with
regard to license fees and examinations,
and it is j evident that the State Dental
Examiners have decided that they will
test the new law In Oakland before they
go elsewhere.
No members of the State Board of Den
tal Examiners could be found in Oakland,
and the dentists say they know not why
they have been arrested.
The warrants were Issued without no
tice and it was through the kindness of
the police officials that some of the v pro
fessional men involved were not placed in
an embarrassing position.
The warrants upon which the dentists
were arrested, and on which more will be
arrested to-morrow, were sworn to by C.
C. Hamilton before Justice of the Peace
George Samuels and were placed in the
hands of the police for service, without
explanation.
The general practice of the city is be
fore Justice of the Peace Smith, who
ranks as Police Judge, and why Mr.
Hamilton went before Justice Samuels is
something that the arrested do not un
derstand.
The State Board of Dental Examiners
to-day began an attack upon the dentists
of Oakland who have not complied with
the new State law covering the practice
of that profession. Half a dozen arrests
were made to-night and there are many
more warrants out that will 'be served
upon some of the most reputable of the
practitioner* of the city to-morrow. Those
arrested to-night were P. A. Marriott, S.
C. Harnef, J. F. McMath.C. E. Lancas
ter, Edward Conn and G. N. Heln. All of
them gave bonds for their appearance
and will have to appear in the Police
Court to-morrow morning. .

Late this afternoon George C. â¢ Cole
man of the California Hotel and J. S.
Smith of the Ramona House called at
the Morgue, but were unable to state
positively whether they had ever seen the
deceased before. Both agreed, however,
that the body resembled . in > a general
way a man named William Smiley,
who had occupied rooms at both the
places named within the last few weeks*
Smiley, however, was seen last Saturday
and from the appearance of the body it
must have been in the water a much
longer time than the six days that have
elapsed since then.
Careful examination of the skull shows
no Indication' of a blow having been
struck. The hair was entirely gone and
the face past all recognition. Had the
man cut his own throat it is inconceiva-.
ble how he could have weighted the body
in themanner in which it was found and
then found his way into the water. There
is nothing in the appearance of the body
to indicate that robbery could have been
the motive that prompted,, murder. The
police are still in hopes "that the body
will be identified and the mystery in some
way cleared up.
The Newland House, Old Kentucky,
Tobrlner'a drug store, Ramona House and
the St. Louis saloon were some , of the
places visited, but if he was known at
any of the piaces mentioned the detec
tives failed to establish the fact. â¢
The body waa dressed in a suit of dark
material and the shoes were nearly new.
In the pockets were found some tobacco,
a knife, matches, pipe and a memoran
dum book containing addresses. The last
is really the only clew that the police
have to work on. In the book there are
several addresses of lodging-houses, and
with the idea that he might possibly have
stopped at some of them detectives made
inquiries along this* line. '.

an ugly gash in the throat that leads to
the belief that a foul deed has been com

that it is impossible, to reach an opinion
as to the cause of death.
The body was found by three boys-^-Joe

Saa. Jose-â 45 East Santa GLuÂ» Str*** -A number of New Yorkers have re
ceived from Engjand in s the past week
what appears to be a written letter, al
though it la in reality a copy reproduced
by mechanical means. Inclosed with it is
the visiting card of an English Baron.
The nobleman writes .cordially to the
New Yorkers receiving his letter, sug
gesting that they join him in a cruise to
the East on one of the large trans-Atlan
tic liners which "a steamship company is
to fit out especially for the purpose. This
trip has been organized, he writes, In con
nection with "the parliamentary visit to
Canada arranged by: Mr. , M.
P., In; the House of Commons and by me
in !the House of Lords."
The details of this journey, which doas
not differ from the excursion parties fre
quently organized nowadays, are recited
in the letter and the price of the tickets
is given. To this "circular Is appended an
imitation of his lordship's autograph after
the phrase, "Yours faithfully."
New, Yorkers have heard of the way In
which some members of the English aris
tocracy use "their titles for. advertising
any enterprise that pays them, but no ex
ample of the system so striking as the
present one has been seen here. The no
bleman who sent his card so freely to this
country did not mention one thing that
would : explain \ the use"*of a noble Baron's
name In connection . with an excursion to
the'Orieht. That is that he is a regular
employe of the company organizing the
trip. / ..: v . .â¢ ;,

meetings by other candidates of the
party.
At the Potrero Opera-houso Mayor
Schmitz addressed a large number of
men and he was given a warm welcome.
The Mayor designated the campaigning
of his opponents as. "dirty work" and
claimed that not a single vote would be
lost to him on account of the statements
made arainst him.
The Mavor said that Lane's candidacy
for election was simply a ruse to draw
sufficient votes from the Labor Darty so
as to insure the election of Henry J.
Crocker. The Mayor repeated the gist of
his former speeches by declaring . that
San Francisco had flourished despite the
election of a Labor Mayor an.l that If
he was again given office he would have
time to carry out long -cherished plans.
Just what the plans were Schmitz did not
state. .Â¦Â¦Â» . ' " .
Mayor Schmitz's speech at Mascot Hall
was mainly devoted to the, manner .In
which the 1 street car strike was settled.
He declared that the police were to pro
tect life and property and not to be used
for the benefit of any particular class of
citizens, rich or poor. The Mayor In
sisted . that his record in the past two
years was a creditable one and that San
Francisco had prospered on account of
his regime. He said that ne did not be
lieve in strikes as they were injurious
to all parties and won applause by de
claring he was the friend of the work

for I heard a man who seemed to know
all the candidates give Bierman the order.
This policeman Is a disgrace to the police
force and he committed an assault on
citizens and technically placed us under

more of Schmitz's meetings if this sort
of thing is to be allowed."
Judge Bahrs took another fall out of
Dr. Washington Dodge. He electrified his
auditors by the strenuous way he cam
paigns. His speech was t full of fire and
he was enthusiastically '/fheercd at its
conclusion. Judge Bahrs fatyertainly mak

were superior in every way to those on
the opposing tickets, but because the Re

to recognize so largely the German ele

city, than whom no better element exists.
Enthusiastic mention was made of the
candidacy of ex-Judge George H. Bahrs,
who is a strong factor' among the Ger
man element of the city.
rasHAT the Forty-flrtt Assembly Dis
trict is for Henry J. Crocket for
Mayor is a certainty. The residents
of that thickly populated district
favor his candidacy. This was evi
denced by the outpouring of citizens
at the meeting held in Stelmke Hall last
r.Ight. The hall was too small to hold
:he gathering. More than 200 stood for
two hours In tho cloeely packed place and
listened to the addresses made by thÂ©
standard bearer and other candidates on
the Republican ticket. A great deal of en
thusiasm was displayed throughout the
meeting. Mr. Crocker's reception was
all that his most earnest admirer could
wish. From the time he entered the
densely packed hall until his departure
for othtr meetings he eras given a most
enthusiastic reception.
Mr. Crocker's address to the voters of
his home district was to the point and
Â¦won him lots of applause. He was talk
ing to his neighbors and he did not mince
Tvords. He told them of his hopes and
ambitions and of his desire to be elected
Mayor of the city In order that he might
Kive them a cleaner and better govern
ment. Speeches were also delivered by
Fairfax WheÂ»lan. Judge George H.
Bahrs, Fred Eggers. Ted Lunfistedt. Wil
liam E. Lutz and a score- of others.
There was special muFlc by an orchestra
and sir.ping by vr>lunteers. The meeting
was In every way a success and the lead
ers in the district are certain that Mr.
("rocker will carry it by a handsome ma
jnrity. despite the fact that it Is the home
district of Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz and
Franklin K. Lane.
William J. Dutton presided at thÂ© meet
ing. In the course of his opening address
he dwelt on Henry J. Crocker's fitness
to b<? Mayor of this city. He spoke at
length and impressed his auditors with
the wisdom of his remarks. Maxwell Mc-
Nutt. candidate for Supervisor, said that
there would be no star chamber proceed
ings at the City Hall after the Sd of
November, as the Republican party did
not believe In that way of transacting
business. J. S. Partridge, chairman of
the late Republican municipal convention,
was called upon for a speech and spoke
in his usual forceful manner In part

perhaps, in finding some one. whoee career M

But after being there two months my father
came from the city, looked around and called
iiv aside and said: "What does It ccst you to
live up here?" I answered, "My room rent is
SI." a month, my board is about ?23 a month
and my washing !s about $i a month," and he
raid. '.Vow. we are going to give you a salary
of $t0 a month, and this will be surely more
than I received at your age." I naturally
came out In debt at the end of every month.
(Laughter.) I kept soing, however. I never
missed a day's work In my life. I have never
lx-Â«-n cut of eniDloyment and never left one
place until I was sure of another. I have kept
this up all these yeers. I have gone into
business and urged my way as best I could,
and If I have been successful It Is because I
have the indomitable will and desire to suc
ceed.
It U not a very long history, because I am
a younr man yet, but I have succeeded to a
certain extent, enough, surely, to show that If
this ciiy fsivc* me a chance to rise I can cer
tainly turn aside for a few years. If elected
Mayor of San Francisco I can close my de*k
ar.d write en It, "So business transacted lor
the next two years." go to the City Hall and

commissioners, handle city business and en

but at this time and under the circumstances
that now Drevail I believe that the man who
will attend to the welfare of Snn Francisco Is
a business man; a. man who understands busi

who has proven his merit In the commercial
world: a. man who knows how a merchant
prides himself on the reputation of hi? house

rjomlnetrd such a man. He Is first on my lips,
his name Is flirt on our ticket and he will be

Theodore L.undsUÂ»dt, candidate for Su
pervisor, made a good impression by the
manly way he spoke to the voters of the
district. Fred Epgers had many friends
In the hall and when he was introduced
he was given a big reception. Eggers told
what ho had done for the residents of the
Forty-first District and aroused lots of
enthusiasm.
Chairman Dutton introduced Mr. Crock
er in a fitting speech and the friends of
the candidate made the hall echo with
their shouts. He spoke as follows:
My efforts will seem poor, no doubt, after
listening to the orators and business men who
have preceded me, but I can certainly say
from the. bottom of my heart that I thank
the men of the Forty-first District for the
honor they have conferred upon me by conains:

Two years ago I had the henor to be aakea
to take hold of this work and It was impossible
for me to do so. Thinking the matter over
and having It aeatij tendered to me I saw
my way clear to put what little effort I could
Into this campaign. If elected I will endeavor
to give an administration that would Justify

PROVEN HIS MERIT.

would <io better than any one else. The ap

Francisco shall permit this man of music to,
go bark to the Mayor's chair they will find
the symphony to be one of sharps and flats,
and the sharps will be Mr. Ruef and Mr.
Schmitz and the flats will be the voters. (Ap
plause.)
This ie said to be a business campaign and
we are in the midst of a three-cornered fight.
Three sets of candidates seek our suffrage, but
the situation Is not as complicated as It looks.
ThÂ«-re are three parties, three candidates and
three tickets but there Is one issue, one su
preme istu<!â the welfare of this city and county
of San Francisco. Our city administration af
fects our homes more than it does our parties.

BATTLE ENDS IN FAVOR
OF ALPERS AND EGGERS
Supreme Court Decides Aguinst Con
testants for Seats in Board of
Supervisors.
Supervisors Alpers and Eggers are en
titled to hold their positions, according to
a Supreme Court decision rendered yes
terday.. Coghlan and Walsh have lost
their contests for membership in the
board. This is the end of the long and
sensational legal battle resulting from the
last municipal election.
When the result of thÂ© vote was an
nounced two years ago fifteen disappoint
ed candidates brought suit to unseat their
successful rivals. In the trial court Alp
ers and Eggers were counted out. Eleven
contestants became disheartened and
dropped their contests. . Alpers, Eggers,
Bent and Wilson argued that the ballots
of the original contestants and con
testees should still be counted, as tUe
fifteen suits had been consolidated. The
lower court ruled against the Incumbents.
The Supreme Court says that while a
contestant may have been given moro
votes than an Incumbent, it does not fol
low that both may not have been num
bered with the highest eighteen candi
dates. The trial court is declared to have
erred in ruling against Alpers. Eggers et

HENRY J. CROCKER is far ahead of
his " competitors in the race for
Mayor of San Francisco. Demo
crats are about ready to relinquish
the task of deceiving themselves in
regard to Lane's chances of success.
It Is universally admitted by all. who have
given the political situation close study
that the contest is between Crocker and
Schmitz. Ruef is doing everything in his
power to boom the candidacy of Schmitz.
Keane, out at the Mayor's office, is work
ing overtime for Schmitz's re-election,
but neither Ruef nor Keane can excite
popular enthusiasm for their candidate.
Sam Rainey and the Fire Department are
also standing in for Schmitz and pulling
the wires to bring the police force Into
the Ruef corral.
Martin Kelly Is doing what he can for
Lane and McNab. The fact i3 recalled
that the Democratic newspapers four
years aso hired detectives to shadow
Horace Davis, then the Republican nom
inee for Mayor. Mr. Davis kept an en
gagement made for him by a member of
the campaign committee, to meet Kelly.
The incident was magnified into a sensa
tion by the Democratic press. Mr. Davis'
admission that he spoke to Kelly was
called a confession. Citizens were- asked
to withhold their support from Mr. Da
vis on the ground. that he was tinctured
with bossism. The same Democratic press
13 now serenely supporting Lane with full
and ample knowledge that Kelly is be
hind McNab's candidate for Mayor.
The threats uttered by Mayor Schmitz
to hold Lane personally responsible for
the circulation of scurrilous cartoons do
rot signify that McNab's man and Ruef's
man will meet in rough and tumble per
sonal encounter. After Mr. Crocker's
election Schmitz, through his attorney,
Ruef, may bring suit for damages against
Lane and the latter through his attor
ney, McNab, may bring counter suit, but
all good citizens express the hope that
nothing like a sanguinary encounter will
ensue.
PARRY AND THE COLT.
Parry Is said to have waxed warm over
Lane's allusion to the Trojan horse, hold
ing that the equine reference was made to
call public attention to the Fire Depart
ment colt. The followers of Lane accuse
the Schmitz-Ruef regime of corruption In
office and the Schmitz supporters charge
Lane with inefficiency and neglect of pub
lic duty. To the taxpayers it seems like.
Six of one and half a dozen of the other.
Schmitz appoints to responsible positions
such specimens as Mershon and I*arry
and then hiesjiimself away t<j New York
to make Democratic speeches. Ruef
practically dictates all the official ap
pointments. The taxpayers have resolved
to oust the whole crowd and elect men to
office who will give attention to public
duty and do something toward the better
ment of San Francisco. All signs point
to a remarkably large vote for Mr.
Crocker. Republicans exclaim: "This
time I will vote the Republican ticket
straight."
Every hour of the day the Republican
nominee for Mayor receives from work
fngmen assurance of their support. This
assurance is gratifying in the extreme,
because Schmltz opened the campaign by
appropriating to himself the entire labor
vote of the city. Lane came next and
asked for the same support on the
ground, presumably, that he needed it.
The workingmen themselves intend to
vote forÂ»the party of progress and pros
perity. Leading men in the various unions
frankly proclaim their Intention to vote
for Henry J. Crocker.
CROCKER BUTTONS.
A good Indication of the feeling enter
tained by the laboring men toward Henry
J. Crocker may be obtained from the fact
that a number of carmen in uniform have

A SHORT distance ' east of the California State
line lies the growing city of Reno, whose hori
zon is rosy with the dawn of a day of greater
prosperity than it has ever known. One sympton of
its awakening is an earnest discussion of its public
needs. President Stubbs of the University of Ne
vada, L. II. Taylor, the State hydographer, and
other leading citizens took part in a public discus
sion of this topic recently at a meeting called by the
Reno Chamber of Commerce. Much that was said
on that occasion, as reported by the Reno Evening
Gazette, is of interest to the outsider who looks
with sympathetic gaze on the promotion of Nevada.
Particular importance will be attached to the rep
resentations made by the State hydographer. Under
the irrigation system devised for the betterment of
the arid lands of Nevada, he said, . 375,000 acres of
land will be cut up into small holdings. That area
will easily support 20,000 families. These families
will be able, in turn, to support 20,000 to 25,000 more
in the villages and towns.
The irrigation work on hand includes the building
of a canal thirty-one miles long, from the Truckee
River to the sink of the Carson in Churchill County.
A reservoir will be constructed about the. Carson
sink, embracing an area of more than 8000 acres,
which, when full, will have a maximum depth of.no*
feet. It is further proposed to store "the waters, of
the Truckee River in six or seven reservoirs. The
work that has been begun carries an expenditure of
$900,060. , /

The British statesmen who, in preferential tariffs
and the incidental taxing of foods to English con
sumers, are seeking to cement a gigantic commercial
union with the colonies, out of which will rise a
Greater Britain, should riot forget that a tax on a
glass of beer once cost a powerful Ministry its power
and a great party its life.
ATTENTION is called by the Redding Search
light to the fact that in Shasta County, as dis
closed by the County Assessor's books, there
are 10,316 goats. That number is half as many as
the sheep in the county. The sheep, to be exact,
count up 20,595. "Goats â¢ arc gaining on sheep in
number." says the Searchlight, "the ratio between the
two varieties of stock favoring goats."
Several considerations are urged in justification
for giving the goats the preference in Shasta County.
It is said that goats are more easily cared for than
sheep and will live and thrive where the sheep can
eke out but a bare existence. Goat raisers who have
taken pains to get good stock claim that they can
make more money and easier money than if they had
invested the same amount in cattle and sheep.
Therefore the goat-raising industry is steadily grow
ing, particularly in the mountainous districts.
To encourage the goat raisers the Searchlight
makes a digest of the various official recommenda
tions and gathers facts bearing on the commercial
side of the consideration. Secretary Wilson, it is
pointed out, has frequently, suggested the expediency
of raising goats. The imports of goat skirls into the
United States represent . annually the tidy sum of
$25,000,000. This might just as well be earned at
home, so reasons the Searchlight.
Importers are ransacking the four corners of the
earth to get goat skins for manufactures. They arc
brought in from India, .China, Arabia and Russia.
The skins arc turned into shoes largely. In 1000 there
were only 2,000,000 goats in the United States. At
least 20,000,000 foreign grown goats were required
to supply the $25,000,000 worth of goat skins last year
imported into this country. *â¢
The increasing imports reveal the growing demand
for goat skins. In 1885 the total value of the import
was but $4,000,000. In 1890 it had grown to $9,006,
000. By 1898 it was $15,000,000. In 1900 the total
was $22,000,000 and in 1903 in round numbers $25,
000,000. In other words m thirteen years the impor
tation has been nearly trebled.
For years the goat has been the sport of the comic
writers for the press. That valorous and combative
animal has been pictured as subsisting principally
upon a diet of discarded tomato cans and deriving
therefrom sufficient nutriment to keep its spirit always
up to the fighting point. Divested of the humorous
view the goat appears endowed with many quali
ties such as make it commercially valuable. Its food
need: cost little. Its hardihood enables it to seek
pasturage tin places inaccessible to other â¢ animals.
Shasta's goat raising for profit will-attract the atten
tion of the people of California, who will watch the
statistics supplied by the Assessors' books, from year,
to year as a barometer telling how the industry, fares.

SANTA CLARA. Oct. 16.-In 1SD5 an
eight-inch equatorial was presented
to Santa Clara College by John B.
McNamara in the name of Peter J.
Donahue. Through lack of funds to erect
a suitable covering for the instrument it
remained unused till late in the year 1900,
when it was placed under a movable
house in an open space about 400 feet
south of the quadrangle. Another smaller
glass (four-inch) still remains unused. The
glass of the eight-inch equatorial is by
the elder Clarke, who looked upon it as
one of his best finished products. The
equatorial mounting is by Fauth & Co. of
Washington. D. C, and is very graceful
in style, doing away with the old clumsy
brick pier. It Is supplied with an elec
trical system, by means of which diminu
tive incandescent lamps^ throw subdued
light on the verniers of the declination
and hour circles, the cross wires of the
transit eye piece and the reticule of the
position micrometer. Part of the same
system enables the astronomer to estab
lish . synchronism between the driving
clock and the sidereal clock.
Dr. John Montgomery supervised the
work of setting the telescope in the
meridian and elevating its polar axis to
the altitude of the pole. These adjust
ments have been astronomically verified
by Father Jerome Rlcard, now in charge
of the observatory.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
PERSONAL MENTION.
It is necessary that these matters be discussed
without prejudice and uninfluenced by any feeling
justifiable or otherwise against the present owners of
the water supply. It is a law in the psychology of
public action that when influenced by prejudice and
not reason it is sure to result in economic loss.
Neither Oakland nor San Francisco wishes loss to
follow a change in the method and ownership of their
water supply and their people will cast out prejudice
and resort to reason when called to consider such
Another clement in the problem must be discussed.
The advocates of public ownership continually point
to the success as they sec it of municipal trading in
Great Britain. When the British advocates of that
system are consulted they cite the first element nec
essary to success to be the acquisition of all private
and competing plants. The law of England under
which municipal trading is carried on requires this,
and so all private plants are appraised, paid for and
taken over into public ownership and there is no com
petition. This is also the law of Massachusetts. Such
a law is in accordance with a principle regarded as
the foundation of public ownership. In discussing it
the reason for it will appear in such clear detail as to
leave no doubt of the propriefy and necessity of the
legal requirements enforced in Great Britain and
Massachusetts.
ONE of the organs in this city which gave its
influence to make the Geary-street Railroad
bonds a lien upon the whole city and a bur
den on the taxpayers takes up the question of the
public ownership of water supply in San Francisco
and Oakland. After saying that the water now sup
plied to the two cities is of such a character that it is
killing the people who use it and will ultimately de
populate both towns the organ proceeds to advise
that they join and bring a water supply for both from
Lake Tahoe. of course for that purpose burdening all
the taxpayers .vhether they use the water or not.
Now we object first to such a statement about the
physical character of the water supply of these two
cities. It is net true that the .water is non-potable
and dangerous to health. To say that it is depopu
iaiir.g the towns by killing the people who use it is
a very poor way to induce people to come here.
While it may gratify such as prefer to take a virulent
rather than a business view of the water supply, it,
if generally circulated, will inflict irreparable injury
upon Oakland and San Francisco.
The public interest in the water runs to cost and not
character. The supplies, being from catchment
basins and not rivers, carry a certain element of
safety, since a river is much more exposed to pollu
tion than a catchment supply. In cholera epidemics
the most dangerous exposure is in the use' of river
water. So" the issue of cost only remains uncanccled.
To compare the cost of a supply under private owner
ship and public ownership the same inflexible busi
ness rule applies that was enforced by us in the case
of the Geary-street road. Keep business and politics
separate by basing water bonds on the plant they
create and pay them and support it out of the- income
â¢'erived from the rate payers who use the water. Of
course the cities will become rate payers for the sup
ply of public buildings, parks and fire extinguishing.
Those uses affect the whole people and all should
pHor them, and so far the city is a rate payer to its
water system just the same as a private individual.
If Oakland and San Francisco hope for cheaper
Aater they can get it under public ownership, or at
ieast can trj' to get it, only by doing business as busi

gence."
Of course that means the new Populism is to be
virtually a socialistic movement and the party will
therefore seek fusion with Socialists rather than with
Democrats. To what extent the combination will be
able to affect the struggle between the two old par
ties is at this time merely a matter of conjecture. The
strength of Socialism is in New' England, but it is
not at all likely that any defection it may cause from
the Republicans of that section will be sufficient to
give the Democrats a chance to carry a single New
England State. So the strength of the Populist
movement seems now to be in the South, but no one
imagines it will be strong enough there to endanger
the supremacy 01 the Democrats. The only prospects
therefore of the new movement having any practical
effect upon politics next year are to be looked for in
doubtful States like Illinois and Indiana. It is of
course very improbable that a big vote will be cast
for the new movement, but it is none the less start
ing out under circumstances that render it interestirfg.
Since the statement of Allen's committee there
have, however, been further declarations from former
Populist leaders^in different parts of the country, and
it would appear therefore as if a concerted movement
were under way to revive Populism in time to make it
a factor in the next Presidential election. One of the
most conspicuous of the advocates of the new move
ment i: Butler of North Carolina, who like Allen was
formerly a member of the United States Senate and
longs to return if he can. Butler declares that Popu
lism is stronger in the South than ever before and
that if the conservative Democrats carry the next
Presidential convention and nominate a gold candi
date for the Presidency the Bryanites of the South
will go over in large numbers to Populism and give
it a formidable strength in several of the Southern
States.
The most significant feature of the new movement
is the platform upon which it is designed to make the
coming fight. Instead of scattering over nearly the
whole field of current political issues and fads as for
mer Populist platforms did it is the intention of the
leaders of the movement to make the fight virtually
on a single issue. As Mr. Butler expressed it, the
dominant feature of the platform will -be a plank "in
favor of the national ownership of the means of carry
ing on commerce, the Government ownership of rail
roads and the facilities for the transmission of intelli-
WHEN a committee of Western Populists
leaded by William V. Allen of Nebraska an
nounced that the stalwarts of the party in
tended to again take the middle of the road and run
n candidate for the Presidency in 1904 the announce
ment was treated with but scant courtesy. It was in
fact looked upon as nothing more than an effort on
the part of a number oÂ£ discarded politicians to get
another hearing from the public and possibly a" chance
to make a bargain with Democracy in a few States
where fusion might result in at least a partial suc
cess.

The Dowieites, fierce of mouth and loud of pur
pose and armed with clamorous tongue, have left

The case was arbitrated at Washington long and
patiently and an award was given to the citizens of
the United States who had been robbed by Salvador.
That country throughout the trial practiced duplicity
and finally smuggled one of her attorneys into the
secret conferences of the court under pretense of
being interpreter for the Salvadorean arbitrator, an
act sufficient to cause a break in diplomatic relations
beUvcen the two countries. As soon as the award
was made the President of Salvador and her Foreign
Minister inspired the same sort of attacks upon the
umpire, Sir Henry Strong, and Hon. Don M. Dickin
son, the American arbitrator, as have been aimed at
the Spanish Minister in Caracas. Regardless of the
demands of official decency and national amity these
gentlemen were lampooned, cartooned, abused and
lied about by the Government only a small part of
whose* prey had been snatched from its rapacious
jaws by their righteous decision.
Fortunately the arbitration was held in Washing
ton. Had it been in Salvador the officers and agents
of that Government would have no doubt added phy
sical indignity and perhaps assassination to their
verbal, graphic and printed insults. The falsehoods
about the umpire and the American arbitrator and
the offensive cartcons were mailed to the Foreign
Offices of other governments under the seal of the
Foreign Minister of El Salvador, and as they have
been so exactly copied in the treatment of the Span
ish Minister to Caracas they no doubt inspired the
monkey of the Andes, Castro, in his treatment of
that gentleman. â¢
The arbitrators in the Salvador case were not
officers or representatives of the United States and
our Government could not notice anything that oc
curred after they became functus officio. The case of
the diplomatic representatives of Spain and Mexico to
Venezuela is different. The insults to them are af
fronts to their Governments and may be noticed in
such a way as to check the barbarism of Castro,
Unfortunately citizens of the United States are to
blame for much of this truculence of Venezuela. Min
ister Bowen has said things here and in Europe that
were unbecoming in a diplomat and untrue in fact,
and Hon. Wayne MacVeagh in his plea to the Hague
court went outside the professional limits to insult
the civilization of Europe and encourage the barbar
ism of Venezuela. Finally public opinion in this
country needs enlightenment by the press in regard
to what we call our "sister republics" in Latin-
America, which mostly arc absolute autocracies, ruled
by bandits strong enough to rob and murder their
way to power.
! VENEZUELA AND ARBITRATION.
I
G ASTRO, the bandit President of Venezuela,
entered into treaties of arbitration with the
countries whose nationals had been robbed
by his Government. Under these treaties mixed com
missions were provided and their members were
selected and agreed to by Castro and the other Gov
ernments concerned all in proper form. The arbi
trations proceeded, according to the terms of the sev
eral protocols, at Caracas, which was agreed upon as
the .location of the arbitration.
The first case to be concluded is that of the Mex
ican claims. In that case the Spanish Minister to
Venezuela was the chief arbitrator or umpire. After
patient examination the award of indemnity was
made in legal form. Immediately the officers of the
Venezuelan Government and the press, inspired by
Castro, broke out into the most infamous attacks
upon the Spanish Minister. He was accused of cor
ruption. Gross and libelous caricatures of him were
circulated. His personal safety was threatened and
he has found himself compelled to ask the interven
tion of his Government to protect him.
The representative of Mexico in Caracas has also
been attacked with scarcely â¢ less vigor and venom.
The award is repudiated by Castro, who agreed to
abide by it and treat it as final, and both Spain and
Mexico have been furnished a casus belli if they
choose to act upon it. It is to be hoped that Mexico
will accept the challenge, for she is not impeded nor
limited by the Monroe doctrine, and if she would
give Venezuela a good thrashing it would be a ser
vice to modern civilization.
Arbitration is a substitute for war. But it is a use
less device if nations which agree to it repudiate its
judgments. If there be no means of enforcement the
expense of international courts is useless. The pace
for Latin-America was set by the so-called republic
of El Salvador. â¢ In a case affecting the nationals of
the United States she demanded arbitration, which

company, so said Mr. Flanigan, is ready to contract
for the building of a reservoir that will be 220 feet
above the Washoe County Bank building and that
will hold 30,000,000 gallons of water. With such a
reservoir the insurance rates in Reno will be one

The Reno Gazette says that better streets were
also discussed. Dr. Stubbs predicted that Nevada
will be sought for homes. "It will soon be settled
with sturdy men and women and we will soon have
a population of 100,000 instead of 40,000 to 50.000.
One enthusiastic speaker described Reno as "the

ST. IGNATIUS GRADUATES .
TO PRODUCE "EVERYMAN"
Morality Play of Five Hundred
'Years Ago to Be Presented
This Month:
Considerable Interest Is being evinced In
the forthcoming production of the moral
ity play, "Everyman," by members of the
Gentlemen's Sodality of St. Ignatius Col
lege Hall on Wednesday and Thursday
evenings, October 28 and 29. Â»
The rehearsals have been carried on for
many weeks and no pains are being
spared to make the presentation of the
famous play a thorough success. The
majority of the amateurs that will-ap
pear in the play are graduates of St. Ig
natius and Santa Clara colleges and have
met with pronounced success in presen
tations of classical plays at their re
spective colleges.
Though "Everyman" was written 500
years ago by a Catholic priest of Hol
land and presented at that time, it was
only revived three years ago in England
and America. The English version was
written by Rev. Father Percy Fitzgerald
and it has met with remarkable success
in every city where it has been presented.
St. Ignatius College Hall Is admirably
adapted for the production and large
crowds probably will. witness the two per
formances. The price of tickets has been
fixed at 50 and 75 cents and tickets can
be secured at 214 Hayes street or from
members of the sodality or at the store of
Sherman, Clay & Co.
No Hope for Dimmick.

Quentin, where he . is now serving two
sentences for embezzlement of money
from the United States Mint and one of
larceny for stealing $30,000 from the same
institution. Mr. Collins was granted leave
to appeal to the United States Supreme
Court on depositing a bond of $500 to cov

County, Oregon:
The Waratah Minerals Company, a depart

Philadelphia, Pa., Is preparing to put in a
platinum mining plant .at the Old Channel
mine* on Gallce Creek, near Grants Pass, gaya
J. It. Harvey, manager of the Old Channel
mlnps. \v F. Smith, manager of the Waratah
Minerals Company, has begun putting In the
machinery. These placers will hereafter be
operated under lease by J. R. Harvey and will
be known as the Royal Group mines. Plati
num occurs in these placers both free and with
rhodium. ot?mium. iridium and palladium. The
saving of the platinum concentrates does not
interfere with the gold mining operations. The
sands and concentrates are drawn- from the
ululce boxes through a half-Inch grlsszly. then
spread out over a broad riffle table to - catch
the Hour gold, and later drawn through e
one-eighth-inch screen and spread over cocoa
mat riffles, where the concentrates settle and
are gathered up. This system of undercur
rents and riffles is so arranged that a part of
them can be cleaned every day during- the
mining season.. The concentrates ;, are finally
muled and run over a concentrating table.
PLATINUM ENTERPRISE.
CONSOLIDATES PROPERTIES.
A large consolidation of oil properties
has been effected in Los Angeles County.
The holdings are those of the Puente Oil
Company and the Columbia Oil Produc
ing Company. The Mining and Scientific
Press gives the following details:
The consolidation Includes 4700 acres of oil
lands, the Puente company's oil refinery at
Chino, with rennlng capacity of 800 barrels
daily; fifteen miles of three-Inch pipe line from
the wells at Puente to Chino; eighty-five pro
ducing wells, six pumping plants, ten drilling
outfits and steel tanks of 100,000 barrels ca
pacity. The present output of light oil from
thin district is estimated at 20,000 barrels pt-r
month. The oil produced by the. lands of this
combine U of 32-14 degrees Baume specific
gravity. The consolidated company- will be the
Puente Oil Company, with W. n. Rowland
president and W. B. Scott vice president and
general field superintendent. The Columbia
company retains its heavy grade oil territory
on which It has nine wells, producing 4000 bar
rels per month. The new company will in
crease its capacity, both In the field and at
the Chino refinery-
The Petticoat Consolidated mining prop
erties, adjoining the town of Railroad
Flat, consisting of ten locations, have
been bonded to J. L. Green. The Grass
Valley Tidings says:
J. 8. Goodwin of You Bet has a force of men
at work blasting out the falls on Greenhorn
Creek half a mile below the bridge on the
Graes' Valley road. This will put the bed of
the creek above that point In shape for exten.
elve dredging operations that are t& be inau
gurated next season. There are miles of land
along this stream that it Is thought will pay
large returns for dredging, and It is expected
that within another year or two this branch
Of the industry will be vigorously prosecuted
in that part of the county.-
The Manila Bulletin says that although
several islands In the Philippine group are
supposed to have extensive mineral de
posits, the lack of transportation facili
ties, the heat and the tropical vegetation,
which usually covers and to a large ex
tent conceals the rock formations, have
restricted systematic .development up to
this time. It says: Â¦}'{}* _;>.
There have been found In Benguet and Le
panto small bodies of rich gold ore. but the
veins are narrow and Irregular. Quantities of
low grade free milling ores have been found,
but they are for the most part In the Interior,
and their successful development Involves con
siderable outlay in building roads and putting
in machinery.
The old Empire mine, at Gold Valley,
Sierra County, is again being operated.
The electric power and compressed air
plants are in operation and development
work is being rapidly performed. Twenty
five stamps will probably be dropping be
fore next spring.
A mill of fifty tons daily capacity is be
ing erected at the Murchie mines, at Ne
vada City.
For the second time the tailings of the
Taylor mine, in El Dorado County, will
be put through the cyanide process. The
significance of this fact is that It points
out how modern mining men are discern
ing ways to make money out of that
which has been hitherto discarded as be
ing of little value.
A. E. Sa.nderson has leased the Gold
Flint mine, in the Randsburg district, for
one year on the basis of 10 per cent roy
alty. \
The Sacramento Dredging Company has
completed a flume and put In a water
wheel on the east side of the American
River near Colfax to supply the water to
wash out gold.
Two dredgers costing $100,000 each will
be placed on the Yuba River near Oro
ville.
In order to get supplies into camp promptly
a bridge was built over the Middle Tuba IMver.
The cost bt the structure was partly paid by
t=ierra County and In consequence It Is a pub
lic highway. The mine is being opened up by
means of a tunnel, which is being run into the
hill tn tap the old shaft sunk to the gravel.
On account of the scarcity of water as good
progress was not made as was hoped for, but
notwithstanding this obstacle the tunnel was
driven a distance of about fifty feet during the
last two months. Some good pay dirt was
taken out and the indications generally were
favorable. It Is the Intention of the company
to work the ground by the hydraulic pn-cess,
under euch restrictions as the law may im
pose. Application has been made to the debris
commission for a permit to build a restraining
dam. and in the event that It is granted the
company will be in a position to commence hy
firaulicklng next season.
According to the Grass Valley Union
the work of opening up the properties of
the Middle Yuba Mining Company In Ne
vada and Sierra counties is proceeding.
The Union says:
OPENING UP MINES.
The twelfth annual convention of the
California Miners' Association will j be
held In this city next month. Probably
tba dates will be November 16, 17 and 13.
The executive committee of the associa
tion will meet October 19 to determine
the tlmu for holding 1 the convention and
will also arrangp various preliminary
matters connected with the convention.
Many papers on technical subjects and
others of more general Interest have been
promised by men prominent in the mining
industry.. '
Among the themes will be gold dredg
ing by W. P. Hammond, common char
acteristics of the east belt of the mother
lode by w. H. McClintock, modern meth
ods In smelting and treating sulphides
by Frank A. Leach, concentration of ores
by Mark B. Kerr, the labor problem and
the miners by W. C. Ralston and gen
eral minln* interest* of the coast by
Charles G. Yale. Other topics as yet un
iissiffned that may be discussed are as
follows: Underground transportation of
ore, general milling practices, methods of
opening and handling wide veins in swell
ing ground, use of xirude oil in chlorina
tion. treatment of coarse crushed ore by
cyanide, relative value of > transmitted
power and power produced by crude oil,
dry concentration, modern methods in
quicksilver reduction, copper smelting,
river bar mining, modern stampmlll con
struction, comparative cost of crushing
with stamps or rolls and the treatment of
sulphides by cyanide.
The convention will undoubtedly reaf
firm its desire to have established a na
tional department of mines and mining.

. Colonel W. E. Edward?,- a stock broker
and clubman and a prominent member
of several leading fraternal organizations;
received a scoring, at the hands of Judge
Hunt yesterday that had the effect of
causing him to pay to his former wife, Te
resa Edwards. $40 of the alimpny he owes
her. He paid the money over to her in
the courtroom, but not until Judge Hunt
had refused to continue the order to show
cause on which he was haled into court
and had told him that he should see to
it that Mrs. Edwards, who Is an invalid,
was properly cared for.
The divorce suit of Andreas Hansen
against Ella Hansen was heard by Judge
Graham and taken under submission.
Hansen, who Is the captain of the steam
er Grace Barton, which plies between
here and Vallejo. testified that his wife
spent all the money he gave her for
liquor and for meat for seven dogs. The
captain said the dogs ranged in size from
a fox terrier to a Riant Eskimo. Mrs.
Hansen Indignantly denied the mariner's
charges, and as she passed him on leav
ing the witness stand very forcily told
him "he would have a pretty tough old
row to hoe before she got through with
him." - â¢
But little more than a year ago Isabel
Hi Shelley was a, happy bride. The bonds
that united her to Harry J. Shelley prom
ised to prove anything but Irksome. . All
went well for . a time, but recently, ac
cording to a complaint she has filed, her
once loving husband has been treating
her cruelly, and she wants the ties sev
ered.
She alleges that she is now ill In mind
and body because a short time ago Shelley
shook his fist in her face and spoke to
her in a threatening manner. This oc
curred several times, she says, and on
one occasion in the presence of Miss Ida
Williams, thereby completing her humil
iation.
She avers that her husband is 'Capable
of earning a large salary and informs the
court that she should be allowed 575 a
month alimony and counsel fees.
Delia Fessler wants a divorce because
she says her husband, Daniel, thinks more
of his reputation as a sportsman than
of a record for domesticity. She says he
owns many guns, and when he is not at
home abusing her he Is in a saloon at
the comer of Lombard and Green streets
declaiming on his ability as a crack shot.
Mrs. Fessler mentions this particular sa
loon because she says its walls are dec
orated with a picture of her sporting
spouse.
August M. Bartz is seeking a divorce
L. W. J. Bartz for desertion.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce for de
sertion were granted Lucinda Harring
ton fromW. A. Harrington and Gardiner
G. Howland from Mabel Rowland.
Jane S. Mills, who was married to Law
rence A. Mills at Oakland in March, 1900.
in a complaint for divorce filed by her
yesterday claims that up to February of
this year, when she left her husband, she
was a much abused wife. She says that
he has used the vilest and most disgust
ing language to her in -the presence of
her child and others. She. says that not
only did he abuse her shamefully but he
visited several large stores where she
dealt and Instructed the proprietors to
refuse her credit. She also charges, that
he would frequently take her to a thea
ter, send her home alone at midnight and
remain downtown carousing, returning
home in the morning, drunk and abusive.
Mrs. Mills also fears that her husband
will carry out his frequently made th'reats
to do her bodily harm, because she says
he is addicted to the excessive use of
intoxicants.
The committee is now in correspondence
with several organizations regarding con
ventions to be held in this city. The meet-
Ing of the United States Weather Bureau
officials will In all probability be held here
In 1904. The men in charge of the Weath
er Bureau have signified their intention of
coming here and no efforts will be spared
to have them meet in San Francisco.
The National Buttermakers will also
likely meet here in 1905. They will gather
next year in St. Louis and some of the
officials have already written the Promo
tion Committee regarding convening in
San Francisco the following year.
Through the efforts of the Promotion
Committee the Modern Workmen of
America will gather in this city in 1905.
The committee has also secured the con
clave of the Knights Templar for this city
next year.
The low rates offered by the various
yailroad companies to California were in
strumental in bringing 3&54 settlers to the
State up to October 7. Large investments
: have been made by many of these per
sons, the capital being put into dairy
farms and fruit ranches principally.
The coming visit of the American Bank
ers' Association promises much for the
State. Many of the prominent members
of the association have not yet visited
the State and the Promotion Committee
is making efforts to interest them in vari
ous enterprises.
MANY VISITORS ARRIVE.
A special meeting of the Advisory Board
of the Promotion Committee was ordered
called for an early day in November.
Many important topics will be discussed.
The Advisory Board will consist of Gov
ernor Pardee and one representative from
each of the following organizations: Sac
ramento Valley Development Association,
State Board of Trade, San Joaquin Valley
Commercial Association, California Cen
tral Coast Counties' Improvement Asso
ciation, State Mining Bureau, North
Coast Counties, Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce, Southern Pacific Company,
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway,
California Northwestern Railroad and the
North Shore Railroad.
During the month of September seven
teen pamphlets and publications dealing
with the industries of the State were cir
culated in the East. Reports showed that
the literature sent out had acquired an
enormous circulation and the demand for
more had been so great of late that it
was with difficulty that the orders had
been filled.
The committee also approved of the
formation of the California Publication
Bureau.. The object of Hhis bureau will
be to exchange reading matter on Cali
fornia with many of the larger publica
tions in the Eastern States. The bureau
will be controlled by the Promotion Com
mittee.
Several letters from Eastern publishers
were read, showing a great demand for
literature concerning the State through
out the East and Middle West. These let
ters have done much toward advertising
the work of the Promotion Committee.
LITERATURE IN DEMAND.
The monthly report shows that the
work of the committee in advertising the
State and its resources has borne fruit
and that at the present time California
is the objective point of people from every
part of the the United States, all anxious
to invest their money here and to -make
the Golden State their place of abode.
After much deliberation the committee
decided to issue a monthly publication
to be entitled The California Promoter.
This magazine will be attractively gotten
up and its pages will be devoted exclu
sively to California, its resources and its
advantages. The magazine will be circu
lated broadcast throughout the country
and will not contain any advertisements,
its pages being fllkd with interesting
reading matter.
A fourth edition of the book, "San Fran
cisco and Its Environs," was ordered pub
lished. Advertising the resources of the
State in six large Eastern publications
was also ordered, in addition to the
monthly advertisements that have been
placed with different concerns for the last
year. A new edition of the map of Cali
fornia in colors will be' printed soon in
order to meet the growing demand.
One of the most important meetings yet
held by the California Promotion Com
mittee took place Thursday afternoon at
its headquarters, 25 New Montgomery
street A. Sbarboro, Rufus P. Jennings,
George W. McNear, A. A. Watkins and
F. . J. Koster. members of the advisory
board, were present. Many vital topics
were discussed and the committee out
lined work that will be of vast importance
to the State.

Cyanide of potassium accomplished Â¦ud
denly what whisky would probably have
done later In the case of William A. John
son, whose body was taken to the Morgue
yesterday afternoon. Johnson was an ex
pert In grill work In the establishment of
W. Bell, plating and metal works, at 22
Jessie street, and had been on a spree for
several days. He came to the works yes
terday forenoon intoxicated and .asked a
shop boy named Julius Giorgi to get him
a piece of cyanide of potassium from the
basement. As this substance is kept and
used for sharpenini? tools the boy did not
think there was anything wrong in com
plying with the request, and therefore
brought up a slab of the poison one by
two inches long and wide and a quarter
of an inch thick. As he approached he
made a feint as if to rub the drug on his
tongue,- whereupon Johnson remarked, "I
ought. to do that." Giorgi then went out
nnd bought a small flask of whisky for
Johnson, and went to his work in another
part of the shop. Another workman came
in later and found Johnson's body lying
on the floor. Half of the original piecÂ«
of cyanide of potassium was found
wrapped in a bit of paper near the body.
The whisky flask was empty and- the
glass was found in the water barrel.*
Johnson â¢ was a widower, 39 years old
and a native of California. He had sev

A Preparation That Will Destroy the
1 Dandruff Germ Discovered.
Finally the scientific student has -dis-
covered a certain remedy, for dandruff.
When It flrHt ; became known that dan-
druff is the result of a germ or. parasite
that digs Into the scalp and saps the vi-
tality of the hair at the root, causing fall-
Ing ,halr and baldness, biologists set , to
work to discover some preparation Â¦ that
will kill the germ. After a year's. labor
In one laboratory, the dandruff germ de-
stroyer was i discovered; and it is now
embodied In J Newbro's Herplcide. It pre-
vents baldness,, stops falling hair and
speedily eradicates dandruff. '.'Destroy
the cause, you remove the effect." Sold

DLAY in the handicap single tennis
tournament commenced on the Gold
| en Gate Park courts last Sunday will
be resumed to-morrow. The coming
matches will be much more interesting
than those of a week ago when It was
the poor players against the cracks. To
morrow some of the be.st playera will
meet and close matches should result.
All of the good players survived in the)
preliminary and first round and final hon
ors will undoubtedly fall to one of them.
R. N. Whitney and Drummond MacGavin,
two of the most heavily handicapped men.
stand a good chance of winning. Will
Allen, playing from the same mark. Is
probably too heavily handicapped to maka
much progress. The Baker brothers, tha
two newcomers at the park, who won tha
last tournament so cleverly, are expect
ed to cut some figure. George Baker will
meet Whitney and with odds of "owe }Â»
15" stands more than an even chance of
winning. Neil Baker Is on tho scratch
mark and his steady game will prove a
stumbling block to his opponents.
Baker will play Harry Rolf a on even
terms this morning. Rolfe is a youns
California Club player, who has â¢ been
making rapid strides of late, but who
lacks Baker's tournament experience.
Another rising young player who will
bear watching is Clarence Grlflttn. Ha
will meet the winner of the Whltney-G.
Baker match and will make either of
them play their best to win.
The tournament committee of the Cal
ifornia Tennis Club is busily engaged ar
ranging tournaments for the winter
months. It Is the intention of the com
mittee to hold one tournament a month.
The first event will be a handicap sin
gles, which will probably be- played a
v.-eek from to-morrow. The next handi
cap doubles for the challenge cup3 will
be played on Thanksgiving day. -
Many new teams will enter this event
and it will be some time before the tro
phies are won three times by one team.
The committee is classifying all the ac
tive players of the club. Many of them
Â¦will go up into a higher class. In futura
Will Allen and Dr. McChesney will ap
pear in the first class. Harry Rolfe has
improved so rapidly of late that he will
go into the second class, although he ha3
never w on the third. Many of the fourth
class men will play in the third. Dr.
Lovegrove. who practices every day on
the courts, is improving steadily and will
be one of the best in the third class. He
has a peculiar service that some of the
younger players will find hard to han
dle.. . x
Nothing has been done asresards tour
naments for women, but the- committee
has promised the fair exponents of the
game a chance to show their skilL There
will also be one tournament a month, for
the women.
COMPETITION will be keen among
the leashmen next week at Ingleside
Coursing Park. In addition to the
money value of the stakes there will
be valuable trophies to mark the occa
sicn. Â¦
Henry J. Crocker, the Republican can
didate for Mayor, has offered a valuable
cup to be comneted for in the champion
stake. Henry H. Lynch, the Republican
candidate for Sheriff, has offered. a cup
to go to the winner of the open event on
the same occasion.
'The following week the Schmltz cup
will be coursed for by greyhounds owned
by the members of the San Francisco
Coursing Club. Each member will be al
lowed one nomination. In each instance
one victory makes the trophy the prop
erty of the winner.'
The English Greyhound studbook for
this year is out. It shows the sport of
the lr ash is thriving in that country.
The total registration is 3G03 greyhounds.
There are 1544 individual owners repre
sented. One thousand and seventy- two
litters" were registered, a greater num
ber than in any previous year. The
nearest approach was in 1897, when the
total was 1014. .
M. Michaeiex has Issued a challenge to
run any dog In, Fresno with his grey
hound, Jameson Boy, for from $100 to $500 a
side. The challenge is* directed particular
ly against the Greichen Kennel.
The California Coursing Committee, the
governing body of the sport In California,
has granted the San Francisco Coursing
Club representation on its board of man
agers. The club was allowed two repre
sentative's,. Jerry O' Shea and M. Kelly.
The committee has expelled H. H. Lyon,
delegate from the Los Angeles Coursing

New Contest of Krzyzanowski Will.
Owe again Is the win of the late Pala
gia Maria Krzyzanowski the subject of
a legal dispute. Yesterday Aloyzy Syl
vester Borkowski, who claims to be a
nephew of the deceased Polish woman
filed a contest of the will, alleulns that
when she made the document bequeath
ing her 130,000 estate to Charles RIckman
her mind was unsound. It was only a
few months ago that Maria Nachugall
a trained nurse, who claimed to be a
daughter 'of Mrs. Krzyzanowski, died a
contest, of the will. Her" suit was par
tially heard, when she made an offer to
compromise her claim. Rickman consent
ed and paid Miss Nachtigail (10,000 and
she withdrew.
THE test exhibition of lacrosse, and
certainly the most important, ever
given in the United States will corn-
. mence at 3 o'clock this afternoon at
the National baseball grounds, corner of
Ninth and Bryant streets.
.The Shamrocks of Montreal, with a his
tory extending over a period of sixty
seven years, and the Vancouver team,
champions of British Columbia, will meet
in a struggle for the championship of the
world. The records of the teams leave no
doubt of the fact that they are the best
two In the world, and even if the title
were not the stake the exhibition would
be a grand one.
Lacrosse, which really started in what
is now Alabama, its history extending as
far back as Indian lore can. be . traced,
has reached its highest degree of excel
lence in Canada, although in the Eastern
States it is rapidly growing in popularity
and some strong clubs are springing up.
It Is a game that must be played only by
well-trained -athletes if it is to be excit
ing. So well prepared for their exertions
are the best' exponents of the game that
they can stand the strain of eighty min
utes of the fiercest play. In fact, to the
most important games, such as that of to
day, it Is the rule, almost without excep
tion, that the last period of twenty min
-utes is the fastest of the four.
The teams that meet to-day have played
together but twice before, both times in
British Columbia and during the early
part of this month. Each has a victory to
its credit, so to-day's game will decide
the series. It will be a hard game from
the start, a3 each team is going on the
grounds determined to win. A victory
means the lacrosse supremacy of the
world to the winners. All over Canada
the Interest In tfte result is great.
Lacrosse is the swiftest game of all out
door sports. Its great charm from the
standpoint of the spectator is Its simplic
ity. The veriest novice can grasp its
salient points in a moment. Tho play is
open and swift, requiring remarkable deft
ness with the stick and unerring accuracy
in placing 'the ball. The ball flies from
man to man with a brilliancy that is das
zling. The men are always on the go.
There are raps given and raps taken, for
it is no ladies* game. Only strong young
men can play It, and its spice of danger
is one of its greatest attractions to the
men who carry the sticks. Both teams
for to-day's game are In the best possible
condition. Yesterday they rested for the
game, indulging in light exercise In the
morning and car rides to places of inter
est in the afternoon.
* President William Greer Harrison of the
Olympic Club will place the ball for the
first "face." An announcer will keep the
spectators posted as to thÂ« progress of
the game. Each team carries with it a
retinue of trainers, who rub the players
down during the three short periods of
rest.
The teams to-day will line up as fol

a victorious team could be made by the
ccaches from the material at their dis
posal.
The freshmen have played four games,
in three of .which they were defeated. In
the first three contests the '07 eleven put
up such a ragged exhibition of the game
that those who had watched them closely
concluded that in their game with Berke
ley it would simply be a question of how
large a score the California , youngsters
could run up. The Palo Alto Athletic
Club defeated the '07 team twice by the
score of 5 to 0 and 6 to 5, while the crack
Belmont School easily walked away with
their game, the score being C to 0. TÂ»ie
freshmen, however, awoke last Tuesday
when they defeated the Santa Clara Col
lege team by the decisive score of 12 to 0
and showed for the first time the real
possibilities of their team.
The team is light in weight, but that Is
the sort of material Coach Lanagan has
always had to deal with and he endeav
ors to have a team make up in speed
what it lacks in weight. The age, strip
ped weight, height and previous ' football
experience of the individual players on
the Stanford freshman team Is given
herewith:
P TANTORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 16.â
Everything is in readiness for the
intercollegiate freshman contest. The
Stanford cannot show such a list of vic
tories, as her -team: was beaten: twice by
teams California defeatedâ Palo Alto " and
Belmont/ ; Still the coaches do â¢ not * think
The line has five big men in Haffey at
center, Jackson and Allen guards. Sea
bury and Sweany tackles. About, the
most spectacular of these Is Allen, j who
has acquired a pleasant habit of opening
up a hole in the opposing line and then
dragging a halfback or two through with
him for a gain of ten or fifteen yards.
The others know their business, too.
In Mclnnis and Gillis, the right and left
ends respectively, the line has two out
posts that' are a great help to It and to
the backs 'also. Both of them have the
fighting blood of tigers running through
their veins. They are little men, and like
all little men,, full of grit and the never
say-die spirit.'. ;.Â¦'."'.,
Kern is, of course, the star at the half
back position. If the' team had another
tack -like him there would be nothing to
hesitate about in picking the winner.
Kern has the dash and the head' and all
the grit needed by the ideal half-back. He
hits the line hard , every time he gets a
chance at the ball, and if he doesn't make
ground it is not his fault. There* Is. talk
of putting Kern on the varsity team after
the freshman game.
As a fullback Gabriel is not a star, but
a hard, consistent player. He is in air the
fighting and takes all 'the desperate
chances going. He kicks the ball a good
distance whenever It is passed to him.
The freshman eleven has managed . to
go through the season .so ; far without .a
defeat, or oven* a score against It/ though
the ball has been ' mighty near the? cross
bars sometimes. In one or. two cases I it
was only, luck and the width "of *a hair
that stood between the ' team and ". a de
feat or a tie. The team; has i beaten the
Berkeley High ' School, the Lick School,
the Palo Alto High : School, the Oakland
High School, the Santa Clara College and
the Belmont School elevens. - .
The men who will alternate with some
of these men should they get Injured or
the coaches withdraw them are Crow, and
Sanborn at halfback, Schaufele at full
back, Davis and Klelnschmidt at ends;
Brown at guard and Jones at tackle.
The coaches were puzzled about some of
the positions up to the last minute.
Tweedy and CrovA,are about a stand-off
for left halfback aild It was onlyTweedy's
good showing in the game against Bel
mont last Tuesday that won him favor.
Crow did not have as good a chance to
shine when the coaches put hini in, in
the second half, but he would be a credit
to any freshman eleven. Sanborn is close
up to these, but he hasn't quite the dash
and fighting spirit needed to win.
Davis and Klelnschmidt at left - and
right end, In the places of Gillis and Mc
lnnis against the varsity last Thursday,
showed the true fighting spirit and if the
regular men fall out will be able to fill
up well. Jones ran a. close race with
Sweany for tackle, but his Injuries kept
him out of the game so much he wasn't
able to get into shape.
As for the team itself there is not much
that the ordinary. eye can see that is
wanting. The line has hardly been bat
tered backward at all In the practice
games in which it has been engaged. It
has stood firmly against the assaults of
such elevens as Belmont and Santa Clara,
against men every bit as big as them
selves. The gains of the other teams
through this freshman line have been
few.
BKRKELBT, Oct. 16.â Barring two or
three bruises, the California fresh
man team is In good fettle for its
championship football game with the
Stanford eleven this afternoon on Rich
mond Field. Coaches Whipple and Hall
have decided to send the following team
upon the field: -/\
Kern, right halfback; Tweedy, left half
back; Gabriel, fullback; Sell, quarterback;
Haffey, center; Jackson," right guard; Al
len, left guard; Seabury, right- tackle;
Sweany, left tackle; Mclnnis, right end;

Increased in number, but each club has
more members and greater enthusiasm
than it had last year. In the season of
1902-03 there were five clubs in' the Cali
_fornia Association F.ootball League.
These were the Albion Lodge of Oakland,
the American-British Rifles, the Inde
pendent, San Francisco and Vampire
clubs. Toward the close of the season
the San Francisco ! team became short of
players and it has gone out of existence.
The American-British Rifles team, which
won the league championship after an ex
ceedingly close tussle with the Vampires,
has also ceased to exist. The best players
from the defunct clubs have joined other
teams. The following teams make up the
league and will play the regular scheduled
games for the championship of 1903-04:
Vampires, Independents, Albion Rovers,
Hornets, Thistles, Pickwicks and Occi

As there are seven clubs . and three

each Sunday, one team drawing "a bye.
The grounds are Idora- Park, on Tele

ground at Webster street, Alameda, and
the National baseball ground at Ninth

eral other teams in addition to those al
ready named are being formed, among
them being an Olympic Club eleven, a
team of members of the ambulance corps

The southeasterly gale which'prevailed
on Friday, the 9th inst., caused several
of the California yachtsmen to stay at
the moorings Â» on Saturday and Sunday
last, but those of the tars that did go
out after passing the lighthouse at the
entrance to the creek found a fair breeze
and smooth- water. The flagship Idler
made an early start, but the flood tide
caught her off Boole's shipyard. The
schooner Etta B, however, passed a line
to the yawl and towed her out Into a
breeze off Long Wharf. Among the
yachts that followed the flagship were
the yawls Nereid and El Rayo, with the
sloops Secret and Rover.
The Corinthian Yacht Club will give a
closing cupper to Its members on the
*4th at the clubhouse at Tiburon. The
supper will be followed by an entertain
ment given under the management of the
link? committee. The last regular cruise
of the season of 1903 will take place next
day. though some of the fleet will remain
In commission for a Â«-eek or two longer,
as the Belvedere bridge will not be raised
until November S.
The members of the California Yacht
Club will cruise to McNears Landing this
evening and will join the San Francisco
Club at that favorite anchorage. It Is
probable the combined fleets of the San
Francisco, Corinthian and California
clubs will cruise in company in the chan
nel on the closing day of the season, the
winds being too light to encourage the
amateur sailors to venture Into the upper
bay, whence return to moorings ; might
be difficult. Commodore George M.
Shaw's flagship Idler will leave her moor-
Ings in Oakland Creek at 2 o'clock this
afternoon for McNears, so that, even If
the breeze should fail, the flood tide will
carry the yawl to her destination. On
the closing night of the season the Cali
fornia Yacht Club will hold an Impromptu
jinks in its quarters on the estuary.
thian and California Yacht clubs will
give their closing entertainments at their
quarters on Saturday, the 24th lnst., and
the last scheduled cruises of the season
will take place on Sunday, the 25th.
This afternoon and evening- the fleet of
the Corinthian Yacht Club will cruise to
Corinthian Cove in the upper bay above
E! Campo. Port Captain John H. Keefe
will supervise the transportation to-mor
row of the sandwiches, cheese, crackers
and other edibles, with the necessary ac
companiments, in a launch to the ren
dezvous. The annual baseball game be
tween nines composed of members of the
club will take place before luncheon.
Several yachts of the San Francisco
fleet will cruise to McNears Landing this
evening: and will drop anchor there for
the night. To-morrow they will return
to moorings at Sausalito. It has been
decided to give a smoker on closing day,
Saturday, the Zitii, at the clubhouse at
Sausalito, ft being thought that this form
of entertainment is more attractive to
the yachtsmen and tends to bring them
together better than a dance, which Is
attended principally by outsiders.

In the game between Lowell and Lick
yesterday Hamilton kicked a goal from
the field and scored a touchdown after a
dash down the field of seventy - yards,
making the score 10 to 0 in favor of
Lowell.
From the pitiable slump In which Low
ell wallowed in last week's game with
Polytechnic she arose with remarkable
vigor yesterday and the' team of high
school boys played like a veteran var
sity eleven. Lick played like dem
ons. yielding every inch of the field* only
after the hardest kind of a struggle.
Four times Hamilton tried a goal from
the field, once even making the venture
from the 45-yard line. Three times he
missed by the narrowest margin; once
he placed the ball fairly between the
posts from the 25-yard line. His long
run was made only by twisting and dodg
ing nearly every player on the Lick School
team, and was as sensational as that of
Sherman in last year's varsity struggle. '
For the Lick School B. Golcher, Mark
wart and Snell proved a brace of smash
ing backs and put up fierce ball. Had
they received proper support from their
men on the line the score might have

PORTLAND, Oct. 16. â Portland won from

playing. Portland batted Knell oat of the
box in the second. Keefe, who took his place,
was baHed hard, but the hits were Ineffective
for the most part. After holding Sacramento
down for seven innings Thielman went to
pieces in the eighth and ninth and nearly lost
the game. In the tenth he recovered enough
to prevent further scoring. The fielding of

The lone tally of the Cripples came
about in the sixth. Graham shot a safe
ono out to left and advanced a peg on
O'Hara's sacrifice. Then Moskiman came
along with one of his old timers through
the infield and brought the Cripple
pitcher home. The score: . 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ .;>:
The giants made a grand clean up in
the last spasm. Smith responded with a
three-cushion clout to far left field and
Dillon brought him in with a safe bout.
Dillon stole and he lapded when Ross
banged the ball out to center. .
In tho fourth they added another. Spies
walked, stole and landed on Hall's bingle
down the first-base line. Raymond tore
off a double to right in the seventh. Spies
bunted and a wild pitch allowed the little
one to amble home.
The Angels did not start until the sec
ond period. Then Cravath walked and
Ross sacrificed. "Teeley" Raymond came
through with a hit to the right garden
and Spies hit an easy one to Graham.
Raymond ran too hard, and was caught
between third and second. Hall then
walked and , Hoy scored Spies and Cra
vath with a drive over second.
Hall had a good day. Ho kept putting
the ball over the pan and daring the
Cripples to hit it out. They were not
there with a bingle at the right moment.
Were it not for the timely clout of Dr.
Moskiman in the sixth Peter would
surely have left the field without a tally.
is, the southern giants hit the
leather on the solar plexus when they
needed runs. They also took advantage
of the wildness of Mr. Graham when he
waxed wild,, which was often. Score, 6

THE regular Angel victory came about
in a regular sort of way yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Partk. That
The betting in this city was 10 to 4, with
Neil favcritf. It was even money he
would win in fourteen rounds. Reagan is
considered tbe cleverest man of his weight
in the East, which fact makes Neil's per
formance a creditable one.
After the decision hundreds crowded
about Reagan to shake his hand and con
gratulate him upon his great showirs.
He fairly captured the fight fans by hi3
clean, clever style of fighting. It was the
unanimous verdict of the 4000 spectators
that it was "the best fight Los Angeles
has yet seen." Nell was the favorite in
the betting at 10 to 6. Reagan did not
lack supporters and a large amount of
money was wagered on the outcome. Net!
thought the decision was fair and had no
complaint. In the twentieth round the
crowd set up the cry "Reagan," but
it was a case of the sympathy with the
ehort-ender, as the decision of draw was
eminently fair.
Joe Reilly of San Francisco was given
the decision over Clyde Burnham after a
fierce six-round go. It was Burnham's
first defeat.
Xeil forced the pace at most stages, en
deavoring time and again to land his lefi
ripping uppercut, but only once did it land
'air and flush. It put Reagan down and
he took the count to get the rest. He was
up Immediately and put Neil down with
a terrllic left on \he jav. Reagan's be.st
blow was a right uppercut, which he
rcj>eatedly landed on Neil's face and body.
KtQ started every round with a rush an<l
several limes carried Reagan through the
ropee. Hach time he good-naturedly as
sisted the Brooklyn lad to his feet.
After the fourteenth nrund Neil fought
desperately and at times wildly In fcfs
efforts to get in a knockout punch, but
Reagan was too clever to be caught nap
ping. . Reagan showed the better footwork
and was the better boxer at long range.
Nell found this out and kept boring in to
fight for the body. Reagan's ducking was
the cleverest ever seen here. He worked
his way out of some tight corners by his
fast footwork- Neil showed up better at
theclose range milling and tried to keep
close in at all times. Â¦
of Brooklyn fought twenty rounds to
a draw to-night at Hazard's Pavilion.
Referee Eyton'a decision was fair and
popular, although Reagan had the senti
ment cf the crowd with him from start
to finish. It was onÂ© of the fastest fights
ever witnessed here. Both were willing
to mix It at all times and the result w?s
Jhat the referee had plenty of work to do
In going between them.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 16.â Ladies' day
attracted .the largest attendance of
the meeting to Agricultural Park this
afternoon. The grand stand was
thronged with members of the opposite
persuasion and despite the . sweltering
weather 'many, stood and were bumped
and jostled on the outskirts of the betting
ring. There was no special attraction. '; It
was simply a free show and â¢ all hands
were piped aft to take advantage of it.
Nothing commendable can- be said of
the sport itself. Some rank exhibitions of
riding wero witnessed, but no action of
the judges tended to alleviate the suffer
ing of the syndicate stricken talent. High
ball captured the pace, starting a v favor
ite, and Palonius and Chub headed their
fields home first in running events,
starting choices in the- betting.'
A deal was effected to-day whereby
George Baldwin, nephew of the master of
Santa Anita ranch, will have the pick of
t^ie horses in training on' the ranch. This
not only includes the aged horses, but the
flower of thirty-six grand looking year
lings. Among this latter collection is a
strapping brother to Cruzados, which has
already stepped a quarter in 23 seconds.
The entire string will, be shipped to San
Francisco to race. | On the opening day of
the meeting at the New Ascot track E. J.
Baldwin will hold a big disposal sale. It
Is his intention. to reduce the number of
thoroughbred brood mares to twenty-five
and to devote more time to breeding an
other Derby winner.
If Waterbury Â«ould hear a horse walk
on a tin roof, . Adnor, a 5 to 1 chance,
would have taken the first running event,
a six-furlong scramble. With the race
well In hand and leading into the stretch
by three lengths he made a turn that
would have made a mountain stage driver
blush and at the wire was nipped and
beaten a head by Angle, a 6 to 1 shot.
Tamm, the 6 to 5 favorite, with Frawley
up, stopped at all ' way stations, finally
taking the show position.
A very trashy consignment faced the
webbing in the five and a half furlong
scramble next decided. Achilles, which
at one time was considered a stake propo
sition, .was Installed a 4 to 5 favorite, but
is only a wreck of his former self. Ester
well, a 15 to 1 shot, jumped away in front,
leading to the stand, where she was col
lared and led by the Judges by Little Se
cret, the second choice.
On the strength of his race In the Derby
Palonius looked almost a certainty for
the seven-furlong selling affair and the
Altamax colt went to the post at even
money. Tullett had the leg up in the first
choice and, after he had indulged Nona B
with the lead up to the stretch turn, went
to the front and won with pounds in re
serve in 1:27*4. < Nona B finished second
and the heavily played Chlleno was for
tunate in being awarded the show. V
Fox Lake let the short end players
down hard by finishing third In the two
year-old sprint. The Chicago youngster
was a 4 to 6 favorite, :but his underpin
ning grew warm and he- swerved badly
the last part. Durbar.'the seconu choice,
piloted by "Big Bill" Knapp, caught Eu
genia B, the Schrelber entry, getting the
verdict by a half length. The latter filly
snowed a world of speed.
All the graduates from the training
school booked Chub to win the closing
mile and fifty yard selection, which he
did. Powell tucked himself away fifth on
the bend for home and there 'cut loose,
disposing of Marelio without effort.

riding thought Bullman was to blame
when Injunction lost to River Pirate at
Morris Park, but on each subsequent oc
casion the verdict has been sustained and
to^ay there was no complaint forthcom
ing about the ride.' As a matter of fact,
River Pirate was to-day a good colt and
was ridden by . Qolburn in a new style,
which worked well.; This is called in
England the "monkey on a stick" style.
Each time that Hicks has ridden River
Pirate that colt has been hard punished
all the way. Colburn, on the contrary,
was not required to make ; a move
on him except toward the last

TWO SPBTNTEES CHOSEN
FOB OLYMPIAN GAMES
Abadle of Berkeley and Dunn of
Stanford Will Head the Cali
fornia Team. ."
The Olympian games committee met
yesterday and selected two athletes who
will head the list of those sent to the
St. Louis Exposition next year. The
sprinters so honored are E. R. Abadla
of the University of California and "Wal
ter P. Dunn of Stanford University.
Abadle is a consistent ten-second - per
former, being able to cover the classic
distance in even time under .average con
ditions.
Dunn holda the coast record of 50 2-5
seconds for the quarter mile. This was
made on a slow track. He has covered
the distance in better than fifty seconds
in practice.
The proposed indoor meet at Mechanics'
Pavilion next week has been abandoned.
Many entries were received, but It was
thought the attendance would not Justify
the risk taken.
As there were a number of entries for
the 1000-yard run the committee . decided
to run it off on Berkeley Oval two weeks
from to-day at 3:15 p. m. Three prizes
will be awarded. There will bo no fee
charged. The entries already received

The steamship Meteor, which lost her
propeller and for some time past has been
drifting helplessly about In the Bering
Sea, has been picked up and is now on
her way to Eureka. The j Bering Sea is
at best a poor place for a disabled vessel
of any kind and few vessels could be so
altogether helpless as the Meteor without
a propeller. .
At this season of the year these north
ern waters are full of dangers, even for
vessels under full control, and as the
Meteor without a propeller was about
as awkward to navigate as an iron kettle,
the knowledge of her condition gave rise
to grave anxiety.
The news of the Meteor's predicament
was taken' . to shore by . one . of. ,the
steamer's officers, who, with a few hardy
seamen, braved the winter waters in a
Email boat and after a perilous trip mado
land and succeeded in communicating
with the outside world. .
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamship St. Paul has arrived at St.
Michael, and, according to word received
yesterday from Captain Lindquist, sn~e
passed the Meteor October 9 in tow of:
the steamship Eureka. The vessels were
making slow .but steady , way t toward
Dutch Harbor, for "which port the* Meteor
has a cargo. The Meteor is * well ' known
here and the news of her. safety was re
ceived in local shipping circles . with : con
siderable relief. ' ":1SSPSÂ£

where on the Pacific leaking like
a sieve but fighting her way to ,
Magdalena Bay, sailed, baled, steered and
navigated by one man, her skipper. Cap
tain Hall. Incidentally, Hall is playing
nurse to the man that comprised his
crew, but who was knocked out of com
mission by a blow from a swinging spar.
The story of the Rover's plight was
brought to port yesterday by Captain
Trask of the steamship Barracouta. The
Panama liner sighted the Rover at 5:30 a.
m. on October 11 in latitude 2G.05 north,
lengiture 113.35 west, off the coast of Low
er California. The Rover was flying her
ensign upside down. A strong northwest
er was blowing at the time and the little
vessel was hove to. When the liner ap
proached the sloop Captain Hall hailed
the steamship and asked Captain Trask
for his position. He had been blown off
shore, he said, during the night. A boat
was lowered from the Barracouta and
Captain Trask sent an officer to invest!- .
gate the condition of affairs on the sloop j
and to find out what was wanted. Hall j
said that what he needed most of all was |
assistance, but none of the Barracouta's
crew cared to change quarters to the
leaking Rover. His only helper, he re
ported, had been knocked down by the
boom and completely disabled.' The Rover
was bound from San Pedro to Magdalena
Bay for a cargo of shells. She was then !
out ten days. The sloop was leaking, but
the captain, who said his name was Hall,
refused to leave his vessel. He had plen
ty of food, he said, could control the leak
ing and guessed he could take the Rover
to her destination single-handed.
The Barracouta stood by the Rover for
two and a half hours, and Just before
parting company Captain Trask furnished
the lone mariner with his correct position.

Widely conflicting stories are received
as to the condition of the iron and steel
industry- There is evidence that the de
cline In quotations has been checked al
though It is occasionally stated that spe
cial terms are made on Important con
tracts.
While some contraction in trade and
industry has undoubtedly taken place, it
Is not In proportion to the reduction of 20
per cent In the pig iron output or the re
action in the prices of securities, although
In standard railroads these have usually
proved fairly reliable barometers of busi
ness. Many branches of manufacture,
however, are working full force, with
large orders still unfilled, while the latest
returns of , the crops are most encourag
ing. Finance and labor are the disturb
ing elements this year, neutralized very
largely by favorable commercial and ag.
ricultural conditions. The net result is a
fairly well maintained volume of trade,
offset by conservatism in carrying out
projected new undertakings and proposed
extensions of faciUties. Railway earnings
thus far available for October are 6.2 per
cent larger than last year and 12.7 per
cent above IDOL
In Canada failures number 17, against
19 last week and 15 in the corresponding
week a year ago.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morow will sav:
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending October 15 number

week of 1902, 1S3 in 1901, 223 In 1900 and 221

Wheat, including flour, exports for the
week ending October 15 are 3.2S6.610 bush
els, against 2.27S.172 last week and 5.240.G&S
this week last year. Corn exports for the
week aggregate 4.410,612 bushels, against
3,110,118 last week and 1,180,674 a year ago.
Reports of suspension of improvement
work by railroads come rather earlier
than usual this year, but sales of new
rails, cars and supplies point to much of
this work doing. It is to be noted that
while dry goods and textiles report dull
ness in many places, groceries, hardware
and food products move more freely be
cause of price conditions being easier.
Eastern cotton mills have not yet resumed
in full and are buying sparingly as yet,
but wool is in rather better sale to cover
order* booked. Reports from the Eastern
jewelry manufacturing trade are quite
good, and shipments of nhoes from East
ern centers break all previous years' rec
ords.
Money Is easier at the largest centers,
but while this makes it less difficult to
get accommodation this very fact is rer
garded as evidence of quietness, in many
lines releasing funds which ordinarily
would be inactive. Collections are still
complained of as slow. There are, how
ever, some favorable features in the situ
ation. The indisposition of producers to
meet consumers' demands ie a sign of an
ability to hold, which, whether wise or
not, indicates underlying prosperous con.
ditions.
General trade and industry still lacks
the eyur of insistent demand which has
been so conspicuously present In the
autumn of recent years. Exceptions to
this are noted In the Southwest in the
hardware business, where the demand as
a whole is reported equal to last year, and
at some points in the Northwest and on
the Pacific Coast. In the Central West
business Is fair, but at the East the quiet
ness Is Increasing, and reports from the
South axe rather less optimistic, if some
portion* of Tennessee and Florida, where
crop yields are especially good, are ex
ccpted.
The reasons for tbis are not far to seek.
Sympathetic reflection of depression in se
curities is shown in more conservative
and cautious buying at wholesale. Crops
generally are slow to move. Cereal pro
ducers are apparently disinclined to ac
cept present prices for their products, and
the lower prices for cotton reached some
time ego, with much less favorable ad
vices from that crop, cloud the Southern
aspect slightly. The shut-downs of iron
furnaces fail to stimulate values in this
line.

The California Promotion Committee
and the Denver Chamber of Commerce
are corresponding relative to getting con
ventions to visit the West in 1905. Ac-
I cording to the statements made by the
I Denver body, there are booked 178 con-
I ventions of a national character to be
held; in St. Louis during the year 1904. It
is therefore suggested by Denver that by
I concerted effort, on the part of the prin
! cipal cities of the far West
i of the conventions j could be secured for
1905. The text of the,communicatlon from
the Denver Chamber of Commerce is as
follows:
California Promotion Committee: As you of
course realize, this is becoming an age of con
ventions.- Every year sees' ; new ones added
to the already long list, and each year they are
attended | by larger numbers of people. The
advantages accruing to the cities where these
conventions are held are well recognized and
the rivalry to secure them is keen.
We are informed that one hundred and sev
enty-eight conventions of a national character
.are already booked for St. Louis next year. It
has occurred to the Denver Chamber of Com
merce-that if the proper kind -of concerted
effort were made by the principal cities of tin
far West a large number, If not indeed a ma
jority, of these conventions Â¦ could be brought
to the West in 1905. Denver Is peculiarly situ
ated in relation to the other Western cities.
Railroad statistics Â«how that 90 per cent of
all tourists visiting the Pacific Coast stop In
this city either on the way. out or back. We
profit largely from all large gatherings that
can be secured for your town. We have, there
fore, a selfish interest In helping you to secure
such conventions &m you desire, fi Salt Lake
City and Ogden have similar resources for
Joining In a movement of this kind.
We believe that if the cities of San Fran
cisco Los Angeles, Portland. Seattle, Tacoma,
Spokane, Osden, Salt Lake City and Denver
can a?ree among themselves what particular
conventions each city would like, and then all
of them work together to carry out the pro- Â¦
gramme as arranged, we cannot fail of success.
This chamber has assurances of the sym
pathy and co-operation of the executive com
mittee of 'the Trans-Mississippi and Irrigation
congresses and of the New Orleans and. St.
Louts Chambers of Commerce. The railroads
will of course aid us to , the limit of their
ability. The great Lewis & Clark exposition
to be held In 1905 at Portland will prove a
magnet that' will help us draw the crowds this
way.' Many of the brightest men from each of
the cities interested will be stationed at St.
Louis r.ext year, and their assistance can
doubtless be secured at little or no cost. Every- ,
thing seems to us propitious for such a move- I
ment. We would like an early expression from j
you as to what you think of the proposal, j
Yours respectfully, â¢ Â¦*

CMÂ»*CC to-days trading in thp stock msrket.
uvi before the c!oÂ«Â» wÂ«>rÂ«> ln something like a
panic, buying in all <Sir*-oti<-nf in heavy vol
ume. The early Ftajrf-s cf th* tfÂ«e ww- viewed
wiiti apparent wmiplactnej i>y the largÂ» out
standing ehort interÂ«>*t. In the expectation that
tÂ»i* rally would h* untmiiortar.t, as has proved
to b* the case so often of late. Their confl
dcr.c^ u-as increak^d t> thÂ» fact that Amalga
mated Copper rr.a<!c but a fwble re?potiÂ»Â» y^s
tÂ«*Â«-day and this mortiinp to tho dividend decla
rstion. although thf outRtaniiing short interest
in that stock was relieved to -have grown to
.Â«*Â»Â» largo rroportioiiF. An actual 1 decline of
a point ln Reading second rreferred on the
declaration of HÂ« initial dividend also pointed
to the conclusion thst good news was takÂ»n
Â«dvantagÂ« of to liquidate rtocks. But the fact
Ucame very Â«vld*rt early to-day that the
rrt-fsure of licjuidation was almost entirely re-
Uif-d. Evm the much-enduring industrials
wt;re frt* from the recent Indiscriminate sell
ing and were suffered to hold up their heads
and msde rom<? scattering advances. The bears
*>egsn to diroover that in offering prices down
thty were not meeting their recent invariable
VucceES tn dlMolging celling orders and induc
inar liquidation. There were heavy portions of
the market, notwithstanding this general ten
dency, notably in the Pennsylvania group and
the aathracite carriers. The reduction In soft
coal rates to the FeAbrard and reports of clos
ing down cf Â«dditlor.al anthracite collieries
were supposed to be the cause of this heavi
necs, but the suspicion grew that these stocks
were deprcts*d to facilitate covering ln ether
Tiarts of the list, -lieyond the cessation cf the
ji:Miif'.i liquidation there was very little
news to account for the turn in the market.
There Â«aÂ« m. very rarorable Ftatemect cf Aug
ust earnings by Missouri Pacific showing
Â«rroeÂ» earnings for that month of upward of
3M.O00.O0O. an unprecedented feature, while the
increase ln net earnings over laet year rached
f293.O0O. A compilation of earnings over
ti<t;*ty railroads for August indicates that their
"net gain in earning* over last year averages
more thnn 16 per cent. These facts may have
Played a part in Inducing buying, although
they hate been consistently ignored fcr some
time. The reported contract of the United
*-'tat*s Rtc-^1 Corporation for furnishing steel to
a great shipbuilding company in Great Britain
was also regarded as a promising development.
The demand of the employes of Manhattan
failed to create alarm.
Banks fceem to have gained upward of a
million dollars of canh r<--*<?rvrs for the week.
mo that already a week's advance has been
made without th* development of the custom
ary Western demand for currency. The arrival
at the mid-Oetob^r reason is felt to insure the
eafcty of the wrn crop. But whll* these fac
tors may have aided in the recovery, the dom
inent fertrsr evidt-ntly was an agrresslve lead
ership tit the market against the ehort Interest,
which was made successful by the cessation
<jr liquidation, the banks having apparently
completed a procrss of clearing out undesira
ble collateral, which they have been pursuing
for eorne time past. The rise or 3% In United
M8tMi Steel preferred and of 3% in Amalga
mated made those stocks the market leaders,
although there were some less active stocks
which showed some larger advances. In the
UKual prominent storks th*>re were general ad
wmrcf cf 2 to 3 points and the market closed
buoyant at the top.
Bonds shared moderately in the strength of
stocks. Tcul sales of bonds, rar value, were
$3.fce9.000.

a building j now being erected by Lewln

lng^to the provision of the building ordi
nance, which requires all walls ' of brick
buildings more than 137& feet in depth to

Complaint was also made that tlje party
wall ,of a four-story brick building in
course of construction on the south side
of Sutter street, between Taylor and
Jones, does not extend through- the roof,
but stops at the ceiling of the top story,
which is not considered to be safe con
struction. \
Another building on Sutter street,-be
tween Jones and Leavenworth, owned by
J. M. Lee. is not being furnished with
iron, beams in the light wells so as to tie
the walls at each story. The Board of
Works Immediately directed *a corps of

..If you'have been, reading. Spearman's new series of two-page stories
you will not need even these extracts to keep you on a sharp lookout for
Delaroo in the next Sunday Call. Spearman's stories are the sort that
you never forget. They get a grip on your memory like the mysterious
fascination of railroading itself.
However. Delaroo is onlv one of the big things in the next Sunday
Call, as. for instance. "The Golden Fetich." It is a new mystery story
more mysterious even than "The Mystery Box," more excitinsr than
"Tainted Gold," more surprising by far than "Brewster's Millions." and
vet containing all the originality of these three arid more. You've read
them all in the Sunday Call. You know then what splendid promise you
may expect in the first installment of "The Golden Fetich" next Sunday.
Then there is "The End of the Line," by. Mrs. Edwin Knowles:
"The Man Who Won." by Edwin Lefevre; Miss Partinzton's Prize
Paris Picture: "The Etiquette of the Coaching Girl." by Madge Moore;
"Education for Success." by Sir John A. Cockburn. K. C. M. G.:
"Me-ows of a Kitty." by Kate Thyson Marr; a full page of .prize photo-
graphs from the Third San Francisco Salon, and â but there is alto-
gether too much to enumerate here. You'll have to see it all for your-
self. â¢ ?>Â£'&; .-?>%Â¦
OFFICIAL Kansas is all amazement over, a new element that
has just obtruded itself into American politics and â rwon out.
Official Kansas is investigating, but meantime the women of
an entire State are seeinjt to it that their triumph of the last few
weeks .is maintained .and the cause of true love holds full sway.
They fought in a wav peculiarly feminine for their right to receive
their lovers and to be wooed* and won and married when, where and how
they pleaded. The men fought against it, but the women won. and in
pursuance of that victory they dragged the defeated candidates out of
office by main force. Hence official Kansas perturbation. Hence,
too official Kansas* effort to keep the facts -quiet until it gets fall
and final report of this astounding condition of affairs. Meantime HvÂ«
men rules an entire State in a manner never before witnessed in all the
history of the world. The Sunday Call will put you in possession of all
the facts next Sunday, official Kansas' perturbation notwithstand-
ing 'â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦
And did you ever read of Delaroo? He was an Indian. He was
more He was the shadow incarnate of. Maje Sampson; He was even
more than that. He was the best- railroad character that ever causht
the facile pen of Frank H. Spearman, who is himself the best writer of
American railroad stories in the world to-day. This is , Delaroo as
Spearman knew him: â¢ "i. â¢
"As long as Mate 'would talk Delaroo would listen. That single
word was. in fact, the kev to Delaroo ; Delaroo was a listener: for that
reason nobody knew much about him."
And this in brief is one of the most tense moments in all Spear-
man's exciting narrative of Delaroo's career: '*}X : ;
"What do I think of it?" muttered^ Neighbor, when the local operator
asked him for a report for Callahan. "I think there's two engines for
the scrap in sightâ and the 264. if we can ever find anything of her â and
about a million sheep to oav for â " Neighbor paused to give an order
and survey the frightful scene.
"And Delaroo." repeated the operator. "He wants to know about
Delaroo â "
"Missing."

At the time of Harper's exposure a cir
cular bearing the report of the findings
against him was printed and sent to
One of the pastors, whom Harper
charges, speaking in regard to the in
vestigation, said:
This is purely a case of malice on the part
of Harper. The charges against Harper which
caused us to remove him from the church
Â¦were preferred by Secretary McCoy of the
young Men's Christian Association of San
Francisco and came ud before the conference
February 20. 1003. We ,were appointed to in
vestigate them and we found I them all true.
Harper on the testimony of several young men
of the association was found guilty. The
committee then suspended Harper and con
cluded to held him for trial or give him the
alternative of surrendering his credentials and
leaving the church. He chose the latter. Hla
present course Is undoubtedly the result bf
spite and we have no fear of the result of the
investigation of the charges â¢ preferred against
us. What we did was for the good of . the
church. Â¦ '-fV
So positive was the committee that the
charges of Harper was malicious that the
accused pastors were not even asked to
make a statement.
The committee completed its labors late
this evening, but withheld its findings un
til the resumption of the conference to
morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock. It was
learned, however; that the committee
found that Harper's charges were "ma
licious and without foundation," and that
the accused ministers would be vindi
cated.
FINDINGS WITHHELD.
The men against whom Harper made
these damaging accusations are Rev. J.
J. N. Kenney of St. Paul's Methodist
Episcopal Church of Fresno, Rev. W. O.
Waggener of the Methodist Church South
of Ukiah, Rev. J. A. Wailes of the Fifth
street Methodist, Church South of Santa
Rosa and Rev. W. E. Vaughan, editor
of the Pacific Methodist Advocate.
Harper, who was forced to resign from
his pastorate of the Centenary Church
of San Francisco last spring and -who Is
no longer a Methodist minister, was rep
resented in the preferring of the charges
by Rev. H. C. Meredith of San Jose.
The accused clergymen were all mem
bers of the investigating committee that
suspended Harper ,last spring and caused
him to surrender his credentials and leave
the church.
Harper's averments come as counter
charges.
The investigation consumed the entire
day.
Bishop Morrison, who is presiding over
the conference, appointed an investigat
ing committee, composed of Rev. J. c.
Simmons of Stockton, Rev. A. Odora of
Le Grande and Rev. J. Emery of Hollis
ter.
yesterday by sensational charges
against four of the State's most prominent
Methodist clergymen. The allegations
were by Edward J. Harpgr, a former pas
tor of the Centenary Methodist Church
South of San Francisco. .
OAKLAND. Oct.' 16.â The Pacific
Methodist Conference South, in
session at Asbury Church, was
thrown into a flock of excitement
Harper made a determined' effort this
morning to have his credentials restored.
Bishop H. vC. ..Morrison refused to give
him a hearing. Then C. F. Harper, father
of the former '.. minister, threatened to
withdraw his support from the church,
with which he has been* connected for
the last thirty years. He and his son
claim that the original charges were not
formal and were the result of Jealousy.
Edward J. Harper says that no written
charges were ever prepared against him.
The charges have created widespread
indignation, as they involve the character
of men who are well known. The various
members of the conference consider, the
present action of Harper a farce. They
say it is merely an accompaniment to the
suit filed last month and will prove in
effective.
It remained for Rev. H. C. Meredith of
San Jose to prefer the official charges in
behalf of Harper. Presiding Elder J. E.
Moore of San Francisco was also a mem
ber of the committee that investigated
Harper's alleged immoral conduct, but
Meredith refused to sign charges against
him.
No cognizance was taken of the com
munication, as it was considered unof
ficial.

dist Episcopal ' Church South on the ground

The prisoners must have had an accom
plice on the outside in order that tho en
velope containing the fraudulent remis
sions of sentences should come in the mall
bag to Major Paxton, prison commander,
ilajor Morrow was making' a quiet inves
tigation as to who might have slipped the
fateful missive in the mail bag when it
â¢was reported that Foster, the messenger,
had disappeared. The army officers are
inclined to think that the enlisted man
v.as affected with a gxiilty conscience and
that he thought Major Morrow was close
on his track. A vigorous attempt will be
made to apprehend Foster.
The investigating officer will complete
his formal report at an early date and
transmit it to General MacArthur.
Major Morrow spent two full days at
Alcatraz and inspected the offices where
"White and Moore were detailed. Paper
like that on which the forgeries were
committed was found in abundant quan
tities. In the printing office Major Mor
row made an exact copy of one of the
forged orders, thus demonstrating that
the crime might well have been committed
on the island.
Major H. "W. Morrow has made a con
ciflerable amount of progress In his inves
tigation of the fescape of Federal Prison
ers "White, Moore. Stokes and Darling
from Alcatraz on October 7. Messenger
Foster, who was detailed to carry the
mail between army, headquarters in this
city and Alcatraz, has deserted. William
Lefeyth, who was suspected of complicity
in the plot through which the convicts
were released, has been located at Mare
Island. It was learned by Major Morrow
that he had enlisted in tho marine corps,
and a diligent search revealed his where
abouts. Lefeyth will be subjected to a
rigorous questioning, and if it is found
that he has done anything criminal he
Â¦will be severely dealt with, as he has al
ready received a dishonorable discharge
from the army.
It would appear as If McDonnell had
fallen into the "bad man" habit and was
engaging in his swindling operations not
so much for the profit as for the pleasure
of being wicked. â¢
One of McDonnell's picayune specula
tions In which he engaged a few years
ago was to advertise in the dally papers
for a Grand Army veteran to fill the posi
tion of elevator attendant at wages of J60
per month. The applicant was requested
in the advertisement to inclose a 2-cent
postage stamp with his application. That
was all the profit that McDonnell got out
of his speculation. -.The 'room on Kearny
street that he hired to occupy as "E Ep
stein, pawnbroker," cost him $24 per
Â¦month. ...
Â¦Â¦ McDonnell- is nearly 80 years old and is
thought to be slightly abnormal in his
mind. His latest scheme was to write to
persons in the country advising them that
a parishioner of his at Emeryville had
died after, confessing that he had stolen
a large sum of money from the person
addressed and that all that the decedent
had left of any value was a pawn ticket
showing that $12 50 had been loaned on a
gold locket with a solitaire diamond. The
person addressed was advised to send
thatsum to H. Epstein, pawnbroker, at
a certain number on Kearny street and
receive the valuable locket and diamond.
The strangest part of the story is -that
McDonnell has furnished to his attorney
a receipt or bill of sale from a firm of
wholesale jewelers in this city certifying
that McDonnell had Sought of them four
lockets, three at $3 25 each and one at
$12/ wholesale prices. If the bill of sale
is genuine it proves that McDonnell must
have received a large number of replies
inclosing $12 50 each through the mails to
net him sufficient profit to ' make the
scheme worth the risk. ?
The prisoner was remanded to the cus
tody of the United States Marshal pend
ing the finding of a new indictment by
the Federal Grand Jury-
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday quashed the Indictment against
George T. McDonnell, alias "H. â¢ Epstein,"
alias "Rev. J. R. Taylor', pastor of the
Church of the Redeemed at Emeryville,"
charging him with having. used the mails
for the purpose of . defrauding gullible
and dishonest persons by means of a
pawn ticket scheme. -The action of the
court was taken on a demurrer argued by
Bert.Schleslnger, who produced a decision
by Judge . Olln Wellborn of the United
States District Court at Los Angeles, who
held that it was not (Sufficient in such a
case that the indictment should merely
follow the language of the statute, but it
should also I charge directly that the de
fendant had intended to perpetrate the
fraud through the instrumentality of the
mails. Â¦Â¦ :'V'-^ ;V -
