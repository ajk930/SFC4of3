in the House . of All Nations, the flve

blaze to have been of incendiary origin.
Some of the peculiar features of the
disaster, in addition to the startling loss
of life, are that the flre was practically
extinguished in twenty minutes; that the
police could learn of but one person hav
ing been Injured other than those who
lost their lives, and that the property loss
was only 57000. i

they Ignited, flared at a height and then
collapsed In a great dust of sparks, which
were carried to the roofs of like buildings.
Two men, Frank Conley, a salesman,
and Peter A. S. Kelley, a bartender, are
under arrest,, suspected of knowing the
cause of the flre. They had been seen
passing In and out of the frame building In
which the blaze was first seen.
The burned area extended from-Tilyou's
walk south to Jones' walk, where a brick
wall saved the rest of the .resort, and
from the Bowery to the ocean, a. distance
of seven blocks. For. two blocks the
flames cut a swath westward of the Bow
ery, reaching to Surf avenue,' the prin
cipal thoroughfare . of- the resort. , In all
this territory but 1 two buildings were
standing to-night' untouched. '

The fire engines found it impossible to
get Into action for nearly four hours. The
alarm came from the Hippodrome, a low
frame building used in summer for a
merry-go-round. The firemen thought it
would all be over in a moment, but the
blaze had gained headway. It crept un
der the building and under the raised
street around the piling and ten minutes
later the Albatross Hotel was aflame.
From that time on, while alarm after
alarm brought every fireman within ten
miles, the fire seemed to jump from walk
to walk and from flimsy building to flimsy
building.
With the lack of water the flre ha'd the
forest of wooden structures at Its mercy,
and all that could be done was to save life,
if possible, and furniture. Everything por

of the barriers of household goods, weep

The piers of the trestle were burned out
for a distance cf 100 feet. The track was
torn up for seventy-five feet. Tbe trestle
is about 900 feet long:. After the relief
train had arrived and the baggage trans
ferred to other cars, the engine of the sec
end section pulled the Bleeping coaches
The members of the "Florodora" com
pany worked like demons for over an
hour in the chilly morning air In saving
thtir baggage from the burning cars. The
actresses gave all assistance possible to
the injured mail clerks, and some even
fought the flames witn wet fcacks and
blankets.
Tne cars burned from 5 o'clock In the
morning, when the accident happened,
until after 2 p.m. A relief train was sent
from division headquarters at Red Bluff.
The relief train carried two railroad phy
sicians. Drs. Fife of Red Bluff and Mag
gard. of Teharaa, and fifteen volunteer
attendants. The train arrived at the scene
at 7:30 o'clock.
The car was destroyed. Not one letter
was saved from the flames. The car con
taining the scenery of the "Florodora"
company and which also fell through the
trestle was destroyed with its contents.
The destruction of the scenery and the
car represents a loss of $13,000 to the opera
company. All the baggage in the special
car of the opera company was saved after
a hard fight. The car was burned to the
iron work.
When the crash came every person on
the train was awakened by the terrific jar
and noise. One of the women of the opera
company was thrown from her btrth, but
not hurt. The excitement ran high. Peo
ple piled out of the sleepers in frightened
haste. None had time to dress and ran
in every direction in their night garments.

Mail Clerks F. L. Southwick and Charles
Rhvan were at their stations when the
accident happened. Southwick was seri
ously Injured. His right shoulder was
broken and seven ribs on the right side
were caved In. He was otherwise badly
bruised and hurt. Rhyan received pain-
Xul bruises, but was not seriously hurt.
The doors of the mail car were closed
when the car crashed through the trestle
and Rhyan had to break the windows out
in order to escape from the burning
Â¦wreckage. He succeeded In dragging his
injured companion through the small
eperture only after a long and hard strug
gle. Soutbwick was unconscious.

ENGINEER, SHOWS COURAGE.
The train was thundering along at the
rate of forty-five miles an hour when
the curve near the burning- trestle was
reached. As the engine roundsd the turn
and the burning structure came into view
Engineer Bousher reversed his engine and
threw on the air brakes. His train was
less than 100 feet from the trestle when
he saw the danger ahead. Morris jumped
as the engine struck the trestle. Bousher
opened wide the valve, throwing) the full
pressure Into the cylinders. The front
trucks of the engine jumped, and as the
ponderous machine was brought to a
standstill the main trucks were wedged
against the guard and main rails.

miles from the scene of the disaster,
three cars of the first section of the
north-bound California express plunged
through the SOO-foot trestle at Sesma at
I o'clock this morning. Fireman Charles
Morris Jumr>ed from the engine and was

NEW YORK, Nov. Lâ Sensational alle
gations of willful misstatements. falsifi
cation, swindling and fraud In the organi
zation and flotation of the United States
Shipbuilding Company; -of attempts to
mislead and deceive the Investing public
by erroneous prospectus statements, and
of a deliberate plan to wreck the company
by withholding the earnings of the Beth
lehem Steel Company are contained in
the report of Receiver James Smith Jr.
of the United States Shipouilding Com
pany," made public to-day. Tne report
concludes with the recommendation that
suit be brought against all persons who
received stock of the company without
paying full value therefor, including the
promoters of the consolidation, the ven
ders of the constituent plants and Charles
M. Schwab, to recover from them such
amount as Is necessary to pay the debts
Of the company in full.
- Receiver Smith alsp recommends thÂ©
sale of the Crescent shipyard plant In
New Jersey and the Harlan & Holllnga
worth plant at Wilmington, Del., subsid
iary plants now in partial operation, to
avoid further loss by depreciation and
the enforcement of a receivership for the
Bethlehem Steel Company, to Insure the
payment of dividends on the Bethlehem
stock held by the United States Shipbuild
ing Company.
' "AN ARTISTIC SWINDLE."
In the words of the report, the organi
zation o. he company Is characterized as
"an artistic swindle," Receiver Smith as
serting that the value of the plants, their
earnings and working capital, given In
alleged thorough reports^ of expert ac
countants,* vary so much from actual fig
ures "as to Impel the belief that the fig
ures were willfully misstated": that it is
extremely doubtful if such accountants*
reports were submitted at the organization
of the company; that the organization
was effected by "dummy" stockholders,
directors and officers; that statements in
the prospectus Issued on June 14, 1302,
were incorrect; that for property worth
$12,441,516 the shipbuilding company paid
in stock and bonds $67,997,000/ that "the
accommodating directors of the United
States Shipbuilding Company. In acquir
ing these companies, deliberately gave
away many million dollars In the stock
and bonds of their company"â "wholesale
plunder." the receiver terms Itâ "to a few
persons," and 1 that, so far as the Bethle
hem Steel Company Is concerned, "its
earnings have been withheld in a delib
erate attempt to wreck the United States
Shipbuilding Company."
SCHWAB GETS EVERYTHING.
The report deals fully with the name of
Charles M. Schwab, and thÂ© nature of the
Bethlehem transaction, says Smith. Is
such as "to Justify him (Schwab) in say-
Ing that he did not sell tne Bethlehem
Steel Company, but took over the United
States Shipbuilding Company, the direc
tors of that company giving him $30,000.
000 In stock and bonds for taking It eft
their hands."
The first report deals with the incor
poration of the original United States
Shipbuilding Company, with $3000 capital
and "dummy" directors and officers, in
June. 1902; tHe offer of Promoter John W.

pany. The incorporators of the company,
the report states, were Howard K. "Wood.

LONDON. No\'. 2.â The latest solution,
of the engrossing problem of the Ameri
can woman is that she is an anarchist, a
â¢ degenerate and of a dangerous, abnormal
' type. EL B. Marriott Watson presents in
â¢ the Nineteenth Century, published to
Â¦day. an elaborate analysis of the charac
â¢ ter of the trans-Atlantic femininity, arriv
"' ing at the conclusion that Mr. Gibson's
" goddess Is little better than a whited
sepulcher.
"The character of the American woman
. 6f to-day," he fays, "is the product part
lj of racial modification and partly of the
social conditions of a commercial age. We
have many opportunities of studying the
American woman, for she has undertaken
to annex as much of Europe as practic
able end has succeeded very fairly.
**A little time back some enthusiastic
journal in New York was at paina to
â¢ compile a list of American women who
" had married, not Europeans merely, but
Europeans with titles. A large majority
"of these ladlus were confessedly wealthy
and it would be absurd to ignore the ob
1 vious bargains upon which many such
- matches are based; on the one side
money, on the other influence or posl
â¢'tion. It Is considered by the taste of the
. day quite creditable if some pork pack
er's dollars from Chicago should buy a
coronet In Mavfair.
. "The American woman is claimed by
her admirers as" being independent, but
" she Is more. than that; she is anarchical.
The state hae been built upon certain so
ciological facts as foundation. Tha
â¢ American woman is destroying these and
with them, therefore, the structure of
the state as it exists now. Evidences that
American women are deliberately turn
ing their backs on, natural laws have ac
cumulated of. recect years.
"It would seem that while the American
â¢â¢ man unnaturally devotes all his days to
money-making, the American woman as
â¢ .unnaturally devotes her days to pleasure.
. Whereas the savage woman acted as a
beast of burden to her lord, thÂ© American
man works like a beast of burden be
iside his triumphing lady. Unless Ameri
can civilization alters. It would seem to
be doomed." â¢ â¢- -'Â¦" <

While several hundred thousand, acres of pub

which patents have been obtained by the perpe

It is proper to say, also, that some of the state
ments in regard to the matter which have ap
peared in the newspapers recently, both in the
East and In the West, are more or less exag
gerated and others are mere surmises. The
statements widely circulated to the effect that
five United States Senators and a large num
ber of Representatives were Implicated, and
that the land Involved will reach In value $15,
000.000. are without foundation. It can be pos
itively stated that they did not originate in the
Interior Department. The details of the inves
tigation are known to few.
At the proper time a full statement will be
made covering the results of the entire investi
gation and the whole matter will be given to
the public: hut, for obvious reasons, it is not
deemed expedient that a detaiied statement of
the facts should be given at the present time.
The work of the Investigation has been con
ducted by Arthur B. Hugh.' assistant attorney
In the Interior Department, and William J.

It has been the determination of the Secre

WASHINGTON". Nov. l.-The
annual report of W. A- Rich
ards, Commissioner of the
General Land Office, which
was made public to-day, says
that in the past year there was a large
decrease in the number of supposedly
fraudulent land entries over the preceding
rear He attributes this decrease largely
to an order of the Secretary of the Inte
rior dated November 12. 1902. directing
the 'investigation of all entries made in
the States of California, Oregon and
Washington. Under this order alone 10,000
entries have been suspended, and there
nre now fifteen special agents of the Land
Office in that region engaged in ferreting
out the fraudulent entries.
Commissioner Richards says during the

closures of public land, covering an area
of 2 605.SK) acres. Seventy-nine of these
Inclosures have been removed, and pro
ceedings are pending to compel the re
moval of the remaining number. He says,
however, that the total number here men
tioned is only a fraction of the inclosures
maintained in violation of the law. the
special agents having found it impossible
to give attention to many others because
of the order for a special investigation of
th^ entries under the timber and stone
act
Nearly a year ago a repcrt reached the Secre
tary which indicated that frauds of a serious
nature had been and were being perpetrated
. -WASHINGTON, Nov. 1.â The following
statement of the conduct of the investi
gation into public land frauds in the Pa
cific Coast States was prepared at the-Ih
terior Department and given "o"ut with
Secretary Hitchcock's approval:
GUILTY WILL NOT ESCAPE.
Secretary Hitchcock "pnthe Scope of
â¢ '"the Land Frauds.
PRESENT LAW DEFECTIVE.
Speaking of the forest lieu lands selec
tion the Commissioner says there were
5504 of them pending on the 1st of last
July and they Involved an approximate
area of 1,263,136 acres, He recommends a
change in the law permitting the exer
cise of pending laws within the reserva
tion for unpatented land on thÂ« outside,
saying:
In the exchange of land within a forest re
serve for other public land it frequently occurs
that land from which the timber haa been cut
is exchanged for land having timber. This is
manifestly unfair to the. Government, but can
not be prexented under the law. While It is
considered to be impracticable to require that
only land of like value shall be taken in ex
change for land in a reserve. It might be
provided that timber land 'should not be ee
lected in lieu of such land. Just as mineral
land is now excepted from such selection.
Richards also recommends the transfer
of the control of the forest reserves to the
Department of Agriculture. There are at
present fifty-three reserves, covering an
area of 62,365,965 acres. The report con
tinues:
It is a matter of first importance that these
reserves thus far established should bÂ» sup
plemented by such additional ones as are need
ed to form a comprehensive reserve, such as
will insure full protection to the water and
timber Fiipplies of both the Rocky Mountain
and Pacific Coast regions. As yet neither of
tho two groat ranges of these two regions has
a sufficient chain of timber protecting its en
tire length, nor has the matteT of reserving
as many sources of water supply as may be
needed In connection with the irrigation move- '
ment been fully determined.
about one-half of the entire country. The ap
propriation for the past year allowed the em
ployment of only fifty agents and their du
ties consisted In not only investigating and
reporting on alleged fraudulent entries, timber
depredations and unlawful inclosures. but in
no doing a large part of the supplementary
work necf-ssary to establish violations of law
discovered by them.
The flre had been burning 1 gome minutes
before it was discovered. It had started
in the basement and, rushing: upward, had
attacked the stairway leading to the
apartments. In a short time the flames
had so enveloped the stairway that egress
from-the building -was Impossible.- -The
house, from the third to the' iifth floors
was entirely destroyed.
At the windpws, front and rear, bodies
of men and women' were Jammed, show
ing- that a desperate struggle to get free
had resulted in the complete choking of
thipsej exits to the .fire escape and had
been 'the cause' of a number of the in
mates bein* suffocated.
Lying on a bed alongside a window at
the rear, of the -fourth floor < the fireman
found the bodies of five men. Each had
clutched the one^next to him in an en
deavor, to pygh him away In order to get
to the fire escape outside. The features
of the men were distorted, some with
rage, others with agony, and in two in
stances the. rnen..had gripped eaph other
so hard that blood had been drawn and
had run over their hands, .
Oh the third floor were found the bodies
of Nuculetta Vingiguerro Dorset and her
baby. The mother. had crawled to the
front ' window and had succeeded in
grasping the elll before she was suffocat
ed. : In her arms lay the body of her
child. .
On the third floor, in an apartment
where a Halloween-party was being held,
John O'Toole, one of- the occupants,
started to go to the street He was met
by a volume of smoke as he opened the
door. He-ran to the fire escape, followed
by air those in the flat, with the excep
tion of -his, mother, whose charred body
later was found lying in the entrance -to
the apartment.- O'Toole and the others es
caped. ' ' ' .
WhÂ«n the firemen reached the scene
there was a mass of flame bursting
through the middle ot the roof, while the
air was filled with heartrending screams
of the women and the curses of the men.
Many daring rescues were made by the
firemen, who at times had to use violence
in their attempts to disengage the mass
of writhing human beings struggling in
vain efforts to reach safety | from the
crowded fire escapes. One fireman climb
ed to the fourth floor, where a window
was filled with a mass of persons, Jammed
in and fighting to get out. He struck the
heads of all the men he could see with
his fist and they fell back. He then hand
ed down to the firemen on ladders below
three women and a baby. Another fire
man performed a similar feat and res
cued two girls from the fourth floor.
The building was known as "The House
of All Nations" because of the different
nationalities of its tenants.
TRAIN RACES INTO FLAMES.
Continued Prom Page 1, Column 1.
The entire Museum of Inscriptions, the
rooms of Father Ehrle, part of the library
and the printing house were .entirely
flooded by water. It is impossible to
reach even an approximate idea of the
extent of the damage. Many articles were
saved, including some ancient and very
valuable arms, which were recently
moved to the library room from the Bor
gia apartment. Many things that escaped
the flames were injured by water. â¢
The Pope withdrew as Boon as he saw
that everything possible was being done.
Information had been sent to the Italian
authorities. They were courteously in
vited to enter, and did so. Therefore for
the first time since the fall of the power
of the Vatican the Mayor of Rome, and
even Signor Ronchette. the newly ap
pointed Minister of Justice, entered the
Vatican in their official capacities. They
gave orders directing the work and par
ticipated personally in the fight. It was
a very difficult fire to overcome. There
were a.numb* of old and inflammable
objects in the apartment . of M. Marie,
full of combustibles.
The competition between the papal fire
men and the firemen of Rome, to see who
should work the harder and do the most
resulted in a display of courage which
was admirable, some of the fire-fighters
risking their lives â¢ until they were re
strained by their superiors.
At a little after 11 o'clock the flre was
under control, but the work of the fire
men will continue for some time. It is
doubtful if they will leave the scene be
fore to-morrow night. Fresh relays of
men were being sent to relieve those who
have exhausted themselves.
1 veyed to the Pope/ who was found kneel
ing in his chapet for hi.s usual evening
prayer. He insisted on going at once to
the scene, notwithstanding the fact that
he was begged to .think -first of his own
safety. . He .was accompanied by Mgr.
Merry del . Val, the papal secretary of
state; M. BIsloo,- the papal majordomo,
and Mgr. Dellichs, and followed by mem
bers of the Noble Guard.
. The moment he arrived his mind grasped
the situation, and he ordered that the
firemen of Rome be called.. This was done
by telegraph. The - a firemen arrived In
about ten minutes, and although they
brought four engines with them and were
at once ready to .begin operations It took
some time to find the best way to get
sufficient water supply ' with which to
fight the fire.
-In tho meantime the flames had begun
to break out of the windows of M. Marie's
apartment and were destroying the roof.
The flames lighted up tho entire district
and gave the~ impression that nothing
could stop their fury. When the flre en
gines began working three rooms were
already entirely .destroyed and the fire
was extending, to the other apartments. '

MANY OFFICIALS IN THE LAND FRAUDS,
SAYS COMMISSIONER RICHARDS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY^ NOYEMBER 3, 1903.
WASHINGTON, Nov. i. â President. Roosevelt's position regarding the prosecution of those implicated in
the postal scandal and the land frauds is well stated in a private letter he wrote last month to a New York
Congressman who appealed to him. in behalf of State Senator Greene of New York, who has been indicted
for his peculiar relation with George W. Beavers in procuring contracts for postal supplies. This private
letter has been made public, not by the President, but by others; but it makes clear the President's attitude to- '
ward all who have been implicated in the postal scandal. It was one of the complaints that Greene had been in
dicted on by order of the President. In his. letter the President uses plain language â just such language as he
used in the days before he became President. He says: â¢ v ,
"Statement alleged' to have been made by inspectors that I ordered *the indictment of Senator Greene or any
one else is a lie â just as much a lie as if it had been stated that I ordered that any one should not be indicted.
My directions have been explicit and arc explicit now. Any" one who is guilty is to be prosecuted with the utmost
vigor of the law and no one who is not guilty is to be touched. I care not a rap for the political or social influ
ence of any human being when the question is one of his guilt or innocence in such a matter as corruption of the
Government service."
Again the President says:
' "If any one is to be alienated from me by the fact that I direct the prosecution of Republican or Democrat Â¦
without regard to his political or social standing, when it appears that he is guilty of gross wrongdoing, why all I
can say is, let him be alienated. If the District Attorney has anything which should be known to the At
torney General or to me regarding this suit, I should be delighted to see him. But, frankly, I have not the
slightest desire to .see him if his visit is to be in the interest 'of the welfare of the party or of my success.' In a
case like this, where the crime strikes at the foundations of the commonwealth, I should hold myself unfit for this
office if I considered for one moment either my own welfare or the interest of my party, or anything except the in
terest of justice." s . . â¢
PRESIDENT SAYS NO INFLUENCE WILL SAVE

JOHN T. HÂ£BUILL,
(Of Holbrook, Merrill ft. Stetson).
The Itchln. one of the fifteen new type
25-knot torpedo-boats adopted in the Brit
ish navy, built by Laird, has developed a
speed of 25Vi knots with U800 horsepower
on full displacement, and on October 3
averaged 23.64 knots during its speed trial
of four hours. The consumption trial of
twelve hours at 13 knots resulted in the
remarkable low coal consumption of only
1.6 pounds per unit of horsepower. These
boats are 225 feet in length and 540 to 550
tons displacement, with engines of 7000 to
7500 horsepower, giving speeds of 25Â»,Â£ to
26 knots and carrying 95 tons of coal on a
normal draught of 10 feet. Fifteen more

ship between Admiral Dewey and Naval
Constructor Capps and the deliberations
of the general beard are likely to be
more harmonious than they were with
Bradford and Bowles. The transfer of
Constructor Capps from New York to
Washington is apt to prove a temporary
drawback to tht- progress of the battle
ship Connecticut, for it will take his suc
cessor some time to become as familiar
with the work in hand as the predeces
sor was. which will naturally result in
decreasing the progress of work on the
ship building In competition with the
Louisiana at Newport News.
DEATH CLAIMS
ANOTHER VICTIM
There is something strange about the
remarkable excess of power and speed
developed in recent new destroyers in the
French navy. The Carabine, built to de
velop 4800 horsepower and 26 knots, came
up to G429 horsepower and over 30 knots,
and thin is followed by the Bombarde.
making 31.7 knots for forty minutes and
averaging 30.5 for four hours. The excess
cf more than four hours in boats calcu
lated to steam only 26 knots must be grat
ifying to the ministry and offsets to some
extent the disappointment experienced in
battleships, armored cruisers and other
larger vessels, which, with few excep
tions, have fallen short of the require
ments.
Unsatisfactory reports have been made
to the French Ministry of regard
ing the steaming performance of the new
cruiser .lurien de la Graviere, recently
sent out to Martinique. The captain
states that he found it impossible to keep
up 120 revolutions withj ten boilers, owing
to the poor condition of the latter, which
are of the Guyot type. The revolutions
fell down to ninety^ thus reducinc the
speed to 10 knots. ' He expresses the
opinion that while the ship made 23 knots
on trial, the highest speed now would not
be over 20 knots. The heat In the boiler
room ranced from 100 to 150 degrees and
the stowage of ccal was unsatisfactory.
The ship carries a full supply of 900 tons,
distributed in twenty main and fifty re
serve bunkers, and the latter are accessi
ble only by twenty narrow and intricate
passages, making firing under the boilers
extremely laborious even under ordinary
conditions.
yards. The time of firing was limited to
five minutes, during which the 12-lnch
guns fired twelve rounds, making six hits
at the shorter distance, and firing four
rounds with one hit at the longer range.
The 6-inch guns fired forty-eight rounds,
making fourteen hits at short range, and
hit the target fifteen times but of forty
seven shots at 0000-,yaid range.
boats of this type are to be contracted for
during the fiscal year 1903-04.
The battleship Albion of the British
squadron on the China station made some
fairly good long-distance shooting at tar
get practice last September. The target
was 70 feet in length by 23 in height and
the distance varied from 27S0 yards to 6000
"When this became known the Russians
demanded the execution of this officer
within five days, giving as an alternative
the seizure of Moukden. The Chinese
Foreign Office was negotiating with Paul
Lessar, the Russian Minister, on the mat
ter and offered "to banish the officer,
pleading that he had exceeded his In
structions, and. to remove the Taotai, his
superior, from office.
"There was a misunderstanding as to
the time limit set for these negotiations.
The Chinese thought it expired yesterday.
Before the negotiations were completed
the news was received here that Russia
had fulfilled her threat to reoccupy Mouk
den."
PEKING, Nov. 1.â The fact that Vice
roy Alexieff has removed his headquar
ters from Port Arthur to Vladivostok has
caused great surprise In Peking. It is
generally "conjectured that he was unwill
ing to risk passing the winter at Port Ar
thur, which the Japanese undoubtedly
would make a strenuous effort to block
ade In the event of war, thereby prevent
ing the Viceroy from communicating
with his Government.
The Chinese Government is greatly dis
turbed at the reoccupation of Moukden,
the capital of Manchuria, by Russian
troops. The Foreign Office is appealing to
friendly foreign legations for help and
advice, admitting its own helplessness.
The Russians returned to Moukden on
Thursday of last week. â¢ According tÂ« ad
vices received by the Chinese Government
1500 Russian soldiers" took possession of
the official buildings there and barricaded
the gates. There are between 15,000 and
20,000 Chinese troop* In and" about Mouk
den. â¢
The communications relating to Mouk
3en are as follows:
"The Russians employed a noted brig
and, who was accused of many crimes
against the Chinese, as chief of one of
the irregular bands of police they are
organizing in Manchuria. Tha authori
ties repeatedly requested the surrender
of this man and the Russians recently
consented to give him up. Thereupon a
Chinese -officer decapitated the brigand
without giving him a trial.
Bemoval of Alaxieff's Headquarters
to Vladivostok Regarded as
an Indication That War
Is Hear.
The selection of Naval Constructor W.
L. Capps as chief of the Bureau of Con
struction is satisfactor- to members of
his corps and to the service in general.
Mr. Capps is a native of Virginia. He en
tered the service in lSiO and became a
naval constructor in 1S'5, served as super
intending constructor at the Union Iron
Works from .February. 1S96, for about two
year?, when he proceeded to the Philip
pines to raise and rehabilitate the Span
ish vessels sunk by Dewey's fleet. Re
turning to the United States, he was giv
en various duties until March, lfÂ«01, when
assigned to bis present duty at the New
York Navy Yard, where the battleship
<'onnectlcut Is under construction. Mr.
Oapps has the reputation of being one of
the ablest men in the constructors' corps
and also possesses the tact so essential
in Washington, and without which no
man. however able, ran accomplish satis
factory results. There is a cordial friend-
becomes a plain citizen. Isaiah
Har.scom resigned as chief of the
Uureau of Construction in 1S77. by request
cf the Secretary of the Navy, and Theo
dore D. Wilson gave up the office because
of impaired health, but neither these two
nor any other bureau chief severed his
connection with the navy. Therefore, the
re{=!KTia.tion of Bowles as chief of the Bu
reau'of Construction is sensational. Vari
ous causes are assigned for this unprece
dented event. Mr. Bowles entered the
Naval Academy in September. 1S75. was
graduated In June, 1ST3. and was sent to
the- naval school at Greenwich, England,
for a course of naval architecture. While
stni at Greenwich he was appointed asr
distant constructor, and. returning to the
United States in May. 1^, served on sev
eral boards for four years, until Septem
ber. 1SS6. when he was sent to the Norfolk
Navy Yard. He was promoted to be naval
constructor on October 10, 1SSS, and served
at the Norfolk yard, where he built tho
Texas arid Raleigh, until August. 1SD5,
when he was transferred to the New York
Navy Yard, at which yard he rendered
good service, under direction from the
bureau, durirtr the war with Spain. Upon
the retirement of Philip Hichborn, for
age. on March 4, 1P01, Secretary Long
selected Bowles as chief of the Bureau
of Construction. Bowles' resignation and
withdrawal from the navy goes into ef
fect November 3, and his successor. Naval
Constructor W. L. Capps. at present at
tached to the New York Navy Yard, as
sumes control of tho most important bu
reau in the Navy Department.
Mr. Bowles' reason for resigning from
the navy is that he is to become presi
dent cf the Fore River Shipbuilding Com
pany at Weymouth, Mas*. The salary
offered I? undoubtedly much larger than
that of Â£5500 now received, but as an off
Â¦et he ceases to be a rear admiral and
forfeits the pay of S3150 to which he
would be entitled when retired.
Mr. Bowles is well off financially, but
tho sacrifice- of high rank, with its uni
form and soda! status, is a serious mat
ter to a person who has tvÂ»Â»n twenty-eight
years In the naval service. Two other
reasons, differing somewhat from that of
ficially assigned, are rumored, one being
that aÂ«= a member of the Board of Con
struction his views were frequently at
variance with those of the other members
and that his masterful ways were not
acceptable to the board, in consequence
Â«.f which relations became frequently
strained. The other reason given i3 that
he was one of the promoters of the no
torious United State-! Shipbuilding Com
pany, in the organization of which his
estimates of values of plants, contracts
and prospective earninps were made the
basis upon which the trust was built.
For this service Mr. Bowles received
J10.<W cash, $15,000 in bonds and J25.000 In
stock, and it is just possible, if not prob
able, that the Navy Department and Mr.
Howies may have come to some realiza
tion that the chief constructor's connec
tion Â¦with the formation of such a ship
building trust was susceptible of miscon
struction and that his resignation would
save the department an explanation
concerning an act that may. at the
least. bÂ« considered an indelicate trans
action by one of its hiph officials.
FOR the first time in the history
of the cavy a bureau chief has
resigned from the sen-ice and
Ensign Damtnes, secretary of the con
sul, who was with her at the time of the
accident, gave a description of the wreck
and the death of Mrs. Booth-Tucker. Aft
erward Commander Booth-Tucker spoke.
He related an incident that occurred In
Chicago some years ago when he was
Imploring a man to become a Christian.
"If your beautiful wife were taken from
you in a horrible railroad accident, as
mine has been, you would then feel tow
ard God as I feel," said the man. The
commander commented as follows:
"If that man should be in the audience
to-day, I want to tell him that I have
not one rebellious thought against God,
who has visited upon me this catastro
phe."
After the Carnegie Hall cervices, the
relatives were taken to the Salvation
Army barracks, where the regular Sun
day night memorial services were held.
The casket was placed near the platform
and the same, pathetic scenes that at
tended the services at Carnegie Hall were
re-enacted. Colonel Higgins again con
ducted the memorial, during which Miss
Eva Booth was so overcome that she had
to be taken from the hall 'and removed
to her room. ,
The ceremonial partook somewhat of
the character of a military funeral. The
procession moved down the aisle, led by
two standard bearers carrying white sat
in streamers and followed by members of
the general staff. Preceding the casket
was Colonel Hlggins, bearirfg the Bible
and bonnet of the consul. Commander
Booth-Tucker ami his seven children, two
of them babes in arms, followed the cas
ket.
Herbert Booth, his brother, who was
formerly commander-in-chlef of the Sal
vationists in Australia, at the request of
the general remained to represent the
family and, if possible, to say a few
words to the audience. Herbert Booth
twice asked permission from Commander
Booth-Tucker to speak, but each time it
was refused. Commissioner Eva Booth
waa to have spoken, but was too overcome
with grief to do so. At the close of the
services, however, she rendered a prayer.
Cablegrams were read from General Will
iam Booth and Chief Bramwell Booth of
the International Headquarters, London,
at the funeral.
Colonel Balllngton riooth of the Vol
unteers of America did not remain for
the memorial services. According to his
secretary, he had endeavors to' arrange
for a final gathering and short private
services in Carnegie Hall before the pub
lic funeral took place. General Booth ar
rived at the hall three-quarters of an
hour ahead of time and waited for the
family gathering, but, leurning that it
would not take place, he left, saying that
he did not care to stay for the public ser
vices.
NEW YORK, Nov. 1.â Funeral services
over xhe remains of Emma Booth-Tucker,
consul of the Salvation Army in America,
were held this afternoon in Carnegie Hall.
The auditorium was filled to overflowing
and hundreds of persons who had been
unable to gain entrance waited In the
streets until the ceremonies had^ been
concluded that they might file past the
catafalque and look upon the face of the
dead Salvationist. The services, which
were conducted by Colonel B. J. HIgrgins,
chief secretary of the Salvation Army In
America, were most impressive and con
sisted of a musical programme made up
of the favorite. hymns of the dead woman
and by eulogies of her life and of the
good she had done . for mankind. The
grief of Commander Booth-Tucker was
most poignant, and as he knelt by the
bier, sobbing pathetically, the greater
part of the vast congregation wept with
him.

BBATKN IX HER HOME ON CAPP STREET AND WHOSE BODtf

Captain Anderson, Sergeant Blank and
Officers Foley, Daly and Harrison were
quickly on the scene. After them came
Detectives Fitzgerald, Graham, Dlnan,
Wren. McMahon. Gibson and O'Dea. A
search of the premises was made and the
body was sent to the Morgue. Every Â¦
trunk, bureau drawer and closet in the
house had been ransacked and their con
tents scattered over the floor. . -
Nothing had been seen or heard of the
former lodger for several days. Yester
day morning Mrs. Wilson's son left the
house about 10 o'clock, and at that time
both his mother and adopted sister were
in good spirits. When he returned last
night the place was locked and he was
obliged to climb in through a second
story window. After lighting a match at
the head of the stairway he made the
ghastly discovery of the body, and rushed
out to find the, police. Soon afterward
he found his adopted sister wandering
about in front of the house. The little
girl said she had left her foster-mother
some time early in the afternoon, and
that she had come back later and could
not get in. Schmidt was not' in the house
when she left.-
The detectives agreed to wait until
Schmidt returned to the house again, as
he had been residing elsewhere since the
grocery robbery. This was on Saturday.
The woman was asked If she was afraid
of the man and protection was offered
her. but she replied that as long as he
came In the day time she could handle
him alone. She admitted- that he had
threatened ner life, but made little of the
matter.

Mrs. Wilson had made inquiry previous
to this and claimed to have ascertained
that the man she was about to marry did
not work. Then she decided to call off
the nuptials. After being bothered by the
forsaken lover for the return of the wed
ding garments, which she seemed deter
mined to keep, she notified the police and

BAKEHSFIELD, Nov. l.-The Santa Fe
is encountering unexpected opposition in
making its extension through the Sunset
oil fields. As a result, F. E. Henderson,
right of way agent for the company, is
now In the city endeavoring to compro
mise matters with those who are opposing
the railroad's plans.
When the line was proposed, nearly all
the operators in the field welcomed the
extension and aided it in every way, but
trouble is said to have been encountered
with the Superior and Sunset Coast com
panies, across whose properties it was
surveyed. These have refused to grant
the right of way asked for. The reason
for the opposition is said to rest in cor
porations that are building the opposition
pipe line to connect with the present ter
minus of the railroad with the various
properties of the Sunset and Midway
iields. By extending Its line the railroad
will interfere with their business. As the
promoters have great influence and own
and lease to their present operators many
of the properties in the field, it is thought
that they are behind the new opposition.
About a year ago Messrs. Jewett &
Blodget organized the Consolidated Cali
fornia Oilfields Company under the laws
of Maine, with a capitalization of $4,000,000,
backed by French and English capital,
and the pipe line, to cover practically all
the Sunset and Midway fields for a dis
tance of about ten miles, was one of their
chief plans. Their enterprise was encour
aged in every possible way by the oper
ators, who have long been handicapped by
the almost total lack of transportation
facilities existing, In the district. Rights
of way were freely granted and â¢ some
months ago the trench was dug, and now
the pipe is beginning to arrive at Sunset.

At Opitz's saloon the detectives learned
from Mrs. Opitz that Schmidt had been
there about 3 o'clock in the afternoon
and that he appeared very excited. It Is
thought that the crime was committed
just before or after this hour. He took
a drink and went away. At 8 o'clock in
the evening he came again and inquired
for Caspar Wolb. When the latter came
in the two had some conversation in an
undertone and Schmidt went away. Now
the city Is being searched for the suspect
ed murderer.
About 9 o'clock last evening Caspar
Wolb, a cooper, who Is also a roomer in
the Wilson house, appeared at the place
In an intoxicated condition and said that
he had left Schmidt in Opitz's saloon, at
the corner of Eighteenth and Shotwell
streets, but an hour before. Wolb said
Schmidt appeared in an excited condition
and intimated that he was coming after
his clothing: and that he would do some
thing more than take them away. This
statement was Interpreted by Wolb as
meaning harm to the woman and he says
he hastened home to warn her, though
he took an hour to travel but a few
blocks. Wolb's statement was considered
very unsatisfactory and he was sent to
the Seventeenth-street station, where he
is detained.
He may have also been In Quest of
money, as a neighbor's child, on passing
the house last Wednesday, heard the two
quarreling and heard Schmidt insist on
receiving money and say that tf Mrs.
Wilson would give it to him he would let
her alone. The woman pleaded poverty,
but Schmidt would not. accept, her an
swer.
. When the detectives had gathered all
the evidence that could be procured at the
scene of the crime, they came to the con
clusion that Schmidt had visited the house
and. out of revenge, became a murderer.
Just what he was searching for is a mys
tery, but it may have been that he sought
the watch Mrs. Wilson had turned over to
the police.
ONE ABREST MADE.
Among a heap of clothes and boxes that
had been dragged out of one closet was
found the wedding garments, slashed to
threads. Whether the woman did this
that Schmidt could never make use of
them again, or whether It was the act of
the murderer has not yet been ascer
tained. The garments that were worn
by the murdered woman at the time* she
was killed .were also found, torn and tat
tered, as they were dragged Jrom her
body. There were ringer marks about the
throat, a bruise on the chin that possibly
came from a severe kick, and contusions
of the body. It is probable that death
was due to strangulation.

asked the woman's business. The latter
replied that the man had borrowed $10
from her and she was about to demand its
return. When told that her debtor was
absent from the house she said she would
return on the following day, and Mrs.
Wilson, that night, demanded .that
Schmidt meet his alleged creditor. The
meeting occurred, but Schmidt refused to

was a non-union man during the team
sters* strike and shot a man, though he
did not kill him. He is also suspected of
being a burglar.
Mrs. Wilson's husband died about a
year ago. She then rented two of the
rooms in her house as a means of gaining
a livelihood, and several months ago
Schmidt took one of them. There was a
courtship and the two agreed to be mar
ried. At the time of the engagement he
presented her with an open face Waltham
watch on which were inscribed the letters
"A. K." The strange initials puzzled the
lady, but her lover explained that the
watch had been given to him by some one
at the Pacific Mail dock, where he claimed
all the time to be employed. Then he
gave her the wedding garments. They
were not costly, but, nevertheless, were
acceptable. The wedding was set for
Thanksgiving day.
Mrs. Wilson went, to the Mail dock and
ascertained that Schmidt had never been
employed there. Then her suspicions be
came aroused.
There tteems to be little doubt as to
the guilt of the accused and 'seven detec
tives spent the- nigrht in searching for him.
He threatened his betrothed when she
broke the engagement and she was afraid
of him. Just before the crime is supposed
to have been committed he appeared at
a neighboring saloon In an excited condi
tion, took a drink and departed. Five
hours later and after the tragedy had
been discovered, he returned to the same
drinking house and asked to see a man
who roomed in the murdered woman's
house. The two had a conversation
which is very incriminating and the po
lice have locked the lodger up, believing
that he knows more than he is willing to
tell.
Suspicion points to . Charles ' George
Schmidt, a laborer, whom the dead wom
an was to marry, but whom she renounc
ed when she learned of his evil past.
Wedding garments he had presented her
with were found ripped to pieces with a
knife. The garments she wore when at
tacked were found torn to shreds, giving
evidence of a frightful struggle.

The relatives of Mrs. York scout the
theory that York committed suicide or
that he was intoxicated when he met his
death. They claim that tncre 's some
thing mysterious in the death of York
and will ask Coroner Sawyer of San Ra
fael to make a riierid investigation.
The news of York's death will be given
to his wife this morning by her relatives.
Mrs. E. Chalmers, landlady of the house
where York and his wife resided, said last
night that York bade his wife grod-by on
Saturday morning' and had promised to.
return fit 4:30 p. m. to take her to dinner.
When York failed to return his wife sent
for some of her relatives and she was in
a state bordering on hysteria all day yes
terday, owing to the unexplained absence
of her husband.
York was dragged by the rear car for
some distance before the train could be
stopped. When the cars came to a stand
still the train men found that York's body
had been fearfully mangled, and he was
d<=ad when taken from beneath the
wheels. Coroner Sawyer was notified and
the remains were removed to the Morgue.
The only clew to Ihe identification of
York was a Masonic badge found near
the scene of his death many hours after
ward. The badge bore the inscription,
"Mount Moriah. F. and A. M.. and Naval
fommandpry. Vallejo," with tho name
"ttriliam York. "

news to be broken to her.
Brnkeman Charles Axtell said yesterday
that he prevented York from leaving the
train while it was in motion near Corte
Madera tunnel, but after leaving Waldo
Point station Axtell. who was in the rear
car. saw York go out by the front door
onto the platform. Axtell ran toward
York, but before he could reach him York
had .lumped from the train.
On Saturday morning last York left his
wife to go to Sausalito. He had been In
the habit of visiting the pool rooms, but
he was not known to gamble to any ex
tent. His relatives and friends state that
he was not addicted to drinking.
Whether York's death was due to acci
dent or suicide is still in doubt. On Sat
urday night the train leaving San Rafael
for Sausalito had but few passengers on
board, as it did not connect with a ferry
boat for J-an Francisco. York boarded
the train at San Rafael and he stated to
the train crew that he intended remaining
in Fausallto over ntoht.
According to the statements of the train
crew. York tried to leave the train sev

him twelve months before by Klock. had
pleaded to be made one of th? wedding
party. A dozen others, who had been
.chums of Klork and Maynard at Yale.
â¢and had assisted in the Iatter's hurried
nuptials, were ushers at Klock's wdding

lowed.
â¢ Few who have ccanned the register of
th<Â» Palace Hotel during the last three
days have recognized in the signature of
Mabie Crouse Klock of Syracuse, boldly
inscribed on one of the pages, the name
of a your.g man who Is widely known
in the Knickerbocker State, and
who, tut a few months ago, figured in an
elopement that was given considerable
prominence in the Eastern papers.
Mabie Crouse Klock did not elope, but
he wa* mentioned as the friend of Frank
Maynard of Cleveland. Ohio, a student of
Ysle. who startled Eastern society by his
Â¦runaway match with a prominent young
mits of that section of th*> country. May
.rard forsook college duties for the great
er responsibilities of matrimonial life and
in doing so incurred the wrath of his par

that it was developed that Mabie Crouse

menagr-r and financier nf Maynard's
elopement, rimply to oblige the last
Â¦named, who was his intimate chum.
IMMENSE SPOTS
SPECK THE SUN
BILBAO, Nov. 1.â Never in the history
of Bilbao haa there been a strike of such
consequences to the Iron workers of
Spain as that which terminated to-day.
The miners will no longer be . compelled
to live cooped up In the barracks provided
by the mining companies, and they will
no longer be forced to purchase food from
the company stores, which has been often
declared unfit to eat. Instead of being
paid by the month, they will hereafter
be paid every week. They have been re
fused, however, the right to organize.
and.it is believed this refusal will lead to
trouble In the future. According to
statements made by the miners to the
Associated Press and confirmed by their
counsel, they have heretofore lived in de
plorable conditions.
In the mines outside of Bilbao the men
were herded into crowded and squalid
barracks. The food sold them at the com
pany stores was sometimes bad. but, a3
they were paid by the month, it was al
most impossible for them to purchase
elsewhere. The miners were attracted by
the propaganda of Socialists and an
archists, and they determined to strike
unless their demands for better living
conditions were granted. The strike af
fected 35,000 men. There was not a. suf
ficiency of bread in Bilbao, and the min
ers who poured into the town entered
stores and demanded food. On Wednes
day of last week Field Marshal Her
nandez saw that strong measures were
; necessary and he ordered the soldiers to
disperse the strikers. Some of the strik
ers poured petroleum on the Church of
the Jesuits in Bilbao and then applied
the torch, but the troops extinguished the
fire.
Reinforced by cavalry, the troops suc
ceeded in driving the strikers over the
San Antonio bridge. The strikers, how
ever, erected barricades at the center of
the bridge and in front of a junction of
two streets. These barricades were com
posed of pieces of iron work from thu
bridge, overturned carts and barrels filled
with stones. The miners behind the first
barricade were armed with picks, shovels
and revolvers. The cavalry charged
across the bridge, but was unable to pass
the barricade. Troops were then sent to
the right and the left of the bridge to
flank the miners, and a second charge
was made. The bridge barricade was held
for some moments, but the men there
were soon forced to fail back to the sec
ond barricade. This the soldiers also
rendered untenable, and the miners re
treated up the streets, carrying with
them some of their wounded, among
whom were some women. It Js said offi
cially that four i>er8ons were killed and
twenty-one wounded during the fighting,
but more people were wounded than Is
given out officially.
When driven from the city the miners
endeavored to blow up the reservoir and
the electric light plant with dynamite.
The troops were too quick for them,
however, and gained possession of tne
dynamite factory before the strikers could
carry out their design. By this time there
were 10,000 inlantry, cavalry and artillery
men In the city, as well as three guns.
The arrival of Lieutenant General Zap
pine, commander in chief of the Basque
provinces, was followed by conferences
which resulted in a settlement. After
the miners were driven from the city
they pillaged nearby farmhouses and
held the countryside in consternation.
The strike was in no sense against the
Government.
CHICAGO. Nov. 1.â A woman's Hal
lowe'en crank early this morning; started
trouble which ended in the killing: of
George A. Alrle, chief of police at Mor
gan Park, by Mack Wiley, a young ne
gro. Mrs. Sayman. who is a sister of
Wiley, and three friends started out for
a lark. While they were overturning a
lumber pile, it Is said, the woman was
struck by Chief - * Police Atrie. The ne
groes went for reinforcements and upon
their return a second meeting with Airie
resulted in a fight in which Airle was
Btabbed in the necK by Wiley.
The news of the tragedy spread through
the suburbs and soon a crowd of several
hundred men and boys inarched to the
Morgan Park jail, where four of the ne
groes had been looked up. While the place
was surrounded by a mob clamoring for
vengeance, several shotguns being in evi
dence in the crowd. Wiley and his com
panions were placed between a number
of police, who had been summoned from
Harvey and other nearby suburbs, and a
dash was made for a carriage, that had
been sont for. A severe fight followed, in
which the negroes were severely cut and
bruised with sticks and stone?, but th<?
Officers finally managed to get the negroes
in the carriage and drove off under a
shower of bricks, stones and other mis
siles. The prisoners were taken to the
Englewood jail, where Wiley confessed to
having killed Airle.

The record-breaking handicap singles
tennis tournament, which was commenced
on the park courts four weeks ago. was
completed yesterday. A large crowd was
In attendance and two of the three
matches played were worth going: far to
see. Clarence Griffin, the crack young
player from the park, carried off the
honors, beating Will Allen in the finals.
The winner's work is commendable, con
sidering the large entry list and the mark
from which he played.
The final match gave promise of being
the most interesting of the tournament,
but was marred to an extent in the third
set, when Allen was attacked by cramps.
At this stage of the game it was set all and
3-0 in Allen's favor. Allen obtained but
one more game In the third set, the score
being 6-4 in Griffin's favor. After a long
rest Allen resumed play and fought game
ly until the end. In the fourth set he led
at 5-2 and looked to have the set won.
He was unable, however, to get the one
game needed. The score was 6-2, 4-6,
6-4. 7-5.
Griffin played a clever game and his vic
tory was a popular one. Alien, the Cali
fornia Club man, showed his ability in
handicap play when he allowed Griffin
odds of "owe 15" and did as well under
the circumstances.
The semi-nnals were played in the
morning. In the opening match Herbert
Long of the California Club, with odds of
"3-16," lost to Griffin, who "owed 2-6."
Long played a splendid game in the
earlier rounds and was thought to have a
good chance to reach the finals. Griffin
led all the way and the outcome was
never In doubt. Long was extremely wild
and undoubtedly had an off day, while
the park man was at his best. The score
in Griffin's favor was 6-1, 6-3.
The other semi-final match was one of
the closest and most exciting seeen for
some time. The contestants were Will
Allen (owe 15 2-6) and George Janes
(scratch). Janes with the same handi
cap beat AlacGavln last Sunday and con
sequently was a slight favorite. He won
the first set, &-7, but it was anybody's set
up to the last point. The second set was
also close and was won by Allen. 6-4. The
third set brought out the great struggle.
First one was ahead and then the other,
until Allen finally won out. 9-7. The
match spoiled Allen's chances in the finals.
Giving Janes such a handicap and pulling
through by such a small margin was a
great strain and was undoubtedly the
cause of Allen's cramps. He has .never
been called upon to give such heavy odds
before.
The tournament was the most success
ful ever held on the public grounds. It
was so large that even with five courts
it took four Sundays to complete It.
Following are yesterday's scores:
Semi-finals â Clarence Griffin (owe 2-6)
beat Herbert Long (3-6), 6-1. 6-3; Will
Allen (owe 15 2-6) beat George 'Janes
(scratch), 7-9. 6-4, 9-7.
Finalsâ Griffin (owe 2-6) beat Allen (owe
15 2-6), 6-2, 4-6. 6-4, 7-5.

NO SCORE FOR OCCIDENTALS.
Five goals in the first half and one goal
In the second half were made , by the
Vampires of the California Association
Football League in the opening game,
played yesterday with. the Occidentals on
the Webster street field, Alameda. The
vanquished failed to score a goal, but
their. work in the last hair was far su
perior to that displayed In the opening
half. Most of the members of the Vam
pires were veterans at the sport and used
their knowledge" of the tricks and turn9
of the game to telling advantage against
their ambitious but less sclenced oppo
nents. With the advance of- the season,
the admirers of the \ Occidentals assert
the team will render a good account pf
itself. Ten minutes after the referee's
whistle sounded the Vampires put the
ball fairly in the net,- Wilding scoring
the goal. During, the. first half the b"all
was for the greater part In the territory
of the Occidentals. Toward the close of
the last half the Vampires were kept busy
trying to prevent . the Occidentals from
tallying. Lloyd,, center halfback for the
Occidentals, put up a brilliant game,, his
all-around tackles being a. feature. Pres

SUMMARY.
Schwartz's Costly Errors.
OAKLAND, Nov. 1.â In a game that was
not remarkable for a display of team
work or for â¢quick, snappy playing, the
Oakland Hornets defeated the Albion Ro
vers at association football . this after
noon on the grounds at Idora Park. TThe
final score of 3 to 1. The playing on
both sides was what might be called
"ragged." This was due somewhat to the
lack of team work. In which the players
have had no practice. The field was re
sponsible for some of the Dad. plays, too,
as it was lumpy and hard to run upon.
The strong kicking and sure placing of
Johns and Gillchrest were the features
of the Rovers' game, and the all-round
work of Chalmers, William Pomeroy,
Hunter and Cowell that of the Hornets'
playing. The teams were composed' of
the following players:
Oakland Hornets â Williamson, Mildred. Wil
liam Pomroy, McKay. Chalmers, Bird, Hunter,
E. Pomeroy, Shand, Hlndshaw, Cowell. . Â¦ .
Albion Rovers â Moran, Johns, Lancaster,
Bayne Robertson. Smith. Churchill, A. Orton,

P. J. Horgan, the Concord coursing man,
repeated his victory of some weeks since
in the Futurity by- winning the rich
Junior Champion and H. J. Crocker cup
stakes yesterday at Union Coursing. Park.
His successful representative was Donny
brook, a black son of Wild Tralee-
Manila and a brother of the Futurity win
ner, Irvlngton Tralee.
Donnybrook defeated In Time, Concord
Tralee, Equator, Our Motto, and, in the
deciding course, Cubanola. The latter
scored â¢ the first five points and then
Donnybrook rolled up a winning sequence
of seven. At this juncture Cubanola lost
sight of the hare, which, it apparently
thought, had" made' good its escape.
Donnybrook continued in pursuit, but the
hare finally escaped before he could get
another turn out of it. ,
Sixteen of the thirty-two hares used In
this stake made good their escape.
The open stake was won by Belle Free,
which defeated Tralee Boy in the deciding
course. This was a close* contest, the
greyhounds running neck_ and neck to the
hare. Belle free then pulled out, turned
the hare and killed. The results in detail:

JUNIOR CHAMPION
FOR DONNYBROOK
SOME EXCITING MOMENTS DURING THE FIRST ASSOCIATION FOOT
BALL GAME OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE SEASON, PLAYED YES
TERDAY AFTERNOON ON THE PRESIDIO ATHLETIC GROUNDS.
After Antrobus and A. Disher had been
ruled off, each team was one man short.
Conception played as goalkeeper for the
Independents for the rest of the match,
the halfback line consisting of only two
men instead of three. A goodly number of
spectators watched the game from the
grandstand.

The Thistles had the best of the play,
but a thoroughly efficient goalkeeper
might have stopped all three of the'balls.
The Independent team was unlucky in
losing the services of Antrobus, one of^the
strongest goalkeepers In the California
League, early in the first half. A. Disher,
one of the Thistle, forwards, stepped on
the chest of Antrobus In a melee and An
trobus struck him on the jaw. Referee
Irish ruled both players oft the field for
the rest of the afternoon.
The ball was kicked off shortly after
2:30 p. m. and during the first half the
play was pretty even, the score standing.
Thistles 1 goal. Independents 0. For the
Thistles, Duncan and Taylor, halfbacks,
rendered valuable service, and the two
fullbacks, Tierney and Forest, played a
steady game.
During the second half the Independents
made some determined rushes but were
unable to put the ball between the posts.
Smith scored a second eoal for the This
tles and Lydon, the center forward, after
some good dribbling, made a third goal.
Neither side scoring again, the game end
ed. Thistles 3 goals. Independents 0. For
the winners R. A. Disher, T. Disher and
Lydon played well, while for the losers
McGran and the Fay brothers showed to
the best advantage. Lynch, one of the
Independent backs, is not In his usual
health, but played a good game. Neither
team was strong in combination work,
the season being too younjj as yet. The
Independent team was caplalnÂ«d by Me
chels and the Thistle eleven by Forrest.
C. P. Irish acted as referee. The teams
and the positions of the men were as fol
lows:
day by the Thistle team, which
defeated the Independent eleven 3 goals
to 0 on the Presidio Athletic Grounds.
THE opening match of the season

Mike Fisher led his Senators away from
the ereat metropolis yesterday evening.
No racra will the merry band roam over
the green at Recreation Park this season
and perhaps the fans will not behold the
cmilin^ countenances of many of them
again. But ere they made their get
eway the law-making tossers scalped the
Cripples twice, 4 to 0 at Oakland and 5 to
2 at EUrhth street.
Both tames savored of the real cream
cheese and were full of the life and the
action that make the fans Â«rrow noisy.
For eix Inning it was 1 and 1. Then the
Senators got busy and also corraled the
luck. Just enough of it to carry them
through. They were the first to register
and their tally came in the < initial
round, when Casey stung one to Dever
eaux that came too fast to field. Hilde
terand bunted cleverly and McLaughlin
went out to first, putting Casey on third.
Then Graham grew unruly and balked, so
Casey trotted In.
- The Cripples landed in the fourth. Kru
â¢gÂ«*r bingled to ripht and Messerly sacri
nced. Devereaux got a scratchy one to
the pitcher and when Gorton worked for
"a base the bags were all occupied. Gra
ham hit a slow one to Casey, who smoth
ered it. He tourhf-d Gorton out as the
latter tore to second.
Then there was a rough house. Krujer
.scored on the play and as Casey was
about to toss the sphere to first and make
a double play his hand went wrong and
the ball fell out of his mitt. The Senators
â¢gathered around the umpire and each
'man averred that Gorton had interfered
with Casey. Jim refused to be touted by
the i>erformers and so the run counted.
The Senators soon forgot about their
alleged slight ar.d began to p'.ay the game
a?ain. Mr. Esan's double was an eye
opener for the seventh, and when Shee
han bunted and Graham threw the ball
;lnte to third to stop Truck it looked bet
ter. Graham flew out to left and Egan
was ciiusht at, the plate by j. pretty
throw, completing a neat double 'play.
' It seemed the Senators would not do a
thing, but the next three were passed by
the erratic Graham, the last man; Casey,
forcing Sheehan in. Hildebrand tapped
-aut a single and Knell and llogan arrived.
Thfn Casey and Hildebrand tried the
double *teal and after considerable ma
neuvering Casey was a dead one at the
plate, but Mr. Gorton failed to hold the
ball, so the run scored.

Republican nominee for' Supervisor that
he wishes to vote for. If he does not do
this the election officers will not know
what two candidates of the party he in
tends to vote against and will therefore
count only for the two Democratic candi
dates. The safe rule for Republicans to
follow is to stamp the X in the circle at
the head of the Republican column and
then stamp an X opposite the name of
every candidate of his choice, being care
ful all the time to keep within the Re
publican column. As the Democrats are
in the minority in this city, the candi
dates of that party are particularly anx
ious that the independent - Republicans
should go to their assistance. Republi
cans are beginning to understand that Re-
Dublican victories cannot be won by vot-
er and Eugene E. Schmitz. The lines are
distinctly drawn. It is true that quite a
number of citizens entertain kindly feel-
Ings toward Mr. Lane, but he is bo far

Square, the Republicans will close the
campaign of speechmaking with two
grand demonstrations. Eloquent speakers
will address the multitude. Rock
ets, red fire and music will be
features of the occasion. The speeches
will be short and to the point.
Every speaker will be expected to adhere
to the five-minute rule. As no hall large
enough to accommodate the throng of
expected attendants could be engaged,
the committee decided to hold the meet
ings on the street. Republicans expect
to cast 25,000 votes for the ticket of their
party at to-morrow's election and the
number voting the straight ticket will be
surprisingly large, as there is a general
apprehension - that election officers who
will be called upon to construe the new
ballot law may not give a proper inter
pretation to the act.
Henry. J- Crocker, the Republican nom
inee, leads in the race for Mayor. He has
gained strength steadily since the hour

strong indications that the Republicans

Ex-chairman governing commit
tee, Union Labor party.
I was one of the organizers of
the Union Labor party and chair
man of its governing commit
tee for the last two years. I
helped to elect Schmitz and in
doing so was subject to all kinds
of abuse. Since Schmitz's election
I have stood by the Union Labor
party until the present time. I am
utterly disgusted with the manner
in which affairs have been con
conducted and the manner in
which Schmitz, as a union man,
has acquitted himself.
Those who know me know that
my actions have been guided
solely by principle, and I cannot
longer stand the Union Labor
party, which has been converted
into a machine for certain persons
who are looking for "graft" and
nothing else.
I am a consistent union man
and believe in upholding the prin
ciples of unionism. The Union
Labor party, as it is now, is a
perversion of what w r as once a
party of principle.
I appeal to my friends and
union men at large who are sup
porting the Union Labor ticket to
think seriously over what I say,

HENRT J. CROCKER, REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR THE OFFICE OF MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, WHOSE
ELECTION OVER HIS OPPONENTS, EUGENE E. SCHMITZ OF THE UNION LABOR PARTY AND FRANK
LIN K.. LANE, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, SEEMS TO BE* ASSURED. ,
6will let vice have a full swing in San
Francisco.
Ruef, as the attorney and agent of the
Mayor, is making promises and agree
ments as to what Schmitz will do in thÂ«
event of re-election that ought to dis
qualify the Mayor from holding office.
Some of these agreements are in direct
violation of the law relating to elections.
Stories told relating to shady transactions
in the raising of money to enable Ruef
to squander coin in the campaign for
Schmitz would fill a page of this paper.
It is asserted positively that one Joint on
Ellis street was squeezed for $1600. Aii
other joint was held up for $600.
If the people of San Francisco knew 'of
the true state of affairs in the Ruef camp,
the stampede of honest voters to Henry J.
Crocker would bury the Ruef regime be
yond all hope of political resurrection.
In anticipation of the general opening up
of all kinds of vicioua and degrading
Joints under the protection of Ruef,
gambling in violation of law is" already
in full swing in several sections of the
city. Let every honest citizen ask, "How
can Ruef afford to spend $50,000 for the re
election of Schmitz?"
LAB.B TAKES ALARM.
Honest promoters of the Union Labor
party who gave their support to Mayor
Schmitz two years ago are taking alarm,
knowing that the party which they helped
to organize will be held responsible In a
measure for the degradation that will
fall on San Francisco in the event of
Ruef's continuation at the head of munici
pal affairs. It Is no surprise that promi
nent labor leaders are joining hands with
other good citizens to save the city from
the disgrace of Ruef domination. If
Schmitz Is re-elected, Ruef will sit down
at the .Mayor's desk and appoint all the
commissioners provided for in the charter.
A prominent Democrat remarked Â¦ last
night: "Ruef's reign may become so op
pressive and intolerable that a vigilance
committee may be necessary to protect
the community."
Attention of Republicans and Demo
crats, Union Labor men and non-par
tisans, Is directed to the frank and manly
statement of Henry J. Crocker published
herewith. Mr. Crocker is an honorable
man. His election to the office of Mayor
will reflect honor on the city and Impart
new life to Industrial enterprises. He ap
peals to the. intelligence, the patriotism
and the spirit of public enterprise in the
citizenship of the community for support
at the elecUon to-morrow. His only com
petitor in tho race is Eugene E. Schmitz,
a man who may mean well, but whose
weakness and general unfltness for the
office of chief executive of the city must
be plain to every clear-minded citizen.
Schmitz is owned, controlled and ex
hibited by Ruef. If he were so minded he
could not emancipate himself from the
Ruef environment, because Ruef discov
ered him, brought him to public notice
and is now supplying the means to parade
him before the people.
At a meeting held yesterday by the
Brewery Workmen the action of Secre
tary R. Speck, who announced that the
union was solid for Lane for Mayor, waa
repudiated. George Hook, secretary of
the executive committee, announces that
the members of the union are left free to
vote for whom they please. They deny
the right of any member of their union
dictating to them how they shall cast
their votes.

present administration. H. MARCHAM,

Department one year ago at Christmas, when their families were
required to go without their holiday pleasures. 1 know that Hen

every pledge he has made to give us good government.
CHARLES STEGGAR,

Does Lane, in the absence of Democratic strength, expect
Republicans to leave their party and support him? If he does, he
is making a great mistake. Republicans are not built that way,

HENEY ?. CHOCKEB.
Mr. A. D. Porter, who was employed at the
Mare Island Navy Yard at that time, was do
ing his best tor take t ha' transport" work away
from this city, ably backed by Abe Ruers man
for Mayor, Schmitz, who went to Vallejo sev
eral times to help Porter out and who was
taken by' Mr. Porter to the navy yard and in
troduced by him to the commandant of the
yard. Mayor Schmitz by his action In this
matter broke his pledge to the workingmen of
this city made. In his Inaugural address, in
which he said:' :-,:â¢
"I favor decidedly the establishment of the
principles that goods of home manufacture
should be given preference in all supplies for
public institutions. This I believe to bo in
thÂ© Interest of the manufacturers and mer
chants and Â¦workingmen of this city, who* pay
our taxes and support our local government,
as against foreign and external manufacturers
and merchants who take their profits hence and
contribute nothing to the support of our gov
ernment, our Institutions or our wage earners."
Mr. Porter at that time was a member of
what is known as the Trades and Labor Coun
cil of Vallejo. I never could find out what
that organization was composed of, or what its
objects were, outside of the fact that, like
Mayor Schmitz. they were great dispensers
of hot air.
Mr. Porter saw fit to denounce as untrue
the statements I made In my letter published
In The Call of June 21. 1903. At a meeting
of this hot air organization, held at Vallejo
on June 23, 1903, Mr. Porter offered a set of
resolutions headed: "Answer to letter of
Thomas McConnell, ex-president Shipwrights'
AsFociation of San Francisco." Mr. Porter stated
In his resolutions that the highest wages are
paid mechanics at Mare Island. He denounced
as untrue that the worklngman must forego
his union principles when he works at Mare
Island; that he is deprived of any privileges
whatever; that wages are lower than else
where and that first-class workmen will not
work at the navy yard. He stated that the
wages paid the workingmen there are equal
to the highest paid In the vicinity anoV that
Inducements were offered for the best work
lngmen of every craft to seek employment at
Mare Island.
The concluding part of my letter states:
ABLY BACKED BY SCHMITZ.
The Examiner at that time was making tre
mendous efforts to drive trade away, from San
Francl&co and the business men and working
men of every class that were employed on
transport work and who were treated right
and whose unions were respected by their em
ployers. ,
The Examiner and Lane's backers were seek
ing to drive that work away from San Fran
cisco in the Interests of Vallejo. Seattle, Brem
ington and other places. In my letter I stated
some facts to bhow that every Interest of San
Francisco demanded that that work should re
main here, and gave positive proof that the
workingmen of this city received higher wages
and better treatment, our unions were recog
nized and we were granted every privilege and
fair play that was possible to give, and the
rules of our unions were strictly complied with.
I also stated in my letter that labor unions
have no voice in the conduct of affairs In any
department of the Mare Island Navy Yard.
The worklngman hts to leave his unionism
in Vallejo, and tho moment he strikes the
yard he has to work against every principle of
unionism, manhood, honor and fair play. He
Is deprived of every privilege it Is possible to
take away from him. Privileges cheerfully
granted by the most exacting of private firms
are high crimes at Mare Island. Wages paid
at Mare Island are lower than those paid by
private firms in this city-
Owing to a system of grading. Mare Island
has become the dumping ground for Inferior
mechanics of every class.
On. June 21, 1903, The Call honored me by
publishing my letter of protest against the at
tacks of the Examiner on our employers, the
business men of this city.
Now, sir. If you will allow me, I will prove
beyond the shadow of a doubt to the working
men of this city that Mr. A. D. Porter Is an
enemy of every interest of San Francisco and
the workingmen of this city, and a friend of
scabs.
THE Henry J. Crocker Water Front
Republican League, Thomas Mc-
Connell president, proves beyond
the shadow of doubt that Mayor
Schmitz was In the scheme to take the
transport repair work from, the working
men of San Fruncisco and transfer It to
Mare Island. Thomas McConnell tells the
story in the following communication:
HEADQUARTERS OF THE WATER
FRONT UNION MEN'S HENRY J. CROCKER
CLUB, Nov. 1, 1903.â Editor Call: It Is
amazing even to tho workingmen themselves to
observe the methods adopted by the hirelings
of Hoss Abe Ruef to deceive and mislead the
workltigmtn of this city and array them as a
class against their employers and the business
men of this city. Their latest move I find to
be a circular letter headed "Union Men and
Fellow Workers, Attention!" signed by A. D.
Porter, Business Agent Boilermakers and Iron
Shipbuilders oÂ£ America. Said circulars are
distributed all over the city, telling the work
lngmen that politics will not disrupt their
unions and denouncing those union men as
cowards and fakers who are advising the work
ingmen to keep their unions clear of politics.
Mr. Porter is telling the workingmen to vote
for that '"tried and true friend (of Bobs Ruef),
Eugene E. Schmitz. and let that be your union
motto," he mys.

REGISTRAR WALSH SPEAKS.
Gives Frank Advice to Voters of the
City.
Registrar Walsh last night made the
following statement for publication in
The Call:
"After deliberate reflection I have
reached the conclusion that a voter who
desires to vote a mixed ticket should not
stamp the circle at the head of any party
column, but should place the X after the
name of every candidate for whom he
desires to vote."
J n explanation of lhe foregoing the
Registrar says he reaches the conclusion
from the fact that it takes too much time
to educate the election officers Into in
tricacies of the new ballot law. If a vot
er desires to vote a straight ticket the X
should be placed inside the circle at the
head of hia party column."
Register AValsh estimates that the vote

"It is a positive fact that large numbers of
first class mechanics in San Francisco of
every trade will not work at the navy yard,
for the reason that they can get better wagea
and better treatment in this city, clear of
spotters and spies, where they can call their
souls their own. where they can stand for
their rights like men, and where the only
qualifications required In seeking employment
are faithful service and mechanical ability.
Therefore, It seems to me,, as a worklngman,
that the business Interests of this city â that
the Interests of the working .classes of this
cityâ demand that the transport work, or any
other work shall not be taken away from San
Francisco in the interests of Vallejo or any
other place. We should center all our forces
for the protection of the business Interests of
this city, and for the advancement and pros
perity of San Francisco and the working
classes." . ...
In answer io Mr A, D. Porter's resolutions
I furnished the following facts to the Trades
and Labor Council at Vallejo on July 12 190-.
I furnished them with a statement published
in the Vallejo Evening Chronicle of August 6,
1809, which stated that on that date Congress
man Metcalf State Senator Luchslnger and
Thomas McConnell were before the wages
board endeavoring to have the wages of ship
wrights raised to the standard of $0 per day,
which the wages board stated were unvarying
in San Francisco, where there was never
known to be more than one- class or snip
wrlghts. At Mare Island there are four classes
of shipwrights, with four scales of wages
ranging from $4 24. first class, to $2
class Senator Luchsinger furnished the
wages board with facts gathered from the em
ployers and business men of San Francisco,
which chowed that the wages paid the wo rk-
Ingmen at Mare Island were from 24 cents to
r,Â« cents per day less than the wages paid in
this city, and he stated that where there are
so many ratings In every trade it is difficult
to get first class men at Mare Island,
"in a statement Published in the } allejo
Vvenlnc- Chronicle -of July 10, 18w, It was
Sd that the wages paid the following
trades all of which have four classes, Js far
b^ow that which 13 paid by private firms, and
t hitmen m> elsewhere to work in preference to
etayC at*?he Navy-yard, and states that^nly
a 'ew days ago cards were sent out for ten
machinists. Jo wl\lch only five reÂ«IÂ»n*|a- ; The
trades mentioned Ve : Sparmakers and ship
wrights, blacksmiths, flange turners and heavy
foreers house Joiners, house carpenters, drill
ers! riveters, shipsmiths and shlpfltters and
blockmakers.
POOR WAGES AT YARD.
The Vallejo Times of July 18. 1890, state,
that a worklnRman receiving $3 per day in
San Francisco ia doinc better than a man a
tbe Navy-yard getting $3 75 per day, and [that
at the Navy-yard the men are compelled to
pay ?2 per month to the Mare Island Ferry
James McCudden stated aUmÂ«t
in* of the Merchants' Association of \ allejo
hit work aV the Navy-yard is very unsteady
and that In forty years he never saw wages
so low. This statement was published in
the Vallfljo Jlorninx News of July 25, 18S*.
In a statement published in the Vallejo
Chronicle of September 17. 1809, It is stated
Sk? none but sSabs and rats will .accept & em
ployment at the Navy-yard. The Vallejo
Morons News tells us that "there can be no
effective denial of the a-sertion that
in San Francisco get greater wages than men
doing similar work on the yard.
The following resolution was passed by the
American Federation of Labor In annual con
vention assembled:
-Whereas. There Is a law In the United
States navy-yards which divides the various
trades and occupations into several ceases
and the power to class men is invested in the
foreman, as a result of which many first-class
men are classed as second and thlnl class,
and who must either accept the decision or
quit their Jobs, and believing that only first
class men should be employed in all depart
ments of construction and repair of united
States vessels, therefore be it
"Resolved, That the executive committee of
the American Federation of Labor is hereby
instructed to assist all unions to have said
laws amended so that there is only one class
under which men shall be employed at the
standard rate of wages."
Mr. Samuel Gorapcrs, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, tells us that we insist
and bear in mind the fact that in aiding our
fellow workers in the Government employ wa
have no right to lose sight of or hazard the
Interests of the great body of workers em
ployed by individual companies or corpora
tions. But enough of this. Mr. Porter knows
those facts as well as I do; he also knows that
I could keep on stating them for the next
week. Where were you, Mr. Porter, when I
was fighting for the men at Mare Island? I
never saw you there. 1)0 you undertake to
tell the boiler-makers how they shall vote?
Mr. Porter, I have been well known to the
boiler-makers of this city for twenty years,
and they know that I was always their friend;
and I know, Mr. Porter, that the boiler-makers
are the best union men In this State and that
they were always on the firing line in all the
Iron workers' battles; and I know that they
will allow no men or set of men to tell them
how they shall vote, while you, Mr. Porter and
Mayor Ituef-Schmitz, were trying to force the
work out of this city to be done by scabs I
was helping the boiler-makers to get work. I
attended their meetings and helped them all I
could and I succeeded In getting employment
on the transports for a number of boiler-mak
ers from my own employer at that time, Mr.
Ben DalleruD, at the highest wages, shortest
hours and best treatment that boiler-makers
ever received in this city.
We want no anarchists here, Mr. Porter. The
workingmen of this city will not allow them
selves to be arrayed . as a class against their
employers, Mr. Porter, by you, Ruef-Schmitz
or any one else. The business men of this city
are all "right, Mr. Porter, and the working
men of this city are going to elect Henry J.
how lhey shall vote, while you, Mr. Porter, and
thereby inspire confidence in our employers,
the business men, and keep prosperity and
happiness among all the people, and keep in
San Francisco all the work we can get. To do
that the Republican party is the party for us,
and Henry J. Crocker Is the man. Respect
fully yours. â¢ THOMAS McCONNELL,

TACOMA, "Wash., Nov. Lâ Mayo Lake,
adjacent to the Stewart River in the Brit
ish Yukon, has its bottom lined with gold.
How to secure the golden riches is the
problem now confronting mining engineers
of tho Klondike.
Five rich gold-bearing: creeks are
drained into Mayo Lake. For centuries
they have been sweeping 1 their auriferous
deposits into its bottom. Strangely
enough, the lake is bottomless so far as
soundings have been made to ascertain its
depth. Its shores were prospected this
summer and found to contain gold in
paying quantities. Ledge and Steep
Creeks, on which rich pay dirt was struck
last summer and which are now yielding
good results, flow into Mayo Lake. Mln
to and Hlghat, two other rich creeks, flow
into Mayo Lake on the opposite side.
Ledge Creek forms a delta extending
into the lake a quarter of a mile. At the
farther end of the delta the accumulation
of grave land silt comes to an abrupt
termination. With almost a perpendicu
lar face it deflects Into a subaqueous
abvss. The gravel of the delta Is found
rich in gold.
These facts lead Neeland, the Canadian
Government Surveyor, and other engi
neers to conclude that untold riches He at
the bottom of the lake. Nevertheless,
the lake seems to He in a great caldron
or crater of such depth as to make gravity
drainage probably Impossible. It is much
deeper than Stewart River and could not
be carried off in that great natural artery.
Above towers a huge range of mountains
containing gold quartz ledges, from which
flow into the lake numerous auriferous
streams. The lake is twenty miles long
by one and a half to two and a half wide.
Soundings at the mouth of Ledge Creek
failed to find bottom after reaching a
depth of 900 feet.
The Ottawa government will be asked
to investigate, through some of Its best
engineers. Stewart River miners belleva
the lake's bottom would produce more
gold than the entire Klondike.

Estimate of Champlain.
In Harper's Magazine for November
Henry Loomis Nelson gives a word-pic
ture of the career of Champlaln, the ex
plorer. Here Is his estimate of his char
acter:
"Champlaln Is one of the noblest char
acters of early American history. He was
one of the great navigators of a time
when a voyage across the Atlantic was
taken at the risk of life. He was a perse
vering and patient worked, a keen judge
of men and a careful and accurate ob
server. He was an excellent man of_busl
ness. He was enthusiastic and inspiring,
and had wonderful self-control. He was
devout and religious, but long experience
bred in him a philosophical Indifference
to theological disputes. He had no van
ity and was unselfish and self-sacrificing.
He was 'â¢ humane. He was possessed of
the mysticism and superstition of his
time; not so deeply, however, that he
could not meet with conquering ridicule
the deeper mysticism and the mere child
ish superstitions of his savage friends.
He was not only a good and courageous
navigator, but he was a brave and skill
ful soldier. Above all, he not only inspired
men with his enthusiasm, but invited
their confidence, from the Kins, nobles
and merchants of France to the savages
of the woods. In some degree, even as.it
was then given to Frencnmen to under
stand the art of politics, he was a states
man; he coutd settle disputes justly and
satisfactorily, and he could administer the
affairs of the community under bis charge
with the reculslte skill."

Uses of Compressed Air.
BY MAL/COLM M'DOWELX,.
(Author cf "Shop Talk on the Wonders of the
Craft")
Just now the wires and pipes are fight
ing each other. Electricity and com
pressed air are keen rivals for supremacy
In the industrial field, and the "rooters"
for the condensed atmosphere are jubi
lantly declaring: that compressed air has
scored the .most points. ,
They exclaim, "Without compressed air
there would be- no automobiles, for. thi
horseless vehicles cannot run without
pneumatic tires.- Were it not for com
pressed air railroad trains would be
obliged to crawl along at - twelve miles
an hour, for fast trains require the safety
and control of automatic air brakes.
"We admit that the electrical current
is superior to compressed- air in the mat
ter of operating trolley cars and trans
mitting power over long distances, but in
ether things mechanical and operative,
where the two jare competitors, com
pressed air has its frisky rival beaten."
All the claims of the compressed air
men are not based on facts, but it is
unquestionably true that in almost every
machine shop, foundry, stone cutting es
tablishment, railroad shop, naval yard,
quarry, mine, boiler shop and industrial
plant of any importance in this country
one can hear the clicking and snapping
of air compressor valves and the trem
ulous noise of . the pneumatic tools.
Pneumatic tools are operated by air
which has been compressed until, in its
effort to break through Its metal bounds,
it exerts a pressure as high, sometimes,
as 3000 pounds to the square inch. The or
dinary working pressure, however, varies
from forty to one hundred pounds. When
It Is compressed to this degree, air is a
vivacious, mobile and exceedingly elastic
spring. It is quite easy to comprehend
the marvelous flexibility and wonderful
responsiveness of this aerial spring when
one watches the chisel point of a pneu
matic hammer in the hands of a stone
worker and is told that the hammer is
making sixty strokes every time the clock
ticksâ 3600 blows a minute. The blows are
so rapid they cannot be distinguished.
They sing a trembling note, but there is
no sound of successive blows.
Some of these pneumatic hammers 'ook
like monstrous revolvers, for they have
pistol grips with which the workmen
steady the tools. A flexible rubber pipe,
screwed onto the cylinder of the hammer,
leads to the supply main which runs back
to the reservoir or air receiver. In this re
ceiver the air is stored up by the air
compressor, which is . operated by steam
direct or by a belt from a stationary en
gine or gasoline motor. The compressor
is a force pump, which sucks the air in
with one stroke of its piston and Jams
it into the receiver on the return stroke.
Suitable check valves prevent the air from
popping back from the receiver to the
compressor cylinder, ; so that every stroke
of the compressor's piston makes the air
more compact until the desired pressure
is reached and held.
" That which makes compressed air pop
ular with men of the crafts Is the fact
that It operates hand tools. The pneu
matic hammer Is hammer and tool in
one. In its barrel-shaped casing Is con
tained a little air engine with cylinder,
piston, -Â»iston rod, slide valve, exhaust
valve, throttle and packing. The piston
rod holds the tool and the blows are de
livered ty its in-and-out movements.
A pneumatic hammer, used for, driving
rivets an inch and a quarter in diameter,
weighs about twenty-five pounds, strikes
620 blows a minute and uses up twenty
five cubic feet of free air a minute. The
hammer used by sculptors and stone
workers for carving is eight inches long,
weighs three and a half pounds, strikes
3GC0 blows a minute, using five cubic feet
of free air doing It The big riveting ham
mer has a etroke nine inches long. The
little pistol . grip stone hammer has a
striking movement of but half an inch.
The riveting hammers work under a pres
sure of 100 pounds to the square inch; the
little stone hammers use air sixty to
sixty-five pounds pressure.
I.i a recent test an air drill bored fifty
four holes flfteen-sfxteenths of an inch
in diameter through three-quarter-inch
steel boiler plate in one hour and ten
minutes. This same work by. hand would
take eig.** and one-half hours.
Pneumatic tools are used for heavy
and light, cutting and riveting, for dress
ing granite and other building stone, for
carving marble, chipping metal, cleaning
castings and, in short, for. doing anything
that can be done by a man with a ham
mer, "and "^Uoing It better.'? V f - " i j..V-"- :
THERE was some improvement in trade conditions
last week, and the depression ivhich marked . the
preceding two or three weeks appeared considerably
modified. Cooler weather stimulated retail trade, and the
jobbers reported more movement, chiefly in winter clothing
goods, such as woolens, footwear,' etc. Industrial activity
is also reported improving, many plants lately idle an
nouncing a resumption to-day. The Eastern wholesalers
and jobbers likewise send in more encouraging statements
of the condition of trade in that region, while in the West
and Northwest the crops are moving much more -freely,
and this has communicated a perceptible animation to col
Â¦iectioOT, which h|v|Vr^tt^fere i lagged. The textile mills
I still report business lagging somewhat, though their reports
j are more reassuring than for some -Weeks .back.
The condition* seems to be that the fall trade, is at. last
fairly under way, and that the recent dullness was largely
caused by the backwardness of this autumnal movement,
rather than by any intrinsic decrease in business. " If this
be the case business ought to improve from now on. The
j bank clearings emphasize these more cheerful reports, as
! the decrease last week, compared with the - corresponding
week last year, was only 12 per cent, with the majority of
the leading cities on the right side of the exhibit, instead
i of the wrong side, as heretofore." New York shows a loss
of 21.5 per cent, though that is undoubtedly caused by
the sharp falling off in the volume of stock speculation
and in the decreased valuation of stocks.
The shrinkage in trading in Wall street was pronounced
last week. On. Friday the volume of business was -only
168,500 shares, the smallest day's business of the year.
There was not much inclination to operate on either side,
J both buyers and sellers appearing indifferent. Values of
j shares weakened, owing to a rise in the rates for call loans,
I caused by shipments of funds to Chicago, New Orleans and
I St. Louis, the remittances to the two former cities being to
move the crops, and those to the latter city being to fur
nish ready funds to sustain the financial market there, as
well as to supply the cash for the crop movement. St.
Louis was more or less disturbed by a run on several
banks, but, as in the case of Baltimore during the preceding
week, the disturbance was shortlived and immediately
checked by the announcement of the institutions concerned
that they had plenty of funds to meet all demands. It is
noteworthy in this connection that whenever the banks
of any city find themselves in a temporary corner and de
ranged by the sudden demands of depositors, the great
financial interests of New York at once rush the necessary
cash to that city and thus relieve the stringency. This is
an excellent plan, as ' it ' immediately checks the panicky
feeling and restores confidence. It is quite a modern pro
ceeding and on the improved lines of current financiering,
and saves many a tottering institution, to say nothing of
restoring public confidence.
Wall street itself is a tame place at present. It is
thought that the excessive liquidation of the past year has
been practically completed, as current liquidation is mo
mentary, being confined to a single day, and then on a
much smaller scale than heretofore. The election excite
ment, too, has affected trading more or less, as all lines of
business, both legitimate and speculative, always languish
just before elections. As the country will have a Presidential
election next year we may therefore expect more or less
dullness from now on, especially if there be much talk of
possible tariff legislation.
â¢ There is not much new to report in the staples. â¢ Quota
tions a're not fluctuating much at present, and while the gen
eral tendency in prices is toward a lower level, as already,
mentioned, it is so gradual and smooth that it is almost im
perceptible. The iron and steel market,' which is generally
considered one of the best barometers to trade, is quiet;
but there is ho further decline to report, though there is
no longer any rush to order goods ahead, and the cash
buying is restricted to the immediate needs of the pur
chaser. The labor situation continues unsettled, restricting
building operations more or less everywhere/ though it is
not as acute as for some months back.
â¢ Briefly, trade conditions show a perceptible improvement,
and there is much less pessimism abroad, while the feeling
that prosperity is still to prevail for some time to come
seems to be increasing.
FROM recent outgivings it is apparent that Russia pro
poses to dispute the sovereignty of China over Man
churia. This will be presented iii such form as to
attack the interests of the United States, by denying China's
right to make with us a commercial treaty opening the
Manchurian ports of Moukden and Antung to our trade.
If China's sovereignty over the province of Manchuria is
complete and unimpaired, it is her right to make that treaty.
No doubt if Russia had only China to deal with, she could
bully her claim to success. But she has to deal with the
United States. That Russia has no Sovereignty over Man
churia, cognizable by the law of nations, is evident. She
joined the other Western powers, \. including the United
States, in occupying parts of China for a base, while the
united armies . marched t upon Peking .' to rescue the im
prisoned legations of the nations, they represented. That
was at that time the sole reason and Excuse for the presence
of a single Russian soldier south of the Yalu River. When
the legations had been rescued, and Peking had been made
safe -for the return of the Emperor and the Empress
Dowager, who had fled to the . south, the representatives
of the powers, including Russia, agreed to evacuate the
territory they had occupied for the temporary purpose that
had been accomplished. They all kept this agreement ex
cept Russia. She stayed in Manchuria and greatly increased
her military force in that province. The purpose of this
became apparent when she presented to* Li Hung Chang
a treaty to sign, which practically dismembered the Chinese
Empire. The Russian army was there to coerce China
into such a treaty. Li refused, and the representatives of
Russia brutally invaded his bed chamber and kept up their
threats and importunities around his death bed, but the
stout old man would not purchase a peaceful death by
surrendering his country's sovereignty over Manchuria.
Then followed another promise to the Western powers
that Russia would keep her word and leave Manchuria, at
a date, fixed. This new probation was used in trying to
enforce upon China the extraordinary demands of last
spring, about which the Russian Foreign Office did the worst
point blank lying ever known in civilized diplomacy. After
she failed she fixed the 8th of October to keep her word
and evacuate. That date is gone by a fortnight, and instead
of sending troops out of the province she has sent more
in and has reoccupied Moukden and Antung, and denies
China's right to open those ports to our trade. Our new
treaty awaits ratification by the Senate. As soon as rati
fications are exchanged an American merchant ship should
be cleared for Moukden, convoyed by a fleet of our war
ships. If she is refused entry to Moukden, by Russia, con
clusions should be tried at once. Our executive recognizes
the sovereignty of China over Manchuria, and we should
not permit for a moment the attempt by Russia to abridge
our right to treat with that sovereignty.

EVERY business man, employer and working man in San Francisco knows that the industrial
future of this city is to be profoundly, affectedv by the election of MayorV The taxpayers
have voted to endow schoolhouses, parks and other public concerns, with nearly $18,000,000,
the expenditure of which is to be inaugurated and its ultimate benefit to be determined by
the manner in which the Mayor elected to-morrow will use his power and by the degree of business
experience and personal integrity he will bring to the discharge of his duty. Bring the situation home
to yourself, you voter who reads' this. Suppose that you had $18,000,000 of your own money to invest
for the improvement of your.personal estate and fortunes., and were seeking guidance and counsel in
doing it, and your choice were limited to Schmitz, Lane and Crocker, which would you choose? You
know perfectly well that, granting their integrity to be equal, you would choose the business man,
Crocker, and would do it not intending any reflection upon the character of the others.
Diminish the sum to be invested down to the share of the $18,000,000 which every taxpayer
must invest through the tax on his property, and whether the share be tens, or hundreds, or thou
sands of dollars, his decision would be the same. From this view of it no thoughtful man can escape.
If a voter make choice uninfluenced by that view, then he is controlled by sentiments that are, not cen
tered in the public welfare. He is influenced by considerations of class, of partisanship, the hope of
personal aggrandizement, or by prejudice. If the question were put . to any audience that listens to
Schmitz or Lane, all who are influenced by proper civil motives would shout their preference for
Crocker as agent and adviser in such a purely business transaction. Mr. Lane for some time, and
Mayor Schmitz for a shorter time, have lived on politics. Mr. Crocker never had and will never
have to. His living has been made in business pursuits and what he has, which lifts him above any
sordid motive in public life, was accumulated by his own exertions. It was won in fair business. He
has no dollar that belongs justly to another.
The testimony comes from all the wide borders of the State that his expert business faculty has
benefited his fellow citizen. He has not been a selfish accumulator, disregarding the rights of others.
The grapegrowers look at this contest from their far vineyards^ and send to their fellow citizens of this
city Their warm approval of Mr. Crocker, because he organized their industry, saveel it from destruc
tion and put the profit into their hands, which had earned it. Has anybody heard of any business
achievement of that kind by either Schmitz or Lane? No. They are politicians, good politicians no
doubt, but they are occupied in pointing with pride to themselves and viewing each other with alarm,
and have made no record of action beneficial to business or to the interests of others.
To vote for either is to throw away a ballot, if the man who casts it have a just idea of the
purpose for which a May:* is elected. To vote for Lane is folly, for it is a vote to strengthen Schmitz,
and the Mayor stands condemned by those who were partisans of his first candidacy. Every man's
civic dutv is laid upon his conscience as aliigh duty, or should be, and" he may discharge it well to
morrow by selecting a Mayor just as he would choose a man for adviser in his personal business.

The man who is married has something
tangible for which to save his money. It
may be only a pair of drawing-room cur
tains, or a new dining-room table, or It
may be a house of his own and a compe
tence to insure the woman and children
he loves from financial distress In case of
his death. This last named Incentive Is
one of the strongest In the world, and, I
think, one of the holiest.
It leads the erstwhile spendthrift to
economize. And on economy rests the
whole structure of wealth. It makes him
no more content with the salary that once
seemed ample, but nerves him to harder
work, to new lines of enterprises. And
on hard work and enterprise are reared
every improvement and every invention
the world has ever known.
The average man must have some par
ticular object for which to save money.
(Just as the schoolboy seldom lays by
part of his weekly allowance unless for
me purpoBe of buying some article dear to
youthful hearts.) And what object so
real and eo desirable as the happiness and
well-being of thope. he loves?
Your eccentric "flower-to-flower" man is
seldom a success in life. Nothing so quick
ly tones down these tendencies and
steadies a man's every effort as does mat
rimony.
Many a man has been drawn Into
drunkenness and other dissipations for
which he had no natural bent simply be
cause he was lonely. Such men do not
make good financiers. Marriage, by re
moving the cause, removes the disease,
and the erstwhile man about town be
comes at test of real use in the business
community.

The little home, the woman in whose
pure eyes he is a hero and can no no

answers th<Â» click of his latchkey In the
doorâ if these do not form a trinity of in
centives to bring out all that Is best in a
busimss man. then nothing short of a
miracle from on high could urge him on.
This same trinity do more to save the
Integrity of business houses than do all
the lr.ws and Dolice forces and prisons
ever created. Where the single man may
fall into financial temptation, the married
man will think twice before he brings
shame on the woman who adores him and
disgrace on the children who look on him
as a god. The statistics showing the vast
preponderance of single over married
men In prisons will substantiate this.
In days, too. of hardships and ill for

their sting when shared or soothed by a
good woman.

Receiver Smith then relates at length
how the shipbuilding directors accepted
the offer, increased the capital stock.
mortgaged the plants and delivered the
stock to Young. The receiver continues:
It appears that, with thÂ« exception of the
Unicn Iron Works, the subsidiary companies,
taken together, had absolutely no working cap
lt&l: but. on the contrary, their liabilities ex
ceeded their r*Â»ourcÂ«8 In the turn of $294,
718 83.
The following- was the rendition of these
companies at the time of their purchase:
Deficit â Bath Iron Works. $3518 74; Cres
cent Shipyard Company, $403,192 25: Harlan &
Hollinirtworth Co.. J73.Â«13 44: S, T. Moore. &
Sons' Company, f5C$9 27- total, I4S5.CC3 73.
Surplusâ Eastern Shipbuilding Company. $1.
310 34: Hyde Windlass Company, $1S5,4S3 Ob;
total S1&O.844 40.
Net deficit, being- the excess of liabilities
over assets. 9294.71& 33.
The Union Iron Works, It was found,
had a working capital of J2.213.150.
As the principal part of the alleged
working capital mentioned was confined
to the Union Iron Works, he concluded:
It will appear that, to far as the remaining
companies arÂ« concerned, when taken over by
the United fctates Shipbuilding Company they
not only had no working capital, taken collect
ively, but were In Immediate need of financial
AsslcUnc*.
Frcm the foregoing facts it appear* to have
been the intention of those responsible for the
statements and fig-urea alleged to have been
relied upon to mislead and deceive the Invest-
In* public and the then present and future
creditor* of the company.
Receiver Smith then quotes from the
In connection with the purchase of the
stock of the Union Iron Works of San
Francisco Henry T. Scott and Irving M.
Scott were to agree to enter into a con
tract with the shipbuilding company not
to compete with it in its husines? and not
to employ their capital or to pfrsonally
engage !n any shipbuilding business for
the period of ten years, and the company
was to contract to engage O. W. Dickie.
R. Forsythe and John T. Scott as officers
cr managers for five years at annual sal
aries of $10,000. \V. H. Gould a? mining en
gineer for five year? at 110,000 per year,
Lawrence E. Scott as assistant con
structor at $5000 per annum for five years.
W. P. Scott as assistant to the president
of the shipbuilding company for five years
at the annual salary of $5000, H. A. Scott
as assistant to the engineer in chief for
five years at 13000 per annum and Edward
Gunn as assistant chief draughtsman for
three years at $3000 per year.
The offer of the Harlan & Hollings
worth Company, the Eastern Shipbuilding-
Company, the Crescent Ship Yard Com
pany and the Samuel L. Moore & Sons'
Company also contained conditions dis
advantageous to the purchaser.
The agreement mith the Bethlehem com
pany placed the United States Shipbuild
ing Company entirely in the hands of the
Bethlehem company and its principal
stockholder, Charles M. Schwab, the re
ceiver contends.

Newman "was elected president, Dailey
vice president and Seward secretary and
treasurer. Wood, Gould and McLaren
were, at the date of incorporation, all
connected with the Corporation Trust
Company of New Jersey, and the direct
ors were employes of said company. At
this meeting the offer of Promoter John
Young to turn over to the United States
Shipbuilding Company the several con
stituent plants waj= submitted, the terms
for- the sale of the stock of the compa
nies being as follows:
far as the records of the. company dis
close.
Continued Fiom Page 1. Column 7.
The action of the Bethlehem Company
in withholding earnings of upward of
$2,000,000 annually was, says Receiver
Smith-, "with the apparent purpose of
bringing- about the destruction of the ship
building company."
The report concludes with a discussion
of the condition of the constituent com
panies under the receivership, showing
that the receiver had possession of all but
the Bath and Union plants, but claiming
that so long as the present board of di
rectors of the Bethlehem Company is re
tained no benefit will accrue to the re
ceivership from this company. The re
ceiver is convinced that the present inter
ests in control are wholly hostile to the
shipbuilding company and are endeavor
ing to circumvent legal proceedings, and
that a separate receivership Is necessary.
One or such causes was the fact that the di
rectors parted with bonds to an amount upon
which it was Impossible to meet the Interest.
Th? failure, however, v.-as precipitated, if not
directly brought about, by the fact that in the
Bethirhem transaction the United States Ship
building Company officer* had to deal with
peopie who. while thoroughly understanding
the Intricacies of "higher finance," seemed to
have overlooked the requirements of common
fairness.
The receiver charges that the properties
of the various constituent companies were
sold to the United States Shipbuilding
Company for an amount which the ven
ders of such properties knew to be far
in excess of their face value and that the
plan to combine such properties was con
ceived and consummated by certain pro
moters with full knowledge of its Injus
tice to the United States Shipbuilding
Company, the company being absolutely
without intelligent representation or pro
tection in the matter. Smith continues:
The report then gives the net book
value of the constituent companies on
July 31, 1902. according to accountants"
statements from the books of the com
panies, as S12.441.516, for which the di
rectors of the I'nited States Shipbuilding
Company parted wfth J7 n ,9T7,000 in stocks
and bonds. It continues:
Viewing the arqulJition of the properties
from the standpoint of the surplus and plant
values as disclosed by the pooka of the com
panies, the directors appear to have made a
gift of upward of $.15,000,000 worth of stock
ani bonds of the United States Shipbuilding
Crmpany intrusted to their care.
It may be said that Rethlehem deliberately
ured up Kb earnings in making enormous pur
chases, of material for Its own benefit, and In
extension, improvement* and repairs. In order,
apparently, to keep Its earnings from the Unit
ed States Shipbuilding Company.

A. G. Simpkins. speaking of the. incon

A meetinc of the three firms waa
called later in the day at the house ot
J. W. Thorp, when the situation was con

The piemakers made a demand on th^
firms that the time of baking shouid b<Â»
changed from right to day and there trus
also a demand for higher wages, which,
it is claimed, is the third demand in nins

John Shea, driver of a milk wagon for
the Guadaloupe Dairy, Fifteenth avenue
and San Bruno road, was found at
Twenty-First and Valencia streets about
3 o'clock yesterday morning by Police

from wounds In his head. Shea told the
officers that while making his . rounds
he was attacked by John McLeod. a ship
wright and two brothers named Walsh
and beaten on the head with milk cans,
which they took from the wagon.
Shea's explanation of the attack was
that the "Walsh brothers had been em
ployed by the Guadaloupe Dairy but
were discharged and he got one of their
lobs Thev threatened for that reason
to assault "him on the first opportunity.
Shea was sent to the City and County
Hospital, where his wounds were stitch
ed and dressed. He said he â¢ would
sswear out warrrants for the arrest of
the three men this morning. McLeod

The old whaling baric Charles "W. Morgan
was the subject of much Interest on the city
front yesterday. All day long crowds of men.
women and children stood on the bulkhead
off Howard street, where she is lying, and
speculated upon the different experiences she,
must have encountered since she was launch
ed In New Bedford sixty-two years ago. She
Is the oldest of the vessels in the service oi
the whaling fleet, and the oldest vessel in the
harbor. While she la a relic of the past, she
is still vigorous enough to bring into port a
cargo of 1150 barrels of olL She Is now fully
discharged and will soon go to anchorage to
prepare for next season's visit to the north.

Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyndall In
structed, entertained and mystified a
large audience at Steinway Hail last
night. The subject of the psychic science
lecture was "The Truth About Spiritual
ism," and it proved to be one of the most
attractive of the Sunday evening series
so far given by the famous Investigator
of. the mysterious phenomena of life.
Among the many marvelous demonstra
tions given by Mclvor-Tyndall last night
was the "Dead or Alive" experiment,
which seems to prove the existence of the
soul's immortality. The lecture dealt
with the principles of spiritualism. He
said that faith in immortality Is tho fun
damental principle of spiritualistic hy
potheses, and that therefore all who be
lieve in the existence of the soul, after the
change called death must perforce be
spiritualists. The large audience was
thoroughly in harmony with the lecturer
and listened to bis arguments and theo
ries with raot attention. Next Sunday
evening Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall will endeavor
to make clear some of the misapprehen
sions regarding the Influence of hypnotism
in crime. "Hypnotism and dime" will
therefore be the theme for discussion
next Sunday night.
The Village Quartet rendered several of.
the ancient and much-admired melodies
In a way that made many of those present
smile a eweet. ead .-mile and think of
olden days and other charming, voices
which had warbled the samÂ« soft tunes."
The quartet is well balanced and sings
in'uiiTSon: Its members wound up their
turn with a few popular selections, all of
which pleased the multitude.
The two Roses rendered several pretty
songs that won for them rounds of de
serving applause. Max Waldron Is here
again in his variety. His impersonations
in female roles are as good as of yore
and his voice as changeable as ever.
Cllvette Is a Juggler and magician that
can hold the attention of any audience aa
long as he performs as he did list night.
His tricks are all new ones and are exe
cuted with a smoothness and dexterity
that is bewildering. Hi3 exhibition ' of
Juggling was extremely clever.
The holdovers, McWatters and Tyson.
Crawford and Manning, the Three Rich
ards and Wenona and Frank, are as en
tertaining as they were last week. Mc-
Watters and Tyson are especially good in
their novelty sketch. "Scenes in a Dress
ing Room." The introduce many catchy
songs and pretty dances and the light and
costume effects are something out of the
ordinary.
The usual first appearance of the all
star acts at the Orpheum last night were
received with that usual appreciation
that attends the coming out of all the
good things In the vaudeville line. There
are probably more real favorite* on the
bill this week than have appeared at the
popular variety house for many moons,
and, in fact, each turn possesses some
thing all its own that appeals to all ad
mirers of vaudeville.
The minstrel man might be the whole
show if Haverl> would allow him. But
there are other good things which round
out the bunch of fun in which Van is the
centerpiece. Eddie Leonard, who holds
down the chair opposite to Van, is no
slouch of a blackface. He can sing some
songs In a very good stage tenor and he
has some dance steps which would do
credit to the human snake in a world's
greatest side show.
Besides the two end men there Is a
chorus of good voices. The Young broth
ers do some high-class work at tumbling.
Marcus and Gartelle have a good turn on
roller skates. Mazier and Codey are
heard in parodies. But bestde3 these there
Is Billy Van again, and, like the adver
tisement, that' is " 'noagh said."
When Billy Van comes on at the end
of the first turn and announces that he
will sing the touching ballad, "Mamma's
Teeth Will Soon Fit Sister," ne has the
house with him at once. Then hv lets off
a lot of new ones in his remarkable rapid
change voice. You catch yourself nudg
ing your neighbor's ribs and you don't
even remember to offer an apology. None
are needed. â ',.
It's that flabby, wobbly mouth of Van's
which does the business â that red streak
In the black cork which draws itself into
an exclamation point when the climax of
the gag Is reached. There has been noth
ing like it since poor "Hoot Moa" "Whelan
died. Any joke that comes from such a
clam's mouth as that must take. You
laugh when the laughter about you is so
strong: that you don't catch ihe gag Itself.
Have you got melancholia? Go to see
Billy Van. Are you suffering from bone
spavin, housemaid's knee or 'cholera ln
fantum; can't sleep any more: never can
laugh any longer; see black spots but
don't see' a joke? "Well. then, go to see
Billy Van, and before the show is out you
will have written your testimonial. A man
who has been twice sued for alimony
within a year and whose uncle died with
out leaving him a cent was there last
night and his guffaws were something to
sit up and think about of n!ghtÂ«.
The Gotama' s trip was unsuccessful
and her search for whales was in vain, as
no monsters of the briny deep came with
in gunshot of the ship. Her entire cargo
consisted of two walrus hides, forty
pounds of ivory and seventy-five gallons
of oil.
The schooner Gotama, Captain Macom
ber, arrived In port yesterday, twenty-one
days from Fox Island. She reports that
on October 23 a block fell from the rig
ging and struck James May on the head,
killing him Instantly. The unfortunate
man was' a native ol Ireland and aged 33
years. The body was buried at sea. with
appropriate services the day following
the death.

BRISTOL, Tenn., Nov. Lâ Robert L.
Brown, president of a prominent coal
company in Wise County, Virginia, is
quoted to-night as having said that on
Friday afternoon the Wentz family re
ceived tidings of Edward Wentz, the miss
ing young Philadelphia millionaire.
A shrewd looking young man, it is
stated, appeared at the Wentz mansion at
Big Stone Gap, Va., and requested a con
ference with Dr. John S. Wentz, father of
the missing young man. He was admit
ted, when he told Dr. Wentz that his son
was ali^e and well and that he had been
authorized to say that for $100,000 young
Wentz, who was then in handcuffs in the
Cumberland 'Mountains, would be deliv
ered to his family unharmed.
Dr. Wentz, It is said, told the stranger
that he would have first to bring him a
letter from his sdn as an evidence that he
was alive, and that then his. proposition
would be considered. The stranger agreed
to this aVid immediately left for the
mountains. He was shadowed and' was
Been to get off the train at the mining
village of Esserville, when he disappeared
in the direction of the Cumberland Moun
tains. He Is expected to return to Big
Stone Gap by to-morrow. Meanwhile the
detectives are keeping a sharp lookout
and startling developments are antici
pated. Â¦. .Â¦Â¦/'*.

MYSTERIOUS STRANGER
ASKS FOR A RANSOM
SYDNEY, X. S. W., Nov. 1. â It has been
learned that the British steamer Overlau. be
longing to the Union Steamship Company of
New Zealand, caught flre and sank oft Lord
Howe Island (between Port Jackson and Nor
folk Island and about 400 miles east of Syd
ney) on October 20. All the steamer's pas
sengers and crew were saved.
TACOMA, "Wash., Nov. 1.â J. S. Church
ill of New York has arrived from Wales
Island, formerly of the United States and
now a parcel of Canada, to ascertain how
the annexation of the Island to British
dominions will affect the operations of his
big salmon cannery. Churchill is vice
president and general manager of the
Wales Island Canning Company, which
owns the only property on the islands
ceded by the boundary commission to Can
ada other than a few huts built several
years ago by the American Government.
Churchill regrets his annexation to Can
ada and expects the result will be to close
his cannery at least temporarily. The
cannery packed 33,000 cases of salmon this
season. Its product has heretofore been
shipped to Now York. Now that the island
has become Canadian territory he will be
compelled to pay a duty on fish brought
ilere for consumption. Besides it must
employ its Chinese cannery laborers In
British Columbia instead of the United
States.

PROFESSOR MOMMSEN
DEPARTS THIS LIFE
Eminent Historian Dies at Charlot
tenburg Surrounded by Members
of His Family.
BERLIN, Nov. -1.â Professor Theodore
Mommsen, the historian, died at Char
lottenburg at 8:45 o'clock this morning^
He passed away without regaining con
sciousness, the change from life to death
being observed only by his attending phy
sician, who watched all night long with
the family.
United States Embassador Tower and
other foreign Embassadors hero, as well
as a number of Cabinet Ministers, called
at the Mommsen residence this morning
to inquire how the sick man was and were
informed that he was dead.
Emperor William and various other
lesser German sovereigns have sent their
condolences to the Mommsen family.
NAPA, Nov. 1. â A disastrous flre broke out
on the ranch of Sam Walker In the lower
end of Wooden Valley Friday and burned over
800 acres of tho Walker ranch and part of
James Ream'e ranch. â
REDDING, Nov. 1.â In attempting to
write their names at a higher point than
a name had ever been written before on
the precipitous walls that enclose Bear
Creek Falls, four miles from Shingletown
In this county, yesterday afternoon, Grov
er Albery of Shingletown and Miss Atlanta
Adams of Etna Mills, Siskiyou County,
slipped and fell.
The young lady landed on the top of a
small tree eighty feet below. Her right
leg was broken in three places. Albery
continued to the bottom of the cliff, a full
100 feet, and was rendered unconscious,
but escaped serious injury. That both
were not killed is considered almost a
miracle by the physician who was called
from here to attend the injured girl. Four
other members of the pleasure party
spending the day at the falls found it
necessary to tear up articles of their
clothing to form a rope with which to get
Miss Adams, who was perfectly helpless,
out of the tree top.
After Albery and Miss Adams had
scaled 100 feet of the precipice, which is
but five degrees out of the perpendicular,
the young man's foot slipped on a moss
covered rock. It would not have been
necessary for the young lady to have
fallen, but Albery had hold of her hand
In assisting her upward and failed to let
go.
Two carloads of dynamite which ex
ploded In the Pennsylvania yards were
the cause of the excitement. Yardmaster
Courtier and Clerk Gersinger, who were
at work in the yard office a half mile
away, were seriously and, possibly, fatally
hurt by the destruction of the building
in which they were working.
Hundreds of Pennsylvania railroad em
ployes are at work searching for the dead
and injured. The entire west yard of the
road is a complete wreck. Officials of the
railroad say forty-five 1 cars were demol
ished. Where the explosion occurred a
hole twenty feet wide and twice as long
was torn in the ground. Men at work a
mile away were thrown from, the track. â¢
In the downtown portion of the city
there is not a building that has not suf
fered considerable damage. Many per
sons who were on the street were cut and
otherwise hurt by flying glass, and scores
of women are In a serious condition from
shock and concussion.
All of the physicians of the city are at
the scene of the wreck to assist those
who may be found injured. The sidewalks
and roads are littered with glass from the
shattered panes. The Mayor has sworn
in many extra policemen to guard prop
erty.
All of the churches were holding ser
vices when the explosion occurred. Doors
were blown off and windows smashed in
many of the buildings. The full extent
of the loss to property will not be known
for many days.
It cannot be learned until daylight
whether there has been any loss of life.
The wrecked cars are burning.
The explosion was plainly heard fifty
miles away.
All the switching crews of the Pennsyl
vania j-ard have been accounted- for.
Mansfield heard the report of the ex
plosion and sent fire apparatus by a spe
cial train shortly after the report came
of the great fire that was rasinsr.
There are thirty tracks in tho Crestline
yards, all of which have been more or
less damaged. The main tracks are -piled
ten feet high with dirt, bent rails, car
trucks and other railroad machinery.
CRESTLINE, Ohio, Nov. 1.â Crestline
and vicinity were in a panic to-night aa
the result of a terrible explosion at 8
o'clock. Many buildings were shaken and
in some instances the walla fell. Church
congregations were stampeded. Residents
who were at home were terrified.
The facts are these: The Crows, Arapa
hoes and Sioux go backward and forward
every fall during the game season on
visits to one another, and during these
annual pilgrimages they wantonly slaugh
ter all the game in sight and incidentally
kill a steer or fat sheep now and then.
They are charged also with stealing
horses from the settlers. Efforts have
been made to put a stop to the outlawry,
but always without success. .Recently
the authorities of Weston County deter
mined to stop the unlawful practices and
Sheriff Miller was instructed to arrest the
Indians. The latter became warlike and
refused to either desist or get out of the
country.
A large party of special deputies, with
provisions and medical supplies, accom
panied by surgeons, left Newcastle late
to-night for the scene of the battle. The
party will Join In the chase and the sur
geons will care for the wounded. It is
reported to-night that Sheriff Miller is
not fatally wounded.
Governor Chatterton was advised of the
trouble and probably will send a company
of soldiers to the scene to assist the sher
iffs and tHeir posses In running down the
murderers. The companies at Newcastle
and Buffalo have been instructed to hold
themselves in readiness to take the field
In case troops are needed.
The ranchmen and others in the vicinity
of the battle are hurrying to the scene.
The Indians are headed for the Bad
Lands of Western Nebraska, and, being
familiar with the country, they may be
able to reach the Pine Ridge Agency be
fore they are overtaken. Once within the
reservation, they wiM be practically safe
from pursuit and identification.
A serious outbreak among the Indians
is feared, for It is known that they have
been in an ugly mood for some time. They
complain that the Government does not
supply them with sufficient food and they
are compelled to hunt and slaughter the
livestock of the ranchmen in order to live.
GO UPON ANNUAL FORAYS.
TROOPS ARE IN READINESS.
CHEYENNE, Wyo.. Nov. l.-A(5vlces
were received here this evening of a bat
tle fought late yesterday afternoon fifty
miles north of Lusk, Wyoming, on Little
Lightning Creek, near its junction with
the Cheyenne River, between a posse
under Sheriff W' H. Miller of Weston
County and a band of twenty-flve Crow
Indians under Charlie Carries Elk.
The Indians had been slaughtering
game and killing, the cattle and sheep of
settlers and the officers attempted to ar
rest them. A portion of the Indian party
was captured and the wagons, stock and
game confiscated and sent back to New
castle, but the bucks got away and led
the officers a long chase through Weston
and Converse counties. The posse came
upon the Indians on Little Lightning
Creek last night, just as they were going
into camp for the night. Only meager
details of the battle have been received,
but it Is known that Sheriff Miller was
wounded and Deputy Falkenburg killed.
Three . Indians were killed* and several
were wounded. Two or three deputies
also were wounded.
