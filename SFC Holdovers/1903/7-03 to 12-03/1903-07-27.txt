Desperate Fight Occurs in
Jail After Shooting
of Officer.
The alarm was piven and the town
thrilled with the pews. The citizens gath
ered for quick action and haste was made
to arrest the murderer. The three broth
ers of Casey led the pursuit. Demartini
was overtaken a short distance from
town and was called upon to halt and
surrender. Demartini did nothing of the
kind. Apparently he had come to a real
ization that the payment of a complete
penalty for his crime was inevitable. He
turned in his flight and fired at his pur
suers.
The. ""bullets~from Demartini's revolver
went wild, but these from the weapons of
the brothers of the man he had cruelly
murdered found the mark. The three
brothers of Casey opened fire on the
hunted man and came very near riddling
him with lead. He fell at the first vulley
and when the posse reached him it was
found that he had been mortally wounded.
Demartini is in a hospital here to-night
and may die before morning. He has
made no statement regarding the affair.
Casey, the man he killed, was a native
of this place. He was young and ex
tremely popular.*
The residents of the town are very
much excited to-night and there has been
some talk of lynching, but Sheriff Graves
has prevailed upon the people to allow
the law to take its course.
OAKLAND. July 20.â News of the
shooting at San Andreas was received here
to-night and Mrs. Richard McSorley, a
sister cf James Casey, the deputy con
stable who was killed, .left immediately
for San Andreas.
Thorn had a metal bucket in his hand
and. jumping over the body of Casey,
smashed the head of the murderer. Then
there was a desperate battle between the
Deputy Sheriff and his assailant. It last
ed only for a few minutes. The murderer
succeeded in overpowering the officer and
rushed out of the jail.
PXTBSTTIT OF MUEDEBEE.
The Deputy Constable who was killed
Â¦was James Cases', a popular young man.
who had served with credit in the office
of the Sheriff. This afternoon he was
called upon to arrest Julius Demartirf, a
Â¦woodchoppcr, and proceeded. to the place
where Demartini had for some time been
creating- a disturbance. Casey had no
difficulty in making the arrest. Dfnar
tinl, although drunk, surrendered without
protest and appeared quite willing to ac
company the official to the jail.
When Casey and his prisoner reached
the cell door in the lockup. Demartir.i
turned suddenly on the officer and with
a pistol shot him twice in the body. Dep
uty Sheriff Thorn was standing Jn tn>
corridor a few feet away at the time of
the shooting and tried to grab the
weapon from Demartini. He failed tn this
effort and the prisoner opened fire on
Thorn, but missed him.. --Â¦â¢[,
KILLING OF CONSTABLE
The impulse to lynch the murderer, who
was fatally wounded by the relatives of
the man he killed, pained strength to
night, but it is believed that Sheriff
Graves' request for order and observance
of the law will be granted The murderer
may die of his numerous wounds before
morning.
SAN ANDREAS. July 26.â The murder
Of an officer of the law by # his drunken
prisoner, a fierce battle in ;he corridor
of the Town Jail, the pursuit of the man
flayer by three armed and determined
brothers of the dead Constable, and the
storm of wrath and threats cf lynching
after these amazing incidents, made this
day a remarkably exciting one in the his
tory* of Calaveras, County.
Fpeci&l Dispatch to The Ca.ll
A strange situation is noticeable, but
the 200 soldiers here, it is believed, will
prevent further outbreaks, for the pres
ent at least. Half of these will be on
duty all the time.
The feeling against the soldiers Is no
ticeable. The commissary department to
day had much trouble in getting restau
rents to serve meals. Many refused to
feed the soldiers. Crowds gathered dur
ing the day near the lines and cursed the
soldiers. They were scattered with bayo
nets. Several other Â¦ companies of the
regiment arc under arms at Springfield
awaiting orders. Officers of the guard <2o
not expect any attack, however.
Sheriff Whitlock had four deputies and
three constables with him in the jail
guarding the prisoners. He says no one
fired into the mob but himself.
"I was alarmed for the, safety of my
wife and children. My wife took a gun
and said she would stand by me. I got
her and the children out of the way. and
then as the leaders were coming with the
rail to batter down the walls I shot along
the rail to make them drop it. This ac
counts for so many being shot in the
hands and arms. I flred eight or ten sboU
in all." Â»
Sheriff Whitlock said to-day, in giving
his version of the shooting into the mob:
"After I saw from the Jail that the mob
was determined to attack I went to the
veranda and attempted to talk to the
maddened men. As I stepped Into view
of the crowd two bullets were fired, one
striking the wall back of me. I flred two
shots into the air. Some one shouted that
I wa3 only bluffing and waa shooting
blanks. I warned the mob that I would
resist an attack on the Jail with powder
and lead. There was another shot from
the mob and it surged forward. I then
fired a shot from my shotgun into their
legs. This drove them back, but they re
turned a moment later to the attack oÂ£
the front door. ,
Four companies of militia arrived at
9;3O o'clock this morning from Spring-
Held. Companies A, I, B and H of the
Seventh Illinois Infantry were sent in re
ply to urgent requests sent at midnight
to State officials. The troops marched ti>
the market house, opposite the jail, and
camped. Streets were cleared and
the crowds disappeared. Sullen threats
were heard. but no attempt .at
an outbreak was made during tha
day. To-night 100 sentinels are pa
trolling the streets in the immediate
vicinity of the jail. Each soldier carries
forty rounds of ammunition.
SHEBIIT TELLS OP BATTLE.
Early in the morning Wilson, the al
leged iregro assailant of Mrs. Burgess,
was secretly taken from the county Jail,
but was returned shortly afterward.
After daylight this morning there were
restless crowds on the streets. Hundreds
of farmers came into the city. each, sur
rounding town sending Its quota. Many
miners were in the crowd. Great unrest
and a threatening attitude were reported
from Westvale, five miles away.
TROOPS ON THE SCENE.
Many of the wounded are in the hos
pital. Arrangements are being made for
the funeral of Henry Gatterman.

bishops Into exile. France, ever too likely
to be extreme, forgetting the- traditions
which had made it glorious, was Inaugu

DENVER. July 26.â The General As
sembly adjourned at 1 o'clock this- morn
ing after having passed a general appro
priation bill, that being the purpose for
which the special session was called. The
House defeated the Senate joint resolu
tion calling upon the world's fair board
to disband. Governor Pea body refused to
issue a supplementary call fbr a special
session to consider an eight-hour bill.
Another paper quotes Monslgnor Fian
ciscanava as to the possibility of the elec
tion of a Pope who would reconcile the
Vatican and Quirinal thus:
: No Pope ever hated Italy. The ', Government
must reconcile Iteelt to the Pope. Certainly
Italy, on the occasion of the deatlr of Leo
showed herself well disposed for a reconcllla
tion.
lia replied that he had already noticed
this and that he would punish those who
were responsible.
Monslgnor Merry Del Val communicated
to the Cardinals the report from Santiago.
Chile, of the Incident which occurred
there during the celebration of the re
quiem for the late Pope, which was at
tended by the President of the republic
and all the authorities. According to the
report Monsignor Uguarte hi delivering
the eulogy upon the late Pontiff protested
against the usurpation of papal territory
by Italy, whereupon Count Cucchl Boas
son left the church and lowered the
Italian flag, which had been hoisted at
the legation as a sign of mourning. The
Incident produced ars unpleasant Impres
sion upon the Sacred College, being the
first discordant note in the universal
mourning. V
The ceremonial of the conclave estab
lished by Gregory XV is to be followed at
tho coming meeting. The Cardinals have
decided to eat in common during the con
clave in order to facilitate their work. A
local paper quotes the response of^ Car
dinal Svampa to a question as to whether
he believed the conclave would be of
lengthy duration as follows:
j On the contrary. I tlJnk It will be very
short. I believe that tfo days will suffice
to reach an agreement. '
former Secretary of State, in spite of the
fidelity of the Spanish Cardinals and a
certain Cardinal resident in Rome, whose
interest it is to see him elected, has no
chance of success. There is against it a
coalition of all who desire to give the
Holy S*e a different character from the
one it possessed under Leo XIII.
The opposition to Cardinal Rampolla
does not. however, render it more easy
to find a majority for any other candidate
among the papablle. for though Cardinal
Oreglia has gained ertecm of late in hiÂ«
function as Cameriingo. he has never pos
sessed the sympathies of the Sacred Col
lege, nor been able to make warm friends
there.
It is certain that if Cardinal Gibbons
has worked to render impossible the elec
tion of Cardinal Rampolla. his efforts
have at the same time been directed In
favor of Cardinal Serafino Vannutelli.
The latter is one member of the Sacred
College who is very modern in his ideas
and whose conception of the papacy Is
an anti-polltlcal one. He is convinced the
Pope has nothing to do with the domestic
politics of the various countries and is a
strong partisan of the position or thÂ«
church in the United Statesâ that is. com
plete independence of church Â«nd state.
In consequence It is almost certain lhat
if Cardinal Vannutelll should be elected
Pope he would withdraw the prohibition
which prevents Italian Catholics voting or
from rtandlng as candidates for the Ital
ian Parliament. If this prohibition, which
TTti first made by Pius IX and continued
by Leo XIII iÂ» withdrawn the result will
be the immediate formation of a Catholic
party in the Italian Parliament, which
will oppose the Socialists.
If a Catholic party 6hould be formed the
CAPACITY OF CHURCHES IS TESTED

conflict between the Quirinal and the
Vatican would take an entirely consti
tutional form, which would greatly miti
gate the present state of the rivalry.
But nearly all of the Italian Cardinals
absolutely opposed any change in this
direction, and though they recognize the
great qualities of Cardinal Vannutelll,
they will not vote for him. Therefore,
even if Cardinal Gibbons should succeed
in obtaining for him the votes of all of
the foreign Cardinals (except, of course,
the Spanish members of the Sacred Col
lege, who will remain faithful to Cardinal
Rampolla) and should obtain more Ital
ian votes than seems at present probable,
he will still be far from bringing together
the two-thirds majority necessary for the
election of a Pope.
Under these conditions and In the pres
ent state of the various combinations in
the Sacred College, we may prepare our
selves for considerable surprises in the
course of the conclave. As the election
of Cardinal Rampolla may now be re
garded as o'ut of the question and the
choice of Cardinal Vannutelll seems ex
tremely improbable, we necessarily reach
the conclusion that the Cardinal who will
succeed Leo XIII will be one not among
the anplrants at present prominent.
On his arrival here to-day Cardinal Gib
bons was accompanied by Father Garvln,
his secretary. He was received at the
station by Monslgnor Kennedy, rector of
the American ' College In Rome, and
Father Hertrog. procurator general of the
Order of Sulpiclans. They drove to the
Sulplcian House, where masa was cele
brated.
Being tired and the hour being late,
Cardinal Gibbons did not attend the meet-

when the dignity of Christian marriage
is violated men adopt legal concubinage
instead of marriage, husbands neglect
their natural duties of fidelity, children
refuse obedience to and respect for flielr
parents, the bonds of domestic love are
loosened, and what sets a deplorable ex
ample and brings ruin to public morals,
pernicious and latal separations often

the constitution of the Christian state
and the constitution of the church. He
spoke to laborers and capitalists, uphold
ing the former in their right to a just re
muneration for their toil; supporting the
latter in their title' to property justly ac

pointed out to his people the great dan

principles, he, in the very beginning of
his reign issued a strong encyclical on the
sound traditional policy of the church, re

vigor In all Catholic schools of higher
education. The results, which he hoped
to achieve through the teaching of his en
cyclicals he looked to .the church to ac

said, "Feed my lambs, feed, my sheep." And
souls are Individuals He knew they were
his' charge and that they would
look to him for guidance. 'So
with the promptness of a vigilant pastor,
one month after his coronation he issued
his first encyclical in which with wonder
ful clearness and accuracy he portrayed
the evils of society and warned tile'faith
ful against them. .'Since the beginning
of our pontificate.' he says, 'there has
been presented to us the sad spectacle of
the evils with which mankind is over
whelmed on every side: that most wide
spread corruption of the supreme truths
on which rests, as on it? foundation, the
whose body of human society; that revolt
of minds incapable of enduring any law
ful authority; those constantly reoccuring
causes of discoid whence arise Intestine
strifes and bloody and civil wars; con-
Jempt for laws regulating morals and
defending justice; a cupidity insatiable of
the perishable.things and forgetfulncss of
things eternal; improvident administra
tions, dissipation and misuse of public
funds and property; the impudence of
those who. doinu everything to deceive,
strive to make themselves pass as defend
ers of their country, of liberty and of the
rights of all: and In the last. place, that
species of deadly plague that vitally at
tacks the organs of human society, gives
It no rest and threatens it with fresh
revolutions and most calamitous events."
"Could (ihr with -'surer touch put his
finger on the Ills of society They are all
here, disease of the spiritual life, the In
tellectual life, the moral life, the physical
life, the social and the political life. And
as these were wide-spread, penetrating all
classes of men and women, the Pope saw
that there was no possible remedy, except
by arousing the consciences of the In
dividuals. Legislation" cannot generate
virtue. The masses will be no better than
the units of which: they are composed. So
in a series of clear and forcible encycli
cals the Pope taught the world anew the
old elementary Chrlstain truths, which
have the praud strength and" glory of
having lifted mankind out of the ancient
paganism. He began by teaching that
Gcd is supreme on earth as well as In
heaven and that air power and authority
to command and make laws derive from
Him and from Him alone. Therefore, he
insisted r.n thn religious education of
children, that they; might learn to know
about God and the" hereafter. He spoke
of the Chrlstain family as the sacred
foundation of the" whole social fabric.
Â¦the t,lmes that prevented them from car
rying out the, desires of. their 'hearts.
Even official Italy, has shown by 'its spon
taneous courtesies how much the old
spirit of hostility has passed away.' It is
safe to say that when the time comes to
remove it the body of Leo XIII will be
carried in peace, as in honor, to Its tomb
In the Lateran basilica. â¢; :
"What a wonderful . tribute all : this
c!iange Is' to '..the consummate diplomacy
of Leo XIII! .But what ; a great tribute
it Is to the means he has employed. The
Â¦Gentiles have raged, and the people de
vised vain things. The kings of. the

They trusted in chariots and horses; Leo
trusted in the name of the Lord. He
loved peace and pursued it; he appealed
to the justice he knew to be in the hearts
of rulers and nations; he called, to It and
it harkened to his voice. Above all. he
watched and waited with the eternal pa
tience of Rome, and at last ho saw the
calm succeed to the storm-tossed political
sea of Europe. His eminent Christian

Prince George, the eldest, son of * King
Peter Karageorgevitch of Servia," during
the past week and has reported to the
Emperor that the boy la a degenerate. ~.
Prince George was born in 1888. and
therefore Is 18 years of age. "He was
reared practically under the direction of
the Russian . court, and a." report printed
just after the Belgrade tragedy said that
he was educated "to occupy the throne of
Servia. On June 12 a* Berlin dispatch to
the London Times said that King Peter
might abdicate in favor of his son.
'Simon,' said. our blessed Lord, speaking
to all the apostles, 'Simon, Satan hath de
sired you that he mlgHt sift you as
wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that
thy faith shall fail not, and thou being
once converted confirm thy brethren.'
Resting upon that promise, upon the
value of prayer, when he found himself
beset .by difficulties on every side, the
Pope at the very beginning of his reign
asked the faithful to bend their knees and
supplicate the health of heaven. And if
in these days the spiritual greatness of
the church has shone out with unwonted
splendor, if all men's eyes have been
turned to it. to what shall we ascribe the
result but to the prayer which, by his
direction, we have been saying after
every low mass for the last twenty years,
begging God. our refuse and our strength,
through the intercession of the blessed
Virgin and alljthe saints, to .hear our
prayers for the conversion of sinners and
for x the liberty and exaltation of Holy
Mother Church? For the same period of
time he has directed us, especially during
the month of October, to recite the sim
ple prayer of the rosary. He set apart
days of adoration and prayer for the dif
ferent nations of the world for the re
union of Christendom. He ordered that
the old century should be watched out In
prayer for the different nations of the
world, and that the coming In of the new
should find the faithful on their knees
consecrating again their lives and hearts
to the service of God. .
"May the spirit of Leo live on, and may
his splendid faith, his Christian piety and
his humble trust in prayer remain an ex
ample and an inspiration J.o us who have
life's battles still to fight against enemies,

Mr. Proctor's-reply to the editorial In

sought exceptions to the ciÂ»-Il service
rules in behalf of his relatives and friends.
He pronounces this charge untrue and
says he never asked exceptions for rela

has no relatives In the classified service.

Mr. Smith's letter closes with the statement
that "Mr. Proctor's innuendoes Justify a per
sonal statement, which will be more becomins
in a less formal paper."
An editorial In the Philadelphia Press of
July 2O, 1003. presumably contains this per
sonal statement. The article Is given almost
entirely to abuse and vituperation.
As the matters under consideration had their
origin prior to your Induction into office, this
letter cannot properly be regarded as referring
In any way to your administration^ the de
partment. Very respectfully.
JOHN B. PROCTOR. President.
. Mr. Smith now states hts belief that the
commission never received this letter and de
clares that he will not comment on "the pecu
liar candor 'which made no acknowledgment
of the removal of all Just ground of complaint
then, and- seeks to suppress the truth about
it now." * â¢ Â¦ â¢
A sufficient reply to this statement will be
found on page 300 of the seventeenth annual
report of thÂ» commission published In the
early part of 1901. in which statement follows
the full quotation of Mr. Smith's letter: "It
Is gratifying to the commission to be able
to state that, since the date of the above
letter, but one case of this kind has oc
curred." s
He also quotes In his letter of December 27.
1900. to the commission. In which he agreed
that admissions to the service should, so far
as practicable, be made upon examination and
stated that directions had been riven which
would remove all Just grounds of complaint.
ADMISSIONS TO SERVICE.
. Mr. Smith says in reference to the same
subject: "In 1807. ... before I became 'Post
master General, some persons were appointed
to offices about to be classified and after class
ification they were transferred to other parts
of the service.. This practice thus introduced
continued In a limited degree."
As a matter of record there were only four
such appointments made during the latter part
of.lS97 and the/early part of ' 1888. - prior to the
appointment of Mr. Smith, and 124 under his
administration.
In commenting upon that part ot- the com
mission's letter which deals with the classi
fication transfer method adopted by the de
partment to evade the rules, he avoids, by a
safs margin, the facts disclosed by the inves
tigation. It Is a civil service rule promul
gated by the President which provides for the
classification of clerks at free - delivery offices
and the commission construes this rule as rec
ognizing . only bona fide employes as acquir
ing a. classifiable status. It was the depart
ment and not the statute or the rules that
places the names - of eighteen residents of
Washington or Its vicinity on the rolls of
postoffices In various parts of the United
States, without reference. to the needs of those
offices, for the sole purpose of getting them
Into classified positions In the Washington
postofflce or the department.
This was especially, true with regard to
persons appointed to outside office? for the
purpose of classification and afterward trans
ferred to the 'Washington postofflce and later
to the department, as well as In the cases of
persons appointed as laborers, but Irregularly
assigned to classified duty In the Washington
postofflce. who were afterward appointed in the
rural free delivery service just before Its class
ification.
The 'relevancy of a portion of the commis
sion's letter has been denied by Mr. Smith, al
though the essential facts it contained have
not been controverted. Concerning: the ques
tion of relevancy. It may bÂ«- stated that the
Postmaster General requested the commission
to. Investigate and report- whether' the civil
service rules were being violated In the Wash
ington postofflce; and that as the investigation
disclosed, the fact that regarding the relation
of a' bureau to the department in the matter
of appointments and other changes, some of
the departmental affairs necessarily came with
in Its scope. - -
QUESTION OF BELEVANCY.
The Honorable the Postmaster General â
Sir: My attention has been called to the let
ter, dated July 14 of Hon. Charles . Emory
Smith, as it appeared In the public press of
July 20, commenting on the recent letter of the
commission In regard to the administration of
the public service in the Washington post
offlce. If this letter were based upon the facts
disclosed by the records, or could be read In
connection with the commission's letter and
the report of 'the Investigation, upon which
It was based, there would be no necessity for
remark or reply. Under the circumstances
there are certain parts of Mr. Smith's letter
which 'seem to demand attention.

Great Work of
Holy Father
BERKELEY, July 26.â Solemn re
quiem mass was celebrated at St.
â Joseph's Church to-day for the dead
Pope. Father M. O'Riordan was the cele
brant. The church was decorated in
mourning colors for *the occasion.
A special choir rendered the sacred
music. The Rev. J. J. Cant well acted as
deacon and the Rev. Father Carroll of
San Francisco as subdeacon.
Father O'Riordan delivered an eloquent
address upon the life and character of the
dead Pontiff. He said in part:
Pope Leo XIII was one of the greatest mas
ters the church hae ever produced. Living In
an age when his work was necessarily hard,
at the head of a church ones the temporal as
well as the spiritual ruler of the world. Pope
Leo was confronted with some peculiar prob
lems when he took charge or .the church at
the age of Â«3 years. But his administration
haÂ« been eminently successful.
Pope Leo's great work was to place . the
church on rood terms with the temporal pow
ere cf the world, and he has left it much the
tetter for his bavins lived.

In these days of learning. He has been an
educational Pope. He has been a promoter
of studies and of investigation in all the
fields of knowledge, and the confidence
he has had. that all truth will ultimately
rebound to the glory j and usefulness of
the church Is well exemplified. In what he
said in 18S4 to the German Historical Cir
cle, 'Draw as much as possible on the
sources. It Is for that purpose I have
<jpened the Vatican Archives. We are
not : afraid to let the light come in on
them.* And to a later historian he said,
'You must make the Popes .known.' In
accordance with this spirit he has given
m a Catholic university in Washington.
He has founded new chairs In the univer
sities of Louvainl, Lisle and Freiburg. He

But we are not yet at the
source of Leo's power. Paul may
plant and Apollo may water, but
God alone can give the increase." And so,
while Leo used all 'human means to. ac
complish his work, he did not forget that
the* fructifying agent must be the grace
of God. . There is a celebrated portrait of
the Pope painted by the French artist
Chartrain which represents him on his
knees, his arms resting on a prledleu.'hls
handa- clasped in front of him, his head
bowed, and on his' face anrexpression of
Intense earnestness. It is Leoat prayer.
This has been the source of all his won
derfulpower. : He consecrated all his'en
ergies to God, and God gave them fruit
fulness. He understood St. Chrysostcm's
beautiful saying, iTThere' Is nothing more
powerful In the world than a. man who
prays-t He remembered that the very gift
which most distinguished the Papal chair.
Us gift of Infallibility In teaching revealed
truth, is a direct result ol prayer.
"Men find fault with the church for be
ing whaWthey call a system, but If the
strength^ind success of civil, political
and commercial life depend upon skillful
organization why should our Lord not use
this simple principle for the furtherance
pt good? Are virtue and religion alone
to have no organized supporters or pro
moters? Is Christ, the King alone, to
have no united army but only a crowd of
followers of some hundreds of isolated,
often hostile bands? And If evil at pres
sent day is knit together into such per
fect organizations everywhere, what unity
of Christian forces can be opposed to it
more effectlve^SPhan that which centers
around the throne of Peter and reaches
to the ends' of the earth? Consequently
the Holy Father has used all the weight
of his teaching authority within the
church to make the wonderful, world-wide
organization of which he is the head the
instrument of blessings to all mankind,
hoping and praying the while that those
who should be benefited by it might come
to his allegiance and further the fulfill
ment of that unity which was the burden
of our blessed Lord's prayer on the sad
dest night of his life. 'Surely,' said the
aged Pontiff only last year, 'the eye of
man cannot pierce all the depths of the
designs of God in thus prolonging our
old age beyond the limits of hope; here
we can only be silent and adore. But
there is one thing which we do well un
derstand, namely, that as it hath pleased
Him and still pleases Him to preserve
our existence a great duty is incumbent
upon usâ to live for the good and the de
velopment of his immaculate spouse, the
holy church, and, so far from losing
courage in the -midst of cares and pains,
to consecrate to him the remainder of our
strength unto ourMast sigh.'
tificate has been to attach people to us
more closely, and to' bring out clearly
this truth, that the influence of the Ro
man Papacy is salutary in all respects.'
has increased the number of students at
the Gregorian University In Rome from
400 to over 1000. And, safeguarding the
interests of their. Catholic faith, he has
made it possible once again for the Cath
olic young men of England to attend- the
universities of ' Oxford and Cambridge.
He ha3 written an encyclical on the Bible
and but last year appointed a learned
commission to consider scriptural ques
tions. He encouraged Oriental studies,
caused pew seminaries to spring into ex
istence and gave a fresh impetus to the
work of the famous Vatican Observatory.
"And now these manifold and laborious
works of Leo, the. statesman, the teacher
and the scholar, would seem to be enough
to fill up the life and exhaust the strength
of one man; but besides these things,
which are without, he ha a had his daily
instance, the solicitude for all the
churches. He has ? been responsible for
the spiritual well-being of the universal
church. He has appointed Cardinals and
Bishops. He has, received pilgrimages,
he has encouraged the faithful in all
parts of the world. He has written nu
merous letters on devotional and doc
trinal questions. He has' : restored the
hierarchy in Scotland; he has . convened
the Bishops of this country in the Third
Plenary Council of Baltimore, and. in
18D8 he summoned the 104 Archbishops and
Bishops of Latin America In council at
Rome. But among. the sweetest joys that
came to his fatherly heart was the return
to the unity of the, faith of 100,000 schismat
ic Nestorians, " 60,000 Gregorian Armenians
and thousands of Copts. He has seen the
church rise to a position of spiritual emi
nence and power which is all the more
striking that his .temporal power has
shrunk to extinction. How, then, were
these wonderful results accomplished?

the music consisted of portions of Mo

Admiral Taylor, chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, speaking about the voyage
to-night, said:
"There was no test of maximum speed
possible, but only a test of the usual run
ning under all boilers. It is customary in
ordinary cruising to use only about two
thirds or three-fourths of the full, boiler
power of the ship. All the boilers are
used when it is desired to make a better
speed and sustain It for a long period,
while for short periods of excessive speed
forced draught on the boilers Is used.
Thia Is done, however, only for short peri
ods, because the strain On the boilers and
on the endurance of the firemen is very
great. The bottom of the Kearsarge, al
though not necessarily very foul, is not
at its best condition because the vessel Is
not just out of drydock."

WASHINGTON, July 26.â A great deal
of Interest was taken by naval officers in
Washington in the run of the Kearsarge
from Portsmouth to Frenchman's Bay. It
was estimated before the vessel left Eng
land that, with good weather, she would
make the run across the ocean in ten
days, and this prediction has been veri
fied. Estimating that she traveled about
3000 miles, the speed of the Kearsarge
would average approximately between
13.1 and 13% knots per hour. While the
run the vessel Just made Is not at all re
markable, yet it is very satisfactory for
a heavy battleship and indicates the en
gines were In good condition.
Considered Highly Satisfactory.
Ocean Voyag-e of the Kearsarge Is
NAVY DEPARTMENT PLEASED.
Â« , â
Captain Hemphill and his officers are
very enthusiastic over the way in which
they have been entertained while in for
eign waters. Everywhere the Stars and
Stripes was cheered as the Kearsarge
moved in and out of port. A big crowd
watched her departure from Portsmouth
as she started on -the voyage that has
ended so successfully. Captain Hemphill
will not give out the details of daily
runs, etc., until he has made his report
to the Navy Department.
The Kearsarge will leave this port to
morrow morning at 5 o'clock and proceed
to the coaling station at Lamoine, where
she will fill her bunkers preparatory to
participating in the naval maneuvers,
which begin August 16.
WHAT TBIP DEMONSTBATES.
The trip of the Kearsarge has demon
strated that a ship of her class can
maintain an average speed of over thir
teen knots on a long voyage without in
jury to her machinery; that her coal car
rying capacity is adequate for a trip of
4000 miles under full speed; that in time
of war, ships of her class can cross the
ocean and engage an enemy at once; that
the Kearsarge is one of the most perfect
ships in the world and fully equal to any
emergency.
The highest speed attained was a little
more than fifteen knots an hour and the
slowest was ten. Three times during the
trip the ship was slowed down, once on
account of being â¢ in the v vicinity of an
iceberg and twice on account of a very
thick fog. Headwinds and thick weather
retarded the speed of the ship and under
favorable conditions she would have cov
ered the. distance in less than nine days.
Captain Hemphill says that he could
?tart on a return trip at once and beat
the record made on this voyage. Since
the Kearsarge left New York fifty
three days ago she has visited Germany,
Denmark and England, has steamed 8200
miles, has been at sea twenty-four days
and in port twenty-nine days, and during
all this time there has not been a single
accident to the machinery -or a stop of
any kind. She is ready for action.
When she left Portsmouth she carried
1640 tons of coal. She now has on board
410 tons, consuming 1230 tons on the voy
age, an average of 135 tons dally. As her
coal carrying capacity is but 1591 tons,
some coal was taken on deck.
MAKES FIFTEEN KNOTS.
BAR HARBOR. Me.. July 26.â The bat-
Ueship Kearsarge arrived at Bar Harbor
at 5:42 p. m. and dropped anchor In the
upper harbor at 6:13. All day the shore
path had been thronged with people anx
iously watching the eastern horizon for
the first glimpse of the famous ship, but
it was not until 5 o'clock that her im
mense hull appeared out of the mist In
the east. Coming full speed the battle
ship entered the harbor, passed the other
ships of the squadron at anchor and then
proceeded to the upper harbor, where
the battleship Illinois, with Admiral Bar
ker on board, was anchored. . After the
usual formality the representative of the
Associated Press was received on board
and was the first to greet Captain Hemp
hill, who expressed surprise that their
trip should be of interest to others out
side the Navy Department. He said:
"We left the Needles at 1:23 p. m. on
Friday, July 17, and Mount Desert Rock
at 12:30 to-day, covering the distance of
2900 miles in nine days four and a quarter
hours, an average speed of 13.16 miles an
hour."

SITUATION IN LONDON
The first eggs to reach the great pack
ing houses come from the far south. ' In
March the middle States and those near
by send In their eggs for storage. In April
and May egg3 from the north and ' the
Eastern States reach market In \ great
quantities. Before the end of June there
are often a thousand carloads in market
to bo stored for the dull season "when
hens will not lay."
At these packing-houses the tempera
ture is kept at 30 degrees Fahrenheit by
means of pipes through which brine cir
culates, exactly as steam does in mod
ern houses. The secret of storing eggs
successfully consists in keeping them at
only 2 degrees below freezing point, -In
surroundings of spotless cleanliness, and
In sorting those that have begun to be
stale from those that are strictly fresh.â
N. Y. Tribune.
The cold storage houses begin to store
eggs in the month of February, and stop
storing after the month of June until
cold weather comes again. In the" hot.
sultry weather of August eggs,' like all
other perishable products, spoil easily,
and are usually unfit for storage pur
poses by the time they are . brought to
market. -â¢ . . â¢
An old picture in the Dresden gallery
represents a Dutch housewife "testing
eggs," and shows that the method In use
to-day was in vogue more than a hun
dred years ago, except for the substitu
tion of a strong electric light for the
ancient oil lamp. The interior of the egg
is examined by the glow of light which
shines directly through it. If a perfect
ball of rosy red Is found floating in clear
liquid in a clean shell, the egg Is fresh.
If there Is a slight vacuum at one end
it is fresh enough for ordinary use, but
not quite so fresh as the first one. Evap
oration has set in, but for cakemaking
and for many purposes this egg Is better
than a perfectly fresh one. Finally when
the egg has decomposed, the yolk sticks
to the shell; it is stale and unfit for/use,
though It may not be odorous. Eggs
which this test shows to be practically
fresh laid may not have been in the barn
yard for months, while those that have
not been properly stored will not bear
"candling," though they have been laid
only a few week?.
Cold storage of eggs is one of the great
est conveniences of modern times, giving
housewives eggs in abundance at a sea
son when there would otherwise be an
egg famine, and enabling the produce
merchant to control ithe market the year
round. Before this was done there was
no certainty of obtaining fresh eggs ex
cept in spring and early summer, and
speculators were continually arising to
"bull" the market, a process which often
met with abject failure. "No sooner was
the market cornered than hens all over
the country began laying," said an un
fortunate, speculator. "AOd there was no
possible way of controlling the hens," he
added, sadly. To-day the prices of eggs
are definitely controlled by the cold stor
age houses. The demand seems to be al
ways equal to, if not greater than, the
supply. It is estimated that every five
years the consumption of eggs doubles,
and only the process of cold storage keeps
down the prices. In cold storage houses
eggs may be kept for an indefinite time
as fresh as if they were just laid. The
secret of success in this matter He3 in
careful sorting and packing of. the eggs
in a uniform temperature.

what becomes of their bodies? I never

jaws were open and Its glassy eyes were
pushed far out of Its head. I held a post

and found the lamb's head lodged In Its
throat. How or why the bear ever per

MOUNT VERNON, N. Y.. July 26.â The
body of a woman about 26 year3 of age,
a blonde and good looking, was found
this afternoon in a sewer pipe on the out
skirts of Mount Vernon. A shoestring
was tied tightly around the neck end there
were finger marks on the throat which
Indicated that she had been murdered.
The discovery of the body was made by
two little girls who were picking apples
near Sixth street.
In order to place the body In the sewer
the murderer evidently had to break the
pipe. The theory is that the body was
lowered into the hole with a rope.
The woman apparently was a German.
She weighed about 147 pounds, was five
feet seven inches In, height and had large
blue eyes and a prominent nose. The body
was neatly dressed in a blue and white
polkadot shirt waist and skirt, with black
hosiery and patent leather ties. A large
white straw hat, trimmed with blue and
white ribbon, was found about a hundred
feet away, in Sites' meadows.
Coroner Weisendenger, who examined
the body, said the woman had been dead
no more than a day. The part of the city
where the sewer Is located is known as
East Mount Vernon.
Who thÂ« murdered woman is or where
Â¦he came from Is a mystery. No one had

"UNCLE SAM" TO PAY MORE
FOB HIS STENOGRAPHERS
Present Salaries Do Not Induce
First-Class Operators to Leave
Private Service.
Uncle Sam has finally awakened to the
fact that he does not pay his stenograph
ers enough money. At least, he is find
ing extreme difficulty in inducing com
petent maid shorthand writers to enter
the Government service- at the rates of.
pay now ruling. This class of employes
start workins for the Government at $60
and $73 a month. The requirements of the
civil service examinations areQvery se
vere, and any man who. is able to pass
them usually has no difficulty In getting a
position with some business firm at a bet
ter salary than the Government pays.
The Civil Service Commission Is conÂ«
stantly holding special examinations for
stenographers in an effort to get enough
good men to supply the demand. Unfilled
requisitions'" for competent shorthand
writers are always on, hand at the com
mission. The poor pay held out, however,
attracts an' enormous crowd of Incom
petents, the experience, stenographers
preferring to pay no attention to the
Government calls. This fact was well
illustrated in a special examination for
stenographers that was held in various
cities in April last. More than 700 can
didates appeared, of which about 123
passed. These have all been offered po
sitions, but one-half of them refused to
leave their old places for the meager sal
ary held out by the Government. It Is
easier to get women stenographers to
work for JiiO and $75 a month than men,
but nire-tenths of the requisitions are for
male shorthand writers.
The chief examiner of the commission
has conferred with the chief clerks of the
various departments in an effort to secure
a remedy for this situation. A scheme
has been devised by which it is hoped to
make the Government service more at
tractive to the competent stenographers.
In the past It has been the custom when
a vacancy occurred in a $1000 or $1200
clerkship to fill it by promotion from the
clerks in the lower grades, keeping up
the promotion process all the way down
to the lowest grade. This left a vacancy
at the bottom, which ' was usually filled
by the appointment of a stenographer.
Hereafter there will be only occasional
promotions of this sort, for the high-class
vacancies are to be held open for outside
stenographers". This will undoubtedly in
duce many first clas stenographers who
now refuse to take examinations to con
sider entering the Government service.â

talion of Colombia,, when he learned of
the El Lapiz incident, retired to "head
quarters, where he found General Cobos.
According to current reports, the latter
ordered General Huertas to remain in
quarters. Exactly what has taken place
is unknown, but It is said that Dr. Aris-
tides Arjona, Secretary of the Govern
ment; Fernando Arango, Chief of. Police,
and Etram Navia, a member of the de
partmental superior tribunal of justice,
are under arrest, the last named for try
ing to argue with General Cobos the ille
gality of his action.
. An attempt also Is raid to have been
made to arrest Senor Guerra, Secretary'
of Finance, but he refused to accompany
the officer who went to arrest him. When
the officer returned with soldiers to efÂ«.
feet his capture Guerra had departed.
The only civil officer on the street this
rooming was Mayor Ossa. Governor Mu
tls spent last night at the British Con
sulate, but it is rumored that he \ will

servatives, who refused to accept, and
that he himself will assume civil cwCz
mand. It is said that Consul Gudjer at

Chief of Police, Arango, remains under
arrest.

GENERAL VASQUEZ' COBOS, an officer of the Colombian army, has seized the reins of
government iit the department of Panama. Governor. Mutio and his American wife escaped
arrest by taking refuge in the British* Consulate, having been ivarned of the coup d'etat.

Conservative to accept the governorship, will himself assume civil command. _,. For months past
there have been rumors of' a revolution in Panama and the secession of that and other states from

Turner visited the scene of the tragedy
behind Brennan's barn in West Berkeley

ATT3MPT TO ASSASSINATE
A WITNESS AT JACKSON
Bullets Sp-.ed From Amoush at Man
Who Testified in Feud

JACKSON, Ky., July 26.â There is much
excitement here to-day over an attempt
to assasinate Riley Coldiron last night.
Coldiron was with James Gear when two
shots from ambush were heard, one of
the bullets passing through Coldlron's
clothing.
Coldiron had testified before the Grand
Jury that he saw Britton and Spicer with
Curtis Jett at the time Jett is charged
with having killed Thomas Cockrill, and
when Britton and Spicer were Indicted
certain county officials attempted to have
Coldiron indicted for perjury.
A large crowd was attracted to the
California Tennis Club courts yesterday
by the epecial exhibition match between
the two professionals, Joseph Dally and
Norman Hodgkinson. While the match
was Interesting, it was too one-Â«lded to
be exciting. Young Hodgkinson proved
much too strong for Dafly, his older op
ponent, and won three straight sets.
â¢ Daily's came shoÂ»-Â»d the effects of play-
Ing for the last few years with beginners
and poor players generally. He was off in
most of his strokes and seemed to have
lost his accuracy to a jrreat extent. Oc
casionally he showed flashes of his old
time form, but it was evident be is not
the player he was a. few years agt>. On
the other hand, HcdgkJnson had a world
of speed and played 4.Â»i excellent game
from all parts of the court. The only
time Daily really xsaÂ£e a stand was in the
second set, whea he pulled the score up
to 4-4 from 4-L Before and after this
everything went Hodgldnson's way. Tho
score in his favor was 6-1, 6-4, 6-2.
As the professional match was some
what disappointing and much shorter
than was expected, an impromptu exhibi
tion doubles was arranged. In this the
two professionals Joined forces against
Robert N. Whitney and Grant M. Smith,
stror-sest two amateur players. This
match was somewhat of an improvement
on the singles. Whitney and Smith were
slow to start, losing the first set, 6-3, and
facing a lead of 3-1 in the second. At this
stage of the eame the amateurs forced
matters and won the r.ext five games and
set, 6-S. The third and deciding set also
went to Whitney and Smith, 6-3.
In the morning the courts were crowded
*nd although the matches as a rule were
not high-class they were exceedingly In
teres'ir.g. Sidney Salisbury and W. S.
MacGavin furnished the best singles
match. The veteran baseline player, al
though not as fast as formerly, has rot
lost his c!cvr- strokes. He broke even
with Salisbury, each winning a set.
The best rsatcb in doubles was that in

NEAR AN OREGON TOWN
To-night a Coroner's Jury will meet In
the Morgue to pass its verdict on the
manner in which the unfortunate gentle
man from Victoria came by his death.
That Captain Howard exerted a fever
ish effort to place his valuable concession
on the market during his stay in San
Francisco is evinced by the numerous ad
dresses of mining men which appear in
his diary. Besides attempting to interest
William and" Charles Butters in his
project, his notes show that he called on
J. A. Wilkins, 39 Flood building, who is
now in Alaska; H. H. Norwood, 1922
Broderick street, and Henry S. Tobln,
now in the Klondike. Of all those whom
he endeavored to Interest in his scheme,
J. P. Treanor. his warm friend and ad
viser, alone i>ventured to offer, the impov
erished captain hope that he might real
ize a fortune from the brilliant opportu
nities which were stored up in the rich
concession on the Indian River.
It Is a significant fact that the week's
absence from the hotel was evidently not
premeditated by Captain Howard. The
effects which he left behind him contain
a shaving set, tooth brushes and monl
cure set, besides several changes of
clothing. According to the hotel authori
ties, the three pieces of baggage found in
Captain Howard's room after his deatji
were all that he had, so that it is not
probable that he carried a traveling bag
when ho left the hostelry on July 11 never
to return.
The fact that a punched ticket to Sau
salito was found on the dead man's body,
coupled with this note in his diary, may
mean that some person living in one of
the two cities named knew something of
his whereabouts between the time when
he left his hotel and the morning when
his body was found behind the barn In
West Berkeley.
A SIGNIFICANT FACT. .
"Go to Sausalito, narrow gauge; take
train to San Rafael; get off West End
station; walk up two blocks; xxzx for
claim."
week's disappearance and subsequent
death of Captain Howard remains yet un-
Eolved. An examination of the dead
man's diary shows an entry dated July
12. the day after his disappearance lrom
the Russ House
The note, which Is scratched and re
seratched by a lead pencil as if to pre
vent the possibility of its being read sub
sequently, can be partially deciphered as
follows:
RELATIVE OF MAN WHO MET MYSTERIOUS DEATH IN WEST
BERKELEY, WHO ARRIVED FROM THE NORTH YESTERDAY AND
IDENTIFIED BODY AS THAT OF CAPTAIN HOWARD.
L. J. Hoffman, who is a plumber and
steam fitter, residing at 305 Lyon street,
San Francisco.
Miss Nellie Hoffman eaid in telling of
the sad accident that before they at
tempted to cross the ftrtdge they heard
the train whistle. Her mother insisted on
crossing and stated her belief that they
could reach the other side in safety by
hastening. The daughter consented to the
mothers wishes and the two started
across the brldpe. They had completed
a.buut two-thirds of the distance when
the engine rushed upon them.
A cushion from a passenger coach was
secured and the inanimate form was car
ried up the embankment. The train was
backed up and the body placed in the
bajrsape car. Dr. J. W. Jesse had been
summoned and awaited the arrival of the
train, but the woman was past medical
aid.
With her two daughters. Misses Nellie
and Tlllie Hoffman, the deceased came to
this city about seven months ago for the
benefit of her health. She engaged in
the millinery and ladles' furnishing busl
re59 here on Fourth street. She was a
native of Pennsylvania, aged 63 years.
Her husband remained in Pennsylvania
wt.en his wifÂ« and daughters came West.
Ets-des these mentioned she leaves a son.
When the bridge was reached they
heard a whistle, but not realizing that
the train was so near, thought that they
would be able to reach the other side of
the bridge before it arrived. When part
way across the train came in sight
around the sharp curve close to the
bridge. They at once tried to reach the
side of the bridge where they would be
safe from harm on a platform about two
feet bÂ«Â»low the track. Miss Nellie reached
the platform In safety, but her mother
was cai^ht and whlrlod through the air.

The crash was terrific. The accommo

which was backing and wa3 running at a
good speed when It crashed Into the trol
ley car. Thtf trolley car was hurled from
its track a mass of wreckage. The im
pact caused the coaches to break loose
from the engine and they did not leave
the track, but the engine left the rails,
ran about 200 feet on the ties and turned
over on its side. Engineer Roy and Fire
man Higglns stuck to the engine and
were buried in its wreckage. After being
removed Engineer Roy died at the hos
pital. Fireman Higgins is so badly in
jured that he cannot live. The two were
pinioned under a Jet of scalding steam
and their screams were agonizing. Noth
ing could be done until jackscrews were
secured and the engine was raised. Roy
and Higgins begged to be killed outright
that they might not suffer the torture
they were undergoing. When they were
finally taken out both were literally par
boiled. Beatty and Lenharth, the two
other men who were killed, were standing
on the platform of the street car when
the crash came. They were hurled al
most thirty feet and were picked up dead.

Meanwhile the limited was pounding
along at regular speed and met the freight
head-on, Just after it had rounded a curve
at Vlaeaty. The morning was fcggy and
neither engineer saw the other ttain in
time to Btop, although the engineer of the
limited had applied the air brakes.
That the two trains came together with
terrific force was evidenced by the fact
that both engines were badly damaged,
but they remained standing upright upon
the tracks. The baggage and buffet cars
were completely wrecked and turned
cross-wiae v.ith the .tracks. The first
sleeper back of the buffet was smashed
in the forward end.
The rear four cars remained Intact on
the track. These cars were used to bring
the dead and injured to St. Paul ur.d Min
neapolis, where the injured were given
surjjlcal attention. None of the passen
gers were seriously injured, but cuts and
bruises were freely distributed and tha
utmost confusion prevailed after the im
pact of the two trains..
The baggageman was burled underneath
a pile of trunks when the car was lifted
off the track, but was taken out unin
jured. The baggage car struck a small
building, and one end broke through the
side of the structure.
Three cars in the freight were wrecked,
one of them containing a ' number of
sheep, which were killed. The wreck de
layed traffic for several hours.
The seriously Injured: H. J. Hickey,
fireman of the passenger train; William
Noble, colored, porter of the bultct car.
Fireman Keene, of the freight train,
slightly injured. â¢
Fred Horton, the passenger who was
killed, is Bald to have been standing on
the vestibule of the front steps talking
to a friend. His friend escaped injury.
The two trains were the Twin City Lim
ited and a fast freight. The limited was
running as a first Bection from Oelweln,
Iowa, to Minneapolis. The second section
consisted of an excursion train running
from Dea Molnes to Minneapolis and was
three hours behind time. The fast freight,
southbound, received an order at Dodge
Center reading that the second section of
the passenger train was three hours late.
The crew evidently misread the order and
attempted to make Vlasaty tiding, be
tween Dodge Center and Hastings, Minn.,
believing that it was the lhnjied that was
late.

STAGE NAMESâ Subscriber, City. As
a rule actors and actresses aooear on
the stace under assumed names, which
are known as "stage names." This Is be
cause the assumed name Is usually more
attractive than the real one. Th*re are
some, however, who persist in retaining
the true name, and in the case of act
resses being billed by the true title Miss
or Mrs., according to conditions. The act
ress asked about. Elizabeth Ponsi-Wallls
(nee Hanson) % who for many years sup
ported Edwin Forrest in Shakespearian
plays, appearing in leading roles, while
she wag thfe wife of James Ponsi. her
first husband, was engaged to appear In
one of the theaters m London, and the
manager Insisted In billing her as "Mlsa
Ponsi." She absolutely refused to appear
as "Miss," saying: "I am a married wom
an, r propose to be known as such and
have no Idea of sailing under false col
ors. I insist upon being called 'Mrs.' "
After considerable discussion there was
a compromise and she was billed as "Ma
dame." and ever after that. up. to the
time of her death In Washington. D. C.
in 1S99, she was known as "Mine. Ponsi."
She retired from the sta.ee in 1S33.
Recent developments indicate very clearly that the
Civil Service Commission has been notoriously at
fault in the character of the questions chosen by'it to
test 'efficiency in the Fire Department Instead of
examining the men in subjects which would call forth
a knowledge of duty the commission should have
confined* its queries to the dirty pool of primary poli
tics. Not an applicant would probably suffer the
humiliation of failure.
A CONTRACTâ E. M. E.; City. The
books lay down the rule that "Mere hard
ship will not excuse the non-performance
of a contract, nor indeed anything else,
if the contract is not itself impossible,
unless performance becomes impossible
through what is technically known as
'the act of God.' This must be something
which no ordinary skill or precaution
could have forseen or prevented."
FROM various points in the East come stories
showing a most strange misconception of the
relations of the National Guard to the public.
In some States the labor unions are denying the privi
lege of membership in the union to men who serve
in the guard. In other States business men have dis
missed employes who belong to the guard, giving as
a reason for the dismissal that they cannot afford to
employ men who arc liable to be called away from
their work when they are needed. The most curious
story of all, however, is to the effect that in Evans
ville, where the guardsmen were called out to sup
press riots a few days ago, pressure has been brought
to bear to compel employers to dismiss any of their
employes who served on. the guard and thus aided in
the suppression of the disturbance.
That such things have happened, even under pro
test, is an illustration of the extraordinary change that
is coming over the minds of some Americans with
respect to our citizen soldiery. It is a change
without any justification. There is nothing abso
lutely perfect in the "world; every institution has its
faults and defects, yet it would trouble the mind of
the most critical and the most persistent fault finder
to discover any valid excuse for the actions either of
the labor unions or the employers in condemning
guardsmen for what they have done at any period
of our national existencel â¢
The members of the guard owe something to the
public and the public owes as much to the guard.

ANSWERS TO >QUERIES.
An armored cruiser, building at Kiel to replace the Kaiser,
was named the Roon by the German Emperor on June 27. Tho
ship is of 9000 tons displacement and fitted with triple-screw
engines of 16,000 horsepower, calculated to give a speed or
twenty-one knots. The main battery consists of four 8.2-inch,
In two barbettes; four 6-inch, in casemates, and twelve 4-inch,
In broadsidesâ all the guns being quick flrcrs. She is the first
ship In the German navy to have four smokestacks, one abaft
/ . â¢ â¢
The foregoing list shows a total of thirteen armored ships
of 120.736 tons and 142.407 horsepower, and eighteen unarmored
ships of 52,779 tons and 146,040 horsepower.
That Russia has largely Increased its naval force in China
waters of latÂ«; is best shown by a comparison with the num
ber of ships in December last. There were then eleven ar
mored vessels of 122.118 tons, and on!y seven cru'.sers and gun
boats of 29,747 tons, making a total of eighteen fighting ships
of 151,865 tons. The present fleet contains but few of the
vessels stationed in Asiatic waters seven months ago. which
latter have been sent home for alterations and repairs, and
the ships now on hand are in the best condition and ready
for the service for which thoy were built. In addition there
is the Siberian fleet, consisting of an unknown number ol
coast defense ships, gunboats, destroyers and torpedo-boats,
most of which are of doubtful utility and none to be considered
in a fight on the high seas. >
A CHANCE TO SMILE
It Is a fact that the United States war vessels are obtained
at a less cost than those of Austria, France and Germany.
The New York Syren nsserts that the contractors for the
latest 16.000 tons battleships will hardly make a profit. The
price which the highest bidder is to receive is 2 cents per
cubic foot less than France pays for the same class of ships,
and is about 1.3 cents per cubic foot cheaper than tho lowest
contract for German battleships. Considering the fact that
wages in this country exceed those of Austria, France an'l
Germany from two to three times. It is evident that only the
better methods that exist in cur yard3. enable American build
ers to derive profits.
the Zahringen's horsepower of 13,000 was calculated to Rive a
speed of nineteen knot3. The highest results attained during
tho Fix hours* forced draught trial was 14.750 horsepower and
not quit* eighteen* knots for the Wittelsbach; 15.500 horsepower
and 13.125 knots for the Wettln, and 14,750 horsepower and only
17.68 knots for the Zahringen- During a twenty-four hours'
continuous run the Wittelsbach developed a mean of 10.6S3
horsepower, with 35 revolutions and a coal consumption of
1.97 pound* per unit of horsepower, and again during a sev
enty-six hours' run 10,300 horsepower and 1&3 knots* speed was
developed. As the six hours' runs were made in shallow water
it is confidently anticipated that deep sea trials will enable
the three ships to make fully IS knots.
The decline has been expected for a year or more
and carefnl men have long ere this discounted it. The
New York banks have the situation' well in hand and
money is standing up excellently under the specu
lative strain. There is plenty of money in the coun
try, collections are good, failures as a rule are few and
unimportant and commercial reports from all sec
tions cheerful. When the great liquidation, in the
stock market is finally over it will be surprising if
trade docs not show the beneficial effects of the
speculative chastening.
A few days ago a well-known New York banker
explained that several inside features of this apparent
liquidation have been unknown to the public at large,
pjnd they throw a new light on the situation. Accord
ing to his statement much of the liquidation has been
no liquidation at all, but merely a shifting of money
from one pocket to the other. Several reorganiza
tions cf vast corporations, such as the Pennsylvania,
for instance, have taken place, and in order that they
may acquire good interests in the new organizations
many large financial interests have thrown their old
holdings on the marko^jo realize funds for investing
in the new ones. This partially accounts for the large
-quantities of stocks recently thrown on the market
2nd can in no wise be classed as liquidation, though
to the outsider it has that appearance. There arc
more of these collateral conditions, which, if gen
erally understood by the public, would give the Wall
street slump a wh'olly different aspect.
The staples have shown more irregularity during
the past week. The provision market has continued
weak, with increasing stocks throughout the West
and a gradual downward tendency in prices. Iron
and steel, as already mentioned, are quieter and not
firm. Weather conditions have been against the
cereal crops, hot and dry winds having been reported
from the Western and Southwestern States, and the
wheat crop estimates are now reduced to 650,000,000
bushels and under, against a Government estimate of
670,000,000 bushels on July 1, while the corn crop is
now hardly expected to turn out more than three
qnarters of that of 1902. Hence the feeling in these
two grains has ruled firm. The trade in woolen
goods has been given a surprise, as the opening prices
of new lines have been reduced to about last year's
level in. spite of a material increase in raw wools and
several other items of promiction. The footwear
factories are reporting business good with a very fair
run of orders.
In spite of the break 1 in Wall street the country's
bank clearings show the slight, almost insignificant,
decrease of 5.9 per <:ent from the corresponding week
last year, with every important city except New York
and Kansas City showing a gain. These figures indi
cate that the smasli in stocks is confined to Wall
street and that general business is undisturbcL The
two failures at the close of the week were not at all
commercial. They were speculative collapses and in
jio wise reflective; of the condition of business
throughout the country.
COMMERCIAL interest centered in Wall
street last week, but the prolonged and sen
sational decline in railway and industrial
shares produced little effect on the body of general
trade. Another new and felicitous expression has
been coined out of the current shrinkage in stock
market values and expresses the situation exactly, "A
rich man's panic." The farmer and merchant arc
watching the tumble of the speculative market with
interest, but Vithout trepidation. No real legitimate
business interest has really suffered thus far, with the
exception of iron and steel, which show a lessened
demand with weakened prices.
Evidently liquidation in Wall street is not yet over.
Jt is agreed on all sides that the values of stocks
have now got down to at least their true level and in
many cases below it, and the general expectation is
for a pronounced rally, which is expected to turn up
any day. But the pendulum has not yet. begun to
swing back. It swung too far up a 3'ear or two ago
and is now swinging too far down in the natural ad
justment of values to their true level. Out of this
decline, unless all signs fail, a more stable market
will emerge, with its diseased and hampering ele
ments sloughed off, with its millions of overcapitali
zation vanished into thin air, its reckless plungers
humbled and its gaudy plumage plucked. The resulf,
cannot but be beneficial to general trade, and the
great body of the American people know it. Hence
they are not alarmed and general trade goes on
serenclv in the even tenor of its way.

BOSTON has recently entertained 30,000 teach
ers, gathered within her confines to attend the
convention of the National Asso
ciation Her people knew they were coming and all
classes, from the venerable codfish aristocracy and
the literary Brahmins down to the city Aldermen arid
newspaper men, prepared for their reception. Boston
did the best she knew how, and when it comes to the
entertainment of educators she flattered herself that
she knew it all: but now tha^t the teachers have come
and gone she .sits astonished, confessing not only to
herself but to the world that she knew nothing.
It seems that throughout the whole time of the
convention Boston was receiving surprise after sur
prise and shock after shock. For the opening of the
convention a grand mass reception was prepared in
a hall capable of seating 17,600 people. Something
like 7,0,000 tried to get in and the result was a scram
ble. A Boston correspondent of the New York
Herald in noting the happenings of the occasion says:
"After the first rush and when the seats were all filled
about 300 women managed to get in, and being un
able to obtain chairs sat on the floor in an open space
to the right of the platform.' Boston was aghast."
Worse things that that were to happen. The report
goes on to say:>"The most remarkable thing about
the meeting was the quickness with which the curi
osity of the throng was satisfied. Less than an hour
after tlie proceedings had begun â long enough for the
visitors to get a glimpse of Dr. Eliot and those they
had heard so much aboutâ the speakers were talking
to empty seats and at times had to pause in their re
marks while hundreds left the hall."
From that time on the teachers saw Boston, but
snubbed the Bostonians. Despite the fact that 30,000
were in the city it was never possible to get more
than 2000 together for a meeting. The teachers
skipped the lectures and addresses Boston had pre
pared and took to sightseeing, boating and bathing.
Receptions were offered by the leading families, but
the schoolmarms did not attend. We are told:
"At some, where 300 invitations were sent out, less
than a third of that number responded, and some of
the leading members of the North Shore colony who
had made elaborate preparations for the entertain
ment of the educationists were surprised to find that
only a few accepted."
The schoolmarms in fact were having too good' a
time to waste it on receptions or convention meet
ings. They would not even read the papers con
taining accounts of the proceedings. We are told:
"Although the Boston papers added more pages and
devoted almost their entire space to lengthy dis
courses on the proper methods of instructing the
young idea in his different stages of development
there is little to show that the visitors were at all
interested in the display of enterprise."
Having thus snubbed lectures, society and the
press, the girls actually complained that they "were
being watched by policemen in uniform and in plain
clothes," and the Herald correspondent says: "Sev
eral of both kinds were in evidence, and the Western
ers assert that besides being watched their right to
be present was questioned in several instances."
Why Boston should have^. put her police on the
track of the inland teachers is not stated. Perhaps
she was bewildered and knew not what she did, or
perhaps she was afraid they would steal her senses
away and rob her of her propriety. Whatever may
have. been the cause of the spying the watching was
in vain. Not a single teacher was arrested in her
effort to use Boston as a merry-go-round. The
girls had a good time. It is stated that when they
went to the beach to bathe they astonished the
natives, "although Revere Beach is anything but a
Puritanical resort." Finally it is noted: "The West
erners took more kindly to the camera than Bosto.i
girls do.""
Altogether Boston seems to have had a delightful
experience, and while she professes to be shocked
it is probable she would like to have the teachers call
again.

REPORTS from Europe are to the effect that
but little Encouragement has been given to the
commissions of the United States and of Mex
ico now visiting various capitals for the purpose of
arranging an international agreement to fix the ex
change value between silver and gold. It is said
that neither London nor Paris promised much, while
in Berlin a* decided refusal was given to the whole
undertaking. In fact the reports tend to the con
clusion that in the opinion of Europe the visit of the
commissions will be wholly in vain.
It will be remembered that the object of the two
commissions is to obtain from European govern
ments an agreement to a programme in relation to
silver coinage which would materially aid not only
Mexico, but China and other silver, using countries,
in shifting their currency from a silver to a gold
basis. The negotiations have been conducted with
as little publicity as possible and no definite state
ment of the plan proposed has been given out, even
if such a plan has been yet devised. The reports
therefore are not to be deemed final, but there is
something ominous in the recent dispatch from Ber
lin to the effect that not only did the German Gov-Â»
ernment refuse to bind itself to any silver purchases
whatever, but that it is known in Berlin "from a
trustworthy source" that" neither Great Britain nor
France was inclined to be any more favorable.
The issue is one of high importance, for at the
present time currency problems are occupying the at
tention of a considerable portion of the world. Â¦ To
begin with, the United States is already engaged in
providing the Philippines with a silver currency based
upon gold standards of value. Mexico is preparing
to accomplish a similar object by somewhat different
methods. Pressure has been put upon China to fol
low the example, and her Government , may be forced
to do so owing to the enormous indemnity she has to
pay to European powers and the difficulties in the
way of providing payment under existing conditions.
Finally it has been believed that Great Britain would
be willing to join in some sort of programme looking
to a solution- of the problem by reason of the large
interests that India has in the value of silver.
Just what difficulties have been found in the way
of the commissions has not b.een made clear, but it
may bt inferred from the reports that no nation feels
inclined to bind itself to any fixed programme. Each
feels itself competent by one method or another to
maintain its silver currency as a subsidiary coinage
at par wjth its gold, and does not care to venture
upon helping the rest of the world. The Berlin re
ports say that Germany has in fact a large volume
of silver for which she has at present no use and
which she cannot put into circulation, and conse
quently will not even so much as listen to a proposal
that she undertake to purchase more. Britain and
France are not so loaded with silver, but they have
enough and are inclined to let well enough alone.
The United States of course can keep the Philippine
currency safe without difficulty, so that our interest in
the matter is mainly one of friendliness. Such being
the case it is easy to understand the European belief
that the whole scheme will fail.
It is indeed a difficult matter to' obtain international
agreements upon any subject. Many efforts in that
direction have been made for one object or another in
recent years, but none has as yet succeeded. All at
tempts to form an international system of currency
or of weights and measures have been futile. So too
have been the repeated efforts to bring about in Eu
rope a partial disarmament, and the later attempts to
arrange an international tariff to protect. the indus
tries of continental Europe against the so called
''American invasion." It is evident that while inter
national agreements on subjects of universal interest
and importance may prevail in the future that future
is as yet far distant.
In this particular case something more than
national dislikes to international pledges is at work
in opposition to the plan proposed. Financiers have
learned that the operation of natural law in the com
mercial world is the only thing that can determine
the relation in value of gold to silver or of any other
one object to another object, and while financiers
and merchants would like to see the establishment of
a universal gold standard and cordially approve of
any well directed step in that direction, they do not
| like to try to hasten it by what they fear may be arti
ficial means.
It is to be noted finally that the object of the
United States in appointing a commission to co
operate as it were with that of Mexico is in no sense
an effort to give silver an artificial value or to at
tempt to fix a ratio regardless of natural values. We
have had of late too hazardous an experiment at
home in that sort of thing to venture upon it again.
The object of our Government has been to promote
as far as possible the establishment of the gold stand
ard even among silver using peoples and to reduce
the currency fluctuations which now interfere with
international commerce and so frequently occasion
heavy losses to innocent people. If then, as Euro
pean reports indicate, the work result in immediate
failure, it may none the less prove valuable as a cam
paign of education, leading in the end to something
of permanent value to the world.
RUSSIA'S POWERFUL FLEET IN ASIATIC
WATERS READY TO ENGAGE IN BATTLE
If it be the duty of the militia to maintain order when
called upon by the rightful, authorities, so it is the
duty of the public to sustain the guardsman when he
has bravely fulfilled his duty. Governor Durbin has
found it necessary to meet the Evansville situation by
saying: "I am sorry for those who are so foolish as
to turn on their protectors. To discharge a man
from employment because he responded to a callof
his State is an act of treason." v
The words are none too. strong for the occasion.
The Evansville riots threatened at one time to be
come so serious as to virtually turn the city over to a
mob. Had that occurred the business men of the
city would have suffered heavy loss of property even
if they had been in no danger of their lives. There
fore when they dismiss such members of the guard
as are in their employ they literal^', as Governor
Durbin says, "turn upon' their protectors." It would
be a sad day for America if such antagonism to the
National Guard should become the prevailing senti
ment in any community. It would be in the fullest
sense treason to the republic, for in every commun
ity there must be some source of protection against
mob violence, and if that protection cannot be as
sured by a ritizen soldiery such as has been and is the
pride of the United States, then the task would fall
to the army, and that would be the beginning of a
new and untried era in our history as a self-governing
people. Â¦_ ..- . . -

The week will be divided between "The

The Orpheus Comedy Four is as well
received as last week. A better quartet

James J. Morton, as a monologue artist,
makes a decided hit. All of his stories

The painter was standing in a large
waste paper basket beside the telephone.
On a nearby table was a collection of
shoes, rulers, paper weights and Ink bot
tles. Wrapped around his left arm wa3
the office towel and in his right hand a
massive clock key. The painter was pre
pared to sell, his life dearly.
"Awfully sorry," said Smith. "I forgot
all about the dog."
"I'm sorry, too. Been . here since 7:20

the telephone bell rang.
"It's been ringing all day," volunteered
the new servant. "I never meddles with
what ain't my business, but whoever that

"Who? Oh. the painter. Well. What?

IF Ed ' Smith of the Golden Shore

business clean and freshly painted.
Smith supplies the larders of deep water
ships with all kinds of edible flesh. He
boards new arrivals and no matter how

office where Smith the butcher writes his
letters and keeps his books.
Smith decided on Saturday that his of
fice needed a new coat of paint. As he
walked up Clay street he met the painter
who had on previous occasions done for
the office what Smith's tailor so frequent
ly does for Smith.
"When can you do it?" asked Smith, af
ter describing the growing nakedness of
the office woodwork.
"Any time I can get in. there," said the
painter.
"Work on Sunday? Will you do It to

also^nother, "E. E. Sehmltz for Mayor." The

political grafters who are endeavoring to mis
lead the public through fai?e representation.
The Union I^abcr Central Club as a representa

and deprecates the actions of these Impostors,
whose aims and objects are to disrupt the
Vrion Labor party and turn the name over to

in the Superior Court, but are preparing
for a battle at the primary election. ThÂ«-
Harders-Berger forces, who are support
ing the Casey end of the party, are get

recognition by the courts, as their Coun

neighDorhood were shattered. The .other
boy was some distance away and escaped
with a few burns. The dead boy was the
son of G. Gianetto. a produce merchant.

Even coursing was the day's feature at
Ingleside Park yesterday. Straight down
the card the favorites gained the flag with
but few exceptions.
In the open stake Flora Belle won first
honors, beating Conroy In a deciding
course in which she refused the Rocklln
dog a point.
From the start Flora made the, going
easy for herself and when the last flag
of the stake was raised there was but
one point scored against her during the
day's trials.
Conroy, the runner up, was not so for
tunate, having to extend himself in every
course. [
Prometheus, the carriage dog, so called
because of his peculiar markings, looked
to have a chance to go through the stake,
but fell a victim to hard coursing and had
to be withdrawn.
In the third round he had a trial with
Loretta. The dogs were slipped to a hare
that gave them a merry outing over the
entire field.
Relief dogs were turned loose, but the
pair In possession took another hold and
virtually ended the course without assist
ance. '
The upset of 'the day was the defeat of
Pasha Pleasant by Medley at 4 to 1.

Full Moon, the blue son of Moondyne
.II, won the open stake for greyhounds
yesterday at Union Coursing Park. He
had a severe trial in the second round
with McVey, but it did not seem to dull
his speed.
The bettors made Fair Tralee a 3 to
5 favorite over him in the fourth round.
They overlooked him again in the semi
finals In his course with Lord Brazen,
making the latter a 2 to 5 choice. In the
deciding course Full Moon beat False
Alarm cleverly by a score of 8 to 5. This
time he was a strong favorite.
Palo Alto was beaten by Lord Brazen
in the fourth round by a score of 6 to 0.
The big dog did not try to exert himself
and fell easy prey to the Lacy Crawford
crnck.
Several Futurity candidates were out
and made a good showing. M. C. Dela
no's McVey by Fetter Free-Dawn showed
a lot of class. He was finally retired by
the ultimate winner. Fair Tralee, T. J.

tired to his kennel by the same grey
hound after he had led to the hare. The

For years sportsmen have been making
an annual pilgrimage to the valley, equip

fitted with automatic reels and enough
gear to almost require the services of an

B. Fafctor, O. A. Bremer and F. E.

rosults follow:
There was a large representation of
marksmen at Sh<vl Mound Park rifle
range yesterday. The strong breexe that
prevailed kept the scores down. Com
ranles C. G and A. First Infantry Regi
ment, National Guard of California, held
their semi-annual State shoot for deco

at Oakland held a quarterly competitive
match, while the Gerraania. Golden Gate,

George F. Sfydcn of Company C did

good score of 47 out of 50 on the com

"L have formed this opinion," said
Ryan, "upon what Jeffries told me after
his previous fight with Corbett and also
upon the comparatively poor showing he
has made in his recent fights. Like many
others he is undoubtedly surprised at
Corbett's present condition."
The big assembly hall at Croll's Gar
dens was crowded to suffocation yester
day with people curious to see Corbett
In action. He boxed three rounds with
Kenny and then retired. The heat and
closeness of the hall made it an undesir
able place for a boxer to perform, so Jim
wisely cut out the remainder of his work
with Sam, Berger, who breathed a sigh of
relief when he found he would not have
to play the part of an animated punching
bag for the edification of the spectators.
"When Jeffries and Fitzsimmons fought
here my brother Harry was authorized to
enter the ring and issue a challenge on
my behalf. Jeffries asked him as j# favor
not to do so, promising to sign articles
for a fight with me within three months.
He left the State without doing so and I
had to shame him into signing articles
for our forthcoming fight."
Tommy Ryan freely expressed the opin
ion yesterday that Jeffries would like to
avoid meeting Corbett.
"The fight is set for August 14, and
my training has been outlined to place me
In the ring on that night at my best. I
expect to be there, and if Jeffries does
not appear I will claim his $2500 forfeit
money. After that 1 will ignore h!m and
will entertain no proposition from him.
If Jeffries has been careless in his train
ing or in handling pet bears that is no
fault of mine and I should not suffer be
cause of It.
The intimation which has floated down
from Lake County to the effect that Jef
fries was not satisfied with his health or
his condition and might ask for a post
ponement of the light set hundreds of
tongues wagging yesterday at Alameda.
"I think Jeffries has heard of the excel
lent condition into which I am round
ing." said Corbett yesterday, "and is get
ting scared. He sidestepped me for a
couple of years and now seems to have
an aggravated case of cold feet.
Jim Corbett and his followers answer
both these questions In the affirmative.
Have the favorable reports which have
gone out from the latter's quarters In
Alatceda given thÂ« burly man from Los
Angeles a haunting- fear that the cham
pionship crown is to pass from him?

The Angels indulged in both defeat and
victory on the baseball field yesterday.
just enough to increase their lead in the
race and give them the series by four
games out cf six. In the morning at Oak
land they never had a chance, while the
San Francisco men amassed tallies and
v/ere there with plenty to waste. Score
9 to 1. The afternoon game was different,
and the Angels were never headed. Score
i to 1.
The home team could do little of any
thing in the latter struggle, while in the
first game they performed like cham
pions. The big Sunday crowd was disap
pointed, for the game was not what It
might have been in either tho hitting or
fielding departments.
Hall and his curves were In evidence all
the time. Iberg was easy, and in the fifth
he retired in favor of HoOson. The latter
fared better, allowing but a pair of hits.
It was not due so much to the visitors'
stick work, but to errors at ( critical
stages, that caused the four runs.
Little Jacobs had a bad day behind the
bat. The lad seemed unable to throw at
all, and three of his pegs at the bases
were wild and allowed runners to ad
vance. Lynch's error was also costly, as
well as one by Delmas and Iberg.
The Angels fielded well at every stage
of the game. Toman committed the only
miscue by throwing wide to first. The re
mainder of the team performed well, and
every ball that was hit waa fielded clean
ly and with that snap and vim which
have marked the work of the Angel team
during the series.
In the first round of the game the An
gels registered- Hoy was passed, and an
out advanced him a station. Then a Tex
as leaguer which Smith dropped to short
center field put Hoy over.
In the fourth Gravath singled. Ross sac
rificed. Toman and Spies hit and during
the mix-up Lynch threw the ball away
and two runs happened.
Smith got the last one during the fifth.
An error by Delmas allowed him to go as
far as third without a stop. Then Dillon
bunted a slow one along the first base
line, keeping out of Iberg's way long
enough to permit Smith to finish his jour
ney.
It was Kelly who gave the locals their
lone tally. This happened in round five,
when Lynch beat out a short one to tho
infield and was fleet enough to steal the
second bag. Then the King produced one
of his now famous pop fly hits to right,
and Lynch arrived with the tally which
kept disgrace at a distance. The score:

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, July 26.â Every indication
points to a wonderfully successful race
meeting at Saratoga this year. The cream
of the Western stables is now on the
ground and by the time the races begin
at the Spa the very best horses In train
ing from both the East and the West will
be seen in spirited rivalry. Not even the
Suburban handicap was more interesting
than the $12,000 Saratoga handicap will
be. New estimates by the official handi
capper as to the present form of the
horses entered in that race will surround
that valuable prize with far more grounds
for discussion than usually Invests a mid
summer event.
The presence of McChesney and Sava
ble in the Saratoga event and the likeli
hood of both being starters for it, togeth
er with Waterboy, Hermis, Irish La'd.
Africander, Blues, Bonnibert, Golden
Maxim, Caughnawaga and Goldsmith or
Gunfire, will titly characterize this as the
most Important midsummer race of the
year and perhaps most interesting of the
whole season, by reason of the sectional
flavor now attaching to it.
Additional attractions for the opening
day will be the Flash stakes for two
year-olds and the Casballston cup, a
hunter's steeplechase, for which there
are thirty-seven entries. In the Flash
some new performers will be Introduced
to the public, notably some of John San
ford's, one of William C. Whitney's,
called Mercury, and one or more of J. E.
Madden's.
There no doubt will be the usual
amount of speculative interest In the
races to be run this week at Jamaica, but
It Is Idle to expect to see much In the
matter of class when nearly all the^great
stables are now at Saratoga awaiting the
opening of the season there. That there
are still plenty of horses of medium cali
ber in and about the metropolis is appar
ent from the number entered in the seven
races to be run to-morrow. The experi
ment-of a short summer meeting cutting
in before Saratoga will be watched with
interest.

8There are about 30.000 automobiles in
use In the United States.
A possible use for these camps Is sug
gested by the success of an experiment
tried, by a Pittsburg physician who Is a
firm believer In the open-air treatment for
tuberculous troublesâ a treatment .which
at no distant date will be generally adopt
ed. The physician, I>r. Flick by name,
purchased an abandoned lumber camp in
the hills of Pennsylvania and converted It
into a sanitarium by repairing the shan
ties and adding a number of tents to the
equipment. There he takes his patients
and compels them to lead a rough, out
door life, .with no luxuries but plenty of
fresh air and plain, nourishing food. He
Is said to have made a great many cures
by his treatment, and his sanitarium is
crowded with patients the year round.â
Milwaukee Sentinel.
Scattered throughout Northern Wiscon
sin are scores of abandoned lumber
camps, some of them comprising buildings
enough to form small villages If they
were occupied and most of them, Includ
ing at least one commodious log house,
commonly called a "shanty," capable of
sheltering many people in snug If not ele
gant quarters. Though they were left to
decay -when they had served their pur
pose, many of these camps are still in a
fair state of preservation, and a compara
tively small expenditure would make them
habitable. And in the majority of cases
they occupy land that could be bought
for a few dollars an acre.

The searchers scattered in three direc
tions. Postmaster Schmidt went to the
site that International used to occupy,
thinking it might have come back in the
night. But It hadn't. Postmaster Schmidt
learned by inquiry, however, that the
town had been shipped to Alameda, after
it had been loaded on three flat cars. Fol
lowing this clew to Alameda. he discover
ed the dismantled village in the freight
yards In that town.
The finding of the lost city was enough
for Postmaster Schmidt and to-morrow he
proposes to get warrants in Martinez for
the arrest of R. B. Mott and W. I. Sedg
ley for making away with the town.
Schmidt has been advised that Mott and
Sedgley had no right to take the village
after It had been foreclosed upon and
it is upon this advice that he is going to
make his charges.
It was worse than looking for the hang-
Ing gardens of Babylon, far worse- than
searching for the ruins of buried Nineveh
and a chimerical chase compared with the
pursuit of At!antls. Not so much a3 a
splinter betrayed the. site of the vanished
village. It w^s only a bare expanse of
plowed acres. Aladdin with his little
lamp could not have made a better clean
up. '
The discovery was made at the ex
pense of a whole day's search. In which
were engaged Postmaster Schmidt. School
Director William J. Schmidt and Anson
S. Blake, erstwhile directors of the In

Robert B. Mott and W. 1. Sedgley were

manager respectively.
The. once flourishing village of Interna
tional, that little Jumping-ofC place in

three carloads of splinters and boards and
nails, miles away from the scene of its
former hopes and activities.

If Carsten would content himself with
an imitation of tbe fish and game laws,
and advocate a closed season for the ap
pendix the suggestion might be worthy
of serious consideration. Perhaps It
might be better for everybody if no ap
pendices were taken, say. between the 1st
of July and the 1st of October, and none
less than four years old and not more
than twenty-five by any one surgeon* In
a season, unless the taking of the appen
dix were absolutely necessary to feeding
the doctor's family. Tnis would be a rea
sonable regulation, and It would tend to
eliminate the mere pot hunter, who slash
es recklessly, and has a tendency to re
move more appendices than his bank ac
count really requires.
However, the details of the closed sea
son can be worked out later. We have no
desire to usurp any of the medical soci
ety's functions; but it Is none too soon to
protest against the pernicious doctrine
that a man has a right to keep his vermi
form appendix merely because It is
healthy, or that he has any property
rights whatever in his appendix. The
time has not yet come to beat the scalpels
into plowshares and the forceps Into
pruning hooks.â Detroit Free Press.
At this late day we cannot accept Dr.
Carsten's theory that a healthy appen
dix ought not to be removed. An appen
dix is an appendix whether healthy or not.
and modern surgery definitely ascer
tained that the function of the appendix
is to be amputated. That is its place in
the economy of man, and for countless
ages nature has directed her efforts, in
the process of evolution, to .the beneficent
work of producing a vermiform appendix
that could be easily separated from the
patient together with $250. She has suc
ceeded, and when Dr. Carsten advises
that the appendix be left alone to wither
and flap like the last leaf on the tree. It
strikes us that he Is counseling the sur
geons to violate the ordinances of nature.
Dr. John Henry Carsten's argument to
the state medical society against the In
discriminate removal of the vermiform ap
pendix appears to be Irregular and un
ethical. We .have always been taught
to believe that vermiform appendices were
what the lawyers call ferae naturaeâ
wild things in which nobody can claim
property, and which anybody is free to
take. The better the appendix, the better
the operation, and the more sport in the
chase.

CONTINUED PURSUIT OF
VERMIFORM APPENDIX
Dr. Veranus A. Moore, professor of
pathology and bacteriology of Cornell
University, who has just finished a visit
to the University of California, does not
believe that cattle only partly afflicted
with tuberculosis are unfit food for human
consumption. In a pamphlet on the sub
ject of bovine tuberculosis Dr. Moore says
that an animal may be diseased in several
parts of Its body with the germs of con
sumption and yet the parts unscathed will
be perfectly safe to eat.
This fact has been established after
many tests with never a fatal result.
Butchers and cattlemen bavo become
cognizant of the discovery and now meat
goes on tables every day in America that
has been cut from beeves slightly affected
with tuberculosis. Even the Government
has lately withdrawn Its embargo from
this class of cattle and ordered . Its in
spectors to pass that which is not dan
gerously afflicted.
Dr. Moore finds that this must be done,
for if all the animals afflicted witb tuber
culosis were to be thrown away, there
would be very little meat left for people
to eat, so extensive is the disease among
animals. Besides this It would make pau
pers of thousands of cattle men. When
the accuracy of the tuberculin test was
demonstrated a crusade against the dis
ease was started. It was found, however,
when the extent of the disease was appre
ciated, that the cost would be so enormous
that legislative bofiles hesitated to make
the necessary appropriations. Now care
ful scientific investigations have brought
about a better understanding of tbe real
nature of the disease and eradication of
the animals will be unnecessary.

MICE AND BED ANTS
IN TOP OF SKYSCRAPER
"Where do the mice come from? is a
question as hard to answer as where do
pins go," said a New York architect.
"My office Is on the seventeenth or top
story of a modern buildins in the Wall
street district. All its walls are solid, and
there are no hollows, such as are found
in a wooden building. The spaces under
the wooden flooring are filled with ce
ment; the washboards are marble, where
steam pipes run through the floors the
openings are sealed with metal, so that
one cannot find a cranny to conceal, much
lees passages for, even a mouse. Yet
mice are there, concealed somewhere,
making their way somehow from floor to
floor until they have reached the upper
most.
"Only the other day I looked up from
my work and saw a small gray mouse. I
skated a flat paper weight across the
floor at him, and though it only struck
the letter file the fright half kUIed him.
Then I learned that I had undone, in a
second, the work of six months, as It
turned out that my stenographer had
been cultivating Mr. Mouse's friendship
with bits of bread and candy.
"The engineer says there are rats in
the basement, where they have tallow and
oil and soap to live on, but they do not
come above the first floor. He showed me
once a thin procession of red ants pass
ing in and out of a crack in the marble
floor of the tenth story hall.
"They must have come up by minute
and devious crevices to this point one
hundred and twenty' odd f#et from the
level of the street. But even so, their
presence was strange, for all the ground
except Trinity Church yard, two blocks
away, is completely and solidly covered
Â¦with buildings and pavings. There is not
a single square inch of barÂ© soil in- tho
vicinity."

The first meeting of the city trustees
when the applications of the Southern
Pacific for the two franchises will be
taken up for consideration will ue on Mon
day, the third of next month. The city
trustees will then announce the names
of the fifty citizens they have selected to
assist them in handling the franchise ap
plications. City Clerk James W. Glllogly
says that under an amendment to the
statutes of the State the franchises will
not have to be advertised as the local
lines come under the head of tho6e doing
interstate business.
There is nothing to indicate that the
city trustees are prompted by anything
but the best of intentions to adjust the
franchises and bring the agitation that Is
disturbing the city to a satisfactory term
ination. While the unsettled state of
affairs exists business men and property
owr.ers claim that there will fce no ad
vancement and more than one property
holder who contemplated building has de
layed commencing until such time as he
is certain what kind of train service Ala
meda is to have in the future.
ALAMEDA. July 2Câ With the issuance

eight prominent residents and property
owners for a meeting to discuss matters
concerning the welfare of Alameda and
for the purpose of "stimulating public
spirit," the agitation over the applications
of the Southern Pacific Company for two
local franchises lias received another Btir.
There are some who profess to believe
that the Southern Pacific Is behind the
movement which resulted Jn the city
trustees deciding to select fifty citizens to
advise with it In settling tbe matter of
the franchises and that the corporation
induced the twenty-eight citizens to call
a meeting of property owners to be held
En the City Hall on the night of August 5.
â¢The Passing of Pope Leo" was the
subject of an address delivered this even-
Ing by the Rev. R. C. Brooks, pastor of
Pilgrim Congregational Church. ,
The Rev. H. J. Vcnburgh, pastor of the
First Baptist Church, gave a brief ad
drees this morning on Pope Leo.
On the whole the world will bt> fortunate If
the successor of L#o jruves to be as good and
Â»:r^at, as !;b*ral and enlightened, as was LÂ«eo
XJII. His whfic reien has made for peace and
lor a be-ttrr understanding between the Cath
olic church and the Protestant wcj-ld. I do
net for a moment believe him to have been
tho vicar of i"hrUt. but I da cheerfullv pay
tribute to the fact that he was a devout Chris
tian end a frreat statesman.
Dr. Dille presented his views on the
life of Pope Leo aa those of a Protestant
clergyman {riving the Oead Pontiff full
measure of respectful tribute for the In
fluences he exerted for good in the world.
Durlr.g his remarks the pastor said:
Among the crrat personage* of our epoch,
ti.-rp with I!i>mÂ«rck, Gladstone and Lincoln,
rnuÂ«t be reckoned *Vpe \jeo XIII. nut only U
ik'jm- of t.Â« position and i:iflu*-aeÂ»\ but l>**

other petition in the world so influential aÂ«
the Roman pontificate, for the Pope ru!Â«-s di
rectly from the chair of Peter nvre than two
hundred niilliims of human beings and indi
rectly Influences The whole world.
Hi* immediate j.rf(!ece t -For, Piur IX. wm a

cair.ed in pow-r a-rd influence.
PEISOirEB IN VATICAN.
"""When Tope P'Lt IX came to the Pope>
chair Italy was ripe ior revolution. The Gov
ernment of the Uourbons in Italy had long
been feeble, corrupt anJ cruel, and in Rome
a series of Jn*i(rniflcant P^pes, politically
Â»:Â¦â¢< ,. â¢ -. had occupied the papal chair from
J'lUF VI. whom Naixjleon dethroned and ban
ished, and Pius VII. who first crowned Na
poleon then excommunicated him. and was
Imprisoned by him. to Gregory XVI. who died
la me.
Enr after Victor Emmanuel created a united
Italy, with EtoSM for its political capital, ana
took away from the Pojxs the temporal power
Â¦ Pius IX and Le> XIII never left thÂ« Vatican
incloeure. remaining there, voluntary prisoners
as a silent protest _,-..:-â¢. the loes of the tem
lÂ»oral power.
The Popt us*Â»d to go to Ft. Peter's from tht
Qulrinal palace, to the roll of drums and in*
roar of cannon, for he was a temporal sover
eign, ruling the s'.at*-s of yie church; now he
, Itoes Into the Vatican a Cardinal and comrs
out a corpse, for he is not a temporal ruler, |
but a private citizen, and a subject of the j
yountr Kin* Victor Emmanuel.
When Piue IX died the papal power and
prettige had about reached its lowest ebb.
His was one of the most unpopular govern
ments known to history. In the place of Pius
IX the Cardinals, Jn February. 1ST*, on the
third ballot, by a vote of 44 out of Cl, elected
Joachim Vincente Pecci, then Cs years of age â
the man who under the name Of Leo XIII died
last Monday aped 93 years and 5 months.
Immediately upon his areesMon to the triple
erov.rj there was ip-eat interest throughout the
*orld. as there is to-day, with regard to his
successor, as to what his policy would be â
as to whether he would be a hide-bound con
servative !ike Plus IX. refusing to recognire
modern progress and modern thought cr
whether he would be a liberal pontiff, striving I
to adapt the church to the spirit of' this en
l;Fh:Â«-r.ed 8 K p - It was purposed by many who
knew his tact and brvadth of views that he
would come to & compromise with the Italian
Government and thus end the antagonism be
tween the Vatican and the kingdom of Italy.
But In r.1* very first encyclical he unhes
itatir.Rly maintained Pius IX's demand for the
restoration of the temporal power, and he
never left the Vatican lnclonure. remaining
there a constructive prisoner as a silent pro
test against the loss of the temporal power.
SMALL PERSONAL EXPENSE.
It is true the Vatican palace and gardens
are a? exter.y'.ve as a city. The Pope's house
hold expenses are J1.OWJ.000 a year and his
income durlr.g his Jubll*-* year was $4,5uO.G<K>.
though hig personal expenses were only 50
oents a day; but however large and however
rilded the cape, the captive is a captive still.
There were doubtless tlmeu when Leo longed
tor greater liberty of movement and In the
rickenlng summer heat and malaria of Rome
lorjfed foi the pure brr^zes of h'.s mountain
fcorr.e at Carplneto
The Italian Goverritnert put no restraint
Xipon his movements, lie cciu'.d go about the
ftreets of Rome just as freely as anybody,
if he chsse to do Â«o. Why did he not? Be
cause he could not go out Â«-xcept as the guest
of the King of Italy, whom he regarded as
a usurper.
Kut there Is another reason why the Pop*
*tajed within the Vatican and why the Ital
ian Government, which Is responÂ«lble for his
safety, is very much relieved to have him do
â¢o.
The Fope'e life, would rot have been safe In
the street* of Rome at any time during his
reign. Why. hÂ« <!ld r.ot dare to show himself
to the peopl* from the balcony of St. Peter's
even during his Jubilee for fear of Insult. I
An not mean that the most of the Italians
themselves would not treat the Pop* with
every respect if he should go out on the
etreets. The King, who is tolerant in religious
matters and is a gentleman, would treat the
Pop* with the highest consideration; and the
Queen, who Is not only a Catholic, but a very
devout one. would be overjoyed if r he could
b* presented to the Pope and eotild kneel and
he blessed by him. But unfortunately neither
Rome nor modern Italy Is peopled wholly by
civilized Italians. The Eternal Citr Is the
greatest hotbed of anarchy i n the world; near
ly all the asssypins of rulers In the last fifty
years ha%-e been Italians. What chance would
any Pope have for his life in the streets of
Rome? For he is hated by anarchists far
more than any living sovereign, for he repre
sents eomethlr.gr that anarchv has to fear more
than any king or ruler in the world.
Of the 200 Popes that have sat In th* chair
cf Peter. Xew have exerted a wider Influence
on the social, political and religious world
then Pope Leo XIII. In the course of his
I-rentiScate he has issued a series of lumin
ous encyclicals which have i*rved as moral
landmarks to the Catholic church, and have
commanded the r**rpect "-nd admiration of the
civilized world. Among these is the encyclical
on Christian marriage In JSSO. In which he
vindicate* the e^nctlty and the in
<J!sso!ubillty of the .rnarriare bond. The en
cyclical on th<? condition of the workingmen
issued la 1S91 was an exhaustive document on
thÂ« rights and duties of the laboring classes.
The third encyclical was issued In 1S95 and in
It Pop* L*o demonstrate* that the Catholic
church can adapt herself to alt forms of civil
rovernntent. To Leo's statesmanship and as
tctenes* are due the revocation of the May laws
In Germany which made belonring to a re-
Ilgicus order a crime against the state; the
separation of the clergy in France from the
loyalist movement, the skillful management of
the question cf the friars In tbe Philippines.
On the whole the world will be fortunate If
the successor of Leo proves to be as good and
great, as liberal and enlightened as was L*o
XIII. His whole reign has made for peace
f. r. 1 for a better understanding between the
Catholic church asd the Protestant world.

One hundred acres of land In the sand
hills of the Dismal River forest reserve,
Nebraska, were planted this spring by
the Bureau of Forestry. On eighty acres
100,000 ping seedlings were set out; the
other twenty acres were sowed with seed.
The work will continue this summer. Tho
nursery will be enlarged so as to cover
two acres, which will hold 2,000,000 seed
lings. The bureau intends to Increase
the size of the nursery gradually so as
to make it grow enough seedling trees
every year to furnish sufficient stock for
the planting. It is Intended ultimately
to turn the whole of the Niobrara and
Dismal River reserves, which are now
barren sand hills, into forest by planting.
The Dismal River reserve Includes 86.000
acres, the Niobrara reserve 126.000. A

Letters and" telegrams received at the
headquarters of the executive committee,
Grand Hotel, lead to the belief that the
throng of visitors in San Francisco from
August 17 to 24 will be larger] than the
first estimate indicated. Dazzling reports
concerning the magnificence of the en
campment have been widely circulated by
enterprising railway representatives in
the States of the East and Middle West.
San Francisco possesses great facilities
for giving food and shelter to a multitude
of visitors, but Grand - Army | Encamp
ment managers must look closely to the
system of assigning visitors to engaged
accommodations.' The crush of incoming
travel will begin Saturday, Augyst, 15, and
continue at high pressure throughout
Sunday and Monday.
The Southern Pacific' and Santa Fe
companies are counting on big. travel, as
they have positive assurance that the
number of Pacific Coast visitors coming
to San Francisco will be the largest ever
handled on this side of the continent.

VETERANS WHO ARE ACTIVE
LY ENGAGED PREPARING
FOR COMING CONCLAVE.
The encampment was highly successful
and will long be remembered- by those
who attended. . " , Â»- -
The last luncheon in camp was greatly
enjoyed by the cadets. Many of their
fair friends partook of the simple camp
fare and enjoyed the novelty of eating
such a meal. Preparations for breaking
camp were under way all morning. At 2
o'clock in the afternoon the ' "general"
was sounded by Buglers Frank Cresalia
and William Buckley. As the last note
of the call was heard the cannon boomed
the signal for lowering tents. ,In an In
stant every tent was dropped to the
ground. All the canvas coverings fell
toward headquarters street. "With great
celerity the cadets folded the canvas and
were ready for the last dress parade of
the encampment. This was an interesting
sight. Thd command, reinforced by the
presence of fifty more cadets who came
down for the last night, marched out on
the Immense field and in the presence of
the largest crowd of the week went
through the evolutions like veterans. The
band, under Lieutenant Williams and led
by First Sergeant Austin M. Morris,
played lively music. When the regiment
marched in review before the commander
and his staff the musicians played "Home,
Sweet Home " THe flag, which had been
hanging at half mast since the death of
the Pope was raised to its peak and then
lowered. The buglers first - sounded re
treat and the cannon was fired. As the
stars and stripes were lowered by Color
Sergeants George Shaw and James Mealey
the band played the national anthem and
sabers were presented in salute. After
this ceremony the regiment marched
through the streets of Santa Clara and
then to the depot, â¢ where the cadets "em
barked on a special train. There was "a
large crowd at the depot, to bid farewell
to the cadets who had made many friends
In the town and vicinity, all of whom
were sorry to see \ them depart. Amid
cheers, fluttering of handkerchiefs and
waving of hats the long train pulled out
and journeyed to this city without inci
dent or delay.
Rev. Father Kenna, president cf Santa
Clara College, presented each cadet with
a badge made of the college colors and
also called J. T. Curley of Company C
before him and pinned a "Xobill" medal
on his breast as a reward for the excellent
work he has done in college during the
past two years.
Tanned by the sun kind looking natty in
their blue uniforms, the membe^ps of the
First Regiment, League of the- Cross
Cadets, returned last night from their
seventh annual encampment at Santa
Clara. The cadets moved out Market
street keeping step to a sjirring march
played by their big band and were greeted
on every side by friends. The boys were
tired and hungry and glad to reach their
armory and be dismissed.
The last day In camp was an Interest
ing one for the cadets and the hundreds
of visitors who entered the lines. In the
morning a solemn military mass was held
in camp. Father O'Ryan was celebrant
and at the conclusion of the picturesque
and impressive ceremonies he tock occa
sion to express the thanks of the regiment
to the residents of Santa Clara for their
cordial treatment of the regiment during
Us encampment. He also showered praise
upon the Jesuit Fathers of Santa Clara
College for the many courtesies shown
the cadets. He complimented Colonel
James E. Power for the able manner In
which he handled his command and kept
discipline in the camp. He also praised
the cadets for the manner in which they
conducted themselves during their stay
in the valley.

CADETS RETURN
IN HAP PY MOOD
Just what move will be made by her
pon, George K. Hooper, has not yet been
decided on. It 1Â« believed that he will re
main with the hotel for a time until the
new management has become familiar
with its busines and then engage in some
other enterprise.
Mrs. Hooper, who has resided with her
family in the hotel for "many years, has
announced her intention of leaving on the
lirst of the month, taking up a residence
in a house on Vallejo street, which some
years back her husband purchased and
remodeled with a view of some day oc
cupying it.
It is said that James P. Donahue was
mainly influenced in his decision by the
fact that he is very friendly with the
father of George W. Hooper, who worked
for him many years, and that Burke was
induced by Donahue to join with him
in favor of the new manager.
The interest of the Hooper family in
the hotel consists mainly In its name and
the prestige which the late major gave It
by his management. The greater part of
the furniture and fixtures are said to be
the property of the owners of the bUild
ir.g.
When the heirs of the estates which
are interested in the hotel property met
to decide who should manage the Occi
dental in the future it is s-aid that Messrs.
Burke of Ireland and Jamrs P. Donahue
of Davenport. Iowa, were in favor of im
mediately giving the control of the hotel
over to Geonre \V. Hooper, notwithstand
ing that George K. Hooper, representing
his widowed mother and his sister, was
ready to take a new lease and continue
the business which his father had built
up during his many years' connection
with the establishment.
This announcement was made yester
day and came a* a surprise to the many
friends of the Hooper family, who were
piven to understand several days ago that
the widow and children of Major Hooper
were to retain an interest in the hotel.
In fact, when the statement was given out
by the representatives of the owners of
the hotel that the establishment was to be
overhauled and released to George W.
Hooper, it was generally understood that
he was acting In the interest of the
Hooper family, but It has since been
learned that the nephew is acting solely
on his own account and that the interest
of the Hooper heirs expires when the new
manager steps in on August L
Although none of those directly Inter
ested in the matter will discuss the sub
ject, it has been learned from a reliable
source that the family of Major Hooper,
after his death, endeavored to secure a
new Uaae to the hotel, but for reasons
which r.o one will explain their offer was
refused in favor of one made by the
nephew, who. for a number of years,
perved in the capacity of steward under
the old and popular management-
Beginning with the new month, the
family of the Sate "William B. Hooper,
â¢which for fo many years conducted the
Occidental Hotel, will permanently retire
from the management of the famous old
hostelry, which will thereafter be con
ducted under the direction of George \V.
Hooper, nephew of the dead lessee.

the Many Friends of
Dead Major.

Mrs. Coffin Says Report
From South Dakota
Society Woman of Boston
Denies She Is Seeking a
NIGHT COOK ACCUSED
OF ROBBING EMPLOYER
Police Looking: for Carl Peterson,
Said to Have Stolen Money
From Restaurant.
Carl Peterson, a cook, employed until
yesterday at the restaurant of Charles W.
Baker, at 38 Seventh street, is being
searched for by the police on suspicion of
having robbed his employer of $30 In cash
and a f;uantity of cigars.
According to the police the money, com
prising the day's receipts, was placed In
a box and hidden behind the counter.
Peterson, who was on the night watch, is
said to have watched hi3 chance and ab
stracted the box with, the money while
alone in the place. Marks on the safe,
where a large sum of money was kept,
indicate that an attempt was made to
gain entrance to that also. When the day
cook went on watch Peterson was miss
ing, and this, coupled with, the disappear
ance of the money, led the proprietor to
the conclusion that the night cook was
guilty of the theft.
Peterson is a member of the Cooks' and
Waiters' Union and is said to be well
known in the city. Detective Regan, who
Is working on the case, is of the opinion
that Peterson Is the man who looted a
church in the Western Addition some
years ago and was sent to San Quentin
for a term. Efforts will be made to iden
tify his photograph in the rogues' gal
lery. A close watch will .be kept on the
Seattle steamers, as it is said that Peter
son recently carnje from there, and it is
thought possible he may attempt to re
turn to his old haunts.
Mrs. Elizabeth Riker Coffin, a former
society belle of Blnghamton, N. Y., whose
marriage two years ago to Frederick S.
Coffln, a member of one of Boston's prom
inent and wealthy families, was a society
event of importance, is- a guest at the
Palace. ., Mrs. Coffin's arrival follows
closely upon a'story telegraphed from her
former home several days ago to Ihe ef
fect that she and her husband had sepa
rated and that the wife had gone to Sioux
Falls . for the purpose of establishing a
residence preliminary to bringing an ac
tion for a divorce. The dispatch referred
to Mrs. Coffin's operatic ambitions and
told of her first meeting and subsequent
marriage to Coffln in the following Inter
esting manner:
Mr. CcIRn -became- acquainted with Miss
Rlker while she was filling an_ engagement in
New York, and showered her with favors. He
paid for Â¦ a trip abroad and secured for her
vocal lessons from the best of Paris teachers.
Then, although he is twenty-five years older
than she. he offered his hand in marriage.
The' couple made an extensive tour of Eu
rope. At Monte Carlo Mrs. Coffin became ac
quainted with the brother of Secretary of the
Treasury Shaw. She became convinced that
she had made a mistake in choosing her life
partner, and Mr Coffln. it is stated, will
not contest the divorce!
F. B Uiker. father of Mrs. Coffin, said
this evening, that Mt was true that his daughter
is suing for a divorce and that he expected
her home in less than two weeks. She will
live with him.
IS NOT SEEKING A DIVORCE.
And now comes the denial of Mrs. Cof
fin, a' strikingly beautiful woman, tall,
stately and graceful, whose every word
uttered in' contradiction to the story pub
lished in connection with her marital af
fairs was emphasized In a dramatic yet
sincere manner. To her, so she professed
last evening, the accounts of her proposed
divorce, as conveyed to her in a copy of
the previous telegrams by her Interviewer,
were startling pieces of news. Not an in
timation had she received during her
Western trip, upon which she is accom
panied by Mrs. E. M. Brooks of New
York, that her name was appearing in
public print, and as she apparently medi
tated over the notoriety she had been un
consciously receiving she paced hurriedly
up and down her room. She frequently
became agitated almost to a point where
a good crying spell seemingly would have
been of great relief to her pent-up feel
ings, and then, suddenly pausing in her
walk, she would emit a heavy sigh and
laugh loudly over what she was pleased
to regard for the moment as a bit of fool
ish gossip, which she was sure had ema
nated from those whom she had regarded
at home as her friends. Discussing the
slory Mrs. Coffin said:
You can say that Mrs. F. S. Coffin of Bos
ton Is not seeking a divorce from her hus
band; 'that she has not been in Sioux Falls
preparing for such a proceedings; that It Is
not her Intentions to bring one and that she
has no acquaintance with a man named Shaw
or any relative of the Secretary of the United
States Treasury.
HAS PARTED FROM HUSBAND.
And then, as some thought of her fam
ily troubles apparently flitted through her
mind, her dark eyebrows contracted upon
her frowning face and she continued in
tones not entirely free from bitterness:
And you might as well state also that Mr.
Coffin Is not a millionaire. Yes, he did have
money, and the members of his family are
still very wealthy, but my husband is not so
fortunate. I never was an actress, never as
pired for fame in that direction, but when a
little girl showed some talent for music, a fact
which my relatives noticed and encouraged mo
to develop. Yes, I traveled abroad,' and con
siderably, but not at the expense of Frederick
S. Coffin. My. uncle. .A. S. Rennie, and it Is
a shame to drag his name into this' horrible
scandal, paid my expenses
It is ' true that Mr. Coffin and myself are
living apart â but what Is the use of discussing
that subect. for It is none of the public's busi
ness. We have been separated for over two
months, during the greater part of which I
have been practically burled in one of the most
isolated and horrid places in the State of
Washington, as. Mrs. Brooks here will testify.
What is she doing with me? Why. acting- the
part of a mother, my dear parent having died
a year ago. Mrs. Brooks has been with me
ever since. "
Mrs. Coffin proceeded to relate how she
first met Coffin at the home of his moth
er and how a. mutual affection, despite
his seniority 'in years, eventually led to
a marriage, which was celebrated in
Grace Church in New York two years
ago, and after reviewing their honeymoon
abroad, which included travels through
all the interesting places in Europe, Mrs.
Coffin referred again to the report of her
meeting with the brother of Secretary of
the Treasury Shaw. Â¦ ,
WIFE IN TRAGIC POSE.
She denied that she was ever In Monte
Carlo, although a second later in describ
ing her experience in Italy she shyly re
marked that she had been very close to
the famous resort. Asked about her hus
band's social, prominence in Brookline,
Boston's suburb, which is really his home,
and his habits as a clubman,' the wife
smilingly replied, with a sudUen change
of 'feeling:
Poor' Freddie. No. he Is not a clubby fellow.
He is just a dear old man, quiet in nature,
who has been very kind' to me. He'll be aw
fully wrought over this affair, Â¦ but it can't
be helped. Dear me! How I would like to
have prevented this horrible story from getting
Into print. Somebody has made my father
say those things about me â Â¦ '
And the smiles again disappeared before
another fierce frown. But in , a minute
she relapsed into a congenial mood
and laughingly referred to gosslpers
as persons without souls. In an extreme
ly serious moment she remarked that she
had^come' to San Francisco with a view
to seeking some place where she might
improve her health, adding:
If it will Interest my friends, or those who
seemingly are taking an unusual - Interest In
my affairs, they may be pleased to know that 1
want to go' to some place where I can obtain
relief from my physical ailment. I will tell
them that I have been planning a trip to Santa
Barbara, but this affair may cause me to
change my mind and return to the East.
That was all that Mrs. Coffin would
have to say regarding her family trou
bles, except when" she expressed a hope
that the press In the East would' give
some space to her side of the story, ."just
for the sake of dear old Freddie."
