The news of the postponement of tha
Czar's visit has created a bad Impression,
as It la regarded as a reflection on Italy s
ability to safeguard him against social
istic demonstrations. In spite of the re
port of M. Lapouklne, the Russian police
agent, who, after three days' investlsa
tlon, predicted manifestations, the Italian
police assert that they are fully able to
accord to the Czar protection, and they
point out that this Is also the view of tho
Russian Embassador at Rome, who re
ported to St. Petersburg that tha Czar
has nothing to fear.

OMAHA, Oct. 13.â Farmers and stock

The big packers have, by their agreement

to the breaking point, and at the samo

meats to Eastern consumers until the
figures paid are far above what they were
one year ago, when the meat trust was
supposed to have been formed.

Daniel Voorhies M'ller of
Torre Haute, Ind.. formerly Assistant At
torney General for the Postoffice Depart
ment in Washington, and his friend.
Joseph M. Johns, an attorney at Rock
ville, Ind. The Government alleges a
conspiracy between these defendants for
the purpose of obtaining money from
John J. Ryan, a turf commissioner, with
offices in Cincinnati and St.. Louis, for
protecting him in the use of the mails to
further his schemes.
Miller claims absolute ignorance of any
transaction that may have occurred be
tween Ryan and Johns. Johns claims
that he made an ordinary contract with
Ryan, as attorney*, to assist in securing
a decision from the postal department
after presentation of the case. Both de
fendants emphatically deny any under
standing between themselves or with
Ryan, or any conspiracy.
BIG ARRAY OF COUNSEL.
Eminent counsel are engaged on both
sides. Miller and Johns are old friends,
having lived in adjoining counties in In
diana for years, where both have been
prominent politically, proressionally and
otherwise. While District Attorney Sher
man McPherson and his assistants, Mou
liner and Darby, have been working on
the case for .some time, they were as
sisted to-day by Charles H. Robb, As
sistant Attorney General for the Post
offlce Department in Washington: D. C.
Cockran, chief of postofflce inspectors;
Inspectors VIckery and Fulton, who ar
rested Miller and Johns, and others.
The defendants have been indicted Joint
ly on six counts. The Government has
called a dozen witnesses and the defense
three times that many, so that it is ex
pected that the arguments will not be
reached until the latter part of the week.
The witnesses to-day were Richard H.
Webster, a clerk in the legal department
of the Postofflce Department at Wash
ington; J. N. Morrow, a telegraph oper
ator at Rockville, Ind., and John J. Ryan,
the latter being on the stand when court
adjourned. As Ryan's direct examina
tion has not been completed It is believed
that most of the time will be taken up
with his testimony regarding h*is ' tran
sactions with postal officials in Washing
ton and later with Johns as the alleged
middleman at meetings in Terre Haute,
Cincinnati and St. Louis.
JOHN J. RYAN'S TESTIMONY.
Ryan was orrthe stand from 3 o'clock
until court adjourned. He gave a history
and an explanation of his .co-operative
investment company, telling how he ad
vertised in the papers and received an
swers with" money by mall. Last Novem
ber he was called upon by postofflce In
spectors and soon afterward received no
tice from D. V. Miller, as assistant at
torney for the Postofflce Department, that
his turf commissioner ; operations were
fraudulent. Later he had a hearing be
fore Attorneys Christiancy and Miller on
November 11, In Washington, where the
whole auestlon was finally referred to
Miller. * "
At this meeting Ryan promised to re
organize his co-operative Investment com
pany so that his operations as turf com
missioner would come within the require
ments of the postal laws. 'He continued,
however, to have trouble and soon after
his return from Washington he received

and she Is alleged to have violated many
rules of the department with impunfty.
On several occasions Platt Is said to have
called at the department to Investigate
grievances Miss Wood held against per
sons who were in authority over her.
Letters which Senator Platt is said to
have written to Miss Wood have been
shown to many persons in Washington
and are reported to contain many expres
sions of endearment. On one occasion It

MacVeagh's departure from The Hague
left thÂ« interests of Venezuela and the
United States represented by William R.
Penfleld, solicitor of the State Depart
ment, and Herbert W. Bo wen, United
States Minister to Venezuela.
The principal charge against MacVeagh
was that he had written a letter to the
executive council of the tribunal in which
he said in effect, according to the report,
that if the arbitrators were lawyers in
stead of diplomats they would know their
business better. This was regarded as an
Insult to the tribunal.
Another charge was that he went far
beyond his rights as counsel by accus
ir.g the British Go\-ernment of having 1
fomented *TevolutloÂ» against the Vene
zuelan Government. This statement gave
great offense to the United States lega
tion at The Hague, which maintained that
It was unwarranted.

Germany and Italy that they were en

tribution of the Venezuelan indemnity

come from reliable sources, MacVeagh set
the tribunal by the ears and produced
much ill feeling on all sides. It is de
clared that had MacVeagh elected to stay
until the tribunal completed Its work the

against his continuance as counsel. As
It was, consideration was given to the

Among the local colony there are some
veterans of the Japanese army who have
seen hard fighting in the battles of their
country. Among these Is Sergeant Major
N. .Toura, a veteran of Formosa, Yalu,
Taku. Tientsin and Peking. He served
ten years in the army, and Is enrolled In
the veteran reserves. He said that in
case of war with Russia he would have
to go home at once, and he acknowledged
"expecting" such order. The editor of

that he expected ; the news.
FRESNO, Oct. 13.â There was much ex

SAN DIEGO. Oct. 12.-The murder of
Frank Roberts at Brawley some weeks
since bids fair to remain a mystery.
Sheriff. Broadnax Bays the authorities
have not succeeded In capturing the mur
derer, and are almost absolutely without
a clew. He says that robbery was un
doubtedly the object, and that Roberts
was shot from behind.
It was well known in the district where
Roberts lived that he had money and had
several times shown a large amount of
bills at the hotel. Three hundred and
seventy-five dollars was found In his
shack after the crime had been commit
ted, and it is reasonable to suppose that
he had considerable money on his person
when killed. He had no friends or ac
quaintances in the district, having re
cently come there from Idaho and pur
chased 320 acres of land.

Three hundred and fifty refugees from
Malkoternovo have j arrived at Hibibt-

The general situation Is unchanged.
Fear is expressed in many quarters that
the Turks will oppose the application of
the Austro-Russian reform plans.
Turkish troops recently discovered a
hiding place of Insurgents and refugees
in the mountains in the vicinity of Ok

By midnight, however, the troops and
police had gained 1:he upper hand and dis
persed the mob. The streets are now de
serted except for the armed patrols. The
authorities are taking measures to ascer
tain the names of the ringleaders in the
riots. As a result of the intervention of
the Prefect the Etrike leaders have decid
ed to submit the employers' terms to a
referendum of the workmen to-morrow.
One gang set fire to a large quantity of
linen in the cellars of Messrs. Eecquarts'
factory. Others broke the windows of
houses and threw burning straw inside.
The troops, hampered by the obstruc
tions thrown in their way by the rioters,
were for a long time unable to disperse
the. mob.
Finally a determined charge by lancers
restored temporary quiet.
After dark the rioters tore up the sewer
gratings and paving stones and stretched
wires across the streets. Women brought
piles of empty bottles for use as missiles,
while boya swarmed up the lamp posts
and extinguished the gas jets. In spite
of the efforts of the soldiers the rioters
then proceeded to sack tho houses, drag
ging out the furniture, saturating It with
petroleum and setting fire to It in the
street. Fire was put to two houses be
longing to the strikers' employers and one
big factory. The local fire brigade being
inadequate to cope with the conflagra
tions, an urgent appeal was sent to the
neighboring town of Lille, where a steam
pump and reinforcements of firemen were
sent.
ARMENTIERES. North France, Oct 18.
â This town was to-day given up to riot,
pillage and incendiarism as a consequence
of the weavers' strike. Nothing this
morning foretold the serious disturbances
about to occur, but at noon the strikers,
not receiving answers -to their demands
from the employers, broke out into the
wildest excesses. A mob of 6000 gathered
in'the great square and urged the troops
stationed there to throw down their arms,
shouting: "Down .with patriotism."
The rioters then spread through tSe
principal streets, breaking the windows" of
the stores, dragging out the huge display
rolls of linen, which they stretched across
the streets .with the object of impeding
the advance of the cavalry. They wrecked
shops, sacked the houses of persons ob
noxious to the ringleaders and attacked
the banks, from two of which they suc
ceeded in stealing a few hundred dollars
from the tills.
How important the military informa
tion concerning Venezuela would be to
the United States, if there la to be a re
sumption of trouble" between the South
American republic andyits powerful for
eign creditors, Is very apparent. It Is
realized here that should Venezuela re
pudiate her pledges to pay the claims of
European nations a more serious condi
tion would ensue than that which pre
vailed when' England and her allies were
blockading the Venezuelan ports. It is
believed that In this event a "peace"
blockade would not bo enough to satisfy
national honor.
Word has been received here that the
Spanish Minister has withdrawn from
Caracas in a huff on account of alleged
illtreatment in connection with the set
tlement of Spain's claim against Venezue
la. Information has come to this Gov
ernment, also, within the past forty
eight hours that the foreign legations in
Caracas are greatly excited over reports
that President Castro has been pocket
ing part of the 30 per cent of customs re
ceipts of the ports of La Guayra and
Puerto Cabello, which, under the proto
cols signed in Washington this year, must
be set aside monthly until such time as
the Tribunal of Arbitration, now in ses
sion at The Hague, directs how it shall
be divided among Venezuela's natural
creditors.
Reports which have been coming to the
Government for several months from of
ncial sources in Venezuela represent that
the prospect for a continuance of peace
between that nation and European powers
which have claims against it is by no
means assured.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 13: â Captain
Chauncey B. Humphrey of thÂ» Third In

GENTLEMEN : â Some two years ago I was so run down that I lacked strength, had no ap-
petite and could not sleep nights. Sometimes it seemed as though my back would break in two
after stooping. I had to get up many times during the night to urinate and go often through the day.
After having the best physicians prescribe for me without relief, I decided from my symptoms that
the medicine I needed was Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and bladder remedy.
After trying a sample bottle with good results I purchased six bottles of the regular size, and after
taking them was entirely cured. Swamp- Root is a wonderful remedy when a man is not feeling
well, after exposure or loss of sleep and irregular meals. It is also a great medicine to tone up a
man's system. Other members of the Police force are using and recommending Swamp-Root. They,
like myself, cannot say too much in praise of this great remedy.
The officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the
good you have accomplished in the compounding of Swamp-Root.

"It Is, therefore, not unnatural that a
reaction has set in," he continues, "and
that the notion prevails that ail 'differ
ences in disputes between employers and
workmen can or must' be adjusted by
arbitration."
Although seeing flaws In the plan of
arbitration as submitted by the employ
ers, Gompers approves of it on the whole,
particularly in the elimination of the
purely sympathetic strike, which Is a
weapon, he says, that has been brought
into play to such extremes for entirely in
sufficient reasons that even Its advocates
now deprecate its use.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.-I n a letter to
the building trades unions of this city
and vicinity, made public to-night Sam
uel Gompers. president of the American
Federation of Labor, and James Duncan,
secretary, have recommended that the
unions agree to the plan of arbitration of
the Employers' Association. This action,
which comes, after Gompers' investiga
tion of the labor situation in this city, is
considered a defeat for the building trades
unions which have refused to sign the
plan of arbitration. It Is recommended
that the, unions which have signed -the
agreement insist upon the disbandment of
cuch organizations as have been Instituted
recently as rivals to the previously ex
isting unions of the trade. Gompers also
recommends that the unions be lenient
with the members of the rival organiza
tions and afford them an opportunity to
join the union ranks.

LONDON, Oct. 13.â Colonial Secre
tary Lyttelton issued an election
address to his constituents at
Warwick and Leamington to-day,
In which he says he Is in entire
agreement with the fiscal changes which
Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain to
gether advocate. Llttelton holds that
the Government should be enabled to mit
igate the inequality of foreign competi
tion and to negotiate effectively for a
reduction of foreign tariffs on British
goods, by having the power to Impose
taxation on foreign manufacturers.
The Colonial Secretary is convinced
that the empire should be further knit
ted together by strengthening the com
mercial ties of its various parts by prefer
ential tariffs and to secure closer ties with
the colonies Involved a readjustment of
the taxes on food, peculiarly affecting the
poorer classes, who should therefore have
a full opportunity to minutely and delib
erately consider the matter. It should,
therefore, be distinctly understood that
there is no proposal to Impose preferen
tial tariffs for the colonies without fur
ther reference to the electorate.
Joseph Chamberlain is confined to his
bed at Highbury, his residence at Bir
mingham, by a sharp attack of his old
enemy, gout. He hopes to have suffi
ciently recovered tb'keeo his Newcastle
engagement on October 20.
Lord Rosebery spoke to-night at Shef
field, whither he went In order to definite
ly record his opposition to Chamberlain's
fiscal policy. He was greeted with th-3 ut
most enthusiasm by an immense audi
ence, which he held in rapt attention for
an hour and a half.
Lord Rosebery delivered a characteris
tic speech of brilliant rhetorical denuncia
tion of protection, interspersed with clover
and caustic allusions to Chamberlain and
the predicament in which he had placed
the Government.
Lord Rosebery delivered a characteris
fute Chamberlain's contentions by argu

of his proposals. He confined himself to
generalizations. He evoked applause by

problems, he said:
"You cannot prevent a storm by sitting

HONOLULU, Oct. 7.â John McCabe. a
school teacher at Heela, yesterday as
saulted his wife with a razor and cut off
her nose. McCabe has been a teacher in
the department for many years. He is
believed to have been temporarily insane
when he made the assault.
Insane Man Cuts Off Wife's Nose.
Some months ago his health began to
be seriously impaired, and he was re
lieved of the active work of the arch
diocese by Bishop Glenntn of Kansas
City, who was appointed as his coadjutor.
John Joseph Kain was born ,of Irish
parentage at Martinsburg, Berkeley
County, West Virginia, May 31, 1S41.
After graduating from the preparatory
seminary of St. Charles at Elllcotfs
Mills, Maryland, he completed the courses
In theology and philosophy at St. Mary's
College, Baltimore, then rated as one of
the leading institutions, of the country,
and was ordained priest July 2, 1866. His
first pastoral charge was at Harpers
Ferry, where he remained for several
years, doing duty at the same time in
other parts of the West Virginia country
bordering on the Potomac.
May 23, 1S75, he was consecrated Bishop
of the diocese of Wheeling, which covered
mainly the mountain portion of West
Virginia. From AVheellng he waa sent,
in 1S93, as coadjutor to the Most Rev.
Archbishop Kendrick of St. Louis. On
the death of that eminent prelate, in
1S96, Bishop Kain succeeded to the charge
and duties of one of the most important
archdioceses of the country.
In the death of Archbishop Kain
the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the Uni
ted States loses one of its strongest and
most brilliant members. Though not an
old man the thirty-seven years of active
conscientious devotion to the duties of
the several offices that he successively
filled told on his health, and finally
brought him to a comparatively early
end.
"Mrs. Cutts sent for a policeman im
mediately on her arrival here. She told
him that she hau locked her husband In
their hotel room in Milton, Or., and had
fled to the train under police protection
there. She declined positively to see any
one but the policeman.
A climax was reached when Cutta found
a note written bv his wife to a mala
friend detailing the abuse she suffered at
the hands of her spouse and asking ad
vice. A parting was followed by a re
conciliation and the couple left for a trip
through Eastern Oregon. The following
dispatch was rpceived to-day:
"WALLA WALLA, Wash.. Oct. 13.â A
handsomely garbed woman, as pretty as
she is well dressed, and who says she
is a niece of Colonel R. C. Judson of
Portland, will, be escorted to the train at

cago, if her plans do not miscarry. The
woman is fleelne from her husband, to
whom she says she was married in Port
land September 17. and who she says has
already whipped her twice. She gives
the name of Mrs. x>. M. Cutts, and is
accompanied by a handsome young man.
The police think the couple are eloping.
Cutts, who was a lieutenant in the Phil

BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 13.â Most Rev.
John Joseph Kain, Archbishop of St.
Louis, died to-night at St. Agnes' Sani
tarium, where he had been a patient
since May 12. Death, which came peace
fully, had been hourly expected by his
attending physicians for several days. Dr.
J. M. Stone and a number of priests and
relatives, including his sister, a sister of
charity known in the religious world as
Sister Mary Joseph, were at his bedside
when the end came.
Heart' disease was the ailment for which
the Archbishop was first treated when
he arrived at the institution, but a gen
eral breakdown from overwork caused
him much trouble. Recently appendicitis
developed and the prelate rapidly sanK.
an operation, which was deemed neces
sary, being Impracticable, owing to the
enfeebled condition of the patient.
No arrangements have been made for
the funeral. *
Accordingly, she says, she executed a
deed to her half brother, L. A. Mesmer,
January 22, 1S97. At the request of Grif
fith the property was then conveyed to
him. She alleges that after this she ex
ecuted divers mortgages and deeds to the
property to him for no consideration.
She says that he promised a full set
tlement as soon as he could realize money
from a sale. Instead of this, she claims,
he mortgaged it and proceeded to invest
It with his own money and hopelessly in
termingled his money with her money.
She avers that he now has fully disposed
of all property she deeded and that he
converted at least $200,000 of her money to
his own uses. Now he refuses to account
for It, she says.
Mrs. Griffith sets forth that last May
in their apartments at the Hotel Fre
mont, this city, Griffith armed himself
with a revolver and threateningly com
manded her to accompany him to another
room. She declares she reasonably sup
posed that he Intended great bodily harm
and possibly murder and refused to go
with him. She declares she was forced
Into a violent struggle for escape and
managed to get away through the sudden
arrival of their son Adell.
About 1900, she further avers, Griffith
violently assaulted her In their apart
ments at the Hotel Nadeau, seizing her
by the arm and throwing her forcibly
upon a chair. These acts, she complains,
caused her grievous bodily pain and men
tal suffering.
Mrs. Griffith alleges that prior to their
marriage she owned property worth
$250,000 in her own right, the es
tate of Andreas Brlswalter being
then in litigation. Five days before their
marriage, she says, Griffith told her she
would be better protected if she would
execute deeds to him; that he would ful
ly protect her Interests and hold all the
pnperty so deeded in trust for her and
rigidly account for It all after the Bris
walter estate was settled.
In his answer to his wife's recent peti
tion for divorce Colonel Griffith made the
assertion that he had always been a kind
and loving husband. Mrs. Griffith now files
an amended complaint in which she
swears that he manifested his loving con
sideration by trying to murder her three
months before the Santa Monica tragedy,
by trying to murder her with a loaded
revolver, by making a brutal assault upon
her, and by cheating her out of her prop
erty.

But. sitting as a court of law for the pur
pose cf construing and determining the mean
ing of statutes, we have nothing to do with
variances in religious belief and have no
power to determine which is correct. ffo
merely declare the law as given us by the
Legislature.
Justice Bartlett. In thÂ« prevailing opin
ion In the appellate division, held that
"medical attendance" referred to in the
statute did not mean exclusively the at
tendance of a medical practitioner In the
general sense of the term. The appellate
division reversed the conviction. In its
opinion, written by Judge Halght, the
Court of Appeals says:
We are aware that there are people who
believe that the divine power may be invoked
to heal the sick and faith Is all that is re
quired. There are others who believe that the
Creator has supplied the earth. Nature's store
house, with everything that man may want for
his support and maintenance, including the
restoration and preservation of his health, and
that he is left to work out his own salvation
under fixed natural laws. There are still
others who believe Christianity and science go
hand in hand, both proceeding from the Cre
ator: that science is but the agent of the Al
mighty, through which He accomplishes re
sults, and that both science and divine power
may be invoked together to restore diseased
and suffering humanity.

The last meeting of the association was
held at Its former headquarters in the
Stocker building and the members of the
eleven firms ' comprising the body were
present After a long discussion it was
decided to disband and when the gavel
of President George H. Payne fell at the
close of the meeting the Oakland Lumber
Dealers' Association was a thing of the
past.
The Oakland Lumber Dealers' Associa
tion, organized In this city a year and a
half ago for the purpose of regulating the
price of lumber, was dissolved this morn
}ng by mutual consent of the members.
The reason given for the dissolution of
the organization was that present dis
counts on list prices are so great that
there Is no further inducement to main
tain the association.
The fact remains, however, that while
at the time of organizing the association
all of the larcer lumber firms were In
cluded in the membership, since that time
there have been a number of new firms
organized and It Is reported that the ac
tion of these firms, which were not mem
bers of the association, in cutting prices
of lumber had much to do with the dis
solution of the association.
Whether or not the decision of the
former members of the organization to
act independently of each other in fixing
the prices of lumber will result in a rate
war is not known. E. B. Waddell of
the firm of Taylor & Co., cays that the
price of lumber is already Â»o low that
any further cut would be impracticable.
In discussing the matter Mr. Waddell
said:
Owinsr to the fact that discounts were get
ting down, the members thought it better to
disband ths association rather than wait until
there is a further weakening of the market.
As to any Internal dissension In the associa
tion, there was none other than the usual busl
nnsn differences which come up in any organi
zation of this kind, r do not think that the
dissolution of the association will cause a lum
ber rate war among' the Oakland dealers, as
prices of lumber are already too low to make
It ft Drofltable proposition for any one.
At the close of the last meeting of the asso
ciation as a body the members all appeared
to be on the best of terms with ea.cn other and
parted In the most friendly manner. But of
course no one can tell what the former mem
bers will do as Individuals.

The $30,000 for a fire department Pres
ident Rickard believes is necessary be
cause th,e present apparatus is totally in
adequate and not to be compared with
that of a town one-fourth the size of
Berkeley. This money will be used to
build two or three new lire houses on
sites already owned by the town and to
purchase perhaps two steam engines or
one steam engine and two chemical en
gines, together with all the necessary
equipment. Â¦
The $20,000 recommended for the use of
the Street Department will purchase new
sprinkling wagons and a steam roller and
aid in repairing thfi outfall of the sewers,
which is now. a menace to the health of
the people of- West Berkeley. With the
steam-roller, the town can do most of its
own- street repairing.
For the purchase of new school sites
in the north, south, west and central por
tions of town President Rickard recom
mends that $75,000 be expended. As the
population increases, he says, we will
need more schools and property' will never
be acquired as cheaply, as at -present. He
also urges that the School Board dispose
of Its property onCenter street and pur
chase elsewhere. The present site is
acknowledged to be. too valuable for
School purposes and the amount which
could be derived from Its sale would pur-
Chase two or three desirable lots of great-
POOR FIBE EQUIPMENT.
BERKELEY, Oct. 13.â If the plans
of Thomas Rickard, president of
the Board of Trustees, for the
improvement of the city as sub
mitted to the board last night
mature in the way he hopes they will,
Berkeley will take the biggest step to
ward being a model city that it has since
it began to grow. President Rickard's
plans comprehend improving nearly every
department in the city in a substantial
way and spending J25O.O0O that may be
raised by bonding the town.
In the lack of a modern building for
the housing of Its officials, President
Rickard sees behind a good
many of the smaller and less wealthy
towns of the\State. He says there Is
scarcely a town of four or five thousand
inhabitants which has not a modern city
hall, yet Berkeley ranks as the seventh
city in the State. For this improvement
he proposes that the town spend $100,000,
which will include the purchase of addi
tional land to enlarge the present site at
Center and Grove streets.
The joint committee of the Native Sons
which Is to arrange for tho launching of
the cruiser California had a meeting last
night, when it was reported that the par
lors of Alameda County have arranged
an entertainment to be given at Idora
Park, Oakland, In aid of- the launching
fund. It was also stated that at the next
meeting there would be a report on the
suggestion of holding a two weeks'
bazaar or fair in Mechanics' Pavilion,
and that from the opinions expressed it
is likely that the Native Sons, aided by
the Native Daughters, will undertake the
project. -~ :> â¢
Launching Committee.
President Rickard has not yet appointed
the time for the meeting of the committee
of the whole of the . Trustees, when tho
bond proposition will be discussed. .. ;":
President Rickard's proposal that the School
Board sell the present school site on Center
street Is a. good one. That properly is now
easily worth $00,000, and if it could be sold
we could buy three or four good school sites
In other parts of town and perhaps put up a
good building. It must be reckoned, too,
that the property In private hands would
brine In about $700 In taxes annually ta the
town and with improvements more taxes. All
these things must be considered in committee,
however ,and none of us know how we will
vote until we have thoroughly discussed the
whole matter. . . , ;.
I rather favor $50,000 for a wharf at West
Berkeley, instead of the Town Hall. Tho
wharf is something that Is really needed and
it will bring money to the town. As the busi
ness pt the town Increases the wharf will
be -used more and more.
Trustee Redmond C. Staats favors most
of President Rickard's recommendations,
dissents from one of them and adds one
of his own, which he thinks will Improve
the complexion of the whole proposition
somewhat. He said:
I am not so much in favor of a new Town
Hall as I am of the other Improvements. I
am not saying, however, that we don't need
a Town Hall. The one we've got Is not ex
actly cood enough for the town, but It will
do for awhile.
STAATS GIVES VIEWS.
While to the casual observer the condition
of the town Is In every way satisfactory thare
Is a deplorable lack of finances with which
to carry on needed improvements. The spirit
of improvement seems to be In the air and
our neighboring: cities are taking advantage
of it. Shall we do likewise, or allow con
ditions to remain as they are? I believe that
the necessity for the Improvements I have
mentioned will appeal to every one. I believe
that the town could bond itself for this amount
and not feel It. We could Issue forty-year
bonds bearing interest at 4 per cent and would
hardly notice the difference in our taxes. The
amounts I have mentioned are only sugges
tions and subject to alteration, but I hope
that as a whole they will meet with approval.
I would also recommend that the Board of
Trustees call another election to amend the
charter before the next Legislature to provide
for a $1 tax levy.' The 75-cent levy is en
tirely inadequate for us to conduct this city
properly, even with the most careful economy,
and it ought to be raided. The town has long
since passed the provincial stage and It Is
time we were getting abreast of the times.

The $25,000 for parks in West and South

had married after being: granted an ab

Er-Judge Frick voiced the opinion that
the law was explicit and that a serious

did not expect that a prosecution would
result or if one did that any Jury would
convict, and that the system would show
to advantage in such a cisa.

general approval.. â¢
John T. Bell, chairman of the commit
tee, presented the scheme of the body.
Letters have been sent to atjput a dozen
of the most prominent tree culturl3t3,
asking each to designate two species of
trees which, in his opinion, are specially
adapted for long avenaes running north
and south. Information was solicited a3
"to the character of the roots Â«and foliage
of the trees and their rapidity or slowness
of growth.
When the replies are received it is the
Intention of the committee to hold a spe
cial meeting. Every property owner on
Telegraph avenue, the street first to be
beautified, will be asked to be preseat and
express his opinion as to which partic
ular tree would most serve the ends of
the city.
No trees of rapid growth are wanted,
as those planted will be intended for or
namentation rather than for shade. The
tree planters will interfere as little as
possible with the trees already on the
avenue, . but will try to get a uniform
growth.

Mrs. Miller, wife of F. H. Miller,
superintendent and manager of large

first wrote on August 10 as follows:
"My "husband commenced taking
3'our Renal Compound June 6. His
case was diagnosed 'as Bright's Dis-
ease by specialists. He learned of the
Compound through a gentleman liv-
ing near here who was cured by it,'
and sent to the States for it. There
is some improvement, but he does
not regain his strength. Is it this
cold, dry climate that is retarding re-
covery?"
Xhe following letter, dated two
months later, will now be understood:

Gentlemen: The last month the
improvement has been very marked.
We certainly give the Compound
credit for our hopeless case, pro-
nounced so by the physicians, and
are only too happy to recommend it
when occasion offers. Mr. Miller has
now taken two dozen, and is appar-
ently as well as ever. Please express
a half dozen more via Beaudette

A Preparation Discovered That Will
Destroy the Dandruff Germ.
For some time It has been known that
dandruff Is caused by a germ that digs
up Â«the scalp Into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root, causes "falling hair, and, of course,
finally baldness. For ysars there have
been all kinds of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no ipermanent cure for dandruff,
until the discovery of a preparation
called Newbro's Herpicide. which destroys
the dandruff germ. Destroy - the cause,
the effect will cease to exist. Kill the
dandruff germ and you'll have no dan-
druff, no itching scalp, no falling: hair.

Co-education in Kansas has reached a development
which must make glad the heart of the most insistent

rival class women of a Kansas college the young

otherwise conducted themselves as fit candidates for
a house of refuge. Technically their performance
was known as a lively exhibition of class feeling.
OLD-TIME STEAMER - A. S.. City.
The only steamer that arrived in San
Francisco September 12, 1S5$, was the
Senator. Captain Sealy; three days from
San Diego.
Several police officers, as yet unnamed in the accu
sation, are charged with the offense of working as
bakers while enjoying the salary of the municipality
given to guardians of the peace. There is some like
lihood, therefore, that several unnamed specimens
of the "finest" may discover that" their cake is dough
in both dishes.
THERE is a new era for the mines of the Mother
Lode in this State, so says the Mother Lode
Banner, and proceeds to give particulars. The
Banner, which is published at Sonora, in the heart of
the mining county of Tuolumne, says: "The use of
crude oil as a steam-maker is increasing rapidly in
this county. By its use the mine operators see a j
way of escape from the vexatious annual shutdown
that has been necessary when water is alone depended
upon." â¢
To be independent of water in the operation of
mines has been the dream of operators for years. The
remedy for months of inaction did not at first ap
pear, nor has it even yet been clearly developed in
any section. The anxious eyes of the dwellers on
the Mother Lode and in all places where there are
l.ines in California has from the earliest days been
directed to the lofty peaks of the high Sierras and to
their rugged and ample flanks for the purpose of dis
cerning each year the amount and condition of the
snowfall, the storehouse of power for the summer
months. Now, so reasons the Banner, that will
eventually be a thing of the past.
"The installation of oil-burning plants," it says,
"has made several companies independent enough to
run through the water famine, patronizing the water
company when it has water to sell, but the-invcn
tion of direct acting crude oil consuming engines is
making power so cheap that there is little use of
buying water at any season."
For instances of this independence the Banner cites
the Santa Ysabcl mine and the Standard Lumber
Company factory. The Jamestown electric light
plant, :t also says, will buy no more water or elec
tricity, but will generate its own electric energy by
the use of an engine running at a cost far below what
was formerly paid for water.
The cost of producing power on the Mother Lode
has been estimated by the Banner, which says: "It
has been recently demonstrated in this county that

MORMON LEADER WHO HAS
BEEN ELECTED A UNION PA
CIFIC DIRECTOR.
RECENT incidents in Chicago may make it !
necessary for the State Board of Trade to
enlarge its inquiry into the marketing of Cali- 1
iornia fruit. Mr. Watson, president of the bank- ;
rupt Porter Brothers Company, when summoned '
before the referee in bankruptcy and interro
gated upon the subject of rebates secured by his
company, refused to answer on the ground that to do
bo would incriminate him. The issue on rebates was
raised by the New York manager of the concern, who
intervene* in the bankruptcy proceedings with a
claim of several hundred thousand dollars due as his
ihare of the profits, z.ri<l consisting of rebates, as he ;
claims.
The examination into the affairs of this company ';
shows that it was doing an enormously profitable j
business. Leaving out rebates entirely, it is evident
that the company, by Peter Funk auctions of fruit
Ziyi by other methods of shearing the producers, sc
ciired enormous gains, and was so enriched that it
put its surplus into speculative enterprises, like the
northern fisheries, and finally overreached itself and j
became insolvent. It took advantage of the necessi
ties of the producers which it had caused, and by
adopting the method of small advances to growers
upon an anticipated crop, had practically covered the
State with a system of crop mortgages which gave i*
a conclusive monopoly of the crop of the State. Hav- j
ing the growers in its control by these advances, and j
being possessed of the means ,to make a fictitious
auction price, it held the industry in an iron grip.
It is a marvelous testimony to the fruitfulness of our
orchards and to the economy of the producers that ;
they were still ablerto exist and thrive after a fashion j
though the victims of craft and exactions that would
Jonjj ago have destroyed an ordinary industry.
The question of rebates raises an issue that may I
prove very serious to the officers of the defunct com
pany. The interstate commerce law makes rebating
Â«sn offense, with civil and criminal penalties. It is
intimated that the rebates were given by the refrig
erating companies and the subsidiary corporations
which owned the fruit car service. But this does not
in any way mitigate or condone the offense, for it is
equally obnoxious to the law if given by these col
lateral corporations as if given by the railroad com
panies themselves.
Thr fruit-growers will see at once that any system
of rebates given to Porter Brothers Company only
increased its pewer to monopolize 'the traffic by
shutting out co-operative concerns and rival com
panies which did not enjoy the rebate privilege. The
rebate means that the refrigerating or car compa
nies could afford to carry the product to market at
!eÂ«-Â« than the open rate. This being so, the producers
uere entitled to the less rate. But they had none of
its benefits. They have been charged the open rate
i.nd it was taken out of every shipment made by them
in the returns made by Porter Brothers Company.
Even this advantage, unfair and unlawful as it was.
<-l<d not satisfy the greed of the commission men. It
is known to be the fact that they also practiced
rharging the growers with broken carload rates on
their small lots. The small growers would deliver
lotÂ«. less than a carload. These lots were ag
gregated to make a full car, but each grower was
rharced by the commission men the broken car
rate, which is about twice the full car rate. This
overcharge did not go to the railroad company, but
uent into the pockets of the commission men.
It is a sickening story of unfair exaction and of
a polic}' of .spoliation of the fruit-growers of Cali
fornia. The State Board of Trade has set for itself
the task of finding all the facts and putting the dis
closure in the hands of the growers, that they may
protect themselves. It is a good work and great,
.-jnd should have the sympathy and support of the
press of the State, and should be facilitated and ap
preciated by every fruit planter in California. Its re
sults may well add millions to the profits of the
planters, whose enterprise has developed this to be
the most permanent and the most characteristic of all
the industries of the State.

SALT LAKE. Utah. Oct. 13.-The
annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Union Pacific Railroad Com
pany was held in this city to-day,
The discussion concerning the causes of the de
cline in the supply of male teachers has brought
forth a multitude cf theories. It is one of the issues
that reveals how true is the old saying about "many
men o : many minds." The Philadelphia problem,
however, is susceptible of but one solution. A steady
decrease in the number of young people fitting them
selves for the profession of teaching in an American
city can be accounted for only upon the ground that
they are not paid a sum sufficient to enable them to
maintain the standard of living required of teachers
in that city. In other words, the whole problem, so
seemingly complex, could be solved by simply in
creasing salaries.
The Record says that many of the best teacheis of
the city in times past have left it to go to New York,
because of the higher salaries paid in the metropolis,
and adds: "We cannot expect to retain our best
teachers when cities so near as New York and Bos
ton offer, respectively. 100 per cent and 50 per cent
more salary than they can obtain in Philadelphia.
Neither can we expect young women- to go through
an arduous six years' course of preparation for a
profession so trying unless the reward be more com
mensurate with the effort. The laborer, even if he or
she be a public school teacher, is worthy of his (or
her) hire; and the hire of a teacher is- not a price to
be arbitrarily fixed, but is the average remuneration
given for like, services and under like circumstances
in the departments of education throughout . the
country. Economic laws cannot be defied in this any
more than in any other branch of human activity."
Since it is*so clear that the decline in the supply of
competent teachers in Philadelphia, and the falling
off of the number of students at the normal schools in
that city, arc due to a lack of adequate incomes ob
tainable in the profession, it is reasonable to suppose
the decline in the number, of men in the profession
throughout the country is due to a similar cause.
No class of public servants render more important
service to the community than do the teachers of
the public schools, and none is more deserving of
proper payment. The issue that now confronts Phila
delphia may eventually cpnfront the people of other
sections of the Union, and it is just as well to take
note of the problem and mark the right solution of it.
FOR many a j-ear past there have been complaints
of a lack of men in the teaching force of the
public schools. Such complaints have been in
creasing in frequency and in force of late, and at the
recent banquet of the California Schoolmasters' Club
in this city the steady decrease in the percentage of
men in the profession iivas made the theme of the
after dinner symposium. A new phase of the problem
presents itself in Philadelphia. From that city come
reports of a diminishing supply of teachers of both
sexes, and it seems that in that community it is not a
question merely of keeping up the supply of men in
the profession, but of keeping up the profession it
self.
In reviewing the situation the Philadelphia* Record
says there has been an alarming diminution in the
supply of good teachers in the local public schools,
and, what is. perhaps e\;en more notable, there has
been a remarkable falling off in the number of young
men and women who enter the local institutions with
a view to receiving instruction and training as teach
ers. It goes on to say: "Statistical information on
thi; subject has heretofore been published in the
Record, to which anybody may refer for confirmation
of the statements here made. The situation, in brief,
is this: In the next two years the Normal School
will graduate less than joo teachers; it is a matter of
official record that 250 or more teachers are required
every year to fill vacancies created by resignation or
promotion. Within two years, therefore, the supply
will be 200 short of the demand."

on the hopes of the world
ONE cannot be indifferent to the spectacle of
Japan, a nation of 45,000,000 of people, de
fying Russia, with 110.000,000. War may be
averted, but in view of the glacier-like movement of
Russia it is safe to say that she will yield nothing of
consequence for the sake of peace. Surely the stake
for which Russia plays must be of supreme impor
tance, to justify the cheating of which she has been
guilty in the course of the game. .Her diplomacy
has been entirely discredited and disgraced, if judged
from the standpoint of honor and good faith. But if
judged by its success so far attained it is the great
est diplomacy in history.
If to get a position of advantage by false pre
tense and hold it by falsehood be great diplomacy,
the Russian sort is great. If she come in conflict
with Japan the stake played for will be the complete
master of Eastern Asia. If Russia win she wins more
than that, in prospect, for wipning may easily make
her the master of the world. Her victory will make
her, by alliance and force, the dictator of China. In
the Russians and the Tartars and Mongols runs com
mon blood. In facing eastward again the Russian is
only countermarching over ground that he trod as
far back as the time of Alexander the Great. If put
in control of China, which seems to' be the end
sought by Russia, it will be not control merely, but
leadership, based upon a common orientalism, but in
fused with the spirit of the modern world. She will
lead China to an awakening that will be Russian,
and the 420,000,000 of Chinese will be added to the
population and the fighting force of Russia in a stu
pendous combination that can -dictate terms to every
capital of Europe.
Given one empire, one Czar, one moving spirit
from the Baltic to the China Sea, and how insig
nificant is the part of the world left to the rest of
Europe! Persia, India and Burmah form but a nar
row strip, a mere littoral, so certain of being over
run by the vast physical force of the new Russia
that surrender of it without a struggle would seem
like consulting prudence and humanity. Never in
the history of man has such an empire been planned
before. In its political geography it will be sym
metrical, continental, and will have in comparison
with its vast area a brief and very defensible coast
line. In its commercial geography it will include
every production necessary to human existence, to
comfort and to luxury. In its industrial possibilities
it will hold the power to crush the combined com
merce of the rest of Europe, Africa and our own
hemisphere.
The vision of it all is so colossal ss to be appall
ing. Even if won at the cost of a war with Japan, it
will be the cheapest conquest and colonization and
extension and expansion of national power ever ac
complished. It will be the fruit of persistence and
deceit on the part of Russia, of jealousy and division
in the rest of Europe, and of recognition by China
of kindred blood and common destiny. The prospect
is more startling because Russia has been left out
of the calculation in all schemes for expansion and
empire exploited by the other nations. England has
made costly conquests in Hindostan and Burmah and
in Africa. The United States has stretched over some
inlands. But Russia has pushed her frontier per-
sistently and patiently across a hemisphere, never
leaving her continental footing, with no ambition to
go beyond seas, with no hunger for islands.
This continental policy was no doubt in action
when she gave up Alaska. We regard that Territory
as a prize and boast of its wealth and resources. But
what is it compared with all Eastern Asia? If Russia
owned it now all its potentiality of wealth would be
exhausted in defending it, if she have war first be
fore she reaches what her ambition craves. If she
reach it, it is the end of British empire and the
abridgment of the commercial empire of the United
States. Her position will be so strong that she can.
and may have to. defy the world in arms.
Thi? issue, of such interest to mankind, finds only
little Japan playing David to the Northern Goliah.
Nowhere around the horizon is there a sign of sup
port to the insular empire. The contest seems so un
equal as to excite the world's pity. Otherwise there
is no sign of emotion. Russia's volume of-decep
tions, her often broken faith, her multiplied duplici
ties, have not even excited the indignation of the
Governments she has deceived. It surely seems as
if Fate had come armed from the North to foreclose
Gory accounts of another disaster, with one man
dead and twenty men and women dangerously
wounded, have held the public eye for the last few
days. It was not ar clash between the' Turks and the
Macedonians, nor a fresh uprising in* the Philippines,
nor yet a Russian massacre of the Jews. It was sim
ply another head-on collision on the Southern Pacific
Railroad.

LOVE'S VICTORY
AT THE POLLS
OFFICIAL Kansas is all amazement over a new element that
has just obtruded itself into American politics and â won out.
Official Kansas is investigating, but meantime the women of
an entire State are seeing to it that their triumph of the last few
weeks is maintained and the cause of true love holds full swav.
They fought in a way peculiarly feminine for their richt to receive
their lovers and to be wooed and won and married when, where and how
they pleased. The men fought against it, but the women won. and in
pursuance of that victory they dragged the defeated candidates out oi
office by main force. Hence official Kansas* perturbation. Hence.
too, official Kansas' effort to keep the facts quiet until it gets full
and final report of this astounding condition of affairs. Meantime Hv-
men rules an entire State in a manner never before witnessed in all the
history of the world. The Sunday Call will put you in possession of all
the facts next Sunday, official Kansas' perturbation notwithstand-

And did you ever read of Delaroo? He ixas an Indian. He was
more. He was the shadow incarnate of Maje Sampson. He was even
more than that. He was the best railroad character that ever cauzht
the facile pen of Frank H. Spearman, who is himself the best writer of
American railroad stories in the world to-day. This is Delaroo as
Spearman knew him:
"As Jong as Maie would talk Delaroo would "listen. That single
word was, in fact, the kev to Delaroo: Delaroo wa3 a listener: for that
reason nobody knew much about him."
And this in brief is one of the most tense moments in all Spear-
man's exciting narrative' of Delaroo's career:
"What do I think of it?" muttered i Neighbor, when the local ooerator
asked him for a report for Callahan. '*I think there's two engines for
the scrap in sisht â and the 264. if we can ever find anythinc of her â and
about a million sheep to pay for â *' Neighbor paused to cive an order
and survey the frightful scene.
"And Delaroo." repeated the operator. "He wants to know about
Delarooâ"
"Missing." ,
If you have been recline Spearman's new series of two-pace storie3
you will not need even these extracts to keep you on a sharp lookout for
Delaroo in the next Sunday CalL Spearman's stories are the sort that
you never forget. They get a grip on your memory like the mysterious
fascination of railroadine itself. '^-V/
However. Delaroo is only one of the big things in the next Sunday
Call, as, for instance. "The Golden Fetich." It is a new mystery story

self.Justice of the Peace Daniels decided
yesterday that the Statute of Limitation
was an effectual bar to the recovery by
Mary Barker of $299 loaned to Thomas
Tighe and his wife some twenty years
ago. The plaintiff testified that she had
loaned the money to the defendants on
condition that It was to be returned to
her on the death of Tighe's mother.'
Tighe and his wife both testified that In
consideration for caring for Mrs. Barker
for six months every year during thÂ«
past fifteen years they regarded the ac
count as settled.
Statute of Limitations Governs.
Mrs. von Ofen avers also that her hus
band had more than one lady friend. She
charges that frequently while she was
cleaning his clothes, she would find in the
pockets bracelets and handkerchiefs that
were the property of other women.
Miriam E. Bernard wants a divorce
from Kenneth L. Bernard for cruelty. She
alleges that he once demanded money of
her, and exhibited a loaded revolver, say
ing as he did so: "If I do not get more
money I will do something and then com
mit suicide." Mrs. Bernard's maiden
name is Eskridge.
Suits for divorce were also filed by Wil
liam Walsh against Carrie F. Walsh for
desertion, Matilda C. Rylander against
John W. Rylander for neglect, Bert W.
Clifford against Lillian Clifford for deser
tion, Frederick Junior against Iledwig
Junior for cruelty, Anna C. King against
Myrick F. King for desertion, Lena Ehr
hardt against Albert A. Ehrhardt for ne
glect. P. \j. Vaughn against Ellen Vaughn
for cruelty and Laure Cumberland against
Joseph Cumberland for cruelty.
Divorces were granted to Constantine
Maschio from Clara A. Maschio for deser-
Josephine, von Ofen is willing enough to
have the ties uniting her to George von
Ofen severed, but she is decidedly op
posed to having the.m severed on his com
plaint. Accordingly she filed a cross-com
plaint to his suit for divorce yesterday
in which she charges that he has been
guilty of numerous cruel acts, and asks
that she be granted the decree of divorce.
She denies emphatically that she ever
drove him from their home as he charges,
but admits telling him she would refuse
to live with him unless he quit drinking.
She says she has been driven nearly to
distraction by his conduct. She claims
that he once brought a etrange woman
to^Jheir home and spent the entire after
noon with her. "They drank lots of
wine," says Mrs. von Ofen, and my hus
band abused me because I refused to join
them." After the stranger had left, con
tinues the cross-complaint, Von Ofen dec
orated the house with the strange wo
man's pictures and called his wife's at
tention to the beauty of her features.
"Isn't she a beauty," Mrs. von Ofen
claims he would say to her, "what a face
you have In comparison to that."
Josephine von Ofen Says
She Is Entitled to
a Divorce.
OPPOSES THE SUIT
OF HER HUSBAND
The expected storm among the regents
of the University of California, over the
report of the special committee on medi
cal status was delayed at yesterday's
meeting by the fact that a majority of
the commltteemen had not had a chance
to act uoon the measure submitted to
them and the matter was put over to
the next regular meeting of the regents.
The committee is expected to recommend
whether or not ToJand College is to con
tinue its existence as a department of
the university, and the receipt pf tts re
port by the regents is calculated before
hand to cause serious disagreement.
The regents acted upon the recommen
dations of President Wheeler as follows:
The title of Dr. Irving Hardestv was
changed from instructor in anatomy to
assistant professor of anatomy without
change of salary. Miss Jessica Pelxotto.
who took the degree of doctor of philos
ophy from the University of California
in 1500, was appointed lecturer in eco
nomics at $500 a year. Arthur S. Wheeler,
B. S., 1003. of thn University of Califor
nia was appointed assistant In electrical
engineering at a salary of $750 per an-
tion. Wilhelmina R. R. Doxey from John
Aubrey Doxey for neglect and Anna
Howe from Albert Howe for desertion.
Appointments to Minor Positions Are
Made on Recommendation of
the President.

eral superintendent of police. Chicago,
that j-Â».obÂ«rt Bader had written friends

The disclosures concerning: the manner
in which business was done by the firm
of Epplnger & Co. furnished the reason
for this adverse action against the three
partners. Indictments have been found
by the Grand Jury. During the proceed
ings members of the exchange appeared
ae witnesses at various times. Since then
much testimony has also been made pub
lic during the proceedings In bankruptcy
before Milton Green.
Th* three partners Jn the former firm
o' Epplnger & Co., namely Jacob Ep
pingcr. Herman Eppinger and Bernhard
Ettlinger, have been expelled from mem
bership In the Merchants' Exchange.
Notice of their expulsion was posted yes
terday and was read by many merchants.
The wording of the official announcement
does not assign any reason for this act
on the part of the exchange. The sim
p!Â« statement Is made that the three
members of the defunct firm are deprived
of all rights and privileges of member
ship and that they have been expelled
at a meeting of the. exchange. The seats

The gravest fear of the dried fruit men
is that if they fail to bet their product
on the way this month, as contracted,
the price will be affected and th*y will
lose a. lot of money.
Producers have made numerous com
plaints to the railroad company and con
ferences in the yellow building have been
almost daily affairs, but always with the
same result. It has been explained to
the company's patrons that the company
is 6hort a large number of engines and
sees no way of getting them. Discussing
the matter yesterday, one of the South
ern Pacific Company's officials paid:
w e managed to handle all the California
grftn fruit this ytar in a very satisfactory
manner, a fact which all shippers will testlfy
to. but there came a eudden and unexpected
surplus of freight, which upset all our calcu
l8t;rnf>. A large number of engines haÂ» been
used this year on the Salt LÂ«ke cut off and
this fact seriously handicapped the operating
department. We fully appreciate the predica
tneat of the dried fruit men and are endeav
oring to meet their requirements in some man
ner. General Manager Kruttschnitt dur
ing h'.s present visit In the East has tried
through various sources to secure a number
of extra engines, but his effort* have met
with no success for the reason that the roads
thÂ«re are also badly handicapped.
The officials of the road candidly ad
mit that their traffic business is in a very
bad way and attribute It directly to un
expected business and the lack of suffi
cient power to move the trains.
The box mil'-a and the dried fruit men
are experiencing the greatest hardship as
a result of the congestion. September
and October are the busy months of the
latter, who have contracted for the de
livery of large orders during this month,
but the condition of affairs causes a great
deal of fear that the producers will be
unable to fulfill their agreements. The
box men have been unable to ship their
material from the mills in Oregon and
Northern California. In the few excep
tions where the boxes have reached their
destination in the valley points they have
been filled with dried fruit and reloaded
on to the cars In which they were ship
ped from the north, but the cars are still
6tandlng on the sidings awaiting the ar
rival of an engine to carry them away.
PEODXTCEBS COMPLAIN.
OCCASIONS HABDSHIP.
The freight and operating departments
of the Southern Pacific Company are se
riously pondering over one of the most
aggravating perplexities that they have
been confronted with for many years.
At the present moment there are nearly
4000 carloads of freight destined for East
ern markets lying along the lines of the
company in this State, and. try as they
may, the officials of the operating depart
ment have fo far failed to devise a means
of movinc them. During the last ten
days only a few cars of freight have
passed Mojave. east bound, and unless
the company finds some Immediate meth
od of relieving the congestion the situa
tion will develop into a 6erious one and
possibly result in a great loss to Cali
fornia shippers.

JoÂ« "Walcott Is Given the Decision.
BOSTON, Oct. 13.â Joe "Walcott. In a fif
teen-round fight to-night with Kid Car
ter at the New Criterion Club, was given
the decision, although the spectators
hooted the referee and demanded a draw.
Carter was knocked down twice in the
first round, but later he put up a stiff
fight.
There is likelihood of an extensive in
dustry in fresh peaches being started be
tween Great Britain and Argentina.
Nothing caused so much comment as
the defeat in the five and a half furlong
sprint, the second to be decided, the
gray flyer E. M. Brattaln. a 1 to 4 favor
ite. Chandler, who had the mount, made
all the running, but lost considerable
ground in the last quarter and under
Hild-ebrand's clever handling M. F. Tar
pey, a 10 to 1 shot, got up on the rail,
scoring by less than a length in 1:07.
Trouble began for the ring when Little
Margaret, a heavily supported choice, got
home flrst In the opening run at six fur
longs. The fllly got away flrst and was
never headed, winning, ridden out, from
Phyz and Americano.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 12.â The syndl
catora encountered some extremely squal
ly weather at Agricultural Park this
afternoon. Not that their books were not
strong enough to make Sandow brighten
up his medals and look to his laurels,
but favorites turned in with alarming
frequency, four out of five in tha run
ning events being- returned first.
The weather was exceedingly warm, and
while no plungers broke into the gamÂ« all
of the sharpshooters were present and
most of the layers lost. Apparently the
harness horse has fallen Into disfavor,
for the Van Nuys stake for 2:25 class
pacers failed to incite much interest.
Ira, driven by v "Walter Maben, sold about
an even-money chance against the field
and was able to take but one lw?at, the
second. Tidal Wave, after hia driver,
Mosher, had been cautioned, annexed the
first, third and fourth heats. Wood D
and Otto Z were distanced early in the
battle.
PpecUl Dispatch to Tht Call.
A battle between Seiger and Hanlon
would undoubtedly prove a drawing card.
Seiger Is just such a fighter as Hanlon.
He likes the "gaff," and many would go
to the pavilion to see who would back
away first.
Greggains says the San Francisco
Athletic Club will bring off a battle this
month.
Manager Greg-gains Immediately went
to work to secure another man for Sei
ger. He asked Eddie Hanlon whether he
would fight Seiger the latter part of tho
month if the "iron man" made 130 pounds,
and Hanlon replied that *he would dn
so. Roach believes that SeJger can mako
the weight if he trains In a warmer place.
Yesterday was the fir^t hot day, and he
was able to take off two and a half
pounds. Roach will take Seiger to Sau
sallto to-morrow, and if he finds that
Seiger can make the weight and remain
strong, he will bind tho match with Han
lon. In the meantime It Is thought that
Britt will recover the use of his ankle
and be able to eni*r the ring in two
weeks.
As soon as Manager Greggains heard
the news he sent Dr. Lustig. the club a
physician, to Britt's home and the doctor
made a careful examination. He sub
sequently reported that Britt was suffer
ing from a bad sprain. Greggatns hied
himself to Sheehan's and told Seiger not
to let up in his training, as he had Rute
Turner to fight him. Later Greggains
learned that Turner was on his way to
Seattle to meet McClelland.
Seiger's manager. Billy Roach, is great
ly disappointed. He stated yesterday that
his man was in perfect shape and was
within a pound of the stipulated weight.
'If the contest is postponed." Roach said.
"I hope we will be given something for
our training expenses. We ,- each had a
large sum up to bind our appearance and
It can be deducted from the amount."
Jimmy Britt has sprained his ankla and
the light which was scheduled for next
Friday night is off. This is a sad blow
to the San Francisco Athletic Club. Man
ager Greggalns was working energetic
ally to bring oft the battle. An effort will
bo made to postpone? the contest until tfta
latter part of the month. It is thought
Britt's ankle will be well by that time.
Britt Injured himself while boxing at
Croll's Gardens, Alameda. A loose board
on the boxing platform did the trick.
Jimmy was taken In hand by his rubbers,
but they could not alleviate the pain. Dr.
Jones was called and he pronounced it a
bad sprain. Britt'a ankle was placed in a
plaster cast and he was removed to his
home. He is now confined to his room
and will not be able to leave his house fur
a we>ek.

McClatchy, Bray and Magee, Santa*
Clara's backfield trio, proved to be the
best players on the visiting team. Mc-
Clatchy made some brilliant runs around
The first touchdown was made in the
first half after five minutes' play. Bren
nan, Stephenson and Dole all proved good
at carrying the ball down this field. Bren
nan gained by far the largest number of
yards and Stephenson carried the ball
over for the touchdown. Dole kicked the
goal and the score was 6 to 0. The sec
ond touchdown was made near the close
of the second half and very shortly after
Weller entered the game. The touchdown
was made by Dole, although Weller made
most of the distance up the field, and
Stephenson kicked the goal, raising the
score to 12 to 0.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 13.â
Tbe freshman eleven broke their string
of defeats this afternoon by a clean vic
tory over the Santa Clara College team,
the score being 12 to 0. The game was
hard fought, but not fast enough to sat
isfy the coaches except during a few in
tervals. The bleachers, however, were
more than pleased with the showing made
by the youngsters and expressions of con
fidence in the "07 team were heard for the
first time to-night.
The scoring was made through straight,
hard playing, in which the whole fresh
man team showed up to a better advant
age than at any time previously. There
Â¦were two serious faults very evident,
however. The playing was not fast
enough and the fumbling was far too fre
quent. Coach Lanagan remarked be
tween halves: "This is the worst game
for fumbling we have ever had." The
slips made by the freshmen were fre
quently costly. If they had been able to
keep the ball as they should at this late
date in their season the score might have
been considerably larger.
The Stanford backs put up at times
during the game as brilliant ball as has
been seen on the tic-Id this season. Big
"Jim" Weller was the particular star.
Going into the game in the second half he
waded through the Santa Clara players
almost as he pleased. He has improved
In form at line bucking and is going lower
than he did in the last game. Halfback
Brennan and Quarterback Stott also did
good work for the freshmen, Stott getting
into the interference and helping the man
with the ball In fine style. . West and
Morrow put up a clever game at ends.

was 5 to 0 the game was very close and
In doubt until finished, the ball being in
the territory of the victors' goal most
of the time.

BRIGHTON BKACII. Oct. 13.â After
having fairly earned the heartiest tributes
of applause for his really splendid riding
of Hermis In the Brighton preliminary
Jockey Fuller rode races on two heavily
backed favorites, both of which were
beaten, and In both cases good judges
roundly condemned his work.
There were only three starters for the
Brighton preliminary. Hermis was, of
course, the favorite at odds on. The
great question with his supporters was as
to whether he could stay a mile. and a
half. That question was answered in the
affirmative, but all the same It was due
to Fuller's superb hand riding. The horse
was rated In front to perfection, and,
whenever Major Daingerneld got to with
in a length of Hermis, Fuller relaxed a
trifle of his steady pull and the horse
would again open up a little daylight.
There might have been a good excuse
for Atwood's defeat In the fifth race,
because there was a large Held aqd Ful
ler might have found it difficult to get
through. And, moreover, the colt may
have been a false favorite. The winner,
Yo San, was backed to win a lot of
money. He Jumped into the lead clear
of his field and was never In danger
of losing; yet men In a good position to
see declare that Â» Fuller's work lacked
energy. Summary:

but he saw his rival. Dineen, carrv off
the honors by holding the Nationals down
to four scattered hits, which, backed up
by perfect fielding, prevented a single
Plttsburg ir.an getting farther than third
base. Dineen struck out seven men and
his support by Crlger contributed mate
rially to the success of the game. The
latter'e bluff to throw to second In the
fourth inning, followed by a quick Bnap
of the ball to Collins, catching Leach off
the bag. was the best piece of work in
the game.
Other features were mainly contributed
by the visitors and Boston's score would
undoubtedly have been larger but for the
great running catches of Beaumont and
Clark. Wagner's work at short and Leach
at third.
The Angels landed again In the fourth.
Raymond tore , off a drive to cen
ter that was jrood for three bases
and Dolly Gray brought him in
with a double-sacker to â¢ center.
This gave the Angels a lead again, one
that they held till the seventh, when the
Cripples became strong once more.
Messerly dropped one safely in back of
Smith, and Peter drove the leather to
right. Then they executed a double steal
and scored when Martinke pushed a hot
one through the infleld. This held them
till the Angels created the deadlock in
the tenth. It looked early enough for a
few more rounds, but the umpire said
"nay, too dark," so the talent had to
obey.
Umpire Jim McDonald forgot that there
was a game on the cards at Oakland and
of course did not think about showing
up. For a long time it looked bad, but
finally both sides agreed upon Billy Dun
leavy of the Milwaukee nine, a former
Oakland star. "Dun" got into a red coat
and gave his decisions promptly and so
well that no one kicked during the prog
ress of the game. The score:

The Angels opened up the first inning
with a rua. Hoy was passed and quick
ly stole second. Smith banged out a safe
one and Hoy went to third. Smith pil
fered the middle bag and Peter, In an at
umpt to catch the big fellow posing,
threw the bail away and Hoy tallied. But
the cripples tied this up in the third,
when Kruger hit for two bags and Mes
serly followed his example.
ANGELS SCOEE IN FOTTETH.
The Angels also had a new one to show
the public. He Is "Teeley" Raymond,
whom. Mr. Harris did not take north
v.-ith the team. As fate willed It, Toman's
father died suddenly in the East and the
Angel shortstop had to go home immed
iately. But Morley in the meautlme dug
up Raymond and he will play short till
Toman is able to Join the team once
more.
Peter Lohman's handfull of crippUs. re
sembling more than ever a bunch of hos
pital Inmates, arrived on their native soil
yesterday, 'after an absence of many
weeks In the wilds of the north. They
looked as though they were ready to quit
in a minute, yet they ran the Angels to
the last quarter and pulled up with a
tie at the end of the tenth round.
Score: Oakland 3. Los Angeles 3.
A tedious flrst inning: made it look like
a gerae that would take about ten hours
to play, but the talent soon recovered
f/om\jts slumbers and tho rest of the
struggle was well executed and exciting
In nearly every innlngr.
Martlnke, the wanderer Peter dis
covered in the south, made his flrst ap
pearance on the Oakland lot. It was his
business to cover third and he did fairly
well. He can field a ball nicely, but when
he whips one to the initial bag It is very
likely to take a ride into the bleachers,
eo strong Is the wing of the new recruit.
But the fans forgot all about his bad be
havior in the field when he rapped out
a bir-g'.e in the seventh that put the crlp
pks one to the good.

THE PRELIMINARY
Billy Duffy punched Pete Root so hard
that the nast named /fell from sheer ex-
"Rough House Billy" McDonald and his
fierce lunges were Just a few too many
for "Bill" Stewart, the deep sea boxer,
last night. After four rounds of ordinary
going, punctuated at intervals with a few
torrid mixups, the scrapper with the sand
lot name was declared the victor by Ref
eree Jimmy McDevltt, as the judges dif
fered as to tho way the bout shoultl be
decided. : >".\
The two welters were on for the main
event of the Hayes Valley Club's monthly
powwow. The rest of the programme
was not as good as It looked on paper.
Most of the bouts ended In knockouts in
the initial round, yet life and action that
are characteristic of the real game were
woefully lacking.
McDonald started In to rush Stewart in
the first round and the nast named
seemed powerless to stop his opponent.
In the second the sailor lad was a little
more lively and landed a few good wal
lops. During the third McDonald con
tinued to rush, but the other generally
met him half way. The fourth was In
McDonald's favor t ..though he did not land
often, confining himself to rushing Stew
art to the ropes and wearing him down. )
Joe Sharkey and Jimmy Ryan went
one round. Then Sharkey got a wallop
on the Jaw and he was In no hurry about
coming up again. Jack Dunne had Joe
Larkin all but out in the third when sud
denly the latter landed him one on the
Jaw and he went to the carpet for the
count.
McDonald beats stewart.

yesterday afternoon by his mother upon
her rÂ«turn home from a visit to San Lo

rounding the demise of the unfortunate

o'clock in an intoxicated condition. Mrs.
Brommer, upon her return home, detected

The second meeting was in the Twenty
eighth Assembly District, at Occidental
Hall. 236 Third street. His talk here was
mostly devoted to "De Young's business
men's ticket," as he styled the Republi
can nominees. Business men were all
very well In their way, but they were not
so well fitted to nil those positions as
men who were brought up in the political
field. In support of his remarks he quoted
several of the largest Eastern cities that
have lawyers at the head of their muni
cipal affairs.
"Law," he said. "Is the Incarnate sense
of the people at large." He referred to
the Republican party as "a mere shell."
and wound up his remarks by an en-
Franklin K. Lane, McNab's candidate
Cot Mayor, addressed two large audiences
last night. The first meeting was held In
the Forty-fourth District, at Garibaldi
Hall on Broadway. Here Lane had the
Italian contingent to deal with, and
opened his remarks by referring to the
Tivoli, where the works of the great Ital
ian masters were at present being sung.
He gave the Civil Service Commission a
tremendous rap, Baying that that service
waa made for the rich man and directly
opposed to the laboring man. He then
touched on the $18,000,000 that is to be
spent upon the new Improvements to the
city during the next administration, and,
according to his Ideas, unless the Demo
cratic party had absolute charge of the
expenditure, the money would be wasted
and very little would drift into the pock
ets of the laboring classes.
Oscood Putnam acted as chairman, and
on the stage were Judge Mogan, Dr.

ULOTE ADDRESSES MEETINGS.
The friends of John J. Greif in the pan
handle district met last night at Devisa
dero and Oak streets. Sixty members
signed the roll." Harry E. Fleming was
elected chairman, Richard Carey vice
chairman, and Charles Born, secretary.
A campaign committee was appointed by
the chairman to canvas% the district In
the interest of Mr. Greif's candidacy. Re
marks were made by II. E. Fleming,
Thomas C. Wilson, James ( Cairns and
several others. After giving three cheers
for their favorite the club' adjourned to
meet at the same place on next Monday
evening.
Campaigning for Greif.
Mayer Schmitz told the assembly last
evening that if the Labor party north
of Market street was half as enthusiastic
as the party south of Market street there
would be no auestlon as to the result of
the election. It is Just possible that
Schmitz does not realize that the people
he addresses on the south side of the city
are the same people who listen to his re
marks on the north side.
The second Schmitz meeting of the even
ing was in the Forty-fourth District, but
a large portion of the assembly proved
to be a following, of tho Mayor from
Steimke Hall. If those who followed him
to Apollo Hall had hoped to hear a new
speech they Were bitterly disappointed, as
in both cases his remarks were Identi
cal. At each meeting last evening, as
well as at last Monday's meeting, ha
strongly denounced the Bulletin for what
he termed the "base lies that paper has
published," and stated that the newsboys
had demonstrated their -affection for him
by refusing to sell the Bulletin.
Though there were still several other
nominees to speak, at the close of the
Mayor's remarks tho audience promptly
filed out. and the majority of the people
followed Schmitz to Apollo Hall on Stock
ton street.
Mayor Schmitz made a short address,
owing to the numerous other meetings
he had to attend. He explained to those
present that it waa necessary they should
all irive their votes to tho Labor Union
nominees; that the time had come when
the laboring man who earned his bread
by the sweat of his brow was to have
a voice in the government of the city;
that Justice should bo demanded by them,
and in order to get Justice they must
elect the man who was born of the work-
Ing people and who had the interest of
the workinff people at heart.
Mr. Gallagher made a strong address,
upholding the last two years of Schmltz's
office as an example of integrity, hon
esty and justice toward the working class
of San Francisco. Gallagher stated that
Franklin K. Lane had entered the cam
paign without the slightest hope of ever
holding the office of Mayor, but with the
Intent of keeping the victory from Bchmltz
In order that Crocker may be elected.
Others who spoke were Powel Fredrick,
nominee for County Clerk, and Frank
Conklin,. candidate for Auditor.
Walter Gallagher was the first man to
address the small assamblage, which con
sisted principally of Labor party nominees
and little boys.
The first of a series of six district meet-
Ings attended by Mayor Schmitz last
evening was held in Steimke Hall, on
Octavia street, in the Forty-first District.
Large bonfires blazed in the middle of
the streets and the sidewalks in the vicin
ity of the hall were thronged with small
boys eager for a glimpse of the Mayor.
The meeting was called to order by M.
Bollo, president of the Forty-first Dis
trict Union Labor Club.

I/ABOB PARTY MEETINGS.
Mayor Schmitz Addresses Gatherings
treaty to all good Democrats' south of
Market street to come to the front and
support the ticket In opposition to the
wise men of the Republican party north
of Market street.
The Democratic committee on vacancies
met yesterday and filled the vacancy
on the Democratic ticket for Tax Collec
tor by nominating John Vinal as'candi
date for that oftice.
The fourteen men who had registered
from the Baltimore House and from
houses on Jessie street failed to appear
before the Election Commission upon cita
tions, and their names were ordered
stricken from the. great register.
The Election Commission awarded the
contract for printing 100,000 affidavits to
Phillips, Smyth & Van Norden, the second
lowest bidder,* because the lowest bidder
had not bid according to specifications.
The commission declared the official re
sult of the recen* election for the acquisi
tion of the Geary-street road to be 14,351
for the proposition and 10,790 against.
The total vote cast was 25,276.
During the registration of voters for the
municipal election, many persons applied
whose answers to the questions asked by
the clerks in the Registrar's office were
so uncertain as to cause suspicion as to
their right to register. In every caso of
that kind, note waa taken and a list
prepared. On Friday last twenty depu
ties were detailed by the Registrar to
canvass the entire city, and especially
the lodging-houses. One of the most sus
picious cases was that of a number of
colored men, apparently ex-soldlers on
their return from the Philippines. . They
were marshaled by Sam . King, who ap
peared to be prompting them In their
answers. Of twenty registered, seventeen
were found either not living at /the ad
dress given, or from fictitious addresses.
Every lodging-house- keeper Is compelled
by law to furnish a copy of the register
of his house, and these will be compared
with the Registrar's list of voters.
. The examination bo far shows a large
number of names of men on the register
vrho will be prevented from voting on
election day. Any person who attempts
to vote, who Is not lejrally entitled to do
so, will be arrested and prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

Fraudulent Registration.
Andrew L. Johnston, chairman, in
speaking of the non-attendance of Mayor
Schmitz, said:
"Mayor Schmitz gave his word that
he would be present to-night to deliver
the address of welcome to thÂ© visitors,
but I understand that he is doing poli
tics in the Spring Valley district. We
are not shedding tears over him,"

of Sciences Hall last night. Mayor
Schmitz had Riven his word to the com
mittee that he would deliver an address
of welcome on behalf of the city, but he
failed to attend.
Republicans of the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth Assembly districts will
rally to-night at Occidental Hall. 245
Third street, to cheer Henry J. Crocker
and other nominees of the Republican
party. There Is great enthusiasm south
of Market street for the Republican
cause.
Arthur G. Fisk, secretary of the Repub
lican campaign committee, was nomi
nated for secretary and he declined on
the ground that he would not be able to
attend to the duties. He said he was
working ten or twelve hours a day to
bring about the success of the Republican
party. The nomination was withdrawn
and Harry Strahel was elected secretary.
Mr. Lackmann called upon Fisk to ex
plain why he was violating union rules by
working more than eight hours a day.
Fisk, in a clever speech, said that he
was working energetically to bring about
tha success of the ticket, well knowing
that in doing so he was aiding his friend,
Henry H. Lynch. The speaker further
told how Mr. Lynch had helped him to
bring about his election to the Assembly
In a district which had not gone Repub
lican in ten years. He also told of the
many friends Lynch had among the work
ingmen and business men of the commu
nity. He said he felt certain that Lynch
would win and by a handsome majority.
E. E. Gates, E. L. Van der Naillen,
Richard Cox, ex-Judge James E. Barry
and others spoke highly about the Repub
lican candidate for Sheriff." Mr. Crocker
took his leave before the meeting was
over in order that he might attend other
meetings. He was again cheered heartily.
The Republicans of the Thirty-eighth
Assembly District will meet to-morrow
evening at Mascot Hal!, 1106 Golden Gate
avenue, between Buchanan and Webster
streets. Senator E. I. Wolfe will pre
side. Henry J. Crocker, the Republican
standard bearer, will address the peo
ple. Isidore Golden, Daniel A. Ryan and
John S. Partridge will also epeak. Frank
Grimes, Charles C. Morris and Isidore
Golden constitute the committee on ar
rangements.
ABTHTTB. FISK EXPLAINS.
I have nothing to eay against the candidate
en the other ticket. He Is a nice man. but,
in epite of the fact that he stands upon the
platform of his party which expressly states
that lu candidates shall not accept a nomina
tion from another party, he so far forgets
hiÂ« manhood, dignity and honor as to receive
another nomination. I know that If Henry R.
Lynch had stood upon a Republican platform
and Indorsed it. and that platform said he
should not t*kÂ« another nomination, he would
not have accepted it. (Applause.)
I told them In thÂ« convention whÂ«n I nomi
nated Mr. Lynch tbat hÂ» would make a* good
a Sheriff as we have ever had in this city and
county. All I want Mr. Lynch to do and all
tha peopl* want him to do is to carry en the
business of his office In the some efficient, up
right and honorable manner as It has been
during the last four years under John Lack
mann. Mr. Lynch Is a first-class man. Mr.
Lynch comes from the people. He represents
the true California pioneer spirit. He is a
man who has lived here all his life. He has
had business dealings in this city, and all
men who have come In contact with him hare
words of praise for him. He is a jrreat btÂ»
husky fellow, and if he Is elected Sheriff ht*
can go out and carry on the work of, his of
fice unaided.
toward him and expreesed the belief that
he would be elected If the enthusiasm
they displayed was a standard of judging
the Interest they were taking In his fight.
Isidore Golden was next called upon to
â¢peak and raid In part:
HENRY J. CROCKER is an Weal can
didate. When it comes to meeting
his fellow citizens man to man he
outclasses Schmitz in warmth and
cordiality and makes Lane look like
an Iceberg. Yesterday Mr. Crocker met
many of his friends <yi Mission, Howard,
Folsom and Bealo streets. Wherever he
went he received cordial and positive as
surances of support.
Later in the day he visited the Potrero
and South San Francisco. He went there
on business matters, but did not neglect
the opportunity to do some campaigning
in behalf of the Republican ticket. Henry
J. Crocker's winning personality counts
largely In his favor as a leader of the Re
publican forces.
He does not go around casting glances
of admiration at himself or gazing Into
space with the far away Moses look of
the lofty and superior orator. He is a
plain, penlal man of affairs who has min
gled enough with men to appreciate the
fact that others can tell him something
that he does not know.
He is not so ingenuous as to suppose
that every workman that gives him the
cordial hand grasp is going -to give him
his vote also, but he is conscious of the
fact that many of the men who are em
ployed in the shops, factories and other
establishments of the great manufactur
ing districts of San Francisco are active
ly supporting his candidacy for Mayor,
and he appreciates the value of that sup
port because the professional politicians
and job chasers said that he would not
derive any strength from the ranks of the
laboring men. The men who toil for a
livelihood frankly tell Mr. Crocker that
they would rather see in the Mayor's chair
a plain, straightforward business man
than a smooth, oily politician. Crocker's
style of campaigning suits the workers.
The Republicans of the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth Assembly districts will
have a Joint rally this evening at Occi
dental Hall. 245 Third street, between
Howard and Folsom. The meeting will
be called to order by Thomas Westoby
of the Twenty-eighth District, who will
Introduce Leon Samuels of the Twenty
ninth District as chairman of the evening.
Henry J. Crocker, John E. McDougald,
William S. Barnes,' Daniel A. Ryan, Percy
V. Long, Henry H. Lynch, E. S. Salo
mon, John J. Greif and other candidates
will address the meeting. In addition
there will be singing and music.
Ruefs candidate for Mayor Is not mak
ing much progress In the direction of win
ning support. A few days ago he made
a tour of the mercantile and manufactur
ing districts and ascertained that many
voters who supported him two years ago
had resolved to vote for Henry J. Crocker
on November 3. It begins to dawn on
the Schmitz mind that Ruefs presence
In the Union Labor party In, an element
of weakness rather _.than a tower of
strength. Schmitz is' advising Ruef to
keep clear of the labor meetings and de
vote his whole time to the distribution of
campaign banners and buttons. It Is
roughly estimated that Ruef has already
disbursed $25,000 in this contest in herald
ing the attractions of Schmitz. In order
to increase the fund there is talk of ex
hibiting Parry and the colt and fixing
the price of single admission at the mod
est figure of 10 cents. Everything else
belonging to the Schmitz administration
seems to have been farmed out. A good
deal of the stuff that passes current as
Schmitz enthusiasm is really hot air or
steam generated by gangs of taxeaters
who are on the municipal payroll. They
go from one district meeting to another
singing the praises of Eugene and silent
ly worshiping Abe. The vote for Schmitz
on November 3 will fall far below what
it was two years ago. It was estimated
In 1301 that 6000 voters belonging to the
Primary League supported Schmitz In or
der to rebuke the bosses. In this cam
paign the Republicans are united and con
fident of yictory. Ruers following Is less
than Â»v^, and it Is getting: smaller rather
than larger. As a matter of fact, there
are no well known Republicans In the
Ruef-Schmitz camp. It is expected, how
ever, that Schmitz will lead Lane In the
race, because the Lnlon Labor men will
not support a McNab candidate. Lane's
efforts to break into the Union Labor
camp have failed. All indications point
to a large plurality for Henry J. Crocker.
Carpenter Falls From Tank.
Edward Flynn, a carpenter residing at
735 Brannan street, while building a water
tank at Lyons street and Pacific avenue
yesterday, fell from a temporary platform
a distance of thirty feet. He was conveyed
to the Emergency Hospital and treated
for Injuries to the right side, a possible
fracture of three ribs and a sprained
right wrist.
Thrre were Fhouts for Lynch ard the
candidate was given a irreat reception
â¢when be was presented. He thanked his
friends for their mark of good feeling
LYNCH IS POPTJLAB.

AN L .PORTANT ELECTION.
We have before us something of great im
portance to our people and to cur beautiful
city ar/, that If the ticket that shall be elect

I want to say a few more words. Mr. Henry
H. Lynch has the indorsement of the Republi

Dcs't let us make two bites of a cherry. Don't

In the midst of his speech Kenry J.
Crocker entered the hall. He was recog
nized ar.d cheered to the ecno. Mr. Lack
mann ictroduced him to the assemblage
and Mr. Crocker spoke as follows:

Judee de Haven Instructed the jury that
the defendant could not be convicted of
smuggling unless it had been shown that
he had actually brought the goods
through the customs lines. The prisoner
could not be convicted of an attempt to
smuggle because there was no statute in
existence under which an attempt to
smuggle could' be prosecuted.'
' This was the second trial of the case,
the jury having failed to agree on the
first trial.
Nao Nanamatsu, a Japanese, was ac
quitted by a jury in the United States
District Court yesterday afternoon of the
crimes of smuggling and of attempting
to bribe a customs Inspector. The defend
ant arrived on the steamship Hongkong
Mam on April 15 of this year, and when
stopped at the gangplank by an Inspector
offered him a $5 cold piece, which the
inspector refused. Nao had a large bas
ket containing silks of the value of $165.
and he testified that he had proffered
the money for the purpose of paying the
duty.

Movements of Steamers.
The Japanese steamship Nippon Maru, which
Ealls to-morrow for the Orient, will take about
3S00 tons of cargo and eighty-five cabin pas
Â«engers. The Chinese passengers that arrived
on the Nippon were released yesterday from
the quarantine station as was* the Japanese,
crew of the liner. Getting the steamship
r<>ady for sea "without the assistance of the
regular crew proved a big undertnking, but
the emergency found General Agent Avery
fully equipped and the Nippon will sail on
time and In her usual yacht-like condition.
"Will Take a Full Cargo.
The Siberia, which arrived Sunday night.
but did not dock until Monday morning,
brought a cargo of more than C000 tons
measurement. She sails October 23 and there
is waiting for her freight measuring more than
Quick Work on Siberia.
Not cnly has hope of saving the Gifford
been abandoned, but so great has been the
havoc wrought by the sea and the crashing
down of her own eparg thai It is doubtful
whether there will be left enough of the Ill
fated wir.d-jamn-.er to orfer at an auction sale.
The chief pity in the loss or the Gifford lies
in the fact that proper action taken immedi
ately after she had stranded would undoubt
edly ha-.e resulted in saviÂ»g the vÂ«-fspI. No
body was authorized to take tnat action, how
ever, and during the precious hours Inter
vening bftwetn the disaster and the arrival
of cabled authority from England the sf>a
and sand conspired successfully to seal the
Gilford's fate. That she will be moved at all
Is unlikely. Men that should know now pre
dict that for many months the bones of the
jrood ship will decorate the beach, an eloquent
reminder to landsmen of the peril that lurks
In ihc path of thofe that go down to the sea
in ships and to sailormen a grim warning of
the necessity for care in navigating shoal
waters.
The Doomed Gifford.
For the first three days of the voyage
heavy head winds ar.d seas were encoun
tered, but the Alameda made good time
through it all, and that without making
life unpleasant for the passengers. Before
returning to Honolulu the liner will go
on the drytiocfc for a new Jacket of anti
foullng paint.
Her passengers included the following
named:
D. W. Anderson. Professor Bersrer. T. H.
Ber.ton. J. Bun and wife. Captain C. Capllos,
Mrs. J. W. Calhcart. J. N. Collins. W. J.
Oolburn. E. P. Dow, MiÂ«s F. Dowling. W.
Eieiauil and wife, E. S=. Knight, G. E. Kal
linbraker. Miss A. MoLran. Mrf. J. Ouder
kirk and son, H. G. Rhodes
In spile of head winds, which continued
for three days, the Oceanic Steamship
Company's liner Alameda arrived yes
terday from Honolulu on schedule time
and was only five days and twenty-three
lours on the voyage. Although she had
on board 251 souls, the steamship was
detained in quarantine less than an hour.
In that time the Feder.il doctors had
taken everybody's temperature and sat
isfied themselves that all of the 231 were
la good health.
The steamer brought 145 passengers in
the steerage and her cargo included 5W
tons of sugar and a large shipment of
tropical fruits. Among the cabin pas
sengers was Professor Bcrgcr, Honolulu's
famous bandmaster, v.ho has come to the
mainland in soirch of gems for his reper
toire.

The Federal Grand Jury brought in an
indictment yesterday against George T.
McDonnell, alias H. Epstein, alias Rev.
J. R. Taylor, "pastor of the Church' of
the Redeemed at Emeryville," charging
him with having used the mails with
intent to defraud C. G. Pope of Alturas
and Clay A. Straley of Cottonwood. As
pastor of the fictitious church at Emery
ville McDonnell wrote to Page and Stra
ley, who are oarbers, stating that a mem
ber of the congregation had recently died
after having confessed that many years
previously he had stolen money from
them and wished to make reparation by
turning over a pawn ticket for a gold
locket and a solitaire diamond which had
been pledged for $12 50 with "H. Epstein,"
on Kearny street. They were directed to
return the pawn ticket and the money
to "Epstein," who was McDonnell, and
receive the valuable locket and the big
diamond.
The Jury ignored the charge against
Vernon L. Ogden for having improperly
addressed a postal card to B. Kennedy of
Escalon. Cal. The jury declined to indict
a man for putting too many initials into
another man's name. The abbreviation
habit saved Mr. Ogden from Indictment.
Murphy claims that it was not until
shortly before his aunt's death that he
learned of Kearns' alleged duplicity. He
pays that he asked Mrs. Canney if she
knew him and she said "No." He says
she could not even remember his name.
Murphy â¢ says further that after he
learned of Kearns' actions he went to
him and demanded a return of the funds
and Kearns promised to return them. He
has not kept his word, says Murphy,
hence the suit.
A few days later, Murphy alleges,
Kearns went to the German Bu' ding and
Loan Society and withdrew the $175 on de
posit there, and converted it to his own
use. Later, charges Murphy, he visited
the Hibernia bank, and notwithstanding
the existence of Mrs. Canney's deposit of
$4300, negotiated a loan of $1500, giving as
security a mortgage on Mrs. Canney's
realty. This /sum, . alleges Murphy,
Kearns also appropriated to his own
use.
Mrs. Canney died In August of last year.
According to Murphy's complaint she
was mentally unsound for some time
prior to. her death. He says Kearns
knew of this, procured an introduction to
her throuprh a neighbor and then plan
ned to secure her property, which con
sisted of an improved lot at 104 Fair Oaks
Btreet, $4300 on deposit in the Hibernia
bank and $175 deposited with the German
Savings and Loan Society. On April 1,
alleges Murphy, Kearns visited his aunt,
and finding her almost unconscious, broke
open her trunk and took therefrom her
bank books and private papers. Later
in the evening, it is alleged he again
called, this time in the company of No
tary Daggett. Mrs. Canney, says her
nephew, was on the occasion of the
second visit still in a state bordering on
unconsciousness and was as clay in the
hands of the alleged schemers. He says
Kearns represented to her that he was
her friend and anxious to help her care
for her property, and she affixed her
cross to a paper giving Kearns her power
of attorney. The document was prepared
beforehand, says Murphy, and after the
old lady had made her mark, Daggett at
tached his seal.
In a. suit filed by Edward Murphy yes
terday against Attorney W. T. Kearns
and Notary Public A. K. Daggett he
charges them with the serious offense of
taking advantage of the' enfeebled, men
tal and physical condition of his aunt,
the late Jane Canney, and swindling her
out of her money and realty. The suit
Is for 51675, alleged by Murphy to have
been fraudulently converted by the de
fondants.
The grand secretary reported that there
were 1252 Juvenile members of the order
in the State of California, and during the
year twenty-eight new lodges had been
organized. Ex-Judge Thompson an
nounced that the Orphans' Home was
now self-supporting and in possession of
three farms, two in Solano County and
one in Yolo County, which had yielded
during the year $35,303 46 from rentals.
The farms were In part willed and m
part purchased by money willed to the
crder in trust for the orphanage by the
late E. J. Upham of Solano County. |
The sessions of the convention will
begin at 9 a. m. dally, and will terminate
Friday at midnight.
MANY JUVENILES JOIN.
There were fifty-five new members ini
tiated into the Grand Lodge from various
parts of California.
In his report, the grand chief templar
announced that the Grand Lodge of
Washington had appealed to the Grand
Lodge of California to assist in defray
ing the expenses of George F. Cotterill
of Seattle, who attended an international
committee meeting that recently con
vened in Berlin, Germany, for the pur
pose of considering the propriety of elim
inating from the ritual and laws of the
order all reference to religious sentiment.
The matter will come up for action to
day. â¢ K
Among other notables of the order wno
took part in the deliberations were Cap
tain W. C. Dutton, past grand chief tem
plar of Virginia; Mrs. Runsell of Wiscon
sin, and W. S. Williams of Oakland, past
right worthy grand secretary of the
world.
INITIATE NEW MEMBERS.
The forty-fourth annual session of the
Grand Lodge of California, Independent
Order of Good Templars, opened yester
day morning at 102 O'Parrell street. The
following officers were present:
William Crowhurst of Oakland, deputy
right worthy grand templar, acting for
Jo&eph Malins of Birmingham, England,
presiding officer of the order throughout
the world; Rev. J. W. Webb of Fresno,
past grand chief templar; Theodore D.
Kanouse of Los Angeles, grand chief
templar; W. P. Wetherton of Santa 1
Cruz, gTand counselor; Mrs. S. E. Shaffer
of Bakersfleld, grand vice templar; F. A.
Anthony of Livermore, grand secretary;
Volney Taylor of Byron, grand treasurer;
Rev. F. G. H. Stevens of Pasadena,
grand chaplain; Arthur C. Banta of San
Jose, grand marshal, and W. E. Evans of
San Francisco, grand sentinel. Ex-Judge
Robert Thompson of San Francisco, who
was initiated into the order In 1860 in
Mokelumne Hill, Calaveras County, and
is now the financial agent of the Good
Templars' Home for Orphans at Vallejo,
and Mrs. William Crowhurst, initiated in
1664 in Placerville, and ! cousin of the
founder of the Order of Good Templars,
were also present.
IO.CjOO tons. Handling this lG/'OO tons of
merchandise in ten days is a bis job and
made all the more difficult by the restricted
accommodation which even tne quarter-mile
long- Pacific Mail wharf affords. The discharg
ing, however, has been almost completed and
Captain Wilson has the loading s-tuation well
in hand. The Siberia's passenger cccommoda
tlons will be tried to the utmost and when
Ehe leaves here her cabins will be full of pas
senrers. most of them going through to the
Orient.
Marshal Shine congratulates himself
also upon the fact that since he assumed
the duties of his office not a single pris
oner has escaped from his custody or that
of his deputies, with the exception of the
six Chinese who were released by Deputy
Gamble in the substitution case, but tha
Marshal was not responsible for that. A
few days ago one of a number of Chinese
being 1 taken across the bay to the Ala
meda County jail slipped his handcuffs
and tried to escape, but was immediately
seized and rehandcuffed. The live Chl
â¢iese who escaped last Sunday morning
from the Federal Grand Jury room had
never been at any time in the Marshal's
custody, for the reason that they had
never been arrested. In their case no
complaints had been filed and no war
rants had been issued, so that the Mar
shal had no authority to interfere. The
men were under detention, perhaps ille
gally, by the Chinese bureau pending an
investigation into their right to be in this
country.
In the prosecution of these causes co-operate
Tvlth the District Attorney and give him all
the assistance In your power. You seem to be
in a fair way to break up the practice of sub
stitution, and in so doing have done the public
a creat service. Respectfully,
W. A. DAY, Acting Attorney General.
Dear Sir: Your letter of October 1 and also
your letters of prior dates relating to th-s ar
rest by you of parties implicated in substitut
ing Chinese have been received. I wish to
thank you for the very efficient and effective
work, which you have done in these matters
end to assure you of my appreciation of your
efforts. â¢

I'nited States Marshal John H. Shine
yesterday when he received through the
mails a letter from the Department of
Justice, of which tffe following is a copy:

NEW YonK. Oct. 13. â To-day"Â« stock mar
ket iiassed through a number ct separate
phases and ended the day in a nearly stag
nant condition and with prices for the most
part not far from last night's level. The mar
ket enjoyed Its period of decided strength dur
ing the early part of the day when the sell
ing pressure which has been so conspicuous
recently seemed to be entirely withdrawn. An
organized party of professional traders made
an attempt to etart prices upward, perceiving
a rumliÂ»r of circumstances whlrh tiijrht work
in favor of the attempt. The most notable
cf thÂ«Â» wan the building up of a large short
interest, which gave evidence of its existence
by sn eagerness to borrow stocks for delivery,
causing a rtuml>er of the Industrial to com
mand a *!!? ht premium for that purpose. Lon
don was inr-lined to take a more cheerful
viÂ»w 01 the financial outlook and felt some
what reesrur*-d over the prospects in the Far
FTaft and de<-idedl> so over the absence of
trouble in the progress of the Stock" Exchange
settlement.
The rawt important effect of the London
position was the Â»-elaxation of pressure here.
Speculative circles were Inclined to attach im
portance to some very large and concentrated
buying of United States PUel preferred, which
was noted yeeterrfay an.1 grave rise to reports
of a very Important accumulation. That stock
In contecuence recovered to 60 and Inspired
a hope- that its downward course had been
arrested at last. The importance attached to
the shipbuilding case wa 9 Indicated by the
cothJ effect or a rumor that the suit was to
\* adjusted snd discontinued. At the same
time thÂ«re wÂ»s some talk of a dividend in
crease on Amalgamated Copper and of a
declaration of a dividend on Reading second
ireferred. A downward plunge !n United
States Steel preferred to 57'.Â«. the k-wtst price
on record, had a chilling effect on Utt whole
movement and caused a reactionary tendency.
ThÂ» selling o f the stock was associated with
the renewed stock market flurry in Plttsburg.
and It was rumored that the Steel preferred
offered in the market came out of collateral
for a loan which was affected by the Pittsburg
money troubles.
A 3-point break In WestinghouÂ«e Electric
and a decrease of II Jn the first preferred
were supposed to find their orlrln at the same
source.
The slump of 5 points in Colorado Fuel had
no news to explain It, but was suppesed to be
connected with a speculative accumulation of
this stock while Its control was still disputed.
The railroad equipment companies were still
notably weak under the influence of the of
ficial admissions of large measures of economy
by the great railroad systems, which are ex
pected to become general throughout the rail
road world. A rale of old Rock Island stock
at a decline of 13 points attracted some at
tention. The break In Canadian Paclfio Just
at the clo** was attributed to orderg from
Montreal. The Western demand far currency
Is still deferred and New York exchange at
Chlcaxo went to 15c premium.
Outside of the fluctuations in Steel bonds
tbe bond market was narrow- and unchanged.

The Potato market is overstockad with Bur
banks from the river and Oregon, and those
descriptions are very weak. Th* best grades
of Salinas Burhanks are In good requ?Â«t for
local consumption and continue to brinjf good
prlcÂ«s. Sweet I'otatoes were a shade firmer
than en the preceding day. as there were 110
fresh arrival* from Merced. Fancy Onions
are in rather light supply and steady at pre
vious prices.
Tomatoes arrived freely and the market con
ttnued easy for the general run of supplies,
with surplus stock going to the canners at the
minimum quotation. Some choice, smooth
stock in extra larire. boxes sold up to 65c per
box. but In a small way. Lima Beans were
scarce and cleaned up quickly at higher
rates. The other vegetables arrived freely
and priefs stood about as before quoted.

Provisions were firm at the opening, due to

December and January lard. Continued selling

CHICAGO, Oct. 13.â Firm cables in the iaee
of the bisr decline hers yesterday were a 'bull
factor at the start, and December wheat opened
a shade to 4@%c higher at 78%c to 78%c.
Outside markets were weak, however, and this
fact in adldtion to the favorable weather in
the Northwest, brought out considerable sell
ing orders during the first hour and a weaker
tone developed. St. Louis houses were leaders
in tha early selling movement. With but little
demand December sold off to 78 Uc. An up
turn at Mlnneajjolis. due to a better demand
for flour and a stronc cash demand, caused a
sharp rally later in the day. The bull feeling
was augmented by the comparatively small
increase, in t*>e world's visible supply. Brad
street's reports showing an Increase of 4.195.000
bushels, against 8.940.000 bushels a year ago.
There was some influential buying late In the
session, with but little disposition to sell on
the part of a-ny one. Closinsr prices were near
the top. December being %@'T%c higher at 79%c.
Corn ruled weak the early part of the session,
due to mild weather throughout the. West and
weakness in wheat. Ths latest strength in
wheat stimulated buying on the part of local
traders and the market turned strong, closing
at the top, with December 4^3"%c higher at
45 '4 c
OatÂ» were easy at the start under Belling
by commission houses, with little apparent ef
fort to support price?. Final figures on De
cember were He higher at 37*Â»c.
Chicago Grain Market.
WHEAT FREIGHTS â Some charters are be- 1
ing drawn for Barley at about 13s 6d, usual
European options, showing that the freight
market is still down to bedrock, with a vast
amount of idle tonnage in port. The chartered
Wheat fleet In the harbor has a registered ton
nase of 36,278, against 41.600 tons on the same
date last year; disengaged, 114,190 tons,
against 49.570; on the way to this port, 219,300
tons. a?alnst 220.900.
WHEATâ The markets all over the world
continue without especial feature. Bradstreefs
gives the world's visible supply an increase for
the week of 4.193.C00 bushelsu The foreign
markets have shown more tone of late, but not
enough to advance quotations.
Chicago was higher again and reported the
speculative sentiment stiil bearish, though the
situation was getting stronger daily.
This market continues qutet and featureless.

ALAMEDA. Oct. 13.â Arrested whtla
trylng to sell a stolen bicycle to the de
tectlvÂ© who was looking for him was tha
surprising experience of 'GeorgÂ© Bruce
Young this afternoon. Hunger and want
of employment prompted him to commit
the theft, according to the statement he
made after being taken Into custody.
Young purloined the wheel from the
cyclery of George A. Faulkner. 351
Twelfth street, Oakland, and rode to this
city on it. As soon as Faulkner ascer
tained that his property was missing h8
notified thÂ© police departments of Oak
land. Berkeley and Alameda and the bicy
cle shops In the three cities. Detective
George R. Brown was detailed to visit
tile local bicycle establishments, and went
first â¢ to tho cyclery of A. O. Dexter on
Central avenue and Oak street. Young
was there endeavoring to dispose of the
stolen wheel to the proprietor." The latter
refusing .to purchase the wheel. Young
offered it to. the officer for $7 50. Brown
informed the astonished seller that ha
would take the bicycle and him also.
The prisoner at first gave an assumed
name, but a search of his pockets re
vealed several letters addressed to George
Bruce Young, which the stranger .later
admitted was his cognomen. Young said
that he had arrived recently from Reno,
and becoming discouraged through his
failure to secure occupation was tempted
to steal with a view of realizing money
to ward oft starvation. He claims to have
well to do relatives In South Dakota.
Young was turned over to the Oakland
authorities.

HUNGER PROMPTS
THEFT OF WHEEL
And sure enough the freshmen did pur
sue the tactics to a successful Issue in
the second half. After ten minutes of the
hardest kind of work It grot the. ball over
the goal line for a touchdown, Kern and
Crow, who had been substituted for
Tweedy, having negotiated the ball
through the tackles and ends all the way.
Kern carried the ball over the line and
then kicked the goal, making six points.
Kern, Mclnnls and Sweeney were then
taken out of the freshmen line and that
made It easier for Belmont, which pro
ceeded to butt great tig holes In the other
line. The freshmen were not able to hold
at all, so fierce were the Belmont rushes.
But the freshmen braced up and held, on
the flfteen-yard line, getting the ball on
a close decision that hinged on Inches.
Just after that the time limit expired and
saved California from being tied.
Kern played his usual dashing game at
right half and Tweedy at left half was
close behind him In ground gaining. Gil
lis and Mclnnis, the freshmen ends.
piayed gritty games. Bishop, Belmont'3
fullback, played the best game for the
visitors. Jackson, the left half, made the
longest run of the dayâ twenty yarda.
The teams lined up in the following or

Th freshmen will not play against any
other team this week, as all its strength
will be reserved for the Intercollegiate
game against Stanford next Saturday In
San Frandaco. Coaches "Whipple and Hall
expressed themselves as pleased with tEe
showing made to-day and predict victory
for Saturday's contest.
But to the close observer It was patent
that California had a little the beat of
the argument and would probably win.
California gained ground and kept the
ball longer than Belmont. It made Its
best gains through the ends and tackles
on both sides, with Kern and Tweedy In
the midst of the hot work. It was easy
to see that if California kept up these
tactics In the second half It would win.
Neither aide threatened the other's s;oal
line In the first half. They simply see
sawed up and down the middle of the
field for twenty minutes. First California
would be held on downs and then kick
and then Belmont would do the cams
thing, with no special advantage to
either. At the end of the half everybody
said there would be no scoring with two
Buch well-matched teams.
BERKELEY, Oct 13.â Thd freshmen
and tba Belxnont School played a gamo ot
football on the Berkeley campus tills aft
ernoon that for keen, heady playlnjf and
excitement put every other game- that has
been played this year In the shade. ThÂ«
result was In doubt ud to the very last
minute and toward the end a critical time
came when only a hair prevented Balmont
from tying the score. The freshmen final
ly carried the day with six points to Bel
mont's zero.
Game Is Fast and Result In Doubt
Tip to Last.
Claude Kern, the spectacular right half
back of the freshman team, was chosen
captain of the eleven this afternoon by
a convention composed of Coach "Whip
pie, Assistant Coach Hall and Trainer
Christie. Kern was selected becausa hÂ»
knows the game thoroughly and Is de
pended upon to keep tbo others going
from the Btart. His strong point Is hit
ting the line and knowing wher* to hit
It, and when the ball Is passed to him be
hind the line something happens.
Kern has bad a good deal of experience
on preparatory school elevens. He played
with the Lick School in 1SD9 and i9w* and
with tha Berkeley High School in 1301.
He Is 6 feet 1 Inch in height and weighs
170 pounds.

P^latt Wants Temporary
Franchise for Geary-
Street Road.
Horace G. Platt, president of the Geary
street Railway Company, sent a com
munication yesterday to Chairman Braun
hart of the Supervisors' Public Utilities
Committee asking that the corporation be
permitted to operate its road between the
expiration of its franchise on November
6, 1903, and such time as a new franchise
is granted. The communication follows:
The franchise of the Geary-atreet. Park and
Ocean Railroad Company expires on the 6th
day of November of this year.
Kmier the charter. If the board determines
to grant a new franchise, notice of Â«uch deter
mination must be advertised for ten days.
After the completion of said ten days the board
must then wait at least twenty days before
taking further action. During this thirty days
bids may be filed. At the expiration of said
twenty days an ordinance may be Introduced
by the board granting the rranchise to thÂ«
highest bidder. The board must then wait
ninety days before putting the ordinance on
final passage.
It will, therefore, require 120 days or four
months before the franchise could be granted to
tho successful bidder, if the board should de
termine to grant the franchise to any.
This company would like to be permitted to
operate It* road pending the expiration of Its
franchise and the granting of the new fran
chise to whoever bo the successful bidder. I
would like to have a consultation with you
upon the subject ln order that we may discuss
this suggestion.
If you will be so kind as to name the hour
and place when we could consult ln regard to 1
this matter, either at the City Hall or at your
office or at my office. I shall be much obliged.
Aa this matter will be referred to your com
mittee, I make this suggestion in order that
matters may be facilitated by a previous dis
cussion.
In reply the following communication
was sent by Braunhart to Platt:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 12th Inst. ln re franchise
of Geary-street. Park and Ocean Railroad Com
r>any and beg to inform you that as chairman
oTThe Committee on Public Utilities I have
deemed It advisable to call a meeting of the
committee on Thursday. October 22. 1903. at
3 o'clock p m. at which time the suggestions
you have made will be duly considered by the
full committee. Your attendance at said meet-
Ing Is respectfully requested.
Young Ladies' Institute.
The members of Young Ladies' Institute
No. 7 of this city have arranged for an
entertainment and ball in Lyric Hall, 121
Eddy street, on the evening of October 29.
A feature of the programme of entertain
ment -will be a farce in which several
prominent members of the institute will
take part.
In the meantime Nawella Williams, an
other stepdaughter of the accused, ar
rived upon the scene. The young woman
talked very freely about the way things
had been going on ln the Russell house
for the last three months. She said she
had been driven away from home by the
brutality of her stepfather and that she
worked for A. Bradley at 1940 Market
street, and entirely supported herself.
She also said that her stepfather fought
with her because she would not give him
her earnings, so she left and struck out
for herself. She stated that two months
ago her stepfather drew a pistol and
threatened to kill her mother and that she
Jumped between the two and saved her
mother's life. She said that her mother
had been in fear of her life for some time
end had decided to leave Russell and was
saving her earnings for this purpose. Her
mother worked at the Code, Portwood
Canning Company. Sha asserted that
only two weeks ago Russell had
taken her mother up to the Mar-
V.ct-strcet cut and, pointing out a se
cluded spot, saJd: "When I get ready I
am going to bring you up here and kill
you." She also stated that Russell abused
her little sisters shamefully, hitting, kick
ing and beating them unmercifully, and
BELIEVES IT IS MURDEB.
Jeff Russell was dispatched for a" doctor,
but returned with Officer W. V. Burke,
who arrived. on the scene very soon after
the tragedy. In the meantime Russell
was crying and groaning and kicking up
a tremendous commotion, raving like a
madman, yelling out that he thought it
was a burglar he was shooting at and
that he never meant to kill his wife. De
tectives D. G. Bell and E. Stanton were
promptly on the scene and took Russell
to the Hall of Justice, where a charge of
murder was entered against him, and the
body of the murdered woman was con
veyed to the Morgue. ' . â¢â¢ ...
ORA RUSSELL, a colored worn- j
an, was. It is believed by the po- i
lice, brutally murdered by her
husband, Hilliard Russell, just
before daybreak yesterday. The
woman arose at 4:30 a. m. to prepare
breakfast and was standing ln the door
way leading to the kitchen of their home
at 159 Corbett avenue when her husband,
who was only six feet distant, fired the
contents of a double barreled shotgun
into her face, tearing away nearly half
of her head. Russell claims he thought
he was firing at a burglar, but the mem
bers of the family assert that the trag
edy was a cold blooded murder. Russell
and his wife occupied the main front
room of their home, two little girls Ro
sella Williams, daughter of the murdered
woman by a former husband, and Lacy
Russell, daughter of the accused, slept
together in an adjoining front room. A
back room was occupied by. Jeff Russell,
a brother of Hilliard. The little girls
were awakened by hearing the cry "bur
glar," followed by the voice of the moth
er crying; "Have mercy," and then they
heard the gunshot. Little Lacy was so
frightened that with one bound she
jumped through the closed window Into
the garden, smashing â¢ the large pane of
glass to atoms. Rosella opened the door
of her room and there found her mother
lying ln a pool of blood - and Russell
kneeling beside her shouting "Wife!
Wife!"

sent frequently under guard to Fort Mas
on and the Presidio and it is thought that
he might have been a go-between. Stokes
was the only man of the four that re
ceived any money on release.
There Is no doubt In the minds of the
officers that the prisoners were aided
by a confederate in this city. Otherwise,
the letter In which the pardons were sent
could not have been mailed to Major Pax
ton at Alcatraz. It was feared at first
that more men might have secured their
freedom through like forgeries when it
was learned that Major Morrow's book
keeping would have allowed such matters
to pass unnoticed and great relief is felt
at headquarters that the escape is an iso
lated instance.
Morrow thinks that he will get descrip
tions of the escapes within a day or two.
He does not know whether he will ask
the peace officers throughout the State
to be on the lookout. The Government
gives a reward of $30 for the return of
escaped prisoners.
He denied the charge that he had ever
been sentenced to imprisonment, but ad
mitted he had been arrested for petty
larceny, but was not convicted. He stated
that until a year ago he resided in Los
Angeles, and that his father, Sheldon Rus
sell, still livea there.
Russell is a small sized, middle aged
negro. When seen at the' Hall of Jus
tice he appeared of a very meek and
mild type and not at all the sort of brute
that the children depicted him. He stated
that he had worked at Gray Bros.' brick
yard and had been there since May. He
also said that the shooting was purely
the result of a mistake and that he al
ways kept the gun by the head of the
bed, as he feared burglars would enter
the house, as some time ago he claimed
some one had entered the house and
stolen $30 from under his pillow. He said
he was awakened about 4:30 a. m. and
looking Into the adjoining room he saw
in the faint moonlight the face of what
he thought was a white man. Thinking
it was a burglar, he grabbed the gun and
fired.
With one voice the three all expressed
the same thought that it was not only
murder but was most cowardly and bru
tal at that.

when she Interfered he would attack her.
She further stated that Russell had been
In the penitentiary for a period of three
years for criminal assault. She says he
was not a drinking man, but that he was
always ugly and cruel.
Little Rosella confirmed all her sister
had stated, and added that her stepfather
had beaten her and recently hit her on
the head and kicked her down the back
stairs. Little Lacy Russell, the young
est, also said that her father had strip
ped her, beaten her and tied her up by
the thumbs.

We figure that four or five automobiles will
be able to do the work of collecting mall in
San Francisco that now requires seventeen
horses and wagons. If the experimental work
shows that we can use automobiles for collect-
Ing mall It Is the intention to make the change,
provided, of course, that the bids for the use or
the automobiles do not exceed the amount now
allowed for the hire of horses and wagons.
Chief Postal Inspector R. R. Munroe
stated yesterday that if It was found
that the work of collecting mail could
be done by the aid of automobiles, bids
would be asked for to have the new ser
vice performed. He said:
It is not Intended to purchase automobiles
for the work, but to have the use of the ma
chines in the same manner as we now use
horses and waeons. We will ask for bids to
be furnished for the use of the machines by
the postal department. Automobiles are now
being used In some cities ln the East and their
use for collecting mall is proving most satis
factory. Saving- of time Is one of the most
essential features of the postal department.
' Before a final report Is made the vari
ous postal collection districts in this city
will be covered by automobiles, in
order that complete information may be
furnished to the postal authorities ln
Washington.
At the present time mall 1n San Fran
cisco Is collected by the use of seven
teen wagons and horses. They are fur
nished under contract by a local firm,
bids having been called for in the usual
manner.
The work of collecting mall ln this dis
trict by a wagon and horse usually cov
ers three hours, but the automobile cov
ered the ground in one hour and twenty
three minutes, a saving of one hour and
thirty-seven minutes.
The unusual spectacle of mail being
collected In an automobile attracted con
siderable attention ln the business dis
trict.
Postal Inspector James O'Connell, with
a number of postal officials, started out
in on automobile to collect mall from
boxes in a down-town district.
Collecting letters from mall boxes by
the use of automobiles Is likely to be in
augurated ln San Francisco in the near
future. The- question of Baving time in
the mall collections Is one that has been
under discussion by local postal officials
for some time, and the experimental work
of using automobiles was commenced
yesterday.
Two years ago it was given out that
a deal was about to be closed Involving
the purchase of the corner. This was
denied as the negotiations at that time
failed. Since then it has been ascertained
that the owners were willing to sell, pro
vidlr.g they could get the price they de
sired. This was placed at Jl.000.000.
The lot has a frontage of 175 feet on
Market street, 170 feet on Fourth and
375 feet on Stever.Fon street. It is covered
with old time buildings that are worth
very little Intrinsically, but. by reason
of their exceptionally good position, have
been able to earn an income that 1? re
ported to amount to $35,000 per annum.
The price that is paid for the land and
buildings is reported to be $1,000,000.
Some .of the leases run for quite a
time. Nothinp may be done toward large
ly improving the corner until they ex
pire, but it is the intention of the syndi
cate to erect a modern office building of
large cost whenever it shall seem best to
proceed.
G. H. Urabsen & Co. yesterday conclud
ed negotiations, which have been pro
ceeding for some time, for tho purchase
of the southeast corner of Market and
Fourth streets. The property, which is
opposite the old Flood building, was fhÂ«
property of Clarence H. Mackay and
Maria L. H. Mackay, his mother. The
purchaser Is a syndicate composed of lo
cal capitalists, that has plans for the
improvement cf the property when the
existing leases run out.
Ralph E. Williams, who was sent to
Alcatraz from Manila for defrauding the
Government out of about $10,000, is sus
pected of having some connection with
the escape. He was a very clever pen
man and worked ln offices where he
could become familiar with orders for
remissions of sentences.
He was also a friend of White, one of
the escapes. The last named felon worked
in the adjutant's office at the prison, but
his work was clumsy. John L. Moore
worked in the printing office at Alcatraz
and might have printed the letter heads,
although It Is generally supposed that this
part of the work at least was done on the
outside.
The two negroes were uneducated and
assigned to ordinary work. Darling was
WILLIAMS SUSPECTED.
The incident has brought to light the
fact that Judge Advocate Henry W. Mor
row has failed to keep this tally, either
through ignorance of his open duty or
through negligence. Had the news of the
escape of the four convicts not been
brought to headquarters through rumors
that circulated among the prison guards,
other men. Major Morrow admits,
might have escaped by the same
means. He states that he thought
his clerk kept such matters in
his head. Illustrative of the trite say
ing anent locking stable doors. Major
Morrow says that he Intends to keep his
books properly hereafter. He has sur
veyed his returns for the last nine
months and asserts that only the four
men have escaped on forged orders.
The officials at the prison keep a very
accurate set of accounts and cannot be
blamed for being deceived by the forgery.
Colonel Andrews of the adjutant gener
al's office took the preliminary step
in the investigation, and Gener
al MacArthur subsequently assigned the
case to Major Morrow. This latter called
in Handwriting Expert Eisensehlmmel,
who says that the work is very crude.
The printing on the forged documents is
dissimilar to the War Department pa
per and the numerals are not in the
proper alignment.
The forger knew the details of the work
perfectly. He numbered the document
improperly, however, and gave the wrong
rank to officers whose purported signa
tures were attached.
The officials at army headquarters ar.
vainly attempting to get a, trace of Jos
eph White, John L. Moore, Cornelius
Stokes (colored) and James Darling
(colored), who escaped from Alcatraz
prison a week ago to-day on forged or
ders remitting their sentences, which
amounted to about two years ln each
case. Major Morrow, judge advocate,
and Major Williams, assistant adjutant
general, assert that their signatures were
forged to the documents.
The Washington authorities tele
graphed General MacArthur yesterday
that the Secretary of War had remitted
the unexpired sentence . of Cornelius
Stokes on Monday, but that nothing had
been done in th*Â» cases of the other men.
Stokes went free on the forged order
five days before he would have been leg
ally released.
The document on which prisoners are
released Is a letter, with the War Depart
ment head, on which is typewritten a
formal order signed by an assistant ad
jutant general. The department judge
advocate and adjutant Indorse the paper
and it Is sent to Major Paxton. prison
commander, who releases the men. He
makes a report subsequently to the judge
advocate, who is supposed to compare the
returns with his orders from Washington
to see that everything Is straight.

HOW TO DO IT.
Tf ther* is onp thing more than all others
that vrill give a man a forlorn and friendless
appearance and make him morbid and
""cranky" aad disagreeable, that thing Is dys-
pepsia. It makes one forget his friends and
become morose and Irritable. He i% eo wrapped
up in hia own misery that he le inconsUerate
of every one else. Relieved of this terrible
and derrpssir-e ailment, he again becomes a
good fellow and a man among; men.
Stuart's Dy?rers=!a Tablets are beyond ques-
tion the most effective and popular remedy
ever offered to the sufferer* of this terrible
disease. The thousands and thousands of
cures they have brought about and the enor-
mous increase of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are. above all. a natural remedy. They
posre** exactly the same properties that the
pastric juiceg and other digestive fluids of the
etomach possess, and they actually do the di-
gestive work of the stomach and enable that
organ to rest and recuperate and become sound
and well. They act in a mild, natural manner
and cause r.o disturbance in the digestive or-
cans. They prex-ent any fermentation of tho
food which causes sour stomach. In fact, un-
der their influence the subject for&eU that he
has a stomach and his resulting cheerfulness
presents a creat contrast to his former dejec-
tion.

tween the two disease?, or rather that the

disturbances. I hit upon Stuart'* Dyspepsia
TablÂ«s for a remedy and invested a dollar and
a half for three boxes which lasted me three
months, and I can eat any kind of food I want
and have a good, vigorous appetite. Although
I am 77 years old, I now feel perfectly well
and without being requested by any cne I
