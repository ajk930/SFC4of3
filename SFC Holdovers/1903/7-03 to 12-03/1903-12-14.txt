It is expected that the disaster to the

These ;two buoys being on the-same

WASHINGTON. Dec. 13. â Consid
erable comment was occasioned here
to-day by reports that Secretary Root,
at a dinner given last night by the
Carabao Society, an organization of
army and navy officers who have seen
active service in the Philippines, pre
dicted that a war would soon come
between the United States and some
foreign power, but the interest dis
played in the report and the specula
tion it caused as to what the Secre
tary had in mind were dissipated this
afternoon when it became known that
the word "soon" was a misquotation.
Secretary Root himself said to-night
that he had not # predicted that a war
would come soon, but in his speech of
last night merely had stated what he
had piven utterance publicly to on
several occasions, namely that "when
the time comes, as we know it will
come some time â we do not know
when and we do not know whence, but
v.e know it will come some time â
when you (referring to both the army
ftnd the navy) are called upon to de
fend our country, you will do it with
mutual helpfulness and comrade
ship." â¢ \~~v- ;

was mostly an expression . of confi
dence that, in the event of war, the

painted -black, their .war color.
, Special dispatches from various cor
respondents in Japan, received this

Russia's reply to the proposals of Jap
an will not be permitted to leak out
in the latter country.- The Daily Mail's
Tokio correspondent believes the reply
to be of a satisfactory nature and that
an amicable settlement of 'the existing
differences is In sight. The correspond
ent adds:
'.'As far as I can ascertain Russia
has made certain concessions to Japan
concerning Manchuria and is willing
to recognize Japan's supremacy In Ko
rea. The relaxation of the tension is
shown by the distinctly sanguine feel
ing on the stock markets. Contrary to
what might have been expect'ed, the
effect in business circles of the disso

During the week ended December IS
fourteen thousand tons of. coal were
sent from Japan to Port Artftir.
Doubtless if the Japanese Government

means to prevent these shipments. The
Premier has received an imperial man

Sl*eiaJ Dispatch to The Call
Two Colombian cruisers at Cartagena
âthe Ccrtagena and. the General Pin
zon â took the party up coast toward
Atrato River and landed it at the near
est point possible to the Panama bor
der, but the troops were unable to even
reach the river.
The inhabitants of Cartagena and
Barranquilla were opposed to the at
tempted invasion, and now that it has
proved, a decided failure, they refuse
to co-operate in any way with the sol
diers at those points.
Further military operations on the
Atrato River are not proOabl* now that
the failure of the Tiradores is known.
It is reported that a large number of
troops from the interior of Colombia,
Â¦which had started on the march to Bar
ranquilla in the hope that the Tiradores
would be successful in cutting a road
over the mountains, have been recalled
to Bogota. This military movement, it
is believed on the isthmus, will be the
only attempt by force that Colombia
will make against Panama.
XO FURTHER O PER ATTOXS.
PANAMA. Dec. 13.â A correspondent
at Colon telegraphs news of the Com
plete failure of the attempt made by
Colombian troops to reach the isthmus.
Informafion was brought by the French
steamer Fournel, which arrived yester
day from Cartagena and Barranquilla.
From a reliable source it is learned
that the much-talked-of Colombian in
vasion has been greatly exaggerated.
About 400 veteran soldiers, known as
the Battalion Tiradores, under the com
mand of General Filostrat of Mar
tinique, attempted to open roads across
the mountain ranges on the way to
Atrato River. After a few days of
forced marching through -swamps, a
large number jot soldiers died from ex
posure and exhaustion. To add to the
misery of the invaders, their provisions
became exhausted and the Colombians
were forced to return to Cartagena.
Nothing was accomplished by the ex
pedition and no surveys were attempt
ed. The Tiradores realized the hope
lessness of their task and wfre glad to
return.

Just what caused the accident is a
mystery. As soon as, the engineer no
ticed there was something wrong he
applied the airbrakes, but was unable
to stop the train. Five cars were com
pletely burned and the remainder of
the coaches badly damaged.
The work of rescue was carried on
with difficulty, as the cars took fire
immediately after the accident and the
bridge is a high one. The injured were
taken to Albia and Ottumwa.
Mildred Mitchen, the S-year-old
child of Mrs. W. E. Mitchen, was hung
to one of the , bridge girders and
burned to death "before the "eyes of the
uninjured passengers and trainmen.
When the train was derailed just be
fore reaching the bridge, the sides of
the cars struck the bridge and were
torn out. The live coals from the
stove were scattered throughout the
cars. The Mitchen child fell through
the bottom of the car, its clothes
catching to the girder, when it cried
loudly for its mother, who had been
instantly killed in the wreck. The
cars and the bridge in a few seconds
were a mass of flames and the child
was burned to a crisp before aid could
reach it.
The injured: W. P. Martin. Chicago;

A member of the family's entourage
says the Comtesse was fond of daring
feats of horsemanship and liked to
drive tally-ho drags and four-in-hand.
She found that male attire attracted
less attention when driving, and when
thus attired she was one of the most
daring drives on the avenue.
The family has a chateau at Nerae,
In the department of Lot et Garonne,
where the peasants were familiar with
the Comtesse's strange costume 'and
daring. ,
The latter was removed to a hospital.
There the patient was placed in the
male ward and doctors were preparing
for an oDcration when they found the
Injured person to be a woman. She was
removed to the female ward and was
identified as the daughter of Comte
Ogier d'lvry. An examination showed
that her skull was fractured in three
places, and she died soon afterward.
The Comtesse was 20 years old. Her
blonde hair was cut short, and it is ex
plained that she was in the habit of as
suming male attire in the streets to
avoid attracting the attention of men.
The D'lvry family is highly connect
ed.' The'Comte is a retired army officer
and the author of a number of poetical
works, including "Rhymes of the Cape
and Sword."

Ss*cial Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
Upon their demand being refused
they held ah indignation* meeting
and again waited upon William Bol
lons, tthe roadmaster of -the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company.
He again refused to give them trans
portation,^ and the infuriated Greeks
chased him and two tilnor officials
more than a mile into town. - During
the chase nineteen shots, were fired at
Bollpn8, but none hit him. .. The fare
to Portland is $3.
It develODed to-night that Bollons,
whUe fleeing from .the enraged Greeks,
returned , their pistol fire and seriously
wounded two of them. The injured

Bollons will not talk about the affair

LA GRANDE, Ore., Dec. 13.â When
150 Greek laborers who. have been re
pairing the Oregon Railroad and Nav
igation tracks near here found that
theyv were expected to pay their own
railroad fare back to Portland there
was a riot.
The Greeks were brought here- a
short time ago by the corporation and
on the completion 'of the work yester
day were paid off. The men then de
manded free transportation back to
Portland, whence they came, alleging
that .they had been promised tickets

Ross has been an inmate of the con
demned cell for nearly four years and
at seven different times has occupied
a bunk in the death chamber. Hi3

many times, as well as reviewed by
the State Supreme Court several times-
New trials have been granted, stays
of execution ordered, and even the
United States Supreme Court has
passed on a technicality in the plead
ing.
Through it all Ross has maintained
a stolid demeanor, has thrived on
prison diet, and at all times asserted
he would never die on the gallows. The
final decision has been at last obtained.
There are no more tribunals to appeal
to and unless Governor Pardee inter
feres this week will be the murderer's
last on earth.
Ross himself realizes the fact. His
nonchalant air has been discarded and
in its place one of extreme repentance
has been assumed. Â» He occupies the
death chamber in which Theodore Dur
rant was incarcerated. Guards D.
Kelly and B. Merrltt have been as
signed the duties of death watch. They
assert that Ross occupies his time in
praying and weeping. He does not
deny the fact that he committed the
deed which ended the life of a Deputy
Sheriff, but claims that ho struck the
officer on the head with a bottle sim

Paymaster Geperal Harris, chief of
the bureau of supplies and accounts,
has made application to the Secretary
of the Navy for three horses, which he
states are required in the performance
of official duties. The Secretary has re
ferred the question to the . Controller
of the Treasuryt who evades a positive
decision by. saying that an officer may
keep one horse or more, according to'
bis rank, at Government expense, pro
vided his official duties require the use
of the animals, and leaves it to the Sec
retary to decide the paymaster gen
eral's need of three horses. The claim
is .made under the navy, personnel. law
of. March 3, 1299, which gives army, pay
and allowances; to, .naval officers. Sec-r
tion-i3-.fif,ttio;a<jt'hafifA)Qen the subject
of much contention and litigation, and
has kept the Controller and the courts
busy, and the end is not yet.. The par
ticular section reads:. "Commissioned,
officers of the line of the navy and of
the medical and pay corps shall receive
the â¢ same pay and allowances, except
forage, as are or may be provided ..by
or in pursuance of. law for the officers
of corresponding rank in the army. 1 *
As Paymaster General Harris has the
rank of rear admiral, which corre
sponds with that of brigadier general
in the army, it would seem that he is
entitled to the pay and allowances, in
cluding horses, but not to the forage.
Inasmuch as army officers in Washing
ton acting as chiefs of bureaus have
allowances as mounted officers, Rear
Admiral and" Paymaster General Har
ris, as chief of the bureau of supplies
and accounts, is also to be considered
as a mounted officer and entitled to the
three" horses at Government expense,
but he must bear the cost of their feed.
There are five more rear admirals in
Washington who are chiefs of bureaus
who would be entitled to horses, besides
those who have retired since July, 1899,
the 61aims of which will undoubtedly
be presented and admitted in due
course of time. The chiefs of the bu
reaus of yards and docks and of con
struction, although ranking with rear
admirals, are not included as mounted

TRAINING NAVAI/ ENGINEERS/ j
The naval board appointed V>.'-to : : de/;
vjsfi a system of education and train
ing ot commissioned officers forJ,J;;â¬n
glne room duty is said to have formu
lated a plan which is shortly to be
submitted to the Navy Department-
It provides for the selection of \suclv
ensigns who after two years' -service*
at. sea show_personal inclination arid
fitness for the engineeringrjbranch.
These officers are then to be." sent to
the engineering school to 'be estab
lished at Annapolis, and. after a two
or three years' course shall be consid
ered as eligible to^engineering duties
only. This distinction is to be indicated
In the naval register by some mark
against the name of the officers- se
lected for this exclusive 'task.. This
plan is not likely to. be favorably re'
ceived, for it is simply a return, â¢ thinly
disguised, to the conditions of six years
ago, when there was a separate en
gineer corps. Then at least induce
ments were held out in higher pay to
engineer officers' in some of the grades
of' corresponding relative rank with
line officers. The latter then objected,
to this discrimination and the extinc
tion of the engineer corps followed as
a result of the personnel act 1 of
the engineers being absorbed by the
line. . The pay was- equalized and mean-'
ingless titles conferred on the former
engineers. It waa one of the greatest,
blunders in naval legislation through
which a -comparatively small number
received Individual benefit at theVrisk
of impairing the efficiency of the ser
vice. As the Army and Navy Regis
ter tersely states it: "There must be,
sooner or later, a return to an engin
eer corps; - at all events, there; must. be
provision. Tor engineer officers, with or
without corps organization and inde
pendence. ..'?' * â¢ Theglamorous spec

On the subject of natibnaj parks the
report says that travel through Yo
semite National Park has been consid
erably greater during 1903 than In any
previous year. The superintendent re
ports that the fact that toll Is de
manded of the ordinary visitor on all
the roads now In use which lead
through the park tor the Tosemlte Val

YOSEMITE PARK. AFFAIRS.
Further experience In the administration of
Oil* law confirms the opinion heretofore ex
pressed as to the necessity for remedial legis
lation and causes me to renew wMh earnestness
the recommendations above mentioned on this
sutject. â¢ - - â¢
The reports of special agents detailed for
that work are now being received by the Gen
eral Land Office and this department and such
action taken thereon as the facts appear to
warrant. Where the entries are shown to be
bona fide In character and covered by the letter
and tpirlt of the act they are promptly pawed
to patent. .. Where â¢ It -appears that they have
been made for speculative purposes or In the
Interest* of some person or persons other than
the etittyToen. a hearing is ordered, and the
entrymftu cited to show cause, why the entry
should not be cancelled.
Notwithstanding the extreme care exercised
by this department to protect the public tim
bered lands from unlawful acquisition under
this act . the entries thereunder have, â¢ neve>
thtlefg. as t tatf-d, increased vastly in number., .
The act, when legitimately observed and fol
lowed, affords such facilities for the acquisi
tion by individuals and corporations of vast
bodies of the public timbered lands that it is
one of the greatest menaces on the statute
books to-day against the avowed policy of the
Government to preserve the remaining public
lands for homes for actual settlers.
In the. fall of 1902 reports of irregularities
In the making of entries under this act" on the
Pacific Coast were so numerous and persistent;
that on November 18 of that year I directed
the Commissioner of the General Land Office
to suspend action on all entries made under
eald act In the La Grande. Lakeview, Oregon
Ctty and The Dalles land offices In Oregon; the
Eureka, Kedding and Sacramento offices in
California and the Seattle and Vancouver of
fi#?s in Washington until proper Investigation
thereof could be made and- their bona fides
determined.
Information has . leo been received of the
conviction by the Federal Court in the Northern
District of California of three persons for sub
ornation of perjury In connection with the en
try of land under the timber and stone act.
Th-?se convictions. It Is alleged, are the first of
their kind for fifteen years in that section, and
it Is believed they will have a wholesome moral
effect toward stopping fraudulent transactions
of this character. At any rate It is the pur
pose of the department to pursue with unflag
ging zeal until justice is meted out to them,
all persons shown to have committed frauds
against the Government by unlawfully acquir
ing any cortion-of the _publlq domain.
SPECULATORS IX CONSPIRACY.
' Nearly & year ago Information reached the
department which strongly indicated that
freuds of a serious nature had been and were
being perpetrated against the Government under
what is known as the forest reserve lieu land
act of Jur.e 4. 1837, by a combination of land
speculators on the Pacific Coast. ...The informa
tion and indicated frauds were of so grave a
character that I at once directed a thorough
investigation to be made. This Investigation
wss commenced last January and has been
conducted by those having charge of the actual
work witn great care and with all possible
expedition consistent with thoroughness. The
Investigation has proceeded step by step with
out Intermission under my personal direction,
and every clew to wrongdoing has been quietly
followed to Its eource, with the result that It Is
the confident belief of those in charge of the
Inquiry that the guilty parties will be appre
hended and speedily brought to justice.
It has been my determination from the begin
ning that the matter should be probed to the
bottom regarflle&s of the apparent Influential
character of some of the men involved, and the
inquiry has been conducted throughout along
these lines. The work is now nearingr comple
tion and the whole matter will at an early date
be in shape for definite and appropriate action
aicalr.ct the offenders. ' ' '
While several hundred thousand acres of
public lands are Involved in the Illegal trans
actions brought to light, the number of acres
to which patents have been obtained by the
perpetrators of the frauds Is comparatively
small. The statements widely circulated to
the effect that five United States Senators and
a large number of Representatives were im
plicated, and that the lands Â»nYÂ°'y e< iwould
reach In value $15,000,000 or $20,000,000, are
without foundation In fact. "
During the fiscal year ended June 30. 1902.
there were 4022 entries under the timber and
stone act embracing M5.253.08 acres, while
during the last fiscal year there were 12.24U
such entries, embracing 1,763.222.43 acres, an
Increase over the previous year of 8227 entries
and 1.219.968.45 acres. The Increase In the
activity of this class of entries affords food for
eerlous. reflection.
SUSPENDS ACTION ON ENTRIES.
It is alleged that several hundred entries and
final proofs were made before this Commission
er, all of which have been or are being ex
amined by officers of this department. Suits
have been brought In a number of instances in
the Federal courts to vacate patents and to re-
Etore to the public domain the lands acquired
by these alleged fictitious entrymen.
An average of nrty-eigM special agents of the
General Land Oflic* wtre employed during the
year in investigating . alleged fraudulent land
entries and otherwise protecting tne public
lands from timber treepaes or Illegal appro
priation. Entrfes to the number oi 7031, In
which traud was charged, were relerred to these
special agents tor investigation, 1257 were held
lor cancellation or eurpenaed on special agents'
reports, and in 4U cases hearings were ordered,
955 entries were cancelled. tSW were examined
and found free from fraud, leaving 16,311 cases
pending. on July 1. 1003. â¢Â¦ .
During the past year there have bsen indicted
and arrested in the State of Oregon,' charged
with forgery and conspiracy to-detraud the
Government, a United States Commissioner and
three others, the first being a woman. The
L'nlted States Commissioner has bees removed
iron: her office and all are awaiting trial by tht
ccurt.
On the subject of protection of pub
lic lands the report says:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â In his an
nual report Secretary Hitchcock of
the Interior Department says that in
accordance- wij,h the act of Congress
providing for the construction of irrl
gatiod.. jyorks for fhe reclamation of
arid and semi-arid lands in the West
ern States, a reclamation service was
organized, . surveys, made and various
projects considered. : â¢ Â¦
'Â¦A contract has. been let for the con
struction of diversion works in the
Truckee River, Nevada, and also of a
canal to carry- waters to a reservoir
on the Carson River. \ Investigations
in connection with ' other projects are
rapidly approaching the point where
contracts can be let for their construc
tion.
Two additional forest reservations
have, been established and. two have
been slightly reduced in area.
At the close of the fiscal year, it was
estimated, ' there " were in California
36,965,530 acres of land unappropriated
and unreserved, while \ 19,718,027 acres
were reserveji and 13,286,363 acres ap
propriated.

Two concrete drydocks begun less than

five . feet. Each, dock is 574 feet in
length, with an entrance of -98 feet and.
with twenty-flve to forty. feet depth of
water over the side, according to the

gineering difficulty was experienced in
the construction, as the docks are built
for two-thirds of their length in deep
water, no piling being used, and the
structure rests directly on the clay sub
soil. As the great depth, from forty
to seventy feet below water level, made
it impossible to use v any , method of
cdpperdam construction, recourse was
had to the pneumatic process, using a
suspended caisson. The completion of
this work will give the Kiel dockyard

been in town for the last two days talk
ing over the bill with Senators and Rep

that the bill would pass the Senate as
it came from the House and that there

In submitting his annual library re

follows:
EJuration Is the remedy against Ignoranc*
and bigotry and mental narrowness and per
verse evil doing. Hut it would be a greax mis
take to imagine that education Is the pecullar
herltage of this age; it Is the aspiration of the
human heart. The question of education In
school, college or library U the great question
before the world to-day.
It Is not the millions of people that will makÂ»
our country â It Is not the number of bushel j
of wheat which we export, the factories and the
other Industries that are growing up In our
land that wilt make or us p. nation: It Is not
to the?e that we are to confldÂ» our country, but
the question Is: .What kind of men and women
are we "able to put forth? What kind of a
civilization Is to lie ours? What kind of minds
are to be those of our citizens? Then the ques
tion is. How shall. we instruct those to whom
we look as the norie for the future of- society?
The election then took place, with the
following results: Prefect, James R.

Belen, N. M*., is not the only point
along the line where the Santa Fe in
tends shortening Its mileage, Besides
that notable cut-off there will be an
other and a longer one. This, accord
ing to "reports, will leave the present
main line at Holbrc-ok; Arizona, and
run southwesterly through the Bill
Williams fork of the Colorado River
country, spanning the latter In the vi
cinity of Parker. Thence the route will
be northeasterly, direct across the des
ert of Cadiz, in San Bernardino County.
The last named- cut-off is intended to
be the main line of the Santa Fe and
will be surveyed and built for the ex
press purpose of cutting down the time
between the Pacific Coast and the East
and incidentally will open a new and
rich mineral and agricultural district.
The cut-off will avoid the running
through the numerous mountain ranges
of Northern Arizona, which the present
line of the Santa Fe traverses. The
great Kingman grade and San Fran
cisco mountain grade will be things
of the past, for the through trains arid
also the heavy grade and wide detour
just west of Needles will be avoided.
When President E. P. Ripley was in
the West a few weeks ago. with Divis
ion Superintendent Denalr of Needles
and General Manager. Wells, he went
off on a mining inspection trip. At least
that was the statement given out by
the officers. But It is said that their
real destination was the country which
the new route will traverse, and it Is
further alleged that they laid out some
desidable town site. For months sev
eral gangs of surveyors have been at
â¢work In the neighborhood of the pro
posed route ar.d there is little doubt
that the suspicion of work upon the
Beleri cut-off was due to the company's
subsequent discussion of the advisabil
ity to make the second great cut-off.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 13.â From
what may be considered authorized
sources comes the statement that the
Santa Fe company is preparing to con
struct one of the longest series of cut
offs ever known in the history of West
ern railroading. When completed it
will cut many towns off the present
main line ar.d traverse that' which Is
now isolated country.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Two men were arrested. One had a
bullet wound In the shoulder, believed
to have been received in the fight with
Especiale. . ~ - , . .
Vengeance^ planned with summary
deadliness in the Mafia way that is be r
coming only too familiar, was undoubt
edly back of the murder." Silence was
maintained to-day by the secret service
bureau as to whether Especiale had
been in its employ and had died a mar
tyr to duty. But here are the significant
facts: Especiale made his appearance
In the Italian colony in lower Fulton
street about a year ago. Two months
later the United States authorities raid
ed a counterfeiters' den at 60 Main
street. It was there that Especiale
lived. With others he was arrested, but
a little later he went free. The others
are serving long prison terms.
It' is believed that the criminals still
free, ' with whom he had been asso
ciating, discovered that he was a secret
agent of United States detectives. Ht
knew this, for he had prepared for
flight. It was learned to-day that he
had purchased a ticket for Naples, had
packed all of . his belongings and had
contemplated leaving the country next
Tuesday. Instead, with a bullet In his
breast, his body lies ln^the Brooklyn
Morgue. .. . .- ; -
NEW YORK,. Dec. 13.â Another start
ling Mafia murder, now believed to be
the tragic sequel to the ghastly barrel
murder mystery, has occurred in Brook
lyn. The victim was Salvator Especiale.
a refined and cultured man, supposed
to have been a secret agent of the Gov
ernment working to detect counterfeit
ers. The scene of the crime was in
front of what had been a counterfeiters'
den at Main and York streets. It is
within a few blocks of the scene of two
other murders. Not far away is the
dingy saloon in Navy street where
Nicholas Parella, with a threat of death
from the black hand hanging over him,
was last seen alive.

"Foxy Grandpa" is a musical comedy
scintillating with bright specialties and
an endless chain of mirth and action.
From beginning to finish its theme is
refreshing, and those that went early
enougn last rtight to secure seats at the
California pronounced it a "winner"
and all that the term implies. William
A. Brady presents the production, with
Joseph Hart and Carrie de Mar as
stars. 'What the audience expected of
the title role it found in Hart's imper
sonation, and Miss de Mar as a protege
cf the wily grandparent furnished a
character new and pleasing to the pop
ular idea of the funny artist's creation.
The comedy is a vehicle for much of
the musical order and for an abund
ance of clever work. Still, a distinct
plot may be followed throughout, in
which there are intricate situations and
a happy ending. Foxy Grandpa is des
ignated as Goodleby Goodman, a man
who believes that boys will be boys.
The boys are Chub and Bunt, two
youngsters known out of the realm of
playdom a* Harry Pilcer and Bobby
Harrington. Of them too much cannot
be said. Both have remarkably strong
voices, are vivacious and ably_ support
Hart. They perform the tricks which
usually return as a boomerang and add
a marked life to the piece. Miss de Mar
as Polly Bright is fetching and has the
ttjdtence for her own. She is the center

year and expressed her deep gratitude
for the able and thoughtful assistance
given her by the Rev.' Father' Caraher;
the spiritual adviser of the sodality, and
her associates of the "organization.
j The election of officers for the ensu
ing year resulted as follows:
Father Caraher spoke of the dogma of
the immaculate conception and the
manner in which it was believed. In. for
many ages by the Catholics, and said
It was only defined as a' dogma in the
middle of the last century by Pius IX.
After, the instruction by Father Cara

of the.exerclses in the church the sodal
ity adjourned to the prettily decorated
hall, where a banquet was served by
the sisters.
I warn you ngalnust reading bad boolcs, for
such productions of the press are to the eoul
what *tryehnlne is to the body. I warn you
against evil companionship and company that Is
suspicious. Ilnnemoer. my young friends, that
the company of a young woman may -be her
salvation or her ruin. â¢ I therefore . exhort you
to foster and possess those traits that, shall
stamp you with nobility of character that you
may be honest to the last degree and In every
sense be truthful' and scorn anything that is
base. Furthermore you should be loyal to your
church and to your priest.
FOUM GUARD ROUND CHURCH.
As the King of England has his life guards
and the King of Italy his body gunrd. so should
the. Children of Mary form a guard round their
church and their priest. I . exhort you then
to emulate' the virtues of the Blessed Virgin
and thu* ennoble yourselves In this life and be
prepared for the hereafter.
With 1 -- earnest vigor Father Caraher
appealed *o Jils Juvenile congre-atlon* to
look to the; highest and cultivate the
most beautiful .ideals. Besides warnl.ng
his hearers against attending theaters
on a Sunday and going to Sunday ex
cuslons and picnics, Father Caraher
said:
"My young friends,; I warn you, be
ware of the companions you make, and
I warn you against .attending Sunday
excursions and picnics, and* V beg you
also to abstain from going to the thea
ters on a Sunday." Thus exhorted the
Rev. Father Terence Caraher when ad
dressing a number of young girls at
St. Francis Church yesterday.
The occasion was the twenty-flrst an
nual reception and consecration of. the
Sodality of the Children of Mary of St.
Francis parish. There was a large at
tendance, and the members of the order
listened attentively to the address of
the reverend father.
Joan Hadenfeldt. a statuesque* so
ciety girl of this city, made her debut
at the Orpheum yesterday in the "Cy
cle of Love." She calls it the "musi
cal art maze, reproducing the most
celebrated masterpieces of the world's
famous painterr." The production is
a magnificent one. and the clever San
Franciscan deserves groat credit fur
evolving it. The four seasons of love
arc portrayed by models. It is a liv
ing picture scheme and is charming.
The audience never loses sight of Misa
Hadenfeldt, as she is in the foreground
in beautiful costumes and singing mel
odies that are In harmony with the
pictures. Miss Hadenfeldfs voice, al
though very pleasing to the ear, is not
Ktrong enough to fill the big v play
house. She. was a trifle nervous yes
terday, and with more experience will
do much better. She possesses charm
of manner and has a fine stage pres
ence. Her act 5s a feature, of this
v/eek's very excellent programme, and
at both performances , yesterday she
received, merited applause. . it lias been
many a day since the Orpheum, has put
on Â«uch an expensive , turn. ..The, light
effects are beautiful and the scenery

Â¦ The women of the company, while not
as clever as the masculine contingent,
were, nevertheless, good In their fine.
Mabel Brownell, in the leading role of
Flora Campbell, acted the emotional
parts with a deal of feeling and showed
that she is adapted to the character she
portrayed. Adelie CummJng, Helen
Holmes and the two children of the
p!ay, George Clarke and Queenle Phil
lips, all came in for their share of the
applause.
Stoddard, of course, was the shining
light as Lachlan Campbell, yet many
of his supporters were conspicuous by
their clever acting. Reuben Fax. In
the role Archibald McKittrlck. the
postman. Impressed his listeners and
held their attention throughout by his
original wit and his quaJnt. weird way
of expressing himself. George Warnack
as the minister was well fitted for that
role and Robert Ferguson, as Dr. Mc-
Lure. portrayed the character in an
easy, natural manner. Wallace Jack
son, as Thomas Mitchell, made an ideal
simDleton and some of the lilts he had
with Fax were comical Indeed.
"The Bonnie Brier Bush" is all that
could be desired. It has been seen time
and time again in this city, yet it is ever
welcome. The pathetic and the hu
morous incidents and scenes of this
Scottish play were all admirably por
trayed last night by a company of sea
soned actors and actresses. It took
from the start and no one who has
'seen the production can resist the temp
tation of witnessing it once again.
Every one in > the house was bent on
giving a welcome to the great old man
and his reception la$ t night was pos
sibly the most ardent ever tendered him
In this city, and he has had a great
many in his time. He looked the same
and he acted as of yore, and when the
curtain was rung down on the initial
act the enthusiasm of the vast assem
blage knew no bounds. Four times did
the curtain rise, with increasing cheers
at each instance,- till Stoddard was
finally compelled to speak a few words,
telling the audience how glad he was
to be among them in San Francisco
again.
The perfume of Scotland's dewey
heather could all but be detected when
the curtain rose on the first act of "The
Bonnie Brier Bush" at the Grand Op
era-house last night. 'Twas n. scene of
reality, made .even more real whea
that venerable patriarch of the foot
lights, J. H. Stoddard. appeared upon
the stage amid a ripple of genuine ap
plause.
In first scene, an afternoon at the
Green Mineral Hotel, six musical num
bers are rendered. The second scene,
picnic grounds at Lake Hopper, offers
six more, and the last, a barn scene.
gives seven more. The music is by Hart
and the airs are all catchy.
All who are on .the bills are artists.
Eugene Redding as Signor Bolero, who
becomes the double of "grandpa," is
clever, and Maurice Stone, Harry K.
Webster and Frank Matthews consti
tute an excellent Neapolitan trio.
Signorina Colonna is done by Marquita
Dwight, who is an actress of high qr
der and furnishes the perfidy of the
play. George C. Pearce in the role of a
lever has a fine tenor voice, and John
T. Ray executes a good dancing turn.
C. J. Williams takes the part of Foxy
Grandpa's brother, whose effort, in life
seems to be in keeping his kin out of
trouble. There are about twenty others
in the cast and all deserve a share of
applause.
The letter of the King of Spain ac
cepting the present, said Pratt, refers
to the further strengthening of the
union of the two nations by a number
of royal intermarriages. Later docu
ments show the recession of Louis
iana by Spain to France and gives
minute details of the sale by Napoleon
of the province to the United States.
that has not been seen here since Anna
Held appeared with her Sadie girls.
PARIS, Dec. 13.â Under the authority
of M. Delcasse. Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, E. Spencer Pratt, former United
States Minister to Persia, who is now
residing here, is making extensive re
searches in the archives of the Foreign
Office relative to the transfer of the
province of Louisiana by France to
the United States. In speaking of hW
investigations Pratt said:
"One of the most curious documents
found is an autograph letter of Louis
XV, giving away the last Louisiana
territory to his cousin, then King of
Spain, as a present. The fact of this
gift has been known heretofore only
in a general way, but the text of the
letter discloses the casual nature of
the gift, and also. the fact that Louis
XV previously offered Louisiana to
Great Britain, which refused to accept
it."

he said.
His Explanation.
The United States commercial agent
at Vladivostok. Siberia, reports that the
genera! Governor of the Amur has Is
sued an order that no Chinamen, Ko
reans or foreigners shall be employed
In the gold mines of the Amur province
except by special permission in : each
case. Meanwhile th- mining inspector
of the maritime province reports that
the merchant steamers on the Amur
are earning many Chinese and Ko
reans to the Amffoon mines, where the
men wander about in the forests unem
ployed, forroing a menace in case of an
outbreak of cholera. A supplementary
order now forbids all river. steamers to
carry these coolies to the mines, unless
specially contracted for by gold-mining
companies.
And yet Russia is doing all j in Its
power to add a couple of million Chi
nese citizens to its paternal govern

There was a blinding, flash, a sharp,
crackling report, and when Philip Spalt,
the switchboard man of the Oakland
Gas, Light and Heat Company at their
electric plant at the foot of Jefferson
street, recovered consciousness he was
on the opening table of the Receiv
ing Hospital, horribly burned.
Spalt was working at the switchboard
in the regular discharge of his duty,
when he was felled by a shock that al
most cost him his life. How it oc
curred he does not know. He
says that just as he reached for one
of the switches on the board there was
the snapping, crackling sound and the
blinding light of an electric arc flash,
and he knew no more until he found
himself under the care of doctors at the
hospital.
It is believed that Spalfs clothing
was damn from the drizzling rain out
side, and that there muet have, been
moisture on his hands... so that when
lie touched the switch the current sped
through his body. That he ; escaped
death is considered remarkable, for
through this . switchboard Â¦ passes the
heavy current from the . main', line of
the Bay Counties Power, Company from
Colegate, with a register of 45,000 voltg.
-v Spalt had his left arm burned 'to 'the
elbow and his chest and face scorched.
He will be confined to. his home, 677

that Ellis would Immediately take

experienced the coldest weather of the
season to-day, the thermometer rang
ing from forty to twenty-four degrees
below zero at the various stations of
the weather bureau. There is appar
ently no prospect for immediate relief.
OMAHA. Neb.. Dee. 13.â Zero weath

higher temperatures to-morrow.
MILWAUKEE. Dec. 13.â The lowest

coldest day In Chicago for this season
of the year since 1S76. Early this
morning the temperature began to fall
until by 8 a. m. It had reached 13 be
low zero. The only time that this
mark has been reached in the history
of the weather bureau was December

"The truest man in the world Is the
true Christian man, and you need
Christ In order to lead au upright life.
Be a Christian first, and you will have
no trouble to fight the perils that beset
the young men of to-day."
Rev. Dr. Bane then dwelt on the dan
ker of young men leading unclean lives
and using unclean words.. He warned
young men that lust is slaying tens of
thousands, and urged that all should
lead chaste and pure lives and refrain
from the user of unclean language.
, "Don't say of another woman," said
the' speaker, "what you would not like
to hear about your own sister.
"There is nothing so helpful to- a
young man as purity, and nothing com
mends or lifts up or brings us nearer
to God like clean lives. Make up your
minds to have the best of this world
and the world to come.
MUST?. LEAD PURE LIVES.
"Don't think, young women, that you
can reform a drinking man after mar
riage. If he won't give up Intoxicating
drink when he is courting you, he won't
give it up when you are married to
him." }&*h Â¦&':;&
"And to the young women I say,
never marry a man who drinks intoxi
cating liquors. The man who -courts you
and who drinks liquor will . get drunk
after you marry him. Never link your
lives with such men. If he drinks liquor
he does not know "the peril he is in, and
you do not know the peril that menaces
you if you marry such a man. In five
years he may be a common drunkard,
and you -will be a drunkard's wife and
in rags and misery. .
"To the young women I eay that If a
man is courting you and you smell
liquor on his breath, show your woman
hood and tell him that either he must
give up drinking or you will give him
up. If you don't, and you marry such
a man, you will rue the day when you
become a common drunkard's wifeâ the
most pitiful of all objects.
' After dwelling on the peril to young
men who lacked backbone to stand up
for "what is rig-nt and denounce what is
wrong, Rev. . Dr. Bane dwelt upon the
peril of Intoxication. In speaking of
this danger the divine declared that, the
man who first started as a social drink
er became a tippler, and then a drunk
ard. "Intoxicating drink." said Dr.
Bane, "is a poison to life, and It is filled
with drugs that create an appetite for
It. It is an awful peril to the young
men of to-day, for It blasts and ruins
thousands of lives.
The speaker then referred to the peril
of setting up one moral standard in
business and another for religion. He
said that the man who was a thief
and a robber in business and who went
to church was a hypocrite.
DANGER OP INTOXICATION.
The speaker then warned young men
of the danger of becoming secular and
ignoring religious spirit and thought.
He said that the man who gave all his
thoughts to business was but a mere
machine and that it was the duty of
man. to give equal time to God, as. well
as to his work. Continuing his subject.
Rev. Dr. Bane declared that it was not
manly for young men to consider re
ligion as a pastime and that the most
manly act was to never be ashamed
to speak of or to worship God in the
presence of those who did not believe.
Living beyond one's means and going
into debt were pointed out as great
menaces to young men and he said it
was better to live within one's income
and not try to emulate others by ex
travagance.
Another peril pointed out was that of
being light and frivolous and ignoring
thought and seriousness. The speaker
said that the tendency of the age was
to be thoughtless, resulting in lack of
character. Dr. Bane then spoke on the
tendency of young men to* neglect read
ing and the cultivation of tlielr minds
and the rushing of children into busi
ness circles, not for need but for greed
alone.
WARNING TO Y'OUNG/ MEN.
The speaker then dwelt upon the
many advantages possessed by young
men to-day and compared them with
the evils that exist and menace the fu
ture. The young men were warned by
Dr. Bane to beware the spirit cf consid
ering parents as "old fogies" and not
listening to their counsels. Ha declared
that the spirit of self-conceit was to be
deplored and urged all young men to
heed the advice of their parents and
elders.
"Perils That Beset Young Men" was
the theme of a powerful sermon deliv
ered last evening by Rev. A. C. Bane to
a Jarge congregation at the Howard
Street Methodist Episcopal Church at
Howard and Third streets. In speak
ing on the subject. Rev. Dr. Bane said
that the most important attribute of a
young man was character and that it
was the duty of all to help in forming
good character in young men and hin
dering evil influences.
The reverend speaker said that the
future of home, state and church de
pended on the character of the present
generation and that the conduct of a
man at the age of 21 indicated his path
in after life. Rev. Dr. Bane claimed
that the young men of to-day had far
better advantages than were possessed
by their parents and that they should
reach a higher plane in consequence
and should be better and more useful
men.
The revelation. of a. number of gaaes
In the air whose presence had never.be
fore been suspected contributed much
to the fame of Sir William. The first
of these was argon, which he discovered
in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh.
Subsequently he revealed atmospheric
elements which have been named neon,
krypton and Xenon, and, lastly, the 'ele
ment of helium, which in relation with
radium has proved so mysterious and
astonishing.
Sir William Ramsay has. been pro
fessor of chemistry In the University
College. London, since 1887, having pre
viously been in the department of
chemistry at the Glasgow University
from 1874 to 1880. and professor of
chemistry in University College, Bris
tol. He has received the highest scien
tific honors from all parts of the world.
The University of California has se
cured for a lecturer at the next summer
session Sir William Ramsay of London,
the first' chemist in England and who
vies with Dr. Wilhelm Ostwald of Ger
many for the distinction of being called
the greatest chemist. .
Â£ir Wlllliam will come to California in
June next and lecture throughout the
summer session, which will extend from
June 2 to August 7. The theme of his
lectures will be the most important
problem now before the chemists of the
worldâ the phenomena of radio-activity,
which have thrown doubt on so many
of the old \ theories as to the perma
nency of the elements and the essential
nature of matter. There will also be
discussions on the gases of the air, of
which Sir William is the discoverer of a
number. In accepting the invitation of
President Wheeler to the university Sir
William says:
; "At present the subject of radio-ac
tivity Is absorbing my attention. Mr.
Soddy, my coadjutor, and I have al
ready obtained very remarkable results
of what we may regard as transmuta
tionâthe changing of a gas evolved
from radium salts into helium. I think
that as a subject of lectures the ex
ploration of the gases of the atmos
phere . might prove interesting and
novel." .

"We are collecting data for infor
mation." said W. S. Palmer, division
superintendent for the Southern Pa
cific Company, to-day when asked If
the counting of passengers meant
gates. "It is all for the future.
Whether we will charge fares Is a
matter to be determined later."
That there has been a great falling
off in the Southern Pacific's business is
evident from the fact that while the
evening trains used to consist of nine
and ten cars, which were filled with
passengers and "drawn by two engines,
there are now only five cars, with one
engine, and these cars are only half
full. There has. of course, been a cor
responding increase In the traffic of
the new line, whose cars are filled irt
the early morning and evening hours
to their capacity.
' It is a fact that a good many peo
ple impose on the old company by ac
cepting free rides on its trains through
town and then paying on the new line
when they want to go to San Fran
cisco. The only way the old company
can prevent this imposition is to put
on gates and charge fares between sta
tions, Just as its rival does. Still, nonÂ«
of the company's officials will admit
that It is about to do anything radical
and things are going along In pretty
much the same old way.
The crowded cars of the new ferry
line and the yawningr emptiness of its
own has scared the Southern Pacific
Company so that something is sura to
be done very soon to prevent an entira
loss of a formerly good paying 1 busi
ness. That the company contemplates
doing: something Is manifest from tha
fact that its agents have been count
ing the number of passengers who
travel on the Southern Pacific trains
between Lorin and Berryman stations,
apparently for the purpose of ascer
taining how many people ride freÂ«
that distance or part of It every day.

Baj-i He Will Remain Till He Finds
He Is Xo Longer Fit for
Duty.
The report that Captain Andrew J.
Dunlevy of the Harbor Police District
was to retire on a pension was denied
by the captain yesterday. "I have no
intention of retiring," he said, "but,
of course, I don't know what the
Police Commissioners may do. When
I feel that I am no longer fit for duty,
the Chief of Police will be the first
one to learn of my desire for retire
ment."
When an officer has reached the
age of 65 and has served twenty-five
years in the department, the Commis
sioners have the power to retire him
from active duty and place him on
the pension roll if he does not retire
voluntarily.

only to make him fight the harder.
"For a lost cause," many will say.
Possibly so, in our day. Ignorance and
folly are formidable, antagonists. Mr.
Spencer himself prophesied the "com

was deprived of the exultation which
rewards victory, he at least enjoyed a
calm pleasure in the consciousness of
the large share he would have in "the

Summers.
John Fitzgerald, 5312 Mission

yesterday and asked if the body of a
young man about 23 years of age was
in the Morgue. He was assured that
no such body occupied a slab, and he
seemed relieved.
Fitzgerald said that Frank Sum
mers came here from Des Moines, la.,
on December 2 and stopped at the
Winchester Hotel for one night. The
following day Summers called at Fitz
gerald's house and, as the families
were intimately known to each other,
was asked to make his home there as
long as he liked.
Summers remained ther^ till De
cember 7. That morning he left for
the purpose of. seeking employment In
some vinegar works, but did not re
turn. Fitzgerald called at the different
vinegar works in the city, but no one
could recollect of Summers having
applied tor employment. Fitzgerald
suspected that his young friend might
have met with foul play, as he had
$500 in currency in his pocket when
he left his house.

CREATED SOCIOLOGY.
I think it may fairly be said that
Mr. Spencer was tht creator of the
science of sociology. Certainly his con
tributions to the subject far exceed in
value and extent those of any other
man. His well sustained theory of the
origin of religions â¢'-- alone sufficient
to insure him enduring fame as a so
ciologist. This theoiy was first ex
pounded in an essay published in the
Fortnightly Review in 1870, entitled
"Animal Worship." Mr. Spencer there
vigorously combated the doctrine es
poused by Professor Max Muller and
others that the gods of savages are
"personified powers of nature." All re
ligions, Mr. Spencer contends, arose out
of ghost worship.
The shade or spirit of a deceased per
son Is regarded as persisting after
death, which is looked upon as only a
prolonged insensibility: and if the de
ceased had been an important or pow
erful personage in life his spirit was
naturally propitiated in the belief that
when it would "come to," or return to
the body, the revived man would dis
play a friendly feeling toward those
who' had propitiated his wandering
spirit. Hence the practice of embalm
ing the dead or placing their bodies be
yond the reach of devouring animals
by burying them or putting them in
other inaccessible places. Hence, also,
the custom of placing in their graves
implements of warfare, and among
some tribes of burying alive with them,
their wives and dogs. This belief in
the departure and return of the spirit
arose chietiy out of the vivid dreams
to which savages are especially subject.
The worship of material objects Mr.
Spencer shows to be derivative, arising
In various ways out of ghost worship.
Mr. Spencer's ethical doctrines are
set forth in his "Principles of Ethics,"
by which the ' "Synthetic Philosophy"
was brought to a close. Here for the
first time it was demonstrated that
moral obligations have a natural basis.
Mr. Spencer \yas a utilitarian, but not
In the narrow and conventional sense.
He attributed moral intuitions not to
the experiences of the individual, but
of I the whole race, human and sub
human. These vast experiences, ex
tending over millions of , years, Yiave
produced in us moral faculties, with
their appropriate sentiments and ideas;
while innate to the Individual (except
ing such modifications thereof as the
experiences of a single life produce),
they have been acquired by the race.
.'v; :.; PQLITICAIi SERVICE.
But Herbert Spencer's most practical
and possibly greatest service to human
ity . were "rendered in the field of po
litical science. r At the early age of
22 he s published the "Proper Sphere of
Government," \wherein he advanced
Ideas which for sixty years thereafter
he with superb ' ability and
illustrated by multitudinous facts gath
ered by him from every age and clime.
I: I think it , may be Â§ said without ex
aggeration that his contributions to the
science of government far exceed in
merit those: of all other writers com
bined. He was the first to perceive that
growing industrialism necessitates lim-'
itlng and specializing the functions of
government. "He was the most'enllght
ened and vigorous opponent' of hydra
headed socialism and paternalism : the
world has ever known.' "There is no

jrrown, and so diversified its interests,
that it segregated itself into three de

the smaller bodies to effect the remark- <

mission is essentially to dispel
sorrow â it is needless to say they find
much to keep them busy. They com
prise the Doctor's Daughters, the aux
iliaries to the various hospitals, and,
last but not least, the blessed little
Alden Club, whose annals illustrate the
potency of little tokens and cheery
Â¦words to lift the burdens of the heavy
laden.
With all these vital things to talk
about, do you wonder that the knell
of the gossip has rung? Of course men,
The women's clubs have never before
been so busy as at the present hour.
"Busy at t\ hat?" asks the cynic. "Gath
vring gossip?" Deluded sir. could you
but drop into a few clubrooms on their
busy days you would be enlightened
upen that score â that is, if you be of
the type of man that light enlightens.
While it is true that a few "knockers"
are to be found in women's clubs, even
as in your own, you will find the cheer
ful "booster" largely predominating.
Nor are the reasons therefor hard to
run down. The desire for popularity
produceth many reformations, and
since the "booster" is better companyâ
infinitely more cheerful and agreeable â
it is â¢wiser as well as nobler to enlist
under the "boosters' " banner. Thus
is the club gossip quite an extinct ani
mal â and here's to her paEFing. May
Â£he rest in peace: And let us hope that
the society gossip may soon follow in
her winged flight. Since a goodly part
of "society" is connected with clubdom,
it is not a vain hope that the gossip
will some day be eliminated from the
smart set as a violator of the precepts
of '"good form."
But the reason of reasonsâ the pre
eminent cause of the passing of the
gossip â is the fact that the clubs, from
their different careers, offer so many in
teresting topics for thought and speech.
There is the literary cIud, wherein the
social feature figures prominently, such
M the Press. Laurel Hall. Irving, Con
temporary. Mills, Clionian, Wimsdau
sis. Corona. Century, Sorosis. Forum
and the Philomath. Then there are
those wherein the matter of birth
briugrs the club into being. These or
ganizations commingle historic interests
with social pleasures, and of these we
have the Colonial Dames, the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution, the
Pioneer Daughters, Daughters of the
Confederacy, and closely allied to them
are the Pioneer- Women, they who came
to California prior to '53, and the aux
iliary of Pioneer Women, composed of
the wives of pioneers, those hardy old
Argonauts who builded much better
than they knew.
GERMAXTA CLUB OBSERVES t
THIRTIETH AX.VI VERSARY
And thus are the club women busy â
busier than ever before, bringing com
fort and sunshine into the byways and
highways.
On December 30 the Social Science
Section of the California Club, pre
sided over by Mrs. Jacob Brandt, is
making active preparations for a
Christmas party for the inmates of
the City and County Hospital. There
are 400 unfortunates, ill, and, for the
most part, friendless. Somewhere,
lurking in the shadows of every hu
man heart, is a longing for the pleas
ures of Yuletide, with- its song and
jest and good cheer. To add Just a
little pleasure to the sufferers is what
the women of the social science sec
tion are planning to do. And therein
lies a deep, dark secret. A gramo
phone was borrowed to furnish music
and other diversions for the occasion,
but Mrs. Arthur " Cornwall, the bor
rowee, has Just informed the club that
the machine need not be returned,
that a dear man had given it out of
the goodness of his heart. And so.
after the ladies have gone, and the
usual lonesome silence hangs brooding
over the wards, the captured voice
may beguile the long,^ gray hours
away â the doctor willing, and the
nurse.
The Irving Club, though scarcely
out of its swaddling clothes, has had
a most remarkable careerâ for a baby.
Last year, under the presidency of its
founder, Mrs. Ella Seaton Tuttle, a
pabulum of lectures was administered,
upon which it thrived famously, and
no wonden, for Miss Fairbrother de
livered them. This year, under J.he
guidance of Mrs. Bauer, the Irving
has grown proportionately and cards
to its "days" are much appreciated.
The Forum Club will' gather round
the wassail bowl on the eve of the
New Year. Rtght merrily will ; the
members toast the coming year and
bid adieux to the cares that infest the
day.
At the reception of last week the
club achieved a Social triumph and
many stunning women stood in the
receiving party, at the head of which
was Mrs. Henry Payot.
* * . *
That -was a remarkable gathering
at Golden Gate Hall on Thursday
when the Pioneer Women held a re
ception in honor of the fiftieth anni
versary of their arrival in California.
Debonair old ' ladies, and sprightly
younger ones, curled and primped,
daintily bonneted and gowned, stood
In the receiving line, led by Mrs. Mc-
Intyre, the president, and it was a
far cry back to the days of '49, or even
to tamer '53, when these women in
the flush of vigorous womanhood
stepped out from a rowboat at Mont
gomery and Clay streets, or as glee
ful children scampered up the sandy
slopes to investigate the wilderness
they had traveled so far to find.
While a fine programme of the cus
tomary kind was thoroughly enjoyed,
it was the stories told by Mrs. Scoffy,
an aged member, that filled our hearts
with joy. Alas! Alas! What has be

This segregation of the juvenile of
fenders (and in many cases it's the
parents that are the true offenders)
from the criminal class was the monu
mental work of the California Club,
led by Dr. Dorothea Moore, and also
of men to whom the rights of children
make a strong appeal. A pioneer in this
cause was Fairfax Wheelan, who with
others, pressed hard wpon the con
sciences of the legislators of the last
stssion, and lo! the court came forth.

that the duties fell to Judge Murasky,

Herbert Spencer's contributions to
biological science were many and of
the highest order. Mr. Darwin speaks
of the wonderful prodigality of sug
gestion exhibited in Spencer's "Princi
ples of Biology." In his "Factors of
Organic Evolution" and in his contro
versy with Professor Weismann Mr.
Spencer demonstrated the inadequacy
of the principle of "natural selection"
as the sole cause of organic evolution,
and showed the part played by other
important factors ce-operating with it.
His theory v of physiological (or consti
tutional) units the late Grant Allen, a
naturalist of distinction, characterized
as a "magnificent all sided conception
built up by an acute and subtle analyt
ical perception of all the analogous
facts in universal nature." His theory
of the origin of the vertebrate struc
ture has now been largely accepted by
biologists, and he also contributed a.
valuable, speculation concerning the
genesis of the annulose type of ani
mals. As an incident to his controvery
with Weismann upon the relative im
portance of the several factors of or
ganic evolution, he solved the difficult
problem of the evolution of the social
hymenoptera, a problem which, as Mr.
Darwin : himself confessed, seemed to
Probably Mr. Spencer's greatest
achievement in special work was the
production, at the early age of 35, of
his "Principles of Psychology." That
profound and. original treatise, pub
lished in 1855, four years before the
appearance of Mr. Darwin's "Origin of
Species" ; and afterward incorporated
in the "Synthetic Philosophy," as
sumed as the basis of its deductions
the' truth of the "development hypo
thesis," which, three years before, Mr.
Spencer had championed in an essay
in which he set forth the argument
in favor of organic evolution with re
markable force and clearness. Space
does not permit the enumeration of
the ready solutions furnished by Mr.
Spencer in his "Principles of Psychol
ogy" of many theretofore insoluble
problems. "Without"" special training
for the undertaking, with scant knowl
edge of the writings of the recognized
masters in metaphysical discussion,
the young philosopher, by the sole aid
of his luminous intellect, penetrated
the . mist of obscurity involving the
operations of the mind and traced
them from their genesis upward along
the various branches of their evolu
tion. He put an end at once and for
ever to the war which had been waged
for a thousand years between the in
tuitionists and those who contended
that all knowledge was derived from
experience by pointing out that the so
called innate ideas were, while a priori
to the individual, a posteriori to the
race. He easily exposed the fallacies
of both the realists and idealists, and
taking a moiety of truth from each he
constructed his own profound theory
of "transfigured realism." which com
pletely harmonized the facts.
AS A BIOLOGIST.
This law was first revealed to Her
bert Spencer, and he also was the first
to perceive its universal' operation. He
has shown- that the transformations
induced by the law of evolution are ex
hibited in the universe as a whole, in
its details in the planetary system. An
the earth as an inorganic mass, in each
organism, in the aggregate of or
ganisms throughout geologic time, in
the mind, in society and in all the pro
ducts of social activity. This splendid
conception the great thinker sustained
by a wonderful- wealth of illustration
drawn from phenomena ranging, from a
microscopic speck of protoplasm to
measureless nebulae, swirling' through
space. The credit ;' of : this wohierful
discovery is wholly due to Mr: Spencer,
and the current bestowal of "it upon
Charles Darwin is' an enormous and
unpardonable error. Nor did that dis
tinguished naturalist ever make the
slightest claim to the unearned honor
which a provoking perversity thrust
upon him. Indeed, he expressly admit
ted in a letter written to Professor
John Fiske in 1874 that "with the ex
ception of special points" he "did not
even understand H. Spencer's general
doctrine."
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT.
. It is impossible in a brief space to set
forth adequately the achievements of
Herbert Spencer in the intellectual
world.' A fairly clear statement, how
ever, of the most noteworthy of these
may .be, attempted. His greatest
achievement was. of course, the discov
ery and exposition of the principle of
evolution. Others had perceived the op
eration and results of this principle in
special fieldsâ Kant and Laplace in the
sidereal system . and Erasmus and
Charles Darwin and Lamarck in the
biological world; but their discoveries,
profound and Important as they were,
failed to disclose to them the funda
mental law to which the subjects, of
their investigations conformed. .

THE Stockton Independent editorially arrays facts
relative to the transformation of Stanislaus County
through irrigation that must' be interesting to\the
people of the State at large. It says: "The' transforma
tion effected by the introduction of irrigating canals into
sections that have been devoted exclusively to grain
farming is well illustrated -by Stanislaus County, where
a boom is on that is amazing not only to old residents
of the county."
Among the^ particular facts cited by the Independent in
support of its assertion are several relating to recent
Sales of realty, and these probably afford a safe way for
forming a judgment as to the appreciation in which Stan
islaus County lands are now held.
"Yesterday," says the Independent, Â¦ "the Modesto
papers recorded the sale of a tract of land near Ceres, at
$150 an acre, the purchaser being a newcomer from one
of the Middle Western States. Many sales are recorded
every day and most of, the transactions are for small par
cels of land,, from ten to fifty, acres eachi at- prices. from
$40 to $100 per acre, according to location and the im
provements made' with irrigation"- in' view. A few years
ago any of the Stanislaus lands'-that now bring from -$40
to $100 per acre could be bought ,in any desired quanti

DOUBTJ r ESS a good many people will remember
the pretty joke undertaken by%6mc festive voters
in the good town of Amesville; in the State of
Ohio, When .they nominated, last spring, a tramp for
Mayor on an independent ticket as a means of having
fun on election day. It will be recalled that the people
of the town thought the joke so good that a clear ma
jority of thcrn^ voted for the tramp, and were horrified
next mqrning to find out that, they had elected him.'}-' An
appeal was made to the Governor to remove him, but
the Governor refused, on the ground that he had no
sufficient cause for such action, so Amesville has been
getting along as best she can with the genial tramp,
who came to town to ask for a free lunch and was given
the Mayoralty as a handout.
After the first announcement of the joke and its con
sequences, the country* at large ceased to take interest in
the affair and left Amesville and its Mayor alone to get
along as best they couid. It appears now that they have
been having a -frolicsome time. A report from Canton
announces that the "joke Mayor," as he is called, was
recently arrested in that city on a charge, of intoxication
and. sent to jail because he had no money to pay a fine
of $1 and costs. The report .added that his Honor ex
plained his presence and his hilarity, in" Canton by say
ing' he "is taking a slight vacation from his arduous
official, duties." .
"Evidently the joke of theimerry men of Amesville
has^ turned out to be something in the nature of a con
tinuous performance. Between the .day when he entered
upon his arduous official- duties. in Amesville and the day
when he was arrested for trying to paint Canton : red, he
has doubtless had a high bldtime and contributed. much
of gayety to the annals of that section of Ohio? His
chief work, however, has been that of furnishing, the
American voter with a^good object lesson on the folly
of playing monkey tricks with politics. No other city
has' ever made. quite so ridiculous a showing as Ames
ville has made-in- this case, but some have fallen not far
short of it., and if the average voter will now give serious
consideration to the results of the folly of the Amesville
men, there will be better municipal officers" in" a good
many; cities^ hereafter. . *

The amount of wine made In the
United States is, however, very small

Mohammedan population drinks very
little wine, produces nearly twice as
much wine as the United States.
The cultivation of grapes for the mar
ket, for raisins and to make wine has
become an important business of the
United States during recent years. Two
hundred million dollars of capital are
invested in this and dependent indus

the country with practically all the rai
sins they eat, 190,000,000 pounds, and
the same State, with Xew York and

before any. of the grape3 are changed
to wine or raisins, reaches $15,000,000 in

wrong turning, and only after they had
gone s*ome distance did they discover

It's hard. We lay our pity at their

free will. They have no right to be

even if they are women. They have

home. Thin is not a matter to be
minced! It is not a vice to be excused
or condoned, being every bit as serious
es drunkenness. A common "scold" is
not a whit more respectable than an
inebriate. Termagants do not reel and
fall down in a stupor. They do not
emash furniture and pawn their Jewel
ry for whiskey. But they do fill the
cups of their husbands and their chil
dren with bitterness. They quench all
domestic Joy. They throw a continual
shadow over th*> household. And the
ehrew ought to know it. There is no
real obligation on a gentleman to per
mit his life and his home to be ruined
from a sense of chivalry. His wife
is a woman, but she is also a moral
agent and accountable for her conduct.
There are. however, men who possess
qualifications for delivering women
from the influences of this devil of fret
fulness and fault-finding, and it is their
duty to exercise their powers, not only
for their own sakes. but for their
rives'. For the finer nature* of such
women are as sure to go to pieces un
der th*Â» evil influences of tni3 pernic
ious habit as are those of their hus
bands.
This, however, is but a slender hope.
The disease is too deeply seated for su
perficial treatment and requires heroic
measures. Nothing but the exercise
of masculine authority backed by the
highest kind of moral power will work a
lasting cure, and it is because husbands
hesitate to resort to this extreme meas
ure that so many homes are wrecked
by Ehrews.
Most men are utterly dispirited by a
ehrew's ceaseless outcry against life.
A few experiments convince them of
the incalculable force of this unhappy
disposition, and they give it up as a
bad Job and fly to the saloon for conso
lation. Still other men are too cour
teous to oppose and struggle with a wo
man. There is in every true sent!eman
an instinctive deference for her sex and
tolerance . for her little weaknesses.
Nothing: is more offensive than his su
perior strength and will. And nothing
is more dangerous. The moment peo
ple lose self-control they resort to vio
lence. Tfctre is but a step, between
resistance and wife-beating. An in
stinctive fear that a blow will be the
consequence of a brawl has kept many
a man quiet and patient until he found
rest in th? grave. For all men who do
cot possess the highest typÂ« of moral
power and the most perfect self-con
trol there is no safe way but silence
and non-resistance.
There is a congenital tendency ' in
some women to nag and fret and fuss.
God help them! They are '^s much to
be pitied as blamed. In dealing with
them the ftrst experiment should b?
made with â silence. It is not *oo raurh
to pay that the very existence of any
home is imperiled by the presence of a
shrew, for the disposition to fume and
ecold is certain to increase with the
passing years and the prowing*burdens
of life. And no matter hov.- patient a
man may be. continuous dropping
wears away a stone. The quietest and
most placid tamper is liable to explode |
under the incessant strain of a vixen's
fault finding, and as "back talk" is
eur< to provoke a quarrel, the husband
of a shrew must learn to hold his peace.
It is not enough, however, simply to
be still, for a woman wno is the? victim
r>i this loathsome infirmity will talk as
long as any one will listen. But there
is a psychological law in which '
there lies some hope. She Will not j
talk to herself. It is among the
bare possibilities of life that if she see3
her husband clap on his hat every time
the opens her batteries, she m*y learn
to keep still for fear of being U-tt alone.
Thero is only one possible discovery
more terrible than a man's finding that
the girl he marries for her quiet gen
tleness is in reality a termagant. "It
is better to dwell in a desert land than

In the manufacture of glucose chem
ists found -a. large source of revenue go
ing to waste, so â they trapped it, and
now corn oil, the oil from the
germ in a grain of corn, is extracted
and millions of dollars' worth are used
in the arts . ev^ry year. . Coke ovens,
sugar refineries,, blast furnaces, the
dairy business, mining, the cotton seed
oil Industry, whisky distilleries, glass
works, potteries, : steel '. mills, tanneries
and city garbage dumps have been in
vaded, by ,the industrial chemist, and
every month" he" turns loose" some pro
cess which .utilizes" tome; wasted prod
uct to the glory of his profession, and
the large profit of his employer. '
Time was, and not so very long ago,
when coal tar was regarded pretty
much as a waste product. But the in
quisitive industrial chemist began pickl
ing it to pieces, and now the most beau,
tiful ana line dyes are produced from tne
once despised coal tar, and numerous
valuable drugs result from its distil
lation and chemical treatment. Antl
pyrlne, antifebrin, acetan&Iid, phenace
tine and saccharin, which is 280 tim?s
sweeter: than sugar; sulpho'nal. which
puts nervous people .to sleep, are some
coal tar drugs, and benzine, benzol,
creosote oil, . naphthalene, .lampblack
and innumerable colors and dyes are
produced from the residuum called coal
tar.
Industrial chemistry applied to the
petroleum Industry fairly revolution
ized the manufacture of oils. The
Standard Oil Company may be the
mother of trusts, but It has done more
to develop and encourage industrial
chemistry probably than any other ccn
cern or institution on the face of the
earth. Originally crude oil was refined
to obtain kerosene for illuminating pur
poses. The waste was enormous. To
day the by-products in the manufac
ture of kerosene are more valuable than
the principal product. By various
processes of distillation and the addi
tion of acids and alkalis, crude oil is
split up into gasoline, naphtha of va
rious grades, kerosene, lubricating oil,
paraffin, vaseline, cosmoline and scores
of other .preparations and carbons for
arc lights. .It is when. 6ne remember j
that but a few short years ago every
one of these products except kerosene
was wasted, that one appreciates the
importance of the expert chemist in the
industrial field.
For years glycerin, now used in im
mense quantities, was a wasted pro
duct. Soap makers and, in fact, every
manufacturer who uses fatty -oili?. for
merly sent the waste adrift in conven
ient streams. But now the waste from
fatty oils is treated with alkalis, the
glycerin is collected by evaporation
and distillation and great quantities
of it are used in making useful explo
sives.
There is a great sewer which carries
the water from the Chicago stock yards
to the Chief go River. Xot m.iny
years ago tMs water was bubbling
with the pases of decomposition;
thick with' floating grease and rot
ten refuse. / Now the water is about
the color of very weak beef tea, and
bs harmless. That is because the in
dustrial chemist has discovered and de
veloped methods which have made the
waste by-products, and what was once
cast into the Fewer is now carefully col
lected to later become finished prod
ucts of great value and large import
ance.
Take the one item of blood. Thou
pands of tens of fertilizers are made
every year from the red gore, which
Bives local color to up-to-date packing
houses. The produced fertilizers are
chiefly valuable for the large amount
of nitrogen which they contain, and
nitrogen is one of the most necessary
parts of plant food. .Fertilizers made
at a big packing house from blood and
ground bone are shipped to all parts
cf the world.
No part of an animal killed on a
slaughter floor of a modern packing
house is lost or wasted. Formerly the
caul fats went into the cheap tallow
products. Now they are utilized for
the manufacture of oleomargarine oil,
the chief component part of butterlne
or oleomargarine. The intestines are
made into sausage covers. Pepsin is
a modern product which the industrial
chemist gets from the stomach and gall
is. used by printers, painters and dyers.
The blood goes into fertilizers, much of
it is .used in sugar refineries to clarify
the syrup, and imitation tortoise shell,
buttons and other' articles ' are made
from a preparation which has hydraulic
pressed blood as its principal constitu
ent. ' The common fats, unfit for mak
ing oleomargarine oil, are rendered into
tallow; the hide is sent to the tanner;
the bladders and weaeands are used for
packing snuff and putty in and for
scores of other things; horns, blade
bones and shin bones are made into
buttons, combs, knife handles, etc.;
hoofs, hide trimming*, sinew*, knuckles
and other scraps are made into glue,
and all oflfal not otherwise used is con
verted into fertilizers.
There was a time when every slaugh
ter house and packing establishment
was a public nuisance and a breeder of
disease and 'foul odors. This was be
cause the grease, offals" and all the
cast-outs /which went under the gen
eral head of "waste" products were ac
tually \va6ted. " To-day. ." the, word
"waste" is practically wiped off the
slate of packing house vocabulary. The
old joke that a Chicago packing house
uses every part of a pig except its
squeal and'is canning squeals for grand
Juries is a concise statement of the real
conditions in such establishments.
Chemical experiments with waste
products have made millionaires of
many men. The industrial chemist is
the wealth producer of the industrial
world. By transforming waste prod
ucts Into by-products he not only has
added millions to the revenues of man
ufacturers and miners, but has brought
down luxuries to the hard pan of daiiy
necessities. -'Â»' v

TRADE seems f*o be about on a normal plane at
present. There is no depression of any conse
quence, nor is there any particular activity in any
line. In other words the situation is about as usual just
before the holidays, when tlje wholesale trade is about
to take stock and therefore quiet, and the retailers arid
jobbers arc doing most of the business. No activity need
be expected until along in the middle of January and in
some years it does not appear, untiltlicist of February.
It is worthy of remark that the feeling of apprehension,
not to say despondency, which crept over the. country
during the early fall months has passed away. The enor
mous'liquidation in Wall street has ceased; and with it
the depression which! is apt to accompany a~ sharp decline
in stocks. Trade reports now corning in show a better
state of affairs than was expected several weeks ago. A
mercantile agency- has just sent out broadcast. a ,set of
questions to the more important lines as to the condition
of their trade in comparison with 1902, and the returns
are satisfactory. New England reports a gain of from
10 to 15 per cent in boots and. shoes, cottons andrubber,
with the outlook in lumber and woolens problematical.
The lumber sales are 25 per cent less than in 1902, but the
situation in wool is improving. The Southwest reports
a general increase of 10 to 12 per cent, but the, Northwest
reports a decrease of about 5 per ctnt. In the Southern
States the conditions are favorable and^ the recent sharp
advance in cotton has made business lively in that impor
tant section of the country. The dry! goods market at
New York is reported in* an unsatisfactory condition.
The Pacific Coast sends in excellent reports, with export
and local business up to the average of this time of the
year. ;^.f Â¦,.-Â¦,;. Â¦--. '.:; ;Yi:!. /V'^-V-
Against this good exhibit, however, the^re are. some
lines which are not quaking a good showing. The rail
road earnings are no<5 keeping" up to their previous. gains
and money is returning to New York from the West
more slowly than expected. This is not serious,- how
ever, for funds- are 7nuch more plentiful and accessible
than anticipated some months ago, and even if the return
movement is delayed;some weeks no particular derange
ment will result as Â£ar as present indications go. - :
The best three barometers to trade are now making
an improved showing- The bank clearings have at last
got over to the right side of the book and last week
were 4.2 per cent larger than during the corresponding
week in 1902. It ha : s been some time since 'these ' ex
j changes showed a gain over the preceding year. -~\\Condi
tions in the iron trade are better, as orders, though still
small, seem to be increasing and there is much-less de
pression in prices. Some recognized authorities in this
line say that the bottom has been reached and that hence
forth any change in conditions will probably be for the
better. Time will tell. It is said that the current quar
ter is making a poor showing. The provision trade is
looking up at Chicago, where the cash demand is. reported
fine, and though the packers are trying to force down
prices for cured meats they are accumulating' stock -in
their cellars, the supposition being that they expect to
sell out these holdings at higher prices later on. If the
exhibit of these three barometers be accepted as good
indicators of the condition of trade then general business
is on a better basis than for several months past.. "Though
still lower prices are expected all along the line, as pro
duction is steadily overtaking consumption, it is thought
that the recession will continue to be gradual. If this
proves true then no serious effects will accompany the
decline in prices. â¢ /
A gratifying feature of the general situation is the ex
cellent condition of the farmers. They seem to be finan
cially strong all over the land. Large crops and good
prices for several years have placed them as a class upon
their feet and they are prepared to hold on to their
produce until they obtain satisfactory prices for it. The
cotton planter of the South is on velvet. The wheat
planter of the West and Northwest is getting a good
price for his grain and the fruit and grain growers of the
Pacific Coast have done well for several seasons. As
for diversified farming it is paying excellent dividends
everywhere. Hops, hides, wool, dairy produce and the
j hundreds of minor products are. bringing good returns,
and wherever we look we find the agriculturist doing
I well. Perhaps it is this condition that imparts renewed
.'confidence to the business situation, for as long as the
farmer prospers the rest of the country' will not be visited
by any N serious depression.
The stock market continues quiet and devoid of espe
cial feature. Stocks are firm one day and weak the next,
with no particular tendency in either direction at the
moment. There are no signs yet that the public have
returned *to the speculative field, and the market there
fore continues almost exclusively professional. Money
is still in good supply all' over the country, and as already
pointed out interest rates are much lower, than expected
some months ago. We are importing gold, another good
sign. Our foreign balances are running more in our
favor than for a year past. Competent authorities in
New York say that most of our foreign obligations have
been liquidated and the steady imports of gold tend to
confirm this statement. Taken in the aggregate the
condition of" trade throughout the country is excellent.
But we must not overlook the fact that the era of abnor
mally high prices is over and that the tendency is toward
a more conservative plane. . ........ .

will be a united effort to surround the
magnificent bay of San Francisco with
places of resort as charming and at
tractive as are to be found anywhere
in this or any other country.
It is our climate alone that makes
possible the growing of the distinctive
varieties of fruits that are giving Cali
fornia its world-wide reputation. For
example, the olive, orange, lemon, po
melo, fig, ralslh and other foreign va
rieties of the grape, French prune, al
mond, walnut, apricot and others I
might mention. "Climate alone." says
Professor Wickson, "has brought into
Southern California 100,000 people who
would not otherwise have come, and
have added $100,000,000 to the capital of
that region.
The same influence has added largely
to the wealth and population of Cen
tral and Northern California. This eco
nomic value of which I speak Is not
confined to the growing of fruits, but
to many other forms of agriculture. I
am now (December 5) digging the sec
ond crop of potatoes on my farm in
Tehama County, on about the parallel
of Chicago and New York City, where
the thermometer has been hovering
around zero, and the market garden
on my farm Is supplying vegetables
daily to the people of Red Bluff, even
tomatoes growing in -the open.
'Farm stock of all kinds are living
well on the new grass and will con
tinue to feed without further care
through the winter." We took off a crop
of alfalfa (the fifth) in November. Or
chard pruning and cultivation are pro
gressing, and the autumn sown grain
is six Inches high in some fields. In
deed, the economic adaptation of our
'climate is possible in almost every ave
nue of California's activities. The an
nual reports of ' the " California State
Board of Trade for 1902 and previous
years, which have been sent broad
cast throughout the East and West,
and in Europe, contain unanswerable
evidence of the points I have here en
deavored to set forth, and have had
wide influence In disseminating the
truth concerning this marvelous State.
activity and the higher use of the lands
within the district of these canals.
. The dawn of the modern light Is be
ginning to spread over the Sacra
mento Valley. That land by the heav
en's better favor has , so well % main
tained its standard of product that
the real beneficial effect of irrigation
has not yet been- felt, but people know
its value. Â¦ Â¦
The great central canal is nearing
completion. The waters, of the broad
Sacramento will be , turned over the
vast grain fields of Glenn and Colusa
counties .within the year. The largest
body of uniformly rich land In Cali
fornia' will then claim its natural her
itage. Three hundred thousand acres

The. producing capacity of that land
The climate of California is its
most valuable asset. Take it away and
substitute for It; the climate of the
Eastern, Middle or Western States,
with their extremes of heat and coldâ
100 above to 20 below zero â their
violent storms, their limitations in the
products of the soil, nothing would re
main more attractive than may be
found in many of the States referred
to.
Perhaps that is not quite true. We
would still have our vast deposits of
mineral wealth and our unexampled
forests of commercial woods, and we
would have, our commanding position
on the Pacific Ocean.
But. apart from these, we would be
in much the same condition as would
Italy and the countries around the
Medlterranian Basin; as Spain and
other south of Europe countries, if
the climate of the Baltic were to be
substituted and established there.
The gifts of nature are seldom taken
at any particular value. We accept
them and go about creating things
not given, little heeding the true
meaning of what we find ready made.
In truth, however, the gift of the
unique .and matchless climate be
stowed upon California Is an asset of
greater money value to the State than
the combined wealth of all its pres
ent Inhabitants. It I? beyond computa
tion, for it reaches out into the illim
itable future and is imperishable. If
every industry in the State were de
stroyed and the inhabitants were to
begin life here without capital, the
State would, through the possibilities
of its climate, be richer in half a cen
tury than it is to-day. What would
California take in exchange for her
climate ?
MANY ADVANTAGES.
What are the distinguishing fea
tures and peculiarities of California's
climate, for which we claim its unique
and unparalleled character?
In the first place. It is unchanging.
As far back as we have any recorded
history and, behind this, embracing
traditions coming through the early
mission fathers, we learn of the same
equability of temperature, the same
balmy atmosphere. * the same lux
uriance of vegetation. Our soil may
require renewing by fertilization, but
our climate is as constant as the sun.
farmers made money from their
ranches and. money from their mines
and commenced the building of the
beautiful California cities, San Fran
cisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento
and Stockton, j
These men conbeived the plan of con
structing a transcontinental railroad
and it was done, and a new condition
of things soon dawned on California.
The wav was made easier for people
to reach this land of promise and they
came.. The farmer from the agricul
tural districts of the East sought the
congeniality of California life.
A STORY ''OF. FRUITAGE.
Captain A. P. Clough, who crossed
the plains "in '49." brought with him
a selection ,of fruit and berry seeds.
Before leaving Buffalo the neighbors
gathered at the house and held a "seed
bee." The seeds of the common va
rieties of apple, pear, peach; plum,
cherries were 'Â¦ taken front the fruit and
The conditions which have produced
the result are themselves unchanging,
and so must be the result.
California- is a universal sanitarium.
The climate of the coast is invigor
ating, stimulating and delightful,
neither hot nor cold. The laborer
knows no fatigue, except from physi
cal exhaustion, resulting from over
taxed muscles. The bralnworker
yields only to failure of mental pow

experience or feel, in the valleys is

LIFE IN THE OPEN.
The variety of temperature and cli
matic conditions exislng In the moun
tains, valleys and on the coast and the
celerity and ease with which our inhab
itants may change their Immediate
surroundings constitute one of the
great charms cf California lift*.
Thousands of families residing In the
valleys find their way into the moun
tains or to the sea coast and have most
delightful camping out experiences.
This they may do In a few hours or in
a day or two at the most, with their
own conveyances. Our valleys and
mountains lie so related to each other
that no spot can be found devoid of
scenic beauty^ There Is no dull mo
notony in the farmer's life as thi-'re Is
from necessity in the lives of those who
reside on the great plain regions of the
West.
Degrees of latitude cut but little fig
ure in determining the readings of the
thermometer. In the State Board of
Trade report for 1902 will be found a
table which tells the story from official
sources. It covers the whole country

the State, to Redding,- at the extreme
north end of the Sacramento valley-

SCENES IN IRRIGATION DISTRICTS OF SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN NORTHERN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
BV C. M. WOOSTER.
With the mJnd on the subject of ir
rigation, a glance at the map of Cali
fornia is part'cularly Interesting. Na
ture has richly endowed California
with irrigable land and bountifully
provided water for purposes of Irriga
tion- Particularly is this true of the
great basin of the State known as the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valltys.
A hundred good-sized perennial moun
tain streams form the source of the
Sacramento River; from the summit of
the Siskiyous to the Southern base of
Shasta spring these crystal mountain
streams that flow into the largest and
roost picturesque of California water
way?, affording in itself sufficient
water to irrigate that veritable empire,
the Sacramento Valley.
Still the means of nature are much
more ample. At Oroville we cress
the Feather River, coming from the
snow lakes of Sierra and Plumas, an
other steamboat river in nature's way
with sufficient water to irrigate and
fertilize a million acres. At Marysville
is met the Tuba, whose source Is a
region cf perpetual snow, the summit
of the Sierra-* and Lakes Fordyce.
Meadow, Crystal, Van Norden and
many other natural mountain reser
voirs.
The American River, from the great
Sierra Nevada Mountain shed of Ne
vada. Placer and El Dorado counties,
fio-ws into the Sacramento at Sacra
mento City. The Cosumne? crosses the
valley at Elk Grove. At Lodi we cross
the Mokelumne, which drains the great
water shed of Amador, Calaveras and
Alpine.
ABUNDANCE OF WATER.
At Ripon, a few miles south <^1 Stock
ton, we cross the Stanislaus and at Mo
desto the Tuolumne, both coming from
the watersheds of Eastern Calaveras
and Tuolumne counties. At Living
stone the Merced River crosses the val
ley, carrying the. waters from the crags
and deep canyons of the Yosemite.
Next south, the Fresno River from
Eastern Mariposa and Madeira water
sheds crosses the San Joaquin Valley
at Madeira. At Herndon the ,>an Joa
quin River crosses the valley and a
few mt!ep wept turns its course north
erly and is the principal waterway of
the San Joa<?Uin Valley. At Reedly is
Kings River, which flows from the rug
ged and picturesque Kings River Can
yon and its numerous forks in the east
ern watershed of Fresno' County. The
Kaweah is met at Goshen and the Tule
River at a few miles fcouth of Tulare.
The last notable stream is the Kern,
which cro?s=es at Bakersfield In its
course to Tulare Lake. *TherÂ« are also
numerous minor streams flowing from
the foothill regions on the eastern
slope of the great basin and a num
ber of water courses of important pro
portions flowing into the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys from the west
slope, draining the eastern watershed
of the Coast Range sufficiently at least
to supply all of the irrigable land of the
western slope of the basin if skillfully
diverted.
IDEAL FOR IRRIGATORS.
California is Messed with its moun
tains and doubly blessed with its val
leys. Six hundred miles of fertile
plain with climatic conditions and al
luvial soil promoting the superb de
velopment of all fruits, vines and veg
etable life and six hundred miles of
rugged Fnow-capped mountains send
ing down through every crag and can
yon wholesome water, gathering this
in potential rivers and ppreading it out
over the plains below, crossing the
valley at convenient points Just a suf
ficient di5tance apart to accommodate
the land In the most advantageous
way. ;':-S l r:-
Truly this is an ideal condition for
the irrigator, yet little appreciated
thus far in the State's development.
More and more each year the power
of water is being felt, and when Cali
fornia is developed, canals will spread
the water from every stream over the
gardens within their duty, conveying
the fertilizing elements of the hill
sides and supplying both food and
drink to many thousands of acres even
at this day uncultivated. Then the
Jand will be brought to a much higher
state cf production and its revenue ca
pacity increased many fold. ,
Californians have been slow to take
to irrigation. Where the live oak grows
by nature irrigation is not essential to
the gTowth of cereals, and most fruits
and the live oaks grow In all the val
leys of Northern and Central Califor
nia.
DAYS OF OPULENCE.
The State's history is but a few years,
yet full of interesting things. Mining,
perhaps the most fascinating occupa
tion, attracted a gallant class of pio
neers. They found California a big
countryâ big In everything. They
broadened into men of liberal tastes,
became accustomed to big things; the
massive oak groves of the valleys, the
monster redwood wilderness, majeetic
mountains and the giant sequoia.
Gold came* easily and went by the
teatpoonfuls. There was a most
wholesome freedom of range and air.
Big things were common.
The Mexicans, who always placed a
nominal value on land, had been lib
eral in bestowing upon themselves
ranches of 10.000 to 20,000 acres each.
Tbe gold bag of the American
miner became filled, and with his char
acteristic foresight he acquired these
vast estates, and thus began the wheat
era of California. The boII responded
freely and very soon California took
second place among the States In wheat
'production.
The California wheat' farmer was a
prince and he lived the part. A 10,000
acre wheat farm was the common
thing. The need of Irrigation was not
recognized. The indulgent California
eky amply supplied every essential
gift ur. best owed by the soil and the
Many figures that are of real value
have been supplied by competent au
thorities during the last week. The
California fruit distributors, through
Alden Anderson, report that 76S3 car
loads of fresh fruit have been shipped
out of the State during the year 1D03.
Mr. Anderson hopes the annual average
of shipments may be brought up to
12,000 carloads. The Davlsville Almond
Growers' Association, meeting at Davis
ville, reported that it had sent out of
California during the season 23 car
loads of almonds. The value was $1M69.
The Lc-s Angeles Chamber of Com
merce figures out the population of
Southern California counties to be 416.
500. In 1900 the total was 305,110. The
counties are now rated by the Chamber
of Commerce as follows: Los Angeles
251,000. Orange 23.000, Riverside 20,000.
San Diego 42,000, Ventura 18,000, Santa
Barbara 22,000.
During November 649 permits to erect
buildings in Les Angeles were Issued,
says the Herald. The expenditure in
volved in making these Improvements
was $1,1S3.S14.
A cement pla^Jt to cost $1,000,000 will

County as the result of the report of a
committee sent to. investigate a plant
at Napa Junction.
Construction work on the Bakersfleld-
Ventura electric railway has been be

A new steamboat company has been
formed at Stockton with a capital
stock of $100,000. so say3 the Stockton
Independent, to put in operatlcra ves
sels for handling freights on the San
Joaquin River next season.
The Tulare Register reports that
Tulare will have another butter fac
tory. The dairying industry in Tulare
County Is crowing.
The San Diego Union reports that the
Silver Gate flouring mills in San Diego
may be reopened.
The San Bernardino Times-Index
says that a line of automobile cars will
be constructed to run Into Death Valley
and bring out borax, taking the place
of the present mule trains and making
an annual saving of $100,000.
The Colfax Sentinel reports that the
lime works on the Bear River, three
miles from Colfax, are approaching
completion: The capacity of the kilns

The Berkeley Gazette says that the
Judson Iron Works at Emeryville will

will then be increased threefold. More
orange groves will be planted and
orchards -will multiply. Alfalfa and
dairy farms will be established and
thousands â¢ of acres now owned and
farmed by a jingle owner will pas3
into the hands of many hundreds of
people whose diligent husbandry, as
sisted by abundant water at the proper
time, will thus form that portion of
the great Sacramento Valley into "a
picture no artist can paint."
There is practically no dormant sea
son In California. Plant life grows
throughout the year. With irrigation
seeds can be sown and products har
vested in most every month of the
year. Six to eight crops of alfalfa are
gathered from the same field annually
where Irrigation Is properly applied
and the soil and climatic conditions are
suitable.
STRIKING COMPARISONS.
Three hundred to five hundred pounds
of water Is reaulred by nature to pro
duce one pound of dry matter. A prac
tical demonstration of the power of wa
ter in agriculture Is shown by the pro
ducts of California last year. Three
million acres In wheat and barley, non-
Irrigated, produced commercially $22,
000,000, while the product of 200,000 acres
of irrigated land sold for $30,000,000, a
very great contrast.
A part of the southern desert is be
ing reclaimed by diverting the waters
of the Colorado, where the cost of land
13 $1 25 an acre and the water right
alone costs $20 an acre. Hers the wa
ter value exceeds the land value 1600
per cent.
America Is entering boldly into the Ir

THE NEWER SYSTEM.
It is a simple problem,. a hill of po

often hoed and watered as well; its
growth is many fold more. With a
windmill and three i acres of inferior
land a gardener, on the Mission Road
produced $6000 worth of vegetables last
year.. It was not the soil' alone, nor the
water. The soil, the water and the- hoe
intelligently applied gave to that,three

The fact that latitude has little to do
with our climate is a remarkable fea
ture. It is not true of Italy, for there
is a great variation there between the
temperature north and south. It Is not
true in France or along the west coast
of Europe.% I believe this to be a pe
culiarity unique and found only on this
coast. This peculiarity is further at
tested by the, fact that in all this vast
region the same fruits are grown.
Within a radius of fifty. miles around
Orovllle. which Is 150 miles north of
San Francisco, and 650 miles north of
Los Angeles, there, were more than 1000
carloads of oranges raised last year,
and they ripen much earlier than In the
southâ a notable fact.
Elevation has much more to do with
the temperature- in California than lat
itude. In high altitudes we find snow.

side scored in a game of football
played here to-day between the Ath

League of the Cross, Menlo Park.
Both teams played in fine form. San
Mateowas outweighted an average of
seven pounds. Walter de Mara, their
best player, was absent, and only their
grit saved them f rom ; , de"f eat. The
grass was slippery and ;., aided inter
ference which kept the runs down.
But three kicks were made, one each
by the Dickie brothers . of . the Ath
letics, in which twenty yards were
gained, and one by Menlo, in which
eight yards were lost. Neither goal
was ever in danger. . . /

\ The announcement that Dr. Alex. J.
Mclvor-Tyndall. the lecturer and
demonstrator of psychic science, was
about to close his present lecture
series here, called out another im
mense audience last, night and many
were unable to secure seats in Stein
way Hall. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall took
for the subject of his lecture "Our
Common Birthright" and brought out
the point that every person has the
choice of becoming an Individual in
the scheme of life, or merely a nega
tive personality. The speaker de
clared that the greatest virtue a per
son can possess is that of independ
ence of thought and action, because
through this characteristic he will at
tain happiness and "success. The even
ing was concluded with some marvel
ously interesting experiments in the
powers of the sub-conscious mind,
which were made in a most entertain
ing manner and elicited loud ap
plause. Dr. Mclvor,-Tyndall announced
that he had been asked to given an ex
planation of the feats of the "Georgia
magnet" and he has decided to do^o
next Sunday evening, when the won
derful performance of the "magnetic
wonder" will be reproduced and the
principle by which they are accom
plished explained. The evening: will
be given over entirely to phenomena,
including, in addition to the phen
omena produced by the "Georgia mag
net." some of the most intricate ex
periments in the power of thought,
psychometry and clairvoyance.

In the final shooting contests of the
season, held at Shell Mound Park range
yesterday, Al Gehret/ Frank E. Mason
and Herman Huber covered themselves
with glory. The scores made are among
the best recorded for a long time.
Al Gehret was in particularly good
form, as he captured the yearly special
prizes for the highest ten strings in
the Germania, Golden Gate and Cali
fornia Schuetzen clubs. In the Germa
nia Club he /was closely followed by
Frank E.' Mason. Mr. Gehret's total in
the Golden Gate Club for the best ten
scores during the year with 2270 rings.
In the Germania Club he won out with
2235 rings, against 2230 for Mason. The
highest individual score for the year
was captured by Frank E. Mason, who
led all competitors with the high record
'of 232 rings in ten shots, being more
than 23 out of a possible 25.
Herman Huber is setting a hot pace
for the champions. His performances
with the rifle during the last few
months have been remarkable. In the
medal contest of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Vereln he placed the good
score of 444 rings to his credit and car
ried off the championship. honors.
Fred P. Schuster made the best cen
ter shot of the day in the Norddeutsch

credit. . .
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 13. â
Before a large assemblage in the
tabernacle, to-day, Apostle O. M.
Woodruff of the Mormon church dis
cussed the present state of affairs in
Utah, indirectly referred to the Smoot
case and scored certain Christian
ministers and "agitators." who, he
said, come to Utah under a false
cloak to stir up strife and dissension
for their own lucrative benefit at the
expense of somebody's else peace and
happiness. Referring to the Smoot
case, the speaker said:
â¢"The right of American citizenship
came from God, and let man beware
of how he attempts to undo what God
has done. It is remarkable that any
person be so narrow, so bigoted, that
because -another person does not be
lieve the same as he does, he would
deny him the right of his American
citizenship."
Apostle Woodruff Discusses Smoot
Case and Cluirapterizes His Op
ponents as Agitators.

British Sailors Defeat the Pirates.
An excellent game of association
football was played on Saturday after
noon on the grounds near the Cotton
Mills. East Oakland, between the Pi
rates and a team of apprentices from
the British vessels lying -off Sausalito.
The ground is quite level and is the
best used for association football in
this neighborhood. Though the sailors
lacked the services of Huxley and Al
exander, they played a good' game and
at half time had scored one goal to
none on the part of their -opponents.
They had all the best of the play in the
first period and showed excellent com
bination. Colchester, inside left for
ward, was especially noticeable, though
it was his first appearance on a football
field for thre* years.
In the second half the Pirates had
the best of the play but could not place
the ball between the posts, the defense
of the sailors being too strong to pierce.
The Rev. J. Digby of the Seamen's In
stitute was highly serviceable in goal,
clearing well on several occasions. Be
fore time was called, Colchester scored
a second goal for the Sailors, the goal
in the first half having been kicked by
Ewbank. The game ended thus:
Sailors 2. Pirates 0. For the losers
Simons plaved a good game, he and
Colchester being the smallest men on
the field. Henry Roberts, secretary, of
the California Association Football
League, was referee.

J. Reilly. He beat T. J. Cronin's Fair
Tralee in the deciding course.
The Plate was won by E. Baumeis-
ter's Cubanola, which defeated P. F.
Callan's Mi Amigo. after a long course.

Third rounds-Honest John beat Red Rock,
6-1; Charter Member beat J E H. 4-2; Rector
The winner met and defeated in turn
Belle Free, Renegade Apache, Aman
dan. Rubber Ankles, Pocatelli and,
finally, Honest John. He was a one
to-four choice in the latter course. He
had made all his trials short ones,
having run a total of 137 seconds to
his opponent's 188.
Rector's narrowest escape from de
feat was in the semi-final round, when
he ran an undecided course with Po
catelli. In the run off Rector led and
picked the hare up on the run, scoring
five points to nothing. In his trial with
Rubber Ankles he had a margin of but
one point in his favor, the score being
five to four. Rector was runner-up to
Beacon for the stake in 1901.
The stake furnished the most sensa
tional coursing ever seen in America.
The greyhounds were unusually well
matched and were sent on the field
trained to the hour. The only jarrins
note was struck in the deciding course,
when some of the spectators took issue
with Judge Grace over his decision.
The course was a long one and was
run in the dusk. A light fog hung low
over the field. This made It difficult for
the spectators, a quarter of a mile
away, to view the entire course. Judge
Grace, in explanation of the score, said:
"Rector led by ten lengths. He
scored twenty points before Honost
John scored at all. Aftar the first six
points under the rules the scoring
doubles, two points being" allowed for
each turn made. After Rector lan
up a sequence of twenty points Honest
John scored six. Rector then made six
more and Honest John finished with
a sequence of ten. For a part of the
time in which he was in front he was
not Ecorlng, the hare being too far
in advance of him."
There waj a similar demonstration in
the same stake In 1899, when Judge Bull
declared For Freedom the winner over
Thornhlll. The former was a brindle
dog, while the latter was white. In
the semi-darkness the latter could be
distinguished, while, the other dog
could not be seen, his color correspond
ing with that of the field. The Judges
decision was sustained by men in the
field who could see For Freedom scor
ing.
Rector is a red dog, while Honest
John is black and white.
The attendance was large, although
the weather conditions were unfavor
able for outdoor sports. The betting
was heavy, especially in some of the
trials where opinions were equally di
vided as to the outcome. t .
Rector, a California-bred greyhound
owned by G. Lacy Crawford of St. Louis,
won the ninth renewal of the John
Grace Challenge Cup Stake yesterday
at Union Coursing Park. In the decid
ing course he met P. F-Callan's" Honest
John, which he defeated by a score of
26 points to 16.
In a hard final at Ingleside Coursing
Park yesterday P. J. Horgan's Tralee
Lass beat W. Maguire's Orsina for first
honors by a score of 10 to 7. The de
ciding course found the contestants at
even money, and up to the time the bell
rang the monev poured into the boxes
in big bunches.
The stake brought out many good
trials, with but few disappointing, re
sults to the talent.
Lily York went out in the third round
tc Sofala in a close course, beaten by
a point. Many looked upon her as a
likely candidate for final honors after
her showing of the day before, but she
succumbed to coursing luck. Sofala
made a great bid for the big end of the
purse, but was finally retired by favor
of the hare.
During the. noon intermission Pat
MuIIarkey questioned the decision of
Judge Thomas Tlerney in a close
course where one of his hounds was in
the running,, and the two came to
blows. Friends interfered and sepa
rated the men before any damage was
done.
Following are the day's results, with
Judge Tierney's official scores:

COURSING COP
WON BY RECTOR
On a slippery field at the Presidio
Athletic Grounds the Independent As
sociation^ fi'Otball team of San Francis
co defeated the Oakland Hornets yes
terday 5 proals to 0. 1
/ The Hornets were weakene'd by the
absence of the captain. "Percy" Cham
bers, Harry Bird and Connolly! Shand,
MeKenzie, Smith and Erskine did
sood work in the forward line, but
the Independents' back line was too
strong for' the Hornets. Hunter and
Pomeroy were active on the half-back
line and Williamson defended the goal
well, flstinff or kicking out many dan
gerous shots. V;-
The ba!! was kicked off shortly after
2:30 p. m., the Hornets defending the
south goal. After a few minutes' play
the Independents had, a shot at the
Hornets 1 goal. Williamson fisted it
out, but a second shot passed him.
A minute before half time was called
the Independents scored a second goal.
Alm'ost immediately after the change
of ends the Independents put the ball
between the posts and before the call
of time scored two more goals. The
winning team showed much better com
bination work than the losers. . For the
winners the Fay brothers played their
usual strong game, and Mechels and

Walter McCreery, who was Injured
last Sunday, witnessed the game from
the pavilion. He Is still on crutches
and looks slightly haggard.
Peter D. Martin has returned after a
long absence, bringing a large stable
of horses. He will be seen In future
games and in the hunts.
Notwithstanding- a misty rain, there
was a large attendance at the game,
Including many ladies.
The White!" caved themselves from a
whitewash on the Burlingame Country
Club polo ueld yesterday by a timely
shot in the last minute of play, which
gave them the first and only goal.
It was made by Lawrence McCreery,
who played a strong game throughout.
He was equalled in his back strokes by
John Lawscn, who made his first ap
pearance during the present season.
The Reds scored six goals and had tne
game pretty much their own way from
the beginning of the second period. In
the first period the Whites kept the
ball on their approach end of the field
almost continually. It was usually hov
ering about the goal, but could not be
driven through.-
In this perlo.! Mr. Carolan made a
magnificent play, catching the ball in
the air from a back stroke by Mc-
Creery and sending it hurling in tfee
other direction. He repeated the fnt
in the third period. In the second pe
riod Lawson, who was a Strong addi
tion to the Reds, drove the ball between
the posts at a distance of sixty yard3.
Just two minutes later Tom Driacell
scored at the other end of the BeM
Mr. Carolan beat this record by one
minute, with the assistance of his pony,
which kicked a goal for him.
The teams were: Reds â F. J. Caro
lan, J. O. Tobin Jr., T. A. Driscoll and
J. Lawson. Whitesâ R. M. Tobin.
Charles. Dunphy, C. R. Duval and Law
rence McCreery. Umpireâ Harry Simp

LOXDOX. Dec. 13. â The stock
market last week continued very sen
sitive to the Far Eastern situation,
and was strongly affected by the vary
ing reports of the probabilities of
peace or war between Russia and
Japan. On the whole the tendency,
however, of the market continues up
ward, and the greatest revival in busi
ness was witnessed in Argentine and
American railroad securities. The
latter, however, moved irregularly,
being kept back by the weakness in
steel bonds. The market generally,
however, is quiet and no great.acces
sion to business is expected until the
new year.
'MADRID, Dec. 13.â Spain will not
participate In the St. Louis Exposi
tion. This decision was reached at a
Cabinet council, the reason, given: be
ing:, that there would, riot ; be â¢ sufficient
time to complete preparations.
Spain Disappoints St. Louis.
PORTLAND, Dec. lS.^With a clear
track and a right of way" across all
America a special train sent- out 1 by
order of E. H. Harriman raced from
New : York to Portland in eighty-five
hours to bring Robert L. Gerry and a
special physician to the bedside of
Peter Gerry." ;
' The sick man is the son of Elbridge
T. Gerry., the, millionaire philanthro
pist of New York, arid was a member
of the- Harriman' party on its tour
through the West. He Is in the hos
pital here with typhoid fever and if
convalescent. His father originally
intended to come on the special, but
at the last moment decided to/i com<Â£
the next day with his wife and daugh
ters onl a second special... _....â..
: ; Young; Gerry's improved condition
made this unnecessary. Mr. Harri
man left for the East this morning as
soon as the Gerry, special got in. .'No
particular Effort was .made to break
the transcontinental- record, but the
train with two passengers' made the
fastest time ever made between Port
land and Xew York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Continuing Colonel Wright said:
"Capital charges to the consumer the
depreciation of property and machin
ery. Why should not the depreciation
of labor's machinery. Its hands, its
brains, its body, be included in the final
cost?"
"England," said Colonel Wright, "has
taken up this question, and we of the
United States are steadily approach
ing it."
These words were contained in an ad
dress u?on "The Wage Question" made
to-day by Carroll D. Wright, United
States Commissioner of Labor, before
the Society of Ethical Culture of this
city. Of scarcely less interest, than his
prediction of a new labor system was
Colonel Wright's approval of a plan to
insure labor against incapacity result
ing from accident,, illness or advanced
age. The German idea was quoted, un
der which the employer pays one-fourth
the cost of a sick and death benefit
policy, the employe one-fourth and the
Government one-half.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 13.â 'The wage
system will pass away. In its stead, I
believe, there will come a system which
will be composed of the profit-sharing
and the co-operation ideas. The great
labor question means the struggle*' of
humanity for a higher standard of life.
The employer must consider his em
ploye, as well as the stockholder, as an
investor."
Some time since suggestions were
made to give her the advantage of
modern improvements, but the Gov
ernment had no- funds to be applied in
that channel, and the State thought
Â«he was well enough' off as ; she was.
Colonel. G. W. Bauer and Lieutenant
Schilling, however, decided that im
provements were necessary, so at their
own expense 'they are; trying to, make
her interior "up to date." Electric
lights are being installed all tnrougt}
the shiD, two, broad companion ways
have been. put up, five new hardwood
lockers have been built in' the fore
castle, and altogether she presents. a
thoroughly inviting appearance. # The
officers in command are now >con
templating putting in a fine new hard-:
wood deck, but have not yet come to
a conclusion. .
The old sloop-of-war Marion, which
is now used as a training ship, is being
(modernized â that is, so far as her inte
rior is concerned. She is lying alongside
; of Harrison-street dock, where ehe has
: been for several -months past. A long
time ago she had outlived her useful
ness in Uncle Sam's navy as a fighting
craft and in 1897 she .was turned over
| to the Governor of California to be used
in the interests of the naval reserve of
this State.
Â¦ She cannot go out to sea, as her,boil
| ers are in bad shape, so she is tied up
! alongside the dock, and there fulfills
: the requirements that are expected
; of her.

In amusements as well as weightier things
To the public each day fullest news The Call brings.
So to know where to go, how to buy or to sell.
From its columns one learns all a paper can tell.
In the homes of the land is The Daily Call found,
And its hold on the favor of people is sound.
Thus its ads bring results that are ever the best,
As is readily proved if you but make the test.

The following are the seasonal rainfalls to
date as compared with those of same date last
season and rainfall in last twenty-four hour3.
Crossed wires caused a small blaze
in a blind cloaet above the door of the
Diamond Parlor Jewelry Company, at
722 Market street, shortly after 11
o'clock yesterday morning. The' fire
men in charge of the chemical engine,
had control of the blaze after only a
moment of work. Some jewelry in the
windows and the front of the store
were considerably injured by water
and debris scattered by the firefighters
In their attempt to put out the con
flagration.
Small Fire in Jewelry Store.
Frank Riley, coal, hnerchant. 141
Converse street, got into an alterca
tion .with an unknov.n man on How
ard street., near Ninth, early yester
day morning and was knocked down,
his head striking the ' sidewalk Â¦ with
considerable force. The unknown man
ran away and George McClellan of 133
Ninth street, who saw the fight, tele
phoned-to the poflce station. Riley
was. taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital in the patrol wagon, where
it was found that he had .sustained a
lacerated wound of the scalp and pos
sible fracture of the skull.
Rlley Suffers In Fight.
Litigation between the belligerent
parties will occupy the attention of the
Superior Court to-day.
There was a meeting of the executive
committee .of. the Wholesale TYuit and
Produce Merchants* Protective Associ
ation on Saturday night, at which it
was decided to make a vigorous fight
against the rulings of the Eoard of
Harbor Commissioners, botli in the
courts and generally.
The association adopted a declaration
of principles, in the nature of tn ex
planation and defense of Its course in
its contest with the board and certain
newspapers. The following points,
among others, are set forth:
We have confidence In public opinion and
are willing to abide by the peop le Â« Â£Â«*Â»Â«Â«â¢
Â¦We are the victims of an unjust â¢**â¢**Â¦**Â«Â«*
newspaper, which has sttematlxed ua J* prtce
nusrn and boycotters, neither of . whl ch *â¢
are. The public haÂ« been prejudiced by tnesÂ«
eV The'O Phase, of the controversy will te.
settled in the courts, but we Â«Â»eÂ«!rei to Â¦â¢*Â«Â«:
tain falsehood* at rest It has ***^******
that we have raised the price of Pf 0 **;'";
whereas we have nothing to do with prtcÂ«a
and our members are competitors. t No aÂ«so
clatlon could control prices of P 0^ 0 !"-^
like prcducts. There are mUlloni of l Â»
raised on this coast annua.lly. and It is fteyon?
the power of *n aMoclatlon tÂ» control prices.
We have never attempted this futile task.
We rernlate hours and methods only. Be
fore we organized wholesalers werÂ« worlttn*
their porters, weighers, draymen and. salesmen
from S a. m. till 6 p. m.. and now they arÂ«
working from 7 a. m. till 5 p. m. only. Our
rules have made life sweeter for alt enÂ»aÂ«ed
and we have never sought to overthrow thÂ»
great law of supply and demand that ever
regulates the prices paid for perishable prod
uct*. Statements to thÂ« contrary are false.
The public should understand that the Co
lombo Market, with which the wholesalers arÂ»
In no manner associated. Is the only organi
zation In San Kranclsco that attempt* to fix
the prices of vegetables. That market: asso
ciation fixes prices each week.
A large demand for potatoes In ths East.
where the marHet has failed, and the great
growth of San Francisco, with the accompany,
mg diminution of garden area, have made,
prices slightly higher than last yearâ but ws
ar* In no way responsible for this fact. j
The impression has gone abroad that -our
licenses have been reveked:. but no board, has
such power. The commissioners have nrÂ»
power beyond State property, and tha"t
power, we hold, has been exercised Il
legally. We havÂ« not been given a hear
ing and we never have refused to sell ta
anybody on State property. We ask the pub
lic to withhold criticlwn until our battles havÂ«Â«
been tried, not by one newnpsiwr, but in the
courts. The firms are all In business and Cal
ifornia laws have given no commission the
power to revoVe general licenses or to control
us In any way, outatde of the wharves. '

"Where young Hall is now making his
abode is a matter that the poli?e expect
to determine to-day.
, Three days ago a story was published
to the effect that a young man by the
name of "Van Rensselaer" had de
camped from a fiat in the Western Ad
dition with a number of pieces of <?!lk
and lace belonging to his landlady. The.
same â¢ evening the supposed "Van
Rensselaer" at the Occidental tele
phoned to the papers explaining chat
he was a guest at that hotel and that
the publication was very annoying to
him in that a confnsion of names might
lead some to think he was the person
who had disappeared. It was the fol
lowing day that the Occidental guest
also disappeared and since then he has
kept his whereabouts a secret.
Later he registered at the Palace un
der the name of. Hall, but about the
court and the bar of the hotel he in
troduced himself as "Van Rensselaer,"
telling the same story that he had
passed over the counter at the Occi
dental. Several nights ago Hall care
lessly handed to the clerk of' the Occi
dental, whom he had claimed as an old
school chum, a check for $25, drawn
on a local bank, and it was promptly
cashed. The following night he passed
in a second check, this time, to another
clerk, and again was favored with the
cash. Since then he has not been seen
about the establishment and it is prob
ably well that he has not, for the
checks have since been returned to the
bank stamped "no funds."
Meanwhile Hall had been getting
coin from the Palace and found it nec
essary to keep clear of that establish
ment. It was about this time that it
was developed that "Van Rennsselaer"
and Hall were/ the same person and
that Hall was his right name. It was
also learned that the young man is the
son of B. M. B. Hall, president of the
Perth-Amboy Terra Cotta Company of
New York City, and that he had bepn
sent out here by his father to look
after a contract which that firm has
for supplying the terra cotta decorative
work on the Fairmount Hotel.
HAlAi CAXXOT BE FOUXD.
HANDS OVER CHECKS.
The police are on a hunt for a young
man who has lately been staying at
the Palace and Occidental hotels under
different names and incidentally ob
taining money on checks drawn upon
local banks that hold no money to his
credit. At the Occidental he was regis
tered as "James R. Van Rensselaer"
of New York and at the Palace the
name which he inscribed on the reg
ister was James B. Hall.
As "Van Rensselaer" he made his
appearance at the Occidental some
time ago and soon confided to the
clerks, one of whom he readily recog
nized as an old school chum in the
East, that he was a member of the
old New York family of. Van Renssel
aer. His reason for being on the coast,
he explained to the hotel people and
other he met, was that his father a
former prominent architect of New
York, who had received the conttact
for the structural work on the new
Fairmont Hotel, had died and he had
been compelled to come to San Fran
cisco to take charge of the plans.
Doctor A. "W., Martin, an aged physi
cian, and his wife, who have resided
for some time at 311 Leavemvorth
street, had a narrow escape from being
asphyxiated in their rooms early last
evening. Dr. Martin is Interested in
several mining properties and "has re
; tired from the practice of his profes
sion. Soon after dinner he and his
'wife repaired to their apartments at
their usual early hour.
Doctor Davis, who resides in the
house, on returning home shortly after
8 o'clock, detected the odor of gas and
on investigating found that it was
coming from Dr. Martin's apartments.
He knocked at the door and receiving
no response called the landlord, C. F.
Howe, and together they forced an en
trance to the room. The aged couple
were found unconscious and the room
was filled with gas. A call was sent
to the Central Emergency Hospital
and Dr. Martin and his wife were hur
ried there for treatment. A few min
utes after their arrival they regained
consciousness and Dr. Miiher. who
treated them, pronounced them out of
danger.
At first it was supposed that the
couple had attempted to commit sui
cide. The key in the door was turned
so that it could not be forced out from
the outside and firmly wedged with a
pencil. Tha doctor and his wife, how
ever, denied emphatically any attempt
atf self-destruction and said that thoir
condition was simply due to the acci
dental turning on of the gas. r
