The concerns of Sutter Brothers and

the former injured the credit of the latter
to such an extent that It was deemed ad
visable to turn the property over to the
care of the United States District Court,
so that all creditors might be treated
alike. The liabilities of the firm are es

REBELS NEAR
THE BRODER
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â The marriage of
Hiss May Goelet, only daughter of Mrs.
Ogflen Goelet and one of the richest of
American heiresses, to Henry John Innes-
Ker. eighth Duke of Roxburghe, was sol
erarlzed to-day in St. Thomas Church in
this city. Bisbcp William Croswell Doane
of Albany, insisted by the Rev. Ernest
M. Stires of St. Thomas Church, per
formed the ceremony. A company of I'M
quests â a small number for an interna
tional marriage cf such importanceâwit
nessed the ceremony, but masses of
palms, 6hrubs and flowers banked the
church bo effectively that the great nave
seemed far from empty. In the chancel
ltsctf, where the ceremony took place,
palm5, Japanese chrysanthemums and
English primroses were combined in an
artistic color scheme, with which the or
chids on tha pulpit ar.d the lilies about
the altar toned beautifully.
Forming In the outer vestibule of the
church, the bridal party proceeded down
the aisle to the chancel steps, the bride
en the arm. of her brother. Robert Goelet.
She was gowned In white satin, veiled
with pcint Valenciennes lace and trimmed
with wreaths of orange blossoms. Her
\f'A was of tulle and she carried an old
fashioned bouquet cf lilies of thÂ» valley.
ATTENDANTS OF BBIDE.
The n-aid of honor. Miss Beatrice Mills,
end tho other bridesmaids. Lady Isabel
Innes-Ker, Miss Martha Johnston, Miss
illice Babcock. Miss Marian Haven, Miss
Therese Ise-lin, Hiss Nina Thayer of Bos
lin and Miss Pauline Whittier, wore
gowr.s of pink mousseline de soje of the
quaint and effective Louis XVI period,
embroidered with ecru lace, tcques of pink
velvet trimmed with lace and sable, and
carried, in place cf bouquets, muffs of
pink velvet and sÂ«.ble. The ushers, Hugo
Barlr.g, Howard Brassey, Robert Whar
tcn Goelet, Rogers Wir.throp, Henry Bull
end William Woodward, did not precede
the bridal party, as customary, but were
seated before the bride entered.
At the chancel steps the bride was met
by the Duke and his best man, the Hon.
Reginald Ward, son of the late Earl of
Dudley, and the betrothal service of the
Protestant Episcopal church was read by
Hr. Stlres. The party then advanced to
the altar rail, where the Episcopal mar
riage ceremony was eaid by Bishop
Doane.
Afterwacd the Duke and Duchess went
to the heme of Mrs. Ogden Goeiet on
Fifth avenue, where an informal recep
tion, to which or.ly a part cf the wedding
guests were bidden, v.as held.
The Duke and Duchess left the Goelet
residence In a carriage, to which at the
last moment a long white streamer was
attached by the ushers, and drove to the
Grand Central station, where they en
tered a private car attached to the 5
o'clock express for Newport.
HOB BLOCKS THE STREET.
Fifth avenue In the vicinity of the
church was the scene of extreme disorder,
unparalleled at any of the previous wed
dings in New York. From the church to
the Goelet residence, a distance of five
blocks, the avenue contained a surging
mob cumbering fully 10,000 persons, most
ly women, whom a force of 2000 policemen
were powerless to hold back.
Before the service began several promi
r.ent women gained entrance to the
church and seated themselves In the gal
leries, from which they were forcibly dis
lodged by a squad cf police a few min
utes before the arrival of the trifle.
When the carriage containing the
bride-to-be and her brother, Robert Goe
let, reared the church it was surrounded
Ly women, who 6topped the horses and. in
their efforts to 6ee the bride, clung to the
carriage^ some of them getting on the
steps and thrusting their heads into the
cpen windows. Goelet called to the police,
but It was some moments before the half
<!czcn policemen who rushed to the rescue
were able to drive the curious women
back and enable the carriage to proceed.
CEAWL UNDER CANOPY.
When the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. Cor
nelius Vanfierbilt, which was just ahead
cf the bride, reached the canopy leading
from the curb to the church the crowd
of women .banked up twenty-five feet
<leej> on cither side," rushed frantically
forward, carrying the solid lines of po
licemen with them, and for a moment
blocked the entrance. They were forced
back, only to rush forward again when
the bride's carriage drew up. By this
time policemen from other points had
been collected there, but in spite of them
a croup of a half dozen women stooped
down and lifted the canvas of the canopy
end crawled part way under. They crawl
ed to their positions, notwithstanding all
the efforts of the police to pull them
away, and several of them managed to
keep their heads under the canvas until
The works of the Amalgamated Copper
Company will at once resume operations
in various parts of the State. This in
cludes the great mines in Butte, the
emelters of the Washoe Companj%in Ana
conda, the largest In the world; the smelt
ers of the Boston and Montana Company
in Great Falls, also vast in their capac
ity; the coal mines at Stoors, Belt, Oak
da]Â© and In Wyoming; the great, quarries
in Northern Montana and the" Immense
lumbering industries in Western and
Northwestern Montana.
Probably more than 15,000 men will be
employed directly in the propertiesof the
Amalgamated, and as many more will be
given employment in the way of furnish
ing supplies and the like.
Upon this announcement by Judge Clan
cy. President William Scallon of the Ana
conda Copper Mining Company and gen
eral manager of the Amalgamated issued
orders to shut down all of the Amalga
mated properties In Montana and else
where.
1 at Helena. The purpose
of the session Is to pass laws that will
relieve the Industrial condition in Mon
tana, where by the shutting down of the
Amalgamated Company's properties 15,000
men are directly thrown out of work, 15,
0C0 more affected and the whole State is
suffering from the suspension of work.
Recently in Butte Judge William Clancy
of the District Court gave a decision in
which he said that he might appoint a
receiver at any time for the Boston and
Montana Company, one of the largest con
stituent companies of the Amalgamated.
The decision was made on the application
of John MacGlnnlss, a prominent holder
of stock in the companies controlled by
F. August Heinze and the Montana Pur
chasing Company, which has been at war
with the Amalgamated for years.

Special Dispatch to The Call. x
â¢nr ASHINGTOX, Nov. 10.â
h| JhJ m The orders- Issued by
U /I / the Navy Department to
m^ l^r prevent Colombian
j j troops embarking â¢ for
isthmian ports were
changed to-day as the result of a con
clusion reached at the regular meeting
of the President and his Cabinet that
such prevention would be an act of war
against Colombia. In consequence the
naval commanders in isthmian waters
were notified to use only moral suasion
to induce the Colombian troops not to
start for the isthmus,. Should an . at
tempt to land them at either. Panama or
Colon be made, however, the naval com
manders will have full authority to go
to extremes.
News came to the State Department
yesterday that two British merchant
steamers, one the Quito and the other
the Mindanao, or a name similar to that,
were to be used by the Colombian Gov
ernment to carry troops to the isthmus
from Buena Ventura, the nearest Pacific
port to Bogota. Orders were according
ly sent to Commander Dlehl of the
cruiser Boston to go to Buena Ventura
and warn the British ships and the com
mander of the troops to be embarked
that the vessels could .not leave port
with the troops aboard. These orders
were sent last night or this morning. As
changed to-day they provide that the
commander of the Colombian troops
about to embark at Buena Ventura and
the masters of the merchantmen shall be
warned that they will not be permitted
to land soldiers at any isthmian port
Those responsible for the changed or
ders heid that while the United States
Government was legally i empowered to
suppress any attempt that would lead to
disorder or bloodshed on the isthmus, it
had no authority toj enter Colombian
ports outside the Isthmus for the purpose
of preventing the embarkation of troops.
The American war vessel sent to give
the warning will stay with the merchant
men if ttfey persist in going to the
isthmus, so as to be close at hand if any
attempt to land soldiers is made.
The Navy Department is advised that
Rear Admiral Glass, commanding the Pa
cific station, arrived at Panama thl3
morning with the cruiser Marblehead and
the gunboat Concord, having made a
quick run from Acapulco. Their consort,
the monitor Wyoming, was" not able to
keep up with the vessels and will, prob
ably not" reach Panama before Thursday.
By.virtue of his rank Admiral Glass will
have ' supreme : command over Â¦ the naval
forces in the vicinity of Panama.

She concluded that she must take
French leave of the institution, that was
practically a prison. The buildings wero
guarded and the windows barred by heavy
gratings. Mrs. Whitney calculated that
she must conduct herself as a model pris
oner. In a short time she knew the
routine of the institution perfectly and
was ready to escape.
The. heavy Bhutters of her first floor
window were fastened by screws. Wait

She knew that at a certain moment tho

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â To-day's ses
sion of the Senate was devoted exclu
sively to the reading of the President's
message In support of reciprocity with
Cuba and to the routine incident to the
receipt of the message. The attendance
of Senators was exceptionally large and
many appeared with great rolls of freshly
prepared bills.
The message received the careful att
tentlon of the Senators, and when its
reading had been finished Cullom of Illi
nois was recognized to move the refer
ence to the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions of the message and the Cuban
treaty,, the text of which had been trans
mitted with the message. This motion
prevailed, and it had no sooner been dis
posed of than, upon motion of Allison,
the Senate adjourned.

Senate will hold Its first meeting to-mor

The foregoing consideration* caused the ne
gotiation of the treaty with Cuba and Its rat
ification by ths Senate. They now, with equal
force, support the legislation by the Congress,
\VÂ« gave her liberty. We are knit to her by
the memories of the blood and the courage of
our soldiers who fought for her In war; by the
memories of the wisdom and Integrity of our
administrators who . saved her in peace - and
who started her so well, on the difficult path
of self-government. We must help her onward
and upward; and, in helping her, wo shall help
ourselves. ' â¢ ' "
Cuba has made great progress since her in
dependence -vu.3 established. 8he haa ad
vanced steadily in every way. 8he already
stands high among ber elster republics of the
new world. ShJ is loyally observing her obli
gations to us, and she is entitled to like treat-'
rnent by us.
The treaty eubmltted to you for approval
secures to the United States economic advan
tages as great as those given to Cuba. Nat an
American interest is sacrificed by thÂ« treaty.
A large Cuban market Is secured to our pro
ducers. It is a market which lies at our doors.
,which Is already large, which Is capable of '
great expansion and which is especially impor
tant to the development of our export trade.*
It. would be indeed short-sighted for us to re
fuse to take advantage of such opportunity
and to force Cuba into making arrangement*
with othÂ«r countries to our disadvantage. .
This reciprocity treaty stands by Itself. It
Is demanded en consideration of broad national
policy, as well as by our economic Interest; It
will do harm to. no industry; It will benefit
many Industries; It is In. the Interest of our
people as a whole, both because of Its impor
tance from the broad standpoint of Interna
tional policy and. because economically it inti
mately concerns us to develop and secure tha
rich Cuban market for our farmers, artisans,
merchants and manufacturers. Finally, It la'
desirable as a Guaranty of the good faith of
our nation toward our - young sister republic,
whose welfare must ever be closely bound with
ours.
ISLAND NATION'S PROGRESS.
Situated as Cuba is, it would not' bo pos
sible for this country to permit the strategics
abuse of the plan by any military power. It
is for this reason that certain limitations have
been imposed upon her financial policy and
that naval stations have been conceded by
her to the United States. Tho negotiations
as to the detal's of those naval stations- are
on the eve of completion. They are so situ
ated as to prevent any Idea that there is the
Intention ever to use them aealnst Cuba, or
otherwise than for the protection of Cuba
from the assaults of foreign foes and for the
better safeguarding of American Interests in
the waters south of us. These Interests have
been largely increased by the consequences of
the war with Spain and will be ctlll further
increased by the building of the Isthmian,
canal. They are both military Â«.nd economic.
The granting to us by Cuba of the naval
stations above alluded to is of the utmost
importance from a military standpoint and is
proof of the good faith with which Cuba is
treating us.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â The
joint committee of the Senate
and House appointed to notify
the President that Congress
was organized and ready to
receive any message he might have to
communicate to it, called at the White
House at 10:30 o'clock this morning to
perform its duty. After greeting the
members of the committee cordially tne
President informed them that he would
communicate with Congress very soon in
writing. Soon afterward the following
message was transmitted to both houses:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I have convened the Congress, that it may con-
Elder the legislation necessary' to put into
operation the commercial treaty with Cuba,
which was ratified by the Senate at its last
Beselon and subsequently by the Cuban Gov
ernment. I deem such legislation demanded
not only by our interest, but by cur honor.
Â¦\Ve cannot with propriety abandon the course
upon which we have eo wisely embarked.
When the acceptance of the Platt amend
ment was required from Cuba by the action
Of the Congress of the United States this
Government thereby definitely committed Itself
to the policy of treattnc Cuba as occupying a
unique position as regards this country. It
was Drovidcd that when the island became a
free and independent republic she should stand
In such close relations with the United States
as in certain respects to come within our sys
tem of International policy; and it necessarily
followed that she must also, to a certain de
gree, become included within the lines of our
economic policy.
All of these nominations are original
appointments. In addition many reoess
appointments were sent to the Senate.
These Include Foreign Ministers, Consuls,
judicial, army and navy promotions, and,

GRIST OF APPOINTMENTS.
President Submits Nominations to
the Upper House.
The President to-night had a conference
with 'a number of leaders in both houses
of Congress. Those who called on him at
the White House were Secretary Moody;
Speaker Cannon, Senators Allison, Aid
rich, Platt of Connecticut, Spooner, Han
na. Hale, Lodge and Wetmore, and Rep
resentatives Payne, Dalzell, Tawney and
Hemenv/ay.
The old controversy between the House
and Senate over the right of the former
to initiate all revenue legislation was the
"principal topic â¢ of conversation. The
members of the House claimed that the
present Cuban treaty provided that dur
ing the life of the convention the duty
on sugars should not be reduced "either
by treaty or convention. To concede the
position to the Senate, they asserted,
would be a surrender of their constitu
tional powers.
It was said that unless the contention
of the House is admitted the same dif
ficulty -will be presented as at the last
session, with the probability of the meas
ure being defeated. No conclusion waa
reached by the conference.
I transmit herewith the treaty as amended
by the Senate and ratified by the Cuban Gov
ernment. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

ARGENTINA RECEIVES -
SHIPMENT OF CATTLE

Prevails Here.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.â The Secre
tary Of Agriculture to-day announced
that the last shipment of cattle from
country to Argentina had been ad
mitted into that country without deten
lon. The action Is Interpreted by the de
partment as evidence that the Argentina
Government is satisfied that the efforts
of this Government to suppress the foot
and mouth disease, in this country fcave
been thoroughly successful and that .aere
is no danger of importing that disease
through . shipments of cattle through this
country.
The Department of Agriculture places
no credence In the allegation that th.e
cattle of the previous shipment, slaugh

ter, especially the method of disposing of

House Does Little Beyond Receiving
President's Message.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10âThe House
was in session less than half an hour to
day, an adjournment being taken out of
respect to the memory of two deceased
members. The President's message was
read and referred to the Committed on
Ways and Means, the membership of
which is yet to be announced. The mes
sage also was ordered printed. The
Speaker announced the Committee on
Rules and Mileage. Aside from making
provision for the payment of mileage of
members no further business Â¦was trans
acted.
The President's message was received
with applause from the Republican side.
Following Its reading the Speaker an
nounced the following committees:
On rulesâ The Speaker, Dalze'.l of Penn
sylvania, Grosvenor of Ohio. Williams of
Mississippi, De Armond or Missouri.
Mileageâ Reeder of Kansas, Jackson of
Maryland, Flack of New York, Repub
licans, and Louis of Georgia and Butler of
Missouri, Democrats.
Resolutions of respect to the memory of
Foerderer of Pennsylvania and Boreing
of Kentucky were adopted and as another
mark of respect the House adjourned.
Speaker Cannon has reappolnted Ascher
C. Hinds of Maine as clerk to the Speak
er's table. He has selected L. W. Busby,
correspondent of the Chicago Inter Ocean,
as private secretary to tho Speaker.
In- his letter to this department relative to
the slove contract the Secretary of War sub
mitted the single question, whether In a casÂ«
where a contract had been performed on both
sides and it subsequently appeared prima facia
that a member of Congress was interested In
such contract, money paid by the Government
In consideration therefor could bÂ« recovered.
The Question submitted for my opinion in
volved the Just interpretation of the words in
section 3739. Revised Statutes, which reads as
follows: 'And whenever any sum of money
is advanced on the part of the United State.".
In consideration of such contract or agreement.
it shall be forthwith caid and in case of re
fusal or delay to repay the same when de
manded by tho proper officer of the department
under whose authority such contract or agree
ment shall have been made or entered Into,
every person so refusing or delaying tOK*th*r
with his sureties, shall be forthwith prose
cuted at law fcr the recovery of any such sura
of money so advanced."
In my reply I advised the Secretary of ar
that no part of the consideration could be re
covered. Th!s was all the Secretary of TVar
askÂ»d me to decide. ThÂ« question whether llr.
Littauer was interested In the contracts under
consideration was not submitted for decision
and I did not pans upon It. directly or indi
rectly. Nor was it necessary for me to deter
mine that fact, as in any view of the case, in
my opinion, the money paid by the Government
could not have been recovered.
No further action could have been taken by
this department in the premises unless the data
transmitted disclosed a case for criminal prose
cution under section .TTK> of the Revised Stat
utes In examinirR the record we were met at
the threshold with the fact that the transac
tions under consideration were closed more than
four years ago. which fact would operate as a
bar to any prosecution, even if the statute had
been violated.
I must therefore. In harmony with the -uni
form practice or this office, decline to reopen
the case as you request.
I may ndd In conclusion that I Â»m tinaoia tr>
see how Mr. Littauer can fÂ«el aggrieved by my
action as I have already said as plainly am I
know how. and I now repeat that I have not
passed upon or even considered, directly or In
directly, the question whether he was inter
ested In the sense contemplated by the statute.
In Lyons' contract with the Government. In
fact if I bad done Â«o. I would, as alreaflr
pointed out, have gone beyond my duty In the
premlBes. - _ :
In the course of his reply, declining to
reopen, thÂ© case, the Attorney General
says:
It is upon Mr. Littauer' a entire Innocence
of even a technical breach of law that wÂ«
take our stand reirardlcaa of ctvll or criminal
remedies or technical defenses. He has not
invoked and dees rot Invoke tha statute o* lim
itations and would certainly waive it It he
had tho rrlvllegr. I sincerely hope that you
will be able to Â»ee your way to reopen the case
that Mr. Littauer and I may be heard on the
subject. â¢ ,

occurred recently at Baltimore soon af
ter his initiation 'into a Greek letter fra
ternity, says ho has received detaCs ot
the affair from. & student. The latter de
clares that when Loew went to th# fra
ternity hall to take the first degree ho
was met by twenty-five men. He was
told to undress and after doing so wa3
Blindfolded and taken into a room, where
he was laid upon a cake of ice. He was
then carried upstairs to the balcony and
thrown over the railâ a drop of twenty
five feet. On the floor beneath stood a
number of students holding a sheet.
"When Loew fell Into this." said thÂ«
doctor, "he was tossed up and down un
til he was unconscious. After being re
vived he was beaten until his body was a
mass of bruises.
"That night he was in such a wretched
condition that his roommate stayed up
all night with him. Whisky and quinine
were- given him. during the night, and In
the morning he felt relieved.
"The following Saturday he took thÂ«
second degree. In the morning he was
found dead and his chum, who bad just
taken the first degree, was in a serious
condition. The guilty ones should be sent
to the gallows. They are murderers."

It was left to the manager to take up
th# matter of having a turnstile in the
exhibition hall of the board to count the
visitors who go there to see the county
products. There were 10,000 visitors to the
hall in October, so Manager Briggs re
ported. Fifty thousand copies of a pam
phlet telling about the climate of all parts
of California, it "was voted, shall be sent
to the fat stock show at Chicago.
On motion of John P. Irish, it was voted
to request Secretary Cortelyou to have
space for a display of California's pro
ducts in the building that will be erected
for the Department of 'Commerce at
Washington.
Resolutions were adopted in memory of
N. W. Spauldinsr, who was a member of
the board at the time of his death.
The board attended to several other
matters. A communication from the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee asking the
board to appoint a member of the ad
visory committee of the Promotion Com
mittee was placed on file and the man
ager was Instructed to write to the man
ager of the committee and say that the
board will extend its aid, as it has to
all-organizations that work for the good
of the State. It was decided to have
the publications of the board, together
with a descriptive sketch of the work of
the board, bound and sent to St. Louis
for exhibition at the exposition.
Concerning the proposition to hold a
citrus fair in this city during the pres
ent month it was decided, in view of the
expense to which the. counties are put
on account of the exhibits they are pre
paring for the St. Louis Exposition, tp
inform the citrus growers north of Te
hachapi that a citrus exhibition will be
made in the permanent display of county
products In the hall of the State Board
of Trade this year and that the annual
November citrus fair will be continued
hereafter.
DECIDE OTHER MATTERS.

twelve Apostles could not be- more honest
than the people who are handling it; if
that be true. - this 13 the best advertise
ment in the world for the State. All you
have to do is to grow the fruit and some
one takes It off your hands. (Laughter.)
If this is the condition of the fruit indus
try of California it is a very hopeful con
dition and it is a commercial one that
the world can't match. It ought to be
of great encouragement to us and we
ought to invite immigration on that fact
alone," (Laughter.)
"And leave thÂ© facts out "of it." Mr.
Wooster facetiously remarked. "The nec
essary thing for us to do is to get the
facts and give them greater publicity.
We know the wrong that is being done.
If we can get at the bottom of it we
should do. so. I move that a report of
progress made be placed on file and that
the committee be empowered to pursue
the inquiry."
The motion was seconded by Commis
sioner Irish and adopted.

THE California State Board of
Trade made some- progress yester
day in the matter of Inaugurating
the Investigation concerning the
returns California fruit-growers
receive for fruits sold in the Eastern and
San Francisco markets. A report was
submitted by General Manager Briggs in
accordance with the instructions of the
board. He estimated that the facts relat
ing to marketing In San Francisco could
be ascertained by a competent man in
thirty days at a cost, of about $150. Re
garding the Eastern markets, he found
that an Investigation could be made there,
during the fruit .shipping season, in not
more than sixty days, which time would
enable the investigator to Inquire into the
methods pursued in each of the several
centers where California fruit is disposed
of at auction. Th" cost for the Eastern
Investigation not estimated. A man
competent to undertake the task would
be worth $200 a month, cr could earn that
much in any fruit house.
After tho report of Manager Briggs had
been received several members of the
Board of Trade spoke emphatically con
cerning the existing conditions. W. H.
Mills declared that the board should con
tinue to search . for the facts that will
benefit the fruit growers. John P. Irish
said that the first step was to secure the
information that would put the board on
the right track. C. M. Wooster epoke to
the same effect. Manager Briggs said
that the board could not afford to let
the investigation drop.
Some additional step may be taken at
the next meeting of the board. Some sur
prise was occasioned before the meeting
closed by a statement by Mr. Briggs that
he desired to retire from office. His rea
son was that he has large interests that
demand much of his time and he is com
pelled to attend to them. The board
thereupon authorized the appointment of
a committee of three to provide for the
appointment of a new manager. In the
meantime Mr. Briggs holds the office.
The work of getting facts concerning the
marketing of fruit will be taken up again
as eoon as a new manager is at work.
BRIGGS MAKES REPORT.
The entire matter was opened up yes
terday by the report submitted by
Manager Briggs. It began with the
resolution adopted at the Octo
ber meeting ofÂ» the board, in which the
manager was instructed "to report to the
board the practicability of Instituting a
general Inquiry Into the fruit markets,
foreign and domestic, with reference to
an ascertainment of all the facts relat
ing to such markets, and especially with
reference to the relation between the
amount returned from the reported sales
of fruit* and the actual amount obtained
from said pales, and further, to the end
that the price paid to the fruit grower
of this State shall more nearly correspond
to the price at which the fruit reaches
the consumer. The manager is requested
to report to the board at its next meet
ing the practicability and cost of such*in
quiry."
Manager Brlggs reported that he had
addressed a letter to all Boards of Trade,
Chambers of Commerce and other com
mercial organizations in the State and
had added an appeal for Information and
assistance in the work. In the appeal
that went out the following was in
cluded:
It has Ions been an established fact that
with eJl the EDlendld reputation of California
fruit in the Eastern market?, the readiness with
which it finds sale and the great wealth which
has been made by those handling it. the grower
has received proportionately but a poor return.
There Is certainly no lack of demand for the
SCENE IN THE ASSEMBLY-ROOM OF THE STATE BOARD OF TRADE YESTERDAY WHEN THE PLANS OF
, THAT ORGANIZATION IN THE MATTER OF LOOKING INTO' THE METHODS OF FRUIT HANDLERS AND
MARKETMEN WERE UNDER DISCUSSION. . , . ' Â¦
.."The price of dried fruit In tho Eastern
market is fixed by the buyer," said Chair
man, Chlpman. '"The commission men arc
the men who buy our dried fruit here and
cell it inrthe East and fix their price "ar
bitrarily. They commence operating be
fore the fruit is ready for the market and
they fix. the rate without regard to what
they, can get for It in the East."..
"A large fruit grower said to me," said
Mr. Mills,. '.'that everything wjls all right
and .that, he had no complaint to make.
I asked Â¦ him what voice he had in fixing
the ' price ' at which his fruit was carried
and f he * said "None whatever.' I asked
him what arrangements he had to make
about having his fruit properly refriger
ated" and- he said .'None.* I asked him
whether he had a voice in saying what
sort 'of 'a* box was used and he replied
'None whatever.' I asked him If he had
a voice in the price at which hla fruit
should be sold and he said 'None what
ever.' 'Even in the price returned to you,'
I ! asked, v and he said 'No, sir.'
/".'Then it Is a fact,' I said, 'you raise
the fruit and until you receive the money
for -it- you have no voice whatever?* and
he asserted that to be the fact. If this
be true,", said Mr. Mills sarcastically, "it
is the -greatest advertisement California
can : get. /When It Is known that; It is all
determined by one sideâ the handlers of
thÂ© fruit; if It is true that the fruit is
well. marketed, it Is of Importance to the
world ' to . know that If we have people
here so honest that they save the grower
"When a grower says it is a good thing
for the Board of Trade to Investigate this
matter he contradicts himself." said Mr.
Mills. "Because If he is satisfied he would
say, 'I 'know all about the marketing of
my fruit. If I were a fruit grower I would
not put myself in antagonism with the
instrumentality for marketing my fruit.
I could be left out There would be plenty
of fruit without mine.' There is therefore
no disposition on the part of the fruit
growers to make themselves obnoxious.
They can't afford to do It. I never ex
pected any information from them. All
my resolution contemplated was to make
this investigation possible."
BOARD DISCUSSES FACTS.
nothing about It. There ought toV>e a fair*
profit to the shippers. They are active
and their profits are increased by the
activity they put forth. What Is the price
of raisins grown at Fresno? You will find
that they are being sold at 12% cents a
pound In San Francisco, and yet at Fres
no they are purchased at 6 cents. Does it
cost 6 cents per pound to distribute them
to the consumer? The system of distri
bution that grows raisins at 6 cents per
pound and sells them at 12^4 cents is not
profitable to the producer."
"You will find raisins exhibited for sale
in the Middle West from 4 cents up to 12%
cents per pound," said Manager Briggs.
"They use the cheaper raisin as a leader
and ' make their profit on the higher
grades. They claim that the poorer con
sumer will not take It unless they can
get It at the cost of other products. They
argue that if dried apples can be had at
4 cents a pound they are entitled to pay
the same price for raisins, and they will
not buy raisins at a higher price."
- "I think the proper thing to do is to find
out what the different in price is In the
Eastern markets," said Mr. Wooster.
"I think w e ought to do it," said Mr.
Sharp. "We sent a man to Hamburg to
Introduce our prunes. What ought to be
done Is. to go on with our investigation."
"We can't afford to let this matter
drop," said Mr. Briggs.. "The eyes of the
consumer and producer of the State are
upon us. I believe if we go at this in an
energetic and conscientious manner some
good will i come in the end."
"This -State of indifference." said'; Mr.
Mills,-"would indicate that the producers
of California .are not particular â¢ about
those who wish to despoil them.; I have
no doubt but. that these wrongs exist;
that the producer â¢ does not j get a proper
return, and that too much of the profit
is wasted 'Â¦ between > the shipper 'and -.the
consumer; I -believe' that we. should by

the Board of Trade of Oakland .was im

made 'of the letter," said Mr. Stearns,
"and sent them . to the newspapers and
to various people and Invited them to're
ply, i I would like to learn- whethar any
replies were received?" ' Â¦> .
With respect to a' more extended inquiry
such as Is involved In Investigating methods
and conditions in the large Eastern markets,
this, it seems to me. is not the proper time of
the year to actively enter on it. The true
methods employed for disposing of consign
ments of fruit at auction sales and the prac
tice which obtains could, it seems to me, be
best learned by coming In dally contact with
that | business. A man competent to-do that
work and who would do it as it should be done
could easily command- a salary of $200 per
month or more in any fruit house where his
cervices were employed. In other words that
branch of the Inquiry would cost a good sal
ary and all traveling and Incidental expenses
during the service, and a thorough canvass
nilBht take some months If carried into more
than one large distributing market. It is how
ever, possible that the situation in one 'would
be taken as representative of all the Eastern
markets. In which event possibly thirty at the
outside sixty, days would be all the time re
quired. ...
It has been suggested o\'er and over -again
that a remedy for the wrongs complained of in
the local > market might be found through a
corporation composed wholly of producers who

fruits. Whether this Is practical or not it Is
for tho board to consider.
gether with his traveling and Incidental ex
penses. To do this work properly an experi
enced and tactful. man must be employed.
This one step accomplished. It would then re
main to be determined. If wrongs were found
to exist, what further steps were Justified. The
cost of canvassing the local or San Francisco
market would.be but. trifling as compared with
other branches of the work should It be under
taken. Probably thirty days' canvass of this
city by a competent man would disclose all
that is necessary to be learned here In order to
establish a fairly correct basis to work on.
Tills expenditure should not exceed $150. While
the opportunities in the present slack fruit
market are not .as good as they could be in the
height of the fruit season an Inquiry properly
conducted . even, now should not be barren . of.
results.
In reference" to the matter of getting tho
necessary information on which to base intelli
gent action, there seems now but one 'effective
way for accomplishing it. viz: to send an agent
or agents through -the fruit- shipping districts,
whose duty.lt U to work out and record facts
and conditions as they are. This would entail

work in hand. Regarding the'question of

CITRUS FRUIT GUARDED.
It Is claimed that under the cyeration of
the organization known a a the California Fruit
Distributors, of which Alden Anderson la
manager, there- Is small opportunity for the
practice of sharp methods by commission men
engaged in the fruit auction business. This
organization Is a stock company In which both
shippers ami producers are represented, â¢ and
fruit growers either large or Emiill are not
excluded from the list ot stockholders. This
would seem to be a step toward co-operation
and in an effective and practical - way. I To
what extent growers have taken advantage of
this closer Identity with, the shipping and
handling of fruit I have not been informed
Extracts from letters received by the
manager were read. They contained no
definite information. Mr. Brlggs said that
he had learned from parties well Informed
in the Kreen fruit business that during
the last two seasons there has been much
less occasion for complaint concerning the
manner of handling fruit than there had
been formerly. Continuing, he said:
If this indicates Indifference I on the part
of growers little will be accomplished by con
tinuing this method of investigation. Â¦ If It'
Is due to a fear that information xlven may
in some way work to their disadvantage in
the future with buyers or shippers of green
fruit 1 am not -now able to see what argument
can be used effectively with them.
With respect to commercial organizations I
am unable to understand why information
should be withheld it they have any to give.
It is b^st accounted for probably on the theory
that what is everybody's business is nobody's,
and by the further consideration that specific
Information is not readily obtainable by them.
With tbe interior press there may or may
not be weighty considerations which It could
be difficult for the. members of the board to
understand why if any general and previous
wrong exists In the manner of handling fruit,
and they have knowledge of it, the fact should
not be made known. â¢-
Up to date the responses had been
meager. "No information," reported
Manager Brig-gs, "has been received from
individuate, commercial bodies or the
press that even remotely established a
fact." This occasioned surprise to the
manager, and he remarked:

It is known that Morgan has felt keen

Even should he make up his mind to

The trial of the 525,000 breachjof prom

David 'Neeley, the wealthy 'Berkeley nur

to-day. .;
The plaintiff nursed Neeley's wife prior
to her death and it is alleged he became
enamored of her ; charms. According to
the plaintiff's story she was to wait a
year before he would legally make her
his wife and publicly proclaim it to the
world, as he had scruples as to the pro
priety of marrying in haste.
Mrs. Neeley died on June 13, 1901. The
son born to the plaintiff is now a bounc

that the putative father still refuses to
keep his alleged promise .to marry her.
She has tired of waiting: and now wants
$25,000 as balm for her disappointment as
the result of her misplaced confidence.
Neeley was In court to-day and took
considerable interest In the proceedings.

Thomas Ledyard Near
Century Mark When
Death Comes.
Last night his condition was no worse
than it had been for several days, but
something caused him to suddenly move
and begin to turn over. Before' his rela
tives realized it death had resulted. TKe
doctors say that in moving he increased
the dislocationâ in fact, again broke his
neck.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â An effort to
turn over in bed last night caused the
almost instant death of Walter Lang
worthy. Had he remained, still, as he
had been ordered to do by his physicians,
ha might still be living; in fact, the doc
tors say .ha had an excellent chanco of
ultimate recovery, despite the fact that
he was suffering from a broken neck.
Langworthy was a carpenter, and more
than two weeks ago while shingling a
house he fell and dislocated the vertebra
at the joint Just above the shoulders. The
pressure upon the spinal cord caused pa
ralysis of. nearly the entire body, and the
doctors said he would die in- a day. He
asked -to be taken home to die and tbat
was done. . z. , , - 1.
To the amazement of tha physicians, he
began to" Improve, the paralysis partfaliy
disappeared, showing that the tension on
the muscles was gradually lessening the
dislocation. The case was watched with
interest by a number of physicians arid
they agreed that if .Langworthy was kept
perfectly quiet he had a chance of recov
ering.
Special Dispatch to 'The CalL
"I am the only Harrington la the Oak
land postofflce," continued he, "and this
letter is plainly and clearly addressed to
me as any one can see. If It is a case
of mistaken identity the man who gets
the draft will 'have to make a strong
showing on the question as to tho woman
that bought it."
Harrington waited until the Union Na
tional Bank opened this morning and
went there to ascertain what were the
circumstances of the Issuance of the pa
per. Cashier Palmer's story only in
creased the mysterious features and left
both banker and postal official in the air.
The banker had no means of knowing
what the "unknown" was and could shed
but little llsht on the transaction. Ha
recalled the fact that the two women had
bought the certificate, because he remem
bered the circumstance of the refusal of
the purchaser to Identify herself with the
certificate. Further than that ho could
say nothing.
Cashier Palmer was ready to cash tha
certificate as soon as Harrington pre
sented It." but the superintendent was not
ready to taka the coin, as he desired first
to know whence, from whom, and for
what reason It was sent to him.
"I have had some queer experiences In
my time," said Harrington, "but this Is
somewhat unusual, to say the least. I
do not object to the money coming my
way, but when weeping women, who will
not disclose their Identity, arÂ© tangled up
In It I want to know a little something
about it."
Harrington said he has set an Investi
gation, going In the hope of clearing up
the mystery, but ha thinks his chance*
are somewhat remote.
HARRINGTON SHIES.
"There it is, made out to 'unknown.'
Who that 'unknown' is I am not pre
pared to say, for I have not any way of
discovering just now."
"I thought It was a 'fake' advertise
ment," said Superintendent Harrington
to-day. "But my name caught my eye
before I started to destroy the paper, and
then I read It carefully. Of course it did
not require a second reading to discover
that this was apparently a genuine draft
for $130. but strange to say 1 have not
been able to get the slightest clew to tha
sender. .â¢ .
Opening the envelope. Superintendent
Harrington found the certificate and
nothing else. His first Impulse as he
glanced at the unfolded paper and saw
the inscription, "unknown," at tho top
line was to tear it up and throw it away.
Cashier Palmer drew out a certificate
book and started to fill out tha sheet.
He lnaulred In whose name he should
draw the certificate of deposit. The weep
ing woman answered that sha did not
desire her name to appear on the paper.
But the cashier insisted that this was
quite an unusual method and he again
requested that a name be given. Hia cus
tomer repeated that she would not hava
her name written on the certificate, so
Cashier Palmer desisted, and noted that
the certificate was drawn by "unknown. '
But the mysterious patron knew In
whose favor she desired the certificate
drawn and she did not hesitate when
asked to sign a payee's name. It was
"Charles Harrington" and so it appears
on the document as Superintendent Har
rington received it last evening through
the United States malls.
After the women left the bank that day
nothing more was heard nor seen of the
certificate until Harrington got an en
velope addressed to him at the Oakland
postofllce. It was a plain, white com
mercial size envelope, the address being
In a conventional and uncharacteristic
hand, which might have been written by
a man or a woman. There was apparent
ly no attempt to disguise the chirography.
The envelope bore postmark of yesterday,
exactly a week after the certificate was
issued.

"The Stanford fellows wouldn't give up
the ax when we wanted it," said Miller,
"and so we Just took it away from them.
It was a hard fight, but we won. 'Billy'
Drumm, the sprinter, got away with it at
last and after going In a roundabout way
we managed to get back to Berkeley."
Everett Brown, who helped get away
with the ax, gave a few more of the de
tails of the capture. He oaid he didn't
know whether he was a hero or a rogue,
but if he was a rogue he liked the punish
ment.
The "rooters" then formed another ser
pentine and escorted Heitmuller and the
ax to the gymnasium stepo, where there
was more yelling and more speeches.
Clinton Miller, who helped to purloin the
ax, told all about how it was done and
put in some touches that made everybody
laugh.
The revered weapon -first came down the
football field In the arms of "Ovle" Over

whose wake trailed the band and. a long
line of rollicking, roysterlng students,

looked a little the worse for. wear, for
its long wooden arm was Ions ago cut

but decrepit^as it was it furnished enough

Captain Overall made a little speech be

a safe place and now was glad to bring
it out into the light again and turn it

Epecial ZMrpatch to T!.e Call.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 10.â A warrant was
Fworn out to-night for Apostle Heber J.
Grant of the Mormon church, charging
unlawful cohabitation with two wives. At
a late hour a deputy Eheriff was hunting
for the apostle, who apparently had
hoard of the proposed prosecution and
taken to hiding.
The case is the first of a number likely
to be brought to prove that polygamy still
< x'.s'f in Utah and to affect the seating
tif Senator Reed Smoot, .a fellow apostle
of Heber J. Grant. The warrant was
sworn out by Charles Mostyn Owen, who
Teas active in the prosecutions at the time
of the Brlgham H. Roberts case. He has
I'^rn in the employ of the persons con
ducting the anti-polygamy crusade.
The allegation is that Grant has been
living with two wives, Augusta Winters
Grant and Emily Wells Grant, the latter
a sister of Governor Heber M. Wells. The
warrant charges that the offense was
committed on October 6 of this year and
thereafter.
Grant was married in November, 1871,
to Lucy Stringham. who died in 1890. He
married Augusta Winters on May 6, 1SS4,
redding her legally after hia first wife
died. In 1S87 he married Emily Wells In
Manasseh. Colo. A child was born to her
in 1&99 and in that same year Apostle
Grant was convicted of unlawful cohabi
tatlon and fined Jioo. For two years he has
been <t missionary in Japan. A few
days ago, after his return to Utah, he
addressed a body of students and boasted
cf the fact that he had two wives and
would take another If h* dared. He was

WEDDING THE RESUI/T
OF STREET CAR ROMANCE
GrandFon cf Pio Pico Marries Youi:Â£
Daughter of Chicago Manu
facturer.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â As a result of
a trivial street car accident two weeks
ago, followed by a courtship, most of
which occurred on a street car, Miss
Anna Thorne, daughter of a Chicago
manufacturer, and who is said to be
wealthy In her own right, to-night be
came the bride of Wesley Henry Pico,
grandson of General Pio Pico, the last
Mexican Governor of California before
the American occupation.
The bridegroom has been for years a
conductor on the lines of the Los Angeles
Railway Company and the bride came
here about a month ago with her mother
to spend the winter. While she was rid
ing on his car there was a slight colli
sion, in which she was thrown oft her
seat.
Pico picked her up and expressed such
solicitude for her safety that she was at r
tracted to him. She sought him out the
next day to thank him and spent an hour
or more on his car.- Â¦ . ";Â¦Â»
That was the beginning of the court
ship, and almost every day thereafter s,he
rode on that car and whenever he could
spare, a moment they conversed. The
culmination came to-night, when the cou
ple secured a license just before the court
house closed and, going- to .the residence
of Justice Pearce, were married without
any of their friends being the wiser until
after the ceremony. They will now go
to Chicago arid will probably reside-there.-

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 10.â The
Germanic Museum at Harvard Univer
sity, proposed years ago by eminent Ger
man-Americans'and fostered by Emperor
William of Germany and by Prince Henry
of Prussia, was dedicated to-day. Within
the museum are valuable gifts from Em
|jeror William, Princa Henry and other
distinguished Germans. The gifts were
presented formally to-day at the univer
sity and too German Museum Associa
tion by Baron von Dem Busscho-Hadden
liausen, first secretary of the first German
embassy at Washington, and accepted by
President Elliot on the part of the uni
versity, by Professor Kuno Francke
for the museum and by Hon. Carl Schurz
for the association.
Baron von Dem Bussche-Haddenhausen,
who represented Emperor William in the
absence of the German . Embassador,
Uaron Vernberg, made the following im
portant statement:
I am happy to couplo -with this formal pre
sentation of the Emperor's gift thÂ« announce
ment of two other gifts which are about to
be made to Harvard University. A year ago
last April, after the friendly reception of his
Koyal Highness Prince Henry of Prussia by
the people of the United .States, there was
formed in Berlin a committee of leading men
of* telence. art. literature and finance with
the view of supplementing the Emperor's do
nation by a gift from the Gorman people. The
committee decided upon a collection of galvan
oplastic reproductions of representative Ger
man gold and silver work from the twelfth to
the end of the sixteenth century. This costly
collection, consisting of more than thirty large
and sonie twenty smaller pieces, all of them
epecimens of the best workmanship of those
centuries. Is now marly completed and I have
been authorized on this date that before the
fnd of the year this gift of the Emperor will
be in the possession of Harvard University.
It Is moÂ«t gratifying that still another side
of German life Is to be represented by a gift
which comes from your own midst. I refer
to tbe mwt welcome addition of the 10,000
books on the hinory of Germany and Oerman
civilization which Professor- Archibald Carey
Cuoledge Is to make to Harvard College as a
memorial to the visit of Prince Henry of
Prussia to tiie university in 1902. Ills Majesty
the Emperor, as well as his Royal Highness
Prince Henry, Â«re greatly pleased with this
thoughtful recognition of their interest In the
cause which brings us to gether here to-day,
and I have the honor of being the messenger
of their appreciation and thanks.
President Elliot, responding in behalf of
the university, referred to the "generous
and suggestive act of his Majesty, the
German Emperor," and said: "That act
was uniQue in the history of this uni
versity and, indeed, in the history of edu
cation."
BERLIN. Nov. 10.â An exhibition was
opened to-night at the Museum, of Indus
trial Art of the objects to be presented
to Harvard's Germanic Museum as sup
plemental to Emperor William's gifts.
The collection is the results of the ef
forts of Professor Kuno Franke of Har
vard University In interesting German
artists, scientists and capitalists in the
Germanic Museum as a means of display
ing the fatherland's art treasures in the
United States and strengthening the ties
between the two countries. The money
required was quietly collected and the
Royal MuseUm of Industrial Art" was in
trusted to carry out the wishes of the
giver?? It was decided to select the gold
smith's work of the twelfth to the seven
teenth centuries for illustration, and imi
tations of fifty-three cups of various de
signs, vases and dishes were made by an
electroplating process to compose the
gift. The articles chiefly are from the
work of Nuremburg and Augsburg
goldsmiths of the period when this art
was at maturity. Many of these objects
now are in possession or princely houses,
municipalities and museums. Emperor
William has permitted the reproduction
of several of the finest pieces in his col
lection, including the so-cailed Emperor's
cup of the sixteenth century by Wenzel
Jamitzar of Nuremburg. The Kings of
Wurttemberg and Saxony also have per
mitted copies to be made of some of their
treasures. The largest group consists of
sixteen pieces from the town hall of L/une
berg, now In possession of the Berlin Mu
seum. Among the famous pieces are the
60-called Landschadenbund cup from the
museum of Graz, the Luther cup, pre
sented to the rerormer upon his marriage
by the Wittemberg Town Council, and the
Corvinus cup, which King Corvinus of
Hungary presented to the Vienna Council
of 1642. These reproductions are so suc
cessful that an expert scarcely can de
tect the difference from the originals.
Tho collection will remain on exhibition
here for a week and will be sent to Har
vard In a fortnight.

CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â A strong . plea for
the adoption of reciprocal free trade
in natural products between tho United
States and Canada was made by John
Charlton, member of the- Canadian Par
liament for North Norfolk, North On
tario, to-night at a banquet given by the
Illinois Manufacturers' Association.
Charlton declared that the continuance of
present Canadian tariff conditions could
only be retained by Important tariff con
cessions by the United States. Charlton
said:
Free trade in natural products is beyond
question fully earned by Canadian tariff con
ditions. The sooner it Is arranged the better
for tha interests of both countries. The pres
ent Etate of trade relations in assured. The
Alaskan boundary dispute presents Itself as a
disturbing element in its Influence on public
opinion and finds the Canadian ready to dis
play temper over what he believes to have
been a sacrifice of his rights. The tirna is
now ripe for the display of a liberal â¢ spirit' on
the part of the United States.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9, 1903.â
We are permitted this week to record
the recovery of Mr. William Pettit of
1240 Mission street, known in business
circles in this city. He was failing, and
as the disease was of a progressive char-
acter an examination was made by his
physicians, who discovered that it was
diabetes, and told him he could not get
well. He put himself on the Fulton
Compound, has recovered and now per-
mits this announcement. To now meet
him on the street one would never sus-
pect he had ever had a supposedly in-
curable disease. .
Mr. R. Petry of 842 Oak street, Ala-
meda, also permits us to refer to his
case. He is connected with the Mc-
Nicoll Elevator Works of this city.
Eight months ago progressive emacia-
tion developed. He grew so weak that
he was unable to carry all his tools.
When he had lost twenty pounds the
symptoms were all so suggestive of
Bright's Disease that friends urged Ful-
ton's Compound. He is now on his
ninth week of the treatment and reports
the total disappearance of all the symp-
toms and that he has regained his nor-
mal weight and strength and is well
again.

Apparently the three highwaymen de
cided that everybody on the train had
been alarmed and that robbery would be
Impossible, for they disappeared and the
train moved forward at once.
The man who had followed the brake
man then seized Rodenhaver by the
throat and pointed a revolver at his face,
sayine:
"You go back and tell your partner and
the conductor not to come ahead. We
will look after this end. of the train."
The highwayman then demanded that
Rodenhaver hand over his money. The
brakeman declared that he had no money.
The robber then demanded the railroad
man's watch. Rodenhaver declared that
he had only a cheap watch. The highway
man then ordered the brakeman back to
the rear end and as Rodenbaver started
two shots were fired behind him. One of
the men on the blind baggage had .gone
forward and had covered Fireman James
Linn with a revolver. Conductor J. R.'
Smith of Spokane, who was In charge of
the train, was coming forward on the op
posite side with orders for the engineer
when the two shots were flred. The two
men from the front end of the train halted
him by shooting at the ground In front of
his feet.
The highwaymen were discovered on the
train by the head brakeman, J. E. Roden
haver of Spokane. His attempt to put
the men off the train precipitated the
shooting and foiled the plans of the rob
bers. The train pulled westward imme
diately following the shooting, leaving the
highwaymen behind.
At Jocko, Rodenhaver discovered a man
riding on the trucks beneath the express
car and ordered him off. As the brake
man proceeded forward this man followed
him. Arriving at the tender the brake
man discovered two men riding on the
blind baggage. The brakeman ordered
these men down and they refused to
move. Rodenhaver then declared that he
would shoot unless they left the train at
once. ....

PORTLAND, Nov. 10.â Attorneys are
preparing papers In a suit to be Instituted
against the Southern Pacific Company by
the lumbermen of Portland to compel that
company to furnish cars for the trans
portation of products of the mills. This
step was decided upon after a number of
mill men had talked the situation over
yesterday.
As many as 800 loaded cars are said to
have been standing on sidetracks during
the past few weeks and have not been
started for their destinations owing to
the lack of motive power on the road.
The present car shortage has worked
hardships upon many of the mills and
repeated requests for relief have failed
to bring about any change. As a result
the lumbermen have reached the con
clusion that "patience ceases to be a
virtue" and the suit will be entered within
the next ten days in the names of all the
lumber firms in the citj* and a number
along the line of the Southern Pacific.
One of the charges will be discrimina
tion. Some of the lumber comoanles in
Southern Oregon are alleged to be regu
larly favored by the road In the matter
of cars being furnished as they are de
sired and quickly dispatched. The recent
increase in freight rates from Portland
to California points will be Included in
the complaint. Under present conditions
there is a rate of 37 cents to California
points from Portland, while from Salem
it Is but 15 cents.

The matter has been occupying the at
tention of Judge Lennon for several days
and will be again tajien up In court on
Thursday. The present entanglement
came Into court about two weeks ago,
when an account was filed which showed
a discrepancy of $7008 25. Mrs. Kettler,
the guardian, asked that Thomas P. Boyd
be substituted as her attorney in place
of J. W. Cochrane. The Judge appointed
Attorney J. W. Keys to represent the rive
minor children. Mrs. Kettler was ordered
to file a supplemental account, eliminat
ing a great many Hems that were in the
original account. v
M F. Cochrane was ordered to make
an accounting to Mrs. Kettler for his
business relations with the estate. Mrs.
Kettler filed her revised account yester
day and Cochrane offered his statement
this morning. He was the chief witness
of both morning and afternoon sessions.
It developed that Attorney Cochrane,
brotlfer of M. F. Cochrane, had been paid
$300 as a fee for putting Mrs. Kettler
through insolvency. Judge Lennon re
buked Cochrane for allowing Mrs. Kettler
to follow that course when he knew she
was not liable for her husband's debts.
This fee, it was admitted, came
from the children's estate. M. F. Coch
rane also had a charge against the es
tate of the children, $437 30 for services
as financial adviser to Mrs. Kettler. He
had no contract and no voucher to show
that any of that amount had been paid.
Mrs. Kettler subsequently denied that any
such arrangement had been made between
herself and M. F. Cochrane to act for
the minors. Judge Lennon did not deem
it a claim against the children and or
dered that Cochrane return the money.
Several other minor items were also
thoroughly scrutinized. M. F. Cochrane
i had Mrs. Kettler's power of attorney to
draw checks. When she was placed upon
the stand to-day Judge Lennon asked her
why she gave this power of attorney.
"Because, your Honor," said Mrs. Kett
ler, "both J. W. and M. F. Cochrane told
me I had no legal right to handle any
money."
Judge Lennon. in adjourning court
stated he wanted a satisfactory under
standing by Thursday.
The five Kettler children, ranging from
3 to 10 years, were left from the Beitemann
estate about $200,000 in trust. W. J. Kett
ler, the father of the children, was left
a life annuity, and at his death that in
terest was to go to his children. He died
a few years ago and his personal estate
was Insolvent. Mrs. Kettler was appoint
ed administratrix of W. J. Kettler's es
tate and also guardian of the children.
The children's income amounts to about
$400 per month.
Â¦M. F. Cochrane, who has acted as Mrs.
Kettler's adviser, who also ordered to re
turn several hundred dollars forthwith,
as well as to satisfactorily explain the
ultimate disposition of a certain $100
check. ;'.'â¢:Â¦
SAN RAFAEL. Nov. 10.â After two days
of Inquiry by Judge Lennon of the Marin
County Superior Court and several attor
neys into the condition of the Kettler es
tate, it has developed that considerable
money wnlch was paid out and charged
against th" estate of the Kettler minors
was not a liability against that estate,
and. If a Just claim at all. should have
been charged against Mrs. Kettler, the
guardian, personally. As a result Judge
Lennon this afternoon ordered J. "W.
Cochrane, formerly attorney for Mrs.
Kettler, to return to the estate the sum
of $300.

in their lives is so important as attention
to correct or rational living.
It may surprise the reader to learn that
women are more prone to piles than men,
and in most cases because It is difficult to
impn ss upon them the importance of reg-
ular movements of the bowels; Irregular-
ity means straining at stool, and strain-
ing means piles, with the certainty (un-
der the usual methods of treatment) that
the sufferer will "have them always with
h<r"; by "usual methods" Is meant the
application of salves and lotions, or (as a
la Ft resort) a surgical operation.
If there is a complaint which entails
more <Ji5treEs and suffering upon those af-
flicted than piUs or hemorrhoids, it is not
known to the writer; fortunately, how-
ever, these are learning that there Is
a remedy that effectually cures all forms
of piles; it is known as the Pyramid Pile
Cure, is tn suppository form, is applied
directly to the parts, and does Its work
quickly and painlessly; it Is cold by drug-
gists at B0 cents a package, or will be
mailed by the makers to any address
upon receipt of price.
Mrs. L. M. Joliff. Pharisburg, Ohio,
says: "I feel it my duty to acknowledge
the great benefit I have received from the
use of Pyramid Pile Cure. For several
months I suffered untold agony from the
bleeding pllef, and was finally advised by
â¢a Columbus doctor to get Pyramid Pile
Cure at once, which I did, and onÂ© !k>x
completely cured me. I advise all euf- :
fcrers to use ft." Write the Pyramid !
Drug Co.. Marshall. Mich., for their little I
book on the causes and cure of piles. ,

WItlST EXERCISE

worked months over It and I cannot make
my hands so together at all. I never
knew there was any music in it until I
heard you play It Just now."
At a glance I knew her to be one of
that hopeless class of musical aspirants
who are anxious to get t<P the top, but
who are in such a hurry to 'become pian
ists that they do not let their right hand
know what their left hand doeth, and the
result isâ chaos!
I wanted to help her if possible, how
ever: so I carefully explained to her that
the way I had first learned to play the
Impromptu was by paying every atten
tion to small detailsâ working at the
6eemingly unimportant passages as much
as at the important onesâ working at my
left hand In exactly as thorough a way
as at my right, trying them first alone
and then together, until each note held
its allotted place in the impromptu as se
curely and could give its own particular
message as well as if it were being played
by an orchestra, where they are plenty
of instruments to bring out each shade
of tone. My explanations ended, the girl
looked seriously at me a moment, and
then said:
"Why, do you know, I never bothered
about the left hand at all! I thought
that would take care of Itself, if I could
get the rlzht hand to go!"
I suppose she is plodding blindly along
yet somewhere, waiting for some miracle
to come and make her left hand play as
her risht one does.
I merely mention this example to show
how necessary it is to watch every mo
tion, every sound, during these first les
sons. Nothing is lost that is done care
fully and conscientiously. One is sure to
be repaid a hundred-fold, as time goes on.
Now let the pupil attack the "down
arm"- exercise given In the last lesson
and see if he can apply it to the piano
himself, without your aid. If he is un
able to do so, recall to his mind the imag
inary string, have him raise his arm In
accordance with it (always being sure
that the wrist, and not the elbow. Is lead
ing) make him count aloud as usual,
drop the arm at "four," striking middle
C (with middle finger) with a loud,
ringing tone. Here It is no question of a
little strength in the end of- the finger,
but it In the weight of the whole arm,
and if struck properly the note should
ring and reverberate like a deep toned
bell. Do not let the wrist sink until
after the note has sounded; the arm must
come down exactly as It went up. Strike
the note on Its downward Journey; then,
using the middle finger as a pivot, relax
carefully and begin again.

exercise
Never let him hurry in his counting
His "one, two, three four, five, six 1
should be slow and even as the ewingin,
of a pendulum, for it is the first step to
ward his knowledge of rhythm.
In using this exercise it Is well to start
with the thumb or first finger of the right
hand placed over the key of C (commonly
called "middle C") and the other fingers
on corresponding keys in playing position.
Teach the child to find "middle C" him
self by showing him, first the grouping of
the black keys as they are placed in
twos and threes from one end of the piano
to the other, and then explaining that the
note C is the white key always to be
found Just below the first or left hand
bl&ck note In the groups of two. Let him
look for the groups of two and the adja
cent C's up and down the piano until he
is familiar enough with the position of C
to find it instantly. Now explain to him
that the one called "middle C" is so called
because it Is In the middle or rather near
est the middle of the keyboard, and may
be found by counting the C's from each
end of the piano until he reaches the cen
ter one.
The piano, or rather the keyboard, hav
ing now become as it were an outline map
of the country wherein he Is to travel,
."middle C" is the road by which he be
gins his journey: therefore on "middle C"
let his first finger (thumb) take its stand.
After trying the finger exercise with
the first finger slowly six times, counting
each time and relaxing after each trial,
let the -pupil try it with each finger in
turn in exactly the same way, always re
membering to put Just enough strength
in the end of the finger to make a sound,
but no more. It Is also very ; important
that as the descending finger strikes ' the
key.it should keep its curved position ex-
He was a recent arrival from the Em
erald Isle by the name of Grogan, and on
applying to the superintendent of the
Southern Pacific Railroad shops was at
once put to work and was told to make
himself generally useful. Grogan began
operations by removing some rubbish
from one of the roundhouses, but his
work was somewhat Interrupted by the
apparently futile attempts of an engin
eer" to run a refractory engine in the
roundhouse.
The engineer would run the engine into
the house, but the machinery must have
been out of order, for as fast as he ran
the engine in, I t N would reverse and run
out again. This occurred several times
and the anger of the engineer was not
mollified when Grogan, addressing him,
said:
"You don't seem to be able to put the
engine in the roundhouse, do you?"
"Is that so?" retorted the engineer.
"Probably you can do the trick." .
"BeÂ«gorry, I'll try," said Grogan, at
once climbing up on the cab.
Grogan pulled open the throttle and the
engine went in the roundhouse, but Just
as -before it came out again. Grogan
was puzzled at the strange action of the
engine, but kept at it until finally he

THE Pacific Fruit World turns to the varieties of
eucaylptus tree to insure, in California the amount of
bloom necessary for bee feed. '-The honey industry is
a large one. Sometimes the fields do not suffice' to make
what is Considered a full crop. How is this defect to be
remedied? The Fruit World says simply that the planting
of a proper number of eucalyptus trees is all that is requi
site.
There is something novel in the proposition to cover the
land with trees of the size of the lofty eucalyptus to serve
the minute, buzzing honey-makers. It does not follow from
this suggestion that because the idea is new it is not prac
ticable. Indeed the Fruit World cites facts that arc at least
interesting in support of its scheme.
There are a sufficient number of varieties of eucalyptus
known to California to provide blooms during every season
in greater or less quantity. When the flower-bearing plants
and shrubs fail to contribute their full quota of nectar the
eucalyptus would be invaluable, so j estimates the .Fruit
World. "It is possible," says the editor of the journal, "to
make such planting of eucalyptus trees as to secure from
them a succession of bloom which will, in addition to their
use as fuel, give ranges for the honey-gatherers."
The Eucalyptus callophy lla and the Eucalyptus aceme
noides are in flower from July to October. The first named
is the bearer of ; \yhite blossoms.- The Eucalyptus cornuta,
which is well known by its affluence of yellow flowers, fol
lows closely after > the callophylla in time of blossoming.
The Eucalyptus corymbrosia has the same season practically.
The Eucalyptus exima, a Iow-growin& tree, reigns Morally
from September to: December. The Eucalyptus punctata,
famed for withstanding drought, is an October bloomer.
The most brilliant of the eucalyptus family is the ncifolia,
but its season is short. On the adobe hills the rudis thrives.
At all seasons the occidentalis proclaims its name through
its crimson adornments. Then there are the Leli mellidora,
that is rich in honey; the lehmani, the paniculata.
Seeds and trees, it is said, are available to start all the
plantations that may be required. The eucalyptus has re
tained its popularity variously in this State during many
years.
.Tall groves make wind breaks to shield orchards of de
ciduous and citrus fruits in many localities. Long avenues
of shade attest its desirability in another use. / Stout cord

TIMBER AND BEE FEED.
A warrant issued for the arrest of a New York State Sen
ator named Green shows that the hunted man has thrived
through life in the possession and profitable use of four
aliases. This should silence our boasts of legislative tri
umphs. Our Solons generally have their time fully occupied
in ruining one name much less four.
IT is a good' indication of what California will do at St.
Louis that our counties are competing with each other
for space in which to display their resources. When a
single county asks for 2000 square feet of floor space it means
that the people are thoroughly alive to their opportunity
and their responsibility. But while the interest felt by those
who will exhibit is unprecedented in its vigor, it is still not
up to the expectation of the East about what California
.will do. 1
The State's exhibits, heretofore made out of the abundant
facilities of the State Board of Trade, have only whetted
the curiosity of the East and its appetite for more. At no
time in our history has there been as much interest in Cali
fornia as now. In commercial circles it i- at last under
stood that we command the raisin, prune and citrus fruit
supply of the world, and that our product controls the mar
ket. Along with this goes the important fact, now well un
derstood, that our area of these productions is so capacious
as to guarantee stability.
There is no such thing as failure in the staple fruit crops
of California. If there be a shortage in one valley, there is
extra and surplus production in another. It shows the most
admirable natural adaptation of the State to the character
istic productions which interest the consumers of the world.
In Europe the field is limited. If conditions are unfavorable
in any season, production is curtailed and the market suffers
by aberrations in price. From all this chance and accident
California is free. The exhibits of counties at St. Louis in
conjunction with a raised map of the^State will show the
vast distribution of production and exploit California as a
land where the milk and honey are always on tap and the
fountain of production is always affluent.
SPACE AT ST. LOUIS.
At the recent election it cost New York $300 to secure
the vote of one elector, for whose special benefit an entire
district was created. There is, however, some sentimental
satisfaction in the fact that the vote thus "Secured was cast
for Low. Tammany ought to increase the expense account
by instituting proceedings to have the vote thrown out on
the score that it violated the secrecy of the ballot.
Now. with the hand in playing posi
tion, try the circle exercise a few times,
until you have loosened any tension
which "the change from table to keyboard
might occasion. When all the muscles
are limber and relaxed raise the thumb
precisely as in the finger exercise given
in the laFt lesson. Instead of merely let
ting the finger drop at will, however, we
now. for the firyt time, -use a little
â¢strengthâ just enough to enable the finger
to bring forth a slignt sound from the
key as the latter is pressed downward.
In the former finger exercise you will
remember that we raised the finger very
slowly, at the Fame time counting "one,
two. three." Then as we gave the count
"four" we merely ceased to hold the fln
gtr upraised and it dropped of its own
accord.
In this exercise as the pupil counts
"four" hn must drop his finger in the
same way. but must put enough strength
In the very tip to depress the key his fin
ger falls on until it emits a slight sound.
The attraction of gravitation still brings
the finger down until it hits the key, but
if perfectly relaxed the slight resistance
of the key Itself is enough to stop the
finger in its downward course, unless it
be aided by a little output of strength.
It is surpriEing what an infinitesimal
bit of pressure will do in this case, and it
is necessary to guard against using any
surplus f-nergy. for therein lies the dif
ference between a "singing" tone and
pounding. We will want all our strength
later on. but until that time we must
hold it in reserve as much as possible.
After striking the key have the pupil
hold the finger on the key just as It fell
until he has finished the exercise by
counting "five, elx." after which he must
relax thoroughly by means of the circle
Me. The arm must have plenty of room
to swing freely, to allow for relaxation,
and yet must not be too far above the
piano, for the whole figure would thus
be thrown out of poise. If the fingers
rest lightly on the piano keys and the
flbow swings from two to three inches
above the level of the keys everything
is at it should be.

"I put up at a one-horse hotel, where
they all wash in the same tin basin on

About 3 o'clock in the morning I was

"I followed suit, took my bucket and

that .greeted me. Men, women and chil

one carried a bucket. Swinging into a
line they passed water from the town
well a quarter of a mile distant. I work
ed for half an hour until I was exhausted

they tapped the fire 'out.' Then the citi

The New York Tribune shows that jus
tice in Tennessee is not of the stripe of
that in South Carolina. It says:
"As strance a case as could well be
found in the hlstorv of court proceed
ings is that of Clarence Peak, who Is
under a sentence of eighteen years' Im
prisonment in Tennessee on a charge of
killing a person named Silas Ilulin. It
Is true. Peak did murder a man who was
supposed to be Hulin, but his victim was
a wholly different individual. Hulin Is
alive and well and has shown himself in
court repeatedly. Peak never attacked
him. The friends of Peak are trying to
get his release because a mistake was
made in the identity of his victim. But
the Tennessee courts have decided so far
that even if Peak did not slay Hulin. he
certainly killed some one and must serve
out his sentence." _ , '[ ;V : -'

This can be only by the independence of the State of
Panama. The isthmus has the enterprise and the progres
sive element of the country, and its people have been ruled
by successive packs of thieves at Bogota until they have
grown weary and have decided to govern themselves. Ger
many will hesitate long before going so far from home in
search* for trouble that she can find with less mileage. Our
desire to perform our international obligation under the
treaty of 1846 is no reason for Colombia asking a foreign
protectorate that violates the Monroe doctrine. It is still
less a reason for German interference in this hemisphere,
where that empire has no colonies and no interests present
or prospective that require naval stations or the direct or
indirect acquisition of territory.
Our interest is apparent, direct and known of all nations.
We are bound by the treaty of 1846 and by our obligation
to the world as the only nation that can construct an isth
mian canal. There is no reason to believe that Germany
will seek to interfere in a hemisphere where nature and the
political situation join to make ours the paramount interest.
If Colombia should adopt the proposed measure of asking
for foreign aid, it would simply mean that we must occupy
that country before it can be alienated in any form to any
European power. We would probably do this and turn it
over to the Republic of Panama as soon as we have intro
duced order and decency into its administration.
The Democratic press would dignify itself by standing in
with its own country, supporting the Monroe doctrine and
taking on some of the sturdy Americanism that made Ben
ton illustrious. If, instead of doing this, it chooses to sup
port chronic disorder on the isthmus,, and give aid to such
German pretensions as are implied by the Colombian
threat, it can do so. But it is a far cry from that kind of
Democracy and the quality that was illustrated by Jackson,
Polk, Cass and Marcy. <
IT is probably a* wild rumor that Colombia' is out for
blood, and proposes to get it By seeking a German pro
tectorate and giving the Kaiser naval stations within
striking distance of the ends of the isthmian canal. 'Some
of the Democratic newspapers are talking about our Gov
ernment despoiling Colombia and comparing. President
RoosevÂ«lt to Sir Henry Morgan, pirate and cutthroat.
Nobody has despoiled Colombia. She has been in Â¦ a
chronic state of civil war for years. Under our treaty of
1846 we are responsible for the freedom and neutrality of
the Panama Railway, "or any other .means for transit of the
isthmus of Panama." No one can say without reference to
the record how many times we have been at the expense
of policing the railroad during civil brawls between the isth
mians and the misgovernment of Colombia. It has been
of yearly occurrence, and sometimes has been necessary sev
eral times a year, until it has become requisite in the dis
charge of our duty to the world under the treaty that brawl
ing cease. . ,
Before the eye of what he regards as his mind there
rises the vision of the Republican party as the party- of spe
cial privilege, for the benefit of the few and the oppression
of the many. He sees the many divided and the few vic
torious over the two minorities. Consequently, everything is
going wrong and he was born to set it right.
The history of the Republican party is a refutation of his
uneasy nightmare. The condition of the whole people of
the United States turns his dream into. a calumny upon his
own country. One must seek in the independent and uncon
trolled movements and actions of men for the true index
to conditions. The freedom, self-government and prosper
ity of the plain people of the United States are certified by
the fact that this country attracts to it the greatest movement
of men who seek betterment of their conditions that the
world has ever seen. Others are as rich in natural re
sources, some are as free, and several have a scantier popu
lation in proportion to their area. But the movement is
persistently hither.
The opportunity and prosperity of the many here are
so pronounced that immigration flows in a vast stream to
us, that millions more may have a share in our birthright.
If the hypodermic revery of Mr. Hearst were true, this coun
try would be avoided by those who seek better fortune and
a larger life. The solemn fact is that Republican policies,
wrought upon our natural resources and respectful of the
rights of man, have made the United States so. desirable that
we are in danger of sharing too freely what others come to
enjoy. There be those who believe that we should more
carefully save for ourselves, and our natural increase, the
riches that nature has stored and wise government made
available for man.
The proposed fusion is based upon the theory that these
conditions Can be made better. How? What is the bill of
particulars? President Roosevelt has declared his policy
and has done more. He has concreted it into action. His
whole administration has been a successful effort against
all special privilege. His energetic action in that direction
ha"s brought upon him the wrath of one of the parties to
Mr. Hearst's proposed fusion, for some radical labor men
have already declared war upon the President for refusing to
violate the law and give them discrimination and special
privilege. For the same reason the trusts are embattled
against him, and do not scruple to declare their purpose to
have his head. We hope that Mr. Hearst's fusion will fuse,
and will pull the band-wagon together, and. that he will be
the band.
THE Examiner wants the Democratic party to fuse
again. Mr. William Randolph Hearst is not admon
ished by the fate of Bryan, but feels that he needs fu
sion in his present business of bawling from the housetops
in order that a Presidential nomination may ; find him.
Therefore he wants a labor party and a Democratic party,
but wants them to pull in the same harness, and as he pro
poses to be the load the team is to haul, it will be cheerfully
admitted that the burden is too great for one;-and needs
two. His imagination is excited by figures. He creates
purely fanciful statistics of the vote of the three parties in
this city, and proves to his own satisfaction that if the Dem
ocrats had nominated Schmitz and the labpr party had nom
inated the Democratic candidates for Auditor, City Attor
ney, County Clerk and all the other nominees of that
party who were beaten, they would all. have been elected
and would have lived happy ever after.

"How can any one possibly play tha
Chopin Impromptu as you did? I hav<
I remember oneÂ© playing at a concert
among other things an "Impromptu in A
Flat," by Chopin, which as far as the
actual notes are concerned is not tremen
dously difficult, but it demands great agil
ity, lightness and velocityâ should give
the Impression, In fact, of a bit of clear,
bracing winter air. At the close of the
concert many people were introduced to
me. and among others was a young girl
who said to me:
Try this exercise over and over until, as
the wrist drops, the sound emitted is
clear and ringing, instead of hard and
dry, as it may be at first Above all, be
particular in every little thing, for now
is the time to prevent slovenly, uneven
chords. The habit of thoroughness in de
tail, once acquired, will save the pupil
many unhappy hours later on.
Next In order romes a wrist exercise,
similar to that already explained in the
former lesson.^but with the difference that
in this, as in the finger exercise men
tioned above, strength enough Is used to
strike the key, or rather keys, for this
time two notes are to sound.
From playing position raise the wrist
slowly, counting "one,' two, three." Hold
it in Its raised position (strictly according
to the first wrist exercise)' until the count
"four" is given, when it must drop at
once to the five keys under it. The fingers
fall on the keys C, D. E. F and G, and as
they hit the keyboard there must be just
enough strength put into the first (thumb)
and fifth (little) fingers to bring out the
sound of the two notes C and G, after
which, of course, comes the always neces
sary circle exercise.
This combination of sound in the simul
taneous striking of C and G is the pupil's
first introduction to a chord. In this case
the chord is what is called a "fifth," or
"quint." Explain this to him and tell him
it Is called a "fifth" because five notes
are contained in the space from C to G.
If the notes are to be In accord they
must be struck simultaneously. Therefore
be very careful that the hand comes down
in perfect position, well curved, with the
joints of the fingers making a perfect arch
and the hand returning to playing posi
tion.
actly as It did In descending upon the
table before any pressure was used. - If
the position of the finger changes it shows
that the muscles have tightened slightly
with the added strength, and you must
work carefully and steadily with the
child until his motions become as relaxed
with the accession of strength as without
it. If he cannot seem to conquer the
tightening muscles, take him to the table
again for a few moments and try the old
exercises there; then return to the piano,
then back to the table again, and so on,
until he has found the difference between
strength and tight muscles. Just at this
point it will require much patience, for it
is a matter that cannot be hurried or
passed over lightly. All will most certain
ly come right In a little time, but until
this exercise Is perfectly understood by
the pupil do not attempt to push him a
step further.

known before election, but none of his
friends felt at liberty to tell about It until
to-day. Several persons have been labor
ing under the belief that Murphy favored
Cleveland. As a matter of fact the Tam
many Hall leader has been In consultation
recently, both personally and by means
of representatives,- with Democrats of na
tional prominence and has arrived at the
conclusion that Judge Parker would be
more likely to get the electoral vote of
New York than Cleveland. Senator Gor
man of Maryland is not regarded by Mur
phy as the probable nominee of the party.
While the Tammany delegation may not
cut much figure in the national conven
tion Murphy is already planning with the
up-State leaders In order that when he
goes into the convention he will be able
practically to . cast the State vote as a
unit. Murphy desired to have Judge Par
ker nominated for Governor a year ago
and urged upon David B.- Hill the advis
ability of making him the candidate.
Hill, however, listened to Hugh McLaugh
lin and nominated Bird P. Coler. Â¦ Coler
was beaten. Murphy expressed the opin
ion at the time that Hill did not play
good politics. It was even intimated
among Murphy's friends that Hill's object
in placing Judge Parker out of the nomi
nation was to prevent his appearance In
the field of rival Presidential possibilities.
During the recent trouble in Brooklyn
Hill was supposed to be on the side of
Hugh McLaughlinâ at least he Is credited
In Tammany Hall with having been op
posed to Murphy's ambitions to become a
State leader. The supporters of the Tam
many leader say that he will steal a
march on Hill when It comes to naming
the choice of j New York State for the
Presidential nomination. They add that
he Is firmly convinced that Judge Parker
Is the only Democrat of national reputa
tion who stands a chance of winning.
Murphy has said that Cleveland would
make an Ideal candidate, especially on the
tariff Issue, but for the opposition to him
in the South. Should Judge Parker be
elected Tammany believes that Murphy
would be the real dispenser of Federal
patronage In the State of New York.

TOKIO, Nov. 10.â Premier Kamura to
dajr received a deputation of the Antl-
RuBslan League. He impressed the dele
gates with the necessity for complete
unity and solidarity among the people in
the face of tbe existing- situation, which
he declared was most critical.
There Is a strong inclination in well
informed circles to doubt the pacific fore
casts Issued in Europe. It is believed
that peace will be made possible only by
Russia's complete acceptance of Japan's
claims regarding Manchuria. The Japan
ese Government finds it increasingly dif
ficult to restrain 'popular sentiment.
At an important dinner this evening In
the Imperial Hotel, at which about 250
persons were present, representing all
sections, a resolution was adopted, amid
the greatest enthusiasm, declaring that
the continued delay was detrimental to
the national interests and to peace in
the Far East and urging the Government
to take prompt and decisive action. Â¦
Kamura Says Far East
Situation Is Most
Critical.
Cardinal Prisco > who knew how relig
ious Signor Rosano had always been, gave
permission that his body be buried in con
secrated ground, heretofore forbidden to
those who commit suicide. There was,
however, no religious ceremony. The sui
cide of Finance Minister Rosano has so
changed the political situation in Parlia
ment that Premier Giolittl has requested
an audience of King Emmanuel. The re
quest has been granted, and the Premier
will leave to-morrow for the royal hunt
ing lodge at San Rossore, where the King
is now staying. It is said that Premier
Giolittl will tender his resignation.
The funeral of Signor Rosano to-day
was a most Impressive one. All the civil
and military authorities and the troops
rendered military honors to the deceased.
The streets along the route to the burial
place were densely crowded. At the
grave Minister of Foreign Affairs Tittoni
said that the sudden end to the brilliant
career of Signor Rosano had deeply af
fected the Ministers of the King, who
reverently bowed before the lamented re
mains and deposited a last kiss â¢ on the
forehead of one who had always been
their friend.
NAPLES, Nov. 10.â Before committing
suicide yesterday Finance Minister Ro
sano wrote to Premier Giolltti, tendering
his resignation. In another letter to the
Premier he proclaims his innocence of the
charges brought against him, which
charges, he said, he had no longer the
courage to resist.

PARIS, Nov. 10.â A dispatch received
here from Cape Haytien says that after
three days' righting President Wos y Gil
took refuge in the German consulate in
San Domingo. The revolution Is consid
ered at an end.
SAN DOMINGO, Nov. 7.â The revolu
tionary forces which now surround this
city attacked San Domingo last night,
using artillery, but no damage was done.
The revolutionary commander this after
noon sent a messenger under a flag of
trueÂ© to demand the surrender of the
capital, which was refused, and hostilities
were resumed. San Domingo Is strongly
fortified and provisions are plentiful.
Late to-night Assistant Secretary
Loomis called at the White House and
spent eome time in the telegraph room.
He refused to admit that he was cabling
fresh instructions to Minister Powell, al
though he said that late in the afternoon
he notified the Minister that the cruiser
Baltimore was on her way to San Domin
go and probably would reach there some
time during the night. The dispatch re
porting the capitulation of the city of
San Domingo to the revolutionists was
shown to Loomls. and he expressed the
opinion that such action might have
taken place subsequent to Minister Pow
ell's cablegram that the situation was
serious.
Macoris is a fruit shipping port, and
the bombardment is supposed to have
been without the required twenty-four
hours' notice. If it appears that Ameri
can interests have suffered by arbitrary
action at the hands of the Dominican
Government the State Department will
demand full redress, and the cruiser Bal
timore, now at Puerto Plata, undoubtedly
will prevent further occurrences of this
kind.
The State Department to-day received
another belated dispatch from United
States Minister Powell at San Domingo
City, dated the 6th Inst., In which the
Minister says:
Maroris has Just been bombarded by a Santo
Dominsan naval ve*Â«.i and partially destroyed.
The American interests in Macoris are very
considerable.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â The State De
partment to-night received a cablegram
from Minister Powell at San Domingo,
dated at 4 p. m. to-day, reporting the sit
uation at San Domingo to be very se
rious. The dispatch, it was stated, was
the first which the department had re
ceived on the day of filing Elnce the dis
turbance began.
The State Department to-day received
the following cablegram from Minister
Powell, dated San Domingo, November 6,
11 p. m.:

CAPE HAYTTEN, Nov. 10.â A dis
patch from Monte Criste says
it is reported there that San
Domingo has capitulated to tho
HER UN. Nov. 10.â A bulletin on the
condition of Emperor William issued this
morning at the new palace, Potsdam,
bays there is a slow Improvement In the
appearance of the left vocal chord.
The Kmperor walked out twice to-day
Â«nd transacted business with the chief of
the naval staff and the chiefs of his pri
vate military and naval Cabinets.
The morning bulletin was not supple
mented by other details. Importance Is
no longer attached to the Emperor's
wound by the court officials, who consider
ihat public concern can best be alloyed
by not paying anything except what is
contained In the bulletins.
The Emperor will have to abstain from
much public speaking In the future. The
Krowth on the vocal chord appears to
have toern caused by straining: the voice.
The Kmperor. as is well known, talks
much in public, amusing the guests at
dinners and speaking to large open-air
companies at the unveiling of monuments,
launehings and reviews of troops.
Professor Orth's microscopic examina
tion showed that the dark matter found
"rigrinated from previous bleedings within
tbe polypus, which contained a great
number of minute blood vessels. The
bleedings were almost certainly caused
by Joud speaking. The Emperor's voice
Ot recent years has always appeared
tomewhat hoarse, but his entourage no
ticed that it was hoarser than usual dur
ing the last three weeks.
Dr. Schmidt gives his attention solely
to the Emperor's case, having retired
from active practice six months ago.
The Crown Prince, Frederick William,
returned to the new palace to-day from
hunting at Wernigerode.

JIMMY BRITT cleverly outpointed
Charlie Seiger last night in their
twenty-round bout at Mechanics'
Pavilion. The affair went the
limit, and with the. exception of the four
teenth round' there was no time when
Seiger seemed to have a chance with the
clever Californian.
. It was the hardest fight Britt has ever
had, and tried his strength, his clever
ness and his hitting powers to the limit.
Seiger proved but little , better ' than .a
punching bag and took an Incredible
amount of punishment.- This: is his only
qualification as a fighter.' His only blow
is a right chop, but he seemed' unable to
land this effectively, although he tried
repeatedly. !
There was a sameness about the v flght
up to the - fourteenth round which I kept
down the enthusiasm of the spectators.
In this -round Seiger landed one ofihls
swings and Britt went down Just as the
gong sounded. \_ Seiger. ! then forced ; the
fighting for two rounds and there seemed
to be some trouble In store for /Britt.
The latter quickly regained the upper
hand again, however, and won without
difficulty.

judge whether Z showed skill or not. He
never had me distressed at any statre of

round throughout the flght â¢ He soon
slowed up from a hard left to the body
and a right to the head, both of which
hurt him. Brltt staggered Seiger with.
,a right to the' head and knocked him, to

RUNS AND HITS BT INNINGS.
The pitching honors were about even up
between St. Vraln and Whalen, but the
support received by the latter aided him
out In the tight places, while the northern
slabster was continually being thrown
down by his fielders whenever he needed
good backing.
The Natives landed once in the first on
a hit, an error and a stolen base. In the
third they shoved three more of their
number over qn a combination of poor
fielding and a timely hit. The northern
sluggers filled up the bags in the third,
and then Smith came through with a
triple to left, which cleared the bags.
After that inning It was curtains with
Seattle, while San Francisco brought two
more home in the ninth and made victory
doubly sure. The score:

The Seattle aggregation arrived at the
Oakland ball grounds in all its glory yes
terday afternoon and ran a bad second to
the native organization. . In fact, the slug
gers who have been creating such a sen.
eatlon throughout the length and breadth
of the. Pacific Coast played the game like
a lot of tramps, and the struggle finished
7 to 3. -
It was the Seattle infielders who were
to blame for the poor exhibition. Two of
them, Dolan and Mohler, performed as
well as could be expected, but the other
pair, Jansing and Sample, were something
awful, and It Is shameful to relate how
many times they allowed the natives to
get on bases and come home with runs.

These are strenuous times behind the
high board fence that surrounds the cam
pus gridiron. Secret practices they are
and yet Coach ' L<anagan on several oc
casions to-night might be said to have
given away the secret. Judging from the
stentorian tones in which he upbraided
the big fellows : for not getting Into the
plays. Lanagan Is far from satisfied with
the showing being made by the big eleven
against the second, yet if coaching can
aid them- that same varsity eleven ought
to be In perfect trim on Saturday, for
each man is receiving Individual attention
from the coaches.
Several of the big fellows did not get
Into the scrimmage to-night owing to the
fact that their condition will not permit
it. They have been worked hard during
the past two weeks and as a result the
trainer Is afraid that they may "break
over" before Saturday if they are allowed
to go in for hard scrimmage work.
To-morrow the last general assembly
before the intercollegiate game will oc
cur and from present Indications It prom
ises to be one of the most enthusiastic
of the year. It will be largely in the
nature of a football rally, although the
last big rally will be held the following
night in Assembly Hall.
It is probable that W. T. Reid, former
varsity athlete and coach at Harvard
University and at present head master at
Belmont School, will be the principal
speaker. Coach Lanagan and Dr. Frank
Angell of the faculty athletic committee
are also expected to address the meeting.

After the big battle Referee Eddie
Graney made the following statement
"Brltt fought better to-night than 'he
has In his whole career. He was faster
and cleverer than his opponent and had
him . beaten - at every , department of the
game. 3eiger r surprised me by his abll
ity to take punishment. Any other man
would have succumbed In the earlier
rounds, but he seemed to like It and came
back for more. The decision was given
to Britt because he had it by a mile At
no time In the fight did Seiger show to
advantage. -Brltt^ was never in danger

Brltt was much cooler In this round and
scored many times on the stomach with his
left.
The varsity lined up against the second
eleven again to-day. The second eleven
was strengthened by the addition of
Forse, Kittrelle and Geary. The first
eleven played a fast game and there waa
a notable difference in the team work,
which up to this time has not been by
any means perfect.
The coaches are spending a good deal
of time perfecting the ends. Harry Hud
son, the right end, spends his time teach
ing Demerritt and Oliver some of the fine
points of the game.
But Stern's good' showing in last Satur
day's game against Nevada rather set
tled the contention over the place. Not
that Forse made any mistakes, but that
Stern made big ground gains against the
visitors. Stern played in the second half
only, Forse having been In the first, and
it was easy to see that he was more than
"making good."
Stern has not been playing all season
like Forse and that is probably the rea
son for the impression that Forse would
be the fullback. Stern was hurt early
in the season, so that the coaches have
not been using him as often as Forse. He
Is a much heavier man than Forse, per
haps ten or fifteen pounds representing
the difference, and he is not as quick on
his feet, but he plays what might be
called a "heady" game.
"I haven't made up my mind who will
play fullback," said Coach Whlpple to
day. "Stern has the best chance for the
place,' though to-morrow's practice game
will determine who gets it. It may be
that we will try both men during the
game."
BERKELEY, Nov. 10.â It is pretty well
understood that Jack "Whlpple and Mini
will be the halfbacks and "Jonny" More
the quarterback in Saturday's game, but
there Is still a good deal of speculation
going on as to whether Stern or "Jim"
Forse will be the fullback. Coach "Jim"
Whlpple said to-day that he was undecid
ed as between the two men. but from
what he said It might be inferred that
the position will go to Stern.
Up to last Saturday It seemed to be
taken for granted that Forse would fill
the bill at the big game. He had been
tried at left tackle and fullback, but he
seemed to fill better behind the line, fie
is an enthusiastic, hard-hitting player, is
a consistent ground gainer and doesn't
fumble. There seemed to be no doubt
that he would go into the game as full
back.

Between Barstow and Albuquerque the
Santa Fe has, in the past, experienced
to' haul freight trains over the
steep grades of the company's line be
tween Barstow and Albuquerque had ar
rived at the western terminal of the
road in Southern California and will be
put in service to-morrow or the day fol
lowing.
The new locomotive, a product of the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, is the larg
est in the world and its performance is
looked forward to with keen Interest by
the officials of the operating and motive
departments of all tho Western roads,
for it Is an innovation that Is expected
to result in much saving in expense of
wear and tear and wages and In the mat
ter of time.
WORD was received by the local
Santa Fe officials yesterday
that the first of the forty-five
giant locomotives to be used
boy Into her care In New York several
years ago. Young Clunle is about 8 years
of age.
The greatness of the latest type of lo
comotive can be easily imagined when it
is stated that Its length is seventy-seven
feetâ longer that a Pullman carâ and
that It weighs 2S7.240 pounds, or a trifle
more than 143% tons. Of this immense
weight 234,520 pounds rest upon the driv
ers, which have a diameter of fifty-seven
Inches. The dimensions of the other im
portant parts of the locomotives are as
follows: Cylinders, 39 and 32x32 Inches;
total wheel base, 35 feet 11 inches; driv
ing wheel base, 19 feet 9 inchee; bolter
diameter 78^ Inches (water tube); boiler
pressure, 225 pounds per square inch;
number of tubes, 291: diameter of tubes,
2*4 Inches; length of tubes, 20 feet; firebox
length, 108 inches: firebox width, 78
Inches; heating surface, firebox, 210
square feet; heating surface, tubes, 45SS
square feet; heating surface, total, 4796
square feet; grate area, 53.5 square feet;
tank capacity, 8500 gallons.
service on the Santa Fe line* farther
east.
great difficulty In operating'heavy freight
trains, for that portion of tho company's
territory Is mountainous and necessitates
double-headers on all big trains, partic
ularly during the California fruit season,
when the Santa Fe traffic is exceedingly
heavy. The new engines, of which the
one now In tho south is the first to ar
rive, are expected to pick up these big
trains and haul them east as rapidly as
two engines of a smaller type. .
The balance of the locomotives con
tracted for are expected to be delivered
by their makers to the company In Cal
ifornia by January 1. As soon as they are
all in service it Is the Intention of the
Santa Fe Company to remove the smaller
locomotives now in use on that'particu
lar branch of the road to its- systems in
Missouri.' Kansas and Texas, where the
country Is level. Besides tfiese forty-five
big locomotives the company purposes to
reinforce Its motive power west of Albu
querque with sixteen large locomotives
commonly known as "moguls" now in
the proceeds to go toward the fund of the
association. The cause Is a worthy one
and tho public should respond heartily.
The plays will be worth the money
charged and will equal any ever given in
the theater.

The music, the marvelous scenic effects,
the chariot race, tha "star of Bethlehem"

to gain new admiration at every per
formance, and although the spectacular
features are the most wonderful that
have ever been placed on the stage, the
fact remains that a very large share of

this story, told and acted with such dra

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 10.â When.
George H. Chivls of Detroit, Mich., the
colored editor of the Railway Portersi
Magazine, entered the dining car on a
train bound from San Francisco to Port
land yesterday the conductor told him
that "be could not be gsrved until later.
Chivis saw several vacant seats and pro
tested, claiming that hÂ© was paying the
same price as anybody else. He pushed
past the conductor and sat down, ac
companied by his wife and E. C. Hughes,
a colored man of San Francisco.
Several ladles left the car and tho
members of the Multnomah football team,
who were returning from California,
crowded behind the conductor as he re
monstrated with Chivla. Hughes went
out and returned with a revolver. The
incident was closed peaceably.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
Former United States Senator Penrose
is Bupposed to have an interest In this
road, whose plans were fully exploited
several months ago, when its. promoters
went north to look over the ground.
The proposed route of. the new road is
from Grants Pass, Or., in a southwesterly
direction via Wllderville, Selma and Kirby
to Crescent City, Del Norte County, Cali
fornia, with a branch line running north
erly via Smith River to Chetco, Or., and
also from a point on Smith River near
Crescent City southerly via Requa, Del
Norte County, to a point in Humboiat
County. The entire length of the line is
estimated to be 191 miles.
The other company which filed a certifi
cate of â¢ incorporation yesterday Is the
California and Oregon Coast Railroad.
It was recently Incorporated under the
laws of Nevada with a capital of $1,000,000,
of which $200,000 is subscribed by J. O'B.
Gunn, John Barth, T. W. M. Draper, H.
H. Ludlow, Bond V. Thomas and M. S.
Wilson, $100 each, and the Oregon and Pa
cific Railroad Construction Company $139,
400.
ANOTHER NEW COMPANY.
When an answer was denied the South
ern Pacific Company It promptly an
nounced that it would Immediately paral
lel the new line and made a bluff to do
so, with the result that it finally entered
Into a traffic alliance with the Sierra Rail
way, and to-day holds this traffic con
tract over the head of the little road to
prevent it from doing business with the
Santa Fe or other roads that may invado
that territory.
Another line eastward by way of Beck
with Pass would add to the revenue of
the Harriman syndicate, and possibly In
â¢time, after Harriman has carried out his
present plans for a road up the coast by
way of the California Northwestern to
Eureka, Crescent City, Coos Bay and
Portland, the new line to the East might
be connected with the existing Oregon
line of the Southern Pacific and In this
manner afford a shorter and quicker haul
for freight destined for the East from
the north and from Eastern points to the
territory in which Hill and Harriman are
r.ow striving to hold their own. Hellman,
Klrkpatrick and Israel have figured In the
directorates of several companies con
trolled by Harriman, and this fact lends
strength to the prevailing suspicion that
the road incorporated yesterday is a Jlar
riman project.
AN EYE ON" BECKWITH .PASS.
The Diamond Match Company has been
laying unusually heavy rails and ordering
rolling stock of a character that has plain
ly suggested to the practical railroad
managers that the enterprise of the com
pany is- of a greater magnitude than a
scheme to reach its timber holdings in
that section of the State and carry Its
product to market by way of the South
ern Pacific Company's lines. For several
months agents of the Southern Pacific
Company have been In the field doing de
tective work with a view of confirming
the fears of Harriman that the Diamond
Match Company is trying to assist the
Gould lines to steal a march and get into
California.
It is no uncommon method of the South
ern Pacific Company to survey lines to
parallel those of suspected competitors,
one recent instance being In the case of
the Sierra Railway. When that concern
started to build out of Oakdale and mys
teriously concealed its purposed destina
tion the Southern Pacific Company sent
its representatives to the promoters of
the smaller road and demanded to know
to what points the line was to be built
and whether it was Intended eventually
to extend the road across the eastern bor
ders of the State.
BIG BLUFF WORKED.
With the usual discreetness, the lncor
porators of the new road fail to explain
why they intend to practically parallel
the Diamond Match Company's road, but
public opinion in that section of the State
is already firmly settled on tho supposi
tion that President Harriman of the
Southern Pacific Company, fearing, as
many outsiders hope, that the Diamond
Match Company's small line is In reality
a nucleus for another transcontinental
road, designed by Gould, who owns a
large share of the stock of the match
syndicate, purposes to build out of Cali
fornia by the same route.
For months it has been known that the
Diamond Match Company was surveying
eastwardly beyond its matchwood tract,
apparently with a future plan of crossing
the Meadows and by way of BeckwITh
Pass, the route selected by the Western
Pacific, secure an exit .from California
and eventually connect with the Gould
lines in Denver. C. P. Huntingdon once
contemplated leaving California with the
Central Pacific by this more northern
route and in after years, when he had
realized that he and his associates had
made a great mistake, he often admitted
the fact and spoke of possible construc
tion work In that direction in the time
to come.
The Chico and Northern Railroad Com
pany Is one of the newly, incorporated
companies and Is capitalized at $1,000,000,
of which $32,000 Is subseribfd by the direc
tors, who are I. W. Hellman, J. M. Is
rael, H. M. Hoibrook and John C. Kirk
pfitrick of this city; and C. A. Harp of
Stockton. Banker Â¦ Hellman, who is
named as treasurer of the new company,
holds $30,000 of the stock subscribed and
the balance is distributed among the oth
ers to the extent of $500 each. The com
pany announces its purposes to build a
read of thirty-two miles from a point one
mile south of Chico, in a general north
erly and easterly direction to the new
town of Sterling, which was established
and is now the northern terminus of the
road being constructed by the Diamond
Match Company.
HABBIMAN FEARS GOULD.
Two new railroad enterprises, both des
tined to contribute to the development
of Northern California, gave formal no
tice of their existence yesterday when
certificates of incorporation were filed
with the County Clerk. The directorates
of both companies are composed mainly
of local men of prominence, a fact that
strongly suggests that the Southern Pa
cific Company Is anticipating a move on
the part of a possible" transcontinental
competitor to gain a firm foothold In tne
northern territory on which the Harriman
railroad has long held a strong grip.
None of the escapes has been recap
tured, although officers In every part of
tho country are on the lookout for them,
It is known that Williams was at Val
lejo recently, but he fled before the au
thorities could lay hands on him.
The investigating officer does not see
how there could have been any connec
tion between the escape of Williams and
the subsequent release of the other four
felons. He thinks it might have been pos
sible that White and Moore heard how
their former friend won his way to free
dom and. were thus Inspired to make a
similar attempt. The orders on which
White, Moore, Stokes and Darling were
released are not at all like the one used
by Williams, nor was the same method
followed in placing the documents in the
regular military channels.
Colonel Andrews received an order from
the War Department yesterday directing
that all orders of release must bear the
signatures of the Secretary of War and
of the acting Secretary of War. besides
those of local officers. The War Depart
ment seal must also be affixed to all such
documents. It Is thought that this will
prevent similar occurrences In the future.
Ralph Williams went free on a forged
order of release early In September. The
other four prisoners effected their escape
simultaneously a month later by the same
means. It was thought at first that the
felons were aided by conspirators on the
outside of the prison walls, but Major
Morrow ia Inclined to think from the evi
dence presented during the recent inves
tigation that the whole work was done at
Alcatraz. Moore and White had access
to the adjutant general's office and to the
printing plant on the island.
Major Morrow went into the printing
office and made an exact copy of the
fraudulent pardons. He thinks that the
only aid which might have been given
the prisoners must have come from Mes
senger Foster, who tarried mall between
Alcatraz and headquarters, and who de
serted as soon as the facts In the case
were made known.
Major Harry Morrow, Judge advocate
of the Department of California, sent a
report to General MacArthur" yesterday
explaining how military prisoners "Wil
liams. White, Moore, Stokes and Darling
escaped from Alcatraz by means of forged
orders. No recommendations are made
in the report as to methods of preventing
further escapes in a similar manner, but
the department commander will probably
attend to this feature of the case him
self.
In charging tho Jury Judge de Haven
laid down the law of the case as 'follows:
lie said that if a person makes applica
tion to enter public lands with the inten
tion at the time of the application to ac
quire the land for his own benefit and not
for the benefit of somebody else on specu
lation he can borrow the money to, pay
for the land and his expenses in acquir
ing the property without violating the
law. Then if he should find it to be more
profitable to sell it than to retain it he
may sell it. But if, at the time of making
the application, he intends to sell it as
roon as he gfts a chance, and makes the
eppllcatlon because he has an agreement
with somebody to sell and merely com
piles with the formal requirements of the
law for that purpose, he is simply a
dummy aud commits perjury in taking the
oath and the person who has made the
suggestion to him to make the false oath
Is guilty of subornation of perjury.
LAYS DOWN THE LAtV.
One of the defendants, Arthur W. Ked
die, a gray-haired man. almost collapsed
when the verdict was announced and was
l>i*"vented from pinkir.g to the floor by his
daughter. Miss Helen Keddie. who caugnv
him in her arms and whis;>ered words of
encouragement into his ear.
The counsel for the defense were great
ly surprised at the verdict, because the
four witnesses called for the prosecution
had sworn Chat they had .stated the truth
in their applications for the land and had
not committed perjury, nor had they been
incited thereto by tho accused. The jury,
however, chose to disbelieve that part of
their testimony because of the other cir
cumstances attendant upon their filing on
the land.
The defendants are m<*n well-to-do and
owners of the Roberts Lumber Company,
the Boca and Loyaltcn Railroad and saw
mills at Loyalton. in the heart of a rich
sugar pine district. Tho theory of the
prosecution was that the defendants, de
jlrir.g to get lumber to keep their mills
In operation, induced the nine persons
named in the Indictment to file upon as
many quarter sections of timber land In
consideration of the payment of their ex
penses and 5100 for each quarter section,
over and above the $400 paid to the Gov
ernment for it, and that the applicants
J-.ad an agreement beforehand to sell to
none but the defendants and at the con
sideration mentioned, the defendants ad
vancing the money for the purchase and
the expenses.
ALIaOST COLLAPSES
The defendants had been indicted for
Hibernation of perjury on eighteen counts
wccuslr.g them of .having suborned
William 8. Mead, Hiram Reed. Stephen
II. Whittlcsey, George IX. Stlmers. Creed
T. Hill, James W. Larison, Mrs. Carolynn
E. Battelle. Walter L. Rees and Miss
Helen Keddie to make false oath in. filing
applications for timber lands in Plumas
rnd Sierra counties. Judge de Haven or
riered the defendants to appear to-mor
row morning: at 10 o'clock for sentence.
The maximum penalty is imprisonment In
the penitentiary for the term of five years
and the imposition of a fine not exceeding
$1000.
Bert Schlesinger. leading counsel for the
crfonse, announced that he would appeal
the case. Five of the witnesses alleged
to have been suborned could not be
found by the United States Marshal, but
the jury declared by the verdict that the
conditions with respect to the missing
witnesses were similar to those surround
ing the witnesses who testified.

"Coffee had the peculiar effect on me of

pays a young lady of Sheldon, Neb., "and
fo long es I used the drug coffee I had
terrific headaches frequently accompanied
by sour Btomach and a very bad breath.

were coffee drinkers. They were certain-

they could not get coffee Btrong
enough for them and my father in par-
ticular was a clave to coffee, drinking
many cups cf it dally, although he had
terrific headaches about once a week,
while ray mother complained of her liver

to no avail.
"Then I persuaded them, to quit coffee

saw Davia, who had silently climbed out
of the dock, sneaking along past the
bencli.
Donohoe Jumped up and grabbed hold
of Davis, who said he wanted to go to
the lavatory. Donohoe replied that If
he had asked him he would have opened
the gate of the dock and taken him out.
Donohoe started with Davis to the lav
atory, but when within a few yards of
the " door Davis made a break and got
among thÂ© crowd in the corridor. Dono
hoe shouted and Officer McCurrie of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals grabbed hold of Davis, who was
led back to the dock and the handcuffs
placed over his wrists.

Walcott arrived" on the spot a few min
utes after the accident, totally unaware
of what had happened, and made inquiry
for her husband.
At that moment their feet struck the
beach, the water being only breast high,
but such was the force of the tide rip
that they were unable to make any head
way shoreward and were repeatedly car
ried back and forth, one moment gaining
the shore and the next losing their foot
hold, until the continuous buffeting by the
waves almost completely exhausted them.
Nichols managed to reach shore and
was taken In an unconscious condition
to a place of safety. Walcott disappeared
In view of many spectators.

surf which was stronger to-day than It
had been for many months. The men had
successfully laid one end and were re
turning to the beach when they were
overtaken in the surf by a monster
wave, which swamped the boat, com
pelling the occupants to Jump into the
water.

SANTA ROSA, Nov. 10.â A petition was
filed here to-day by Charles E. Paxton
In which 'he requests the Superior Court
to remove his brother, Blitz W. Paxton,
president of the Santa Rosa Bank, from
his position as one of tho executors of
the estate of their deceased mother,
Hannah H. Paxton. Penalng the hearing
it is asked that he be suspended as ex
ecutor.
In support of this request Charles Pax
ton makes a number of ctiarges against
his brother. He aJIesres embezzlement of
funds, mismanagement of tho estate and
other things. He charges his brother with
having purchased stock In the Santa Rosa
Bank, of which he is president, with
money belonging to the estate of which
they are joint heirs without making a
proper accounting, and alleges that this
stock was purchased with money In his
hands as confidential agent of his mother
and issued In his name. He further as
serts that Blitz W. Paxton borrowed
money on his personal notes and secured
them with stock in the bank and other
corporations and then allowed the claims
against the estate of their mother upon
her demise.
It is charged that Blitz claims certain
property as his individually, adversely to
the estate, and has Intentionally omitted
to Include the same In the accounting of
the estate. As the second executor of
the estate Charles E. Paxton alleges he
has rejected all of these cialm#and re
fused to permit them to be made claims
against his mother's estate. The Inven
tory of the estate shows $S65 79 in cash
on "hand when Mrs. Paxton passed away
and Charles E. Paxton states his belief
that the money on hand at his mother s
death exceeded that sum by many thou
sands of dollars.
Blitz W. Paxton expressed great sur
prise at the statements contained In his
brother's petition and declares that he
courts the fullest investigation of his ac
counts as executor of the estate. He em
phatically states that he nas repeatedly
offered his brother opportunities to In
vestigate the affairs and accounts of the
estate and urged him to do so. but that
he has refused. He declares that Charles
E. Paxton has threatened to ruin him.

During the examination of Jurors
Hulse sat beside his lawyers, his face
showing clearly his interest. He scanned
the face of each juror with an anxiety
he could not conceal.
The prisoner's counsel excused several
talesmen on peremptory challenges after
th-jy had been unable to disqualify them
by questions. If as good progress Is
made to-morrow the jury 'should be com
plete by the close of the day.
The courtroom was crowded during
the morning, but in the afternoon the at
tendance fell off as It became evident
that the only outlook was for a long and
monotonous cross-examination of candi
dates for the Jury. The taking of evi
dence will probably begin about Thurs
day.
BAKERSFIELD. Nov. 10.â The work
of securing a Jury to try Alfred W.
Hulse, the companion of outlaw McKin
ney, for the murder of William E. Tib
bet, after dragging through much of the
day, progressed wifli more rapidity to
ward the close of the day. Late in the
afternoon one juryman after another be
gan to qualify and by the time Judge
Mahon adjourned court there were five
men In the jury box duly sworn to try
the case.
The John and Winthrop cruised long
and faithfully. Hope deferred, however,
ciekens even a whaleman's heart, and
tweuty mtvtu days ago Captain Macomber
eaid good-by to the Okhotsk Sea with its
educaied whales and headed for San
Francisco. Ten barrels of oil and 150
pour.es of bone is all the cargo the bark
brought home with her.
Stephen Behan. the John and Win
throp's steward, died November 1 and
xmM burled at sea. The day after, in lati
tude 43 north, longitude 145 west, a heavy
rotary gale struck the ship. This cir
cular disturbance had rolled all the way
from the tropic and at noon of November
2. when ft arrived in the vicinity of the
John and Winthrcp, it was spinning at a
dizzy pace. It came first from the north,
ewung swiftly to the west and continued
boxing the compass for several exciting
hours, finally making Its exit to an ac
companiment of hailstones and vicious
little squalls.
The o1<l vfcallnff bark John and Â¦Win
throp arrived yesterday from her annual
blubber hunt and stowed below her
hmlchCM was a- very modest harvest. The
whaleman Â¦with the telescopic eyes was
stationed in the crow's nest throughout
the cruise. He performed his duty faith
fully and his vigilance was freely re
warded, for he sighted many whales. Big
whales, little whales, middle-sized vrhalcs:
whole schools of whales; some of them
thrashing their way through the water
as if to some far country bound, others
playfully sporting about in cumbrous,
gleeful idleness. At times It seemed to
the John and Winthrop watchers that
there were more whales than water and
more than once the tight little bark came
perilously close to taking a whaleback
ride. There were plenty of whale, but, ac
cording to Captain Macomber of the last
arrived of the fleet, they were all edu
cated whales, to whom dodging harpoons
and patent bombs came as easy as spout-
Ing water or swallowing baby herring.
Six whales allowed the harpoon-throw
ers to score hits, but as soon as the
pain from the pronged spears became an
noying a ciuirk dive and a few flips of
the tail brought about a separation from
the hunters' line, and in distressing euc
ccsidon the half-dozen prizes escaped.
AUGUSTA. Ga.. Nov. lO.-Rear Admiral
Lester Anthony Eearclslee, U. S. N., re
tired, died suddenly to-night of apoplexy.
The admiral was In the city most of th-Â»
day, attending the street fair, and until
11 o'clock to-night there v.as no sign of
Illness. The body will be sent to Wash
ington to-morrow, where it will be cre
mated.
BOSTON, Nov. 10.â John Mitchell, pres
ident of the United Mine Workers of
America, presided for a time this after
noon at the convention of the American
Federation of Labor, and he received a
greeting from the delegates which was as
Blncere and spontaneous as It was enthu
siastic. Cheer' after cheer resounded
through Fanouil Hall, the place of meet-
Ing, both from delegates and spectators.
It was Mitchell's nrsl appearance as a
speaker at the convention.
The day was devoted to receiving re
ports from committees and disposing of
the cases of protested delegates. The re
port of the executive council, a review of
subjects the board had considered during
the year, occupied the greater part of the
forenoon eession. The report decried the
Jurisdiction disputes between affiliated
unions. It contained all the correspond
ence with President Roosevelt In the
Miller case at Washington, but refrained
from comment upon the matter. The fea
ture of the afternoon session aside from
Mitchell's appearance as Â¦ presiding of
ficer was â¢ the general discussion of the
report of the committee on credentials,
which recommended that Delegates Guild
and Steel' of the International Journey
men Bakers and Confectioners and Dele
gate Jones of the Central Labor Union of
Burlington, Vt. f be not seated because ir
regularly selected as delegates^ This re
port was finally accepted.
President Gompers' declaration that the
great danger which confronts the federa
tion is the Internal strife which confronts
the affiliated unions over the Jursidlctlon
of trades was the chief topic of discus
sion among the delegates. It was gener
ally accepted that some decided action on
this matter would be taken.
It is understood that the Miller case
will be brought before the convention
later. While the executive council made
no comment on the correspondence, It as
eerted that the trades union movement
stands for the strictly union shop and dis
courages the recognition of the "open
shop."
At 4:40 o'clock the convention adjourned
until to-morrow.
DENVER, Nov. 10.â A jspeclal to the
Republican from Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
says that all the mines In that district
except the Midland closed to-day. The
Midland belongs to the Rocky Mountain
Fuel Company and has twenty-eight men
working-, but some of these are union men
and may yet come out. The Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company's mines at Spring
Gulch, South Canyon and New Castle axe
closed. The strikers here number be
tween 300 and 400. The men here had
asked permission to continue at work as
they were satisfied, but when the strike
order came to-day It was promptly
obeyed.
A dispatch from Lafayette, Colo., the
principal camp of the Northern Colorado
district, says none of the amall Inde
pendent mines which were reported work
ing yesterday are open to-day. The
owners signed the union agreement, but
refused to make the contract for a year
and the men were called out.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 10.â Railroad stocks
were more affected to-day in sympathy with
the recent weakness of United States Steel
than at any time during the heavy liquidation
of that stuck. The sharp rebound in prices at
the end of the day gave room for supposition
that much of the selling of railroad stocks was
for short account, and room traders found. the
supply scanty when they attempted to cover
their shorts. The demonstrative way in which
the break In railroad stocks was heralded and
tipped from professional quarters furthered the
suspicion of the professional character Â«f the
celling. Â¦ United States Steel ended to-day un
changed from last night, although it sold at
one time at 49-%. The relaxation of the severe
pressure against this stock seemed to deprive
the bears of some of their war material and
further their disposition to cover. It was gen
erally expected that some further cut in the
prices of eteel would be announced to-day as a
result of meetings among authorities in the
trade and the failure of these announcements
was a relief to. the United States Steel securi
tis. The number of chares of Pennsylvania
dealt in rofce considerably over the number of
United States Steel preferred, but Pennsyl
vania stock is In $50 or half shares. The acute
weakness of this stock, which sold down to
$114 12%. had much to do with the general
weakness developed In the other railroad
stocks. It was reported that a large loan by
a. trust company, in which Pennsylvania stock
figure* to an important extent as collateral

EUREKA SUMMARY.
Cool weather prevailed during the week-
Rain Ml In all sections on the 4th and 7thjin
fome flacks amounting to over one inch. The
rain damaged raielns and late grapes to some
rxtent but was otherwise very beneficial In
starting erase and softening the soil. There
w-aa a light hailstorm at Rosewood on the
4th Oranpe harvest has commenced In the
Oroville district and shipments are in progrew:
the crop ie reported good. Late grapes are still
l*lng fh'.ppea from Eacrcroer-to. The deciduous
Trult crcp is all gathered and under cover.
Manv farmers have commenced plowing and
iw<ll'ng since the rain. Cattle are in fair con
dIU Â° n COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.
The temperature Curing the week was nearly
normal, but. cooler weather prevailed at the
close and light {rosts occurred In some sec
tions. Rain fell in nearly all parU of the
State except BouthTti California, and heavy
logÂ« were frequent in the coa*t district.
The rain in tome sections was sufficient to
nart grass and tofu-n the soil for plowing, but
ua* generally too light to be of material bene
fit in the. central end Â«outhern dietricw. Late
grapes and unprotected raisins were slightly
tl&maÂ£ed. Grape shipments continue and
wineries are nnif-hinc up the seasons run.
rUifciae and dried fruits are practically all
shelttre-d. Canneries are still in operation in
.-..:?i<- Â«ectipns. Walnut harvest continues and
a good crcj? is reported in Ventura County;
the nuts are of excellent quality in all districts.
Olive* are in Rood condition. Orange ship
ment* are in progress In the Oroville and Por
lervttle districts, where the yield i* reported
excellent: Southern California oranges are
i-olorlng and prospect* Â«re good for u. heavy
â¢ mp. Table errepef of superior quality are
jtbundar.t in local markets.
Com ricking and potato digging continue and
fair crops are being harvested. All other
crops are' under cover. Flowing has been re
turned in many places sine* the rain and some

Â¦ The cold weather had a depressing. effect on
the; fruit market and checked trade in several
descriptions, particularly In Grapes â¢ and Ber
ries. Receipts of Raspberries and large Straw,
berries, * while more liberal . than .on the ' pre
ceding day, were not very heavr and prices
ranged lower. Longworth Strawberries formed
a -very small percentage of the receipts and
prices were firmer. 'Grapes in large boxes were
easy, receipts being liberal and the carry-over
from. the preceding day large. The top quota
tion was an extreme figure for fancy Muscat
and Black and was obtained only for small
parcels. Crates and small boxes were In mod
erate receipt and . steady. . The Apple market
was quite active "and fancy offerings' of the
red varieties, such as Spltzenbergs and Bald
wins, which were in small supply, met with a
good demand. An assorted carload of fancy
Oregon stock was marketed. The car con
tained quite a few Spltzenbergs. which were
offering at $2 25 per box. Christmas Apples
appeared from Coloma and were offering at $3
per box. but were not sold, having arrived too
late for the regular trade. Figs were offering
in small quantities and sold slowly at unsteady
prices. Prices of all other deciduous fruits
stood as previously quoted.
A carload of new Jaffa Oranges from Paler
mo was marketed and offered at $2 50Â®3 per
box, but . moved slowly owing to the cold
weather. Otherwise there was nothing new
to report in Citrus fruits. . '

-There was no particular news from Chicago,
which was lower on the day. A Board of Trade
operator, in a Btatement to the press, said:
Vlf there is no mishap in the Argentine we will
have a new competitor in selling .Wheat by Jan
uary 1.' It looks as if there would be a crop
there'of over â¢ 100.000,000 bushels, and the only
thing that can now overcome it is wet weather.
It does not look like a bullish situation, with
this country almost 40,000,000 bushels behind
last year In its exports." -

administered corporal punishment to a

a humiliation to a lady principal.

corded a public hearing recently on

Miss Dwyer did not punish the boy ex
cessively, while another is of the opinion
that Miss Dwyer 6hould not be called to

W. Mills, foreman at Pomona, was given
the title of superintendent of the South
ern California sub-station. Hereafter he
is to be engaged largely in the direction
of the university's co-operative field work
in the orchards of Southern California.
A. A. Knowlton of Chico, formerly a
member of the faculty of the University
of Wisconsin was appointed patron of
the Chioo forestry station.
R. S. Holloway, temporarily appointed
as Instructor in the department of edu
cation, was appointed to hold his position
fcr the rest of the fiscal year.
Prcsidfnt Wheeler drew the attention
of the Regents to the absolute need of
fire-proof buildings for the university.
President Wheeler stated that on the pre
vious day the university buildings had
been endangered* by the burning of a cot
tage on the grounds and that but for the
extension of the university water system
many buildings might have been de
stroyed
President Wheeler said the town supply
of water was entirely inadequate for fire
purposes. He also spoke of the darjger
that always threatened the botany build
ing where a valuable collection of Cali
fornia fauna was stored. He urged that
a fire-proof building be secured for the
botany department. The Regents took
President Wheeler's statements under ad
visement.
MONTGOMERY AVENUE BONDS.
The finance committee reported that A.
Holliday had made an offer to collect the
money represented by the Montgomery
avenue bonds, issued by the city and
county of San Francisco. The regents
hold $22,000 worth of these bonds and Hol
liday is willing to try to collect them and
if successful take one-half of the pro
ceeds. The committee favored giving
Holliday the power to act. ;
Regent Hellman said the bonds were
practically lost to the university. Many
owners had agreed to allow Holliday to
try to recover the amount of the bonds.
Regent McEnerney said the chance of
recovering was very remote, but favored
giving authority to Holliday to act.
Regent Charles S. Wheeler, was op
posed to taking any action that might af
fect the titles to certain property owners
in San Francisco and thus cause antag
onism to the university. The resolution
to ellow Holliday to proceed as regarding
the bonds held by the university pre-
The sale of the medical college building
on Stockton street by the finance com
mittee for the sum of $4750 was confirmed
by the regents.
The recommendation of the finance
committee that $1000 be appropriated to
the department of Celtic philology was
adopted.
Routine bills recommended for payment
by the finance committee were approved.
DECIDES TO APPEAL CASE.
The work of testing the varieties of
fruits, grapest grains and forage plants
suitable for the Sierra foothill region had
been carried on for fifteen years and the
results had been given to the agricultural
population of the State.
ABOLISH SUBSTATIONS.
Regent Chester Rowell presided, and
those present were Regents Alden Ander
son, A. S. Fisk, R. J. Taussig, J. A.
Britton. John E. Budd, F. W. Dohrmann,
Guy C." Earl, C. N. Ellinwood. I. W.
Hcllman, Garreti^Enerney, J. B. Rein
stein, Charles S. Wheeler, P. C. Yorke
and President B. I.Wheeier of the Uni
versity of California.
The most important work done by the
Regents was the adoption of a resolution
reeonveytng " certain lands near Jackson,
Amador County, formerly used as an ex
perimental station, to the orjginal donors.
President Wheeler of the State Univer
sity presenteu his report, in which he
stated that there was no further use for
the experimental station in Question and
that co-operative work with ranchers and
farmers had caused the experimental sta
tion to be of no further value.
The regular monmly meeting of the Re
gents of the University of California was
held yesterday afternoon at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art, on California
street.
The police at the Central station are
investigating a burglary that occurred in
Coppe's restaurant, 619 Montgomery
street, some time Monday night. The
burglars secured $250 in cash from where
it had been concealed in one of the table
drawers in the dining-room. Suspicion
falls on an ex-employe and detectives are
searching for him.
The proprietor of the restaurant on clos
ing soon after 8 o'clock Monday night
took all the money in the establishment
and placed it in a dining-room table draw
er, where thieves would be most unlikely
to look for it. He has been in the habit
of doing this for some time past and was
not aware that any person knew of its
hiding place. Yesterday morning when
he opened his place for business the
money was gone and the police were im
mediately notified and detectives placed
on the case.
The detective ascertained that a for
mer employe of the restaurant, who was
discharged a short time ago. was in pos
session of a key to the place during his
employment there. This, however, was
surrendered at the time of his discharge.
The detectives point to the fact, how
ever, that he may have had a duplicate
made and retained it for future use. Tho
proprietor believes his ex-employe may
have known where the money was kept,
but*he is not positive on that point.
In addition to the names of others who
have been mentioned in The Call as being
certain to receive appointments, it may
be noted that Dr. A. S. Adler, who was
once appointed on tho Health Board by
Mayor Schmitz in his attempt to remove
the old board, would like to be City Phy
sician to succeed Dr. Joseph G. Morrts
sey, who will also be retired next Jan
uary. Thomas Egan, present storekeeper
of the Board of Education, is also being
considered for promotion by Mayor
Schmitz. â¢
Notwithstanding the fact that Mayor
Schmitz has definitely announced that he
will not take up the question of his ap
pointments on the various boards and
commissions of the municipal government
until after December 15 next, gossip still
continues to discuss the na'mes of. those
who stand splendid chances of picking
some of the official plums which his
Honor will have at his disposal next Jan
uary.
It is said with an assurance that Is al
most positive, that when the Mayor has
assumed control of the Board of Health
with the appointment of two new mem
bers Frank Schmitz, the Mayor's brother,
will be at .once appointed superintendent
of the City and County Almshouse to
succeed William J. .Kelly, who will suc
cumb to the fortunes of political warfare.
Schmitz was formerly building superin
tendent, but was forced out of his posi
tion owing to the stand taken by Presi
dent Casey of the Board of V/orks in re
taliation for the abolishing of the posi
tion of superintendent of streets formerly
held by Benjamin Heath. Casey declared
that the position of building superinten
dent could bo done away with also and
Frank Schmitz lost his job. The Mayor
hopes to even up matters by having his
brother appointed superintendent of the
Almshouse. It is understood that Mrs?.
Fabian, at present matron of the City
Prison, will be matron of the Almshouse
as soon as her marriage to Frank Schmitz
takes place, their engagement having al
ready been announced.
Morris Levy will in all probability be
appointed registrar of voters to succeed
Thomas J. Walsh. < Levy was very ijromi
nent in Mayor Schmitz's fight both at the
election when the latter first ran and at
the last one, when he was re-elected.
Levy was formerly chief deputy under
former Tax Collector Scott and was a
faithful city official.
Now that Frank Schmitz is almost sure
to be superintendent of the Almshouse
John Daughney, who was at one time
considered for the place, will in all prob
ability be named on one of the com
missions. Thomas Reagan, at present
Police Commissioner, is under considera
tion for member of the Board of Public
Works to succeed Manson, owing to the
fact that the Mayor will be unable to ap
point Election Commissioner Boyle to the
first named board because of the prohibi
tive charter provision preventing the ap
pointment of any election commissioner
until one year after the expiration of his
term.

A TEST EXPERIMENT.
Peculiar Power Possessed by a New
Medicine.
Of new discoveries there is no end, but
one of the most recent, most remarkable
and one that will prove invaluable to
'thousancls of people is a discovery which
it is believed will take the place of all
I other remedies for the cure of those com-
mon and obstinate diseases, dyspepsia and
stomach troubles. This discovery is not a
loudly advertised, secret patent medicine,
but is a scientific combination of whole-
some, perfectly harmless vegetable es-
sences, fruit salts, pure pepsin and bis-
muth.
I These remedies are combined in lozenge
! form, pleasant to take and will preserve
! their good qualities indefinitely, whereas
all liquid medicines rapidly lose whatever
good qualities they may have had as soon
as uncorked and exposed to the air.
This preparation is called Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, and it is claimed that one
of these Tablets or lozenges will digest
from 300 to SO00 times its own weight of
meat, eggs and other wholesome food.
And this claim has been proven by actual
experiments in the following: manner: A
hard boiled egg cut into small pieces was
placed in a bottle containing warm water
heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat); one of these Tablets was then
placed in the bottle and the proper tem-
perature maintained for three hours and
a half, at the end of which time the egg
was as completely digested as it would
have been in a healthy stomach. This ex-
periment was undertaken to demonstrate
that what it would do in the bottle it
would also do in the stomach, hence Its
unquestionable value in the cure of dys-
pepsia and weak digestion. Very few-
people are free from some form of Indi-
gestion, but scarcely two will have the
same symptoms. Some will suffer most
from distress after eating, bloating from
gas in the stomach and bowels; others
have acid dyspepsia or heartburn; others
palpitation or headache, sleeplessness,
pains in chest and under shoulder blades,
extreme nervousness as In nervous dys-
pepsia, but they all have the same cause â
failure to properly digest what is eaten.
The stomach must have rest and assist-
ance, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give
it both by digesting the food for it, and in
a short time it is restored to its normal
action and vigor. , At. the same time the
Tablets are so harmless that a child can
take them with benefit. This new prepa-
ration has already -made many astonishing
cures, as, for instance, the following:
After using only one package of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia ; Tablets I have received
such great and unexpected benefit that I
wish to express my sincere gratitude. In
fact, it has been six months since I took
the package, and I have not had one par-
ticle of distress o: difficulty since. And all
this in the face of the fact that the best
doctors I consulted told me my case was
Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely incura-
ble, as I had suffered twenty-five years.
I distributed half a dozen packages among
my friends here, who are very anxious to
try this remedy. - â¢* .. ...
