SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1903.
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
Ruef ought not to be in the Republican council listening to the plans of campaign when the
party leaders are organizing the forces for the clash of , battle. The : leadership of - the party in this
campaign is placed in the hands of Henry J. Crocker, 'and every man who is privileged to participate
in making preparations for the fight should be + absolutely loyal to the leader. Daylight conferences in
the Republican camp and midnight interviews in 1 the camp of the enemy might suit the fancy of Ruef,
but the loyal Republicans of. San Francisco. expect trie Â¦campaign to be conducted on fair and square
lines. "If Ruef is a non-combatant- let him go to his proper place in the rear. If he is a Democrat let
him get into the Democratic camp. If he is a Union Labor man let ; him, join the Schmitz faction or
the other faction of the Union, Labor party..- If he is a Republican let him go to the . front and fight
for the whole Republican ticket. Â¦'..; * ' .
Should Be Excluded From t(epubllcah Councils.
If Mr. Ruef did not occupy a place in the Republican convention as- a delegate duly elected: by
the Republican voters of his district, 1 and if he did not occupy a place in the inner advisory council of
the United Republican League; ho one would- have the right to question his personal preferences.
When he accepted, however, a commission from his constituents to serve the Republican party in. a
nominating convention he surrendered, the right to give his. support -tothe nominee of another party.
The purely personal plea is utterly absurd. Ruef is Mayor. Schmitz's political adviser, and the'mo
tives which guide his action are political. ..".,'
It is common belief if not .common' knowledge in the Republican household and outside of the
Republican oamp that the purely, personal reasons alluded to by -A. Ruef relate to his close personal
affiliation with the nominee for" Mayor on the â¢ Union " Labor ' ticket. It is putting.it mildly
to. say that Ruef is a spectacular faker, but hisfaking lacks the skill to deceive Republicans. He poses
as the one delegate in the 319 men comprising 'the Republican convention who cannot openly indorse
a Republican nominee that has the unreserved support of 318 delegates. It is plain that Mr.-Ruef
reserves the special privilege to himself of supporting some candidate for Mayor other' than Henry
J. Crocker. That reservation may be acceptable to Mr. Ruef and it 'may not incur the displeasure of
Mr. Crocker, but it is. not acceptable 1 to the. Republican voters of Sari! Francisco, who aÂ«e putting for
ward an exceptionally good' ticket and inviting every loyal- Republican'to fall in line for the battle at
the polls. ... "... V ,'",.,.. ."'; ' , ," .
Ruefs Spectacular. Faking Does Not Deceive.
The convention at one time seemed to be just on the verge of a scene. The Forty-fifth As
sembly District responded to the first rollcall of last evening's session with announcement that
fifteen delegates were present. On the call of the roll'f or the Mayoralty nomination A. Ruef, chair
man of the delegation, arose in his- place on the floor of the convention and -announced fourteen
votes for Mr. Crocker. Th<G announcement created some confusion. Ruef signaled to the presiding"
officer of the convention a desire to utter an explanation. â¢ His explanation was a simple declara
tion that the chairman of the Forfy^fifth delegation, for reasons purely personal, refrained - from vot-*
ing. Subsequently Mr. Ruef participated in the deliberations^of the convention by voting, to nomi
nate Sheriff, Auditor, Tax Collector and Treasurer.. ._; . :
THE Republican local convention last evening nominated Henry J. Crocker for Mayor,
Henry H. Lynch for Sheriff,' Harry Baehr for Auditor, E. J., Smith for Tax Collector aiid
John E. McDougald for Treasurer. The nominations were made by acclamation. The ut
most harmony prevailed throughout the session. The unity in the ranks of the party was a theme
dwelt upon by the speakers, and the predictions of Republican success at the polls on November 3
elicited great demonstrations of applause from the delegates on the floor of the convention and the
vast audience in the galleries. The nomination of Mr. Crocker for Mayor was received with signs
of approval. His brief speech accepting the honor bestowed upon him by his fellow citizens of'Repub
lican faith was modest and manly. He did not attempt flights of oratory, but in simple style pledged
his adherence to the principles set forth in the platform, and to render to San Francisco whatever
service it was in his power to give. ;

PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 23.â In an un
successful attempt made by four masked
men to hold up and rob the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation overland train leav
ing Portland to-night at 8:15 o'clock one
of the robbers was shot and instantly
killed and Engineer Ollie Barrett of Port
land was wounded. Express Messenger
Fred Corner fired the shot that killed
the robber and the bullet, after passins
through the bandit's body, wounded the
engineer.
- The men had badly bungled the job
after having successfully stopped the
train and compelled the engineer and fire
man to accompany them in their work.
Instead of attacking the express car they
blew open the door of the baggage car
with dynamite. The noise aroused the
express messenger and he opened his door
and fired at the leading bandit, who stood
at the time but a few feet from him.
The death of the unknown bandit, appar
ently the leader of the party, disheartened
the others and they abandoned the at
tempt to rob the train. 'Not a shot was
fired In return and the ; robbers escaped
before the express messenger could fire
again.
BANDIT IS KILLED.
' The holdup was attempted on the curve
west of a tunnel. Two masked men stole
aboard the train at Troutdale, hiding on
the "blind" end of the baggage car. A
short distance out from Troutdale the
men crept over the tender and covering
Engineer Barrett anfl Fireman Stevenson
with their revolvers, ordered the train to
proceed to a point near mile post 21.
When this spot had been reached the ban
dits ordered the engineer to stop.
. Two other men joined the bandits at
the mile post and the four ordered the
engineer and fireman to accompany them
back to the express car. The robbers,
apparently Ignorant of train formation
and very nervous, attacked the baggage
car. When the doors were not opened
they promptly used dynamite and blew
the door open.
Though he had been ordered, with the
fireman, to keep ahead of the party. En
gineer Barrett managed to slip behind, the
leader. As . the door to the express car
was opened and Corner's gun was poked
out. Barrett was standing directly behind
the man who was under the door. Cor*
ner fired immediately, the bullet instantly
killing the robber and wounding the en
gineer. The. other bandits, frightened by
the shot, retreated.
BAFFLED HOBBEBS ESCAPE.
Engineer Barrett was carried Into the
baggage car and the train was run into
Corbetts, where a telephone message was
sent to Portland to notify the railway of

A bye-eiection was held at Rochester to

Meantime every detail of the negotia
tions for filling the vacancies in the Cabi
net is submitted to the Kink who, for the
time being, has transformed Balmoral In
to the political center of the empire from
â¢which, owing to the unusual influences
at work, several surprises may emanate.
Whatever the results may be they can
*>afe!y be attributed in a lar^e extent to
the King's interest In the crisis.
VICTORY FOB CONSERVATIVES.
Dealing with the surmises upon come
of the foregoing points, the Morning Ad
vertiser to-day said:
"The King in this national emergency
resolved to play the part of a ruler in
stead being content with that of a
figurehead."
This decision has not prevented the
King telling the Ministers that he wanted
something done to improve the military
muddle and that he hoped some man
â¢would be appointed who, with the com
mission's report as a basis, would be
capable of changing the system which
rendered inefficiency unavoidable. The
question of having some general, notably
Lord Kitchener, as head of the War Of
fice has been keenly discussed at Balmor
al' between the King and the Ministers,
but the consensus of opinion was that
such an appointment would be Interpret
ed as a modified form of military dictat
orship, which the public would not sanc
tion.
After the long conversations he has had
during the last few days at Balmoral'
Â¦with Lord Lansdowne, Bfiodrick, Lord
Esher, who was president of the South
African war commission; Lieutenant Gen
eral Kenny-Kelly and other military au
thorities, the King is said to have ex
pressed the opinion that Lord Lans
<3ownfc's record as War Secretary was
due more to the badness of the system
then In vogue than to any defect in Lord
Lansdowne's own Judgment. King Ed
ward has not shared the keen public in
dignation against Lord Lansdowne arous
ed by the report of the South African war
commission, and after a minute examina
tion of the circumstances he is under
ctood to have consented to his lordship
continuing as Foreign Minister.
WANTS SYSTEM CHANGED.
Though vith his usual tact the King
has refrained from expressing any polit
ical views or infringing on the Ministers'
prerogatives, this has not prevented him
expressing his desires, amounting almost
to a command, that steps be taken to
remedy the scandals in the army admin
istration, revealed by the report of the
Bouth African war commission, and in
sisting: that the new Cabinet shall be one
Adapted to deal with that question.
To such an extent is the King holding
his power of^veto In reserve that he is
now almost regarded by the Inner circles
as more the Cabinet maker than Balfour
himself.

era.
Premier Balfour's continued presence
at Balmoral has given rise to much sur
mise and comment, but the Associated
Press Is able to state definitely that It is
the King's determination not to assent to
the formation of a new Cabinet until
thoroughly satisfied that Its personnel
and combination is such as to insure the
efficient carrying out of national affairs
pending the resumption of Parliament.
For years previous Cabinets were ap
pointed or Ministerial vacancies filled by
the mere presentation to the sovereign of
the naaes of the new Ministers. King
Edward n<*s done swer xrlLh this-tradi
tion. lie has spent the last few days In
constant conference v.ith Balfour as to
the advisability, from the point of view
of the welfare of the nation, of the lat
ter's suggested appointments. Ministers
r.ow holding office and these nominated
for office have been summoned to Bal
moral to join in these conferences and all
have been subjected to a degree of Inter
rogation such as has surprised even those
wbo knew King Edward Intimately as
the Prince of "Wales.
LONDON. Sept. 23.â The political crisis

After spending twenty-one years in San
Quentin for a crime of which they claim
they were innocent, Frank P. Gilkey and
Tobias Richards are anxiously waiting
for the day that will give them their
freedom. Both the men are life termers,
convicted on circumstantial evidence of
the murder of an aged German named
William Bergel in Sonoia. Gilkey was
sentenced to life imprisonment In San
Quentin. Richards, realizing that the
same fate awaited him. pleaded guilty
and was given a similar sentence. James
T. Booker, formerly constable of Sonoma,
who is at present In this city, la satisfied
that both Rlcharfl3 and Gilkey are inno
cent and Is doing all In his power to In
terest the Governor in their behalf.
Armed with affidavits, which conclusively
show that the men are not guilty cf the
murder charged to them. Booker cou
fldently expects that they will soon be
liberated.
One of the affidavits is sworn ta by
Mrs. Spooner, formerly the wife of.
'Charles Tubbs, who at the time of the
murder was well known In Sonora. She
swears, that Tubbs on the night of the
murder returned home in a drunken con
dition. Before retirfng he took from his
pocket a dirk knife, the blade of which
was covered with blood, and hid It un
der the mattress of the bed. Shortly af
ter the conviction of the two men Tubbs
disappeared and has not been seen since.
The other affidavits are sworn to by
James M. Watson and his wife El'a. Both
these affidavits were tiled, along with
other papers, with the Governor in May
last, but v.-ere subsequently withdrawn.
The affidavit of Mrs. Spooneij, Brooker
believes, will materially assist In estab
lishing the innocence of Richards and
Gllkey.
MUEDER OF BERGEL.
In February. 1SS1. William Bergel. who
kept a saloon on the Sonora and Mono
road, about two miles from Sonora, and
who was supposed to have considerable
money, was murdered some time during
the night. His body was found the next
day In the rocks back of the building. He
had been stabbed through the neck and
there was a sheet tied tightly around his
neck.
Frank Gllkey, who lived about a mile
above Bergel's place, found the body.
Gilkey and Bergel had been fast friends.
Gilkey acted as chie.f mourner at the fu
neral and was principal witness at the
Coroner's inquest. Three days later Sher
iff McQuade, now deceased, arrested Gil
key on suspicion. That nighÂ£ Gllkey
pleaded with the Sheriff to let him go
out home and see his wife on Important
business. After considerable persuasion
on Gllkey's part. McQuade saddled Gil
key's horse, which was in the Jailyard,
brought It to the front of the jail and
let Gllkey go, directing him to take a
circuitous route so as not to go through
the city. McQuade had also saddled his
own horse and when Gilkey had started
he followed him. Gllkey went to a neigh
bor's house and called him up. McQuade
crawled up close enough to hear, part of
thÂ« conversation.
BETT7RNS TO JAIL.
"When Gllkey was ready to return, Mc-
Quade rode home and shortly afterward
Gilkey reappeared at. the Jail. He asked
McQuade If he had followed him. Me-
Quade replied "No," Gilkey replying,
"Well, somebody was pretty close to me,
as my horse warned me." Xext day At
chlson, the person Gllkey Interviewed,
was arrested and he!d as a witness and
Tobias Richards, who had gone to the
lower part of the county, was also ar
rested. Gllkey was found guilty of mur
der In the first degree and sentenced to
San Quentin for life. Richards pleaded
guilty with the understanding he was to
receive the same sentence. They are still
In San Quentin. At the trial the Jury
stoood 11 for murder in the first degree
with the death penalty, but one Juryman
held out for recommending a life sen
tence, which was finally adopted. Gllkey
was a married man and had two sons.
His wife has since married and resides In
Sonora at this time.

The good fellowship committee met im
mediately after adjournment and decided
not to change the report which will be
sent to the convention to-morrow.
Rev. Mr. Dole had offered a resolution
commending the ministers for the excel
lent discharge of their duties, when Rev.
Richard Boynton, a/young minister of St.
Paul, arose and ln a spirited speech asked
for information as to just what Unitarian
theology was. He said he had tried to
discover it, but had failed, and he chal
lenged any minister present to define It
Rev. Mr. Grant, formerly of Newburg
N. Y., explained that Unitarian ministers
have a theology or they have no right to
the pulpit. He said the foundation stone
of Unitarianism is that man is to God as
a child Is to a father; that with this aa a
basis Ideals of manhood could be realized.
The meeting resumed a calm attitude
after this and a report by Dr. Edward
Horton of Boston, which contained a
clause making it necessary for an appli
cant for a certificate to go on probation
for six months previous to being accepted
to full membership, was referred for fur
their consideration to-morrow.
ATLANTIC CITY, Sept. 23.-At to
night s meeting of the conference of the
Unitarian ministers there waa quite a stir
made when It was proposed to exclude the
newspapermen from the room because the
ministers were about to *talk of things
that wero of a private nature to the sect.
Opposition was made to this by some of
the delegates present and the reporters
remained. Rev. D. P. Dole of Boston pre
sided, and when the debate grew quite

moved that the doors be closed and ah ex

RICHARDS WAS FRIGHTENED.
Tobias Richards was also seen in the
prison yard. He was Interrogn.;e<f about
the facts of the case, but was particularly
non-committal. He said:
Oh. I don't like to talk about our trouble. I
made a Very foolish blunder and by this mis
take not only ruined my own life, but ruined
my friend's life as well. We were both In
nocent, but I was scared into the thing. They
told me that everything was sure and that If
we did not confess it would cost the county
lots of money and that the people all believed
we were guilty and would lynch us. I could
not prove an alibi and had no money or many
friends. 1 was only 28 years old at the time

would agree if I would. Frank stood trial,
though, but it waa no use. When we both
came here I gave up the Idea of ever getting
out again. When Mr. Booker interested him
self in our case I felt hopeful, but that was
ten years ago. If The Call will publish our
story it will help us out, though
Some time ago numerous complaints
from various shipping firms, among them
the owners of the oil transport Rosen*
crans. were filled with the authorities in
"Washington to the effect that the Oak
land Creek was rapidly filling up and that
it was becoming a difficult matter for deep
sea vessels to navigate through the chan
nel. An investigation resulted in a con
tract being let for cleaning out the chan
nel for a considerable distance from its
mouth. Shortly after the dredger had
entered upon its work It developed that
as fa:-t as the debris was dumped from
the channel over into the water on the
opposite side of the north wall the tides
carried it out a distance, where it was
again washed back into the channel.
To overcome this difficulty it was de
cided to build a bulkhead out from the
end of the north wall, which would change
the course of the current and result ln
the mud being carried farther out to a
point where it would not be returned to
Its former bed. It was the building of
this bulkhead that aroused the suspicion
ln Oakland that the Southern Pacific
Companj- was scheming to grab more
land, the supposition being that the big
dredger was the property of a concern
working in the interest of the railroad.
Speaking for the American Dredging
Company, for which he is the attorney
Judge "W. S. Scctt yesterday said that
the company that has the contract for
the dredging work is in no way connected
with the railroad and It Is simply fulfill
ing its contract with the Government. He
added that the bulkhead was the only so
lution to the problem as to how the mud
from the channel could be impounded and
prevented from returning.
On the contrary it was stated that the
dredging is being done in pursuance to
a contract awarded by the Government
to the American Dredging Company and
that the construction of bulkheads is
simply to insure the success of the work
Instead of filling in the State's property

An alarm sounded among the citizens
of Oakland that tho Southern Pa

quietly grabbing a big portion of the
State's submerged property lying along
the north wall of the creek route of the

premature, for the Government officials

exemplary Inmate of the prison. Gilkey
Is head barber, and has five other con
victs working under his direction, while
Richards is an "orderly" ln the turnkey's
office. When seen at the prison to-day
Gilkey said:
Both Tobe and I have been here for more
than twenty years. AVe are Innocent and yet
are being- punished for murder. We ar* serv
ieff a life sentence for a deed we did not do
and a crime we could not have possibly com
mitted. I proved an alibi by my wife, nephew
and two other witnesses, but as they were all
related to me It seemed -flimsy. The circum
stantial evidence was so strong, and this,
talked up by Tobe pleading guilty to pave
being haneed. caused me to be convicted and
sent here for the rest of my days. If he had
stood trial, too. we would not have been here,
let I do not bltnie him. He was young and
scared Into it. They told him they would
lynch both oi us unless we pleaded guilty. He
did. and even though I tried to save him and
myself, it could not be done. There was J10U0
offered for the conviction of the guilty party,
i he county offered $ivv and the relatives added
JMJO more to it. Somebody had to be con
victed, and, as I will show you, the circum
stances pointed to us, no we got the mMlcine
and the lawyers and detectives pocketed the
prize.
On a cot at the Central Emergency Hos
pital there lies an astnl â¢ma-n \reU dressed
and spparestly of reused tastes, hovering
between Hfo nad death. He was picked
xip ln an unconscious condition early this
raoiTiiTtg in a small alleyway off Mxson
street, between Post *nd Geary, by^ a
passerby. No one saw fc-ira enter the
alley nor tras any ona seen to leave It,
yet thÂ« .police are of the opinion that
the im2ortnna.te man waa felled by a thug
in tbÂ© horÂ»es of securing plunder.
Shortly after midnight a. passerby, glv

unfortunate stranger lying on hia back
In tho alley. Ills hat was found a few
feet away, full of 'dents, which indicates
that the injured man had a heavy falL
Toznllson teamed ia t ely rans up for an
ambulance and the stranger was removed
to the Emergency Hospital. Dr. Maher
at once made a hasty examination of Bis
injuries and discovered that the trnfor

ture of the base of the sJrull. He failed
to regain consciousness and the chances
are that ho will pass away without recov
ering his senses.
The znan was well dressed and appeared
to be about 6J years of age. His clothes
are of a fine texture and bÂ«ax the name
of H_ Holmes," or "H. Halmes." In his
pockets were found a nickel watch and 35
cents in change, but no card or paper that
vo'Jld throw any light on hia identity.
At 2 o'clock this morning Patrolman

was Herman Hollum of IOCS Minna street.

from Colonel Crook a special train was
ordered from .The Dalles to -meet the pas

engineer was sent out to take the train
eastward. It was on this Dalles special
that Engineer Barrett was afterward
brought to Portland. The body of the
bandit was left lying at the scene of the
hold-up, but" Engineer Barrett is of the
opinion that his companions returned and
removed It. He believes the men had a
boat lying on the river bank and made
their escape In this manner.
When the robbers stopped the train
members of the train crew immediately
warned the passengers of the impending
peril. The conductor -rani through the
coaches crying a warning) and urging
every one tohide their valuables, and

REDDING, Sept. 23.â A queer case of al
leged deception has been unearthed ln
Modoc County. It appears that some time
ago a stranger, representing himself as a
minister of an evangelical church near
San Francisco, wrote to C. G. Pope of Al
turas that a man on his deathbed had
confessed to him that in* years past he
had wronged Pope out of a sum of money
and desired to make restitution as far as
lay in his power. Inclosed in the letter
was a pawn ticket for a piece of Jewelry,
said by the minister to be a diamond
tiara worth a large sum of money. The
self-styled minister only wanted 512 50 to
redeem the jewel, and then he would seni
It to Pope. The latter, however, was not
to be taken in, but sent the letter to the
postal authorities at San Francisco. The
"minister" has since been under police
surveillance and the Modoc man has b;en
subpenaed to appear before the United
States Grand Jury to give testimony in
an Investigation now being conducted.
Self-Styled Minister At
tempts to Fleece a
Modoc Man.
Residents in the neighborhood where
the tragedy occurred declare that more
than four shots were fired, and one bul
let crashed through the window of Mrs.
8. Caswell at 5410 Lexington avenue. This
fact led the police to believe that there
may - have been a third party to the
shooting, although there is so far no di
rect proof of this.
The Weber woman was a native of De
troit, having come here from that city
several years ago.
To-night, in searching the effects of
Mies Weber, an envelope was found ad
dressed, evidently in the handwriing of
a man, to Inocentt Talimini. In seeking
Talimini to find what he might know of
the woman or the shooting, the officers
Identified the dead man as Talimini him
self. No cause is known why Talimini
should have shot the woman, but she had
told several of her friends the day before
of a man who had been following her,
and of whom she was afraid. It is be
lieved this man was Talimini, and it is
the general theory that he shot her be
cause she refused to marry him.
The woman, when found, had been shot
twice, through the left arm and through
the left breast. Talimini was shot twice,
once through the neck and once upward
through the chin, the bullet coming out
at the top of his head. In the man's
hand was a revolver with four chambers
empty, accounting for the four shots
fired.
The body of the woman was "Identified
In a short time as that of "Mrs! Laurie,"
but when Laurie was brought to the po
lice station he said that the 'woman was
not his wife and that he did not know
the man whose body was found with
hers.
The shots that killed the man and wom
an were heard by the residents of the
neighborhood at 1 o'clock this - morning.
No movement was made to investigate
the shooting, however, and nothing was
known of the tragedy until daylight,
when the bodies were discovered by a
newspaper/ carrier.
CHICAGO, Sept. 23.-Harriet Weber and
Inocenti Talimini, a marble-cutter, were
found dead on Lexington avenue, just
south of Fifty-fourth street, early this
morning.. Both had been shot twice and,
while there are indications that the man
killed the woman and then himself, there
are other features to the case that make
it somewhat mysterious. Arthur M.
Laurie, with whom the dead woman had
made her home, will be held by the po
lice until after the inquest. There is no
evidence connecting him with the shoot
ing, but he is detained as a witness.

MYSTERY VEILS
DOUBLE TRAGEDY
Joseph Seamagi, one of the men em
ployed at the quarry, was taking a horse
and cart up a runway to the crusher and
had stopped to talk a moment with the
foreman, Biggio, when he heard the whis
tle blow once, which was a notification
to the men on the crusher to stop feed
ing it. Biggio started ..toward the fireroom
to ascertain the cause of the shut-down,
when the explosion occurred without fur
ther warning. The O'Brien boys heard the
wh|ptle and John O'Brien was engaged In
putting the cover on the hopper when he
waÂ« knocked down by the flying timbers.
Thomas Foley was working in the quarry
a short distance away from the engine
house, but could add nothing to the
knowledge of the other men employed
thero regarding the cause of the acci-
TÂ«e last man who saw Rayner alive
was Biggio and at that time the engin
eer was repairing the feed pump. Evi
dently he discovered the dangerous con
dition of the boiler Just before the acci
dent and blew the whistle to warn hia
fellow workmen. Then he probably at
tempted to pull his fire and while engag
ed in that occupation was blown to death.
The dead engineer was 25 years of age
and a native of New Zealand. He had
lived in Ocean View with his mother
since he was 5 years old and was highly
thought of. Dan O'Brien Is 36 years of
age and 'his _ brother John is^ 32. They
reside in Ocean View with their parents
The Indications are that the explosion
was caused by letting the water run low
In the boiler, although the only man who
knew positively is dead. The survivors
all tell the same story and their experi
ences are limited to the actual explo
sion. .
CAUSE OF EXPLOSION.
The boiler was a complete wreck. The
front of it was entirely blown out. The
crown j sheet was ripped from its bolts
and torn into strips like tissue paper.
Nearly every casting on the engine and
boiler was broken off by the force of the
explosion. The boiler was the worst kind
of a rattletrap affair and had been badly
neglected. ' The space under the crown
sheet was almost entirely filled with
scales, allowing little room for, water.
Immediately after the accident nearly
the entire population of the district gath
ered at the quarry. The remains of Ray
ner, crushed almost out of semblance^of
humanity, were laid out . on a pile of
sacks until the arrival of Deputy Cor
oner Fennell, when they were taken to the
Morgue. His aged mother, with whom he
lived at Ocean View, reached the scene
early and when the full realization of her
son's death burst upon her she became
hysterical. Corporal Lyons of the Police
Department took charge of the Injured
men. He telephoned for an ambulance,
but before its arrival the United Rail
roads hurried an electric car to the scene
and conveyed the two OTBriens to St.
Luke's Hospital, where they were at
tended by Dr. S. J. Gardner. Bfgglo, the
foreman, was able to walk and boarded
a car for his home at Colma.
The engine and boiler, which was an
old thresher affair,- was blown by the
force of the explosion clear out of the
quarry and onto the tracks of the electric
car line. Traffic was delayed a short
time until the wreckage could be moved
aside. The mass, weighing fully three
tons, was raised seventy-flve feet into
the air and thrown a distance of 100 feet.
The shed in which it was housed was de
molished, some of the two-inch planks
being splintered to kindling wood. In its
flight through the air the boiler and en
gine struck the top of the crusher, bad
ly wrecking It.
With a shock that made the district of
Ocean View tremble to Its foundations, a
boiler employed ln furnishing steam, for
the operation of a rock crusher
at Biggio's quarry at the junction
of San Jose avenue and Farallones street
exploded at 11 o'clock yesterday morning,
killing one" man . Instantly and seriously
injuring three others. Two others stand-
Ing within a few feet of. tho explosion
miraculously escaped without a scratch.
The dead man Is John Rayner, the en
. gineer. His body was thrown a distance
of 200 feet and landed in an unrecogniz
able mass up the hill on the edge of the
quarry. Two brothers, John and Dan
O'Brien, who were engaged in feeding the
crusher, thrown from their stand
by flying pieces of Iron and timber. Dan
O'Brien received a deep scalp wound and
a serious laceration of the left leg. He
also suffered a severe shock. Should he
recover from this, it Is not thought that
his other injuries will prove fatal. His
brother escaped with a badly bruised
shoulder and a battered face caused by
flying particles of rock. Rico Biggio, son
of the man who owns the quarry and
who acted as foreman, was bruised on the
chest and face, but not seriously Injured.

Boundary Commission. He re
ceived the thanks of Chief Justice Alver
stone and the congratulations of Messrs.
Root and Lodge on his "lucid explanation
of bo technical and comprehensive a sub
ject."
The Attorney General made It clear
that Canada wants about everything, and
the American counsel informs the Asso
ciated Press that every effort will be made
by them to convince the tribunal that the
treaty contemplated a barrier between
the Dominion and the ocean and that the
question of territory is not important pro
vided the shores and Inlets remain in the
possession of the United States.
David T. Watson of Pittsburg, of coun
sel for the American side, opened for the
United States, describing the purchase of
Alaska and Etating that the United States
published In 1867 the map Issued by Rus
sia In 1826, one year after the treaty with
Great Britain, and that no protest was
made against the boundary therein fixed,
either by Great Britain or by Canada.
Watson pointed out that It was three
years after gold was discovered In tha
Yukon Territory that Great Britain made
her first formal notification that she
would question the title of the United
States to the heads of Inlets. The cor
respondence prior theretofore referred to
the actual demarkatlon line on the
ground, but no question as to the accu
racy of the boundary claimed by the
United States, as universally shown on
the maps, had ever previously been for
mally raised by Great Britain.
A. B. Aylesworth of Canadian counsel
remarked that in 1871 Canada had no con
cern in the question and had no right to
interfere with An objection, as her terri
tory was not extended to the Pacific un
til 1871.
Watson, continuing, quoted the reports
of the Surveyor General of Canada in
1S74, agreeing that the tine was across
certain rivers which were emptying at
the head of Lynn Canal, and argued that
Canada thereby acknowledged the United
States' claim to the heads of inlets.
The commission adjourned for the day.

In Denver, Colo.; was identified as the
slayer to-day by Fridborn's sister.
Bolles was arrested here three days ago
and heldj until the arrival of Sheriff Car
berry of Denver, who reached Vancouver
this afternoon. With him was a sister of
the murdered boy. With the prisoner,
who waived extradition, Carberry left for
the south to-night. Bolles is charged
with having killed young Frldborn with
an ax when he tried to assist his sister,
who was being assaulted by the alleged
murderer. Bolles denies all knowledge
of the crime, but the girl is positive that
he is the man who assaulted her and kill

Fcr the immediate present the company Is
more likely to be embarrassed by pressure from
Canadian creditors who regard their claims as
unsecured. These creditors can afford the
greatest assistance In emergency by a little de
lay in pressing for Immediate settlement, while
not at all imperiling their richts, since the
Speyer syndicate securities will certainly be
held subject to the liabilities of current Cana
dian debts, which on the whole do not probably
amount to one and a half million dollars.
There will be certainly no dissension between
the shareholders or directors among themselves
In the arrangements now proposed, while the
sympathetic co-operation of the Speyer syndi
cate, I feel, we can depend on. It was ex
tremely unfortunate that it became necessary to
close down the works at Pault Ste. Marie,
which have been earning more than $15O,OC'O net
per month, and they will be reopened immedi
ately that the new programme should be
adopted.
The financial difficulties of the works at
Sault Ste. Marie have certainly reached a cri
sis. Mr. Shields accepted the presidency with
posiyve assurances from financial Interests in
the company that funds vrould be provided on
the first of July for the taking up of the
Speyer loan and for providing two and a ha!i
million dollars working capital. The unexpect
ed continuance of money pressure in New York
made it impossible for the fulfillment of those
promises. The attempts made to secure funds
by other means have tailed and only within
the last few days has it been necessary for me
to Â«ive personal attention to the financial re
quirements of the company. The Speyer syn
dicate Is not Rdverse to the shareholders' In
terests and will be entirely satisfied, and. I
believe, gratified, if the pror>erty can still be
saved for those whose capital he3 created it. .
PLEA FOR DELAY.

NEW TORK. Sept. 23. -Hugh McLaugh
lin. Democratic leader of Kings

day, in view of the conflicting
reports circulated for some time
regarding the position of the Kings Coun
ty Deicccracy on the proposed nomina
tion cf Congressman George B. McClel
lan for the Mayoralty, that he was will
ing to say that It Is true that the Kings
County organization regards the pro
posed nomination of McClellaa as Inad
visable because of Mr. McClellan's lntl
irate relation to the leader of Tammany
Hall end the fact that he Is not known to
the public as a strong man personally.
Should Leader Murphy Insist on McClel
la-n's nomination In the face of the oppo-
Fltion of Kings County he would. In Me-
Laughlin's opinion, "lncor a wholly un
necessary risk of defeat at the polls."
Were the reports true, as stated in
seme newspapers, that Murphy had of
fered the nomination to McClellan, the
veteran leader of the Kings Democracy
f aid he slxuld have to conclude that Mur
phy had fallen back on the old Tammany
tactics of >:.eed's time, "which brought
nothing but Mln to the party."
"Kings County," he said, "insists upon
nothing except that the nominee shall be
a Democrat likely to attract and not re

The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never Bell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to 'deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest atad
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the 'full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising, from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
.Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â " Syrup of Figs" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name or"Syrup of Figs" or *'Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold. to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.We pledge our candidates â particularly the Mayor and Supervisors^ â to an earnest, consistent and
persistent effort to make the Board of Public Works that branch of the municipal institution for which it
was designed, and to rescue it from the present state of mismanagement and extravagance. We insist that
the greater part of the funds appropriated for public purposes shall go to the men who do the work, and
not, as now, to overpaid and needless officials.
We pledge our candidates to the strictest economy in the administration of public affairs and in the
distribution of the public revenues, and we particularly pledge each of them to a strict recognition of the
provisions of the charter relating to the salaries of officers and deputies, so that neither for political or
other purposes shall such salaries be increased during the incumbency of the holders of the various offices.
We favor the appointment, whenever permitted by law, of loyal and competent Republicans to sustain
a Republican administration, State and municipal.
The people of the city and county of San Francisco have, by the adoption of the charter, estab
lished a system of civil service, and we pledge all of the candidates for office coming under that system
to a strict observance of the charter provisions, and we particularly pledge all candidates to assist in an
honest and concerted effort to the carrying out of all the charter provisions to their true intent and mean
ing, in order that the civil service system shall be relieved of its flagrant abuses and the criticisms and
charges which have been made against it in the past, and which now tend to bring it into disrepute.
. We condemn the action of the majority of the State Board of Equalization in raising the assessment
of the city and county of San Francisco. We urge the next Legislature to submit to the people of this
State a constitutional amendment providing for the election of the members of the Board of Equalization
by the whole State instead of by districts.
Whereas, We advocate a new and greater San Francisco; therefore, be it .
Resolved, That we favor the adoption J of the various bond propositions now pending, and upon
which an election will occur September 29, 19,03;. but we urge that such bonds when voted shall only be is
sued as required for the various improvements and in the prosecution thereof. -
We demand the immediate abolition of all cobblestones and other defective pavements, particularly
in the downtown business districts of this city, and that the same be replaced with modern pavements,
constructed in the most substantial manner; and the adoption of a systematic plan for doing away with,
such defective pavements in other portions of the city, and for the improvement of the county roads as
soon as the funds of the treasury will permit, and we pledge our nominees to use their best efforts to carry
out this provision of this platform".
We earnestly recommend that immediate steps be taken for the purpose of securing increased protec
tion for property against fire in this city, and particularly in the wholesale districts, and for that purpose we
advocate the adoption of the recommendations made by the Chief Engineer of the Fire Department of this
city and county.
\ We pledge our candidates to protect in every respect the interests of the people of this city in the
granting of franchises and other privileges, and to protect the property of our citizens against unjust en
croachments from corporations and other interests.
We recommend an improved system of public accounting in the several departments of the city gov
ernment, with competent and sufficient experting and supervision of accounts and records to protect the city
from error and peculation in the collection and disbursement of the public moneys, and thereby prevent
loss,. fraud and scandal.
THE Republican Municipal Convention of the city and county of San Francisco, now duly con
vened, sets forth and declares the principles of its faith and the propositions to which its candi
dates must agree in the coming campaign.
We declare ourselves loyal to the National Republican party, under whose policies, carried
by men elected by its voters, our country has made a constant and never-ceasing march to
ward the prosperity, glory and material advancement of its people.
We recognize in President Roosevelt a true American and an honest and fearless Chief Magistrate of
this republic; and we declare ourselves wholly satisfied with the manner in which he has dealt with the
many difficult questions of policy, both foreign and domestic, confronting him, and particularly do we com
mend the statesmanship displayed by President Roosevelt in his treatment of the labor troubles in Penn
sylvania.
, We commend the State adminstration, under the guiding hand of Governor George C. Pardee, as
being able, economical, patriotic and in the interest of and for the welfare of all the people of this common
wealth.
We commend the good work performed by the faithful Republican office-holders in the city and
county of San Francisco.
We favor a larger expenditure for public improvements and for the repair and extension of streets,
and we recommend that in making the annual budget the Supervisors set aside and appropriate at least 10
per cent of the annual revenue for such permanent improvements and repairs to streets and sewers.
We favor the ownership by the city of such public utilities as are beneficial and necessary for the com
mon good.

M'DOTXGALD IS POPULAR'
The first, most Important, indispensable and
absolutely requisite qualification for a can
didate for the position of City and County
Treasurer of San Francisco is Integrity. ' A
man without Integrity, but possessing all the
other essential attributes of . manhood, would
be a hindrance and a danger to this city.
I am going to follow the lead of my predeces
sors in presenting to you to-night the name
of one who has shown that he is sound, that
he is honest, that he has - integrity of the
best kind. I take pleasure â and it is a pleas
ure to nominate such a man, a personal pleas
ure, because I believe that the citizens of this
convention, following the lead of Â¦ two years
ago, > will nominate him and will, pursue their
efforts to victory and that he will be re
elected Treasurer of this city and county. I
refer to and nominate John McDougald for
Treasurer. (Cheers.) .
Leon Samuels of the Twenty-ninth As
sembly District also took the floor to
say nice things about Mr. Smith. He
told of the great Improvements wrought
by that official and of the many friend3
he had made during the last two years
by his courtesy and business methods.
Mr. Samuels said he was certain that Ed
ward J. Smith would be re-elected to the
position he now so honorably holds. There
was no opposition and Mr. Smith was
nominated by acclamation. He also was
escorted to the platform and said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention, I indorse your platform and
promise If elected to conduct the office in
the interest of the taxpayer. I thank you,
gentlemen." | .
Nominations for Treasurer were next In
order. Judge John R. Aitken was recog
nized by the chairman and ascended the
platform, to nominate "Honest John" E.
McDougald. 'When the delegates heard
McDougald's name therer was genuine en
thusiasm. The Treasurer Is extremely
popular. Judge Aitken spoke as follows:
that time, and so well has" he conducted the
office, bo perfectly has he looked after the
interests of this city, that there is not one
dissenting voice against him here to-night. I
refer to my friend Ed Smith, of my own
district. (Cheers.) South of Market street,
where he was born, north of Market street,
where he has made hundreds and thousands
of friends; out in the Thirty-fifth District,
where he has put the abode of his manhood,
every man who knows him loves him; every
man that haa grasped his hand knows that he
Is a true and upright friend. Under his ad
ministration the Tax Collector's office, has
become a model for civic government. He
has gathered !n every dollar that ought to be
gathered in; and, 1 on the other hand, he has
never for one moment worried the small tax
payer who really should not pay. I think,
gentlemen that if you will nominate Ed Smith
here to-night if you will send him out before
the people we will duplicate our success of
two years 'ago and make him again the Tax
Collector.

Governor of the State, educated in our com
mon schools; a man of unfailing gocd humor,
of- infinite popularity with the people, he was
nominated two years ago. elected to the oftlce
of City and County Treasurer, and during his
term he has handled $31,000,000 and has ac
counted for every cent of It. He is a whole
souled, genial, honest man. Some years ago
at Nevada City I heard John McDougald nom
inated for a grand office in the Native Sons,
and the delegate- who put him In nomination
referred to him as "Honest John"; and well
was that name bestowed upon him. because
he has everything that an honest man should
have; he is the very embodiment cf honesty.
I take pleasure, therefore, in nominating him.
believing that the suggestion of his name will
meet with your approval, and that he will
go forth to the people of this city this fall
to be again elected by them to handle their
funds during the coming term.
M'lXJTJGAXI* ACCEPTS.
Richard Cox and James F. Lawler also
seconded the nomination of Mr. McDou
gald. William J. Gullfoyle would not be
denied and said some nice things about the
Treasurer. Nominations being closed Mr.
McDougald was nominated by acclama-
Lpon motion of Mr. Truman the con
vention adjourned to meet to-n!ght In the
Alhambra Theater.
Mr. President, worthy delegates and fellow
citizens: I have heard the reading of you
platform and the various resolutions, which
I most heartily concur in, and I shall go forth
to maintain and promote them. It gives me
great pleasure to stand before this convention
thl 3 evening to receive your unanimous choice
for the office of City and County TreasurT
I win state that I will rive you no cause for
regret, that if elected to that honorable Doai
tlon I will faithfully perform Its uuties and
that at the end of my term there shall 'bt a
surplus on hand to pay all future demands
Thank you. "
tlon. He was escorted to the platform
and when the cheering: had ceased, spoka
as follows:
The fact is recalled that Ruef two years ago sought to have Schmitz proposed for Mayor in the
Republican convention. Ruef then said that he knew Schmitz would not be nominated, but he wanted
to place the Republican party on record as against organized labor.
The convention will meet again to-night. There are indications of a sharp fight over nomina
tions for Public Administrator and District Attorney. It was fancied at one time yesterday that the
District Attorneyship was settled, as leaders of the party, representing many delegations, invited
John S. Partridge to accept this place on the ticket. Mr,. Partridge, .however, declined the honor.
The fight is on between General E. S. Salomon and ex-Senator Frank McGowan. It was gossip last
night that John J. Greif would get the nomination for County Clerk.
There are likely to be contests over selections for the Board of Supervisors. A committee of
nine .will recommend eighteen men to the favor of the convention. The declaration of the convention
against its nominees soliciting the indorsement of other conventions is not as pointed and com
prehensive as many of the delegates hoped for. x
Continued From Page 1, Columns 3, 4 and 5.
The roll call was ordered, and as each
delegation was called the chairman arose
and announced a solid vote for Henry J.
Crocker. This continued until the last
delegation was reached, when Abe Ruef,
chairman of the Forty-fifth -Assembly
District, arose and announced fourteen
votes for Henry J. Crocker and one re
fusing to vote. Immediately there was
a clamor in â¢< the convention. Ruef stood
calm, but pale,' and waited for the noise
to cease. He then announced that the
chairman of -.the district had: declined to
vote for reasons that were- persdnal. This
was apparent to "every; one In^ the'conven
tion hall. It is known that Ruef Is Mayor
Eugene E. Schmltz's right hand man and
will support him at the coming election,
despite his affiliation with the Republican
party. Mr. Ruef spoke as follows: Â¦
Without, any. disrespect for\ the gentleman
who is . about . to b'e named as â¢ the nominee of
this convention ; I without I any I reflection what-
Robert Greer of the Forty-second Dis
trict, also seconded the nomination of Mr.
Crocker In behalf of his delegation. .
ABE RUEF EXPLAINS.
Richard Cox of the Twenty-ninth Dis.
trict also ascended the platform to pay
a tribute to the nominee. . He said he took
the platform to say:. a word in behalf of'
Mr. Crocker, whom he had known for
many years. He spoke in part as follows:
I stand here this evenilig to say one word
in behalf of a gentleman whom I have known
for many years. He Is the son of a grand
family, who settled in the Sacramento Valley
many years ago; emigrating from . there he
went to the public schools here, graduated from
the High School and finished his "tuition in the
St. Matthew's Academy at San Mateo. He has
sprung into manhood to embark in the business
community, and in all lines of commercial
business he has made a success. There Is no
doubt in my mind that If you place him' at
the head of the ticket and put your shoulders
to the wheel, united as we are to-night â some
thing which I have the grand pleasure of look
ing upon, a united convention that is no .man's
convention, but free and untrammeled â all
you have to do now is to stand shoulder to
shoulder and show what a good, united Repub
lican party can do. I thank you for your at
tention-
Again, now when great trusts ar^ crumbling,
wh?n the expansion of San Francisco's Oriental

about to bond the city with a debt or $18,000 -
000, It is an imperative necessity that we
have no professional, but a business man for
our Mayor. (Applause.) It is the duty of
this convention and the community to select
euch a safe and stalwart helmsman to guide
the party and the city through these storms
that are approaching; such a man is Henry'
J. Crocker. .
There are other things besides the party
to. consider. Just as the nation, has to -have'
a Republican , President to protect the rights
of .the Whole people, so the people of San
Francisco demand ; that a Republican Mayor
shall, be < selected to safeguard the -rights of
this community. (Applause.)' And those hopes
shall be fulfilled. Mr. Crocker, like Theodore
Roosevelt, will go before the people -as the
champion of the great tax-paying, the con
suming, as well as the laboring classes. (Re
newed applause.)
Marc Anthony of the Forty-third Dis
trict seconded the nomination of Mr.
Crocker. The young attorney spoke well
and- he. made an excellent Impression upon
his auditors. He was greeted with ap
plause when he stepped forward to speak,
and at the conclusion of his" speech wa^
loudly cheered. He spoke as follows:.
On behalf of the Forty-third Assembly Dis
trict, a united delegation, I stand before you
to second the nomination. â¢ Â¦
Our party needs a leader who reconciles;
whose nomination will be the death knell of
Republican feudg and factionalism. This can
didate will not go about seeking quarxels- he
will -not make the party a target for attack
and criticism; he stands as the embodiment
of harmony. ' . . \ ,
EULOGIZES CANDIDATE.
Republican Mayor, and the reasons. I believe,
are not very difficult to find. The conventions
that have met in past years hav e selected
good men to head our ticket, but unfortunately
the nominees of our conventions imvt not re
ceived the united support of our party. For
the first time In many years in the history
of the ' Republican party we stand united
(applause), and united we can and will elect
a Republican Mayor. (Renewed applause.)
The gentleman whose name I am about to
present to you Is a native of this State, a
business man of the strictest Integrity, popu
lar among all classes, active for the welfare
of the municipality; and If he receives the
support that I believe he will receive In this
campaign he will be the next Mayor of San
Francisco. (Cheers.) I have great pleasure
in presenting the name of Henry J. Crocker.
(Great applause.) . . .
-I: think;. 1 that ""there ;is scarcely any excuse
that' a man could give for leaving the chair
when -presiding over a -convention of such fine
and Â¦ representative Republicans as are here
to-night If he was . not going to duplicate a
victory which he inaugurated two years ago
this fall. .At that time I had the pleasure of
appearing before a municipal convention : and
naming a . man- whom the Republican -party
of San- Francisco carried into office on the
wave i of .; popular . ballots. . He ; was ? elected at
Chairman John 8. Partridge surrendered
his gavel for the nonce to ; place Â£ his
friend, Bdward J. Smith, In nomination

â¢ We. want a man in whom the citizens of
this community have . the. highest trust and
: for whom "they have the highest regard. We
.want -a , man who has established for himself
a reputation, and whose name is regarded
with honor and admiration. Such a man is
Henry H. Lynch. (Cheers.) Mr. Lynch has
lived in this community for many years. He
is well known. He has many friends and
when he goes -out. to make the fight he win
make the other fellow look pretty sick before
he gets through with him. We want a man
who will be elected, and Mr. Lynch is going
to be elected just as sure as you are all here
to-night.
We have put up a good ticket so far; let
ua continue the good work and complete a
good ticket. Therefore I hope that Mr. Lynch
.will receive the unanimous Indorsement of
every delegate, to. this convention. I thank
you, â¢ Â¦ . .
Judge George Schell of the Thirty-sev
enth Assembly District took great pleas
ure in seconding the nomination . of
-Lynch. . He said he was too well Â¦ known
in the community to need any eulogy at
his hands. He felt certain that Mr.
Lynch would be elected. Lynch received
the nomination by acclamation and was
then invited to the platform to thank
the. delegates. Mr. Lynch did not prove
an orator, but when his smiling face was
recognized by the delegates he was given
a hearty reception. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of thÂ« Con
vention: I thank you very heartily for the
way In which you have nominated me. If
elected Sheriff I shall certainly do my full
duty. I here Indorse Â¦ your platform, which
I have heard, in every particular. As I am
not a speechmaker you will have to excuse
me now. (Cheers.)
LYNCH FOR SHERIFF.
It Is hardly necessary to impress upon you
the Importance of the office of Sheriff of this
city and county. We want a man in that of
fice who at the same time combines in him
self the elements of courage, honesty, fear
lessness and sincerity. We want a man In
that office who in the discharge of his duties
will know no friends- nor foes, but one who
will administer them equally before the law
and impartially upon all citizens alike.
Mr. and Fellow 'Delegates of the
Republican Convention: This Is. a harmonious
convention. â I know it. is harmonious, because
I have been' fold so (laughter).- Therefore the
many horses and carts and others who have
come here In the expectation of witnessing
a circus will be badly fooled.
Edward >F. Treadwell, a young 1 delegate
from the Thirty-fifth Assembly District,
seconded the nomination In a short
speech and Sanford Felgenbaum of the
Fortieth Assembly District also seconded
the nomination in behalf of hla friends
and neighbors of the district. Mr. Baehr
received the entire vote of the convention
and was called before .the delegates to
express his sentiments. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con

know I will be â I will conduct the office in
the same business-like manner that I have
conducted it in the past. I heartily indorse
the pl.itform and will give the entire ticket
my full support. Thank you, gentlemen.

.1 believe in the principle that an honest and
faithful servant should be rewarded, and If you
nominate him I have no doubt the people of
San Francisco will honor him by electing him
to that Important office. In private as a suc
cessful business man, a man of family, devoted
to his domestic life, a kind and obliging neigh
bor and an enthusiastic Republican. I have
had the distinguished honor or knowing him
for the last twenty years. From my long per
sonal acquaintance and close and intimate qpn
tact with him I have had unusual opportuni
ties of observing his habits, his inclinations
and of judging his character, his ability and his
merits. He has proven hmself to be an hon
orable and conscientious gentleman, well liked
and respected by every human being who has
the honor of knowing him and meeting him.
Mr. chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion. If you want such a man, if you want a
man against whom not a word can be said,
a man who loves and respects his fellow man,
a man who would rather do- right than any
thing else on the face of the earth, one who
respects the rights of every one, who is able.
Intelligent and who has the ability and the
honesty conscientiously to perform every duty
which mav fall upon him, then I present to
you for your consideration the name of our
present Auditor, Harry Baehr.
BE WARD FOR HONESTY.
It is my particular privilege as a delegate
to this convention, representing the Fortieth
Assembly District, one of the banner Republi
can districts of San Francisco, to place In nomi
nation before you the name of a gentleman as
Auditor of San Francisco who is In every re
spect worthy of your earnest consideration and
unanimous support. I refer with extreme
pride and pleasure to the honorable gentleman
who has so faithfully, so efficiently and so sat
isfactorily performed the Important and respon
sible duties of that office for the last two
years. His record as a public official as well
as in private life is well and favorably known
to nearly every, citizen and taxpayer In . San
Francisco and particularly for the faithful dis
charge of his Important duty as guardian of
the finances of this city, a duty which he has
fulfilled with honor to thin great municipality,
with honor to the Republican party and with
pride and credit to himself and his numerous
friends and constituents. His conduct of that
office has been sufficient in- itself to commend
and endear him to every citizen by reason of
his superior ability in the discharge of his duty
and the strict and high Integrity of his char
acter.

in order, and Maurice L. Asher was rec

been cast for Henry J. Crocker, and his
nomination was made by acclamation.
There were loud shouts for Crocker, â¢ and
the chairman appointed Messrs. Castle
and Anthony to escort 'the distinguished
Republican to the platform. As Mr.
Crocker left his seat In the Forty-first
Assembly District he was accorded an
ovation. The cheering continued until he
was introduced by the chairman as the
next Mayor of San Francisco. When the
enthusiasm " had subsided Mr. Crocker
spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates and Friends
of" the Republican Party: I wish first to in
dorse the platform that you have all heard
read; I wish to thank you personally for the
preat honor thatyyou have conferred upon me;
and I wish to say that my best hopes are for
the fulfillment of your wishes that we shall
win at the next election and that the entire
Republican ticket shall be elected, which I sin
cerely believe will be the result.
I will not take up your time in sayinjf any
more now. I have been placed before you as a
business man, and I hope that I shall be able
to Drove that I am such it I am elected as
Mayor of this grand city.
At this time, when we are all looking for
ward to a great American city, one to which
all the people of the United States will turn
their eyes in the next ten years, let me, if I
can, fill for a brief time a position that will
help that city on Its onward course. If I can
Justify all the good things that have been said
about me by my friends and can stand off the
other half, which you have not. heard yet, but
which, will probably be given to you in Install
ments by th.e opposition (laughter and ap
plause) I dofi't think I shall have made any
mistake In 'having placed myself before the
voters of this city in an earnest and thorough
manner to uphold all that we pledge ourselves
to do.
Gentlemen of the convention, I thank you
sincerely again.

Macedonian Sympathizers Are Urg

SOFIA, Bulgaria. Sept. 23.â A less hope
ful feeling prevails to-day in Government
circles regarding the general situation,
although no actual change Is reported.
The events of the next two days are
awaited with great anxiety and popular
feeling Is becoming more excited. A
largely attended meeting of Macedonian
sympathizers held at Rustchuk, Bulgaria,
on September 22. adopted resolutions ap
pealing to the Bulgarian Government to
declare war on Turkey immediately.
In revolutionary circles war is believed
to be imminent unless Turks cease mas
sacreing the Christians. Dr. Christo
Tatarscheff, president of the Macedonian
organizations, says that the insurgent
committees attach no significance to the
reported negotiations between Turkey and
Bulgaria, because similar negotiations
were discussed 'In 1S97 and later In 1S9D and

KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Sept. 23.â After be
ing In session behind closed doors since
early this morning the convention of the
International Association of Bridge and
Structural Iron Workers at 10 o'clock to
night voted in favor of seating Samuel
Parks and the other delegates from local
union No. 2 of New York. There were
but three votes cast against Parks and
his friends. These were the ballots of
President Buchanan, the Kansas City del
egate and one other. The result was a
decided victory for Parks, as it reinstates
him and local No. 2 of New York, of
which he is the business agent, and fcli
rectly repudiates the action of President
Buchanan in suspending it. The Parks
delegations will now have seats on the
floor, and the supposedly regular New
York delegates are out of It.
Action of President Buchanan Is
Directly Repudiated.
DELEGATE PARKS SEATED.
Special significance attaches to the
Macedonian meeting at Rustchuk because
the resolutions adopted are the first open
expression of such an emphatic character
In favor of war coming from any popular
meeting in Bulgaria. Rustchuk is the
chief commercial town in the country.
Resolutions also were passed thanking the
Pope, the English Bishops, the Trades
Union Congress and the British and Amer
ican press for their expressions of sym
pathy with the Macedonian cause.
Fighting is reported to have taken place
near Kotshanl, on the frontier. In which
the Turks lost fifty men killed and the in
surgents suffered a loss of ten. A panic
prevails at Kotshani and all business and
work is at a standstill. Reports of other
minor encounters and more atrocities by
the Turks continue to come in.
Referring to the details of the proposed
arrangement, Dr. Tatarscheff said there
was no guarantee, even if the committee
was appointed, that It would ever be more
than ornamental. The present village
commissions in Macedonia have Bulgarian
members, but they are always favorable
to the Turks. The president of the Mace
donian organizations concluded by declar
ing that the insurgents would be satisfied
with nothing short of Intervention by the
powers.

FRESNO. Sept. 23.â Thomas H. "Prosper,
a United States mail messenger, was ar
rested here to-day by Deputy United
States Marshal Timmins, on a charge of
embezzling a package from the mail. The
charge was brought against him by
Deputy Postoflice Inspector T. J. Hare.
Trosper was taken before United State3
Court Commissioner Laning, to whom he
made a complete confession. The pack
age stolen by Trosper was of small value,
merely containing a shirt, but the theory
is held that he took it believing it con
tained something of greater value. The
theft was traced to him by the discovery
of the shirt in a bundle of his clothing at
a laundry. He was admitted to $1000 bail.
The crime Is punishable by Imprisonment
of not Ices than one nor more than five
years.
Package Containing- a Shirt Is Stolen
and the Theft Is Traced to

OAKLAND, Sept. 23.â The Inouest to
determine the cause of the death of Dr.
Edwin F. Dlmmick of Oakland, who was
found dead in the Contra Costa hills, was
begun at Martinez this morning at 11:30
o'clock by Coroner Curry. There were
present from Oakland Mrs. Dimmick,
mother of the deceased; Lillian Dimmick,
his sister; C. Dimmick. a brother, and
Mrs. Edwin Dimmick. the widojv of the
deceased, together with Edward Troy and
Frank Brltton. who were in tha company
of Dimmick on his trip to the hills.
The mother was the first witness. She
testified that she believed her son had
been foully dealt with, but had no knowl
edge of the fact. All she knew of the
circumstances was what she had read in
the papers and what she had been told.
She had reason, however, to believe, she
said, that her son's life was in danger,
because her son had told her that Stella
Walker, or Florence Welch, the woman
who now claims to be the Widow, had
once stabbed h!m and that her son stated
at that time that Stella "would get him
yet."
"It has been stated that my vson was
a habitual drunkard," said the mother.
"If so he could not have attended to busi
ness as he did. He was in his right mind
as far as I could see. If he was crazy it
was because of what they gave him in
camp. He was not addicted to opiates."
The case was continued until 1:30
o'clock.

f heet steel plants in the near future unless
the Amalgamated Association will con
sent to a recommendation under the same
pl&a as was agreed upon last fall. The
rrason for this attitude Is an overstocked

The Chronicle-Telegraph says It has

NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â All collieries of
the Lehlgh Valley Coal Company, the
â¢ â¢nrporatlon which owns all of the anthra
cite coal mines controlled by the Lehigh
Valley Railroad, will be closed on Satur
day and Monday of next week. This is
the first important closing of mines since
the end of the anthracite strike eleven
months ago and is significant as an indi
cation that the supply of coal has once
rr.ore reached a point commensurate with
the demand at tide water. Absolute dr
r.ial If made that there is over production
or that coal in any quantity is being
stored by any of the companies that pre
dominate the New York market. The de
mand in the West remains somewhat in
f\rcÂ« of the supply and the only market
Â¦where coal in quantity is being stored is
Philadelphia, which is supplied by the
Reading. With the exception of the Le

Turco-Bulgarian Relations Becoming
More Strained.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 23.-The re
lations between Turkey and Bulgaria are
daily becoming more strained. Rumors
are current of a crisis at Ylldiz Kiosk
and that the Grand Viziership haa been
offered to Said Pasha, who was uncere
moniously dismissed .last year, but that
he declines to again take the office un
less he Is authorized to declare war oh
Bulgaria, which the Sultan hesitates
to do.
As one of the results of the numerous
Cabinet councils at the Ylldiz Kiosk the
transfer of thirty-two battalions from
Monastlr to Adrianople has Decn ordered
and 200 young officers have gone to Sa
lonica and Adrianople to complete the
commissions in the army in Roumelia.
These movements are regarded as war
preparations against an expected attack.
The military commission is practically
in permanent session.

A committee of Northern Pacific fire
men and engineers is also in the city
awaiting a conference with the officials
of that road. It is not known what con
cessions they ask.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Sept 23.â The con
troversy between the engineers and fire
men and the Great Northern Railroad
was amloably settled to-night. Neither
the company officials nor the grand offi
cers of tho two brotherhoods would state-
Just what tho terms of agreement were,
but It is known that each side made some
concessions. Tho firemen are understood
to have been granted a slight increase in
wages bringing their schodulo to a parity
with, thoao of the various other transcon
tinental Hues. No Increase la believed to
have bean granted tha enslnemen, but nu
merous minor changes were made in the
working rules.
Tha controversy, which at one time
threatened to take- on a most serious
character, was brought to an end by a
series of conferences which began yester
day and ended to-night. The grievance
committee of tho two brotherhoods had
been In St. Paul in conference with the
ofllclals for more than a month. It is
paid that nearly every concession asked
for by the committeo was at one time
granted by the general officers and a ten
tative agreement was reached which was
then referred to President Hill. Hill then
referred the subject back to the general
officers and they at once withdrew their
consent to the concessions previously
granted. This greatly -incensed the men
and it looked for a time aa though a poll
of the local unions would be taken as to
whether or not there should be a strike.
Grand Chief W.F. Stone of tho Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers and Grand
Chief Hanahan of the Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Firemen were summoned to St.
Paul to take charge of the negotiations.
Another conference was asked of the
company officials and was granted. After
this conference Stone said that the com
pany showed a disposition to meet the
men in a spirit of fairness and that a
peaceful settlement was probable. The
conference was continued throughout the
day and to-night an agreement was sign
ed by the company officials and the com
mittee representing the men.
Miss Elsie Winkler, 16 years old, who
lives with her parents at 208 East 106th
street, haa been subject to epileptic at
tacks sometimes as often as twice a day
ever since she was ten years old. At that
time she had a severe attack of diph
theria. Her right arm became partly
paralyzed and epilepsy soon developed.
Until she began to receive the X-ray
treatment, bromides and other remedies
failed to relieve her. The bromides upset
her system to such an extent that her
face became covered by an eruption and
her general health was rapidly failing.
Since the application of the X-ray three
times a week she has gradually regained
her health and the epileptic attacks come
now at intervals as great aa sixteen and
seventeen days and are less severe. Her
complexion has cleared and she has
gained considerably in weight.
When she began taking the treatment it
was difficult for her to enunciate, while
now she speaks slowly, put distinctly.
NEW * YORK, Sept. 23.â For the first
time in this country and probably In the
world, epilepsy, heretofore . considered an
Incurable disease, is being successfully
treated by the application of the X-ray.
At the Post Graduate Hospital, In thÂ»
electro therapeutic department, Dr. J. H.
Branth of West Eighty-Seventh Btreet
haa had an epileptic patient under treat
ment for several months. While too con
servative to declare the X-ray treatment
to afford a certain cure until ha haa had
the patient a longer time under his ob
servation, he is at least convinced that it
Is by far the most ouccessful treatment
yet attempted.

A great light has descended upon the Federal offi
cials who in this city are striving to bring to bar the
men that are cheating the Chinese exclusion law and
reaping a harvest of ill-gotten gold. Uncle Sam's
officers are firmly convinced- that the frauds against
the Government are the work of a formidable and
cleverly organized ring. These astute investigators
seem to be on the trail and we must wait with su
pended breath. Even a laugh would destroy the
spell.
DEMOCRATIC seekers after a Presidential
candidate, in sweeping their dragnets over the
bottom of the deep sea of bygone politics,
have again brought Richard Olney to the surface,
and once more his availability is being discussed with
as much vigor as if it were a live issue. His reappear
ance comes to some extent opportunely, for the Gor
man boom has faded away, the Parker movement
has curled up in a sleep that seems like death, and
the reorganizes feel they must have ; somebody in
sight to look to for relief when Tom Johnson or any
other Bryanite swaggers through the camp.
The revival of the discus.sion of Olney's chances is
the more interesting by reason of certain new argu
ments advanced to prove his availability. Some of
these are worth stating. A Boston authority gives
three reasons why he should be nominated, summar
izing them in this way: "i! Western Democrats
know that success is impossible without a candidate
acceptable to the East. They would support Olney
because he is one of the few prominent Eastern Dem
ocrats who did not repudiate Bryan. 2. Standing for
'law and order,' Mr. Olney would have a good
chance of carrying the great doubtful States, New
York, Ohio and Illinois. 3. Mr. Olney would serve
the 'high finance' as a 'vengeance' candidate with
whom to defeat Roosevelt. 'Anything to beat Roose
velt,' comments the Wall-street Journal, 'is'the motto
of that section of Wall street which has most bitterly
NEW PLEA FOR OLNEY.
Turkey, it is said by experts, can whip Bulgaria
and force her to an understanding of international
courtesies, but if she does the powers of Europe
will not permit her to enjoy the fruits of her victory.
It seems up to Bulgaria, therefore, to lose a few
thousand citizens, who would not be missed, and
give the world an occasional thrill of horror in ex
aggerated reports of the atrocities of war waged in
the cause of Christianity.
WASHINGTON dispatches announce that
the State Department deems the Panama
canal treaty dead by reason of the failure
of the Colombian Government to take favorable ac
tion upon it within the time agreed upon. The
whole issue is therefore reopened. Under the
Spooner act President Roosevelt can now take up
the Nicaragua route, or he can permit the matter to
rest for a time in the hope of finding some way of
reaching an agreement with the Colombians.
The situation is a favorable one for the display of
statecraft and diplomatic skill. The people of the
United States are eagerly awaiting the construction
of the canal. They have watched with an increasing
impatience the incessant recurrence of difficulties in
the way of the enterprise. It was fondly believed
.vhen the Panama treaty was ratified by the Senate
that the last obstacle had been removed and the
great work would soon be under way. That hope
has been disappointed. The opponents of the move
ment have found a means for baffling the national
will, and once more the whole project is in danger
of being subjected to a new controversy among the
advocates of rival routes.
Fortunately we ha\*e a President who can be re
lied on to act with promptness and a Secretary of
State who has proven himself one of the ablest
Ministers of Foreign Affairs now living. It is
therefore reasonable to expect they will take up the
issue at once and set in motion negotiations which
will lead to a satisfactory treaty with cither Colom
bia or Nicaragua. The great mass of the Ameri
can people are indifferent as to which of the two
routes be chosen, for after all the choice is one of
comparison only. Each of the two is in some re
spects superior to the other. A canal by either would
most decidedly be better than none. The country
expects the President to act under the authority
given him, so that the issue may not once more go to
Congress and be made the subject of useless and
tedious debates. The people know the President has
.a right to act, and they expect him to act right.
UNCLE SAM-A. S., City. The term
"Uncle Sam," as applied to America,
arose at the time of the last war between
England and America. At Troy, on the
Hudson, Elbert Anderson, a contractor
for the American army, had a storeyard.
At- that place there was an inspector
named Samuel Wilson, who was usually
called "Uncle Sam," whose duty it was to
superintend the examination of the pro
visions and when such were passed each
cask or package was marked E. A.â u. 3.,
the initials of the contractor and the
United States. The man whose duty it
was to mark the casks and packages was
a facetious fellow and when asked what
the letters meant replied that they stood
for Elbert Anderson and Uncle Sam. The
joke was soon circulated, became widely
known and was heartily entered into by
"Uncle Sam" himself. Before that war
was over it got into print, waa published
in every paper and then by common con
sent everything that bore the initials of
the United States was said to be the prop
erty of "Uncle Sam." Mr. Wilson, the
original Uncle Sam, died In Troy August,
1854, at the age of 84 and the facts above
given are from an article published at
that time in the Albany Argus.

FRATERNAL ASSOCIATIONâ A. S..
Hemet, Cal. When an individual joins a
fraternal beneficiary association he takes
an obligation to abide by the laws of the
supreme, grand and subordinate bodies
and he is bound to obey such laws. There
is no law that will induce the association
to pay back the amount paid in as assess
ments for protection, for that is the same
as premium paid for insurance in any as
sociation. During the time for which the
premium Is paid the association agrees to
pay in case of loss, and when the pre
mium has lapsed then the obligation of
the association ceases.

NEMOâ A Constant Reader. Occidental,
Cal. It is probable that the man Sharp,

his condition was similar to that of Nemo,
a character in Dickens' "Bleak House."
Nemo was the name by which Captain

are plentiful, but diamonds have never

INDIAN ON LANDâ F. M.. Orleans.
Cal. If you have reason to believe that
an Indian is unlawfully occupying min
eral land in your vicinity you should lay
the matter before the United States Land
Office at Eureka, Humboldt County. The
question asked calls for a legal opinion,
one of the class that this department does
not answer.
THE Examiner urges the people to vote for the
Geary-street bonds, and gives as a reason that
if the road is reconstructed by the city the
Board of Public Works will reconstruct it with the
new improved grooved rail, such as is now being
laid on Third street, and which, it also alleges, is
used in Washington.
This would be a very good argument if it were
true, but the fact is that the plans and specifications,
as prepared by the City Engineer, and upon which
his estimate of $710,000 is based, do not call for this
rail, except from the corner of Fifth and Point Lobos
avenues out Point Lobos to Tenth avenue and out
Tenth avenue to the park, where there is now no
railroad and where there must consequently be an
entirely new construction.
But it is not true as to the present road. The rail
provided by the City Engineer for this road from the
corner of Kearny and Market streets out to Fifth and
Point Lobos avenues is the rail now used by the
Geary-street road. If the city were to tear up this
rail and put down the above mentioned new rail the
estimates would have to be increased from $70,000 to
$75,000, and'the bond issue of $710,000 would there
fore fall short of the entire cost by about $75,000.
The Examiner further states that in the city con
struction the streets between the tracks would be
paved with the saine material as is laid in the rest
of the street, while the present Geary-street road is
not so paved. An examination of this road shows
that the space between the tracks for thirty-seven
blocks is paved with the same material as the rest
of the street, while for nine blocks where the street
is paved with bituminous rock the space between the
tracks is paved with basalt blocks well laid in
cement. f -J

RAILROADS-Subscriner City. The

senger cars. 27,144; mail cars, 8667; freight

The seeming inconsistency in the conduct of the
Government at St. Petersburg is due solely to the
fact that the Russian policy has been judged in the
past mainly by words and not by deeds. Announ
cing herself as the champion of Christianity, she has
sought to overthrow the Turk and establish herself
in Constantinople. In times past it was possible to
advance her imperial interests while championing
Christianity, and consequently it was easy to speak
the "large, divine and comfortable" words that
arouse enthusiasm in the Christian masses of Amer
ica and of Western Europe. At present it is no lon
ger possible to do so. Two Christian powers, at
present weak but very ambitious, are seeking to ob
tain the empire of the Turk; Bulgaria is fighting
for it in the north and Greece is intriguing for it
in the south. Should either Bulgaria or Greece win
the prize Russia will see her long cherished desire
for Constantinople baffled and beaten. Therefore it
is that she no longer champions the Christians. She
is for the Turk, and will uphold him until the time
when she can seize upon his kingdom in defiance of
both Greece and Bulgaria.
There are some other considerations that doubt
less have their share in holding the Russian Govern
ment back from giving aid to the insurgents of the
Turkish empire. Among them is the revolt at this
very time of a number of Armenian subjects of Rus
siaÂ« It would not be impossible for a Russian states
man to give orders for the slaughter of Armenians in
Russia while at the same time sending a formal
high-sounding protest to the Sultan against the
slaughter of Bulgarians in Turkey, but the world
would laugh. The publicity of our time has put an
end to that free and easy way of regulating domes
tic politics on one principle while asserting the op
posite in foreign affairs. Russia is, in fact, doing
very much what the Turk is doing, though on Â¦ a
smaller scale, and therefore finds sentimental as well
as political reasons for upholding the Turk and bid
ding Bulgaria keep the peace.
While the Armenian movement in Russia is by
no means so formidable as that going on among the
Christians of Macedonia, it is none the less quite
a portentous uprising, and disturbs the empire much
more than those massacres of Jews with which civ
ilization has been ringing. It appears, in fact, that
the Armenians may yet undertake to fight, and if
so it is predicted by those familiar with the country
and the people the revolt will spread from province
to province and affect many millions of people.
The trouble between Russia and her Armenian
subjects, like that between the Sultan and the Mace
donians, is largely one of religion. The Russian
Government has been trying to force all Armenians
into the orthodox church, and to that end has seized
most of the Armenian church property. The results
have been already serious and may become more so
at any time. The situation is so grave the Russian
Government has every reason to desire an early set
tlement of the 'troubles in the Balkans at whatever
cost. For once the Czar and the Sultan have a
mutual interest. Christianity and liberty must wait.
HARDLY any feature of the relations of the
great powers of Europe to the anarchy that
prevails in the Balkans is more interesting
than the attitude which Russia has taken as a friend
of the Turk and an opponent of the plans and as
pirations of the Christians of Macedonia and Bul
garia. For many a year the Russians posed before
the world as champions of oppressed Christianity.
Ardent and zealous souls in this country have prayed
earnestly for Russia's success in every battle be
tween that power and the Turk. Sanguine hearts
have cherished a hope that within a few years Rus
sia would drive the Turk out of Europe altogether
and .give peace and freedom to the suffering inno
cents of Macedonia. To those earnest souls and
sanguine hearts there must be something almost
horrifying in the reports that now come from Eu
rope, announcing with emphatic reiteration that the
Russian Government has warned Bulgaria not to in
terfere in Macedonia, but to leave the Sultan a free
hand in the suppression of the "insurrection," no
matter how much of slaughter the suppression may
require.

THE BANCROFT FIREâ A. M., City.
The fire which destroyed the Bancroft
building on Market street occurred on the
afternon of April 30, 18S6.
Assessor Dodge Is of the opinion that
the difficulty could have been avoided by
figuring the State rate on the increased
valuation and the city's rate of $1.07G on
the valuation as returned by him and
upon which the city's rate was based.
The sum of $600,000 was collected on
such property during March, April, May
and June by the Assessor, who was com
pelled to figure the taxes on the old rate
of $1,608, fixed in 1902. These collections
represented In a large number of In-
Btances taxes on the household furniture
of small holders. These will be compelled
to pay an additional sum to the city of
approximately 12% per cent in excess of
what they have already paid.
When Assessor Dodge was asked what
the effect would be in figuring the new
rate fixed by the Supervisors on the in
creased valuation as returned by the
Board of Equalization, that official said
It would result in additional taxes being
collected from personal property holders
who have already paid their taxes under
the old rate.
"Without desiring to criticize the action
of city officials in reducing the city's tax
rate to 84. 4 cents in order to figure the
rate on one valuation as increased by
the State Board of Equalization," said
Assessor Dodge yesterday, "it appears to
me that the very thing which it wa3 de
sired to avoid, namely the collection of
more taxes than contemplated by the
municipal budget, will be foisted on the
small property holders who have already
paid under the old rate.
"To illustrate, we will suppose that a
business man has been assessed for $10,
000 on which he has paid under the old
rate of $1,608 the sum of $160 SO in taxes
to the city. Under the raise of the Board
of Equalization, the Auditor will in
crease his assessment to $13,000. At the
new rate of $1,405 (84.4 cents for the city
and 56.1 cents for State purposes), fie
will be charged with $182 65 on the assess
ment roll. Since he has paid $160 80, there
will be due to the city under the new
rate the sum of $21 S5. This represents
approximately an Increase of 12*Â£ per
cent, which the personal property holder
will be called upon to pay the city.
"As the collections of this kind amounted
to some J600.000. it is plain that the city
will collect $75,000 more of such taxes.
This will necessitate the making out of
extra bills by the Tax Collector and the
sending of notifications to the property
owners, all of which will add to the ex
pense of the collections."
The amount of increase exacted from
small property holders will be In a man
ner offset by the fact that the banks and
other holders of money and solvent cred
its and mortgages will have to pay some
$75,000 less, owing to the reduction in the
city tax rate to 84.4 cents. The assess
ment of $33,000,000 in the properties named
was not increased by the State Board of
Equalization according to the Political
Code. The reduced rate really should not
apply to the property described, but the
old rate -of $1.07t> should be applied to val
uations not raised by the Board of Equal
ization.
The raising by 30 per cent of the val
uation of this city's assessment by ths
State Board of Equalization and the con
sequent reduction In the city's tax rate by
the Board of Supervisors to 84.4 cents per
$100 will result in the collection of ad
ditional taxes, aggregating some 575,000
from owners of personal property un
secured bv real estate.
The Board of Public "Works took under
advisement the plans of the city architect
for the addition to the Almshdu$e Chapel
to cost $4600. The appropriation for the
purpose, however. Is only $4000.
The board recommended to the Super
visors the passage of an ordinance mak
ing it unlawful for any person to deposit

city on any sidewalk for the purpose cf

that the sidewalk cans are being used

It is very well known that the action of the Presi
dent in bringing about an arbitration of the issues
involved in the coal strike won the favor of the great
mass of the American people, including labor, capi
tal and middlemen alike. Holding the strong posi
tion he does in his own party, his nomination is vir
tually assured in advance of the Republican con
vention, and with a harmonious people behind him
his election would be a foregone conclusion. Two
sets of men, however, have been gravely offended by
the President's course â the yellow journalists dislike
him because his action deprived them of a chance to
precipitate a struggle of labor against capital, out of
which the yellow editors would have gained both
money and notoriety, while the more reckless of the
Wall-street magnates are aggrieved because he
baffled their schemes for establishing a monopoly in
some of the great articles of public necessity.
Out of the situation there has developed the cu
rious fact that the organs of the unscrupulous trusts
and the organs of the yellow agitators are in full
cry against the President. We have then a combi
nation of the demagogues who denounce capital
with the stock gamblers who denounce labor.
Making faces at one another and hurling denuncia
tions against one another in public, they are working
cunningly together in secret to defeat the President
and thus make way for a period of strife out of
which both the gamblers and the yellows hope to
make profit.
A part of the working of the scheme has been dis
closed by the efforts to make campaign capital out
of the reinstatement by the President of Foreman
Miller in the Government Printing Office. The
magnates of Wall street who would not dare to at
tack the President openly have found in this case
a good opportunity to make the attack while posing
as the friends of labor unions.
A recent report from Washington concerning the
developments of the case in that city says: "It is as
serted that influences which cannot be questioned as
to their purposes and which relate to Wall street
and other financial centers are endeavoring to pre
cipitate a fight by labor organizations on the Presi
dent, and that they are operating in conjunction with
prominent Democrats here. The plan is said to be
to have Democrats make a fight on Mr. Roosevelt in
the Miller case in order to embroil organized labor
against him. This is to be done by placing prejudi
cial facts in the -Miller case before labor organiza
tions, to create a resentment at what they will under
take to show has been unfriendly action by the Presi
dent toward the principles of organized labor. Those
who huve become satisfied that this plan really is in
progress have asked why it should be necessary to
begin such work so far ahead of the events it' is
hoped to influence. The reply has been that Wall
street Republicans and other financial influences
which have sought to injure the President's pros
pects for the nomination realize that they cannot be
gin too soon."
This is the way the game goes. Wall street is
willing to ally itself with yellow journalism for the
sake of beating Roosevelt, and yellow journalism is
willing to ally itself with Wall street for the same
purpose. Organized labor is to be made the catspaw
for the allied apes, provided always that it can be
duped into consenting to play that role. It is a case
of Blifil and Black George outdone. Fortunately it
is too clumsy a trick to succeed. The American peo
ple are not going to be misled by any such manifest
political bunko as that.
JOHN RANDOLPH of Roanoke once shocked
the country and brought a duel down upon his
head by declaring the appointment of Henry
Ciay to the office of Secretary of State by John
Quincy Adams to be "a union of the Puritan with the
blackleg, a combination of Blifil and Black George."
In the days when everybody was familiar with the
personages referred to the charge was looked upon
as an aspersion that could be refuted only by pistols,
and accordingly Clay called upon Randolph to come
out and be shot at. Since that time there has been
many a worse combination than that of the good
New Englander with the genial Kentuckian. We
have in fact become accustomed to queer alliances of
that kind and have adopted it as a proverb that pol
itics, like poverty, makes strange bedfellows. In the
whole extent of our history, however, there has been
no such alliance as that which is now reported to
have been formed between the yellow journals of
New York and the stock gamblers of Wall street to
beat R*oosevelt.
The scheme as outlined is an ingenious one, and
unless the public be put on guard against it is likely
to prove dangerous. It consists of a plot to excite
the workingmen of the country against the President
to such a degree that the Wall-street combine, act
ing in collusion with the yellow journalists, can
swing the labor unions against him in the coming
Presidential campaign.

It may be that the captains of finance would like
to beat Mr. Roosevelt and that Mr. Olney would
serve them as a candidate as well as any other Dem
ocrat, but if it be so they will have to keep the
vengeance programme as dark as Egypt, for even
the casual suggestion of it is enough to endanger
whatever chances the Massachusetts leader may have
of getting a nomination.
The third reason is unique in American politics.
Never, before has a candidate been recommended for
the Presidency on the ground that he will be a
"vengeance candidate," serving to work out the re
venge of certain interests that believe they have been
injured. The plea is of course unjust to Mr. 01
ney, and it does not accord with the second reason
given for his nomination â that he stands for law and
order â for if he have a true regard for law and or
der he would enforce the law against corporations
that violate it just as strictly as against any one else.

The Only Thing That
Interests Everybody
DID you ever stop to realize what it is in life that really interests
you the most â outside of eating, sleeping and being merry, of
course? Is it the mock heroics, the polished gentility of a dead
and gone age, or isn't it life itselfâ tense, eager, pulsating lifeâ the very
things that the other fellow does that you do yourself? Just take note
of the following:
"The job of front-end brake man on a mountain division is no great
stake for a man ordinarily, but it was one for me just then. We knew
when we went into the superintendent's office that somebody was to get
fired; the only question whoâ the train crew or the operator? Our
engine crew were out of it; it was up to the conductor and to me. Had
the operator displayed red signals? The. conductor said no, I said no,
the operator said yes. but he lied. We couldn't prove it: we could only
put our word against his: and, what made it the worse for me. my con- ,
ductor was something of a liar himself.
"I stood beading in a cold sweat, for I could see with half an eye
it was going against us. The superintendent, an up and up railroad man
every inch and all business, but suspicious, was leaning the operator's
way the strongest kind.
"There wasn't another soul in the little room as the three of us
stood before the superintendent's desk."
There's a situation which at first blush might seem ordinary enouzh
butâ is it? Perhaps you've been in the same fix yourself. It is not new'
but it always will be to the man who has the experience for the first
time, and oh. what awful possibilities it portends. It is a situation that
every man who works constantly stands in awe of. Can you cu C33 how
it came out? No But you want to know. Of course you want to
know. That is the curiosityâ sympathyâ or what you will that makes
the hves of those about us-the real- flesh and blood men and wornâ¢ we
all know-the most absorbing subject imaginable. You may deny this*
if you will, but there is not the shadow of a doubt that yov. will look
first for Frank . H. Spearman's thrilling two-page narrative of 'The

PERSONAL MENTION.
Peace Disturbs the Peace.
Thomas Peace, an Ironworker living on
Twenty-third street, between Diamond
and Douglass, appeared before Police
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge of
disturbing the peace. It is alleged that
he went home under the Influence of
liquor on Tuesday night and drove his
wife' and children out of the house, rais
ing a disturbance that alarmed the neigh
borhood. The Judge was informed that
Peace was in the habit of driving his
wife and children out of the house and
compelling them to sleep all night on
the step?. Peace was ordered into cus
tody and the case continued for a week,
as his wife was unable to be in court.
The Judge increased his bonds to $500.
W. H. Metson is equally positive that
Duffy gave the deed in consideration of
$20,000. Metson was a witness yesterday
and during the course of his testimony
he said that he was the one who paid
Duffy the money In August, 1901, and re
ceived from him a deed giving his in
terest to Lindeberg. Further evidence in
the case will be heard to-dav.
Thomas Duffy, who is suing Jafet
Lindeberg for a share of $900,000 taken
from Alaskan mining claims, is positive
that he never signed any deed transfer
ring to the defendant his interest in the
claims. He so testified yesterday during
the trial of the suit In Judge Graham's
court.

He Did.

ter of Mr. and Mrs. George H.
Robertson of Honolulu, and James Dona
hue Dougherty, son of Mrs. Joseph
Spear, wife of the well known
Collector of the Port of San Francisco.
A double ceremony united the young peo
ple, both Catholic and Episcopal rituals
binding them hard and fast.
The young groom is well known on this
side of the Pacific, having been in the
customs service before his departure for
the coral isles three years ago. He is
a cousin of the Martinsâ Peter and Wal
terâtheir father and Mrs. Spear's father
having been brothers: likewise he is re
lated to the Donahues paternally. A young
man of fine character and social attain
ments, he was cordially received by the
smart set in the islands, and his winning
the hand of one of the fairest maids on
the Isle of Palms has brought forth an
avalanche of congratulations from friends
and kindred here.
The bride, a petite maid with midnight
eyes and alluring: mien, was born and
reared in her island home, having, how
ever, strayed from Its beckoning palms
to pursue a cultural course in Boston.
Possessed of a dulcet voice that is in
perfect harmony with her personality, she
has devoted much time to Its cultivation.
The wedding took place at Panahoe, the
palatial home of the bride, in the pres
ence of nearly 1000 guestsâ that number
of invitations having been issued, and it
is a safe conjecture that but few regrets
to so splendid an affair were sent.

The San Jose and Los Gatos Interurban
Railway also has its eye on Campbell,
and a lively fight over the franchise will
result. The company has a line from
this city to Saratoga and Los Gatos about
completed and "it has figured 'all along
on running another line from Los Gatos
direct to San Jose. â¢*
The San Jose Railway Company, which
owns the First-street line and other
branches, is said to be preparing an ap
plication for a franchise for an electric
road from this city to Campbell and will
file It with the Supervisors at the next
meeting. It proposes to extend its branch
from the end of Willow street at Lincoln
avenue on out to Campbell. The pro
posed line will run through a thickly set
tled community. The German Savings
Bank of San Francisco is the owner of
the First-street road and the proposed
extension.
Two Electric Railways Are Anxious
to Enter That Thriving Little
Town.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 23.â There promises to
be a race between the San Jose Electric
Railway and the San Jose and Los Gatos
Interurban Railway to see which can
reach Campbell first. That thriving town,
six miles southwest of this city, has been
wanting an electric road for some time
and now it has the promise of becoming
the coal of two lines. The citizens of
the place are also preparing to Incorpor

The ball given at the Presfbio Club by
the Seventh Infantry Tuesday night was
an altogether charming affair. What with
rhythmic music, flags and flowers, brave
soldiers and fair women, the hours sped
by all too quickly. And the Seventh is
to fold its tents and steal away! That
the gallant defenders of the flag wlIT
be sadly missed Is a certaintyâ more by
some perhaps than by others. Their last
function will be remembered pleasantly
by all who were present.
The gown of the fair bride was of hand
made lace over chiffon, low at the throat,
as becomes the women of tropic climes.
The maid was attired In point d'esprit â
white, of course, as foil to her radiant
beauty. Flower girls, bearing flowers so
dear to tho Hawaiian heart, paved their
pathway.
The plans for the affair from the stand
point of magnificence have perhaps never
been surpassed in the islands, and from
the all important viewpoint of suitability
and fitness the union is Indeed ideal.
By an unfortunate series of events Mr.
and Mrs. Spear were, at the very mo
ment of sailing, prevented from taking
part in the delightful function, Mrs. Spear
having had many beautiful gowns made
for the affair and subsequent ones. How
ever, she confidently hopes to join the
young people at a very early date. Last
night many congratulations sped under
the water to the happy young couple.
forests of palms, pomegranates and daz
zling blooms, are at all times as fair a
spot as mortal knows, but what of their
magnificence illumined last night with
thousands of gleaming 'bulbs rivaling the
stars that scintillated overhead. It was
in this garden that the reception was
held.

result of an accident in which Magee, au
automobile, the plaintiff and a street car
took prominent parts. It occurred June
30 last on Sutter street, between Hyde
and Leavenworth. According to the
complaint the accident was due to
the high rate of speed at which Magee
was driving his machine. The plaintiff
| says that while she was a passenger on
an east-bound Sutter street car June 39,
Magee endeavored to pass the car in
his automobile. He was going consider
ably faster than the twelve miles an hour
allowed by law she says, and the result
was that the machine swerved and
smashed into that part of the car where
she sat. She says that because of the

The sum of $20 per month was allowed
to E. S. Tucker for the rental of a lot

The board retired Miss B. A. Shaw and
Miss Jean Parker from active service in
the public schools. They were granted an
annuity under the law for thirty years'
service as teachers.
The petition of the Wilmerding and Lick
District Improvement Club that the board
erect a schoolhouse on the city's lot sit
uated between Kansas, Vermont,
Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets was
taken under advisement. The petitioners
complain that the Buena Vista School Is
too far away for the smaller pupils and
that the school is too .close to a Chinese
residence.
Leaves of absence were granted to
Edith M. Boyle and Marie Van Bucfi
holtz. *
The board ordered the erection of five
portable echoolhouses for the Bergerot,
Sunnyside, Sheridan and Sutro schools,
giving additional accommodations for
seven classrooms.
Langdon further staled that Miss
Dwyer stood on her legal rights and re
fused to make a statement, beyond de
nying that she had whipped the boy in
the manner stated, because the charge
was made by Thomas Kelly, uncle of the
boy, who is not his legal guardian. Under
the circumstances Langdon said hÂ«? was
compelled to bring the matter to the
board's attention so that Miss Dwyer may
be accorded a hearing, und he will file
a written report on the subject at next
Wednesday's meeting.
Superintendent of Schools Langdon yes
terday notified the Board of Education
that he will file formal charges against
Miss Jean A. Dwyer, acting principal of
the South End School, alleging that she
severely whipped a pupil named Frank
Duignan. Langdon stated that his
deputies, Suzzalo and Heaton. had ex
amined several pupils who witnessed the
alleged punishing of Duigr.an and they
all testined that Miss Dwyer had admin
istered the whipping on the lower portion
of the boy's limbs with a rattan, which
ho considers unnecessarily severe.
Sheriff Lackmann called at the Apprais
er's building yesterday morning and held
a half hour's conference with United

Woodworth and United States Marshal
John H. Shine. All declined to make any
statement other than that there was no
news.
Like a true sleuth United States
Secret Service Agent William J. Bums
did not emerge from cover yesterday
and failed to put in an appearance
in the Federal building. He la evi
dently on the trail of other per
sons suspected of complicity in the Chi
nese substitution cases that have been
golns on in this city during the last six
years. Notwithstanding the fact that ru
mors of substitution have been reported
from time to time by the newspapers and
that a man named Duffy was sentenced
a year ago to the penitentiary for sub
stituting a habeas corpus Chinese between
the Mail dock and the Appraiser's build
ing, neither the Chinese Bureau here nor
at Washington lifted a finger to close up
this knothole through which Chinese la
borers have been leaking into the coun
try. It was only the great scandal pro
voked by the confession of Deputy United
States Marshal Gamble that aroused the
Washington authorities to action and then
it was the Department of Justice and the
Secret Service that took a hand In the
matter. It ia believed now that a means
of identification will be adopted by the
Bureau of Commerce and Labor to ren
der such frauds Impossible in the future.
Mr. Burns was not the only Important
character in the case who was missing
yesterday. It was observed that United
States Secret Service Agents George W.
Ha7en and Harry Moffltt were also ab
sent on the still hunt. The fact that the
deputies of the Sheriff. Dasha, Burnett
and Dempsey. were on the night watch at
the county jail only two weeks at a time
explains why other Jailers have been
placed under surveillance, for it Is sus
pected that the three named and Gamble
were not the only white persons con
cerned in the conspiracy.
Georglana O'Xeal, who keeps a small
hotel at 214 Mississippi street, wants a
divorce from Porter O'Neal because, she
says, he treats her in a brutal manner.
She says he calls her vile names and fre
quently accuses her of being too friendly
with J. Richardson. O'Neal has been re
strained from bothering his wife pending
the suit. The O'Neals came here from
Point Arena, where they were married in
January, 18S2.
Margaret Ravens is suing Arthur
Ravens for divorce for neglect. They
were married at Oakland in September,
1901. Mrs. Ravens charges that though
her husband earns $95 a month he compels
her to depend upon relatives and friends

alimony.
Divorces for desertion were granted to
Esther Donaire from Henry Donalre,
Walter J. Hastings from Agnes Clara
Hastings,* Caroline B. Mason from Beau,
ford A. Mason and Laura Effle Morrell
from \V. S. Morrell. Cruelty was the

asks for the custody of her two children
and $100 a month alimony out of the in
come of $250 a month she says Creagh
enjoys from his practice. Mrs. Creagh re
cites only one instance of her husband's
cruelty as a reason for divorce. This oc
curred on the 18th inst.. she alleges. She
says that on that date he slapped her
face, thereby causing her to suffer great
humiliation and mental anguish. The den
tist and his wife were married April 20>,

If you see a woman or a man with lux-

In nearly every case where women and
men have -thin, brittle hair they owe it
to dandruff. There are hundreds of prep-
arations that "claim", to cure dandruff,
but not one but Newbro's Herpicide tells
you that dandruff ia the result of a germ
burrowing Into the scalp, and that per-
manent rure of dandruff and its conse-
quent falling and baldness can only be
had by killing the germ; and there is no
other preparation that will destroy that
germ but Newbro's Herpicide. "Destroy

NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â Prince
Alert, the pacing hero of a hun
dred races and the champion of
a score of half-mile tracks, went
against the world's pacing record
of 1:59, held by Dan Patch, and beat it
most decisively to-day at the Empire City
track. It was the first day of the autumn
meeting of the Empire City Trotting
Club, and in addition to a strong card of
four races Prince Alert was billed for
what looked like the impossible feat of
beating the record. Prince Alert had re
cently won the half-mile track champion
ship in 2:031/4. which had been won only
the week before by Dan Patch in 2:04, and
good judges jvere sanguine of his success.
The weather and the track were perfect,
and the wind, which was high early in
the day, subsided, so that the conditions
were favorable. Mart Demarest, the train
er and driver of the Prince, on account of
overweight decided to get John Curry to
drive, and Demarest drove the thorough
bred pacemaker with the wind shield
sulky. At the third time the starter gave
the word, and pacing like a perfect piece
of machinery Prince Alert shot away to
the quarter pole in 29V6 seconds. As he
reached the backstretch he increased his
speed, and was at the half in 58 seconds.
Then the crowd realized that they were
witnessing the fastest mile of the century,
and cheers and shouts of "Come on!"
came from the spectators In the grand
stand and on the lawn. Without a break
he Hashed by the three-quarter pole In
I:26i4, and without any urging came on
with a superb burst of speed, crossing the
wire in 1:57. Summary:
PRINCE ALERT, 1:57, THE
LATEST SENSATION IN THE
HARNESS WORLD.
It was especially desired that the peo
ple of the State' be notified that all sub
scriptions to the fund be received by the
International Banking Corporation of this
city and receipts forwarded for the same
by that company.
Plans for the active campaign in behalf
of the movement were then inaugurated.
It was . first decided that a committee
from each of the following yacht clubs
be appointed by their respective commo
dores to receive contributions from their
members: San Francisco Yacht Club.
Corinthian, California, Encinal, Soutti
Bay. Vallejo, Los Angeles, San Diego.
Seattle, Portland and University Boat
Club. From among prominent yachting
men about the bay Colonel Beck then ap
pointed members to receive subscriptions
from the various shipping, mercantile and
corporation interests in San Francisco.
All the delegates present were constituted
into an executive committee to personally
superintend the work of collection.
COMMITTEES APPOINTED.
...PROMINENT MEN AITX
In explaining the objects of the meeting
Colonel Beck said:
"A few days ago the International
Banking Corporation, of which I am the
manager, received a communication from
New York asking that we of San Fran
cisco and of the coast generally assist in
the subscription toward the magnificent
silver service which is to be presented to
Sir Thomas Lipton as a testimonial to the
esteem with which the true sportsmen of
America regard his manful and sports
manlike efforts to win the America's cup.
Although this is intended to be primarily
a gift from the lovers of aquatic sports,
there are many who have a strong ad
miration for the gallant sportsman and
desire to enroll their names â¢ among the
list of donors. That our city and the Pa
cific Coast may be represented Is the pur
pose of the movement which will be set
on. foot to-night."
Colonel Beck then read letters from
John D. Spreckels and "William Greer
Harrison voicing their enthusiasm in the
movement. He further said he had re
colvfd personal assurances from other
prominent business men of the city that
they would respond handsomely to the in
vitation for subscriptions.
Acting on the call of Colonel F. E. Beck
of the International Banking Corporation
the following enthusiasts of yachting and
allied aquatic sports, representing clubs
about the bay. assembled last night:
Commodore R. S. Bridgman, San Fran
cisco Yacht Club; Commodore E. F. Sa
gar, Corinthian Yacht Club; C. H. Mor
rell, San Francisco Yacht Club; A. G. A.
Mueller, San Francisco Yacht Club: J. H.
Keefe, port captain â¢ Corinthian Yacht
Club, and James M. Patrick, San Francis
co Yacht Club. In order that work might
be carried on systematically Colonel Beck
was elected chairman and Commodore
Bridgman secretary of the temporary or
ganization which has taken in charge the
collection of funds from the coast.
By the movement set on foot at a meet-
Ing of prominent yachtsmen in the parlors
of the Olympic Club last night San Fran
cisco and the Pacific Coast are to unite
In assisting the lovers of aquatic sports
in New York to tender Sir Thomas LJp
ton, the gallant yachtsman, a magnificent
testimonial of the appreciation in which
he is held by all true American lovers
of sport. As a result of the meeting it
was determined to allow yachting clubs
from Seattle to San Diego to add their
contributions to the sum which will be
raised in this city, so that a grand total
of several thousand dollars may be sent
East .to swell the fund already subscribed
to in New- York.
SEIGER AND BRITT
ARE * FI1IAXLY MATCHED
Alex Grepsalns of the San Francisco
Athletic Club has finally clinched the
match between Charley Seiger and Jimmy
Britt. The lightweights are to meet in
Mechanics' Pavilion on October K Seiner
arrived yesterday from Seattle. He went
immediately to Sheehan'3 Beach Tavern,
where he will train for the fight. He is
a friend of Benny Yanger and put on tha
glove3 with the Italian boxer.
Seiger proved clever with the gloves,
although he is more oT a fighter than a
boxer. He weighs about 140 pounds at
present.
It is expected that Hanlon will be a
7 to 10 choice over Yanger when they
meet in the ring for the second time.
The Ycscmite Athletic Club officials aro
using even" effort to match Fltzsimmona
and Gardner for their November date.
The war of words between Fitzslmmona
and Corbett is not taken seriously here,
as it is not expected Corbett will ever
train for another fight.
The principal event at the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club to-morrow night will
be the bout between Gus Koster and Jack
Barney of Salt Lake. They will weigh
ISO pounds. There will be seven bouts
in aH.
The members of the Olympic Club will
witness a special programme of boxlns
to-niRht in the Post-street gymnasium.
The boxers have all been carefully match
ed by Leader Gleason and exciting con
tests are expected.

Then Delmas walloped the ball to the
outfield, and Pabst arrived. Raymond laid
down a twister at* the plate. Some one
of the Senators gave Graham the office
to pelt the leather to second to head off
Delmas. This he did, and while the sphere
was being chased by McLaughlin. Delmas
made third and Raymond second. Lynch
responded with a drive to right field, and
they both came in and the score was a
tie.
Mike Fisher's men jumped boldly into
the lead at the outset yesterday after
noon at Recreation Park. For a while
they maintained their fast gait. Then
they grew weak suddenly and quit like a
lot of third-class sluggers. In the mean
time the home tossers were game and
landed for four in the fifth round. The
rest was easy for them, so they saved
themselves from going into second place
by copping the game. Score, 6 to 4.
The Senators made a good start. Every
man on the team was there with the life
and ginger and determined to fade the
natives to a fare-ye-well. They might
have done this,' only they were just a
little off the scent in the fifth, when the
j?ame was broken up. The score was 4 to
0 then, and Mike was riding easy. Sud
denly Zearfo?s chopped off a single and
old man Pabst dropped a slow one at
Keefe. He threw the ball away at sec
ond, giving Zearfoss time to clear the
plate and Pabst to land at third.

The remainder of the programme was

and Eddie Carr finished Matt Wallace
with one decisive wallop on the jaw dur
ing a mixup in the initial period.
But the aspect changed in the second.
Thomas began to use a straight left and
this stopped the rushes of Braun to a
certain extent. The latter was garqe.
however, and came up in the third round
with a swollen face and weak from the
beating he was getting. He started to
rush it at the outset, but Thomas met
his advances with his left. He was fast
cutting his opponenfs face to ribbons,
when the latter was seen to staggger.
Then Thomas aimed two swings on
Braun's jaw and he went to the floor to
rise no more until he had been counted
out.
The bout was the main event of the
Bay City Club's monthly show and lt
attracted much Interest. Braun was the
favorite and in the first round showed to
advantage. Thomas was puzzled at the
Olympian's fast rushes and lt seemed he
would soon succumb.
George Braun, the Olympic Club wel
ter-weight boxer and hero of many a een
satlonal battle in the amateur ring, suc
cumbed last night before the fierce on
slaught of Joe Thomas. The fight ended
during the third round. So spectacular
was the sudden finish that the spectators
stood up and yelled till the echoes of

NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â John J. Ryan,
the "get-rich-qulck man" whoso recent
rlun^es at Gravesend created a sensa
tion^ was compelled to take a back seat
to-day by "PHtsburg Phil" and John A.
Drake. "Pittsburg Phil," who has won
more money this season than any of the
big plungers, is skid to have cleaned up
$60,000 on the dayâ *20,Q00 on Pulsus, win
ner of the third race, and $40,000 on Lord
Turco, belonging: to his brother, "Bill"
Smith, In the fourth event.
"Pittsburg Phil" has complained repeat
edly of the fact that some layers either
refuse to take his money or chop the
odds to a minimum when they find that
he and his commissioners are betting on
a certain horse; so when he got ready
to unbelt on Lord Turco lie adopted a
novel method of getting his money down.
He hunted up several jnen with long
whiskers who looked like farmhands and
cent them into the rinsr when the price
Â» gainst Lord Turco had gone up as high
as 10 to 1 in some books. With a wild
rush the bewhiskered individuals swooped
down on the unsuspecting layers, betting
S'-OO and $1000 at a clip, straight, place
and third. Several swept the deadline
where better odds were offered and in a
few minutes there was a panic in the
ring.
A coterie of heavy bettors made a "kill
ing" on Hello In the fifth racÂ«?. He was at
one time at 15 to 1, but was played down
to one-third the odds. He was helped to
win by the fact that J. Lantry's The Bow.
eiy, a gift colt from Representative Sulli
van, threw his rider. De Souza, at the
post and ran away on the outside of the
track a mile and a half and took no part
in the race. The Bowery also was a good
thing, played off the boards â in -fact, he
sicted like a colt primed for a race. Mor
dclla, disqualified last Saturday, looked
to be winning again to-day, but about a
hundred yards from the finish she began
to act as if wanted to run out. and
jio- rider tapped her gently with his whip.
Hello, under persuasion, passed Mordella
in the last few strides.
J. W. Coifs Amur won the steeplechase
after Manilian had made nearly all the
running. Both horses came Into collision
shortly after leaving the last jump and
the rider of Manilian claimed a foul, but
the stewards dismissed the claim, as there
is an abrupt turn in the track, which is
a had place for accidents of this sort.

APPOINTS SUCCESSORS TO
SUSPENDED INSPECTORS
Health Board Had Warned Negligent
Official to Be More Attentive
to Duties.
The Board of Health yesterday appoint
ed Drs. Robert C. Howe and Henry D.
Fanning as assistant sanitary inspectors
to fill vacancies caused by the suspension
cf Drs. Fitzgibbons, Hartley, Green and
Hereford. Howe is on the civil service
eligible . list, but Fanning is not. The
positions were also offered to Drs. J.
Kuykendall and Reuben Hill, the remain
ing wo civil service eligibles, but they
declined appointment because It was for
too short a period. Dr. Fred C. Muller
was also appointed to one of the vacan
cies, as told in yesterday's Call.
It appears that the four suspended in
spectors were warned several times to be
more attentive to their duties, but failed
to heed the warning. It was then de
cided by the Health Board to make an
example of them In the hope that they
would be more attentive to their sanitary
Inspection when they are restored to their
positions on October 5.

STATISTICIAN DISCUSSES
MORTALITY IN CITIES
Dr. Karl Ballod Says Berlin' Ranks
First for Healthfulness and
Paris Last.
BERLIN, Sept. 23.â Dr. Karl Ballod
read a paper to-day before the Interna
tional Statistical Conference on the mor
tality in large cities, contending that
cities having a population of a million in
Western Europe were healthier than
smaller cities, because the latter's sani
tary precautions were far inferior to those
of the larger cities.
Berlin, he said, was the more healthful
and London and Vienna came next. Paris
was the worst of all. Country populations
were the least healthy, but country peo
ple going to the cities were healthier than
town-bred people. While the rural popu
lations were stationary in Germany since
1871, the cities had doubled their popu
lations and the country was increasing
in population by nearly a million a year.

The Grand Lodge of thÂ« Ancient Order

cession in Bteinway Hall this morning
for the purpose of taking action on the
new plan of rates recently promulgated
by the Supreme Lodge. Preliminary to
to-day's meeting there was a largely at
tended meeting in the hall of Excelsior
Lodge last night, at which the plan was
explained and placed in an entirely dif
ferent light from that In which It had
been heretofore presented.
This was by an interesting and logical
address by W. Warne Wilson, past su

came to this city last Monday for the
purpose of attending the session of the
Grand Lodge. He was followed by Grand
Master Workman F. W. Browning. Past

lodge to forego the usual practice of a
jolly good time at the banquet table and
Instead have a heart to heart talk on a
subject that at this time is engrossing the
attention of the membership throughout
the entire national jurisdiction.
At the Etssion to-day the several plans
within the general plan presented by the
Supreme Lodge will be explained to 300 or
more representatives and it will remain
for them to adopt or reject the new prop
osition. Should the grand body reject the
plan, it will have to make provision for
the purpose of meeting the obligations
of the order in the California jurisdic
tion.

IS THEME OF SCIENTIST
Declares That a Decisive Factor la
Nourishing Infants With ivm-fr
of Cows.
BERLIN. Sept. 23.-The Deutschen
Medesche Voschiegrlft publishes a synop
sis of a lecture which Professor von.Behr-
Ing of Marburg will deliver before The
German materialists" congress at Cassel
next Friday. Professor von Behring does
not believe that tuberculosis can be In
herited or contracted epidemically by an
adult. He asserts, however, that a de
cisive factor in the spread of tuberculosis
is the nourishing of infants with milk
taken from cows suffering from, that dis
ease.
The human infant like the young of all
animals lacks the digest! w apparatus and
protective organs which in the case of
grown-up persons prevents the germs en
tering Into the tissues. As a consequerca
he contends young children should bÂ«
nourished with milk free from the germs
of tuberculosis.
Professor von Behring*Â» efforts are be
ing directed toward the substitution Â©f
sanitariums and a system of inoculation
for consumption hospitals. He la firmly
convinced that, like animals, human
beings can be rendered immune by Inocu
lation wtth tuberculosis toxine obtained
from cows. The professor, however, dis
tinctly says that his experiments to ob
tain a perfect toxine aro not completed.

GOMEL, Government of Mohile, Russia,
Sept 21.â The Associated Press corre
spondent has made an investigation on
the spot of the "pogrom," as the Rus
sians describe the anti-Semite riots which
occurred here September 11 and were re
newed for several days. The riots were
smaller, but perhaps, more remarkable
than 4hose which took place at Kishenev,
because .the police and military, openly
aided the plunderers and murderers, the
"pogromshiks," as . the . Russians called
them. The troops, supported by many
educated and well-to-do Christians,
formed a movable" shield behind which
the "pogromshiks" ruthlessly demolished
tho Jewish homes and Bhops and cruelly
clubbed such Jews as fell into their
hands, leisurely proceeding from street to
street and from district to district as they
did so.
The commerce and Industry of Gomel,
which is considerable, is largely in the
hands of the Jewish population, number-
Ing 25,000. Few of the residents are
wealthy, but none is a pauper. The Jew
ish artisans Incline to socialism.
. The trouble began September 11, a holi
day, the day of the beheading of John
the Baptist, In a wrangle in the fruit and
fish market between Moujiks (peasants)
and Jews. The wrangle ended in a free
fight, In which many were wounded, one
moujlk succumbing to his injuries.
The moujiks demanded vengeance and
employed the following days, Saturday
and Sunday, in inflaming the anti-Semitic
feeling, the leaders being an officer
named Penski and a rich merchant named
Petrachenko.
EXPECTED THE "POGKOM."
Everybody knew that a pogrom would
occur on Monday and the JewH appealed
for protection to Chief of Police Ravaki,
who summoned an infantry - regiment
from its summer encampment Thus
there were 1600 soldiers In the town. At
luncheon hour on Monday the anti-
Semitic railway workmen to the number
of some hundreds began an organized at
tack on the Jewish houses in Zamoovoky
street, sacking them and demolishing or
spoiling the bulky articles by soaking
them with kerosene. Police Chief Ravaki
had placed police and troops on the Za
moovoky, but they acted as though they
Intended to protect the pogromshlks from
interference. The Jews from the outside
who attempted.to rescue their co-religion
ists were brutally clubbed by the soldiers'
guns, bayoneted or arrested. Meanwhile
recruits for the pogromshlks poured in
steadily over the bridge leading from, the
railway workshops. A bystander begged
the commander of the gendarmerie to
send troops to guard the exit from the
bridge. The officer replied threatening
the man with arrest and saying: "We
know what we have to do."
The plunderers now proceeded from
street to street, the troops and police fol
lowing them and cutting off access to the
devastated Jewish houses. They subse
quently visited the Jewish quarter called
"America," then Konnaya Square, the
upper end of Roumianzovskaya street, the
principal thoroughfare of the town, and
the district called "Caucasus."
FIRE UPON JEWS.
Altogether nearly 400 houses and, shops
were wholjy or partially wrecked, the
windows smashed, the blinds and frames
being splintered and every scrap of furni
ture and effects, even the samovars, sew
ing machines, mirrors and lamps, destroy
ed or stolen. The Jews -who aid not take
refuge with compassionate Christians or
conceal themselves in cellars were se
verely beaten and in many cases dan
gerously wounded. Some young Jews, ex
asperated by the action of the police and
troops, armed themselves with any avail
able weapons and tried to force v their
way to the threatened houses. One Jew
ess attempted to' shoot a non-commis
sioned officer and twenty-five revolver
shots were heard in the vicinity of the
bazaar, but were apparently fired in the
air, as no one was hurt.
The police then undertook to disarm the
Jews. Forty building laborers collected
in the busiest part of Roumianzovskaya
street and stopped and beat every passing
Jew. This gang was encouraged by As
sistant Police Captain Charlononsky and
Rural Police Commander Yeleinski. The
gang clubbed Berg Kevesh to death in the
presence of these officers, and after the
victim had been removed to the hospital
Yeleinski continued an amicable conver
sation with the murderers, none of whom
was arrested. The Jews rallied In force
at Kennaya square at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, when the military fired on
them, killing three and wounding others.
Presumably on the Governor's instruc
tions, the military employed their fire
arms against the pogromshiks In the
Caucasus, killing three. This action and
nightfall put an end to the pogrom.
DISORDERS RENEWED.
Four hundred peasants arrived In Gomel
early the following day (Tuesday) but
were easily driven away by the military.
A few houses were pillaged that day and
two more on Wednesday, after which no
disorders occurred until September 18.
when a fruit gardener named Zvagelsky
was barbarously slaughtered by thieves.
The other Jews killed were Pilatsky, mur
dered by peasants in the village of Ver
ouimo, five miles distant, where he had
taken refuge with his wife, who has be
come Insane, and in GomelitztfV Davidov,
Lelkln and Elpern, clubbed to death by
the military or the mob; and Kagansky
and Oberman, shot and bayonetted; Sixty
four Jews were registered as wounded
and probably forty others left the city
without being registered.
During the week following the riots all
the trains leaving the city were crowded
with a thousand Jewish famiyes. The
Christian dead numbered five, of whom
the troops shot three. Ten Christians are
recorded as wounded.
The Jewish committee claims to be able
to identify ninety-five pogromshlks, but
only about. twenty-five Christians have
been arrested. Including one telegraph of
ficial. Over, fifty Jews were arrested for
carrying weapons or conspiring against
the police. . - - . -;, '.-'Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Fears are expressed that the coming
market days, September 27 and 28, may
witness a. repetition of. the pogrom.' The
present attitude of the military Â¦ is; dis
quieting. Last night, the soldiers play
fully clicked their rifles at the Jewish
ladies and then laughed boisterously at
their fright. .

BUDAPEST, Hungary, Sept. 23.â The
text of the royal autograph letter reln
trustlng Count Hedervary with the forma
tion of a new Cabinet was published to
day In a special issue of the Gazette. In
it Emperor Francis Joseph says he is
deeply grieved at the deplorable circum
stances which binder the working of the
state machinery. Â«.He cannot, however,
assent to any measures regarding the
common army which would possibly
weaken both halves of the monarchy and
which are not in accord with the interests
of Hungary, the Integrity of which they
would Jeopardize. The Emperor adds that
he is nevertheless desirous of giving ef
fect to the concessions announced in the
lower house I of the Hungarian Diet by
former Premier de Czell and by Premier
Hedervary, which he deemB to be admis
sible reforms.
The conclusion of the Emperor's post
script runs as. follows:
My Hungarian nation has advanced since the
Ausglelch (the fiscal and commercial agree
ment between Austria and Hungary) with gi
gantic strides. I notice with satisfaction that
gratifying progress as a fresh evidence of the
wisdom of the work achieved by mutual confi
dence between the crown and nation. So It
must be and so it must remain in the future.
By the favor of the divine Providence our con
stitutional Ufa has been- so far preserved from
all serious convulsions. The sobriety and re
straint of the nation and the well-weighed
consideration of all the interests involved can
alone preserve ua from trying: evils In tha fu
ture. Â¦ *
It Is therefore my duty aa ruler to inform
the nation that I still adhere to the Auaglelch.
It is my conviction that the spirit which cre
ated this work still lives in its old strength
in the soul of tha nation. I- confide In your
judgment, trusting that you will explain to the
constitutional representation of Hungary, which
stands so* near to my heart, what my paternal
intentions are. and that you will discover a
happy issue to thÂ« present situation, wnicn is
dangerous alike to the country and tho mon
archy.
VIENNA, Sept. 23.â The Reichsrath re
assembled to-day to pass, as Premier von
Koerber explained, a bill amending the
recruiting law in order to meet the diffi
culties created by the Hungarian Diet.
Dr. von Koerber said some of the Hun
garian demands were calculated not only
to undermine the unity of the Austro-
Hungarian army, but to affect Austria's
rights in the common army. The Em
peror maintained this view, and the pro
posed bill provided that Austria should
not enroll an increased number of recruits
unless a corresponding Increase was pro
vided by Hungary. The Premier urged
the speedy adoption , of the measure, so
that time-expired men might not be dis
charged. Demonstrations Â¦ were made,
mingled with cheers.
LONDON, Sept. 23.â To the strains of
"The Star Spangled Banner," "Marching
Through Georgia" and other American
airs some 200 members of the Honorable
Artillery Company left their London ar
mory to-day and took a train for Liver
pool to embark on the Dominion Line
steamer Mayflower, bound for Boston,
Mass. Prior to the departure of the ar
tilleryman, Lieutenant Colonel Karl of
Denbelgh commanding, paraded the com
pany, whose smart uniforms and good
alignment created an excellent Impres
sion. V .;Â¦.:.. *
A splendid reception was extended to
the artillerymen on their arrival at Liv
erpool. The Lord Mayor and other city
officials met them at the railway station,
from, which the company marched to the
Town Hal^ where a formal greeting was
given them. They afterward marched to
the docks, where thousands gathered and
gave them an enthusiastic sendoff.
As the Mayflower sailed at 8 o'clock
this evening Lieutenant Colonel the Earl
of Denbigh received the following tele
gram from the King:
"I wish you and tho Honorable Artil
lery Company a good passage out and
a safe return home. I feel convinced that
you will all meet with a moat gratifying
reception in. the United States.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.-The execu
tive council of the American Federation
of Labor to-day considered the case of
W. A. Miller, the foreman of the book
binders, who was dismissed from the
Government printing office because he
had been expelled from the local Book
binders* Union and who was subsequently
reinstated by order of President Roose
velt, but deferred action. The case was
under consideration by the executive
council for some time, but all that was
made public concerning it Is embraced
to the following official statement:
James W. Dougherty, secretary of thÂ« Inter
national Bookbinders' Union, accompanied by
a committee of that organization, appeared be
fore the executive council in the William A.
Miller case. The matter was thoroughly gono
into, documents read and a copy of the evi
dence submitted. Further consideration of the
subject was deferred until later la the present
session.
The council awarded Jurisdiction of
putty glazing to the brotherhood of
painters and decorators. The Amalga
mated Glass Workers' International Asso
ciation was denied jurisdiction over plate
glass and cathedral glass makers. The
dispute between the Machinists' Associ
ation and that of the Allied Metal Me
chanics was compromised by an agree
ment that the International Association
of Allied Metal Mechanics shall call a
constitutional convention to be attended
by a delegate of the International Associ
ation of Machinists for the purpose of
effecting a working agreement between
the two organizations. A charter was
denied to the National Die Cutters and
Makers because various branches already
are under the jurisdiction of existing In
ternational unions. An application for a
charter was denied in the case of the In
ternational Union of Sign Painters. Pres
ident Gompers was authorized to call a
convention for the formation of an inter
national union of paper box makers.
The first of a course of twelve lectures
on the "New Views of the French Revo
lution" v,as delivered by Professor H.
Morse Stephens last night at the Mechan
ics' Institute. There was a big attend
ance and theÂ»lecture was enjoyed for its
force, its sincerity and for the new aspect
which Professor Stephens throws around
the familiar subjects.
In speaking of the troublous events that
have long ago passed in France, but
which at all time make interesting mat
ter for discussion, Professor Stephens
made it plain that it was his intention to
tell of historical periods and personages
of France in a truthful veinâ that is, sans
the particular historical form or attire
which it had pleased Dickens in his "Tale
of Two Cities" and Carlyle to paint in
lurid, dramatic colors.
Professor Stephens said that it is the
aim of the historian of to-day, with the
facts he has at his disposal, to give in
formation of men and affairs as they
were. He would have the student know
that the historian of the present period
is untrammeled, while the historian of the
past was subjective. Though . the object
of present day historians Is to place his
tory in its bare and unvarnished form be
fore the world, the change from the
hysterical and dramatic had not yet, he
said, quite penetrated into the minds of
the public
The new history, said Professor Steph
ens, throws an entirely new light on the
past, and while, it ~ is less dramatic and
less picturesaue, it Is mqre 'intelligible.
He treated historical personages as they
wefe, gave credit where condemnation
had been plastered' thickly* on the inno
cent, while he raised to dignity men
whose names had been spotted with ex
ecration by historians of the pnst. The
unfolding of the truth, the whole 'truth
and nothing but the truth, is the object
of the modern historian, declared Profes
sor Stephens. The picturesque may fade
when they come to tell the true dally
condition of men and women, he said,
but then they had the facts, and facts
at this period were more than poetry
and poetic prose and descriptions that
were hysterically dramatic.
Last night's lecture was a vivid, power
ful and interesting preface. The lectures
proper will follow, Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette being the next historical sub
jects to receive the attention of Profes
sor Stephens at the Mechanics* . Institute.
As many as couldâ men, women and
childrenâ crowded into Mission Turn Vc
rein Hall last night to attend the meet
ing of the Mission Park Association, and
those present were amply repaid by good
speaking and an interesting programme of
varied musical numbers.
The hall was beautifully decorated with
American flags and the stage, filled with
flowers and potted plants, was dressed in
semblance of a sylvan dell hung with Jap
anese lanterns. A finger post bore the
legend, "To Mission Park." Eustace Cul
linane presided and opened the meeting
with a few felicitious remarks. He was
followed by Miss Carroll, who sang in a
delicious soprano voice two selections, the
latter In response to an enthusiastic en
core.
Mrs. Keith, well known in public work
and an ardent advocate of the proposed
new park system, was the first speaker.
She made a forcible plea for all the im
provements contemplated in the pending
bond issue, but above all she urged the
necessity for parks in behalf of the chil
dren pining for fresh air, of the wearied
men and women, to whom the fragrance
and beauty of a block or two stolen from
the fields and mountains would act as a
blessing beyond price.
After the Orpheum Quartet had ren
dered three numbers in a highly accept
able manner former Mayor James D. Phe
lan, himself a resident of the Mission all
his life, was introduced. He was accord
ed a welcome from his neighbors of such
a prolonged and vociferous nature as to
assure beyond question the esteem in
which he is held by them.
He said that he was glad that for the
first time the city had before it a cam
paign In which measures and not men
were the Issues. These measures, he said,
were certain, to remain in office forever,
as they were in the nature of permanent
improvements and would carry out all
the promises that had been made for
them. We are not engaged in building a
city, he said, but In repairing one. We
had been forced by circumstances, he
said, into erecting a great city, but the
conditions under which this was done
were such that much of the work had
been accomplished in a haphazard and
unsatisfactory manner. One of the omis
sions, he said, was a sufficiency of parks,
which would Insure resting places and
fresh air reservoirs for the great popu
lation now here and the creater popu
lation that was bound to come. The
speaker advocated all the proposed parks,
dwelling especially on those for the Mis
sion district and St. Mary's Square.
Arnold and Ethel Grazer gave two mu
sical specialty numbers and were followed
by Thomas Hickey, Charles Sweigert and
P. H. McCarthy, each of whom in short
speeches urged upon those present to use
their utmost endeavors to secure the pas
sage of the entire bond issue. The meet
ing was earnestly enthusiastic and showed
the zeal of the campaign that is being
waged for a "City Beautiful." ,
It Is an old maxim that the man and
the occasion are required for a great
speech. In a similar way one might say
that the women, the music and the occa
eicn are required for great singing, espe
cially whe^ "Carmen" is the opera and
the Tivoll is the theater.
Bizet, Stcindorff's orchestra and an ex
cellent Italian opera company were at the
historic Tivoli la^t nightâ and the cul
tured Marchesir.i was there, too, to sing
against that theater's fond memories of
Collaxnartni. It was her chance. But the
fates were unkind to the brilliant young
wcnan, though her work was remarka
ble, considering the handicap of a cold.
*tt'ith a doctor at her elbow, and the fear
tf a failure to rasp her nerves, her battle
*vas nobleâ end the audience was kind.
The result of this misfortune was that
the listeners received every promise of a
etrorg and brilliant Carmen, but each
premise, alas, was necessarily broken Just
Chort of fulfillment â and none were so
forely disappointed as the finished Mar
chesicl herself, whose heart sank as Ehe
trembled on the border of great things,
then had to hesitate and hold back as she
Celt the clutch of an enemy in her bron
chial tubes. The fear of a strain or a
breakdown kept her from Boarlng to the
places where she has already made her
fame. Though not herself, ehe was nev
ertheless artistic and pleasing. Lacking
tho dash and abandon of conscious
bea!th and strength, she yet scored a de
tided hit, and the audience showed its ap
preciation. Russo was there, and, know
ing the circumstances, he yet expressed
himself to the effect that her Carmen was
Superb.
It is to be hoped that the delightful
Marchesini will be fully recovered In a
Jew fiaye, for there is little doubt that she
will capture the city when she is herself
once more. Those who know her brilliant
record in Bizet's famous masterpiece will
"watch eagerly for the announcement that
Marchesini is to appear again, for she
ehowed great power last night and some
of her work was brilliant, but the bril
liancy was subdued by the ground glass
cf bronchial misfortune.
The performance was creditable
throughout, and Ischierdo was an ideal
Don Jose, one of his favorite roles. He
ceptured the house again and again. The
Avofk of Tromben touched a responsive
audience and the entire performance was
"well-balanced and pleasing.
"The Prince of Pilsen" at the Columbia
Theater is meeting with the success pre
dicted for it. There is bo much catchy
music and pood acting- and sing-ing-, and
the scenery and costumes are so excellent
that the ensemble calls for the highest
commendation. Jess Dandy in the role
of the "Zinzinnati." Brewer and Miss
Trixie Friganza as the widow keep up
the vivacity of the work and Arthur Don
aldson as the Prince has also won strong
favor.

with a badly battered engine. As the train
rounded the turn coming down from En

head on the track. The train was on the
down grade and traveling fast. The en
gine passed over the heavy chunk of iron,
which badly damaged the works under
neath and broke many of the connections.
Tho tender and baggage car were like
wise damaged and two wheels of the front
truck of the mail car were throv/n off
the track. It was more than a thousand
yards from where the obstruction was
first struck where the train was finally
stopped. Had there been a more seriou3
derailment the train with its 125'passen
gers must have been piled up. in the
ditch with serious Ices "of \\.ts. A section
gang had to be sent back from Del Mar
to remove the drawhead,. as Conductor
ClegK, who went back to look at it, could
not move it. I

The circular of Somers & Co. saya of Hay:
"Hay shipments during the past week have
been somewhat heavier than for the week pre
ceding, the total with to-day's arrivals being
4100 tons, an Increase of 5txÂ» tons. This does
not mean that more Hay has actually been
loaded at the various shipping points, but is the
result of the Oakland blockade being raised'
To-day there is practically nothing sidetracked
across the bay for chlpment here whereas
last week the accumulation there was quite
heavy. The fields are rapl-lly being cleaned,
the tracks are now becoming cleared and It
would seem that matters will soon be In good
shape for the winter. One exception to this
fÂ£ n r noted ' and JÂ£ nt ls ln connection with
the Alfalfa crop. There Is yet a large quan
tity of it to be Bhipped here. Much has not yet
been baled and It is Generally conceded that
with out usual rains the later cuttings will ''be.
badly damaged.
I "There is nothing new to report locally for
I the market continues to be featureless with
holders of Hay awaiting the winter demand
with considerable Interest. The Government
still withhold? Us awards for the Manila Hay
shipments, and there is no outside demand of
any great consequence to be noted.
"We can report no change ln prices from tho
quotations of last week, for there has been no
change In any way. We still, note a rather
, scant supply of the gilt edge grades of Hay
and choice Alialfa, with medium grades of all
kinds of. Hay very plentiful." .

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
CHICApO, Sept. 23.â Wheat opened firm, in
fluenced largely by the bull sentiment carried
over from last night. Dece.mber selling early
Â¦Â«'P to 78%c. but the fine weather, the bearish
situation in foreign markets and weakness
-which flnaUy ruled In the Xorthweet and at
St. Louis, induced heavy selling by commis
sion house*, and the feeling turned bearish.
December went off to 77 %c under the pres
sure. The absence of export business was a
depressing factor, while cables were Indiffer
ent at the cjoee. Local traders bought freely,
however, on the sharp bulge in ccrn prices,
while wheat was at the low mark, and the
close showed a portion of the loss regained,
but with December still lVÂ«c under yesterday's
.finish figure, at 77V4@77%c. Trade was large
and aoaive.
Corn, after ripening at a trifle higher, was
dragged down by the weakness in wheat, but
later renewed its upward tendency, and the
close was VifWVic better for the December
option at 47%Â©47\4c.
Oats stiowed considerable strength the
greater part of the day In sympathy with corn.
December rtiosfd \i<a%c higher at 37%Â«J37f(,o.
The provision maxket was also slow. October
pork closed 10c lower; lard 15c lower and rib3
5c lower.

CORN â The crop situation is the great fac

from Chicago yesterday said that reports show
undoubted damage to the crop anrl that the
feeling is stronger notwithstanding the Govern
ment rej>ort.
There is nothing new in this market, which Is
quiet.
Chicago declined aeain. Wires from there
paid that the market would be stronger but for
the uncertainty regarding the mlil Ftrike at
Minneapolis, word being received that n gen

Conditions ami prices In the fruit market
6howert little change, supplies being ample,
shipping requirements moderate and the local
demand nothing extra. Peaches ruled weak.
Solway Freestones, which constitutor! the bulk
of supplies, were abundant and even the very
best offerings were hard to dispose of. There
were no Strawberry Freestones received from
the mountain districts. That .variety would
have found prompt sale ahove the quotations
had there been any available. Offerings in
bulk were plentiful and easy, as the canners
were indifferent buyers and were only picking
up bargain?. A carload was reported sold at
$10 per ton and a bid of $8 was rejected on
another car. Nearly ail varieties of table
Grafies were in free supply and although orders
for shipping were plentiful, prices showed lit
tle change, stocks being too heavy to permit
of any advance. The ton quotation for crates
was obtained only for fine Isabella and Tokays.
Â« ; 5c being the top for other varieties. Good
Zinfaniel Wine 'Grappa sold off well at $22i9'.'5
per ton. â¢ while poor stock frcm Lodl moved
slowly at $18-320. There were occasional sales
of small quantities of fln= stock reported at
$26. Fancy Apples and Pears continued to
move off wen at good prices, while common
offerings dragged nt unsteady rates. Quinces.
I'run?g, Figa and Pomegranates were in ample
supply and stood about as previously quoted.
Melons were plentiful and dull. Nutmeg
Melons and Watermelons were unchanged
while Cantaloupes had a sharp decline, owing
to the poor quality of most of the offerings
The usual quantity of Berries came In an<l
prices had but slight â¢ variation. Attractive
lots found prompt sale at- good < prices,- while
pcor and soft stock moved slowly. Price* of
Citrus Fruits hart no noteworthy change. Ripe
Bananas wÂ»re very scarce, the recent arrivals
being mostly green. Pineapples were un
changed. â¢

Ranch Eggs are quoted higher and firm at
the advance, with light receipts and stocks.
The movement in Eastern and cold storage
goods continues large.
Butter Is not firm at the advance, and most
dealers report the market dragging. Stocks
are sufficient, but not especially heavy.
Cheese stands about the same. Strictly fine
mild new is none too plentiful, but the market
Is overloaded with medium and lower grades,
which dealers are having difficulty to sell.

and municipal bonds may be substituted for
such of the Government 5s as are on deposit
to secure circulation and Government deposits
with the banks removes the only possible ob
ject for holding the bonds to maturity. Some
stimulation of the demand for Stats and mu
nicipal bonds for purposes of this substitution
is also a probability, which would have the ef
fect of stiffening the general bond market in
any period of confidence. But Jt proved pow
! erless in to-day's market. Sterling exchange
continued firm. The principal weakness of the
day was concentrated in a few stot-ks. The
weakr.es* of Amalgamated was attributed to
pool liquidation, thought to be prompted by the
weakness of the metal in London and of for
j eign copper. Xew York Central continued to
suffer from the financial requirements to be
j faced, although inspired assurances came from
the directors' meeting to-day that no attempt
would be made to meet these for several
j month? yet. The Southern Railway stocks
I were afft-cted by unfavorable criticism or the
I showing of earnings in the annual report. Much
I felling of Baltimore and Ohio and Pennsyl-
I varia was attributed to Philadelphia and Pitts-
I burg account, supposed to be due to the col
i lapse of the Consolidated Lake Superior Com
rany and the prowlng tendency toward reor
! ganization in the iron and steol markets.
The cooler weather in the corn belt and' fears
of frosts to-niRht hurt the grangers. The
market closed hÂ»nvy at about the lowest.
The weakness of Unltc-d States Steel second

The row had its inception last January,
when the Building Trades Council ex
pelled the cornice workers. It was
claimed at ' the Â¦ time .by the mechanics
that the expulsion was without warrant
and contrary to the' rules of- the 'council,
in that- they were not given a chance' to
make any defense or show cause why
they should be allowed to affiliate with
that body. It is on these . grounds that
the suit for the writ of mandate is based.
The courts have been called upon to
settle the differences between the Cornice
Workers' Union No. 104 and the Building
Trades Council. Yesterday a suit for a
writ of mandate compelling the council
to, restore the union to membership was
filed . by Congressman Julius Kahn. The

charges made by police officers that led
the Chinese soldier to end his life. .
-i Before putting an end to himself. Tom
King Yung wrote a letter in -which he
protested his innocence and said that he
could not live in face of the disgrace put
upon him. . .
' The Chinese Minister at Washington
has made a request on the Government
asking that an Immediate investigation be
had. The Chinese Consul General at Ha
waii is now en' route to' this 'city to assist
the local Consul in the investigation that
has been asked for. s
Chinese musicians played their loudest
and the prirsts chanted and intoned in
a shrill tone, while the paper represent
ing money was distributed with a liberal
hand. For an hour the services con
tinued and then" the signal was gven for
the return to the cty. |
The body of Torn ' King Yung was
brought back to Chinatown and deposited
at an â¢ undertaker's establishment in
charge of the priests. ' ft will be for

was a most elaborate one. There were
roast groats, shiny glazed . pigs, ducks,
chickens, fruits, vegetables, rice and tea
In sufficient quantity to have satisfied' the
The room In which the body. of. Tom
King Tung lay was crowded with flora!
emblems, the gifts of relatives ; and
friends, and the picture of the deceased
was displayed, framed in flowers. ' ~
FEAST IS ELABORATE.
From' early morning until half an hour
past noon crowds of Chinese visited the'
consulate -_ to pay their: respects -to :the
dead. The walls of the mortuary-room
were draped in costly silken banners and
the air of the building was heavy with
Incense. The members of the consulate,
led by the Consul, together with -the of
ficers of the Six Companies, paid their
respects to the dead man . at an early
hour. AH the officials were dressed in
light blue gowtis, the sign of mourning,
and they frequently prostrated themselves
before the bier. .Punk sticks were burned
and paper prayers were consumed by flre
In a brass bowl by the officials, and the
hundreds of merchant! who visited .{the
consulate honored the dead man In a
similar manner.
The body of , Tom King; Yung reposed, In
a masjgjve walnut casket in one of the
rooms of ' the consula'te, and for ma/iy'
hours solemn services were held In the
room of' death, j In front' of the : casket
an altar had - been erected, whereon

IS Yung, who was a secretary to the
jj Consul General here' and military
attache of the Chinese legation at
Washington, took place yesterday.
Never in the history of Chinatown has a
more gorgeous funeral spectacle been wit
nessed there. . ,* Â¦
Tom King Yung was a noted man In the
eyes of his countrymen, and his arrest
a week ago by police officers oh" a "charge"
of Immoral conduct and his subsequent
suicide created a.scnsation In Chinese cir
cles. By order of the Six Companies' and
with the consent of Consul General Chong
Poa Shu all business Â¦ was- suspended in-
Chinatown- yesterday. The day was ob
served as _qne of general mourning for
the dead soldier, not a storekeeper or
peddler being, engaged .in his usual occu
pation. /
Flags were flying over Chinatown at
half-mast and mourning emblems were
displayed oji all sides. The center. of in
terest was at the Chinese^ consulate, on
Stockton street, where' Tom -King 'Yung
ended his. life and where his. body re
mained until yesterday.
At an early Â¦-Â¦ hour crowds of Chinese
commenced to gather in front- of the con
sulate. The front of the building was
draped In black and Vhite, and huge" red
signs told, of the # life and death, of the
man who was tojbe buried with' all hon
ors by his fellow 'countrymen.

The feast was displayed in the room
where the body of . Tom King Yung lay
I and in the adjacent chambers. The.edi
f b!es were not for human consumption, but
j were intended to propitiate the evil spirits
| that mieht. pursue the soul of the dead
man on his Journey- to the eternal abode.
At the noon hour the streets adjacent
to the consulate were black with human
ity.- Thousands of- Chinese gathered on
the sidewalks and there were crov/ds of
[White' people, attracted by curiosity.- "On
all sides could be heard the rattle and
bang of the Chinese musicians stationed
in the various Josshduses, ..where services
I for Tom King Yung were being held. . .]. .
! It was nearly 1 p. m. before the signal
I was given .for ' thfe funeral- pageant- to
start. Ahead rode -three mounted police
I officers, followed by white and blue robed
priests on horseback and a white military,
band playing .a dirge.. Â¦ Dozens of blue :
garbed mourners of the powerful ' Tom
family, to which the, deceased belonged,
followed In twos.' They 'carried "decorated
wands, on top of which were Chinese
characters.
Then came two dozen, lads, dressed in
blue, bearing aloft banners inscribed in
Chinese letters telling of the rank of the
deceased. Â¦ > -

The funeral dirge. of- the military band;
was almost drowned by the many Chinese'
musicians who - rode in . carriages. /The
dash of the cymbals and the 'shrill pip
ing of the flute players lent a vivid air of
Oriental realism to the scene! The pro
cession marched | from the consulate on

. McCloskey presented an affidavit In court
yesterday afternoon reciting these facts
and claiming that under the Penal Code
the men governing the Chinese Six Com
panies were unlawfully interfering with
the process and proceeding of the court,
thereby rendering themselves guilty of
contempt. The affidavit also alleged- that
among the Chinese in'thls city were many
relatives of the defendant, who by rea
son of the mandate of the Six Companies
were afraid to assist him In hrs defense
because the .meaning of the mandate was
that all persons would be dealt with ac
cording to the Chinese custom of taking
of. life and confiscation of property.
It was further alleged that the Chinese
Six Companies ' were familiar with the
laws of the State and the laws relating to
contempt of court as they had the law
firm of Chickering & Gregory to advise
them and Mr. Carr of that firm was spe
cially prosecuting Woo Shuck, therefore
their interference in the case was done
knowingly and with the intent to intimi
date the witnesses for the defense
No matter of what color he is. or who he
is, we forbid any party or parties, openly or
secretly, to aid or employ attorneys to defend
the defendant or in any way to assist in clear-
Ing him. We regard the parties who defend
the defendant as robbers themselves and we
will endeavor to prosecute and punish the party
or parties who aid the defendant for the same
offense according to our regulations.
On September 5 a notice was posted on
the walls throughout Chinatown bearing
the seal of the Chinese Six Companies,
which after referring to Woo Shuck's
arrest for the robbery at Wo Sing's store
said:

FOR CONTEMPT
P. B. Lieda. 330 Pine street, secured
a warrant from Police Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest o* E. D. Beattie
on a charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses. He alleges that Beattie called
at his office on July 25. representing him
self as the president and manasrer of the
Beattie Printing Company, 320 Sansome
street, and stated that the Alaska Pack
ers' Association owed him a bill of $525
for printing.
Beattie said he wanted money, but as
the bill of the Alaska Packers' Associa
tion did not become due till September
15 he could not collect the money till that
date. He offered to assign the bill to
Ugda, who advanced him $500, the re
maining J25 being allowed for commission
and interest. LÂ»igda called upon the Alas
ka Packers' Association on September 13
and presented the bill, but was informed
that the association did not owe the Beat
tie Printing Company a cent for printing
or anything else.

CLAIMS MONEY ADVANCED
ON A MYTHIC AX ACCOUNT
P. B. Ligda Secures a Warrant for
the Arrest of E. D. Beattie. a
Mrs. Welker's maiden name was
ilackay. She had lived with Welker for a
year, but they were married aboutglthree
weeks ago. Mrs. Hunter, the landlady,
contradicts both husband and wife by
stating that they had a quarrel prior to
the Ehootins.
Detective Cody ordered fhat Welker be
detained in custody, and he was kept in
the City Prison till yesterday afternoon,
Â¦when he v/as released by order of Chief
Wittman. He made a statement that his
vile was jealous and had often threatened
to shoot herrelf. When he got home the
revolver was on top of the folding bed,
and his wife took it and shot herself be
fore he could prevent her. They did not
have a Quarrel before the shooting.
Detective Cody, accompanied by Detec
tive Coleinan and Assistant District At
torney Ward, went to the hospital, and
the woman made a statement to the ef
ftc-t that her husband came home about
3 o'clock in the morning, but they had no
quarrel. She took the revolver and tr.ot
Â£cn=olf in the left breast once. The re
volver belonged to her, and she took it off
the top of tire folding bed. She did not
know* of any cause for shooting herself
cxiept that Bbe just wanted to take her
life. Her husband was not responsible
for it in the least.
Jealousy prompted Mrs. Gladys V.
Welker, wife of Carl M. Welker. one of
the proprietors of the Headlight saloon,
224 Pacific street, to shoot herself early
yesterday morning at her residence, 505
Hyde street. She aimed at her heart,
and though the bullet passed through her
body slightly below that organ, the shock
find internal hemorrhage caused her
death at 7 o'clock p. m.
â¢ Shortly before 5 o'clock Policeman
Burkholdcr was notified by Welker that
his wife had shot herself. When Burk
holder went to the house found Mrs.
Wolker lying on the flour of her bedroom
Â¦with a irullet hole in her left breast.* A
revolver was lying on the floor beside
her, and on examining it the officer dis
covered that one chamber had Just been
discharged. Mrs. Welker was sent to the
Central Emergency Hospital In the ambu-
Jance and police headquarters Â¦were noti
fied.
VERDICT NOT BAD.
The court said also that the verdict of
the jury, finding the defendant guilty
upon the tenth count and not guilty as
to the four .preceding counts, was incon
sistent; but that this was not of itself sufr
ficient to entitle the defendant to a new
trial as to the tenth count, If there was
evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict
as to that count.
"In other words," added the court, "It
is no legal ground for setting aside the
verdict upon this count, that the jury
ought upon the same evidence to ' have
found the defendant guilty upon other
counts, but did: not. The court cannot
assume from the fact that the defendant
was acquitted upon the other counts that
the jury did not believe him to be guilty
of the charge contained in this particu
lar count.
J "The jury having found â¢ the defendant
guilty, upon this count of the Indictment;
it Is manifest that the only question for
decision at this time is whether the ver
dict in so far as it finds .the defendant
guilty is supported by the evidence arid
upon much consideration I am 'satisfied
that the evidence was such as to justi
fy the verdict. The motion for a new
trial will be denied." . ...
I have, for this reason, given very careful
consideration to the question because if it ap
peared to me that the Jury were misled by this
instruction, and so found the defendant guilty,
although they did not believe that the false
certificates were uttered by him with guilty
knowledge, I would consider It to be my duty
to grant the motion for a new trial as to these
counts. There is no rule of law better settled
than this, that the instructions of the court
to the jury must be considered as a whole,
and if. when thus considered, the law appears
to have been correctly stated, the defendant
is not entitled to a new trial because of inac
curate language used in some part of the
charge. â¢ â¢ â¢ It must be remembered
that every man of ordinary Intelligence knows
that to constitute a crime there must be union
of act and Intent, and that no crime can be
committed wlthout^there Is a criminal inten
tion upon the part of the actor. This being
so. It does not /seem probable that the Jury
was misled by the inaccurate language used in
the instruction now complained of.
Judge' de Haven went on to say that
his definition of a fraudulent certificate
in his instruction to the Jury was not an
accurate one, but such a certificate would
undoubtedly be a false certificate, and if
knowingly issued as evidence of the right
of another person than the one named in
the. original certificate to remain in the
United States would be a fraudulent cer
tificate within the meaning of the law
and within the meaning of the charges
set out in the Indictment, although the in
dictment, was not as direct and clear upon
that point as it might have been made.
There was no specific exception, said the
court, to this part of the court's charge
and the defendant might not be able ,50
urge any objection to it upon appeal. The
Judge then proceeded:
The defendant has been convicted of utter-
Ingr a forged certificate of residence and ot
having knowingly uttered fraudulent dupli
cate Chinese certificates of residence in viola
tion of section 8 of the Chinese exclusion act
of May 5. 1892. and has moved for a new
trial. The most serious question presented
arises upon certain language used by the court
in its charge to the Jury.
Judge de Haven's comments yesterday
upon the argument of Mr. Shortridge are
interesting. The following are extracts:
DE HAVEN COMMENTS.
Five years' imprisonment in the State
penitentiary in San Quentin was the pun
ishment meted out by United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven yesterday afternoon
to William H. Dillard, who had been'con
victed on four counts of an indictment
charging the prisoner with uttering a
forged certificate of residence and of felo
niously uttering fraudulent duplicate cer
tificates of residence. S. M. Shorjtrldge
made an elaborate argument on th*e mo
tion fcr a new trial and arrest of Judg
ment, but both motions were denied.
Shortridge, however, Â¦was granted a stay
of twenty days to allow him an oppor
tunity to prepare a bill of exceptions. He
will appeal to the United States Circuit
Court of -Appeals.
Dillard is a negro and was a trusted
clerk in the United States internal rev
enue office in this city under the succes
sive administrations of Collectors O. M.
Welburn and John C. Lynch. During the
trials of Welburn and the charges of em
bezzlement Dillard, who had been his
companion in many of his orgies, was
used as a witness for the Government.
After -the trial he was rewarded by pro
motion from the position of messenger to
that of clerk. Â¦ . .
