aged 5 and 7 years, and a girl aged 3.
children of Mr. and Mrs. Rube Weir
of Churn Creek, were playing about a
brush fire a quarter of a tulle from

Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock-Coit was phy
sically unable to -be present. #rt I -was
told by her physician. Dr. de Vecchi."
said Coroner: Leland. "that .he .did not

. A morbid throng of humanity filled
the Inquest-room of the. "Coroner's of
fice yesterday morning when a Jury 1
listened \to the testimony in Â¦ the case
of Major J. W. McClung, who -was shot
by -Alexander Garnett on the evening
of November 25 In the rooms of Mrs.
Lillian Hitchcock-Coit In the Palace
Hotel. A. verdict of willful' murdÂ«r
was returned by the Jury against Alex-,
ander Garnett. Â¦ -, _, ., ...
Perhaps the most interested specta-.
tor of the proceedings was Alexander
Garnett, the man accused of the'mur
der of Major McClung. The prisoner
was taken to the inquest-rodm by De-"
tectlve Ryan a few minutes* after the
â¢proceedir crs commenced and he was
jjlven a b -t in the front row of the
seats reserve I for the public. He sat_
beside his rela: ve, Porter Garnett, and'
did not allow a single word of the tes
timony to. escape him.
It was shortly after 10 o'clock yes
terday morning that Coroner Leland
called the case of Major McClung for
investigation by the Jury. District At
torney Byington was present to repre
sent the people and Attorney W. Alford
listened to the evidence on behalf of
the man that killed Major McClung.
The gathering in the' "Inquest-room
was a cosmopolitan one. Prominent
officials, whom duty "called -to the pro
ceedings, sat beside courtroom loung
ers, while distinguished medical men
elbowed with bellboys and maids from
the Palace Hotel, summoned as wit
nesses.
MRS. COIT NOT PRESENT.
A touch of society and fashion was
given to the gathering by the presence
of some women who reside at, the Pal
ace Hotel. The curiosity seekers who
expected to listen to the testimony of
Mrs. Lillian HitchcocK-Coit and watch
her demeanor on the witness stand were
disappointed, as. she was -not called as
a witness and the Jury heard her testi
mony, taken on Monday in the form of
a deposition by the? Coroner, read by
the official stenographer.
Mrs.. J. W. McClung, the* widow of
the man whose life was so ruthlessly
takeh by Alexander Garnett, arrived at
the Coroner's office, attended by. a male
relative. She was garbed in complete
mourning and she was allowed to wait
in Coroner Leland's private office until
â¢ The official stenographer of Coroner
Leland then read the deposition of Mrs:
Colt to the jury, the same having been
published at length in The Call yester
day. The jury listened to the evidence
of the solitary .eye-witness of the kill
ing of Major McClung by Alexander
Garnett, and the accused man paid
careful attention to the recital of the*
tragic % events . that have placed him
within' the meshes of the law.
.Following the reading of Mrs. 'Colt's
deposition testimony was given by Mrs.
Dr. \Vhitney, a friend of Mrs. Colt, who
resides' at the Palace Hotel. Mrs. "Whit
ney being sworn testified as follows:".
. "It was last Wednesday, about 5
p. m!, that 1 was In my rooms at the Pal
ace Hotel when I heard a loud knock
ing at my door. I opened the door -and
caw Alexander Garnett there. He was
greatly excited. He asked for my hus
band, Dr. Whitney, and requested me
to go to Mrs. Colt's rooms, as Major
McClung had^been shot there. My hus
band was not In, and I went with Gar
nett. to Mrs-. Colt's rooms. I found Mrs.
Colt there, and Major McClung was
lying on the lounge. There' was blood
on. his shirt front. Mrs. Colt said that
no'doctor had arrived. I saw that Ma
jor McClung required immediate atten
tion) Vantf I went to the rooms of Dr.
Shiels. My rooms are close to those of
Mrs. . Colt.' I cannot recall if. Garnett
said anything to me. while I went with
him "from my rooms to those of Mrs,.
Colt. . , â¢â¢ - . . :'.'
DID NOT EXPLAIN SHOOTING.
''When I went into. Mrs. Colt's rooms
Garnett asked for his overcoat, and
Mrs. "Colt said that, it should be given
to 'him. The maid, Nora, was in the
room also when I arrived there. I can
not remember where the overcoat was
in the. room. I think Mrs. .Colt handed
the coat to Garnett, but I am not sure.
When ; I came back . with Dr. Shiels I
did not go into the room- with him.' I
waited in the hallway. while he went In
to* examine Major McClung.
Â¦H "I did not hear Major McClung
anything as to how he had been shot.
All I heard him say was, 'Get a doctor.'

MAJOU McCLUNG'S SLAYER -AND WITNESSES AT THE INQUEST.
BERLIN, De<vl.â The . alarm, over
Emperor William's critical condition
was' intensified to-day by a semi-official
announcement* that on account of. the
condition of his throat he wiil not be
present at the opening of the Reichstag
on Thursday. The announcement was
made in the Neue Politische Cprre
spondehz, which journal frequently has
been a source of. ministerial, announce
ments. That journal states that Chan
cellor von Bulow will act in the J2m
peror's stead. . '. ',-'':".
-The statement that fhe Emptror will
not- even be present on that occasion,
which he has never before missed since
he ascended the throne, even though
the condition of .his throat might not
permit him' to read his address, Is re
garded as significant of a graver con-'
dition of -health than any one having
official knowledge of his case has ever
admitted. .
â¢ In official circles it is suggested that
the Emperor may merely desire to
avoid the painful impression which
the public would gain from Seeing
him a semt-invalld instead of the
martial and strenuous figure to which
they are accustomed. Tiae general
irrvpression, however,- is that Emperor
William is actually so weak and ill
that it is a physical impossibility for
him to leave the confinement of the
palace at Pottsdam, where no bulle
tins have been issued for several days.
This impression Is heightened by
the fact that when, on Sunday, the
Emperor received Baron von Stern
burg, the German Embassador to the
United States, he* waÂ» unable to de
liver to him a verbal message. His
condition was such that -be was un
abfe to carry on any conversation
with the Embassador.

The Emperor of Korea is much agi
tated over the situation in his country
and Is denying himself to all foreigners,
evidently fearing that thef Russian and
Japanese representatives In Seoul will
ask for an audience and present fresh

was illustrated when the aOmiral of the
French squadron, which put in at Cho
mulpo, proceeded to Seoul, where thÂ»
French Minister asked for an audience
for the naval representative. The Em
peror declined to gTant this request.

Special Dispatch to The Call
PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 1.-4A scandal
has developed in the Portland post
office. Though Postmaster F. A. Ban
croft, has been in office barely nine
months an alleged irregularity, has
come to, light.
Three postal inspectors arp engaged
In an Investigation. They discovered at
the outset that between $800: and $1000
had bet-n withdrawn from ! the cash
drawer, and in its place was jnerely an
"'I O U." The shortage was made
good.- but not in time to prevent the
investigation."
According to the gossip afloat about
the postomce the scandal may result In
the removal or resignation of high of
ficials. Under instructions from G. D.
Linn, who Is the inspector in'chargeof
this district, the investigation now in
progress was commenced on Monday of
â¢last week by the two local inspectors,
O. C. Riches and A. R. Butler.; They had
not proceeded far when the> discovered
the "I O U" which had been placed
in the cash drawer in lieu of money.
This was reported to Chief; Inspector
Linn, and It was deemed of such im-.
portance that Inspector C. L. "Wayland
of Seattle was sent to "Portland to aid
in the investigation.

Â¦â¢ District Attorney Byington : "Was
anything said while you were in the
rooms of' Mrs. 'Coit as to notifying, the
police of the shooting?"
The witness: "No, we were busy
in attending to the wourtded man.'' "
Dr. . George F. Shiels was then
sworn and he testified that he was
called by Mrs. Whitney to go to Mrs.
Coil's rooms last Wednesday evening,
as Major â¢ McClung had â¢ been shot
while visiting Mrs- Coit's apartments.
"Mrs. Whitney came to me," testified
Dr. Shiels,' "and asked me to'go' quickly
with her to Mrs. Coit's rooms. My
room" Is on the -same floor and I went
at once with Mrs. Whitney. Mrs. Colt
met. us in. the hallway leading- to her
apartments^ We went into the sitting
room and I found Dr. Martin there and
Major McClung, who was lying on the
lounge. I examined McClung and 'saw
at once that he was fatally wounded.
McClung was an old friend and he
asked me to take care of him.
The witness then told of- the arriv
al in Mrs. Coit's rooms of Mrs. Mc-
Clung, who had* been telephoned for
by Dr. Shiels, and the removal of the
wounded man to the ambulance that
had been summoned. ;>-"/'Â¦
"Dr. Shiels said to McClung," con
tinued Dr. Martin: " 'Did .Garnett try
to shoot you?' McClung replied, 'Oh,
no.' Dr. Shiels then asked the wound
ed man if Garnett had intended to kill
Mrs. Coit and McClung replied 'Yes.' "
Dr. Martin then testified that Dr.
Shiela had informed McClung that he
was. fatally wounded and that he
would "die and of McClungr's version of
the shooting as given above.
:â¢ DYING MAN SPEAKS.
Dr. Martin then testified to seeing
a large caliber revolver lying on the
table in the room and of Mrs. Coit
leaving him alone with McClung. This
was at the time that Mrs. Coit went
out to seek another physician.
"When Dr. Shiels came in," con
tinued Dr. Martin In his evidence, "he
introduced .himself to me and I did
the same to him. After Dr. Shiels
had examined McClung he left ' the
room to telephone for an ambulance
in order to remove the. patient to the
hospital. While Dr. Shiels was. away
the pulse of the wounded man fell
rapidly and he. commenced to sink. I
could not leave the wounded man and
w'hen Dr. Shiels returned I told him
of the condition of McClung. We got
a mattress and made McClung as
comfortable as possible."
"The wounded man asked me to
help him and after making a cursory
examination of his wound I saw that
another physician was needed and I
so informed McClung. and Mrs. Colt."
"I told the girl." -said Dr. Martin,
"Jhat I did not attend surgical cases,
but that I would go to the rooms and
see the man. I went to Mrs. Coit's
rooms and met her at the door. She
took me into the room and I saw a
man lying on the lounge. Mrs. Colt
said 'That is the man; it was^purely
accidental, it was purely accidental.'
I did not know the identity at that
time of Mrs. Coit or Major McClung.
' SAW 'LARGE REVOLVER.
A juror: "Did you know that Garnett
had shot McClung when the former
called at your rooms and you accompa
nied him back to Mrs. Coit's rooms?"
Mrs. Whitney: "It was my impres
sion that Garnett had shot McClung: I
do not remember if Garnett said 'I have
shot Major McClung 1 or 'Major Mc-
Clung is shot.' My impression was that
Garnett shot him from his excited con
dition when he called at my rooms."
Dr. George H. Martin was the next
witness. .He testified that he resided
at the Palace Hotel and that he was
called to go to Mrs. Coit's rooms last
Wednesday afternoon by a maid of the
hotel, to see a man. who had been
shot.
as to how : the shooting had taken
place."

: v * Commission.
. Mrg. McClung, the widow of the mur
dered man, was then called into the in
quest room from the private office of
Coroner Leland. She was â¢ garbed In
black and wore a* heavy veil that
shrouded her'face.
. Coroner 'Leland asked Mrs.- McClung
if she knew of anything that might be
of value in the inquisition, but she re-,
plied that her husband had not told
her any* details of the shooting ' and
that she knew absolutely nothing about
the tragedy that might enlighten the
Jury. Coroner Leland therefore did not
call Mrs. McClung to the witness stand.
Louis H. Ward, assistant warrant
Nora Nenealy, a maid at the Palace
Hotel", was then called to the Witness
stand. She testified that she had vis
ited Mrs. Cqit's rooms last Wednesday
afternoon shortly after 5 o'clock, and
Mrs. Colt met her at the door and asked
her to go for a doctor, as Major Mc-
Clung had been shot.. The girl testified
to calling Dr. Martin and accompany
ing him back to Mrs. Coit's rooms.
The witness testified to seeing Major
McClutig lyin^ ih v a chair In the room,
and. of seeing Dr. Shiels and Mrs.
Whitney enter the apartments. -"I did
not hear Major McClung say anything
about the shooting," continued the wit
ness. "All ft heard him say was that he
and GarR<p.t*h&& always been friends:"
The witness stated that she did> not
see either GaVnett or McClung- enter thiÂ»
rooms of Mrs. Coit, but she had heard
loud talking in the apartments just
previous to "Mrs. Coit rushing out and
asking the witness to get a doctor.
The witness did not see Garnett with a
revolver In his hand at any time, as
she arrived at the rooms of Mrs. Coit
after. Garnett had thrown his pistol at
the feet of Mrs. Colt in the hallway.
MRS. McCLUNG. IS CALLED.
of Major McClung. As I was. return-*
Ing to the rooms Dr. Martin met me at
the door and informed me that Major
McClung was failing fast. I then told
Major McClung that he was fatally
wounded and that he would die. It
was then he asked me to send for his
wife.
"He eald: 'If I am going to die, I
want my wife here.'
"I asked McClung to tell me how he
had been shot and he said he was call
ing on Mrs. Colt, when Alexander Gar
nett came in. -McClung said: 'I heard
Garnett threaten Mrs. Coit and I told
him to go away.' "
Dr. Shiels then testified to the state
ment of Major- McClung as to how he
had been shot by Alexander Garnett.
Dr. Shiels next told, of the removal of
Major McClung to the Waldeck Sana
torium and the examination he made
there of the wounded man. The physi
cian described the gradual failing of
the patient and the loss of vitality that
resulted in* death.
TELLS DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
. "When I saw that Major McClung
was falling," continued Dr. Shiels, "I
at once notified the "District Attorney's
office. An attache of that office came'
out to the Walde,ck and saw me I and
said he desired to take an ante-mortem
statement. â¢ ' .
'â¢'I was asked by this attache if it
would be wise to inform Major Mc-
Clung that his dying statement was de
sired. I felt that as I had informed
Major McClung that he could not live
when I first saw him and that he had
made a statement to me at that time,
it would jeopardize the, slight chance
of his recovering 'to again shock
him by telling him that death was
near. I felt that there was a slight
hope of . recovery and that is why I
did not again inform Major McClung
that he was likely to die when the at
tache of the District Attorney's office
came to take his statement."
Dr. Shiels then told of the death of
Major McClung, the autopsy and the
burial of the body, at which the physi
cian was present.
Dr. Shiela also identified the revolver
with which McClung was shot by Alex
ander Garnett. Dr. Shfels, as_ a mat
ter of precaution, had taken it from the
table when he was called to Mrs. Colt's
rooms and later oh turned the weapon
over to the -police.
NORA KENEALY TESTIFIES.
The jury then retired to deliberate
upon a verdict, fend after passing on
the testimony presented returned a ver
dict of . willful murder against Alex
ander Garnett in the following terms: *
-"That the said J. W. McClung, age 56
years, nativity Alebama, occupation re
tired, broker, residence 857 Post street,
in the city and "county of San Fran

and that said shot was fired from a pis
tol in the 'hands of Alexander Garnett

Alexander Garnett was arraigned yes

Major McClung. Ow^ng to the wit
nesses in the case being required to tes
tify in the Coroner's inquest the case
went over until to-morrow afternoon at

Detective E. Byram testified to. tak
ing the statement of Mrs. Coit on the
evening of the shooting of Major Mc-
Clung, which statement has. been pub
lished In full In The Call. " : â¢
Detective T. L, Ryan testified to ar
resting Alexander Garnett -in Oakland
on the night of Thursday last and of
the statement made by the arrested
man' on the boat coming to this city.
This statement o"f Garnett was to the
effect that Major McClung Jiad tried
to eject him from Mrs. Colt's rooms
arid that he (Garnett) had drawn bis
pistol to defend -himself and that the
weapon was exploded in the struggle
with McClune.
Dr. Bacigalupi, autopsy surgeon to
the Coroner, testified to holding an au
topsy on the body of Major McClung
and described the nature of {he wound
that caused death. He told of finding
that a heavy caliber bullet had., en-,
tered the front of the body Just below
the breastbone and lodged in the back
near the ninth intercostal space after
perfora'ting the right lobe of the liver.

"My name Is J. W. McClung. My
residence is at S57 Post street, in, this
city. Last night about 5 o'clock I was
going out from a call, when Mr; A. G.
Garnett came in. He (Garnett) was
asked to go away by Mrs- Lillian Coit.
He pulled, a pistol and said he was go
ing to kill her. I' told him to go away,
and he said, 'Gâ dâ you. I'll kill you.'
Then he shot me once. He was wildly
drunk. I was simply making a call.

to die.
-"I then explained," said the witness,
"to .Major McClung the object of the

Zion City was formally opened on
July 14, 1901, 'when Dowle took up his
headquarters there in an old f/rrmhouse,
after "making a speech of 'consecration.'
Artisans were hurried to the place and
the constructkm of buildings and
Btreftts began. A year later the town
had a population of 2000 persons, and at
"the present time the population is esti
mated At about 10,000.
The lace factories were opened more
than a year ago; an immense hotel, an
auditorium and administration build
ings constructed, brick, 'candy a"nd
woodworking plants were established,
and at- the present time an Imposing
building of stone for the Zion College

It was decided by "the receivers that

ZION CITY'S RAPID GROWTH.
. As, the congregation grew he- re
christened his organization the -"Chrisr
tian CatholiG Churcb of. ZiQti," and
three, years ago leased the Auditorium, 5
in wh'icb to- hold his Sunday gatherings.
All this -time he "kept up his divine heal*
ing" and . many of- thofee who- canie to
â¢him to be healed became his stanchest
supporters in the church.
â¢; It was -shortly after he began, the
services .in the Auditorium that he an
nounced that he was "the successor of
Elijah, -the prophet pf .God, and that
his teachings and actions .were inspired.
Four .years ago Dowie began nego
tiations .for the .-purchase of the land
north of "Waukegan, on which Zion City
ndw stands. Having -procured options
o'n a. tract "of 6400 acres he platted It.
Eighty acres were set aside for the lace
factories, oh'.which the industrial hopes
of Zion. City were . founded. Samuel
Stevenson went to Nottingham, Eng
land, and ordered and' naid deposits on
one, hundred lace making machines,
which, with the accessories, when laid
down in Chicago, cost almost $1,000,000.
â¢Outgrowing "these quarters in a few
years, he leased a tabernacle at Michi
gan avenue a'nd Thirteenth street",
paying for it an. immense rental. Fof
several ; years the services were held
Â¦there. :â¢ â¢- Â¦-":Â¦''.'-
Early in the week before' last Dowie
made a personal trip through the va
rious shops. It has been cu&tomary at
Zion City to start each day's work In
the shop with fifteen minutes devoted
to prayer services. On the day in
Question, it is said, Dowie went to each
of the 6hops and talked for more than
Â¦two hours to the employes. He told
his followers and others that they
must either wait for their salaries or
must endure a substantial cut in
wages. They agreed to wait. In one
shop a non-rmember of Dowie's flock
asked Dowie why he was going to
Australia, if his finances were so bad.
"Perhaps I may not toe able to go at
all," quietly returned Dowie. "I may
have to stay and see that things are
set right before I leave." ., ; :
The receivers, with 0 their attorneys,
and Custodian Redieske, with six
deputy marshals, went to Zion City to
night to. serve c upon Dowie' the notice
of the receivership. Redieske and his
deputies went to the bank, while the
others called upon Dowie at his resi
dence. As the officers were about to
demand admission to the bank, a man
r.an from a rear door. One of -the depu
ties overtook .him and a second man
came running from the bank, shout
ing: â¢ â¢ - __
' "Let' me have those papers; I will
get away with. them."
Redieske threatened " to place them
under arrest ;unless th/ey returned at
once to the bank, .which they did. He
then-placed the bank and men ln.it
under a guard. .:
While .this was taking, place, at* the
bank the receivers and their attpf neya
called upon Dowie and .read to him. the
ruling of- the" court, which placed Zion
City in the hands pf a. receiver. After
hearing it, EJowie locked, himself up
with .several of his- leading subordi
nates. He refused to allow himself to
be seen ' or to make any statement,
merely sending out word that he had
nothing to say. The order of the court

$500,000 without delay. This sum, he
said, he- was willing to take in short
loans, but they must be forthcoming
immediately. c In the effort to remedy
the conditions of affairs at Zion City
hundreds of letters were sent out daily
to Dowie's followers in other parts of
the country. In these letters, in which
glowing prospects of Zion City's future
were painted and in v?hich Dowle him
self is quoted us praying that all those
who believe in him would "follow the
Lord," all Dowieites are urgedâ almost
commanded â to sell their farms, stores
and everything else and come at once
to Zion City and take up the work of
the church. All of those who have
money in. banks were asked to draw
that money out of the local banks and
send It for deposit at Zion City.
It Is declared to be a fact that the
employes of the manufacturing indus
tries have not been paid in from four
to six weeks. What little they have
received is said "to have been paid en

ker, whose flagship is the Kearsarge,

Williams said that Under the guise
of a '"saored duty" â¢ to stand pat the
opposition was ! supplying a shelter
whereby the trusts could extort from
the American people, while selling to
the foreigner cheaper than the foreign
er could manufacture. { '
Hepburn of Iowa,- replying to the
statements made by Williams, quoted
figures and declared that the country
never was in better condition and that
this was due to the Republican policy
of protection. He asked if the condi
tion of the laboring man in the United
States then- was better than now!
"Yes,, yes!" came" from the Demo
cratic aide, whereupon Hepburn â¢ de
clared it never was better than to-day.
He' said tie finances of . the country
never were better. The Democrats
should be ashamed to talk as they did.
in view of the splendid conditions
which now existed under the Repub
lican policy of protection.
Replying .to Williams' charge that a
shelter was given the trust,- Hep
burn gave figures in connection with
the steel and iron industry, comparing
prevailing prices with those of the past
and saying that the Republican policy
had brought about the good conditions
cited. He said he could see why the
farmers of Iowa and Kansas spurned

from Mississippi that the Democrats
were their friends.
GROSVENOR SCORES SENATE.
Grosvenor of Ohio, the. last speaker,
replied to the charges of dereliction
made -by the Democrats, v saying that
he "believed the House stood higher ' in
Â¦the estimation of the people than'ever.
Speaking of the action of the Senate
In* connection with' the Cuban bill,
Grosvenor said the Senate reported the
bill back, and it was assumed that the
Senate wanted to stay, here for^ some
purpose, so it did not offer any resolu
tion to adjourn..
"It would have been almost an Insult
for the House to have offered one," he
said. "What right had we to assume
that the Senate of the United States
would stopâ would balkâ and refuse to
go on? They never had done such -a
thing before, and they have not done
so now. .There is some wiseâ it may be
inscrutable â reason,- but it is a wise
one, for it comes from the greatest par
liamentary body on earth, arid greater
than any in heaven. So. now are we
waiting for what? For the Senate to
say to us- that they are through with
that bill for the present and want to
adjourn. ! We cannot slap the Senate,
in the face by adopting a resolution
that we want to adjourn. They are un
der the same call that we are, and have
not done what we have doneâdis
charged our duty. I assume that they,
are waiting to consider more fully the
character of that legislation. They
know but little about it. It Just came
from the House; they did not have it
but a . few days. It is â¢ true that, un
officially, we know that they balked on
the whole business and will be ready
at some future time â no doubt some
time during the present* weekâ to. pass
that bill unless they send us word that
they want to adjourn."

part of the time of to-day's executive

a discussion of the scope and charac

the time of taking a vote on the Cuban

the discussion that the Democrats had
understood Senator Aldrich to say the
Cuban bill was to be the only matter
considered. Senator Teller stated that
an agreement had been made with
Senator Aldrich and that the Demo

"Couldn't -tell : within $4000 or $5000
what my trial here, cost me," he said.
"I raised every cent I. could In every
way and. spent it. I borrowed every
cent I could and then Corry Bissell
Went, around the /Aldermen and col
lected money from all of them to help
.my defense. . Bissell said Muir con
tributed. ,1 have ' forgotten whether
the amount .was' $10 or $25.'.'
The. Prosecuting' Attorney refused, to
give any definite information as to how
many 'warrants will be issued in the
next , batch or how far he will : go in
prosecuting those whom ' Salsbury im-
â¢ "Muir had already taken a stand fa
vorable to the Barley. Springs plan and
it would be hard to get him to switch
and explain his action," said- Salsbury.
"We gave him the larger inducement
because of his position. Muir never took
any positive action in favor of the Lake
Michigan deal until after he was prom
ised the $5000 In bdnds.. We had plenty
of money in sight to reward eur friends,
and if the Lake Michigan deal had gone
three days longer, we would all have
been millionaires."
. Salsbury was given a severe exam-,
inatlon by Attorney Smedley, wTio tried
to pin him down to details, in regard to
some, pf which | Salsbury. was in doubt.
He could not tell the date'upon which
he paid Depagler nor could he tell cer
tainly whether he promised Depagler
$3000 or $5000 worth of bonds. He said
â¢that some of the Aldermen were prom
ised the first amount and some the
latter. :
â¢ Salsbury testified that he intended to
bleed all the outside parties, and then
go before' the Common Council, ex
pose them and keep the money. ' Muir's
attorney then sought to show! that
Salsbury ;could not have paid out the
'amount to - .the Aldermen that he
claims, because of his heavy personal
expenses, but Salsbury repeated that
their figures were" wrong. .He was un
able to state his expenses at the time
of his arrest in Chicago, nor during his
trial here. He said he kept no cash" ac
count, 1 but that he did keep a j memo
randum of the amounts whjch he paid
the various Aldermen. 1
HAD PIJENTY OF MONEY.
Ex- Alderman Mulr's examination fol
lowed. Salsburjf swore that it was at
first understood that Muir, who was
known as "Honest John," was to re
ceive $1000 in cash and later it was
agreed that he was to have $5000 in
bonds.
Salsbury's testimony In the case of
Alderman Depagler and ex-Aldermen
MuiÂ£ and McCool was completed at
the morning session, but the case
against Alderman Ellen pf the First
Ward occupied the attention of Judge
Haggerty all the afternoon and Sals
bury's cross-examination was not com
pleted when court adjourned. The di
rect examination was brief in. each
case, it being confined by Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney Ward to the
payment of money by Salsbury to the
Aldermen for their votes and Influence
in carrying the water deal through the
Council.
It was reported to-night that ex-Al
derman Donovan, Aldermen Mol, John
son, Stonehouse, Slocum, McLachlin
and Lozier, and Correy.P. Bissell, ex
members of the Board of Public Works,
who are now under arrest, will go into
court to-morrow and waive examina
tion. In this case they will be held to
the present term of the Superior Court
for trial. This will conclude the pre
liminary examination of the men al
ready arrested through Salsbury's con
fession.
. Salsbury was the first witness called
this morning. He testified that he
gave Alderman Depagler $350 at about
the same time that he did the others
he bribed; the currency being deliv
ered in Salsbury's office of the City
Hall.
BUYS AXDEBMANIC SUPPORT.
"I told him that he could have $1000
ultimately," said Salsbury, ,,'Jand I ex
plained how 'I wanted him \o support
our proposition. He agfeed.rand later,
we entered Into an agreement by.which
he was to receive from $3000 to>$5000 in
water bonds."
Salsbury said that he niade Depagler
a heavier offer than was at first con
templated because things, had come to
such a pass in' the Common Council that
in order to stand by the deal a man had
to have a little more courage, and he
wanted Depagler to stiffen up. All of
the Aldermen were paid separately ex
cept in the case of ex-Alderman Kln
ney, Salsbury testified, and he thought
Corry P. Bissell was present when that
payment was made. Then Attorney
Smedley took up Salsbury's confession.
He made Salsbury acknowledge that he
had told the story not only before the
prosecutor, but also before Judge ISTew
ham, who will be the trial Judge unless
a change df venue is obtained. He said
he hoped to be treated leniently.
Depagler's case was then adjourned
until next Monday.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Dec. 1.â
Although the features of the examina
tion of ex-City Attorney Lank K. Sals
bury in the water boodle case in -the
Police Court to-day were lacking in
sensation to compare with yesterday's
startlfng , revelations, his" testimony
was Intensely interesting because of
voluntary statements made by the wit
ness while under cross-examination.
â¢His testimony involved no "new names.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1..â Some dls
pussion has been indulged in by
Senators concerning the effect of an
adjournment without action on
the nomination- of General Leon
ard Wood to be major general
and' other ; nominations depending
upon his confirmation, and widely dif
fering views have been expressed. Ac
cording to the standing rules â¢ of the
Senate it. will be necessary, in the event
these nominations are* not confirmed at
the present session, for the President to
send them again to the Senate. The
rule follows:
"Nominations neither confirmed nor
rejected during the session at which
,they are made shall not be acted upon
at any succeeding session without 'being
made again to the Senate by the Presi
dent, and if the Senate shall adjourn or
take a recess of more than thirty days
all nominations pending and not finally
acted upon at the time of taking such
adjournment or recess shall be returned
by the Secretary to the President and
will not be again considered unless they
shall again be made to the Senate by
the President.
Some question has arisen as to the
effect if no adjournment occurs, but the
â¢impression is that the pending nomina
tion's will have to be made anew. ' V
Defense Fails to Weaken His
Story by R ; gid Crosa- ,
Examination.
Professor Bowne Is widely known as
a writer on philosophy and his recent
statements concerning the Bible and
religious subjects have attracted much
attention. Rev. Mr. Cooke Is the author
of a pamphlet, issued several months
ago and circulated throughout the
Methodist church, which criticizes Pro
fessor Bowne's teachings.
The first specification against Pro
fessor Bowne is that the philosopher's
views concerning the Deity are con
trary to the plain teachings of the
Scriptures; the second, that his views
of the inspiration and authority of the
Holy Scriptures are also contrary to
those Scriptures; third, that hH notion
of the atonement is contrary, not only
to the Scriptures, but also to the ritual
of the Lord's su l pv>er in the- discipline
of the church. â¢ v '
The fourth charge refers to his teach
ing of eschatology, which, It is declared.
Is directly contrary to the Scriptures
and the Methodist standards of. faith.
The last statement is tbat Professor
Bowne disseminates views of Christian
experience "contrary to the plain teach
ing of the Holy Scriptures and contrary
to the established doctrines of the
Methodist Episcopal church. 1 '
BOSTON, Dec. I.â Papers have been
served upon Professor -Borden D.
Bowne *of Boston -University, calling
him to trial before the ecclesiastical
court of the Methodist Episcopal church
to answer the charge of heresy.
Rev. George W. Cooke, pastor of
Trinity. Methodist' Church. West Med-.
ford, and a member of the New Eng
land Conference, is the formal accuser
of Professor B.owne. The specifications,
five in number, are based upon the gen
eral allegation that the professor has
disseminated "doctrines which are con
trary to the articles of religion or es
tablished standards of doctrines in the
Methodist Episcopal church."

BERLIN, Dec 1.â Artists of the im
pressionist school in Berlin, Munich.
Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Karlsruhe and
Weimar have sent an answer to the
letter addressed to them by the Gen
eral Association of German Art Socle
ties at Dresden, refusing to come, to
terms relative to exhibiting at the St.
Louis Exposition. The impressionists
had decided not to exhibit at the St.
Louis Exposition, and the letter of the
general association called upon them
to reconsider their refusal to send
pictures. In their reply to the letter
the Impressionist branches of the asso
ciation say:
"We cannot subject ourselves to the
decision of a central Jury whose artistic
competency we dispute, and we protest
against the claim that the exhibit will
present a mirror of German art. We
demand that the German secessionists
be accorded the portion belonging to
them in view of their achievements.
Then we ylll send our best and -do
everythingfthat can be done by German
art to come out with honors in compe
tition with the nations.' 1
The secessionists are organizations of
artists of impressionist schools.

as having been stolen at that time a

identified a pair of lipk gold cuff but

from their residence. But not a trace

"The day of the shooting I went out
hunting with Goldstein," said Stead
man, "returning during- the after
noonl About 6 o'clock that evening,
while I. was standing on the back porch
talking to Maury Miller, Goldstein and
Kiniry went out with their bicycles.' I
left some time afterward and went
downtown, where I heard about the
shooting. I followed the ' crowd . to
Fourteenth and Oak streets, where I
saw the body and noticed the colored
sweater. It looked like the same
sweater that Goldstein wore when he
was -hunting/ I went home at once and
looked in Goldstein's room to see If hid
sweater was there. It was gone, and
I was sure the man was Goldstein."
Here jurors pressed the boy to know
whether he- had examined- the body
closely and he replied he had only seen
the top of the head.
.' Steadman gave varying, reasons for
his sudden departure for home, leaving
a strong impression that some motive
stronger .than he was "willing to ex
plain prompted his sudden departure
from the scene of the murder.
Continuing his story to the jury
Steadman said: "I found the note on
the dining T room table that I gave to
the police and as soon as I was satis
fied that Goldstein was the -man I went
to Chief Hodgkins.-" .
Replying to questions, Steadman said
that when he returned home both the
front door and back door were" locked.
It is a fact that thp police found the
back door} open when they* arrived.
This points, â¢ according to the Coroner's
theory, to the belief that Kiniry was
In' the house when the boy returned
from the scene of the murder, and that
he fled after the boy left the house the
second time." This theory appealed so
strongly- to the jury that one -juror
asked:
"Did you go to Kiniry's room?"
"No, sir," replied Steadman.
"Was Kiriiry in the room?"
"I don't know. 1 V^dldh't hear any
noise there," said Steadman. .:'.';
Other witnesses examined were Cap-,
tain 'If Police W. J. Petersen, Reeves
Baker,' Dwight L. Strong, Eugene Van
Court and Dr. O. D. Hamlln. The
jury's verdict was as follows:
Steadman, at the outset told about
the arrival, on November 16, at hl3
home of Kiniry and Goldstein, who
rented separate rooms. They had kept
good hours, coming and going, regu
larly.
. It was the belief of the Coroner's of
ficials that Steadman had been cau
tioned by some one to refrain from giv
ing certain evidence. For what pur
pose concealment was desired has not
been explained. A reason ' advanced
was the theory that Steadman had met
Kiniry at. the house after the crime
had been committed, and was unwilling:
to make that fact public. Coroner
Mehrmann has ordered Steadman to
appear to-morrow evening at the in
quest in the case of Goldstein. ' .

David Kiniry was accused by a Cor
oner's jury to-night of the murder of
Patrolman James H. Smith. Chief
among the witnesses called at the In
quest by Coroner Mehrmann was
young Steadman. He was subjected' to
a rapid-fire cross examination by the
jurors, who declared their belief that
they were not satisfied that the young
man had told all he knew concerning

work on Hodgkins' -part that the Grove
sfreet residence was uncovered. It was
not superior, intelligent digging of a
master mind in criminal trailing that
gave the knowledge to Hodgkins. It
was the quick-witted 'a'ctlon of young
Ross Steadman that opened the way
which, unfortunately, was blocked be
cause Chief ot Police Hodgkins was
not quick enough to. head off the man
that he charges with shooting to death
one of the bravest young policemen
thut ever stood between criminals and
citizens' lives and property.
Steadman. heard of the shooting with
in a very few minutes after it occurred.
He heard that the dead Goldstein wore
a peculiar sweater. - Something prompt
ed him to hasten to the Morgue. There
he identified the body, but held his own
counsel until he could get the ear. of
the Chief of Police.. Steadman realized
how essentially important was his in
formation. Then was the time for ac
tion. Then was the .moment when
Hodgkins might have saved himself
from being forced to acknowledge an
ignominious failure and defeat in this
lame pursuit of David Kiniry.
And in the face of this situation po
licemen keenly interested In the hunt,
doubly concerned because a fellow of
ficer had been slain, were compelled -to
go to the public sources of information
â the press â hours afterward foe this
all-essential clew. There the four days'
record stands. 1 Saturday, Sunda-y, Mon
day and Tuesday have come and gone,
yet Chief of Police Hodgkins has not^
strengthened his position in the cam-*
paigm in one single particular. The best
that he has accomplished Is to trace
Kiniry's antecedents' to some extent,
and this was accomplished by means
of documents that fell into the police
hands -as manna from heav.en. . .

His detectives have been compelled
to work in the dark in no slight de
gree because of the astounding meth
ods that prevail in the handling of
criminal cases by Oakland's police
Chief. -It is a fact that at least one
of the police â¢ detectives assigned by
Chief of Police St. Clair Hodgkths to
duty on the Smith case was not in
formed by that .official of Â¦ the resi

Kiniry, although Hodgkins had that
information in his possession less than
two hours after Smith had been mur
dered. . Â¦ Â¦
Essential as it was that the police
should be apprised with all possible
diligence of the fact that the men
had a hiding place in this city, Hodg
kins, for some unaccountable reason,
not only withheld this important fact
from nearly every patrolman in the
department, but included in his list a
detective officer who was supposed to
be exerting efforts to catch the fugi
tive murderer.

flight, had ample time to elude pur
suers, get to the Steadman house at
1362 Grove street, write a letter to
Goldstein- and then easily make~hls

articles as he could carry away, is no

rects attention to the expenditures of
the Isthmian Canal Commission up to
the date of its final report to the Pres
ident, as' stated In a report from the

The second resolution introduced by
Senator Morgan provides for reference
to' the Committee on Inter-oceanic
Canals of the plans for government of
the canal, adopted by the Inter-oceanlc
Canal" Commission, and for a review of
the accounts and plans of' the commis

between the pla-ns for a canal sub
mitted in reference to both the Pana
ma, and Nicaragua routes.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1.â Senator
Morgan to-day introduced resolutions
authorizing the Committee of Inter
oceanic Canals to investigate the part
alleged to have been taken by the
trans-continental railroads in the isth
mian canal affair, and also to inquire
into the plans of the Inter-ocean canal
commission.
The preamble to Senator Morgan's
first resolution called attention to as
sertions in public journals, "represent
ing public opinion and exercising lead
ing influences In the great political
parties of the United States," that
trans-continental railroad companies
have opposed the public policy of the
United States in respect to the ratifi
cation of the Hay-Herran treaty. It
declared that the railroads are ob
structing the full and complete execu
tion of the duty and the policy of the
United States, as declared by act of
Congress as approved June 28, 1902,
providing for the construction of a
canal connecting the waters of the At
lantic and Pacific oceans.
The resolution provides that the
Committee on Pacific Railroads is em
powered and authorized to make care
ful inquiry into the facts on which
such charges are made and report the
testimony and the findings of the com
mittee to the Senate.

SAN JOSE, Dec. 1.â Strenuous ef
forts are being made by some un
known corporation or persons to block
the San Jose and Alvlso Electrio Rail
way 1q securing a right of way into
this city. The general impression
around the city Is that the Southern
Pacific is back of the move. V. A.
Scheller, attorney for Mehllng & Lock
wood, the promoters of the Alviso line,
i made such a statement at the meeting
of the City Council this afternoon.
When the sale . of a. franchise on
; First street from the northern city
limits to Taylor street, thence up Tay
lor to Second, and along Second to St.
James and down the latter to Market,
came up yesterday, E. D. Crawford of
Gilroy ran the price up to $6127. This
franchise would give the Alviso line an
entrance to the heart of the city.
Crawford* deposited 10 per cent, of the
sum, and. when the Council met to-day
to ratify the sale he refused to pay
the balance. Crawford demanded the
sale of the franchise to him at $110,
the first amount bid, and'the return of
the balance of his'deposit. . ' . -.
The Council .denied this request and
ordered the sale rescinded and the de
posit forfeited. Bids if ere then" called
for the sale of the franchise again.
Mehllng bid $100 and Crawford raised
this 10 per cent. Bidding continued
till. the franchise ran up to $5500, when
it went to Crawford. With each bid
Crawford deposited the money to cover
10 per cent of the Increase.
This blocks the Alvlso-San Jose rdad
for a time at least. Crawford has un
til 5 o'clock to-morrow evening to pay
the balance on the franchise. It is be
lieved he will bring suit to compel the
Council to sell him the franchise on
the first bid of $110 made yesterday on
the ground hew-as Che only one depos
iting any money. Crawford Is a law
yer of Gilroy and will not state who
he represents.
The Alviso road will now have to
sÂ«Â»ek another entrance into the city.
Mehling and Lockwood propose put
ting on a fast line of steamers between
Alviso and San Francisco and it is be
lieved the Southern Pacific is ; trying
to head off this competition.

choosing for his subject, "The Coming
Revival." . Dr. Day said that for the
last decade the air had been full' of
the talk of it. . Some had dwelt; upon
the signs of its approach, some had
suggested the measures necessary "to
hasten and intensify it and some had
attempted to define r.ts character and
scope. Changes in the social, commer
cial and political world had materially
awakened large* expectancy of like, up
heavals in.the religious .world, said Dr.
Day. â¢ â¢ â¢
Probably the- best indication : of its
approach, said .the speaker, was. the*
crying need for. it and the" widespread
desire which was sharpening itself Into
the well nigh -universal prayer of Chris-,
tendom. for its speedy coming. ,
"The Coming Revival" was the theme
which helda number of clergymen and
church women in. convention yesterday
evening at Trinity Methodist Episcopal
Church, Sixteenth and Market streets.
It was a gathering of m tbe cJersry of
different evangelistic churches and one*
of similar meetings that '-were held 'in

which were reported- fully In The Call.
The main hone was for a sturdy re

said, showed i that a r.ouslng religious
demonstration was fast approaching
and that the body religious was pre
paring for such. It' was to be "a re

Last Saturday afternoon- burglars en
tered the residence, of Antone Seaguirre
at S3 Vallejo place and made their es
cape with coin- and Jewelry to the ex
tent of $150. They entered a side win
dow while the family was absent and
left no clew.
This crime was discovered when the
proprietor of the store arrived soon
after 7 o'clock. The wire screen that
surrounds the stand had been'cut with
nippers, permitting the' thieves to get
inside and rifle the money boxes.- -
Soon after leaving the Hotel Nether
lands, the burglars visited the Native
Sons' Cigar Store on Market street, op
posite Jones, and secured a small
amount from the cash register. They
used the nippers again and cut away
the iro* protection. Last Saturday
night they visited Simmons' cigar store
on Market street, between Seventh and
Eighth, and last Wednesday night they
entered Coblentz's store at Golden Gate"
avenue and Market street and escaped
with $12 50. -â¢ â¢â¢
Several burglaries have been reported
to the police during the last few days.
The latest was at -20 Turk street early
yesterday morning. Burglars, working
under the glare of electric lights and in
the entrance of the Hotel Netherlands,
broke into a cigar stand and took $50
from the register and slot machines.
Engineer Garcia, who ran locomotive
No. SI up country on Sunday night,
testified that he presumed . his engine
struck Madona, but' that he was not
aware of it. Â¦ He passed the spot' about
7:50 Sunday night, saw no one and
heard no cries. He further stated that if
the man had .been walking when struck
the body "would have been hurled many
feet farther than it was, while the
limbs and other " portions of the body
would have borne evidences of injury.
Dr.. WIckman, "the ajitopsy surgeon,
testified only to the injuries sustained,
and would give no theory as to the
cause of death. The Jury returned a
verdict of accidental death.
â¢ Gartardo Madona was last seen alive
Sunday afternoon in Novato. At* that
time he displayed considerable money
an.d Jewelry. During the Inquest this
afternoon Joseph Gambetta, who is a
ranch hand on the Mattoni place, the
same ranch upon which Madona was
employed, testified that he last saw
Madona on Sunday. He knew he had
money and saw his watch and chain.
Gambetta remained in Novato thd.t
night, but Madona left town en route
home about 6:30 p. m. Yesterday
morning Gambetta left Novato about
6:30 for the ranch by way of the rail
road track.
When Just out of Novato, Gambetta
says, he passed a stranger coming to
ward town. The man saluted, but
passed, quickly. A short distance far
ther down the track Gambetta discov
ered his friend's dead body. He re
turned to Novato and reported it, but
before any one went to the scene the
Santa Rosa train en route to San Fran
cisco arrived and the corpse was taken
aboard. Conductor John P. Smith of
this train testified to having picked up
the body. He stated that from exam
ination of the wounds it would seem
that. the man had been lying at right
angles to the track, but when discov
ered was parallel to the rails and about
four feet from the ties.
SAN RAFAEL,. Dec. 1.â During: the
inquest over the remains of Gartardo
Madona certain factp were brought out
which tend to show tbat his death Is
not easily explained.
Madona was found dead upon the
California Northwestern Railroad
tracks near Novato yesterday morning.
His Bkull was fractured and his watch
and money were missing. The injury.
It Is believed, was due to Madona be
ing struck by an engine Sunday night,
but tbe position of the body and the
loss of the dead man'e valuables have
called forth a searching Investigation
by Sheriff Taylor and District Attorney
Boyd.
Novato has been infested by. tramps
for the past week. On Sunday two. men
appeared at the residence of Mrs. W:
Matthias on Grand avenue and forced
admittance to her home. She had to
seek help to eject them. The same
night two .men gained entrance to Cap

off.

â¢Food taken Into- the Ftomach, which,
from the nature of the food or the con-
djtlon of the etompch. Is not digested,
4s worse than no food at all. This -Is a
tf-ue statement as far as It goes and a
gi-feat many dj-Epeptlcs go only this far
Â¦with their reasoning. They argue with
themselves that because tjielr stomachs
ck> net do the work given them, they
must be- given less work; ln other
â¢words, they must be p tarved. It would
be Just as ser_sible for a business man
who is unable to- 0)0 all his own work
to cut down his business to his own ca-
pacity as it is for a man to starve
himself to relieve his stomach. The
eenEible business man employs help
end goes forward with his business.
.Likewise the sensible dyspeptic will
employ help for his stomach and give j
his body proper nourishment.
.Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
fto the work assigned to them. They re-
lieve weak and overburdened stomachs
of a great "portion of digestive action.
Their component parts are identical
â¢Â»rtth those of the digestive fluids and
eecretions of the 6tomach and they sim-
T>ly take up the grind and ' carry ' on
the work Just the same as a good,
Btrong, healthy stomach would do It.
On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia.
Tablets are perfectly natural io their
ectlon and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance in
the stomach or bowels. They them-
eelves digest the food and supply tbe
eystem with all the nourishment con-
tained In what is eaten -and carry out
.Nature's plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible is this
method than that employed by many
' eufferers from weak stomachs. By
this means body and brain get all the
pood, nutritious food they need and the
man Is properly nourished and equipped
to carry on his work and perform his
duties. He could not possibly be in
proper working condition by starving
himself or employing some new f angled,
insufficient food that does not contain
enough nutriment for a year-old baby.
'A strong man doing strong work must
be properly fed and this applies to the
brain as well as the body. . /
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, by . re-
lieving the stomach of its work, enable
It to recuperate and regain its normal
health and strength. Nature, repairs
the worn and wasted tissues just as she
heals and knits the bone of a broken
Xlmb, which is of course not used dur-
ing tbe process of repair.
Stuart's Dyspepsia.- Tablets are for
sale by. all druggists at 50 cents a box
and they are the one article that the
druggist does not try to sell something
ln the place of that's "Just as good."
Their unqualified merit and success and
the " universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every

WANTS CITY TO PAY
PREMIUMS ON BONDS
Merchants* Association Petitions the
Board of Supervisors Not to Ac
cept Personal Sureties.
The Merchants' Association yesterday
sent a communication to the Board of
Supervisors suggesting the desirability
of requiring city officials to give bonds
of surety companies and that the pre
mium thereon be paid by the city.
The association contends that it is to
son should make up a story against
Wolf. He had nothing to- gain by so
doing or testifying against' him. It
does not appear that' he had any grudge
to satisfy. His good faith Is shown
r by the fact that when he was first ap
proached he reported the matter and
acted under Instructions thereafter.
"We find the defendant guilty on all
three charges."
The case of Policeman/ Joseph E.
Bennett, who is accused of having act
ed as an asrent for Wolf, will be de
cided next Tuesday night.
Th'e receipts/ fbr the month amounted
to $4237 85. a gain of $193 25 over No
vember of 1902. . Â¦"
During the month of November there
were 2S26 papers filed in the Recorder's
office. 126 more. than In November, 1902:

â¢Albert B. Mahony's deputies are up

.he. flashed their November salaries.
Many of them refused to sign the pay
rojl in the Auditor's office yesterday/
and say they will bring suit against
Mahony for the recovery of the money
due them that. he withheld.
-*7.W. V. White, one of the deputies, yes

thjere.' ' â¢ â¢ '

get their back salaries. They were al
ready' gone In October to pay salaries
to Mahony's friends that never did any
work. The victims were led to believe
that the wily County Clerk would make
good the amounts of their October
salaries and waited. Now they . are
wroth and say that they will bring suit
to recover what they justly earned.
Colonel Martin Brady, one of Ma
hony's wards, Js never seen around the
office and was never known to do a
day's work since his appointment, yet
he has been drawing the neat sum ot
?150 every month for the last two years.
Deputy McKenna. another of the
non-working salary drawers .connected
with Mahony's office,' was never known
to show up around the office, yet he al
ways gets a fat salary.' â¢
Last month Mahony raised the salary
of "Pat" Prendergast to $150. He for
merly got $125. The salary of Danforth
was cut the necessary $25 so that Pren
dergast might be able to make a little
more easy money. *
Mahony claimed that Danforth's of
fice duties were not arduous enough to
warrant his getting his former salary
of $150. but .thought: that Prendergast's
work was so hard that he was entitled
to $25 more. :
FRIENDS DRAW SALARIES. .
Harry Hall, P. Demings and J. Pierce
were down, oh this month's roll as
deputies, although their presence has
never graced the office whjeh. now pays
them salaries which. they do not earn.
All of them are perfect strangers
around the City Hall. The two first
named drew $100 each for November
ana ihe latter.$50. Pierce and Hall also
drew $100 each In the month of October,
but in return gave the city no services.
The rollthis month, gives to every
friend of Mahony's a full salary, many
of them In excess of what the cha'rter
states they shall be. /
William A. Deane, former County
Clerk, now a deputy under Mahony,
got no money this month. He was sick
and Mahony docked himj the full
amount ot his salary. When Mahony
was a. deputy under Deane's adminis
tration he become ill -and his salary
was carried to his house by Deane.
The payroll, this month was five days
behind time, and it is stated that it
was. drawn up Monday afternoon by
Mahony and J. A. McKenna in the
r^ar room of a saloon at the corner
of Hyde and McAllister- streets. At this
meeting Mahony and McKenna ar
range'd^ the money at the disposal of
the County Clerk's 'office so that all of
their friends should get full salaries
â¢whether they Had done any work or
not. "Many of the men whose names
appear on. the November payroll It Is
claimed are merely creditors of Ma
hony whom 1 he is trying to satisfy.'
Â£>thers are political friends whom he
ow^s something for past services, and
the -city treasury is the sufferer lfr each,
case. â¢ .
Nearly all .'of Mahony's friends and
all?gpd deputies whom .he. has favored
so well do a brokerage business with
Broker J. E. McPonald, who was ap
pointed" receiver in the recent row be
tween. and J. J. McGrath in
the *>eer boltllng venture.
It 'is also "alleged that Mahony has
been guilty of hypothecating his sal
ary fr.om month to month. He did not
.draw his salary yesterday^ because
there I were a dozen of these money
brokers on "his trail waiting to seize
â¢his salary. ' f>\~
Under the provisions of the new char-"
ter the County Clerk is authorized to
appoint a register 'clerk at a salary of
5240(5 per annum, a cashier a.t a salary
of 51S00 per annum, twelve courtroom
cle.rks" for the Superior Court at $1500
each per annum, five register clerks
with a salary of $1809 per annum, ten
assistant register at $1500 a year,
sixteen copyists at $1200 a year . and
four clerks for the Police courts at $1500
per annum. '
USES ALL THE MONEY.
Under this footing Mahony has at
his disposal something in the neigh
borhood of $7000 a month. Not one cent
of this amount has ever been left In
the city treasury. If a man was docked
for any reason the amount taken from
his salary did not remain undemanded
in .the treasyry. but was distributed
gratultuously among the friends and
creditors of the County Clerk- '
Forty-nine clerks are allowed the
County Clerk to assist him in his work,
yet the pay roll for November shows
that fifty-four men are entitled, accord
ing to - Mahony 's schedule, to a hand
out from the city treasury. From six
to ten of these are friends of the Coun
ty Clerk he called In. to assist him at
various times so that he might be In a
position to place their names on the
pay roll of the office..
Several more are inanimate fixtures
that Mahony has gathered around him
to do nothing more strenuous than
draw salaries.'- Where this money that
these phantom workers draw goes to is
a mystery. Just how much they are
allowed to keep for the privilege of
drawing It Is. a matter for conjecture.
Just how many "grafters" divide the
money that Is drawn by these office
figureheads is unknown, but the graft
is said to be 1)1 jr.
mah6ny*s statement.
Mahony, when Interviewed on hlB
uneven distribution of the salaries of
his office, said: "I am determined to
run this office as it should be.' If a 'man
does not show up every day I am going
to dock his salary from this time on.
I shall run this office straight until my
term is out. All of these men'who are
kicking about not getting what was
coming to them have got every cent
they deserved.' Some of them did not
show up half the time and others were
absent for days or got on sprees and
failed to do their work. I was com
pelled to call in new men to take their
places while they were absent.
"This talk about my having a let of
men around me who never do anything
is" all rot. There is. not a man in this
office that does not do all this position
requires of him. Why should I go Into
the back room of a saloon to prepare
my pay rool? This talk about McKen
na and myself fixing the. roll in the
rear of a saloon is false. The pay roll
Is straight and. every -man got Just
what he worked for and no more." .

"If the place of business of Simpson
Is, as the accused testified, the worst
on his beat It is a place that would
be likely to pay money to keep open
and should have been reported to- the
Police Commission. The fact that it
was not reported is a circumstance
against the accused.
"Whatever Simpson's reputation may
be, we think that he and also Neill and
/Baddeley and Walsh told the truth.
The attempted Impeachment of these
witnesses does not discredit their testi
mony given in the trial in .our minds.
"The fact that no money was taken
or solicited from any other saloon- on
the beat of the accused does not show
it was not taken from Simpson. The.
accused may have Just determined to
commence a series of offenses 'of this
kind- and selected this place to com
mence with. > . \ .*
"We can see no reason why Slmp-
the city's interest that personal bonds
should not be given, among the reasons
because citizens are importuned to go on
bonds out of friendship, thus unwit
tingly exposing themselves to a liability,
and officers place themselves under obli
gation to their bondsmen, who may de
mand special favors and privileges. The
charter in fixing the salaries of officials
intended them to enjoy the full benefits
of such salaries. If they pay the pre
miums they lose a portion of x their com
pensation, and rather than suffer this
loss they will endeavor to give personal
bonds.
Sergeant of Police Reuben A. "Wolf
was dismissed from the department by
order of the Commissioners last night.
Voluminous testimony was taken dur
ing the last four weeks to prove that
the accused had on three occasions ac
cepted a bribe from George B. Simp
son, a saloon-keeper at the corner of
Mission and Seventh streets, and by a
unanimous vote of the board he was
found guilty and the penalty fixed at
dismissal. Evidence was introduced
tending to show that on August 10 Wolf
had taken $10, on September 21 $5 and
on October 6 J5. The* portion of the
decision referring to Wolf's defense is
as follows:
"The defense offered evidence tending
to show: â¢ ' < Â¦Â¦/ . \ '
"Firstâ The good reputation ' of the
accused as an officer and a sergeant.

"It may be well to remember ki that

claims against the municipality, even
if finally unsuccessful may embarrass

"Under these circumstances it Is
probably unnecessary to consider the
remaining questions as to whether the
"adoption of such ( resolution would
jeopardize any of the rights of the
city or could be construed as recogniz
ing any right of the railroad company

1904.
City Attorney Lane advised the
Board of Supervisors yesterday that
a proposed resolution providing
against interference in the operation
of Â¦ the Geary-street railroad until*
February 1, 1904 (the franchise hav
ing expired), would be invalid and of
no effect. The opinion follows: '"';.'.*
"If the resolution suggested . could
be of any effect whatsoever it would
be in substance a franchise to ex
pire February 1, 1904. The charter
provides the procedure under ' which
franchises may Jbe granted, ah. essen
tial feature of which is the submission
of the matter to the public for pur
poses of competitive bidding and
the charter provides that the right
may â¢ be granted in that manner and
'none other.' In the method proposed
to allow the road to operate no at
tempt is made to follow this plan and
I am therefore of the opinion that the
resolution would be of no validity.

ADVERTISEMENTS. gÂ£ * ./ The unwisdom of some men dealing: in public affairs
sometimes passes understanding. Disgracing .the name of
his tradesmen for cunning, a burglar operated in Oakland
the other day and was killed. Why did, he not remain in
San Francisco and thrive? This is one of the problems a
sociologist is stumped to solve. r
The pupil must put all the strength
in the Onger he can as it. comes down,
but afterthe note has once been struck
forcibly he must not keep pressing his
finger down, for" that induces a- flat,
hard Bound, the reverse of that we are
working for. Instead, while still hold
ing the finger on the key, but not press
ing, he can hold the tone, with its ring-
Ing quality, perfectly, well, ' by a little
effort. of the will, even while hjs. arm,
wrist and even fingers are moving
lightly, in response to the circle mo
tion. The fingers do not leave the keys
at this time (except the ' one that is
upraised preparatory to striking . the
next note), but they move around free
ly en - their respective notes, in obedi
ence to the re!axlhg_exercise, and the
finger that has just struck and is hold*
Ing the note down moves as frpely as
the .rest, being sure, however, to' keep
the note down and- not to let. it^ rise
until .the next one I3 ready r to strike.*
Now, still counting "one, two, three,",
let him try the scale, putting all the
strength he can possibly muster Into
each note, without tightening the mus
cles thereby. He must raise his fin
gers very high Cstill curved, however),
and bring them down with a clear, bell
like tone, which must have enough
ringing quaiity to last through the in
tervening relaxing motion, until the
next note- is struck, which, in Its turn,
holds Its "singing "quality" until tho
note beyond It strikes.
It is very important that these notes
should all be struck slowly, with ex
actly the same amount of time . be
tween each one, and . that the sound
should hold' over (the finger : remain-
Ing on the key during the relaxing) un
til the next mote is struck, but not a
moment longer. Remember, the rule
for raising and lowering the fingers
plenty of time between, but .the move
ment simultaneous and as quick as
possible. . â¢ ' " . .
â¢ â¢ â¢
the seeming difference in .the hands,
let. him begin with the descending
scale of the. left hand, returning by
the .ascending scale. , After a few
trials in this way he wiU'readily see
that it is Just the same thing that he
has been doing Vith his right hand,
only turned exactly around.
FOURTH FINGER SCALE EX
ERCISE, AFTER FOURTH
FINGER HAS LEFT KEY.
Try it first with oneMiand, then with
the other, for nil these exercises are
Intended for both hands. The two
hands must practice separately, how
ever, as that is the only way to insure
ngrainst mistakes. When one has two
hands to watch something is sure to
go unnoticed, even with the most con
scientious pupn. 9Â£<H
When the child has overcome all
the difficulties of this exercise. Both
at the table and at the piano, try the
movement v.'ith enough strength, in
the fingers to cause -^ sound. Xow
watch everything: â position of fingers.
:irm and handâ and constantly try
the njuscles to see thnt they are keep-
Ing 1 relaxed; see that the hand does
not twist as the fingers pass over or
under; that the thumb does not fall
Much time must be given to the
practice of this exercise, for it is the
pith and core of scale playing, and a
great deal of time may be saved by
conquering this point by itself in
stead of â¢ Folnj? through the * whole
scale each time. ' ''
Now, try the exercise a number of
times, passing the thumb under the
hand until it stands over the note prop
erly occupied by the fifth finger. Then
let it drop, a*nd Immediately fling the
.hand out sideways, with great freedom,
as in the lasf lesson. Now fling it back
again, raising: the fourth finger as the
hand swings back and crosses over the
thumb. As the fourth finger comes down
on the note to the left of the thumb
(the thumb being on G) the rest of the
hand springs back into position by aid
of the lateral wrist motion, and the
hand is once more in "playing posi
tion" and re.ady to recommence the ex
ercise.
â¢It will be seen that this is exactly
the same exercise as that given in the
leet lesson, except that the fourth fin
ger is used Instead of the third. If a
fuller understanding of it is desired go
back to the last lesson once more and
apply all the rules there explained to
the exercise as given to-day. <
*.</. â¢ *
When the fourth finger is mastered,
both going ur> and coming down the
piano, there is no further obstacle to
srale playing. The .rest will be plain
sailing. Merely substitute the thumb
for the .fifth (little) finger on the last
note of each octave, and one may go
nn ad infinitum, or at least to the top
of his plann. . * r":'^:
Now have the pupil again try the lit
tle scal?Â» exercise- described in the last
le?f=on>. this time throwing the fourth
finger instead of the third as before,
and by this rhear.s "bringing the thumb
down -where the fifth (little) finger
would be under ordinary circumstances.
This is to enable. the hand to move on
up into' the next octave, thus increas
ing the scale to two 'octaves fnstead of
one. . '
th>ir.J>arrnts* to-, be "quite advanced"
"have . corr.e toÂ«rre and have -rattled on*
.thelr.Ffalfrs at breakneck speed, plung
ing along recklessly and landing on the
note*<eafh tjme the* fingers crossed)
ivith i\ rrat : can only be described as- a
â¢'Fick'ening thud." â¢ : â¢ â¢ ;â¢" f'
fiovr. all this is Ju-st what we must
.avoid, hj first of all getting the fingers
.t.o'pass under and over each ot-her with
out any.effo'rt whatever.
FOUJITOH FINGER SCALE EX
â¢ 1 ERCI.SE, AÂ£CEN*I>1NG. . -
The left hand is, of course, exactly
the same thing as the. right, but, nat
urally, the ascending scale begins on
â¢the" little finger, and continues straight
through the fingers, the third finger
crossing, over at A to finish out the
gcale.. In the same way, the descend
ing, scale progresses by the thumb
taking the place of the fourth finger,
and striking G, and so on down.
If the pupil is a little confused by
proper . sequence, thus insuring a
smooth scale, devoid of breaks. That
is the secret of. the whole thingâbe
ing there on time-^and if the finger
passing under or over, up or down,
as the case- may be, starts toward its
goal just as soon as it is free to move,
and; gradually reaches the desired po
sition quietly and unostentatiously,
while the fingers under (or over)
which it passes are still doing their
required work, there is not a second's
â¢time lost and the moment the other
fingers have finished the thumb (or
finger.as the case may be)' stands up,
raised directly over the note it is to
ptrike, as if it had aiways been there
for that particular purpose.
When . first practicing the scale to
produce tone, take it In one octave
only, trying one hand a few times,, and
.then the other.

The city, at the cost of the taxpayers, established a
municipal printing office, a carpentry bureau, a bureau of
electrical construction andTepair, a veterinary bureau" to
look after the health of 'the city's horses, and wheel
wrights, blacksmiths, plumbers; painters and letterers in
large numbers became' city employes and took their
place on the public payroll. There was also established
a municipal ice- plant, to supply ice for the. public offices
and drinking fountains, and. ultimately to supply the peo
ple at cost with ice during the/ .hot months. When the
whole scheme was put in operation Boston felicitated her
self that she was independent of the. contractors and
business men and able to live entirely within herself, jj
The system was maintained for two yearsj\ Then Mr.
Quincy left the Mayor's office and was succeeded by an
old business man, Mr. Hart, who was soon called on to
sign vouchers, for city work. He examined them/busi
ness fashion, and then began to look into the matter of
cost. He found a job of electrical equipment on the
ferry-boats belonging to the city, which a contractor of
fered to do for $6800, done by the city bureau, cost
$10,200. The electrical work on the building for hospi
tal nurses, worth $1528, cost $4754. Similar work on the
city armory, worth $2600, cost $6700, and on the public
school buildings work worth $1471 cost $3600. These
small finds se.t Mayor Hart hunting among the books,
vouchers and accounts. He found that the ice turned out
by the city ice plant was costing $60 a ton, while the mar
ket price was $2 a ton. When the investigation was fin
ished it was found that in the water department and . the
other business bureaus of the city the waste was so
enormous that the city debt had expanded over four
times the limit allowed by the law, and that this had been
effected by special acts of the Legislature, from time to
time, permitting the city to issue bonds to meet the de
ficits caused by the administration of the public utilities.
The payrolls were loaded down with employes, and
these in turn exerted thir political influence upon the
Cit3 r Council to continue piling up the burden. It was
found that this mixture of business and politics had made
it impossible- to secure efficiency. An employe in the
public printing office was discharged for incompetency.
He refused to accept the- discharge and, returned next day
saying to the superintendent: "Alderman Blank of South
.Boston says I'm to go back to work, and if you make any
kick about it I'm*to have your place and you go, see?"
And back he went. Under the civil service rules men in
any specialty could be called for and employed by non
competitive examination, and then be assigned to some
thing else than the work in which they were examined.
So it was found that there were employed > on -clerical
work or inspection of pipes and hydrants in the water
department men who got into the service as coppersmiths,
ship calkers, one as an swimmer," sailors, dial
makers, rubber gasket makers, riggers, splicers, stone
cutters, miners, beam tenders, wire men and rod men.
Each had been called by special requisition for his class
of work, though not even "expert swimming" was re
quired in administering the public â¢water plant.
It was found by Mayor Hart that one-third of the
city employes could be spared without hurting the ser
vice, they were discharged. It soon appeared that
by putting an end to this sumptuous system of running
public utilities and charging deficits off to the taxpayers
Boston was saved $600,000. The cost of everything
touched, handled and produced had exceeded the open
price by from 25 to several thousand per cent.
Yet it was admitted by Mayor Hart that the adminis
tration of these utilities had not been criminally cor
rupt. The forms of law had ,bcen respected, and Mayor
Quincy was an honest man. The trouble was that gov
ernment had gone into business, 'with the usual result
of inefficiency, extravagance and waste. The lesson was
not lost on Boston, and she has convalesced entirely from
her fever for public ownership of public utilities.
The lesson should' not be lost upon other cities
which are now free of such mistakes, and are
at liberty to avoid them if they, will. If the muni
cipal ice plant of Boston had been compelled to run on
its own income, does any one believe- that cost . of its
ice to the taxpayers would have been $60 a, ton? If the
water system were supported by the ratepayers alone, and
its payrolls and balancc-shccts ; Tnade public, does any one
believe that it would have had its payroll crowded with
sailors, expert swimmers, dial makers and splicers?
Without denying, as it is not necessary to our pur
pose, that some, public utilities may be in public owner
ship', we affirm that all experience" demands that each util
ity be supported solely and only by the income derived
from those who use.it. Boston has lost Utopia, but is
saving money by it. .
IN the year 1898 the city of Boston entered upon a
large number of ventures in public ownership, or real
.or supposed public utilities. Under Mayor Josiah
Quincy the city decided to do no business with contract
ors, but to establish its own shops and do all of its own
work by its own employes. The plan was very alluring.
It was to be put in operation under strict civil service
rules, and Mayor Quincy' was honest and enthusiastic
man 'and reformer. Whatever he said was indorsed and

holding by its ruffled tall the corpse of
a battered molly cat.

I found in the ash barrel."

An epitome may be found in the recommendation of

least sixâ education, manufactures, machinery, horticul

State and every county that has in view to attract desir
able settlers will unquestionably put its best foot fore
most and show to. the world, all that it has. The state
ment has so often been made that California's resources
are more varied than those of any other land under the
sun that it has become trite, yet the present demand for
exhibits to be sh6wn*at St. Louis has so amply demon
strated its truth that no intelligent observer will. venture
to dispute it. . Â¦.Â» - â¢
At the gateway of the San Joaquin Valley is the fer
tile and enterprising county of San Joaquin. This county
has prepared to exhibit well at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. Incidentally, a list of the classes of county
products that will be sent forward to St. Louis has been
published in the Stockton Independent. The county has
352 manufacturing establishments, of which, so says the
Independent, 291 are in Stockton. The. output of these
plants is valued at more than^j^ooo.ooo per annum. â¢ All
sorts of manufactured goodsand wares for home use are
made; To enumerate them would take much space.
.It appears that there are seventy-three varieties of
grapes that are grown to* perfection . in San Joaquin
County. These will be shown at St. Louis to make the
mouths of millions of visitors water. The county is one
of the leading almond sections of the State, and it also
has to display, from its ample store, chestnuts, walnuts,
pecans and peanuts. Among the pomaceous and stone
fruits that thrive under the genial sky that drops fatness
on the county are peaches, plums, apricots, prunes, cher
ries, nectarines, quinces and pears. Many samples of
these fruits, canned and dried, will be in the San Joaquin
County show for the St. Louis Exposition.
A comprehensive collection of seeds that has been made
embraces about every sort of flower and vegetable seed
that is known." The committee that has charge of gathering
exhibits illustrative of Sa,n Joaquin County's resources,
knowing what is produced, has recommended that "an.
especially strong display of potatoes, onions, beans, as
paragus, chicory, "sugar beets, olives and other vegetable
food products should be made. While a Jimited display
in processed form. is recommended, arrangements should
be made to show the natural product, both in season and
from cold storage. While fruits should be shown from
San Joaquin County, greater emphasis should be made
at St. Louis with produce, cereals, dairy products, etc." â¢
Turning to the matter of cereals the county committee
enumerates as <a part of the county sho\v>cprn, Egyptian
c6rn, ( ; wheat, rye and barley. Among the forage plants
and fodder are alfalfa, rye crass, alfilaria and qlover. Un
der the head of animal ioSd products are arrayed dairy
products and eggs. The livestock men will be repre
sented by dairy herds, beef cattle, thoroughbred horses,
sheep and hogs. Domesticated birds will lend variety and
cheerful noise to attract spectators.

Ralph Ely and E. H. Forst, partners
in the Maison Rlche, was transferred
to the chambers of the Police Com
missioners last night. A costly rou
lette table found by police officers in
the place was made the* instrument
by which Ely .was shorn of power and
Forst w a lk e <l forth a victor. The
liquor license of the place ' was re
voked and' the patrons, for a week at
leant, must dine according to the tem
perance code until Forst- can secure
n new license in hi3 own name to the
exclusion of Ely. '.
Mr. Gates made the announcement
that over 50 per cent of the men be
hind prison bars to-day are under 25
years of age, and that, an overwhelm
ing percentage of- these received their
education from the streets. He made
an- eloquent appeal to club women and
to all who are interested In tho subject
of good citizenship to urge the enforce
ment of boys and girls into schools,
where they will at least glean the
fundamental principles of right living
and "get started right" during the for
mative period of their characters.
The system of short terms for'crlmi
nals â those .who return more or less
regularly to the prisoners' dock^ â was
vigorously condemned. ' "Put them
away," says Mr.; Gates, "on an indeter
minate .sentence and if there's any
reformation In them the hope\to be
come high-class men; who will gain their
liberty soonest, will bring about the de
sired results. And If that fall, ' then
lock them up forever, for .they are In
corrigible menaces to society and
should' be put where they can ,do no
further harm. And this course, though
apparently harsh,- is. the only: sane one
for ' the protection of society - f rom ; the
abnormal and congenitally vicious."
At- the > conclusion- of the address a
rising vote ! of } thanks was . given Mr.
Gates aod the assistance and support
He reviewed Jhe classes of people
that the board of charities had to deal
withâ the defective, the delinquent, the
dependent and the depnuu?d â and made
the statement that the'province of the
board was not to manage the various
Institutions provided for these charges,
but .to supervise their management, to
gather euch knowledge and data as will
assist in their Intelligent administra
tion and to seek out and stamp out
abuses wherever they are found to
exist.
Before the speaker was presented to
the clubwomen Mrs. George Law Smith
announced that a bit of very important
news had arrived from Washington and
that Mrs. A. D. Sharon would impart
It to Â«tne club. Thereupon Mrs7"Sharon,
who Is chairman of the standing com
mittee on Calaveras Big Trees, read
a letter from Congressman N. J. Gil
lette.--to whose custody the Calaveras
Big Trees bill has-been intrusted by the
California Club. The letter conveyed
the very welcome information that on
November 17 the Calaveras Big Trees
bill, carrying ari appropriation of $250,
000, had been read aryi placed on file in
the lower house, and that circum
stances indicated a prompt and favor
able, report upon the same. This infor
mation was received with the greatest
enthusiasm by- the .club â the vigilant
mother of the billâ and "Mrs. Sharon re
ceived- many expressions of apprecia
tion anjl to s^ek out and stamp' out
long years in behalf of the. bill that has
Just started forth upon its career for a
second time.
After the applause attending the/an
nouncement had died away Mr. Gates
was presented by Mrs.' George Law
Smith. â¢
Testerday was the California Club's
busy "da'y. The feature of the afternoon
â¢was an addpess' upon "The Purpose of

POSTMASTER OF SAN. FRANCISCO WHOSE RESIGNATION 'lÂ£ IN
* THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT AND FORMER SPEAKER OF
THE ASSEMBLY WHO WILL PROBABLY SUCCEED HIM*
"Does the resignation take effect Im
mediately or on the first of the year?"
."That I don't know. It la in the
hands of the President."
Postmaster Montague was reticent
about discussing: the matter. He ad
mitted that he had resigned and said
he did so because of ill health.
"How long ago did you resign, Mr.
Montague?" he was asked.
"Some time ago," he replied^
"I understood that my name would
-b<Â» presented to the President."' said
Mr. Fisk last evening, "but until fny
-appointment is confirmed I can say
nothing for publication. I knew that
.1 was recommended by the Republican
organization of this State and that
Senator Perkins would present my
name. It would bÂ«? Jn poor tajÂ«te for me
to say anything at present. My friends
s eeem to believe that I will be selected
for the Important position. I trust
their belief Is founded on fact"
Mr. Fisk is a Harvard graduate and
is a lawyer by profession. â¢ He is mar
j-ied and has two cklldren.
I Mr. Fisk has been prominently men<
tioned as â¢ a " successor to William F.
Wynn as Congressman from the Fifth
District. His friends have begged him
to declare himself a" candidate", in order
that they" might begin working In his
behalf at this early day.
.It M* -aiiit* .probable that Arthur G.
F*isk will- be the next Postmaster of
SaaiFrajiciscp. ' Senator George C. Per-
Jdns has submitted Fisk's name to
IPreiident Roosevelt, and Senator Bard
has'-ac^uiVced in his. appointment.. All
.thai- re;nains "Is for the President to
send "Mr, Fisk's name to the Senate for
"con^rmation. This he will likely do
y.-itftfa the next few days. ;
Â¦ ..Fjr.tiie last month, speculation has

The.d came the postofflce scandals, and
X.was deefned best to withhgld action
on'llia PoEtrriaster's resignation . until
i.h-e etorra jnight blow ov.er. Now that
the scandal has- been aired and the
Postmaster's name has not "been, cou
pled in any way with those mixc-d up
In' alleged wrongdoing It is thought the
timfc is opportune for his retirement
Â¦frotn the important office he has occu
pied for many years.
'.Arthur G. .Fisk was recommended by
â¢mejnbers-cf the Republican organiza
tion of. this .State. He did not press
his : claims for.the position, as he knew
that. If he- was to be Postmaster his
recjsrd and the services he had rendered
t hej party in â¢ national and State poll- Â¦
tics would be hta best* Indorsement.

"JUST RUN ACROSS"
Some People Are Lucky.
Some people make an Intelligent
study of food and pet on the right
track (pure food), others are lucky
enough to stumble -uporf the. right way
out of the difficulty. Just as a Philadel-
phia youns woman did.
She says: "I had suffered terribly
from nervous indigestion, everything
seemed to. disagree with me and I was
on the point of starvation when one
day I happened to run across a demon-
stration of Postum Food Coffee at one
of the big stores here.
"I took a sample home, and- a sample
of Grape-Nuts as well- and there tried
them again and found they agreed
with roe perfectly. For months I made
them my main diet and as the result
I am restored to my former perfect
health and can eat everything I
?'When I epoke to my physician about !
Grape-JCuts he said, .'It is a* most ex-
cellent food.* " Name given* by Postum
Co., Battle Creek. Mich.
There's a reason.
Look for the famous little book, "The
Road to Wellville," in every I package
of both Postum and Orape-Nuts.

- The first two rounds were slow. In

count, got "up and clinched. From that
time until the ninth laoth men fought
savagely, Hart having: the best of the
battle. :
Carter was' knocked down several

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
BERENDOS GALLOPS HOME.
Louis Wagner was the real warm one
for the introductory Futurity course
event. The Kastern horse was played
down in the betting from 3 to 2 to even
money," and, after leading until well
into â¢ the stretch, went all to pieces.
Then Berendos, a 10 to 1 shot, galloped
in ahead of Mountebank and Oscar
Tolle, /
With Â«TOod, strong handling, Military
Man; favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, would have won. Adkins
rode him about as well as a wooden
man would, finishing third, beaten but
tv.-o heads by Captain Forsee and The
Cure The winner, Captain Forsee,
was quoted at 12 to 1, and was not the
best horse in the race by any manner
of means. Ferrell, who rode him, cut
across v the field at the start r and was
not headed.
D. Hall, on Father Wentker, beat
the others away from the barrier in the
third number, a Futurity course run,
with a field of eleven starting. This
feat Contributed largely to his success.
The Schreiber horse closed equal favor
ite with Rollick. Adkins, on the lat
ter, gave a miserable exhibition of
jockeyship, with a result that Father
Wentker finished first by a length. Rey
Dare, a 10 to 1 chance, ran third.
After several essays Horton- at last
annexed apurse. â¢ The little chestnut
met an 'Inferior lot in the closing mile
event, and at odds of 3 to 5 won easily.
Constable, a 60 to 1 shot, led Bill Mas
sie out for the place.
It was fa peculiar betting affair
throughout. Although there seemed to
be little action behind Martinmas in
the ring, Charley Henshall's horse re
ceded from 2 to 5 to 2, and then closed
favorite.
John A. Scott opened at 8 to 5, and
closed at IS to 5, at which price the
odds about Iridius were backed. Al
though Adklns, Mho had the mount on
Scott, was told to. lay back, he went
out and made the pace. The 113 pounds
told on the chestnut nearingr the wire,
and Iridius; which was shouldering
only 99 pounds, collared and beat him
out a neck in l:13'/i. Warte Nicht .fin

The event will be- run^ at Union

| Of this the winner will receive $500;
runner up, $300; third, $175, fourth, $100;
the next eight, $50 each, and the next

A meeting of the Interstate Coursing
Club was neld last night in Pythian
Castle to arrange the preliminaries of
this year's John Grace Challenge Cup
stake. John Hajton reported for the
cup committee. . VVf-^'rV;
Half of the six events down for de
cision went to favorites in the betting,
but the sudden bobbing, to the surface
of Berendos and Captain Forsee, both
long shots, were entirely unexpected.
There was a good attendance and the
books bad the better of the argument.
Milt Jones' sprinter, John A. Scott,
ran a remarkably good race in the six
furlong handicap, only to be downed a
neck by the Jennings entry, Iridius.
"When Foley lodged a protest with
the Judges the claim was allowed and
the race given to the favorite. This
gave the place to Lacy Crawford and
show honors to Heather Honey.
ALLOW CLAIM OF f FOUL.
Henderson, not to be outdone,
"passed the buck" back. At the pad

caught the two leaders and he could
not refrain from taking, a hand.

manifested < its approval by loudly
cheering the Judges' decisicm.
Last Knight was a 3 to 2 favorite
and at the head Â¦ of the stretch he
looked all over a winner. . Then Foley
relapsed into one of 'his lethargic
spells and, /when arouse'd from the
trance, Henderson, with â¢ Heather

for his'whip and let his mount swerve
in toward the rail.

That the storekeepers of the Western
Addition are an extraordinarily gulle-
Signor Ricci's razor was exhibit A in
the case, and when the weapon was
passed up to the bench for inspection
the court gingerly ran a thumbnail
along its edge and then tossed it back
to the clerk, with a shrug of mingled
amusement and disappointment.
"A man's skull might be fractured
with that implement,", was the Judge's
remark, "but as . a cutting tool it is
innocuous.".
"May it please, the court, we claim
that this is a deadly weapon," shouted
an attorney Interested in the prosecu
tion.
"So is a sandbag," was the court's
amblgyous comment.
In dismissing the case Judge Ca
baniss did not say that the bluntnesa
of the Riccl razor inspired his decision.
. Judge Cabaniss, several â¢â¢ attorneys
â¢and an interpreter labored long and
strenuously with the case of Joseph
Riccl, laborer, accused of wielding a
razor and otherwise terrorizing the in
mates of Joseph Almo's boarding-house
at 641. King street. Â¦ Principals and wit
nesses told their respective tales In
soft, Neapolitan gutturals, and. the elo
quence of their accompanying gestures
made the narrative plain as day even
to those among their audience who did
not understand their language.
From the mass of testimony it was
ascertained that Signor Almo. and his
boarders had Just returned from a
funeral and were soberly partaking of
dinner when Signor RIcci,. heated with
wine, entered the dining-room and
hilariously Insisted upon being allowed
to contribute claret to the menu. As
h!s visitor's mood was incompatible
with the spirit of mourning that poss
essed his boarders, Signor Almo expos
tulated by smiting Signor Ricci's head
with a chair, whereupon Signor Rlcci
drew a razor and precipitated what the
arresting policeman designated "a
rough house." Furniture . and Italian
expletives were flying thick and fast
when the policeman burst in and suc
ceeded in bringing order out of chaos.
With the mother's thanks and the
son's sobs of gratitude ringing In his
ears the Judge Instructed the clerk to
call the next case.
eixteen-year-old Tommy Kerwin
wanted to be a desperado, and evident
ly thought he was one when he de
serted his widowed mother's humble
hcrnie In Sunshine alley and subsisted
on bread and milk stolen from door
steps and slept In a hay barn. He was
"caught in the act of pilfering his break
fast one rooming about two weeks ago,
and when Police Judge Mogan allowed
him to go free on probation he seemed
1 io be repentant. 'His farinaceous fare
' must have become .monotonous, how
ever, for yesterday he was before the
same tribunal on a charge of having
stolen candy from a store. His mother
was In the courtroom.
"What are you tryinjr to do, Tom
my?", inquired the Judge. "Break into
the penitentiary?"
Tommy tried to look defiant, even
when his mother wept. The Judge
eyed him keenly.
"As you appear to be incorrigible I
must send you to the Reform School
and see that you are kept there until
you decide to be an honest boy."
Tommy's fortitude melted in a blub
ber and he implored the court to give
him another chance. "I will stay at
home and steal no more, Judge; indeed
I won't," he sobbed. The mother also
prayed the court to deal leniently with
her wayward son, and her appeal evi
dently had more effect than his prom
ises. .
"I am sorry for you," said the Judge,
addressing the weeping woman, "for
you appear to be a good mother. And
X do .not want to send your lad to
prison, although ne seems determined
to force an entrance there. So , you
may take him home with you, and,"
turning to the boy and shaking a
threatening finger, . "if you come be
fore me again I will send you to the
Reform School sure. Until further or
ders you must come to me once a week
and eatisfy me that you are living
honestly." . :
â¢ No argument was made, of course,
and Grace Austin was removed from
â¢ the courtroom.
"I could not .afford to take any
chances of that woman eluding Jus
tice?" said the Judge, in explanation
of his summary .action. "She is a
chronic vagrant beyond doubt, and she
is also a convicted thief, likewise a ball
Jumper. Several months ago she was
before me on- a charge of larceny and
I admitted her to bail pending a con
tinuance of the case. She did not ap
pear oh tbe appointed date and her
bondsmen found themselves victims of
misplaced confidence.
"Since then. I have ascertained, she
was u'p before Judge Cabaniss on a
similar- charge' and escaped punishment
In a similar way. She has earned the
sobriquet of 'The vanishing lady," but
she will not live up to her title for six
months anyway."
I The Judge smiled grimly and said no
j more about "Grace Austin, vagrancy,"
j until a' frowzled female of uncertain
age stood before him and falteringly
tried to meet his stern and reproving
eye. ....
"So hare you are again," he said, "on
the same old charge."
"Yes, your ' Honor," murmured the
defendant.
Then a policeman told of how he had
arrested the woman because he discov
ered she had no visible means of hon
rest maintenance, and an attorney was
i about to cross-examine the policeman
when the court intervened.
"Hold on," he said: "I sentence the
defendant to 6lx months in the County
r.Jall. Now, Mr. Pleader, you may make
|"your argument"
"She are," was the flippant reply.
Pollfce Judge Mogan gasped, rubbed
his eyes and gasped again when he
glanced at his docket yesterday morn
ing and saw among the names and
charges inscribed thereon, "Grace Aus
tin, vagrancy." Pointing to the name
with eager finger, he turned to Clerk
Pundt and whispered:
Mrs. Josephine TVinship, seamstress,
residing at 229 Harriett street, was ar
rested early yesterday morning on
complaint of Eugene Duffey of 320
Minna street, who charged her with
having stolen two $20 gold pieces from
his apartment while she was making
a casual call. When Policeman L.a-
When the court's decision and pen
alty were announced a number of the
colored troopers made up a pool of
their available cash to pay Jackson's
fine, but the total subscriptions came
within quite a few dollars of the requi
site sum, and then, bidding "Gawge"
to be of good cheer until they returned
and freed him, the dusky crowd went
forth to "hustle.t
A fine of $30, with the alternative of
thirty days in prison, was the punish
ment prescribed by Police Judge Mo
gan for George Jackson, the colored
cavalryman who slashed David . R.
Brown, a coast artilleryman, with a
razor during a melee on November 21,
while the parties were aboard a Union
street car and bound for the Presidio.
Witnesses of the event testified that
the scrimmage was general among a
lot of private soldiers of varying na
tionalities and uniforms. Several of
the defendant's colored comrades-in
arms tried to make 1t appear that he
was more sinned against than sinning
when he drew the favorite weapon of
his race and attempted to defend him
self by carving Brown. On the other
hand, some white soldiers swore that
the -negro's attack was unwarranted,
if not unprovoked.
"Thank you," was the Judge's dryly
uttered response; "but the truth is
we're long on interpreters and short on
lawyers in this case."
Not one of the legal gentlemen
laughed out loud at the Judicial sally.
While an assault case in which the
parties were Italians was In progress
before Judge Cabaniss the Interpreter
left the courtroom before his services
were entirely dispensed with, . and in
his absence one of the attorneys in
formed the bench that if an Interpreter
were needed his side would furnish
one.
Mr. Kelley did not tell the court
â¢vyhere he obtained his supply of "Con
feds." He will be. sentenced Jo-day.
less lot was demonstrated befqre Police
Judge Conlan when several retailers of
groceries and ardent spirits of that sec
tion of the city told of how they had
been taken in and done for by Thomas
Kelley, alias Frank Cunningham,
charged with having obtained money
by false pretense.
The complaining witness, a grocery
man, whose store is at Sutter and La
guna streets, described the Kelley
method of getting something for noth
ing, and his testimony was corrobo
rated by other dealers in household
necessaries doing business in the same
district. Mr. Kelley's system was sim
plicity Itself. He Just went into a gro
cery, ordered a quart bottle of whisky
for $1 50 and tendered a $20 Confederate
bill in payment. If the grocer accepted
the worthless bill and gave Mr. Kelley
the .bottle of whisky and $18 60 In
change Mr. Kelley walked out and was
seen no more by that particular victim.
But If, on the other hand, the store
keeper happened to have cut his eye
teeth In ante-bellum days and recog
nized a "Confed" bill when it came his
way, Mr. Kelley deploringly explained
that he had taken the valueless bit of
paper in payment for labor performed,
and that it was all the money, or
semblance of money, he had In his pos
session. So the dealer congratulated
himself upon his perspicacity and the
salvation of his bottle of whisky and
$.18 50 in good hard Federal coin.
But it appeared that the majority of
Western Addition grocerymen upon
whom Mr. Kelley ' tried his get-rich
quick scheme were not versed in the
identification of spurious currency, for
he drove a roaring trade ere the' sharp
fellow at Sutter and Laguna 'streets
brought his crooked career to an abrupt
halt. Indeed, a' canvass of the liquor
purveyors of the district would result
in the discovery of a surprisingly large
number of bills of $20 denomination
which were Issued by the unrecognized
government of which Jefferson Davis
was President. The holders of these
souvenirs are not likely to boast of
possessing ' them, however, for every
one of them is a testimonial to Its own
er's lack of ordinary mercantile sophis
tication.

J. Ray Prewett, who was married on
February 15, 1900. to Sadie Prewett,
has Just learned that his marriage did
not bring him happiness. Yesterday
he filed a suit to have- it annulled on
the ground that when he took unto
himself a wife he was not 21 years of
age and did not ask the consent of his
mamma and his papa. In his com
plaint he eays that he ,was but little
over 20 years of age when he became
a benedict, and that as soon as he
learned that marriage at that age
without the consent of one's parents
was illegal he immediately ' left his
wife.

Deputy Treasurer Resigns.
Merton C. Allen, a deputy in the of

strained to resign for personal reasons.

Bumble Demurs.
W. H. H. Hart appeared in the United
States District Court yesterday and ar
gued a demurrer to the indictment
against George W. Rumble, charged with
having used the United States malls for
the purpose of defrauding his corre
spondents by means of a mining scheme.
The chief ground of the demurrer was
that the acts C9mplained of in the in
dictment were not alleged to have been
committed within the period of elx con
secutive months.
Grange, to whom Duffey first unfolded
his suspicion, went to the woman's
house he found her in the act of at
tempting to conceal two coins of the
denomination described by the com
plainant.
When the case was called before Po
lice Judge Cabaniss the fact was de
veloped that, far from being an occa
sional visitor to the Duffey apartment,
Mrs. 'YVinship went there frequently,
and carried a key which enabled her
to enter when she pleased and without
knocking at the door, said key being
in her possession, as she testified,
"with Mr. Duffey/s knowledge and con
sent."
Whether this proof of Mr. Duffey's
confidence In Mrs. Winship's integrity
will be regarded as mitigatory by the
court remains to be seen, as the case
was continued till December 7.

Maybe it isn't necessary to go into this detail, but
there is so much romantic fiction in shoe advertising, that
we don't blame people for being a trifle " gtmrshy." " : ir
Well, you know, it's a heap easier to write words,

The grand president has been re
quested to, by reason of her position
and as a member of the Sempervirens
Club of Santa Cruz, to communicate
with President Roosevelt and solicit his
influence in' behalf of the big trees.
"The big tree committee of the Out
door Art League is desirous ttiat the
Native Daughters should exert their
Infiuence, and I would- therefore urge
each subordinate parlor to manifest Its
loyalty and interest in- these wonders
of the State by signing the inclosed
paper, under parlor seal, papers to be
headed with name of parlor and writ
ten on one side only.
"Wou4d kindly ask you to attend to
this matter on'election'night, when the
attendance is usually large, and return
paper with ' members' signatures- as
soon as possible to the grand president,
Santa Cruz, who is a member of the
State Council of the Outdoor Art
League.
"Should any member of any parlor
have friends or relatives in other
States who might be able to arouse in
terest among Representatives of these
States, kindly request hem to do so.
"Being confident of the hearty . co
operation of all our parlors, I am, sin
cerely and fraternally,
"STELLA FINKELDEY,

Lakme Loses Her Rudder.
The steam schooner Lakme, which
arrived yesterday sixty-four hours
from San Pedro, was steered for al
most the entire passage by a jury rud
der. When crossing the bar outside
of San Pedro harbor on Xovember 23
the Lakme struck bottom 'and the
jar Jolted off her rudder. Instead of
returning to the southern port for re
pairs Captain Klitgaard ordered all
hands to the rigging of a makeshift
rudder and within a few hours a
skillfully slung spar was doing the
Lakme's steering almost as efficiently
as the rudder had served before the
accident. Captain Klitgaard is a fear
less mariner and a navigator of some
note, but too capable a seaman to
take, unnecessary chances with his
owners' property. The Lakme's jury
rudder was all right for the run up
the coast, but a little bit unhandy for
making port in the hazy kind of
weather which yesterday morning
prevailed in these parts. Rather than
risk a misadventure on the bar Cap
tain Klitgaard anchored his vessel
outside the heads and by and by the
towboat Sea Queen came along, pass
ed a line to the Lakme and towed her
into port. In spite of the accident
the trip from San Pedro was made
in sixty-four hours.

STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Dec 1. â There was a consid
erable Increase of .activity In to-day's stork
market and a generally higher range resulted.
The movement continued herttating and some
what irregular and the small net changes re
sulting in some of the ftiore active stocks left
a Fuspicion of professional manipulation. Even
the -purpose of the supposed manipulation waa
the subject of doubt and dispute, covering such
carrying suppositions as a professional move
ment agalrist the short*, the bidding up of
prices for the purpose of marketing long stock
dnd even a purpose on the part of the bearish
professionals to make a market for putting
out fresh short lines. Speculative" sentiment
over stocks was .equally confused. There was
little ln the actual news r.t the day to favor
an advanr**-' in prices and some of the news
was distinctly unfavorable. The report of nÂ«t
earnings of the Brie for -October showed a
decrease of $375,758, compared with lftO2. This
was without effect, partly because It bad been
foretold and was known to have been due to
the loss and Interruption of traffic by floods..
It was partially offset also by the Reading
statement for the same period, which showed
an Increase In net earnings of all the compa
nies of $678,579. The renerat tendency- dls.-.
closed in other statements of earnings recently
has been for increases in gross earnings to b
mostly or wholly wiped out by 'enlarged oper
ating expenses.- The reports of gross earnings
for the third week in November thus far pub
lished show an increase on. the average of less
than 2 per cent, although the returns from thÂ«
coalers are not Included and this group will
compare with the large earnings - last year.
The passing of the dividend Â«>n Republic Steel,
although it had been feared, had not been fully
assured and considering- this the effect, in the
industrial list was slight. That stock itself
fell an extreme 2ft, but recovered â¢ all but a
fraction. There was a reduction in the price of
copper in the local market. The money mar
ket continues firm, but the high rates for call
loans reached only 7ft per -."ent, compared with
Â» per cent yesterday. The expected . trans
fer of $1,000,000 by telegraph to Fan Fran
cisco was made and an addit!6nal $200,000
was transferred to New . Orleans, while New
York exchange- at Chicago fell to a slight
discount. The price of gold rose in London
and sterling exchange weakened here, but only
$100,000 was *ecurÂ«d In London for New Tork
account. Announcement was made of about
*750,0rt0 of JaoaneM gold shipped .for San
Francisco. The factors In the advance in
ttocka were In the form rather of sureties, the
old rumor of a Gould-Pennsylvania settlement
figuring to a large extent. The strength of
Southern roads was attributed to general con
ditions, such as the prosperity of the Cotton
BÂ£lt and the harmony of railroad control as
sured by the recent Seaboard Air Line deal.
There was an attempt to convey the impression

steady prices.
The Chicago advices of Bolton. De Ruyter
& Co. say: "Market waa - a shade easier.
Receipts of Hogs are again below last year.
For the menth of November they were 100.00")
less than last year, while shipments were 5000
more and the average weight was 239. against
241. There Is a good distributive demand and
the whoie situation looks to us legitimate and
healthy. Packing interests do not seem ready
yet to bull the market, but on the other hand
they are not hedging their products to any
great extent. We still advise buying provi
sions."

CHICAGO. Deo. 1. â The fact that there were,
practically no deliveries on j December con
tracts created bullish sentiment in December,
wheat early and an advance of ' %e was made
within the first - hour. The better prices
brought out large realising sales and the ad
vance waa loet. May opened unchanged to Vic
higher at 81%c to 81%c. and although this de
livery ' received considerable support from the
leading bulls, and ! notwithstanding the sharp
rally In December, the price held barely steady
the early part of the session, due to persistent
selling by local ' traders. Reports of i fine
weather in Argentina, comparatively, smail
clearances, lower prices In all outside markets
and a fairly large Increase In elevator stocks
in the Northwest combined to create Â¦ bearish
sentiment toward -the noon hour and. the mar
ket yielded- to the pressure. â¢ May declining
to SOftc. Prices rallied somewhat, but the
close was lower, with May off Hfl^cÂ»t BT%
681c. '' December closed ft@%e lower at Slftc.
Corn ruled comparatively steady. May closed
a shade lower at 42Â©42Hc. - - :
The feature in oats was the liquidator! of
May. May closed a shade lower at 35->ic
Larger receipts ef hogs than expected and a
decline of 10c in orices at the yards caused
heavy selling of provisions. The close -was
steady, January pork being off- fie. lard a
shade lower and ribs down 7 ftc.

.As usual on Tuesday the receipts of Vege
tables from Los Angeles were light and offer
ings consisted chiefly of carried-over stock.
Fresh receipts of Peas and Beans by steamer
sold readily at the top quotations, while old
stock, which -was of poor quality, dragged at
unsteady rates, with some very -poor
stock selling down Â¦ tÂ»-.\ $1 per sack.
Tomatoes were dull, particularly the Bay arti
cle which continued \ to arrive freely. Good
quality offerings of Lima Bean* met with
prompt sale at hieh prices, while poor and
froÂ«t-bltten stock, which constituted the bulk
of tho supplies, could not be sold at any price.
- Receipt* of Potatoes were light, but the mar
ket was liberally supplied with low-grade Bur
hanks, particularly river kinds, and such stock
jftoved slowly. Fancy Salinas Burbanks were
'Â»tÂ»ady. whilo OrÂ»>eon were dull, as buyers were
holding off awaiting the arrival, of the Oregon
steamer, which was hourly, expected wlth*"TJb
â¢ral supplies. There were no fresh Sweets re
ceived, and old stock, which was plentiful, was
dull at DrÂ»viouÂ» orlces. Onions were rather
weak than otherwise, and sales at the top quo
tation were rare, $1 15 being about the top for
the common run of supplies.
Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Lima Beans have advanced slightly and are
quoted firm, with the growers not offering at
present. The otner descriptions show consid

Child Reported Dead Lives.
One, by way 'of Cazedero, the north
ern terminus of the North Shore road,
extends' north to Fort Ross on the
coast, a distance of eight miles, thence
along the south fork of the Gualala
River to ita Junction, thence over a di
vide into the Garcia Valley and then to
Point Arena and up the coast fifty
miles to Mendocino, leaving 112 miles
between the latter port and Eureka,
twenty-five of which are already cov
ered by the branch road of the Santa
Fe Company. Although this route is a
difficult one, requiring much tunneling
and bridging, to the engineers who
have examined it it is regarded as a
practical one. as It takes in all of the
more important towns along the coast
and passes .through a very valuable
timber section of Northern California.
Although many have contended that
a rail "route along the coast proper
could not be constructed, the engineers
who have been working so mysteriously
for several months in that section of
the State have submitted rougn plans
for one that can be extended northward
from Cazadero to the Navarro River
Valley and then along the lower
ridges, through sparsely populated dis
tricts to a point near the terminus of
the Eureka line. V
With the construction of one of these
lines and the merging of the j North
Shore road with its valuable terminal
facilities, the Santa Fe would soon find
itself on a fair footing with the South
ern Pacific Company, in so far as traffic
in the new field Is concerned, . and
would soon be able by the means of
branch roads to reach out for the inter
mediate traffic that would rapidly de
velop with the advent of new railroad
facilities in that section of the State.
Yesterday it was learned that three
different surveying parties, all sup
posed to be working Indirectly for the
Santa Fe, recently completed a number
of surveys from Cazadero northward
toward Pepperwood, the present south
ern terminal of the San Francisco and
Northwestern Railway a holdingsg. and
that their supplies, sucn as stakes and
other implements necessary on a sur
veying trip, were manufactured in the
Sausalito shops of the North Shore
road and forwarded by that company to
the men in the field. The reports of
these surveys are now In possession of
Chief Engineer Storey of the Santa Fe
Company and show that two routes
other than those originally contem
plated by way of the Eel River forks
are available to the plans of the Santa
Fe to connect Humboldt County with
the bay of San Francisco.
TAPPING TIMBER TRACTS.
done until the new year, it being ad
mitted by Chief Engineer Storey,
however, that serious obstacles had
been encountered and a great deal of
calculating would be necessary before
the surveying could be proceeded with.
Later reports of the Santa Fe having
surveyors at work nearer the coast
aroused much speculation. Their pres
ence so far out of the proposed course
of the new road created comment and
this was followed by stories to the ef
fect that the representatives of Presi
dent Ripley were again dealing with
the owners of the North Shore road,
with which the Santa Fe had an
agreement at the beginning of the
struggle for supremacy between It and
the Southern Pacific in the Humboldt

The department encampment will be
held in Los Angeles next April. Gen
eral A. W. Barrett of this city and Col
onel Rice of Los Angeles are in the
race for leadership in the department.
The contest between F. L.. â¢ Turpin
and Selden Sturges for the honor dt
commanding George H. Thomas Post,
Grand Army of the Republic, for the
ensuing year was settled last night by
the election of the first named. The
number of ballots cast was 150.
Commander-elect Turpin enlisted in
the Union army In 1864, serving first in
a Pennsylvania infantry regiment. He
re-enlisted in the Twenty-first Penn
sylvania Cavalry and served in that
regiment until the close of the war.
He came to California twenty-nine
years ago and is/a man of affairs. He
is the proprietor of the Royal, House, a
director of the Columbian Bank and
president of the Point Richmond De
velopment Company. In- the work of
raising money for the Thirty-seventh
National Encampment of the Grand
Army he was remarkably energetic
and was himself a generous contributor
to the fund collected by George H.
Thomas Post. His generosity and
energy attracted the notice of com
rades and suggested his promotion to
the first place in the -post.
Other officers chosen last night were:
C. W. Gordon, senior vice commander;
B. F. Hobart, junior vice commander;
C. H. Blinn, quartermaster: H. Mc'G.
Wilson, surgeon; R. A. Bigelow, chap
lain; A. J. Vining, officer of the day,
and-W. R. Parnell, C. E. Wilson and
Phil I. Fisher, trustees.
Several days before the election ef
forts we're made to induce one or the
other of the candidates for commander
to relinquish the fight in order that
complete harmony in the post might
prevail, but the supporters of each
aspirant were confident of success.
Comrade Sturges was promoted to post
commander several months ago, having
been selected in regular order to fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Colonel A.' D. Cutler. The fight that
was settled by the election of Mr. Tur
pin will have no bearing on the contest
for department commander to succeed
General Shafter.

F. I* TURPIN, THE NEW
COMMANDER OF GEORGE
H. THOMAS POST. G. A. R.
Mrs. Gernandt is said to have an un
governable temper. When Lottie would
be found at fault the- mother, It Is
said, would strike her with anything
that might come handy. Some weeks
ago the child's spine was Injured by a
blow from the potato masher, it is al
leged, 'and since then she has been un
able to remain awake very long at a
time. The child says that the mother
would be very angry to see her asleep,
and would awaken her by a blow from
the hatchet, a knife or the scissors.
The neighbors became worked up
over the matter, and finally reported
the case to the Society for the- Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children. Officer
McMurray made an Immediate investi
gation, and removed the little sufferer
from the Gernandt home. She told
again what the neighbors had told be
fore, and added numerous sad details.
Her head hung low, and she was cold
and drowsy.
The mother would have been arrest
ed. White says, had it not been for the
fact of her serious illness. The father
is thought to have been criminally neg
ligent In the matter, and an attempt
will probably be made by White to
have him punished.
One of the most shocking cases of
parental cruelty in the annals of the
San Francisco police authorities was
brought to light yesterday in the home
of W. F. Gernandt, a fireman, at 15C5
Kearny street. A slender little girl of
12 years had been slashed with a knife,
probably permanently injured by a
blow from a hatchet on the back of
her head, stabbed with a pair of scis
sors and beaten with a potato masher.
Worst of all, the mother of the suffer
ing child is alleged to be responsible
for all this brutality.
Secretary White of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
to whom the case was brought, says,
however, that he is almost sure that
Mrp." Gernandt ia not right mentally.
The father is said to have visited his
home daily and must have known of
the abuse which has been carried on
for months. White says that he will
probably arrest Gernandt and let him
tell to a Judge how he allowed such a
state of affairs to exist at his home.
Lottie, the little su/ferer, presented
a horrible appearance yesterday. One
ear had been partly torn from her head.
On her nose was a scar which is al
leged to have resulted from a knife
wound inflicted several weeks ago. One
hand is swollen to twice Its normal
size as the result of a bite. The other
hand shows a cut alleged to have
been made by the mother with the
scissors. The child's neck shows the
marks of fingers, where an attempt
had been made to choke her. On the
side of her head was a bruise from a
potato masher. Her hair was matted
with blood, which from the
wound made by the "hatchet. Her spine
has been injured so that she cannot
hold her head up. She told in a dazed
way how It ''\ all happened, and the
neighbors are said by White to have
corroborated her story. Last night she
was taken to the Emergency Hospital
temporarily.
The child has been enduring tortures
resulting from her injuries for weeks,
and It is feared that her health Is ruin
ed forever. The mother is said to be
near death from consumption. There
are seven other children in the family,
but Lottie Is said to be the only one
who has been mistreated. She had
been commissioned by the sick mother
to look after six younger children.
"These properties have been vested
in the San Francisco and Northwestern
Railway Company, a corporation of
which your company, through the
Santa Fe Land and Improvement
Company, owns all the securities. This
line ultimately Is to be extended south
ward to San Francisco Bay, or to a
connection with some existing road
over which connections can be made
with your main line. It Is believed that
these lines will not only be self-sus
taining, but that they will contribute
a large and profitable tonnage to your
existing lines."
SURVEY PARTIES ' AT "WORK.
At the time this report was made
to the directors of the Santa Fe road,
it was positively known to President
Ripley and the directors of the com
pany that Harriman, through' Henry
E. had acquired a firm
hold on the California Northwestern
Railroad and that the only rail con
nection that could be hoped for would
be the North Shore road. Several
surveys had also been made by the
company In a southeasterly direction
from Eureka, apparently with a view
of finding a route jlown the forks of the
Eel River and through the territory
claimed by the California Northwest
ern. Suddenly, however, the* prelim
inary work on the Â¦ contemplated lines
ceased and the statement was given
out that nothing further would be
That some big corporation is now
behind the North Shore road is a sus
picion that is general, and of all the
large railroad concerns that would
likely seek business affiliation with
the coast road, the Santa Fe Company
is regarded as the only one that would
be advantageously benefited by such
a move. In his recent annual report,
President E. P. Ripley of the Santa Fe
Company, in referring to the purchase
by the corporation of the two small
roads running out of Eureka, made
this statement: '
Just what caused President Martin's
visit to the East is not Known beyond
those associated with him in the rail
road. It was given out at the time of
his departure that he was going to be
gone for several months, but he had
been in the East only a few weeks when
the news reached here that he was on
his way back, and hardly had he
reached town before the story of the
acquirement of a new working capital
was a matter of comment.
SIGNIFICANT. REPORT.
Following closely upon this story is
another that the coffers of the North
Shore road have been lately enriched
to the extent of $1,000,000. and that dur
ing the coming season, as soon as con
struction gangs can be engaged in out
door work, important extensions are to
be made on the road. President John
Martin of the North Shore road, who
has just returned from a hurried trip
to New. York, admitted this much last
evening. In reply to a question as to
whether this money had been secured
by a further issuance of bonds he said
that no bonds had been Issued, but that
the money had been raised without any
great trouble and .that the greater part
of it would be used during the coming
year in work- along the coast, the na
ture of which, he said, he was not at
this time prepared to state.
MOBE WORKING CAPITAL.
Stories of an alliance between the
San Francisco and Northwestern Rail
way, the corporation under whose title
the Santa Fe Company purposes to
build a road down the coast from the
north, and tha North Shore road,
whereby tho terminal facilities of -the;
latter concern wiir eventually be shared
by the former, are going the rounds of
railroad and local financial circles. In
fact, the story haa been considered of
sufficient importance to the officials of
the Southern Pacific Company to war
rant a thorough investigation, but
whether the inquiries made by the
agents of President Harriman have re
sulted in the development of confirma
tory results is a matter that lies within
the Bounds of General Manager Krutt
schnitt's office. This much is known,
however: The Southern Pacific man
agement is satisfied that the Santa Fe
Company has recently effected some
kind of arrangement with the North
Shore road representatives by which,
if it la so Inclined, It can merge its
proposed new coast line with that of
the North Shore, connecting the two
at Cazadero, and thereby give the Santa
Fe a quick route from Eureka to the
bay and advantageous connections with
San Francisco.
