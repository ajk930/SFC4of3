CHAPTER XII.
PLANS FOR THE JOURNEY EAST.
Until late In the afternoon they rode
through: a land that was bleak and bar
ren * of all grace or cheer. The dull
browns and grays of the landscape wero
unrelieved by any green or freshness save
close by the banks of an occasional
stream. The vivid blue of a cloudless
sky served only to light up its desolation
to greater disadvantage. It was a grim
unsmiling land, hard to like.
"This may be God's own country," said
Percival once, looking but over a stretch
of gray sagebrush to a mass of red sand
stone Jutting up, high, sharp and ragged.
In the distance â 'out it looks to me as if
he - got tired of It himself and gave up
before It wan half finished."
"A man has to work here a few years
to love It," said Uncle Peter, shortly.
As they left the car at Montana City in
the early dusk, that thriving metropolis
had never seemed so unattractive to Per
cival; so rough, new, garish, .and. want-
Ing so many of the softening charms of
the East. Through the wide, . unpaved
streets, lined with their low Â¦ wooden
buildings, they drove to the Bines man
sion, a landmark in the oldest and most
fashionable part of the town. For such
distinctions are made in Western towns
as soon as the first two chanties are built.
The Bines house had been a monument
Throckmorton? Give her my love and
ask her if she can be ready to Btart for
the effete East in twenty minutes."
It was his habit to affect that he con
stantly forgot his mothcr'3 name. He
had discovered years before that he was
sometimes able thus .to puzzle her mo
mentarily.
"Why, Percival V\ exclaimed this excel
lent lady, coming hurriedly from the
kitchen regions," "I haven't a thing

It was an infirmity of Mrs. Bines that

"Oh, weU<" he; exclaimed with a show
of irritation.' "I suppose we'll be delayed
then. That's like a. woman. Never ready

after dinner,' Now hurry! You know that

âI hope you won't be seasick.", v ;
"Boatâ dockâ ". Mrs. .Bines stopped to

â¢'Never.- mind,'.' said Psyche; "give ma
half an hour's notice and she can start
for any old place." ' .. y
'â¢'Can't she though!", and Percival, seiz
ing his ; astounded mother. : waltzed j with
her. down the hall, leaving her at the far
end with profusely, polite assurances that
he would bring j her Immediately a lemon
Ice, an Ice pick and a cold roast turkey
with pink stockings on. -â¢;
. "Never mind, Mrs.' Cartwrlgbt," he
called back; to; herâ "oh,"; beg pardonâ
Bliys? Â° yes, yes," to be sureâ well, \l never
â¢ mind, Mrs. Brennlngs. 'We'll, give you
that new-fangled horseless piano and play
It to death."
Uncle Peter meant the new automatic
piano in the parlor. As far as the new
cabinet was from the what-not this mod
ern bit of mechanism was from the old
cottage organâ the latter with its "Cas
ket of Household Melodies" and the for
mer with its perforated paper repertoire
of "The World's Best Music," ranging
without prejudice from Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony to "I Never Did Like a Nigger
Nohow," by a composer who shall be un- v
named on this page.
."And Uncle Peter won't have any one to
bother him when he makes a litter with
all those old plans and estimates and
maps of his." said Psyche; "you'll be able
to do a lot more work. Uncle Peter, this
winter."
"Yes; only I ain't got any more work
to do than I ever had. and I always man
aged to do that, no matter how you did
clean up after me and mix up my papers.
I'm like old Nigger Pomeroy. He was
doln*. a job of whltewashln' one day and
he had an old whitewash brush with most
of the hair gone out of it. I says to him,
â¢Pomeroy, why don't you- get you a new
brush? You could do twice as much
work. And Pomeroy says, 'That's right,
Mr. Bines, but the trouble Is I ain't got
twice as much work to do/ 8o don't you
folks icet out on my account," he con
cluded politely.
"And you know we shall be In mourn
ing." said Psyche to her brother.
"I've thought of that. We can't do any
entertaining, except' of the most Informal
kind, and we can't go out except very In
formally; but then, you know, there
aren't many people that have us on their
lists, and while. we're keeping quiet we
shall have a chance to ret acquainted a
little." . \ '
In due time they were rattling over a
tangled maze of switches, dodging inter
minable, processions of freight cars, bare
ly missing crowded passenger trains
whose bells struck clear and then flatted
as the trains flew by, defiling by narrow
waterways crowded with small shipping,
winding through streets lined with high,
gloomy warehouses, amid the clang and
clatter, the strangely sounding bells and
whistles of a thousand industries, each
sending up Its Just contribution of black
smoke to the pall that lay always spread
above, and steaming at last Into a great
roomy shed, where all waa system and
where the big engine trembled.and panted
as If In relief at having run In safety a
gauntlet so hazardous. ':/ â¢ .'-.-:
"Anyway. I'd rather live In Montana
City than Chicago," ventured Mrs. Bines.
"Whatever pride you may feel In your
discernment, Mrs. Cadwallader. Is amply
Justified," replied her son, performing be.
fore the amazed lady a bow that lndl-
And even Mrs. Bines was not without
a sense of quiet and rest Induced by the
gentler contours of the landscape through
which they now sped.
"The country here does seem a lot
cozier," she admitted.
The hills rolled away amiably and re
assuringly: the wooded slopes In their gay
coloring of autumn Invited confidence.
Here were no forbidding stretches of the
gray alkali desert, no grim bare moun
tains, no solitude of desolation. It was a
kind of land fat with riches. The shorn
yellow fields, the capacious red barns, tha
well-conditioned homes, all told eloquent
ly of peace and plenty. So. too, did the
villagesâ those lively little clearing-houses
for Immense farming districts. To tha
adventurer from New York they seem al
ways new and crude. To our travelers
from a newer, cruder region they were
actually esthetic In their suggestions of
an old and well-established civilization.
"Why, Percival," exclaimed his mother,
reprovingly, "do you mean to say there
aren't 'any Christians In Montana City?
How you talk! There are lots of good
Christian people tn- re. though I must
say I have my doubts about that new
Christian Science Church they started last
spring."
"The- term, Mrs. Thorndlke, was used
In Its social rather than Its theological
significance." replied her son, urbanely.
"Far be It from me to Impugn the religion
of that community of which we are ceas
ing to be Integers at the pleasing rate of
sixty miles an hour. God knows they need
their faith In a different kind of land
hereafter!"
"She's goln'." he continued. In answer
to Perdval's look of Inquiry, "to take her
bank-roll to New York. She says It's the
only place fur folks with money. Jest Ilka
you say. ,She tells Coplen that there
wa'n't anv fit society out here at allâ no
advantages fur a lady of capacity .and
ambitions. I reckon she's goln* to be 402
all right."
"Seems to me she did pretty well here;
I don't see any kicks due her."
"Yes, but she's like all the rest. The-
West was good .enough to make her
money In. but the East gets her when
tpendln' time comes."
As the train started he swung himself
off with a sad little "Be good to your
self!"
"Thank thÂ« Lord we're under Tray at
last!" cried Percival, fervently, when the
group at the station had been shut from
view.
"Isn't It Just heavenly!" exclaimed his
sister. "Think of having all of New York
you wantâ being at home there â and not
having to look forward to this desola
tion- of a place."
Mrs. Bines was neither depressed nor
elated. She was maintaining that calm
level of submission to fate which had been
her lifelong habit. -The Journey and the
new life were to be undertaken because
they formed for her the line of least re
sistance along which all energy must
flow. Had her children elected to camp
for the remainder of their days In the cen
ter of the desert of Gobi, she would have
faced that life with as little sense of per
sonal concern and with no more misgiv
ings.
Down out of the maze of hills the train
wound; and then by easy grades after
two davs of travel down off the great
plateau to where the plains of Nebraska
lay away to a far horizon In brown bil
lows of withered grass.
Then came the crossing of the sullen,
sluggish Missouri, that highway of an
earlier day to the great Northwest: and
after that the better wooded and better
settled lands of Iowa and Illinois.
"Now we're getting where Christians
live." BaM Percival, with warm appre
ciation.
It was mid-October. The two saddle
horses and a team for carriage use had
been shipped ahead. In the private car
the little party was beginning Its own
Journey eastward. From the rear plat
form they had watched the tall figure of
Uncle Peter Bines standing in the bright
autumn sun. aloof from the band of ker
chief-wavlng friends, the droop of his
head and shoulders showing the dejection
he felt at seeing them go. He had resist
ed all entreaties to accompany them.
His last Injunction to Percival had been
to marry early.
"I know your stock and I know you."
he said, "and you got no call to be ran
gin' them pastures without a brand. You
never waa meant for a maverick. Only
don't let the first woman that comes
rldin* herd get her Iron on you. No man
fcnows much about the critters, of
course, but I've noticed a few things In
my time. You pick one that's full-chest
ed, that's got a fairlsh-slzed nose, and
that likes cats. The full chest
means, she's healthy. the nosa
means she ain't finicky, and likin*
cats means she's kind and honest and un
selfish. Ever notice some women when a *
cat's around? They pretend to like 'em
Â¦nd sav 'Nice kitty!' but you can see
they're vlewin" 'em with bitter hate and
suspicion. If thev have to stroke 'em
they do It plenty gingerly and you can
see 'em shudderln' inside like. It means
they're catty themselves. But when one
grabs a cat up as If she was goln" to eat
It and cuddles It In her neck and talks
baby-talk to It, you play her for beln*
sound and true. Pass up the others, son.
"And speakin* of the fair sex," he add
ed, as he and Percival were alone for a
moment, "that enterprlsln* lady we set
tled with Is goto* to do one thinr you'll
approve of.

RISING SUN.
CHAPTER XIII.
"And so r laid out to nurse my appe
tite, and aggravate It by never glvin' it
quite all it wanted. When I was In the.
hills after a day's tramp I'd let it have
its fling on such delicacies as I could turn
out of the fryin'-pan myself, but when I
got in again I'd begin to act bossy with
it. It's wantin' reasonably that keeps
folks alive, I reckon. The mls-a-blest
folks I've ever saw was them that had
killed all their wants by overfeedin' 'em.
"Then, again, son. in this world of hu
man faiiln's there ain't anything ever can
be as pure and blameless and satlsfyln'
as the 6tuff In a bake-shop window looks
like it is. Don't ever furget that It's Jest
too good to be true. And In the next
placeâ pastry"" good In Its .way. but the
best you can ever get Is what's made fur
you at homeâ I'm talkin* about a lot of
things now that you don't probably know
any too much about. Sometimes the boys
out in the hills spends their time dream-
In* fur other things besides pies and
cakes, but that system of mine holds good
all through the dealâ you can play it from
soda to bock and not lose out. And that's
why I'm outlastin* a lot of the boys and
still gettin* my fun out of the game.
"It's a good system for you. aon. while
you're learnln* to use your head. Your pa
played it at first, then he cut loose. And
you need it worse'n ever he did. If I got
you sized up right. He touched me on one
side, and touched you on the other. But
you can last longer If you Jest keep the
system In mind a little. Remember what
I say about the window stuff."
Percival had listened to the old man's
stcry with proper amusement, and to the
didactics with that feeling Inevitable
to youth which says secretly, as It
affects to listen to one whom It does
not wish to wound, "Yes, yes. I know,
but you were living In another day, long
ago, and you are not me!"
He went over to the desk and began to
scribble a name on the pad of paper.
"If a man really loves one woman he'll
behave all right," be observed to Uncle
Peter. ' ' V
"It took jest three weeks fur me to get
right inside again. Mv. but meat victuals
and all like that did taste mignty scrump
tious when I could handle them again.
"After that when I'd been out In the
hills fur a season I'd get that hankerin"
back, and when I come in I'd have a lit
tle frosted-cake orgy now and then. But
I kep' myself purty well in hand. I never
overdone It like that again, fur you see
I'd learned something. First off, there
was the appetite. I soon see the gist of
my fun had been the wantin' the stuff,
the appetite fur it, and if you nursed an
appetite along and deluded it with prom
ises it would stay by you like one of them
meacbm* yellow dogs. But a3 soon as
you tried to do the good-fairy act by it.
and give it all it hankered fur. you killed
It off. and then you wouldn't be enter
tained by it no more, and kep' stirred up
and busy.
"Fur fo^r days I led a life of what
they call 'unbridled licentiousness' while
that Chink pendered to me. I never was
any hand fur drink, btit I cut loo*e in

j=awdust instead of corn-meal, and by

twelve of the chickens had wooden legs
and the thirteenth was a woodpecker.
Say. I felt so much like two cords of
four-foot stove wood that it made me
plumb nervous to ketch sight of a saw
buck.
"That meal *et me back $34 7a. When I
went out I noticed the plain sponge cakes
and lruit cakes and dried-apple piesâ
thir.ps that had been out of my reach fur
twenty yean*, andâ My! but they did

jflly. and a. bunch of little round ones
with frostin' and raisins, and a bottle of
brandied peaches, and about a dozen

"The third day it was gone and a lemon
ric was there, all with nice kind of
brownish snow on top. I was on my way
out then, pushin' the mule. I took one

made by my bag of beans.

"Don't let that bother you, ma," her
son reassured her. "We'll go to the High

twice as large now. and we'll take a suite,

"I almost dread It," his mother rejoined.
"I never did see how they kept track of

Cheer up, ma; It's always darkest just
before leaving Chicago, you know."
Thus flippantly do some of the younger
eons of men blaspheme this metropolis
of the mid-Westâ a city the creation oi
which is. by many persons of discrimina
tion, held to be tha chief romance and
abiding miracle of the nineteenth cen
tury.
Let us rejoice that one such partisan
â¢was now at hand to stem the torrent ol
abuse. As Percival held back the door foi
his sister to pass out, a stout little rud
dy-faced man with trim gray side whis
kers came quickly up the steps and barred
their way with cheery aggressiveness.
"Ah! Mr. Hlgbeeâ well, well!" ex
claimed Perclval. cordially.
"Thought it might be some of you folks
when I saw the car," said Hlgbee, shak
ing hands all around.
"And Mrs. Bines, too! and the girl,
looking like a Delaware peach when th<?
crop's 'failed.' How's everybody, and
how long you gulng to be in the good old
town?"
"Ah! we were Just speaking of Chicago
â¢as you came in." said Perclval. blandly.
"Isn't she a great old town, though â a
wonder!"
"My boy," said Higbee, in low, solemn
tones that came straight from his heart,
"she gets greater every day you live,
You can see 'her at it, fairly. How long
since you been here?"
"I came through last June, you know,
after I left younr yacht at Newport."
"Yes, yes; to be sure; so you didâ poor
Daniel J. â but say, you wouldn't know
the town now If you haven't seen It since
then. Why, I run over from New York
every thirty days or so and Â«-he growa
out of my ken every time, like a five
year-old boy. Say, I've got Mrs. Hlgbee
up in the New York sleeper, but if
you're going to be here a spell we'll
stop a few days longer and I'll drive you
aroundâ what say?â packing-housesâ Lake
Shore driveâ Lincoln Parkâ"
He waited, glowing confidently, as one
submitting irresistible temptations.
Percival beamed upon him with moist
eyes.
"By Jove. Mr. Hlgbee! that's clever of
youâ it's royal. Sis and I would like noth
ing betterâ but you see. my poor mother
here is almost down with nervous pros
tration and we've got to hurry her to New
York without an hour's delay to consult
a specialist. We're afraid"â he glanced
anxiously at the astounded ?>Irs. Bines,
and lowered his voice â "we're afraid she
may not be with us long:."
"Why, Percival," began Mrs. Bines,
dazedly, "you was Just sayingâ"
"Now, don't fly all to pieces, ma!â take
It easyâ you're with, friends, be sure of
that. You needn't beg us to go on. You
know we wouldn't think of stopping when
it may mean life or death to you. You
see. just the way she is," he continued to
the sympathetic Higbee â "we're afraid
she may collapse any moment. So we
must wait for another time, but I'll tell
you what to do. Go get Mrs. Hlgbee and
your traps and come let us put you up
to New York. We've got lots of room
ârun along now â and we'll have some of
that ham. 'the kind you have always
bought,' for lunch. A. L. Jackson Is a
miserable cook, too, if I don't know the
truth."
Gently urging Hlgbee through the door,
he stifled a systematic inquiry into the
details of Mrs. Bines' affliction.
"Come along quick! I'll go help you and
we'll have Mrs. Higbee back before the
train starts."
"Do you know." Mrs. Bines thoughtfully
observed to her daughter, "I sometimes

CHAPTER XIV.
MR. Â«IGBEE COMMUNICATES SOME
VALUABLE INFORMATION.
The Hlgbees were presently at home In
the Bines car. Mrs. Higbee was a pleas
ant, bustling, plump little woman,
gparkling-Â«yed and sprightly. Prominent
In her manner was a helpless little con
fession of inadequacy to her. ambitions
that made her personality engaging. To
be energetic and friendly, and deeply ab
sorbed in people who bold and con
fident, was her attitude.
She began bubbling at once to Mrs.
Bines and Psyche of the latest fashions
for mourners. Crepe was more swagger
than ever before, both as trimming and
for entire costumes.
"House gowns, my dear, and dinner
gowns, made entirely of crepe In the prin-
cesse style, will exactly suit your daugh
terâand on the dinner gowns she can
wear a trimming of that dull Jet passe
menterie."
From gowns she went naturally to the
difficulty of knowing whom to meet In a
city like New Yorkâ and how to meet
themâ and the watchfulness required N to
keep daughter Millie from becoming en
tangled with leading theatrical gentle
men.
Amid PercivaTa lamentations that he
must so soon leave for Chicago, tha train
moved slowly out of the big shed to
search In the Interwoven puzzle of tracks
for one that led to the East.
As they left the center of the city Hlg
bee drew Percival to one of the broad
side windows.
"Pull up your chair and sit here a min
ute," he said, with a mysterious little air
of importance. "There's a thing this
train's going to pass right along here that
I want you to look at. Maybe you've seen
better ones, of courseâ and then again "
It proved to be a sign some twenty feet
high and a whole block long. Emblazoned
upon Its broad surface was "Higbee's
Hams." At one end and towering another
ten feet or so above the mammoth let
ters was a white-capped and aproned chef
abandoning his mercurial French tem
perament to an utter frenzy of delight
over a "Higbee's Ham" which had ap
parently just been vouchsafed to him by
invisible benefactor.
"There, now!" exclaimed Higbee; "what
do you call thatâ I want to knowâ hey?"
"Great! Magnificent!" cried Percival,
with the automatic and ready hypocrisy
of a sympathetic nature. "That certainly
Is great."
"Notice the size of It?" queried Higbee,
when they had flitted by.
"Did I!" exclaimed the young man re
proachfully. - â¢
"We went by pretty fastâ you couldn't
see it well. I tell you the way they're
allowed to run trains so fast right here
In this crowded city Is an outrage. I'm
blamed if I don't have my lawyer take it
up with the Board of Aldermenâslaugh
tering people on their tracks right and
leftâ you'd think these railroad companies
owned the earthâ But that sign, now.
Did you notice you could read every let
ter in the label on that ham? You
wouldn't think it was a hundred yards
back from the track, would you? Why,
that label by actual measure is six feet
four Inches across â and yet It looks as
emailâ and everything all In the right
proportion. It's wonderful. It's what I
call art," he concluded, In a slightly dog
matic tone.
"Of course It's art," Percival 1 agreed;
"erâ allâ hand-painted. I suppose?"
"Sure! that painting alone, letters and
all, cost four hundred and fifty dollars.
I've Just had it put up. I've been after
that place for years, but It was held on
a long lease by Max, the Square Tailorâ
you know. You probably remember the
sign he had thereâ 'Peerless Pants Worn
by Chicago's Best Dressers' with a man
in his shirt sleeves looking at a new pair.
Well, finally. I got a chance to buy those
two back lots, and that give me the site,
and there she is, all finished up. That's
partly what I coma on this time to see
about. How*d you like the -wording 'of
that sign?"
"Fineâ simple and effective," replied
Percival.
"That's itâ simple and effective. It goes
right to the point and it don't slop over
beyond any, after it gets there. We
Etudied a good deal over that sign. The
other man, the tailor, had too many
words for the board space. My advertisin*
man wanted it to be, first, 'Higbee's
Hams' That's AH.' But, I don't knowâ
for so big a space that seemed to me
kind ofâ wellâ kind of flippant and undig
nified. Then I got it down to 'Eat Hig
bee's Hams.' That seemed short enough
âbut after studyln' it, I says. What's the
use of saying 'eat'? No one would think,
I says, that a ham is to paper the walls
with or to stuff sofa cushions withâ so
off comes 'eat' as being superfluous, and
leving it simple and dignifiedâ 'Higbee's
Hams.'
"By the way," said Perclval. when they
were sluing together again later in the
day, "where is Henry now?"
Hlgbee chuckled.
"That's the other thing took me back
this timeâ the new sign and getting Hank
started. Henry Is now working ten hours
a day out to the packing-house. After a
year of that he'll be taken into the of
fice and his hours will be cut down to
eight. Eight hours a day will seem like
sinful idleness to # Henry by that time."
Perclval whistled in amazement.
"I thought you'd be surprised. But the
short of It Is, Henry found himself facing
work or starvation. He didn't want to
starve a little bit, and he finally conclud
ed he'd rather work for his dad than any
one else.
"You see. H-nry was doing tha Rake's
Progress act there in New Yorkâ being- a
gilded youth and such lme. Now being
a gilded youth and *a well-known man
about town' Is something that wants to
be done In moderation, and Henry didn't
seem to know the meaning of the word.
I put up something like a hundred and
eighty thousand dollars for Hank's gliding
last year. Not that I grudged him the
money, but it wasn't doing him any.good.
He was making a monkey of himself with
it, Henry was. A good bit of that hun
dred and eighty went into a comic opera
company that was one of the worst I
ever did see. Henry had no Judgment.
He was too easy. Well, along this sum
mer he was on the point of making a
break that wouldâ well, I says to him,
says I, 'Hank, I'm no penny-squeezer; I
like good stretchy legs myself,' I says;
'I like to see them elastic so they'll give
a plenty when they're pulled; but,' I
says, 'if you take that step.' I says, 'If
you declare yourself, then the rubber In
your legs.' I says, 'will pust naturally
snap; you'll find you've overplayed the
tension,' I says, 'and there won't be any
more stretch left In them.'
"The secret Is, Hank was being chased
by a whole family of wolvesâ that's the
gist of Itâ fortune-huntersâ with tushes
like the ravening lion In Afric'a gloomy
Jungle. They were not only cold, stone
broke, mind you, tut hyenas into the bar
gainâthe father and tha mother and tha
girl. top.
"They'd got their m!nuÂ° made up to
marry the girl to a good wad of moneyâ
and they'll do It, too, sooner or later, be
cause she's a corker for looks, all rightâ
and they'd all made a dead set for Hank;
bo, quick as I saw how It was, I says,
'Here.' I says, 'is where I save my son
and heir irom a passel of butchers,' I
pays, 'before they have him scalded and
dressed and hung up outside the shop
for the holiday trade.' I says, 'with the
red paper rosettes stuck In Henry's chest,'
I says."
"Are the New York girls so designing?"
asked Perclval.
"Is Higbee's ham rood to eat?" replied
Hlgbee, oracularly.
"So," he continued "when I mada up
my mind to put my foot down I just cas
ually mentioned to the old ladyâ say, she's
got an eve that would make liquid air
shiverâ that cold blue like an army over
coatâwell. I mentioned to her that Henry
was a spendthrift and that he wasn't
ever going to get another cent from ma
that be didn't earn Just the same as if
he wasn't any relation of mine. I made
It plain, you bet; she found Just where
little Henry-boy stood with his kind
hearted, liberal old father.
"Say, maybe Henry wasn't In cold stor
age'with the whole family from that mo
ment. I see those fellows in the labora
tories are puttering around Just now try-
Ing to get the absolute zero. of tempera
tureâsay, Henry got it, and he don't
know a thing aDout chemistry.
"Then I jounced Hank. I proceeded
to let him know he was up against
itâ right close up against It, so you
against it, so you couldn't see daylight
between 'em. 'You're twenty-flve." I says,
â¢and you play the best game of pool, I'm
told, of any of the chappies In that
Father-Made-the-Money club you got in
to,' I says; 'but I've looked it up,' I says,
'and there ain't really what you could
call any great future for a pool cham
pion,' I says, 'and If you're ever going to
learn anything else, it's time you was at
It,' I says. 'Now you go back home and
tell the manager to. set you to work,' I
says, 'and your wages won't be big
enough to make you interesting to any
skirt-dancer, either,' I says. And you
make a study of the hog from the ground
up. Exhaust his possibilities just like
father done, and make a man of your
self, and then some time." I says, 'you'll
be able to give good medicine to a cub
of your own when he needs it.' "
"And how did poor Henry take all
that?"
"Well, Hank squealed at first like he
was getting the knife; but finally when
he see he was against It, and especially
when he see how. this girl and her family
throwed him down the elevator-shaft
from the tenth story, why, , he come
around beautifully. He's really got sense,
though he; dosen't look Itâ Henry hasâ
though'Lord knows I didn't pull him up a
bit too quick. But â¢ he come out arid
went to work like I told^him. He ain't
so fat-headed as he was, already. Henry'H
be a man before his dad's through with
him."
"But weren't the young people disap
pointed?" asked Perclval; "weren't they
In love with each other?"
"In love?" In an effort to express scorn
adequately Mr. Hlgbee came perilously
near to snorting. "What do you suppose
* a girl like that cares for love? She was
dead In love with the nice- long yellow
backs that I've piled up because the pub
lic knows good ham when they taste It.
As for being In love with Henry or with
any man â say, young fellow, you've got
something to learn about those New York
girls. And this one, especially. Why, it's
been known for the three years we've
been there that she's simply hunting
night and day for a rich husband. She
tries for 'em all as fast as they get In
line." . Â¦
"Henry . was unlucky In finding that
kind. They're npt ; all like thatâ those
New York girls are not." and he had the
air of being able if he chose to name one
or two luminous exceptions. .
"Silas." called Mrs. Higbee, "are^ you
telling Mr. Bines about our Henry and
that Milbrey girl?"
"Yep,", answered Higbee, "I told him."
"About what girl?â what was her
name?" asked Percival, in a lower tone.
"Milbrey's that family's nameâ Horace
Milbreyâ"
"Why," Percival interrupted, somewhat
awkwardly. "I know the family â the
young ladyâ we met the family . out in
Montana a few weeks ago."
"Sure enoughâ they were In Chicago and
had dinner with us on their way out."
"I remember Mr. Milbrey spoke of .what
fine claret you gave him." Â¦ >
"Yes, and I wasn't stingy with ice,
either, the way those New York people
always are. Why, at that fellow's house
he elves you that claret wine as warm
as soup.
"But as for that girl." , he added, "say,
she'd marry me in a minute if I wasn't
tied up with the little lady over there.
Of course she'd rather marry a sub-treas
ury; she's got about that much heart in
herâ cold-blooded as a German carp. She'd
marry meâ she'd ' marry you, If you was
the best thine in sight. But say. if you
was broke, she'd have about as much use
for you as Chicago's got for St. Louis."
CHAPTER XV.
SOME LIGHT WITH A FEW SIDE
LIGHTS.
The real spring In New York comes
when blundering nature has painted the
outer wilderness for autumn. What is
called "spring" In the city by unreflect
ing users of the word is a tame, Insipid
season yawning into not more than half
wakefulness at best. The trees in the
gas-poisoned soil are slow in their green
ing, the grass has but a pallid city vital
ity and the rows of gaudy tulips set out
primly about the fountains in the squares
are palpably forced and alien.
For the sumptuous blending and flaunt
of color the spontaneous awakening of
warm, throbbing new life, and all those
Inspiring miracles Â«of regeneration which
are performed elsewhere In April and
May. the city pent must wait until mid-
October.
This Is the spring of tha city's year.
There be those to hint captiously that
they find It an affair of false seeming;
that the gorgeous coloring Is a mere trick
of shop-window cunning: that the time Is
juiceless and devoid of all but the spe
cious delights of surface. Yet these, per
haps, are unduly imaginative for a world
where any satisfaction Is held by a ten
ure precarious at best
And even these carpers, be they never
so analytical,. can at least find no lack of
springtime fervor in the eager throngs
that pass entranced before the window
show. They, the free-swinging, quick
moving men and womenâ the best dress
ed of all throngs In this young' worldâ
eun-browned, sun-enllyened, recreated to
a fine mettle for enjoyment by their
months of mountain or ocean sportâ these
are, Indeed, the ones for whom this after
eprlng is made to bloom. And, since they
find it to be a shifting miracle of perfec
tions, how are they to be quarreled with?
In the big polished windows waxen
effigies of fine ladies, gracefully patient,
display the latest dinner-gown from Paris
or the creamiest of beribboned tea-gowns.
Or they pose in attitudes of polite adleux
and greeting, all but smothered in a
king's ransom of sable and ermine. Or,
to the other extreme, they complacently
permit themselves to be observed in tha
intimate revelations of Parisian lingerie,
with Its misty froth of embroideries, its
fine-spun webs of foamy lace.
In another window, behold a sprightly
and enlivened ballet of shapely silken
hosiery, fitting its sculptured models to
perfection, ranging In tints from the first
tender green of spring foliage to the
rose-pink of the spring sun's after-glow.
A few steps beyond we may study a
window where the waxen ladies have
been dismembered. Yet a second glance
shows the retained portions to be all that
woman herself considers Important when
she tries on the bird-toque of the picture
hat, or the gauze confection for after
noons. The satisfied smiles . of these
waxen counterfeits show them to hava
been amply recompensed, with the head
gear, for their, physical incompleteness.
But If these terraces of color and grace,
that Una the' sides of this narrow spring
valley, be said to contain only the dry
husks of adornment, surely there may be
found others more technically spring
like. '
Here in this broad window, foregather
ed In a congress of colors designed to
appetlze, are, the. ripe fruits of every
clime and every - season: .the Southern
pomegranate beside the hardy Northern
apple, scarlet and yellow; the early
strawberry and the late ruddy peach;
flgs from the -Orient and pines from the
Antilles; dates from Tunis and tawny
persimmons from Japan; misty sea-green
grapes and those from Â¦ the hothouse
tasteless, it Is true, but so lordly In their
girth, and royal purple; portly golden
oranges and fat plums; pears of mellow
blondness and pink-skinned apricots. Here
at least Is the veritable stuff and essence
of spring with all its attending aromasâ
of more integrity, perhaps, than the same
colorings simulated â¢ by the confection
er's craft, in the near-by window-display
of Impossible, sweets. Â¦
And still more of this belated spring
will gladden the eye In the florist's win
dow. In June the florist's shop is a poor
place, sedulously to be shunned. Nothing
of note blooms there then. The florist him
self is patently ashamed of himself. Tha
burden of sustaining his traditions he
puts upon a few dejected shrubs called
"hardy perennials" that have to labor the
year around. All summer it Is as if the
place feared to compete with nature when
color and grace flower so cheaply on
every southern hillside. But now Its
glories bloom anew, and its superiority
over nature becomes again manifest. Now
It . assembles the blossoms of a whole
long. year to bewilder and allure. Its
windows are shaded glens, vine-embower
ed,' where spring, summer and autumn
blend In all their regal and diverse abun
dance; and the closing, door of the shop
fans out odors as from a thousand Per
sian gardens.
But spring Is not all of life, nor what at
once chiefly concerns us. There are peo
ple to be noted; a little series of mora
or less related phenomena to be observed.
One of tha people, a young man, stands
conveniently before this tame florist's
window, at that hour. when tha sun brief
ly flushes this narrow canyon of Broad
way from wall to Wall.
Ha had loitered along the lively high
way an hour or more, his nerves tingling
responslvely to all Its stimuli. And now
he mused as . he stared at the tangled
tracery of -ferns against the high bank
i of wine-red, autumn foliage, . the royal
i cluster of white chrysanthemums and tha
big Jar of American Beauties. .. :
. He had looked forward to this moment,
Â¦ tooâ when he should enter that same door
. and , order at least an armful of those
same haughty roses sent to an address
his memory cherished. Yet now, the time
having come, the zest for the feat was
gone.. It -would be done; It were ungrace
ful not to] do lt, J after certain expressions;
but It would*. be done with no heart be
cause of Â¦.the; certain knowledge that no
oneâ at Ieaat.no one to be desiredâ could
possibly care for him, or consider him
even with; interest for anything but- his
moneyâ the same kind of money Higbee
made. ' by perveylng hamsâ "and she
wouldn't care In the least whether it was.
mine or- Higbee's, so there was a lot of
it," \ ,: . â¢ ,.-_ ; â¢-
Yet he stepped in and ordered the roses,
nor did the florist once suspect that so
lavish a buyer of flowers could be a prey
to emotions of corroding cynicism toward
the person, for. whom they were meant.
From the , florist's he returned directly
to the hotel to find his mother and Psyche
making homelike the suite to which they
had been assigned. A maid was unpack
ing trunks. under* his sister's supervision.
Mrs. Bines was, tn< converse with a person
of authorttatlve^mariner regarding tha
Bervlce to be supplied them. ..Two maids
would be required, and madame would
' or course wish a .butler-â "^ -t i *Â¦*:Â¦
'Mrsi'BInes looked .helplessly at her son
who had Just entered; . ; .
"I thinkâ we'veâ we've always-, did our
own buttling," she faltered. ' " r - â¢â¢â¢ -'si
The person was politely Interested.
"I'll attend to these things, ma," : said
Perclval, rather suddenly. â¢
"YÂ«s, wÂ«'ii want a butler and. tha two
maids, and see that the butler knows his
business, please, andâ hereâ take this, and
see that we're properly looked after, will
you?"
As tha bill bora a large "C on its face,
and the person was ratner a gentleman
anyway this. unfortunate essay at Irreg
ular conjugation never fell into a certain
class of anecdotes which Mrs. Bines' best
friends could now and then bring them
selves to relate of her.
But other matters . are forward. We
may next overtake two people who loiter
on this bracing October day down a leaf
strewn aisle In Central Park.
"You," -said the girl of the pair, "least
of all men can accuse me of lacking
heart."
"You are cold to me now."
"But look, tuinkâ what did I offerâ
you've had my trust â everything I could
bring myself to give you. Look what I
would have sacrificed at your call. Think
how I waited and longed for that call."
"You know how helpless I was." ,
"Yes, If you wanted more than my bare
self. I should have <Â»en helpless too, if
I had wanted more thanâ than you."
"It would- have been follyâ madnessâ
that way."
"Follyâ madness? Do you remember
the 'Sonnet of Revolt* you sent me? Sit
on this bench: T wish to say it over to
you, very slowly; I want you to hear It
while you keep your later attitude in
mind.
Life_ w hÂ«t Is life? To do without avail*
The decent ordered tasks of every day:
Talk with the sober; Join the solemn play:
Tell for tie hundredth time tha self -same
tale
Told by our rrandslrea In the self-same vale
Where the sun sets with even, level ray.
And nights, eternally the same, make way
For huelesa dawns, t Intolerably paleâ
"But I know the verse."
"No; hear lt*outâ hear what you- sent
me: Â¦â¢>
"And this Is life? Nay. I would rather Â«eÂ«
The man who sells his soul in some wild
cause: ...
The fool who spurns, for momentary bliss.
All that he was and all he thought to be:
The rebel utark against his country's laws:
God's own mad lover, dying on a kiss."
She had completed -the verse with the
hint of a cneer in her, tones. ,
"Yes, truly, I remember It; but some
day -ou'll thank me for saving you; of
course it . would ' have been regular In - a
way, but people here never really forget
those thingsâ and we'd have . been help

"Why do' vou believe l'Â«* not thanking
you already?"
"Hang It all! that's what you mada me
think yesterday wnen I met you."
"And so you called me heartless? Now
tell me just what you expect a woman in
my position to do. I offered to go to you
when you were ready. Surely that showed
my. spiritâ arid you haven't known me
these years without knowing It would
have to be that or nothing." .
"Well, hang It. It wasn't 'like, the last
time, and - you , know it; you're not kind
any longer. You can be kind, can't you?"
Her Up showed faintly the curl of scorni -
"No,- 1 can't be klnd'any. longer; : Oh, I
see you've known your own mind so little; -
there's- been no depth to it at all; you
couldn't dare. If was foolish to think I
could show you my mind."
"But you still care for me?"
"No; no, I don't. You should have no
reason to think so if I did. When I heard
you'd made it up I hated you. and I think
I hate you now. Let us go back. No, no,
please don't touch meâ ever again."
Farther downtown In the cozy drawing
room of a house In a side street east of the
avenue two other persons were talking.
A florid and profusely freckled young
Englishman spoke protestingly from the
hearth rug to a woman who had the air
of knowing emphatically better.
"But, my dear Mrs. Drelmer. you know,
really, I can't take a curate with me, you
f know, and send up word won't she be
good enough to come downstairs and mar
ry me directlyâ not when /I've .not seen
her, you know!"
"Nonsense!" replied the lady, unim
pressed. "You can do it nearly that way
if you'll listen to me. Those Westerners
perform quite in that manner, I assure
you. They call it 'hustling.' "
"Dear me!"
"Yes, Indeed, 'dear you.' And another
thing, I want you to forestall that Mil
brey youth, and you may be sure he's no
farther away that Tuxedo .or Meadow
brook. Now, they arrived yesterday;
they'll be unpacking to-day and settling
to- morrow; I'll call the day after, and
you shall, be with me."
"And you forget thatâ that devilâsup
pose Bhe'a as good as her threat?"
"Absurd! how coulS she be?"
"You don't know her, you know, nor
the old beggar, either, by Jovs!"
"All -the more reason for haste. We'll
call to-morrow. Wait. Better still, per
haps I can enlist the Gwllt-Athelston; I'm
to meet her to-morrow. I'll let you know.
Now I must get Into my tea harness, so
run along."
We are next constrained to glance at a
strong man bowed in the hurt of a great
grief. Horace Milbrey sits alone In his
gloomy, hlgh-celllnged library. His attire
is immaculate. His slender, delicate hands
are beautifully white. The sensitive lines
of his fine face tell of the strain under
which he labors. What dire tragedies are
those we must face wholly aloneâ where
we must hide the wound, perforce, be
cause no comprehending sympathy flows
out to us; because instinct warns
that no help may come save from the
soul's own well of divine fortitude. Some
hope, tenderly, almost fearfully held and
guarded, had perished on the 'day that
should have seen Its triumphant fruition.
He raised his handsome head from the
antique, claw-footed desk, sat up in his
chair, and stared tensely before him. His
emotion was not to be suppressed. Do
tears tremble in the eyes of the strong
man? Let us not Inquire too curiously.
If they tremble down the flne-sklnned
cheek, let us avert our gaze. For grief
In men Is no thing" to make a show of.
A servant passed the open door bearing
an immense pasteboard box with one end
cut out 'to accommodate the long stems
of many roses.
"Yes, sir!"
"What ia It?"
"Flowers, sir. for Miss Avice."
"Let. -me seeâ and the card?"
'He took the card from the florist's en
velope.and glanced at the name.
'"lake them away." .
The .stricken' man was once more alone;
yet now It was as if. the tender beauty of
the '.flowers, had balmed his hurtâ taught
him, to hope anew. Let us In all sympathy
and hope retire.
For cheerf uller. sights we might observe
Launton Oldaker In a musty curio-shop,
delighted over a pair of silver candle
sticks with square bases and fluted col
umns, fabricated in the reign of that for
tuitous'monarch,. Charles the Second: or
we. might glance upon the Hlgbees in
their section of a French chateau, repro
duced up on the stately Riverside Drive,
where they complete the details of a din
ner to be given on the morrow.
Or perhaps It were better to be con
cerned with a matter more weighty than
dinners and antique candlesticks. The
search need never be vain, even in this
world of persistent frivolity. As, for ex
ample:
"Tell Mrs. Van Gelst If she can't coma
down, I'll run up to her."
"Yes, Miss Milbrey.'*
Mrs. Van Geist entered a moment later.
"Why, Avice, child, you're glowing,
aren't you?"
"I must be, I supposeâ I've Just walked
down from Fifty-ninth street, and before
that I walked In the Park. Feel how cold
my cheeks areâ Mutterchen."
"It's good for you. Now we shall have
some tea. and talk."
"Yesâ I'm hungry for both, and some of
those funny little. cakes."
"Come back where the fire Is. dear; the
tea has just been brought. There, take
the bis: chair."
"It always feels like youâ Ilka your
arms, Mutterchenâ and I am tired."
"And throw off that coat There's the
lemon, if you're afraid of cream."
"I wish I weren't afraid of anything
but cream."
"You told me you weren't afraid of that
âthat cadâ anv more."
"I'm notâ I just told him so. But I'm
afraid of It all: I'm tired trying not to
driftâ tired trying not to try, and tired
trying to tryâ Oh, dearâ sounds like a
nonsense verse, doesn't it?* Have you
any one to-night? I think I must
stay with you till morning. Send some
one home to say I'll be here. I can al
ways think so much better hereâ and you,
dear old thing, to mother me!"
"Do, child; I'll send Sandon directly."
"He will go to the house of mourning."
"What's the latest?"
"Papa was on the verge of collapse this
morning, and yet he was striving so
bravely and nobly to bear up. No one
knows what that man suffers; it makes
him gloomy all the time about every
thing. Just before I left he was saying
that, when one considers the number of
American homes In which *a green salad is
never served, one must be appalled. Are
you appalled, auntie? But that isn't It."
"Nothing has happened?"
"Well, there'll be no sensation about it
In the papers to-morrow, but a very
dreadful thing has happened. Papa has
suffered one of the crudest blows of his
life. I fancy he didn't sleep at all. last
night, and he looked thoroughly bowled
over this morning."
"But what Is it?"
"Wellâ oh. it's awful!â first of all there
were six dozen of .early-bottled, 1S75 Cha
teau Lafltteâ that was the bitterestâ but
he had to see the rest go. tooâ Chateau
Margeaux of 'SOâ some terribly ancient
port and Madeiraâ the dryest kind . of
sherryâ a lot of fine, full clarets of "77 and
'78â oh, you can't know how agonizing it
was to himâ I've heard . them so often I
know them all myself."
"But what on earth about them?"
"Nothing, only the Cosmopolitan Club's
wine cellarâ auctioned off, you know. For
over a year papa has looked forward to It.
He knew every bottle of wine in it. He
could recite the list without looking at it.
Sometimes he sounded like a French les
sonâand he's been under a fearful strain
ever since the announcement was made.
Well, the great day came yesterday, and
poor pater simply couldn't bid In a single
drop. It needed ready money, you know.
And he had hoped so cheerfully all tho
time to do something:. It broke his heart,
I'm sure, to see that Chateau Lafltte goâ
and only Imagine, It was bid In by the
butler of that odious Hlgbee. You should
have heard papa rail about the vulgar
nouveaux riches when he came homeâ ho
talked quite like an anarchist. But by to
night he'll be blaming: me for his misfor
tunes. That's why I chose to stay here
with you." â¢
"Poor Horace. Whatever are you ga
ins to do?"
"Weil, dearie, as for me. It doesn't look
as if I could anything but one thing. And
here is my ardent young Croesus coming
out of the West."
"You called him your 'athletic Bayard'
once."
"The other's more to the point at pres
ent. And what else can I do? Oh. If some
one wou!d just be brave enough to live
the raw, quivering life with me, I could
do it, I give you my word. I could let
everything go by the boardâ but I am so
alone and so helpless, and no man Is equal
to It nowadays. All of us here seem to be
content to order a 'half portion' of life."
"Child, those dreams are beautiful, but
they're like those flying machines that
are constantly being tested by the credu
lous inventors. A wheel or a pinion goes
wrong and down the silly things coma
tumbling."
"Very well; then I shall be wiseâ I sup
pose I shall beâ and I'll do It quickly.
This fortune of good gold shall propose
marriage to me at once, and be acceptedâ
so that I shall be able to look my dear
old father In the face againâ and then,
after I'm marriedâ well, don't blame ma
for anything that happens."
"I'm sure you'll be happy with himâ
It's only your silly notions. He's la love
with you."
"That makes me hesitate. He really Is
a manâ I like himâ see this letterâ a long
review from the Arcady Byre of the
'poem* he wrote, a poem consisting of
'Avice Mllbrey.' The reviewer has been
quite enthusiastic over It, tooâ written
from some awful place In Montana."
"What more could you ask? He'll be.
kind."
"You don't understand. Mutterchen. He
seems too decent to marry that wayâ and
yet It's the only way I could marry him.
And after he found me outâ oh. think of
what marriage Isâ he'd have to find It out
âI couldn't act long-doubtless ha
wouldn't even be kind to me then."
"You are morbid, child."
"But I will do it; I shall; I will bÂ« a
credit to my trainingâ and I shall learn to
hate him and he will have to learnâ well,
a great deal tlut he doesn't know about
women."
She stared Into the fire and added, after
a moment's silence:
"Oh, If a man only could live up to the
verses he cuts out of magazines!"
CHAPTER XVL
WITH THE BARBARIC HOSTS.
History repeats Itself so cleverly, with
ft variance of stage-settings and acces
sories so cunning, that the repetition sel
dom bores, and Is, Indeed, frequently un
detected. Thus, the descent of the Barb
arians upon a decadent people Is a little
tour de force that has been performed
again and again since the oldest day.
But because the assault nowadays Is
made not with force of arms we are
prone to believe it is no longer made at
allâ as if human ways had changed a
bit since those ugly, hairy tribes from
the Northern forests descended upon the
Roman empire. And yet the mere dif
ference that the assault is now mada
with force of money In no way alters
the process nor does It permit the result
to vary. On the surface all Is cordiality
and peaceful negotiation. Beneath is the
same immemorial strife, the llfe-and
death struggleâ pitiless, inexorable.
What would have been a hostile biv
ouac within the city's gates, but for tha
matter of a few centuries, is now, to se
lect an example which remotely concerns
us. a noble structure on Riverside Drive,
facing the lordly Hudson and the ma
jestic Palisades that form Its farther
wall. And. for the horde of Goths and
Visigoths. Huns and Vandals, drunkenly
reeling in the fitful light of camp-fires,
chanting weird battle-runes, fighting for
captive vestals, and bickering in uncouth
tongues over the golden spoils, what hava
we now to make the parallel convince?
Why, the same Barbarians, actually; tha
same hairy rudeness, the same unrefined,
all-conquering, animal force; a red-faced,
big-handed lot. Imbued with hearty good
nature and an easy tolerance for tha
ways of those upon whom they hava de
scended.
Here are chiefs of renown from tha far
thest fastnesses; they and their curious
households; the Ironmonger from Pitts
burg, the gold-miner from Dawson. tha
copper chief from Butte. the silver chief
from Denver, the cattle chief from Okla
homa, lord of three hundred thousand
good acres and thirty thousand cattle,
the lumber prince from Â¦ Michigan, the
founder of a later dynasty In oil. from
Texas. And, for the unaesthetlo but
effective Attila, an able fashioner of pork
products from Chicago.
Here they make festival, carelessly,
unafraid, unmolested. For, In the lapsa
of time, the older peoples hava learned
not only the folly of resisting inevitables,
but that the huge and hairy Invaders
may be treated and bartered with not
unprofltably. Doubtless it often results
from this amity that the patrician strain
Is corrupted by the alien admixtureâ
but business has been business since aa
many as two persons met on the face of
the new earth.
For example, this particular shelter la
builded uoon land which one of tha pa
trician families had held for a century
solely because It could not be disposed of.
Yet the tribesmen came, clamoring for
palaces, and now this same land, with
some adjoining areas of trifling extent,
produces an Income that will suffice to
maintain that family almost In Its ancfent
and befitting estate.
In this mammoth pile, for tha .petty
rental of ten or fifteen thousand dollars a
year, many tribes of the Invaders hava
found shelter and entertainment In apart
ments of many rooms. Outwardly, In de
tails of ornamentation, the building is
said to duplicate tha Chateaux Blots,
those splendid palaces of Francis I. In
side are all the line and color and device
of elegant opulence, modern to the last
note.
To this palace of an October evening
comes the tribe of Bines, and many an
other such, for a triumphal feast in tha
abode of Barbarian Silas Hlgbee. Tha
carriages pass through a pair of lordly
Iron gates, swung from massive stone pil
lars, under an arch of wrought Iron with
its antique lamp, and into the echoing
courtyard flanked by trim hedges of box.
Alighting, the barbaric guests of Hlg
bee are ushered through a marble-walled
vestibule, from which a wrought iron and
bronze screen gives way to the main en
trance hall. The celling here reproducesTHE /SUNDAY CALL.

"CConcIud>ed Next Sunday.)
that of a feudal castle in Rouen, with
tome trifling and effectU-e touches of dec
oration in blue, scarlet and gold. The
walls are of white Caen stone, with or
nate windows and balconies jutting out
altove. In one corner Is a stately etone
mantel with richly carved hood, bearing
In its central ranel the escutcheon of the
gallant French monarch. Up a little
flight of marble steps, guarded by Its
hand rail of heavy metal, shod with crim
*on velvet, one reaches the elevator. This
pretty enclosure of iron and glass, of
classic detail in the period of Henry II. of
Circassian walnut trim. w!th crotch pan
els, has more the aspect of boudoir than
elevator. The deep seat is of walnut, up
holstered with fat cushions of crimson
velvet edged in dull gold galloon. Over
the seat is a mirror cut into small squares
by wooden muntins. At each side are
electric candles softened by red silk
Ehades. One's last view before the door
closes noiselessly is of a bay window op
posite, set with cathedral glass casement
lights, which sheds soft colors upon the
hall bench of carven stone and upon che
tessellated floor.
The door to the Higbee domain is of
polished mahogany, set between lights of
antique verte Italian glass, and bearing
Â¦ n ancient brass knocker. From the re
ception room, with Ub walls of green em
pire silk, one passes through a foyer
hall, of Cordova leather hangings, to
the drawing-room with Us three broad
windows. Opposite the entrance to
this superb room is a mantel of
carved Caen stone, faced with golden
Tavanazza marble, with old Roman and
irons of gold ending in the fleur-de-lis.
The walls are hung-*Vith blue Floren
tine siik. embossed In sliver. Beyond a
bronze grill Is the music-room, a library
done In Austrian oak with stained burlap
paneled by dull-forged nails, a conserva
tory, a billiard-room, a smoking-room.
This latter has walls of red damask and
a mantel with "Post Tenebras Lux" cut
into one of it* marble panelsâ a legend
at which the worthy lessee o. all this
splendor is wont often to glance with re
spectful interest.
The admirable hostâ if one be broad
mindedâis now In the drawing-room, sec
onding his worthy wife and pretty daugh
ter who welcome the dinner guests.
For a man who has a fad for ham and
doesn't care who knows It, his bearing Is
all wp have a right to expect that It
should be. Among the group or arrivals,
men of his own sort, he is speaking of
the ever-smfting fashion in beards, to the
evangel of a Texas oil neld who flaunts
to the. world one of those heavy mus
taches spuriously extended below the cor
ners of the mouth by means of the chin
growth of hair. Another, a worthy tribes
man from Snobomish, Washington, wears
a beard which, for a score of years has
been let to be its own tfue self: to ex
press, fearlessly. Its own unique capacity
for variation from type. These two have
rallied their host upon his modlshly
trimmed sidewhlskers.
"You're right." says Mr. Higbee. amia
bly. "T ain't stuck any myself on this way
of trlmmine up a nan's face, but the
madam will have it this wayâ says it
locks more refined and New Yorky. And
now, do you know, ever since I've wore
'em this wayâ ever since I had 'em
scraped from around under my neck here
âI have to go tÂ« Florida every winter.
Tome January or February, I get bron
chitis ev*rjr blamed year!"
Two of the guests only are alien to the
barbaric throne-
There Is the noble Baron Ronault de
Palliac. decorated, reserved, observantâ
almost trfstfcl. For the moment he Is
picturing dutifully the luxuries a certain
marriage would enable him to procure for
his noble father and bis aged mother, who
eaperly await lae news of his nuect for
the golden fleece. For the Baron contem
plate?, after the fashion of many con
scientious explorers, a marriage with a
native woman; though he permits himself
to rheriFh the hope that It may not be
â¢conditioned upon his adopting the man
ners and customs of the particular tribe
that he means to honor. Monsieur the
Baron has long since been .obliged to con
fess that a Pitiable mesalliance is none
too easy of achievement, and. in testi
mony of his vicissitudes, he has written
for a Paris comic paper a series of grimly
satiric essays upon New *ork society.
Recently, moreover, he has been upon the
v*>rge of accenting employment in the
randy factory of a 1 .urgeols compatriot.
But hope has a little revived In the noble
hr^ast since chance brought him and his
title under the scrutiny of the bewitching
Miss Mlllicent Higbee and her apprecia
tive mother.
"How qucerly you talk. Where Is Ipew
York, then?"
Oldaker. sighed thoughtfully between
two spoonfuls of tortue verte. claire.
"Well. I suppose the truth is that there
isn't much of New York left in New
York. As a matter of fact I think it died
with the old Volunteer Fire Department.
Anyway the surviving remnant is coy.
Real old New Yorkers like myself -nether
poo- nor richâ are swamped in these days
like those prehistoric animals whose
bones we find. There comes a time when
we can't live, and deposits form over
us and we're lost even to memory."
But this talk was even harder for Miss
Bines to understand than the English
speech of the Baron Ronault de Palliac,
and she turned to that noble gentleman
as the turbot with sauce Corall was
served.
The dining-room, its wall walnscotted
from floor to ceiling In Spanish oak, was
flooded with soft light from the red silk
dome that depended from its crown of
gold above the table. The laughter and
talk were as little subdued as the scheme
cf the rooms. It was an atmosphere ot'
prodigal and confident opulence. From
the music-room near by came the soft
strains of a Haydn quartet, exquisitely
performed by finished and expensive
artists.
"Say, Higbee!" it was the oil chief from
Texas, "see if them fiddlers of yours can't
play 'Ma Honolulu Lulu!'"
Oldaker, wincing and turning to Miss
Binc3 for sympathy? heard her say:
"Yes. do, Mr. Higbee! I do love those
ragtime songsâ and, then have them play
'Tell Me. Pretty Maiden.' and "the 'Inter
mezzo.* "
He groaned in anguish. ;
The talk ran mostly on practical affairs;
the current value of the great staple com
modities: why the corn crop had been
light: what wheat promised to bring:
how young Burman of \the Chicago Board
of Trade bad been pinched in his own
wheat corner for four millionsâ "put up"
by his admiring father; what beef on the
hoof commanded; how the Federal Oil
Company would presently own the State
of Texas.
Almost everj' Barbarian aKthe table
had made his own fortune. Hardly one
but could recall early days when he toiled
on farm or In shop or forest, herded cat
tle, prospected, sought adventure In re
mote and hazardous wilds.
" 'Tain't much like them old days, eh
Higbee?" queried the Crown Prince of
Cripple Creek â "when you and me had to
walk from Chicago to Green Bay. Wiscon
sin, because we didn't have enough shil
lings for stage fare?" He gazed about
him suggestively.
"Cornbeef and cabbage was pretty good
then, eh?" and with sure, vigorous
strokes he fell to demolishing his filet de
dinde a' la Perlgueux, while a butler re
filled his glass with Chateau Malescot,
1STS.
"Well, it does beat the two rooms the
madam and me started to keep house in
when we was married." admitted the
host. "That was on the banks of the
Chicago River, and now we got the Hud
son flowln' right through the front yard,
you might say, right past our own yacht
landing."
From old days of work and hardship
they came to discuss the present and
their immediate surroundings, social and
financial.
lly portraits tone agreeably Into the half
light of the wklls; the huge old-fashioned
walnut sideboard, soberly ornate with
its mirrors, its white marble top and its
wood-carved fruit, tower* majestically
aloft in proud scorn of the frivolous
Chippendale fad.
Jarvis, the accomplished and incompar
able butler, would be subdued and schol
arly looking but for the flagrant scandal
of his port-wine nose. He gives finishing
little fillips to the white chrysanthemums
massed in the central epergne on
the long silver plateau, and bestows
a last cautious survey upon the
cut-glass and silver radiating over
the dull white damask. Finding
the table and Its appointments
faultless, he assures himself once more *
that the sherry will come on Irreproach
ably at a temperature of 60 degrees; that
the Burgundy will not fall below 65 nor
mount above 70; for Jarvis wots of a pal
ate so acutely sensitive that It never falls
to record a variation of so much as one
degree from the approved standard of
temperature.
How restful this quiet and reserve after
the color and line tumult of the Higbee
apartment. There the flush and bloom of
newness were oppressive to the right
minded. AH smelt of the shop. Here the
dull tones and decorous lines caress and
soothe Instead of overwhelming the Im
agination with effects too grossly literal.
Here Is the veritable spirit of good form.
Throughout the house this contrast
might be noted. It is the brown-stone,
high-stoop house, guarded by a cast-iron
fence, built in vast numbers when the
world of fashion moved north to Murray
Hill and Fifth avenue, a generation ago.
One of these houses was like all the
others inside and out, built of unimagina
tive "builder's architecture." The hall,
the long parlor, the back parlor or li
brary, the high stuccoed ceilingsâ not only
were these alike in all the houses, but the
furnishings, too, were apt to be of a
sameness in them all, rather heavy and
tasteless, but serving the ends that such
things should be meant to serve, and
never flamboyant. Of these relics of a
simpler day not many survive to us, save
in the shameful degeneracy" of boarding
houses. But in such as are left, we may
confidently expect to llnd the traditions of
that more dignified time kept unsulliedâ
to find, indeed, as we find in the house of
Milbrey, a settled air of gloom that sug
gests insolvent but stubbornly determined
exclusiveness.
Something of this air, too, may be
noticed in the surviving tenants of these
austere relics. Yet it would hardly be
observed in this house on this night, for
not only do arriving guests bring the aro
ma of a later prosperity, but the hearts
of our host and hostess beat high with a
new hope. For the fair and sometimes
uncertain daughter of the house of Mil
brey, after many ominous mutterings. de
lays, and frank rebellions, has declared
at last her readiness to be a credit to her
training by conferring her family pres
tige, distinction of manner and charms of
person upon one equipped for their suita
ble maintenance.
Already her Imaginative father is rav
ishing in fancy the moldiest wine-cellars
of Continental Europe. Already the fond
mother has idealized a house in "Million
aire's Row." east of the park, where
there v.ill be twenty servants Instead of
three, and there shall cease that gnawing
worry lest the treacherous north-setting
current sweep them west of the park Into
one of those hideously new apartment
houses, where the halls are done in mar
ble that seems to have been sliced from
a huge Roquefort cheese, and where one
must vie, perhaps, with a shopkeeper for
the favors of an irreverent and material
istic janitor.
The young woman herself entertains
privately a state of mind .which k
she has no intention of making public. It
is enough, she reasons, that her action
should outwardly accord with the best
traditions of her class; and. indeed, her
family would never dream of demanding
more.
If we be forced' to wait for another
guest of note, it is hardly more than her
due; for Mrs. Gwilt-Athelstan Is truly a
personage, and the best people on more
than one continent do not become unduly
provoked at being made to wait for her.
Those less than the very best frankly
Â¦ esteem it a privilege. Yet the great lady
is .not careless of engagements, and the
f wait Is never prolonged. Mrs. Milbrey
has time to say to her sister, "Yes,* we
think it's going; and really, it will do
very well, you know. The girl has had
some nonsense In her mind' for a year
past â none of us can tell what â but now
she seems actually sensible, and she's
promised to accept when the chap pro
poses." But there's time for no more
- gossip. vVl % " '
The belated guest arrives, enveloped in
a vast cloak, and accompanied by her
two nephews, whom Percival Bines rec
ognizes for the solemn and taciturn young
men he had met in Shepler's party at the
mine.
Mrs. Gwilt-Athelstan. albeit a decora
tive personality, is constructed on the
same broad and generously graceful lines
as her own victoria. The great lady has
not only two chins, but what any fair
minded observer would accept as suffi
cient promise of a good third. Yet hardly
could a slighter person display to advan
tage the famous Gwllt-Athelatan Jewels.
The rope of pierced diamonds with
pigeon-blood rubles strung between them,
which she wears wound ' over her cor
sage, would assuredly overweight the
frail Fidelia Oldaker; the tiara of emer
alds and diamonds was never meant for
a brow less majestic; nor would the
stomacher of lustrous gray pearls and
glinting diamonds ever have clasped be
comingly a figure that was svelteâ or
"skinny," as the great lady herself is
frank enough to term all persons even re
motely inclined to be svelte.
But let us sit and enliven a proper din
ner with talk upon topics of legitimate
Interest and genuine propriety.
Here will be no discussion of the vulgar
matter of markets, staples and prices,
such as we perforce endured through the
overwined and too-abundant repast of
Higbee. Instead of learning what
beef on the hoof brings per hun>
dred-weight, f. o. b. at Cheyenne, we
shall here glean at once the Invaluable
fact that while good society In London
used to be limited to those who had been
presented at court, the presentations nave
now become so numerous that the limita
tion has lost Us significance. Mrs. Gwilt-
Athelstan thus discloses, as if it were a
trifle, something we should never learn
at the table of Higbee though we ate his
heavy dinners to the day of ultimate
chaos. And while we learned at that dis
tressingly new table that one should keep
one' heifers and sell off one's steer calves,
we never should have been Informed there
that DInard had Just enjoyed the gayest
season of Its history under the patron
age of this enterprising American; nor
that J-adv de Muzzy had opened a tea
room in Graf ton street, and Cynthia,
Marchioness of Angleberry, a beauty im
provement parlor on the Strand "because
she needs the money."
*\L,ots of 'em takin' to trade nowadays;
it's h smart sayin' there now that all
the peers are marryin* actresses and all
the peeresses goln* into business." Mrs.
Gwilt-Athelstan nodded little shocks of
brilliance from her tiara and hungrily
speared another oyster.
"Only trouble Is. it's such rotten hard
work collectin' bills from their intimate
friends: they simply won't pay."
Nor at the barbaric Hlgbee's should we
have been vouchsafed, to treasure for our
own, the knowledge that Mrs. Gwilt-
Athelstan had merely run over for the
cup fortnight, meaning to return directly
to her daughter. Katharine, Duchess of
Blanchmere. In time for the Melton Mow
brav hunting season; nor that she had
been rather taken by the new way of
country life among us. and so tempted
to protract her gracious sojourn.
"Really." she admits, "we're comin' to
do the right thing over here; a few years
were all we needed. Hardly a town house
to be opened before Thanksglvin', I un
derstand: and down at the Hills some of
the houses will stay open all winter. It's
coachln', rldln* and golf and auto racin*
and polo and squash; really the young
folks don't go In at all except to dance
and eat: and it's quite right, you know.
It's quite decently Knglish.now. Why. at
Morris Park the other day. the crowd on
the lawn looked quite like Ascot ac
tually."
one of the class I mean. I was thinking
especially about these Westerners."
"Well, my grandfather made -the best
barrels in New York, and I'm mother-in
law of a chap whose ancestors for 350
years haven't done a stroke of work; but
he's the Duke of Blanchmere, and I hope
our friends here will come as near gettin'
the worth of their money as we did. And
If that chap"â she glanced at Percivalâ
"marries a certain young woman, he'll
never have a dull moment I'd vouch for
that. I'm quite sure she's the devil in
her."
"And If the yellow-haired girl marries
the fellow next herâ"
"He might do worse."
"Yes, but might she? He's already do
ing worse, and he'll keep on doing it, even
If Jie does marry her."
' "Nonsenseâ about that, you know; all
rot! What can you. expect of the.se
chaps? So does the Duke do worse, but
you'll never' hear Kitty complain so long
as he lets her alone and she can wear the
strawberry leaves. I fancy I'll have those
young ones down to the Hills for Hal
lowe'en and the week-end. Might as well
help 'em along."
At the other end of the table, the fine
old ivory of her cheeks gently suffused
with pink until they looked like slightly
crumpled leaves of a la France rose. Mrs.
Oldaker was flirting brazenly with Shep
ler, and prattling impartially to him and
to one of the twin nephews of old days in
social New York; of a time when the
world of fashion occupied a little space
at the Battery and along Broadway; of
its migration to the far north of Great
Jones street, St. Mark's place and Sec
ond avenue. In Waverly place had been
the flowering of her bellehood. and the
day when her set moved on to Murray
Hill was to her still recent and revolu
tionary. . i
Between the solemn Angstead twins,
Mrs. Bines had sat in silence until by
some happy chance It transpired tnat
"horse" was the word to unlock her lips.
As Mrs. Bines knew all about horses the
twins at once became voluble, showing
her marked attention. The twins were
notably devoid of prejudice If your sym
pathies happened to run with theirs.
Miss Bines and young Milbrey were al
ready on excellent terms Percival and
Miss Milbrey, on the other hand, were
doing badly. Some disturbing element
seemed to have put them aloof. Miss
Milbrey wondered somewhat, but her
mind was easy, for her resolution had
been taken.
Mrs. Gwilt-Athelstan extended her In
vitation to the young people, who accept
ed Joyfully.
"Come down and camp with us, and
help Phim keep the batteries of his autos
run out. You know they deteriorate
when they're left half-charged, and it's
one of the cares of his life to see to the
whole six of 'em when they come In. He
gets in one and the men get In the others,
and he leads a solemn parade around the
stables until they've been run out. Tell
me the leisure class Isn't a hard-workin*
class, now'."
Over coffee and chartreuse in the draw
ing-room there was more general talk
ot money and marriage, and of one for
the other.
"And so he married money." concluded
Mrs. Gwilt-Athelstan of one they had
discussed.
"Happy marriage!" Shepler called out.
"No; money talks! and this time, on
my word, now, it made you want to put
on those thick sealskin ear muffs. Poor
chap, and he'd been talkin' to me about
the monotony of married life. 'Monoto
ny, my boy," I said to him. *you don't
know lovely woman!' and now he wishes
jolly well that he'd not done it, you
know."
Here. too. was earned by' Mrs.
Bines a reputation for wit that she
was never able quite to destroy.
There had been talk of a banquet to a
visiting celebrity the night before,
for which the menu was one of unusual
costliness. Mr. Milbrey had dwelt with
feeling upon certain of Its eminent ex
cellences, such as loin of young bear, a la
Granville, and the boned quail, stuffed
with goose livers. \.
"Really," he concluded, "from an artis
tic standpoint, although large dinners are
apt to be slurred and slighted. It was a
certain creation of undoubted worth."
"And the orchestra," spoke up Mrs.
Bines, who had read of the banquet,
"played 'Hail to the Chef!"
The laughter at this sally was all it
should have been, even the host joining
in it. Only two of those present knew
that the good woman' had been warned
not to call "cher* "chief," as Silaa Hig
bee did. The fact that' neither should
"chief" be called "cher* was Impressed
upon her later, in a way to rnafce her re
solve ever again to eschew both of the
troublesome words.
When the guests had gone Miss Milbrey
received the praise of both parents for
her blameless attitude toward young
Bines.
"It will be fixed, when we come back
from Wheatly," said the knowing young
woman, "and now don't worry any more
about It."
"And, Fred." said the mother, "do keep
straight down there. She's a common
place girl, with lots of mannerisms to un
learn, but she's pretty and sweet and
teachable/' \
"And shVll learn a lot from Fred that
she doesn't know now," finished . that
young man's sister from the foot of the
stairway., Â¦ â¢
Back at their hotel Psyche Bines was
saying:
"Isn't It queer about Mrs. Gwllt-Athel-
Btan? We've read so much about her in
the papers. I thought she mU3t be some
one awful to meetâ I was that scaredâ and
instead, she's 11km any one. and rear
chummy besides: and, actually, ma, don't
you 'think -her dress was dowdyâ all ex
cept the diamonds? I suppose that comes
from living' In Engjand so much. And
hasn't Mrs. Milbrey twice as grand a
manner, and the: sonâ he's a preciousâ he
knows everything and everybody; IÂ»shall
like him."
Her brother, who had flung himself into
a cushioned corner, spoke with the air of
one who had reluctantly consented to be
Interviewed and who was anxious to be
quoted correctly:,.
"Mrs. Gwi:t-Athe!stari is ail right. She
reminds me of what Uncle Peter writes
about that new herd of short-horns: 'This
breed has a mild disposition. Is a good
feeder and produces a flne quality of
flesh.' But I'll tell you 7 one thing, sis."
he concluded with sudden emphasis, "with
all this talk about marrying for money
I'm beginning to feel as If you and I were
a couple of white rabbits out In the open
with all the game laws off!"
CHAPTER XVIII.
Among sundry maxims and observa
tions' of King Solomon, collated by the
discerning men of Hezeklah. it will be re
called that the way of a maid is held up
to wonder. "There be." says the wise
king. who. composed a little in the crisp
manner of Mr. Klplins, /'three things
which are too wonderful for me: yea, four
which I know not: the way of an. eagle
In thÂ« air: the way of a serpent upon a
rock; the way of a ship In the midst of
the sea, ana the way of a man with a
f maid." Why he neglected to Include the
way of a maid with a man is not at once
; apparent.' His unusual facilities for ob
â¢ servatton must seemingly have Inspired
Â» him to wonder at the maid's way even
; more than at the man's; and wise men
: later than he have not hesitated to con
fess their entire lack of understanding
in the matter. But if Solomon incjuded
. this item in his summary, * the men of
Hezeklah omitted to report the fact, and
by their chronicles we learn only that
the woman "eateth and wlpeth her mouth
and salth, 'I have done no wickedness.' "
Perhaps It was Solomon's mischance to
observe phenomena of this character too
much in the mass.
Miss Milbrev's way. at any .rate, with
the man she had decided to marry, would
undoubtedly have made more work for
the unnamed Boswells of the king, could
it have been brought to his notice.
For, as she Journeyed to the meeting
place on a. bright October afternoon, she
confessed to herself that it was of a
depth beyond her own fathoming. Lull
ing easily back in the wicker chair of
the car that bore her, and gazing idly out
over the brown fields and yellow forests
of Long Island as they swirled by her,
J she found herself wishing once that her
eyes were made like those of a doll. She
had lately discovered of one that when
it appeared to fall asleep, it merely turned
its eyes around to look Into Its own head.
With any lesser opportunity for intro
spection she felt that certain doubts as
to bÂ«r own motives and processes would
remain forever unsolved. It was not that
she conld not say "I have done no wick
edness"; let us place this heroine in no
false light. She was little concerned with
the morality of her course as others might
appraise it. The fault, if fault It be. Is
neither ours nor hers, and Mr. Darwin
wrote a big book chiefly to prove that It
isn't. From the force of her environment
and heredity Miss Milbrey had debated
almost exclusively her own chances of
happiness under given conditions; and If
she had. for. a time, questioned the wis
dom of the obvious course, entirely from
her own selfish standpoint, it Is all that,
and perhaps more than, we tfere Justified
in expecting from her. Let her. then.
cheat the reader of no sympathy that
might flow to a heroine struggling for a
high moral Ideal. Merely Is she clear
headed enough to have discovered that
selfishness Is not the thing of easy bonds
it Is reputed to be; that its delights are
not certain; that one does not unerringly
achieve happiness by the bare circum
stance of being uniformly selfish. Yet
even thiÂ« is a discovery not often made,
nor one to be lightly esteemed: for have
not the wise ones of church and state ever
implied that the way of selfishness is a
way of sure delight, to be shunned only
because Its Joys endure not? So It may
be. after all. no small merit we claim for
this girl In that, trained to selfishness and
a certain course, she yet had the wit to
suspect that its Joys have been over-val
ued even by its professional enemies. It
is no small merit, perhaps, even though,
after due and selfish reflection, she deter*
mined upon the obvious course.
If sometimes her heart was sick with
the hunger to love and be loved by the
one she loved, so that there were times
when she would have bartered the world
for Its plenary feeding, it Is all that, we
inslsf. and more, than could be expected
of this sort of heroine.
And so she had resolved upon surrender
âupon an outward surrender. Inwardly
she knew it to be not more than a capitu
lation under duress, whose terms would
remain forever secret except to those
clever at Induction. And, now. as the
train took her swiftly to her fate, she
made the best of it.
There would be a town house fit for her;
a country house at Tuxedo or Lenox or
Westbury; a thousand good acres with
greeneries: a game preserve, trout pond
and race course; a cottage at Newport; a
place in Scotland; a_ house in London,
perhaps. Then there would be Jewels
such as she had longed for. a portrait by
Chartran. she thought. And there was
the dazzling thought of going to Felix or
Doucet with credit unlimited.
And he â would the thought of him as it
had always come to her keep on- hurting
with a hurt she could neither explain nor
appease? Would he annoy her, enrage
her perhaps, or even worse, tire her? He
would be v*ry much In earnest, of course,
and so few men could be In earnest grace
fully. But would he be stupid* enough to
stay fo? And If not, would he become
brutal? She- suspected he might have ca
pacities for that. Would she be able to
hide all but her pleasant emotions from
himâ hide that want, the gTeat want, to
which she would have once done sacri
fice?
Well, it was easier to try than not to
try, and the sacrificeâ one could always
sacrifice if the need became imperative.
But her troubled musings ended with
her time alone. From a whirl over the
crisp, firm macadam, tucked into
one of Phimlster Gwilt-Athelstan's auto
mobiles with four other guests, with no
less a person than her genial host for
chauffeur, she was presently ushered into
the great hall, where a huge log fire
crackled welcome and. where blew a lively
little gale of tea chatter from a dozen
people. '
Tea Miss Milbrey Justly reckoned
among the little sanities of life. Her
wrap doffed and her veil pushed up, she
was in a moment restored to her normal
ease, a part of the group, and making
her part of the talk that touched the
latest news from town, the flower show,
automobile show, Irving and Terry, the
morning's meet, the weekly muslcale and
dinner dance at the club: and at length
upon certain matters of marriage and di
vorce. Â¦ t 'J ,
Nor could we have learned in the hos
tile camp the current gossip of Tuxedo,
kieadowbrook, Lenox, Morristown and
Ardsley; of the mishap of Mrs. "Jlmmle"
Whettln, twice unseated at a recent meet;
of the woman's championship tourna
ment at Chatsworth; or the good points
of the new runner-un at Ualtusrol. daily
to be seen on the links. Where we might
incur knowledge^ of Beaumont "gusher"
or Plttsburg mill we should never have
discovered that teas and receptions are
really falling into disrepute; that a serlea
of dinner dances will be organized by the
mothers of debutantes to bring them for
ward; and that big subscription balls are
in disfavor, since they benefit no one
but the caterers who serve poor suppers
and bad champagne.
Mrs. Gwilt-Athelstan takes only Scotch
whisky* and soda.
"But I'm glad," she confides to Horace
Milbrey on her left, "that you haven't got
to followln' this fad of havln' one wine at
dinner; 1 know it's English, but it's down
right shoddy."
Her host's eyes swam with gratitude for
this appreciation. ; . .
"I stick to my peg." she continued; "but
1 like to see a Chablis with the oysters
and good dry sherry with the soup,. and a
Moselle with the tteh, and then you're
ready to be liveried with a bit of cham

by Burgundy with the game. Phlm sticks
to It, too; tells me my peg is downright
encouragement to the bacteria. But I tell
him I've no quarrel with my bacteria.
'Live and let live' is my motto, I tell him
âand if the microbes and I both like
Scotch and soda, why, what harm. l!m
forty-two and not so much of a fool that
I ain't a little bit of a physician. I know
my stomach, I tell , him."
. "What . about these Western people?"
she asked Oldaker at her other side, after
a little.^ . .
"Decent, unpretentious folks, somewhat
new, but with loads of money."
"I've heard how the breed's stormin'
New York! in droves; but they tell me
some of us need the money."
"I dined with one last night, a sugar
cured ham magnate from Chicago."
"Dear me! how shockln'l"
"But they're good, whole-souled people."
"And well-heeledâ and that's what we
need. It seems. Some of us been so busy
bein'. well-familied that we've forgot to
make money."
"It's a good thing, too. Nature has her
own building laws about fortunes. When
they get too skyscrapy she topples them
over. These people with their thrifty hab
its would have all the money in time if
their. sons and daughters, didn't . marry
aristocrats ' with expensive .tastes who
know how to be spenders. .Nature keeps
things fairly even, one way or another."
"You're thlnkln' about Kitty and the
Duke."
"No, .not then I wasn't, 'though that's
Her gown to-night is of orchard green,
trimmed wi* apple blossoms, a single
pink spray of them caught In her hair.
The rounding, satin grace of her slender
arms, sloping to the opal-tipped lingers,
the exquisite line from ear to shoulder
strap, the inviting ripeness of her chin
and throat, the tender, pink and white of
her fine skin, the capricious, inciting tilt
of her small hrad, the dainty lift of her
short noseâ these allurements she has in
ventoried with a calculating and satisfied
eye. She is glad to believe that there is
every reason why it will soon be over.
And since the whole loaf is notoriously
better than a half, here is the enguging
son of the house, also firmly bent upon
the high emprise of matrimony; hand
some, with the chin, it may be. slightly
receding; but an excellent leader of co
tillons, a surpassing polo player, clever,
winning and dressed with an effect that
has long made him remarked in polite
circles, , which no mere money can
achieve. Money, indeed, if certain Ill
natured gossip of tradesmen be true, has
b^en an Inconsiderable factor in the en
compassment of this sartorial distinction.
He waits now, eager for a first glimpse
of the young woman whose charms, even
by report, have already won the best de
votion he has to give. A grievous error
it Is to suppose that Cupid's artillery is
limited to bow and arrow.
And now, instead of the rude commer
cial horde that laughed loudly and ate
uncouthly at the board of the barbarian
we shall sit at table with people horn to
the only manner- said to be worth pos
sessingâIf we except, indeed, the visiting
tribe of Bines, who may be rellod upon
however, to behave at least unobtrusively.
As a contrast to the oppressively West
ern matron from Kansas City here Is
Mistress Fidelia Oldaker on the arm of
her attentive son. She would be very old
but for the^circumstance that she began
early in Jlfe to be a belle, and age cannot

at her back, books on her head, to guard

man. To-night, at seventy-something, she
Is a bit of pink bisque fragility, bubblln
tirelessly with reminiscence, her vivacity
unimpaired, her energy amazing and her
coquetry faultless. From which we should

ought to go she will never be able to de
part from it.

"Good boy! Good for you," cheered the
self-made Barbarians, and drank success
to the absent disseminator of hardware.
With much loud talk of this unedifying
character the dinner progressed to an
end; through selle d'agneau, floated in '84
champagne, terrapin convoyed by a spe
cial Madeira of 1S50, and canvasback duck
with Romance Contl. 1S65. to a triumpnant
finale of Turkish coffee and 1811 brandy.

Bines, whose dot. the baron has beer
led to understand, would permit his be
loved father unlimited piquet at his club
to say nothing of regenerating the farotlj
chateau. Yet these are hardly matters
to be gossiped of. It Is enough to know
that the Baron Ronault de Palllac, when
he discovers himself at table between
Miss Bines and the adorable Miss His
bee, becomes less saturnine than has foi
nome time been his wont. He does not
forget previous disappointments, but des
perately enaps his swarthy Jaws In com
mendable superiority to any adverse fate.
"Je ne donne pas un damn," he says
to himself, and translates, a* was his
practice, to better his Englishâ "I do not
present a damn. I shall lake what it la
that it may be."
The noble Baron de Palllac at this

Oldaker observed Mis* Psyche Bines
approvingly.
"We are so glad to be In New York!"
she had confided to him, sitting at her
right.
"My dear young woman." he warned
her, **you haven't reached New York
yet." The talk being general and loud,
he ventured further.
"Tills is Pittsburg. Chicago. Kansas
City, Denverâ almost anything bat New
York."
"Of course I know these arc not the
swell old families."
Oldaker sipped his glass of old Oloroso
sherry and discoursed.
"And our prominent families, the ones
whose names you read, are not New
York any more, either. They are rather
London and Paris. Their furniture, cloth
ing, plate, pictures, and servants come
from one or the other. Yes, and their
manners, too. their interests and sym
pathies and concerns, their fashionsâ and

assuredly not New York any more than
Gobelin tapestries and Fortuny pictures
and Louis Seize chairs are New York."

glance at his companion. She was a pret
ty girl with blue eyes, a lovable nose, a
klssable mouth and an Irreproachable
traveling outfit. A look of amusement
crossed his face as he noted the frigidity
of her bearing, for he knew enough of
human nature to be quite positive that
she was thinking of him. Her rigid in
terest in. the scenery on her own side as
sured him of that fact. He unhooked the
indicateur and studied it carefully, and
whÂ»i he stood up to throw it on the
bur.cile rack he felt that her eyes had
been turned his way, bo he sat down
again, folded his arms and waited for
time to pars a little. The possibilities of
French trains are great. Those without
tempers gain them, those with tempers
lose themâ in both cases, one speaks.

It was on a cold, bright, late autumn
<Jay in November that a pretty girl, ap
parently an American, started to get into
the Bellegarde train. Waiting, as if to
enter the came compartment, stood a man
well loaded with valises. Perhaps It was
because he also was an American that
when he saw her helplessly struggling on
the steep, ladder-like steps he immediate
ly put forth a strong hand and raised her
gently to the level above.

She hesitated, and her hesitation was
suddenly swallowed in another roar of en
gulfing blackne-ss.
"Go on." he whispered. (Whispers rush
in where angels fear to tread.)
"Well," she replied slowly, "once before

"Yes," she replied, "and 1 do hope, dear,
that I nevsr in all my life shall be so mud

He kissed her, laughing.
"You were mad," he said, "you were

The valley of the Albarlne; was beg'^

the Rhone, the latter river sweeping
broadly beside the railway, while the
Alps, increasing with each nearer view,
loomed heavily above.
"The finer view Is on this side," he re

head.
"I'll sit on that side If I ever return
this way,", she murmurtd.
The train stopped at Culoz and he left
the car and smoked a cigarette on the
platform of the gare.
When he climbed In again she glanced
at him about half way to his knees, and
he felt he had made some progress.

cheerfully, "the half on the opposite bank

coolly, and turned to the French half.

that he Droposed to go more into society
than he had ever done before.
"What's going on to-night?" he asked.
"There isn't anything," %aid Mrs. Ham
ilton. "There's nothing going on this
week, ar.d at the theater there's nothing
worth seeing except 'The Girl I Left Be

"Well, let's go to that." said Arthur.
When they took their seats in the theater
the orchestra oegan playing the stirring
old tune from which the play was named.
Arthur turned in his seat and looked
about the auditorium. Two rows behind
him sat Angela and her father. Their
eyes met. .Argela smiled and almost
beckoned him to ecrne back and speak to
her. Arthur bowed stiffly and turned to
speak to h!s mother.
The next morning came a note from
Angela. \ ;\- ; : .
"If you can possibly arrange it." ran,
the note. "I wish you'd come up and have
tea with me at 5 o'clock to-day."
It v. as almcst-n command. Arthur went.
She came into the room with both hands
outstretched.
"I am so g;ad to see you," ghe said.
"What a Lad boy you've been not to write
to me!"
Then she looked at his face squarely. in
the lirht.
"Why. Arthur Hamilton!" she cried.
"What's the matter? You look as though
you'd seen a ghost."
"No," he sa'.d. "I've only seen 'The
Girl I I-eft Behind Me.' "
"What do vou mean.?"
"Nothing, only It seems that that Is
just what I am seeing now,", and Arthur
gazed into her eves.
"Do you mean that you heard of my
engagement, and that "
. Argela stopped and blushed.
"Yes. I mean exactly tuat. and I hopÂ«
you will be very happy, ancT that Mrs. Al
lerton is nleased." .
"Look here, boy." Â«ald Angela, uncon
sciously using the old childish name she
used to call him, "do you think I got en
gaged to olease Mrs. Allerton?"
"Well, I thought you were going to
please the family, that wayâ at least,,
not â " Â»
He was getting into deep water. He
turned and started Into the street. iThen
he looked back at Angela. There were
te>ars in her eyes. lie caught her in his
arms.
."Will you please me this way?" he
asked:
"I have always wanted to, boy, always

not far p part, geographically, and on
walks about the Connecticut Valley the
four had fallen Into company. Afterward
there hart been two weddings, and the two
new homes were established in the samJ
Western city. The heads of the families
went Into law practice together, and the
firrruhns la^ltd until this dayâ more than
twt nty-jjve years.
When the children were born it was
ejiiltc natural that the boy should have
been nami d Arthur Selden Hamilton,
after his father's partner, and the girl
Angela Hamilton Selden. after her moth
er's schoolgirl friend and companion. Ar
thur was almost a year older than An
gc'a. and a year la a long time In the lives
of youngsters.
. When, after their high school days, it
was decided that both should go to col
lege, they left home on the same day In
charge of Angela's mother and Arlhur's
father and Journeyed eastward to the
Connecticut Valley.
Afterward Arthur went abroad for a
year's study and Angela went to visit
some friends at an iirmy post further
West. When Arthur came home and
found, instead of the. schoolgirl he had
known, a beautiful young woman, he was
scarcely prepared for the change. It was
all foreordained. While he had seen
pretty women abroad, and at Amherat
had almost proposed to a girl at com
mencement time, he had been practically
heart-free. . This vision of loveliness who
kissed him frankly as a sister might took
his breath away. When he left the 8e!den
home that night it was with the intention
of winning Angela Selden.
All that winter he saw much of he,r. At
the parties they attended, at the theater',
or. wherever he could make an excuse, to
meet her, he was her devoted cavalier. In
both the families it was regarded as a
foregone conclusion that there would be
another marriage to link the two families
yet closer together. Â¦
One evening Arthur called at- the Sel
dens determined to ask Angela to be his.
' "She must know," he thought, "how
much I love her.. If she will have me
I'll take the governor's offer and go
into the business with him risht away.
Arthur climbed the steps which led up
to the Seldens' veranda. On the veranda
sat Angela and a man in uniform.
"Mr. Hamilton," said Angela, "let me
present my friend. Lieutenant Allerton."
They shook hands. Arthur said some
thing about being glad to see Lieutenant
Allerton. Lieutenant Allerton said some
thing about being charmed to meet Mr.
Hamilton.
There was some music, and Allerton
sang". He sang well, and Angela accom
panied him as only a sympathetic musi
cian can. Arthur felt a lover's jealousy.
"Why couldn't he have stayed away till
to-morrow?" hu thought.
When Allerton rose to go he said. "Then
mother and I may expect to meet you on
Tuesday in Chicago?"
"Yes." replied Angela, "and tell your
mother that Tishall give her a great deal
of trouble before me -reach Leavenworth.
for I am going to make her tell me every
thing about her boys at the fort. You
know I fell desperately in love with every
soldier there last summer."
' Arthur stayed for a few minutes after
Allerton had gone.
"Are you going away?" he asked in dis
mry.
"Yes," she replied. "Mrs. Allerton has
asked me to visit her for a month at
Leavenworth. The colonel is the dearest
old men that ever lived, andâ Isn't Charlie
jUBt the handsomest boy you ever saw?"
Arthur said good-by hurriedly and
walked miles into the country smoking
strong cigars. '
The next day he received a little good
by note from Angela, saying that her
father wanted her to go on to Chicago
for a day or two with him, and as he
had been called away suddenly she had
gone. The note continued: -
. But y before October A came Arthur's
father told him that he -had frood reason
for thinking from something tMr. Selden
had said at the office that Angela was en
gaged to Lieutenant Allerton. / ,
Then Arthur had to go to New York on
business for his father for several months.
He heard from Angela once or twice, but
she said nothing about her engagement.
He had fought to quench his love
for her. but the more he fought against
it the harder the task seemed, until nnal

This whs all. very well, but the really unpleasant part of the business was
afterward. whÂ«n Lc-titia Insisted upon my making a cltan breast of the whole .af
fair to Uncle George . *!Â¦-
Uncle George wanted no more persuasion. He drew a crackling roll of notes
from his pocketbook and handed them to me without another word, then tore
the whip from William's shaking hand.
A frantic cut on the sleek whiteness of the plump mare, a frightened plunge
forward of that astonished beast, an ill-suppressed laugh from Letitia, and I
wag left standing in the middle of Kynasjon road with a bundle of bank notes.
A voice from the hedge recalled myscattered wits with a rush.
"You'd better take those things off before any one else comes along." said
Letltla.
I felt very cross and t>egan to drag the wretched things over my head with
out speaking.
"You did It splendidly," went on Letitia. She was almost speechless with
laughter and sat down on the fallen tree again to recover herself.
These compliments did not tend to improve my temper. I handed her the
roll of notes without a word. She took them with evident pleasure and counted
them over., . . Â¦ -Â¦
"He has only given you thirty," she said, "but even that's better than noth
ing. Won't I have a good time now!"
But at last it began to dawn upon her that I was really annoyed. She put her
hand on my arm and looked up at my displeased face with such a charming air
of contrition that my anger melted away like the morning dew. y
"Don't be cross," she said. '"You were an angel to do Itâ you can imagine
how grateful I am."
"No," said I, smiling at last, "I certainly can't. You don't accept It In at all
the DroDGr spirit.* '
Letitia laughed again.
"I think it Is time I was on my way to Kynaston." she said. "I will try to
cultivate a proper spirit as we go alung."
We reached the village all too soon, meeting on the way two of the incompe
tent village policemen, evidently sent by Uncle George. Naturally they didn't rec
ognize the terrible highwayman in a young man in a bicycle suit. AH' in good time
we had the puncture mended.
It was while we were wailing for it that Letitia proposed that I should ride
with her to Mornington and it wa.s then that 1 began to realize what a really de
lightful girl she was. I wished the, day would last forever.
Hut it didn't, and when we stopped for tia at a wayside cottage under a green

Mornington was only eight miles farther on.
We came to Aunt Margaret's house e\en sooner than I had bargained for.
Letilja lumped off her machine aod h#fd out lur hand as I came to her side.
"Gcod-by," she said, "it has b t tn a glorious day, ai:d I'm not a bit tiredâ but
it's all over now." Â¦ f
"This one is over, certainly," I said: "butâ there may be others."
Leiitia shook her head. She seemed to have grown older and more sedate since
the jnbrninjf. But perhaps she was only tired. .
"No," she sa'd slowly, "1 don't think there must be any others."
"Wh> ?" I was/still holding her hand, but she did not seem to notice It.
"I Â»\ink you do understand." she crie-d_ suddenly gaining courage and raising
her heat, "and 1 don't think it is very kind of you to make me tell you. It is be
cause 1 jÂ»m engaged to be married to David Kynaston, and because I like you too
much already."
"1 am glad you have been frank with, me," I said, still holding her hand, "be
cause now I shall not be afraid to tell you my name."
Letitia stared In amazement.
"Why bhould you be afraid to te'.l me your name?"
"Because"â 1 spoke very slowly to give my words the more effect â "because,
according to you ft is the name of a btas>t. My name is David Kynaston, and I
am engaged to be married to you."
I waited till the white mare was less tljan five paces from me. then set my
teeth, and strode bravely into the middle of the road flourishing Letitia's ridic
"Your money or your life!" I said sternly.
Letitla was right. The "firearm," did the work. The white mare was stopped
by a frenzied jerk of the reins. The gallant William, huddled Into the corner of
the seat. Uncle George was pasty-faced, stout and spectacled.
"Wâ wâ what the deuce d'ye want?" he cried at last, in a voice shaken to a
delicate tremolo.
"Fifty dollars?" said I. sepulchrally. gaining fresh courage from the helpless
terror of these two brave men.
This was too much. For an instant Uncle George forgot to be frightened, and
raised his whip threateningly.
"Youâ youâ scoundrel." he cried", "I'll see you hanged before I give you a
penny. William, you fool, whip the mare!"
But William did not move. Uncle George seized the reins, and I saw that
now was the moment to be firm. Besides, for the first time I began to enter into
the true spirit of the game.
Accordingly I strode forward, with flapping wings of mackintosh, to the tall
board of the dogcart, nourished the revolver within one Inch of William's head.
"Fifty dollars," said I, "or I fire!" - /
She considered for a minuteâ then brightened.
"I have got my waterproof cape," she said, "and you have got yours. Put
yours over your head â it will rest on your nose and ears if you are careful,
and you can tie mine around your waist. Then if you pull your cap well over
your eyes, nobody can possibly recognize you."
I sincerely /hoped they wouldn't, as she suited her action to her words, ap
parently with the greatest enjoyment. However, it was too late for regrets now.
Letltla scrambled through a gap in the hedge, and with beating heart I waited
by the roadside. ; .-;; '".-j
Â¦ Suddenly the wretched dogcart appeared on the top of the hill, with â oh.
horror of horrors! â two men on the front seat.
I could hear Letitla's stifled -giggles from the gap in the hedge. I flung a
hurried reproach at the corner of the white sailor hat which appeared in the
opening.
"You didn't say your uncle would bring a man!"
"It's only William." she answered. "He's better than nobody, because he'll
be so terrified that he'll frighten uncle Into fits."

ration, "It Is knight-errantry."
"The law wouldn't call It knight-errantry," I remarked, gloomily.
"Look here," she cried, opening her saddle-bag with trembling fingers, "I
will lend you my revolver," producing a thing about four Inches long, mounted
with- sliver.
"Is it loaded?" I asked.
Her face fell. "I'm afraid it isn't." she said, "but that doesn't matter In the
least. Uncle George Is frightened to death of nrearrnsV'
My spirits sank lower and lower. Letltla was very pretty, and I was afraid
that a direct refusal to carry out her plan might annoy her.
"What about disguise?" I asked.

THE BIRD AND
THE
BONNET
By Dr. Theodore S. Painter
Of the United States Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C.
f^'tT2Z^ J I F lovely woman could only come to

v â¢> IratY 1 a '^ to ier lÂ° ve h'nes<, t ' lcn the world
< wl 1 \ 1 wou ld be more beautiful and better.
.r 1 * n tllc *-' n ' tcd States a strong war has
' r^ Â«^-* . already been well begun against this
modern slaughter of the innocents. Here
on the Pacific Coast I believe that you
hardly realize how far this matter has gone, for California
has almost no laws for the protection of birds, therefore
the thing has not been much in the public eye here. The
crane and the meadow lark have been protected, also the
gull within five miles of Santa Monica. But you have not
watched the war that has gone on, chiefly along the At
lantic coast, to save our songsters and other birds from the
cruel demands of iasliion.
There are national societies which work to secure laws
for bird protection. After these laws are secured, it is an
affair of the Government's to enforce them. We can
work only with the States that have the laws. For in
stance, Florida could ship all the birds she chose until the
State passed a bill prohibiting the killing; so now the
authorities can stop all shipments of Florida birds.
It was in the early eighties that the fashion of birds on
bonnets came with a rush. Up to that time ribbons had
been the prevailing trimming. But some one woman of
fashion adopted a bird and, like a flock of sheep, the rest
followed. Birds appeared on half the ladies' hats in the year
of eighty-one, I think it was. Gull and tern colonies were
devastated for fashion's sake. Bullets flew into their midst
â something that the birds did not know, had never seen,
wrought havoc in their midst, and the beautiful, innocent
little creatures fell by the hundred.
From that time on the fashion for bird decoration has re
mained. It has fluctuated a bit from season to season,
making flurries among gull investors and heron investors,
who speculate in the poor little slain just as others do in
wheat and oats. But in general birds have been in demand
by beauty every year and every season of the year. Oc
casionally they are used on gowns as well â one bird, for
instance, is perched en a fair shoulder. The grebe breasts
are used in an infinite variety of ways; for hats, muffs, col
lars, and dress trimmings.
Florida is the State that has suffered most, because it
has produced the most birds of beautiful plumage. Now it
has very few, for they have been practically exterminated,
and one of the greatest attractions of the State has ceased
to be.
Herons, egrets, pelicans and ibises attracted the money
maker with a shotgun. The birds have been killed in whole
sale quantities; above all, the custom was to kill them on
the breed.ing ground at the time of nesting, so in killing a
female bird there is an average loss of from three to five off
spring. This practice made the extermination a rapid
process.
This, by the way, is one argument showing that the
feather trade is more injurious than the fur trade. The fur
bearing animals are captured in the winter instead of at
breeding time. Moreover, they arc trapped singly, not
slaughtered by the wholesale.
Florida now has bird protection laws and the Orni
thological Union has a fund to pay wardens who keep a
sharp watch over what birds are left. They guard Pelican
Island, on the Indian River, a large colony of brown pjeli
cans. This island is a real attraction to tourists just as the
Farallones with their bird colony are an attraction here.
You know how carefully this colony is guarded, even the
eggs being under surveillance.
There is a myth which helps many a milliner, that single
feathers do not mean a dead bird. They will tell you that
the feathers are picked up where the birds drop them. This
is not so. Feathers dropped are not in condition for hat
trimming. The ones sold are plucked from the slain bird.
What the various societies and the department want is
to get the milliners to co-operate with them in the work
of saving the birds. There is now an agreement by which
certain of the Eastern milliners will not handle anv United
States birds or certain foreign birds. At one time 2600
terns were seized in one Baltimore shop, with the result
that the wholesale price of terns dropped from one dollar
to thirty-five cents.
There is a little snow-white gull found in the Hawaiian
Islands. It is called the albena. Shipments of these birds
have been. checked, but last winter it was amusing as well
as alarming^to see in the shop windows great numbers of
scarlet, blue?" green and pink birds, which experts identified
* as dyed albenas, colored thus to escape detection.
One good result of checking bird slaughter is the in
crease of demand for what are known as made feathers.
These are built from the feathers of turkeys, chickens and
geese, bought irom the poultry markets and pieced so as to
resemble large quills. Whole breasts are made: a wire
frame is covered with buckram, then the feathers are pasted
on, one over another, like shingles on a roof. This work
saves the birds and gives employment to many people.
Ostrich raising should be encouraged. Ostrich plumes
are beautiful and they are taken with no injury whatever
to the bird.
But if all the women of the land could be brought to
feel the inhumanity and the. poor [economy of killing our
song birds and birds of plumage, then the work would be
easy for us. Birds kill insect pests. A bird that may bring
five or ten cents to the killer would save the farmers from
one to ten dollars in fruit and insecticides. The gulls are
the best scavengers that a large harbor like this can have.
From the esthetic standpoint, beautiful birds are an attrac
tion, just as scenery is. Think of the money spent to im
port the Oregon pheasant! This shows that live birds are
worth more than dead ones.
If every woman would lend her aid to the work the birds
would have a chance.

CR0ZE OVER ANCESTOR WORSHIP
9
While there is so much that is ludicrous and nonsensical
being printed about American social precedence based on
ancestral fame it is interesting to note how even among
the scfans of Thibet the worship of ancestors is curiously
carried on. Twice a year their bones are dug up and re
ligiously washed, it being ludicrous in the extreme- to
watch the preternatural gravity with which the natives go
about this stupendous operation, carrying huge pots of
water to the open graves and religiously scrubbing the
bones.
To the natives themselves it is an intensely solemn and
sacred ceremony. As the possession of a larec "bonerv"
jrives to the fortunate proprietor great power in the tribe,
these bones are seif ed upon for debt or on the inaugura
tion of a feud, the persons or family so deprived of their
sacred relics beine shunned by the others until the bones
shall have been redeemed. J
One of the most remarkable of all the strange mvths
believed in bv this curious people is one' pertaining to the
sun. 1 foon and stars. The sun is believed to be an im
mense ball of yak- meat and fat, whereon the spirits of de
parted ancestors are supposed to feast, the light being
caused bv its heated condition. The stars arc portions of
this immense feast, which, dropping to the earth, (rive '

j - m ,,, FTER all, a man's toughest propositions
is himself â not the meanness and stu- \
(j^A^jfflii pidity of other people, not this con-^
irartsaaKsJa trarv universe. I remember over the<

wrong and I was fuming. and sulking
because of parental restrictions. At last I burst. out petu
lantly with . this characteristically youthful exclamation J
"Well, I'll be thankful when I get to college and can be my(
own master." Then came these quiet words from one who|
knew me better than I knew myself: "My son, you can.
never get away from yourself." So I have found it ever
since, though I have traveled quite a little over the world*
and sampled myself in many climes and under very different!
environments. The better policy is to do what the < gentle, {
discerning Robert Louis Stevenson commended as the wis- (
est course a man can pursue, namely, to establish terms ot'
friendship with oneself. Ah, that's the thing! We can dis-<
pense with the friendship of about anybody else sooner than ,
with our own. But just how can we live on friendly terms
with Number One. . ' <
It means, does it not, first of all, that a man should find!
himself interesting? .That is the test applied to everything (
to-day, to music, to the drama, to literature, even to the/
pulpit. A young man contemplating matrimony was advised
before he made the final proposition to imagine himself and'
the' object of his affection six months, a year. or ten years \
later obliged to spend a rainy Sunday together in a country (
inn 'with no resources in the way of books and papers and/
with no one to talk to except each other. Under those cir
cumstances would Romeo still find his Juliet and she him'
bewitching and perfectly satisfying? Now, it is not an oc
casional rainy Sunday that you and I are obliged to spend
with ourselves, but every day and all day, and unless there
is enough in us for our thoughts to feed upon, enough of a
mental substratum to occupy us during the chinks of lime
between our jobs, then we are going to get woefully wearied
of the gentleman known as His'Majesty Myself.
Another essential to the establishment of this friendship
is respect. That is the foundation of all friendly and profit
able intercourse between man and man, and to be on "pleas
ant terms with ourselves we must respect our own motives
and our own behavior. This does not mean smug self-com
placency or a pompous conceit. You don't respect those
traits in others and you -never can in yourself. But you
must satisfy yourself day by day and week by week that you
are a fairly decent and right-minded person, even though
still far from the summits of moral excellence. A conscious
ness of being crooked in business relationships, a slant to
ward the seamy side of life, a deliberate and prolonged effort
to pose as virtuous when one really cares nothing for the
good, the true and the beautiful â such things as these kill
self-respect and put an end to any lasting friendship with
oneself. Once' the tempter, urging a man to an evil action,
whispered to him, "No one will ever know." "But I shall
know it," was the quick and indignant rejoinder. He who
thus insists on retaining the approbation of his own con
science will never know the sorrow and self-abasement of
those who have forfeited its commendation.
And, paradoxical as it may seem, the consummation of a
friendship with -oneself is wrapped up with a genuine in
terest in others. For proof of this statement look at Steven
son himself. Was any man of our time fonder of his
friends, and did ever a man live more contentedly

MAKING A FRIEND OF ONE'S SELF

1 J S w '^ te^ ie rSt customerw hÂ° sa > rs h e doesn't n^ e our sausage that he knows what
j Igprifcf he can do about it. Repartee makes reading lively, but business dull. And what the
Â¦. -wMwfKJf house needs is more orders.
/- Sausage i s the one subject of all others that a fellow in the packing business
ought to treat solemnly. Half the people in the world take a joke seriously from the start, and the
other half if you repeat it often enough. Only last week the head of our sausage department started
to put out a tin-tag brand of frankfurts, but I made him take it off the market quicker than lightning,
because I knew the first fool who saw the tin-tag would ask if that was the license. And, though peo
ple would grin a little at first, they'd begin to look serious after a while; and whenever the butcher
tried to cell them our brand they'd imagine they heard the bark, and ask for "that real country sau
sage" at twice as much a pound.
A real salesman is one part talk and nine parts judgment ; and he uses the nine parts of judg
ment to tell when to use the one part of talk; Goods ain't sold under Marquess of Queensberry rules
any more, and you'll find that kncUving how many rounds the Old 'Un can last against the Boiler-
Maker won't really help you to load up the junior partner with our Corn-fed brand hams.
A good many salesmen have anidea that buyers are only interested in baseball, funny stories,
and Tom Lipton, and that business is a side line with them, but as a matter of fact mighty few men
work up to the position of buyer through giving up their office hours to listening to anecdotes. I never
saw one that liked a drummer's jokes- more than an eighth of a cent a pound on a tierce of lard.
What the house really sends you out for is orders.
Of course, you wan&to be nice and mellow with the trade, but always remember that mellow
ness carried too far becomes rottenness. You can buy some fellows with a cheap cigar and some
with a cheap compliment, but there's no objections to' giving a- riian what he likes, though I never
knew smoking to do anything good except a ham, or flattery to help any one except to make a fool of
himself.
I don't mean that you should distrust a man who is affable and approachable, but you want to
learn to distinguish between him and one who is too affable and too approachable. The adverb makes
the difference between a good and a bad fellow. The bunko men aren't all at the county fair, and
they don't all operate with the little shells and the elusive pea.
Real buyers ain't interested in much besides your goods and your prices. Never run down your
competitor's brand to them, and never let them run down yours. Don't get on your knees for busi
ness, but don't hold your nose so high in the air that an order can travel under it without your seeing
it. You'll meet a good many people on the road that you won't like, but the house needs their
business. . ,
For your own satisfaction Twill say right here that you may know you are in a fair way of
becoming a good drummer by three things :
First â When you send us Orders.
Secondâ More Orders.
Thirdâ Big Orders.
If you do this you won't have a great deal of time to write long letters, and -we won't have
a great deal of time to read them, for we will be very, very busy here making and shipping the goods.
We aren't specially interested in orders the other fellow gets, or in knowing how it happened after it
has happened. If you like life on the road you simply won't let it happen. So just send us your ad
dress every day and your orders. They will tell us all we want to know about "the situation."

Lige Hammond was superintendent of our Sunday-school
here several years ago. .
He went to a horse race over in the next town one day
and got on a fearful spree. Ezra Harper seen him drtnkin'
a glass of beer and Lafayette Smith heard him offerin' to
bet four dollars on one of the races. It was like a clap of
thunder out of a clear sky, and him havin' been held up a3
a moddle for all the boys and a man of property. Judge
Miller was for callin' an indignation meetin' and adoptin*
resolutions, the Judge bein' strong on whercases, but the
preacher said we ought to think of his wife and children.
We all seen what a blow it would be to them, so we didn't
hold the meetin', thinkin' it would be better to just let him
resign quietly and try to live it down.
But lo and behold Lige was on hand the next Sunday
as big as you please and as tho nothin' had ever happened.
After Sunday-school was out several of us gathered at the
Judge's and talked the matter over. Finally, the preacher
thought of a plan, and that evening I went to Lige to
start it.
After we'd talked about the outlook for the crops and
things I savs:
' **Lige, I'm sorry to hear that about you goin' to re
sign."
"Resign from what?" says he.
"From being superintendent of the Sunday-school,*
says I.
"This is the first I've heard of it," says Lige.
"It's funny how these stories get started," says I.
"Everybody in town's been talkin' about it for a week."
"Lige," his wife said, "You must tell them next Sunday
that you never thought of doin' anything of the kind. It's
too bad to have the people worryin' about it so."
The next day Judge Miller met Lige at the postoffice and
said:
"I never was so sorry about anything in my life, but
everybody. admits that you deserve a rest, and it's no more
than right that some one else should shoulder the burden
awhile."
"What's wrong?" says Lige, lookin' anxious.
"Why, you resignin' from bein' the Sunday-school super
intendent," says the Judge. "I couldn't hardly believe it was
true when I heard about it first."
"I'd like to know how such a rumor ever got started,"
says Lige. Â¦ "I wouldn't any more think of givin' up the
Sunday-school than I would of givin' up my wife."
"You don't know how it relieves me to hear you say
them words," the Judge told him. "Still I can't help reck
onizin' the fact that with your fundamental proclivities and
primordial juxtaposition it must be more or less of a bur
den to you, and as long as we couldn't expect you to bear
the responsibility for. ever, "i spose somebody else might be
broke in now 'as well as almost any other time. But think
it over and try to bear it a Sunday or two longer, anyway.
These are things people take easier if they come kind of
gradual."
A day or so after that the preacher called on Lige and
said he'd heard the news with deep regret and thought
Lige ought to of told him about it first.
Lige said there wasn't a word of truth in it, and he
couldn't sec for the life of him how the story ever got
started.
After that Lafe Smith and Orin Hitchcock and several
others went to him and told him they were sorry to hear it,
but they could understand how easy enough it was and
they didn't blame him a bit for wantin' a rest, and it was
no more than right that he should be relieved, only they
hoped he would feel like takin' hold again in a year or
two. When it had been goin' on that way for about three
weeks Lige got mad and said there must be some smoke
where there was so durn much fire, and if we wanted him to
git out he'd git! \
So I should think it would be the same with Schwab
after while, and some day he'll surprise the people by takin'
the hint and quittin*.
It's wonderful sometimes what talk'll do. There's that
grand young statesman Beveridge of Indiana. He got up one
mornin' a few months ago and rung the telephone. When
they connected hitr with the newspaper office he called for
he says to the reporter on the other end of the wire:
"Please say to the public that Senator Beveridge poti
tively declines to let his name be considered for the Vice
Presidency."
They dene it, but nobody thot much about it. So a few
days later he got another reporter and says to him: "I ap
preciate the high honor the people wish to confer upon me.
but I must positively decline to let this movement go on. I
will not be a candidate for the Vice Presidency in 1004."
When they published that two or three papers copied it
and somebody wrote a letter askin' the editor who started
the boom and why he done it. Then two or three people
that wanted to get appointed postmasters called on Bever
idge in a body one day and he ast them into his office and
made a solemn speech to them: \
"Gentlemen," says he, "I fully realize that your intentions
are noble and patriotic. President Roosevelt is a grand
young man with great possibilities before him, and I cannot
deny that it would be an honor to be on the ticket with him
in 1904, but I must positively decline to let my name be
considered in that connection."
They went away kind of awed and told their friends about
it. and in a little w hile lots of people .began to think if
Beveridge didn't want the place, he must be the right man
for it. So the boom commenced to spread, and there's no
tellin' where it'll stop if he just keeps on beggin' the Re
publican party not to thrust this high honor onto him
against his will.
Some people seem to think the Mark Hanna boom got
started in pretty much the same way. Nobody had heard
about it till Uncle Mark indignantly denied one day that he
wanted the nominashun. That kind of made a good many
people think that some able man from Ohio ought to lead
the grand old party to victory, and the first thing anybody
knew Uncle Mark could have had at least nineteen colored
delegates from the South on the first ballot. I have a high
opinion of Uncle Mark as a leader and a friend of the labor
ing man, but he has one faitle defect. He's rich. The peo
ple of this country refuse to believe that any man who has
got rich by his own efforts has the ability to be the chief
magistrate of the most glorious republic the sun ever shown
upon. Most of the men that get the job learn enough while
they're holdin' it to get rich afterwards, but that's different.
We are a free-born people, every man his own equal, and
we refuse to be ruled by a millionaire.
Yours for all that's comin* to me.

Ballard is made of. Nell. He's not the
man to draw back from a risk." .
No; John Ballard was not that kind of
a man. But don't count on John, George
Harvey! Earlier in the day just such a
risk as this presented itself to John Bal
lard, and he dared it. Even as you are
speaking, the body of John Ballard, hero,
lies piled up with other debris, miles and
miles down stream. Heroism has already
paid Its price.
So the day wore away and the night
came down upon them thus; a night dark
and threatening, with no light save the
ghostly phosphorescence of the rushing
waters. With infinite . pains they lulled
the two boys to sleep, covering them as
well as they could with coat and dress,
but for themselves there was only tense
wakefulness. Tbe last thing tbe waning
light had shown them was that the water
was rising. It might reach them almost
any time now; the currents that bad
strangely divided and gone to either side
of them might at any moment swing to
ward them. But what could they do?
Nothing; nothing until daylight, anyway.
Tbe cold night wind chilled them to the
narrow and now and then Herman or
Henry, feeling it also through their scant
coverings, awoke to moan childishly.
"What a night it was! The wind wailin*
over them, the flood hissing and whisper
ing around them and, iartber away, roar

that out there in the darkness white faces
and stiffened hands were being whirled

them tbe little, muddy waves were creep-

and then choked with fear. A little later
and a wave lapped up on the other side

Beyond that sudden cry and the half
conscious whimperings of the wakened
"children nothing was said. It was not a
time for words. Three hours later the
water was ankle deep. By this time it
was light enough to Â«e, and God! what
a prospect! Nothing but waterâ a vast,
muddy flood raging to either side of them
and lapping up and eddying around their
feet. It was a good thing for them that
the currents were so far away from them;
and yet, this very iact precluded all hope
of their getting hold of anything to carry
them away. In the dim light they could
make out wreckage going by, but the
larger pieces kept ia the main current,

them would not the current follow?
At sunrise the water . had deepened . to

were aching. How proud they had been
that their two boys were so strong and
healthy! How gayly George had been

about bis two boys, and felt as perhaps
some other husband and father felt in
tLat terrible day when "tbe waters pre

the refuge of the outcasts. Indeed, there
was a fearful likeness between the two
situations. The flood, of which he had
been warned, had come; the arks on
which be bad depended bad floated away
out of reach; the hilltop on which be bad

But he must not think of such things.
That was weak and foolish. They were

it would begin to recede before it got that

from thoseâ but they would be able to

THE PARENTS' DILEMMAThe waLjt -was plain, in.- LhÂ£ middle of

A very pretty shirt waist suit was re
cently sent hom<* to Miss Alice Roosevelt.
Its material, â¢which was a linen stuff, was
in a *hade of blue bordering on turquols?.
The skirt was plain down the front, but
was laid in side plaits at each side of the
front, tlio plaits pointing away from the
front. At the back there was a wide box
plait. . Â¦ Â¦ .' , â¢"â¢ > 'Â¦ â¢'- Â¦
The, plaits wore.T*le.Â»iÂ»ed about at the
knees, and round the skirt there was laid
r very wide bnrjd'of ! ace,. 'â¢which was
ft itched flat. Through the middle of this
lace there was run a 'black ribbon.' which
could be pulled out whe.ji ' the dress was
cleaned. Another wi^e band of lacr went
around thn bottom of the skirt and I hero
was a ribbon through the. band' of lace
also. - â¢ ' .... ., . â¢
Paneling, which !s so much in style, is
used unon skirts, and waist, and lace
panels, panels of tucking and panels of
trimming of all ktnds, are seen upon the
skirt and repeated upon the waist.
Miss Roosevelt's Suit.
' One of the pretty features of the shirt
waist suit is its skirt, vrhich. instead of
showing the plain features cf the tailor
made, is usually very much trimmed and
always to match the waist. If there be
lace upon the waist the\-e will be lace
upon the skirt, and if the skirt has its
trimmings of ribbon or velvet, or cord
ing, or what not. th? waist v.-ill be sure
to show the same features.
For those who like a plainer skirt there
is the skirt that is made plain with two
tucks running down the front about six
inches apart. These tucks are about threa
inches wide and are stitched fiat, 60 that
they 1 , somehow, resemble panels. There is
no other trimming upon the skirt and the
skirt depends for its beauty upon the foot
flare, which is managed by cutting the
skirt wide just around the foot.
There are various ways of cutting the
skirt wide so that it will flare, one of
these being the very simple one of making
the breadths wider at the foot. But there
are other ways, and one is the old expedi
ent of setting in side plaits, and another
is the fan method, which Is still the
vogue with lace and other fine material
used in thÂ«Â» fans.
A crest many women do not like the
gathered ekirt, nor the plaited skirt, as
they feel as though such a skirt made the
hips larger. But there are certain slender
figures that can wear this sort of Ekirt
to advantage. For those to whom It is
becoming the gathered hip yoke is charm
ing, for it is new and stylish and shows
off the material well.
The Skirt Question.
which she covers irith lace. Still another
sun plaits the whole skirt from the belt
down to the floor.
Building the Suit
The Ekirt of the shirt waist suit is cut
very tnodishly and Is up to date in every
respect. It is tucked or shirred, as the
suit requires, and It is made to n't the
figure as sr.ugly as fashion may dictate.
Thus the shirt waist Fuit Is very much
In the fashion, and iit the same time is
very comfortable.
There Is enothcr point in favor of the
ehirt W2ist suit, and this la that it can be
made at home, which Is an economical
consideration.
The o'd-faFhloned suit, which we used
to call a "costume," cannot be made at
home very well, for It is so tailored, or
to very much b*-trimniÂ«rd, that it requires
the hand of a professional. But with the
ehirt wattt suit it i? different, and any
woman with a fev.- yards cf batiste and
a little lare for trimming can make a
ehirt waist and skirt to match and be
very sure that her work wiil come out
well.
The proper cut for the skirt depends
upon circumstances, upon the material.
upon one's Individual preferences and
upon tli" fijrure of the woman who is go
in;? to wear !t. . i
In these days, when skirts are made all
sorts of wavs. it is difficult to lay down
en exnet rule for the. skirt of a shirt
Â¦waist suit, .for to many different modes
arc now in usp.
A rule â¢ which covcrns a certain vÂ»ry
fa.Â«hlon&WÂ«Â» modiste Is. that the material.
if It be thin, phall be shirred or gathered
around the hips. She runs many lines of
shirring from the belt down to thÂ» hips.
Below this thr: skirt liangs as plain as
po.-f-Hjie to the fuot. where it flares by
moans cf cunningly â¢â¢ontrived ruffles.
Another modiste- lays ber skirts in sun
plfcits and flta the plaits tÂ© ' a^ lzlp yoke.
But the ehirt waist suit of the present
srason is a compromise between the two
styles, and if you will gaze upon it a mo
ment you will eee that it combines all the
desirable traits of the shirt waist without
parting with any of the dressiness of the
â¢so-called "costume."
The shirt waist has a neat little waist
with ,Â« blouse front or a semi-blouse
front Its neck is provided with a nice
little adjustable collar or stock. There Is
* very pretty little belt or girdle to wear
Â¦with it, and the waist is trimmed in some
youthful fashion to bring out the yoke or
to show tlie nice straight lines which
make any waist so graceful on the figure.
There was something of a prejudice,
too. against the full cloth costume, for it
made a woman's figure look heavier and
It had certain features which were not
adapted to daily wear. Then. too. unless
cf the most expensive type, it was not
chle, and without this queer little French
quality no suit is admirable.
THE most popular dress of thÂ» year
is the shirt waist cult. Never has
Â¦ay other article taken as strong a
hold upon feminine fancy as this.
. _Â».:5<J cescrvedly does It win its high
place, iurf because of its merits does it
hold iis own through all fashion's fickle
changes.*
The shirt waist suit solves the complex
problem of the separate waist, which; was
rot quUe dre^sr enough for nice occa
sions, and the full pult costume, which
was too pretentious and too expensive for
genera! wear.
The shirt waist suit is a pleasant com
promise between the black skirt and the
colored shirt waist and the full costume,
which lacked jauntiness and was more
for mature figures than for fresh young
iorms.
each side of the front panel. Then came
wide sleeves bagging over the long tight
cuffs, and there wa3 a little shoulder cape
of blue linen with a shorter cape falling
over it. Both capes were trimmed with
ribbon and were buttoned upon the waist
with big white pearl buttons.
The girdle was a wide^rushed band of
linen folded around the .waist and "brought
down to a low point in the middle of the
front. - : .'...' â¢ : =' Â¦-- Â¦ " Â¦ * V
A shirt waist suit, intended for a Wash
ington girl, is made of ecru ' cotton goods
highly mercerized. The skirt lias ' the
tiniest tucks around the belt, alt laid in
pin clusters, while below these little tucks
the skirt stretches away in one unbroken
sweep to the very tip of the demi train.
Around the foot of the skirt there is a
little trimming in heavy white insertion
laid upon bands of deep blue cotton goods.
The waist has its trlmfng of lace on banas
of blue, it tucks and its plain unbroken
lines of bust and sleeve.
The Shoulder Trimmings.
While a great many of the shirt waist
snlts preserve the features of the' shirt
waists in that they have a simple little
waist with a skirt ;to match;*? 'Â«*' great
many of them are made elaborately' with
shoulder trimmings.
And of all the shoulder trimmings none
1s as popular as the shoulder cape. This
is made of lace and Is as deep - as the
shoulders, and a little deeper, falling over
the upper arm.
This deep lace shoulder capa comes in
?ery nice lace and costs & little fortune.
But you can buy it la Um cheaper laces
and. then, it can be had for very little.
It dresses up a short waist suit wonder
fully and makes it seem more fit for
street wear. More than this, the lace
shoulder cape is warm, for lace has a
warmth of its own. and It can be thrown
around one In driving or sailing, or on
cool evenings. It thus becomes a useful
as well as a picturesque article of dress.
But the lace shoulder cape can be made
somewhat newer if it be trimmed. Ona
way of treating these lace capes is highly
approved by modistes. They take a lac*
cape that comes down well over the
shoulder seams and line it with liberty
to match the suit. The cape is now quite
a pretentious little article of dress and
can be worn Instead of a coat tr need be.
Capes that consist of bands of insertion.
each band sewed separately upon ribbon,
are sewed together and thrown around
the shoulders. They are deep enough to
give the Ions slop* to the shoulders, and
so.' they go a greatway toward creating
the fashionable figure. _.,,Â«.
There. 13 a- shoulder cape that Is nxadÂ»
'of C ruffles and . ruchings* of chiffon, laid
upon a, foundation, with little ruffles of
lace set in between the niching* of chif
fon. These are very airy looking and very
comfortable on a cool day. They can be
cut with Ions graceful stoles and can be
caught under the chin with a wide- hand
some pin. The hat must, of course, matca
this cape. _*â¢-Â«-
The object of the shoulder trimming, or
the lace cape, upon the shirt waist Is to
make the shoulders look drooping. Any
thing that will accentuate the shoulder
line Is to be desired and the cape certainly
does this. But, at the same time. It has
a tendency to make the figure a little
mature, so that the woman who is going
to wear anything of this kind must be
sure that it Is a very short cape, not
one that falls to the waist line, which is
a very ugly length.
All sorts of shoulder capes, and capes m
all sorts of conditions, are being worn
and you can scarcely go amiss In making
such an article of dress if you will fit
It to your shoulders and fasten it in front
with lonr ends.
The foulard shirt waist suits are so
pretty and so capable of varied treat
ments that one cannot make a mistake
In purchasing foulard for the purpose of
making up one of the suits. Foulard has
the great advantage over most other ma
terials of being a dressy fabric, as well
an one intended for daily use, and it can
be made up so that it Is good enough for
a. bride's gown for a midsummer wedding
or plain enough for marketing.
A July bride is to wear a cream foulard
traveling dress, picked out with tiny pink
blossoms and trimmed with pink silk
lawn. Her hat is a turban shape, cover
ed with arbutus dowers, and her parasol
is pink, her gloves white.
Another very dressy foulard Is made In
cream color ground with blue flowers
scattered over.it. The trimmings in this
case are bands of silk, bands of Irish
crochet and bands of Valenciennes, the
three lacy trimmings being used alter
nately around the skirt. This foulard
suit, which is a shirt waist suit, has a
wide box plait down the front of the
ekirt. There Is a box plait in the mlddla
of the back of the waist and another in
the middle of the back of the skirt. Tha
bo* in every case is covered with lace.
"What kind of a hat to wear with a
shirt waist suit 13 a question which agi
tates many a woman. But to this she
can reply that any kind of a bat can be
becomingly worn.

Get a email, stiff brush, one that costs

Don't uFe the water too hot. yet plenty

soap is never rubbed directly on the rib

rubbing vigorously.
Drop' the various colors in and then take

and gently move the hands up and down
allowing the soapy water to follow your

If you chance to have a marble-topped

though an ordinary board covered with
white oilcloth will answer to all intents
and purocsei quite a* well. Dripping,
put the ribbon on the table, perfectly flat

in. for ence there they seem decidedly
unwilling to depart v.lt.tiout a struggle.
Jf lira bat k.cw it. there Isn't any
earthly Uhe why such a neckband should
be relegated to the scrap bag. Fold them
up and wait for some morning when it is
raining or when vou have nothing else to
do and then take a careful survey of ev
erything you possess in the collar line.
The :irst thine to do Is to sort out all
ribbons according to color. Never trust a
red near a pink or a blue in the same
bowl with a white, for even if the color
faded but a wee bit the white would never
look as clean as before, and in such small
matters it pays to look to the conse
quences.
Ribbons, as everybody is well aware of.
cost a great deal, and at the best a white
or a delicate blue or pink can be worn
but twice or three times and they are
ready to be discarded, not because Milady
in all her daintiness and prettiness has
given it li.'.rd wear, but because the fric
tion of h^r scft "skin makes a tiny dark
lir.e across its satin face and takes away
the newness.
DO vou know how to make "the
awld look a'most as weel's the
new"? If not, there is another
trick that is yours for the mere
reaching out of your hand and
you will find that it is ace high.
It is the trick of washing soft ribbons
ar.<l silks, a decifiedly good thing to know
at all times of the year, but warranted a
fire money saver on warm days, when the
beauty of your frock depends largely
upon its freshness and crlspness.
The wash chiffon furbelows that entice
every woman as she shops are a snare
and a delusion so far as ordinary washing
goes, and who in this world would will
ingly stick her nose outside her own home
with a bedraggled, specimen of past glory
staring everybody in the face? Chiffon
and mouFsellne simply cannot be rubbed.
They seem to resent every stroke and
shrivel up until you will almost need a
spyglass to find a fair-sized piece.
But they can be dipped, and. what Is
more, moderately successfully. Take pip.

good soap euds. and drop the collarette
into it Raise.it slowly a few times and
Satin is the hardest of all to manage
successfully. It curls and twists In such
an undignified manner that a warmâ not
hot, mind youâ Iron is nearly always used
for the finishing touches.
When there is Juft the faintest suspicion
of dampness left, lay a towel over the rib
bon and press it firmly on the wrong side
until all its former gloss and smoothness
have returned, and your task is finished
for one morning.
After you have tried, it once you will
find that it really isn't half as much
bother as it sounds, and while it takes the
best part of a forenoon you are practi-*
cally in just about enough. to buy a new
pair of boots, which is not to be sneezed
at. ""Â¦â¢.:. Â¦
Wringing has no place in the cleansing
of anything perishable. It tears, twists
and always manages to leave some signs
of damage in its wake.
.With an ordinary ribbon you T can
smooth out what few creases there are
with your fingers, working with it as it
dries, and in this way it is soft and 'easy
to manage, although it soils easier and
frequents the tub' more often.
With a good-sized towel take up all the
water you can and pin the ribbon fast to
anything that will hold, the .window sill
or the table cloth If nobedy. is looking,
and go over it again, being careful not to
crease the edges more than is absolutely
necessary.
Don't let it drop. Maybe you have a
wash silk waist or a frock that was your
hobby until it paid a peeded visit to Mr.
Frenchman and that came home to you
fresh and crisp, bul with a row of tiny,
nasty streaks right down the middle of
your back. That waist dripped, so take
warning.
much water and elbow grease may be
used as is necessary. And speaking of
soap reminds meâ never use a common
kitchen preparation for anything soft and
dainty. In the first place, it is usually
a dirty yellow and silk seems to discolor
if it has the 'least excuse, it makes no
difference whether it is plausible or not.
Rather try a white soap, and if there
i*n't any in the house resort to your next
door neighbor's pet -violet soap. You
might as well do it up in brown fashion
while you're at it, you know.
Then comes the rinsing. Perfectly clear
warm water is best, although for white
a few drops of bluing may be used, but
hardly enough to tint the water. Rinse
just as vou wet the ribbon In the first
place and bÂ« sure that all the soap is out
or else it will be sticky and unpleasant
to wear.
If any of your frills are hopelessly soil
ed and can't be worn any more, stick
them in the tub and see what happens.
If you are careful nine out of ten times
you will feel amply repaid, for unless a
color runs, and materials are getting bet
ter every year, you may don your finery
and sally forth to conquer the world.

When the morning's labors were over
the lunch was announced and tho club
turned housewife as one woman. Out from
a dapper little cupboard came tea and
cups and plates. The lunch boxes were
opened and an array of good things was
spread outdoors In such an air as would,
have shamed a confirmed dyspeptic Into
an appetite. And If you were ever served
in such s place with such a lunch sauced
and seasoned by such a company, your
teacup toast must be, "May the Scratch
Club live to make merry when tie cos*
tumes of 1303 shall be antique."
On the sunny Wednesday morning that
X happened up there a row of umbrellas
greeted mo, lined up along the railing of
the terrace. Miss Downing was the first
sketcher in the row. She was studying a
mass of pink geraniums against a dark
wall and she was so absorbed that any;
one might have walked off with her gay
Japanese umbrella. Miss Daisy Klttredga
was trying to make out whether a sun
dappled old chimney was light or dark
against the green and after much consul
tation It was decided to be both. Miss
Jean Beach was struggling with a vista
of glittering city and water beyond. Mrs,

"Once we attended a Jinks all dressed tÂ»

told me. "I was always called 'Ah Sid'

The largest affair was the costume par*
ty at which they tried to reproduce a So

to find their fair hostesses dressed as be
fitted the ladles of '52; and they were
served to seed cakes and Banbury tarts.
"I can't make out whether I'm dream-
Ing or whether the calendar really has
been moved back half a century." was ths]
great compliment of a pioneer guest.
The only caricature exhibition that this
city has ever seen was held In their oozy
rooms. Mrs. Hardlsty's keen sense of hu
mor found full vent In this, and the others
worked In harmony. The catalogue was
kept as a souvenir by many of our well
known artists, who thought It great fun
to see themselves "Joshed." One picture
was listed as "After JoulUn. the Mexican
Pottery Vender." (We do not Intend to
Infer that the lady In the picture Is after
Mr. Joullln). Another which Mr. Latl

skirts of San Francisco by Mrs. Casey's
goat. This was painted for a competition,
but never entered the contest, as It was

by the California Society of Historical

as "pot boilers and all sold, but not so
much so as the people who bought them.**
But when the club Is not given over to
hilarity like this Its main room shows
some striking studies made by Its clever
members. There are bits of the old Ter

views of the city beyond. An especially

statement to you who read of mur

Oriental quarter. But if you hark back a
few yearsâ say twenty-fiveâ and recall
what Chinatown was then, you will see
the change.
About a quarter of a century ago I
made a minute sjid complete study of

You will probably remember Miss Cul

now both dead, and Miss Worley. daugh

These people did more good than almost
any others in purifying Chinatown's
moral tone. It would be difficult for ma
at this time to say how many white chil

facilities for searching the Chinese quar

Â¦wherever we encountered children with
Caucasian indications or women of the
Mongolian race that were dissatisfied
with their state we got these good people
on the premises and assisted them to res
cue their charges and lodge them In the
missions. After that the courts handled
the cases.
Besides "the window smasher." we had
also "the silver thief." Cbee Ah Qui. Ha
held fifty burglaries to bis credit. Tha
strange thing about him was his perfect
knowledge of silver goodsâ real and sham.
He'd break into stores or houses and in
short order pick out all the genuine and
leave the bad. He would then plant his
booty close to the place burglarized and
would take his chances soinc back for it
some days later. When we finally caught
him he smilingly informed us that the
reason we never could get his swag was.
"I cookum." He was given fifteen years
in San Quentin and when liberated we
nailed him again as he was breaking
away from the house next door to Cap

might have escaped but for the wild rush
he made down Ross alley from Washing
ton street, as tha murder was not dis

flight was noticed by Special Officer Mc-
Laughlln, who subsequently described tha
man and assisted us to capture him in
one of the deep cellars, where he was

scheme of things he has planned and par

"It was about this time. too. that I be

then It didn't take me long to see th^J

than the broad acres themselves. So I

own only 30.000. But all those 30.000. or most

WONDERFUL CAREER OF A
90 YEAR OLD CATTLE KINGOne item worth noting Is that many of
the newest plates have no period after
the name. This Is true of Mrs. Mur
phy's, Mrs. Hobart's, Mrs. Will Crock
er's, Miss Toy's and others. It Is a cus
tom gradually creeping Into America, this
omitting' ef the period when It is unnec
essary. It is omitted after book titles and
the like.
Two by three has been the conventional
size for the young lady's card, hut some
of the new ones art larger and It is said
The width of t- > mourning border is a
matter of personal taste. Sometimes it Is
almost a third of an inch wide; sometimes
hardly more than a black line.
The head of a family often uses only
the surname, as "Mrs. Hobart." but this
is not advisable unless the name is un
common.
When the address Is engraved on the
card it appears in the lower right-hand
corner; the day at home in the left. A
card may Â¦ have either, both or neither.
Mrs. Henry T. Scott has a card giving
her Burllngame address In the right, her
Ban Francisco address In the left corner.
If one lives on a street corner It la
enfarter to write out that statement as,
"Laguna and Washington streets, north
west corner." instead of the simple house
number. If the card is. to be used while
you are away from home it is good form
to engrave merely "San Francisco", for
the address.
A card used In making farewell calls
has "P. P. C." in the left corner. This
Is an abbreviation of the French form.
"Pour prendre conger," or "To take
leave."
A widow's card shows her own Chris
tian name Instead of her husband's. Thus,
"Mrs. Jane Stanford" would be according
to custom, although Mrs. Stanford is in
the habit of signing herself "Mrs. Leland
Stanford." K (::^]
There is the married woman's card. It
Is always a trifle over three Inches long
and a trifle over two Inches wide. Some
are larger. Mrs. Hobart uses a card
three and a half by almost two and a
half. Mrs. Henry Crocker does also. Mrs.
Hugh Tevls has a card that la only three
by two. no larger than an unmarried wo
man's.
It is fashionable to engrave the mar
ried name In full, as "Mrs. Josephine
Sadoc Tobln" and "Mrs. Henry Edwards
Huntlngton." This,- however, depends
somewhat on a husband's choice, and if
he has aiways been in the habit of writ
ing his name with initials he usually pre
fers that his wife should follow suit.
Both initials are sometimes written, as
"Mrs. S. G. Murphy," or the middle
lnltal. <aa "Mrs William H. Crocker."
Mrs Crocker, by the way, has no period
after the abbreviation "Mrs." This is
modern and smart.
The hostess who sits down in the hush
following the 7 o'clock diminishing clat
ter of good-bys at the end of her tea can
read a good deal of social law as she
runs over the contents of the silver tray
that has been heaping since 4 o'clock in
the butler's hand.
The calling card may seem even ' less
than either of these, but it tells far more.
Wouldn't our ancestors back In the days
of primeval man have thought us a
strange race, if they could have known
that we were to be Judged by a two-by
three-lncb scrap of pasteboard, on which
only a nameâ perhaps an addressâsome
times a day. Is engraved? And yet. after
all, how simple a diploma that two-by
three card Is, certifying to our knowledge
of the forms correct.
THE bit of pasteboard Is a trifle, per
haps, but It Is one of the most slg
nmcant trifles in this complex
world, where the knot of a tie or
the size of a pompadour may testi
fy to the wearer's social status.
The fad that once existed for turning
down the corner of a card Intended for
more than one person is or the past. A
card for each person called upon must
he left. Fashion recognizes no petty
economies.
; When a death occurs and many mes
sages of condolence are sent a card of
acknowledgment is often Issued/ in this
form. "The family of General W. H. I*
Barnes gratefully acknowledges your
kind expression of sympathy and con
dolence. San Francisco." , The card is
â¢ largo and black-bordered. â¢
â¢ Cards issued for special reception days
exactly like any calling card, the day
.In the lert corner. Thus Mrs. McNear has
jpne reading, "Friday, the ninth of'Janu
ary."
4 The matter of type is Just now so un
settled that hardly any style ..can he
.jwrong. Not long since script was the only
possil.** form of engraving. Irately old
English and Roman types have come into
fashion, but many still hold to script.
â¢Stationers say. however, that > old Eng
lish Is soon to be universal.- Those who
have had script usually have their new
plates In one of the recent styles: thus.
"Miss Crockett" In script became "Mrs.
Lnurance ' Irving Scott" in Roman* let*
ters. '
I Not every young lady or gentleman who
enters this world Is presented with an en
graved plate and cards upon arrival, but
the babies of fashion are. The tiny card
engraved with the new name and date of
birth Is tied by a little ribbon to the
parents' card, thus, "Dr. and. Mrs. James
Alexander Black." and attached ' to it.
"James Ream Black, born December 23.
11900." It would be a mean trick to play
on a girl, wouldn't It. engraving and
spreading broadcast sucb record of her
age?
A few years later the young person has
another card engraved without the pre
fix, as "Dorothy Helen Jardlne." and thus
It must remain until the debut permits
"Miss." â¢ * â¢:<>

ter may do the tame, as "Mrs. C N. E3

I name above the latter. Where the moth
. er's name appears, the card Is as lair* aa
her own.
Another combination card Is that ef
husband and wife. This is used when they
\ call together or sometimes when the lady
-pays "duty calls" alone. Leaving 1 this
card means "My husband sends hi* re
gards" and It usually means also- "he

ETIQUETTE OF
THE CALLING
CARDONCE upon a time there was a farmer's lad who could never quite understand why people should rave so about the beauties nature and the ideal existence of life on a farm. 'Why,
thought he, "it's nothing but work. work, work from morning till night." When some of the city boys came down to spend their summer vacation at theJarm, he thought them quite
daft to seek such a place as a matter of choice. Everything they admired as being beautiful, such as violets, daisies and buttercups, he pronounced rank weeds and no good, for they
spoiled the pasture for the cattle and made extra work for him. as he had to drive the cows a longdistance to find fields free of the wild flowers. . When^the boys in their frolic would
roll down the Rrassy slopes of the hill he would remark: "Look at the dern fools. If they had to work here in the hay harvest from daylight till darkness they d get all the grass they
wanted without rolling in it." And so he plodded on through his days always grumbling and fault-finding at the hardness of his lot m having to live on a farm. He saw no beauty in any of his
<urroundines and considered the life of a farmer's lad nothing but drudgery. By and by a great change came over affairs at home; his father s health failed and, being no longer able to dp
the work of the farm, he called his son to his side and asked him to uke his place, so that they might be able to keep the old homestead. This proposition did not meet with the sons approval,
and he beezed his father to allow him to seek his fortune in one of the large cities. This caused his father much sorrow, but, having only the best interest of his son at heart, and not wanting
to compel him to stay at the old farm against his will, he consented to let him go. In a little while the familiar scenes of his childhoodâ the old home, fields, meadows and cow lanesâ saw

OUR NAME PUZZLES
EACH OF THESE TEN PICTURES REPRESENTS THE NAME OF
A HUMAN QUALITY - CAN YOU GUESS THEM
AND WIN A VALUABLE PRIZE?
ft SN'T it jolly fun summer is still on, bright, warm and comfortable? And the swimmingâ hurrahâthe
swimming is better than ever. But it takes courage to swimâ doesn't it? Which brings us to the pe
*i culiar part of this week's puzzles. They're a funny lot of puzzles, aren't they? Quite different from
anything we ever had before. They are all about human qualities, good, bad -\nd indifferentâ that is, if
there are any human qualities to which any one can ever be indifferent, whether they are good or bad.
Of course, you know something of these human qualities, though not as much now as you will
some day. For instance, just as it require- Courage of a very high order to even learn to swim, it re
quires absolute Baring and Coolness to go to the rescue of a companion who is drowning. And if the
fault was all his own it would require a high order of Truthfulness for him to admit it. And if the
unfortunate youngster were not whipped by his parents in the bargain that would show on their part
both Forbearance and Charitableness, likewise Patience, for it is no easy matter to permit a boy to learn
the hard lessons of life through Experience alone. , #^f
However, there are many other human qualities concealed in those ten picturesâ qualities which
you ought to know all about, and iJ ;-ou can guess;what they areâ well, there are lots of fine things in
the list below.
Remember, each of the ten pictures in this, the NINTH SET in the FOURTH SERIES of the

REMEMBERâ You may send in as many answers in your name as you wish, provided only that

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, July 18.â It is now nearly a fort
night since extreme unction was admin
istered to the aged Pope, but his vital
powere still "refuse to" yield to his fatal
malady. Pope Leo's case begins to pre
sent physical marvels quite as remarka
ble as thc'interegt attaching Â¥ to his ; last
days." It is "known, -Jtumanly/*. speaking,
that. he carinot,. recover, 1 . yet- none,, even
among his own medical 'attendants, now
ventures to phophesy when the last hour
will arrive. ; The wasted frame , of the
sufferer is scarcely, more than a skele
ton, but it contains a spirit as indomita
ble as ever 'and, his intelligence is still
keen -and active!
Meantime the great institution over
which Leo XIII. presides, taking cog
nizance only of the ordinary fate of mor
tals, is preparing for his successor. It
has been a week of great activity in. all
matters, affecting the papal succession.
Little has been allowed to transpire re
garding the most Important developments,
but the general tendency of the situation
is not difficult to follow.
It Is now clear, as was foreshadowed
a week ago, that the sympathizers with
Cardinals Rampolla and Gotti will com
bine in suppor of the latter. The finan
cial interests of the church, as represent
ed by the Bank. of Rome, and the head
of the Jesuit order also indicate their
sympathy with Cardinal Gottl's can
didacy. - . j
FRENCH INFLUENCE WANING.
The French opposition to Cardinal Gotti
seems to have been* overcome. This is
partly due to the fact that there Is a
growing feeling among Italian prelates
that, considering the rapid decline of the
influence of - Koman % Catholicism â¢ In
France, that country is no longer entitled
to its former power In papal affairs.
Cardinal Seraflno Vannutelll Is unques
tionably the strongest j rival of Gotti. A
Cardinal who is a leader in liberal views
is Agliardi, and he probably will have
the full support of , Cardinal Gibbons of
Baltimore. But his elevation to the
Papal chair is deemed impossible. Nev
ertheless, as representing the progressive
section of the church, he will have some
supporters in the ; conclave. .
A large force of servants is busy pre
paring rooms on the ground floor of the
Vatican for, the use of the Cardinals and
their servants : at the approaching con
clave. Each" Cardinal is entitled to a sec
retary as well as a servant. One hundred
and eighty rooms' wUl be necessary for
their accommodation. ;. ,The ' attendants
have also prepared^a'great'pit,* which is
capable of roasting a half-grown bullock.
This was used at ithe- conclaves "at which
Gregory, Plus and . Leo were elected.
It will ' be necessary to administer ex
treme unction when death again ap
proaches,-according .to the rules of- the
church,' because the sufferer In the mean
time rallied, sufficiently^ to again partici
pate in mundane affairs. .

PASIG RIVER INFECTED
WITH GERMS OF CHOLERA
Harine Hospital Experts Say Natives
Contract Disease by Drink
ing the Water.
WASHINGTON. July IS.â A report from
Manila to the Marine Hospital Service
says that the majority of cholera cases
continue to occur on vessels lying in the
shallow side of the Pasig River. The re
port says that this indicates that the
river must be infected, especially near the
banks, where the water is sluggish. The
native crews bathe here and sometimes
use this water for drinking and for wash
ing vessels. No white persons have been
affected, the cholera being found only
among Filipinos, the only persons who
come into contact with the suspected wa
ter.
Two interisland ships have been report
ed as having had cholera since leaving
this port, but this report says the islands
are bo generally Infected throughout that
It is scarcely justifiable at this time to
resort to an outgoing quarantine; which
means a. hardship to the business of the
island*, more especially as its value Is
problematical.
TRINIDAD, Colo., July 18.-A violent
hailstorm this afternoon, followed by a
cloudburst one mile south of Trinidad,
caused thousands of dollars damage and
compelled a number of families to nee for
their lives. Hall covered the ground to
a depth of six inches.
West of Slmpspns Rest a large arroyo
was flooded so quickly that the occupants
of 100 houses along the bank barely had
time to run for their lives. One house,
occupied by a man' named* Gray, -was
washed away a moment after Gray, .had
rescued his wife, who was lying ill in bed.
The Santa Fe depot was inundated to a
depth of nearly two feet and the base
ments of many business houses were
flooded.
The Commercial RfveT rose three feet in
thirty minutes and many , culverts .and
small bridges were washed out. Part of
the Denver and Rio Grande bridge east
of El Moro was washed out, compelling
that road to use the Santa Fe tracks. \ :
The water soon subsided, but left drift
wood piled so high about 'the Santa Fe
depot that buses were unable ' to reach
it with passengers. It is believed that
the tracks will be cleared by noon to
morrow. â¢ .- . ,.. .
PUEBLO, Colo., July 18.â A special to
the Chieftain from . VI neland says : One
of the heaviest hail storms ever experi
enced in this county visited -Vineland this
afternoon accompanied by a high wind:
The hailstones were as large . as walnuts
and the ground was " covered ' by Ice to a
depth of three inches. 1 The alfalfa crop
was beaten Into the [ ground and trees
were stripped of their fruit.' The area of
the storm was only about. three miles, but
the damage done Is considerable.

such a large figure as during the last
fiscal year, according to returns soon to
be published by the ' Department of the
Interior. Public land frauds have been
disclosed for many years, but recent In
vestigations conducted by Commissioner
of Public Lands William A. Richards
have revealed wholesale disposal of Gov
ernment' timber, mineral, coal and 'Other
lands .which was not suspected when. the
investigation began after the resignation
of former General Land Commissioner
Blsger Hermann.
The disclosures have led to the suspen
sion of many entries, grants and titles.
Entries in California, Oregon and Wash
ington have been generally held up.
Evidence gathered by George F. Pol
lock, chief of' the special service division
of the General Land Office, resulted in
the . dismissal of a group of local Land
Commissioners and showed systematic
frauds which" cost the Government many
millions, of dollars annually. As Â» re
sult of the proof obtained fraudulent
transfers of.. Government â¢ timber, mineral
and coal lands in California; Oregon,
Washington. Colorado, Mexico, Louisiana,
Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota and other
States special effort will be made by offi
cials of the Department of the Interior
to have the timber and mineral law re
pealed.
At least two United States Senators ar*
reported to be Involved in the disclosures
made, although, officials of the General
Land Office are reticent regarding their
identity.
Government land frauds, involving vast
sums of money, have been unearthed In
the Land . Office 'by an Inspection which
has lasted several months. Within a few

It was practically agreed to make a test
case, application for divorce being de
nied and the case carried at once to the
Supreme Court on a writ of mandamus. "
Five out of the six attorneys argued
thai the two new sections added to the
civil code are not constitutional. Judge
Torrance held that the law Is not consti
tutional, calling attention to the problem
involved in the granting of a divorce,
followed by the re-marriage of the par
ties divorced and the birth of children to
the latter marriage if. at some future
time the Supreme Court should decide
that the law was not unconstitutional.
Judge Conklin also held that the law
is unconstitutional. It was argued that
the law is special in that a
final judgment cannot be entered " for a
period: of one year after the court de
termines by an interlocutory decree that
one- of the parties is entitled to a divorce,
whereas in other civil actions, such' as
suits for foreclosure of mortgages, etc.,
final judgment is entered immediately
upon the conclusion of the trial, or as
soon as the Judge has determined the
rights of the parties.

Dr. Callandreau of the Bureau of Longi
tudes of Paris has printed the result of a
comparison of the crblts of the asteroids
and of the periodic comets of short pe
riod, and has formulated the following
conclusions: 1. At the inferior limit of
the asteroidal ring at small aphelion -dis
tances small "eccentricities and inclina
tions are to be found. 2. The eccentrici
ties Increase with the aphelion distances
but this is not true for the inclinations'
The orbits appear to be divisible into two
groups; the action of Jupiter is manifest
in the distribution of the orbits. 3. At
greater distances at the extreme limit of
the zone the short period comets are dis
tributed in a special manner. The marked
variations of the eccentricities at less dis
tances, followed by a diminution of the
perihelion distance, an appulse to the or
bit of Jupiter, and the mechanical and
physical action of the planet explain the
apparition of new cornets. These bodies
being â¢ loosely Constituted are frequently
dissolved, leaving thus a provision of
matter available for new formations.

PARIS, July 1?.â The Paris edition of
the Herald publishes a dispatch from
Rome saying members of the Papal court
intend to have his Holiness informed of
the presence in Europe of Cardinal Gib
bons, when Pope Leo will surely summon
the Cardinal to Rome in order to have a
conversation with hlm_cpricerning Cathol
icism in the United States. '
Among the latest of the many evidences
of continued eympathy with the Pontiff
in his illness, showing that his fight for
life is watched by the highest and the
lowest, was the arrival at the Vatican to
day of a case of mineral water sent by
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria to
the Pope. Their peculiar medicinal prop
erties, it is asserted, may relieve the se
cretionary disorders of the Pontiff, which
the doctors" bulletins have recently an
nounced.
Deprived of rest, the Pope spent the day
which has just ended with a serious de
pression. The doctors reported a feeble
but rapid pulse, which was generally
taken to Indicate a playing out of the
patient's forces. The favorable eymptom
recorded in the morning, the lowering of
the p'euralic liquid, was sufficiently main
tained to relieve the Pontiff of his painful
struggles for breath, which lately have
been so frequent. The doctors fear that
the gradual sinking Is due to general
conditions rather than to the necessity
for another operation, which seemed^so
imminent on Thursday. The sleepless
night was succeeded by a day during
which the Pope seemed to lack any de-
Elre to vary the medical routine by re
ceiving- \isits from Cardinals or others.
Both morning and afternoon he remaineS
isolated from all rave the doctors and
attendants. The nourishment which the
Pontiff tock at first somewhat encouraged
Lis entourage, but the condition of the
patient this evening pointed to the fact
that it had no had any beneficial effect.
What Is now most heped for is that the
Pope may be enabled to secure much
needed rest.

pied chairs and cheered lustily when the
speakers opened a tirade of denunciation
on the Casey sifle of affairs. : â¢
There were several speakers present-
Walter Gallagher, Thomas Egan, Senator
Bunkers and others. The Mayor, how
ever, was the drawing card of the even
ing. At first he reviewed the politics of
the last two years. He talked of labor
conditions and of the dissensions in the
labor camp and emphasized the accusa
tion of treachery.
"Gentlemen," the Mayor ,cried, "what
do you Intend to do with your party? Do
you expect to permit it to recede into
the hands of the Phelan-McNab element,
or will you follow me as a standard bear
er and vote for the delegates of the
Ewell-Aubertlne Committee? Caeey in
tends nothing more than blindfolding
union men and betraying them into the
hands of these politicians. I warn you all
to be on the alert and make no mistake.
When I became the leader of this party
I made certain pledges. I did not say I
would be immaculate, but I did promise
to stand by the laboring man. That I
have done. Compare'.the condition of or
ganized labor at the present with that of
the past. I did not permit the city's police
to bÂ« surrendered to one faction or cor
poration, nor have I ever permitted the
laborer to suffer."
In the course of his remarks the Mayor
gave his listeners to understand that he
would be a -candidate for renoxnlnation
on the Union Labor ticket and referred
to himself as the standard bearer of the
Mayor Schmltz took occasion last night
to express his sentiments regarding the
Casey faction of the Union Labor party.
Incidentally be said things that were not
favorable to LJvernaah and poured hot
shot Into the enemies' camp. - -
Judge Murasky took both suits under
submission after listening to lengthy ar
guments by Attorney H. C. McPIke. for
the board, and Albert and Hiram John
son, for the petitioners. McPike contend
ed that the court had no Jurisdiction over
the actions, of the. board. The Johnsons
took issue with him on that point and
produced a long list of authorities tend
ing to show that the. facts in the case
showed that the board's action was min
isterial, and not judicial, and therefore
subject to review by the court. - Â¦ â
The answer of - the Election Commis
sioners to the suit of August Harders and
Samuel Berger of the antl-Schmltz faction
of .'.thA-. Union; labor party for a writ of
mandate, compelling them to grant their
petition for a place on the ticket to be
used at the coming primary was filed In
Judge Murasky's court yesterday during
the final hearing of the suit. The answer
contains a specific denial of the causes
of action contained in the politicians'
complaint. Jt.also contains-, as'a defense,
the allegation that the plaintiffs are not
the duly authorized leaders of the Union
Labor party. This . fact, 'say the Com
missioners, was learned after a careful
scrutiny of the petition and an exhaus
tive investigation, . and for , that reason
their petition was denied.
An answer was also filed by the Com
missioners to the suit for an Injunction
filed by Harders and Berger restraining
the, board from granting the petition for
recognition filed by the Ewell-Aubertine
faction of the party, which petition was
granted bv the board. The answer. In
the Injunction proceedings is exactly the
same as that filed In the mandamus ac
tion..

Petition Followed an

The greatest menace that the party has to
meet to-day is r.ot the probability but the
possibility of the party's return to the posi
tion that it occupied from 1802 to 1896. This
danger Is not so imminent as the corporation
controlled papers make it appear, but in eo far
es it threatens, it paralyzes the energies of
the party and nulllflies its promises. Such a
return would Indicate a degradation of the
party's ideals and a perversion of its purpose.
If the Denfttcratlc party will stand erect,
face the future with confidence, defend the
rights of the people and protect their inter
ests wherever attacked â whether the attack
comes from the financiers, the monopolists, the
tariff barons or from the Imperialists â it can
look with confidence for a revolution of sen
timent that will give us a victory worth hav
ing, and this victory when It comes will not
end. as the victory of 1892 did. In the demor
alization of the party, but in the building
up of a Democratic organization which will
deal aggressively with all of the .evils of gov
ernment, and find its bulwark in the affections
and confidence of the masses.
We are handicapped Just now by the fact
that- the last Democratic administration that
we had was more subservient to corporate dic
tation than any Republican administration that
had orecpded it. and the record of that ad
ministrate has been a millstone about the
party's neck ever since. The influence exerted
by Wall street over the administration's pol
icy, the use of patronage* to reward those who
betrayed their constituents, and the employ
ment of the most reprehensible of Republican
methods, make the administration a stench
in the nostrils of the people, and kept in the
Republican party many who were dlcgusted at
that party'H course. The odium which Mr.
Cleveland's second administration brought
upon the party which elected him did more to
defeat the party than any one plank of the
Chicago platform, or even than all the planks
that were most severely criticized. But for
the repudiation of the administration It would
have been impossible to make any campaign
at all. and even the repudiation, thorough and
complete as it was, could not completely dis
ln/ect the party.
GRILLS CLEVELAND.
Eurely. if there ever was a time when the
preachinjj of the Democratic gospel ought to
be opportune now U the time. The character
of our narty is to be determined by the man
ner In which it meets an opportunity â would
be determined by the ideal that dominates it.
Will our party hesitate or take counsel of its
fears? Will it \ abandon Its championship of
the people's interest in the hope of conciliating
relentless foes or of purchasing a few offices
with campaign contributions that carry with

the pockets of the people?
The Democratic party must appeal to the
Democratic Eentiment of the country, and this
sentiment is far wider than any party. Wher
ever the question 1ms been submitted in such
a way that It could be acted upon Independ
ently there has always been an overwhelming
majority in favor of that which was demo
cratic, and our party can appeal successfully
to this democratic spirit if we but convince the
people of our earnestness and cf our fidelity
to those principles.
The subject of Mr. Bryan's speech was
"The Democratic Ideal." He said In part:
BtlYAN'S ADDRESS.
CHICAGO, July 18.â William J. Bryan
addresed I several thousand enthusiastic
Democrats at the Chicago Democracy pic
nic at Brands Park to-day. He was receiv
ed with cheers and waving of hats when
he stepped on the platform. After a
short Introductory speech by Mayor Har
rison, Mr. Bryan spoke and was frequent
ly interrupted by applause.
In his address he made special reference
to the possible candidacy of Grover Cleve
land in 1904, and the latter and his sup
porters were excoriated by the speaker.
Mr. Bryan arrived in Chicago early in
the day and was escorted by the Chicago
Democracy Marching Club to the Audi
torium Hotel, where a reception was ten
dered all the speakers of the day. After
luncheon and a parade through the
streets fifty trolley cars bore the Demo
crats to the picnic grounds. Other speak
ers who followed Mr. Bryan were Mayor
Reed of Kansas City, Jeremiah B. Sulli
van of Iowa, D. J. Campau of Michigan
and T. E. Ryan of Wisconsin. Charles A.
Walsh of Iowa was 'absent and his ad

FATAL EFFECT
Postmaster Van Cott contends that he
â¢was actlner under the direction of a su
perior officer and had no control over
Graff's appointment, which was made
from Washington, but the 'Comptroller
Bays these faotR do not relieve the dis
bursing officer of responsibility.
It developed to-day that the total num
ber of machines supplied to the postoffice
by the . Brandt-Dent Automatic Cashier
Company of Watertown. Wls., was 672.
The Inspectors have evidence of this, al
though the present action of the Grand
Jury in Brooklyn indicting George W.
Beavers Is based on the contract under
which twenty-live of the machines were
supplied. The information In the posses
sion of the Government is that of the
amount paid by the Government for each
machine tho contracting company re
ceived $50, while $100 went for commis
sions, of which amount the agent of the
company received $50. The cash registers
were sold openly In the market through
out the country for $125, while the Gov
ernment paid $150 each.
WASHINGTON, July 13.â The Comp
troller of the Treasury has completed the
examination of the accounts of Postmas
ter Van Cott of New York City for the
quarter ended December 31.' 1902, which
he took up as the result of the postofflce
Investigation, and has allowed all the ac
counts except an item of $450, paid to
H. C. Graff for alleged services as cash
ier of the New York Postofflce at the
rate of $1100 a year. Graft was intimate
ly associated with George Beavers, now
under Indictment by the Federal. Grand
Jury at Brooklyn. The Comptroller holds
that Graft was not employed as cashier
at New York, and was not on duty in
that city, but was inspector in charge of
Inspecting and adjusting canceling ma
chines and motors at postofflces through
out the country. The Comptroller says
the law distinctly prohibits the detail of
employes from any branch of the postal
service outside of "Washington to duty
here and the payment therefor is illegal.
At the office of Morgan & Seabury, at
torneys for George " W." Beavers, former
chief of the Division of Salaries and Al
lowances in the Postofflce Department,
It was said that Beavers was not in hid
ing. Seabury said: â¢ ,
Mr. Beavers Is not seeking \\a escape the
operation of the law. I believe in my client's
Innocence, but I beg to be excused from mak
ing, any' statement at present, which I think
would be premature. I may make a statement
later.
NEW YORK, July 18.â United States
District Attorney Youngs of Brooklyn to
day officially announced that an indict
ment had been found by the Federal
Grand Jury against Qeorge W. Beavers.
The charge is complicity in wrongfully
obtaining a Government contract.
Av The District Attorney announces that
he Â¦will' refrain at present from request-
Ing the service of a bench warrant upon
Beavers, deeming it right that he should
have the opportunity to surrender him
self if he sees fit to do so, and has noti
fied his counsel to that effect.
The crime for which Beavers has-been
indicted is technically a misdemeanor,
punishable by two years' Imprisonment
or $10,000 fine. \

AMONG the greatest. If not the greatest, of American tragedians Is Robert
Downing. For years he has held American audiences spell-bound with his
thrilling Interpretation of tragedy. Few people realize what exhaustless
energy It requires of a man to keep up this terrible drain of nervous force. If
the truth were known It would be found without doubt-that few If any of the lead-

' ' "I find it a preventive against all sudden summer ills that I

These results are purely provisional,
dealing as they do with only a short pe
riod of observation In one particuar, lo
cality, ' but they are perhaps definite
enough to warrant, the obtaining of a
longer record at a place, situated within
or. near the tropics, where earthquakes
are of frequent occurrence.
In the Journal of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal Mr. Oldham of the Geological
Survey of India discusses the relations of
the periodicity of the earthquake shocks
recorded by a seismograph set up at Ehil
lorg, Assam, during the period of Au
gust, 1S97. to December, 1901. and the peri
odicity of the tidal forces obtained at
that place during the various relative po
sitions of the sun and moon.
After deducing the reasons for expect
ing the shocks to appear at times during
the day and night when the tidal foreÂ©
is at a maximum at the place of obser
-vatlon, Mr. Oldham sets out the recorded
shocks In a series of tables and curves.
These show that there was a real and a
very large variation in he diurnal distri
bution of In Assam during 1897
1901, their greatest frequencies occurring
between 10 and 11 o'clock In the evening
and between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morn
ing, and superimposed on this regular but
unexplained variation there was a smaller
i one, which appears to have been due to
the tidal stress set up by the action of
the sun. If this latter variation Is really
due to tidal stress, it then appears that
the horizontal, component of the stress
' is much more effective than the vertical
component, while the effects are more de
pendent on the rate and range of the
stress than on its amount.

A study of the balsam will be carried
on by the Bureau of Forestry this sum
mer in the Adlrondacks and in Maine.
Work has already been done in tho
Adirondack?, and the object of the com
ing season's work will be to conclude tha
study, the results of which will probably
be published next spring. The main pur
poses of the investigation of balsam are
to determine Its suitability for use as
paper pulp, the quantity which Is now
standing and the results that can be ex
pected In the production of a second crop
under conservative methods of lumber
ing.
A study of the poplar In Maine has
come about through the increased use of
poplar as paper pulp material. Its gen
eral scope is similar to that of the bal
sam Investigation.
The work on Southern hardwoods this
year will be a continuation of the study
which has already been carried on dur

Nearly half of Formosa is still occupied
by these murderous men of the forests,
whose weapons are turned against all
strangers. Thus the forests present very
different conditions from the peaceful
plains to the west, inhabited largely by
Chinese rice growers. .. >-.
The tree-clad mountains of the east part
of the island contain the largest camphor
forests in the world. They are also the
home of savage tribes that have never
been subdued. '
Japan and China together produce only
about 500,000 pounds a year, but the an
nual yield of Formosa is from 6,000,000 to
7,000,000 pounds. Formosa controls the
camphor markets of the world, and 'will
probably always be the greatest source of
this valuable gum. The world has to pay
more for camphor than it did a few years
ago, and one reason Is the danger and dif
ficulty of collecting it.
Few industries of the world are carried
on under conditions so difficult and dan
gerous as camphor collecting and refining
in. Formosa. There is a great deal more
tragedy than romance about it, and cam
phor Is obtained only by braving these
dangers, for nearly all the world's supply
comes from Formosa.
A dispatch from Tokio says that a cam
phor refinery at Gilan, in the- island of
Formosa, was attacked recently by 150
of the wild natives, who". killed the.Jap
anese workmen and the policemen who
were guarding them, says the New York
Sun. It was a small establishment, and
the victims numbered only eleven persons,
but the tragedy illustrates the perils of
the camphor industry in that Island.

NEW YORK. July 18.â President John
son of the American Baseball League to
day suspended pitcher Waddell of the
Philadelphia Athletics for five days for
his attack on a spectator yesterday.
"Rube" Waddell Suspended.
At this juncture the Order of Railway
Conductors asked the State Department
to use the machinery of Government to
determine from authorities in thÂ»:city of
Mexico why McCutcheon, 'who is a citizen
of the United States, should not be given
a hearing and allowed to establish the
fact that he killed the Mexican brakeman
in self-defense.
The authorities at Coz have been ad
vised of the action taken across the line
to secure a hearing for McCutcheon and
when It is understood that his friends
mean to push the case be .will without
doubt be released, as the killing was
plainly in self-defense. 1 -; â¢-; " "' 'Â¦Â¦:â¢Â¦
TUCSON, Ariz., July 18.â The Order 4 of
Railway Conductors has appealed to the
State Department to secure a hearing for
one of their number, Thomas McCutch
eon, who languishes in the Mexican jail
at Coz, Sonora, charged with murder.
McCutcheon shot and killed one of his
brakemen, a Mexican, who refused to
obey orders but instead attacked him
with a knife. To save his own life Mc-
Cutcheon was compelled to shoot ' the
Mexican brakeman and after having com
mitted the deed made no attempt to es
cape but surrendered /umself to the auÂ«
thorltles, believing that an Investigation
would show that the killing was in self
defense and that he would hts released.
Instead he was thrown into jail and de
nied ball and the officials show no inclin
ation to act on his case.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Four daring thugs held up Lewis Roe
der, the proprietor of a lodging-house at
612 Howard street, last Tuesday night, and
after securing $3 and m watebchain from
him proceeded to administer a terrible
beating. Roeder notified the police of the
hold-up and they kept it secret till last
night, when Detective Taylor and Offi
cers Fogarty and Hurd arrested two
brothers. Jack and Nick Stafford, and
charged them with having committed the
crime. They have been identified as two
of thÂ« men who held Roeder up.
According to Rodder's statement, he
was in the office of his lodging-house,
when some one called to him to come
downstairs in a hurry. He rushed down
and Juet as he reached the door was set
upon by four burly thugs. One of them
held a revolver to Roeder's head and
warned him not to > - ell under penalty of
being shot. The frightened man paid no
attention to the threat and called loudly
for help. One of the roomers in the house
heard the call and hastened downstairs to
see what the matter was.
He was. mÂ«t at the foot of the stairs

for a reduction in the amount of the fine

The Judge, with the consent of Attorney

the fine, to $50. which was paid by P. H.

rival In this city. When arrested the
checks were found ln his possession.
Mobius, who Is a glassblower employed
by the Iron Mountain Glass Company ln
Shasta County, arrived several days ago
and broucht wjth him two checks on a'
local bank, on<? for $200 and the other for
$150. Yesterday afternoon he wandered
into a saloon at Â£13 Kearry and while en
gag-ed in draining a glass of beer an al
tercation started between two men who
were in the p'ace.
Blows were exchanged and Mobius, de
sirous of taking part in the fray, removed
bis coat and, throwing It to one of the
combatants, declared that he would at
tend to the aggressor. At this Juncture
the f.ght came abrupty to an end and
Mobius put en his coat. Some time after
ward he made the startling discovery lhat
the two checks were missing
He communicated with the police and
pave an excellent description of the fel
low who had held his coat. About 6
o'clock O'Brien was found ln a Washing
ton-street clotting store, where he had
just purchased a suit of clothes, giving
the smaller check in payment, and was
waiting for the change. On the way to
the Hall cf Justice he made an attempt
to throw awav the other check, but the
alertness of the officers prevented him
carrying out his Intention.
He was later identified by Mobius and
will be booked to-day.
John O'Brien, a bartender, was arrested
last evening by Detective Armstrong:, and
Patrolmen C. W. Brown and A. I*.
I i 'jlrr.es and his name placed on -the deti

cause it was contrary, to the Federal laws
as set forth in the . Sherman act.
The complaint sets forth also that the
prices at which complainant is now sell
ing, drugs are fair and reasonable prices
and that" they can make a fair profit
upon the' 'goods 1 at these prices; that any
Increase in these prices will give the deal
er more' than a fair profit at the expense
of the purchaser.
In order to bring the case under the
Sherman act the complaint alleges that
these articles upon which a conspiracy
has been formed to prevent The Owl 'Drug
Company from purchase are manufac
tured outide of California and aro brought
into the State by the wnoiesalers.
The. complaint sets forth in detail, the
workings of the alleged combination and
the methods by which it is thought to
fix prices. The compla...t alleges that
the San 'Francisco Bay Counties Asso
ciation comprises nearly all the druggists
in business in San Francisco and that it
demanded of ; the wholesalers on or about
May 5, 1903, that they refuse to sell to
The ' Owl Drug store. This action was
taken, according to the complaint, as the
result of a written agreement between
the members of the association. Since
that time The Owl alleges that it has
been unable to purchase drugs of thesa
wholesalers, although it has ordered
goods of them and offered to pay cash
in cold coin. - Â¦ >â¢
Suit was brought before Judge Morrow
in the United States Circuit Court yes
terday afternoon by The Owl Drug Com
pany aeralnst 227 wholesale and retail
druggists of San Francisco for $3000 dam
ages claimed by The Owl Drug Company
because of an alleged conspiracy araonc
thfe- defendants to ! force The Owl Drug
Company out of business by boycotting
it and preventing it from purchasing
drugs.
The list . of defendants includes . the
names of almost every wholesale and re
tail druggist doing business In San Fran
cisco. The claim is made by The Owl
that the defendants have combined to fix
the retail price of proprietary articles
and drugs and constitute a trust con
trary to the laws of the United States.
The National Wholesale Druggists* As
sociation, the Natianl Association of Re
tail Druggists, the Proprietary Associa
tion of America and the San Francisco
Bay Counties Association of Retail Drug

Last Days of the Great Reduction
Sale.
The SuDreme Court allowed Mrs. A.
Delatour $1000 damages yesterday for the
death of her Â»on. who was killed by
some falling boxes In front of a Market
street 6tore about two years ago. The
only question raised was as to the right
of the mother to maintain the action in
view of the fact that she had separated
from her husband. The court held that
when one spouse is compelled to leave
the other by reason or cruelty,- "tleser
tlon" is constructive and is committed
by the party responsible for the trouble.
Francis Buelna was also allowed $750
damages for breach of promise on -the
part of John M. Ryan. The defendant
argued that Mrs. Buelna had not been
divorced from her former husband for a
year at the time she agreed to enter
wedlock again, and therefore the engage
ment was void. Tha court says that a
marriage at such a time would be "illegal
and void." but that an agreement to
marry cannot be construed likewise.

- Alcoholism is the chronic poisoning resulting from constant use of alcohol, even if this does not produce drunkenness.
DR. McKANNA'S TREATMENT IS NOT AN EXPERIMENT.
Thirteen years of success in the Middle West, and MORE THAN 11,000 PERMANENT CIJRES have proved his ability to
conquer the drink habit. â¢ \^ ,; Â¦ Â£ 1
HISTORY OF ONE OF DR. McKANNA'S REMARKABLE CURES.
A case of Alcoholism which I cured in Kansas City, Mo., is unquestionably the most successful cure of this disease ever effected by any treatment. The
- patient is a prominent young business man of that city. I do not srive hjs name in my public announcements, as I never publish the names of mv oatient3
without their permission. I will, however,, give the name and address of this man to any person who wishes to correspond with him, not for reasons of curi-
osity, but from serious interest. ,~ v *" â¢ Â«. r â¢
. . -The patient is a member" of a prominent family and had not been entirely sober for twelve^ears. Three times he had been a patient of a oromiaent
treatment for the liquor habit and had not even, refrained from drinking while undergoing the treatment. He had reached the point where hewas unable to
attend to business and where his family had entirely given up hope. As a last resort he was sent to the Missouri Insane Asylum. At the end of six months
he was released on parole. His family informed him that the next time he became under the influence of liauor he would be returned to the Insane Asvlum
to stay the remainder of his life.. He reached Kansas City Sundav. Ausrust 3. 1002. The followine Wednesday he went on a drunken spree. So ?**** a
hold had the disease of. Alcoholism upon him that even* the knowledee that intoxication meant his return to the Insane Asylum to, spend the remainder of
his days there could not restrain him. Plans were made to take him back to the Insane Asylum the followine Sunday on the midday train. - ,
Early Sunday mornine he left home, and, like a man.clutchine the final straw, came to my Kansas City headquarters and stated ms case to me. 1
telephoned the head of his family, asking him to come to my office. He consented, and we talked over the conditions. He decided, as a last resort, to teavc
the patient in my charge for one week. The young man commenced the treatment that day and has not touched a drop of alcoholic stimulants since that
time He returned to active business, his health is perfect, he sleeps well, eats well, and is a man once more. However, it is not such isolated cases as this
which prove the merit of mv treatment for the cure of Alcoholism. The thousands of patients whom I have cured will each one bear testimony to the fact that

Creating a Sensation.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. July 18.â
M. H. Thorpe, '05, a well-known student,
was severely injured last night by the
discharge of a blank cartridge in his
face during the performance' of a comedy
in Palo Alto. The' pistol was shot right
in his face, burning it severely and forc
ing over 200 grains of powder into the
flesh. Some of them struck his eyes and
there is grave danger that his sight may
be partially destroyed. He was taken
to a San Francisco hospital to-day.
Thorpewas acting the part of a villain
and contrary to arrangements leaned
into the pistol flash in his fall instead
of the other way. His face bled pro
fusely. A doctor was called and the play
ended in confusion. Thorpe is a sopho
more, an assistant in the universj*$
library, leader of the band, a debater and
a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.
The comedy was given for the benefit
of the typhoid relief fund and netted
J100.. It was entitled "Old Hick'ry

NEW YORK. July 18.â The Financier
this week says: .
The striking feature of the official state
ment of the New York associated banks
last week was the gain of $6,036,200 in
cash, an amount $1,248,400 in excess of the
estimated amount, which was based upon
the traceable movements of money during
the week. The difference ls accounted for
by the fact that the estimates included
the $2,837,400 cold, which was withdrawn
from the banks on Friday of the previous
week, while under Jhe clearing-house
system of averages five-sixths of this sum
was embraced in the bank statement. The
deposits were increased by $3,064,800, which
amount is less by $457,900 than the sum
called for by the gain in cash less the
decrease, of $2,513,600 in loans; therefore
the statement fails to balance. -- The re
quired reserve was Increased $766,200
through the augmented deposits and de
ducting this sum from the Increase ln
cash, leaves $5,270,000 as the gain In sur
plus reserve, carrying this Item to $13,
27S.475. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $37,263,300 ' of pub
lic funds, the surplus reserve is $22,595,675.
The decrease of $2,513,500 ln loans proba
bly reflects ln great part the liquidation
of the stock market during the early part
of the week. The loans are in excess of
deposits by $11,807,400, against $17,385,700
ln the previous weehj. The daily average
of bank clearings last week was $237,000,
000, an increase, compared with the week
ending July 11, of $19,000,000. The clear-
Ings reported on Saturday reflecting Fri
day's business were $245,268,988; ! this was
due to the large transactions on the Stock
Exchange on that day.
The surplus reserve ls now but $2,500,000
below that ln the c6r responding week last
year. Usually at this season bank condi
tions in respect of surplus improve and it
ls probable that the- immediately following
weeks this year, will ; show more or '.'less
important gains) Comparisons of loans
Indicate that six of. the larger banks in
creased this Item by. $400,000 net. .Five of
these institutions gained $5,900,000 In spe
cie. , Â¦ ,. â¢Â¦;, â¢. :.>;.-:--.'â¢';.-

CRIPPLE CREEK. Colo., July IS.â The
official call for the next meeting of the
Trans-Mifstesippi Commercial Congress
at Seattle, Wash., has been issued by
Secretary Arthur P. Francis. The dates
fixed are August 18, 19, 20, 21. 1903.
WILL MEET AT SEATTLE

Call Issued for Next Convening of
the Trans-Mississippi Com- '
mercial Congress.
The theory of the association is" that the
best way to help the poor Is to make
them agents in bettering their own condi
tions. â¢ There is no doubt that the captains
of industry of to-day were the poor boys
of thirty or forty years ago, as surely
as the leaders in commerce of thirty
years henoe will be composed of the poor
boys of the present time.
It is > the hope of the association that' It
may be the means* of starting many of
The association' has over 15,000 . stock
holders, who are building up a competen
cy for old age. Not all of -them will
reach the goal; some of them will meet
with misfortune and some, who are the
most unfortunate of all, will think, that
they haTe saved long enough and immedi
ately set about to. spend several years'
earnings.
During the last fiscal year the associa
tion has made 746 loans, amounting to
$1,100,000, more than two loans for every
day in the year. Of the total loans made,
333 were for new homes, more than one
for every working day In the year. This
not only means 333 families starting on
the road to Independence through the
medium of this association, but it means
a year's employment to an army of me
chanics. â¢ Â¦ " 'Â¦- . ;
The year has been an interesting one In
many ways, butthe feature that attracts
the most favorable comment is that
showing the largest increase in business
of any year since organization and with
each succeeding month is found a gradual
Increase in assets. .
The fourteenth annual statement of the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion showing its condition on June 30,
1903, is full of encouragement to the stock
holders who have invested their money
in the quasi-altruistic institution. The
statement shows that the association has
the largest co-operative bank in the Unit
ed States. Its subscribed capital, is close
to $15,000,000 and its paid-in capital Is
$2,800,000, with a monthly Income of over
$200,000.
Undoubtedly there is no institution in
this city organized on strictly business
basis which Is doing so much for the up
lifting of the prosperity of San Francisco
and the State at large as the Continental
Building and Loan Association. At the
eame time it is offering to the working
classes opportunities for securing their
own homes on a scale of payments easily
within their reach and no more burden
some than the payment of rent. At the
end of the term they own their property
and many of. them have been enabled on
comparatively slender wages to acquire
other holdings that materially add to
their incomes and make their positions in
life one of independence.
At the same time It Is stimulating the
building industry, in which nearly every
trade and class of labor is directly Inter
ested. Increased building operations mean
greater opportunities for mechanics of
nearly every kind, larger markets, for
lumber, iron and other products that go
to malting houses and increased sales for
furnishings, all of which means increased
prosperity for the community at large.
Lang and his son are from Roxbury.
Mass. The elder Lang has lived here
some months looking after the interest of
the company. W. Campbell, also of Rox
bury, in the absence of H. C. Converse
has been acting as superintendent. He
was unable to meet last month's pay roll
for a short time, and the miners quit
work. Campbell has since been running
the pump to keep the water down.
To-day he came to Sonora on business,
bringing Kackey with him. He then sent
Mackey back to the mine to run the pump
during his absence. On arriving Mackey
found young Lang in charge, and he told
Lang he was sent to run the pump. Lang
refused to give up his position, and words
followed. Mackey went away, but soon
returned with a shotgun and fired at
Lang. The shot took effect .In the hip. If
the wound does not prove, fatal It is
feared Lang will be a cripple for life.
SONORA, July 18.â At the Draper mine,
near Soulsbyvllle, James Mackey, a mill
man, shot and seriously If not fatally
wounded Henry Lang, son of John P.
Lang, one of the directors* and principal
stockholder of the Draper Mining Com
pany.
Special IHrpatch to The Call.
CODY, Wye, July 18.â Thomas Gorman,
the escaped murderer, was captured early
to-day by Charles Smith and Hal Sweeney
on upper Shell Creek, In the Big Horn
Mountains. He was still unarmed and
made no resistance. To reach this point
Gorman swam the "Blgr Horn River, an al
most Impossible .feat, and traveled over
fifty miles of the roughest mountain coun
try- He la now In Jail. There are, special
guards on duty, but It Is believed that
Gorman, who murdered his brother, and
Walters, the murderer of Mrs. Hoover,
will both be lynched.
On Wednesday evening Sheriff Fenton
received Information that a party of citi
zens from Shell and Paint Rock, in this
county, were coming down to Basin to
lynch Gorman and Walters. . Acting upon
this information the Sheriff handcuffed
both prisoners and two armed ' deputies
secretly removed them to a canyon about
two miles from town. When nearly to
their destination Gorman, who is a pow
erful man, suddenly wrenched off his
handcuffs and broke for the surrounding
shrubbery. - One of the guards started In
pursuit and fired several shots at the fugi
tive, but he escaped In the darkness.
Walters, the other prisoner, made no at
tempt to escape.
Information was Instantly sent to town
and a number of mounted men started In
pursuit. The chase ended in his capture
to-day. .,;X : :tl. , - .

WHISKY CRAZED HIM
Drink - Sodden Son Brutally Beats His
Aged Mother â A Drunkard's
Dreadful Deed,
"George J. Crane, who brutally beat his aged mother at their home,
Germania place, -while hewas under the influence of liquor, was found guilty
by a jury before Judge Lawlor yesterday of assault with intent to do great
bodily harm. Crane not only beat bis mother, who is 70 years of age, but
left her weak and bleeding from bis blows to continue the debauch which led
to the assault. It developed that young Crane was in the habit of filling him-
self with liquor, amusing himsrlf by beating bis mother, and then, when bis
money was gone, of sobering up at the home of a friend.- During bis prelim-
inary examination bis mother pleaded for his release, and was an unwilling
witness, but the testimony of the neighbors was 'sufficiently strong to warrant
bis being convicted."â San Francisco Chronicle.
When all was over the shame-stricken son stood in the jail corridor
trying to make his nervous fingers roll a cigarette, but the tobacco fell to the
floor. His face hardened as he saw the evident despicable position he occu-
pied In the view of those about him. /.
''Yes, whisky was the cause!" the prisoner admitted.

It is in the field of fiction particularly

practically marks the opening of the au

than twenty-six books, which will be Is
sued at the rate of two or three a week.
Twelve books are to be published in what
is supposed to be the "deadest" of all the
Midsummer is past and we are now en
tering upon what is commonly called the
dead season in the book world.' Former
ly it was considered that during the pe
riod of the summer holidays new books
had no chance of success, competing, as
they do then, with those outdoor pleas
ures usually associated with July and
August. This led to the damming up of
the literary stream until October, when
the floods were let loose, to tho distrac
tion of readers and critics alike.
Hall Caine was one of the first to see
the advantage of breaking through this
illogical custom and by publishing "The
Manxman" and its successors in the
depth of the dead season he secured at
tention that might otherwise have been
missed.' Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦

. In no respect is the contrast between thecattitude of the people of the two countries toward uni
versity education more striking than in the amount of donations given for higher. education by men
and women of wealth. It appears that during the period from 187 1 to 1901 the amount of private
gifts to universities in America was eight times greater than the amount given for such purposes in
Great Britain. The presentation of the facts is calculated to rouse British leaders to a recognition of
the importance of providing the youth of the country with instruction that will enable Great Britain
to compete with American and German experts, who are rapidly, dominating the industrial world.
Whatever be the effect, therefore, of the education act upon primary instruction, it appears certain
that something like a radical change will soon be made in the facilities for higher education in the
United Kingdom; V , r ~ ;
ONE of the effects of the anxiety felt in Great Britain over the rivalry of the United States
and Germany with her manufacturers and her merchants has been an increased attention
to the subject of education. At the present time something like an educational boom is
going on in the United Kingdom. In addition to the new education act, which is, unfor
tunately, a subject not only of partisan but of sectarian controversy and bitterness, there is a vigorous
movement toward improving and extending facilities for higher education. A great school of tech
nology has been projected for London and will doubtless be speedily undertaken, for a number of
wealthy men have offered to give liberal endowments to the institution provided the Government will
assure its foundation and niaintenance.
Another evidence of the increased interest in higher education is seen in the agitation for an
improvement of the universities so as to provide for the education of a larger number of students and
for giving instruction in branches of learning demanded by the needs of the age. As a part of that
agitation Nature has recently compiled a series of statistics showing how far Great Britain is behind
the United States and Germany in the matter of university training. The figures show that in Great
Britain there is only one student in the universities for every 10,000 inhabitants, while Germany has
7.87 students and the United States no less than 12.76 students.
Reviewing the contrast between the United States and Great Britain more in detail, the writer
goes on to say: "In the older country there are but thirteen universities and twenty university col
leges, whereas in the United States there are 170 colleges with an endowment of over $100,000 and
forty-nine of these have endowments of over $500,000, while three of them have an endowment of
over $10,000,000. The total number pf professors and instructors in universities and colleges in
cluded in the liÂ§Jr of the United States commission of education is 17,000, whereas the number of day
students imthe universities and university colleges of Great Britain is only about 20,500, so that there
are almost as many university teachers in the United States as there are university students in Great
Britain."

Brown of the museum and Professor LÂ»ull
of Amherst College, who together did the

first earning upon one #f the horns pro

of a small branch of the Missouri, ab<v:t
125 mOes southwest of Miles City. Fol
lowing the clew of the protruding bit of
horn, the fossil experts carefully removed
and scraped away the sand till the whole
form and size of the specimen was clearly
outlined. The head lay flat, with the
horns pointing upward, just as he evi

The restoration of the animal made by
C. H. Knight under the direction of Pro
fessor Osborn. which is here pictured,
gives a good idea of its peculiar head, as
well as the rest of its huge and wonderful
body. He was about twenty-five feet long,
twice the size of the bulk of a large ele
phant and weigtied ten tons and more.
The monster fed on leaves and plants
of the tropical vegetation which was
abundant in that region in his time, and
he wanted not a little for his sustenance.
For a day's rations he would consume
from. 200 to 500 pounds of these for food.
The conspicuous feature of triceratops
was his armored head. Over each eye
there grew a pair of sharp, massive
horns, pointing upward. The skull pro

in a sort of spreading frill. As a fighter

cally unconquerable. His powerful head

such a weighty body.
ONE of the most remarkable and
noteworthy fossil finds yet re
ported on In this country or else
where has been recently made
by an expedition sen| out by the Ameri
can Museum of Natural History, planned
and directed by Professor Henry F. Os
toorn. head of the department of paleon
tology. The discovers' consists of un
earthing in the southeastern portion of
Montana almost the complete skull of the
huge exUnct monster known as tricera
tops. The giant creature's head measures
7*4 feet in length by 5Vi feet wide, making
it the worlds record-breaking specimen so
far obtained. Numerous smaller ones have
been found by Professor Marsh of Yale
arid others, but none equaling in dimen
sions or the same state of preservation
has been dug up. With the exception of a
portion of the two horns and a short sec
tion of the sr.out, the specimen Is com
plete. An Idea of the sixe of the mon
ster's head can be gleaned from the figure
of a man with outstretched hands, which
just about spars the two tips of the crea
tUTe's skull. The great head would easily
afford a dining board for twelve men to
gather around. The huge beast lived dur
ing the cretaceous period and age of rep
tiles, variously estimated to have been
from 3.000,000 to 10.000,000 years ago. As he
roamed the marshes and banks of the
great inland lake which in remote times
cpvered the State of Montana, and nearly
the whole of the section of country west
of the Rocky Mountain?, he was doubt
less the largest and most formidable beast
of his time.
An interesting competition Is to be car
ried out under the aegis of the Aeronaut
ical Society of Great Britain to ascertain
the maximum height to which it is pos
sible to fly kites. The trials will take
place on the Sussex downs. The contest
is of an- international character, so as to
obtain considerable data relative to the
utility of kites with which to attain high
altitudes. Ther^ is no stipulation regard
ing the size of the kites, but only single
kites must be employed and a height of
3000 feet is fixed as the minimum. The
duration of flight must be one hour. Each
kite will carry a weight of two pounds
to represent scientific Instruments. Sev
eral enthusiastic kite flyers, have decided
to participate in the contest. Various
materials in the manufacture of kites
will be employed. Most of them will be
made of canvas, but one will be flown
constructed of aluminum. This is a de
cided novelty, but it is anticipated that
it will work satisfactorily. The string
Is steel wire wound upon a big reel and
weighing fifteen pounds to the mile, bo
that at an elevation of 15,840 feet the kite
will have to support a weight of forty
five pounds. There will also be an exhi
bition flight by Patrick Alexander of al
most every kind of kite used by man, in
clusive of the Japanese and Chinese. In
the event of there being insufficient wind
to lift the kites from a stationary position
it Is proposed to employ motor cars to
give them a flying start in precisely tho
came manner in which a boy runs, drag
ging his kite behind him, in order to ob
tain sufficient atmospheric resistance to
cause the kite to rise.
The Investigation is now in progress in
Northern Florida and Southern Alabama
and Georgia under the direction of
Ernest A. Sterling. H. J. Tompkins, with
a email corps of assistants, has begun the
work in Minnesota. Wis., and Michigan.
Later in the season a study of forest
fires will be made on the Pacific Coast.
In connection with this detailed study
the agents will observe the methods of
fire protection practiced by railroads and
other owners of timber lands. p .The fire
warden system of the States which have
forest fire laws, and the patrol system in
use on the Federal forest reserves will
also be observed closely.
By such methods the Bureau of For
estry hopes to replace with carefully
gathered facts the vague general notions
that now exist about forest fires. When
the problem is solved for any particular
region the bureau will be ready to recom
mend methods of fire protection and con
trol for the private land-owner, and to
suggest forest fire legislation* for the
various States.
The Bureau of Forestry has this year
undertaken a thorough study of the for
est fire problem in several different re
gions. It has placed men in forest dis
tricts to study fires while in the process
of burning. Instead of waiting until the
flres ore over and relyir.gr for informa
tion on local reports, as has been done
heretofore, the fires are now being ob
served by the bureau's agents and full
data will be obtained as to how they
were caused, how fast they burn, what
conditions favor or hinder them, and Just
what damage they do to the soil anoi to
tree growth. Each agent of the bureau
has been assigned to a district and is in
vestigating all fires that occur within his
territory. For example, one man studies
a lumber tract, another a farming' dis
trict, a third a turpentine orchard, etc.
L<est year within two weeks over $12,
000,003 worth of timber and other property
was destroyed by forest fires in Oregon
and Washington. This enormous loss oc
curred upon a restricted area and rep
resents only a^very small part of the an
nual loss from this source. Every tim
bered region of the United"**6tates suffers
j - ear after year from fire. The annual
loss is estimated at from $23,000,000 to $50,
000.000. Forest fires have been regarded
as almost inevitable, and few systematic
attempts have been made to prevent or
control them except in tho States of
New York, Pennsylvania and Minnesota,
which have efficient systems of fire pro
tection.

* In view of these large matters, of such supreme interest to us and the world, which Secretary
Hay has accomplished, it is merely amusing to read the attack made upon him and the President by
the Hearst papers in connection with the Jewish petition. While Mr. Hay is making prestige for his
country, those papers are trying to make capital for a party. Their attitude is an insult to every in"
telligent Jew in the country. They have, indeed, found here an open door to every opportunity of
life, and they are not to be led into a raid upon this Government nor this administration by the
young-man-stuck-on-himself. ,
. Russia seems to awaken slowly to things. A Perhaps her lack of alertness is due to her auto
cratic 1 form, which in its domestic administration takes its time, no matter who may be slaughtered
in Kishenev or starving in a dungeon or freezing in. North Siberia. So Russia pinched herself into
the conviction that she wanted all the trade of Manchuria, and that to open a door there to her com
mercial competitors would subject her to the 'inconvenience of working for commerce instead of seiz
ing by military force. Hence the proposition to limit entry of her ports to her own ships and active
preparations to permanently occupy Manchuria'. All of this was in violation of the open door agree
ment and of the convention which followed the occupation of Peking. But the other nations, except
Japan, were slow to anger at this bad faith. Actuated probably by commercial jealousy of the
United States, they seemed willing. to. permit the triumph of diplomatic lying for Russia's benefit,
that they might use her breach of agreement as an excuse for declaring the open-door convention ob
soleted for all because. violated by one. This put the United States in a most difficult position, cal
culated to try to the extreme the diplomatic genius of Seqretary Hay.
' It is gratifying to his countrymen' that he has won the most significant victory in the history
of diplomacy, and that Russia" has pledged to both this country and Japan to make no opposition to
the open door in Manchuria. It is gratifying that he won this for the world, for the nations that had
looked unmoved upon the aggressions of Russia/ and for the commerce of peoples whose govern
ments, instead of trying to correct Russia's attitude, were willing to use it as' a precedent in the in
terest of their own selfishness.
The appearance of the United States in world politics, under Mr. Hay's guidance, has been
conspicuously honorable. It has been attended by novel features. Fearing no one, able to take care
of ourselves against the world in arms, we have entered the larger sphere of influence and interests,
free of any need to use the methods of intrigue and indirection in our international affairs. Half
the foreign offices of the world are aghast at our frankness, and all the world is impressed by our
unselfishness, which improves an exclusive opportunity with Russia to secure a binding pledge of ben
efits which all nations share alike.
SECRETARY n HAY pioneered in the movement to commit the powers to the policy of an
i open door for trade in China. He succeeded. Then ensued a symptom of Russia's defection
Irom that agreement in the^'fprm of ;a ukase from the Czar proposing, at a date fixed, to limit
entry of Russian ports to Russian ships., Afthe.time we pointed out that this foreshadowed
Russia's 'intention to control .Chinese ports, and apply to them this limitation. It is entirely within
the powerof Russia to abrogate her commercial treaties and close her harbors to foreign merchant
men. That policy is like our regulation of our coastwise trade and trade between our own ports,
which we limit to American ships'. It is not a great stretch of policy from that to closing the ports
of a country to all but its own bottoms. It^vill be seen, then, that Secretary Hay had a timely vision
of the importance of 'the, Chinese trade and bound the commercial countries in an agreement that its
door should be open to all. The nations, after long discussion with our State Department, agreed
to this, and therefore each was bound to that policy within its zone of influence. 4

CORN CROP CAUSES WORRY.
â¢ The weakness which developed last
week in New York Central on the as
sumption that it needs for funds musÂ«
be met by some new capital issues, with
the dansrer of a repetition of the expe
rience met In the flotation of the new
Pennsylvania stock issueâ spread general
ly throughout the district as it became
known that various railroad corporatldns
had Vlmilar need for funds, which' they
'were supplying by temporary loans, pay
ing high rates of interest rather than at
tempt to sell securities at a sacrifice in
the present unfavorable market. This was
not a strictly new situation, as it had
been known for some time that the roads
sharing in the new control of Hocking
Valley had given their names on a 6 per
cent basis. An extension of a maturing
service bond of the Burlington for two'
years on a 4 per cent basis was also a
plain symptom of the disinclination of
railroad corporations to attempt any
large new issues at this time. The vio
lent decline in Pennsylvania shares In
connection with the new Issue of stock
was a conclusive demonstration of the
unfit condition of the market to absorb
new Issues even of high grade and the
confession of newer Industrial issues, in
the market had been notorious for
months. Nevertheless acute uneasiness
over the money situation at present and
prospective was caused by the announce
ment that the Burlington had borrowed
$5,000,000 until next March and the Union
Pacific $10,000,000 for a year and a half on
a 6 per cent basis. Many rumors there
upon became current of large prospective
borrowings by various railroads and of
the conseauent inroads to be made upon
money supplies. The market took on a
tone of demoralization on Wednesday and
grave fears began to be felt of the
consequence of the shrinkage of
values. On that day the influential bank
ers in the Clearing-house also took
counsel among themselves and allowed
it to become known that careful Inves
tigation had assured them of the sound
ness of the banking situation and the
safety of the position of all city banks
and trust companies so far as they could
ascertain. The bankers were averse to
making formal announcement of the fact
until the result of such an investigation
on the ground that unfavorable influences
might bÂ« drawn from Its being' thought
necessary to take such steps. But the
ground for confidence resulting from the
canvass was commonly known in the
financial district and had a notable effect
in reassuring sentiment. ( .
FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET.
Another fact that Wad a .strong effect
in restraining confidence was the sharp
response of the foreign exchange market
to tho rise In the domestic money mar
ket. The strength which has been main
tained in the exchange market and the
sustained outward movement of gold, in
view of the disparity in Interest rates,
had an effect abroad on the part of for
eign capital which gave small hope of re
lief for domestic money needs from that
source. But on Thursday there' was a
precipitate break in foreign exchange
which transformed the situation from
one of apprehension of further gold ex
ports to a prospect that gold could be
brought in on occasion of need. Foreign
banking houses offered large sums of
money in the New York market. It was
learned that a large proportion of the
Union Pacific and Burlington notes had
been taken by foreign capitalists. The
buying of stocks in the New York mar
ket for, foreign account was also said to
be on a liberal' scale, although this move
ment was more obscure, as the decline in
prices had been so much more rapid than
in London. Sales in London were cov
ered here at the decline.
The rally in the stpek market which re
sulted in the latter part of the week
wiped out a large portion of the earlier
losses and some of the active stocks were
lifted above last Saturday's level. Some
of the most sensational movements of the
week were in high-grade investment
stocks, which were largely traded in.
Some of these broke scores of points on
small transactions. The limited amount
of the sales and the quick . recovery in
such stocks on the purchase . of equally
small amounts precludes the idea of any
general liquidation going on in these prop
erties ... or any unfavorable Â¦ developments
regarding the. properties themselves. The
marking : down of market prices of the
high-grade investment-, stocks and .of
mortgage bonds is a clear"intlmatiqn of
the general tendency to adjust prices to
the new interest basis, i With the prospect
of six per' cent interest rates for an in
definite period there is little inducement
to hold securities on a 3% or a 4 per cent
basis. . .' Â¦Â».
NEW YORK CENTBAL.
NEW YORK, July 18.â To-day's trade
in the stock" market '"was dull and pro
fessional. The tone of the narrow specu
lation showed sentiment very doubtful
and hesitating. Stocks were sold early
in the day on the assumption that yester
day's upward movement had discounted
h favorable bank statement, so that no
further rise could be expected after Its
publication. There was a momentary
rally when the statement appeared, but
the selling was renewed and prices reced
ed" to a level substantially below last
night, closing dull and heavy, without any
rally. The gain in cash was almost twice
as much as had been anticipated, but the
small loan contraction was a disappoint
ment in view of the heavy liquidation in
the stock market. It was hoped that the
large portion of the week's railroad cor
poration loans, which were abroad and
the fact that the Pennsylvania Company
has begun the repayment of its six
months' notes, would result in a sub
stantial contraction of loan obligations.
The fact that the decrease only amounts
to $2,513,500, gave rise. to a supposition that
the banks have been putting out some re
newed loans on a large-scale to private
individuals with the proceeds of the
week's liquidation.
Pressure upon Amalgamated Copper was
renewed and Its decline of nearly 2 points
and the weakness of St. Paul and a 3
polnt drop in Consolidated Gas caused a
bad impression upon sentiment. Rock
Island was again forced down to yester
day's low level. New York Central was
supported and recorded a 1-polnt decline.
The Toledo. St. Louis and Western stock*
made sharp rallies from yesterday's vio
lent breaks. There was a large-belated de
cline in some of the active stocks, which
had not been traded in during the late
periods of reactio^The encouraged views
of business, expressed by weekly com
mercial reviews and the large percentage
of increase In gross earnings of railroads
according to latest reports, were ignored
in trading. Heavy liquidation in the stock,
market has been In progress during the"
week without any developments in the
general business and industrial situation
to adequately account for it.

Brown's rooms clothing: and Jew
elry to the value of 5125. Mrs. Brown
said that Miss Root was a third cousin to
her husband and was In the habit of get
ting on a "jamboree." Detective Dlnan
was detailed on the case.
The camp has been prepared for the
coming of the soldiery by the usual ad
vance guard under Captain M. W. Simp
son and Lieutenant j Smiley. The camp
patiently awaits the arrival of the lads. It
is entirely in readiness and offers all the
comforts of camp life. The citizens of
Healdsburg will accord them a, most hos
pitable welcome, and if the week in camp
is not an enjoyable one it will be the fault
of the soldiers. The tents have all been
erected under shady madrono trees, which
will afford an abundant shade during the
day", and electric lights have been strung
throughout the camp to diffuse light after
nightfall. Telephones reaching to the
business center of Healdsburg have been
Installed for convenience, and the com
missary tents and stables for the twenty
five horses needed in the camp have been
erected, and the thousand and one de
tails necessary have been attended to.
SANTA ROSA, July 18.â The . various
companies of the Fifth Regiment,: Na
tional Guard of California, assembled late
to-night at Healdsburg 1 , where they will
go into camp for eight days' instruction.
The camp has been named Camp War
field, In honor of Brigadier General R. H.
Warfleld, commanding the . Second
Brigade. It is located at Matheson's
Grove, on the banks of Russian River.
' The companies from Oakland, San Jose,
Alameda and Livermore departed from
Ban Francisco on a special . boat at 7:30
to-night. A special train .of fifteen coaches
was waiting Â¦ to [ transport the \ men from
Tiburon. Company I> of San Rafael, C
of Petaluma and E of Santa Rosa and H
of Napa were picked up en route, and the
arrival at Healdsburg was made shortly
after 10 o'clock. There are over 400 men
In camp, in additon to the officers. Com
pany H came over from Napa on the even
ing train, and was escorted from the
depot to the armory of CompanyE; where
a collation was served. This was much
appreciated by the visitors, who voted
the local company jolly good fellows. The
visitors took short strolls around the City
of Roses, and rested in the armory until
time to depart for the train to-night.
The special carried a happy crowd of
militiamen- to the camp, and it bias fair
to be the most Interesting and Instructive
one ever held by the Fifth Regiment. The
daily routine includes l.two drills each
morning, some in extended and / others
in close order. In addition there 'will be
a dress parade and guard mount, with a
retreat each evening during the encamp
ment. The camp will be broken next Sun
day evening, and the companies will be
returned to their respective places of
abode.

TRIAL OF WHTTELAW
THE Fifth Infantry Regiment of
the National Guard of California,
Colonel J. F. Hayes - commanding*
left last evening: by the California
j and Northwestern road for Camp
Warfleld at Healdsburg, for military in
struction for eight days. On the way up
the train took on the company at San
Rafael, the one at Petaluma and the one
at Santa Rosa. The ones that started
from Tiburon are' the two companies at
Oakland, the one infAlameda, the one in
Livermore and the one in- San Jose.
The rules issued for camp require that
there shall be three roll calls daily, reveil
le, retreat and tattoo.
Colonel Hayes, who but recently took
command of the regiment, has proven
himself a very energetic and enthusias
tic commander and it will be his aim
during camp to have the men under him
obtain as much military instruction as it
is possible to impart in the limited time
of camp life. From the routine of drill
it is apparent that there will be plenty of
practical work, j
Colonel Chadbourne (retired) will visit
the camp and be the special guest of Col
onel Hayes, who has secured a fine black
charger for the visitor's use.
Next Tuesday night there will be a
meeting of the board of officers of the
naval militia at this port for the purpose
of devising ways to secure a better at
tendance at drills by the enlisted men.
Commander Bauer will preside at an
election on July 28 on the Marion for

Resolved. That the members of Camp RÂ»ln
hold Richter No. 127, Spanish-American War
.Veterans, do from this time forth exert them
selves, to the best of their ability, to prevent
desecration. In the future of Memorial day by
other societies, organizations or orders, and
we do hereby pledge ourselves as members of
Camp Reinhold Richter to do all in our power
to see that Memorial day Is properly observsd.
J. E. TREWIN
(Chairman),
H. T. SrME, *â¢
THOMAS W. COSTELLO.
The following 1 preamble and resolution
was adopted at the last held meeting: of
Camp Reinhold Richter of the , Spanish-
American War Veterans:
Whereas. Since the great Civil War of- '01
to '65, it has become the custom to set aside
May 30 of each year as a day for the purpose
of holcllns? memorial services for the orav*
men who had given their lives in defense of
tl'ls country in that war and other, conflicts In
v.-hich it has been engaged; and whereas, we
as Spanish-American War \'eterans and mem
bers Camp Reihnold Richter No. 127. Spanish-
American War Veterans, do think it fitting:,
proper and only just that such a day be ret
aside; and whereas, it has become noticeable
that the following organizations â Sons of St.
George, "Caledonian Club, Mail Clerks. Civil
Service Employes and numerous church*s â
have in the last few years so far forgotten
the real purpose and significance of Memorial
day services as to hold picnics, excursions and
outing* on that day, we feel, that as members
of Camp Reinhold Richter No. 127, Spantah-
American War Veterans, it Is our duty to en
ter protest against any such actions and en
deavor to prevent future desecration of Ihe
day we hold sacred; therefore, be it
Protest Against Picnics and Outings
on Date Sacred to Memory
of Soldier Dead.

; Desertion is also charged in the suit for

Lila S. Martin is also tired of matri
mony, or rather of Charles M. Martin, to
whom she was married -at Westfleld, ,N.
J.,, in July, 1900. She alleees,.in a com
plaint for divorce that he deserted her
more than a year ago. â¢
Nellie: Hlggins is t/.so an abandoned
,wife according to a suit for divorce she
filed yesterday. She says that â¢ Frederick
Hlggins, whose wife she became in this
city October 17, 1SS5, deserted her In Janu
ary.' 1897. . ,
The divorce law Is proving a very useful
statute to Perry B. Folsom. It has en
abled him to secure a severance of ' the
fetters that bound him to Mrs. Folsom
No. 1, and he is now seeking its aid to rid
j himself of No. 2. Yesterday he filed a suit
for the annulment of. his marriage to Isa
bel E. Folaom, his second x wife, on- the
ground that in his ignorance of the law
he married her before a year from the
time he secured, a divorce from his first
choice had elapsed. "
The second marriage took place at Sac
ramento April 24, 1900. He was divorced
from his first wife November 21, 1899. "He
says he did not discover that he should
( not have been in such a hurry In select
ing his first wife's successor until the first
of the present month, j The suit of yester
day is the result of his awakening.
Annie McCarthy has been married less
than two months, having bÂ«come the wife
of William McCarthy May 20 last, but she
is already desirous of becoming a grass
widow. In a suit for divorce filed by her
yesterday she alleges that she has been
so brutally treated by her husband that
she fears for her life should she continue
to live with him longer. '

In advance. In order that the latter would
be able to travel more comfortably on
the night train. One of the tickets, pur
chased in Chicago, was given to the
maid, but when the train had started on
its way" the ticket agent, whose duty it
is to Â¦ ko through the .train and Inspect
the tickets, refused to accept the one
presented by. the maid because it was
not signed by her. The woman insisted
that it was her property and explained
how it came to bear the - signature â¢ of
her mistress, but the train agent was not
satisfied, and against all protests of the
maid and sympathizing: passengers, who
keenly appreciated .the predicament of thÂ©
unfortunate woman, she was ordered off
the train when it stopped at Port Costa.
! The ' maid, being a stranger in Califor
nia and alone in Port Costa, was for a
time In a high nervous state bordering
on hysteria, and it was her : pitiable plight
that appealed to several persons at the
station, who finally, comforted her with
the assurance that she would be able
to return to San Francisco later In " the
evening, which she did. arriving at the
apartments of her mistress at.the Palace
Hotel shortly before the return from the
theater of Miss Leavey, who then learned
for the first time of the trouble that had
been experienced by her maid.
Because her overland ticket failed to

of the conductor in charge, of the train
a woman, having: in charge a three-year
old child, was put off the south-bound
overland last evening at Port Costa and,
finally realizing her helplessness, several
persons at the gloomy little station took
her and the child In charge and sent them
back to this city on a later train.
The unfortunate woman is the maid of

Mr. Axman explains that delay in the
work upon the channel t has been occa
sioned by many causes. The sub-contrac
tor was hindered In completing the bulk
head because of the Interference of the
Plledrivers* Union. Then there was a
spell of unusually stormy weather between
May 14 and May 22, inclusive. The gales
wrecked the bulkhead and prevented the
operation. of the towboat. "As soon as my
plant is again ready for operation," says
Mr." Axman, "I will resume the work of
dredging San Pablo Bay more vigorously
than ever." â¢
Rudolf Axman says that he will resume
dredging on the flat in San Pablo Bay to
make a deep-water channel to the Mare
Island Navy-yard. He explains , that his
dredger was removed from the flat that
machinery may be added to his plant. A
floating spud and other appliances were
found to be needed. -The dredger was
taken away on June 23, and Colonel
Heuer, United States Engineer, was noti
fied of the removal. A barge was anchor
ed in the channel in San Pablo Bay where
work had been performed, and also other
parts Â¦ of the plant, including barges,
dolphins, chains, anchors, etc.

Mr. Felton said:
FELTON'S SUGGESTION.
It transpires that the first question con
sidered in the executive session of the
beard was whether Immediate action
should be taken In the selection of a
Warden to succeed Martin AguUre. The
decision was quickly made In' the affirm
ative. No oroposition for further delay
Â¦was presented. No request was made for
postponement until Director Devlin's ' re
turn from Europe. It was the Judgment
of thÂ«Â» four Directors present that the
time had arrived for decisive action.
"Recently the Governor has signified his
willingness to withdraw his objections to
Major Tompklns, and as a result the
board has become a unit for its first
choice and agreed to his appointment to
the position of Warden at San Quentin.
"The date of September 1 for the as
eutnption of his duties has been fixed to
allow the retiring- VTarden ample time to
close his accounts, -nak<? proper Invento

The meeting was he'.d In the office of Di
rector Fitzgerald, at 530 California street.
Those present were Directors Robert M.
Fitzgerald. James M. Wllklns, Charles N.
Folton and Don Ray. The other member
of the board, Robert T. Devlin, is at pres
ent traveling: in Europe.
'â¢His appointment was not made before
because Governor Pardee raised an objec
tion to him. What this objection was I
prefer to have the Governor state. I will
say that It was not based on political
grounds and had nothing to do with
T.ompkins' private character.
GOVERNOR OBJECTS.
"The board desires to announce," he
Raid, "that Major Tompkins has all along
been the first choice of its members, and
without any disparagement to the other
candidates mentioned in connection with
the office it has considered him best fitted
to fill the duties of the position.
Senator Charles N. Felton. another of
the directors, then took up the burden of
the talk. speaking for and In the presence
of the three other Directors.
"The Uoard of Prison Directors," he
paid, "has informally determined that
Nathan Tornpkins of Oakland shall be the
next Warden at San Quentin, to succeed
Martin Aguirre. The formal election will
take place at the next regular meeting of
the board, when a clerk will be present to
record our proceedings. The new Warden
will resume his duties on September 1 of

keeper, who : was- the '. last to see the
stranger alive, r . ''';-.
."The man talked like an Englishman and
acted like an Englishman," said Carman.
"He was in my place yesterday morning
between .U_ and 12 'o'clock, and I had a
chance to size him. up. He came In about
11 o'clock and- asked'for a glass of water,
which I gave him. i Ho said, 'I see you've
got your revenue license,' . and "I said,
'Yes.' He looked like a man I saw. a few
days ago when I was getting my revenue
license in San Francisco,. and, I took him
for an inspector. After sitting around for
an hour/in front of my place, he went
away upon hearing the 12 o'clock .whistle
and; that was the last I saw O f him
until this morning, when Mrs. Wilson
came to tell me she had found his , body.
I knew it was the same man the moment
I saw the. body." * . ' '
WATCH FOUND ON BODY.
The marks on the cartridges, however,
go further in support of the murder the
ory than do the forehead indentation. The
revolver taken from the man's death
grasp is a seven chambered weapon, six
chambers of which were tilled. The cart
ridge next to the empty chamber was dis
charged, the next was intact and wholly
unmarked, but the next one to if was
discharged. How one of the bullets was
skipped is the mystery In the case, as
the experts do not believe the man him
self could have done it after once shoot
ing himself.
These suspicious conditions caused Cor
â¢oner Mehrmanij t to Jw-der Dr. Gladding to
make a jndfs^caref uj''an^p^y, f 'wtilcn\wa9
done to-night." Dr. Gladding found a frac
ture of the skull where the' indentation
on the forehead' was, and this caused him
to announce that 4 there were enough in
dications to warrant the theory, of mur
der. . . . *i Â¦ . . â¢
"It would seem," said Dr. Gladding,
"that the man. was struck on the head
aryl possibly the bullets were lired into
tie head in order': to cover up the first
/.Ime, or to' complete the deadly work."
The body was found by a son of Mrs.
Annie K. Wilson. While driving some
ducks into a'tield the boy saw what he
thought to, be a tramp lying near the
barn. He reported his discovery to his
mother, who afterward went to the spot
and tried to. arouse the man. When he
did not awake, she pulled his ear and
then to her Horror discovered that he was
dead. She ran to her neighbors with the
story of the discovery and later the Cor
oner was summoned to take the' body to
the Morgue. ,
â¢ Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2118 Center Street, July 18.
The body of an elderly, well dressed
man, whose Identity is so far a closed
book, was found this morning on the
north side of John 1 Bernnan's barn on
San Pablo avenue, near Harrison street.
There were two bullet holes in the head
and tfte skull was fractured- The autop
sy surgeon, Dr. Charles F. Gladding, says
the indications are that the man was
murdered.
When found the body was lying Â¦ face
downward oh the sward, within a few
feet of the north side of the barn, in full
view of passers by on San Pablo avenue.
The trunk rested on the right arm and
the right hand clutched a revolver. Two
of the six cartridges in the chambers of
the weapon were empty.
At first it seemed but a plain case of
suicide, but there were two unusual con
ditions. One of these was a suspicious
indentation in the forehead, the other the
manner in which the cartridge shells are
marked. The indentation in the head
seems to have been made by the butt end
of the revolver, f or* it tits the depression
exactly, indicating that the man might
have been struck on the head by thieves
or assassins, who afterward shot him and
left the pistol to divert suspicion.

It was another of those scrappy games
that have made* the present -series re
markable. Fight was the watchword
throughout and every man fought as hard
as he knew how. The result was doubt
ful till Leahy settled it all lh the ninth,
the score being tied up most of the time.
The last deadlock occurred In the eighth,
when the Senators fell on Hodaon and
landed for a pair of tallies.
The Senators opened the' game with one
of those old-time Baltimore starts, that
cause the pitchers to quiver. Casey fooled
around with the bat for several minutes,
and then he was good enough to foul out.
But Hiidebrand landed a nice hit to the
left garden, and McLaughlln did likewise,
so It looked troublesome-right there.
When Truck Egan grabbed hold of
his club and made an advance on the
plate every fan in the lot knew that
something was due to come off. And in
this they were not disappointed at all,
for, the husky Truck boosted the ball over
the fence that protects.center field and
all three runners came over the paths.
Then it looked bad for the home team.
Three runs is a big start, but Irwln and
his lads were game and they started in
soon . after to get them all back again.
In the first Shay worked Brown for a
pass and Meany sent him around to sec
ond with a fly to right field, which Mc-
Laughlln missed. Brown made a bad
throw and advanced them both, but it
was ho use, as Leahy struck out and all
the hope of the fans was crushed.
But in the fourth the locals got two
and one more in the fifth, so they had
the score . tied. Then they went to it
again and managed to bring in another
pair in the seventh, putting them two to
the good and apparently safe. But the
Senators created a tie In the eighth, when
Sheehan hit for two bases with the bags
filled. .
Tommy Leahy broke up the. little mati
nee at the Eighth-street ball park yes
terday 'afternoon. It was in the ninth
round. Meany rested on second Â¦ and .Ir
win was a base behind him. Leahy's bat
went square against the leather. 'Out to
the score board sped the ball and on to
the ' plate sped Pat Meany , and .all . was
over. Score. 6 to 5. .

* Twice as Much; i
â .NEW LONDON, Conn., July , l^There
was no room for doubt in the victory, of
the Reliance to-day In the second ran of
the New York Yacht Club cruise of thir
ty-nine miles- from -New Haven to this
port. She led from the start and finished
! more;than a mile ahead of the Constitu
tion and over two miles ahead of the Co
lumbia, beating the former six minutes
and twenty-nine seconds in elapsed time,
and the latter sixteen \nlnutea and twen
ty-four seconds. ; The Constitution 1 - beat
the' Columbia nine mlnutesiand fifty-five
seconds. -
Starting in a light favorable breeze the
Reliance within fifteen minutes was
three-quarters of a. mile ahead of the
other two boats, but when the wind in
creased, as' it did half an hour after the
start, the new boat did not gain. so rap
idly; in fact, for twenty miles of the run
made in a good twelve-knot breeze and
the wind forward of the beam, tlft Con
stitution held to the Reliance in fine
shape. Five miles from the finish, how
ever, the-new boat pulled away very rap
idly, while the Columbia steadily dropped
behind the other two after half of the
course had been covered. "
The Reliance covered the distance of
thirty-nine miles in three hours eighteen
minutes and twenty-eight seconds, a speed
of eleven and three-quarters knots an
hour, which la the fastest time ever made
on this run of the cruise.
The small boats were Bent off first, the
classes gradually '.Increasing in site until
at 10:15 the J three cup defenders were
started. The Reliance won the fight for
place, crossing the line twenty seconds
after the gun, Columbia a close second.
The Constitution was a poor third, cross
ing at the leeward end of the line some
seconds after 'the' handicap^ gun. The
wind at the start was light and within
fifteen minutes after crossing the line, the
Reliance had pulled out until she was
three-quarters of a mile ahead of the
other two boats, the Constitution having
at the same time come up even with the
Columbia. Soon tho wind began to pick
up and the Reliance passed Bramford
Beacon, five miles from the start, a full
mile ahead of the others. By 11 o'clock
the new boat was nearly a mile and a
half ahead.
OLD VIGILANT LEADS.
All the yachts covered the first twelve
miles of the cruise in a few seconds over
an .hour, having passed in the meantime
every boat in the fleet- "with! the_.exceptiori
of the old defender Vigilant, inow a. yawl,
which was still; ahead down the sound;
When off." the six-mile reef buoyi which
marked the half-way point of the- rwf,
the 'Constitution began, to gain on Reli
ance and at the same time began to drop
the Columbia quite rapidly.
The' Vigilant rounded the cornfield,
twenty-five miles from the start, a minute
ahead of the Reliance, but the new boat
went by 'her a few minutes after, as if
she were anchored. '
For the next five miles the Constitution
held the Reliance in excellent shape, but
as the boats neared -Bartlett's lightship,
thirty-six miles and a half on the course
and about two miles from the finish, they
met a strong flood tide setting in through
the race. This seemed to affect them
more than the Reliance, and the Columbia
worst of all. At Bartlett's the Reliance
v/as six minutes and twelve seconds ahead
of the Constitution and twelve minutes
and forty seconds ahead of the Columbia,
so that the race was practically settled at
that point. The Reliance gained, never
theless, on both the old boats, although
each of her rivals set her balloon jibs in
the hope of cutting down the lead of the
new flyer. â¢
The Reliance swept proudly across . the
finish line shortly after half) past 1 and
headed 'at once into the harbor, where
she had her sails almost furled* before a
heavy rain j began to fall. The official
times of the ninety-footers . in to-day's
run were:

FIVE CUP DEFENDERS.
To-night more than 300 yachts of all de
scriptions fairly choke tho . harbor's
mouth. In the fleet are no less than five
successful defenders . of the America's
cup, the schooner Columbia, the schooner
Puritan, the sloop , Volunteer, the yawl
Vigilant and the grand old Moop Colum
bia, whith defeated two Shamrocks in
1899 and 1901. . ; . - ;â¢ |
Just after sunset the southeast etorm
which had been threatening all day broke
in all its fury and at 8 o'clock it was
blowing a gale diagonally up New HaVen
harbor. The yachts anchored at the en
trance of the harbor had a hard time of It
and the old cup defender Volunteer, own
ed by J. Malcolm Forbes of Boston, drag
ged her anchor a short distance and at 9
o'clock was within fifty yards of the
rocks. The rest of the fleet rode out the
gale in good shape. The three cup yachts,
being .anchored well up the harbor, felt
little of its fury. A~ number of minor ac
cidents were reported. '

Despite the : extremely disagreeable
weather yesterday many- of . the. racket
wlelders were out for practice. The courts
did not dry up until afternoon, when some
exciting, matches were played. The" best
match on'the California Club courts was
that;between Dr. McChesney and Norman
Hodgkinson. the crack professional. The
medical man ' has been making rapid
'strides' of late, and many of the first class
men find it a difficult matter to beat him.
After losing' the first set yesterday he
took the next two from Hodgkinson. Mc-
Chesney has a* peculiar style, his smash
ing and serving being very hard to
handle.
Sidney Salisbury â¢ is devoting consider
able time to the game and has" also shown
steady Improvement. He played a close
match with .Will Allen and emerged a
winner after three hard sets. Allen la
playing a great game, and his defeat at
the hands of Salisbury was rather a sur

The old cabinetmaker's customers are
shops and private persons. With orders
from one or the other he is busy most of
the time. He has several clocks making
at once, po that he does not lose time in
waiting for stain or glue to dry. A few
familiar patterns are his models, and his
new clocks, when finished and set going,
look amazingly like those of a century
and a half ago.â New York Commercial.
An old German cabinetmaker, having
"got onto" the fashionable craze for old
fashioned tall clocks two or three years
ago, began at once making them, and
since then he has done little else.. His
little shop up town is scarcely wider than
the height of the clock he builds. There
he works all day long without help. A
kitchen stove close beside his workbench
serves to heat his glue pot. The rear of
the shop is filled with finished clock cases
awaiting theiri works. j
It is his fancy to make his clocks un
usually tallâ fully eight and a half feetâ
and he has made one case considerably
shorter just by way of showing what is
tbe style of ordinary clockmakers. His
material is usually new mahoguny, some
times veneered, sometimes solid, often In
laid and carved. The price of his clocks
varies' with the stylo of case and the
quality of the works. 'Â¦Â¦
It is this old man's patriotic German
belief that the best works for such clocks
come from Germany, and accordingly he
uses no other kind. The works cost from
$30 to 555, according to what they are
made to accomplish. The most expensive
are made to indicate not only hours, min
utes and seconds, but the phases of the
moon and the day of the month. A clock
consisting of the best works In a mahog
any case of the best workmanship that
the old man* can turn out fetches $130.
Others cost from $25 to $40 less.

"Long-Jj&sting Tastes.
"It is a curious thing how-the flavors
of certain things will come back to a man
after the lapse of many years," said an
observant man, "and often without any
sort of an excuse, unless we arc to rely
upon rather finely spun theories for an
excuse. Many years ago I took cod liver
oil. Men- who have taken cod liver oil
.will understand that there is no special
reason "why one should forget the pecu
liar flavor of this article. But my ex
perience is not simply a question of mem
ory. I have experienced the physical
fact, not once, but a number of times
islnce I quit taking It. Even to-day the
taste of cod liver oil came back to me,
and it was as fresh on my palate as it
was when I last put it there. Now. why
is this? Why should I taste cod liver oil
years after I quit taking It? I cannot
say. I cannot be mistaken when I say* I
experienced all the physical symptoms of
the taste. Were it not for this fact I
might account for it on the ground of
association. Some fact, or something or
other, intimately associated with the fact
of taking cod liver oil, might have caused
me to remember rather vividly the taste.
But things remembered, no matter how
vivid the picture, no matter how Intimate
the associated fact which brings the pic

a departure that the participants have
been invited to give a similar programme
at several adjacent towns in the near
future and the entertainment on August
20 will be the first of a series.

ENGAGEMENTS.
Nerve is certainly a useful commodity
at times, and keeps the ball rolling,, as
in the present instances, where people ara
out of town .struggling to kill time.
- EOPLE out of town at the
T" S^v resorts are drawing crowds
of admirers for their auto
>v y' mobiles as much as their
bank accounts. Every acci
" ** dent, seems to enhance â¢ the
fascinations of the wlcfced machine rather
than ' dampen the ardor of would-be
chauffeurs. Those who are spilled out
pull themselves together and with true
American * pluck get up more automobile
parties. x -,-'Â¦ â¢ v ;

To kill a deer is an ambition we all possess.
We are never too old or too young for this
sport. If we could only Jump up and "get
there" quick! In this respect the residents of
the bay counties have the advantage over the
residents of any other part of the United
States. Mendocino and Sonoma counties are
practically a deer park. and only a few hours'
ride from San Francisco. Leaving San Fran
cisco In the morning, the hunter reaches Wll
lits. In the heart of Mendocino County, In time
for dinner, and Geyservtlle, Cloverdale, Hop
land, Uklah and other Intermediate rail points
considerably, earlier. If you do not plug a deer
that evening you are In good shape for an
early morning start. The deer throughout this
section, along the California Northwestern
Railway, are more plentiful this season th~an
for years. The game has been well protected.
So many of the farmers take boarders, they
have learned the value of deer as an attrac
tion, and have Joined hands with the law in
protecting them.
The open season for deer In Sonoma County
is (from July 15 to August 31, Inclusive, and
In. Mendocino County until September 30, in
clusive.
For how many ir.onths does this "tale of his
shoot" interest himself, If not his friends.
His recital may vary, but no matter how many
he may tell of having seen after ehooting this
one, and how easily he could have brought
them -down (but not how many he may have
shot at) he will Invariably wind up by stat
ing that he is a "gentleman sport" and w.tuld
not kill more than the on*, that being suffi
cient for the time for himself and friends.
There Is nothing that affords so much pleas
ure to the busy denizen of the city as the kill
ing of a deer. How joyfully and buoyantly he
will carry^ to his camp or summer -boarding
house a load. that In the city he would con
sider fit only for a horse. With what pride he
will show it to us friends and dilate on 'the
details of his successful hunt. And If ladles
be present, he aoon begins to feel himself a
hero.

Stuart testified that his father, former
ly British Vice-Consul in Boston, was
found to be insane by experts who ex
amined him some years ago. He said
that Mr. Wentworth had declared that
doctors knew nothing about medicine.
"I know more about It than all of them
together," he had said. "Why, look at
me, I have dyspepsia and what do I. use,
for It? I use sand and the only reason
Is that the chickens use it. It does them
good and why should It not do' me good?"
Stuart told of many medicines which
Wentworth brought home and of many
concoctions which he would . try to mix,
some of which, such' as, whisky and oil,
would not\mix- Mr. Wentworth used to
take sandpaper and sandpaper his hands
and often the. top of his head. He said
It was a good thing for rough or chapped
hands, to make 'them smooth.

Southern California, where he conducted
some successful tests aimed against the
black scale which has been such a de
structive element In the southern groves.
He has found that fumigation of the
trees with cyanic acid to be the best
treatment, but on account of the' danger
attending the process It was not used ex
tensively.
A distillate obtained from crude oil of
28 degrees specific gravity he found to be
the safest spray, as It Is affective and U
not at all dangerous. Voids found that
it was a little late In the year to do as
much as he wanted' and will try hl3
sprays earlier next yÂ«ar. before the scale
has had time to get settled on the fruit.

ENDS SUFFERING
Mr. Bartlett was born in Springfield,
Mass., on October 7, ISIS. In 1SSS he-came
to California and after a short business
career in San Francisco decided to go
into the laundry business and associated
himself with George H. Hallett and P.
E. Dalton. Their Idea was the establish
ment of a white labor laundry, this line
of work at tliat time' being almost exclu
sively in the hands of Chinese. . They
organized the Contra Costa Laundry,
which was for some years located near
Mills College, on what is still known as
the "Laundry Farm." Later the institu
tion was moved to West Oakland, and it
was for years the largest laundry in the
world. They handled the laundry work
for the Pullman Palace Car Company and
many large concerns in San Francisco. "
Of late years other laundries have cut
into the work of the Contra Costa, and
last December the three original part-
enterprise for years, died sudden
ly at noontime to-day at his home on
Franklin street in this city. Mr. Bart-
Ifitt was in his eighty-fourth year, but
had not been ailing, and death is sup
posed to have occurred from the break
ing of a blood vessel in the brain.

thousand acres of pasture land in the

devastated by a fire which is still sweep

The stiff westerly^wind^ prevailing is
xnaking.it difficult for the fire fighters to
accomplish much in the way of controll
ing the spread of the flames. .
During the afternoon the mining vil
lages of Tesla and Carnegie were threat

caused the fire to race in another direc
tion. Residents of both of these places
have been guarding their homes since
last night and assisting settlers In the
nearby gulches In battling with the rav
aging element.
Corral Hollow was a eheet of flame last
night and the ridges extending south to
ward Lone Tree Creek and Mount Oso
resembled great fiery serpents. In the
timber belt the flames give the fire fight
ers the greatest trouble. When it ap
pears that they have the flre under con
trol a piece of blazing limb will drop
from a* tree, roll down the mountain side
and start the flames anew. If the west

the fire will reach the mouth of Lone Tree

ree Oil Painting
With Next Sunday's Call.
There is nothing in the wide, wide world quite so appealing as home.
Be it ever so humble there is no spot like the habitation of the individual
man. Kich or poor, high or low, good or bad, prince or pauper, the in-
_, clination is for home, and any picture that represents home ties or home
features touches the wannest spot in the hearts of all men and women.
Apropos of this, The San Francisco Call presents as its art supple-
â¢ ment next Sunday an oil painting which is a perfect reproduction in color
of the celebrated picture yby #Henry P. Smith entitled "The Old Home-
stead." It represents a New- England farmhouse and' possesses* artistic
qualities of the highest order. Its composition is well balanced, its color
harmonious and there is a satisfying fidelity in the completeness with
which the details are elaborated. There is an element of outdoors in the
â¢ whole beautiful scheme. The farmhouse, with its antique, cozy character,
its great elm tree in front, its rich greens surrounding and its air of
S shade, comfort and coziness are peculiarly attractive.
Smith, the artist, is one of the most successful of New York pic-
ture-makers and he is one bf the most cultivated men in the art world.
Hitherto he has devoted himself largely to Venetian scenes â pictures of
architectural wonders of the Old World. The, present effort is an innova-
tion; it passes from the grandeur of Granada and Seville to the homely^
comforts of a New England homestead.- The change shows great versatil-
ity in the artist and has in it an atmosphere that is peculiarly graceful
and charming.
California readers will be especially interested in this attractive pic-
ture of Eastern homeliness and natural luxury, conveying as it does a de-
licious sense of coolness that seems to exude from the canvas. . *

CHICAGO, July 18.â The start In wheat was
Kteady at a small decline on better cables and
small offerings, but lack of the latter brought
on a weak tone and September sold off from the
opening 77c. a loss of %c. to 70 V&C Trade was
quiet and featureless. -. There was a . temporary
reaction on fair buying* orders from St. Louis
which carried September up to 77%c. but it did
not hold. The close was weak at 7<)%c, a loss.
Of H& ; -
"There was fair support In corn early by local
traders, who bought at a. small decline but
the offerings were about equal to the demand
and some of the big commission houses exe
cuted selling orders on every bulge. ' Later sup
port became lacking and with free- liquidation
on favorable crop news the market turned weak

WHEATâ The foreign markets continued
featureless. Chicago was lower, with the bears
hammering the market. The Chicago letter, of
Bolton, De Ruyter &. Co. said:
"The market closes about half a cent lower.
There is nothinr new In the situation. The
foreign markets are dull. The estimate of the
trade is getting well established in respect to
the new crop. It will be a very moderate one.
The winter Wheat is of fine quality. It ia
conceded that domestic millers are bare of
stocks. The demand from this quarter Is In
evidence In every market. There Is a good deal
of talk about dullness of export business, but
exporters are not so free to report the volume
of their trade as formerly. In any event clear
ances are about the same as they were last
year. We see nothing in the conditions to make
Wheat sell below a fair price and much that
might make it sell higher."

higher prices In the country than here.

declined sharply. Choice offerings of other ber

good, except in some southern sections, wnere
the ranges are drying up and feed is becom
* Fall Â°wh4at continues to ripen nicely, and in
some few localities Its harvest has begun. The
crop is lighter than usual In Southern Oregon
and in the Urar.d Ronde Valley; It Is below the
average in th* Columbia RJver counties east
of the Cascade Mountains, but much better
than amicii>aiea & month ago. In the >>Â«
lamctte Valley it promises to be as good, II
r.ot better, than the average.
Spring wheat continues to Improve, ana u Â»s
he&dir^ and RliingN^iieely; the straw, as a
rule is rather short, but the heads are Â©I
good eiie and th* berry promises to be plump
and of a rood quality. ,
Oats Â«.re doing splendidly and the crop win
be above the average. Barley has a good color
ar.d the outlook is favorable for average yleias.
Hops, potatoes, onlcr.s. su^ar beets and gar
den* have made good progress during the week,
and but few complaints are made of dun&ge
be*ng done t>y vermin or ether pests.
Fruit continues dqting nicely: prunes and
r.ears are especially promising; apple* are
variable- in some localities the late varieties
ere reported pood and the early varieties poor,
while in other sections good crops are Indi
cated for both early and late varieties. A
few corrpFpondents report only half a crop or
both rarly and late apples, but Judging from
all reports it is believed the crop as a whole
w -ill fall but slightly below the average.

The Corn crops of 1000 and 1901 fell
far short of the demand. A great part
of the crop of 1902 was not up to con-
tract^ grade and could not therefore be
used in making up the great shortage
* of. 1900-01. The demand for [Corn
greatly exceeds the supply, aad
HIGHER PRICES ARE CERTAIN.
Natural conditions warrant much
- higher prices than present quotations,
and a marked advance Is now an as-
sured fact. The big elevator Interests
of Chicago have secured contrcl at the (
small amount of actual Corn In the
market, and are ii) a position to force
prices sky-high. -. This they will do,
we predict. In the very near future.

CALIFORNIA
TITLE INSURANCE AND TKUST COMPANY,
410 MONTGOMERY ST.
MOVED FROM MILLS BUILDING TO MORE
COMMODIOUS QUARTERS IN
HAYWARD -BUILDING.
THE OWNER OF PROPERTY insures his
house against loss by fire, and a failure to do
so would compromise his wisdom in the eyes
of all prudent business men.
SHOULD THE TITLE to his lot prove worth-
less, after his building was erected and he not
be insured by the California -Title Insurance
and Trust Company he would be exposed to the
loss of both land and buildings, a misfortune
much greater in scope than that arising from
THE ONLY SAN FRANCISCO TITLE IN-
SURANCE COMPANY, having a complete lo-
cality plant or copy of the real estate records,
constructed especially for injuring real estate
titles like modern plapts of New York. Boston,
Chicago and Eastern cities; reasonable rates;
regular trust company business transacted un-
der State charter; all matters controlled and
managed by the following

lOn? * nm"Â«3A> jral 6a3 Market Street, San Fnscaea.The Judge In granting thÂ© motion said.
after speaking of Greany's service as a
public officer: "I may be permitted to say
a few words touching the sense of per
sonal loss I feel In his death. I knew him
for many years. He was my friend. My
official relations with him were closely af
fected and largely Influenced by the thor
ough understanding which I had of his
personal character and worth. I trusted
him Implicitly, because I knew that In all
that he did the only Impulse that moved
him was a desire to do right for its own
eake." own
Judge Dunne returned from his vacation
yesterday morning, and when .court con
vened Attorney W. H. Alvord presented
a motion that when court adjourned it
would do so out of respect to the memory
of John T. Greany, who was the Assistant
District Attorney of the court for several
years prior to his death. In doing so At
torney Alford spoke In eulogistic terms of
the departed and said: "As a lawyer he
was able and loved his profession; as a
public officer he knelt at the shrine of
duty. From his struggles before the bar,
from the whirlpool of politics, he always
emerged with a conscience that was clear
and a name that was unsullied, even by
the breath of suspicion."
Attorney W. H. Alford Speaks in
JudgÂ© Dunne's Court of
Late Attorney.
PAYS TBIBTJTE TO MEMORY
OF LATE JOHN T. GREAITY
It ended In those men getting up in court
and telling those awful 6torles. It Is terrible.
I eball probably not pursue the matter any
further, although my lawyer tell* me I might
compel thÂ« Judge to hear our "tide of the
case.
The first time he signed I couldn't read his
name. # Then I asked him to sign again and
he did eo. He was evidently under the In
fluence of liquor and as a matter of fact he
Is never what you really call sober. Then I
brought suit" to com;*l him to pay after he
had repeatedly refused to do so.
I went to the drur store .o talk with him
and we went Into a little room that he uses
for an oftlc*. There was nothinr but a desk
and aome chairs In there. There was not a
word said about kissing or drinking. I never
drink. I finally persuaded Mm to give me a
note.
She says that M. Doolan of Oakland
never attained the eminence of touching
her. rich, ripe lips with his own, and that
Ehe never received a note of any kind
from him, either In the way of a billet
<loux or a financial statement. She wishes
It to be thoroughly understood that she
is not prodigal of her treasures. Her tale
of woe Is in part as follows:
I met Dr. Hicks about three years agt> and
ct course I did not know what kind cf a man
he wu. He haÂ« bich family connections I
havÂ« heard. Anyway, he came u> me last
November and wanted to borrow $100 from
rne. I do not think it a nice thins: for a Â«nan
to c*t rnon*y from a woman but I did not say
anything at the time. I loaned him the money.
When I asked him for It later he said he
wanted to buy a yacht end could rot epare
the $100. After a while I sÂ«nt him a re
minder and It fell Into his wife's hands. He
raid as lonp a* the knew about it he was not
going to pay me.
Miss Marian Green indignantly denies
that BhÂ© took a note for $125 from Dr.
"William P. Hicks In payment of a kiss.
EhÂ© further declares that she never be
stowed any osculatory favors whatever
upon the medical man, and that she
would not want to do so under any cir
cumstances. There is no onÂ© In the wide
world she would kiss, shÂ© says, except
"Mr. Risht."
Miss Green feels greatly grieved that
Justice of the PeacÂ« Lawton should have
thrown her case out of court. She thinks
he is not gallant, to say the least. And
those "awful men" who said that shÂ© per
mitted them to caress her In thÂ© back
room of the drug store on thÂ© corner of
Polk and McAllister streets are beneath
contempt, she thinks. It is true, she
admits, that 6hÂ© was there In company
with 5everal men, but on business only.
It has caused her the greatest embar
rassment, she asserts, to have had such
a s*cry made public, because her friends
all call her "Miss Prim" on account of
the reserve which she maintains when In
the presence of betrousered humanity. She
shrinks from the kiss of man as does the
night flower from that of the rising sun.
Miss Green's tempting lips curl In scorn
at the statement of Hicks and those oth
ers who were present on that memorable
occasion In the small room in the rear of
the drug store that caution-obliterating
liquids were passed around. "It Is a vile

LONDON. July IS.â The rabid anti-vlvi-
Bectlonists gain small comfort from the
oScial returns just published of experi
ments made on living animals during 1902.
The total number for England and Scot
land was H,906, being 3261 more than in
1901. - Â¦
Of these 12,776 were performed without
anaesthetics. These were mostly Inocula
tions and simple matters such as ab
straction of a small quantity of blood. No
experiment involving anything serious
was allowed to be made without the use
of, an .anaesthetic.
DUBLIN, July 18.â The Earl of
Dudley, Lord Lieutenant of Ire
land, and his beautiful and pop
ular Countess are now at their
new residence, Rocklngham,
County Roscommon.
-Ireland Is at this moment honored by
the presence of many of our legislators^
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, with
Sir Gilbert Parker and Horace Plunket,
is a guest of his Excellency at Rocking
ham. i
Lady Dudley had long Interviews with
Father McHugh and other priests over
the working of her scheme for providing
nurses for the sick poor In the remote
country districtsâ a scheme that has so
far met with generous support.
The party motored through that part of
Connemara where the terrible Joyce mur
ders were committed, perhaps the most
desolate part of his Majesty's dominions.
Lady Dudley also visited some of the
laccmaking depots and bought in Gal
way some ornaments in Connemara mar
ble.
Whitsuntide brought many distinguished
people to Ireland to spend the holiday
season. The Duke and Duchess of Dev
onshire are at Lismore Castle, their love
ly place In Waterford.
Lord and Lady Lansdowne, after a
short stay at Klllarney, are at Dereen,
their place on the coast of Kerry, while
Lord and Lady Londonderry are staying
Â¦with a large party of guests at Mount
Stewart. The ubiquitous tripper has not
been wanting, and from Portrush to Blar
ney the Saxon has been a welcome In
vader.
glass in Belgrade to supply the demand
and Vienna and Budapest were slow fill
ing orders.
The King ordered that the window
through which the bodies of Alexander
and Draga were flung shall be closed for
ever.
BELGRADE, July 18.â One .of the
first government acts of the new
King was to remove his name
from the list of persons billed to
be executed the moment they
are caught. He has been on the list since
186S, and had to be very careful not to
enter Servian territory. The King also
was pleased to restore to himself his real
estate confiscated by Milan, among other
parcels several Belgrade houses.
The King also remembered that his es
teemed father-in-law, the Prince of,Mon
tenegro, still owes him the million francs
he promised to give him when he married
his daughter, now dead.
Peter is not easily surprised by dyna
mite bombs. When driving he has a few
in a side pocket of the carriage, and half
a dozen or more are always on his writ
ing desk, disguised as match boxes, cigar
holders and the like. "If Alexander .had
two*or three of these things beside his
bed on the fatal night^he could have de
fied any number of conspirators," said the
King to the Mayor of Belgrade.
Whether Peter is a good bomb-thrower
remains to be seen. That he is an expert
shot and fighter with fists and feet he has
repeatedly proved. In fact he was made
king*of Swiss sharpshooters (schuetzen)
dozens of times. Boxing with the feet is
a specialty of his, which he learned In
France, where It Is called "savate." A
little while agp, while returning home
late to his apartment in Paris, he was
accosted by two footpads, who Invited
him to "shell out."
"Not much," said the Prince, and while
boxing one of the fellows 3 Into uncon
sciousness with his fists, he kicked the
other so severely that he has been a crip
ple and charge on the community ever
since.
Peter was disappointed to find the old
Konak still in a state of disorder. Three

usually produced by the Independent

in It. I've been In "The Doll's House' and
'The Wild Duck' myself. 'Ghosts' . the
censor doesn't permit." .
"Isn't he rather a nuisance?" '
"No, I think he's quite right," Abing
don. returned simply. "But Ibsen Is so
fascinating to the actor. He Is so easy
toplay. You know more actresses have
made reputations on Ibsen than through
any other modern playwright." .
"Have you done any of Bernard Shaw's
things?" '
"No." the actor replied. "There are only
occasional performances of his stuff.
They're " all very clever plays of their
kind, but the public does not want them.
'Arms and the Man' was a success, but
Shaw wrote it seriously, and the public
found It was funny. TheLShaw cult says
the plays fail because they are over the
heads of the public. Well â " and the
actor lifted doubtful eyebrows.
Then he told me that he had been with
Mrs. Campbell and Miss Nethersole, with
Martin Harvey In a play of Captain
Marshall's that just missed greatness.
"The Broad Road," with , this, that and'
another great English name. . He spoke
of- Denis O'SulIlvan, Stephen Phillipsâ
who used to be an actorâ of Davies, the

permit. Of Forbes Robertson and his

word, and all kinds of gossip from the
golden capital.
"I hope. I have said nothing discour
teous < about America," he .concluded,
looking down seriously at me,' as we rose
to go, "because I'm Jolly fond of it." Â¦
Then, smiling over his shoulder as we
left him: "The interview wasn't half
bad." - ": - '

"Oh, I see." It, may have been acting,
but Mr. Abingdon's expression was sim
plicity,: itself..; ' :
"Not quite so demonstrative as in Eng
land," â¢â¢ he replied, > "but they're Just as
quick to take a Jok'e." < ,,
"What!!!". Mr. Cahlll and I cried in uni
son. This was turning the tables with a
vengeance. ~ Â¦ Â¦.â¢â¢â¢â¢Â¦â¢Â¦
"Oh, yes, that part of it," Mr. Abingdon
confessed," but I don't like to carry my
own luggageâ the small traps, you know.
And If you ask -the porter about It, he
will tell you to 'get out of the way!' But
I have no necessities when I'm traveling.
I can do without anything, so everything
I get Is to the good." which strikes me
as a very useful philosophy.
"There, was rather a good one on me
the other day," he went on, "a compli
ment to my American accent. I went
into a cigar shop, got a cigar and asked
how much It was. 'Two-bits,' said the
man. 'What is that,' I askedâ it was
Greek tome. 'Oh, you dâ d New York
ers don't know anything!' he said!"
"But I have met with the greatest kind
ness since I came here," he resumed, still
bubbling with the enjoyment of his story.
"I see most of the American actors in
my little fiat In Londonâ next the Savoyâ
and they have treated me royally here.
Why they've made me a member of six
clubs In San Francisco."
"How do you find the audiences here?"
I asked.
"I think they're a vastly discourteous lot.
And they're the slowest things on earth.
They've got more time than all the rest
of America put together."
"They're not such shameless tippees as
the English waiters," I defend. >
"I think they are Just as much open to
tipsâ pardon meâ as the English waiter,"
the actor disagreed, "only here you don't
know if you've pleased him. There you
do. It's a cholca here of being thought
mean or a fool." - - ".
"And the porter?â at least v our baggage
system is best?"
was admiring the glorious, glorious
view." and the actor's dark, rosy face
beamed like a Golden Gate sunset. "The
English chap said nothing, and I thought
he was too deep in the poetry of the
thing to want to talk. But at last I
said: 'Isn't it magnificent?' He said:
'But it wants painting, don't you know!'
He was looking at the dirty white of the
Cliff House. It's all In the point of view."
"From yours, what la the most beauti
ful country you, have seen so far?"
"I give It up," Mr. Abingdon said. "At
the present moment I think It is the
drive from Monterey to Carmel Bay. But
there was Pike's Peak In Denver. â¢ Oh,
that lovely Garden of the Gods, and the
drive from Denver to Victorâ most mar
velous atmosphere and rugged, pictur
esque, majestic country. â¢ . â¢ â¢ By the
way, that little Victor is a staggering
sort of place. It is nine' years old, a min
ing town and has a perfectly appointed
little opera-house that is as comfortable
as you'll find anywhere. ', It was an eye
opener, I assure you."
Then he told me of meeting Robert
Courtneldge of the Manchester theaters
here and of their mutual surprise at find
ing San Francisco .' so lavishly equipped
with theaters.
"To me San Francisco Is much more
like Paris than any other city that I
have eecn," the actor decided, with an
approving pat for Paris on his knee. "It
is the climate, the gayety, the sunshine
and the well-dressed women that give
the impression, I suppose. By Jove! I've
never seen so many pretty girls in a
email space as I've seen here! They do
dress handsomely, too, don't they?"
I bowed for them.
"And how dainty they are about their
footgear!"

prompted: "But you don't like our wait

"Not wholly/' Mr. Ablngdoa owned."
"Then I had an Englishman with me
the other day. out at the Cliff House, I
<r Oh, we're just as proud of our coun
try over there as you are here, only"
âand the actor waved his busy hands In
judicial gestureâ "we don't care what
you think, and you do care what we
think. We're more spread-eagle than you
are, I think, but we're so gorgeously sure
we have the best of It. â¢ â¢ â¢ When I
got to New York an old gentleman asked
me how I liked the country. 'All but the
steam heat,* I replied. 'What" do you think
he said then, quite hotly? 'What about
your navy!' " .
I recognized the type and smiled, "Go
on."
Mr. Abingdon considered: "I think
what most surprised me was the similar-*
lty between Americans and English folk
of the same classâ always barring wait
ers, porters and Bobbles."
"Then our spread-eagleism did % not
offend?"
"Thank you," . I replied, recovering
speech. "And now, won't you, Mr. Eng
lishman, who are not a freak, please give
me some of those American Impressions
you have been so busily acquiring?"
"To begin Â»wlth?"
"Oh, anythingâ the oddest thing about
us."
In propria persona Abingdon queried:
"But how are you going to stand being off
the stage so long, D'Orsay?" "Oh, I
say!" D'Orsay replies.
More of this, and I who/had seen and
reveled in all of the new English actor
that was vouchsafed is here, forgot the
dignity of an interviewer and shrieked.
So did the artist, who hadn't.
"Oh, D'Orsay's the sweetest sort of fel
low." the actor said, sitting down In San
Francisco again. "Everybody is quite as
delighted at his success as he is. But
D'Orsay isn't English any more than
Sothern's Dundreary was English. He is
a delicious freak."

COMPETITION may. or may not
be the life of trade; It seems,
however, rather helpful In the
comic opera connection. The
musical comedy with which the
town Is now so well supplied has certain
ly set the Tivoll management a-thlnking.
Our little opera shop had things comic
operatic rather its own way for a length
of days. Mayhap) too long. Perhaps our
Tivoli was a little spoiled. Secure in Its
monopoly of light musical fare, the lo
cal purveyors perhaps became a little
careless, a little economical of effort and
expenditure, a little dangerously disdain
ful of the necessary novelty. But ttmes
changed. Burlesque and musical comedy
arrived on the scene. the3e to the unpar
ticular ear sufficiently resembling thÂ«
Tivoll menu to constitute a formidable
rivalry. Then came the Tlvoli'a first
move. Caro Rcma was engaged. The ex
cellent Gilbert & Sullivan revivals fol
lowed. Mascagnl then made history for
the old house with a triumphal season.
Zelle de Lussan added more luster. Ed
win Stevens gave another lift to things.
And now, ' to-morrow evening, CamMs
d'Arvill^ is to reappear.
The opera chosen for Miss d'Arville's
Tivoli debut had an unfortunate intro
duction here. It descended upon the Co
lumbia a season or two ago for Its sins.
Its perpetrators were a dull, dusty, fusty
set of folk, who seemed to have walked
from New Yorkâ they looked and sang as
if they had. poor things. Naturally. "The
Highwayman" did not succeed. However,
it had elsewhere in other hands attained
a respectable vogue, and its parentage-
Smith and De Kovenâ warrants a robust
hope at any rate, that what can be done
for the opera will surely be done for It
to-morrow night at the Tivoli.
A warm welcome awaits Miss d'Arville.
The fair Bostonian's marriage left an
aching void when It took her from the
stage. And Miss d'Arville will be sur
roundedâthe Tivoli people do more than
"support"â by an exceptionally strong
company. Stevens stays for the season,
and has a good part in the opera as Foxy
Quiller. a detective, who doesn't detect.

strongly by the way; Ferris Hart man, the
well known comedian: Edward Webb.

D'Orsay was welcoming Abingdon to
the Lamb's Club: "Dean boy," his imi
tator haw-hawed, "isn't this delightful,
bah Jove! Here you are In New York
"What D'Orsay!" and Mr. Abingdon's
face instantly held as broad a grin as it
is built for. Then he got up. reached
about for his bat, put it on with a lordly
tilt, pouted his chest and then solemnly
marched up to me with D'Orsay'g own
stiff, superb strut, D'Orsay's own mag
nificent "Haw!" on his lips. He had be
fore convinced me by his virile and sin
cere effort in "The Climbers" that he
could act, but this was precious. The
neat Abingdon suit of brown actually
seemed to melt into the incomparable
checks of D'Orsay, the upper lip to take
on the gorgeous D'Orsay mustache.
"And you're not," I wailed, my per
sonal grievance at once swamping the
international affair. "I hopedâ I, hopedâ
that I was going to find another "D'Orsay,
and you don't even say 'Bah Jove!' "
"They're putting up 'English spoken
here' on the others," the actor laugh
ingly contributed. "Oh, London is the
Mecca for the artist. We get everything
there In time. Even your American
Flare â in spite of the Anglo-mania craze.
Miss Bingham, Henrietta Crosman and
Margaret Anglinâ you eeem to have bo
many more good women players than

the actor flipped a scornful finger. "It Is

are responsible for the whole Illusion.
Do you believe in it? You're English
yourself."
*'It seems to me that the French own

"It is yojir first visit to America?"
"My first."

Recovering 1 from the blow a/i best I

"You are f 'pared this sort of thing in
England, MY. Abingdon?"
"Among other blessings," he returned
ambiguously. \
"You <ion - t Tke it?"
"Oh. ye?: about as well " and the

boyish smile, "about as well as a visit to

"Deal gently with the erring one." Mr.

"I have not yet consented to be inter
