One .of thÂ« directors was Colonel Pren

for young Mr. Brewster. . and Monty bad

brought va and , discussed, but Â¦ it was
left. for tlmÂ« to settle.
Since his grandfather's death he had
been staying at the gloomy old -Brewster
house in Fifth avenue, paying but two or
three hurried visits to the rooms at Mrs.
Gray's, wb<re he had made his home. Th*
gloom of death still darkened the Fifth
avenue place, and there, was "a stillness.
a gentle stealthlnesa about. the house that
made him long for more cheerful com
panionship. He wondered dimly if a for
tune always carried the suggestion of
tuberoses.- The richness and ' strangeness
of It all hung about him unpleasantly.
He had had no extravagant affection for
the grim old dictator who was dead, yet
his grandfather was a man and had com
rnandetf his respect. It seemetl brutal to
leave liim out of thÂ« reckoningâ to danoÂ»
on* the. grave of the mentor who had
treated him well. The attitude- of thÂ»
friends, who. clapped him on thÂ« back," of
the newspapers â¢which congratulated- him.
of - the crowd that expected.; him to . re
joice, repelled him. It seemed a tragio
comedy, haimted by a severe dead ;face.
He was* â¢ haunted/ too. by memories < and
by a jsharp . regret for his own foolish
thoughtlessness. Even the fortuneitself
weighe.4 upon him at moments with a
half-defined melancholy. â¢ . â¢ .
vTet^the situation. was not without ltÂ»
compensations. For wveral days when El
lis called him at 7 he would answer hint
and thank fortune that he was not required
at the bank that morning. The luxury of
another hour of sleep s.-pmed the greatest
perquisite of wealth. His morning mail
amused him at first, for since the news
papers had published his prosperity to thÂ«
."world hÂ« was deluged with" letters. Re
quests for public or private charity were
abundant, .but most of his correspondents
were ; generous and thought only of his
own Brood. For three days. he was in a
hopeless state of bewilderment. ; He was
visited .by reporters, photographers and
ingenious strangers who benevolently Â¦ of
feredâto .Invest his money in enterprises)
with certified futures. When he was not
engaged in declining- a gold mine In Colo

of a marvelous device for J300. or.de,nyln*
the report ' that he had been tendered the
presidency of the First National Bank.
\Oliver Harrison stirred him *out' early
one 'morning and. while the sleepy mil

dodging the bombshell that a dream an
archist bad hurled from the Binnacle : of
a bedpost urged him to excited, confi
dential tones to take time by the forelock
and prepare for possible breach of prom
ts* suits., Brewster sat on the edge of th*
bed and listened' to diabolical stories of
how conscienceless females had flesced In
nocent and ev*n godly men of wealth.
From the bathroom, between splashes, he
retained Harrison by the year, month,
day. and hour, to stand between him and
blackmail. HBBB8B9Â£lASI
Montfomtry Brewster no longer had
"prospects." People could cot now point
him out with the remark that som* day

had "realised." as OUver Harrison would
have put it. Two days after his grand
father's funeral a final will and testament
was read, and. as was expected., the old
banker atoned for the hardships Robert
Brewster and his wife bad endured by
bequeathing one million dollars to their
son Montgomery. It was his without a
restriction, without an admonition, with
out an Incumbrance. There was - not a
suggestion as to how It should be handled
by the heir. The business training th*
old man had given him was synonymous
with conditions not expressed in the will.
The dead man believed that he had drilled
Into the youth an unmistakable concep

If bÂ» failed in these expectations thÂ« mis

"You'll be bored to death by the raft of
people who have ways to spend your
money," continued the colonel. "Don't
listen to any of them. Take your time.
You'll have a new chance to make money
every day of your life, so go slowly. I'd
have been rich years and years ago If
I'd had sense enough to run away from
promoters. They'll all try to get a whack
at your money. Keep s your eye open,
Monty. The rich young man is always a
tempting- morsel." And after a moment's
reflection he added. "Won't you come out
and dine with us to-morrow night?"
though not In his presence. But the ex
istence of iuiEs Barbara Drew may have
had something to do with the feeling be
tween the two men.
"Who Is your Uncle James?" she asked.
"I've never heard of him."
Â¦ " You , must Â¦ go ' to Grant & Rlpley at
once, of course." . Â¦ Â¦ - . - .,' .
"Have you- forgotten, -Peggy,", he re
plied, with a bint of vexation in his
voice, "that we are to read 'Oliver Optic'
this afternoon?".
A SECOND WILJ* ; ;
"You are both : fortunate and. unfor
tunate, Mr. Brewster," said Mr. Grant,
after the young man had dropped into a
chair In, the oiiicejOf Grant & RIpJey the
next day. Montgomery wore a slightly
bored expression, and it was evident that
he took. little interest in the will of James
T. SedKwick. From far back, in the re
ceases of memory he now recalled this
long loot brother of his mother. As a
very small child he had seen his Uncle
James upon the few occasions which
brought him to the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Brewster. But the young man
had dined at Drew's the night before and
Rarbara had had more charm for him
than usual. It was of h*r that ha was
puzzled. "But why do you say that I am
both fortunate and unfortunate?" Â¦
"The situation is eo remarkable that
you'll consider that a mild way of patting
it w"hen you've heard everything. I think
you were told, in our not* of yesterday,
that you are the sole h*ir. Weil, It may
surprise you to learn that James Sedg
v.ick died possessed of an estate valued at
almost seven- million dollar*."
Montgomery Brewster sat like one pet
rifled, staring, blankly at the old lawyer,
who could say startling things Jn a level
voice. â¢ '*' â¢ ;

cried, a soft light in her eyes.
"I'm going up there this afternoon to

ly. "And, Peggy, you must come. too.
Maybe I can find one of those Optic books,

had to be at the bank at 12:30 to let Mr.
Perkins go out for something to eat? The
millionaire habit isn't so firmly fixed as I
supposed." After a moment's pause, in
which his growing seriousness changed
the atmosphere, he went on. haltingly,
uncertain of his position: "The nicest
thing about having all this money is that
âthatâ we won't have to deny ourselves
anything after this." It did not sound
very tactful, now that It was out. and he
"Don't ? talk like that, Peggy," he Im
plored. â¢ . ' ' * . ' "
"It would break her heart If you offered

"I thought youâ that youâ oh, this

back and forth again, .and then stood be

pitiful smile, but still a smile! There were
tears in her eyes as she looked at him.

his forehead. He was beginning to com

"In more ways than one. V'hat are you

"Do about It?" In surprise. âWhy. It's
mine, isn't it?"
"It is not yours until next September,"
the lawyer quietly said. .
"Well. I fancy I can waiti" said Brew
ster with a smile that cleared the air.
No, Mr. Brewster ; v it Is absolutely gen
uine. Here is a telegram from the Pro
bate Court in Sedgwick's home county
received In response to a query from us
It says that the will is to be filed for pro^
bate and that Mr. Sedgwick was many
times a millionaire. This statement,
which he calls an inventory, enumerates
his holdings and . their \ alue, and the
footing shows $6,343,000 in round numbers.
The Investments, you see, are gilt-edged.
There is not a bad penny in all those
millions.!' - Â¦
The latter took the paper and glanced
over It with the air of one who had heard
but had not fully grasped Its meaning
"It must be a Joke. Mr. Grant." he
paid, still groping with difficulty through
the fog.
"I believe I'd like to have you read this
cxtraorâ the will. Mr. Grant." he said,
with an effort to hold his nerves In leash.
Mr. Grant cleared his throat and began
in his still voice. Once he looked up to
find his listener eager, and again to find
him grown indifferent. He wondered
dimly if this were a pose.
In brief, the last will of James T. Sedg
wick bequeathed everything, real and
personal, of which he died possessed, to
his only nephew, Montgomery Brewster
of New York, son of Robert and Louise
Sedgwick Brewster. Supplementing this
all-important clause there was a set of
conditions governing the final disposition
of the estate. The most extraordinary of
these conditions was the one which re
quired the heir to be absolutely penniless
Â¦upon the twenty-sixth anniversary of his
birth, September 23.
The instrument went into detail in re
spect to this supreme condition. It set
forth that Montgomery Brewster was to
have no other worldly possession than
the clothes which covered him on the
September, day named. He was to begin
that day- without a penny to his name,
without a single article of Jewelry, fur
niture or finance that he could call his
own or could thereafter reclaim. At nine
o'clock, New York time, on the morning
of September 23. the executor, under the
provisions of the will, was to make over
and transfer to Montgomery Brewster all
of the moneys, land?, bonds, and inter
ests mentioned in the inventory which ac
companied the will. In the event that
Montgomery Brewster had not. in every
particular, complied with the require
ments of the will, to the full satisfaction
of the said executor. Swearengan Jones,
the estate was to be distributed among
certain Institutions of charity designated
In the instrument. Underlying this im
perative injunction of Jarr.cs Sedgwick
was plainly discernible the motive thar
prompted it. In almost so many, words
he declared .that his heir should' cot re
ceive- the fortune if he possessed a single
penny that had come to him. in any
-shape or form, from the man he hated.
Edwin Peter Brewster. While Sedgwick
could not have known at the time of his
death that the banker had bequeathed
one million dollars to his grandson; it was
more than apparent that he expected the
young man to be enriched liberally by his
enemy. It was to preclude any possible
chance of the mingling of his fortune
with the smallest portion of Edwin P.
Brewster's that James Sedgwick, on his
deathbed, put his hand to this astonish
ing Instrument.
There was also a clause in which he
undertook to dictate the conduct of
Montgomery Brewster during the year
leading up to his twenty-sixth anniver
sary. He required that the young man
should give satisfactory evidence to tile
execut/or that he was capable of manag
ing- his affairs shrewdly and wiselyâ that
he possessed the ability to add to the for
tune through his own enterprise; that he
should come to this twenty-sixth anniver
sary with a fair name and a record free
from anything worse than mild forms of
dissipation; that his habits be temperate;
that he possess nothing at the end of the
year, which might be regarded as a "vl3-'
lble or invisible asset"; that he make no
endowments; that he give sparingly to
charity; that he neither loan nor give
away money, for fear that it might ba re
stored to him later; that he live on the
principle which inspires a man to "get Els
money's worth." be the. expenditure great
or small. As these conditions, were pre
Â« ribed for but a single year In the life
of the heir, it was evident that Mr. Sedg
wick did not Intend to impose any restric
tions after the property had gone into his
hands.
"How do you like It?" asked Mr. Grant.
as he passed the will to Brewster.
Jones, the executor, explains â¢"* mys
tery that may be suggested by Its terms.
While Sedgwick's whereabouts was un
known to his old -friends in New York.
It seems that he was -.fully posted on all
that was going on here. He knew that
you were the only child of your_mother
and therefore his only nephew. He sets
forth the. dates of your, mother's mar
riage, of your birth, of the death of KoD
ert Brewster and- of Mrs. Brewster. He
also was aware of the faet that old Ed
win Peter Brewster intended to bequeath
a larfÂ« fortune to you-and thereby
hangi Â»>tale. Sedgwick was proud.
WhmhtUTtd In New York he was re
garded aa the kind of man who never for
gave the person who touched roughly
upon his pride. You know, of course, that
your father married Miss Sedgwick in
th* face of the most bitter opposition on
the part of Edwin Brewster. The latter
refused to recognize her as his daugh
ter, practically disowned his son. and
heaped the harshest kind of calumny
upon the Sedgwicks. It was commonly
believed about town that Jim Sedgwick
left the country three or four years after
his marriage for the sole reason that
he and Edwin Brewster could not live ra
the same place. Bo deep was. his hatred
of the old man that he fled to escape
killing him.. It was known that upon one
occasion he visited the office of his
sister's enemy, for the purpose of slaying
him, but something prevented. He car
ried that hatred to the grave, as you. will
see."
Montgomery Brewster was trying to
Rather himself together from within the
fog which made himself and the world
unreal.

"That Is your plan, then?"
"Of course. First. I shall substantiate
all that this will sets forth. When I am
assured that there can be no possibility
of mistake in the extent of this fortune
and my undisputed claim. I'll take steps
to get rid of my grandfather's million in
short order." Brewster's voice rang true
cow. The rest of life was comine back.
Mr. Grant leaned forward slowly and his
intent, penetrating gaze served, as a check
to thÂ«* young fellow's enthusiasm. .
"I admire and approve the sagacity
' which urges you to exchange a paltry mil
lion for a fortune, but It seems to me that
you are forgetting the conditions," he
said. pIottIv. "Has It occurred to you that
It Â»ill be no easy task to spend $1,000,000
without in some way violating the re
strictions in your uncle's will, thereby
losing uoia fortunes?"
V.
THE MESSAGE FROM JONES.
A new point of view gradually came to
Brewster. AH his life had been spent in
wondering how to get enough money to
pay his bills, and it had not occurred to
him that It might be as difficult to spend
as to acauire wealth. The thought stag
gered him for a moment. Then he cried
triumphantly, "I can decline to accept
grand father's million."
"You cannot decline to accept what is
already yours. I understand that ' the
money has been paid to you by Mr. Bus-
Wrk. You have Jl .000.00}, Mr. Brewster,
and It cannot be denied."
"You are right." agreed Montgomery,
dejectedly. "Really. Mr. Grant, this prop
osition is too much for me. If you aren't
required to give an Immediate answer, I
want to think It over. It sounds like a
dream."
"It is no dream. Mr. Brewster." smiled
the lawyer. "You are face to face with
an amazing reality. Come In to-morrow
morning and see me again. Think it over.
rtudy it out. Remember the conditions of
the will and the conditions that confront
you. In the meantime, I shall write to
Mr. Jones, the executor, and learn from
him just what he expects you to do in
order to carry out his own conception of
the terms of your uncle's will."
"Don't write, Mr. Grant; telegraph. And
ask him to wire his reply. A year Is not
very ?sng In an'affalr of-thls kind." A
moment later he added. "Damn these fam
ily feuds ! Whv couldn't Uncle James
have relented a bit? He brings endless
I trouble on my Innocent head. Just because
of a row before I was born."
"He was a strarpe man. As a rule, one
does not carry grudges quite so far. But
that ie neither here nor there. His will is
law in this case."
"Suppose I succeed in Fpending all but
WW before the 23d of next September!
I'd lose the 6even millions and be the next
thing to a pauper. That wouldn't be quite
like retting my money's worth."
"It is a problem, my boy. Think it over
very seriously before you come to a deci
sion, one way or the other. â¢ In the mean
time, we can establish beyond a doubt the
accuracy of this Inventory."
"By ail means, go ohe: d, and please
urge Mr. Jones not to be too hard on me.
I believe Til risk It If the ./restrictions are
not too severe. But If Jone- has puritani
cal instincts. might as well give up
hop* and be satisfied with what I have."
"Mr. Jones is very far from what you'd
call puritanical, btt he Is Intensely prac
tical and clear-headed. He will undoubt
edly require you to keep an expense ac
count and to show some sort of receipt
for every dollar you disburse."
"Good Lord! Itemize?" I '
"In a general way. I presume."
"I'll have to employ an army of spend
thrifts to devise ways and meanr for pro
fUpacy.**
"You forget the Item which restrains
you from taking anybody into your confi
dence concerning this matter. Think it
over. It may not be so difficult after a
night's sleep."
"If it isn't too difficult to get the night's
Bleep."
All the rest of the day Brewster wan
dered about as one In a dream. He was
preoccupied and puzzled, and more than
one of his old associates, receiving a dis
tant nod In passing, resentfully conclud
ed that his wealth was beginning to
change him. His brain was so full of sta
tistics, figures and computations that It
whirled dizzily, and once he narrowly es
caped being run down by a cable car. He
dined alone at a small French restaurant
In one of the side streets. The waiter
marveled at the amount of black coffee
the young man consumed and looked hurt
when be did not touch the quail and let
tuce.
That night the little table In his room
at Mrs. Gray's was littered with scraps of
pad paper, each covered with an Incom
prehensible maze of figures. After din
ner hÂ» had gone to his own rooms, forget
ting that he lived on Fifth avenue. Un
til long after midnight he smoked and
calculated and dreamed. For the first
time the immensity of that million thrust
Itself upon him. If on that very day, Oc
tober the first, he were to begin the task
of spending It. he would have but 357 days
In which to accomplish the end. Taking
the round sum of $1,000,000 as a basis, it
was an ea*y matter to calculate his p.ver
age dally disbursement. The situation did
not look so utterly, impossible until he
held up the little sheet of paper and rue
fully contemplated the result of that film
plo problem In mathematics.
It meant an average dally expenditure
ef $2801.12 for nearly a year, and even then
there would be 16 cents left over, for. In
proving the result of. his rough sum In
division, he could account for but $:<#,
899.S4. Then it occurred to him that his
money would be drawing Interest at the
bank.
"But for each day's $2801.12. I am get
ting seven times as much," he solilo
quized, as be finally got into bed. "That
means J19.607.M a day, a clear profit of
316.fiO6.T2. That's pretty goodâ yes, too
good. I wonder if the bank couldn't
oblige me by not charging interest."
The figures kept adding and subtracting
themselves as be dozed off, and once dur
ing the night .he dreamed that Swear
engen Jones had sentenced him to eat a
million dollars' worth of game and salad
at the French restaurant. He awoke with
the consciousness that he had cried
aloud. "I can do it, but a year is not very
loner in an affair of this kind." -
It was 9 o'clock when Frewster finally
ro;=e, and after his tub he felt ready to
cope with any problem, even a substantial
breakfast A message had come to him
from Mr. Grant of Grant & Ripley, an
nouncing the receipt of Important dis
patches from Montana. &nd asking him
to luncheon at I. He had time to spare,
and as Margaret and Mrs. Gray had gone
out, he telephoned Kills to take his horse
to the entranca to the park at once. The
crisp autumn air was perfect for his ride,
and Brewster found a number of smart
people alreadv riding and driving in the
park. His horse was, keen for a canter
and be had reached the obelisk before he
drew rein. As he was about to cross the
carriage road he was nearly run down by
Miss Drew In her new French automobile.
"I beg your pardon," she cried. "You're
the third person I've run Into, so you see
I'm not discriminating against you."
"I should be flattered even to be run
down by you."
"Very well, then, look out." And she
started the machine as if to charge him.
She stopped in time, and said with a
laugh, "Your gallantry deserves a re
ward. Wouldn't you rather send your
horse home and come for a ride with
me?"
"My man Is waiting at .. Fifty-ninth
street. If you'll come that far, I'll go
with pleasure." '
Monty had merely a society; acquaint
ance with Miss Drew. He had met her
at dinners and dances, au he had a hos,t
of other girls/ but she had Impressed him
more than the others. Something inde
scribable took place every time their
eyes met. Monty had often wondered
Just what that something meant, but he
had always realized that it had in it noth
ing of platonlc affection.
"If I didn't have to meet her eyes," ho
had said to himself, "I could go on dis
cussing even politics with her, but the
moment she looks at me I know she can
see what I'm thinking about." From the
first they considered themselves very
good friends and after their third meet-
Ing it seemed perfectly natural that they
should call one another by their first
names. Monty knew he was treading on
dangerous ground. It never incurred to
him to wonder what Barbara might think
of him. He took it as a matter of course
that she must feel more than friendly
toward him. As they rode through the
maze of carriages, they bowed frequently
to friends as they passed. They were
conscious that some of the women, notice
ably old Miss Dexter, actually turned
around and gazed at them.
"Aren't you afraid people will talk
about us?" asked Monty with a laugh.
"Talk about our riding together in tho
park? It's Just as safe here as It would
be in Fifth avenue. Besides, who cares?.
I fancy we can stand It."
"You're a thoroughbred, Baibara. I
simply didn't want you talked about.
When I go too far, say the word and
drop me." \
"I have a luncheon at two, but until
then we have our ride."
Monty gasped and looked at his watch.
"Five minutes to one," he cri*d. The
matter of his engagement with the attor
ney had quite escaped him. In the exhil
aration of Miss Drew's companionship he
had forgotten even" Uncle James' Â¦millions;
"I've got a date at one that means life
and death to me. Would you mind taking
me down to the nearest Elevatedâ orâ
here, let me run -It."
Almost before Barbara was aware of
what was happening they had changed'
places . and . the .machine, under Monty's
guidance, was tearing over the ground.
"Of all the casual people," *ald trfe
frfrl. by no means unequal to the excite
ment, "I believe you're kidnaping me."
But when she saw the grim look on
Monty's face and one pollcemnn after
another warned him she became seriously
alarmed. "Monty Brewster, this pace is
positively dangerous."
"Perhaps it Is." he responded, "but if
they haven't sense enough to keep x out
of the way, they shouldn't kick if they
get run over."
"I don't mean the people or the auto
mobiles or traps or trees or monuments;
Monty; I mean you and me.. 1. know
we'll either be killed or arrested."
"This Isn't anything to the gait. I'll be
going if everything turns out as I ex
pect. Don't be worried, Babs. Besides
it's one now. Lord, I didn't dream It
was so late."
"Is your appointment so important?"
she asked, hanging on.
"Well, I should Bay It is, andâ look out
âyou blooming idiot! Do you want to
get killed V The last remark was hurled
back at an Indignant pedestrian who had
escaped destruction by the merest chance.
"Here we are." he said, as they drew
up beside the entrance to the Elevated.
"Thanks awfullyâ you're a corkerâ sorry
to leave you this way. I'll tell you all
about it later. You're a dear to help me
keep my appointment."
"Seems to me you helped yourself."
she cried after him as he darted up the
steps. "Come up for tea some day and
tell me who the lady is."
After he had gone Miss Drew turned to
her chauffeur who was in the tonneau.
Then she laughed unrestrainedly, and the
faintest shadow of a grin stole over the
man's fa.ee.
"Beg pardon, Miss," he said, "but I'd
back Mr. Brewster against Fournier any
day."
Only half an hour late, Brewster en
tered the office of Messrs. Grant and Rip
ley, flushed, eager, and unconscious of
the b^g splotch of mud that decorated his
cheek.
"Awfully sorry to have kept you wait
ing." he apologized.
"Sherlock Holmes would say that you
had been driving, Mr. Brewst*>r," said
Mr. Ripley, shaking the young man's
hand. . .
"Ho would miss it, Mr. Ripley. I've'
been flying. What have you hoard from
Montana?" He could no longer check
the impatient question, which came out
so suddenly that the attorneys laughed
Irresistibly, Brewster Joining them an in
stant later. They laid before him a half
dozen telegrams i responses from bankers,
lawyers and mine operators In Montana. \
These messages.establlshed beyond doubt
the extent of James T. Sedgwick's wealth;
it was reported to be even greater than
shown by the actual figures.
"And what does Mr. Jones say?" de
manded Montgomery.
"His reply resembles a press dispatch.
He has tried to make himself thoroughly
clear, and if there is anything left unsaid
it is past our comprehension. I am sorry
to Inform j'QU, though, that he has paid
the telegraph charges," said Mr. Grant,
smiling broadly.
"Is he rational about it?" asked Mont
gomery, nervously. N
Mr. Grant gave his partner a quick,
significant glance and then drew from his
desk the voluminous telegram from
Swearengen Jones. It was as follows:
' October 3.-

want him to work under: 1. No reckless

any character, because their memory would be
an invisible asset. 4. No Indiscriminate , giv

lieve charity should be spoiled by Indulgence.
It' la not easy to spend a million, and I won't
be unreasonable with him. Let him epend it
freely, but not foolishly, and get his money's
worth out of It. If. he does that I'll consider
him a good business man. I regard it foolish
to tip waiter more than dollar and car porter
does not deserve over five. He does not earn
more than one. If heir wants %r> -try for this

"Write more fully!" echoed Montgom
ery. Â¦ "What can there be left to write
about?"
"He is explicit," said the attorney, â¢'but
it is best to know all-the conditions before
you decide. , Have you made up your
mind?".
Brewster sat silent for a long' time,
staring hard at the floor. . A great strug

"It's a gamble, and a big one," he said
at last, squaring his shoulders, "but ,i'H
take it. I don't want to appear disloyal
to my grandfather, but I think that even
he would advise me to accept. Yes, you
may write Mr. Jones that I accept the
chance." . â¢'
The attorney complimented him on his
nerve and wished him success. Brewster
turned with a smile. > Â¦ : '

MONTY CRISTO.
A fortnight later Montgomery -Brewster
had a new home. In strict obedience to
his chief's command, "Nopper'.' Harrison
had leased until the Septemberyfollowing
one of the most expensive apartments to
be found in- New York City. The renta!
was $23,000, and the shrewd financial rep
resentative had saved $1000 for his em
ployer by paying the sum In advance. But
when he. reported this bit of economy to
Mr. Brewster he was surprised vthat It
brought forth a frown. "I never, saw a
man who had less sense about money,"
muttered "Nopper" to himself. "Why, he
spends it like .a Chicago millionaire trying
to get into New York society.' If it were
not for the rest of us he'd be a pauper in'
six months." â¢ C
Paul Pettlngill, to his own Intense sur
prise and, it must be said, consternation,
was engaged to redecorate certain- rooms
according to a plan suggested by the ten
ant. The rising young artist, in a great
flurry of pxeitement, agreed to do the
work for $500. and then blushed like a
.schoolgirl when he was. informed by the
practical Brewster that the paints and
material for one room alone would cost
twice as much.
Â¦ "Petty, you have no more idea of busi
ness than a goat," criticized Montgomery,
and Paul lowered his head in humble con
fession. "That man who calcimines your
Â¦â¢etudlo could figure on a piece of work
with more Intelligence than you reveal.
I'll pay $2500. It's only a fair price, and I
can't afford anything cheap in this place."
"At this rate you won't be able. to af
ford anything," said Pettlngill to himself.
And so it was that Pettinglll and a
corps of decorators soon turned the rooms
Into a confusion of scaffoldings and paint
buckets, out of which in the end emerged
something very distinguished. No one had
ever thought Pettinglll deficient in ideas,
and this was his opportunity. The only
drawback was the time limit which Brew
ster so remorselessly fixed. Without that
he felt that he could have done some
thing splendid in the way of decorating
panelsâ something that would make even
the glory of Puvls de Chavannes turn pal
lid. With it he was obliged to curb hia
.turbulent ideas, and he deci/led that a
rich simplicity "was the proper' note." The
result was gorgeous, but not too gorgeous
âIt had depth and distinction.
Elated and eager, he assisted Brewster
in selecting furniture and hangings for
each room, but he did not know that his
employer was making conditional pur
chases of everything. Mr. Brewster had
agreements with all the dealers to the ef
fect that they were to buy everything
back at a fair price. If he desired to give
up the establishment within a year. He
adhered to this rule in all cases that
called for the purchase outright of sub
stantial necessities. The bump of calcu
latlveness in Monty Brewster's head was
growing to abnoral proportions.
In retaining ! his rooms at Mrs. Gray's
he gave the flimsy but â¢ pathetic - excuse
that he wanted a place in which he might
find occasional seasons of peace and
quiet : When Mrs. Gray protested against
this useless bit of extravagance his grief
was so obviously genuine that her heart
was touched and there was a deep, fer
vent Joy In her soul. She loved this fair
faced boy, and tears of happiness came to
her eyes when she was given this new
proof of his loyalty and devotion. His
rooms were kept for him Just as If he
had expected to occupy them every day
and every night, notwithstanding the
luxurious apartments he was to' maintain
elsewhere. The Oliver Optic books still
lay In the attic, all tattered and torn, but
to Margaret the embodiment of prospec
tive riches, promises of sweet hours to
come. She knew Monty well enough to
feel that he would not forget the dark lit- ,
tie attic of old for all the sÂ«plendors that
might come with the new dispensation.
There was no little surprise when he'
sent out invitations for a large dinner.
His grandfather had been dead less than .
a month, and society was somewhat scan
dalized by the plain symptoms of disre
spect he was showing. No' one had ex
pected him to observe a prolonged season,
of mourning. . but that ho should ' disre
gard the formalities completely was
rather shocking. Some of the older peo
ple, who had not long to live and who
had heirs-apparent, openly denounced his
heartlessness. It was not very gratifying
to think' of what 'might be in store for'
them if all memories were as short as -
r
Brewster's. Old Mrs. Ketchell changed
her wlll^and two nephews 'were cut off
entirely; a very modest and Impecunious
grandson of Joseph Oarrlty also was to
sustain a severe change In fortune in the
near future, if the cards spoke correct
ly.' Judge Van Woort, who was not ex
pected to live through the night, 1 got bet
ter immediately after . hearing some one
in the sick room whisper 'that Montgom
ery Brewster was to give a big dinner.
Naturally, the helrs-to-be condemned
young Brewster In no uncertain. terms. â¢
Nevertheless, the dinner to be given. by
the grandson of old Edwin | Peter Brew
ster was the talk of the town, and not
one of the sixty invited guests .could have
been persuaded to miss It. Reports; as to
its magnificence were abroad* ldng before,
the night set for the dinner. One of 'them
had it that It was â¢ to cost,- $3000 a plate.
From:that figure the legendary price" re

thoughtfully â¢ and religiously calculated
bis expenses for the day. "Nopper" Har- .
rlson and Elon Gardner had the receipts
for all moneys spent, and Joe Bragdon
was, keeping an official report, but the
"chief," as they called him. .could not go
to sleep until he was satisfied in his own;
mind that he was keeping up the average.
For the first two weeks it had been easyâ j
in fact, he seemed to have quite a com
fortable lead in the race. He had spent
almost $100,000 j In the fortnight, but he
realized that the greater part of It had
gone Into the yearly and not the dally
expense account. He kept a "profit and
loss" entry In his little private ledger, but
it was not like any other account of the
kind in the world. What the ordinary
merchant would have charged to "loss"
he jbtted~"down on the "profit", side and
he was continually looking for opoprtunl
tles to swell the total:
Rawles, who had been his grand
father's * butler* since the day after he
landed ' In New York, came over to the
grandson's establishment, greatly to the
wrath .and. confusion of the latter' s Aunt.
Emmeline. The chef came from Paris
and his, name was Detult. Ellis, the foot
man, also. found a much better berth with
Monty than he had had In the house on
the avenue. Aunt Emmeline never for
gave her nephew for these base and dis
turbing acts of treachery, as she called
them. â¢ \
One of Monty's* most extraordinary fin
ancial feats grew out of the purchase
of a $14,000 automobile. He blandly ad
mitted to "Nopper" Harrison and the
two secretaries that he Intended to use
it to practice with only, and that as soon
as he learned how to run an "auto" as
it. should be run he .expected to buy a
good, sensible, durable machine for $7000.
His staff officers frequently put their
heads together to devise ways and means
of curbing Monty's reckless extravagance.
They were worried. , â¢ â¢ Â» â >
"He's like: a ; sailor in port," protested
Harrison. "Money Is no object . if ;he :
wants a thing, andâ damn Itâ he seems to
want- everything^ he sees." /Â¦ %
"It won't last long," - Gardner said, re
assuringly^ "Like bis namesake, Monte
Cristo, the world is his just now and he
wants to enjoy It." ' ' .' "
"He wants to get -rid of it, it seems to
me." ' . , .
Whenever they reproached Brewster
about the matter he disarmed them by
saying:, "Now that I've got money I mean
to give my friends \ a good time. Just
what you'd do If you' were In my. placer.
flTiat's the money for, anyway?^' *
"But this $3000-a-plate dinner "
"I'm going to give a dozen of them, and
even then I can't pay my Just debts. For
years I've been entertained at people's
houses and have been taken cruising on
their yachts. They have always been
bully to me and what have -I ever done,:
for them? Nothing. Now that I can af
ford it, I am going to return* some of,
those favors and square myself. Doesn't
it sound reasonable?" k ... â¢'
And eo preparations for Monty's dinner
went on. In addition to what he called
his "efficient corps of gentlemanly aids"
he had secured the services of Mrs. Dan
DeMille as "social mentor and utility
chaperon." Mrs. DeMille was known in
the papers as the leader of the fast
younger married set. She was one of the
cleverest and best looking young women
in town and her husband was. of thoso
who "did not' have to be "invited too."
Mr. DeMille lived at the club and visited
his home.' Some one said that hewas so
slow.and.hls.wife .so_ f ast_that. when. she _
Invited him to dinner lie was usually two
or three days late. Altogether Mrs. De-
Mille was a decided acquisition to Brews
ter's campaign committee. It, required
just her touch to make his parties fun Â¦ '
instead of funny. <
It was on October IS that the dinner
was given. With the skill of a general
Mrs. Dan had seated the guests Â¦ In -such Â¦
a way that from the beginning things
went off with zest. Colonel Drew took In
Mrs. Valentine and his content was as- '
sured; Mr. Van Winkle and the beautiful
Miss Valentine were side by side and no 0
one could say he looked unhappy; Mr.
Cromwell went in with Mrs. Savage; and*
the same delicate tactâ in some cases it
was almost indelicateâ was displayed in
the disposition of other guests. ' , , .
Somehow they had come with the ex
pectation of being bored. Curiosity '
prompted them to accept,, but it did not .
prevent the subsequent .Inevitable lassi- '
tude. Socially Monty Brewster -had yet
to make himself felt. He and his dinners Â¦
were something to talk about, but they I
were accepted hesitatingly, Â¦ t haltingly. ;'
People wondered how he had secured the )
co-operation of Mrs. j Dan, but then Mrs.
Dan always did go In for u new toy. . To <
her was inevitably attributed whatever '
success the dinner achieved. And It was <
no small measure. Yet there was noth- "
ing startling about the affair. Monty .i
had decided to begin conservatively. He <
did the conventional thing, but he did it '
well. He added a touch' or two of lux- â¢
ury, the faintest aroma of splendor. Pet
tlngill had designed the curiously way- ' 'Â¦
ward table, with its comfortable atmos- |i
phere of companionship, and arranged Us i
decoration. of great lavender orchids and i
lacy butterfly festoons of white ones
touched with yellow. .He had wanted to â¢ i
use dahlias in their many rich shades *
from pale yellow to orange and deep red, ' !
but Monty held out for orchids. It was /
the artist, too,' who had found in a rare
and happy moment the massive gold' can- 1
delabraâ ancient things of a* more luxQ- i
rlous ageâ and their opalescent shades. :
Against his advice the service, * too, was i
of goldâ "rank vulgarity," he .called it, i
with Its rich meaningless ornamentation. <
But here Monty was obdurate.' He insist- ' <
ed that he. liked the. colorand. that ; porr..,i
celaln had no character. Mrs. Dan only
prevented a quarrel by suggesting that
several courses be served upon Sevres.
PettlnglU's scheme for lighting the room
was particularly, happy. For the benefit
of his walls and the four lovely Monets
which Monty had purchased at his insti
gation, he had. designed a celling screen
of ' heavy rich . glass - In tones of white
that grew into yellow and dull
green. It served to conceal the lights In
the "daytime, and at night the glare of
electricity was Immensely softened and
made harmonious by * passing through It.
It gave a note, of quiet to the picture,
which caused even these men and women,
who had beÂ«n here and there and seen
many ~ things, Â¦ to draw In their breath
sharply..' Altogether, the effect manifest
ly made, an Impression. Â¦
.Such "an environment had Its Influence
upon the company.. It went far toward
making the dinner a success. From far In
the distance came the softened strains of
Â¦ Hungarian music, and never had the little
â band i played the "Valse Amoureuse" and
the'"Yalse Bleue" with the spirit it put
â Jjifo-them that night. Yet the soft clamor
In the '^dining-room Insistently Ignored the
emotion or the music. Monty, bored as
he 'was between the two most Important
dowagers at the feast, wondered iifmly
what -invisible part it played in making
things go. He had a vagrant fancy that
without It there would have been no zest
for. talk, no nolsv competition ' to over
come, no hurdles to leap. As It was. the
L^talk certainly went well, and Mrs. Dan
Inspected- the result of her work from
time to 4 time with' smiling satisfaction.
From across the table she heard Colonel
Drew's voiceâ "Brewster evidently objects
to a long siege. He Is planning to carry
us. by assault."
Mrs. Dan turned to "Subway" Smith,
who â¢ was* at . her rightâ the latest addi
tion to her menagerie. "What Is this
friend, of yours J" she asked. "I have
never seen such complex simplicity. This
new plaything has no -real charm for him.
He is breaklng.lt to -find out what It Is
made of. And something â¢ will happen
when he discovers- the sawdust."
"Oh, don't worry about him." said "Sub
way." easily; "iuonty's at least a good
sportsman. He won't complain, whatever
happens. He'll accept the reckoning and
pay the piper." '.
It was only toward the end of the even
ing that Monty found his reward in a mo
ment with Barbara Drew. He stood be
fore her, squaring; his shoulders belliger
ently . to keep away -intruders, and she
smiled up at him In that bewildering fash
ion of hera. But It was only for an In
stant, and then came a terrifying din from
the dining-room, "followed by the clamor
of crashing glass. The guests tried for
a moment to be courteously oblivious, but
the noise was so startling that such po
liteness became farcical. The host, with a
little laugh, went down. the hall. It was
the beautiful screen n#ar the ceiling that
had fallen. A' thousand pieces of shat
tered glass covered .the place. . The table
was a sickening heap of crushed orchids
and 'sputtering candles. Frightened ser
vants rushed Into the room from one side
just as Brewster entered from the other.
Stupefaction halted them. After the first
pulseless moment of horror, exclamations
of dismay went up on all sides. For
Monty Brewster the first sensation of re
gret was followed by a diabolical sense of
Joy.
"Thank the Lord!" he said softly In the
hush.
The look of surprise he encountered In
the faces of his guests brought him up
with a Jerk. , .
â¢ "That -it didn't uappen .while we were
dining," he added with serene thankful
ness. And his nonchalance scored for him
In the idle game he was playing.
vn
Â¦ Mr. Brewster*B butler was surprised and
annoyed. For the first time In his official
career he had unbent so far as to mani
fest a personal Interest In the welfare of
his master. He was on the verge of as
suming a responsibility which makes any
servant- intolerable. But after his inter
view hÂ« resolved that 'he would' never
again overstep his position. He made
sure that It should be the last offense.
The day following the dinner Rawles ap
peared before young Mr. Brewster and in
dicated by. his manner that the call was
an important one. . Brewster was seated
at his writing-table, deep In thought. The
exclamation that followed Rawles' cough
of announcement was so sharp and so un
mistakably fierce that all other evidence
paled Into insignificance. The butler's in
terruption came at a moment when
Monty's mental arithmetic was pulling it
self out of a very bad rut, and the cough
drove It back Into chaos. .
"What Is It?" he demanded irritably.
Rawles .had upset his. calculations to the
extent of seven or eight hundred dollars.
"I came to _Â¦ report h'an h'unfortunate
condition h'among the servants, sir," said
Rawles. stiffening as his responsibility be
came more and more weighty. .He had re
laxed temporarily upon entering the room.
"What's the trouble?"
"The trouble's h'ended, sir." â¢
"Then why bother me about it?"
"I thought it would be well for you to
know, sir. The servants was going to ask
for'igner wlges to-day, sir."
"You. say they were going to ask?
Aren't they?" And Monty's eyes lighted
up at the thought of new possibilities.
-Â¦ *.'I convinced . them, . sir. as how they
were. getting good pay as it Is, sir, and
that they ought to be satisfied: They'd be
a long time' finding a better place and as
gqpd_wlges. . . They. !aven't. been with you
a week, and here they are strikin' for
more pay. Really, sir, these American
servants " . â¢
"Rawles, that'll . do!" exploded Monty.
The butler's chin went up and his cheeks
redder than ever. . * .;Â¦
"I beg pardon, ' sir." : he gasped, with a
respectful but injured air.
."Rawles. you will kindly not, Interfere
in such matters again. It is not' only the
privilege., but the duty of every Ameri
can,to. strike for higher pay whenever he
feels like It, and I want' it distinctly un
derstood that I am heartily in favor of
their attitude. You will kindly go back
and. tell them that after a reasonable
length of . service their . wigesâ I mean
wagesâ shall be Increased. And don't
meddle agaln.'Rawles." ' â¢ -
Late that afternoon Brewster dropped in
at Mrs. DeMlJle's to talk over plans for
the next dinner. . He realized that in no
other way could he squander his money
with. a better chance of getting its worth
than by. throwing himself bodily into so
ciety. It went easily, and there could be
only one asset arising, from It In the end
âhis own sense of disgust.
"So glad to see you,\ Monty," greeted
Mrs. Dan, glowingly, coming in with a
rush. "Come upstairs and I'll give you
some tea and a cigarette. I'm not at home
to anybody." â¢ < v
"That's very good of you,' Mrs^ Dan,"
said he, as they mounted the stairs. "I
don't know ' what I'd do without your
help." He was thinking how pretty she
was. Â¦
"You'd be richer, at any rate." turning
to 'smile upon him from the upper land
ing. "I was In team half the night,
Monty, over that glass screen," she said,'
after finding a comfortable place among
the cushions., of a 'divan.. Brewster
dropped into a roomy, lazy chair in front '
of her and j handed her a cigarette, as he
responded. carelessly: ..
"It Amounted to nothing. Of course. It
Â¦ was very annoying that It should happen
while thÂ« guests were still there." Then
he added, gravely. "In strict confidence,
I had planned to have It fall Just, as we
were pushing back our chairs, but the
confounded thins disappointed, me. That's
the trouble with these automatic clim
axes; they usually hang tire- It was to
have been a aort of Fall of Babylon ef
fect, you know."
"Splendid! But like Babylon,' It fell at
the wrong time." ...
For a lively quarter of an hour they dis
cussed people about town, liberally ap
. proving the slandered and denouncing the
slanderers. A still busier quarter of an
hour ensued when together they made up
the list of dinner guests. * He moved a lit
tle writing- table up, to the divan, and she
looked on eagerly while he , wrota down
the names she suggested , after . many
puckertngs of her fair, aristocratic brow,
and then drew lines through them when
she changed her . mind. Mrs. Dan De-
Mille handled her people without gloves
in making up Monty's lists. The dinners
were not hers, and she could afford to do
as she pleased with his; he was broad
and tall and she was not slow to see that
he was indifferent. He did not care who
the guests were. or. how they came; he
merely wished to make sure of their pres
ence. His only blunder was the rather
diffident recommendation that Barbara
Drew be asked again. If he observed
that Mrs. . Dan's head sank a little closer
to the paper, he attached no importance
to the movement; he could not see that
her eyes grew narrow, and he paid no at
tention to the little catch in her breath.
"Wouldn't that be a littleâ Just a little
pronounced?" she asked, lightly enough.
"You meanâ that people might talk?"
"She might feel conspicuously present."
"Do you think so? We are such good
friends, you know."
"Of course. If you'd like to. have her,"
slowly and doubtfully, "why, put her
name down. -But you evidently haven't
seen that." Mrs. Dan pointed to a copy
of the Trumpet which lay on the table.
When he had handed her the paper she
said, " The Censor* Is growing facetious
at your expense."
"I am getting on In soc.ety with a
vengeance If that ass starts In to wrlta
about me. Listen to this," she had point
ed out to him the obnoxious paragraph.
" 'If Brewster Drew a diamond flush, do
you suppose he'd catch the queen? And
If he caught her, how long do you think
she'd remain Drew? Or, If she Drew
Brewster, would she be willing to learn
such a game as Monte?' "
The next morning a writer who. signed
himself "The Censor" got a thrashing and
one Montgomery Brewster had his name
in the papers, surrounded by fulsome
words of praise.
VIIL
One morning not long after the Inci
dents Just related Brewster lay in bed.
staring at the celling, deep in thought.
There was a worried pucker on his fore
- head, half hidden by the rumpled hair,
and his eyes were wide and sleepless. Ho
had dined at the Drews' the evening be
fore and had had an awakening. As hÂ«
thought of the matter he could recall no
special occurrence that he could really
use as evidence. Colonel and Mrs. Drew
had been as kind as ever and Barbara
could not have been more charming. But
something had gone wrong and he had
endured- a wretched evening.
"That little English Johnnie was to
blame," he argued. ."Of course, Barbara
had a right to put any one she liked next
to her, but why she should have chosen
that silly ass Is more than I know, j By
Jove, if I had been on the other side I'll
warrant his grace would have been lost
in the dust."
His brain was whirling and for the first
time he was beginning to feel the un
pleasant pangs of Jealousy. The Duke of
Beauchamp he especially disliked, al
though the poor man had hardly spoken
during the dinner. But Monty could not
be reconciled. He knew, of course, that
Barbara had suitors by the dozen, but It
had never occurred to him that they were
even seriously considered. Notwithstand
ing the fact that his encounter with "The
Censor" had brought her into undesirable
notice, she forgave him' everything after
a moment's consideration. The first few
wrenches of resentment were overbal
anced by her American appreciation of
chivalry, however inspired. "The Censor"
had gone for years unpunished, his coarse
wit being aimed at every one who had
come into social prominence. So pungent
and vindictive was his pen that other men
feared him, and there were many woo
lived in rlass houses In terror of a fusil
lade. Brewster's prompt and sufficient
action had checked the pernicious attacks
and he . became a hero among men and
women. After that night there was no
point to "The Censor's" pen. Monty's
first qualms of apprehension were swept
away when Colonel Drew himself bailed
him the morning after the encounter and
in no unmeasured terms congratulated
him upon his achievement, assuring him
that Barbara and Mrs. Drew approved,
although they might lecture him as a
matter of form.
But. on this morning, as . he. lay In .his
bed Monty was thinking deeply and pain
fully. He was confronted by a most em*
barrasslng condition and he was discuss
ing It soberly with himself. /'I've never
told her," he said to himself, "but If she
doesn't know my, feeling she Is not as
clever as I think. 'Besides, I haven't time
to make love to' her now. If it were any
other girl I suppose I'd have to, but Babs,
why, she must understand. And yetâ
damn that Duke!" . - ,
In order to woo her . properly he would
be compelled to neglect financial duties
that needed every particle of brain en
ergy at his command.' He found himself
opposed at the outset by a startling em
barrassment, made absolutely clear by
the computations of the night before. The
last four days of indifference to finance
on one side, and pampering the heart on
the other had proved very costly. To usÂ«
his own expression, he â¢ had been "set
back" almost eight thousand dollars. An
average like, that would be ruinous.
"Why. think of it." he continued. "For
each day sacrificed to Barbara I must de
something like $2500. A long campaign
woujd put me irretrievably in the hole:
I'd get so far behind that a holocaust
couldn't put me even. She can't expect
that of me, yet girls are such idiots about
devotion, and, of course, she doesn't
know what a heavy task I'm facing. And
there are the othersâ what . will - they do
while I am out of the running? I cannot

JHaffZsasB&gyg jelle if it had not been
accepted as a fact ever since she put up
her hair and let down her frocks that
Â» he was. in the neighborhood phrase,
"mortgaged property." Phil Mayben had
laid claim to her when the came hardly
to his elbow. He had, further, let no
body dispute the claim, even after she
came back from boarding-school, fear
fully and wonderfully accomplished. He
was a big fellow, square-jawed and
square-beaded, who cared nothing fcr
books unless they dealt with figures. At
figures he was marvelously quick and
clever â so clever It was nothing for him
to ejump successive schoolmasters, even
though they were college-bred, while he
knew nothing higher than the neighbor
hood academy.
Possibly it was a triumph of this sort
which had flret Incited the present school
master, I^eonard Trabue, to try con
clusions with him in the field of Miss
Janey's fa\'or. Janey loved books In the
freshest, most whole-hearted fashion â
Trabue could talk books by the hour, and
talk very welL Naturally he found bim
celf welcome at the Gates homestead.
Quite as naturally Phil Mayben resented
his presence there, and showed It out
right, after the manner of a masterful
man crazlly in love. Thus, by fate and
free wfll, and the obligation of hospital
ity, Janey was in a manner forced to
take Trabue's part. The result was a
very pretty quarrel, and the transfer of
Phil's attentions to Miss Dora Meakins.
There had been no set engagement to
breakâ that made Phil's attitude .all the
more aggravating. Janey was, for
months, bitterly unhappy over the rup
ture, although she let nobody see itâ not
even her mother. Outwardly she was
gayer than ever, and so charming Mr.
Leonard Trabue quite lost his head. He
had meant at first only to . punish that
pestilent fellow, Maybenâ incidentally, of
the picnic season opened in mid-May.
SJster Meakins and Sister Hodgin, self
elected social autocrats, got up the first
one and set the place for Itâ Clear Spring,
just a little way off the Gates' pasture.
The spring Â¦was. in fact,* Gate*' property,
so Sister Meakins let the owner know she
thought it would be no more than neigh
borly of him to pu^ up the tables, seats
and stakes for the gypsy kettles, to say
nothing of the swings. There Phil May
ben interfered. "You don't play a lone
hand at this game with me around,
squire," he Bald to Janey's father. Thus
It ftll out that for two days before the
picnic he was nearly as much in Janey's
eyes as he had been all winter In her
mind.
It amazed. and somewhat frightened her
to find how equably she regarded him.
Squire Gates brought him to dinner
whether or no, and Janey shook hands
with him and chatted gayly throughput
the meal without the least flutter of the.
heart. She even watched him go away
with no access of sentiment.
If only Trabue had spoken there and
then! But he was invisible until next
day. The picnic crowd gathered early.
Phil was the life of it, though Dora Mea
kins stuck to him like a limpet. He even
bowed civilly to Trabue, who hung about
Janey, his eyes downcast, his look pre
occupied. The end of the school term was
just three weeks ahead. Before he came
to that parting of the ways he felt that
he must know exactly where Â¦ he stood.
Janey had grown distinctly kinderâ stfll
there was something in her kindness that
put him farther off. She would be an
ideal wife for him. A bold stroke would
do it now â a year hence would be quite
too late.
While the laughing and chatter were at
flood he drew her apart and poured out to
course, to divert himself and pass time
otherwise heavy on his hands. Teaching
was merely a stop-gap. Literature was
his chosen vocation. He meant to enter
upon It through the gate of newspaper
work as soon as he could scrape together
a few hundred dollars.
The Gateses were not rich folk, but still
comfortably off, and Janey an only child.
It is but Just to say the fact had little to
do with Trabue's falling in love. That
came upon him unawares. But once he
had realized his frame of affections, he
took full cognisance of it. Might It not
be easier to make himself immortal even
here In the deep country, with a charming
wife, and assured comfort, than out in
the hustle and hurly-burly of a city? To
settle It out of hand, he proposed plumply
to Janey. He was dazed to get a refusal,
distressed, almost tearful.
Next week' the county paper printed,
with flattering comments, a love rhyme,
signed "Leofric." Cane Creek read It, be
cause reading the paper through was cer
tainly the part of thrift If not of Chris
tian duty. Still It felt no curiosity as to
the authorshiD until the rural press quite
generally copied and praised the rhyme. A
second bit of verse got reprinted In three
city papers, so, upon the appearance of
the third, Leofric's identity became a
burning questionâ one that the editor him
self could not answer. All he knew was
that the copy came to him by the hand
of Mr. Murdock, a leading lawyer.
All winter long Leofric wrote Intermit
tently, becoming more and more a riddle
and a personage. AH winter long, too,
Phil Mayben ate Sunday dinners at the
Meakins' table, and Leonard Trabue
talked books and the world to Janey
Gates. He was playing a waiting game
resolved to win her. In spite of herself and
Phil Mayben.
Janey's heart was singularly steadfast:
still, there were times when she thought
Trabue would succeed. Phil's going had
left her desolate, indeed; he could never
have cared as he pretended, or he would
not be able to stay away. Of course, she
could not make the first move to reconcil
iation, especially einc"e he was so. taken
up with the Meakins' generation. Since
he was forever lost to her. It was far
from unpleasant to sun herself in Tra
bue's devotion.
Spring came with such a rush that year
had fits. Billy Barnes had said so. Peter
was thinking seriously of getting his
pitcher and treating Mr. Pnillet to a
shower bath when the door-knob turned
and his Aunt Bertha came into the room.
To his delight the minister rose from, his
chair.
"Why, Mr. PhWet!" she said, "what la
the matter? Your face is so flushed; hxvÂ«
you a fever?"
"No," Peter called down. "I guess it
was a fit." Aunt- Bertha looked op.
"What does the child mean?" she said,
turning to thÂ» minister.
"I'll tell you." shouted Peter, "I
said ha ate all the chicken he could
hold, and he says it's ( so. and I
said he came hers to see you. and he says
it's a storyâ he didn't Jest say so. but ha
thinks so. and It give him a fit. X guess."
Bertha's face was as red as the minis
ter's. "Of course, Mr. Phillet doesn't
come here to see me, Peter!" she said
severely. Aunt Bertha had never spoken
to him like that before. He shut his eyes
to keep the tears back. When he opened
them the minister was looking up at him.
"Come down here, Peter," he said, "and
change places with your Aunt Bertha. It
is she who tells a storyâ you are truth It
self 1 I do come here to see her. but I've
been afraid to say so. You see she doesn't
care for ma at all. Peter."
Then his Aunt Bertna said something
very disrespectful (Peter thought) to the
minister. She saidâ very lowâ "Who is
telling a story now? It is you who should
go upstairs!"
But neither of them came up. They
moved into a corner of the room, where
Peter couldn't see them at all. And by
and by his mother came in and said sup
per wis ready.
Peter began to undressâ very slowly,
for his stomach was empty, and he had
almost decided to go down and say that
he was sorry, but it was all true. He was
putting on his coat again when his mother
came into the room. She kissed his
freckled, little. face, and said soothingly,
"Go down, dear, and eat your supper
now. Aunt Bertha has a big dish of
peaches and cream ready for you. The
minister has explained everythingâ ho
says you did him a great kindness."
Peter wondered what it was.
excuse me," she said, "while I whip some
cream for the peaches."
Peter's mouth wateredâ peaches and
whipped cream! He didn't know they
were to .have that! No wonder the min
ister looked pleased! He watched him
seat himself In the easiest chair In the
room; It was directly under the stovepipe
hole. An Idea came Into Peter's little
closely-cropped headâ he would fish the
tidy from the back of the minister's
chair! But scarcely had he dropped his
hook and line when the minister looked
up and caught him.
"Come down and see me," he said, Just
like an every-day man.
"Can't," Peter said.
"Why not?" the minister asked, getting
up from his chair. "Have to catch the
fish for supper?" he said laughingly, with
a glance at the hook and line.
Peter blushed through his freckles. "No.
sir," he said, "ma says I can't come down
till I say I'm sorry."
"Sorry for what, Peter?"
"Sorry I told such a story, 'bout you!"
"About me?" \he minister said.
"Yes, sir; Iâ Iâ said you was fond of
chicken."
Mr. Phillet laughed heartily. "That
isn't a story." he said, "I am!"
"That ain't all," Peter confessed. "I
said you ate all the chicken you could
hold."
Mr. Phillet blushed guiltily. "I'm afraid
I am something of a p-i-g. when there's
chicken before' me. Was that all you
said. Peter?"
"No, sir; I said "
"Yes?" the minister prompted him gen
tly. "You said "
"I said you came here to see Aunt
Bertha," he blurted out.
The. Rev. Mr. Phillet sat down again
in his chair and gasped. "Did your
Aunt Bertha- hear you say that?" he
asked feebly.
1 "No, sir; don't 'you worry, sirâ she
wa'n't anywhere around."
Mr. Phillet was silent so long that Peter
grew uneasy. He cleared his throat in
hopes that the minister would look up,
but he didn't; he sat stillâ so very still
that Peter imagined all manner of dread
ful thingsâ probably he was dead, or hav
ing a fit! That was itâ he was having a
fit! They threw water on folks when they

said, "Plague take It!" under his breath,
and came In at a snail's pace.
"What's he corain* for?" he asked, re
sentfully, while his mother poked a wash
cloth uncomfortably around his ear?
"To visit your father and me," Mrs.
Grayson said, complacently.
"No, he ain't, neltaer! He's comln* to
see Aunt Bertha, and eat all the chicken

"Peter Grayson," his . mother said se

and undress and go to bed. I won't allow
such ' disrespectful language to go unpun
ishedâand there isn't a word of truth In

Peter started for the stair door, sniffing
hungrily ' as he passed the loaded table.
"You can come down and eat your sup
per when you're ready* to say you're sor
ry for telling such a story," his mother
called, relentlngly.
Peter's room was directly over the par
lor. When there was talking down below
he could hear It distinctly. It was warm
â¢weather; now, and the stove had been
taken down, so that he could see, as well
as hear. When the doorbell rang he lay
flat on his stomach and watched his
mother usher the Rev. Mr. Phillet into
the parlor. "I snail have to ask yqji to

pleaded, be Intellectual comrades? Sus
tained by her companionship, lie felt him
self capable of great thingsâ he had al
ready made a beginning, and *he was all
unwittingly the inspiration of what he
had done.
There he tried to take her hand. Janey
withdrew it gently. "Tell me all about
It,'.' she whispered, a hovering smile
about her lips. Trabue bent her ear and
said hurriedly: ."You must not mention
it. sweetheart, but I am Leofricâ Leofric.

because you refused him."
"Indeed!" Janey said, getting up from
her "mossy rock to slip past him. Then
over her shoulder added: "You will please
wait until after noon for your answer. I
must go help about the dinner."
Dinner was so fine a feast Lawyer Mur
dock declared he felt more than paid for
his long drive out from town. He was
Squire Gates' man of business and Janey's
sworn friend. Therefore i}obody won

even Phil Mayben smiled approval when
the Umlyer kissed Janey In greeting. But
be sure there was a stir as Lawyer Mur

crowd, raised his voice, and said, with
twinkling eyes: "Ladles and gentlemen,
I like unmasking humbugs, so permit me
to present to youâ Leofric. the poetess of
Cane Creek. Don't remember it against
her that she is a poetessâ It's all the

"It won't be any longer, Mr. Murdock,"
Phil said, bursting through the crowd to
catch Janey in his arms and hide her
blushes in his breast. "I know/ I've been
seven kinds of a fool," he went on. ;.' "I
don't deserve Janeyâ nobody does, for
that matter; but I'm going to have her,

"You've got her,'" Lawyer Murdock
said, wringing Phil's hand. Dora Meak

MYSTERIOUS LEOFRIC
"There Was a Boar and a Bound, and He Went Down in a Flash."
due time the beast became full-grown and
was in and out of the bungalow like a
favorite dog. He was apparently tame,
but now and then be moped and snarled
and betrayed the ferocity lying dormant
in bis nature, but on such occasions he
was given the whip and always crouched
in submission at his master's feet. Like
the average dog, the tiger had his likes
and dislikes of men. Some of the officers
never laid hands on his head without be
ing rewarded by a low, deep growl, while
he was ready to welcome and make
friends with others. Among the former
was Major Swift. He had been exchanged
from an English cavalry regiment and
been received! cordially. He was a gay
bachelor of 40, supposed to be possessed
of a large income, and a man who was
first in society and sport of all kinds.
That he had lived a fast life was known
to all, but that fact was not permitted
to count against' him. His many friends
boasted of his gains or losses on the race
track or at cards, and held him up as
free-handed and a good fellow.
There had Just been a breath of scan
dal about the major at Allahabad. It had
been softly -whispered that he had run
through his patrimony and was 1 hard up,
and that bis success at cards was not al
ways due to luck alone. These whispers
did not circulate far and were stamped
as the result of spite and Jealousy. No
one but the major himself knew that
they were founded on fact and that they
were the sole reason for his exchange.
He was tendered a farewell banquet by
the officers of his late regiment and the
soldier or civilian who had dared to re
peat the gossip of Allahabad would have
been silenced very quickly. Had the ma
jor been a man to take any one into his
confidence and reveal his true situation
he would have been obliged to eay:
"At 40 years old I am without a dollar
1 cart call my own. My estate Is mort
gaged for its full value; I am in debt
to the money lenders; my last two horses
are not paid for: I owe my tailors and
am being pressed for payment and if I
Ehould lose Â£20 at cards to-nlgh't I should
have to borrow, the money to pay the
debt of honor. I am simply living on my
past reputation as a man of money, and
I see no way to better my circumstances
except to become a card sharp and fleece
the officers at this cantonment."
That would have been the truth and
only the truth, but the major would have
sent a bullet through his head rather
than make any such admission.
There was much sporting blood in the
Bengal Lancers, and the officers played
for high stakes. The major did not have
to encourage them to gamble; they were
waiting for him, but they soon had cause
to regret that he had appeared. His bets
were high and his luck phenomenal. But
for his continued extravagance he could

. V JJ ITH Miss Merriam the
incredible had hap
l^wMW'In pencd. She was tired
'yBftgfE&iR, ot hearing that she was
Vwlmir beautiful. From her
/fSwalfflval^ earliest recollections
]*^JyrAJ?Sl strangers had ex
fi*ffi~~â¢*^n&fi claimed over her pretty
face, and her lovers, one after another,
had rung the variations on the same
theme. Miss Merriam listened politely to
their extravagances and found herself ex
tremely bored.
"To be loved for your face Is like being
loved for your fortune," Miss Merriam
cenfided to ; her Journal. '"Beauty has
wings Just as truly as riches. If a- man
falls in love with your complexion, what
is he going to do when you come down
with the smallpox? If I were a pretty
fool I might be perfectly satisfied with
things as they are, but I know I'm worth
loving for myselfâ if only they had the
sense to find it out."
Unfortunately for themselves, "Miss Mer
riam's adorers never suspected her pecu
liar views. If there had been one of their
number shrewd enough to compliment her
Intellect Instead of her dimples and to
have talked about her sparkling wit rath
er than her Bparkling eyes, he would have
found the short cut^to her heart. As it
was, they were unanimous in deciding
that the aforementioned article had been
omitted from her composition. And Miss
Merriam expressed her displeasure in the
following paragraph in her Journal:
"Beauty! beauty! beauty! #How tiresome
it all is. I wish I might never . hear I
was beautiful again."
Rash prayers sometimes bring unwel
come answers. Not very many days later
the city was electrified by the news that
Miss Merriam had been thrown from her
automobile at a well-known watering
place and seriously injured. Pictures of
the beauty appeared In all the leading
newspapers of the country, with reference
to her possible disfigurement. Miss Mer
riam'3 relatives when appealed to on this
important point refused to say anything
to relieve the suspense or to satisfy the
popular curiosity. And the explanation
of their reticence was apparent when
Miss Merriam made her appearance in so
ciety a few weeks later. Across the fault-
less curve of the girl's cheek ran an un
sightly scar, a scar so aggressively prom
inent that it held the attention of the ob
server and made him forgetful of all else.
It seemed likely that Miss Merriam was
to have her heart's desire and never again
be forced to hear that she was beautiful.
Lloyd Hollister saw her for the first
time at one of the opening functions of
the season, a few days- after his return
from abroad. "Notice that girl over
there," a friend said, pulling his sleeve.
"Last spring she was the 'beautiful Miss
Merriam.', and see her now. Hard luck.
Isn't it?"
Hollister looked as directed. He saw
a small head 'regally carried, a mass of
dazzling hair and eyes that shot violet
lights from under their arched brows.
Then Miss Merriam turned her head and
he eaw the scar and nothing else.
"I'd be sorrier for her," the man- at his
elbow went on, "If she hadn't turned
down half the fellows in her set I guess
she thought she was good for a duke
with that face of hers. Introduce you.
did you say? Why, certainly, my dear
fellow."
It was the Innate chivalry of Hollister's
nature which had prompted him to ask
the honor of Miss Merriam's acquain
tance. He was as sorry for the girl as
he was disgusted with -the cold-blooded
comments of tha man who had pointed
her out to him. For the first few mo
ments of their conversation he unscrupu
lously kept his eyes away from her. He
could not bear to witness the beauty In
eclipse, and he fancied that she) who had
been so used to reading admiration in
the eyes of every man must wince at the
pity which tact could not conceal.
Presently he found that admiration was
getting the better of his sympathy. This
quondam beauty was not crushed by her
misfortune. She met this thunderbolt of
fate's spite with a gallant courage which
quickened Holllster's pulses. Her easy
gayety. her apparent unconsciousness of
her situation, appealed to him as no wom
an's beautv had ever done. He made
the discovery that Miss Merriam was
brilliant, if not longer beautiful, and that
her cleverness, unlike that of many of
her sex, owed nothing to ill nature.
In the months that followed he saw a
great deal of Miss Merriam. It was clear
that the girl's liking for social pleasure
remained unaltered by the change in her
circumstances. She went everywhere,
and to all appearances enjoyed herself in
spite of the sudden falling off In the num
ber of her admirers. There had been a
time when the man who wished a word
with the beautiful Mls3 Merriam was
obliged to fight his way through a double
ring of black coats, but Hollister had no
difficulty in gaining her side whenever he
went. Yet the deposed queen of hearts
seemed so unconscious of anything about
her which called for sympathy that Hol
llster suppressed his pity as if it had been
a form of disloyalty. And after a time
he no longer found this difficult. He ad
mired Miss Merriam too much to be sorry
for her. In every quality of mind and
heart she met his ideal of what a woman
Fhould be. As for the scar, he looked at
it now unshrinkingly. Whatever he did
he meant to act with his eyes open.
The night he asked her to marry him
they sat In Miss Merriam's little library,
where the flickering light of the grate
fell full upon her face. No man worthy
of the name Is voluble when he lays his
heart and life in the hollow of a woman's
hand. Hollister stammered through his
lovemaklng like a boy. As he went on
Miss Merriam turned away her face so
that the profile was toward him. The
light of the fire flashed on the scar, and It
stood out in livid relief. As a rule Hol
llster was not fanciful, but for an in
stant the gash seemed the mocking mouth
of a demon, stretched In a fiendish grin.
Holllster waited for a long time for an
answer to his question. Miss Merriam's
face was averted and he could see that
she was stirred by some strong emotion.
When he made a movement to take her
hand she turned toward him suddenly,
and he saw that her eyes were brimming
with tears.
"You are a brave man, Mr. Holllster,"
she said in a' voice not quite steady.
"Have you thought of this?" Her fingers
touched the scar with a strange, half
caressing gesture. "Have you thought
what It will mean to have every passer-by
look at your wife pityingly and whisper
as you pass?" * ',,
"I love you." was Holllster's answer.
"If there is a hard thing In your life It Is
my right to share it." Then his head
whirled at the* look of sudden adoration
that leaped from her eyes.
"Oh. I wanted to find a man like you,"
Miss Merriam whispered. "I was sure
there must be such a one in the world."
And then she was In his arms, with the
poor, scarred cheek pressed to him. sob
bing out her heart in a burst of exultant
triumph that enraptured him without his
understanding it In the least.
When they said good-night Miss Mer
riam clung to her lover as If reluctant to
let him out of her sight. "I must see you
in the morning, dearest," she said. "You
must spare me a few moments." And
Hollister, who was looking forward to the
separation of a few hours as if It had
been as many weeks, agreed with a sud
den lightness of heart.
He wondered a little when he came next
morning that she should keep him wait
ing. His heart leaped at every footstep
In the hall for the first half-hour, and
when at last she stole Into the room, clos
ing the door behind her. she took him by
surprise. Holllster sprang to his feet, then
stood staring blankly.
An enchanting face smiled up at him.
a face rosy with blushes. He saw the
play of the dimples and the curve of the
cheek as if he were looking on It for the
first time. The scar was gone.
"My God!" said Hollister helplessly,
and he dropped into a chair, bis own face
dead pale. Miss Merriam ran to him and
dropped on her knees beside his chair,
looking Into his eyes with a fascinating
mixture of timidity and confidence.
"Forgive me. dearest. Don't be angry
Â¦with me for deceiving yon. If you only
knew how tired I grew of men who
couldn't see anything in me to love but
my pretty face. That little accident with
my automobile was too good an oppor
tunity to mi3s, and the scar was easily
put on. An actress showed me how to
do it. but I flatter myself that after a
little I improved upon my teacher/*
Sho smiled at Holllster shyly and did
not seem to find his silence discouraging.
"Please don't say you like me better thÂ«
other way. I almost grew to hate my
beauty when it blinded people to all the
rest in me. but now I'm glad to have It
to give to the man who loved mÂ« for
myself."
Several complexion specialists claimed
the credit for removing the scar that had
ruined Miss Merriam's beauty and reaped
golden harvests thereby. But the beauti
ful Miss Merrlam never regained her
title, for the reason that her identity was
soon merged in that of the beautiful Mrs
Holllster.

with the money' won during the first six
weeks. Those not In the game praised
his nerve and talked of his luck; those
who always came out losers did a great
deal of thinking, but were silent. At the
end of two months whispers ' were heard
again. No one could trace them to any
authentic source, and they did not exact
ly charge the major with card sharping,
but when they reached the colonel's ears
he listened and planned. He himself had
been a heavy and continuous loser, and
had not always been a philosopher as his
gold changed hands. There had been

where and the first time that Major Swift

became sulky and morose. There was
no outbreak of temper, but he lay down
and fastened his eyes on the major as
if reading him through and through and
it was evident that there was dislike and
distrust of the man. The beast contin
ued his glare until the colonel's man was
ordered to take him away and tie him
up. The colonel had said nothing to any
of thÂ« officers, but he 'had secretly de
termined to watch the major's play and
discover if there was a cause for his win
ning the way he did. The major could
havÂ« had no hint of it, and yet perhaps
intuition had given him warning, and he
was not himself at all. He played and
won. but he also played and lost, and
his losses â¢were far greater than his gains.
Seated at his right hand and taking no
active part in the game was the colonel,
and he never left his chair from first to
last. The major came out loser by Â£200
On the next night he lost Â£73; on the
third night Â£100. He made good his first
two losses from his former gains, but
when he rose from the third sitting he
knew that he would have to borrow of a
brother officer to pay his losses.
The officer had not been detected cheat
ing, but he had been out of luck. The
colonel may have put two and two to
gether in his own mind and so perhaps
might one or two of the players, but the
party broke up with the greatest appar
ent good feeling all around, and half an
hour later the colonel was In bed. He

for this reason that at night the tiger
was given free range of the bungalow.
There were no sentinels stationed outside
the , place, but a native watchman slept
on the veranda. At 2 o'clock In the morn
ing this man slept and the colonel was
In dreamland. The tiger was stretched
on the floor, blinking and dozing, when
he suddenly pricked up his ears and
opened wide his eyes. He had heard a
step on the earth outside. As he listened
the step came nearer. It being in the
heat of the summer, the doorways were
guarded only by mats. Presently the an
imal saw one of these slightly move and
ho got the scent of a stranger. He did
not growl or spring up, but the fire In
his eyes grew brighter and his teeth be
gan to show. The man, who slowly and
carefully pushed the mat aside and crept
Into the room, which was one in which
the guests had been entertained that
night, ought to have caught the blaze of
the tiger's eyes In the darkness, but he
did not. With footfalls as gentle as a
hare's he stole across the room to the
colonel's desk. The desk had been care
lessly left unlocked and he took from it
a bag containing the money to be given
to the winning horses of the races to be
held a week later. There was Â£600 in the
bag, and the robber had Just turned from
the desk to make his stealthy escape
when there was a roar and a bound and
he went down with a crash. It was
hardly a minute before the colonel was
at hand with a light, but the beast bad
done his work. A blow from his paw
as he sprang had broken the man's neck,
and teeth and claws were still at work.
He was promptly shot, and then thÂ«
colonel bent down and rolled the dead
man over that he might see his fa?e.

THE SUNDAY GALL^S
Two pull Pages of trje Cleverest FictioQ by the Cleverest Writers
HALT-HOUR J .ST0RIEOES .ory Is Justly notorious to-day.
The murderer's guests were at first
charmed by their host's irreproachable
courtesy. His wines were of the finest
quality and he was most generous with
them, although he personally did not Im
bibe over-freely. . His slaves came to the
table and vanished at a gesture of his
hand. Certainly it was a most orderly
house In this respect.
Strange to say, there was never more
than one guest In the castle at a time.
To this day it Is said, "They were come
and gone rapidly."
"They treat me badly," Hutchison used
to say, with a queer smile. "They know I
love to have them visit me, and I am al
ways sorry I could not keep them
longer." It was the desire of this blood,
thirsty tiger to have the pleasure of kill
ing his victims over again.
Hutchison would award the finest room
In the castle to the passing guest and the
household would seemingly retire. But
in the night the door leading to the con
ning tower would open and a ray of
starlight reveal the demoniacal face of
the betrayed girl's brother.
"Against all men!" he would mutter
and steal into his guest's room. The
explosion of a Horse pistol was the sig
nal for several stalwart slaves to drag
the victim's body to a cave near the
house.
In this cave no less than thirty bodies
were hidden, their mutilated skeletons
being afterward discovered.
This castle of crime continued to flour
ish until the year 1773, when a traveler
who was seeking shelter one night saw
and heard things which decided him in
choosing the sward for a couch and the
stars for a coverlet. He communicated
his discovery to the Government at Span
ish Town, with the result that an inves
tigation was ordered. f
One of Hutchison's slaves heard that
the soldiers were coming to look at the
famous scenery around "Edinburgh Cas
tle" and warned his master. The mur
derer thought that the Bcenery would In
ho way suffer by his absence and fled to
the Jungle.
When the soldiers arrived they found
some interesting relics in the black cave,
and sought to thank Mr. Hutchison for
his hospitality. But the host at that mo
ment was drifting In an open boat on
the Caribbean Sea to the north of the
island. Intent upon reaching Cuba and
safety. * .
The Jamaican Government beat the Jun
gle for several days, then gave up the
chase after a supposed suicide.
Admiral Rodney, who was then cruis
ing in West Indian waters, was return
ing to Port Royal, when from the quar
terdeck of his battleship he espied a
speck upon the ocean. It was a drifting
boat. In It Rodney found a man dying
of thirst. The castaway was picked 1 trp
and restored to consciousness. It was
Hutchison.
When the murderer learned that he
was aboard of a British battleship bound
for Port Royal he wanted to Jump over
board. Rodney's sailors restrained him.
however, feeling some pity for the man,
not knowing the real reason for his oft
attempted suicide. They believed his suf
ferings bad rendered him Insane.
In the meantime the Jamaican Govern
ment had gathered such evidence that,
when Hutchison arrived at the capital,
Spanish Town, he was promptly tried and
sentenced to be hanged.
On the night before his execution the
murderer, wrote his last will and testa
ment "Don the wall of his prison cell.
He left freedom and wealth to his slaves
(none of whom waited for freedom when
the soldiers came), reserving only Â£100
for the erection of a tombstone over hla
own head. The following lines are en
graved on the stone. In accordance with
the desire expressed in his will: .
LEWIS HUTCHISON,
Hanged in Spanish Town, Jamaica.
On the 16th Mornlnj? of March, In the
Year of His Lord. 1773.
Aged 40 Tears.'
Their sentence, pride and malice I defy.
Despise their power, and like a Roman die.
After writing these lines he cursed all
men anu âed.
When the fly accepted the spider did the
rest. For the "rest" Hutchison's mem-
Bald tha cplder to the fly.
In these days the island of Jamaica,
West Indies, was the dumping ground
for every scapsgraoe son and ne'er-do
weel disowned by Indignant parents. The
home of former pirates was also a harbor
of refuge for criminals from the other
sidewalks of life.
Hutchison escaped to Jamaica, where
be bought a tract of land near Pedro, St.
Ann. There he built a residence, which
In the bitterness of his heart he named
Edinburgh Castle.
The house had a conning tower with
little windows and was built on the sum
mit of a ridge commanding a view of the
country for miles around. Here the mur
derer lived with a number of brutal ne
groes, all of whom were enslaved to their
master's criminal vows. ,
Hutchison never worked, never read
books and seldom ate or slept, it Is said.
He spent his days In the conning, tower,
with a powerful telescope scanning the
orange *and pimento groves that stretched
away In the vista of a man-cursed para
dise. When a traveler hove in sight this
mysterious man dispatched a negro slave
on horseback with a pressing invitation
to come and dine at "Edinburgh Castle"â
Why, spend a few days or so.
There was nothing suspicious about this
Invitation. Even to this day Jamaica is
famous for its hospitality. Not even an
utter stranger need feel any hesitation
to-day about accepting such an Invita
tion as Hutchison urged if pressed by
a modern Jamaican planter.
But In Hutchison's case hesitation and
refusal meant a great deal to the Invited
guest. It was parallel with the old nur
sery rhyme:
"Will yon w&lk Into my parlorT"
Tie yocsg lord referred to became en
tnored of this beautiful girl, and In time
ehe became the victim of a foolish and
disastrous Infatuation on her own port.
Then love died, as the young woman did
ehortly afterward cf chaine and a broken
heart.
Letrta Hutchison, the brother, then
swore tn oath of vengeance against ail
men and particularly against the young
and thoughtless lord. One night the two
men met on a lonely read on the out
skirts cf Edinburgh. There was an alter
cation, followed by a sword thrust, and
Hutchison fled the country, leaving bis
first victim's body In a ditch.
Early In the eighteenth century. It ap
peared, a Scotsman named Lewis Hutchi
son lived with an only sister on the estate
of a young lord near Edinburgh. Th-j sis
ter was the only relative Hutchison pos
sessed, and, apart from her great beauty,
he loved her as a man loves his all In
life.

Shorty Mahan was terror-stricken at the

house, then reappeared, empty-handed,
and ran back to her own home.
"Ehe had borrowed something, no

She pushed aside her coffee cup, laid a

offered, and left the car. Her chair was

The eun was setting and two people were
walking up the narrow flagged path. The
man pulled out a key. threw open the

did not look like a minister. He was
something of an athlete and had an alert
air. A moment later be was opening the

F course, it is very ob
vious that his, first name
was "Shorty.'* but. what
is not bo obvious, his
last name was not Ma
han. The name the reo
tor pronounced when h\
stood before the font
with the wriggling infant in his arms was
Jefferson Douglass Jerrold. They were a
fine old family, the Jerrolds. with an
abundance of heirloom silver, faded an
cestral portraits-one of them a Copleyâ
and enough family pride to sink a ship.
When Jefferson Douglass had grown
into a short, thickset youth, with sandy
red hair and a mobile face, which effectu
ally concealed his thoughts and emotions,
the family council set about to choose a
career for him which would do credit to
the silver, the portraits and the family
pride. I
The exact moment when he decided
what that career should be was that Octo
ber afternoon when Michael Ryan, ath
letic trainer and ex-middle-weight, rose
grogglly from the floor of the gymnasium
and rubbed the point of his Jaw in a
dazed fashion. Before him, unlacing the
boxing gloves which encased his hands,
stood a short, thickset young man with
sandy red hair and an impassive face.
Ryan pulled off his own gloves and ex
tended his hand, which the other shook
gravely.
"If I could hit like that," said Ryan, "I
wouldn't be here. Man, I could make a
wonder of you In a year's time."
That was why Jefferson Douglass cut
short his course at college, where, to tell
the truth, he was not succeeding tremen
dously along prescribed lines, and, in a
stormy interview at home, announced his

neglected to state, but when the identity
of Shorty Mahan, the newly arrived stel
lar attraction in the lightweight class,
was finally forced upon his unwilling fam-
lly, and their suspicious fear became bit
ter truth, his father swore roundly and
wept
Just two weeks after this announcement
Shorty Mahan, with his trainers. Bis
sparring partner, his rubbers and his bull
terrier, took up his abode in a little cot
tage on the shore of Freshwater Lake*
prepared for the monotonous three
months of training which was to fit him
for the fight of his life.
The trouble began one May evening Just
at sunset, as Mahan and Jim Delaney. his
sparring partner, were returning from a
ten-milo run along the country roads.
They had reached the village and were
Jogging easily along the elm-lined streets
when Mahan noticed a young woman
standing beneath a cherry tree 'and call
ing in tones of coaxing anxiety to an
Angora kitten, which sulked among the
branches at the top of the tree. He
stopped short and turned Into the yard.
' "If you'll permit me," he said, dofflng
his cap, "I'll get the kitten for you."
"Oh, If you would be so good," said
the girl, flushing becomingly.
In another moment Shorty Mahan's red
head was among the topmost branches,
and then, with the kitten In bis arms, he
slid deftly to the ground.
"Gee," said Delaney, when Shorty
Joined him outside the fence, "pretty
nifty, wasn't she?"
Shorty wheeled on him suddenly.
"Jim," he said shortly, "that was a
lady. Remember It, If you please." And
then he cut out a pace for the training
quarters which landed Delaney there per
spiring and well-nigh blown.
Delaney remembered afterward that
It was directly after the kitten affair that
Mahan began to behave rather strangely.
He insisted on taking his dally run quite
alone. He foundâ or Inventedâ numerous
errands which took him to the village,
and he went there alone also. Every
Sunday night precisely at seven he
slipped off for a quiet walk by himselfâ
so he said. *
The weeks went past and the time of
the fight approached. Instead of In
creasing Interest In his training Shorty's

looking up, "but I have acceptedâ another

The great man fairly Jumped.
"But, my dear young .woman, yon

"I have consideredâ and thl* is for

This time she looked up, straight Into
the eyes of the great man. Something
ho read there made him rise and extend
his hand cordially.
"My dear Miss Ashton, I trust you will
be very happy. And I congratulate the
young man with all my heart."
"Miss Ashton, we have been going over
the results of that last trip you made.
They are remarkable for a woman. And
we have decided to make you superin
tendent of the Troy offices,"
He paused for an expression of sur
prlse or appreciation. Miss Ashton was
studying the carpet. The great man
coughed.

glasses and looked at her above them
called her Into his private office. She had
only been In that office twice before, and
they had been red-letter events In her
business career.
"Yes, pneumoniaâ awful sudden, too.
None of her folks were here. They live uq
State somewhere, and the undertaker

Margaret sat staring at the even flame

The life had died out of the great city
and the clock struck 2 when Margaret
Ashton laid down her pen. She bent low
to kiss ' the letter as she sealed It, and
again there came to her the vision of the

flagged pathway to the church.
"Died!"
"Is Miss Harding In this evening? If
she Is J wish you would ask her to come
In and have a cup of tea with me."
Miss Harding had the room at the end
of the hall.
The maid paused In the doorway and
looked In In startled fashion.
"Why, didn't you know? Miss Harding
died while you were gone."
The maid returned with a package

ry=?__ CENTER, Aug. 20.â I was talkin' to Judge
HV&l^j^flipflB Miller thc other day about the bond strengthenin' bizness
triats Boin' Â° n Â» a Â»d him and me came to the conclusion
that * ts a goO( * th ' ng t0 cncurr Â»dgc.
"The only way th3t civilization can ever accomplish her
npKAcWi$A*Â£ill hyperbolical purpose and take her placets the grand cir
, iiHijI"^riwÂ»&rÂ»c|) cumlocutory luminant in the pharmacopoeia of human af
fairs," said the Judge, "is by the strengthenin' of bonds. I
honor, the German Emperor for what he has done in this line, for who
knows what would of happened over that Venezuelan bizness if the bonds
hadn't been good and strong at the time. That case shows how handy
strengthening bonds come in once in a while in times of need. I see Will
iam is going to send his brother and his boy over here again next summer to
strengthen the bonds some more. I s'pose he has a sneakin' notion of
sendin' a fleet of his warships to South America again before lone.
"King Edward's in the bond strengthenin' bizness, too. Look at the
way England and France are makin' it pleasant for each other lately. Each
side wants to grab off a few more chunks of Africa before the other can get
it and they sec what a good thing it'll be to have thc bonds as strong as pos
sible so as to prevent hard feelin's.
"Nobody has started in to strengthen any bonds with King Pete of Ser
via yet, because he doesn't -seem to have a string attached to anything that
the rest of them want, and if he had they might think it was cheaper to just
go and take jt without runnin' up any wine bills. That's one disadvantage
of not havin' a large votin' population. In the categorical and protoplas
mic exegesis of human activity when you think of doin' something that a
bigger man than you may not like it is always well to make him believe
you re doin' it in a friendly spirit.
"This bond strcngthenin' dodge reminds me of a case that come before
me once when I was Justice of the Peace down in Adams country. A man
named Baker wanted to buy a farm and had the cash ready to pay for it.
Lon Richards and Ed Robinson both had farms that Baker liked and he
didn't hardly know which one suited him best. While he was tryin' to make
up his mind about it Robinson went to Richards and told him neither one
of them ought to think of sellin' out for less than $50 an acre. Richards
said he'd be willin' to sell for forty-five.
" 'Don't you do it,' says Robinson. 'Your old father would turn over in
his grave if he knew you let this place go for that price. Stick to fifty.
This man do,n't want my farm and I dunno as I care to sell anyway, so all
you have to do to get your price is to make him believe when he comes
around again that you've given up the idea of lettin' the farm go. Human
nature's a que,er thing. The minute a man gets to thinkin' he can't have
somethinghe didn't want very much before he's crazy to get it. Of course
it's nothin' to me, but we've always been friends and I want you to have all
you can get. There's some people I wouldn't put myself out to help along
on in the world, but blood's thicker than water, so there's a bond of rela
tionship between us that ouzht to^make us kind of stand together/
"Richards thought it was blamed kind of the other fellow to come to
him honest like that, and he made Robinson stay to dinner and they killed
a chicken and talked about human nature and almost felt like brothers. The
next day the man that wanted the farm com? to see Richards and offered
him forty-five dollars an acre for his place.
" 'Nope,' says Lon. 'I don't believe I care to *ell. You see my old
daddy cleared most of this land with his own hands and I'm kind of at
tached to it, so I wouldn't take less than fifty anyway/
"That afternoon Robinson sold out for forty-five an acre and Richards
was so mad when he heard about it that he went over and called Ed out in
the road and licked him so" he could hardly get out of bed for a week.
When the case came up before me I asked Robinson why he done it and he
said: â¢
" 'Why, j'ou see there's a famibly ,tie between us and he seemed so
friendly and kind of grateful because I /had thought of his poor old dead
father's feelin's that I didn't s'pose he'd care. But some people are so
blamed selfish that they foreit all about the sacred bonds of friendship when
ever they have a chance to makFa little money.'
"I wouldn't be surprised." says the Judge, "if it was a eood deal that
way with some of these Emperors and Kings that are busy strengthenin' the
bonds. The ties that bind'll snap mighty sudden that minute one of 'em
sees that one of the rest is cettin' the best of it in a real estate deal some
where, and it ain't always safe to bet too heavy on human nature, be
cause thc bluffs that work are the only ones we ever hear much about."
The more I think about the bond strengthenin' question the more I
can't help believin' the Tudee is rieht. 1 "
Us white folks get Booker Washington up from the South and tell him
how v.e love the negro and arc coin' to help him rise in the world, and the
next day, feelin* that the bonds are good and strong, we chase a few black
men into a corner and elevate them with ropes. We are all God's children.
Let us remember that, and the man who forgets to hold on to his pocket
book when some other chao comes along tellin' him thcy are brothers, made
from the same clay and bound for the same goal, may have, to/ borrow
money to get home.
George Prentice went into bizness up to the city and done well. too. I
guess he's got a million or so to-day. After a while Jim trot promoted and
he went up to the city. too. and the first tiling we knew they'd made him
general passenger agent. One daj- George Prentice came into Tim's office
and told him how glad he was to see that his talents had got recognized.
"I always knew." said George, "that you'd get there, and it seems to
me that we ought to keep up the old ties. . There's no friend like .the old
friends, you know, and us comin' from the same town, we ought to kind of
stand together. Say. I like to eo back to see the folks every little while,
and VOU couldn't fix me out with a nass rniilH vnti?"
Y==? _ ._*t^rd O R some reason people who go out into the fields at this
j. scason of thc vcar to P ick berries often have r a singular ex
*H^vJr*J pcriencc - As they S Iean from bushes right about them
tliey catch sicllt of othcr bushes a little distance away and
USr^sH a suddcnly thcy bccom c aware of the fact that thc berries with-
W=BS8c> in RraS Â° are sma11 and few while over beyond thcr = ap-
J^iitMMiL^cgj pears to be an abundance of large and luscious fruit. So
off they go in a hurry, scrambling over the fence, perhaps,
barking their shins maybe, but eager to enter the land flowing with milk
and honey. But when they arrive^ â oh, what a disappointment. Not a bit
bigger are the berries, not a bit more plentiful. It is the same old story of
a good many leaves and brambles and here and there only a prize worth put
ting into the basket. And vet for an entire afternoon a person will experi
ment in this fashion until he has roamed the pasture through and come back
to the place whence he set out. a considerably wiser and perhaps a trifle
sadder man for his repeated disappointments. (
This experience in the berry patch is typical of a bij* section of human
life. We do not always realize when we are well off. We take up our abode
at a summer resort and before .we have been there a day we are restless to be
up and away. We think that.we shall find a better table at the next water
ing place. " Well, the table may possibly be better, but the flies may be more
numerous and pestiferous. The point is that we are looking at all the ad
vantages of the place where we are through the small end of the telescope
and all the attractions of the place where we think we would like to be
through the large end.
Mothers there are who lose all the satisfaction to be had day bv dav

aspiring mother to herself, "how free I shall be from the strain of this con!
ant care as they hang upon my skirts all day long and how proud I shall
be of their successes." Poor woman I How little she realizes that bv ami
by she may look back to these days when she is all and all to her little ones

Oneway recently I met a minister who I happened to know was ex

church which he has served for over ten years. "You are all over V nÂ»r r, -t

Have something to say.
Beginning before you know what you want to say and keepine on after
you have said it lands a merchant in a lawsuit or a poor,house, and the first
is a short cut to the second. I maintain a legal department here, and it
costs a lot of money, but it's to keep me from going .to law.
It's all right when you are calling on a girl or talking with friends after
dinner to run a conversation like a Sunday-school -excursion, with stops .to
pick flowers; but 'in the office your sentences should be^the shortest dis
tance possible between periods. Cut out the introduction and the perora

and thought that you won't have a very wide margin left for golfâ especially
in the afternoons. I simply mention this in passing because I see in the Chi

the links one afternoon a fortnight a*o. Golfs a nice, foolish game and
there am t any harm in it so far as I know except for , the ballsâ the stiff
balls at the beginning, the lost balls in the middle and the highballs at the
end of the game. But a young fellow who wants to be- a boss butcher
hasn it much daylight to waste on any kind of links except sausage links.
Of course a man should have a certain amount of play, just as a boy is
entitled to a piece of pie at the end of his dinner, but he don't want to make
a meal of it. Any one who lets sinkers take the place of bread and meat
gets bilious pretty young; and these fellows who haven't ,any job. except to
blow the old man s dollars, are a good deal like the little niggers in the pie

the rest of you on the score of kinship in California ups and downs in
the search of fortune. â¢ J . _ ,.
If I were to tell some of my experiences you would recognize Cali
fornia blood in me, I fancy. The old, old story would sound fami liar, : no
doubt. I have the usual stock of reminiscences. For. instance, I went
to Esmeralda early. V â¢ â;. j â?!,...
I purchased largely in the Wide West, the Winnemucca and other
fine claims and was very wealthy. I fared sumptuously on bread when
flour was $200 a barrel and had beans every day when none but bloated
aristocrats could afford such grandeur. But I finished by feeding bat
teries to a quartz mill at $15 a week and wishing I was a battery myse t
and had somebody to feed me. My claims in Esmeralda arc there yet.
I suppose I could be persuaded to sell. I went to the Humboldt dis
trict when it was new. I became largely interested in the Alba Neuva
and other claims with gorgeous names, and was rich againâ in prospect.
I owned a vast mining property there. I would not have sod out for
lesi than $400,000 at that timeâ but I will now. finally I walked home
=00 milesâ partly for exercise and partly because stage fares
were expensive. _. '
Next I entered upon an affluent career in \ irginia City. And by a
judicious investment of labor and the capital of friends became the owner
of about all the worthless wildcat mines there were in that part of the
country. _,
Assessments did the business for me there. There were 117 assess
ments to one dividend and the proportion of "income to outlay was a
little against me. My financial thermometer went down to 32 degrees
Fahrenheit and the subscriber was frozen out. I took up extensions on the
mainland-extensions that reached to British America in one direction
and to the Isthmus of Panama in the otherâ and I verily believe I would
have been a rich man if I ever found those infernal extensions. But I
didn't. I ran tunnels till I tapped the Arctic Ocean, and 1 sunk shafts
till I broke through the roof of perdition, but those extensions turned up
missing every time.
I am willing to sell all that property and throw in the improvements.
Perhaps you remember the celebrated North Ophir? I bought that mine.
It was very rich in pure silver. You could take it out in lumps as big as
a filbert. But when it was discovered that those lumps were melted half
dollars, and hardly melted at that, a painful Ase of "saltin 1 " was appar
ent, and the undersigned adjourned to the poorhousc again.
I paid assessments on Hale & Norcross till they sold me out, and I had
to take in washing for a livingâ and the next month that infamous stock
went up to $7000 a foot. I own millions and millions of feet of affluent
silver leads in Nevadaâ in fact, I own the entire undercrust of that coun
try nearly, and if Congress would move that State off my property so
that I could get at it, I would be wealthy yet. But no, there the squats
-and here am I. Failing health pett^es me to sell. If you. know. ot
any one desiring a permanent investment I can furnish him one that will
have the virtue of being eternal. m Â¦ / Â¦
I have been through the California mill, with all its dips, spurs and
angles, variations and sinuositites." I have worked there at all -the dif
ferent trades and professions known to the catalogue. I have been
everything from a newspaper editor down to a cowcatcher on a locomo
tive, and I am encouraged to believe that if there had been more occu
pations to experiment on I might have made a dazzling success at last
and found out what mysterious design Providence had in view in crcat
& Bui you perceive that, although I am not a pioneer. I have had a
sufficientfy variegated time of it to enable me to talk pioneer like a na
tive, and I feel like a Forty-Niner. Therefore, I cofdially welcome you
to your old remembered homes and your long deserted firesides, and
close this screed with the sincere hope that your visit here will be a
happy one, and unembittered by the sorrowful surprises that absence and
lapse of years are wont to prepare for wanderers: surprises which would
come in the form of old friends missed from their places; silence where
familiar voices should be; the young grown old; change and decay
everywhere; home a delusion and disappointment; strangers at the
hearthstone; sorrow where gladness was; tears for laughter; the melan
choly pomp of death where the grace of life had been.
With all good wishes for the Returned Prodigals and regrets that I

A buzz rose from the crowd, and they
were ail on tiptoe again, trying to catch
a glimpse of this reckless buyer. Being a
tall man. Dodds could see over the others,
and there at the side of Holloway he saw
the masterful nose and aristocratic beard
of the eecond stranger In the coffee-room!.
A sudden personal interest added Itself to
the scene. He felt that he was on the
verge of somethingâ something dimly

count. The two men' with strange names,
the' telegrams, the horsesâ what was un
derlying it all?
The salesman was all animation again,

"Then I wish you joy of your bargain,"
said Holloway: "I don't buy at. that
price, but I should be glad to sell you

, Mr. Strellenhaus took no notice of the
irony. He was still looking critically at
the horses. The salesman glanced round
him in a perfunctory way.--
Holloway grew angry at this persistent
opposition. His red face flushed redder

"Thirty-three!" he shouted. ...
"Thirty-four.", said Strellenhaus.

It was London against. Liverpool, and
it was the head of the trade, against an
outsider.:-'' Still, the one man had Increased
his bids by .fives and the other only by
tapping his -teeth reflectively with his
pencil as he eyed the horses.
The talesman had mounted upon a
chair, and his keÂ»n. clean-shaved tace
overlooked the crowd. Mr. Jack Flynn's
gray whiskers were at his elbow and Mr.
Holloway immediately in front. _J.
"You've Been these hordes. jjariTiemen,"
said the salesman with a backward sweep
of his hand toward the line of tossing
heads and streaming manes. "When you
know that they are bred by Mr. Jack
Flynn, :,at his place in Kildare, you will
have a guarantee of their quality. They
are the best that Ireland can produce,
and In this class of horses the best that
Ireland can produce are the best In the
world, as every riding man knows jfell.
Hunters or carriage horses, a I 1 warranted
sound, and bred from the best stock.
There are seventy in Mr. Jack Flynn's
string, and he bids me say that if any
wholesale dealer would make one bid for
the whole lot, to save time, he would
have the preference over any purchaser."
There was a pause and a whisper
from the' crowd In front, with some ex
pressions of discontent. By a single sweep
all the small dealers had been put out
of it. It was only 'a long turse which
could buy on such a scale as that. The
salesman looked round him inquiringly.
"Come, Mr. Holloway," said heat last.
"You didn't come over here for ihe sake
of the scenery. You may travel the coun
try and not see such another string of
horses. Give us a starting bid."
The great dealer was still rattling hia
pencij upon his front teeth.
"Well," said he, at last, "they are a fine
lot of horses, and I won't deny it. They
do you credit, Mr. Flynn, lain sure. All
the same, I didn't' mean to fill a ship at
a single bid In this fashion. I like to pick
and choose my horses."
"In. that case Mr. Flynn Is quite pre
pared to sell them In smaller lots." said
the salesman. "It was rather for the
convenience of a wholesale customer that
he was prepared to put them all up., to
gether. But if no gentleman wishtJ -to
bid-r-r"
"Walt a minute," said a voice. "They
are very fine horses, these, and â¢ I 'will
give you a bid to start you. I will give
you twenty pounds each for the string of
seventy."
There was a rustle as the crowd all
swayed their heads, to catch a glimpse
It is not to buy young horses, however,
that the great dealers come to Ireland,
and thÂ« real business of the fair com
menced when the four and five year olds
were reachedâ the full grown, perfect
horses at their prime and ready for any
work or any fatigue. Seventy magnifi
cent creatures had been brought down by
a single breeder, a comfortable-looking,
keen-eyed, ruddy-cheeked gentleman who
stood beside the salesman and whispered
cautions and precepts into his ear.
"That's Flynn of Kildare," said Dodds'
informant. "Jack Flynn has brought
down that string of horses, and the other
large string over yonder belongs to Tom
Flynn, his brother. The two of them to
gether are tbt two first breeders in Ire
land.", '
A crowd had gathered in front of the
horses. By common consent a place had
been made for Mr. Holloway, and Dodds
could catch a glimpse of his florid face
and yellow covert coat In the front rank.'
He had opened his note book and was
"Why, that's Jim Holloway; the great
Jim Holloway," Bald he; then, seeing by
the blank look upon Dodds' Â»face. that
even this information had not helped him
much, he went into details. "Sure he's
the head of Holloway & Morland of Lon
don," said he. "He's the buying partner,
and he buys cheap, and the other stays at
home and pells, and he sells dear. He
owns more horses than any man in the
world and asks . the best money for
them."
When breakfast was over he sauntered
out into the market square, where Â«he
horse sale was already in prosrres-s. The
yearlings were being Fold first. They
were largely of thoroughbred blood and
were being bought by English dealers,
who would invest a few pounds now on
what they might sell for 50 guineas In a
year if all went will. One man with a
ruddy fare and a yellow overcoat took
them by the dozen with as much sansr
frold as if they had been, oranges, enter
ing each bargain In a bloated note book.
He bought forty or fifty during the time
that Dodds was watching him.
"Who is that?" he asked his neighbor,
whose spurs and gaiters showed that he
wsf likely to know.
The man stared In astonishment at the
stranger's ignorance.
man who received it. One turned pale.
The other sprang excitedly to his feet. It
might be a coincidence, but It was a very
curious one. If it was not a coincidence,
then what could it mfan? He puzzled and
puzzled, but could find no satisfactory
solution to the problem. All breakfast he
was turning it over in his mind.
As he opened the telegram Dodds could
perceive that it was as bulky as the first
cne. He observed, also, from the delay
In reading it, that It was also in some
sort of ciDher. The gentleman did not
write down any translation of it, but he
eat for eome time with his nervous, thin
fingers twitching among the hairs of his
white be&rd, and his shaggy brows bent
In the deepest and most absorbed atten
tion while he mastered the mcrnlng of it.
Then he sprang suddenly to bis feet, bis
eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed and in
bis excitement he crumpled the message
up In els band. With an effort he.mas
tered his emotion, put the paper into his
pocket end walked out of the room.
This was enough to excite a less astute

Dodds" eyes had already fallen upon
this man. and he had wondered vaguely
what he was doing In such company. Ha
rm a tall, white haired, eagle nosed gen
tleman, with a waxed mustache and a
carefully pointed beardâ an aristocratic
type which setmed out of its element
among the rough, hearty, noisy dealers
who surrounded him.
"Looks like it." Dodds answered; and
at that moment his thoughts were sud
denly drawn off into another direction.
The boots had entered the room with
a telegram in his hand.
"Where's Mr. Mancune?" said he to the
waiter.
"Well, there are some quare names
about. What was It you said?"
"Mr. Mancune," said the boots, glanc
ing round him. "Ah. there he is!" and
he handed the telegram to a gentleman
who was sitting reading the paper in a
"No, I don't know," sa'.d he. "I never
heard It before. It's a foreign name.
Perhaps if you were "
But at :hst moment a little round-faced,
ruddy-chirked gentleman, who was
breakfasting at the next table, leaned
forward end Interrupted him.
"Did you fay a foreign name, sir?" said
he.
"Strellenhaup is the name."
"I am Mr. Strellenhausâ Mr. Julius
Etrelier.haus of Liverpool. I was expect
ing a t^l^rem. Thank you very much."
He rat so r.ear that Dodds. without any
wish to play the ppy. could not help to
eome extent overlooking him as he
opened the envelope. The m^fsacre wai
e very long one. Mr. Stre!!enhaus ar
ranged the sheet* methodically upon the
tablecloth in front of him *o that no eye
but tils own could Fee them. Then 'he took
cut a notebook and with an anxious face
he began to make entries In It, glancing
first at the telegram Â»r.d then at the book
end writing apparently one letter or
f.g'ure at a time. Dodds was interested,
for he knew exactly what the man was
doing. He was working out a cipher.
Dodds had often done It himself. And
then suddenly the little man turned very
pale, as If the fu'l purport of the mes
sage had been a shock to him. Dodds
had done that also, and his sympathies
were all with his neighbor. Then the
stranger rose, and, leaving his breakfast
untasted, hÂ« walked out of thÂ« room.
"I'm thinking that the gintleman has
he* bad news, sorr," said the confidential
waiter.
THE 15th of July, 1ET0. found John
YTorllr.gton Dodds a ruined game
eter of the Stock Exchange. Upon
the 17th he was a very opu'.ent man.
And yet he had effected the change
without leaving the penurious little Irish
townlet cf Dunsloe, which could have
been bought outright for a quarter of the
sum -which he had earned during the sln
rle day that he wu within Its wails.
John Worllr.srton Dodds had many of
thÂ» gifts which lead a speculator to suc
c*m. He tu culck In observing, Just in
â¢ttlxsatlng, prompt and fearleis In act-
Ing. But In financ* there Is always the
element of luck, which, however one may
eliminate it, still remains, like the hlank
at roulettr. a constantly present handicap
upon the operator. And so it was that
Worllngton Dodds had come to prief.
Everything which he had touched had
gone wrong; and now, on the eve of his
marriapa. young, clear-headed and ener
getic, he was actually a bankrupt had his
creditors chosen to make him one. But
the Stock Exchange is an indulgent body.
What is the case of one to-day may ba
that of another to-morrow, and every one
is Interested in seeing that the stricken
man is given time to rise again. So the
burden of \Vorllngton Dodds was light
ened for him. many shoulders he'.ped to
bear 'It. and he wae able to go for a little
summer tour into Ireland, for the dor-tors
had ordered him reÂ«=t and change of air
to restore his shaken nervous eystem.
Thus it was that upon the 15th of July,
1STO. 'he found himself at his breakfast in
the fly-blown coffee-room of the G'-orge
Hotel, in the market square of D'Jnsloe.
It is a dull and depressing coffee-room,
but on this particular day it whs "as
crowded and noisy U that of any London
Hotel. Heavily booted men clattered in
ar,d out. spurs Jingled, riding crops were
stacked In corners and there was a gen
eral atmosphere of horse. From every

fjDodds. Was there any connection be
rjtweex) these two ' messages, or ' was It
''merely a coincidence? Two men with
strange names received two telegrams
within a few minutes of each other, each
.of a considerable length, each In cipher,
and each causing keen emotion to the
"By Jove!" cried Warner. "Old Dodds
was riKht after all."
And then suddenly he saw a newspaper
boy fasten a poster unon a lamp post, and
a little crowd had gathered around it in
an instant. One of them waved hia hat
in the air: another ahouted to a friend
across the street. Warner hurried op and
caught a glimpse of the poster between
two craning heads:
"FRANCE DECLARES WAR ON GERÂ«
' >iANT!"
Mr. Warner, who was the ' partner of
Mr. Worllngton Dodds. and who was suf
fering from the same eclipse, had gone
down to the Stock Exchange, but had
found little consolation there, for thÂ« Eu
ropean system was in a ferment, and ru
mors of peace and of war were succeed
ing each other with such rapidity and
assurance that It was Impossible to know
which to trust. It was obvious that a
fortune lay either way, for every rumor
set the funds fluctuating; but without spe
cial information it was Impossible to act.
He returned to his office in the afternoon,
half inclined to back the chances of peace,
for of all war scares not one In ten comes
to pass. As he entered the office a tele
gram lay upon the table. It was from
Dunsloe. a place of which he had never
heard and was signed by his absent part
ner. The message was in cipher, but hÂ»
soon translated It, for it was short and
crisp. ' - /;'-
"I am a bear of everything German and
French. Sell, sell. sell, keep oa selling."
For a moment Warner hesitated. What
could Worllngton Dodds know at Dunsloo
which was not known in Tbrogaaorton
street? But he remembered the quick
ness and decision of his partner. If hÂ»
was to act at all he must act at once;
so, hardening his heart, he went down
to the house, and, dealing upon that cu
rious system by Â¦which a man can sell
what he has not got and what he could
r.ot pay for if he had it, he disposed of
heavy parcels of French and German se
curities. He had caught the market In
one of its little spasms of hope, and therÂ»
was no lack of buying until his own per
sistent selling caused others to follow his
lead and so brought about a reaction.
When. Warner returned to his oSces It
took some hours to work out his accounts,
and he emerged into the streets in thÂ«
evening with the atsolute certainty that
the next settllns day would leave him
either hopelessly bankrupt or exceedingly
prosperous. .
It all depended upon Worllngton Dodd â¢
Information. What could he possibly have
found out at Dunsloe?
So, with a bow they separated. Mr.
Strellenhaus walked down to the tele
graph office, where his message was de
layed because Mr. "Worlington Dddds was
already at the end of the wires, for, after
dim guesses and vague conjecture, he had
suddenly caught a clear view of this com
ing event, which had cast so curious, a
shadow before It In this little "Irish town.

g 1 a nces crossed
like swordblades. "It Is possible that I
may see the horses again." , . . '
"I hope so," said Mr. Mancune, and his
white, waxed mustache gave a feline up
ward bristle.
"Quite so! Mr. Flynn suggests, gentle
men, that as you are both largo buyers.
It would, perhaps, bo a convenience to
you if he was to add the stiinz of Mr.
Tom Flynn. which consists of seventy
animals of precisely the urns quality,

"No, sir."
"And you, Mr. Strellenhaus?**
"I should prefer It." < â¢
â¢â¢Very handsome! Very handsome. In

the sal e a m a n.
"Then I under

"Yes sir."
A font* brtath
went up from the
crowd. Seven thou

one deal. It was
a record for Dur.s

"Any advance,
Mr. Strellenhaus?"
"Fifty-one."
"Fifty-six."
"Sixty."

to oee such" a" spirited competition. The

Mancune. The word lies with you. Mr.
Btrellenhaus."
Mr. Jack Fly an whispered â¢omsthin*
to the salesman.
"As a mere matter of business, jsntle
men," said the salesman, "It Is usual la
such cases to put down a small deposit as
a guarantee of bona fides. You will un

not bad the pleasure of dolns; business

"How much?" asked Strellenhaus,
briefly.

"Here Is a note for a thousand pounds."

But the former was as doend Â«â¢ vrar.

The Flower as a Peacemaker.
The chrysanthemum, besides being an
international flower, has acted as a peace
maker. Once upon a time there was a
Fiory told that the Czarina was not
friend'.y wltt the Queen of Italy: that
early in their career both were trying fur
the Czar, ard when Alix of Hrfcse won
Helen* of Montenegro returned to her
mountain home In a huff. It was gossip,
all gossip, but gossip Is powerful.
So the Czarina, when *he heard this. bi<1
ed her time; and when ..to far-off Italy
there came a daughter isbe ordered larreat
beds of the g-audy chrysanthemums lifted
bodily and transported to Italy, ther* to
bloom in the royal' hothouses. At that
time there were no chrysanthemums in
Italy and the sight of the flower from her
cold northern home was most gratifying
to Italy's young Queen.
But chrysanthemums.. If they/can' do
good, can also work harmâ ng a young
American girl found out. This young
American traveler, walking by-permission
in the royal grounds at Potsdam, -saw
growing along one of the walks a beauti
ful white flower which she recognlxed as
a chrysanthemum. In fact, the walk was
bordered with the flowers, not large ones/
but of medium size, of the sort that grew
at home by ' the side of the young wo
man's garden wall.
Thinking that this would make a pret
ty souvenir of her visit to the .palace
grounds, ehe stooped and picked the flowat
dees not care for them because they are
too vivid. "They take away the color of
my eyes." she declares. :
King Alfonso has Just had a bed of
chrysanthemums set out * in eoa - ef tho
royal greenhouses. The Spanish conser
vatory is not very large, for the outdoor
blooms are so. superb. , But the Kins, who
likes to own a complete assortment of bo
tanical specimens, has ordered the gar

color In the . greenhouse.

"Boots?" I: asked as I looked at a pair

I don't wonder Mrs. Belasco thinks it is
a task to buy clothes and the thousand

especially as her two lively girls have
everything new long before others have
even seen them, and when their elaborate
costumes mean a trip across the ocean
it is quite evident that, it consumes some
little time and not a few pennies.
Princesse gowns have returned at the
beck and call of Dame Fashion and for
slender people, something that has never
been quite, a howling success before. They
have always been considered stunning for
a Venus-like girl, but, unfortunately, only
about one out of ten girls possesses a fig

looking their best in It.

But their father needs to write an extra

supplied with pearls. . Pearls in
every imaginable mannerâ collars., ropea,
pins, rings and everything that has ever
been invented In the Jewelry line, but no
gem other than the pearl will answer
their purposes. Miss Reyna wears a rope
of baroques that would be the delight of
any girl. Every pearl would shame a
good sized pea, and as there are but three
links of sold between each one it makes
an almost solid pearl chain considerably
over two yards in length. In the most
nonchalant manner she twists it about
her throat and lets it drop as it will, and
even then it is too long. Just at pres

Earrings evidently must be the style
for girls, although so far we haven't seen
them here.! Both the girls wear immense
pearls, too large to be comfortable, I
thought, but it developed that they were
a" new crinkle, and a clever one 'at that.
The pearl is held in place as any other
screw earrings might be, but Instead of
being in two parts and piercing the ear
It is fashioned ini one piece. The ear is
slipped between the pearl and the gold
and the screw is tightened until it is*
snug enough to hold It in place. Much
larger stonea can be worn without any
discomfort ' and It does ; away with any.

THE LATEST
PARISIAN
GOWNS IN
SAN FRANCISCO
THE SUNDAY CALL.
10*^f GLIMPSE, a flashâ and then pres
f I toâ change! Such Is the way with
f""H the frills, the -furbelows and the
I conceits that are meant for noth
"* Ing else under the shining sun but
â¢ ,the adornment of. women, lovely women.
I j For what Is called midsummer, the pres
v Â«nt faahionn are but a revival of the past,
. but they are so thoroughly transformed
that no one but an expert would recog
nise them, and then there probably would
b* s> doubt as to whether or not they had
imHt been used. /
Borne four years ago the flowered mus
lins were all the vogue and they are most
extensively worn at the resorts this
lummer, the main difference being in
the cut, which is graceful, and the artis
tic trimming, which makes them into
charming frocks. For instance, the shirr
ing used to be perfectly round, somewhat
like barrel hoops slipped over tha arms
and then extended down as far as one
pleased. The style ..was all well enough
for very slender folks, but It was an
abomination for any /one with an ounce
too much of solidness. This year the
shirring is not done in that round and
round fashion, but follows the drooping
lines of the girdle, and the girlish girl is
never seen to better advantage than when
arrayed in all her light, fluffy, shirred
glory.
An important item is the care that is
bestowed on the details of .the silk or
lawn slip worn under all gowns, especial
ly the gauzy ones. It must be as soft
and pliable and as carefully cut as the
Cown itself, to give what is commonly
called by modistes inline -effects." And,
by the way, did you"know. that organdy,
perfectly cut "and daintily trimmed with
lace. Is one of the most popular linings
that can be had this year? Well, they are
and for several reasons. With ; a thin
frock, no matter what its purpose, the .
lining must be made with a train, and it
is inly a matter of several - wearings be
fore the delicate silk or lawn is soiled and
all the fresh beauty of the frock is lost.
* With a silk underlining the sweetness is
utterly irrevocably gone and it will cost,
a pretty penny 'to get a new one, more,
perhaps, than ; 4fce gown warrants, - but
with the organi^slip it is quite different.
All one has to do 1* to send it to the laun
dry and Io! and behold! it returns looking
quite as well as when it was new and
the expense is but a trifle.
So this winter when you. milady, are
selecting your dainty evening gowns, re
member that a princess style is by far
the most satisfactory, but remember, too,
if you make your own linings that they
are much more difficult to manage than
an ordinary skirt with a sleeveless and
low necked waist, for without the lines
that make the princess what they are
they are an utter failure. ' , Â¦
While the winter materials have chang
ed radically, that is the materials for
heavy outdoor suits, there is the same ,
lovely variety of sheer goods that will
serve again for evening frocks. Silk,
mousseline, chiffon, mull, organdy, ba
tiste, nainsook, net and point d' esprit are
by far the most popular on account of the
soft, clinging qualities, as they are easily
adapted to the present fashions. *
The day of crepe de chine and etamines
has passed and right sorry are the
majority of folks to see them relegated
to the dark shelves, for . nothing could
make a more stunning gown or be more
serviceable than these two materials. In
place of them has come the silk voile,
although it Is far too expensive for the
| average purse, and .the modest nun'e veil-
Ing, with a perfect legion of dotted and
beautifully embroidered batistes.
For the remainder' of the summer and
until late In the fall, taffeta in stripes
and checks will do duty for traveling and ,
shopping, and Just at present /there is
nothing quite so fashionable or seemingly
quite so suitable. In black and \ white,
blue and green, blue and black and brown
and white these silks are In constant de
mand and the simplest shirt-waist style
'j the beat liked, sometimes piped with a
eoJM color by way of trimming, but other
, wise perfectly plain sod absolutely com
fortable. /
While these little gowns all look more
or less jomewhat aUkp^they can be made
as varied as one fancies. There . are all
degrees of checks and strides, some small
and indistinct, while others are large and
very decided, but all are made of .the thin
taffetas, the foulards entirely going out
with the last season. Â¦> i
To our sorrow, the shirt /waist, really
seems to be going out. "Yet/ who fails to
remember when. one and all shouted at
the top of their voices, "No matter what
comes, I'll wear the shirt waist. It is by
far too^ comfortable to be discarded be
cause fashion dictates so." '
Well, fashion has said that the shirt
waist must go and going it most certainly
is. There are all sorts and conditions of
pretty bodices made of the same material
as the skirt is and for want of something
better they are called the "shirt" suits,
but the waist of varied colors to be worn
with one skirt is distinctly a thing of the
past. . .:.
To be smart the suit must be the same
color and Jt should be of the same
material.' Fortunately, such costumes are
swell and comfortable as well, atnd It may
be possible that they will last until the
supreme ruler, Mr. Frenchman, decides
that we may glory in colored shirts with
odd skirts again.
For street suits the shaggy, wooly
materials have come in with a rush and a
bang and right queer do they look, too,
in 'direct contrast with the smooth satin
finish that has delighted the hearts of
all dressmakers. And the plaids, great
squares and checks. Alm6st until you
can't, rest. And the viyld colors. * Just
the very" loudest and gayest that" could
possibly be combined. â¢
Of course, all the materials are noK
going to be checks. ..They could never
be adopted by â¢ the woman with too much
avoirdupois, no matter how smart they,
were, for, thanks be, there are still a' few
women who realize that fashions are not
always set for â¢ all folks and they /wisely
refrain from following blindly . a!nd , look
ing, as a consequence, like a fright â¢ and
receiving only the pity of their friends.
Flecked goods seem to be their salva
tion, and as they come in an endless va
riety and In every conceivable color the

proper thing to have a great plume, that
made your pocketbook feel ill for a week
after its 'purchase, softly laid over 1 tha
rim and gently framing the face. .It cer-.
talnly was vastly becoming and more than
pretty; but this fall the feathers are to!
be used in quite a different way. In the.
first place, such an immense. one Is really
not essential to one's happiness. Three
smaller onesâ not too' wee, thoughâ are to
stand straight up, as though about to de
clare their Independence. On account of
the flare brim they may be Eeen now and.
then, but It will only be when the head

the feathers will only serve to accentuate
the impertinence of the wearer. â¢'_.'"â¢
So, now, say if you can that this winter
will not create havoc with the hearts of
men.' The quaint old styles always have
been admired," but' not until right lately
have they j been evoked . with as much ao- -
curacy as at this present time.
, A calling or a reception frock will not
necessarily be made of heavy materialsâ.
In : fact, It .would, seem j tha,t . they .would
be far too heavy looking and, too warm
N for such purposes. The .voile is a.beautl
fuV weave coming in checks, plaids, stripes
and dotted, with a variety of novelties,
showing white hairs all over the surface.
A swell gown for the late autumn is a
pale coffee, a shade that has been worn
quite a little and that seems to be well
adapted to the. complexion of the average
woman. However,; just a word of warn
ing. Try all these shades well before buy
ing. Ifs there is the least suspicion of yelÂ».
low in your .skin it will bring out every
' bit of it and will give you a sallow, look
mat is anything but; pleasing.
â¢The w-ais.tr is. In simple cut, but very
elaborate as to, lace and embroidery, and
the three-flounced skirt, the upper flounce
deeper than the others* has' the hip yoke
formed of whip cordlngs, that. have been
so much admired but not much worn. On
the edge^of each flounce is a band of deep
ecru ; lace, and, if you please, a narrow
band of silk, say, in a deep red of* some
contrasting color, used somewhat in the
piping, fashion. Beneath this skirt a soft
lining of taffeta is worn, and it Is a pretty
idea to have it several shades lighter than
the material itself, for -it shows through
and lends quite another tone.
Girdles are quite a feature in the fin
ishing touches of gowns these days. "With
such a gown the soft satin in the exact
coffee shade should be worn. The front
is rather narrow and "deeply pleated so
as. to give breadth in the back. When
it is possible fasten the girdle to the
waist.for you will find nine times out of
ten that' it t will set much better and re
tain its 'shape much longer..
Pull it gently up ton the. Bides, grad
ually, of course, until it his reached the
height that you wish It to be in the
back and then gently tack it here and
there to hold it In place. Don't be afraid
of getting It too high. Six, seven or even
eight inches will finish it oft nicely.
To be Bure, it must be fastened in some
way, and there is no better or more eat- t
isfactory method than the great silk eyes.
It wasn't so very long ago that the ring
fancy work was all the , rage, so if you
will hunt diligently lyou may be able to
find a few that will answer the purpose.
They are' generally wooden or of com
mon wira and , are covered with a stout
buttonhole silk in Â¦ the regulation button
hole -fashion.- Fasten them on three
fourths of the way around firmly, but
be sure to leave enough space for a
heavy ribbon to lace through, for that is
the way all- the girdles fasten at pres
,enL Commence at the top and lace zig
zag downward until, the two ends of tha
satin come together, and then tie the ends
in a stiff bow with the short ends stick
ing, straight out In donkey ears. It is
a matter of choice as to whether the
streamers are long, or short. Some, think
that tne small stiff ends: are more chic,
while : - others f fancy j the ~ two ends short

What a day it Is for fandness in dress.
They may say what-: they please about
simplicity of outline and, absolute plain-'
ness as the keynote to ' elegance. But.
when you come to look at the gowns, you
will find that they are very far from
plain, and If there is any such' thing as
simplicity, it would take a very keen per
son to discover its whereabout a.
Dresses are trimmed to the last degree
and embroidered to the last notch. On
the fall gowns there Is lace used upon
everything, even to a gown of fine brown
serge which had a deep brown lace dec
orating it, and lace flounces as deep as
the knees are used upon some of the
autumn cloaks.
Those who think that the gowns of to
day are simple should study the lines of
the tailored dresses of flsjeen years ago
when sleeves were made exactly like
men's coat sleeves, when collars were
perfectly straight bands, and when the
dress skirt fitted like a glove, and when
the waist was a jersey waist without a
sign of trimming upon it.
It took an angel of a figure to wear
those plain clothes, and in this respect
the woman of to-day has the advantage
over her ancestress who wore a Jersey,
for the gowns that are now made are so
skillfully and so artistically treated that
defects of figure are hidden, and all
women look beautiful under the magic
touch of a yard of lace and : a chiffon
flounce with a little applique to bring out
the best points.
But the autumn girl looking for a pic
ture cloak will 1 scarcely go into ecru, but
she may seek out brown, for brown is

Mrs. Dcsew is scarcely an old man's

Is certainly the sweetheart of her hus

As the "summer girl's" fondness for
travel com*s next to her love of dress,
let us Journey back across the water
sgain. There we will find Margaret of
Connaught. who has been rumored en
gaged to the Crown Prince of Germany.
The picture on this page shows her as
a "summer sirl." Margaret is distin
guished In more ways than one. In ad
dition to being of royal blood she is the
most beautiful and the most highly ac
complished of any of the English Prin
cesses, and It Is said her marriage to the
Crown Prince would give general natis
factlon. and more especially would it
please the young man's mother. What
more could any "summer girl" want?
And nÂ«xt we have the picture of the
beautiful Mrs. Arthur Paget as she looks
since her recovery from her recent ill
ness. She Ij very slender and decidedly
youthful in spite of the fact that she
has Â» son In the King's Guards and a.
daughter in society.
And then there Isâ but doubtless that
it enough to show to what lengths the
love cf things beautiful will carry even
the most exalted. The pictures look sim
ple enough, don't they? Well, that is
precisely the effect that the "summer
girl" strives hardest to attain. It is the
simplicity of elaboration, if such a thing

All this would be remarkable enough
in Itself, but the real Burprise of the
hour Is the fact that the new "summer
girl" fad has been appropriated by some
of the most distinguished women In the

own. if you please. Just think of it! No
less than royalty and blue blooded aris
tocracy before the camera as victims of
the new picture craze for striking effects
In costume poses. Hark a while to the
reading of the list of distinguished "sum
mer girls."
First, let. us announce the Princess of
Wsks, whose picture appears above. The
Princess cf Wales Is one of the most dis
tinguished "summer girls" living. She
dresses In white to the end of the season,
for she loves to be a "summer girl." In

Mrs. Depew has probably more gowns
than any other American woman living,
for Mr. Deoew is a firm believer in the
gospel of fine dress and in the cure which
dress works upon the feminine mind. The

*Â£ <&- America's Wonderful Coal Mines
By far the most valuable of our min
eral products Is coal. , In this age 'of
steam and electricity, when cheap power
is the very life of a nation's industry,
coal is king. Professor John Tyndall said
that the seat of England's greatness was
her coal mines. Without them she could
never have become the mistress of the
world's manufactures; and without them
she could not remain the mistress of the
seas.
But Great Britain's coal 'lies 2000 feet
below the surface, and is mined In a tem
perature of 100 degrees or higher. There
are prophecies that the supply will be ex
hausted within fifty years, and it is stat-
ed that the mines of Germany and tBÂ«
Netherlands are still nearer exhaustion.
The coal supply of Europe Is distributed
as follows : x Russia has 27,000 square
miles, said to be of poor quality; Great
Britain, 9000; Germany, 3600; France,
1800;: Belgium, Spain and other countries,
1400. ' â¢
The United States has 194,000 squarÂ«
miles of coal measures, saya Success,
which Is' more than ! four times thÂ« are*/
of all the coal fields of Europe, twenty
one times the coal fields of Great Britain,
and 41 per cent of all the coal area* of
the world.
. Not less' than thirty of our States ' and
Territories are now producing coal for
the ; market In West Virginia, forty
eight counties out of fifty-four bava coal
deposits. Ohio has had at one time 215
large mines, besides 3S3 small ones, dis
tributed through thirty counties. Of the
twenty-four States and .Territories west
of the Mississippi, coal has been found in
every one save Minnesota,
In 1S70 Germany raised more coal than
we' and Great Britain nearly four times
as much. In 1830 we had passed - Ger
many, but Great Britain raised more than
two tons to our one.. In 1300 the United
States led the United Kingdom by 18,000.
000 tons, and produced more than twice as
much coal as ' Germany. Our product is
now- more than â¢ one-third of the world's
annual supply.

State of Kentucky famous for her horses,
Â«r.d the city of Lexington, the center of
the blue grass region, the well-bred
horse's home.
New Tork millionaires, when it was
demonstrated beyond the shadow of a
doubt that the racer born and bred in
the heart of the blue grass was superior
In all things to one reared in any other
Etate In Union, began turning their at
tention to the possibilities of that State,
tiEtll to-day around Lexington, as a
focus, there are grouped many of the
most famous stock farms In the world.
Among the first of the New Yorkers to
come here waa L. V. Harkness, who was
â¢oon followed by August Belmont. Others
who are grouped about the town, within a
radius of eight miles or more, are Fox
hall Keene. Peter Duryea. J. B. Haggin,
Colonel PfppeT, Berator Van Meter. Mr.
I/esher end the two Gibson brothers,
Howard ard Richard.
At first these men went to Kentucky
merely to establish breeding- places and
nurseries for promising colts, but some
how, as they repeatedly went down to see
how the horses were getting along, the
charming climate, landscape and customs
grew upon them and they built homes
near their training stables, and the homes
are beautiful. Mr. Harknpss bought the
eld Walnut Hall track and more in the
?ldnity. until he has a farm cf 2009 acres
â¢f rolling tneadew and woodland close to
l>exington.
It Is called Walnut Hall farm, after the
mansion house, a spacious colonial struc
ture bcilt by Victor Flournoy, a planter
of the early *3D*s and a descendant of the
Cavaliers, who owned several hundred
slaves and much property in the South.
Every door In the old house. It is Fa!d.
Is made from eolid walnut cut from the
adjacent woodlands, and the interior is
all of carved walnut. Even the floors are
of the eame material. After purchasing
the pl3ce Mr. Harkness spent thousands
cf dollars in modern Improvements, and
to-day it Is one of the most complete
stock farms of Lexington.
As an adjunct to their racing stable In
England James R. Keene and his son,
Foxhall K*ene. maintain a large breeding
stable in Kentucky, also near Lexington.
The place is called Castleman and here
Beeldea his stud farm Mr. Belmont still
maintains two training stables, one at
Babylon and the other on the South Car
olina training track. Recently four year
lings from his Kentucky farm were sent
to England to be trained for their entry
in the Derby and Oaks of 1905. "With them
he hopes to renew the success of the fam
ous old Bridegroom.
The old method of raising thor
oughbreds was primitiveâ that is to say,
nature and the blue grass had their way
largely, and the horses were sheltered at
night In primitive stables which served
well enough a generation ago. When Mr.
Belmont appeared on the scene he erected
some buildings. There were buildings for
stallions and buildings for mares and
buildings for young stock, with ail the
modern improvements. And the rest of
the horsemen, catching the merit of the
Idea, eagerly followed. On his Kentucky
farm lives the great stud Hastings, a
horse which is considered one of the lead
inc stallions in America, a reputation
which he holds owing to the winnings
this year of two of his children, Magis
trate and Gunfire.

Unlike all the rest, August Bclmont's
place Is not adorned with a magnificent
palatial residence, because that lover of
horses does not live on his breeding farm.
But what he loses in residence he makes
up In splendor of horse buildings and in
terior equipment. It requires revenues
arising from millions to defray the ex
penses of his stables, because he manages
them on such broad lines.

This palatial residence has Just been
finished and it is. one of the wonders of
the blue grass country. It cost some
thing like one million dollars.
Mr. Haggin is said to be the most ex
tensive breeder in the world, and he is a
rpmarkable man in the matter of produc
ing thoroughbreds. No other person In
any country is breeding horses on the
same scale. He offers for sale, it is said,
about one-twelfth of all the young horses
v.hich annually appear upon the turf.

For example, we are thrown off our bal

occur to-day, but which, in a week's time,
may have no significance whatever. Ob

we meet them, dwindle away to mole
hills when We get away from them.
Even what seemed tragedy at the mo

Most of us are so constituted that we
will make almost any sacrifice for pres
ent peace. It would seem easier to have
an arm or a leg amputated two years
hence than to lose a finger to-day! It
is human nature to shrink from pain, and
we purchase release at almost any cost:
If we could only train the mind to look
at to-day's trouble and annoyance from
the standpoint of the future it would bÂ«
much easier to bear.

ical, ahe baked fresh bread for the hos
pital, and it was said, "Mother Bicker
dyke could bake bread on horseback," as
she often carried the set sponge in this
way. baking it as soon as her portable
oven could be set up when camp waa
reached. /
At Memphis the milk and eggs were ao
bad that "Mother" Blckerdyke obtained a
furlough, hastened to Chicago, where ahe
made her wants known, and soon had 100
cows and 1000 hens, donated by the pa
triotic people of Illinois, whose Governor
had them shipped to Memphis.
General Hurlburt, commanding the de
partment, gave her an island opposite tha
city, where contrabands took charge of her
stock. Some of these cows traveled long
distances with the army and saved many
a soldier's Ufe.
Just at the dose of the war some of
her boys invited her to a review. Donning:
her sunbonnet, she was seated on an ele
vated seat and was amazed to see her old
cows file past, each with coats curried
until they shone, horns polished and hoofs
blackened and bright as patent leather.
No general ever enjoyed a review of his
troops more than did "Mother" Bicker
dyke, her "cows', review." She remained
in the service until March, 1866.

we can understand In this life regarding

of the next Ufa. In that Intense love we
sometimes say that we will meet again,
. even after death. You know that is a
amying that comes out of intense lore.
There can be no other higher reason than

uigner science, higher mathematics, ''al
though we took in the beginning some
thing for granted, yet afterward we find
that by that granting, by that simple
faith, we have not lost. So with faith of
religious, of spiritual things.
"In the theory of Vedanta there is no
death; and when we say that there is no
death we should say, if we are logicians,
that there Is no life. Life and death are
relative. Where there Is death, there Is
understood life. So Vedantists say there
is no death nor life. But they say you
have eternal lifeâ not Ufe as relative to
death; not life under limitations, under
conditions, but absolute life, eternal life,
and that life cannot have death. Noth
ing can burn roat life, nothing can bury
that life, nothing can finish. puKan end

infinite.
We say. for Instance, that a person con
sists of body, senses and the mind. Wa
do not speak of the ego and the ioulâ
they are high terms. We say, practically
and materially, body and mind and
Â¦enaes. Now, death comes over the body.
Death is material. Mind and senses be
ing abstract something, spiritual some
thingâIn its literal sense being Just like a
npirlt-^cannot end. as body ends, in death;
cannot have deathâ mind and senses. They
are abstract something. Abstract things
cannot die; only material things die. And
mind and senses being abstract, they*
transmigrate from the body to another.
All the senses and the mind. Mind Is the
ruler of the senses; and when they de
part, they go with some treasure. That
means some impression that we have ob
tained In this life. Boma philosophers will
explain that mind and senses are nothing
but a collection of those Impressions sim
ply; and those impressions transmigrate
and they go into another new body that
will act out its temperament. Its impres
sions. But all theories are simply general
or individual, in some respects. To me
some laws may be applicable; to others,
some other laws. So, If I do some great
things, some very high things. I may not
coma back to earth as a human penon.
but go to a higher plane, higher world,
such as heaven; or some planet, higher
planet than earth; or I may come to be
born again as a man; or I may go to a
lower animal kingdom. If we give rise to
some satvie qualities in ourselvesâ satvio
qualities, meaning; righteous, virtuous
thingsâ and if In that period wa die, we
will go to a higher plane. And if we die
while in our rahaa qualityâ rahas meaning
activity, active qualityâ then we may
come back again as men; and if we die
In tha state of tamas. or when the dark
qualities, the sinful things predominate,
then we go to lower animals.
There are many, several kinds of deaths
and from these kinds of death we may
gat glimpses to what kingdom, to what
region, tha departed soul may go. If
some persons die in bed, they have a good
chance; but dying at night, they have not
B o good a chance. And then some persons
who die during the northern solstice
then they go to the higher plane; and dur
ing the southern, to the lower, etc. It
has some reference to the time, also.
Owing to some Karma we may die In the
night, or unfavorable time; but owing' to
other Karma, which is higher, I may
supersede that law.
Tha idea of the absolute God In Ve
dantlsm is expressed in three little words
â Sat. Chit and Ananda. Bat means abso
lute existence; Chit means absolute Intel
ligence, and Ananda means absolute bliss.
Bo the absolute God means the absolute
existence of one blissful/ intelligence.
Everything on tha face of tha earth is es
sentially nothing but an absolute exist
ence. Apparently we see a variety of
things; essentially there is no variety, but
only unity in everything.
Vedantlsm teaches that as a matter of
fact we are divine, and not mortal. Mat
ter may be mortal In a limited sense, but
spirit can never be so. It Is always unlim
itedâthat Is to say. infiniteâ and absolute.
If we try to know the real essence and
the meaning of our existence by our splr.
ltual culture we can understand that we
are all eternal and ona. Our bodies may
parish, but our souls can never perish.
When such forms as body and the other
external things of this world cease to
exist as such, the eternal essence meets
us with tha all-pervading and ever-exist
ing substance. Vedantlsm says that

laws of nature; and when wa say we go
back to the absolute the higher sTi^nfWa
may say we are going to be Involved
again Into the same primary causa.

Nature L*a two phases of eharaotssv
one evolved nature and tha other In
volved. In a more scientiflo way, yoa wUl
understand If I call It evolution and la
volution; evolution, meaning expression,
and involution meaning destruction. Na
ture' by thÂ» ona phasa of charaatar ax
presses everything on tha fac* of tha
earth or in this universe. Owlnx to tha
existence of the laws of natur* w* hat*
come up from the lowest animal to tha
human nature. We have grown 09 by
means of tha law of nature, wnloa la
called the law of evolution. First, t&a
scientists will tell you, tha Ufa germ la ia
the form of a mineral, than a ragatabla,
then animal, then afterward. In tha form
of a man. It finds its highest expression
In man. Tha Ufa germ becomes very wall
expressed in man. You do not find in a
beast the kind affection, tha human Qual
ities. Why don't you find them la a
beast? Because tha germ Is not yet ax
pressed very well. It will afterward be
very well expressed when that Ufa gsrav
will coma to bo in tha form of a man, In
every man. even, it Is not very well ex
pressed. A man can be a beast in human
form. You will not find tha human qual
ification very weU expressed in that beast
ly man. When will It be expressed?
When that man becomes a little more
moral. You will find the very UfÂ» gana
which you previously found in a mineral,
in a vegetable, in a beast, moro fully ex
pressed in an ethical, moral Ufe germ.
In that moral man. even, you will not find
It fully expressed yet. When that moral
man will become spiritual, you will find
a little more expressed tha very Ufa germ
which you have previously found in tha
lowest form of beast. Now. in tha spir
itual man, even, it Is not found in Its
perfection. When that spiritual man rises
high above everything, every relative
idea; when that spiritual man become*
a god; when humanity Is transformed
into divinity Itself, then you will find that
germ in perfection. This is tha law of
nature, the law of evolution. This Is ona
phase of character in natur*.
There is another phase of character t*
be observed in nature. That is involu
tion, going backward; mm a seed grows tÂ«
a tree and again that tree becomes In
volved in the seed that Is produced by
that same tree. That seed is called thai
involution .of tha future tree, a tutor*
tree being involved tn that seed. Nov,
when a man becomes divlna. become*

then there is misery. The highest aim of
man and of every being is happiness. And
the real -happiness lies In the, realization
of one universal thins. In this way Ve
dantism teaches that every man, from
any position, can rise to godhead.
As a last word: Vedanta Is a system
that embraces, that Includes, all kinds of
thought, of sect, of religion, of philoso
phy, of anything and everything; all
kinds, whether they be materialistic or
spiritual. So the Vedantlsts say only, bÂ«
simply a little thoughtful. Think over
things, think over affairs; think ovsr
things that you see, that you d*
and that will lead you to your goal, ta
your salvation, by way of natural pro
cess. Be sincere and thoughtful. Do not
be deluded, do not bo Irrational. W* can
not see our eternal life before ns; wÂ«
The next higher theory is the theory of
thought, transmitting thought. When wÂ«
think, suppose we think of % somethina
very intensely that may happen, and
afterward we ilnd that does .happen^
and we come to understand that It Is nog
Ingâ nothing because.it was the produo*
tion of the body. When the tree dies : it
dies In every way, nothing remaining; and
bo when the body dies there is no life

3uie tiling in this sense. If we take
heaveti as a relative thing, then we may
*neaJÂ£ < f fjoh a place as hell. But if
l.^v^n is Fpcken of as eternal (as some
Ch'i.llnn^ sneak of lt>, then we cannot
give ris-e to such an expression as etrrnal
lieil. Whatever Is eternal is infinite.
Whatever is infinite cannot be but one.
And where there is no more than one.
there cannot exist relative things. If
there is the father, there must be the rel
ative- tilingâ the son; where there is birth,
there must be the relative thingâ death.
In this cense, where there is heaven
thete must be hell. But if heaven is
LternaJ and infinite, there cannot be an
other thir-g at the game time and the
sa.n:c place that is eternal and infinite.
And fn this tense we cannot have hell.
This :s ore ct the early Ideas we get from
the Vtdas.
The Vedas are divided into several po>
t'ons. The last and best portion is called
Vcdanta. I^ater on, a high philosophy or
iginated from the Vedanta, which is njw
known by the name of Vedantitm. In
Vcdantism everything Is a manifestation
i;i tome shape or other of this absolute
God. God Is a universal and all-pervad-
Ins essence. Eve i> thing In this wor'd is
j^t like a tcnipcrnry wave on the great
ocean vt that universal. all-pÂ£rvading
lead sooner or later to this tame place.
As a matter of fact, from a historical
point of view, ail religions that ;are
jÂ»reached by rÂ«Â»al prophets have emanated
from the samÂ» grand and essential reli
gion of the Vedas. If God be in every
thing, then man cannot be born a* sin
ner. In Vedantitm man is very near.. God
and in one singl*- life, by spiritual cul
ture, lie can realize practically that he
is nothing but a part of this universal In
telligence. And when -the individual soui
passes off from the body it mixts with
the one universal Intelligence. ~\ ,
There are several theories by which we
can understand that after death we Con
tinue to exist. | . â¢
The agnostics say that we have simple
physical connection with this world and
when our body, our physical organism,
ends all connection ends. Therefore, ac
cording to the agnostics, thsr^is no such
thins as a future life. - We should eat,
drink and be merry.
From that theory we get the next hlgh
tr theory, thÂ«i theory of the skeptics, or
rather, say the atheists. They say that
from body, from a certain accumulation
of certain things in a peculiar way, is
produced our consdoueness, and we get
our life. That is material production, and
when our body dies there remains hoth-

The Vedantlsts believe In one absolute
God; they believe In heaven and hell only
in their relative sense, and not' as â¢ ever

make themselves as tioly and happy as

The nautical sharps, who had already

concedes to Sir Thomas .Llpton's third
challenger on account of Reliance's larg

It was a royal water fight for the an

the cup series of 1903 occurred on the fif

boat three minutes . twenty-four seconds

The first work after breakfast to-day
was a tour of the grounds, through which
the desperadoes made their escape July
27. and much interesting information was
elicited from the Warden, Captain
"phy and the guards who accompanied the
party. It was demonstrated how the con
victs poured in on the prison officials and
how the majority of the felons were pre
vented from joining the escapes. The
directors passed around the building oc
cupied by the ofHcers and guards and
came to the gate leading to the armory.
"How did the convicts, get through
here?" asked Senator Felton.
"The guard unlocked the gate," wa3
the reply of the Warden.
The road at this point runs behind a
high wall of natural rock and the es
caping prisoners were out of range of
the guns in the hands of the men in the
After inquiring further into the conduct
of the guards the officials dispersed for
the night with the understanding that
the morning session should be early in
order to finish the work as soon as pos
sible.
The Warden stated that he was posi
tive that others than the escaped convic:s
were in the plot. "Kid" Thompson, Myer3
and Lavarone are thought to have been
partners in the conspiracy and their con
nection with the break will be invesilp
gated later.
It, was also reported that the employes
of the Folsom Light and Power Company
were entering the prison grounds and
shutting off the water when they thought
best, relying on the injunction secured
against the Board of Prison Directors
several months ago. All were agreed that
this state of affairs should not exist and
to-night the situation was discussed with
State Engineer Eckart. Some of the di
rectors want to sue the electric company
for a quarter million dollars damages and
have the case tested. ,:.Â».;Â¦
PLOTS STILL BEING rORMED.
The Warden opened his desk last night
and took out a box which contained ar
ticles discovered in the possession of pris
oners on Thursday night. There was a
miscellaneous assortment of knives and
stilettos, showing that plots were still be
ing formed.
Charles Montgomery of the Prison Re
form Commission was the next subject
of conversation and his ears should havo
burned well.
"I have been waiting to hear what you
gentlemen had to say about it," was the
answer.
"Are they still here?" asked Director
Wilklns. referring to guards last named.
"Yes," replied the Warden.
"Well, why in thunder don't you fire
them?" ejaculated Felton.
GUARDS TO BE DISMISSED.
Wilkinson stated that Guards Scott and
Edwards resigned immediately after the
outbreak and that Guards Klenzendorf
and Ryason had refused to do further
duty at the rock crusher.
Prison Directors Fitzgerald. Felton,
Wilkins and Ray arrived In town late last
night by special train from Sacramento
The remaining director, Robert Devlin, is
absent in Europe. The party went imme
diately to the penitentiary, where they
were welcomed by Warden Wilkinson.
After luncheon the directors assembled
In the "Warden's office and discussed the
situation In a general way for several
hours.
FOLSOM. Aug. 22.â That some of the
guards were cowardly and that four of
the convicts were of great service to the
btate on the morning of the outbreak,
July 27, were two of the most Important
facts established to-day by the investiga
tion of the Board of Prison Directors at
Folsom Prison. As a rasult of the inves
tigation Guards Klenzendorf, Ryason and
Chalmers and Prison Physician Plant are
slated for dismissal and convicts Joseph
Casey. O. C. Clark. John Martinez and
Charles Abbott will be recommended for
executive clemency. The directors are in
clined to think the responsibility for we
escape of the thirteen desperadoes rests
not so much with prison management as
with State legislatures which have failed
to allow appropriations making possible
the acquirement of facilities for restrain
ing dangerous felons. The result of the
investigation will be embodied in a re
port to Governor Pardee.

Lord Salisbury was the third Marquis
of that name and the second son of that
Marquis who held the privy seal in Lord
Derby's first Premiership' and was later
Lord President of the Council under the
same Premier. His mother was a Miss
Gascoigne, daughter and heir of a
wealthy gentleman, Bamber Gascoigne
Esq.
Lord Robert Cecil, as he was then
called, being the second son, had his first
schooling at Eton and then spent nearly
three years at Christ Church College, Ox
ford. Leaving there in his nineteenth
year, he made the tour of Europe and
then went to New Zealand. His father
was rather penurious and he knew that
he had his own way to make. He led the
life of a cattleman for some two years
and then went with the rush to the Aus
tralian gold fields. There he remained
for nearly three years, digging for gold,

He chose the field of journalism and
from 1S5" until 1SG5, when by the death
of his elder brother he became \iscount
Cranborne, he made his living as a writer
for the press. His essays, political, so
cial and economic, were features of the
Saturday Review and the Quarterly, and
his leaders found frequent place on ihe
editorial- pages of the. Morning Chronicle
and the Times.
A patrician by descent through many
generations, he was noted for his ultra
aristocratic views and extreme Tory prin
ciples and from these he never swerved
during his long career and was rarely if
ever. In eympathetic touch '.with the
masses of the people.
The young Lord did not confine his ef
forts and work to the floor of the House.
Of necessity it was otherwise, especially
after hi3 marriage In 1S57 to MIa'* Geor
giaa Alderson. She brought nim no
dowry, and his father, who was much of
fended at his choice, insisting that he
should have married an heiress, refused
to increase the meager allowance which
he had before made to him. This threw
the young man on his own resources and
forced him to supplement his small ln
.corne in some honorable and inconspicu
ous way.
Soon after hl3 election he was chosen
a fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford.
He made his debut before the House, and
the nation in a protest against a pro
posed measure for reforming the -great
university. His effort on this occasion
attracted much attention In the House
and outside as well and from that time
forward his support or opposition was
reckoned as a potent factor in the fate
of every bill of political or public nature,
especially those affecting the interests
of the established church.
His mining ventures were not over suc
cessful, however, and in 1&53 he returned
to England and was soon after elected
to Parliament- from' Stamford. <So well
did he please his constituents- that - they
returned him at every election until 1S6S,

In April, 1SS0, he went out of office with
his" party after defjeot; at the elec

held 'April 9, 1SS1, after the death of Lord
Beaconsfl>ld-, 'Lord "Salisbury was elected
to lead the party in the*House of Lords.

Ori June i}'5>fVthat year the .Gladstone

was Short, howover, only 227 days.
The ultimate result of this conference,
during which Lord Salisbury displayed
the vary highest grade diplomatic In
stinct, .was, no .reflection on the work done
by ..tha conference. The Grand Ottoman
Council, with, but one dissenting voice,
January 15, 1877. rejected the proposals of
the powers, and war followed soon after.
The situation became a -critical one for
Britain.. -Lord Derby resigned the. posi
tion of Secretary ,, of. State for Foreign
Affairs and Lofd Salisbury was appointed
to 'the' place! His lirst act was to write
the memorable dispatch clearly enunci
ating Great Britain's jfositlon with re

Plenipotentiary, at the conference of Con
stantinople. ._ * . Â¦ ...... : . .
Lord Salisbury was honored with visits
at Hatfleld House by the German Em
peror and the Prince of Naples in 1891,
Li Hung Chang in 1S96 and by her late
Majesty Queen Victoria In her jubilee
year, 1S97.
There are in England and elsewhere to
day many who place Lord Salisbury at
the very head of the roll of her great
statesmen, others who rank him among
the first and still others who contend that
he possessed but few elements of great
ness, and those only in a moderate de
gree, and* that he only appeared to be a
great man In comparison with the dwarf
ishness of those about him. Partiality or
partisanship can now hardly do him jus
tice on either hand.
Lord Salisbury was a great student,
especially of electricity and its applica
tions, an-' he maintained a well-appoint
ed experimental and working laboratory
at Hatflold House, in which he spent
much of his leisure time. The whole place
Is furnished with electric light and power,
generated by the River Lea, which runs
through his estate, for which all the de
vices and appliances used are of the most
modern character and of his own design-
Ing.
Lord Salisbury inherited large and valu
able properties (over 20,000 acres of land)
from his father, and added much thereto.
His oldest eon. Viscount Cranborne, suc
ceeds to the titles and estates.
Lord Salisbury bore many titles and
honors, some hereditary and others won
by his own efforts. On his return from
the Berlin conference in 1878 the Queen
conferred upon him the order of the Gar
ter, and he, with Beaconsfleld. was given
the freedom of the city of London, and
later (1S31) of Glasgow. In 1SG) he was
elected chancellor of the University' of
Oxford, to succeed Lord Derby. In 1871-72
he was one of the arbitrators in the great
investigation of the officers of the Lon
don, Chatham and Dover Railroad Com
pany. He was for a long time chairman
of the London and Northwestern Rail
road Company.
The Boxer outbreak in China in 1900 and
subsequent events in that quarter, the
final outcome of which is yet in abeyance,
added much to Lord Salisbury's cares
during the last years of his Ministry.
Then the death of her late Majesty the
Queen reminded him that his generation
was passing away. He would probably
have resigned long before he did but that
he was moved by a desire to bring the
Boer war to an honorable close before
leaving the helm of the ehip of estate.
His retirement, coming as It did when
Britain was full of rejoicing at the con
clusion of the war and engrossed with,
the preparation for King Edward's coro
nation, made less of a jar in the political
world than it would have done a year
before, for . instance. In fact, it had al
ready been discounted, and his successor,
his nephew, A. J. Balfour, practically
chosen. Labouchere- largely voiced the
sentiment of the British public when he
said that it was "a matter of absolute
indifference whether the uncle or the
nephew was at the head of the Govern
ment."
Salisbury Takes Rank With Greatest
of Britain's Statesmen.
RETIRES WITH HONORS.
Soon messages of condolence began
coming in, and the little telegraph office
at Hatfie'.d was swamped with unprece
dented business. The death of Lord Salis
bury occurred on the fiftieth anniversary
of hs entry into public life as a member
oi thÂ» House of Commons for Stamford.
Th* elevation of Lord Cranborne to the
Pu'sc oÂ£ Lords creates a vacancy in the
P.ochcster district and probably will en
tail the election of a new Under.Secre
tary for Foreign Affairs.
The end of the distinguished statesman
was a peaceful one, without the slightest
evidence of pain. When death became
imminent the attending physicians sum
moned the waiting members of the fam
ily, who gathered at the bedside and took
farewell of the dying man, who, how
ever, was unconscious of their presence. >
Within a few minutes after the death
a brief announcement was handed to the
newspaper men, and simultaneously tHe

The village -of Hatfleld. which still re

was A filled with anxious residents
awaiting the news of his Lordship's
demise. The. great Hatfleld House, hid

street corners uncovered In acknowledg

slightly toward his -favorite daughter.
Lady Gwendolin Cecil, who was kneeling
beside him, and then quietly breathed his
last.
.While this matter was in process of set
tlement affairs in the Far East assumed
an acute phase. Germany had forced the
ninety-nine year lease of Kiaochau and
Russia 'had thereupon seized Port Arthur
and Talienwan, later, securing the same
concession made to Germany. Lord Sal
isbury, demanded and was granted pos
session of Wethaiwei on the same terms,
securing also at the same time the open
ing of all inland waters to navigation for
vessels of all nations; the opening of va
rious additional treaty ports, the assur
ance that no portion of the provinces ad
joining the Yang-ste-Kiang Valley should
be alienated to any other power, and that
as long as British trade continued to ex
ceed that of any other nation the Inspec
tor General of Maritime Trade should be
a British subject. He also secured the
concession of about 200 Square miles of
land on the Kowloon Peninsula, opposite
Hongkong.
The capture of Khartoum in lS98.and
the subsequent death of the Khalifa and
the conquest of his territories, with the
appearnce of a French force at Fashoda,
on the Upper Nile, brought up the neces
sity of a settlement of the rights of the
two countries in that quarter of Africa.
Lord Salisbury made certain concessions
in the Niger Hinterlund, and the French
Government relinquished all claims to
any part of the Nile Valley. '
In 189D the relations with the South
African republics were ruptured, and the

1 THE MAN YOU LOVE. Â§
g IT has been said repeatedly that any woman, who is not positively Â«
* I deformed, can, with tact and delicacy, win any man she sets her heart S
g JI upon, bittâ can she? How many women have smilingly accepted Q
Q the compliment of the assertion in public, only to ponder the ques- Q
~ tion anxiously, oft times hopelessly, in the privacy of the boudoir. S
Â§ What an old, old. problem it is. to be sure, but oh, how appallingly Â«
o new to most of the {rentier sex who will read these lines. Matrimony S
8 âthe right manâ a comfortable, happy home. .It is the one creat prob- 8
Â§ lem of a woman's life from the cradle to the prave. They are the ideals g
8 that women have always cherished, always will. And how many, or Q
8 rather, how few. realize their ideals. S
v3 It is a problem that few men can understand, or, worst of all. ever g
g try to understand. Man. with his lordly assumption of all the oreroK- o
Q atives of life worth haviner. may woo and win where and when he list- g
S eth.~ But to woman â passive, receptive woman â what is Riven? She g
* must wait her lover's coming. She may not seek, as man does, that which 8
o pleases her most. And out of the lovers who choose to woo she must- Â«
g make what poor selection is afforded her, and, burying the ideal, jjive all S
g the fluttering, clinfcins: hope of the future to shaping: the Teal into X
<3 something akin to the srod of her dreams. Â«
8 And in this world of sham a n< * show, of the mad chase for wealth, g
j* the problem has become vastly more vexatious than it ever was befoTe. Â«
Â« Even though it has been lone a cce P te<^ as something akin to a ioke. it o
o happens all too often in real life *^at she loves the poor man. and must 9
g choose between him and a wealthier though less undesirable suitor.
gt Perverse woman, say the knowi n S and the worldly; but only the cirl Â«
Â£** who has been confronted with su c^ a P r Â°blem can realize the heartburn- 8
g ing, the sublime emotional tragedy of il a^- Whichever way she chooses g
g some great part of the ideal is s^ att . cre(^ andâ what then? o
q Every woman who reads is s e ?^ mj ? *^ e answer to just such a ques- 5?
Â£$ tion. Just a few of those who w" tc Iiave l " e< * to answer it for her.
S Such a one is the "Half-Hour-^ to ". ette " ' n the next Sunday Call, en- Â£>
g titled "When Jabberwock Rode." Curious title, isn't it? Well, it is a Â«

C* Perhaps, after all. you would n 't. for there is another story that solves S
8 the riddle in a different way. It is called "Betwixt- Dad and loe." but Â«
g the problem before the girl is n ot exactly what you would infer from S
8 that title â indeed not by a erea* deal. Nor can you_ guess. what man- Â» -
Â« ner of finesse she used to brintr about a happy, endingâ the only sort an Â«
g ?rdent girl will ever accept. Still another is "Under the Car of the 5

made by Miller that he, has increased the
output of his division at reduced cost.
He was rranted a fair and Impartial trial
by Ms peers. He was Riven every right and
privilege accorded by the constitution he had
obligated himself to conform to and support.
During the progress of the trial the evidence
that he had outrageously violated his obliga
tions was so convincing and overwhelming
that he was denounced as unfit for member
ship in an organization composed of self
respecting men, and they expelled him there
from.
They explain at length the grounds for
Miller's expulsion from the union, which
they say was due to the fact that he
made misrepresentations to Congress con
cerning the work done at the Government
printing office with a view to securing a
reduction of the pay of the binders. On
th.'s point they say:
The bookbinders claim that when Mil
ler first entered the service he had made
misrepresentations to the effect that he
had served a full apprenticeship, which
they claim he had not done, and they re
peat the charges of marital irregularities.

NEW YORK, Aug. 22.-L.lzzie Spltz
nadel, a pretty Austrian child 11 years of
age who has been totally blind since she
was 3 vears old, has been made to see
slightly as the result of an experiment
in in combination radium and X
rays. The experiment was tried only last
Wednesday night, and at the time of ap
plication it gave little or no promise of
being even moderately successful. The
child's sight has not been restored, but
she has in three days emerged from a
condition of total blindness to one in
which she can distinguish moving objects
and can plainly discern ordinary electric
lights at nignt.
Dr. Amon Jenkins of this city, who is
connected with the marine hospital ser
vice .and whose patient the child is, and
Wlllfam J. Hammer, a well known elec
trical engineer and expert in radium, con
ducted the experiment on the blind child.

When Shamrock III was first measured
the hatches had to be removed and two
lightweight men substituted for two
heavier ones , In the crew to keep the
water line inside of ninety feet This
brought her to 89 81-100 feet. The anchor

dependent upon the remeasurement.

"Mr. Iselin reports that you Informed
him, Just before starting on yesterdays
race, that Shamrock III, when measured,
did not have the anchor and cable on

also to . the regatta committee. This, if
true, would require a new measurement
under the agreement before starting an

be impossible now for you to procure a

The wind began to moderate a bit, and
wise observers asserted that the Reliance
had half a minute advantage. When both
yachts were about a quarter of a mile
apart: and a mile and a half from the
turning mark the Reliance was ahead,
but considerably to leeward of the Sham
rock. They were southwest of the mark
and heading toward the Jersey- coast,
when the wind suddenly "shifted from
south-soiHhwest to south by west, three
points. Thjs placed the Reliance In a
windward position. It was clear luck and
gave the defender a distinct advantage.
The Shamrock III held on her course
toward the Jersey shore, and the Reliance
crossed her bow a Quarter of a mile to
windward of her. Both boatsHhen made
short hitches to the turning mark and
when the Reliance rounded it three min
utes and twenty seconds in advance of
the challenger the whistles of the < fleet
acknowledged her luck and her lead. This
Just about an hour after the start, when
the yachts had covered nearly half the
distance to the outer mark,' opportunity
was afforded to note how close the con
test really was. The Reliance and Sham
rock III were approaching each other,
with the former on the starboard tack
and havlnc the right of way. As they
necked one another it was a. question
which was leading. The Shamrock III
was forced to go about to avoid a collis
ion. One hour's work had given neither
the advantage. They held that tack for
twenty minutes. The Shamrock III sud
denly went about and the Reliance fol
lowed suit, only to see the Shamrock re-}
turn to her former coursA Plainly it was
Captain Wringe's trick to shake off the
defender, which must have been threat
ening to blanket the British boat. As
soon as the Shamrock III got clear of the
Reliance she laid a parallel course.
The Shamrock III held the' lead under
the lee bow of the Reliance, but could not
add an inch to it. Neither could the Re
liance, although in the weather position,
get past the leader. If Captain Wringe
luffed Captain Barr luffed also and one
seemed to be as good as the other at this
trick. If Captain Wringe gave his craft
a hard full and\ tried to run away from
the Reliance Captain Barr eased the
American boat a bit and went after him.
Boats and skippers were evenly matched.
BOATS BOW AND BOW.
Both got away on the starboard tack,
carrying three lower sails and club top
sails, the Reliance a baby jib topsail.
What followed was the prettiest, closest
and most hard fought fifteen-mile thresh
to windward that has been witnessed in
these historic waters for many a day.
For nearly half an hour they held on one
tack and during all that time the most
acute observer could not detect that their
relative positions had varied more than
half the length of either of them.
The cup yachts went trailing off to the
eastward for about five miles and at 11:10
a starting line was established between
the Navigator and the Unique and the
committee's tug signaled a course fifteen
miles to the windward and return. The
wind was increasing, when, at the flash
of the starting gun, at 11:45, both yachts
lurched across the line, the Shamrock III
four seconds ahead of the Reliance. The
official starting time was:
Bhamrock 11:45:17
Reliance 11 :45:21
A snappy southwest wind was blowing,
when, a few minutes after 10 o'clock, the
Shamrock III, followed by the Reliance,
reached Sandy Hook Lightship. At 10:30
the regatta committee's steamer signaled
that the starting line would be shifted and
the race postponed until later in the day,
because of a windward course southwest
would have landed the racers on the
beach off Long Branch.
SCENE AT THE START.
The scene at the finish jvas soul-stir
ring. Unfier her towering cloud of can
vas, rolling ry thmically in the swell, the
Reliance bounded across the viewless fin
ish line like a. queen. The excursion
boats gathered there fairly awakened the
echoes with the terrific din which they
let loose. Then the immense' concourse
of boats waited until the Shamrock, ma
jestic even in defeat, swept by between
the stakeboats. The reception she re
ceived was, if anything, more hearty than
that extended to the victor.
Turning for home her spinnaker boom
poised along the mast like a lance in rest,
fell to port and the big sail burst out like
a cloud, while at the same moment her
enormous balloon jib topsail bellied out
forward. The smart work of the Yan
kees cheered the crowds, but a moment
afterward there was dismay when the
guy that held the spinnaker pole parted
or was carried away. The enormous sail
soared and tumbled over the jib topsail
stay, collapsing like an empty mail sack.
But the spar was soon hauled back into
place, and then, with her Viree balloon
sails setting like plaster, the stately
yacht sped homeward before the wind
like a frightened deer.
The fleet remained to salute the Sham
rock as she rounded and then, with a jin
gle of bells in the engine-rooms, scam
pered away for the finish line to be In at
the finish.
In setting her balloon jib the Shamrock
encountered another piece of bad luck.
One of the stops would not break out and
the sail held for some minutes like a limp
rag on the stay. When both had been
Equared away for home it was seen that
the Reliance was making a runaway race
of it. With her crew aft to keep her-- head
up, she skimmed along the surface of
the water like a gull with outstretched
wings, leaving the Shamrock far astern.
The pace was bo fast that many of the
tugs and not a few of the steamers were
left behind.
YANKEES SHOW SKILL.
Suddenly the wind draped and hauled
a trifle to the west. The shift enabled
the yachts to head up for the mark with
the Reliance In the lead by about two
hundred yards. This was tho only thing
which marred an otherwise truly sailed
race. But from that time on the Reliance
steadily Increased her lead in the wind
ward work until she was three-quarters
of a mile ahead. As she rounded the outer
mark the whistles, sirens, bands and the
voices of the unnumbered thousands on
the excursion fleet swelled Into a vast
chorus.
The first few minutes of the thresh to
windward wero watched with Intense In
terest. Both were footing like mad. They
showed yards of their underbodies and
shipped a good deal of spray and some
solid wa^er forward. But after fifteen
minutes of sailing their positions had not
varied perceptibly and there was alarm
among the experts. Those who had ex
pected to see the Reliance walk away
from her adversary as a result of last
Thursday's showing were disappointed.
Shamrock hung on and in tack after tack
she seemed to be holding her own.
For thirteen miles the challenger and
challenged fought out the magnificent
duel sailing" between two lines of excur
sion boats as free from Interference as if
they had been In the middle of the Atlan
tic. All the time the wind was Increasing
and the whitecap3 were whitening the
waves. The critical point In the race came
at 1:40 p. m., a little less than two hours
after the start. The mark was less than
two miles away and the relative posi
tions of the boats were about the same.
Both were on the starboard tack, the Re
liance ahead but to leeward.
OPENING OF- CONTEST.
ward In the twelve-knot breeze, pound-
Ing fountains of spray from their bows
ana leaning to It until the water swirled
and bubbled under their, lee rails. The
crews were piled up along the weather
side to hold the great racing machines
up.
. Once around the mark - the Reliance
out her balloon jib topsail, swung
out her spinnaker pole and broke out her
spinnaker for a run dead before the wind
to the finish line. Whether her spinnaker
sheet parted or slipped from its fastening'
or the boom lifted was not clear, the
pole swung out ahead of her high in'o
the air and the big sail hung In loose
folds across her Jib topsail stay. For a
minute It looked as though she were in
serious difficulty. The pole was hauled
'aft to its proper position and her spin
naker began to do its work.
The Reliance was three-quarters of a
mile away wlien the Shamrock III turned
the mark and broke out her balloon jlm
topsail. The upper part of It refused to
break out and still hung in stops,, but
only for a few minutes. As with the Re
liance, her Bplnnaker, too, swung across
her Jib topsail stay and hung empty of
wind for a minute or more. When it was
sheeted back into position there was a
good sized rip in the leach of It pear her
masthead, and during all the run home
it bellied out loosely, as though Captain
Wringe would not give it a good full for
feax that he might lose it altogether.
During all of the fifteen mile run which
the yachts covered at a twelve knot clip
the Reliance steadily and persistently
crawled away from, the now hopelessly
beaten challenger. The smoke of the
scurrjing fleet almost hid them from the
shore as the Reliance swept across the
line and into a long lino of the faster
boats who had got there in time to see
the finish and to acknowledge. her victory.
Eight minutes and fifty-six second^ later
the plucky challenger followed her across
the line and received the salute of the en
tire fleet. . I - '

them In to speak for themselves. All
of these men had acted with coolness and
presence of mind and, as the evidence
showed, probably without a thought of
reward. They were all somewhat abashed
ln .the presence of the directors and their
statements were secured only by contin
ual questioning, on the part of Chairman
Fitzgerald.
Joseph Casev said:.
The other members of the board agreed
to this view of the case, but all were
unwilling to censure the Warden or his
subordinates.
It Is eaÂ«j- for a man to ait back in a chair
and talk of It when the murderous thugs are
not ready to blow one's brains out. Under the
strict construction of their duty the guards
should have fired, otherwise the convicts can
grab a number of offlcers at any time and walk
off to the woods.
Chairman Fitzgerald said
fled around the auarters of the offlcers
and guards to the back pate. There they
were permitted to pass by Night Captain
Dolan without using their dynamite,
which was carried by Roberta. Then th$
outlaws went to the armory and got in
side as the guard appeared with a rifle.
After arming themselves* the" convicts
took off over the hills, dragging their un
willing prisoner's. While Casey secured
the remaining- prisoners Clark called for
assistance by telephone and Martinez
rang the alarm bell. It appeared that'
not alone the Warden but the other free
men called to the guards ln the tower not
to phoot.
The directors felt that it was a ticklish
position in which to place men and they-*
were not ready to say whether the guards
should have shot at the group of convicts
and officials on the fateful occasion.
felon, "but I spent a week In jail before
I got back here and the lawyer there said
I had better keep my mouth closed until
I should be brought to trial. The District
Attorney informed me that I would be
charged with murder. So unless I am
compelled to speak I would prefer to say
nothing." ' ,
Fitzgerald said: "That's right, and we
will not compel you to answer any ques
tions." 'Â¦ Â¦
Then the party passed to the cell of F.
Quyada, a murderer with a life sentence
from Los Angeles. A dangerous looking
knife was taken from him Thursday night
in the course. of the search conducted by
the Warden and the guards. The weapon
was found after a careful inspection to be
a counterpart of the knives dropped by
two of tho escaped convicts on the morn
ing of the outbreak. Furthermore Wil
kinson claims to have other evidence that
Quyada made the weapons used to wound
the officials on July 27.
The convict gazed unintelligently at the
Directors, but said nothing. He is an In
dian half-breed, but looks more like an
animal than a human being. After a long
pause Director Wilkins asked, "What
were you doing with that knife?"
"Nothing," replied Quyada, "only -one
of them fellows told me that he would
kill me and I made the knife so I could
defend myself."
'.'Why did you not make a report of the
man's threat to the offlcers?'^ was asked.
"I did not think of that," .was the re
sponse.
The Warden is giving Quyada a taste
of the straltjacVet to teach him not to
make and conceal deadly weapons. The
canvas covering was applied to the pris
oner in the presence of the visitors and
he was left lying on the floor of his cell,
stolid and sullen. He Is obstinate and the
punishment seems not to trouble him in
the slightest degree. On the morning of
the escape ' Quyada was locked in the
prison by Convict Joseph Casey and was
nearly frantic with disappointment.
The directors then inspected the re
mainder of the interior of the prison and
found everything in satisfactory condi
tion. Several of the prisoners, with stories
of innocence and of 111 treatment, ac
costed the visitors on the way out and
all weTe accorded a hearing.- The board
then went into executive session again
Captain Murphy, Night Captain Dolan
General Overseer J. J. McDonough j'
Kip. C. Gillice and Michael Halloran then
told their stories of the outbreak and
their separate adventures following that
Incident. All agreed that the whole thing
occurred in an instant. . There was crowd
ing, scuffling, shouting; and blood-letting
and the convicts locked In prison were
yelling in excitement,, while the escapes
ROBERTS IS SILENT.
"You must excuse me," replied the
Guard Chalmers was on the stand after
the Warden. He admitted himself and
was strongly corroborated by others that
he dropped the key to the gate and
sprinted away from danger. Convict John
Martinez picked up the key and locked
the gate and then went to attend to the
wounded guards, Corcoran and Cotter.
Guard G. E. Jetef told hq,w he was
gathered in by the convicts near the en
trance to Captain Murphy's office and
then carried to the hill country as a pris
oner of the outlaws.
John Hlnters was the last man to ap
pear before the directors in the morning
and he went away without the $50 reward
he wanted for the capture .of Convict
James Roberts.
After luncheon Directors Fitzgerald,
Wilkins and Ray, accompanied by War
den Wilkinson, some guards and press
representatives visited the prison for the
purpose of seeing the convicts Seavls and
Roberts. The former, whose wounds are,
not yet healed, lay on a blanket spread
on the floor of his cell. As the door
opened he raised himself on his elbows
and smiled pleasantly at his visitors.
"How is your leg getting along?" asked
Fitzgerald.
"Oh, pretty well; it is better to-day
than it has been," was the reply. Then
he continued, volubly: "The doctor said
all but one of the shot was out. It will
get all right before long."
Seavis has convinced himself that he
will escape punishment for his part in
the outbreak and is quite content to be
back where he can eat three meals each
day.
When the Directors reached Roberts'
coll and the door was opened, the convict
arose and saluted the visitors very re
spectfully, although the guards have had
much difficulty with him since his recap
ture. He regards himself as a hero.
"Where did you get that dynamite,
Roberts?'.' asked Fitzgerald, alluding to
the four sticks of explosive carried by
the convicts on the morning of the es
cape. '
towers. The directors went inside the
armory and asked how the outlaws got
entrance so easily. . .
, "It was. this way," replied the Warden.
"The guard heard that the convicts were
getting' away and ran to the armory to
get their weapons. .The escapes caught
him as he was coming out. They had
dynamite and would have blown the door
down anyway." >
Governor Pardee and Secretary A. B.
Nye Joined the directors at this point,
having arrived by an early train, and re
mained with the party throughout the
day, although the Governor took almost
no part in the proceedings.. *
Accompanied by the Warden, the party
ot investigators adjourned to the house
and formally opened the session. The
minutes were read and approved, after
which several communications relating
to the parole of prisoners were read and
action postponed. Then a letter from Jo
seph Silverla was unearthed, in which
the directors were. asked to pay $700 for
horses Wiled and Injured in the Pilot Hill
fight and for another animal taken by a
pursuing guard and not returned. Sll
verla's team was the one in which tho
outlaws made their sensational escape.
The directors thought that a thousand
more bills Of the same kind might ap
pear and that it would be better not to
establish a bad precedent by the payment
of the first. So on the suggestion of Di
rector Fitzgerald it was decided to refer
the matter to Attorney General Webb.
i Silveria can w|l( for his money. This
will be the fate of all such bijls result
i ing from the depredations of the fugitive
I felons.
! Warden Wilkinson was then examined
j In regard to the outbreak. He testified
that he was In the office, and after escap
ing the knife thrust was marched off into
the hills at the point of a rifle by his
charges. He stated that had he been
alone he would have ordered the guards
In the towers to fire, but he did not feel
like risking the lives of so many of his
subordinates.
' The Directors asked some pointed ques
j tions regarding the management of the
prison, but all agreed that the outbreak
was made possible by a lack of walls
around the prison grounds.
Director Fitzgerald said if the Legisla
ture would appropriate funds for cement
and tools a splendid wall could be built
for $60,000 by convict labor. He asserted
I that other breaks would be possible un
der present conditions, and the other
members of the 'board agreed with him
fully. The Warden said if he had money
he could put the prison in such shape as
to make a big outbreak Impossible.
Wilkinson* reported that several of the
prison employes acted in a cowardly man
ner on the morning of the outbreak.
Guards Klenzendorf, Ryason and Chal
mers and Dr. Plant were given special
mention. It appeared from the statements
of majiy of the prison officials that the
worthy physician hit only the high places
In getting to a point of safety.

Much Interest has lately been aroused
in London by two surgical operations
which have resulted In a marked, change
of character In the patients. One was
that of a boy of good family who had de
veloped strangely brutal instincts. .; A
clever surgeon examined him with care,
located what he considered the seat* of
the trouble, removed* a piece "of the skull
and thus relieved the deforming pressure.
/The lad was restored to his parents ; a
normal and lovable child. The other
case was that of a soldier who, after an
injury in a skirmish, developed a propen
sity for theft. An operation on the brain
cured him. " â¢
Ireland's great astronomer, Sir Robert
Ball, has Just reached his sixty-third
year. It is true that he has been astro
nomical professor at Cambridge for a de
cade, but he remains a thorough Irish
man still. His career as an astronomer
dates back to 1865, when shortly after
leaving Trinity College, Dublin, he was
placed in charce of the famous private
observatory established at Parsonstownj
Kings County. Ireland. When the pos
sibility of signaling to Mars was under
discussion he pointed out that If a fjag
of the size of Ireland was waved from
a pole to match. there was just a ghost
of a chance that an astronomical Mar

PECULIARITIES OF SPEECH
OF SOUTHERN NEGR0E3
Seating herself by the side of the lad.
she said kmdly: "Oh. my boy. wouldn't
your father be dreadfully pained if he
saw you smoking that cigar?"
"Rather think he would," responded the
twentieth century young man. without re
moving the weed from his mouth, "this is
one of his best cigars."â New York Com
mercial.
A kind hearted woman saw a small boy
seated on one of the benches In Fair
mount Park at Philadelphia the other
day, smoking a cigar, which she after
ward told a friend, seemed almost as bis
as himself. This woman is an enthusias
tic anti-tobacco worker and never loses
an opportunity to impress, especially upon
youthful minds, the evils of using tobacco
in any form.
One of the Old Man's Best.
'1.' This Is notably true in the negro's
use of 'is* for 'are.* Aealn we find him
leaning toward the thinner sound of 'a,'
as when he will use 'am' instead of 'are.'
the 'a' in 'am' coming nearer the sound
of T than the 'a' In 'are.' 'Gwlne.' the
negro's word for 'going,' and, by the way,
a word of splendid euphony, infinitely
sweeter and more musical than 'going,'
is another illustration of the black man's
preference for the sound of '1.' So, too,
'ain't' and 'isn't' are constantly and per
sistently used by negroes Instead of 'am
not' and 'is not,' again showing the ne
gro's preference for which I have called
the thin and sharper sound. Did you ever
hear a negro say ah for I? Well, per
haps you have, but this is the rare ex
ception. The negro generally sounds the
'1/ and sounds it thinly instead of broad
ening it into the sound of 'a.' For In
stance, Ts gwlne' ia a very common way
the negro has for beginning a sentence
meaning 'I am going.' The expression as
a rule is thin and sharpâ Ts gwlne." This
peculiarity of negro speech la not only
overlooked by the Jingle builders who
have flooded the market with ragtime
songs; the dialecticians who are seeking
to preserve what beauty there is In the
language of this Interesting race by giv
ing the negro a lasting place in the lit
erature of the country have fallen Into
the same error.. Rob the negro of his
peculiarities of speech and change tho
character of bis music, and you take from
him all that is humorous, poetic and all
the finer emotional shades, all the tints
and colors which run the wide range be
tween light-hearted, comedy and the deep
er "shadowing of the tragic." â Washington

Indian Basket Materials.
Collectors of Indian baskets agree in
conceding the greatest beauty of form
and design to the products of certain
parts of California. As yet, though, the
source of some of the material Incorpo
rated in those exquisite pieces of handi
craft has been a mystery. C. Hart Mer
riam supplies in Science some Interest in
formation on that point.
One color of which much use Is made
is a buff brown that grows richer with
age By careful selection a handsome
\ dappled effect Is secured with It. This
material, the Indians told Mr. Merriam,
is the root of a marsh plant, which they
travel far to get. After a long hunt he
! obtained specimens and a California
botanist identified It as "Cladium maris
cus." The eplit root is wound around a
foundation of yellow grass. For black
the Indians use the root of the brake
fern. Red is generally obtained from the
redbud tree, the twigs being gathered
after the autumn rains. Another red, em
ployed by the Kern Valley Indians, is
sometimes called "cactus root." Mr. Mer
riam has discovered, however, that It is
the unpeeled root of the yucca. The plant
Is found in the upper part of the Mohave
Desert and reaches over the Sierras Into
the vicinity of the Kern. Here, again,
there is a variation of tint which permits
beautiful shading with a single sub
stance,
Blacks are produced In the Death Val
ley by the eplit seed pods of the "devil's
horn (martynla) and the root of a marsh
bulrush. By burying the latter in ashes
it can be made to assume a brownish or
purplish hue. In the Colorado Desert of
California black and orange brown are
secured from the teaf of a desert palm.
Either in combination with yucca root
or alone the bright red shafts of the
wing and tail feathers of a woodpecker
give striking effects.
In parishes where the population can
not sustain a church school tho children
of Catholic families attend the common
Bchools, under an arrangement with the
educational authorities that there be no
religious education during the regular
school hours. After the school is dis
missed the children may be taught relig
ion by members of any denomination who
desire to use the schoolbouses for' that
purpose, but attendance Is voluntary.
That is the Farlbault plan, which was in

In matters of tho law the physician is
"a layman," and may therefore err in
judgment, as we find even tho best ln
tentloned of our laymen do as to medical
ethics. In spite of the caution this
thought gives, one must feel something
like a shock at a recent decision of the
United States Court of Appeals. Previous
decisions had established the precedent
that no insurance can be collected on the
life of a man executed for crime. One
by the name of Burt was executed for
murder, but it was subsequently demon
strated that he had not been guilty of the
crime. The family claimed, in view of
his innocence,/ that* tho lifo Insurance
company should pay the amount, of his
policy. The court has decided against the
claim, "even If the policy makes no pro
vision for forfeiture on that account."
This appears a capital Illustration of add
ing Insult to injury. The law's Imper
fections permit an innocent man to be
hanged and then refuse his widow the
little justice of the money of his life in
surance policy! We allude to tho matter
less to criticize the law than to ask for
the wide publication of the name of the
Insurance company, which can bring it
self to illustrate a "low-down" meanness
that no. American business man should be
guilty of and which should not be left
unpunished.â American Medicine.

The late Dr. William F. Poole, who had
charge of Ithe Chicago Public Library,
declared that many clergymen had, as
regards books, an imperfect appreciation
of tho laws of meum tuum. He had
found ministers more remiss in returning
books than any other class of men. He
dhi not intend to reflect on a noble and
sacred profession by charging the . dere
lictions of the few upon the many, but
he believed the truth about the matter
should be told. He had had unpleasant
experiences with men of that calling, who,
after stealing books from the library, had
removed the book plates and library
stamp and covered the^rivolumes . with
heavy paper, carefully pasted down In
side the covers. This statement seems to
be borne out by thd record of the Union
Theological Seminary, at New York, in
Its dealings with ministers and theolog
ical students. According to the librarian's
report, the seminary Irtis lost. a thousand
volumes, 'taken out and not returned.
This, of course, included what were
charged out. but could not be recovered.
The long history of the Mercantile li
brary of "Philadelphia furnishes many
strange cases of this form of petty lar
ceny. At a certain period in the some
what checkered career of this time hon
ored institution a number of valuable
books were missed from its shelves, and
means were taken to detect the culprit.
This led to the discovery that the thief
was a physician In the most respectable
rank In society, and more than fifty vol
umes were found upon the shelves of his
private library and recovered. Other ex
amples of kleptomania in persons of ac
cepted social position have astonished the
custodians of this library from time to
time, but the means of preventing such
thefts has not yet been discovered.
It may be gathered from these many
cases of library depredations that they
aro very common, that perpetual vigil
ance is necessary in order to guard the
books and that in nearly all cases some
form of punishment would be wiser than
pardon. In many cases of detected theft
strong appeals are made by tho. culprit
or his friends to save exposure by public
proceedings. These appeals are commonly
made not so much to avoid paying fines
imposed by law as to avoid the disgrace
attached to publicity. It is probably true
that in the majority of cases such in
fluence has been strong enough to over
come the determination of the library
authorities to let the law take its course.
Unfortunately, the consequences of such
leniency seems to encourage the extreme
ly lax conception of the sacredness of
public property entertained by so many
men and women of to-day.â Philadelphia
Record. "*-.s.
While it may be taken for granted that
the great body of readers who frequent
any public library arÂ© honest, both In
practice and intention, there will always
remain a certain number who are con
spicuously the reverse. In all public li
braries a large number of volumes dis
appear during the twelve months of a
year; a few of these may have been lost
through carelessness while in circulation,
but the greater number of them have
been stolen. This fact being freely admit
ted in the reports of all librarians, the
question naturally arises: Who arÂ© the
thieves? Do they steal the books in or
der to sell them, on does their dishonesty
arise from a diseased love of literature?
Melvil Dewey, who may be regarded as
an authority on the subject, has truth
fully declared that it is almost Impossible
to tell a library thief at sight. He may
hide his dishonesty beneath an exterior
as smug and sanctimonious as that of
Pecksniff. A prominent lawyer of Brook
lyn, of distinguished appearance and finÂ©
manners, made a regular practice of
stealing the periodicals in a well known
public library. Being caught at it onÂ©
day and accused by the librarian, he put
on an air of great dignity, hotly declared
that he was insulted and walked out. But
the magazine the lawyer had stolen was
found thrown down in the entry; and he
never again reappeared In that library.
At the New York Mercantile Library a
young woman was discovered leaving tho
rooms with one book, which she was en
titled to, in her hand, and five others
hidden under her cloak. She proved to be
long to a Well-to-do family and was am
ply able to buy all thÂ© books she could
need.

"A Strange Story. Veiled." and another "What

throughout the trials to his sister, Mme,
Humbert
Counsel severely criticized thc declara
tion of M. Patenotre, the former French
Embassador at Madrid, that he did not
know Mme. Humbert* and invited the
jury to request the presiding Judge to
give some certain private letters, in one
of which, M. Hesse asserted, M. Patenotre
thanked Mme. Humbert for adornments
which she had sent him for his salon.
At the conclusion of the pleading Mme.
Humbert arose, amid an intense hush
throughout the courtroom, to made her
promised revelations. She seemed to be
laboring under a great effort and paused
after her first emphatic statement that
the Crawfords and the millions existed.
Then she began formally:
"Gentlemen of the jury; When I want
ed the address of M. Crawford he an
swered, 'You cannot know me. I am not
called Crawford. I am not known by
that name.'
" 'Then, what name?' I asked.
"He replied: 'My fortune was made
during the war of 1870, by reinvestment
of rentes, which were then very low, and
a large quantity was bought here.' "
CBAWFOED IS REGNIER.
Madame Humbert paused again, length
ily, and then continued:
"His name is. Regnier, the Intermediary
between Marshal Bazaine. and the Ger
mans. Ivhad alreadyÂ«transacted business
with one Regnier, who appeared to me to
be a mysterious personage, and who said
to me: 'Be careful, madame, not to con
fuse me with the notorious Regnier.'
"That is how I suddenly learned Craw
ford's name. I never told. my husband. I
swear on my daughter's head. This is
the first time he hears the name," .
Addressing the presiding Judge, Madame
Humbert went on, exclaiming:
"What I say is true. ; The Crawfords
exist, the fortune exists, and I, Madame
Humbert, will bring : action against the
Crawfords." . ,Â» ' Â¦â¢â¢ â¢'/â¢ '.-.: Â¦Â¦.-
Turning to the jury again, Madame
Humbert said: *.
"Gentlemen, I. will not say any more. It
Is enough to tell you that the fortune
exists, and that I never cheated any one.
Now you have the whole Humbert case
and the whole Crawford case."
Madame Humbert continued, making
a rambling, indefinite statement, criticiz
ing M. Valle, the Minister of Justice, in
connection with the Cattaui case, assert
ing her truthfulness and declaring that
when acquitted her creditors would be
able to find her. She would do her duty,
she said, and- if any one offered her
money she would show him the door.. She
concluded:
"I have full, complete confidence, and
now I await my fate."
A prolonged movement among the spec
tators followed the statement, which
caused a general feeling of disappoint
ment, owing to the inconclusive nature of
Madame Humbert's declarations.
LABORI SPEAKS.
Maitre Labori, addressing the jury,
said: '^<V ;V
"Now you have the secret of Mme.
Humbert. | She has told you the same as
she told me."
Counsel, continuing, read a sketch of
Regnier from a biographical' dictionary,
which stated that Regmier played a con
siderable secret part in the war of 1S7D,
and that he acted as intermediary be
tween Prince Bismarck and Marshal Ba
zaine.
Maitre Labori said he had been unable
to learn what eventually became of Reg
nier. After being condemned to death by
court-martial. Regrnler disappeared.' The
Minister of War should be able to furnish
information as to what became of him. â¢
Counsel concluded with an eloquent
plea to the Jury not to condemn the pris
oners, which aroused loud applause. The
president of the court then declared the
arguments closed and read the 260 ques
tions submitted to the Jury- The jury re
.tired'at 2:30 p. m. and the prisoners with
drew. M. Humbert and Emlle d'AurlRnac
looked greatly depressed,, while Mme.
Humbert and Romain d'Aurignac main
tained their defiant attitude. The specta
tors remained, anxiously awaiting "tfie
verdict. The general feeling was one of
stupefaction at the utter futility of Mme.
Humbert's revelations.
Mme. Humbert's mention of Regnier ln-
TCLARE, AnÂ«. aâ Witt tht> last day of

settlement of the Irrigation district bonds ia

eary (273.000 Is on deposit with the Ran Fran
cieco Savins* Union and nearly all of the

abeolutely no opposition to the settlement as
a whole.
The expectation that to-day would bring
the conclusion of the Humbert trial re
newed the Intense public interest in. the
case. The courtroom was again crowded.
Among the throns: were a number of
American lawyers and tourists, who se
cured favored places through the efforts
of the United States embassy.
The prisoners maintained the same out
ward aspect of calm. Mme. Humbert
walked in haughtily and surveyed the
crowd with a scornful air. Dr. Floquet,
who examined the prisoner before she
came into court, found her to be in good
health and showing no signs of nervous
breakdown under the strain of the cul
mination of the trial.
Advocate Hesse addressed the court at
length in defense of Romain d'Aurignac,
pointing out his brotherly devotion
Following the announcement of the ver
dict Maitre Labor! raised technical objec
tions to the proceedings as a probable
basis of appeal.
COURTROOM IS CROWDED.
The sentences came as the culmination
of a day of sensational Interest. The chief
event preceding the verdict was the dra
matic revelations which Therese Hum
bert ha* so long promised, In the making
of which she disclosed the same genius
which had marked her entire career, as
indicated by her selection of the myste
rious name of Regnier as tho real Craw
ford. Rejrnier figured in the dark page of
the Franco-German War as the interme
diary between Prince Bismarck and Mar
shal Bazaine for the surrender of Metz.
The court and spectators listened to the
recital with an amazement amounting to
stupefaction. It was evident that The
rese Humbert sought to bring into the
case one of the supreme events of the
war of 1870 for the purpose of introducing
another mystery to confuse the court tuid
delay the result, but court, jury and spec
tators alike were unconvinced, as her ref
erences to Regnier were most vague and
did not explain his relationship to the
younger. Crawford.
Although Therese did not indicate
whence Regnier's millions came, it was
apparently part of her plan to create the
impression that Regnier had received a
vast sum for inducing Marshal Bazalne to
surrender Metz. The conclusive character
of the revelations was shown by the fact
that the court did not take the slightest
judicial cognizance of them and immedi
ately submitted the case to the Jury. The
jury likewise treated the revelations as a
subterfuge and returned a verdict of guil
ty upon all the material points. The de
tailed verdict is as follows:
Upon the questions of forgery and the usage
ol forgery the Jury answers "Therese Hum
bert and Frederic Humbert guilty; the others
not guilty."
Upon, the question of the Issuance of forced
legal paper* the Jury answered "Therese Hum
bert and Frederic Humbert guilty; the others
notÂ»gullty."
Upon the question of swindling five specified
bankers the Jury answered 'Frederick Hum
bert and Therese Humbert guilty; the others
not guilty."
Upon the question of swindling the Rente
Viaglere the Jury answered "All guilty."
The Jury Indorsed on Its verdict that there
were extenuating circumstances in favor of all
the accused.
DRAMATIC BEVELATIONS.
Frederic Humbert acted as though
dazed by the shock of conviction, his thin
face assuming a ghastly pallor.
Romain and Emile d'Aurignac pre
served an air of stolid indifference.
After & brief deliberation the court sen
tenced Theresa and Frederic Humbert
each to five years' and to a fine of 100
francs, Emlle d'Aurignao to three years
and Romain d'Aurignac to two years.
The verdict was reached after the Jury
had been out four and a half hours.
When the verdict was pronounced Therese
and Frederic Humbert, weeping, em
braced each other. Romain d'Aurignac
tried to console bis sister, whispering to
her: "Remember, we are not separated
even in the hour of our adversity."
Theresa Humbert seemed to be hopeful
until the last, maintaining that the jury
was certain to bring in a verdict of ac
quittal. Even after condemnation her
emotion was only momentary. She soon
resumed her self-possession and thanked
Dr. Floquet for his ministrations. , Show-
Ing him the fan which he had given her,
she said: "1 shall always preserve this
as a precious token of the care, even
more moral than physical, which you
have bestowed upon me during the pain
ful hours I have Just gone through."
She also thanked Maitre Labori and the
other counsel for the defense. Then, turn-
Ing to the military guard, she Indicated
her readiness to go back to the cells of
the Concierserle Prison.

night that Jeffries would five him $10,000
if he could stay four rounds.
-Will I fight Jeffries ? Well. Td rather
do that than eat dinner to-day," he said.
"That $10,000 he offersâ why. It's like find
ing money. Tm afraid Jeffries don't
mean it. But I'll ten you what I will
do. I will give him a $1000 present to sign
articles for a fight. Then I will bet him
$5000 on the side."
"What is the use> of that. Jack? Why
not fight him for $10,000 and bo satisfied
with that?" some one asked.
"Why, It's a cinch, and I want to make
as much as possible out of it," the miner
replied. "Jeffries can't knock me out in
twenty rounds. He did not do it at
Butte, but came near being beaten him

tenes, who was charged with assault with
Intent to commit robbery, pleaded guilty
before Judge Hart in the Superior Court
this morning and was sentenced to tea
years' imprisonment at San Quentin.
Regnier was first heard of In connec
tion ' with the revolution of 1848. in which
he played a doubtful part. In September, 1S70,
the Empress Eugenie then at Hastings. Eng
land, Intrusted him with a mission to Prince
Bismarck. Regnier later went to Metz. intro
duced himself to Marshal Bazalne and urged
on Bazalne that the war should have ended
after the battle of Sedan and that his army,
which was useless at Metz. ought to maintain
order In the interior. Bazalne thereupon ac
cepted the Idea of treating: with the Germans.
Regnler's obect was simply to Induce Bazalne
to capitulate ar.d it was well known that Ba
zaine acquiesced to the capitulation without
raising any difficulties The surrender of Metz
followed. Regnler's complicity was proved in
troduced an entirely unexpected name,
one which had been almost entirely for
gotten, although it was that cf a noto

Yesterday afternoon the exalted cap
tain's attention was drawn to White Hat
McCarthy's unique head piece, which he
coveted and seized. Before the owner of
that fuzzy and historic covering for the
head realized that his heirloom, was In
Jeopardy Boynton snatched It, placed It
on his own head and marched down Bush
Btreet as proud as a boy with his first
pair of red-top boots. This was the quick
est rush act that Mao had encountered
Eince the close of the races, and It took
his breath. After some persuasion the
captain surrendered tho hat and went his
way rejoicing.
The captain createu a furor when he
strikes town. Last month he was treated
to the indignity of a ride in the patrol
wagon owlns to his having drunk too
deeply of the flowing cup.
Guests of the California Hotel think
that the gallant captain and Mrs. Boyn
ton met casually in the city, but the
old man of the sea simply waves his mar
riage license in the inquirer's face.
Captain Boynton has several grown sons
and daughters In this State. They have
not yet had the pleasure ol meeting their
new stepmother, and it Is rumored that
there will bÂ«i a scene when Captain Boyn
ton arrives home with his bride.
By degrees Captain Boynton's heart grew
lighter and lighter, and suddenly he ap
peared at the hotel with a buxom woman,
introducing her as his wife. He secured
tho license on Thursdaj^ and the good
lady's name is Anna M. 'Myers, aged 52.
She gave her residence as Colusa.
Captain Boynton is a retired sea cap
tain. In the words of the author of up
to-date literature he would be termed "a
rough sea dog." Grieving over the loss of
his wife and reading lurid accounts of
how the Grand Army veterans were be
ing entertained in the city, ho fled from
agricultural pursuits near Sulsun and
found himself a few days'ago in this city.
He was a frequent visitor around the of
fice of the California Hotel and just to
show that his seventy-six years were
carried lightly he danced a sailor's horn
pipe in the office of the hotel, much to
the horror of the aristocratic permanent
guests and to the edification of the fire
men in the next door engine-house, who
were attracted to the unusual scene by
the Â£iptaln's Indian warwhoops.
The guests of the California Hotel are
trying to conjecture whether It was from
viewing the brilliant arch that spans
Market street or whether It was San
Francisco Grand Army posts' hospitality
that made Captain H. Boynton of seven
ty-six summer and nobody knows how
many winters change from a lonely
widower Into an exhilarated bridegroom.

the past 15 years he has lived at T^ood

spent much of his time in touring the
country with Diablo, which he has owned
since a colt.
It was the wish of the dying man that
the horse remain here for another year In
order that all of his obligations may be
fulfilled. Diablo has a record of 2:09}4 in
the mile pace, made in California in 1894.
Murray was one of the most popular
men on the turf and was alsp noted for
his good heartedness and liberality.

The impossibility of stating; In advance what
lands will ultimately be recommended for re
clamation Trill result In great disappointment
to many jjemons. The fact that the lands
have been temporarily Bet aside Is, In the eyea
of many, an indication that these lands will
be reclaimed, and although every attempt has
been to warn Individuals of the futility of
filing upon these lands under the homestead
law, they persist In taking up the lands on
the bare possibility that the surveys and
recommendations will ultimately show it to
be reclalmable. It is i an unfortunate condi
tion, which, apparently, cannot be corrected at
present. ...
At each of the places where systematic
work has been conducted preliminary
temporary withdrawals of public lands
have been made, but the 'areas which
may be reclaimed are indicated only in a
general way by those temporary segre
gations.
Commenting on the effect of these with
drawals the report says:
On the Salt and Glla rivers, in Arizona;
on the Colorado River, in California; on
the North Platte, Gunnlson and Grand
rivers. In Colorado; on the SnakÂ© River
In Idaho; on the deep well problems of
Western Kansas; on the Milk River, in
Montana; on the artesian well problems
of Western Nebraska; on the Carson and

Debt and Debtors.
Casual moralists take different views of
tne moral turpitude of debt. They ca'l a
debtor anything between a thief and a
careless fellow. The former verdict Is,
of course, too harsh, though we have
often heard its justice seriously main
tained, and it is certainly more easily
refuted by Illustration than by argument.
On the other hand, to excuse debt as
mere thoughtlessness, as many upright
people do excuse It. is clearly absurd.
The renson of this divergence of judg
ment is, we think, this: Debt is a moral
disorder. If not in Itself of fatal import.
One or two attacks in youth have as n
rule no lasting effects upon character.
Again, debt is often symptomatic of se
rious moral disease, because it is a com
mon outcome of the selfishness which lies
at the root of all departure from a state
of moral health. Consequently the man
in debt, is much misjudgedâ most often,
perhaps', on the side If leniency. There
are menâ and they are almost always In
debtâ for whom the words "right" and
"wrong ' seem to be replaced by "penal"
and "non-penal." They owe money, but
that is perhaps the least thing they owe.
They never return kindness or help, or
Justice even, and certainly not affection,
should any one be so unfortunate as to
have let them have any. They behave
decently or not. according to the nicety
with which they are able to calculate
consequences.â London Spectator.
"A plant that Is Its own gardener is.
you would think, an impossibility," said
a peanut dealer. "In the peanut, though,

It were, with a spade. The peanut grows
In the air and sun, but when the flowers
fall off nnd the pods appear it is neces
sary for these pods to mature â¢ under
ground, and therefore the plant buries
them. It buries them with a movement
of the stalk, a downward bend that
pushes the pod beneath the soil. This is
a strange thing. to see: it makes a pea
nut patch well worth a visit. Go to one
of these patches at the season when the
flowers are falling.-, and if you are pa
tient you may have the luck to catch a
plant in the very act of burying Its pods.

The Board of Public Works will hold a
special meeting to-morrow morning for
the purpose of revoking all permits here
tofore granted for the occupancy of, any
sidewalk by bootblack stands. The board
has already inaugurated a crusade under
the supervision of Officer Beach against
the stands, twenty of which have been
removed from various parts of the city
to the corporation yard.
Before proceeding against the rest of
the stands which are illegally occupying
sidewalk space Commissioner Mdnson
thought it advisable to rescind permits
granted under an ordinance of the Board
of Supervisors, which the Board of
Works, however, always regarded as il
legal and was sustained In this conten
tion by a Superior Court decision. After
th" permits are revoked Beach, with the
assistance of two laborers, will continue
the demolition of the stands. About nine

MARY CHARLOTTE ARMS
CONTESTS MURPHY'S WILL
Accuses Mary Robertson of Using
Undue Influence Upon the
Deceased.
Mary Charlotte Arms, granddaughter of
John Murphy, who died in August of last
year leaving an estate worth $20,000 to his
two grandsons, John JÂ£ and William T.
Gavlgan, is dissatisfied with Murphy's
disposition of his estate and has Inaug
urated a contest of his will. The contest
was filed yesterday.
The contestant alleges that Murphy, for
weeks prior to his death, was under the
influence of oniates and was in no con
dition to make a will. She says that be
cause of his condition he was amenable
to the suggestions of i Mary Robertson,
who, the contestant alleges, used her po
sition in the Murphy home to prejudice
the dying man against all his relatives
but his grandsons. . :
FANTASTIC JEWELRY
WORN BY MEN
Anklets and â¢ Bracelets and Evtn
Necklaces Among the Things
Affected bv Them.
Jewelry Is becoming more fashionable
for male wear every year, said a West
End goldsmith to the writer recently, and
a novelty will probably- have a more ex
tensive sale among men than among fair
jewel wearers of the opposite sex. We
ourselves keep an expert at work design
ing eccentric trinkets which are likely to
catch the fancy of our Yale customers.
The personal jewels of some peers are
worth fabulous sums, those belonging to
the Marquis of Anglesey being valued at
.â¬40.000.
The anklet Is becoming more popular
among men every season. It is worn just
above the boot, and generally consists of
a gold chain of fantastic design. Fifteen
guineas Is no uncommon price to pay for
one of plain gold, while those in which
jewels are set command anything from
Â£30 to Â£150.
The male craze for wearing bracelets
is steadily growing. King Edward wears
one on his left wrist Just out of sight,
which Is valued at a large sum. Gold
curbs are the most fashionable, but some
men prefer a bangle in which a minia
ture surrounded with brilliants is set.
There Is a large demand for such brace
lets this season, and they realize Â£30
each.
The fob chain is coming into favor
again and is generally of gold, handsome
ly embedded with jewels. The gold seal
at the end has now given way to all sorts
of fantastic adornments. For instance,
an officer lately home from South Africa
had a bullet which had been extracted
from his arm after an engagement set
In a fob chain and surrounded with emer
alds. He paid Â£130 for.it. Jeweled fobs,
however, frequently command as high as
Â£200.. 'Â¦&Â£';
Necklaces are, being very largely worn
by men. A popular design is a gold chain
with a heart amulet attached, set with
pearls or brilliants, and the market price
is from 30 to 50 guineas, but in some
cases a locket containing a miniature
takes the place of the amulet. They are
worn Inside the waistcoat, with the chain
showing over the shirt front.
One of the finest pieces of male Jew
elry "I have seen was. a gold snuffbox
made to the order of a French lady of
title for her lover some months ago. The
box was only four Inches long by three
inches wide, and was handsomely en
graved, but the most remarkable feature
about it was that when opened a spring
set in motion a tiny musical box which
played one of, the most delightful selec
tions from "The Bohemian Girl."â Tit-
Bits.
To ordinary eyes a man 1000 yards away
âsay on a rifle rangeâ appears as a dot.
He could not "be shown as a man except
as being a smaller dot than a horse.

SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS
JUDGMENT OF LOWER COURT
Defendants Hold That Claim of
Bank Is Barred by Statute
of Limitations.
A judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of the Commercial and Savings
Bank of San Jose vs. John A. Horn
berger and Kate Ilornberger affirming
but modifying the decision of the lower
court was given yesterday. The defend
ants appealed to the Supreme Court on
the ground that the claim of the Com
mercial and Savings Bank of San Jose
against them was barred by the statute
of limitations, and further claimed that
erroneous attorney fees had been allowed.
The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment
of the lower court that the claim of the
bank was not barred by the statute of
limitations, but allowed that erroneous
attorney fees had been allowed to the
amount of $400.
Bishop Talbott of the Episcopal church
has a ready wit. While in Wyoming not
long ago a cowboy who was slightly in
toxicated rode up and said: "Hullo! I'm
glad to see you. Where in did I see
you before?" The Bishop quietly an
swered: "I am not sure, my friend. From
what nart of hades do you come?" The
Bishop called recently on Archdeacon
Radcllffe of Stroudsburg, Pa.,, and said:
"Are you well. Archdeacon?" Dr. Rad
cllffe said he never felt better. "I ara
glad to hear you say so." said the Bish
op, "for I want you to work like the
devil." The Archdeacon looked shocked,
but Bishop Talbott added: "You know
the devil is always working."
The Kansas City Star has begun suc

The paper is made from pulp shipped

The cowry shell came to have value In
much the same way that value has been
attached to gold. It waa regarded by
the West Africans who saw It as a con
venient form of money; but it was diffi
cult to obtain It. The cowry shell la
found only on the coasts of a number of
islands off the southwest shores of India.
It bad to be carried thousands of miles
to the west coast of Africa, where therÂ«
was a demand for it, and so real value
became attached to it and it could bo
used as money.
When the world's supply of coal is ex
hausted, which is not a matter of imme
diate worry, the eucalyptus tree, may be
grown as a substitute. The eucalyptus
stores ud more of the sun's energy than
any other tree (1 per cent of that re
ceived on the unit of area), and in South
Africa it has been found cheaper to raise
it than to import coal. An acre of eu
calyptus plantation will produce each year
the equivalent of thirty tons of coal.

H. Thompson and his wife Gertrude are
the plaintiffs in a suit for damages filed
yesterday against the Sharon Estate
Company, proprietor of the Grand Hotel.
They ask for $*>000 damages and costs of
suit, alleging that through the careless
ness of the defendant corporation Mrs.
Thompson was severely injured.
According ta the complaint, the com
pany's carelessness consisted of keeping
in room 212 of the hotel a defective chair.
Mrs. Thompson occupied the room from
January 1 of this year to January 13. On
the evening of the last named date she
retired to her room and proceeded to take
what comfort she could out of one of
the chairs in the room. It suddenly broke,
precipitating her to the floor with such
force that her hip was dislocated. "

CAUSE OF A DAMAGE SUIT
She avers in her complaint that Mrs.
Loughery separated from her husband iri
the eatjy '70'f, and that when she, the
plaintiff, was born Mrs. Loughery was
living with her parents. This was in 1S>79.
and, al!rge s Miss Crowe, the deceased re
mained vrft>i her folks until June 1838
when she bought 'the Pine street prop
erty and moved there, taking the plain
tiff with her, the understanding being

DISPUTE OVER PROPERTY
REVEALS FAMILY SKELETON
hnne E. Crowe Says She Is Entitled
to Realty Left by Wife of
E. J. Loue-herv.
Mrs. McLran evidently agreed with the
floctor at this time, at least so far as the
suggestion of divorce is concerned, even
though she did not take steps to procure
ane until seven months later. She makes
no ppecific complaint of the treatment
accorded her by her husband from' Janu
ary 10 until Aprl! 15. It was on the latter
33te, she alleges, that he completed hrr
misery and drove her to an appeal to the
rourts by demanding that slie should con
sider his every expressed wish as a com
snr.d.
f f xr WANT you to understand now
C C 1 1 that I propose to have my
! I every expression of a wish
â¢^*- treated as a command without
question from you."
Thesp are the words accredited to Dr.
Robert A. McLean, professor of surgery
at the University of California and one
of tbebest known and most skillful phy-
Flrians on the Pacific CoajÂ«t, by Viola A.
McLean in a complaint for divorce filed
by her yesterday. They were uttered, ac
cording to her complaint, last April, or a
Utt'.e more than a year after she became
the physician's wife. They cut her to the
quick, pays Mrs. McLean, and because she
is a highly-strung, proud and sensitive
woman caused her the most intense
mental anguish. It is because of these
words and others alleged to have been
used by the doctor during the course of
his very short married life that she wants
her freedom. Incidentally the wants $500
a month alimony and permission to re
sume her maiden name, Glrvin.
It Is only too evident from the com
plaint that the marriage of Dr. McLean
to beautiful Viola C. Girvin waa not pro
ductive of happiness. The blame for it is
laid at the doctor's door by his wife, as
in her complaint she alleges that ever
Fir.ce their marriage, January C, 1902. he
has Fpoken to her only in the most
abrupt manner and in a way that
chocked her and caused her keen mental
figony. She says that at times he has
also been profane, and was frequently
discourteous, with the result that she
fears to live longer with him will seri
ously endanger her health.
Their first open rupture occurred Janu
ary 10 of this year, when Dr. McLean, she
alleges. Informed her that she was not to
dare to have an opinion of her own.
"You are always," she alleges he said
on this occasion, "expressing your opin
ion about matters and offering objections
to my commands. You are to have no
opinion except- my own. A wife should
have no opinion except her husband's,
and unless you surrender yourself com
pletely to me we Fhall have to have a
Jlvorce."

WHILE'the dread forces of insurrection and revolt that are disturbing the Balkan states
with pillage, arson, battle and massacre hold public attention by reason of the frightful
atrocities committed and the lurid tales told concerning them, let us not wholly overlook
the unhappy fate of the dwellers in high society, for they, too, are suffering because
insurrectionary forces are invading their peculiar realms, storming their holy citadels and doing a
Cakewalk in their sacred ballrooms. " â¢
We need not dwell upon the fearful stories that come from London telling how the haunts of
the nobility are thronged by aspiring plutocratic Huns from the wilds of African gold fields, or the
dangerous depths of Chicago stockyards ; for these stories are like chestnuts and have whiskers on
them as stubby as the spikes of a chestnut burr. London society, as we know, has long since been lost,
and only now and then there arises-out of the discordant din of the invading hosts some feeble wail
of one of the good old aristocracy, to remind us that it was ever a temple of the elect and the festival
ground of a beauty and a chivalry.too good for common clay.
It is more interesting to note that the invading hosts, having overrun London, are now pour
ing their forward floods over Berlin, while the recoil is spreading disaster over Newport. Advices
from each of those courtly centers are distressing, and it is .impossible at this distance to decide with
any approach of accuracy which of the two is suffering most. Berlin complains that, the Kaiser has
entertained a Vanderbilt, and that seems dreadful ; but on the other hand Newport complains that
the haunts of the Vanderbilts have been profaned by persons fresh from lamb-fleecing in Wall street,
and that is worse.
One of the wretched sufferers in Berlin, complaining bitterly of the Kaiser for receiving the
barbaric hordes from America, says: "If the whole Four Hundred should visit Germany in a body it
will be his policy to entertain them as if they were all descended from Charlemagne. Any Senator,
Congressman, State Governor, judge or colonel may count on the same magnificent hospitality. Even
Tammany would be received with open arms. The noble company of free lunchers should make all
haste to Germany for the autumn holidays and a round of official feasts. The Kaiser keeps open
castle, and they can order what they please."
The assertion that the Vanderbilt hordes from the United States have invaded Germany
as "free lunchers" is of, course nothing more than the natural exaggeration of a storm-tossed heart. It
may be described as "the language whose excess imparts the power they feel so well," and accepted as
convincing evidence that the cakewalk has stepped heavily upon the gouty toe of German pride.
Listen next to the wail of woe from Newport. Several of the most indomitable leaders of the
exclusives have abandoned that place to the invaders and have fled to the inner lines of intrenchment
in order to hold there the citadel of society secure against the oncoming hosts of bulls, bears, porkpack
ers, land boomers and Indiana poets. The complaint is that Newport is "full of parvenus," and it must
be remembered that in the language of Newport "parvenu" is as much a term of reproach' as is "free
luncher" in Berlin. So the one place not only suffers as much as the other, but is as loud in its wail.
It is quite probable that in the near future we shall hear similar stories -from Vienna and St.
Petersburg, for the invading army of free lunch parvenus is marching eastwards That being so, the
only sure place for society is San Francisco. Here in a balmy climate where every prospect pleases,
there will be freedom for all from the interloper, and should the worst come, the exclusives can find
a last refuge on the Farallones. ( - ;:- : fsÂ£-i.
SOCIETY IN DISTRESS.
A Philadelphia clergyman lunching at
the Catholic Club recently was asked to
set an estimate on the expenses of . the
late conclave in Rome for the election of
a successor to Leo XIII. He goes to
Rome at least once a' year and is on fa
miliar, terms with many of the -under
functionaries of the Vatican.
"I can't Bay." he answered, "as to the
cost of the conclave that chose Pope Plus
X. but I do know that the conclave of
1878, which resulted in the election of
Leo XIII involved two 2>Uls, one of $11.
574 28 for carpenters' and masons' work,
locksmiths, painters, gas. glaziers and
electric bells: . the omer. of $1000 (or fit

dirt cheap compared with the- figures for

Leo XII were responsible for $127,702 and
$98,423, <Â¦ respectively.' These conclaves all
took place. during the .last century; but

longer and more freauent. so that It was

Other novels which have kept in the
forefront of demand are "Pigs In Clover,"
"Four Feathers," "In the Guardianship of
God," "Lady Rose's Daughter," "Park
Papers" and "My Lady of the Bass."
Two biographical works have also tak
en a big share in making July such a
satisfactory month for thÂ© trade. These
are "Letters of a Diplomat's Wife" and
"Orrery Papers," by the Countess of
Cork.
Preparations are now begun for the au
tumn publishing:, but they cannot be said
to be going forward very actively.
There is nothing the publishers dread
so much as a general election, especially
if it be suddenly sprung upon them. Last
time It resulted in tremendous losses for
those who had many books in the press,
and now the rumors of a general election
before the close of the year, even though
little or, no reliance may be put on these
rumors, are. having a very disquieting ef
fect on publishers, who say they might
as well stop the presses . and give the
bookbinders a vacation at a season when
books have to give way to newspapers.
Publishers' minds are also running on
politics for the present, for they are
much exercised as to the effect a pref
erential tariff would have on their trade.
A great portion of the paper they use is
manufactured abroad. If this were taxed
home made paper would go up .in price
and the adjustment of the burden between
publishers and book buyers might be dif
ficult, if not embarrassing..
Among the books now printing which
promise special interest Is the volume of
"Reminiscences of Sir Montagu Gerard."
It will deal with his remarkable experi
ences as a soldier and huntsman of dan
gerous game. He Is a great sportsman.
He took part in the Abyssinian and Egyp
tian campaigns and In that against Arabl
Pasha. He has enjoyed unusual facilities
of exciting sport, principally with pl&
In fact, tlftre has been quite an aver
age sale for the month. This is all the
more satisfactory considering theTe has
been really nothing that could be term
ed unusually sensational to create a spe
cial demand. The sales In fiction, partic
ularly the six shilling novel, have been
rather above the average for July. The
consensus of booksellers' opinion Is that
the leading item of fiction has undoubted
ly been Neil Munro's "Children of the
Tempest," while another of the most
popular current issues has been "Eliza
beth's Children."
L.ONDON, Augv 22.â Now that the
booksellers have had time to
take stock of business during
July, they find It haa not been
so bad as was feared it would
turn out to be.
He next devoted h!s attention to the
discharges of electricity through highly
rarefied Rases, and to the development of
the theory he had formed in the course
of his previous experiments with thal
lium of the existence of a "fourth state
of matter."
The name of Crookes will forever be as
sociated with his remarkable discoveries
In connection with radiant matter arid his
evolution of the genesis of elements. The
results of his researches In highly rare
fied tubes caused him to assume the ex
istence of matter in ultra-gaseous form,
to which he applied the term of radiant
matter. He explained the novel phenom
ena of phosphorescence, trajectory ehad
owb, mechanical action, magnetization
and Intense heat possessed by matter in
ultra-paseous etate. It was a remark
able discovery that stormed the BdenUflc
world, for it was of enormous range, as
the discoverer conclusively proved by
demonstrating: that -while some radiant
matter was as stable as a chair, other
forms were of the character of radiant
energy. It was the fringe where matter
and force appeared to merge Into each
other.
Though at first received by the scien-
His has been a remarkable career.
Sir William Crookes is a born scientist.
He played with chemistry in his infancy,
practiced it during his youthâ much to the
discomfiture of his parents, whose goods
and chattels suffered from the effects of
his experiments â and has developed It
ever since. He is now in his seventy
first year, having been born in 1S32. At
16 years cf ace he entered the Royal Col
lege of Chemistry as a pupil of the fa
mous Dr. Hoffmann, and acquitted him
eelf with such distinction that two years
later he was appointed Hoffmann's as
sistant. In IS:* he obtained the much
coveted post of superintendent of the
royal meteorological department of the
Radcllffe College of Oxford, which post
he subsequently relinquished In order to
devote his entire energies to the pursuit
of chemistry. With this view he accepted
the professorship of chemistry in the
Training College at Chester In 1S35.
"Scientific men are very like pavlors;
they lay down stones for future gen
erations to walk over, and wear out."
Such Is the presient explanation of scien
tific research and pursuit of a new dis
covery, expressed by Professor Sir Wil
liam Crookes, F. R. S., the eminent Brit
ish chemist. Science, although it pos
sesses a bewitenmg glamour to its disci
ple. Is yet a lenoly occupation. Great
ideas and pomsibllities of the hitherto un
known, drawn upon the mind of the chem
ist, only to be followed by years of pa
tient Investigation, ceaseless experiments
and roDcatftd failures. When an epoch
making discovery bursts upon the Â¦world
not an evanescent thought Is bestowed
upon the years of protracted labor and
Intricate calculation? that such a discov
ery" has entailed. Sir William Crookes
can relate many such experiences. When
he discovered the new element thallium
he promptly set to work among other
numerous experiments to ascertain its
atomic weightâ 203.G42. The figures were
worked o*-t as far as the first decimal
point with comparative ease, but to de
termine the second decimal figure in
volved no less than two years of patient
labor.
His experiments with this new element
covered the period of eleven years from
1862 to 3873.
Professor Crookes' discovery of thal
lium, like Dr. Roentgen's discovery of the
X-rayf, was to a very preat extent the
result of an accident. He was engaged
in the examination, by the spectroscope,
of the residue which results from the
manufacture of sulphuric acid, when his
attention was attracted by a bright em
erald preen line which asserted itsejf.
This line had never been noticed before,
and he consequently followed up its ap
pearance, with tlie result that he suc
ceeded in ijeolatins: a new metal â¢which
he called thallium. The first piece of
this new element was placed on view at
the Great Exhibition in London of 1861,
and commanded universal attention.
It was the observation of certain anom
alous behavior of thallium when being
weijrhed In a vacuum, which he explained
as "expulsion from radiation." that led
to his invention of the radiometer.

away in his Laboratory with as much
energy and vigor as when he began his
first original researches fifty-two years

RECE-VT discoveries and events
in the scientific world have
aroused renewed Interest in
Professor Sir William Crookes,
who, thoueh in his seventy-
He has received many distinguished
awards In recognition of his many valua
ble contributions to science. In 1880 he
received from the French Academle des
Sciences their gold medal and a purse of
3000 francs; in 18S5 the Davy medal of the
Royal Society of Great Britain was be
stowed upon him. He is a royal medal
list, and his crowning recognition came -In
1897, when he was knighted for his
achievements by the late Queen Victoria.
The charm of Professor Crookes' char
acter is his honest, frank and simple
manner. He believes in the truth, and
is kindly and courteous to all those who
approach him. His laboratory is his ha
ven, and therein he passes the greater
part of his time among his retorts, spec
trographs, test-tubes and numerous other
scientific appliances, and what he regards
as much more Important, his extensive
library of works upon every conceivable
branch of science.
Professor Crookes is also deeply inter
ested in psychical research and lts^attend
ant phenomena, and is now endeavoring
to establish some connection between psy
chical and physical waves â to establish
the existence of "brain waves" to answer
the question, "What is thought?"
Owing to his immense knowledge, he Is
naturally associated with the leading
learned and scientific societies of Great
Britain, the presidential chair of many of
which he has occupied at one time or an
other. He has also made many valuable
contributions to scientific literature. His
best-known publications comprise: "Se
lect Methods in Chemical Analysis,"
"Manufacture of Beet-root Sugar in Eng
land," "Handbook of Dyeing and Calico
Printing." "Dyeing and Tissue Printing."
"The Profitable Disposal of Sewage" and
"The Wheat Problem." In 1859. he found
ed the Chemical News, and in 1864 he be
came editor of the Quarterly Journal of
Science.
In his presidential address to the Brit
ish association in 1898 he announced the
discovery of yet another number of the
rarer earthsâ monium or victorium.
The investigations of this eminent sci
entist have not been confined to a select
ed few of the many fields of chemical re
search, but to all its ramifications, with
the result that he has bestowed incalcu
lable benefits upon various manufactures.
He discovered the sodium amalgamation
process of. separating gold and silver
from their respective ores; he carried out
numerous experiments with M. Molssan's
method of the manufacture of diamonds,
by which our very limited knowledge of
the nature of this substance has been
considerably extended; he Is deeply inter
ested in dyeing and calico printing, the
manufacture of beet sugar and the deriv
atives of anthracene, while he is one of
the greatest authorities in sewage and ar
tificial fertilizers. In 1871 he accompanied
the scientific expedition to Oran, and in
1S66, when the cattle plague caused such
widespread alarm in Great Britain, he
was appointed by the English Govern
ment to report upon the application Â«f
disinfectants for arresting the scourge.
Perhaps his most famous invention fa
miliar to the lay mind is the Crookes
tube, by means of which Professor Roent
gen was able to make his famous discov
ery of the phenomena of the X-rays.
tlflc world with skepticism, the course of
time has proved that Professor Crookes'
thesis of 1S79 was no wild chimera of the
laboratory, but an Indisputable fact,
which opened up a fresh untrodden field
In scientific investigation. The existence
of matter in an ultra-gaseous state, the
existence of material particles smaller
than atoms, the existence of electrons,
the emanations from uranium and the
dissociation of the elements have now all
been proved to be one homogeneous the
ory by the remarkable discovery of ra
dium and the experiments with this new
element by M. and Mme. Curie, so that
what was twentr-flve years ago regarded
as Professor Crookes* dream has at last
been realized.
WILLIAM WATSON. AUTHOR AND POET, WHOSE EYESIGHT
THREATENS TO FAIL HIM, BUT FOR WHOSE AFFLICTION AN
/ EMINENT OCULIST IS DOING WHAT HE CAN.
Even if the experiment cannot be made now, it might be arranged for in future congests. The
issue is in fact the only one that now interests the mass of American yachtsmen. For more than a
generation we have held the America's trophy against all comers, and have Avon in most cases wkh
such ease that after the first race the remaining contests of the match were hardly worth speculating
about. To persist in conducting the matches in the old way will result in a diminution of public interest
in them, and perhaps lead to^ their abandonment. To introduce the proposed exchange of crews
would at once renew popular interest. There would be a double issue at stake ; in every contest. The
men as well as the yachts would be squarely matched against one another, and we should doubtless
have the satisfaction of proving our superiority not only in the construction of yachts, but also
in that of handling them in a race.
The one question of keen interest to yachtsmen now is whether the superiority of the Ameri
can competitors in the various races that have been sailed for .the cup is due to superiority of yacht
construction or to superiority, of seamanship. That question has been asked more than once, but no'
answer has ever been given, because no trial has ever been made to test the relative importance of the
craft and of the seamen. A good opportunity Â«is now afforded to put the question to the test of experi
ment. Were the American crew to sail Shamrock III and the British crew to sail the Reliance, the
comparative showing made in that race would go far toward solving the issue. , â¢ ~
The question of the comparative merits of the men and of the yacht has become more inter
esting of late because of the close, approach of the two yachts to similarity of construction. There is
no longer a British type and an American type of yachts to be matched the one against the Other. The
yacht builders of each side have borrowed the best points of the construction of the other, until now
there is no radical difference between them. In fact, the New York Sun recently said of Shamrock
III and the Reliance that they "are as alike as any two peas that ever came out of the same shell."
Such being the case it is quite probable that the success of the Americans in race after race should be
attributed to seamanship rather than to any assumed superiority in yacht building.*
It is an old saying that victory in battle is due not so much to the gun as to the man behind
me gun. The battles of our war with Spain appear to have established'that truth beyond the shadow*
of a doubt. Our warships were not much if any superior to Spanish ships, our guns were jiot better
and our ammunition was in some respects inferior. We won in every fight because our men were able
to handle their guns more rapidly and to shoot straighter than the foe. Tt was the men and not the
ships that made every battle of the war a new glory to our navy; and it is not at all uniikely that our
long series of yachting victories may be similarly due to our seamen more than to our yachts.
The question is sufficiently interesting to render it worthy of solution by actual experiment.
There would be an immensely increased interest in the coming races of this contest if an exchange of
yachts could be made and our seamen were given a chance to show what they could do with Lipton's
challenger. The very announcement that such a trial is to be made would have the effect of sending
a thrill of expectation through the country, and the match would be awaited with an eagerness that
has not been felt over a racing event in many years. g
ONCE more the American champion has beaten the British challenger for the America's cup.
It is true that only the first of the series of races in this, match has been sailed, but the
showing of the two yachts justifies public expectation that those, which are to follow will
have similar endings. As the affair stands* it is doubtful if the succeeding races between
the Reliance and Shamrock III, in the hands of their present skippers and crews, will be close enough
to be interesting, for there is hardly much excitement or even fun in a match where the conclusion
is foregone. . Â¦Â¦,â¢*;

DESERTED WIFE
IS PENNILESS
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 22.â Alarmed by
the recent Yaqul outbreaks In Sonora, the
Mexican officials in that State have de
cided on a policy -Which they believe will
prevent another Insurrection and perma
nently settle the question of dealing with
the Yaqui Indians which has so long
agitated the different civil arid military
Governors of Sonora. Tho policy Is said
to have been the outcome of correspon
dence which the Governor of Sonora re
cently had with General Torres, formerly
military Governor, but now Minister of
War for Mexico,
The plan of deportation of all Indians
showing any hostile Intentions which was
so effectively employed at the end of the
last rebellion will be, revived. Hereafter
when, any of the Yaquls working In the
mines or on the ranches are found con
cealing arms or are suspected of being la
sympathy with rebels or raiders, they
will be deported to Tabasco, Vera Cruz,
Chiapas and other places on. the east
coast from which they are distributed over
farms and hacienda3, fax. from their na
tive State and the mountains which they
know so well. Seven hundred Yaqula
were thus deported' at one time about a
year ago, and Btice then have given no
trouble. They were for the most pa^t
women and children, however, many of
them being, the survivors of ths massacre
In the Uvalama Canyon, when most of the
Yaqul men who were engaged in the light
were killed.
The Government will adopt a policy of
deporting entire families where the inem
bers of the family are suspidoned or
Sound turty of being In league with the
rebels and will thus avoid the breaking
up ol families so far as they exist. The
Indians are to be taken In transports
down the coast and after landing
will be taken under guard to the
east coast points from which they are to
be distributed. The haciendas on which
they are placed are so far distant from
each other and the country so strange to
them that all danger of an outbreak is
precluded. The policy will be Immediately
inaugurated, as the Yaquls In many scc
4-ions of Sonora have shown signs of rest
lessness.

Further argument in the case will be
heard on the 2Sth inst. Pending a deci
sion in thp suit the police will not be
restrained from arresting o*her violators
of the ordinance, as Judge Sloss modified
the alternative writ issued when Sing's
complaint was filed. It now applies to
Ah Sine alone.
Argument on the question of the con
stitutionality of the ordinance recently
passed by the Board of Supervisors for
the purpose of suppressing fantan play

Eloss* court yesterday.
Attorney George D. Collins appeared on
behalf of Ah Sing of 115 Waverly place,
who was arrested for violating the ordi

night for their destination. This will be
one of the most important conventions
ever held by, the letter-carriers aa well
as the last annual convention, as" here
after the conventions Trill bo held bien
nially. The two most important ques
tions to be considered will be the salary
measure, asking for an increase of $2t*
to carriers In the first-class cities, that
is at the beginning of the fourth year a
letter-carrier shall receive $1200 per an
num, and those of the second-class cities
$1000 per annum.
Another measure that will cause a great
deal of discussion is the retirement meas
ure, as prepared by the carriers of New
York City. There is also quite a warm
fight on hand for the next convention.
Portland, Or., is in the field and has been
making a strenuous fight for the honor.
Samuel F. Stevens, a member of the
executive board, located in this city, left
for the convention three days ago.

A struggle has already begun between
Southern and Central California to secure
the station. The Chamber of Commerce
of Pasadena and Santa Barbara have set
to work with a determined effort to ac
complish something. Central California
has done nothing thus far, but it is likely
to be heard from before the final decision
is made. Professor Stubenrauch natur
ally favors this part of the State, not only
because of pride in it, but because of its
fertility, commercial advantages and
proximity to the University of California.
Mr. Dorset inclines to Southern Califor
nia and will probably vote to build the de
pot there, so that there is likely to be a
deadlock in the committee. A third mem
ber will be required to settle the ques
tion.
California is about to become the depot
for seed and ! plant distribution for the
whole; United States. Instead of the work
being carried on by the many agricul
tural stations in the States the Depart
ment of Agriculture at Washington, has
planned to concentrate it in California,
and a large sum of money will be- spent
in the purchase of land for the cultiva
tion of plants and seeds and buildings for
their housing. .
The determination of the Department
of Agriculture to provide for this, enter
prise became known to-day through the
announcement of the appointment of Pro
fessor Arnold V. Stubenrauch of the ag
ricultural department of the University of
California as one of a committee of two
to select a site for the proposed station.
The appointment was made by Dr. A. J.
Pieters, head of tL'e division of plant in
troduction and seed distribution of the
Department of Agriculture, with whom
Professor Stubenrauch recently toured
the State. P. II. Dorset of Los Angeles,
the other member of the committee, was
also appointed to-day.
This committee is called upon to select
a site of 100 acres in some fertile and well
Irrigated spot in California. There a force
of men will grow plants and seeds under
the direction of the agricultural experts.
The Feeds will be grown for scientific pur
poses and distribution and it must be un
derstood that this work is quite distinct
from that of the annual Congressional
distribution of seeds. As soon as the sta
tion is built the work of distribution from
the various agricultural stations about
the country will be discontinued and seeds
will then be shipped to every part of the
world from that point. . .

Owing to business engagements that
will prevent him from attending to the
duties of treasurer of the general commit
tee,. Charles H. Turner of Alcatraz Parlor
tendered his resignation, which was ac
cepted with regret, and W. H." Hazell of
Pacific Parlor was elected In his stead.
A report from ' San Jose was that the
parlors of the counties south of the cele
bration city will take part in the parade
and that they will come up from their re
spective localities with bands playing a>d
banners flying.
It was announced that Tosemite,'GÂ«ne
vieve and Orinda parlors of the ' Native
Daughters will take part in the San Jose
parade and that the la<t named will be
the special guests of RIncon Parlor of
the Sons. '
' The matter of taking bands to San Jose
for the parade there was deferred until it
can be ascertained what music the cele
bration city will furnish.
None of the parlors heard from will
have bands in San Francisco's night par
ade because of inability to make satis
factory terms with the musicians/, but
California, RIncon, Alcalde, Olympus,
Presido, Army and Navy and Twin Peaks
parlors will have field music, and In view
of that fact it was recommended that the
general committee engage two bands, for
escort duty in this city during the paraQe
from Native Sons' Hall to the Fourth
and Townsend street depot on the night'
of September 8. The recommendation was
adopted. . The grand marshal reported
that there is to be a liberal display of

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 22.â An excellent
game of ball was spoiled to-day by the
senseless kicking of the players. Any de
cision of the umpire was a signal for a
wrangle, in Â¦ which Park Wilson and
Charley Doyle were the chief offeniers.
Doyle was eventually put out of the game.
It took an hour and ten minutes to play
three Innings. Barber made Jiis first ap
pearance in the box for the Seattle team
and was effective, except in the third in
ning, when he walked four men straight
and forced in a run. Baker pitched for
Sacramento and did excellent work.

The home: team- scored once in the first
when Shay hit and Meany sacrificed.
Shay then stole third and; arrived on a

on Shay's error. Hurlburt drove Francis
all the way to the plate with a double
to right. Irwln threw wild to Leahy, let
ting Holllngsworth in and giving Port
land one the best of it.

THE WHITE STEAM TONNEAU
Wins Six Cnps-Makes a Sweep at Del Monte Races.
The "White" Steam Carriage has long been known as the most reliable
car on the market. It has won first honors in all endurance Contests The
races at Del Monte, as well asthe races at Los Angeles last May show that
this c* is as speedy as it is certain. These races were all won by stock
cars, and it is now conceded that the "White" has the speediest as well as
the most reliable stock car of the year. . Those who have never experienced
the silent, easy running of the speedy "White" do not know the possibili-
ties of automobihng. Among its advantages are light weight, speed, power
economy large radius of operation, compound engine, condenser, chainless
drive and self-draining burner. Don't forget that this is a steam machine
without a boiler, and it does not require'an engineer either to run it or to
care for it. Simplicity of operation is one of its strongest features Write

Rheumatism never comes by accident. It is in '^^^^^^^^^ 00^^^^^ r
the blood and system before a pain is felt. Some ~ y '^' *^ Â¦ '
inherit a strong predisposition or tendency ; it is born in them ; but whether heredity is
back of it or it comes from imprudent and careless ways of living, it is the same always
and at all seasons. The real cause of Rheumatism is a polluted, sour and acid condition
of the blood, and as it flows through the body deposits a gritty, irritating substance
oi sediment in the muscles, joints and nerves, and it is these that produce th.e terri-
ble pains, inflammation and swelling and the misery and torture of Rheumatism. \a No
other disease causes such pain, such wide-spread
suffering. It deforms and cripples its thousands, HIS WIFE A GREAT SUFFERER.

and cutting, again dull and aggravating. The mus-.
cles of the neck, shoulders and back, the joints of the knees, ankles and wrista, are
most often the seat of pain. Countless liniments and plasters are applied to get relief,
but such things do not reach the poisoned blood; their effect is only temporary; they are
neither curative nor preventive. The blood must be purified, and all irritating matter re-
moved from the circulation before permanent relief and a thorough cure is effected, and no
remedy 'does this so certainly and so quickly as S. S..S.. It contains not only purifying
and tonic properties, but solvent qualities as well, all these being necessary in eradicating the
poison and making a complete and lasting cure of Rheumatism. S. S. S. cleanses the
blood of all irritating matter and the acid particles are
Â§4^*"â¢**^ ri ** a^| dissolved and filtered out of the system, thus relieving
K a e nmscles and joints and removing all danger of future
\Z?^V attacks. Under its tonic effect the nervous system re-

Â¦ .Whether you have Rheumatism in the acute or chronic stage, the treatment must be
internal, deep and thorough in order to be lasting. Never be satisfied with anything less
'than an absolutely perfect cure. This you can get by the use of S. S. S., the Oldest

Since last year 6,000,000 acres of new
land ha re been plowed up in the South
west .\rd this year Is producing Its first
crops. These crops are not large, by any
m#c*ns, but serve to increase the 'profits.
Last year we raised 2,500,000,000 bushels
of corn and 600,000,000 bushels of wheat
and nearly 1,000,000,000 bushels of oats.
The earnings on the farms of this coun
try last year were $5,200,000,000. Of this
sum $<O0,OO0,OOO was paid out to the work
ers of the fleld. Several million men and
women went Into the harvest and worked
three months gathering in the cereals.
It Is a more gigantic task than any other
single industry presentsâ that of harvest
ing the grain.â New York Commercial.
"What will the harvest show? What
was It last year? The actual profits of
the fanners In 1902 were in the neighbor
hood of $2,000,000. Not so' bad for^5,000.000
farmers, one would 'say â a trifle of Â£4tX>
each, writes a correspondent 'of the St.
Louis Globe Democrat, from the Western
wheat fields. How many professional men,
or even storekeepers, can say as much.
Mind you, that Is dear, profit, above all
expenses.

A curious example of the discoveries
which even at this time of day await the
antiquary In our old churches Is reported
to us. In the belfry of the little v51iaÂ»T5
church ol Heckfleld, about nine mileo oot
of Baslngstoke, there has b^en found an
old chest which Is undoubtedly one o' the
thirteenth oer.tury crusader's almschests
wtiich Pope Innocent IIIâ tha Pope who
laid England ur.der the Interact and de
posed King Johnâ ordered to be set in
every church In the Catholic world to re
ceive contributions for poor Knights who
went to the Holy Land to fight In the
crusades. This order was Issued A- D.
1399. These chests were to have three
locks. The keys were to be kept respec
tively by the Bishop, the parson and a
chosen layman, and the funds adminis
tered by the Knights Hospitallers and the
Knights Templars. On the lid of the chest
found at Heckfleld there is a slit for the
reception of coins. It has evident traces
of three locks, two being hasps with pad
locks and the other an ordinary lock. The
matrix of the middle lock is in the shape
of a crusader's swordY The dimensions of
the chest are: Height, including the legs,
H Inches; length, 3 feet lhi Inches; width.
17^4 Inches; depth of well, 11 Inches. There
Is a narrow Inner receptacle extending
over the width of the chest with a lid.
and the hinges are of wood. The chest
for many years has been used for storing
worn out service books and the old par
ish pall.â London Daily News.

Give me a man broken down from excessey, dissipation, hard work, or worry, from any cause, which has
sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice (or three mouths and I will make him as vigorous in every respect
at any nun of his age. , )
I will not promise to make a Hercules .of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and
sturdy. Even that man I can make better than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength
I can make as good as he ever was. I can give back to any man what he has lost by abuse of the laws of nature.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when
he went to bed, who is easily discouraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and
energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you' lose in any

Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who
has become discouraged from useless doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My belt has a wonderful influence upon fired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and sÂ£irs up a
great- force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty yean to perfecting it. I know
my trade. My cures after everything else has failed a're my best arguments.

shoulders, chest and side, Sciatica in his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour

They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has
not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt. - ""' â¢
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask any bet-
ter proof to make you try it? Is there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure, and as cheap
as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try it. In justice to yourself and to those
who look to you for their future happiness, try it now". Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be delayed.
. It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle,
glowing heat from it constantly, but no sting, no burning, as old-style belts.

Grace Williams, the girl who married
Chan On, a Chinese, has carried her point
and yesterday in Judge' 'Lawlor's court,
with the' consent of her mother, she was
allowed to return to her husband. The
matter was taken before the Judge about
three months ago on; an application by
the cirl's mother to have her sent to
some public institution with a view, td
having the marriage annulled. She was
sent to the House of Correction and was
twice called Into court to see if she would
give up Chan On and live with her moth
er, but she was obdurate, and yesterday
the mother acknowledged herself beaten
and the Judge dismissed the application.

Las^ Monday evening a tire broke out In
the basement of the store of Strauss & Froh
man, 101 Post street. The Fire Department
responded with their usual promptness, and
the result was that the damage was confined
chiefly to smoke. . After a week's delay, dur
ing which all business has' been suspended and
the store has been closed, a satisfactory ad
justment h*Â» been made with Insurance com
panies concerned, and to-morrow morning at
9 o clock the store will be. open for business.
At this time they will inaugurate a Fire Sale
in order to dispose of the $150,000 stock that
waÂ» damaged. They will also reduce prices on
everything in the store to make the sale still,
mere attractive. The fact 'that the stocE' is
almost new, having just arrived for Fall trade,
makes this sale an event of more ! than ordi
nai-y Interest to San Francisco ladles.

PATRIOTIC SERVICES
AT VARIOUS CHURCHES
The statistical officer urges that, hav
ing regard for the expense necessarily
entailed in the taking of any intermedi
ate census and to the great changes
which take place in London between the
decennial returns, the extra cost of a full
quinquennial census should not be al
lowed to stand in the way of its prepara
tion. Mr. Harper also emphasizes the ne
cessity of a day census of persons en
gaged in work in the county of London.
âNew York Commercial.
Glancing at the wage earners, ' we dis
cover something strikingâ that the num
ber of girls and women should be so
preat. In the county there are 2,394,456
females. Of these no fewer than 719,331
are wage earners. Allowing for children
under 10, this must mean that one in every
three is engaged in daily toil; 548,721 of
these are unmarried. The occupations
followed by women cover almost the
whole range of work. One girl in every
twenty between the ages of 13 and 14 is
a wage earner.
Of the persons under 18, three boys of
16 were married, and fourteen of 17 years.
Girls beat the boys in the matter of early
alliances. Ten of the tender age of 13
were wives, twenty-one were aged 16, and
no fewer than 164 aged 17. Speaking gen
erally of marriages of people over 20, the
figures show that the proportion to the
population in London has declined since
1871. This is demonstrated by the follow
ing table for London, showing the rate of
these marriages per 1000:
1R71-1S80 19-1
1SN1-1S90 17. Â«
1KU-1000 17.8
1WJ1 17.0
"These figures," writes Mr. Harper,
"are somewhat remarkable In view of the
prevailing impression that the marriage
rate furnishes an. indication of prosperi
ty."
The marriage statistics show that the
2,930,204 people over 18 years of ave in the
county of London In 1901 are classified as
under:
Male. Female.
Married 777,346 702.002
Unmarried 492.82Â«} 587.487
Widowed ..'. 72,128 197,51j
In the city the excess Is accounted for
by the number of male assistant* living
in drapery establishments; in Poplar and
Stepney by the male alien immigrants;
and In Woolwich by the arsenal laborers.
With reference to the Hampstead fig
ures and those of the boroughs where
the women are numerically stronger, Mr.
Harper gives an interesting table ot tnejr

A commentary on London and its myri
ads, based on the census of 1901 and other
facts and statistics separately obtained,
was issued recently by the London county
council. It Is the work of E. J. Harper,
the statistical officer of that authority.
After some interesting references to the
vast Increase in London's population, he
points out that London has also advanced
amazingly in value. In the city the rata
ble value per head of population was
Â£33 16d in 1S7L In 1901 It had increased to
Â£1SO 18s. For the administrative county
of London the value rose from Â£6 2s to
Â£8 14s In the same period. The question
of sex occupies some conslderaBle space
in Mr. Harper's commentary. In the coun
try the females exceed the males by al
most a quarter of a million, there being
1118 women to every 1000 men. Hamp-
Etead holds the record for the number of
women. Taking the same comparison,
1000 men could be mated, and still in
happy Hampstead there would remain to
every such thousand families 590 females.
Kensington comes next with 550 per 1000
over. Then follow Paddington with 340,
Marylebone with 800, and Chelsea with
250. The tables are turned in "the city,"
Poplar, Stepney and Woolwich, where the
men are In greater force. Of every one
thousand men in the city, fifty would be
debarred from matrimony owing to lack
of women, 10 in Poplar, 20 in Stepney, and
90 in Woolwich.

COMMENTARY ON LONDON
AND ITS INHABITANTS
One of the email but very curious mys
teries of the day Is the existence In the
mind of elmost everybody who uses the
telephone of a feeling that he has a spe
cial dalm upon the time and attention
cf everybody whom for his own interest
or convenience he chooses to "call up."
The man who seeks an Interview In the
old-fashioned way has no such feeling.
He sends In his card, usually with an ex
planation of his business, and then with
more or less patience waits until the per
son he wants to eee is ready to receive
him. The man at one end of a telephone
wire, however, demands that he be treat
ed on a "favored nation basis," and if he
Is kept waiting more than a few seconds
by the man at the other end he resents it
as a discourtesy. If not an actual wrong.
And the v-lephone companies themselves
seem to assume that each subscriber has
entered into a tacit contract to leap
riromptly to his instrument every time
the bell rings, and they scold him when
he doesn't do It. on the ground that he
"hurts the service." This assumption of
the companies is seriously â and therefore
amusirply â expressed by the American
Telephone Journal, which, after telling
how much better the telephone service is
nr>w than It used to bÂ«, proceeds to lec
ture the called subscriber for not doing
Ms to make It still more prompt.
"The average time." It says, "taken by
the subscriber to answer the telephone
bell Is still much greater than it should
be. and It still lies in the power of the
subscriber preatly to increase the ef
ficiency of the telephone service by cut
ting- this time down. Jt represents at ;
rresient the larger proportion of the total
time occupied in getting two subscribers
together on the telephone, and as long as
that is so It will remain a standing re
proach to telephone subscribers in gen
eral."âNew York Times.

While the time for the encampment
will be left to the council of administra
tion it was said that the date will be
given out officially In December' next.
There has been some talk about the en
campment being held In July, but It Is
almost certain that the great gathering
will meet in Boston Just one year from
the date of the encampment In San Fran
cisco.
The election of General Black as com
mander In chief of the Grand Army of
the Republic was frequently discussed,
and on every hand one could hear appro
bation of the choice.
Naturally most eyes were turned to the
encampment which will be held at Bos
ton next year, and the date of the en
campment was a matter which came un
der discussion.
Although every one had done his or her
best no one thought or felt that he had
done enough, though the veterans ad
mitted that they could never forget their
reception In the city by the Golden Gate.
At what had been the headquarters of
the Grand Army Just a few veterans sat.
They represented several of the East
ern States and were calmly discussing
the achievements of the week. Each had
prepared to return to his home a long
way off, but not without regrets.
The social advantages, the climate, the
whole life of California appealed to the
visitors, and on every hand one could
hear determination to some day return
to the Pacific Slope and everlasting sun
shine.
The headquarters of the Grand Army
and of the Woman's Relief Corps and the
Ladles of the Grand Army of the Repub
lic were all bereft of the busy throngs.
The hotel proprietors, the managers,
the directors and all connected with the
executive committees wore a depressed
look. No one was actually happy; no one
could be reconciled to the fact that there
would be a chance of meeting the na
tion's heroes in another year. It was
sufficient for Californlans to realize that
the gallant veterans who were leaving
for parts far remote to add to their de
pression.
Such a moving and replacing of furni

Veteran Is Badly Injured.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 22.â
Captain Harklns, a prominent member of
the Grand Army of the Republic, who re
sides at Menlo Heights, near the univer
sity, was seriously injured to-day as the
result of a collision. The old veteran was
driving to Palo Alto when a Menlo Park
coachman driving' a trap at a high rate
of speed collided with Captain Harkins'
buggy, overturning it. Captain Harklns
suffered a dislocation of his left hip and
will probably be confined to his bed for
several weeks.

FACTS ABOUT GLOVES
NOT GElTEBAIiLY KNOWN
ThÂ» principal material from which
gloves and mittens are manufactured is
the roans. Including all kinds of domestic
sheepskins. Horse, cow, seal; hog " and
dog skins were also used. A horse or cow
hide Is generally split up the back, and It
Is estimated that in each hide there Is
thirty, square feet. Mocha and imported
kid are used for fine lined and unllned
gloves for men, women and children, and
the domestic kid is made into the more
common varieties. The Cabretta and Bra
zilian sheepskins are cut into men's me
dium grade gloves for driving, while the
roans or domestic sheepskins are made
into men's low grade gloves and mittens,
the cheapest leather gloves manufactured.
The horse and cow hides and the goat
and seal skins are used as a substitute
for deerskins in the manufacture of men's
Imitation buck gloves and mittens. The
manufacture of ladles' fine gloves has not
yet been attempted to any considerable
extent In the United States. This Is due
to the fact that thus far glove manufac
turers here have been unable to secure
the finest gTade-of skins. Â¦'
Probably the most notable glove-making
machine is the multiple needle machine,
for stitching "the back of gloves, which
sews two, three, four and even six rows
at the same time. The automatic trim
mer, which is attached to the head, or
needle bar, of the machine, was intro
duced in 1893 and has greatly facilitated
the work, as It trims the leather much
better than do shears.
At various periods and in different coun
tries the glove has been the theme for
many fanciful and poetic theofios. It has
been a customary offering on occasions of
Joy and aorrow:tho pledge of friendship,
of love and of safety: the symbol of
hatred, defiance, humiliation and honor;
the token of loyalty and the tenure by
which estates have been granted or held.
The origin of the glove is unknown, and
its material history is not aided to any
extent by the history of the world Itself.
From all the evidence obtainable, the
glove probably constituted a part of
man's dress , from time immemorial. If
recent discoveries in the geological world
are to be credited, It formed part of the
costume of the prehistoric cave-dwellers.
It is suposed that the gloves of the cave
dwellers were made from roughly dressed
skins and sewed with needles made of
bone, and were not of ordinary size, but
reached to the elbows, thus anticipating
the multibutton glove of the Victorian
era. They were known to the Greeks and
also to the Persians and Romans. Among
the Greeks they were chiefly used by the
laborers as a protection for the hands in
gathering harvests. Among the Persians
and Romans they were-also worn as-or
naments, chiefly by the higher orders, par
ticularly the military. â¢
They were . considered a necessary ad
junct to the regalia of royalty, and they
were not generally worn by women until
about the period of the reformation. The
manufacture of gloves in the United
States dates from 1760. In the early period
of the industry the Indian process of tan
ning was exculslvely used. "Jhe distin
guishing feature of the- process was the
use of the brain of a deer, which insured
a durable as well as a soft and pliable
leather. The brain of a hog was subse
quently tried, but it was not entirely sat
isfactory, as it lacked certain properties
possessed by the deer brain. At the pres
ent time the sheep and lamb skins used
are received in what is known as "salt
pickle," which is applied to the Bkln after
thfe removal of the hair.
When the glovemaker gets the skins he
stretches them and then shaves them
down to the desired thinness, and then
they go to the cutters. From the cutters*
room the leather, .which has assumed the
shape of a glove, goes to the "silkefs,"
who embroider the back, and then to the
"makers." Some sew the fingers and put
the thumbs in, while others- welt or hem
the glove, around the wrist, and others,
called "pointers," work the -ornamental
lines on. the back.â Philadelphia Record.

Proposed Bond Election.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â The Committee on
Schoolhouses and Sites of the Board of
Education met last night in executive
session to consider the needs of the de
partment for increased school facilities.
The meeting was preliminary to the prep
aration of a report to the board with re
lation to the calling of a special bond
election.
More than usual interest attached to
the case because of the prominence of the
parties. The father was for many years
chief clerk in the customs department at
San Francisco and Attorney Whitney had
been his closest friend.
It was charged that Whitney had taken
advantage of his relations as attorney
for the estate of Miss Jerome's father to
Illegally take the ffioney and substitute a
promissory note for the coin. Friends of
the deceased Jerome took charge of the
matter and pressed it to the point of
causing Whitney's arrest.
' The charge of embezzlement against
Attorney Frederick E. Whitney, preferred
by Miss Ethel .Jerome, daughter of the
late E. B. Jerome, was dismissed to-day
by Justice James G. Quinn.
;Â¦ Miss Jerome testified that Attorney
Whitney 1 had made a settlement with her
of the amount Involved In her complaint
some $4000.
Whitney claimed that the transaction
which had caused the difficulty was a
business one and that no criminal intent
was involved. Upon the showing that
restitution had been made the case was
dismissed.

Jorgenson has agreed with H. H. Blrk.
holm, the Danish Consul at San Fran
cisco, to no longer delay his return by
allowing attorneys to bring further legal
actions In his behalf.
Consul Birkholm is authority for the
statement that two years* imprisonment
is the maximum penalty for Jorgenson's
offense, and if he pleads guilty this is
cut in half. Besides this all the time
that he has been held In Jail here counts
on his sentence, . so it is calculated that
if he goes back and pleada guilty the ex
tent of his Imprisonment will be about
eight months.
The proceedings in court this morning
were brief. Consul Birkholm was pres
ent and was represented by Colonel
Thomas H. Barry and G. B. Somers of
San Francisco, while Jorgenson's attor
neys were Messrs. Scott and Taylor of

In the linen taffetas a hitherto unex
plored field Is now opened for the lovers
of the beautiful in connection with the
summer coverings or slips. The light
brown or natural linen colored ground
work Is more durable for this purpose
than the white, and the all-over patterns
are the most economical. Roses tied with
ribbon knots, garlands of flowers with
stripes of Contrasting colors and conven
tional designs are some of the styles that
Rre pretty for slip covers.â New York

Cretonne has for a long time been used
for bedroom furniture coverings, but only
lately has it been adopted in other "rooms.
A daring use of a big flowered pattern
made up with red binding made a sum
mer parlor so distinctive that the idea is
worth repeating. Some of the art tick
ings have particularly pleasing designs,
small and well defined, that makes them
serviceable for certain pieces of furni
ture.
The ordinary gray or cream-colored slip
covers for furniture have been superseded
in the homes of those who know the lat
est and best fashions In house furnish
ings by attractive chintzes, linen taffetas,
art tickings and cretonne. The usual
spring cleaning has heretofore brought
out an array of somber toned coverings
that in some cases was retained far into
the winter, â¢ and even in a few Instances
only put aside for occasions of formal en
tertaining. Now, with the rapid advance
in making the interior of the house beau
tiful, even the details of summer furni
ture coverings are not overlooked.
The old-style Hollands, when adopted
merely as a protection, from dust In a
closed house, answered very well, but
many homes make only a pretense of a
summer closing, part of the. family re
maining and making use of the rooms.
Under these conditions a little thought
and expense should bring into the
changes necessary for the season not only
the comfort that is imperative, but an
artistic element as well. A new material
that gives a crisp appearance to the fur
niture when made up into slips Is a
French linen embroidered with tiny dots.
This comes in fifty-inch goods at $1 a

, 0. P. Beam has won a reputation surpassing that of any other artist
In this. country as a painter of fruit "Just Gathered" Is characteristic of
his best style, which does not depend upon imitative ability alone for its * .
excellence, ,but combines qualities of effect, composition and color har-
mony, which give his works a pictorial interest not usually found in. still-
life paintings.
In this picture the plums lie in the grass as if they had been freshly III
plucked from the tree, with the bloom still on them, while a ray of sun- l'|
light falling on some of them and on a portion of the grass gives effect ||
and variety of color to the composition. There is something infinitely P|
more pleasing in this suggestion of a natural environment than to the |j
- conventional arrangement of a still life with a meaningless background, Jj
which is so common in most representations of fruit and flowers. jÂ£j
"Just Gathered" was formerly owned by Catherine M. Whita of H- H
linois, who bequeathed it to the Chicago Art Institute, in whose perma- El
' nent collection it now is. "It was selected by a committee appointed by the <H
art institute, along with a picture by William Hart, from a number of- |]
fered in the bequest. fj

Fruit and Wheat Bulletin.
For the twenty-four hours ending 5 p. ra.,
I2!nb meridian time. Ban Francisco, Aug. 22:
Trading In fruits was active owing to the
additional requirements of retailers for the
Sunday trade, and fancy fruits, such as Straw
berry Freestone Peaches and fine wrapped
Bartlett Pears, met with a steady demand at
good prices. The general feeling, however, was
decidedly weaker than on the preceding day.
owing to the heavy supplies of poor stock, and
prices of the common run of . offerings tended
downward. Clingstone Peaches In small pack
ages were neglected and there was a sharp
drop In prices of both clings and frees In large
open boxes. The canners were handling only
email quantities' Of Peaches,- but purchased
freely of fine Pears and choice Egg Plums and
Silver Prunes. Common Apples continued ' very
dull and there was very .j little .- inquiry for
Plums in small packages. Figs were In free
supply and continued to sell at Irregular prices
as to variety and size of package, .while choice
Nectarines were steady at the . previously
quoted rates. No more Pomegranates came In,
but offerings that were received on the pre
ceding day sold slowly at 75cÂ®$l per box.
Quinces appeared from Sonoma County and
were offering at 65@75c per box, but as the
stock was too green to Invite custom few sales
were reported. Grapes were offering freely and
were moderately active at a wider range of
prices. The Wine Grapes . that arrived on
Friday, were selling slowly at $25@2G per ton.
The market was overloaded with Cantaloupes
and Â¦ Nutmeg Melons and some dealers were
trying to force sales by selling below the
quoted rates. Watermelons were active at
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.

NEW TGRK STOCK LIST.
Tb* Financier tuls week says: The most
striking feature of the statement of th* New
York Associated Banks last week was the in
crease of $9,599,300 In loans. This was ex
plained by the character of the business on
the Stock Exchange early In the week, when
there was large buying of securities for in
vestment and speculative accounts, calling for
Increased accemmodation from the banks. This
buying of stocks and other securities in the
previous week was also large, but lt was not
then reflected In the loan Item, as was ex
pected, for loans showed an Important decrease
It seems probable - that as ' loans must have
been largely Increased In the latter part of
that week through stock operations the loan
item was then made up on rising averages
which were reflected In this Item last week
The loans were also Influenced by the Important
Increase of $3,096,800 by tbe Western National
Bank of the United States, which increase was
probably due to operations Incident to the In
tended merger. The net cash gain by the banks
as reported by last . week's statement was
$2,106,400, while the estimates based on the
traceable movement of money during the week
Indicated a gain of $3,500,800. This Is not
only an unexplalnable discrepancy of $1,400 400
thown by these figures, but also the Important
unaccounted for difference of $3,700,500 be
tween the official and the estimated figures of
tbe previous week, which difference was not
corrected In last week's statement. The de
posits Increased $10,446,700, which amount is
less by $1,259,000 than that called for by tho
sum of Increase In loans and the net gain In
cash; hence the statement does - not balance.
The required reserve was augmented $2,611,675
through the Increase In -deposits; deducting
â¢NEW YORK, Aug 22. â The statement of
averages of the Clearing-house banks of this

Tomatoes were easier under Increased re

the previous high prices. There was quite a
surplus unsold at the close and choice stock
could be bought on the wharf In the afternoon
at 75c per box. String, Wax and Lima Beans
were In excessive supply and exceedingly dull.
Early arrivals of choice Green Corn met with
quick rale at full figures, but as much of the
stock arrived too late for the regular trade
and was of poor quality, tbe quotations still
had a wide ranee. Summer Squash was in
free supply, but moved freely at the long 1 es
tablished prices. Green Peppers and Okra
were a drug on the market and Cucumbers
ruled weak at easier rates.
River Potatoes were in ample supply and
dealers reported a quiet but steady market,
with prices Unchanged. \ There was very little
doing in the shipping line and the local trade
was of email volume, as usual on Saturday.
Salinas Burbanks were firmly held at the pre

With the ceffiation of the forced selling of
collateral out of loans, a violent rebound was
to bÂ« expected v. he;i the Ion? standing bear
account began to cover. With the satisfaction
of the demand from uncovered shorts it wm
natural that there should be augmented sell
ing pressure by those seeking to take profits
who had been buyers at the low level. The
market of the early part of the week showed
plainly enough that many of thÂ«EÂ« buyers at
the low level were capitalists of large re
sources and with skilled market managers on the
fio-r of the Stock Exchange to guard their in
terests. The upward rebound in prices was
thus prolonged to eome extent. Before the
middle of the week the manipulation had be
come violent and the uprush oi prices so fever
ish as to arouse distruvt. Subsequent events
proved that there had been very heavy profit
taking under cover of whipping up of the
market, and the supporting tactics were after
werd withdrawn. The reaction was correspond
ingly violent and sudden. Hut lt gavÂ« rise to
none of tb* uneasiness and rumors of busi
ness disantrs that had become so prevalent
at the lower levels of the market. The reac
tion was an admonition not to be mistaken that
the exigencies which were being prepared for
by the long liquidation were real exigencies
aaii that the rebcurciw provided to meet them
were not to be safely dissipated at once in
w!M speculation again. The course to be ex
pected cf the market In the absence of im
portant Influence* would be a lessening series
cf fluctuations followÂ«-d by a period of dullness
and sluggishness. The tightness of the money
market and the expectation of the early de
velopment of the reasonable Interior demand
for currency to move the crops are factors like
ly to tend to this result. The course of In
terior exchange during the week has pointed
unmistakably to the conclusion that money is
beginning to move from New York and that
the balance will shortly turn In favor of the
interior. A timely event in view of this de
velopment wab thÂ» arrival at San Francisco
of nearly $2,000,000 of Australian gold, which
was made Immediately available to New York
bar.k v series by telegraphic transfer through
the meOum of the Treasury Department It
so happened that in the final upward spurt of
prices en stocks much was made by the bull
leaders that the Colombian Senate had finally
rejected the Panama canal treaty and that
an agreement had b*en reached for the passage
through the coming session of Congress of a
comprehensive currency measure. The subse
quent news that the Panama canal treaty wag
still available for adoption by the Colombian
Legislature and the report that disagreements
would limit tbe possible action by the
next session of Congress on the currency
therefore disappointed the speculators who had
bought stocks on these accounts and aggravated
the reaction. The effect of the Panama canal
news was not due to any views held on the
larger political and commercial bearinjrs of
the project, but to Its probable Immediate
effect? on th<? money and exchange market
It was argued that the defeat of the treaty
would relieve a drain on the foreign exchange
markft to provide remittances In payment of
the $40,000,000 due to the Panama Canal Com
pany and the $10,000,000 due to the Colombian
Government under the terms of the treaty and
wouM leave the Treasury Department with re
s*r;rets to relieve the money situation. The
effect of the financing of these payments has
been a rather obscure problem In Wall street.
The foreign exchange rate has moved deci
sively away from the gold Import point during
the week, partly on account of protective
measures adopted by foreign money markets
and partly owing to large nellinff of stocks
her* for foreign account, London having Joined
freely in the movement to take profit on Iarge
accounts accumulated in the later stages of
our decline. There has been some brighter
feeling In the Iron trade, notwithstanding an
other cut In the price of Southern pig Iron,
as report* are had of some Increase In demand
at last appearing on account of the lower range
of prices. An advance In the price of copper
has also been an event of Influence on the
stock market. Railroad earnings have made a
satisfactory showing. Railroad officials \ con- '
tlnue. to express confident views of the outlook
for traffic. The business of the country at '
large f>eems to lie stilt unaffected by the con
traction In Wall street, with the exception of
Fcattered failures of some small banks through
the country which produced an unpleasant Im
pression.
Prices of bonds rose but slightly !n sympathy
with a recovery In clocks and have been cor
respondingly little affected by the reaction In
stocks.
Quotations on call for United States bonds
have been unchanged.
The upward reaction In stocks which devel
oped in tbe early port cf the month reached
its limit this week, and there has been a sharp
downward reactlua. Tlie successive tluctua
tioiis seem U> be the normal tequel to thÂ» pro

CHICAGO, Aug. 22â Trading in wheat was
of a very tame character. and prices were con
siderably unsettled. The opening was easier
under the influence of excellent weather In the
Northwest September being %c lower at
SO-Tfce. There was a fair demand the first hour
on fears of rain in the spring wheat belt an>J
the market turned quite firm. September ad
vancing to SOftc. but the general trend of crop
news was of a bearish nature ami free liqui
dation soon caused a decline. Liberal clear
ances and receipts of new wheat at Minneap
olis vrere depressing influences the latter part
of the session. The close was near the bottom
price of the day. September being %@Â»4c lower
at 70 74 Â©79 lie
Corn showed slight improvement on the easy
transactions but trade- was dull, with the bull
leaders making no special effort to support the
market and consequently prices soon turned
weak. 'September closed at 51%c. a loss of '/ic.
Oats were chiefly stlected by the liberal sell
ing on the part of a prominent interest. Sep
tt-mber closed %O>*,c lower at 34%&34<%c.
Provisions ruled firm Â«arly In the day on a
smaller run of hogs and better prices at the

The local market continues tame at un

stated In Bolton, de Ruyter & Co.'s wires:
"Market quiet and without material change.
Hogs are again a little higher at the yard*
and receipts at Western markets are rather
light. Markat shows very little snap, however,
and outside speculative Interests are Indiffer
moderate one and there is nothing urgently
bullish in the situation. There is every indi
cation, we think, that the receipts of hogs will
come again when the price suits."

CORN â There is nothing new to report. Tha
market continues meagerly supplied and firm.
The Chicago wires of Bolton. de Ruyter &
Co. say: "Market â¢ easier. Continued fine
weather throughout the corn belt Is the de
pressing factor. There is no change in the
trend of crop advices. . The bears are hopeful
that the prevailing fine weather will last and
will make a. fair crop and the bulls are equally
confident that the case Is hopeless. In the
meantime the cash situation seems about a
standoff and consists of moderate receipts and
a good demand."

THIS week we have disposed of six lots and
upon tbree of them we will at once begin
the erection of cottages. The buyers of
these homes have been counting up their
rent receipts and found, as all renters do,
that they have wasted more money in rent
than they could have purchased a home for.
It you readers are troubled the same way
turn a new leaf. It is never too late to do
Rood, and benefit tho*e dependins upon you.
Our terms arc most liberal, and as we own
lots in various parts of the city we . know
we can please you In location. We will
deal with you en a fair basis and. can con-
vince you of this fact.

M. Deniker, a well known French an
thropologist, has- recently shown that
while the individuals vary In height, the
average or mean height for the same peo
ple remains fairly constant. The lowest
statures -occur among the Monbutto of
Africa, the Negritos of the Philippines
(Asia), the Caribs' of Guiana and'Ven
ezuela (America) and the -Lapps of Scan
dinavia (Europe). The Tenggeras of east
ern Java, the Jews of. Russian Poland,
the Salches of British Columbia, the Mo
zabites of Africa' and the natives of New
Britain â¢ (Oceanica) are. not much taller.
All these peoples are below the mean of
1.60 meters. Above "thft . mean, come the
Aderbaidjanl of Persia and Transcaucasia,
the Kabarda of the Caucasus (Europe),
the negroes of the United States, the Ma
oris of New Zealand and the Ottawa In
dians. All these are ' below 1.70 meters;
Finally, the very tallest people are the
Cheyenne Indians ' of the United States,'
1.745 meters; the Peals of the French Sou
dan, 1.741 meters; the Tsigans of Russian
Turkestan, 1.719 meters; thÂ© Polynesians
of the , Marquesas Islands ' (Oceanica),
1.745 meters,. and; above all, the Scotch
agricultural class of Galloway, 1.792 me
ters. The "finest men," "according to our
authority, are the Gaiwegians, while the
smallest are the Akkaa - of . the Monbutto
country. The real "Brpbdingnagians,"
are j Scots, and the .'.'Lilliputians" ; are Af

The admiral could stand it no longer
and called the executive officer. Then he
learned that his mail had been given to
the orderly more than an hour before.
So the orderly was summoned once more
and asked 1 what he had done with the
bundle of papers. Immediately he went
to one of the small gunracks and got the
package. When asked what he intended
to do with it he explained: "When I had
time I was going to open them and what
I did not want for my own reading I was
going to give -to 'the other fellows."
And now the admiral -has mentally
framed this maxim: "When you are look
ing for an orderly don't always pick the
best looking man until you have had a
chance to talk with him."
Fifteen minutes- later he placed a large
dish of steamlng~oatmeal before the ad
miral. Saluting, he explained: " 'Tls all
the male I could find on board, sor; and
the cook didn't want to give it to me."
The admiral was so surprised he did not
know what to say. Finally he told the
orderly to take it away.
"Bring my .letters, letters; do you un
derstand?" he repeated.
"Shure, sor, I do," said the orderly,
rubbing his head in a wondering way. In
half an hour he returned with one of the
small "Jacob's ladders" and placed It on
the table before the admiral.
" "Tls the only ladder I could find, sor,"
he said.
Admiral Rodgers lately returned from
China to the command of the Brooklyn
Navy Yard. He always makes it a point
to select his aids and orderlies from
among the officers and men who appear
"well set" and well groomed.
One day on the. China station, while he
was inspecting . his flagship, the cruiser
Brooklyn, his eye fell upon a well-built
young man who wore the ..uniform, of a
marine. He wag well set and his uniform
was the acme of, cleanliness.' At once the
admiral concluded he had found just the
man he wanted to^tictj as hls'brderly, and
before ; the ' day had '"passed the marine
was assigned to that. task.
But it turned out that the admiral had
selected a raw recruit, a true son of Erin.
who knew- nothing of the sea or ships.
Pretty soon the admiral summoned him
and asked:
"Has the mail come on board?"
_. "Mall?" echoed the orderly, looking
thoughtful. "I dunno; I'll see, sor."

A NUMBER of residents of this city
met en the fourth Tuesday In July
In the Fraternal Eagles' Hall and
organized a new fraternal benefici
ary association called the Lions of Ameri-
ADMIRAL BODGEBS AND
HIS ITEW MlDEBIiY
Lions of America.
THE receDtlon that was given Au
gust 17 in Native Sons' Hall by the
local subordinates of the Young La
dles' Institute to the grand officers
of and delegates to the Young Men's In
stitute was one of the most delightful
functions ever given In this city under
the auspices of the Ladies' Institute.
More than S00 persons attended and the
major portion of the ladies were most
magnificently gowned. After the recep
tion there was a grand ball, the march
being led by Grand President Kelley of
the Young Men's Institute and Miss May
Stein, grand president of the Ladles' In
stitute, who were followed by more than
200 couples. The effect, as the marchers
followed the leaders in the various move
ments, was a very pleasing one. The af
fair, under the direction of committees
composed of members of the several sub
ordinates, was declared to have been a
most enjoyable one.

has been in the courts for months past
endeavoring to tie the hands of the Po
lice Department by Injunction proceed

pose yesterday. Judge Murasky decided
that Sellinger is not entitled to an order
from him setting aside the order made by
Judge Cook on June. 10 last, which order
stamped Sellinger's place as a den of in
famy and declared that the police had
every right to enter therein and make
arrests.
Sellinger appealed to Judge 'Murasky
within a few days after Judge Cook ren
dered his decision: He claimed that he
was. entitled to provisional relief on the
ground that pending an appeal to the Su
preme Court ho would be compelled ;; to
close up his place if the police were al
lowed to enter his place. Murasky ; held
in his opinion yesterday that 'he -was not
entitled to any , such : relief, holding that

v Jv L Wo . uld bo P' ease <l to have expression from
you bearing on this plan for securing a perma
nent supply of help, and will be only too glad
to u?e any practical ideas you may present
whether the same are applicable to the State
of California in general, or your section In par
ticular. . .
The California Promotion j Committee
makes announcement that it will attempt
to brine into. this State a class of per
manent settlers who are able to have
their own homes and at the same time
assist to gather the fruit crops of Cali
fornia. In furtherance of this the com
mittee has addressed a letter to farmers
in California, asking whether they are
willing to sell small tracts of land, from
one to fifteen acres in size, to Eastern
settlers with the understanding that the
settlers will owe their first services to
those who sell them land. , ,.]\
The committee elves out the informa
tion that this plan will prove effective
for the reason that a large proportion
of those who are now coming to Cali
fornia are buying small tracts and culti
vating them. The letter sent to the farm
ers is signed by Rufus P.' Jennings, ex
ecutive officer of the Promotion Commit
tee. The substance of It is as follows:
The efforts of this committee to obtain farm
help from the agricultural districts of the
Eastern States for the California fruit grow
ers and farmers of the State generally, have
resulted In the discovery that many farmers
and uielr families In the middle West with
some capital are ready to come to California
to engage In fruit growing and general farming
on a small scale if they can locate here under
deMrable conditions.
Dependence year by year upon a floating
supply of labor must ever be unsatisfactory
and uncertain and certainly undesirable. We
believe If these settlers and their families can
be distributed generally throughout the State,
The menaperie presented for inspection
and study this year by the Rlngling
Brothers is the greatest zoological col
lection ever brought together. As an Im
portant department In the biggest show
in the world it offers not only features
of Interest and wonder but recommends
itself pre-eminently as a superior source
of study and information. In point of
eize as well as in rare and exclusive
features It is beyond comparison with any
other animal collection In Europe or
America. It possesses many specimens
of rare .inimal life not to be seen in any
other collection that it is the most dis
tinctive menagerie in the world, and will
be seen In its entirety when the Ringling
P.rothers exhibit in San Francisco for
pight days from Monday. September 7
to Monday. September 14, inclusive The
giraffe, now almost extinct, is represented
by two beautiful types, a male and a
female. The rhinoceros is another fea
ture that cannot be seen with any other
chow. Explorers say this species of beast
has disappeared with the solitary excep
tion cf the one owned by the Ringling
Rrothers. The only baby elephant ever
l>om and successfully reared In captivity
in America belongs to this remarkable
exhibition. It was born January S. 1903
nnd stands no higher than its mother's
knee. This little midget of elephant life
is as playful as a kitten and is the pride
and net of the great herd of forty ele
phants in this extraordinary tented or
ganization. Naturalists, scientists and
students T.ill find many other specimens
of almost extinct types of animals. like
the eland, the vlack vlarck or South
America, the ?ak from the highlands of
Thibet, hippopotami as heavy as a good
fized elephant, huge polar bears â all that
is rare and interesting In zoologyâ is here
exhibited. Some idea of the immensity
:md completeness of the Ringling Broth
ers' menagerie may be formed from It3
comparative statement that no other me
naprerie contains more than forty cages
while the Ringling Brothers actually pos
sess 108 cages, tanks, lairs and dens con
taining three times the largest zoo the
Â» orld has ever seen. Nor is this me
nagerie the only wonder of the World's
Greatest Shows. Ringling Brothers have
375 of the most finished performers known 'â¢
to the amusement world, a new and glor
ious three-mile free street parade, a sub
lime and beautiful spectacular production
of Jerusalem and the Crusades shown on
Â¦ ho largest stage ever used for exhibition- :
tl purposes, the whole being transported '
from city to city In eighty-five double I

At the first meeting of the fall course
of the Corona Club of literary ladies, held
in Mission Masonic Hall in the presence
of a large attendance, "Vacation Expe
riences" were given by Mrs. Clare O.
Southard, in which she told of enjoyable
trips to Santa Rosa and Guerneville in
the company of the Mystic Shriners and
their families. Mrs. J. H. Bullock spoke
of the "Esoteric Fraternity at Applegate"
in' a very entertaining way. Mrs. James
Ralph Jr. in a very clever way gave an
account of a recent European trip.
Mrs. A. L. Sobey told of amusing inci
dents of a sojourn at Lake Tahoe and
added a number f>t exciting fishing ex
pciiences, proving conclusively that the
fish stories are not confined exclusively
to the sterner sex. Mrs. S. Martin spoke
a i some length on the matter of preserv
ing Telegraph Hill, and Mrs. Edward
Gore Denniston, president of the club,
was selected to represent the club with
the central committee that has that mat
ter in charge. The following numbers
were rendered: "Lift Thine Eyes," from
"Elijah." by Mrs. Burrill; trios by Mes
d:;mes Brace. Burrill and Norton, and in

CORONA LITEBABY CXUB'S
FIRST OF FALL COURSE
Unless the District Attorney appeals
Against the decision of the Judge to the
Supreme Court the case is closed. As
sistant District Attorney Whiting believes
that Judge Dunne would be reversed on
appeal, as he Is satisfied that the records
of the Civil Service Commissioners are
public records to all Intents and purposes
for the simple rejÂ»son that any officer
charged with pubiTC duties has an in
herent power to keep a record of his acts.
The District Attorney is as yet not pre
pared to say whether he will file an ap
peal so as to have the question settled by
the higher court.
Mershcn was arrested about two weeks
later by Detective T. B. Gibson and his
case was assigned to Judge Dunne's
court. When It was called Attorneys
Fuhrman and Bull, on behalf of the de
fendant. Interposed a demurrer to the in
dictment, the main ground being that
Walsh's paper could not be construed as
a public record. The Judge Instructed the
attorneys named and Assistant District
Attorney Whiting to submit briefs on the
points raised, which was done.
When the case was called yesterday
morning the Judge said he did not care
to discuss the many exceptions raised to
the indictment, as there was only one to
â¢which he had devoted any considerable
thought and attention and that was
Â¦whether or not Walsh's paper was a pub
lic record. It was his belief that It was
not a public record within the meaning of
the section under which the indictment
was found and therefore the demurrer
would be sustained.
John R. T. McrBhon. the former Civil
Service Commissioner, who resigned on
April 29 -while under a. cloud of suspicion
that he had been juggling with questions
to be put to applicants for positions In
the Fire Department, was fortunate yes
terday In having the demurrer to the in
dictment of the Grand Jury charging him
with falsifying a public record sustained
by Judge Dunne.
Among the applicants Â¦who took part in
the examination before the Civil Service
Commissioners for positions In the Fire
Department In March last wu W. B.
"Walsh. It was alleged that Walsh ob
tained less than 75 per cent on his paper,
but that Mershon altered the figures so as
to bring him within the eligible list. The
matter Â¦was laid before the Grand Jury
and on May 29 the Indictment was re
turned against Mershon.

Papers Are Not Publio

house party he attends. It is considered
that he pays tack his social obligations
when he asks his hostess to Include cer

to meet him.
In all the great English houses the King
is practically at home. His own servants
attend him. His own waiter hands him
his food, as the same waiter does, for
the matter of that, at every dinner his
Majesty attends in town or country.
When the King dines out so
also does his chief â¢waiter. At
the country houses his Majesty simply
takes possession and has all meals ex

are his and so are the servants, the
horses and everything else about the
place so long as he remains.
A number of the English nobility, nota
bly the Dukes of Devonshire. Westmin

much mere on lavish entertaining than
does the King himself. He has, at least,
no King to entertain, save on rare occa

young cellist Is among the most gifted

A clever move has been made by the
St. Cecilia choral Society in securing the
services of Mr. Walter Handel Thorley,
the English director, as their leader. Mr.
Thorley's work as a conductor, both
choral and orchestral, has the cachet of
the leading London critics, and under his
baton the society should do some excellent
singing.
A good chorus is one of the musical

and the author in his preface Insists, that

othrr man's wife."
"Therein he is by so mucn greater than
Carton, Â«f courser-"
"And by Â£o much less dramatically In

cinating little stutter that Mr. Miller
sometimes indulges in proved effective as
he Pitt the" following: "Love cannot be
crushed^ out of us by a few cynics, you
know. Lord, if that Interest were to be
taken out of our nature, what would be

life worth while. Think how dreary and
cold things would be without it. â¢ â¢ â¢
Dramatically, of course, the most appeal

than Dick Dudgeon, under the governance
of an abstract Idealism. He does to the

"And Shaw has succeeded here In the

"But Shaw has not succeeded in mak

regretted. Then he smiled and added:
"That will not worry Mr. Shaw, however.
He would probably regard it as signifi
cant of degeneracy to be rich. But â "
"But?" I prompted as the actor hesi

thought of saying."
"But we know you well enough here,

You know where the people go to 'hear'

is alwavs safe. There Is that kind of
audience at this theater. Your cultivated
interest is not divided among a score or

the piay-going public Interested In the

I knew that it could be absolutely de
pended upon to appreciate Shaw, In spite
of his play's lack of sentimental Inter

â¢<r HAD time only to remark how very
; well Mr. Miller looked and the actor
to reply, as we c*imbed the stairs
to the Columbia's â¢ business office,
that he feared only that the coming
by-and-by would bring "too much of
him." before the subject of the week,

"Well?" the actor smilingly queried,
placing himself at the little table whereat
I had chosen to siL
â¢'Well?" 1 replied, Irish fashion.
"Dudpeon?"
"Of course Dudgeon."
"Now 1 think," Mr. Miller eagerly be
jra.ii, I as eagerly listening, and for the
cat half hour there was nothing but "the
devil's disciple." Dick Dudgeon, his mo
tives and motif; George Bernard Shaw,
the cynic, idealist, wit: Bhaw and the
publicsâ particularly San Francisco's; the
artois ar.d Shaw.
The Fii!:Jfct is as prolific of discussion
as the famous "Head of an Unknown
Woman." as the heavyweight champion
ship. It is as fruitful of argument as the
race suicide problem, as provocative of
1 actions as the color question. Shall we
camp with Shawâ "better than Shake
speare?" â or stay in the Bard of Avon's
tack yard? And if not. why not? Not
that in "The Devil's Disciple" the fam

It is only in "Caesar and Cleopatra" that

istically sub-title "The Devil's Disciple."
Neither is this to say he would be wrong.
But Mr. Miller's "think" has been too
long left in air. It concerned the com
parison that has been maide between the
characters of Dick Dudgeon and Sydney
Canon in "The OaV Way."

Shaw loved him, dallied over him!
There's one line he has; you remember
itâ"
And together, for each is Jealous of Its
Joys, a tenor and a modest mezzo rap
turously quote: "I believe I am Gentle
manly Johnny, sir, at your service. My
more Intimate friends call me General
Burgoyne."
"That is Shaw at his Shawest," I laugh,
while Mr. Miller's chuckles subside. "It
isn't Wilde, it isn'tâ well, it couldn't be
anybody but Shaw."
Then somehow the subject of the "tim
ing" of plays came up, perhaps conse
quent on Mr. Miller's expression, "the
melodramatic tempo."
"It's the time! the time! and again the
time!" the actor raid, his brown eyes
flashing Inquiry as to my appreciation.
He beat a measure on the table and again
enthusiastically insisted: "It's the beat,
the beat. .Each play has its different ac
cent, like a piece of music. Get its
rhythm and all goes right. You know
you can take the finest muglc in the world
and the finest orchestra, but their effect
will be futile without the right beat."
Then marking off an explanatory trlan
glo on the table he went on: "A play Is
a three-cornered game. There are three
actors, two on the stage and on at the
front who paid to come in. Here's the
stage. The problem is for me to set the
tempo of the play so that my beat will
set the man In front pulsing, and he in
turn give the rhythm to the third actor â
the one with whom I am playing. If the
audience does not get the rhythm the ac
tor will surely lack the impulsive Impe
tus."
"How do you go about trying to make
the audience act?" I asked curiously.
"It is more a matter of instinct than
Mr. Miller laughed as he subjoined the
following testimony to Shaw's prejudice
for particular characters. "Ah, Bur-
Then Mr. Miller agreed that perhaps
the "engaging British notion of mascu
line supremacy" â the supposed masculine
monopoly of certain virtues, abstract
honor, abstract heroismâ had colored the
lady's portrait
"The character Is only a sketch," he
continued. "The truth is that Shaw has
tried to write a problem play in the mel
odramatic tempo. In melodrama there is
no time for character development. It is
away with the hero to the dungeon; to
the tower with the heroine; slap down the
pile driver; zip, zÂ»P. zip!"â to the ac
companiment of snapping fingers, "and
that's all. Think how Pinero would have
handled that final situation. He would
have given Judith a scene. All she has
to eay, according to Mr. Shaw, to explain
her doubt of her husband, her repent
ance, her remorse <or her sudden passion
for Dudgeon, Is, "Tony, I'm ashamed.' "
"And I argue that he did not love the
lady or he would have allowed her to
explain." I persist. "Think of General
Burgoyne."
"But Shaw sees what he paints through
the Shaw prismâ as Mr. Lackaye would
eay."

must be. Of course, don't you' know, if
we saw a fellow around with a dark lan

watches. And Dick has all the earmarks
of the passionâ Â«ven to Mrs. Anderson's
pretty puritan eyes."
"How contemptuously Shaw pictures
her, by the way."
"Do you feel that?" the actor queried.
"Â£haw seems to me to have seen before
him certain types and pictured them
without prejudice." #
" "Another , thing I . wanted to say was
that every one is very grateful to you
for producing 'The Devil's Disciple.' But
"But I knew." he said. "That is the
trouble of producing plays yourself. You
feel the whole performance on your shoul
ders. You, in , a way, act ; everybody's
parts, even the scene-setters'. Foolish,
no doubt." :
"But also you are spared the annoyance
of bad stage management."
"That is the compensation," Mr. Miller
agreed. "But come in again -In three or
four days. You will find a different thing.
I Know now where the laughs come, and
all sorts of those small things, that make

"I was thinking about thatâ or rather
something like it, this morning," Miller
said. "I wanted to get to rehearsal. The

this is a great big thing. Who are you

"Well, I did want to ask you." I said,
"if you were not rather nervous on your
first night? I thought you were, the new
play, the first night of the season and

acknowledged, clasping his sensitive
hands. "You see, we hadn't had . quite

In these days of big theatrical achieve
ments it takes many more people to fill
a cast than was the case in the old days.
Ten years ago a cast of twelve people for
a comedy or even an ordinary drama was
considered rather large. The public did
not demand so much as la the case now,
and they were more complaisant with re
gard to that old fashioned device of "dou
bles." It used to be no uncommon thing
for the hero to "double" the villain, or
for the lovely heroine to stalk on In one
or two scenes as her own mother. All
this is changed now. There must be a
separate actor for each performer, and
he must bo well fitted to his part in
every case. This makes the list of peo
ple a long one In plays which do not pose
as "spectacles" In the accepted sense.
Take "The Earl of Pawtucket." for In
stance. This comedy deals only with
personages such as you may meet in
New York or London every day. and the
story, while interesting. Is simple. Yet
there are no *ewer than thirty persons
engaged in the production, including the
stage manager and workmen who are nÂ»t
seen. It is conceded that a more smooth
ly working company has never appeared
on a New York stags.

supposed not only to desire this marriage

that She desires It immediately. Some

Marjorie, a debutante of this season, will
also be one of the season's brides. The

Just as they are. They are so free from
the pettiness which often characterizes
women who have spent their lives in the
Eoclal zoo that one continually hopes that
the new buds may prove exceptions and
keep the freshness that is their ruling
charm.
I regret to say. however, that some of
last winter's debutantes are already the
subject of discussion among their friends,
who accuse the newly admitted ones of
developing; "airs." I have in mind one
particularly attractive girl who came out
last winter and whose girl friends say
is now an "insufferable snob." The point
thefdrls make is that meeting people of
means has imbued her with the spirit
that makes for meanness; that she
didn't know many of the smart set a

whem phe did not know to receive at
her Jomir.g out tea. One debutante whom
phe met at a tea the week before as
sisted her in receiving and the rest was
smooth railing. One by one her old friends
have been not cnly dropped but delib
erately cut -whenever the fair climber was
in the company of new friends. At the
theater recently with the fair possessor
of a fortune she is raid to have commit
ted the crime of snubbing girls who had
befriended her In times past.
One debutante of last season caused
her friends considerable anxiety at first,
but is new getting over her "airs." and
eays thjt eld friends are the best. I
think this change for the better is due
to her charming mother, who has mended
her daurnter's ways. It would be well
if more mothers would instill loyalty and
sincerity alcng with etiquette while pre
paring their daughters for a social ca
reer.
