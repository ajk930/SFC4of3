Turkish troops have routed the Bulgarian
troops and have driven off three squads.
The report Is current that the Turkish
soldiers at'KIrk-Klllisseh, in Turkish ter
ritory, fired on- the. French consulate,

with them twenty Bulgarian women and

A Russo-Austrlan note to the powers
has been received here and Is now under
consideration. It sets forth that in the
event of hostilities .by Turkey and Bul
garia, Russia and Austria : will not give
their support to either of the parties, but
will hold each of them to a strict account

that France will adhere to the Russo-
Austrlan attitude.
PARIS, Sept. 14.â The Foreign Office ad
vices from Bulgaria show that the situa
tion is growing more serious, owing to
reports that the Turkish troops are slowly
nearing the border. If their advance con
tinues there will be a general mobiliza
tion of the Bulgarian forces, preparatory
to meeting eventualities.
General Mobilization of Bulgarian
Forces Is Probable.
TURKS NEARING BORDER.
. SOFIA, Sept. 14.â While it is
possible that a Turko-Bulgarian
war may even yet be averted, the
probabilities of such an encounter
were never greater than at the
present moment. The note to the
powers, the most decided step yet
taken by the principality, was dic
tated not only by the alarming re
ports of wholesale massacres and
devastation daily arriving, but
even more by the indifference of
the powers toward, the- severity of
Turkey's repressive measures.
People here consider that the
anxiety of the powers seems, to be
manifested chiefly in repeated ad
monitions to the Porte to suppress
the revolution with all speed and
energy possible. Telegrams from
Constantinople appear in this
evening's papers asserting that the
Emha^sador? -had urgÂ£d "tKcVSul
tan's Government to suppress the
insurrection without any,consider
ations of mercy and not to hesi
tate to burn and destroy the yil-
Jages or take any other steps
I which might be deemed necessary.
These dispatches, although of
doubtful origin and possibly not
worthy of serious consideration,
are not entirely out of harmony
with reports previously received
here.
The Bulgarian Ministry, there
appears to be little doubt, in face
of the strongest pressure from
within and : without, has endeav
ored to maintain strict neutrality,
but it appears very possible that
the Government may now depart
from this position.
They Continue to
Urge on the

1T*DFIA, Sept. 14- â The Bulgarian Government, through its foreign representatives, has addressed a note to the great pozvers, declaring thdt the Porte is systematically devastating Macedonia and massacring the Christian population.
lJ Further, it says Turkey has mobilized her whole army, which cannot possibly be for the sole purpose of suppressing the 'revolution. Therefore the Bulgarian Government appeals to the humane sentiment of Europe to prevent the
continuance of the massacres and devastation and to stop the mobilisation of the Turkish army. The memorandum concludes with the plain statement that unless the pozvers intervene, Bulgaria will be forced to take such measures
as she max deem necessary.

SAN JOSE. Sept- 14.â Miss
Hertha Page, a popular young
woman of this City.' has-mys
teriously disappeared and her
family and friends fear that
she may # have taken her life.
For some time she has been ill and de
epondent. Last evening at 6 o'clock she
left her home, 661 South Seventh street,
Â«n a bicycle to call on Mrs. R.' Lassere,
who lives on South Eleventh street, near
Margaret. Since then Miss Page has not
been seen.
Whether she called at the Lassere home
or not is not known, as the Lassere fam
ily was not at home at the time.. There
is no love affair in connection with the
girl's disappearance and her family is
troubled at the mystery. Miss Page acted
rather strangely in starting out and
seemed worried about something. After
the left the house she came back and
told her eister she wished there was an
other wheel, so that she could go along.
A few minutes later she returned again
and said she came back to pump up her
wheel. Her sister commented on this as
funny. aÂ» the wheel had Just been sent
from the shop, but Miss Hertha Page
said the wheel had a slow puncture.. She
then rode away In the direction of
Eleventh and Margaret streets.
All last night friends and relatives of
the girl conducted a search for Miss Page
and this morning her disappearance was
reported to the police and Sheriff. No
trace of her can be found nor can it be
learned that che called on any of her
friends. Circulars are being prepared to
be sent to the various towns of the State
in thfc hope that she may be found.

BULGARIA GIVES UP HOPE OF PEACE
NEW GRAND VIZIER OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE; BULGARIAN RULER WHOSE THRONE IS IN DANGER,
AND SCENE OF THE RECENT FANATICAL MURDERS WHICH RESULTED IN THE SENDING OF UNITED
STATES WARSHIPS TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF FOREIGN RESIDENTS.
The Sofia correspondent of the Times
telegraphs that the situation has changed
distinctly for the worse. He says:
"The powers appear to be pursuing the
Barne tactics which preceded the Greco-
Turkish war, and the result prdbably will
be similar. Instead of taking steps to
check the barbarities committed in Mace
donia they have allowed matters to drift
and are now trying to find a remedy in
useless and irritating admonitions to the
Bulgarian Government. Count Lainsdorf,
the Russian Foreign Minister, and Count
GoluchowBki, the Austro-Hungarian For
eign Minister, have expressed to the oth
er powers that an identical note should be
etnt to Turkey and Bulgaria, warning
them that in the event of war neither
combatant can expect aid from the great
powers, and that the Austro-Rusilan re
form scheme will be maintained and the
Ftatus quo preserved."
It is stated in Vienna that the repre
sentatives of the power* have advised the
Sultan to withdraw the Albanian redlfs
from Adrianople on account of their law
lessness:
The correspondent gives an authenti
cated case of the massacre near Monastir
of thirty Inhabitants, who yielded on the
strength of HUmi Pasha's proclamation
guaranteeing their safety.
An Athens dispatch says that Premier
Rail has formulated a demand for the
punishment of the Turkish leaders re
sponsible for the pillage of the Greek vil
lnges in Macedonia and the murder of
their inhabitants.
A dispatch from Monastir to the Daily
Mail denies that the insurgents have been
terrorized or dispersed by the Turkish
troops. They are merely biding their
time, it cays.
It is announced in' Sofia that Prince
Ferdinand will return to the Bulgarian
capital from Euxinograd in a few days,
when the Government will take some de
cisive step.
The Daily Mail understands that the
British Cabinet yesterday resolved upon
naval co-operaticn with the powers in
Near Eastern waters, and that British
warehips will shortly appear at Salonica.
The Turkish Embassy in London has
again issued a long statement warning
the public against the unfounded reports
and slanders from Bulgarian sources
dally appearing in the London daily pa
pers, and denying seriatim the reports of
Turkish atrocities and Ait Turkish
troops have been ordered 10 cross into
Eastern Roumelia In order to cut off the
insurgent bands, etc. The statement fur
ther gives accounts of Turkish successes
against the Bulgarian "brigands," repre
sents the bands as demoralized, hiding
and surrendering, and asserts that the
Bulgarian inhabitants of the Ottoman
provinces who joined the bands are now
imploring the imperial clemency and are
surrendering the arms distributed to
them by the revolutionary agents.
LONDON, Sept. 15.â The note sent by
Bulgaria to the powers, declaring that
unless the latter intervene In Macedonia,
Bulgaria will be forced to take such
TnÂ« atarrs as she may deem necessary, is
raid to be a prelude to the mobilization
of the Bulgarian army unless Europe ex
erts herself in some way to prevent a
conflict There is probably some connec*
tJon between this eventuality and the de
cision of the revolutionists to revert to
guerrilla tactics, which may be In order
to reserve their resources for co-opera
tion with Bulgaria.

Special Dispatch to The Call
"At trie time of my divorce- from the
woman." said Lamenstrof, "I made spe
cial efforts to secure the custody of the
two children. She made a strong fight
for the possession of the children and
during the last three years wrote sev
eral times to me, threatening to take the
boys from me."
"We were coming home from school
when a woman stopped us and asked us
where we were going." Ed ward, said to
night. "I didn't know her and was scared,
when she spoke to us. She asked; where
we lived and said if we would come with
her she would buy us some candy and
some nice clothes to wear. Then I ran
away. I saw the woman walk away with
Charley."
Detectives were given a description of
the woman and were Instructed to watch
the railway stations and search trains
leaving for the West. The woman it is
said, is unacquainted with Chicago' hav
ing lived all her life In California, and it
Is believed that she will remain in hiding
In Chicago.
According to the story told by Lamen
strof to the police, he was divorced from
his former wife In San Francisco several
years ago. At the time or their separa
tion he was given the custody of his sons,
and after that his wife, he said,. made
several attempts to take them away from
him.
The father, Joseph Lamenstrof of 34
Marion court, was notified of the kidnap
ing by his remaining son. and the police
of the West North avenue station were at
once asked to begin a search for the
woman and child. It was learnea mat she
visited a store on Milwaukee avenue and
purchased clothing for the boy. but no
further trace of her was obtained.
With the boy when he was met by the
woman was his brother Edward, two
years his Junior. The latter, who had
not seen his mother since he was 3 years
old, ran when the woman stopped them,
but his brother was stopped and has not
been seen since by those searching for
him.
CHICAGO, Sept. 14.â Traveling half-way

gaining her ends. Meeting her oldest
child, George, a boy 8 years of age, on the
highway going home from school she in

the father nor the police had succeeded In
finding any trace of the pair up to a late

Special Dispatch to The Call.
When this matter became a subject for in
vestigation I began to think that Dosslbly I
had been Indiscreet in taking- such an active
interest In the device, but it never occurred to
me that my actions could be construed as being
criminal In any way. At the very most I
thought I might receive a censure, and did not
feÂ»-l that that would be really deserved.
Imagine my consternation then when con
fronted with the fact that an indictment hart
been returned against me .Â¦ charging me with
felony, i I have . no fear of the outcome of the
prosecution because I have not been criminal
in the slightest dejeree. But over and above
this I have been pilloried and dismissed- after
an honorable service extending over, sixteen
years, and my punishment now is far greater
than any fault I may have committed.
The whereabouts of . Richardson is the
topic of conjecture among the postal em-j.
ployes here. No one seems to know when
he will return, and It is only guess where
he Is now. Telegraphic advices asserted
that - K e ; left Washington more ! than two
weeks ago. Since then his friends in Cal
ifornia profess not to have heard from
him. He ; is, said to have , family connec
tions in the State \of Washington, and he
may have-gone there for a visit. It Is
probable -he will delay his return to San
Francisco as long as possible, as he'can
not certainly be anxious to face the storm
of disgusted disapproval that will un-
I have been perfectly frank In all my state
ments made in connection with this charge and
I have endeavored to conceal nothing. I have
admitted accompanying Richardson to Wash
ington In 1899 in the interests of the patent
device, 'the disposal of which caused the storm.
I received leave of absence from the depart
ment, and In my application for leave I frank
ly set forth my reason for asking: for It. In
Washington I Introduced Richardson to forty
or fifty postal officials and assisted him In
showing the device and urging its advantages.
I took a good deal of pride in It because of my
participation In its Invention. At that time it
never struck me as being in any way culpable
to advance the interests of something that I
felt, and still feel, .is a decided advantage to
thfc service.
Contrary to expectations, the indict
ment found by the Federal Grand Jury at
Washington against James W. Erwln of
the postal service in this city was not re

curing the custody of the accused man,
and nothing will be done until to-day,
when In all probability the papers will be
received.
In the meantime Erwin is awaiting pa

be released on bail. Although it has been
announced by telegraph that Postmaster
General Payne has forwarded Erwln's
dismissal from the service no t>fflcial no
tice of such action has been received in
this city.' Erwin is Inclined to credit the
report of his dismissal, but until he is
officially notified he is continuing in ac
tive duty, a and reported at the office of the
inspectors yesterday and performed his
accustomed routine.
When he arrived at his desk he found a
large bundle of letters from influential
persons all over the State offering him
sympathy and whatever assistance he
might require in the matter of bail or
funds. In addition he was in receipt of
numerous telephone messages during the
day from wealthy friends expressing
their utmost confidence in his integrity
and soliciting some opportunity of show
ing their good will toward him in the
present difficulty.
.'As .tears, gathered in his eyes and his
voice broke, Erwin said yesterday:
Never before did I realize how many good
friends I have. This is a cruel thing. During
all my long service I have taken such a pridÂ«

It was found as a result of last year's
maneuvers that for the maneuvering of
large bodies of men in the working out of
tactical operations the present reserva

War Department has succeeded In ob
taining the wrltten.consent of several land
owners adjoining the reservation, whose
aggregate holdings amount to about 41,249
acres, to the military authorities entering
upon and occupying their holdings when
ever it may become necessary to do so in
the prosecution of the maneuvers thia
year at a nominal rental of 5 cents per

it was decided that the air of California

brother-in-law of the bride, who lives In

prevented a speedy marriage but the fact
that Pond was suffering from consump

disease and many specialists were visited.
At last it was decided that Pond should
go to Liberty, N. Y. Feeling that she
could best serve the man she loved as hi3
wife. Miss Klins consented to have tha
marriage take place at once, so on Feb

The deceased left several letters to va
rious friends, and in one to the Consul
General states that he could not boar
the disgrace attendant upon his arre=t
and trial in the police court and felt
that he had lost prestige in the eyes of
his countrymen. The dead man, who was

COULD NOT BEAH DISGRACE.
A number of theories In regard to the
murder have their supporters. It is
thought by the officers that robbery was
not the motive for the crime, notwith
standing that some $50 or $60 was taken
from Kuhnle. It is stated that Kuhnle
a number of years ago was Involved in
quarrels with some of his neighbors and
that some bad feeling was engendered,
but It Is thought that any difficulties of
that nature have been healed by time.
Some hold that the deed was committed
by a discharged workman. The officers
state that some local difficulty Is at the
bottom of Kuhnle's murder.
The funeral of the murdered man took
place here to-day and his body was
followed to the grave by 'a large
number of sorrowing- friends. Feeling is
running high in the neighborhood of his
home and It 13 thought that the, officers,
should they apprehend the murderer,
would have considerable difficulty in get
ting him to a safe place.
PASO ROBLES, Sept. 14.â The officers
who are searching for the man who as
sassinated Char Its P. Kuhnle on the read
about seven miles from this place a
couple of nights ago, appear to have
made considerable progress and it is not
Improbable that an arrest to-morrow will
be the result of their endeavors.
Sheriff Ivlns of San Luis. Obispo County
and Deputy Sheriff McFadden, who is as
sisting him on the case, will not give tfie
name of the person who is under suspi
cion, but that he Is in or near Paso Ro
bles is not doubted. During the entire
day. the Sheriff has been busy In the ac
cumulation of fragments of evidence, and
it is reliably reported that they furnish
adequate ground for the arrest of the
man suspected.
It was intended that the arrest should
be made about 2 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing about the time the southbound train
passes through, but the Sheriff afterward
deemed it advisable to defer; action until
a later hour. So completely had arrange
ments been made that the prisoner was
to be hurried away before the people of
Paso Robles could learn of the 'arrest,
taken to San Luis Obispo and thence to
Templeton, where he might be safe from
any possible demonstration on the part of
angry citizens, j There has been a deal of

Secretary Ow Yans King stated that it
had not been decided whether an autopsy
would be allowed or an inquest held.
Coroner Leland will no doubt attempt to
exercise his prerogative relative to in
quests and autop.-:ies and interesting oe
velopments are likely to ensue. Ow Yang
King declared that the relatives of the
deceased thought that undue haste had
been exercised in removing the body to
the Morgue.
According to international law the con
sulate can be properly termed Chinese
toil, and In the event that the Coroner is
refused permission to hold the Inquest
there appears to be no aJterr.a.tive but to
refer the matter to the United States au
thorities for adjustment. It is understood
upon Rood authority that the matter of
the arrest of Tom Kim Yung has been
referred to the Chinese Minister at Wash
iiigrton. and redress will be asked from
the United States Government. Mem
bers of the diplomatic corps are not
amenable to arrest, and as the dead man
came under this head the arrest was ille
gal. The accusations made by Patrolman
Kramer are denied by members cf the
CONSULATE CHINESE SOIL.
Although in the form of a request it
was evident that the presence of a legal
representative and the Consul General Im
plied a. demand, which, .f refused, might
cause international complications. Coroner
Inland was communicated withand sanc
tioned the removal of the body. An un
dertaker was summoned and the Consul
remained until the body was in tho con
veyance and on the way to the con

to dine with relatives on Dupont street

ordered a servant. Lpe Yut. to go to the

failed to elicit any response and the door
was found locked. Lee Yut reported these
facts to the Consul General, who went in

The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devoto their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and tho
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â "^ Syrup of Figs"â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig" syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
.they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. p'rinted on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages, only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Coney left his family behind him. Fre
quent inquiries at his home on Post street
failed to reveal his whereabouts, his wife
professing her belief in his statement
made before he left town that he was go
ing direct to the southern republic. It
was claimed by a few of his friends for a
time that his recall to Mexico would be
followed by an appointment to some high
er diplomatic office, possibly the Consul
Generalship In New York. This claim
was based mainly on the fact that Coney
many years before had saved the life of
President Diaz and that the latter had re
warded him with the local appointment
and had promised him further advance
In tho consular service. When, " however,
it was learned that Coney had not gone
to Mexico and the stories of alleged mis
use of consulate funds were circulated the
colonists began to realize that the long
existing friendship between the President
and his San Francisco representative had
been broken. Since then Coney has been
regarded in the light of a fugitive. Fre
quent stories have come from Mexico that
the missing man was wanted by his Gov
ernment, but in response to Inquiries
made at the consulate, the only official
source of information here, Consul Gen
eral Zayas Enriquez has repeatedly stated
that he-had not -been advised of any In
tended move on the part of his Govern
ment toward apprehending Coney, but al
ways adding that if^stich a^move was to
be made he would not necessarily be ad
vised of the fact/ Yesterday the Consul
General made the same statement.

It is now said that the cigarette trade

tured by America. It is the old story
over again â surplus stock sold at ruinous
prices. Ten American cigarettes done up
in a box can be bought to-day in any In
dian bazaar for half a penny. ',/..
Coney had never - obeyed the Instructions
of President Diaz to report to the latter,
but had quietly left the city by some
route unknown to his friends and eventu
ally reached New York, where he was
afterward seen by several persons of this
city -who happened to be In the Bast. By
this time stories' to the effect that Coney
had failed to account for more than $15,000
handled by him during the last few years
of his official career in this city were
freely discussed in the Mexican quarter.
The greater portion of this sum, It was
said, represented money collected from
shippers and held here subject to orders
from the home Government, which fre
quently draws upon its foreign Consuls
for sums needed to meet obligations else
where. Another charge made against the
missing man, and one that has since been
substantiated, was thaN Coney had bor
rowed large sums from various firms. on
the pretext that the money was~needed
temporarily to meet local Government ob
ligations. These sums he failed to re
turn, and in one or two cases the persons
or firms which advanced the money called
cm him and threatened to expose him to
his Government if he did not immediately
make good the amounts.

This document will form ; a strong link
in the chain of evidence against Mrs.

rious prescriptions -he had written for
Bowers and they were filed as exhibits.
PRESCRIPTION WAS FORGED.
Eight days after Bowers left the Waldeck
he was in the same condition as when he was
in the sanatorium. On August 14 I found him
considerably worse. He tvas . vomiting ' and in
great pain. He was doing fairly well when he
left the Waldeck and there was nothing in the
medicines prescribed to cause the change that
took place. v^SS"
I had consented to Bowers . being removed
from the Waldeck to his home on condition
that he was given the t>ame treatment as - In
the sanatorium, but it was evident -that he had
not ' been given the treatment I expected. I
asked Mrs. Bowers if she had given , him the
medicine and food I had ' prescribed and she
â¢aid ehe had. but that her husband was vomit
ing and could not take the medicines and food.
I thought it strange, Â¦ as Bowers : had taken
the same treatment at the sanatorium.
The symptoms of the rase indicated an acute
case of gaetral intestinal trouble, caused by
ptomaine poisoning. All the symptoms of pto
maine poiBonlnK were present. These symp
toms are similar to arsenical poisoning and it
18 Impossible to differentiate the two without a
complete history of the case.
I prescribed for him, among other thing*.
twelve GroBS pills, each containing one-twen
tlelh of a grain of arsenic. He was to be
given three of these pills each day and when
he left the Waldeck Mrs.' Bowers' took with
her enough pilla to last for two days. . After
I visited Bowers at his home Mrs. Bowers
asked me if she could have the prescription
for the pills made up at a near by drug store
and I consented. > ,
Dr. Alfred McLaughlln testified that he
attended Bowers from July 6 until Au
gust 6 at the Waldeck Sanatorium and
for eight days after Bowers was removed
from the sanatorium until he died. He
said:
Dr. John Gillen testified that he was

MANY DOCTORS TESTIFY.
The evidence given by Dr. Carl von
Tiedemann was that . he had attended
Martin L. Bowers on June 5 and 9, Of
this year, being called in at the request
of Mra. Bowers. The witness detailed
the symptoms of the patient and said
that he had diagnosed them as ptomaine
poisoning caused by eating tainted food?
He based his diagnosis on the symptoms
presented, and also 'on the history of the
case as furnished by Bowers and his wife.

physicians proved that Bowers' death had
been caused by the administration of ar

shed tears.

, This evidence was followed by that of
Dr. Morgan, who gave his expert testi
mony that the finding -of four eralns of
arsenic in the stomach of Bowers, cpu
pl*d with the fact that he was given con
siderable . drinking water on the day of
his death, tended to* prove that much of
the arsenic administered had either been
carried Into the bowels or into the circu
lation of the body. Dr. Morgan further
testified that he had made tests of. the
bedsbeets used by Bowers and had found
arsenic in thn stnfns of vomit -and ex
creta on the linen. .
The evidence of Dr. C. L. Morgan and
of Professor .Frank E. Green proved con
clusively that Martin L. Bowers was
murdered by the administration of arse
nic in large quantities. The two scien
tists testified to having made an exami
nation of the stomach of Bowers 'at the
request of the Coroner and of finding
more than four grains of white arsenic
In the same. Both of the witnesses tes
tified that the quantity of arsenic found
In the stomach of Bowers was sufficient
to have caused death, two and' a half
grains being estimated to be a fatal dose.
The prosecution brought out the fact
that Bowers must have had administered
to him considerable of the deadly poison.
The evidence of Dr. Louis I. Breistein and
of Nurse Car! Schmidt of the German
Hospital was that on the morning of Au
gust, 25 last Bowers was taken from his
home to the . German Hospital and died
at the. institution at half past' 4 'of '.that
day. These witnesses testified that Bow
ers was given from four to six ounces of
drinking water every half hour for five
hours on the day of his death.

AVOIDS MEXICAN CAPITAL.
Then came a brief dispatch from Wash
ington that he had been recalled to the
City of Mexico, and Inquiry at his home
on Post street brought the response from
a member of his family that he had al
ready started on his southern journey. As
weeks passed and no formal notice was
issued from the consulate, as is the usual
diplomatic custom, announcing the fact
that another was occupying Coney's of
ficial place, ugly stories began to be cir
culated, and they continued the rounds of
the business firms and the places fre
quented by local Mexicans until a month
later, when a telegram was received from
the City of Mexico that President Diaz
had appointed R. de Zayas 'Enriquez,
member of the Mexican Congress, to suc
ceed Coney.
All attempts to learn the cause of
Coney's recall from official sources failed,
for the man who was temporarily in
charge of the consulate declined to be in
terviewed, and when the new Consul Gen
eral arrived here he professed entire ig
norance of the causes, although admitting
to several of his new made friends that
Â¦when he left the Mexican capital there
was considerable talk there about Coney
and strong intimations that he had been
guilty of flagrant violations of the trust
reposed in him by the President.
The announcement from Washington
that the Mexican Government is seeking
former Consul General Coney in no way
surprises the members of the local Mex
ican colony. Coney's sudden departure
from the city about five months ago was
attended with as much mystery aa was
his unexpected recall to the City of Mex
ico, to which, however, he never went.
For months preceding his retirement from
the local consulate, which he had occu
pied for fifteen years, there had been
scandalous stories afloat concerning his
alleged misuse of the authority reposed
in him as the representative of the Mex
ican Government, and it was no secret
among- the more prominent Mexicans that
several petitions had been sent to Presi
dent Diaz to replace Coney.
One afternoon there registered at the
Palace Hotel a man who represented him
eelf as an official of the Mexican customs
department, claiming that he was on hid
way borne from special duty In the East.
Two days later Consul General Coney
called at the Palace Hotel and was clos
eted with this mysterious individual for
several hours. Three days after this
meeting Coney suddenly left the city.

CHICAGO. Sept. 14.â An age of a racÂ«
of giants Is about to be ushered In again.
Henceforth there will be no pigmies, for
a wonderful food substance has been dis
covered that .makes men and animals
growâ grow fast and large.
Myths that have come down from an
cient days tell of races of giants which
inhabited the earth or dwelt on the isl
ands of the sea. History as constructed
from old records and folklore is filled wuh
stories of Hectors and Herculeses and Go
llaths and Samsons and Cyclopses. Sci
ence has proved that the animals of the
earth were once far larger than at pres
ent, and in museums muy be seen skele
tons of mammoths and mastodons that
lived on prehistoric earth and of awful
leviathans which dwelt in the seas there
of. â¢
The giant men and monstrous animals
may all return again as a result of the
newly discovered food substance which
stimulates growth so rapidly. The new
food is lecithin. Its wonderful Qualities
have Just been demonstrated by a series
of experiments conducted by Dr. Shin
klshi Hatal, professor of neurology at the
University of Chicago. Dr. Hatai experi
mented with white rats and by feeding
them lecithin made them grow 60 per cent
faster than rats grow ordinarily. Scien
tists say that lecithin will have similar
effect on human beings.
Lecithin iÂ», according to the definition
given- by Dr. Waldemar Kock, an "or
ganic phosphorusâ containing the body
found in eggs, brain matter and the white
corpuscles of blood."
The professor's experiments show that
the growth induced by lecithin is normal
and healthy. It stimulates all parts and
organs of the body exactly alike, thus
acting unlike other stimulants which af
fect different organs of the body in differ
ent ways.

\\\, WASHINGTON. Sept. 14.â The Mex
ican Minister has beea advised by the
State Department of his Government that
the officiate of that country are anxious
to locate the former Consul General to
the port of San Francisco, A. K. Coney,
and the various consulates throughout
the United States have been instructed to
make inquiries concerning the missing
man. Although the representative of the
Mexican republic here would not discuss
the matter this afternoon, the statement
was Indiscreetly made by one of the at
taches of the legation that Coney is
charged with the wrongful use of money
belonging to his Government during his
term of office in San Francisco, and that
the, moment he is located a move will be
made for his apprehension. It was inti
mated that Coney was last seen In New
York City and that detectives employed
by the Minister have reported that they
expe-ct to have him within a week. The
fact that Coney has been In New York,
living quietly at a small hotel, was de
veloped by detectives in San Francisco,
who watched his house and finally got
trace of him through his mail.

BUFFALO, N. Y., Sept. 14.â Sir Thomas
Upton passed through Buffalo to-day en
route to Chicago and was sufficiently re
covered to see newspaper men. He was
questioned regarding the invitation he
was alleged to have received from the
Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club.
OYSTER BAT, Sept. 14. â President
Roosevelt to-day approved of the Issu
ance of a formal statement of the facts
concerning the Seawanhaka Corinthian
Yacht Club dinner incident,- which haa
created so much unpleasant comment.
Colgate Hoyt, chairman of the board of
trustees of the yacht club, visited Oyater
Bay this afternoon and had a conference
with the President for half an hour.
President Roosevelt expressed regret that
any published statement of the dinner in
cident should have placed him in 'a false
attitude, and, with a view to relieving Sir
Thomas Llpton of embarrassment because
of the statements that he had treated him
with discourtesy, he authorized Hoyt to
make a plain statement of the episode.
This evening Hoyt prepared and Issued
the following:
There has been t>r> much misunderstanding
over the proposed annual dinner of the Sea
wanhaka Yacht Club that I feel it my duty at
chairman of the board of trustees to state the
facts, vl*. : That the President was invited
by me to be the g-ueet of the club at its an
nual banquet and he accepted with the distinct
understanding that it was not to be a large
formal function, but eimply the annual ban
quet of the club, for 1U member* and guests.
Sir Thomas Lipton's name was not mentioned,
nor that of any other gentleman, in mf In
terview, and to assure the public that noth
ing was further from the President's thoughts
than to bar Sir Thomas Upton or any one else
from the dinner, I take plewure in giving
to the press the following .letter, which I ' have
Just received from Secretary Loeb:
â¢'My Dear Mr. Hoyt: The President directs
me to cay that it will be a particular pleasure
to him if Sir Thomas Upton can come to the
Beawanhaka dinner. As you will recall, all
that the President eaid when the invitation
wag extended to him was that he did not feel
like accepting any more jnvitations to formal
functions; that if it waa simply to be a neigh
borly dinner among- his own friends in the
Seawanhaka Club he would gladly come. The
President has a particularly high regard to
Sir Thomas Llpton, and a high appreciation
of the manly and sportsmaifllkt spirit he has
Fhown throughout the yacht contests. The
President earnestly desires that Sir Thomas be
present at the dinner. Yours very truly
"WILLIAM LOIWJB. 1 ,
"Secretary to the President."
Charles A. Holt, who lives next door,

went to their assistance with a six-shoot

the premises were not heeded, and then
Holt shot in the air to frighten the fel
low. This had no effect on the Â«would
be burglar, and Holt shot him In the
right hip. The bullet passed through the
fleshy part of. the hip, making a painful
wound. Thrift set up a howl of pain and
he was cared for until Deputy Sheriff
Drelschmeyer arrived. The shooting' and
the howling of Thrift awoke the neigh
bors and great excitement prevailed In the
vicinity for some time. '
Asa Munsey, a partner of Thrift, was
arrested at the Rainier Hotel early this
morning. The two men came here from
Seattle a couple of weeks "ago and have
been .picking? prunes at the Blackwell
ranch, near this city. According to Mun
sey, the two men were drinkinc yester
day and Thrift had mistaken the "Wood
house for the one where he lived. This
Is not believed, however, as both men
were sober when arrested. The officers

Thrift will probably be prosecuted for at

touches a match to a loaded cannon, at
the mouth of which his enemy, the hero.
Is chained. There is a terrific explosion,
but the Intended victim Is snatched from
the jaws of death in a marvelous "man
ner. The play is full of color and replete
with strong dramatic incidents and thrill
ing scenes. The action takes place in In
dia, and the piece has been given a gor
geous Oriental setting. The title is taken
from the Eleventh British Hussars, who
lost a fight by tarrying in a cherry or
chard and were dubbed "Cherry Pickers."
The plot deals with a conflict between the
aggressive English and the half-castes.

. "Magda.", that most stirring of emo
tional plays, was presented lri a mag
nificent manner .at the Alcazar last night.
The people of the stage made their au
dience live and move and thrill with
themselves.. The production was a suc
cess alien as the little theater has seldom
known. At times the listeners were spell
bound and again they were applauding
wildly. After every act there was curtain
call after curtain, call. There was life
and action in^every line of the play as it

woman gains ease, lightness and strength
every day. Claire Kulp, who was so
effective as the child In "The Devil's Dis

with a natural . and charming Suzanne

FAVORITES WHO ARE AP
PEARING AT SOME OF THE
LOCAL THEATERS.
The Manrico of Emmanuele Ischlerdo
Is a trifle uneven, being passably good in
spots and excellent in others. His slng^
Ing of "Dl Duella Plra" Is by far his best
solo In the opera and he was obliged to
repeat it thrice last evening.
In Ferrando the rich, sonorous ba3so of
Baldo Travatrltnl is heard to excellent
advantage, and although the part is but
a small one It Is none the Ies3 acceptable
and appetizing.
The minor part of Inez is taken most
cleverly by Miss Phyllis Partington of
this city. She has a graceful figure Â«and
a sweet, sympathetic voice, which may
be heard In the near future in a more
pretentious^ character.
An excellent make-up has Cieo Mar
chesini. the Azucena, and a contralto rich
and round with all of the' fervent dra
matic quality that draw^^pplause out of
the coldest crevices. From the opening
notes of the "Stride la Vain pa" to the
last ones of the prison song in act VI
she retains the vociferous sympathy of
the audience. In addition to her vocal
excellencies she Is a cood- actress.
\ The star of the cast Is Ailamo Gre
goretti, the Count di Luna. Adamo Is
a handsome fellow and a baritone diffi
cult to rnatf*h. He is equally good all
through,- and his â¢'!! Balen" calls for
several encores, which the good-o&tured
fellow cheerfully complies with.
There is no willowy-waisted Leonora at
the Tivoli this week while Lina de Bene
detto sings the heroine Of Verdi's "II
Trovatore." Llna's Leonora is an ex
pansive armful of beauty and melody,
done up in an attractive package of solid
art. She can warble like a canary and
the highest notes are ripe cherries that
she picks fro-m th<? vocal tree v/ith ease
and grace. She is* eminently Italian In
all that she does and makes the hearts
ofher hearers warm toward her.

Princess Losoros has established her
self as a prime favorite at the Orpheum
and last night she was enthusiastically
applauded for her singing of Bishop's
"Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark." E. Rousby's
spectacular novelty, "In Paris." is mag
nificent and elicited bursts of applause.
The Rio brothers, athletes: Fischer and
Wacker, Tyrolean duetlsts: Frederic
Bond and his company, including Georgie
Benton, in the farce "My Awful Dad";
Almont and Dumont, instrumentalists:
James Richmond Glenroy, the monologist,
and Arnesen. the gymnast, make up a
most attractive bill.

An Incident took place In the last act
that was Quite out of the ordinary. In
one of the stage boxes were a number of
well-known men about town, accompanied
by fashionably attired women. One of
their number started the fun by throw-
Ing a half dollar on the stage. Others
followed. Barney Bernard was the first
to grab the situation and reached for the
coin." More dollars were thrown, and Kolb
came to the rescue and scooped in what
he could. Finally Dill came from behind
the stage bar and pocketed a half. At
this juncture Maud Amber came on, be
ing greeted by a perfect shower of glit
tering coins. She made no attempt to
capture any of them, being content to
gaze upon the headlight diamond that the
court had awarded her during the day.
The chorus, however, joined in a merry
scramble, and it was a case of catch-as
catch-can.
Fischer's.
Another big crowd was in attendance at
Fischer's Theater last night.
The "Glad Hand" and "Con-curers"
have caught on in good shape. The co
medians seem funnier than ever, and the
solos and choruses are encored again and
acain.
In Derblay, the sensitive, high-minded
master of the forges, Mr. Miller. wins an
other personal triumph. He has flung
overboard for the- nonce ajl ; the Shaw
realisms, the Davis modernisms and plays
the romantic old role. in -a properly- ro-
It- will be remembered that Claire has
four acts of unmitigated dampness to
support. If this daughter of a hundred
earls (French) is not in one sort of
trouble she Is in another. It is, however,
the kind of role catalogued as "strong"
and has the aforementioned strong scenes
that with some relief would only> gain
strength. That Miss Anglin does every
thing possible for. the part; goes without
saying, compelling full ~ sympathy for
the rather ungrateful character. She
realizes delicately the ruling pride, of the
girl, and paints with sure and fine touch
her warming into . tenderness and love.
Her scene with Derblay (Mr. Miller), the
bridegroom, is handled, with conscious
power, coming into full, touch with one's
sympathy. She Invests even the banal
scene of rivalry. between Claire and the
Duchess with dignity and conviction,
playing the part throughout for all It is
T-nrth 1HffBmymiWlfil"l>tiiTWrftriarTi
The troubles of that very damp young
person Claire are still good for a tremen
dous lot of more or less deserved sympa
thy, as last night's reception of the play
proved. And there are still the strong
scenes to rely upon. The scene between
the deceived bridegroom and his newly
made bride counts yet the plenteous thrill,
and the scenes between the flirting Duch
ess and Claire, between Claire and her
old lover, not to.fcrget the duel episode,
are all in the class of self-raising senti
ment. True. Mr. MiTier'and Miss Anglln
deserve better things. There Is about the
whole, story a radical theatricalism, a
falseness of values, a lack of the subtle
verities of life with which these. two are
so competent to deal, jhat their time with
"The Aftermath" is much in the nature
of waste. Still, as.lt is not life but enter
tainment that the average playgoer de
sires, the play will doubtless be a consid
erable Buccess. It was last night. Need
less to say, the staging Is of admirable
sort and the gowns are dreams.
The new dramatist claims little origin
ality for his edition. Rather a "pot
pourri" of book and other versions, he
modestly terms it. Perhaps the chief dif
ference in "The Aftermath" and the older
editions Is in the freshening up of the
phrase, though Mr. Miller has by no
means taken all the stilt out of the talk.
The language is still rather balloony, the
sentence over long, the phrase o'er flow.
ery. The outline of the original story,
the love of the ironmaster for the grande
dame. Is closely adhered to. There are,
however, several happily introduced incil
dents of lighter character that serve to
leaven the somewhat weepy lump. Not
that it is not the kind of "weep" that Is
Joyfully Indulged In.

Ohnet's "Le Maltre des Forges"

pearance as "The Aftermath,"
this time arranged by Henry Miller.
Pinero, Pritchard and not a few famous
others have tried their hand at adapting
the Ohnet romance, and people like Jane
Hading and Coquelln have ever been
found ready to play it. In the dearth of
new plays the return of Mr. Miller and
Miss Anglin to "The Ironmaster" is not
surprising. There Is much In the play to
commend it as a medium for both of these
clever people, and Mr. Miller has made a
smooth and easy running version of the
story.

says that on the night of April 30 he
poked a loaded revolver into her face
and threaten3d to kiU^ier. informing her
that he had no use for her and that he
only married her out of pity. The next

After hearing Fitzhenry'e tale of woe
Judge Troutt refused to grant the mo
tion for a non-suit made by his wife and
set the case for further hearing to-day
at 10 o'clock.
Dodging cordwood, carving knives, flat
irons, chunks of coal and stovelid lifters,
hurled at one's head for more than a
year, la not a pleasant way to spend
one's time. It Is too monotonous. At
least it Is to Arthur Fitzhenry. HÂ© said
so yesterday in Judge Troutt'a court dur
ing the hearing of his suit for divorce
against Rosanna Fitahenry. He Informed
the court that as a relief he occasionally
allowed one of the missiles to land. "I
had some good liniment, your Honor," he
said, "and the wounds soon healed. In
time my head became used . to being
bumped by everything In the house that
my wife could throw and 1 made no com
plaint until things came my way too
often. Then I brought this suit."
Fitzhenry Is a stout young fellow. 20
years his wife's junior. He " met her In
Ireland, whither she had gone on a visit.
It was evidently a case of love at first
sight, for he said that Mrs. Fitxhenry
paid his transportation to this country
and met him here a short time after his
arrival. They became husband and wife
and came to this city. They were only
hero a short time when they began quar
reling. His elderly wife commenced hos
tilities, said Fitahenry, first using her
tongue and finally household utensils as
a means of showing she "ruled the roost."
Between 14 and $5 had been stolen from
the till in Corr.isky-s saloon. When But
ler and Foran ran away from 329 Third
street one of them was seen to throw
away a cold chisel and a screw driver
v.hich were later picked up by Tlllman'
Butler and Foran were under the influ
ence of liquor when arrested.
Byron B. Bradley, a laborer, living at
317 Third street, was also arrested by
Tillman, as he had also been seen in front
of the saloon, but he was able to prove
that he had no connection with Butler or
Foran and was merely held as a witness.
Bradley said he was going home and
heard the breaking of glass at Comisky's
saloon. He walked along to see what was
the matter, when Butler came out of a
doorway adjoining the saloon and de
manded Bradley's money for drink. Brad
ley said he did not have any and was al
lowed to go. He walked toward Market
street and tcld a young man he met not
to go on that side of the street, as two
fellows were holding up an old man and
they had also held him up. While return
ing from Market street he was arrested
by Tillman.
Butler and Foran ran, but Foran was
soon caught by Tillman. Watchman Be
han yelled to McDowell, Ruggles and
Moran that the men were coming and
they rushed cut of the saloon Just as
Butler dashed past with Clay in pursuit.
Moran, who was ahead of the others,
colled upon Butler to stop, but he con
tinued to run and turned west on Har
rison street. Moran fired a shot at him,
but It only made him increase his speed.
Moran again called upon Butler to stop
and when Butler reached Clara street
Morau fired two more shots at him, one of
the bullets taking effect in the calf of his
leg: and bringing him to a sudden pause In
his flight. Butler was placed under ar
rest and taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where his wound was dressed.
He was then taken to the City Prison,
where Foran had preceded him. They
were Identified as the men seen in front
of Comi^ky's saloon.
The officers grot a description of three
men Â¦who had been seen in front of the
saloon by T. Behan, a watchman for the
United Railroads. McDowell. Ruggles
and Moran entered the saloon to gee if the
burglars were still there and Tillman and
Clay walked along Third street. They
discovered two men. who proved to be
Butler and Foran, trying to force open
the door of a ealoon at 329 Third street.
Matthew J. Butler, a sheet metal
worker, and John Koran, a teamster, are
in the City Prison with a charge of bur

As in our time schools of all kinds are being estab

for almost every occupation under the sun, there is
no reason for objecting to the new venture. In the
course of time the example may be followed else

center at the universities, and doubtless we shall ere

A correspondent of the Westminster Gazette at
tributes the movement. to a desire on the part of the
French to obtain a share of the large expenditure of
tourists now poured out in Switzerland. The French
syndicate has studied the trade and has come to the
conclusion that the throng of visitors to Switzerland
is due not so much to the scenery of the country as
to the excellent hotels that abound there, and ac
cordingly it is the opinion that by establishing
equally pleasant hotels in French villages they can
command a good share of the patronage.
The tourist travel in Switzerland is certainly large
enough to excite the envy of â¢neighboring nations.
The latest official report on the subject covers the
period from January i to October 31, 1899, and states
that during that period upwards of 2,500,000 tourists
registered at Swiss hotels. It is^ estimated that their
expenditures average 80 francs each, making a total
of about 200,000,000 francs. As Switzerland has only
about 2,000,000 inhabitants it will be seen that such
a revenue pouring into the country in a period of ten
months constitutes a very valuable accession to the
channels of trade and the per capita income.
No information is forthcoming as to the nature of
the training to be given in the professional school at
Paris, but a wjiter on the subject in the Revue des
Deux Mondes is quoted as saying: "Let us imitate
Swiss methods, but with elasticity and distinction.
Let us receive foreigners not with the stereotyped
welcomc # of the hotel-keeper, but with the courtesy
and reserve of an ancjent race doing the honors of
a country estimated by its inhabitants at its proper
value." .-Â¦ ' Â« â¢
REPORTS from Paris are to the effect that a
syndicate of hotel-keepers in France has

the business of hotel-keeping in France up to a stand

Of course this is an act of war and must be.au
thorized by our Congress. Our domestic dema
gogues would object and do much blatherskiting
about our sister republic, but healthy American sen
timent is in no humor to listen, to the semi-treason
of demagogues. Either we must put an end to Latin-
American bullying or take our place, at the cross

AN official of the State Department declares that
there will be no further negotiation with Co

now turn to the bandits who rule Nicaragua anS
Costa Rica and try to negotiate that route. Un
fortunately Colombia has set them an evil example,
which they may follow to defeat us again. The quoted
official of the State Department says: "What is the
use of trying to deal with people who do not ob
serve the first principles of intercourse? The Co
lombians no doubt think they did a smart thing
when they held up our cablegrams."
The American people are beginning to inquire how
long our Government proposes to stand being spat
upon, insulted and snubbed by those pestiferous
Latin-American states. They have long been in the
habit of robbing and maltreating Americans without
rebuke or punishment, and seem to have concluded
that as our Government will not protect its own citi
zens from their outrages, it is safe to insult it directly.
This has been done by Colombia in this canal af
fair, and no other Government woulcl rest under it.
The interception of official dispatches to our Minister
to Bogota is equivalent to an act of war. The Gov
ernment of Colombia should be ordered to apologize
to Minister Beaupre, and be compelled to do it, hat

their talent and responding generously to
the rounds of applause which followed
each well -rendered number.
Both the ballads and coon songs con
tributed by Miss Rose Broderick were
highly appreciated by the audience, and
the young lady answered gracefully to
the many encores* she received. Mrs. Myr
tle Marshall was delightful in her rendi
tion of the coon songs with which she
favored the veterans. Miss Jean Durrell
first touched the hearts of the audience
deeply with a little recitation entitled
"When I Was in the Army," and then in
a twinkling brought down the house with
comic recitations. The singing: of the
members of the quartet was splendid, in
dividually and collectively. Their rendi
tion of "Annie Laurie," given by request,
was especially appreciated by the veter
ans. They were all in fine voice and were
untiring in their efforts to make the even
ing's entertainment a success. The ac
companist for the evening was Mrs. W.

The entertainment was under the man

FORTUNATE is it for Joseph Chamberlain that
by his protective tariff proposals he has been
able to tix public attention upon his plans as an
imperial statesman and distract it from his failures as
Colonial Secretary. The chief work of his adminis
tration of the Colonial Omcc has been done in South
Africa, and while the reports from Cape Colony and
Johannesburg are contradictory, there is a growing
belief in London itself that not only are the Boers
but the British settlers in the Transvaal dissatisfied
with the situation and more or less discouraged by
the outlook.
Of the labor problem a good deal has been re
ported, and it seems to constitute the most vexatious
of the difficulties of the country. Labor is scarcer
than in the days when under the Boer regime the na
tives could be forced to work. A report says: "For
the twelve months ended on June 30, 1899, preceding
the outbreak of the war in October of that year, the
value oi the gold produced by the Witwatersrand
mines was a little more than $85,000,000. For ' the
twelve months ended June 30, 1003, the gold product
of the same district was a little more than $45,000,
000. t The principal factor in this limitation
has been the insufficiency of the supply of native
laborers. The exceeding seriousness of this matter
appears not only in the commercial and industrial
phases of the question, but also in the whole political
question. Upon the successful operation of these
properties there depend the revenues of the coun
try, ar.d, beyond that, the fund proposed for the
reconstruction of the Transvaal. Failure to develop
the mines to the extent of their capacity means gen
eral industrial paralysis and default in the revenues.
A labor supply is therefore imperative."
While the British are thus struggling and failing
in their efforts to colonize the country with immi
grants and to devise a means of getting an abun
dant supply of cheap labor the Boers are seemingly
watching the progress of events with keen eyes, wait
ing patiently for the coming of a time when they can
reassert their supremacy in the land. The London
Mail recently published a letter from a correspondent
at Johannesburg calling attention to the rapidity with
which the Boers arc being organized into groups un
der the title and the form of agricultural associations.
He predicts that sooner or later these organizations
will become political rather than agricultural socie
ties, and says: "Some day a strong hand will sweep
them together into one political entity, with one
voice, one ambition and one solid vote."
He goes on to say: "There is no man better ca
pable of playing the waiting game than the Boer.
Not that there is anything particularly sinister in his
present silence, or that ill will necessary befall when
the silence is broken â as it will be. He is the man
of the soil: He is content to live and die on the land
and raise a family. For him Europe has no attrac
tions; he is here to-day and will be here a hundred
years hence, and he is the man who will have to vote
aprainst us. whose only ambition is to save sufficient
money to enable us to return to and live comfortably
*.he rest of our days in the mother country. And nat
urally he must win all along the line, and, .what is
more, it is perhaps desirable that he should."
The one cheering feature in the situation is that
whether or no the Boer is beginning to like the
Briton, the Briton is beginning to understand the
Boer and to sympathize with him. Sharing the dif
ficulties of life in the Transvaal, the British settler has
Teamed that in many respects the Boers were right
in the course they pursued before the war. and con
sequently it is quite probable the settlers will even
tually be able to establish firm relations of friendship
with their former foes. That, however, is a specula
tion of the far future. At present South Africa is in
a muddle politically, industrially and socially, and the
immediate ontlook is far from promising.

CALIFORNIA
CLUB BEGINS
YEAR'S WORK
IN the presence of the "Unspeakable Turk" Europe
hesitates and waits for the coming of a more pro
pitious time to sweep him bag and baggage out
oi her territory and back to his native wastes in Asia.
Thtre are two reasons for the hesitation; in the first
place Europe is not quite sure what she would do
â¢Afith the country if the Turk were driven out t of it,
and in- the second place she is very doubtfulif the
Tmk could be driven out without so wrecking and
dcs< lating the land that it would not be worth having.
Of the two causes of delay the first is the more
talked about, but the second is the more potent. It
is all very well to say that European nations are too
jealous of one another to be able to agree upon a
definite policy with respect to Turkey, but as a mat
ter of facf they would agree promptly enough if they
were sure the agreement could be carried out with
out costing more than the results would be worth.
Europe managed to partition Africa without .much
trouble, and in times past Russia, Austria and Prus
sia managed to agree upon a partition of Poland
wrlhout any very long discussion. It would be
equally easy for those three powers to agree now
with respect to the partition of Turkey but for the
fact that the Turk is better armed than the Pole was
or the African is, and he is not going to lie down and
be partitioned without a fight.
As a citizen the Turk is bad, as a neighbor he is
troublesome and rude, as a worker he is worthless
and socially he is, vile, but for all that he is a first
class fighting man. There are upwards of 1,000,000
of him, drilled and armed for war, commanded
largely by German officers and equipped with the best
weapons the gun factories of the world can furnish.
He has a large faith in his religion and in the prom
ises it holds out to those who die fighting for Islam
against a heretic foe. Were Europe to enter brashly
upon the task of expelling the unspeakable one there
would result a- struggle that would be even more un
speakable. In the face of such a foe Europe hesi
tates, and Europe is right. There are conditions of
evil that can be much better cured by time than by
the sword, and as matters now stand around Con
stantinople it would seem that to go slow is the
surest way of getting there without losing one or
both feet on the trip. *

A portrait of the Empress Dpwager of China,
painted by an American-artist, is to be exhibited at
the St. Louis Exposition. It certainly will be inter
esting to know what one of the most remarkable
women of modern" times looks like from an Occi
dental and artistic viewpoint. v
On the face of the case Mr. Erivin's friends refuse
to recognize any turpitude in the acts alleged against
him. When a man enters the Government service
acts do not become criminal in him which were legal
and proper before he entered that service. There is
nothing in the law or regulations to make them so.
He may deal in the stocks of corporations organized
undjr the laws of this State, and, not being himself
the public purchasing agent and as such doing busi
ness with himself as a private citizen, he may without
offense take dividends and profits derived from the
sale of any article to the Government.
As for Mr. Erwin, his case can hardly be said to be
one of suspension of judgment on the part of all who
know him. It is rather a delivery of judgment that
the dragnet has caught a gentleman, a good citizen
and an honest man, and that the attempt to convict
him will simply be the measure of some one's need
to hide himself behind the destruction of an innocent
man.
The postoffice scandals happen to be all there is in
sight to excuse a partisan hue and cry against the ad
ministration, and the opposition press is making the
most of it. Many in the Republican party have
wrongly judged that the best way to deal with the
matter is to fling victims, innocent or guilty, to the
Moloch of partisanship. But there are others, rea
sonable men of both parties, who do not indorse such
a sacrifice of blameless men and gentlemen, either to
clear the skirts of a party or furnish means of escape
for the guilty. Such men are calling ci halt to the
policy of indiscrimination, and they regard Mr. Er
win as one of its intended victims whose immolation
they will prevent.
IM their anxiety to justify their employment the
secret service men engaged in investigation of
matters ,'in the General Postoffice seem to Â¦ have
done a great deal of dragnetting without regard to
the law or the facts as justification. Among the
victims., of this process is Mr. Erwin, for sixteen
years a responsible, intelligent and industrious officer
of the department, zealous in the discharge of his
duty, and intrusted in Cuba, the Philippines and
Hawaii with the most difficult work of mail service
organization and installment. In everything put in
his hands he has shown the most faithful and useful
service. He is now indicted for conspiracy in con
nection with the. purchase by the department of the
collection indicating device used on mail boxes.
Scarcely without exception the devices for im
proving and expediting the mail service have been
invented by postal employes. The stamping machine,
the street boxes, the country free delivery boxes and
even the sealed envelope and postage stamp were so
invented. There is no law nor regulation to deprive
such an inventor of the right to patent and profit by
his invention. It is nowhere denied that the collec
tion indicator device is useful and necessary. But
the secret service men find that, in their judgment,
its price is too high. An inventor, however, is en
titled to a royalty on his patent in addition to the
cost of manufacturing the article. This seems not
to have been taken into consideration by the secret
service men. If every man is guilty of conspiracy
who docs not disclose to the Government the cost
of producing what it buys of him, the courts will have
little else to do for some years except try conspiracy
cases.
As stated, the case against Mr. Erwin is that he in
troduced the patentee of the indicator device to
Machen. Now it is quite possible that Machen ex
acted a fee for considering the matter. If all that
is revealed about him by Mr. Bristow is true, this is
probably the case, since such conduct would be in
line with his alleged course in other matters. But
if all the gentlemen who introduced others to him
seeking business relations with the department are
indicted for conspiracy, Mr. Erwin will find himself
one of a great and rather respectable company.

To the newspaper itself the opportunity to gain a wider

which early advantage should be taken.
One feature of the Roll of Honor which gives It an added

MERCY MOVES HEART
OF THE PBOSECUTION
The application of Dr. McNutt for spe
cial letters of administration on the estate
of Miss Clark will come up before Judge
Coffey this morning.
Under the will made by Miss Clark,
and which Is in the possession of Dr. Mc-
Nutt, the entire estate, with the excep
tion of two small bequests, is left to Mrs.
Strohn. That lady and her husband ar
rived in this city Sunday night and the
two othtr sisters of Miss Clark are ex
pected to come here and contest the will,
which has not yet been filed by Dr. Mc-
Nutt.
Ex-Judge Slack was of opinion that
there was no immediate necessity 'for the
application for an administrator and that
propriety demanded that an administrator
should not be appointed until the arrival
of the relatives of the deceased woman In
this city. The attorney for the relatives
had bo informed Dr. McXutt on the day'
of Miss Clark's death, but his sugges
tions were not heeded and the application
for letters of administration was made
the next day and postponed until yester
day by the court.
Maxwell McNutt, in making the appli
cation on behalf of Dr. McNutt, Informed
the court that the property belonging to
Miss Clark included the Studebaker build-
Ing, recently destroyed by fire, and that
an administrator of the estate was neces
sary in order to see that immediate re
pairs to the damaged building might be
carried out.
Judge Kerrigan announced that when
Dr. McNutt applied for letters of admin
istration on the estate the day after Miss
Clark committed suicide, he was of the
opinion that a contest was not imminent
and had therefore assigned the case to
his own court, not being Informed that
relatives were to appear in the matter,
but that the estate was simply to be di
vided in accordance with the will which
Miss Clark Is supposed to have made ju3t
previous to her self-destruction.
Under the circumstances Judge Kerri
gan declined to grant the request of Dr.
McNutt and decided that the matter
should be sent to one of the probate
courts and assigned It to Judge Coffey.
A contest over the estate left by the
late Miss Isabella D. Clark, who com
mitted eulcide at the McNutt Hospital on
September S, Is likely to occur, judging
by the proceedings that took place In the
Superior Court yesterday.
Dr. W. K. McNutt. a friend of long
standing of Miss Clark, again appeared
before Judge Kerrigan and applied for
special letters of administration on the
half-million dollar estate left by the de
ceased woman, but his application was
opposed by ex-Judge Charles W. Slack,
who appeared on behalf of Mrs. Roys N.
Strohn and Mrs. John G. Carter, sisters
of the deceased. A similar protest was
made by Attorney F. Michael, represent
ing Mrs. Jerome A. Hart, another sister
of Miss Clark.
Contest for Estate of
Miss I. D. Clark Is
Imminent.
Booth said he would vote against the
ordinance in its present shape and de
sired to hear from the City Attorney as
to the possibility of opening Seventeenth
street.
"The objections made by Mr. Reed
should receive consideration," said Bran
denstein. "He says that these tracks will
shut out traffic on Sixteenth street. The
objections have npt been metÂ« by Mr.
Burke of the Southern Pacific Company."
"We want a highway 1 to the water
front," said Reed. "We 'can pass two
tracks, but we cannot pass twelve."
Braunhart moved that the ordinance
granting the franchise be amended so
that the tracks on Sixteenth street be
limited to twelve and that the agreement
of the company to widen Sixteenth street
by ten feet be incorporated in the ordi
nance. Brandenstein wanted the board to
hold a special meeting to consider the
question.
Reed vigorously objected to the twelve
track proposition, saying it would be im
possible for heavy teams to cross them.
"We will agree to be limited to twelve
tracks on Sixteenth street." said Jere
Burke of the Southern Pacific Company,
"and widerTthe street by ten feet. If we
are compelled to 'fan out' our tracks be
yond Sixteenth street one-fifth of our ter
minal facilities will be lost for car stor
age purposes."
Attorrf;y Reed asked the board to limit
the tracks on Sixteenth street to two, but
Burke said the company would not con
sent to such a condition. Replying to a
question of Brandenstein as to whether
the company would open Seventeenth
street, Burke said the company would
not under any circumstances relinquish
any Tights to Seventeenth street.
Creek, your committee recommends that the
applications be denied.
Your committee deems it proper to express
Its high appreciation ot the work performed
by tht. engineering department of the Board
of 1'ublic Works, anrf n-ore particularly to
C. F. Grunsky. City Engineer, whose ability
and devotion to rulilic interest have enabled
your committee to at rive at a solution of the
r.ifficult problem iretintcl to It In the con
sideration of the purposed franchise.
"In view of the protests filed here,"
said Supervisor Curtis, "I am not pre
pared to recommend the passage of the
franchise in its present form. I will say
that the changes exacted by City Engi
neer Grunsky in the original ordinance
will cost the railroad company more than
{250,000. We, however, feel that the com
mercial interests of this city demand that
this franchise be granted. It is only
within the last week that the railroad
company evinced any willingness to grant
any concession in the matter of the fran
chise and if. there Is any delay the final
passage of the grant will not be in the
hands of this board."

M'NUTT SEEKS
TO ADMINISTER
Your committee, after due deliberation, haÂ»
deemed it advisable to' recommend tho ac
. ceptance of said propositions In lieu of thÂ«
lecommendatlons herein stated, believing that
the widening- of Fourth and Kentucky streets
would relieve the congestion to traffic that
may hereafter occur.
A proposition made by the company to pur
chase the said market places under the pro
visions of an act of the Legislature, making
It discretionary with the Board of Supervisors
to sell the property Â¦ is reported adversely to
by your committee, it being not considered to
be for the beet interests of the city.
Â¦ The recommendation of the City Engineer
as to the rental to be paid is favorably rec
ommended by your committee, to wit:
"At lease $C0O per month for the first 'five
years and thereafter an amount equal to 3
per cent rer annum on the value of â¢ these
properties, said valuation . in case of disagree

WILL BUILD BRIDGE.
The railroad company thereupon made the
following proposal: "That in lieu of the con
struction of the proposed viaduct and the en
trance to the market places, it would con
tribute the sum of $55,000 toward the con
struction Of a bridge across Channel street
from Third to Kentucky, the remainder of the
cost of construction of said bridge to be borne
by the Atchlson, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail
road Company as heretofore agreed to by
said company with this board," and also
"That said company would dedicate or con
vey to the city for street purposes a strip of
land twenty feet In width adjacent to and
widening Fourth and Kentucky streets, cut
from' such property as said railroad company
owns along the northeasterly line of Fourth
street southerly from Channel street and
along the easterly line or Kentucky street,"
thus making a roadway 100 feet wide along
paid Â¦ streets.
Another recommendation was that the
Southern Pacific Company dedicate to the city
and county of San Francisco a strip of land
sixty (CO) feet in width, extending along and
adjacent to the- southerly line of Channel
street southwesterly from Fourth street to
parcels of land owned by the city and desig
nated on the official map as market places.
Tho representatives of the company would
not consent to this proposition because if they
agreed to the payment of a rental upon a
Just valuation of the property, it would be,
in their opinion, unjust to exact from it the
setting aside any part thereof for other pur
poses, thus depriving them of the enjoyment of
property for tha leasehold for which the city
was receiving full rental.
i
were changed the Southern Pacific would
pecure practical control of Sixteenth
street.
The report of the Street Committee re
ommending the grant of franchise was
then read as follows:
Ampla provision has been made for proper
compensation to property owners along said j
road whoso property may bo damaged; said [
company agreeing to abide by tho decision :
of the City Engineer in fixing compensation
to be provided in each particular Instance.
One of the recommendations of tho City En
gineer, in order to relieve tho congestion of I
traffic likely to occur on account of the sub- I
sequent Increase in the population of the 'â¢
city, was the construction of a viaduct, when !
required by the Board of Supervisors, extend- i
ing across Brannan and Fifth streets, 'over and"
across the railroad company's property from '
Brannan and Fifth streets to a point near |
the intersection of Sixteenth and Kentucky â¢
streets, the cost of this structure to bo borne '
Jointly by the v Southem Pacific Company and j
the city and county of San Francisco; said '
railroad company paying three-fourths of said !
cost, including purchase of lands and damages j
to property, and the city bearing one-fourth I
of said cost upon the completion of said via- !
duct.
The representatives of the Southern Pacific !
Company strenuously objected to make any ]
such concession upon the grounds, that the |
proposed viaduct would greatly damage their
property and would involve a complete chango â¢
of their terminal points, and for these reasons
they could under no circumstances consent to '
the acceptance of a franchise with this con- i
dltlon contained therein.
. Mr. Schwartz was one of the numerous
men of indomitable courage and persever
ance who came to California in the early
days. When twenty years of age he left
his home, Kempen, Germany, where ho
was born fifty-one years ago, and came
direct to California, settling in San. Luis
Obispo and later in this city. As a mer
chant he thrived and accumulated a for
tune, which is said to amount to $1,000,000.
Mr. Schwartz was highly esteemed in
the community and belonged to several
charitable organizations. He was also a
member of the Merchants' Association
and the Board of Trade. He was also
prominent in the Masonic fraternity. The
deceased leaves a widow and two daugh
ters. Miss Florence and Miss Pearl

Two weeks ago the late Mr. Schwartz
returned from a visit to Guatemala,
where he had large business interests in
conjunction with Adolph Stahl, as a cof
fee planter and banker, and was also
financial agent for the Government of
Guatemala. He had hardly been home
two days before he developed pneumonia,
and, although at one period he was con
sidered to be improving, his heart sud

WOULD LIMIT TEACKS.
"We ask that a reasonable limit b*
placed on the number of tracks to be laid
on Sixteenth street," said Whittely, "and
that no 'frogs' or movable switches be
permitted on the tracks."
Whittely then submitted an agreement
in writing to the foregoing effect. . .
George Center said that unless the plans
AH these reasons make it Imperative that
Sixteenth street should not be obstructed by
ten to twenty tracks. The franchise should
allow* the railroad to cross Sixteenth street
with only two tracks, and the tracks should
fan out north of Sixteenth . ftreet to the
Southern Pacific terminus and should not fan
out south of Sixteenth street. This is the
main objection which I offer here, and the one
evil of all others which I ask you to rectify.
The Real Estate and Development
Company, by Fred Clark, president,
owner of five and a half blocks of land on
Sixteenth street, petitioned the board to
Impose, among other conditions, that no
frogs, switch throws or movable lead
rails be permitted to be laid on Sixteenth
street, and that a definite limit be placed
upon the number of tracks that may
cross Sixteenth street.
H. 8. Whittely, secretary of the Real
Estate Company, said his company was
willing to donate five feet along Sixteenth
street to widen the street if the Southern
Pacific would donate five feet for the
same purpose, or else, if the tracks were
placed on tho north side of the street his
company would donate five feet, and asks
the railroad company to ' buy five feet
along Sixteenth to widen the street.
Material sheds are to be built on Seven
teenth street. Although the streets In that
neighborhood have been closed, the property
of the city In them has not been abandoned.
If the Southern Pacific is to use the streets
of the city without compensation, they should
adequately provide against the Inevitable con
gestion of trucking on Sixteenth street by
granting an Increased width of street.
The Santa Fe has already asked for addi
tional franchise west of Seventeenth street;
all the more should Sixteenth street be kept'
open and widened.
Traffics from the Mission district demands a
highway to the water front. There is now
none but on Sixteenth street. ' The building
of the bridge will not give this highway. The
grade of 5 per cent is prohibitive of heavy
trucking. A
Kentucky street is to be widened as an oft
eet to relinquishing the bridge on Fifth street.
Much more should Sixteenth street be widen
ed. Looking ahead twenty-fjve yearn, we shall
see the railroad business of San Francisco
concentrated around the China, basin. We
shall also see the manufacturing industries
largely concentrated In the Mission district.
Sixteenth street should be widened In order
to afford an outlet for this traffic. One street
in entirely Insufficient for the business of the
future. The one street to be utilized should
be a broad highway.
John Deahl objected to the grant of
franchise on the ground that no provis
ion has been made for an outlet to the
marketplace lots which it is proposed to
lease to the Southern Pacific Company.
"I want this board to compel the com
pany to build an approach to the lots,"
said Deahl, "otherwise they will be of
no value to any one except to the com
pany. If this approach is exacted I am
ready to bid more than $600 per month
which the company agrees to pay as len
tal. I want those blocks to be put in
such a condition that they will be of per
manent value to the city. The company
says you ask too much when you a9k it
to reserve a strip of land through the
marketplace lots for a street, but I
would like to ask in what particular the
railroad company has shown itself to be
generous?"
Charles Wesley Reed, attorney for pro
testants, said that the specific ground of
objection was that the company was to be
permitted to "fan out" its tracks on Six
teenth street and it should be required to
go beyond Sixteenth street for that pur
pose. Reed then read the following state
ment:
J. H. Eells, attorney for some of the
protestants, said there would be no access
to the water front for heavy teaming on
Sixteenth street if sixteen tracks were
allowed to cross the street named and
heavy teams would be compelled to go a
roundabout way for two miles and this
would mean a practical confiscation of
lands utilized for manufacturing and in
dustrial purposes.
"The property owners are willing to put
up with the inconvenience of two tracks
on Sixteenth street," said Eells, "and the
railroad company should be willing to
'fan out' its tracks on its own land be
yond Sixteenth street. We ask that the
clause granting the company the right to
use ten or more tracks on Sixteenth
etreet be amended so as to limit the
number of tracks to two."
The protest of property owners against
granting a franchise for all tracks asked
for by the Southern Pacific Company on
Sixteenth street was read by the clerk.
The protest Is signed by tho Potrero
Nuevo Land Company, George Center, A.
F. Morrison, R. S. Moore and Andrew
Moore, Claub Stfreckels by A. B. Spreck
els, his attorney in fact; N. Ohlandt &
Co., H. W. Newbauer, Wilson
Company. C. L. Tilden and Union Oil
Company. The protest says In part:
We are not opposed to the granting of the
main franchise, but do emphatically oppose
the granting of the franchise for all the
tracks asked on Sixteenth street. The South
ern Pacific Company proposes to fan out all
their tracks in 6uch a manner as to appro
priate Sixteenth street from Sixth- to Ken
tucky. This destroys the one outlet, to the
water front of an entire district, which is
being utilized for manufacturing purposes.
We petition your honorable board to deny the
right of the Southern Pacific Company to fan
out its tracks on Sixteenth street in the man
ner proposed and further petition your board
to deny said company any rights on said Six
teenth etreet until It shall agree to deed to
the city of San Francisco additional property
twenty feet in width from Mississippi street
to the -water front, to be used for the widen
ing of Sixteenth street.
WOULD OBSTRUCT TEAMING.
The vigorous protest of property own
ers against the proposed grant of fran
chise to the Southern Pacific Company
for a bay shore line with respect to the
privilege of laying many tracks across
Sixteenth street bo as to obstruct traf
fic resulted in action thereon being post
poned yesterday by the Board of Super
visors until next Thursday at 2 p." m.,
when the bill will be made a special order
on passage to print.
The debate on the question was long
and at its close the ordinance was
amended so as to permit of twelve tracks
on Sixteenth street instead of ten or
more, as the original bill provided." The
company further agreed to widen Six
teenth street on Its northerly side from
Seventh street to the water front by ten
feet and In that Fhape some of the Su
pervisors desired to vote on the bill, but
others successfully pleaded for postpone
ment of action.
Heavy Business Concerns Will Insist
on Access to the Water
Front and Cheap
Freights.
Supervisors Postpone Action
on Petition for Bay
Shore Line.
The Board of Works was requested to
expend $75 for surveying the land in the
University Mound district to definitely de
termine the lines of Twenty-seventh ave
nue South, in order that the obstructions
thereon may be removed. â¢
Grades were ordered changed at certain
points on Masonic, Buena Vista and Tre
mont avenues and Congress, Tennessee,
Twentieth, Java, Jones and Francisco
streets.
Auditor Baehr put a force of clerks to
work entering the raise on the assess
ment books, .but says that it applies so
far only to the State tax. Baehr, how
ever. Is of the opinion that the raise af
fects the city's levy, but will await the
opinion of the City Attorney before en
tering the valuation for the' city's tax
rate on the rolls. Assessor Dodge is of
the contrary opinion, and points to a pre
cedent In 1892, when the raise of 15 per
cent was made to\apply only to the valu
ation for the State tax, the lower valua
tion as returned by the Assessor being
used to calculate the city's taxation.
The resolution authorizing the Hassell
Audit Company to continue the work of
experting the books and accounts of the
County Clerk's office and appropriating
the sum of $2500 out of the urgent neces
sity fund to defray the expenses of the
work was passed to print.
The resolution authorizing the payment
of $770 to J. J. Hassell and his employes
for expert services In the County Clerk's
office was finally . passed.
The United Railroads was requested to
pay the sum of $18,846 38 into the city
treasury as percentage of Its gross re
ceipts of $916,295 72 on various branches.
Resolved, That the City Attorney is hereby
requested to inform this board whether or not
the raise as levied by the State Board of
KquallzaUon affects the assessment roll of
this city as fixed by this board on July 6, 1903.
so far as it applies to city purposes.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
quested the City Attorney for an opinion
as to whether the raise made by the State
Board of Equalization applies to the val
uation upon which the city's tax rate of
$1,076 is based. The resolution on the sub
ject which was adopted follows:
Whereas The State Board of Equalization
did upon September 10, 10tK3. Increase the as
sessment roll of the county of San Francisco*
by raising the same 30 per cent; and
Whereas, This Board of Supervisors did
upon July 6. 1903. fix the rate of taxation

ment roll of $422,000,000; therefore, be It

"But I have enough to pay for this
suit, if necessary, maybe," snapped Wil
liams as he passed Johnson's desk.
"Well, any great display of confidence
is possibly ill-timed," returned Johnson,
and he called Beale to answer the same
question.
Beale stated that he possessed between
a half a million and ,u million dollars.
The prosecution then announced that to
morrow morning they will finish their side
of the suit and # court adjourned..
"That will do," said Johnson.
"Mr. Williams, state your present finan

as to the character of his wounds. Upon

spots where the bullets had entered Mar
riott's injured member. Attorney Dunne,
evidently not satisfied with this demon
stration by model, sought to have Mar
riott disrobe and disclose the actual
wounds to the jury. Johnson protested
and Judge Sloss reserved his decision on
the point until he could consult authori

"Upon returning to the hall the delegates
and other visitors assembled and Mayor
Williams welcomed the society in a short
address, turning over the keys of the city.
The Grand Supreme Council met this
afternoon at 1 o'clock, Grand President P.
J. Rose of Castroville presiding. The
greater part of the>fternoon was taken
up with organization. '
A Portuguese sermon was preached by
Father d'Govero of Centerville, in which
he touched upon subjects of Interest to
the society.
Marriott then detailed the events sub
sequent to the shooting; how he was car
ried to the Waldeck Sanatorium and there
submitted to three operations during the
first six weeks of his convalescence. - He
gave a memorandum of the bills incurred
by him, which amounted to over $2500 for
physicians alone.
At the afternoon session Beale and Wil
liams were present to listen to the cross
examination of their accuser by Attorney
Dunne. He carried Marriott back over
every step of' the transactions of the
night of September 3, plying him with a
thousand queries warranted to entrap him
into fatal admissions or contradictions.
By constantly referring back to the testi
mony given by Marriott in the two for
mer criminal trials in which he has been
the prosecuting witness, Dunne succeeded
in forcing the witness to make several
minor discrepancies in his story.

MAYOR WELCOMES
THE PORTUGUESE
Editor Marriott then took the stand. A
slight limp was noticeable In his walk,
and- when in the chair he kei|t his in
jured left leg stiffly out in front of him.
By the assistance of photographs of thg
hall and staircase of his home, Marriott"
then repeated the story of the asgauit
made upon him by Beale and Williams
on the night of September 3, 1902. He
testified to receiving a telephone call pur
ported to have come from Beale, in which
an Interview for that night was asked
and granted. Marriott described the as
sault in detail. He said:
When Beale and Williams entered I n sited
for their hats and started down the hall to
hang- them up under the stairs. Both men
followed, and just as I was about to place
the hats on the hatrack I received a blow
from behind on the chin. This was Imme
diately followed by a Jab under the right eye
by some sharp Instrument, which might have
been the barrel of a pistol. Then a crushing
blow on the too of the head from a revolver
butt, caused me to put up my left hand, and
MARRIOTT TESTIFIES.
Attorney Hiram Johnson then presented
the case ,of the prosecution to the Jury.
When in his answer Attorney Dunne at
lemptedto Incorporate matter based up
on the amendment still pending, he was
confined to the strict facts of the assault
made upon Marriott by the vigorous ob
jection of Hiram Johnson, and was con
sequently debarred from urging any
grounds of mitigation for the assault un
til his amendment was properly before
the court.
When the court opened Judge Slosa ren
dered a lengthy decision upon the legal
wrangle which had occupied the opposing
attorneys at the opening of the trial last
â¢week. In sustaining the demurrer of the
attorneys for the prosecution to the
amendment of the original answer to the
complaint which was offered by Attorney
Dunne for the defense, Judge Sloss grant
ed the defense the privilege of so amend
ing the amendment as to allow of Its ac
ceptance for pleading on the grounds of
mitigation.
WITH the taking of testimony
in the Marriott vs. Beale and
"Williams damage suit now in
Judse Sloss* court, the trial
began yesterday to assume a
markedly live aspect. Marriott, the edi
tor who is seeking $100,000 damages, was
niade to undergo a long examination by
his attorney and suffered a grilling cross
questioning from Dunne, the attorney for
the two defendants. Truxtun Beale and
Thomas H. Williams, the two capital
ists who are being sued, were called upon
by Attorney Hiram Johnson to v tell the
jury -the amount of their respective pri
vate fortunes and .then released to take
the chair upon the opening of testimony
for the defense.

CHICAGO, Sept. 14.â To-day'B card at
Harlem was ruined by numerous
scratches. The fourth race was declared
off and a selling' affair substituted.
Fading Light, which could not get up a
respectable gallop on Friday, when a 6 to
5 favorite, won the Cicero stakes to-day,
in which she was a 29 to 1 shot in some
of the books. Orfeo, the favorite at 8
to 5, was second and Brush By, at 7 to 1,
third. It waa a gruelling finish between
the first three, in which Jockey Knapp
outrode Davisson, or the verdict might
have beÂ«n changed.
Jockey Davisson was later indefinitely
suspended by the judges for his ride on
Orfeo. A barrel of money was burned up
on this horse, which was unquestionably
the best.

READVIL.LE. Mas3.. Sept. 14.âAl
though the weather conditions were ideal
and the Readvllle track lightning fast.
Major Delmar, the latest aspirant for rec
ord trotting honors, failed to beat Lou
Dillon's performance- on the same track,
of a mile In two minutes, principally
through poor pacemaking. The gelding.
with the assistance of an automobile, for
the first half and a running horse ahead
In the second, covered the mile in 2:00Â»i.
When Major Delmar was brought out
tnere was scarcely a breath of wind blow
ing and the air was Quite warm. After
scoring three times the horse was sent
away with the automobile slightly behind
on the outside. The quarter was negoti
ated in SfWi seconds, the automobile still
keeping off to the side, ai the three
eighths Dole a runner started in and at
the half was going- In good shape, about
ten. yards ahead of the big trotter. The
half was made in 1:<W4, and as the Judges
announced before the effort was made
t.-at such a time at the half would be
more than satisfactory ths excitement
when the time was posted ro3e to fever
heat. The two horses, with the automo
bile still speeding along on the outside,
swept around the curve to the three
quarters, reaching- that pole in 1:30^* from
the start, which made the time for the
third Quarter 2^ seconds. Everything
looked bright for the smashing of the
two-minute n*ark and the changing of
the sign which has hung over the gats
of the Readvllle track just eighteen days.
But as the three passed the sign and
came into the stretch the runner faltered
slightly and McDonald was forced to pull
up a bit. It seemed only for an Instant,
but that instant meant perhaps a full
second. Coming to the wire, McDonald
used his best efforts to get every parti
cle of speed out of the fast tiring trotter,
but was unable to make up the time lost
at the head of the stretch.
After the effort McDonald said he be
lieved Major Delmar could beat two min
utes with good runners and looked upon
the effort to-day as a wonderful perform
ance. Results:

Signs of Polluted Blood.
There is nothing so repulsive looking and disgusting as an old sore
You worry over it till the brain grows weary and work with it until the
patience is exhausted, and the very sight of the old festering, sickly looking
place makes you irritable, despondent and desperate "\ **
A chronic sore is the very best evidence that your blood is in airunhealthv
and impoverished condition, that your constitution is breaking down under
the effects of some serious disorder. The taking of strong medicines like
mercury or potash, will sometimes so pollute and vitiate the blood and im-
pair the general system that the merest scratch or bruise results in obstinate
non-healing sores of the most offensive character. âÂ»""Â¦*Â¦ * "

LONDON. Sept. 14.â Nothing has been
received confirmatory of the rumor cur

ing any mishap to a transport.
District Attorney Gregory, Constable
Charles Downing and officers from Benl
cia left Suisun at 3 o'clock this afternoon
in a gasolin% launch to carry out the In
struction.
Many murders have been committed in
the fishing camps along the Suisun Bay
during the past ten years, but owing to
thf manner in which the murderers have
been Bhielded by their fellow fishermen
the officers have 'been unable to ferret
out the guilty persons. When Sheriff Keys
became fully satisfied that young Potter
had been murdered he became determined
to bring the murderer to justice. With
the slightest 'clews at the outset he
worked incessantly until he succeeded,
after traveling hundreds of miles, in cap
turing his man. The arrest of Pensacola
reflects great credit on Sheriff Keys and
District Attorney Gregory, who worked
with him on the case.

When Daugherty. was arrested last

Graves and Carey. -The admission of
guilt made last night by Rutherford .; will

After a severe sweating by the police.
C. A. Rutherford, the Southern Pacnic
brakeman charged with looting freight
cars at Salinas, the story of which was
published first by The Call last Sunday,
confessed guilt last night and at the
same time Implicated W. H. Daugherty
Frank Carey and C. V. Graves as being
partners in the thefts.
Graves is a marine fireman and Daugh
erty was the man who rented a house on
the Castroville road about a mile from
Salinas, wherein, it is claimed, some of
tho stolen property' was placed after be
ing taken from the cars.
Graves is now in the City and County
Hospital, this city, having, it is claimed
injured his thumb while jumping from
one of the freight cars, after having been
engaged in stealing some of the mer
chandise, the loss of which has formed
part of the basis of the charges.
It is intended to prosecute the case with
the greatest vigor. The goods that have
been stolen from cars have not only been
the means of causing the greatest incon
venience to shippers and buyers, but the
monetary loss, it is said, has been very
Kreat.
CHILD'S LIFE IS CBUSHED

Three-Year-Old Joseph Allen Meets
a Tragic Death on Point
Lobos Avenue. " >: .
While attempting to jump' on a heavily
laden truck last evening Joseph Allen, the
three-year-old son of Mrs. Kate Allen of
107 Collins street, was crushed to death
beneath the wheels. The truck, drawn
by six horses driven by Banford Howard,
was coming down Point Lobos avenue
and owing to the fact that a heavy piece
of machinery was carried moved very
slowly. When near Collins street the
baby, who was playing in the road, ran
to the truck and attempted to jump on
the side. He slipped and fell directlv in
front of the rear wheel, which passed over
the body, crushing it in a frightful man
ner. Entirely oblivious of the fact that
he had run over and killed the child How
ard continued on his way. and the first
intimation he had of the tragedy was*
when some citizen informed him several
blocks from the scene. He Immediately
surrendered himself and was booked at
the City Prison on a charge of man
slaughter.
Beulah Allen, an elder sister of the dead
boy, was a witness of the dreadful af
fair and immediately summoned assist
ance. . The mancled and bleeding form
was carried to the house and Dr. Petrie
summoned. An examination showed that
the child was beyond medical aid and the
Coroner was notified. The body was not
removed to the Morgue and it is under
stood that the grief-stricken mother is
willing to waive an inquest, as she Is
convinced that It is purely a case of acci
dent.

Despite the fact that the trial of Dr.
Hammond and the incidents connected
with it have taken up a great deal of
time, the routine business of the confer
ence has been dispatched with unusual
rapidity, and now little remains but the

upon the result of the Hammond trial be
ing announced balloting for these dele
gates will be commenced, , and it is ex

pledged not to reveal anything until their
finding* are presented In open conference,
at which time it Js expected a summary
of the evidence will be given, as it is the
disposition of the conference to clear this
whole matter up to the satisfaction of the

presented their case, and It is understood
that Dr. Hammond will submit his de

Judicial . Investigations of the many
cases show, it is asserted, that 50 per cent
of the recent Armenian murders were the
work of Armenians who migrated from
Turkey and that the others were simply
the crimes of paid assassins.
The Journal Kvakas reports that se
rious disturbances occurred at Tlflis,
Trans-Caucasia, at midday Sunday, arising
from tHe reading to a crowd of 2000 per
sons assembled outside the Cathedral of
proclamations in the Armenian language.
The mob attacked the policemen with
stones and revolvers. The gendarmerie
went to the rescue of the police and a
fight ensued in which the gendarmes fired
their revolvers. Finally *. detachment of
Cossacks dispersed the rioters, several of
whom were wounded.
The correspondent further recounts an
other recent brutal attempt at the Alex
andropol railroad station in the presence
of a crow'd of people. In this case also
the murderer easily made good his
escape.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 14.â An ortho

PARIS, Sept. 14.â M. "Witte, president of
the Russian Council of Ministers, arrived
h'ere to-day. His visit is unofficial. After
a short stay here he will proceed to Lon

The belief which exists in several quar
ters that Witte's appointment to the pres
idency of the council was not wholly a
promotion prevails here also. It i3 un
derstood in the best informed quarters
here that the complications in the Man
churlan affair led to Witte's retirement
from the Ministry of Finance, where he
dominated the war, civil and other
branches. There is reason here to believe
that Witte lately has been unsympathetic

Officers at Suisun Beceive Instruc

Custody Until the Mys
tery Is Cleared.
District Attorney Gregory is in receipt
of a telegram from Sheriff Keys stating
that Pensacola has made a confession of
the murder. The Sheriff will arrive in Se
attle to-morrow and extradition papers
will be forwarded to him at once. In his
telegram the Sheriff instructed the offi
cers here to proceed at once to the scene
cf the murder and arrest the woman above
referred to and several other persons
whom he named, to be detained as wit
nesses. Under Sheriff Thomas Grennan,
From that time Sheriff Keys and Dis
trict Attorney Gregory continued the work
and to their efforts is due the ferreting
out of one of the foulest murders ever
committed in this county. From the time
they had Pensacola under suspicion they
btgan a hunt for him and traced him
from the scene of the murder to Vallejo,
to San Francisco and finally located him
at the fishing camp at New Westminster
on Sunday, where he was placed under
arrest.
The witness was unwilling to give any
satisfactory information and tried in
every way to mislead the officers by mak
ing contradictory Etatements.. Her first
statement was to the effect that she saw
two men in boats in an altercation and
when the boats came together the second
time she taw one strike the other two
blows. Afterward she sa!d she was cer
tain that Potter fell overboard while in
toxicated. The finding of the body proved
That her firft statement was correct. The
officers also learned that on the day that
the murder was committed Pensacola also
disappeared.
CHASE TO THE NORTH.
An investigation was immediately be
gun by Sheriff Keys and District Attor
ney Gregory, who went to Beniela on the
first train after receiving the information.
There they were joined by Constable Hyde
and Deputy Sheriff Harnett and a trip" to
the fishing camp was made in a gasoline
launch. Sheriff Keys and party were soon
convinced that a murder had been com
mitted, but could get no Information con
cerning it except that given by the wonv
an who witnessed the tragedy through
fif>ld classes. Hers was the only clew
given. The name of the assailant was not
then made known.
Potter was killed Tuesday, but the mat
ter was not reported to the' officials until
three days later. The deceased was in
the employ of Antone Berry, a fisherman.
The latter suspected foul play when his
employe did not return Tuesday after
noon and had been instituting a quiet
search for two or three days before re
porting the matter. On Friday Berry
called up District Attorney T. T. C. Greg
ory and reyorted the disappearance of
Potter. Although berry did not intimate
that a murder had been committed, the
officials suspected the true state of af
fairs.
FIRST NEWS OF CBIME.
When Potter's body was found several
days afterward on the Contra Costa shore
a d<to cut under the left eye, a stab
in the back eight Inches deep and one
and a half inches in width showed that
he had undoubtedly been knocked down
with the first blow and then stabbed in
the back while lying- face downward.
The murdered boy and Pensacola were
employed In the different fishing camps
on Suisun Bay at what is known as the
"cut off" of Montezuma Slough. At this
place is a scow settlement of fishermen,
the principal one being known as the Big
Alec tcow. At this place tho man and
boy met that day and from what can be
learned cot Into an altercation. Shortly
afterward Potter started to return to his
scow in a Ekiff and was closely followed
thereafter by Pensacola in a fishing boat.
The latter overtook him Vbout a third
of a mile from the starting point and it
was then that the tragedy was enacted.
Pensacola was seen to Bail around Pot-
Ur's boat two or three times, the boats
coming tocether twice.
SDXSUN, Sept. 14.â GeorgÂ© Pensacola,
otherwise known as George Pachy, the
murderer who stabbed Fred Potter, a
boy, to death In a boat on Suisun Bay
en the afternoon of Tuesday, August IS,
and then cast his victim's body into the
bay, was run down yesterday by James
A. Keys, Sheriff of Solano County. The
arrest was madÂ© at New Westminster.

weeks.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Tha rumor was current In official cir
cles last night that Deputy United States
Marshal William P. Gamble, better known
as "Pete" Gamble, could not be found,
and is supposed to have left the city.
Gamble was the official who escorted the
six Chinese to the wharf at which tha
steamer Gaelic lay that tfiey might be
deported, and out of which case hai^
grown ugly scandal.
Little doubt is expressed that the dep
uty marshal has gone. It is stated that
a chain of evidence has been woven about
him so strong that he cannot possibly es
cape prosecution for complicity in the
substitution of the Monogollans. Men
prominent in the bureau state that tha
authorities will not have to depend on tha
evidence of Chinese alone to bring Gam
ble to justice, but that other evidence of
a most conclusive character has been se
cured, the nature of which they refuse to
divulge until the Grand Jury meets, the
latter part of this week.
Sensations are about to break in the
case. The District Attorney's office has
in its possession facts that will implicate
several whlta men. and some of them
are well known in this city. The bureau
was aware that the substitution would
be made before the morning on which
the steamer was to sail. Inspectors were
detailed to the wharf and will be able
to give testimony as to the entire trans
action. At present there are several Chi
nese in Chinatown under the surveillance
of the authorities and these are likely
to be arrested at any moment. Confes
sions and admissions are in the possession
of Chief Inspector'Meehan and everything
willbe laid before the Grand Jury.
Yesterday was an arduous one for
United State3 District Attorney Marshall
B. Woodworth and United States Mar
shal Shine. From early in the moraine
until 5:12 p. m. they were investigating
the substitution of six Chinese and they
were so engrossed in the case that they
were unable to go Jo their lunch.
At the conclusion of the session Mr.
Woodworth announced that he had al
most completed his Investigation, but that
he would not be prepared to take the
matter before the Federal Grand Jury
until Friday. He said he had nothing to
give out for publication except the state
ment that Tom Yung, the Chinese grafter
'now under arrest, appeared to be the only
Chinese person implicated in the scheme.
As Steward Leslie of the steamship Gae
lic had sailed away on the Gaelic, he said,
the case would remain to a Certain extent
Incomplete until his return, which would
be about the middle of October. On hla
arrival here he will be given an opportu
nity of making a very complete statement
as to whether the six .men delivered to
him on board the Gaelic by Mr. Gamble
were the six who were afterward taken
off the vessel by order of the United
States District Attorney. He has already
said that they were the same, but a more
extended and comprehensive statement
from him Is'd3ired. B'QMS
The manner in which the Chinese bu
reau handled the case has given rise to
much adverse comment. The facts that
the substitutes were allowed to remain on
board the ship for about three hours be
fore being taken ashore; that officers
were not sent to watch the jail on Friday
morning and shadow the carriage con
taining the Chinese and Gamble, and that
the men were not "stood up" at the gang
plank as soon as Gamble was about to
deliver them have occasioned much sur
prise. Had the necessary steps been ta
ken the guilt or Innocence of Deputy
Gamble would not have remained a mo
ment in doubt. As the case now stands
the defense, should Gamble be arrested,
will plead that there was opportunity for.
the substitution to have taken place on
the steamer during the three hours that
elapsed from the time of the reception oÂ£
the men until they were taken on shore.

ber of Chinese.
Arresfc Is Made in British

Long Chase.
Several members of the faculty of the
University of California, Including Presi
dent Wheeler, are among the members
of the new club. Other members are Mrs.
Phoebe A. Hearst.Mrs. H. E. Huntington.
Mrs.A. H. Voorhies, Mrs. John Simpson,
George McNear, Will Taylor, Joseph
Garber, Mrs. Cyrus Walker, Mrs. Elea
nor Martin and Mrs. Ira Martin.
The officers of the club are: Edwin
Goodall. president : Frank M. Wilson,
vice president: William P. Johnson, treas
urer; Sam Bell McKee, secretary.
Sam Bell McKee, secretary of the
club, admitted that there had been a
hitch in the purchase of the Adams prop
erty, but declined to say whether or not
the Rock Ridge grounds would be pur
chased.
The Adams property consists of 124
acres and is deemed an ideal spot for a
country club. â¢ The Rock Ridge or old
Livermore grounds form 106 acres of fine
property. Either of the above is. consid
ered an excellent spot for the country
home of such a club.
Attorney de Golla said that next week
the arrangements would be I completed so
that the building of the club grounds
could proceed without a hitch.
HITCH IN PURCHASE.
George E. de Golla, attorney for the
club, when Interviewed to-day in regard
to the club's new move intimated that tho
Rock Ridge property would be purchased.
He declined to state which way the mem.
bers of the new club leaned, but said that
if the members saw a way to save be
tween 530,000 and $40,000 they would un
doubtedly do so, leaving it to be inferred
that Havens had made an offer to sell
the Rock Ridge property at a price far
below that which Adams had asked for
his Claremont ground.
The club has now split into two fac
tions, one advocating the purchase, of the
Rock Ridge property, in North Oakland,
owned by the Realty Syndicate, and the
other still holding that the Claremont
land would make the more desirable place
for a country club.
Prank C. Havens of the Realty Syndi
cate, with the aid of William P. Johnson,
treasurer of the club, who interjected the
Rock Ridge property, known as the old
Livermore tract, into the field, seems to
have exerted enough Influence to switch
the purchase to Havens' land.
So certain were the officers of the club
that Adams' Claremont property would
be the home of the club that several
members took initial steps and erected a
number of bungalows throughout the;
property. The grounds command a fine
view of Oakland and the Golden Gate and
are easily reached from Claremont ave
nue. . .. - :
There has been a hitch in the purchase
o* the property to be used by the recently
formed Oakland Country Club for its
country home.- A new site for the home
of the club has been put into the field.
The club was formed recently, and It
was the Intention of its promoters to ex
cel Burllngame. The membership Is com
posed of Alameda County's most promi
nent, exclusive and wealthy citizens.
At the time of the club's inception it
was given out that an option upon a piece
of property near Claremont, owned by
Edson F. Adams, had been seoured. The
Immediate purchase of the land and the
erection of a 140,000 clubhouse were con
sidered a certainty.
Golf links, tennis courts, polo grounds
and runs for .the cross-country rides were
to bo constructed. All outdoor sports
were to be held there, and it was the in
tention of the club to make its new or
ganization by far the best on the coast.
The main endeavor of the club was to put
the Oountry Club of Burllngame in the
shade completely.
Bonds for 1150,000 were to have been is
sued for the purchase of the home
grounds and perfection of the retreat.

PEKING, Sept. 14.-CW Chung Tung,
Director of Commerce, is urging the Min
isters to use their influence with Prince
Ching, the president of the Foreign Of
fice, to reject the latest Russian propos
als regarding the evacuation of Manchu
ria. He fears that Ching will accept
them unless pressure is brought to bear
on him. M. Uchida. the Japanese Minis
ter here, has warned Ching against the
acceptance of the Russian propositions.
Minister Conger desires that the port on
the Yalu River to be opened shall be
Yangtung instead of Tatungtao, naval
reports showing that Yangtung has the
best harbor.
LONDON. Sept. 14.â Japan and Great
Britain have exchanged views on the lat
est demands made by Russia on China,
and decided to protest separately to the
Peking government against their accept
ance. In case this should prove fruitless
and Russia continue her occupation of
Manchuria, Japan proposes to break off
the negotiations with Russia for a defini
tion of their respective rights in Manchu
ria and Korea, and to demand of the St.
Petersburg government that it order the
evacuation of Chinese territory.
"We cannot permit the postponement of
the evacuation," said the Japanese
authority, "for Russia would utilize the
additional time to strengthen her fleet
and army In the Far East. Already her
naval tonnage there is equal to ours. Pub
lic sentiment in Japan is deeply stirred by
Russia's failure to carry out her promises
to evacuate Manchuria and demands the
withdrawal of her troops on the date fixed
a year ago."
MINISTERS HIT
COURT FINDINGS
Throughout the volume one is shown
Bismarck's devotion to the King of Prus
sia and the latter's great ability to guide
the policy of his .kingdom and influence
the politics of other countries. The let
ters supply most valuable glimpses into
the hidden history of the days of Bis
marck and William I.
Volume II of the letters is equally in
teresting and gives the true explanation
of many hitherto obscure incidents of
the past.
It Is a remarkable coincidence that the dis
cussion of this manifesto which is to be
presented to our royal master takes place on
the birthday of the youngest heir to the throne.
In this coincidence, gentlemen, we eee a re
doubled call to enter the lists boldly for the
kingly rights, boldly for the rights of his Maj
esty's successors. The Prussian kingly office
has not yrt fulfilled Its mission; it is not yet
ready to be dovetailed like a red piece of ma
chinery Into the mechanism of the parliamen
tary regime.
How well Bismarck carried out hlB
master's will and introduced the "patri
otic sentence" can be seen In* the follow
ing extract from a speech which he made
the same day, January 27, 1863, in the
Landtag. He said: â¢
Good luck to you. Make it very clear
that the second (lower) house la abusing Its
rights, and is working the ruin of the coun
try; that the upper house has also abused
Its rights and has placed Itself 'oh the side
of the Government; defect In the constitu
tion; that there also the Kins has only to con-
Fult his royal duty, and work the machine
without a budget until the account 1Â» subse
quently laid before the Becond Chamber and
voted v Â¦
The Prince also desired that certain of
his personal political letters exchanged
with his contemporaries should be- made
public, as they were to be made a sup
plement and authenticate his biography.
The Prince himself selected these letters,
which w*re found after his death care
fully arranged in portfolios.
The work is in two volumes. The cor
respondence with William I is contained
in the first volume; in the second volume
la the correspondence with other political
personages. Among the letters in volume
I (dated Coblentz, January 29, 1S53) is one
from William I (the Prince of Prussia)
to Bismarck, in which the former refers
to the marriage between Napoleon III and
the Countess Montijo, as follows:
The Montijo marriage 6eta me agreeably at
rest, because no European princely house need
unite Itself with the parvenu. I am cu
rious to Bee h(jw thlÂ«' episode will agree with
Napoleonâ politically and corporally. Only no
sleeping on our sideâ but also no nonsensical
writing, Ilka the Kreux Zeltung, which Is com
pletely crazy. Tours, PR. OF P.
That Â«lVilliam I had a firm hold of the
helm of state may be Judged from a let
ter which he sent to Bismarck January
27, 1863, reading:
I want to remind you, in connection with
to-day's battle, that to-day Is the birthday of
my grandson, my second successor, If God
so wills, which might perhaps be mentioned
In a patriotic sentence Jf it could be j made
convenient.
NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â An additional
chapter in the history of the world will
be published here and in London to-mor^
row by the Frederick A. Stokes Com
pany. It consists of the correspondence
between "William I and Bismarck and
other letters from and to Prince Bis
marck, which have been translated from
the German by J. A. Ford. These letters,
it is stated, are published by the late
Prince Bismarck's express desire, as he
considered they would show better than
can be done In any other way "the uniqae
relationship which existed between him
and bin auzust master."

Headaches From
Army Life,
Finally Caused Nerv-
ous Dyspepsia.
Dr. Miles' Nervine Cured
Me.
Nervousness, indigestion and insomnia are *
the three greatest afflictions of mankind.
Attended as they are by a thousand dis-
agreeable symptoms ths victim is in constant
misery. Pity the person who cannot sleep,
enjoy his food nor secure rest and peace vi
mind. Dr. Miles' Nervine is z sure cure for
all three maladies. It soothes ths brain.
strengthens the nerves of the stomach and
digestive organs, bringing sleep, rest, health,
strength and a good digestif.
"Smallpox contracted while in the army,
left me with a disease of the spir.e, nearly
blind, and with a complication of nervous
affections. Perhaps the most distressing of
all my troubles were the sick headaches
which grew more frequent and sever: as the
years passed by, until 1 became a confinnel
dyspeptic with all the characteristic symp-
toms of nervousness, indigestion, ana in*
somnia. In roy search for health, I left m*
old home in Aroostoolt county, Maine, and
located in the west. Soon after coming here
my attention was called to Dr. Miles' Re-
storative Nervine, and I decided to try it.
It soon stopped my headaches and I have
not had one since. When I had taken si*
bottles my health was wonderfully improved
.in every way. I am well today, eat and
sleep all right and in fact feel that my youth
has been renewed."â). B. Byron, New

Owners of coastwise vessels are preparing to
make a battle for business and there is in im
mediate prospect a rate war which will affect a
large fleet of all kinds of coasters. The rate
for lumber frcm Puget Sound to this port has
for some time been $4 50 and $5 50 to southern
ports. That the rate remained at this figure
wts due to the mutual efforts of the majority
of the lecal ship owners, who, without entering
into any agreement, are said to have been
unanimous in declining business at a lower
Pgure. The steam schooner men, however, are
charged with having cut the rates, and yester
day the word was passed . around among the
ship owners that for the present the primeval
law cf every man for himself would rule the
carrying of coast lumber. That rates will be
cut Is certain, and It is also in the plan of
campaign to put into the trade a few very
large carriers, vessels now engaged in off shore
business and with a carrying capacity esti
mated in the millions. With these large car
riers and the aid of a very -low rate it is pro
posed to teach the rate shavers a lesson and
incidentally to bring to a speedy close the bat
tle for unremuneratl\-e business
Coastwise Rate War.

Tho gasoline schooner Monterey is having
fair succef* in the whaling waters and is ex
pected to come home with a very good catch.
The latest news from the little whaler reachej
here yesterday in a letter from Edward Peters,
the Monterey's engineer, to Frank Peters, port
engineer for the Henry Peterson gasoline
launch fleet. When the Monterey left here old
whalers laughed at Captain Foley for thinking
he could get near whales with anything #o
noity as a gasoline engine. According to Pe
ttrE, the auxiliary power has been the salva
tion of the cruise and without it the Monterey
would have returned to pert most dismally
"clean." She has already got one whale.
ThrÂ«* others were harpooned, but lost, and a
fouith had to be abandoned. Thif fourth
-.'. â¢.;.:.Â¦ was killed and made fast alongside, but
before the sharp spades of the bone and blub
ber cutters could transfer the odoriferous treas
ure to the Bchocner's hold a stcrm compelled
the cutting adrift cf the prize. One of the
whale* that wa& lost capsized a boat and got
away in the dark. Mste Wilson was In the
upturned boat. and. according to Peters, has
little hope of recovering from the effects of the
Fubmersion. The Peters letter was written
July 31 from Pirates Cove. Wilfon was con
fired to his bunk, and. to all appearances, a
dyirjr man. The Monterey was to leave for
the Bering Sea and Captain Foley did not ex
pect to go to the Arctic.

marking down of the Andcra, out 146 days
from Balti?nore for Iquique, from 35 to 20

There was added to the list of overdues

nothing is heard of them in the meantime
they will be posted at Lloyds in about two
weeks as missing. The time between now
and the formal declaration of their pass
ing will be used in investigating all avail
able sources of Information In the hope
of learning some reason other than ship
wreck for their non-appearance. The
Helen Brewer left Java March 6 for Del
aware Breakwater and is thus out 193
days â considerably longer than the long
est passage previously recorded. That
unusual calms have prevailed in the wat
ers through which lay her course has
been shown by the experience of other
vessels and hope in the brewer's safety
dies hard. The vessel Is well known here
and more than $225,000 has been wagered
on her "to arrive," at rates varying from
75 to 90 per cent.
The Milton ! Park is out 16S days from
London for Fremantle. There has been
comparatively little speculation on her
"to arrive," the coast for which she was
heading being notoriously fatal for crip
pled ships. Hope is still expressed for the
Helen Brewer, but the Milton Park has
for some time been looked upon as lost.

It has been reported that the zone ex

way through which many nundr*eds, if
not thousands, "of Chinese laborers have
entered the United States without the
aid of the Chinese Bureau. It is believed
that Mr. North's forthcoming report will
be the means of putting an end to this
mode of evadlnc the exclusion act.
After a week spent in Inspecting the
topography and political morality of the
Mexican border "In its relation to the Chi
nese exclusion act United Btate3 Immi
gration Inspector Hart H. North returned
to his office yesterday prepared to make
an elaborate report on the situation to
the Bureau of Commerce and Labor, of

Cortelyou has addressed a drastic circu

iting them from admit tine In the pres
ence of newspaper men that It is even
a fine day from an Oriental viewpoint Mr.
North was unable to detail the result of
his cxrerience so far as it related to the
smuggling of Chinese.
He was permitted to state, however,
that he went to San Dieeo by rail and
from that burg of first class newspapers
and watering places he proceeded by rail
to the Mexican town of Tla Juana. From
that town he traveled by private convey
ance alone the border for about sixty
miles from "west to east on the zone lying
between fifty and sixty miles south of
the bonndnry line, all in Mexican terri
tory. He emerged into the United States
at two points, the first at Campo and
the second at Tacumba. Then taking

An Eastern Trip
Made Easy.
Experience has tanghtus just what
to provide in order to make the long
overland trip attractive. The sleeping
cars used for our weekly "Personally
Conducted" parties are just as com-
fortable as a car can be. The sleeping
berth3 are even a little bit more roomy
than those in the standard Pullman
cars, and the linen and blankets used
are the same in each.
The price for a double berth is only
$5 to Omaha or Kansas City, $6 to
Chicago or St. Loui3, and $8 to Boston.
Less than half the palace car price.
The route is through Salt Lake City
and past the grand scenery of the
Rockiesâ the most intensely interest-
ing ride in America.
Kindly call or write for particulars. S

Judge, or ex-Judgreâ Judge Spencer of
Ansonâ was killed by a turkey. He was
a very old man and was sitting: in the
yard with a red skull cap on his head.
The red attracted the attention of the

the wearer of the cap and pecked, spur
red and beat hiiu 'Â« death."â Charlotto

CHICAGO. Sept. 14. â The stronn factor In
wheat was the bad weather In the Northwest
and higher prices In other markets, helped also
by the sharp rally in corn. Under these in
fluences December was bid up from the open
ing. 82^c. to 82%@82*ic. There was con
siderable lonÂ« wheat sold on the early bulges
and the advance was not without Its setbacks,
although never entirely losing its rise. Ad
vices from the Northwest were also sÂ«nsa- Â¦
tlonal rain and snow belns reported as very j
general, and much growing wheat Is believed '
to be ruined. Against this Influence, however, ]
were bearish statistics showing enormous [
world's shipments, largely Increased amounts 1
on ocean passaee and Increased Liverpool I
etocks. The market eased off. toward the 1
close on proflt-takinsr. but closed steady at a ,
gain of HC at B2J4Â©82%&
Corn futures were in active demand from :
the trade generally and particularly from those I
who had it sold for short account. The critical
situation of the crop, owing- to the freezing
temperatures, accompanied by snowstorms
through the Northwest ever Sunday, caused
bullish markets, and as the day progressed
there was no cessation In the buyirx. Decem
ber closed l%c over Saturday's final figures,
having sold up from M\c at the opening to
52?4c. when the demand was strongest. The
prediction of further frosts* in ntarby corn
States- to-night was also a great incentive to
buy and there was very ttttle corn to be had
at any time.
Oats' strength was partly in sympathy with
corn and partly due to bad weather. Decem
ber closed at 38e. a net gain of UÂ®%c.
Corn was also responsible for the strength
in provisions. Small packers were the prin
cipal buvers. The close was 20o hither for
October pork, lard 10@12%c up n.n<J ribs 32%c
hither.

AUBURN, N. Y., Sept. 14.-Clarence
Egner of Buffalo was to-day put to death
in the electric chair for the murder of
Archibald Benedict, a keeper In Auburn
prison.
Egner was a convict and had more than
once been punished by Benedict for dis
obedience. On January i>, 1901, Benedict
reprimanded Egner for talking to another
convict. Egner armed himself with an
iron bar and lay in wait for the keeper.
When Benedict passed him Egner in
stantly sprang from behind and dealt
Benedict a .crushing blow on the head,
fracturing, the skull. The victim sank to
his~knees, when Egner espied, the butt of
his revolver protruding from his hip pock
et. He then seized the weapon and shot
Benedict in the back of the head. Death
was \ instantaneous. Egner then ' surren
dered to the prison authorities. He was
26 . years >, old and served under another
name in the war with Spain. ~

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Practical illustrations of what irriga
tion is doing for the West will not be
lacking. From all quarters are coming
large exhibits of grain and fruits grown
in soil that a few years ago was consid
ered utterly useless to compete for the
rich prizes and valuable cups offered, and
this horticultural exhibit bids fair to be
one of the most unique as well as most
elaborate ever shown. Even from across
the Great American Desert, drawn in six
"prairie schooners," is coming an exhibit
of fruit and grain grown In the midst of
alkali wastes. Practical illustrations of
methods of irrigation will be given, and
a good part of one day will be devoted by
the delegates to this feature.
Another important subject that will
come up is 'the question of affiliation with
the Trans-Mississippi Congress, and it is
expected that before the congress ad
journs some definite action will be taken.
OGDEN, Utah, Sept. 14.â "When Senator
"VV. A. Clark of Montana, as president of
the National Irrigation Congress, calls to
order; the first. session of the annual meet
ing of that body in the Tabernacle to
morrow there will be probably gathered
the largest number of representatives to
an Irrigation congress that have met since
the inception of the .movement in 1S9L
Every train to-day brought in delegates
by the hundred, representatives from the
far eastern tier of the so-called semi-arid
States being among the early arrivals.
It Is expected that nearly 1500 repre
sentatives of boards of trade, commercial
clubs, chambers of commerce and busi
ness organizations of all kinds and of
State and municipal governments of the
great "West will be present and take part
In the four-day discussion of irrigation.
The speakers on the various subjects
will include besides Secretary of Agricul
ture Wilson, United States Senators Clark
and Gibson of Montana, Dubols of Idaho,
Warren of Wyoming and Burton of Kan
sas. Senators Kearna and 3moot of Utah
are expected to speak informally. Every
phase of the subject of ~ irrigation will be
discutFci 1 . and the closely allied subject
of colonization of the great plains and
ranges of the West will receive much at
tention.

CHEHALIS, Wash., Sept 14.-The find
ing of the decomposed body of James H.
Wilkinson, a well-known rancher, on his
farm near Chehalis has created a sensa
tion at this place. Apparently the ranch
er was murdered in his lonely house
about a month ago.
Two neighbors were passing Wllkinson'a
house and stopped to look In. As they
neared the -house a sickening smell greet
ed them. On investigation they could see
Wilkinson's body lying on the floor near
the door. By his side wa3 his rifle, which
contained an empty shell. The body
showed no gunshot wounds, but the mur
derer evidently figured that the discover
ers of the body would conclude that Wil
kinson had committed suicide.
An examination of the skull showed
how the man had met his death. The
scalp was removed and squarely In tfie
top of the skull was found a hole where
it had been crushed by a heavy blow. On
Clie left arm was found evidences of
where a blow had been struck also, ap
parently while Wilkinson was warding off
his assailant.
A search of the premises revealed a
three-pound sledge hammer in the wood
shed adjoining the house. On this was
found some of the dead man's hair.
The motive for the crime was evidently
personal, as a large sum of money wad
found In the bureau.

IRRIGATIONS
ARE ENTHUSIASTIC
Later there were lively passages at arms
between Herr Bebel and Herr Voltmar.
Finally the debate was adjourned until
to-morrow.
"It is an untruth," shouted Herr Bebel
in a frenzied rage to Heinrich Braun,
who was engaged in proving that even
the classic leaders of Social Democracy
were guilty of this.
Herr Singer, the president of the con
gress, stopped Herr Bebel and asked tEe
members to preserve their dignity and
refrain from behaving like schoolboys.
Herr Bebel, who was much excited, de
manded to know tftiom the president
meant.

existing capitalistic system, he asserted,
would be precipitated first in the great
trans-Atlantic republic and would spread
thence to Europe, "leading to the unlver
cial dominion of Social Democracy."
discussion took place at the
afternoon session of the congress, due to
a resolution of the executive council, pro
hibiting the literary members of the So
cialist party from contributing article:* to
non-Socialistic papers.
The resolution was mainly directed
against the so-called academicians, who
claim the place of honor in the party by
virtue of their learning, while gaining
their livelihood by writing for newspapers
antagonistic to the Socialistic movement.
Angry recriminations were lndulgvd In
and at one time violent scenes appeared
to be imminent.
DRESDEN, Sept. 14.â Representatives
of three million Social Democratic voters,
more than a quarter of the entire German
electorate, began their annual congress
to-day. Herr Bebel and Herr von "Woll

expected to join Issue to-morrow regard
ing the adoption of ooportunist tactics
during the. coming sessions of the Reich
stag:. Meanwhile the delegates discussed
the financial business of the party and
listened to addreses from the foreign dele

Â» Gaylor Wilshlre, in the name of the So
cialists of the United States, congratu

Germany on their "mat-velous organiza

triumphs." Wilshlre said the antagonism

am sorry to say. but he and I understand
cne another. The greatest 1 writer of tragedy
that ever lived, the Hon. William Shakespeare,
never wrote a tragedy but he Injected a lit
tle piece of comedy through It. We nearly had
our tragedy In the beginning. Now let's have
a little comedy, even If we lose. We may not
win this time, but, gentlemen, as sure as the
sun rises and sets we will win the next time.
We are the pioneers who to-nigbt are going to
sow the seed that is going- to bring back the
Democrats that have been driven away within
the laetjive years. They nailed the ballot box
so high at the primary that God knows, while
I am tall enough, I couldn't see whether the
ballot was dropped into the box or on to the
floor. Therefore, gentlemen, without any fur
ther remarks. I would second the nomination
of my old friend, O'Donnell, and may he and
Hickey have a tight race, and even If he is.
which I am not, even If he Is a Horse and Cart,
I hope he has been shod properly. (Laughter
and applause.)
John H. Mullen of the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict also seconded the nomination of
O'Donnell. He was interrupted by the
McNab contingent, but did not mind. He
appealed for the election of O'Donnell and
gave many reasons why he should be se
lected chairman. Nominations were de
clared closed, and Joseph Slye of the For
ty-second District and William D. Hynes
of the Thirty-sixth District were appoint
ed tellers, and kept tab on the votes. The
roll call continued very smoothly until the
Fortieth District was reached. There was
a division in this district, and trouble was
experienced in recording the vote. Wil
liam Ross startled the convention by vot
ing for David I. Mahoney for chairman.
There was a loud outburst of laughter.
There was a squabble over the vote in
this district. Ross claimed the right to
vote the absentees, and Sidney M. Van
Wyck Jr. protested. Ross rushed toward
the platform with a proxy, and Kelly,
who had taken the chair, declined to look
at it. ' â¢ .
"I don't want to see that," said Kelly
with feeling.
"Read it!" "Read it!" "Insult!" and
other such replies came from all parts of
the hall. Kelly then took the paper and
read it. He informed the convention that
it was an authorization to vote, but un
signed. â¢

John J. McCarthy of the Thirty-seventh
District took the platform at this junc
ture and placed Joseph E. O'Donnell in
nomination for temporary chairman. He
spoke as follows:
I have the " extreme pleasure , and honor of
nominating, as I believe, one of the best
Democrats Inr San Francisco. In our district
the Thirty-seventh, we have been demanding
recognition for the past ten years from Demo
crats. The gentleman that I am placing in
nomination to-night will treat all Democrats
as such: he Is a liberal man and a good Dtmo
crat. I .have the extreme pleasure and honor
of placing before you the name of Mr Joseph
B. O'Donnell as chairman of this convention.
When the cheering for O'Donnell had
subsided George E. Gallagher took the
platform, and in seconding the nomina
tion, spoke in part as follows: â¢
Gentlemen, this thing- is getting entirely too
serious. - think we have got too much tragedy
engendered here this evening. When the gen
tleman who first took the rostrum to call the
meeting to order usurped the right of the grand
old Democratic party he did wrong. We have
a man here who has been accused of bclnjr
asleep at the switch. No, , air: Â¦ he - has been
keeping my friends awake, and very much
awake. You might think I have come here to
second Tom Hickey's nomination. Not * so - i
O'DONNELL HAS FRIENDS.
It is with exceeding pleasure' that ! I arise
for the purpose of seconding the nomination
of an esteemed and beloved friend; a young
Democrat, zealous In the cause of Democracy.
This is not entirely a matter of' .personal
friendship with me. I have a knowledge that
the candidate whoso name I am , seconding
possesses all the qualifications necessary for
an ideal chairman, and It is with great pleas
ure that I second the name of my, esteemed
and genial friend Thomas W. Hickey for the
position of temporary chairman of this conven
tion. ' "
At the threshold of our deliberations we are
confronted with the task of selecting a worthy
delegate into whose keeping as presiding of
ficer over the deliberations of this convention
we shall entrust the gavel of parliamentary
command. We are about to confer a high
trust, to elevate one of our number upon the
floor. To govern so diversified a body requires
a man of clear head, good Intellect, powerful
moral resources, high equity and strong will;
a man who can unite with harmonious de
cision and undlscrlminating gentleness and
courtesy all these elements upon this floor, upon
whose deliberations he may be called upon of
ficially to rule. Capability and sternness will
be our criterion. I have come upon this ros
trum to present to your consideration the name
of a man who unites In himself theae quali
fications. I have reference to the gentleman
who now creditably fills the chairman's chair.
It requires no other than the syllabling of th
name of Thomas W. Hickey to excite this as
sembly, to inspire in all its component parts a
thorough sense that In him you have a man
pre-eminently possessed of the attributes neces
sary to govern our deliberations. In addition
he has fairly won the right to this recognition
by previous services. I need not tell you of
his campaigning year after year in this mu
nicipality, for that is already known to you.
I need not tell you of his ready Sacrifice of
time and business interests when called upon
to accompany California's grandest and
noblest Democrat In -a campaign throughout the
State and the heroic service he renderedtin. that
campaign. I am delighted to give you the
name of the able, sterling Democrat from the
Thirtieth Assembly District for chairman' of
this convention, Thomas W. Hickey. (Great
applause.)
"Are there any other nominations?"
asked Hickey.
"Well,, I should say yes," replied a dele
gate in the rear of the hall and. a. loud
shout of merriment arose. Matthew' Brady
of the Fortieth District was recognized,
and- amid cries of "Hoot mon!" he sec
onded the nomination of Thomas W.
Hickey. Brady spoke in part as follows:
I thank the honorable gentleman for the con
fidence that he has placed in my sincerity in
assuring you that I shall not seek any advan
tage in opening this convention. Ab secretary
of the County Committee and a delegate of this
convention. I have a right to open the conven
tion. It Is Indeed a most delicate position, but
I assure you. gentlemen, that I shall conduct
myself the best I know how and as far as I can
under the circumstances. Nominations for
temporary chairman aro In order.
Kelly was recognized and with few in
terruptions spoke as follows:
"This Is a Democratic convention.
(Cries of "You bet," "It is.") And I ask
you to listen a moment to the gentleman
who I presume will be my honorable
opponent."
O'Donnell motioned to Hickey to con
tinue, and Hickey further said:
Hickey then strode forth from the
wings and picked up the heavy hammer
and commenced to batter on the iron
plate, yelling for order at the same time.
Three cheers were given for Hickey and
the opposition came back with three
hearty cheers for O'Donnell. Order was
at last obtained. Hickey called O'Don
nell to the platform, and when Joseph E.
was at his side Hickey spoke as follows:
HICKEY RESTORES ORDER.
He could go no further. His next sen
tence was lost in the clamor against his
speaking. Kelly went through pantomime,
but the more he gesticulated the more the
crowd hooted.
i
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention," said Kelly. "On the thresh
old "
There were more cries for Hickey from
all parts of the hall. In response to them
Hickey ascended the platform. Before he
reached it, however, McDonald started to
resume business. "The first business of
the evening." he yelled, but could not con
tinue further as the jeers, catcalls and
hoots -drowned his voice.
"I declare nominations for chairman in
order," cried McDonald. He recognized
Kelly, who stood beside him, and Kelly
started to speak. O'Donnell clamored for
recognition, but was overlooked. Colonel
Chynski attempted to get O'Donnell rec
ognition by raising his military voice in
command, but failed.
"This convention is not organized!"
cried O'Donnell. "No one has a right on
the floor until the convention is organ
ized."
him to be heard. William M. Cannon of
the Thirty-fifth District tried his voice
and also gave it up as a bad job. Kelly
demanded that the convention proceed
with the regular order. During the up
roar Joe O'Donnell, leader of the minor
ity, took his place alongside William Hoff
Cook and made things uncomfortable for
McDonald. . .
The roll was then called,, amid great
confusion, on the original motion of Put
nam for the appointment of; a committee
of'five, and the motion was'declared car
ried by the following -vote: Ayes, 209;

the "Horse and Cart" delegates walked
out, amid great confusion, and others, in
cluding whole delegations, refused to vote.
It was given out that the withdrawal was
"for the purpose of consultation," but it
was generally supposed to presage a bolt.
The vote was announced, as follows:
Ayes, 75%; '. noes, 202, and the amendment
was declared lost.
DELEGATES WALK OUT.
De Martini was escorted to the plat
form and thanked the delegates for the
honor in a facetious speech.
Upon motion of Thomas C. Curran of
the Thirty-fifth District the Drinted roll
call of the convention, with the exception
of the two districts where there were
contests, was accepted as the official roll
of the convention. There was a good deal
of discussion over the motion and many
amendments were made to it, but the
chairman was empowered to appoint a
committee of five on contested elections. -
Thomas J. Kennedy of the -Thirty-fourth
District moved that the temporary offi
cers of the convention be made perma
nent and this started another squabble.
The "Horse and Carts" declined to have
this done until permanent organization
had been effected. Chairman Hickey
stood by the programme and' ruled out
all amendments to the motion.
. Osgood Putnam then made the motion
that created an uproar. He moved that
a committee of five be appointed to select
a, Board of Supervisors. George E. Gal
lagher complained that It was a hasty
action and it looked as if an attempt was
made to choke the programme down their
throats. William Hoff Cook also pro
tested asrainst the motion and tried to
amend it by having a committee of
eighteen appointed, one from each district
and no district to have more than one
candidate. Colonel Choynski tried to take
a hand, but was ruled out of order. Gal
lagher thought he had the thing solved
by making a motion -to lay the entire sub
ject matter on the table. This was lost
by a vote of 203 to 134. O'Donnell then
offered as an, amendment to" the amend
ment that a committee of eighteen be
appointed without any quantisations.
Cook accepted the amendment to his
amendment. . *. ,^:;^
Walter J. de Martini and Clarence V.

WANTS HONEST CANDIDATES.
Honesty and fitness are the two main quali
ties that the people demand m municipal of
ficers. Through a course of events in which
all of us have borne a part, I am proud to
assert, the people of San Francisco have come
to look to the Democratic party alone for
honest and fit candidates for public office. The
people know that the Republican, party organiz
ation In this city is a marionette owned and
controlled and operated by the astute chief o
the Southern Pacific Railroad and managed
for the benefit of corporations and politicians.
The people know, too, that the so-called labor
party, as to-day constituted, has been be
trayed into the hands of Republican politicians
by false leaders and Is now part and parcel of
the Republican organization. That Republican
organization Is seeking to employ the so-called
Labor party to divide Democratic strength by
drawing worklngmen away from the Demo
cratic party, which stands for all that they
stand for. There Is nothing: in common be
tween the worklngmen and the Republican
party. There is much In common between the
worklngmen and the Democratic party. And
I am convinced that the workingmen of this
city have already seen the truth and that they
will- not put their trust in men who are Re
publicans in disguise and who will lead them
into a blind path and betray them.
The people, as I have said, look to this con
vention to give them honest and fit candi
dates. We are in a peculiarly fortunate and
gratifying position. The Democratic party of
this city has proved Its claim to the respect
and confidence of that largo majority of the
citizens who wish to elect good and true men
to public office and who lnvaris*-"-- vote rlcht
when they are not deceived. The Democratic
party gave this city the best administration,
the strongest, cleanest, most enlightened Board
of Sunervlsors It ever had, an administration
that shines out between what went before and
what came after as a bright stretch shines in
a dark roadway.
Nomination of a man by this convention
meens to the public that he Is a fit and worthy
man. Let us see to it that the candidates
â¢we shall nominate are fit and worthy men, for
the people rely on this convention to give them
light and leading and to take measures for the
safety of the city, and It is a sacred trust.
The approaching campaign shall be a fight
for the city.. Clean government, an inviolate
charter, honest administration of the city go\r
eminent, the ousting. of spoilsmen, the eco
nomical expenditure of public money, the res
toration of that fine civic spirit that char
acterized the last Democratic administration
these shall be our shibboleths. And in this
fight for the city we claim, and shall obtain,
the adherence and support for our candidates
not only of all Democrats, but of all citizens
of whatever kind that wish to, see right done,
wrong routed and the city redeemed from the
spoiler. Once again, my fellow delegates, I
thank you.

their votes always won. Very
few delegates were absent when the con
vention was called to order. Both fac
tions were ready for an exciting session
and they were not disappointed. McNab
had more than 250 delegates and the
"Horse and Carts" were represented by
133 delegates.
Following is the official roll call of the
convention:
THERE were sufficient delegates
in control of Gavin McNab to do
his bidding, and, despite the oppo
sition of the "Horse and Carts,"
William A. Kelly, a young man who at
one time won renown in League of the
Cross essay contests, took the platform
and was recognized by McDonald. The
noise was too great and Kelly gave up
his intention of speaking before going half
way. Kelly attempted to make a motion,
but the opposition was too strong for
"I ask that the secretary of this county
committee call this convention to order,"
yelled a delegate. There were cries for
Thomas W. Hickey. Amid the yells Colo
nel Herbert Choynski of the Forty-third
District, who has but half a vote In the
convention, but possesses a full voice,
yelled: "Why can't some one else call this
convention to order? There are other
chairmen here. It does not matter wheth
er the chairman comes from Golden Gate
Park or South Park.'.'
CRIES- FOR HICKEY.
Cries of "Sit down," "Throw him out,"
"Good boy" and similar remarks filled
the air.
Amid more hoots McDonald announced
that none but delegates should be in their
seats. This was the cue for Cook, who
bawled out: "If none but delegates are
allowed in these seats, no one but a dele
gate should be in that seat." There were
shouts of approval from the "Horse and
Carts" and groans from the McNab con
tingent.
"You're out of order," replied McDon
ald.
"I appeal to this convention."
"The law says this convention can only
be organized by delegates," reiterated
Cook.
"Gentlemen," yelled one lusty lunged
delegate, "is this convention composed of
human beings or a crowd of savages?"
"Sit down," replied a fellow delegate,
and the ioud voiced man subsided.
Then there was an uproar. McDonald
was a candidate on McNab's ticket in
the Forty-second District, but the ticket
was defeated by D. I. Mahoney's ticket.
The "Horse and Carts" . were opposed to
McDonald because they believed him to
be a McNab man and they precipitated a
fight at the vsrv outset.
McDonald tried to be heard above the
noise, but his voice â¢ was lost amid the
hoots, yells and applause from both fac
tions. The spectators in' the gallery and
lobby helped swell the noise and the hall
was filled with sound.
"It is my duty to call this convention
to order," McDonald feebly called. â¢
Mr. McDonald paused for breath, and
before he could continue William Hoff
Cook of the Thirty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict strode toward the platform and made
himself heard above the din. "On behalf
of the delegates of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict." he yelled, "we object to anybody
â¢calling this convention to order who is
not a delegate to this convention."
"Gentlemen." yelled McDonald, "as
chairman of the Democratic County Com
mittee of the city and county of San
Francisco, It is my duty to call this as
sembly to order. Delegates will please
take their seats." . ,
M. Jasper McDonald, chairman of the
Democratic County Committee, attempted
to call the convention to order at 8:45
p. m., but the roar of opposition almost
took him off his feet. He had uttered
but a few sentences when the noise gen
erated by the "Horse and Carts" began.
These rulings enraged the minority dele
gates, who seemed to- plead in good faith
that contests should be determined, prin
ciples b.e enunciated and an order of
business be established before the con
vention went ahead with the work of se
lecting Supervisors. Mr. Cook's motion
was voted down. When efforts failed to
obtain from the majority any concession
in the direction of Increasing the number
of the committee on Supervisors, the
Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh, Thirty
eighth and Thirty-ninth District dele
gates walked out. Several delegates from
the Fortieth, Forty-first, Forty-second
and Forty-third districts joined the insur
gents. Gavin McNab, who was seated
near one of the revolting delegations, ob
served the departure, but did not alter
the programme. Several delegates who
did not walk out refused to vote.
The executive committee of the 134 mi
nority delegates will meet this forenoon to
determine what action shall be taken. It
Is understood that the convention will
assemble again Wednesday or Thursday
Evening of this week. Meanwhile an olive
branch may be extended to the seceders,
but the signs of harmony are dim and dis
tant. There was open talk on the floor of
the convention that the rawness of the
McNab programme would enable the Re
publicans to win in a walk this year.
UPBOAE BEGINS.
Minority delegates protested against the
rawness of the programme and the haste
of the programmers, scenes of tumult
and confusion followed fast. Chairman
Hickey. apprehending that many motions
were made to "diBturb the harmony" of
the convention, ruled the motions out of
order.
THE MINORITY PROTESTS.
of Gavin McNab's programme,
and there was scarcely a lull in the tu
mult until the adjournment at 11 o'clock.
M. Jasper McDonald, chairman of the
Democratic County Committee, was de
nied the time-honored privilege of calllifg
the convention to order on the pretext
that he was not. a delegate. Toe real op
position to his presence on the platform
sprang from the knowledge that he was
in sympathy with the McNab faction of
the party. He faced the storm for a con
siderable time, but perceiving that the.
minority delegates, whose capacity for
creating confusion was boundless, would
not listen to a word uttered by him, sur
rendered the gavel to another and retired
from the stage. The retirement of the
veteran in the ser%-ice of the party was
as graceful and dignified as it possibly
could have been under the peculiar cir
cumstances. Some of the protesting dele
gates noted the pathetic side of the sur
render, but did not relent.
Thomas "W. Hickey, who was slated for
chairman immediately after the victory
of the regular forces at the primary elec
tion on August 11, was fairly enough
chosen on the roll call. His opponent
gracefully moved to make Mr. Hickey's
choice unanimous. The convention acqui
esced. The chairman made a speech
full of fine phrases and for a minute or
two aftpr the close of his remarks there
were sisns of harmony.
The deft hand of the power behind the
chairman's little throne was revealed
when Osgood Putnam came forward with
a proposition to give a little clique of
seven delegates power to select and rec
ommend eighteen candidates for the
Board of Supervisors. William H. Cook,
pleading for fair play and home rule rec
ognition, moved that a committee of
eighteen be appointed, one from each As
sembly district, and that no district should
have two candidates on the Democratic
ticket for the board.
THE Democratic Municipal Con
vention at Native Sons' Hall last
night opened with a storm of re
monstrance against the execution
Armstrong was placed under arrest by
Sergeant Campbell and charged at the
City Prison with battery. He was re
leased on $20 bail. From the testimony of
eye witnesses he was not to blame for the
unfortunate occurrence.
Ferguson lived with his brother, WT3
liam Ferguson, a policeman, at 264 Fran
cisco street. The latter was notified by
Dr. Cross and spent the night at his
brother's bedside.
Sergeant Campbell of the North End
station was standing on the corner when
Ferguson ran in front of the car. Ha
shouted to him and rushed forward to
drag him from the track, but was too
late. The gripman, Robert L. Armstrong,
clanged his bell vigorously in time to
warn the unfortunate man of his danger,
but the latter seemed dazed and unable
to save himself. "
John Ferguson, a letter carrier about
SO years of age, wa3 struck by a west-"
bound California-street car at 9:30 o'clock^
last night and fatally injured. He was
picked up in an unconscious condition and
carried to the office of Dr. Charles V.I
Cress, where everything possible was
done for him, but It Is not thought ha
can survive many hours. He received a
severe concussion and a possible fracture*
of the skull.
Ferguson, together with another letter
carrier named Marks, had determined to
come downtown. They stood on the south
west corner of California and Fillmore
streets debating whether to take the Cali
fornia or Sacramento street car. Finally
Marks started alone in the direction of
Sacramento street and Ferguson ran Into
the street and turned with the evident in
tention of catching the eastbound car
on California street, which was approach
ing. Ha failed to notice the westbound
car, which came down the hill with con
siderable speed. He appeared to bo al
most In the center of the track when the
car struck him. He was knocked down
and dragged a foot or two, but the car
came to almost an immediate stop. When
he wa3 picked up he was bleeding pro
fusely from, wounds in the head, but
showed no other injuries.
The captain has a room at the Baldwin
Annex and retired at 8 o'clock Sunday
night. He turned oft the gas, as he
thought, quite securely, but when he
awoke early in the morring found him
self struggling for breath and unable to
move or call for aid. At T o'clock in tho
morning- E. J. Baldwin, v/ho the previous
day had arrived at the Annex, left his
room end, detecting a strong odor of gas,
gave the alarm and had Mrs. John Krel
lir.g, who has charge of the apartments,
called. They broke open the captain's
room and found him lying unconscious on
the bed while the room was filled with
gas, the only outlet for It being through
the cj>en transom.
Mrs. Krelling wasted no time, but threw
Â©pen the folding doors leading to another
room and opened all the windows. She
and those she called to her aid, together
with Baldwin, used artificial means to re
etore Captain Brooks, whose Â«ondition at
that time was desperate. Dr. Bunnell in
the meantime had been summoned and
also worked on the sufferer until he re
gained consciousness. An examination of
the chandelier and fixtures developed the
fact that the attachment was imperfect,
which accounts for the accident.
Captain James Brooks, who for many
years was connected with the Sausalito
ferryboat service and who some time ago
retired to accept a less onerous position
with the North Shore Railroad Company,
was miraculously saved from death by as
phyxiation yesterday morning.

Four f1tn Completely Cured of as
Itching Rash by Cuticura.
TOTAL COST S2.25.
â¢â¢ I take pleasure in letting you know
how much Cuticura Remedies have done
for me and my father, aud two broth-
ers. In the fall of *95 I began to be
afflicted with an itching rash under my
chin. It kept spreading until it was
all over my body. I could not sleep, but
was compelled to lie awake and scratch
all the time. My father and two broth-
ers were afflicted with the same thing
at the same time. We all suffered ter-
ribly for a year and a half, trying in the
mean time all the remedies we could
find, but received no benefit. I hap-
pened to see Cuticura Remedies adver-
tised and how they bad cured others
from itching skin diseases, and we
thought we would try them. I bought
three cakes of Cuticura Soap and three
boxes of Cuticura Ointment and they
cured the four of us completely. Any
person doubting the truth of this state-
ment can write me." ;
Richard Anderson,
Feb. 22, 1898. Genera, UtaiL
CURES PERMANENT.
Mr. Anderson writes, Feb. 25 ,1903,
That Disease Has Not
Returned.
â¢ â¢ â¢ I am glad to write and let you know
that your Cuticura Remedies cured us
and the disease has not returned, and
we all praise the Cuticura Remedies
aud would be glad to have you nse our
names. Would be willing to answer
any letters from any person wishing to
know about these Remedies."
Cuticura Ointment Is beyond question
the most successful curative for tortur-
ing, disfiguring humours of the skin
and scalp, including loss of hair, ever
compounded, in proof of which a slnzle
anointing preceded by a hot bath wita
Caticura Soap, and followed in tho
severer cases, by a dose of Cuticura
Resolvent, Is /often sufficient to afford
immediate relief in the most distressing
.forms of itching, burning and scaly
I humours, permit rest and sleep, and
point to a speedy cure when all other
remedies fail.
