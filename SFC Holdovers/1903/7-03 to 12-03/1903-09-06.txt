ONE HERO AND ANOTHER.
At Gibraltar Monty waa handed an om

tremblingly.

The Klviera season was fast closing and
the possibilities suggested by Monte Car
lo were too alluring to the host to admit
of a long stop at Gibraltar. But the Da-
Milles had letters to one of the officers
of the garrison, and Brewster could not
overlook the opportunity to give an elab
orate dinner. The success of tho affair
may best be Judged by the fact that tha
Esthetlcally the ball proved to be the
talk of more than one season. Pcttingill
had justified his desire for authority and
made a name which would last. He had
taken matters into his own hands while
Brewster was in Florida, and changed
the period from the Spain of Velasquez to
France and Louis Quinze. After the
cards were out he remembered, to his
consternation, that the favors purchased
for the Spanish ball would be entirely in
appropriate for thfc French one. He wired
Brewster at once of this misfortune and
was astonished at the nonchalance of his
reply. "But then Monty always was a
good sort," he thought, with a glow of
affection. The new plan was more costly
than ,the old, for it was no simple matter
to build a Versailles suite at Sherry's.
Pettingill was no imitator, but he created
an effect which was superbly in keeping
with the period he had chosen. Apainst It
the rich costumes, with their'accompani
ment of wigs and powdered hair, shone
out resplendent. With great difficulty the
artist had secured for Monty a costume

which might have once' adorned

with infinite relief that he took it off an
hour or so after dawn. He knew that
things had gone well, that even Mrs. Dan
was satisfied: but the whole affair made
him heartsick. Behind the compliments
lavished upon him he detected a note of
irony, which revealed the laughter that
went on behind his back. He had not
The invitations for the second ball had
been out for some time and the prepara
tions were nearly complete when Brews
ter arrived upon the soene of festivity. It
did not surprise him that several old-time
friends should hunt him up and protest
vigorously against the course he was pur
suing. Nor did It surprise him when he
found that- his presence was not essential
to the success of some other affair as it
had once been. He was not greeted .as
cordially as before, and he grimly 'won
dered -how many of his friends would
stand true to the end. The uncertainty
made him turn more and more often to
the unquestioned loyalty of Peggy Gray,
and her little library saw him more fre
quently than for months.
Much as he had dreaded the pretentious
and resplendent ball, it was useful to him

his ledger account was enlarged and in
that there was room for secret satisfac

Into New York, headed by Elon Gardner,

monious farewell appearance behind
Brewster's palms, which caused his guests
to wonder why the American pubiic could
not appreciate the real thing. A careful
summing up of the expenses and receipts
proved that the tour had been a bonanza
for Brewster. The net loss was a trifle
more than $56,000. When this story became
known about town everybody laughed
pityingly, and poor Gardner was almost
In tears when he tried to explain the dis
aster to the man who lost the money. But
Monty's sense of humor, singularly
enough, did not desert him on this trying
occasion.

Brewster waa comparatively well and
strong whÂ«n he returned to JÂ«few York In
March. His illness had interfered exten
sively with his plan of campaign and it
was imperative that he redouble his ef
forts, notwithstanding the manifest dis
may of his friends. His first act waa to
call upon Grant & Rlpley, from whom he
hoped to learn what Swearengen Jones
thought of his methods. The lawyers bad
heard no complaint from Montana, and
advised him to continue as he had begun,

NEW YORK, Jan. Â«, 19 â
THE NEW TENDERFOOT.
"i'et they charitably help him to spend
bis money. And I have noticed that even
"Generosity!" exclaimed Barbara, sharp
ly. "It's sheer idiocy. Haven't you
heard the things people are saying? They
ere calling him a fool, and in the clubs
they are betting that he will be a pauper
within a year."
"To my certain knowledge he has spent
more than four hundred thousand dollars
since last September. That is something,
is it not?" Miss Drew said, in her slow,
cool voice, and even Peggy's loyalty ad
mitted some Justification In the criticism.
"Generosity has ceased to be a virtue,
then?" she asked coldly.
Barbara drew herself up and kept her
eyes on the road which lay white and
Cleaming in the sun. "I have not the
least desire to be set straight." And she
was never more serious.
"But it was only a few weeks ago that
you were engaged."
"I am sorry," answered Barbara, "that
it should have been talked about so much.
Mr. Brewster dÂ»d ask me to marry him,
but I never accepted. In fact. It was only
his persistence that made me consider the
matter at all. I did think about ft. I
confess that I rather liked him. But it
was not long before I found him out."
. "What do you mean?" And there was
a flash in Peggy's eyes. "What has he
done?" . '.-.Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
"What Is the use. Miss Drew, of taking
an attitude like that? I know the situa
tion pretty well, and I can't believe that
cither Monty or you has lost in a week
a feeling that was bo deep-seated. I know-
Monty much too well to think that he
would change so easily." Peggy still, lived
largely in her ideals. "And you are too
fine a thing not to have suffered under
this misunderstanding. It setms as if a
very nna!l word would set you both
straight."
"Miss Gray, please do not mention Mr.
Brews-ter*s name to me again." Inter
rupted Barbara, with a contraction of the
eyebrows. But Veercy was seized with a
spirit of defiance and plunged reck
lessly on.
Barbara's only response was to touch
her pony a little too sharply with the
whip. Peppy went on as If unconscious
of the challenge.
"He has been bored to death, poor fel
low, in the house all this time, and "
"The dottor says Monty may go out
driving to-morrow," she began. "Isn't
that finer*
Peppy Gray was in despair over Mon
ty's attitude. 6hÂ« had become convinced
that behind hla pride he waa cherishing
a secret longing' for Barbara. Yet ahe
could not see how the walls were to be
broken down if he maintained this icy
reserve. Ehe was sure that the masterful
tone was the cne to win witu a girl like
that, but evidently Monty would not ac
rrpt advice. That he was mistaken about
Barbara's feeling she did not doubt for
a moment, and she saw things going
hopelessly wrong for want of a word.
There were times when she let herself
drram of possibilities, but they always
ended by seeming too Impossible. She
cared too much to make the attainment
of her vision seem simple. She cared
too much to be sure of anything.
At moments she fancied that she might
say a wcrd to Miss Drew which would
straighten things out. But there was
snmr thir.p about her which held her. off.
Even now that they were thrown together
more or less she could not get beyond
a certain barrier. It was not until a
runny day when she had accepted Bar
bara's invitation to drive' that things
seemed to po more easily. For the first
time she felt the charm of the. girl, and
for the first time Barbara seemed unre
servedly friendly. It was a quiet drive
-they were taking through the woods
and out- alonp the beach, and somehow
in the open air things simplified them
selves. Finally, in the softness and the
idle warrrth. even an allusion to Monty,
â¢whose nam<> usually meant an embarrass
lnp chanpe of subject, began to seenj pos
sible. It was inevitable that Peggy should
"bring It in; for with her a question of
tact was never allowed to dominate when
things of moment were at -stake. She
rowered before the plunge, but she took
It unafraid.
A few days later Mrs. Prentiss Drew
and Miss Drew registered at the Ponce
de Leon, ar.d there was much specula
tion upon the chances for a reconciliation.
Monty, however, maintained a strict sl
lerce on the subject, and refused to sat
isfy the curiosity cf his friends. Mrs.
Drew had brought down a small crowd,
including two pretty Kentucky girls and
a young Chicago millionaire. She lived
well and sensibly, and with none of the
extravapar.ee that characterized the cot
"tape. Yet it was inevitable that Brew
pur's puests should Bee hers and Join
some of their rising parties. Monty
pleaded that he was not well enough to
he in these excursions, but neither he nor
Barbara cared to over-emphasize their
estrangement.
QUARRELS and dissensions were
becoming every-day embarrass
ments, and the venture waa an ut
ter failure from a financial point
of view. Broken contracts and law
su'.ts were turning the tour into one con
tinuous round of looses, and poor Gard
ner waa on the point of de-
Fpair. From the beginning, appar
ently, the concerts had been
marked for disaster. Public indifference
had aroused the pcorn of the Irascible
members of the orchestra, and there was
imminent danger of a collapse in the or
ganization. Gardner lived in constant
fear that h!s troop of quarrelsome Hun
garians would finish their tour suddenly
in a pitched battle with daggers and
Ftein*. Brewster smiled at the thought
of the practical Gardner trying to smooth
down the electric emotions of these musl-
Yes, dear reader, the fourth, and

mystery of whether young Monty
got the extra six millions for spend
ing one million and lost the girl or
g-ot the girl and lost the six millions.
It's perfectly fascinating, no matter
which way your interest lies.
"Undoubtedly," replied Peggy, but many
thoughts were dashing through her brain.
"Shall we turn back to the cottage?"
she said, after an awkward silence.
"You certainly don't approre of Mr.
Brewater'a conduct?" Barbara did not
like to be placed in the wrong, and felt
that she must endeavor to Justify herself.
"He is the most reckless of spendthrifts,
we know, and he Indulges in even lesa re
spectable excitement."
Peggy waa not tall, but she carried her
head at thla moment aa though she were
in the habit of looking down on the world.
"Aren't you going a little too far, Miss
Drew?" she asked placidly.
"It Is not only New York that laugha
over his Quixotic transactions," Barbara
persisted. "Mr. Hampton, our guest from
Chicago, says the stories are worse out
there than they are in the East"
"It is a pity that Monty's illness should
have made him ao weak," said Peggy
quietly, as they turned In through the
great Iron gates, and Barbara was not
slow to see the point.
Barbara hesitated only a moment.
"Well, you must admit, Miss Gray, that
it ehows a shameful lack of character.
How could any girl be happy with a man
like that? And, after all, one must look
for one's own fate."

He longed for the time when he. could . .

bo that they could start at once. But Harrison's face was
not untroubled when he made hla report. All the prelim
inary details had been perfected. He bad taken the Flitter
for four months, and It was being overhauled and put Into

but at his death It went to his heirs, who were ready and

Harrison, as he walked to the window. "When

his face was white, but there was a look of
determination around the mouth.
"Monty, I've got to give up this Job," hÂ«
said huskily. Brewster looked up quickly.
"What do you mean, Nopper?"
"I've got to leave, that's all," said Harrl-
Bon, standing stiff and straight and looking
over Brewster's head. â¢
"Good Lord, Nopper, I can't have that. You
must not desert the ship. What's the matter,
old chap? You're as white as a ghost. What
Is It?" Monty was standing now and his hands
were on Harrison's shoulders, but before the
Intensity of his look his friend's eyes fell help
lessly. . .
"The truth is, Monty, I've taken some of
your money and I've lost It. That's the reason
Iâ I can't stay en. I've betrayed your confi
dence."
"Tell me about It," and Monty was perhape
more uncomfortable than his friend. VI don t
understand."
"You believe too much In me, Monty. You
see, I thought I was doing you a favor. You
were spending eo much and getting nothing In
return, and I thought I saw a chance to help
you out. It went wrong, that's all, and before I
could let go of the stock J60.000 of your money had
gone. I can't replace It yet. But God knows I
didn't mean to steal."
"It's all right. Nopper. I see that you thought

"I knew you'd act this way, but it doesn t help

Brewster protested that he had no use for the
money and begged him to retain his position of
trust he had held. But Harrison had too much- self
respect to care to be confronted daily with the man
he had wronged. Gradually Monty realized that
"Nopper" was pursuing the most manly course open
to him. and gave up the effort to dissuade him. He
insisted upon leaving New York, aa there was no
opportunity to redeem himself in the metropolis. â¢

and It was a merry crowd that she car

bered twenty-five, and they brought with
them a liberal supply of maids, valet*
and luggage. It was not until many
weeks later that he read the vivid de

which were printed In the New York
papers, but by that time be wa* Imper

On deck, watching en* ragged silhou

were Dan DeMille and Mrs. Dan, Peggy

Bister Isabel. Mr. and Mrs. Valentineâ
the official chaperonâ and their daughter
Mary. "Subway" Smith, Paul Pettlnglll,
and some others hardly less distinguished.
As Monty looked over the eager crowd
he recognized with a peculiar glow that
here were represented his best and truest
friendships. The loyalty of these com
panions had been tested, and he knew
that they would stand by him through
everything.
There was no little surprise when It
was learned that Dan DeMlile was really
to sail. Many of the Idle voyagers ven
tured the opinion that he would try to
desert the boat in mldocean if he saw a
chance to get back to his club on a west
bound Sieamer. But DeMille, big. Indo
lent and indifferent, smiled carelessly, and
hoped he wouldn't bother anybody If he
"stuck to the ship" until the end.
For a time the sea and the sky and the
talk of the crowd were enough for the
Joy of living. But after a few peaceful
days there was a lull, and It was then
that Monty gained the nickname of Alad
din, which clung to him. From some
where, from the hold or the rigging or
from under the sea, he brought forth
four darkies from the south who strum

were useful.

her eyes bright, her hair blowing la
the wind.
"And, Peggy, do you know what I

Peggy did not speak, but the blood
began to creep Into her face and she
looked wistfully across the water.
Then she smiled.

new stock the next day. The of
ficers and ladles of the garrt
son were asked, and Monty would have
entertained the entire regiment with beer
end sandwiches if his friends had not In
terfered.
"It might cement the Anglo-American
alliance," argued Gardner, "but your
pocketbook needs cementing a bit more."
Yet the pocketbook was very wide
open, and Gardner's only consolation lay
In a tail English girl whom he took out
to dinner. For the others there . were
many compensations, as the affair was
brilliant and the new element a pleasant
relief from the Inevitable monotony.
It was after the guests had gone ashore
that Monty discovered Mr. and Mrs. Dan
holding a tete-a-tete In the stern of the
boat
"I am sorry to break this up," ho in
terrupted, "but as the only conscientious
chaperon In the party, I must warn you
that your behavior Is already being talked
about The Idea of a sedate old married
couple sitting out here alone watching the
moon! It's shocking."
"I yield to the host," said Dan, mock
ingly. "But I shall be consumed wHh
jealousy until you restore her to me."
Monty noticed the look In Mrs. Dan's
eyes as she watched her husband go, and
marked a new note In her voice as she
said, "How this trip is bringing him out*
"He has Just discovered." Monty ob
served, "that the club Is not the only
place In the world."
"It's a funny thing." she answered,
"that Dan should have been so misunder
stood. Do you know that he relentlessly
conceals his best side? Down underneath
he is the kind of man who could do a fine
thing very simply."
"My dear Mrs. Dan, you surprise me.
It looks to me almost as though you had
fallen In love with Dan yourself."
"Monty." she said, sharply, "you are as
blind as the rest Have you never seen
that before? I have played many games,
but I have always come back to Dan.
Through them all I have known that he
was the only thing possible to meâ the
only thing In the least desirable. Its
a queer muddle that one should be tempt
ed to play with fire even when one is
monotonously happy. I've been singed
once or twice. But Dan Is a dear and he
has always helped me out of a tight
place. He knows. No one understands
better than Dan. And perhaps If I* were
less wickedly human he would not care
for me so much."
Monty listened at first in a sort of
daze, for he had unthinkingly accepted
the general opinion of the De-
Mille situation. ' But - there were
tears In her eyes for a moment and the
tone of her voice was convincing. It came
to him with unpleasant distinctness that
he had been all kinds of a fool. Look
ing back over his Intercourse with her,
he realized that the situation had been
clear enough all the time.
"How little we know our friends!" he
exclaimed, with come bitterness. And a
moment later, 'Tve liked you a great deal,
Mrs. Dan, for a long time, but to-nightâ
well, to-nirht I am Jealous of Dan."
The "Flitter" saw some rough weather
in making the trip across the Bay of
Lyons. She was heading for Nice when
an incident occurred that created the first
real excitement experienced on the voy
age. A group of passengers in the main
Baloon was discussing, more or less
stealthily, Monty's "misdemeanors."
when Reggy Vanderpool sauntered lazily
In his face displaying the only sign of
interest it haa shown in days.
"Funny predicament I was Just In," he
drawled. "I want to ask what a fellow
should have done under the circum
stances."
"I'd have refused the girl." observed
"Rip" Van Winkle, laconically.
"Girl had nothing to do with it old
chap." went on Reggy. dropping into a
chair. "Fellow fell overboard a little
while ego." he went on. calmly. There
was a chorus of cries and Brewster was
forgotten for a time. "One of the sailors,
you know. He was doing something In
the rigging near where I was standing.
Puff! Off he went into the sea, and there
he was puttering around In the water."
"Oh. the poor fellow." cried Miss Val
entine.
"I'd never set eyes on him before â per
fect etranger. I wouldn't have hesitated
a minute, but the deck was crowded with
a lot of his friends. One chap was his
bunkie. So. really now. it wasn't my
place to jump in after him. He could
ewlm a bit, and I yelled to him to hold
up and I'd tell the captain. Confounded
captain wasn't to be found though. Some
body said he was asleep. In the end I
told the mate. By this time. we were a
mile away from the place where he went
overboard, and I told the mate I didn't
think we could find him If we went back.
But he lowered some boats and they put
back fast Afterward I got to thinking
about the matter. Of course If I had
known himâ If he had been one of youâ
It would have been different"
"And vou were the best swimmer In
college, you miserable rat," exploded Dr.
Lotless.
There was a wild rush for the upper
deck, and Vanderpool was not the hero
of the hour. The "Flitter" had turned
and was steaming back over her course.
Two small boats were racing to the place
where Reggy's unknown had gone over.
"Where Is Brewster?" shouted Joe
Bir^aon.
"I can't find him, sir," answered the
first mate.
"He ought to know of this," cried Mr.
Valentine.
" lere! By the eternal, they are pick-
Ing somebody up over yonder," exclaimed
the mate. "See! that first boat has laid
to and they are dragging â yes, sir, he's
eaved."
A cheer went up on board and the men
in the small boats waved their caps in
response. Everybody rushed to the rail
as the "Flitter" drew up to the boats,
and there was Intense excitement on
board. A gasp of amazement went up
from every one.
Monty Brewster, drenched but smiling,
eat In one of the boats, and leaning limp
ly against him, his head on his chest, wai
the sailor who had ' fallen overboard.
Brewster had seen the man In the water
and. Instead of wondering what his an
tecedents were, leaped to his assistance.
When the boat reached him his uncon
scious burden was a dead weight and his
own strength was almost gone. Another
minute or two and both would have gone
to the bottom.
As they hauled Monty over the side he
shivered for an instant, grasped the first
little hand that sought his so frantically,
and then turned to look upon the half
dead sailor.
"Flnd'out that boy's name. Mr. Abertz.
and see that be has the best of care. Just
before he fainted out there he murmured
eomething about his mother. He wasn't
thinking of himself even then,' you see.
And Bragdan" â this in a lower voice â
"will you see that his wages are properly
Increased? Hello. Peggy! Look out. you'll
get wet to the skin if you do that"

LE ROI 8'AMUBE.
If Montgomery Brewster had had any
misgivings about bis ability to dispose of
the balance of his fortune they were dis-
T,Â«nÂ«rf vprv soon after his party landed in
the Rrrierla. On the pretext that the
yacht required a thorough "house dean
lug" Brewster transferred hi* guests toths
hotel of a fascinating village which waa
near the sea and yet oulte out of the
world. The place was nearly empty at
the time and the proprietor wept tears of
Joy when Monty engaged for bis party
the' entire flrst floor of the house with
balconies overlooking the blue Mediterran
ean and a separate dining-room and salon.
Extra servant* were summoned, and the
Brewster livery was soon a familiar sight
about the village. The protests of. Peggy
and the others were only silenced whtn
Monty threatened to rent a villa and go
to housekeeping.
The town quickly took on the appear-'
ance of entertaining a royal visitor and a.
number of shops were kept open longer
- than usual In the hope that their owners
might catch some of thÂ« American's
money. One morning Philippe, the hotel
proprietor, was trying to Imprest Brews-,
ter with a gesticulatory description of
the glories of the Batallle de Flours. It
seemed quite Impossible to express the
extent of his regret that the party had
not arrived In Urn* to see It
"This is quite another place at that
time," he said ecstatically. "C'est xnag
nlflque! c'est super be 1 If monsieur had
only seen it!" '
"Why not have another all to our
selves r* asked Monty. But the sugges
tion was not taken seriously.
Nevertheless the young American and
his host were In secret session for the
rest of the morning, and when the result
was announced at luncheon there was
general consternation. It appeared that
ten days later occurred the fete day of
some minor saint who had not for years
been accorded the honor of a celebration-
Monty proposed to -revive the custom by
arranging a second carnival. â¢
"You might Just as well not come to tho
Riviera at all," he explained, "if you
can't see a carnival. It's a simple mat
ter, really. I offer one prize for the best
decorated carriage ' and another xo the
handsomest lady. Then every cna puts,
on a domino and a mask, thrown confetti
at every one else, and there you are."
"I suppose you will have the confetti
made of thousand-franc notes, and offer
a house and lot as a prise."- And "Brag
don feared that his sarcasm was almost
Insulting. *. â¢ â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ . Â«
"Really. Monte, the scheme Is ridicu
lous," said DeMllle, "the police won't al
low It" ' . i
"Won't they, though I" said Monty, ex-.
ultantly. "The chief happens to be Phil
ippe's brother-in-law, and we had him on j
the telephone. He wouldn't Ustun to the
scheme until we agreed to make him.
grand marshal of the parade. Then he
promised tht co-operation of the entire
force and hoped to Interest his colleague,
the chief of the fire department."
"The parade will consist of two gen
darmes and the Brewster party in car
riages," laughed Mrs. Dan. '.'Do you ex
pect us to go before or after the bakery
carts?"
"We review the procession from the
hotel,", said Monty. "You needn't worry
about the fete. It's going to be great
Why, an Irishman lsn f t fonder of march-
Ing than these people are of having a
carnival."
The men in the party went Into execu
tive session as soon as Monty had gone
to Interview the local authorities, and
seriously considered taking measures to
subdue their host's eccentricities. But
the humor of the scheme appealed to them
too forcibly, - and almost before they
knew It they were making. plans- for the
carnival. j
"Of course we can't let him do it, but
it would be sport," said "Subway" Smith.
"Think of a cake-walk between ' gen
darmes and blanchiseuses."
"I always feel devilish the moment I
get a mask on," said Vanderoool, "and
you know, by Jove, I haven't felt that
way for "years."
"That settles It, then,"- said DeMille.
"Monty would call It off himself if he
knew how It would affect Reggie." -.' "
Monty returned with the announcement
that the' Mayor of the town would declare
a holiday If th* American jpuld see his
way to pay for the repairs on the malrie
roof. A circus, which was traveling In
the neighborhood, was guaranteed ex
penses If It would stop over and occupy
the square in front of the Hotel de Vllle.
Brewster's enthusiasm was such that no
one could resist helping him, and for
nearly a week his friends were occupied
In superintending the erection of tri
umphal arches and encouraging the shop
keepers to do their best. Although
the scheme had been conceived in
the spirit of a lark it was not so received
by the townspeople. They were quite se
rious In the matter. The railroad officials
sent advertisements broadcast, and the
local cure called to thank Brewster for
resurrecting, aa it were, the obscure
saint. The expression of his gratitude
was so mingled with flattery and appeal
that Monty could not overlook the hint
that a new altar piece had long been
needed.
The great day finally arrived, and no
carnival could have been more bizarre or
more successful. The morning was de
voted to athletics and the side sho-ws. The
pompiers won the tug of war, and the
people marveled when Monty duplicated
the feats of the strong man In the circus.
DeMille was called upon for a speech,
but knowing, only ten words of French,
he graciously retired in favor of ', the
Mayor, and that pompous little man made -
the most of a rare opportunity. Refer
ences to Franklin and Lafayette were so
frequent that "Subway" Smith Intimated
that a rubber stamp must have been used
In writing the address.
The parade took place in the afternoon
and proved quite the feature of the day.
The question of precedence nearly over
turned Monty's plans, but the Chief of
Police was finally made to see that if he
were to be chief marshal it was only fair
that the pompiers should march ahead of
the gendarmes. The crew of the Flitter
made a wonderful showing. It was led
by the yacht's band, which fairly outdid
Sousa, In noise, though it was less unani
mous In the matter of time. All the fia
cres came at the end, but there were so
many of them that at times they were
really" leading the procession despite the
gallant efforts of the grand marshal. .
From* the., balcony of the hotel Monty
and- his' party pelted those below with
flowers and confetti. More allusions to
Franklin and. Lafayette were made when
the cure and the Mayor halted the pro
cession and presented Monty with an ad
dress richly engrossed on imitation parch
ment Then the school children sang and
the crowd dispersed to meet again In the
evening.
3 At' 8 o'clock Brewster presided over a
large banquet, and numbered among his
guests every one of distinction 'In' the
town. The wives were also Invited and
.Franklin and- Lafayette were again al
luded to. Each of the men made at least
one speech, but "Subway" Smith's third
address was the hit of the evening. Know-
Ing nothing but English, he had previous
ly clung consistently to that language,
but the third and final address seemed. to
demand something more friendly and
.genial. With a sweeping 'bow and .with
all the dignity of a statesman he began:
-M^^-g et Messleursi -Tel, tu as, fl
a, bods avons,"â with a magnificent gest
ure, **youm avez." The French members
of the company were not equal to his pro
nunciation and were under the impres
sion that he was still talking English.
They were profoundly Impressed with his
deference and grace and accorded his pre
amble a round of applause. The Ameri
cans did their utmost to persuade him to
be seated, but their uproar was mistaken
by the others for enthusiasm, and the ap
plause grew louder than ever. "Subway"
held up his hand for silence, and his
manner suggested that he was about to
utter some peculiarly Important thought
He waited until a plnfall could have
been heard before he went on.
"Maltre corbeau sur un arbre percheâ "
he finished the speech as he was being
carried bodily, from the room by DeMllle
and Bragdon. The Frenchmen then Im
agined that Smith's remarks had been
Insulting, and his friends had silenced
him on that account. A riot seemed im
minent when Monty succeeded In restor
ing silence, and with a few. tactful re
marks about a Franklin : and Lafayette
quieted the excited guests.
The evening ended with fireworks and
a dance In ihe open airâ a dance that
grew gay under the masks. The wheels
had been well oiled and there was no
visible failure of the carnival spirit. To
Brewster It seemed a mad game, and he
found It leas easy to play a part behind
the foolish mask than he expected. His
own friends seemed to elude him, and the
coquetries of the village damsels had
merely a fleeting charm. He was stand-
Ing apart to watch the glimmering crowd
when he was startled by a smithered cry.
Turning to investigate, he discovered a
little red domino, . unmistakably fright
ened, and trying to release herself from
a too ardent Punchinello. Monty's ar
rival prevented him from tearing off the
girl's mask and gave him an entirely new
conception of the strenuous life. He arose
fuming and'sputtering, but he was taken
in hand by : the crowd and whirled from
one: to another in whimsical mockery.
Meanwhile Monty, unconscious that his
mask had dropped during the encounter,
was astonished to feel" the little hand of
the red domino on his arm and to hear a
voice not all unfamiliar to his ear.
"Monty, you are a dear.. I love you for
that." You looked like a Greek athlete.
Do you knowâ It was foolish, but I really
was frightened."
'.'Child, how; could it have happened?",
he whispered, leading her away. "Fancy
my little Peggy with no one to look after
her. What a: beast I was to - tru3t you
to Pettingill. I might have known the
chump would have been' knocked out by
all this color. "f He stopped to look down
at her and a .light came Into his eyes.
"Little Peggy in the great world," he
smiled; '"you are not fit. You needâ well,
you needâ Just me."
But 'Mrs. Valentine had seen him as he
stoood revealed,; and came up in search
of Peggy. It was almost morning, she
told her. and quite time to go back to
the hotel and ,6leep. So In Brag^Ion's
charge they; wandered off, a bit reluctant
ly, a bit lingerlngly.
It was'not until Monty was summoned
to rescue "Reggie* Vanderpool from the
stern arm of the law that he discovered
the identity of .Punchinello. Manifestly
he had not been in a condition to recog
nize his assailant, and a subsequent dis
agreement had -driven the first out of his
head. The poor boy was sadly bruised
about the. face and his arrest had prob
ably saved hinv from r worse punishment.
"I told you I couldnt wear a mask," he
explained - ruefully Â¦ as Monty led him
home. "But how could I know that he
could hear roe- all the time?" t ]
The day after the carnival ' Brewster.
drove his guests over. ; tof Monte/jbarlo.
He meant to stay only long enough to
try his luck at the tables and lose enough
to make up for the days at sea when his
purse was necessarily idle. Swearengen
Jones was forgotten, and soon after his
arrival he began to plunge. u VAt first he
lost heavily,- and It was with difficulty
that he concealed " his Joy. ~ Peggy Gray
was watching him, and" in*- whispers im
plored him to stop, but Mrs. Dan excited
ly urged him to continue, until the luck
changed. To the girl's chagrin it waa
the more reckless advice that he followed.
In so desperate a situation he felt that
he could not stop. But his luck turned
too soon. -â¢
"I can't afford to give up," he said,
miserably, to himself, after a time. "I'm
already a winner by five thousand dollars,
and I must at least get rid of that."
Brewster became the center of interest
to those who were not playing and
people marveled at his luck. They
quite misinterpreted his eagerness
and the flushed anxious loojr with
which he followed each spin of the wheel.
He had chosen a seat beside an English
Duchess whose practice it was to appro
priate the winnings of the more Inexpe
rienced players, and he was aware that
many of his gold pieces were being de
liberately stolen. Here he thought waa at
least a helping hand, and -he was on the
point of moving his stack toward J her
side when DeMllle Interfered. He had
watched the Duchess, and had called the
croupier's attention to her neat little
method. But that austere - individual si
lenced him by saying in surprise, "Mais
c"est madame la Duchesse^ que voulez
vous?"
Not to be downed so easily, DeMille
watched the play from behind Monty's
chair and cautioned his friend at the first
opportunity.. Â¦ â¢
"Better cash in and change your seat,
Monty. They're robbing you," he â¢whis
pered.
"Cash in when I'm away ahead of the
game? Never!" and Monty did his best
to assume a joyful tone.
;At first he played with no effort at sys
tem, piling his money flat on the numbers
which seemed to ha-ve least chance j of
winning, but he simply could not lose.
Then he tried to reverse different systems
he had heard of, but they turned out to
be winners. Finally In desperation he be-,
gan doubling on one color in the hope that
be would . surely lose In the end, but his
particular fate was against him. With*
.his entire stake on the red the ball con
tinued to fall in the red holes until the
croupier announced that the bank was
broken.
Dan DeMille gathered in the money and
counted forty thousand dollars before he
handed it to Monty. His friends were
overjoyed when he left' the table, and
Â¦wondered why. he looked so downhearted.
Inwardly he berated himself for not tak
ing Peggy's advice.
"I'm so glad for your sake that you did
not stop when I asked you, llunty, but
your luck does not change my belief that

"I /wish I had taken your advice," he

FAIRYLAND. r
Â¦ Monty's situation;' was desperate. Only,
a little . more than six thousand dollars ,
had been spent on the carnival and no
opportunity , of annlhilrtlng the roulette
winnings seemed to offer Itself. His ex
perience at Monte Carlo did not encour
age him to try again, and Peggy's atti
tude toward the place was distinctly an
tagonistic. The Riviera, presenting no
new opportunities for extravagance, It be
came necessary to seek other worlds.
"I never before understood the real
meaning of the phrase 'tight money,' "
thought Monty. "Lord, if it would only
loosen a bit and stay loosened." Some
thing must be done, he realized, to earn
his living. Perhaps the role of the prince
ly proligate would be easier In Italy than
anywhere else. He studied the outlook
from every point of view, but there were
moments when it seemed hopeless. Bae
deker was provoklngly barren of sugges
tions for extravagance and Monty grew
Impatient of the book's small economies.
Noticing , some chapters on the Italian
lakes, in an inspired moment he remem
bered thaf Pettingill had once lost his
heart to a villa on the lake of Como.
Instantly a new act of the comedy pre
sented Itself to him. He nought out Pet
tlngill and demanded a description of his
castle in the air.
"Oh, It's a wonder." exclaimed the
artist, and his " eyes grew dreamy. "It
shines out at you with its white terraces
and turrets like'those fascinating castles
that Maxfleld Parrlsh draws for children.
It is fairyland. You expect to wake and
find it gone."
"Oh, drop that. Petty," said Brewster,
"or it will make you poetical. What I
want to know : is who owns It and Is It
likely to be occupied at this season?" Â¦
"It .belongs to a certain Marquise, who
is a widow with no children. They say
she has a horror of the place for some
reason and has never been near It It Is
kept as though she were to turn up the
next day, but except for the servantB It
la always deserted."
"The very thing," declared Brewster;
"Petty, we'll have a house party."
"You'd better not count on that Monty.
A man I know ran across the place once
and tried for a year to buy It But the
lady has Ideas of her own." Â¦
"Well, if you wish to give him a hint or
two about how to do things, watch me.
If you don't spend two weeks In your
dream castle, I will cut the crowd and
sail for home." He secured the name of
the owner, and found that Pettingill had
even a remote idea of the address of her
agent Armed with these facts he set
out in search of a courier, and through
Philippe he secured; a Frenchman named
Bertier, woo was guaranteed to be sur
prisingly ingenious in providing methods
of ' spending money. "To him Brewster
confided his scheme, and Bertier re'allzed
-with rising enthusiasm that at last he
had secured a client after his own heart.
He was able to complete the address of
the agent of the mysterious Marquise,
and an inquiry was immediately tele
graphed to him.
The agent's reply. would have been dis
couraging to any one but Brewster. It
stated that the owner had no Intention
of leasing, her forsaken castle for any
period whatever. The profligate learned
that a fair price for an estate of that
kind for a month .was ten . thousand
francs, and he wired an offer of five
times that sum for two weeks. The
agent replied that some delay would be
necessary while he communicated with
his principal. Delay was the one word
that Brewster did not understand, so he
wired him an address in. Genoa, and the
Flitter -was made ready for sea. Steam
had been kept up and her Â«coal account
would compare favorably with that. of an
ocean liner.- Philippe was breathleas
with Joy when he was paid .in advance
for* another Â¦ month â¢ at the hotel, on the
assumption that the party might be
moved to return at any moment. The
little town was gay at parting and Brew-
Bter and his guests were given a royal
farewell.
At Genoa the mall had accumulated and
held the attention of the yacht to the ex
clusion of everything else. Brewster was
somewhat crestfallen to learn that the
lady of the villa haughtily refused his
princely offer. He won the life-long de
votion of his courier by promptly increas
ing. It . to one hundred . thousand francs.
When this too met with rejection there
was a pause and a serious consultation
between the two.
"Bertier," exclaimed Brewster, "I must
have the thing now. What's to bo done?
You've gotto help me out."
But the Courier, prodigal as he was of
gestures, had nb words which seemed per
tinent.
"There must be some way of getting at
this Marquise." Monty continued, reflec
tively. "What are her tastes? Do you
know anything about her?"
Suddenly the face of the courier grew
bright. "I have it," he said, and then he
faltered. "But the expense, monsieurâ it
would be heavy."
"Perhaps we can meet it," suggested
Monty, quietly. "What's the idea?"
It was explained, with plenty of action
to make It clear. The courier had heard
in Paris that madame la Marquise had a
passion for automobiles. But with her In
adequate fortune and the many demands
upon it it was a weakness not readily,
gratified. The machine she had used dur
ing the winter was by no means up-to
date. Possibly if monsieurâ yet it was too
much â no villa â
But Brewster's decision was made.
"Wire the fellow," he said, "that I will
add to my last offer a French machine of
the'latest model and the best make. Say,
too, that I would like immediate posses
sion."
He secured It, and the crowd was trans
ferred at once to fairyland. There were
protests, of course, but these Brewster
had grown to expect, and he was learning
to carry things with . a high hand. The
travelers had been preceded by Bertier,
-and greeting- they Â¦_ received from the
steward of the estate and hla Innumer
able assistants was very Italian and full
Â¦of color. A break in their monotony was
welcome. Â¦ .
The loveliness of the villa and .Its
" grounds, which sloped down to the gentle
lake, silenced criticism. For a time it was
supremely satisfying ; to do nothing. Pet
tlngill wandered about as though he could
not believe it was real.. He was lost in a
kind of atmosphere of ecstacy. To the
others', who took it more calmly. It was
sllll a' sort of paradise. Those who were
happy found In It an Intensification of
happiness, and to those who were sad It
offered' the tenderest opportunities for
melancholy. Mrs. Dan told Brewster that
only a poet could have had this Inspira
tion. And Peggy added, "Anything after
thla.would be an antl-cllmax. .Really,
Monty.'.you, would better take us home."
â¢â¢'I feel like the boy who was shut in a
closet, for punishment and found it tho
place "where they kept the jam," said
V'Subway."' "It Is almost as good' as own
ing. Central Park."
,; The st&b'es were well equipped and the
days wore on in a wonderful peace. It
iwas on/a radiant afternoon, when twelve
"of the crowd had started out after. tea for
a long â¢ ride toward " Lugano, that Monty
determined to call Peggy' Gray to ac
count. He was'certaln s that she had de
liberately avoided him for days and weeks
and he could find no reason' for It. Sour
after hour he had lain awake wondering
where he had failed her; but the conclu
sion of one moment was rejected the next.
The Monte Carlo episode seemed the most
plausible cause, yet even before that he
had noticed that whenever he approached
her she managed to be talking with some
one else. Two or three times he was sure
she had seen his Intention before she took
refuge with Mrs. Dan or Mary Valentine
or PettlngllL The thought of the last
name gave Monty a sudden thrllL What
if it were he who had come between
them?. It troubled him, but there were
moments when the Idea seemed Impossi
ble. As they mounted and started off the
exhilaration of the ride made him hope
ful. They were to have dinner In the open
air in the shadow of an abbey ruin some
miles away, and the servants had been
sent ahead, to prepare It It went well,
and with Mrs. Dan's help the dinner was
made gay. On the return Monty, who was
off last, spurred up his horse to join Peg
gy. She seemed eager to be with the rest
and he lost no time with a preamble.
"Do you know, Peggy," he began,
"something seems to be wrong, and I am
wondering what It is."
"Why, what do you mean, Monty?" as
he paused. â¢
"Every time I come near you, child, you
seem to have something else to do. If I
Join the group you are In It is the signal
for you to break away."
"Nonsense, Monty, why should I avoid
you? We have known one another much
too long for that"
But he thought he detected some contra
diction In her eyes, and he was right The
girl was afraid of him. afraid of the sen
sations he awoke, afraid desperately of
betrayal. \
"Pettlngill may appeal to you," he said,
and his voice was serious, "but you might
at least be courteous to me."
"How absurd you are, Monty Brew
ster." The girl grew hot. "You needn't
think that your million gives you the
privilege of dictating to all of your
guests."
"Peggy, how can you?" he Interjected.
She went on ruthlessly. "If my conduct
Interferes^ with your highness' pleasure I
can easily Join the Preatons In Paris."
Suddenly Brewster remembered that
Pettlngill had spoken of the Prestons and
expressed a fleeting wish that he might
bÂ« with them in the Latin quarter.
"With Pettingill to follow, I suppose."
he said icily. "It would certainly give
you more privacy."
"And Mrs. Dan more opportunities,"
she retorted as he dropped back toward
the others.
The artist Instantly took his place. The
next moment he had challenged her to
a race and they were flying down the road
in the moonlight. Brewater, not to be
outdone, was after them, but it was only
a moment before his horse shied violent
ly at something black in the road. Then
he saw Peggy's horse galloping riderless.
Instantly, with fear in his throat, he had
dismounted and waa at the girl's side.
She was liot hurt, they found, only
bruised and dazed and somewhat lamed.
A girth had broken and her saddle turned.
The crowd waited, silent and somewhat

XXII.
PRINCE AND PEASANTS.
The peacefulness of fairyland was
something which Brewster could not af
ford to continue, and with Bertier he was
soon planning to invade it. The automo
bile which he was obliged to order for
the mysterious Marquise put other ideas
into his head. It seemed at once abso
lutely necessary to give a coachingfparty
in Italy, and as coaches of the right kind
were hard to find there and changes of
horses most uncertain, nothing could be
more simple and natural than to Import
automobiles from Paris. Looking into
the matter, ho found that they would
have to be purchased outright, aa the
renting of five machines would put his
credit to too severe a test. Accordingly
Bertier telegraphed a wholesale order,
which taxed the resources of the manu
facturers and caused much complaint
from some customers whose work was
unaccountably delayed. The arrange
ment made by the courier was that they
were to be taken back at a greatly re
duced price at the end of six weeks. The -
machines were shipped at once, five to
Milan and one to the address of the mys
- terious Marquise in Florence.
It was with a sharp regret that Monty
broke into the idyl of the villa, for the
witchery, of the place had got into his
blood. But a stern sense of duty, com
bined with the fact that the Paris chauf
feurs and machines were due In Milan on
Monday, made him ruthless. He was as
tonished that his orders to decamp were
so meekly obeyed, forgetting that his so
llcitous guests did not know that worse
extravagance lay beyond. He took them
to Milan by train and lodged them with
some splendor at the Hotel Cavour. Hera
he found that the fame of the princely
profligate had preceded him, and his
portly host was all deference and atten
tion. All regret, too, for monsieur waa
Just too late to hear the wonderful com
pany of artists who had been singing at
La Scala. The season was but just end
ed. Here was an opportunity missed, in
deed, and Brewater'a vexation brought
out an Ironical comment to Bertier. It
rankled, but It had Its effect. The courier
proved equal to the emergency. Discov
ering that the manager of the company
and the principal artists were still In
Milan, he suggested to Brewster that a
special performance i would be very dif
ficult to secure, but might still be possi
ble. His chief caught at the idea and
authorized him to make every arrange
ment, reserving the entire house for his
own party.
"But the place will look bare," protest
ed the courier, aghast.
"Fill It with flowers, cover it with tap
estries," commanded Brewster. "I put
the affair In your hands and I trust you
to carry It through .in the right way.
Show them how it ought to be done."
Bertier'a heart swelled within him at
the thought of so glorious an opportunity.
His fame, he felt, was already established
In Italy. It became a matter of pride to
do -the thing handsomely, and the neces
sary business arrangements called out all
his unused resources of delicacy and dip
lomacy. When It came to the decoration
of the opera-house, he called upon Pet
tlngill for assistance, and together they
superintended an arrangement which cur
tained oft a large part of the place and
reduced it to livable proportions. With
the flowers and lights, the tapestries and
the great faded flags, It became some
thing quite- different from the usual
empty theater.
To the consternation of the Italians,
the work had been rushed, and it was on
the evening after their arrival in Milan
that Brewster conducted his friends in
state to the Scala. It was almost a tri
umphal progress, " for he, had generously
if unwittingly given the town the most
princely sensation In years, and curi
osity was' abundant Mrs. Valentine,
who 'was In the carriage with Monty,
'wondered Â©pÂ«nly why ttutx wsrÂ» attract* -
Ing so much attention.
"They take na for Amitrtrmn DnÂ£es and
Princesses," explained Montr. *T!iey
never eaw a white man before.**
"Perhaps they expected us to ride en
buffaloes," Bald Mrs. Dan. "with IiKTInn
captives In our train." >
"No." "Subway" Bmlta protested. "I
seem tp see disappointment Is their faces*
They are looking for crowns and scepters
and a shower of gold coin. Really. Mon
ty, 'you don't play the cam* as yon
should. 'Why, Z could give yon points on
the potentate act myself. A milk-white
steed, a few clattering attendants in
gorgeous uniforms, a lofty nod bar* and
there, and little me distributing silver la
"the rear."
"I wonder,** exclaimed Mrs. Dan, "12 .
they don't get tired now and then of be-
Ing potentates. Can't you fancy living
in palaces and longing for & thatched cot*
tare?"
"Easily," answered â¢"Subway" wttlx ft
laugh. "Haven't we tried It ourselves*
Two monius of living upon nothing but
fatted calves Is more than I can stand.
We shall be ready for a horns for dys-Â»
peptics , If you can't slow down a bit,
Monty."
Whereupon Mrs. Dan evolved a plan,
and promptly began to carry tt out by
inviting the crowd to dinner the next
night Monty protested that they would
be leaving Milan In the afternoon, and
that this was distinctly his affair and ha
was selfish.
But Mrs. Dan was very sure* "My dear
boy, you can't have things your own way
every minute. In another month you will
be quite spoiled. Anything to prevent
that. My duty Is plain. Even If I have
to use herolo measures, you dine with me
to-morrow."
Monty recognized defeat when he met
It, and graciously accepted her very kind
Invitation. The next moment they drew
up at the opera-house and were ushered
in with a deference only accorded to
wealth. The splendor of the effect waa
overpowering to Brewster as well as to
his bewildered guests. Aladdin. It
eeemed, had fairly outdone himself. The
wonder of It was so complete that It was
some time before they could settle down
to the opera, which was "Alda," given
with an enthusiasm that only Italians
can compass.
During the last intermission Brewster
and Peggy were walking In the foyer.
They had rarely spoken since the day of
the ride, but Monty noticed with happi
ness that she had on several occasions
avoided Pettlngill.
"I thought we had given up fairyland
when we left the lakes, but I believe you
carry it with you," she said.
"The trouble with this," Monty replied,
"Is that there are too many people about.
My fairyland Is to be Just a little differ
ent."
"Your fairyland. Monty, will be built of
gold and paved with silver. You will sit
all day cutting coupons In an office of ala
baster."
"Peggy, do you too think me vulgar?
It's a beastly parade. I know, but It
can't stop now. You .don't realize the
momentum of the thlng.*^
"You do It up to the handle," she put
In. "And you are much too generous to
be vulgar. But It worries me, Monty, it
worries me desperately. It's the future
I'm thinking of â your future, which is
being swallowed up. This kind of thing
can'fgo on. And what is to follow It?
You are wasting your substance, and you
are not making any life for yourself that
opens out."
"Peggy," be answered very seriously.
"you have got to trust me. X can't back
out. but I'll tell you this: Tou shall not
be disappointed in me In the end."
There was a mist before the girl's eyva
aa she looked at him. "I believe you,
Monty," she said simply; "I shall not for
get."
The curtain rose upon the next act, and
something In the opera toward the end
seemed to bring the two very close to
g-ether. As they were leaving the theater
there waa a note of regret from Peggy.
"It has been perfect," she breathed, "yet
Monty, Isn't It a waste that no one els*
should have seen It? Think of these
poverty-stricken peasants who adore mu
sic and have never heard an opera."
"Well, they shall hear one now." Monty'
rose to It. but he felt like a hypocrite In
concealing his chief motive. "We'll re
peat the performance to-morrow night
and fill the house with them."
He was as good aa his word. Bertler
was given a task the next day which was
not to his taste. But with the assistance
of the city authorities ho carried It
through. To them It was an evidence of
insanity, but there was something prince- i
ly about it and they were tolerant. I
The manager of the opera-house
was less complacent, and he had an ex- '
clamatory terror of the damage to his up- !
holstery. But Brewster had discovered
that In Italy gold Is a panacea for all
ills, and his prescriptions were liberal. To i
him the day was short, for Peggy's Inter- :
est '- the rgpunce, as it came to bÂ« called, '
was so keen that sho insisted on having'
a hand In the preliminaries. There was
something about the partnership that ap
pealed to Monty.
To her regret the DeMllle dinner Inter
fered with the opening of the perform
ance, but Monty consoled her with thÂ»
promise that the opera and Its democratlo
audience should" follow. During the day
Mrs. Dan had been deep In preparations
for her banquet, but her plans were elab
orately concealed. They culminated at
eight o'clock In the Cova not far from
the Scala, and the dinner was eaten in
the garden to the- sound of music. Tet
it was an effect of simplicity with which
Mrs. Dan surprised her guests. They
were prepared for anything but that, and
when they were served with consomme.
spaghettiâ a concession to the chefâ and
chops and peas, followed by a salad and
coffee, the gratitude of the crowd waa
quite beyond expression. In a burst of
enthusiasm "Subway" Smith suggested a>
testimonial.
Monty complained bitterly that he- him*
self had never received a ghost of a tes
timonial. He protested that It was not
deserved.
Why should you expect it?" exclaimed
Pettlnglll. "when have you risen from ter
rapin and artichokes to chops and chic
ory? When have you given us nectar and
ambrosia like this?"
Monty was defeated by a unanimous vota
and Mrs. Dan's testimonial was assured.
This matter settled. Peggy and Mrs. Val
entine, with Brewster and Pettlnglll,
walked over to the Scala and heard again
the last two acts of "Alda," But the
audience was different, and the applause.
The next-day at noon the chauffeurs from
Paris reported for duty, and five gleam-
Ing French devil-wagons steamed off
through the crowd in the direction of
Venice. Through Brescia and Verona and
Vlcenza they passed, scattering largess
of silver in their wake and leaving a trail
of breathless wonder.
It was there that he suddenly recalled
to his duty from dreams of moonlight on
the water, by a cablegram which de
manded $324 before It could be read.

of the ten talents and ended with the slm

It was a pretty face the mirror held,
a sweet, womanly face, with a happy,
girlish smile. vShe turned away with a
little sigh, and went lightly down the
steps into the street. It was a holiday,
and school-tÂ« aching was serioua work
with conscientious Elsie Wentworth. She
was glad of the rest, the day outdoors,
the sunshine and pure air.
"Where are you going, Elsie?"

In her own room she put the hat on
and studied herself intently in the mir
ror. Brown would have been more be
coming, she decided. She was too pale
for gray now.
It had been six years since she had
made that promise. It was just as she
bid him good-by. "You look like a pink
rose in that gray hat, darling," he had
said. "I shall expect to see your dear
face under just such a hat when I come
home." So for six years, summer and
winter she had worn a gray hat; six
years in which she had heard from him
but twice, and that shortly after he left.
But she believed ln him, Joved, excused
him. Aweary, sometimes; but never des
pairing, she remained steadfast. He had
gone to Africa; that was so far away,
and offered so many opportunities for her
tender heart to find excuses. She feared
always for his safety, but never his con
stancy.
She answered hla kiss first, smiling and
dimpled, thenâa frightened look flashed
over the happy face. Whatâ oh. what if
Dave had been true, had come back! She
hugged the doctor again frantically.
"It was the gray hat." she cried. "It
was a hoodoo. I tore It up last night. I
was never so happy aa while pulUoff It

The next one came In slowlyâ a slender.
graceful creature, with fair, flushed faeÂ©

color of her eyes.

Elsie rushed blindly out of the house,
pazed, she made her way home, the pret
ty head sadly drooping under her faith
ful gray hat. She laid It off and sat
down beside it and gave way to tears â
tears that pride had held back till she
was away from prying eyes.
"Or a green one," said Elsie. Irritably.
Brown, white, blue, had been recommend
ed; why not green, red, purple, she
thought desperately.
"Walt," said her friend, as she was
leaving. "I got a picture yesterday of
Frank and Annie and a friend of theirs
and her husband."
She handed Elsie the picture. There,
sure enough, were Frank and Annie
Young, andâ Elsie clutched wildly at the
little cardboardâ Dave Brady, with a
woman sitting ardhly on his knee, hla
eyes gazing at her adoringly.
"They, had them take.n that way just

"I shouldâ then." The strangeness of
her voice held him. "Good-by," she said
lightly, and hurried away.
Her eyes grew troubled, piteous. She
did so want to see Dave. It came over
her with a rush just how unhappy she
was, how lonesome. Her heart ached al
most to bursting. The woods no longer
attracted her. She turned toward Mrs.
Young's listlessly.
"You're all worn out." said that lady
with concern. "That gray hat takes the
color out of your face, too. Gray's not
becoming, Elsie; get a blue one next
time."
"Jack," she said firmly, "I don't love
you; will never marry you. This talk of
yours makes me unhappy. Will you
please not repeat it."
"Not till I see you again." he said good
humoredly. "Another gray hat, by Jove!"

who seemed the center of it. stopped sud
denly, pushing her heavy hair back from
her forehead.
"Who said this wasn't summer, and
where is the, lighthouse?" she demanded.
1 " 'Tis but a step, my ,lady fair."
The man who spoke was usually to be
found at Elise Crompton's side. He turn
ed as he answered her and flung a light
coat back to â¢ Hoyt.
"Here, Rad, you seem to be the gen
eral burden bearer," he drawled easily.
"Mr. Jerold! What a shame!" ' Ellse
laughed. But she glanced rather con
temptuously at Hoyt.
The coat struck the young fellow's
shoulder and slipped to the ground. The
smile did not leave his face as he passed
on. In the grateful shade of the light
house he dropDed hla load amid a mur
mur of thanks from the girls.
"Where's my coat?" Jerold examined
the pile of wraps on the ground.
"Where you threw It probably." Hoyt
picked up a stone and shied It with easy
strength into the water.
"I threw It to you!". Herold's face
flushed with chagrin.
"Did you? Well, I only fag for wom

Ellse Crompton turned, and for the first
time in their acquaintance looked direct

"Why, he's a man," she thought won
derlngly.
His eyes met and held hers steadily
for a moment. She looked quickly away,
annoyed to find herself blushing under
hla jtaze. "â¢
After that she felt like a ship swept
from Its destined course by a strong
wind. Hitherto she had acquiesced ln her
mother's wish that this outing might end
In her engagement to Jerold, though well
aware that wealth was his one recom
mendation. But that look of Hoyt's had
been as a steady breeze on a foggy day.
That afternoon she strolled down to the
rocks alone. Hardly had she seated her
self when a man's voice reached her,
coming In admonitory jerks from around
the next promontory .i
Ellse leaned forward and saw Hoyt sit
ting quite near her. Between his knees
he held the shaggiest and most forlorn of
mongrels. His hand was firmly closed
upon one of the dog's forepaws.
"Here, Jerold!" the girl drew back
quicklyâ "help me. will you? The poor
beast has cut his paw almost in two on a
broken bottle."
The girl quivered at the harshness of
the voice that answered. I.
"Oh, let the cur alone. Where" has
every one disappeared to?"
Hoyt'8 reply sounded as though hla
teeth were closed on something, and Ellse
could hear the noise of tearing cambric.
When Jerold passed out of sight she
rose. Hoyt, had finished his bandaging
and, followed by the mongrel on three
legs, was ascending to the cliff path
above.
"Look here, Tatters, old fellow," he ad
monished, "you'd better go homeâ If
you've Rot one to go to, which I very
much doubt. I could never take you to
the hotel, you know."'
He. swerved at a sharp cry from Elsie.
One foot had become wedged between the
rocks. Â¦ Her body swayed uncertainly,
while her face grew white with the agony
of a sprained ankle.
With a bound Hoyt was at her side.
"You'd better Fit down while I go for
a carriage," he said quickly. ;
Suddenly a ray of humor shot Into her
eyes. Tatters stood before her, his ban
daged paw pathetically uplifted in a ludi
crous demand for sympathy.
"Oh, poor fellow! I know how badly It
hurts; there are two of us!" she exclaim
ed, ruefully. Then she turned her face up
to Hoyt. "How good you are; how
good!"
Hoyt felt himself turning dizzy under
â¢her look.
"Leave the dog with me," she said sud
denly. "Iâ I would like to keep him al
ways, if I may."
, "You!"
Hoyt stared In amazement from the girl
In her young beauty to the battered ani
mal at her feet. And yet, incongruous as
it seemed, he could not deny to himself
as he strode away that there had been
somethingâ something for himâ in the
eyes of both, which it meant madness to
think of ln connection with Elise Cromp
ton.
That evening she sat on the piazza in
a low steamer chair with Hoyt beside
her.
Tatters, who had protestingly been in
itiated Into the ways of higher living
through soap and water, lay curled up on
the end of her soft gown. \
"Is ; Jerold to be Â¦ congratulatedâ yet?"
Hoyt turned to her suddenly.
. She was looking off near the moon-lit
water and did not withdraw her gaze.
"Mr. Jerold will never be congratulated
as far as I am concerned," she answered
quietly.^
Hoyt's hand closed over the one which
rested on the arm of her chair. Ellse
looked up and saw his face, white and
streaked in the moonlight. She withdrew
her. fingers and lightly touched his coat

"Whyâ don't youâ say it?" Her eyes
were smiling naively Into his.

Providence brought things around in a
Queer way two months later. That Is,
It brought Colonel Blngs. as he had been
earned on the programme, to the farm
cf Abel Eaunders as a boarder. Farmer
Baunfiers didn't hacker for boarders, and
his wife agreed that It wouldn't be worth

"He went away owing me for the last

There was no posing on his part as he
walked under the apple trees. When he
was bitten by a mosquito Hattie expected
to hear him call out "Zounds!"- or
""â¢death!" but he didn't. He called out,
"Thunder!" Instead. When the hour grew
late and bedtime came he didn't bend over
her little brown hand and kick out one
foot, as In the play, but bade her a
brusque good-night, and said it looked as
if there might be rain before morning.
The next morning brought hope to her
heart. ,ge was heard shouting, "Egad!"
and "Tnws varlet!" to himself in his room
before breakfast, and his manners were
courtly as he eat down to tackle the fried
pork and hard-boiled eggs. After the
breakfast things had been cleared away
the girl invited him to walk across the
field to the gooseberry bushes with her,
and It did her soul good to see him assume
his trerolc stride as he walked beside her.
In her mind's eye she was picturing the
scene where he slew three villains and
cried, "Ha! ha!" In triumph, when he
suddenly sprang from her side and drew
himself up Into an apple tree. A~ yearling
calf was coming across the field on a run,
and the hero didn't mean to take any
chances. It took five minutes to assure
him that he was In no danger and to coax
him down, but the gooseberries were not
yet at hand when a mother goose showed
a disposition to attack him and he climbed
a fence and left poor Hattie to save her
own life or perish by Inches. The matter
did not end there. He had almost recov
ered his equanimity and was seeking after
a pose when a bumblebee bobbed up and
did business. Colonel Blngs was lifted a
foot high, but Instead of coming down to
conquer or die he descended to utter half
a dozen cuss words and reprove Hattie
for the grin on her face.
Most girls would have made up their
minds then and there that Colonel Bings
was no hero, but Hattie Saunders did
not want to do him injustice. She gave
him more rope. That evening, as she
swung In her hammock, she remarked
that she had always thought she would
make a great actress, and asked him for
an honest opinion.
s "It's all bosh," he replied, as he dodged
a wandering horsefly seeking a night's
lodgings. "You haven't got the face nor
the form, and you'd make a dead failure
of it In a week. Better stick right here
till you can marry some luÂ«ty fellow."
Miss Hattie closed her eyes for a mo
ment to blush, and when she opened
them again her Idol lay shattered on the
grass. She had admired and worshiped
and was ready to love, but the veneer
had pealed off, and her mahogany hero
was only plain pine. He remained ten or
twelve days more, and there were days
when he stretched out his arm and cried,
"Back, you sons of Satan, or die!" but
the girl could not recall her reverence
and enthusiasm. When his fortnight was
up he left, and Hattie queried of her
father:
"Papa, do you think Colonel Blngs is a
hero?"
could just as well have walked. She was
now to learn that the heroine was a wom
en of forty, who had been married and
divorced three or four times.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
4
waves gave her no reply, and. pulling a
letter opt of the front of her blouse she
read it for the third or fourth time that
day. It seemed to restore her self-conn
dence. She laughed to herself wickedly.
Hum! Mrs. Graham Is a dear, but I
fancy I've fooled that conceited Jack of
hem. No, thank you! No four-mile drive
with him. I'm down here to be sure, but
srv^r^K'S
dear! I wish I had a boat!"
An If in answer to her desire, a red
canoe shot out from beyond the bend and
came noiselessly down the river. A man
sat in the stern wielding the paddle with
a swift grace. Gladys arose among the
long grass and the daisies. Her mind
was made up.
"I beg pardon," she called as he came
abreast of her. "Can you tell me if there
Is a way of getting to Mr. Graham's es
tate except by this bridge? It seems to
be closed."
The man in the canoe rested his paddle
across his knees and gazed at her admir
lngly. , v
"Why, I," he began, then stopped.
"There is an approach by the road," he
said, "but it Is quite two miles to the
other aide/
"Oh," ahe said, "I know! But I've
walked so far already." She glanced rue
fully down at her dusty patent leather
ties. Â¦
"Would you allow me?" he asked eager
ly. "I could take you across in my ca
noe."
She blushed charmingly. "I hate to
trouble you."
"I assure you It would give me' the
greatest pleasure," he said, with another
admiring glance.
Â¦With a dexterous stroke or two he
brought the graceful little craft up to the
bank and landed. He was tall and brown
and broad-shouldered, and as he stood
looking down at her he saw a little slen
der girl with the longest eyelashes that
ever drooped over.a pair of gray eyes, in
U^u b il.Wr^
one hand. On her forehead and around
her ears danced little truant wisps of
curly hair.
He helped her Into the canoe and piled
the gay cushions at her back, then
stepped In after her.
"Where are you going?" she asked, as
he pointed the canoe up stream. "I un
derstood you to say you would take me
across," she added, with some statellness.
"That's such a nasty place to land," he
replied apologetically. "It's much better
a little farther up."
His dark eyes eought hers and they
both laughed. It was obvious to the most
casual observer that the sloping shore on
the other side was most admirably
adapted for beaching the canoe.
"You seem well acquainted with the
river," she said demurely. "Do you know
the Grahams?"
He did not answer immediately.
"Yes, charming woman, Mrs. Graham # "
he admitted at last.
"Oh, yes, lovely. It's a pity her son
doesn't take after her," Gladys replied
with high scorn.
Her companion grinned. "It's evident
you know him," he said.
"Well, I haven't seen him In years, but
when I saw him last he was absolutely
the most disagreeable, most conceited and
altogether most hateful boy I ever came
across." Gladys sat up straight among
her cushions with a sudden energy.
"Poor Jack!" murmured her compan
ion. "Still, If you haven't seen him for
years, it isn't impossible that he has im
proved."
"Improved! Well, I'm sure I hope so.
There certainly was room for improve
ment. But I don't believe he has. The
idea of shutting people out by locking up
that bridge the way he has. It's just like â¢
him. So afraid any one would get into
his domains. Just as though any one
with sense would want to."
' "Exactly. But possibly he wants tÂ«
keep out that class of .people supposed to
be braver than angels, you know."
"Fools?" she questioned, j Then they
both laughed again. Â¦
"You're not very polite," she said.
"How can you expect me to be sympa
thetic when the bridge being locked has
given me this pleasure?"
"Oh!" she exclaimed, with Incredulous
eyes. "Anyway, I forgive you. But if
I'd had my way I shouldn't have been
here at all."
"Now, It's you who is Impolite," he
said.
"Yes; and ungrateful," she admitted
frankly. "It's simply lovely out here* It's
the only pleasant thing about the whole
trip. Goodness! If you oniy knew how
I hated to come. I wept day and night
for weeks. But mother was adamant."
He looked at her appreciatively, won
dering how any human being could be^
proof against eyes like those filled with*
tears. *
"Mothers are Inconsistent at times," he
said. "Mine, for instance, has been sys
tematically Indulging and spoiling me all
my life, and now has taken it Into her
head that I must marry a girl she has
picked "out for me whether I want to or
not."
"Why, that's just the question on which
mother and I differed," Gladys gasped.
"She and his mother arranged it all years
ago, it seems, and he's unmanly enough
to keep, her to her. word, though he must
know I hate him. You wouldn't find a
girl doing a thing like that!"
"Wouldn't you, though? This particular
young lady of whom I speak of so
clinging a disposition that, according to
my mother, she will never know happi-'
ness unless I brace up and woo. Why In
thunder she should be In love with a man
she hasn't seen since she was a child Is
more than I can conceive!" He paddled
angrily for a moment. Then once again
his eyes met hers and they laughed.
"We seem to be figuratively as well as
literally in the same boat," she remarked.
"The thought makes me quite fond of
you."
"Ah, if I could but believe you in ear
nest!" he, sighed with exaggerated gal
lantry.
She darted him another look from under
her lashes.
"Weren't you smoking when I called to
you?" she asked presently. "Why, there's
your pipe. Do let me fill it for you. I
love to fuss with pipes."
"It's all I need to complete my happi- '
ness," he assured her, as he handed her
his pipe. "My pouch is in the left-hand J
pocket of my coat. Can you get it? It's
right behind you there." ,
She leaned back and secured the thin
serge coat, rummaged In his pocket, and
brought forth a chamois pouch elaborate
ly embroidered with the initials "J. G."
in crimson. She looked at the inscription
for a moment, then at its owner.
He watched her as she pressed the to
bocco into the bowl with a delicate thumb.
"There," she said as she handed It to
him. "Lean over and I'll light it for you."
She shaded the sputterlnr
match -with her hand and ap
plied the flame to the tobacco.
Her face was very near his,
and it was a face to set a man
longing.
She settled herself once more
among the cushions. "Isn't
this comfy?" she sighed with
satisfaction. "When I remem
ber that walk from Dlgby In
all thÂ» dust I can't realize It's
me!" y.-- "- -- :
"Great Scott! Did you walk
from Dlgby?" ;-:; s; *
"Yes. You see they wrote
that a certain person would
meet me at Grahamsford, so I
got out at Dlgby and walked.
Anything was better than a
four-mile ride withâ the person
who was coming to meet me.
That's why I am here."
"What a coincidence!" he ex
claimed as he knocked the
ashes from his pipe. "At
this moment I am supposed to
be driving home from Gra
hamsford with a ycrung lady
whom I didn't want to meet.
That's why I'm here!"
Shevwas busy watching the ripples that
followed the canoe.
"It appears to me our mothers have
been fibbing," she said musingly.
"Bles3 their hearts:' he exclaimed fer
vently. "I forgive them, don't you? Be
sides, I am Just discovering that your
mother, at least, spoke the truth. And
I mean to be obedient In all things from
this time forth forevermore," he added
boldlv.
"Amen," she said with mock solemnity.
"But how self-sacrificing!" Then with a
look that set his heart beating, "Well, I
will not be outdone In filial devotion."
Her lashes flickered against her redden
ing cheek. With one stroke he beached
the canoe among the shadows of the
trees.
An hour later
Mrs.Graham came
to meet them
down the long
avenue bordered
with oaks.
"My dear chll

joyfully. "I see

TWO PAGES OF GREAT LOVE STORIETTES WRITTEN EXPRESSLY FOR THE SUNDAY CALL.CUPID THE PLUNGER
By John Barton Oxford.
"Look here," Bainbrldge said savagely,
when they were out of sight "If you let
it out I'll kill you!"
Lee gravely shook his hand, then burst
out: "But, Lordy! Lordy! the Innocence
of it! Cattle raising on a quarter section
âand all the rest of itâ them's the kind
that fatten the rascals. But she's good!
I've got a good woman; I know one when
I see her."
"Yes," she's good," Balnbridge assented
absently. "Makes you feel like" Sunday
morning, and all the bells ringing."
"Ho! ho! I must tell Ellen that She
says you're a born poet, and only need
a good woman to bring it out."
"Reckon I've found her," Bainbrldge
grinned, sheepishly, turning away.
The moon was diffusing a mellow day
light when he returned from a long walk
in communion with himself. He found
her still on the porch, and sat down in
awkward silence: then he began abrupt
ly: "Don't be frightened. Miss Burton,
at what I'm going to say. My head's
level; anybody 'round here'll tell you
that. I always know what I want, and
we do things quick out here. Once when
I was young I was going to be married,
but she died," he paused an Instant
"Since then I never found any one I
wanted till right now, andâ andâ I'm
waiting to be married any minute you
say so~ If It's too quick I'll keep on wait-
Ing, but I'm not going to let anybody else
have you."
"Mercy 1" she gasped, in helpless sur
prise, but with appreciation of his sturdy
manhood gleaming in her eyes.
"I mean anybody out here," he
amended. "Of course, if there's one back
there I'm out"
She shook her head, her face one vivid
flame.
"Well, then, I think you can trust me,"
he leaned toward her coaxlngly, his
strong band swallowing hers. "Tom and
Annie and the klds'U be our next-door
neighbors, and if you get tired of me
you can go back to them," his eyes
twinkled.
She was still silent and he went on:
"We've been together several days, and
have a pretty good notion of each other
âand I'll feel like the bottom had dropped
out of everything if it isn't a go."
"Iâ I guess It's a 'go,' " she stammered.
"Glory!" he exclaimed, taking posses
sion of her.
bors, who had a right to know the pros
pects and intentions of the newcomers.
"We think lt will be easier for Tom, and
we've heard it was more profitable than
ordinary farming."
"Tom Is, maybe, your husband?" Lee
insinuated.
"Land, no!" she laughed, her plump
face rosy. "He's my brotherâ all the folks
I've got. I raised him, and, like me, he's
been a factory worker all his life. He's
married and has two little tots, so smart."
"Thomas H. and A. Burton; that was
the names you bought under?" Balnbridge
queried, with a warning glance at Lee.
"Why yes; how did you know? Oh, I
expect you saw lt in the agent's list of
sales." . *
"Yes. ma'am, and I noticed particularly
because that Quarter is right next me; In
fact juts Into mine. Of course, I felt an
interest in such near neighbors."
"Why, I'm real glad!" she said, heart
ily; "real glad. I don't feel at all as if
I was going among strangers, meeting
my neighbors this way."
"Are you going \o live there alone?"
Lee inquired boldly.
Her face clouded. "1 must for a while.
I am going to hire a dugout, or some kind
of shelter, put up, and I want to start
things as soon as I can. Tom's sickly,
and he's dreadfully run down; he couldn't
be alone out here"; a glow of confidence
lighted her eyes, and ehe continued:
"We've been saving a long time to get a
home out in the country somewhere. Tom
was never strong \and the last year or
two has developed consumptive tenden
cies, and the doctors advised him to come
out in this part of the West and live.
They say he'll get well and be stronger
than ever. We got this land real cheap
through the agent and It's all paid for,
and enough over to bring me out and get
some sort of a shelter, and a start in cat
tle. I thought I could buy some calves
cheap, and I'll hire some breaking done
and raise some grain and get chickens.
They'll come out as soon as we get
enough to bring them. I hope lt won't be
long, I'm so anxious about Tom"â there
was a thrill of apprehension in her voice.
"He coughs bad at times, and some days
can hardly get to his work. Annie, his
wife, goes in his place part the time and
makes him rest oft and stay with the
children. I must get them here as soon
as possible."
"Yes, he needs to pome," Lee said, re-
plain vw a revelation of the vastness of
God's domain, and she brooded over lt In
â¢eilest, dreamy contemplation. She emlled
and answered pleasantly when spoken to,
but had volunteered no Information con
cerning herself, and Lee and Bainbrldge
felt bo me curiosity as to her destination.
: They knew nobody In the sparsely set
tled region beyond who were expecting
company, and such an event would be
Z>ewÂ» for fifty miles around.
Ehe had accepted the detaining accident
without worry or Impatience, and after
sszpper sat on the porch of the small hotel.
.her eyes fixed In wondertcg awe upon the
distant mountains, beyond whose peaks
streamed the glory of the setting 6tin.
"Ehe looks like home," Balnbridge said,
tn&l eating her with a nod.
"She's that kind," Lee returned, with
the assurance of knowledge gained by ex
perience. He was a married man.
They lousf ed out and took a bench near
her.
"Going on with the coach, ma'am V Lee
ventured after a while.
"Why, yes," ehe replied, pleasantly,
rocslng. "I'm going out near Wallace."
"Why, that's our postoffice 1 Just a
ehack, you knowâ store and postofflce to
.Bether. Are you locating in that nelgh

.'"Yes, <julte near. And you are some of

Â¦Jaughed like a pleased child and put out
.her hand as she Introduced herself.

â¢the' name, but they shook hands cordially.

For something over half an hour Robert
Weston had been wandering about, mak
ing almost reckless purchases at the ta
bles and playing the lottery with all the
abandon of a born plunger. To all ap
pearances his course about the place was
very like that of a ship without a rudder.
Yet there was method In his madness, and
all the time he was being outrageously
swindled at the various booths from tho
corner of his eye he was watching for a
certain white dress and a crown of cop
per-colored hair. Presently his patience
was rewarded. Far down toward the palm
screen he saw her sink into a lawn chair.
He deposited his bundles In an undignified
heap on a neighboring table and made his
way to the lawn chair.
"Nan," he said gravely as he came up
to her, "you're tired to death, poor child."
"Oh, no," she said, "only I'll be glad
when it's all over."
"Come away from It for a while," he
advised. "I'll take you down to the boat
house."
She rose and slipped her hand through
his arm. Together they descended the
slope tn the river and went out to the
end of the little pier by the boathouse,
where they sat down on a rustic bench.
"Well," Weston said, "was lt a suc
cess?"
"It would be if everybody spends money
as recklessly as you have been doing,"
she replied.
He laughed. "I was partlculary fortu
nate In the lottery," he explained. "I
drew four bags of peanuts, a doll and a
box of hairpins. My last purchase was
three aprons and a half dozen flatiron
holders. Imagine it," he chuckled.
"Anyway," she said, "you've done your
best to. help us out You're a dear, good
boy."
"Ah!" he said solemnly, "I knew I
would bÂ« discovered some time."
"Tell me. Nan, what this Is for," he
went on after a pause; "prayer-books for
the Esquimaux or blankets for the Fiji
Islanders?"
"The money goes to St Agatha's Home
for Orphans and Foundlings. We support
it mainly," she explained.
"H'm-m," he mused. "Don't suppose
you ever see the 'orphans and foundlings."
do you? Just turn over the monev to
'em and let lt go at that, eh? Say, Nan,"
he said with a sudden seriousness, which]
rather surprised her, "I don't believe all
this giving money to charity is the best
way of dolnc It." Â¦ -.-^
"Indeed." she remarked with something
like a challenge In her voice.
"No. I don't," he asserted 'with em
phasis. "There are plenty of old money
bags trying to buy a chance to heavea
who'll look out for that end of lt. I say,
for those who are fitted for it. persona]
work among the needy Is the most prac
tical thing."
"Perhaps a few details would make
your suggestion more explicit, Robby,"
she said.
"Undoubtedly." he assented cheerfully.
"Now, for Instance, take a case I know
about. There's an orphan, and he's cold
and hungry and lonesome. It isn't so
much money he needs as some one to
take an interest in him, to stand behind
him. as lt were. You see, they won't
take him Into a horn* â " ,.'â
"Why not?" she interrupted.
"Well," he said slowly, "to begin with
his ageâ" ,
"What Is his age?"
"Thirty-one."
"Gracious! I should say he wouldn't
get into a home.Jhe age limit at St. Ag
atha's is flfteen. w Thirty-one!"
"I realize It's a crime for him to be
thirty-one," he said. "Still, that really
isn't his fault"
"What's the matter with hlrar* she
asked sharply. "Doesn't he work? Is he
lazy?"
"The laziest rascal alive," he said. "But
he really doesn't have to work, you know.
He's got money enough, aa far as that
goesâ keeps a horse or so and an auto
mobile. When I said he was cold and
hungry I meant he was cold for lack of
Interest and hungry for sympathy andâ
oh, hang it! You know well enough what
I mean. The orphan is me.*' he burst
out ungrammatically, "and â and â for
heaven's sake, don't send all your charity
to St Agatha's, but save a little for tha
lonesome, thirty-one-year-old orphan."
"Bobby," she said severely, "ycu're pro
posing again, and you promised me you
wouldn'tâ not for a year."
"An ability to tell the truth rever did
run In our family." he said dismally. "I
assure you I won't offend in the proposal
line again, however."
"No. J don't think you will," she said
laughing.
Something in her eyes made him sud
denly slip an arm about her and draw
her close to him.
"What makes you so sure," he asked
very gently.
"I've been thinking lt all over, and I've
concluded that charityâ now Bobby. let
me go. And you stand over there by
the rail. Yes. that's right. I've con
cluded that charity begins at hom,"

favorite barroom remodeled into a sani
tarium, but It was heaping insult upon
â¢ Injury to have a 25-horsepower French
racer flashing over roadsâ and good roads,
tooâ long sacred to the festive cow pony.
With Harvey Thatcher, owner of said
.racer, the pood roads surrounding Fort
Norton, the county ceat of Buena Vlsta
Cocnty. had been the main attraction.
When his physicians had ordered Colo
rado air Thatcher had stipulated that sec
tion of Eastern Colorado where the roads
â¢would permit him to break the already
fcriniant record cf The Comet And so
Â« happened that he and his machine, his
valet and his chauffeur were thorns in
the flesh of the cowboy element, even
. as ths latter had worried the respecta
â¢ b'.e faction among the early citizens of
.Tort Norton.
The cowboys had barely become accus
tomed to the presence of The Comet in
their midst, end had decided that It
might prove dangerous to ehoot up a
gasoline engine, when there arose fresh
cause for dissatisfaction. Nan Bearce
took tn ridlnsr In The Comet And Nan
was the prettiest girl In Buena Vista
County, or all the adjoining counties for
that matter. She had been the toast of
every camp on the" range, the belle at
every ball, the aueen of every county
fair tournament In which the cowboys
had fought for honors after their own
peculiar fashion. Her favors had been
evenly distributed and her devotion had
gone to bÂ«r worthless father, who ran
the one shoe shop of which Fort Norton
could boast. A dilapidated, evil smelling
den he kept at the end of the street
leading north from the postoffice, but the
three rooms behind the shop were as fresh
and sweet as Nan's stout arms and sun
shiny nature could keep them.
There were men, dozens of them. In
Buena Vista COunty, who would have
been willing to overlook the father, mis
erable, drunken wretch that he was. for
love of the girl, but she seemed too proud
to foist the old man on any of her anxious
suitors. The only favor she had ever
been known to accept was at the hands of
Ben Heth, a stolid, almost morose young
ranchman, who had started into the
stock raising business In a small way,
and who held himself aloof from the rol
licking, roystering element which had
terrorized Fort Norton at regulax inter
vals. When old Bearce had been smitten
with smallpox, Heth, under cover of
darkness, had removed him to his own
ranch, because of Nan's horror of the
pesthouce, and the three had endured the
relentless quarantine together. Then the
Intimacy had apparently been broken off,
old Bearce going back to his bench, Nan
to her poverty-stricken life and Heth to
his lonely existence on the cattle range.
All this was before Thatcher and The
Comet came to Fort Norton. After old
Bearce had skillfully mended some rents
in Thatcher's leather robes the friendship
between the dashing automobillst from
New York and the humble and beautiful
daughter of the village shoemaker became
town gossip. Women discussed It over
their b.ack fences and at the sewing cir
cle of the Union Church. Men shook their
heads around the stove at Gilbert's gen
eral store and the news spread out on the
range. Thatcher was making a' fool of
Nan Bearce, and there were mutterlngs
that boded 111 for the owner of The Com
et. The only man who declined to discuss
the situation was Ben Heth and that even
after Nan and young Thatcher had ridden
out to his ranch twice In the devil's wag
on, as one old woman called It To bo
sure, the chauffeur was In attendance,
but what is a chauffeur, perched up in the
back seat, with Nan, enticing, alluring
Nan, her soft brown hair tossed by the
wind, her eyes dancing with the excite
ment of the run, urging the young New
Yorker on to higher speed.
Once they had been seen coming back
to town at a slow pace, with Ben trying
to keep his astonished pony within talk-

WILD FLIGHT OF CUPID AND THE COMET.
were still hunting for Heth. after having
razed his ranch . cabin. The Comet was
piled high with luggage, a couple of
dress-suit cases showing above the boxes,
and. rubber blankets, which filled in the
body of the machine. Thatcher explained
in a casual way that he was trying some
new roads and might be gone a week or
more. The cowboys sent him on hl3 way
with a volley of shots. They were bent
on more serious work.
The Comet shot along the country road,
through the soft twilight and the limpid
moonlight, straight across the State line
into Nebraska. At precisely the same
time the Overland Limited ..was carrying
a white-faced but determined girl over
the same State line.
Thatcher Insisted upon giving away the
bride and receiving the first kiss after the
ceremony. He said it was due for excess
baggage on the best run The Comet had
ever made. Then the great red machine.
Its owner, his chauffeur and his valet
rolled back to Fort Norton, without the
Impressive array of luggage, and Harvey
Thatcher, tenderfoot from New York, an
nounced that when a certain bunch of un
mitigated fools had finished their annual
spree and had recounted their blankety
blank calves, the bride and groom would
come back to Fort Norton, at which time
the damages claimed by said groom for
Injury done his property and his reputa
tion would be paid or the Sheriff of Buena
Vista County and one Harvey Thatcher
Esq. would know the reason why.
Whereupon eald Harvey Thatcher
promptly rose In the estimation of the
cowboy element and his horseless vehicle
was forgiven him.
Miss Cranford was folding the precious
veil.
"Perhapsâ erâ you would like to see the
ceremony at the church 7"
"Could youâ"
"Yesâ I knowâ erâ where the cards are
kept"
Mrs. Cranford protested. Her daughter
smiled scornfully.
"They would not mind, mother. It's
all a part of the show."
A tinge of color spread over the "foot
man'o" face. He paused on the lower
step.
"I'll sendâ I mean I'll bring the card
over this afternoon."
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Elsa Cranford, In a simple dimity frock
and a flower trimmed hat, was caught In
"Cousin miner*
"Will you please go "
1 "1 will, responded the young man, run
ning up the stairs, "anywhere you wish.'"
"Bless you, dear," said Suzanne, drag
ging Frank into her mother's room, where
six pairs of feminine eyes rested despair
ingly on a hideous, three-cornered tear
In Suzanne's wedding velL "That must
be mended, and only one woman In town
can do such workâ Elsa Cranford. Now,
If "
"Where does she liver' Frank picked
up the cloud of lace, yellowed by time,
and looked at It critically. "I suppose
that If you were not marrying a lord you
would wear a nice, clean, new veil that
would not tear when you looked at it.
This Is rotten." ,
Mrs. Lynde Was shocked.
"But this Is an heirloom. It Isn't every
girl who can be married In the veil worn
by her mother and her grandmother be
fore her."
Frank bit his lips. He wanted to say
that the average girl who married a title
through the more or less fragrant media
tion of a social matrimonial broker did
not care to discuss her grandmother.
When he had heard In Paris of his cous
in's engagement to this heir of an Im
poverished English ' name he had discov
ered that, evÂ«n after two years, wander-
Ing on the face of the globe, Americanism
was strong within him, and he hated to
see the bulk of the Lynde fortune go to
build up a decrepit English estate.
".You will find Miss Cranford at 213
Elmhurst , avenue. Tell her she must do
it at once and wait for it We cannot
take chances at this hour. Pay her any
thingâeverythingâbut have It done. Tell
Forbesno the brougham must meet the

"Don't apologize, Suzanne," laughed
her cousin, taking the package, "if you
had a whole racing stable at your com
mand to-day every horse would be out
I'll use my own mount and enjoy the
ride."
And so he rode awayâ past the stately
manors of Industrial magnates, past the
less pretentious homes of real suburban
itesâInto a sleepy, country-like lane,
lined on either side with small cottages
and gay gardens. At 213 he tied his horse
to the cap of a near bronze Jockey and
stalked up the path. A slender, graceful
young woman was training a climbing
rose on the shady side of the porch. She
drew off her garden gloves as Frank
stated his errand and stood in the warm
June sunlight, studying the torn veil crit
ically.
"It will take at least an hour," she
eald, turning toward the house. "Will
you wait?"
"Yes, thank you."
He sat down on the step and removed
his hat. Above him, on one side of the
table, strewn with magazines, papers and
sewing materials, eat an elderly woman
â¢with carefully dressed white hair. On
the opposite side of the table was a
vacant chair. Miss Cranford paused be^
fore It, looked at the unconscious Mr.
Lynde with a slight frownâ and sat
down. After all, there was not such
a wide breach between the status of
a footman In a millionaire's household
and a professional member. Besides,
under existing conditions at the Lynde
residence, a tired footman might be
forgiven a slight breach of discipline.
She clipped her thread thoughtfully.
Dame Fortune moved In a mysterious
way. There was young Harry Lynde,
brother of the bride. Insignificant and
stupid, and here was a footman molded
on the lines of a Gibson model, with the
easy grace which no end of dancing les
sons could Impart to the unfortunate
Harry.
The little garden waa very quiet, and
Elsa's needle flew In and out of the lacy
weave. Finally Mrs. Cranford's curiosity
" triumphed over her dignity.
"I suppose everything Is ready for the
wedding?" . .
"Everything, I believe." He frowned
slightly. t "â¢:,-Â¦ Â¦},'.
"It is a great occasion, with Lord This
and Lady That coming all the way from
England, but every time I think of that

"Do stop that nonsense, mother," ex
claimed Elsa sharply. "She does not de
serve pity, no matter what comes to her
In the future. . She marries Lord Har
wood with her eyes open. She knows the
man's past, she knows his need of her
money and she knowsâ "
The "footman" crushed his riding hat In
his hands, iv^*.: 1
"My dear, you are so positive."
"Well, mother dear, we ought to know.
The papers have contained no other news
for weeks. And they will be full of It
again when she sues for a divorce. It
Is all so very silly. Everything that man

is everythingâ far, far above titles, coro
nets, castles and a corner In he Queen's
throneroom."
Silence once more fell upon the, trio.
The shining needle fairly flew. The girl's
bright eyes were fixed on her work. The
man, gazing through the i vista of prim
gardens and close cropped trees, was mur
muring under his breath, "the honest love
of an honest man."
Would she understand the difference be
tween that little affair of three months
in old Japan and an "honest love?" Then
there had been Madeline! But that could
not count! Why, he had even forgotten
her last name !
the crush of scintillating robes. An usher
with a gardenia In his coat was Just of
fering his arm to a stately dowager when
ho dropped something. He bent over and
the dowager was passed on to another
usher. "When the first man straightened
up he extended his arm to Elsa. She gave
one gasp and all the color faded from
her face. Then, with head proudly up
lifted, she started down the aisle at his
side.
"Please don't look like that," he whis
pered. "It was beastly caddish of me,
but I do look a bit like Harry's English-
manâ andâ andâ well, I'm glad I hoaxi
your frank opinion on such things any

They were at the pew door. She slipped
in without a word, but as shÂ« raised bÂ«i

HEROICS
By The Parson
If you should learn of some dark sin.
Pray never tell;
The truth may cause the tears to start.
The truth may break another heart.
The truth may tear two lives apartâ
So never tell.
No harm is done through unknown
deeds,
So never tell:
Some hearts know less of day than
niaht
Don;t be the first to cause the blight.
Don t rob a life of sunshine brightâ
5o never tell.
The world is cruelly unjust.
So never tell:
If we but knew how hearts may break.
If we but knew how hearts may ache.
We d leave them Hope for Love's sweet
. sake,
And never tell.

who was one of the famous Van Daum Van Chubbs, wakes up in the morning about 3:30 p. m. and while waiting to

more, s hired people to trace her descent from Alfred the Great and so she has nothing left to lone for. I was
readin her interview with a New York society reporter the other day and I never felt so sorry for anybody in mv life.
What is there left for me to do? she said, almost with tears in her eyes." "There's only one night in every

THE ORACLE OF
MULBERRY CENTER
By S. E. RISER
rj }^â¢"ft MAN died in England the other .day, leaving behind
**Â»!- It 1 him an excellent though somewhat circumscribed repu-
tation as a literary worker, and a considerable body of
J_jjiAX i PÂ° etrv Â« much of which ought to be more widely appre- 'â¢
â "**Â¦Â» 'ZrV ! c^ tc d than it ever has .been, or will be.. But he made one
poem which will give him immortality. And in the
-V^ course of it he coined a phrase which for many a year
and perhaps many a century will be passed from lip to Â¦
lip by those who themselves may be ignorant of its origin, but who will find
it a trumpet call to noble living. This is the special verse which is sure to
have wide currency:
It matters not how straight the gate,
How charged with punishment the scroll,
I am the Master of my fate.
I am the Captain of my soul.
"The captain of my souL" How the phrase stirs the blood and haunts
the memory. It voices the protest of an unconquerable will against the de
crees of fate. It is the outcry of the baffled, but not of the beaten. It is the
embodiment in line of classic simplicity and force of an indomitable purpose
not to be overthrown and crushed bv the ills and woes of life.
Something was said in these columns not long a^o about the advantage
of having a hero, some greater spirit to which one might look for Quickening
and inspiration. . Such an ideal is good as far as it goes, but better vet is it
to weave into the very fiber of one's nature a heroic strand, to get as a com
ponent part of one's being the fixed determination to hold one's self steady
and serene, not to let reason become unseated or judgment dethroned or
hope become paralyzed whatever befalls you.
The basis of such a temper is the realization of the fact that while we
cannot control external events we can forever remain monarchs of that do
main which we call the inner life. We can become so independent of the out
ward scenes of circumstance that they will leave hardly more impression upon
us than the gentle breeze of summer has upon u sturdy oak. Our store of
faith, hope, love and courage may not be lessened even when all the stars go
out of our sky.
Here is a man #ho makes an unfortunate marriage. Here is one who is
suddenly plunged into financial ruin. Here is a third, who. after long and
patient struggle, is compelled to admit . that he has failed miserably in his
profession. But if any of the three possesses the really heroic temper he will
say to himself: "Well, these things are terribly hard to bear: thev are due
partly to my own lack of foresieht and energy and partly to other people, but
I will not let the present situation blight the remainder of my days. I may
be a disappointed man, but I will not be a ruined one. If the outward props
have failed me I will turn to the inward sources of supply and cheer."
Now that seems to me a kind of heroism beside which charging up San
Juan hill in the face of the enemy's fire is a comparatively easy thing. Not
for such moral heroes are the rewards of fame or the plaudits of a grateful
country. No one trumpets far and wide the details of this battle withTone's
soul. It is fought out in loneliness and with tears and bloody sweat. But
no conqueror returning from his campaign ever tasted such sweets of vic
tory as does the man who fights his battle through until he can honestly say:
"I am the captain of my soul." And sometimes that last added ounce. of de
termination may be just the force that compels the outward obstacle to yield
as the Confederate armies finally melted away before Grant's grim purpose
to fight it out, even if it took all summer.
At any rate, whether or not the mastery of one's soul brings in this life
external prosperity and success he who does achieve the captaincy of his soul
may cherish as his own the faith of an American poet. Dr. Washington Glad
den, who sings: S53K
And fierce though the fiends may fight
And Â«ong though the angels hide, iiv ,
I know that truth and right
Have the universe on their side.' \"
And that somewhere beyond the stars
Is a love that is better than fate.

the first person my eye lit on was your grandma, standing in the back of the

glaring at me in a mighty unpleasant way.
"Tell 'em, John," she said, right out loud before everybody.
There was no way to run. for the elder had hold of my hand, and there
was no place to hide, though I reckon I could have crawled into a rat-hole.
So, to gain time, 1 blurted out:
"Tell 'em what, mam?"
"Tell 'em how you come to have your lesson so nice."
I learned to hate notoriety rijrht then and there, but I knew there was no
switching, her off onto the weather when she wanted to talk religion. So I

And Ardelia, fortified by ham and'egga,
went stolidly forth into the grass and si

In the middle of her bunch the new

The ladles clapped their hands at - her

For Ardella was growing ghastly pale
before them; her eyes turned inward, her
lips tightened. A blinding horror surged
from her toes upward, and the memory
cf the liquid Ice cream and the frying
onions faded before the awful reality of
her present agony.
Later, as she lay limp and white on
the slippery hair-cloth sofa. In Mrs. Sla
ter's musty parlor, she heard them, dis
cussing her situation. ,
"There was a lot of Fresh Air children
over at Mis" Slmms'e." her hostess ex
plained, "and they 'most all of .'em said
the, milk was too strongâ did you ever!
Two or three of 'em was " sick, like this
one. but they got to love It In a little
while. She will, too."
Ardella shook her head feebly. She
had learned her lesson.
Miss Forsythe stared at the dirty, trail-
Ing roots that stained her linen skirts
and sighed. â¢
"Thank you. dear," she said politely,
"but I meant them for you. I meant you
to have a bunch. Don't you want them?"
"Naw!" said Ardelia decidedly, nursing
her cut hand and stepping with relief on
the smooth floor of the porch.
Miss Foreythe's eyes brightened sud
denly.
"I know what you want!" she cried.
"You're thirsty! Mrs. Slater, won't you
get us some of your good, creamy milk?
Don't you want to drink, Ardella?"
Ardelia nodded. She felt very tired,
and the glare of the sun seemed reflected
from everything Into her dazed eyes.
When Mrs. Slater appeared with the
foaming yellow glasses she wound her
nervous little hands about the stem of
the goblet and began a deep draught.
She did not like It: It was hard to swal
low, and instinct warned her not to go
on with It. But all the thirst of. a long
morningâ Ardella was used to drinking
frequentlyâ urged her- on, and its icy
coldness enabled her to finish the glass.
She handed It back with a deep sigh.
The young lady clapped her hands.
"There!" she cried. "Now, how do you
like real milk, Ardella? I declare, you
look like another child already! You can
have all you want every day â why,
what's the matter?"
Ardelia bent over again, tugged at a
thick stemmed clover, brought it up by
the roots, recovered her baiance with dif
ficulty and assaulted a neighboring daisy.
On this she cut her hands and, sucking
off the blood angrily, she grabbed a hand
ful of coarse grass and, plowing through
the tangled mass about her feet, laid the
spoils awkwardly on the young lady's lap.
"Gather them! Get a bunch! Oh." you
poor child! Mrs. Slater, she doesn't know
how.V Miss Forsythe was deeply moved
and illustrated by picking imaginary dais
ies on the porch. Ardelia's quick eyes
followed her gestures and, stooping, she
scooped the heads from three daisies and
started back with them, staring distrust
fully into the depths of the thick clinging
pra.-ss as she pushed through it. Miss
Forsythe gasped.
"No. no. near! Pull them up! Take,
the stem, too." she explained. "Pick the
whole flower."
"Now uick them! Pick the daisies!"
cried Miss Forsythe excitedly. "I want
to see you."
Ardella looked blank.
"Huh?" she said.
A bare-legged boy In blue overalls and a
wide straw hat then drove them many
miles along a hot. dusty road, that wound
endlessly through the parched country
fields. To the young woman's remark
that that they needed rain sadly he re
plied, "Yep!" Â»nd held his peace for the
following hour. Occasionally they passed
another horse, but for the most part the
cr.ly sight or Bound of life was afforded
by the hens clucking angrily as the trav
elers drove them from their dust paths
in the powdery road. At last they turned
Into a driveway, and drew up before 'a
gray wooden house. Ardelia, cramped
with sitting still, was lifted down and
escorted- up the shingle walk to the porch.
A spare, dark-eyed woman in a checked
apron advanced to meet them.
"Terribly hot to-day, ain't It?" she
felghtd. "I'm real glad to see you. Miss
Forsvthe. Won't you cool off a little be
fore you go on? This Is the little girl, I
s'pose. I guess it's pretty cool to what
she's accustomed to, ain't it, Delia?"
"No. I thank you. Mrs. Slater; Til go
right on to the house. Now, Ardelia, here
you are in the country- I'm staying with
my friend in a big white house about a
quarter of a mile farther on. You can't
see it from here, but if you want any
thing you can Just walk over. Day after
to-morrow is v the picnic I told you about.
You'll see me then, anyway. Now run
right out in the grass and pick all the
daisies you want. Don't be afraid; no
one will drive you off this crass." J
The force of this was lost on Ardella,
who had never been driven off any grass
-whatever; but she gathered that she was
expected to walk out Into the thick, rank
growth of the unmowed side yard, and
strode downward obediently, turning,
when in the exact center of the plat, for
further orders.
At last they stopped. The young woman
seized her hand and led her through tha
narrow aisle, down the steep steps, across
the little country-station platform, and

In the room where her mother was frying
onions, she experienced this same fore

day lingered yet in her memory. So she
set her teeth and waited with stoical res

"Stands where?" Ardelia, looked fear
fully behind her.
"Oh, I d'know. Out In that swamp,
mebbe."
Again he smoked.
Time passed by. To Ardella It might
have been minutes, hours or generations.
An unspeakable boredom, an ennui ", that
struck to the roots of her soul possessed
her. Her muscles twitched from nervous
nest. Her feet ached and burned In the
stiff boots.
Suddenly Mr. Slater coughed and" arose.
"Well, guess I'll be gettln' to ! bed," he
said. "Come on, boys. Hello, little girl!
Come, to visit with us, bey? Mind you
don't pick poison Tine." '
He shuffled Into the house, and -the boys
followed him in silence. Mrs. Slater led
Ardella upstairs Into a little hot room
and told her to get Into bed quick, for
the lamp drew the mosquitoes.
Ardella kicked off her shoes and ap
proached the bed distrustfully. It sank
down with her weight and smelled hot
and queer. Rolling off, she stretched her
self on the floor and lay there disconso
lately. Sharp, quick stabs from the
swarming mosquitoes stung her to rage;
"Just then he hears a big feller stngin'
out, 'Better go rrrround! Better go
rrrround! Better go round!'"
William rolled out a vibrating bass not*
that startled the bull frogs themselves.
" 'Lord!' says he, 'is It deep's that?
Well, I'll go round, then.' 'N' off he'
starts to walk around.
" 'Knee deep! Knee deep! Knee deep!*
says the peepers.
William gave a startling imitation of
the peepers; his voice was a high, shrill
wall.
" 'Oh. well.' s* he, 'If it's knee deep I'll
wade through,' an' he starts In. .
"I guess so. An' he heard a voice nlnjr
in' out: 'Knee deep! Knee deep! Knee

Ardella obeyed, and glancing timorously
at the shadows slipped around to his side.
"Onc't they was an ;ol' feller comin*
along cross-lots late at night, an* he come
to a pond,' an' he kinder stopped up an*

"Had a what?" interrupted Ardelia.
"He was sort o* rollin' roundâ he didn't
know JuFt what he was doln' -" .
"Oh! Jagged!" said Ardelia, compre
hendlngly.
â¢ Slowly against the background of this
machine-like clicking there grew other
soundsâ weird, unhappy, far away. '
"Wheep, wheep, wheep!"
This was a high, thin crying.
"Buroom! Brrroom! Broom!"
This was low and resonant .and solemn.
Ardelia scowled.
"Wha's 'at?" she asked again.
"That's the frogs. Bullfrogs and peep
ers. Never heard them, either, did ye.?
Well, that's what they are."
William took the pipe out of his mouth.
"Come here, sissy, 'n' I'll tell y' a story,"
he said lazily.
Another long silence Intervened. .The
rocking chair swayed back and forth and
Mr. Slater snored. Little bright eyes
glowed and disappeared, now high, now
low, against the dark. It will never' be
known whether Ardelia thought. them de
fective gaslights or the flashing, chang
ing electric signs that add color to the
night advertisements of her native city,
for, contrary to all fictional precedent,
she did not Inquire with Interest what
they were. She did not care, in fact.
After half an hour of the katydids Wil
liam spoke.
"Nick Damon's heZpln' In the south'lot
t'-day," he observed.
"Was he?" asked his mother, pausing a
moment in her rocking.
"Yep."
Again he smoked, and the monotonous
clamor was uninterrupted.
"Ziz-a-zag! Ziz-zig! Zib-a-zlg-a-zig!"
"Naw," said Ardella.
"Zig-a-zag! Zig-a-zag!" Then a rest.
"Zig-a-zlg! Zig-a-zig-a-zlg!"
She looked restlessly at Mrs. Slater.'
"What's "at?" she said.
"That? Oh, those are katydids. I
s'pose you never heard 'em, that's a fact.
Kind o* cozy, I think. Don't you like
'em?" ----*Â» : ,
She leaned 'back and cocked silently to
and fro, and Ardella -waited for the
events of the evening. There were none.
She wondered why the gas was not lit in
nil that shadowy darkness; why the peo
ple didn't come along. She felt scared
and lonely. A new, unknown depression
weighed her down. â¢ It grew steadily;
something: was happening, something con
stant and mournfulâ what? Suddenly she
knew. It was a steady, recurrent noise,
a buzzing monotonous click. Now it rose,
now it fell, accentuating the silence dense
about it. ' â¢ . ' .
"There, there, Delia; , If Â¦ only a cow.
She won't hurt you. She tires the milk"
âArdella shudderedâ "and the butter, too.
Here's Â«ome bread and butter for you.
We've had our supper, but I thought the
sleep would do you more good." .> '-Â¦
Still shaken by the shock of that pant-
Ing, hairy beast, Ardella put out her hand
for the bread and butter and ate It gTeed
lly. Then she stretched her cramped
limbs and, looked over the umbrella. On
the porch ' sat a bearded man In . shirt
sleeves And stocking- tret, his head
ti.rown back against his chair, his .mouth

ARDEXIA IN ARCADY.
Lie down at full length on your side
and spread the legs so that both feet can
be firmly planted on the ground later on.
Then assist with both hands to raise the
body on one outstretched arm and hold
the other outstretched directly above the
former, so that it will be In readiness
to support the body In Its turn. (Figure
4.) When the balance Is complete shift
It completely to the other side and arm.
taking care that the body does not sag
down, but -presents a straight slanting:
line. Keep going over in a circle and re
volve either forward or backward.
Later on. when this can be easily done,
bend iin and backward the head, upper
back and legs, so that the body, will form
as much cf a semicircle as possible. - At
least make them go higher than the ab
domen.
This vigorous exercise Is especially good
for the trunk.
IV. The One- Arm Roll.â The one-arm
roll is ouite severe for beginners, but
even the weakest can master It with a
little perseverance.
Place the abdomen on the log and have
the head, knees and feet on the ground
to begin with. Stretch the arms to their
full leneth clear of the ground In front
of the head, and then bring the body In
Si straight line, with the abdomen alone
touching any earthy thing. (Figure 3.)
The placing of the legs over the head
keeps the abdominal region and the or
rans contained therein in fine trim. .The
pushing is Rood for shoulders, arms and
neck The stretching of the muscles along
the spine cures weaknesses of the back,
and. the enlarged supply of blood Insured
the head banishes headaches.
III. Equilibrium Exercise.â This Is ex
ecuted on a log eighteen Inches or two
feet In diameter, or a rock, or a mound
cf earth or sand.
Next, push harder with the arms and
spring up to a standing position the mo
ni^nt the toes touch the ground.
Lie down flat on the back, with the
palms of the hands on the.'pround at the
sides of the head and with the fingers
pointing back of the head. Raise the legs
and lower part of the body over the head
until the toes touch the ground. (Fig
ure 2.)
When you become adept push against
the ground with the hands while the legs
are being carried over the hoad. draw the
head from between the arms and lie flat
on your stomach. :.,'.;-

DO you remember how. when you
Â¦were a boy, you used to roll
around In the grass when you
were taken to the country for the
summer? Do you remember what your
father used to say: "Let the rascal roil;
It's good for him?" And. more Impor
tant still, do you remember how the toss-
Ins exhilarated you and sent you to bed
o' nights ready for healthful sleep?
If there lÂ» any business man who re
members these thlnrrs let him lose his
manhood's dignity for the sake of his
health when he goes into the country
this summer. In the roly-poly system of
outdoor, hot weather physical culture.
Herein lies the chief value of the ro.y
poly system. Man scarcely ever aids the
heart In its work of lifting blood to those
parts of the body above it. principally
the head. He Is bo particular about ket-p- .
Ing his head higher than his feet at all
times that he sleeps on a fat pillow and
takes special care not. to bring his head
Into bodily exercise any more than he
can help. Consequently the brain's blood
eupply la neither varied nor stimulated
In contradistinction to other portions of
the body. 60 the brain goes on craving
for more blood and physical exercise,
which is as necessary to it as to other
parts of the body, and the result is Ian- â¢
guor. Etupor, headaches and other kin
dred troubles.
Let the man who has been in his office
the year around, or who smokes too
much, or who has been living too high.
I start with the simplest roly-poly exercises
and gradually work up to the harder
ones. In this way he will accustom his
body to strange positions that once were
natural and easy of accomplishment with
out any accompanying traces of dizziness.
But If he should become dizzy let him
rest and try It again, and before long no
uncomfortable feeling will be noticed.
The exercisesâ four are described below
âwill poon let the man know where ho
Is weak and what muscles need bui'.dlng
up. Let him heed the warning, center the
mind on these parts and strive earnestly
to strengthen them against the day of
disease. Let him not be annoyed by any
strain on those parts, for this will be a â¢
rure sign to him that his efforts are hav
ing a beneficial effect.
I. Side Rolling.â Lie down fiat on your
back on a grass plat or the seashore.
Bend the leps. grasp the tots on the out
side in the hands and see that the feet
are tonohiner. Pull a little in opposite di
rections with feet and hands, that the
arms may be well stretched. Then at
first roll from side to side on the back
only. (Figure 1.) When you become more
proficient roll clear over and make a
sharp effort to land on your back again.
As In nearly all of these exercises, the
whole of the body is benefited, but the
parts especially lookr-d after are the neck,
due to ho'.ding up the head: the should
ers, the upper legs, the small of the back
and the region around eieh knee.
IL The Rack Roll.â This is a difficult
nut excellent oxerciFe for a fat man, as
It epeediLv reduces the abdomen by con
tracting, ft in an unusual way.

age of'BOda and three ounces each of
bay rum and rose water.
After moistening the hair with this
mixture it can be curled easily If put
up on "kids." Or the tongs may be
used If dispatch 1Â« necessary. The use
of tongs once or twice a day is not
harmful. Heat the tongs Just enough
Â¦o they will not eeorch paper. An at
omizer Is convenient to use In moisten
ing the hair, and either the lotion rec
ommended or a perfume can be used.
After twisting each lock about the
tongs hold them until you can count six
ty. The tongs are not too hot, the hair
Is damp and the pressure Is steady and
fcard.
The hair, by thla time, should be
cleansed and silken, and each Individual
hair made to shine. It Is a treatment
which certainly gives bloom to the hair.
If a maiden has only a brief ten
minutes In which to dry her dripping
hair after a bath it may be restored
to beauty and flumneea In short order
by the use of a nickel-plated hairbrush
with hollow back and teeth.
The brush is bo constructed that It
separates at the handle, and Into the
hollow back hot water can be poured.
The handle Is then adjusted and the hair
can be dried in a very few moments.
At least one thing can be- Bald in their
favor â they are cheap and can be bought
daily and lost without regret. Then they
protect the neck and lend an abandon to
the ensemble that Is In keeping with the
unconventionally of the moment.
Hats for mermaids need not be the plain
affairs cf years past. New ones are of
ribbons and flowers, bo recklessly ex
travagant is the modern maid. These
hats tie under the chin and are so large
that they completely hide the rubber caps,
which may be covered with shot or plain
ellk or plaid silk. The latter arÂ« tho
prettiest.
. Caps and bonnets aside, the pretty
jrlrl who roes Into the water with a
blue silk handkerchief knotted over
her hair, whether It la "golden, gray
and curly" cr can boast of only lamp
post locks, la bound to look coquettish.
"When I go out for a long swim or
a race," says one beauty. "I wind a
â¢silk handkerchief eecurely about my
head after braiding and binding up my
hair very tightly."
However, if tressea are allowed to go
unbound and get thoroughly wet. It Is
neither a long nor a tiresome task to
dry the hair and make it presentable.
In the first place. Bit down In the
sun. like little Sallle Waters, and nhake
out your golden locks, your raven locks,
your purple locks, or locks of whatever
hue. Let each separate hair have a
chance to become sunned and aired.
Especially let the scalp get well venti
lated. The sun's rays eure curative and
stimulating, and nothing Is better for
head and hair, ns well as complexion,
than a daily isun bath of ten minuter
duration. It gives life to the hair. The
eun may also sprinkle a few freckles
over your precious nose, but what are
they compared with abounding health
and vigor and beautiful tresses T
The hair dries In a surprisingly short
time when treated to a sun bath. - It
must then be brushed to give It gloss,
and finally a rub with a towel may ba
neceesary.
The rubber cap must be red with a wide
ruffle. This is the verdict of one fair
maid, who adds, "it Is the only headgear
for bathing which has the slightest pro
tense to adornment. Bonnets are too un
becoming to be Indulged In by the maid
who possesses a spark of vanity."
Another damsel thinks differently about
the bonnet question and will give as her
verdict that "the untrlmmed huge
bonnets that are strewed upon the beach,
heavy with moisture and burned by the
eun, are the most picturesque after all."
The ca;> is made of black stockinet lined
v.ith robber, and under Its edge is sewed
the suggestion of a fringe of hair. If such
frivolity is not out of the question. Then
the l-a: p. put up In papers concealed
beneath the cap. is ready to appear In
ail its glory when the sea bath is over.
This arrangement of the hair, with
rubber cap, and bra!<Js that are not
"really and truly" ones, is bo genuinely
protective that half an hour from the
time the wearer leaves the water her hair,
beautifully curled and dry. Is the envy
of all her friends.

She cultivates his taste* and makes her

acquires the chafing dish habit. 'Knowing

girl herself Is nourished on a steady diet
of wordly wisdom until she Is fairly ready
to choke.
If she rebels as girls have a way of re
belling, maternal wrath falls with a dull,
cold thud that is paralyzing.
The widow who* is more attractive than
her daughters, and there are many such,
keeps society guessing, and It not infre
quently happens that the young maa
whom It was natural to suppose enam

mother of the day. either as wife or wid

little widow who is so young, so lonely
and so fascinating.
She is dainty from the ground up. and
her soulful eyes play havoc on the mas

She cultivates a sweet pathetio little

Oh, the young and tender widow, with
her pathetic. chlld-Uke ways and pleading
eyes, could demoralize anything In tha

a rear admiral In all his gorgeous deco
rations, down to the cop on the corner or
the messenger boy in brass buttons.
And if she bemoans her loneliness *h*
can marry anything unappropriated la
the male line within eight.
Young girls speculate tearfully an th*
widow's charm and spend sleepless night*
guessing its source. The answer, la a
nut-shell, lies in two wordsâ worldly wis
dom.
The widow has had experience, and this
experience has taught her "a. thing or
two," as men say. - Â¦-. :
In the first place she Is older and has
more tact-x The bnisquerie of the school
girl or the debutante has toned down,
and In Its place Is the suavity that at
tracts by Its cajolery or flattery.
A young girl cares, little whether eha
pleases or not; she is more Belflsh. Sha
wants a man to cater to her whims; tha
widow caters to the man's whims. Tha
young girl is exacting; the widow Is com
plaisant. The young girl Is abrupt and
says what she thinks; the widow Is tact
ful and alms to please. The young girl
is easily shocked; the widow can't ba
Â¦hockedâ that is, a large and elegant ma
jority of them. In fact, the young girl
Is crude, tha widow the rectified spirit.
And yet. despite all we might say, wa
know nothing more of tha widow than
when we started out.
Each and every one of her Is a unique
figure that carries about her aa atmos
phere of her own.
Women never will understand her. and
the man who thinks ha does â well, ha
often wakes up with an awful shock.

more ridiculous than affectionate, and
which somehow do not impose on peopla

And this Is where death ia merciful to
the living, tender to the dead. . .^ ( .. < .
Then. comes the period of reaction from
the shock. At first she may be either
sorrowful, remorseful, or relieved; at any
rate, the death and attending scenes have
had a more or less depressing and ennob
ling effect.
If tbe woman has really loved her hus
band she Is heartbroken and thinks she
cannot live without him, and the period
of loneliness that follows has a wonder
fully subduing influence. If she has not
loved him she is. In a measure, dazed by
the shock that brings relief. In any event,
the awful visitation has a numbing sense
through which the woman's character un
dergoes a radical change.
The widow is essentially different from
the maid or wife, both in personality and
In characteristics.

September 2O.of the pearl fever In about every State
of th* Union. The first largo pearl Â«ver
found In this country was picked up at
Notch Brock, near Paterson, N. J., In
1857. It weighed ninety-three grains, and
was sold by Tiffany & Co. to the Em
press Kusenie.
The one pearl, however, was practically

some Â¦mailer ones were afterward found
In that State. Then occurred at broken

due to the discovery of the gem in Ohio.
Tennessee. Wisconsin. Arkansas, along
the Mississippi Valley and even up Into
New England and New Tork State. None
of theso so-called discoveries even pan
ned out and after a brief local excite
ment the bubble invariably burst. In the
Mississippi section, however, there was
always a well grounded feeling that pearls
were plentiful there.
Until the Black River gems began to be
put Into circulation the American variety
had never borne much of a reputation
and the popular prejudice against them
has not yet been entirely dissipated. As
the Arkansas items found their way to
Paris, however It was seen that they
compared favorably with the famed Ori
ental variety. Indeed, In soma few case*
they excelled. And since then the Euro
pean dealer has been quick to take ad
vantage of the low price.
He will purchase the domestio product
at a. ridiculously low figure aad send them
to India, where they are drilled and re
turned again to Paris and stamped as
Oriental pearls. Being thus classified. It
was easy to pass them on Americans trav
eling abroad at exorbitant price*. 2DvÂ«a
The boiling out process requires only a
short time and is for the purpose of open
ing the clams so that the pearls may be
found. When they are thoroughly cooked
the shells spring open and expose the
clam. The pearl Is found in the muscle of
the clam or between it and the shell. Of
ten times it is attached to the shell, but
very frequently it is not, and great care
is required to see that it is not lost in the
process of boiling and assorting. The
water In which they are boiled is carefully
strained, and ail the meaty parts of the
clam are pinched to see that a pearl is
not missed.
Although extremely commonplace In de
tail, the opening of a shell is attended
with great emotions. Any one of the pile
of clams before the pearler may contain
a fortune for him. As he reaches for
one after- another of the bivalves hope
bobs again into his heart, and as his hard,
horny hand closes over the shell prepara
tory to opening It he feels a little thrill
and his blood goes a little faster through
his veins.
Pearling as an Industry In the United
States is of comparative recent origin,
dating back to about 1897. Previous to
that time there. had been local outbreaks
In order to facilitate the handling of
the crowfoot the fishermen fasten two up
right forks on each side of the boat, on
which the dredge rod rests, the hooks
swinging freely. While the clams are
being taken from the hooks, the other is
being dragged and is ready to be hauled
in by the time the first is stripped.
Often when the clams are abundant
every hook will have one on it, and two
or three and sometimes four are fre
quently caught on one prong. When the
beds are compact one man can take 800
to 1000 pounds of mussels in a day, and a
case is reported where 2200 pounds were
obtained by one man in ten hours. The
average daily catch, however, is about GOO
pounds.
When a boatload of clams has been ob
tained or when night comes the fisherman
rows ashore and dumps his catch into bins
built on the bank of the stream. After
he has obtained a sufficient number of
shells, or when the weather Is stormy and

seen American pearls placed on display
for eala in some of the big Jewelry stores
while the owners of the stores themselves
thought they were the genuine Oriental.
The dealer would know for a- fact, be
cause he would recogniza some of the
very pearls he bad sold to a Parts mer
chant months before. .'
Arkansas pearls are as a general thing
much larger than the Oriental specimen,
and while they will not run as well as a
lot or "paper," some few gems are supe
rior in color, luster and size. Mississippi
pearls are poorer in quality and size than
the Southern or Arkansas gems, and are
not found as plentifully.
Meanwhile some few rich discoveries
are being made in the Cumberland River,
in the Kentucky and in the Ohio, which
hitherto have been very backward In this
respect. Undoubtedly the rivers of tho
Mississippi Valley will continue to pro
duce pearls for centuries to come, but
they will turn out such poor specimens
and they will be so few that fishing for
them can hardly be called an Industry.
And unless something In the way of leg
islation is done very soon the present In
dustry will turn out to be a bubble simi
lar to all of those that have gone before.
Mew Tork Importers have been larr* boy
era of these pearls, believing them to be)
Oriental.
The other pearl center In the United
Elates is at Newport. Ark. This city,
which has been lifted from obscurity by
the Industry, is situated in the very heart
Maurice Brower, one of the largest buy
ers in the local markets, declared that
the total production for 1901, which was
the best year in the record of the indus
try, was more than $1,500,000. Because of
the falling off of the clam supply be said
not more than $500,000 or $600,000 worth
were found in 1902. and. according to pres
ent indications, 1303 would not produce
much more than half that amount.
Fishermen and local buyers report the
buying and selling of pearls in the local
market, but as a pearl that sells on the
epot for $1003 or $2000 will bring when
brought to New Tork and "touched up"
from $8000 to $12,000 nothing like a correct
estimate can be made.
Primarily, this territory is divided into
two sections; each section has its market
center and around It are clustered the
richest pearl fields. The northern center
is at Prairie du Chien, Wis. This center
is for Mississippi pearls and is the seat
of the richest territory around. All pearls
along the Mississippi River from La
Crosse to Muscatine, Iowa, are brought
here for appraisal and market.
Buyers from New Tork and Chicago
hang about Prairie du Chien and the
vicinity and pick up valuable pearls from
local fishermen for a song. Afterward in
the market* of Paris and London these
bring immense prices. Because of this
free-handed method of buying and selling
there Is no way of getting at the exact
valuation of the output. The Government
has made some attempt to do bo, but
without much success.
Fresh water pearls come in clams.
Thry are formed by a nacreous substance
poured on a grain of sand that gets into
the shell. The clams are of all sizes and
description, but they are usually about
as large as a man's palm. The shell is
thick and black and rough. They are
found on all varieties of river bottoms
from deep, thick mud to hard, white eand
and gravel, and In all depths of water.
The extent of the pearl country is large;
It takes in the Mississippi River from La
Crosse. Wis., to New Orleans and reaches
out Into the by-streams and tributaries of
the big river for hundreds of miles.
Â¦ource from which came all this wealth,
has been entirely disregarded. The
economic -sense Is lacking. Pearling has
been carried on without method or rea
eon; there Is no law to regulate it. Any
one at any time may fish as many clams
from the water as he likes without regard
to the sire, the apparatus he uses or the
spawning season. Congress has tried to
Interfere and the legislatures of States
have been busy with measures regulating
the industry, but without avail.
of the richest pearl fields of the New
World. More than three-fourths of the
entire output to-day is found within a
radius of thirty miles of there. It Is the
market for pearls found in the White
River, which is producing practically all
of the best found south of Prairie du
Chlen. The products of the fisheries have
built its banks, laid out Its streets and
made wealthy its Inhabitants. AH the
products of the Black River, the richest
pearl river at one time in the United
States, have parsed through it.
Pearling is strongly individualized. The
method is crude and has chanced little
for centuries. It Is usually carried on by
two men In a skiff, with the aid of tongs
or shoulder rakes. The tongs are about
seven or eight feet long and are ope
rated like oyster tongs. The fisherman
gropes along the bottom of the stream
with them, pulling up wnatever gets Into
them. The rake Is operated in much the
same way. The instrument is eomethlng
like an ordinary garden rake, only larger
and has a longer handle.
A wire screen from the top of the rake
prongs is attached to the handle, forming
a sort of scoop. The rake is dragged
along the ground, catching clams and
other things. When it is full it is pulled
to the surface and its contents dumped
into th* skiff. Both of the methods are
extremely laborious ana can only be em
ployed whÂ«re the water is shallow and
where the clams are found In thick beds.
A much easier way to gather the clams,
and cm that is in more favor with the
Mississippi fishermen than with the Ar
kansas pearl hunter, is to fish for them
with "crowfoot" hooks. These hooks are
made with stout wire, small chains and
a hollow tube rod. The wire Is bent Into
eight hooks and attached to the small
chains In such a way that the prongs of
the hooks are at right angles to each
other.
The chains are then fastened to the rod,
which is either seven or eight feet long,
at regular distances apart. The number
of hooks to be attached depends upon
the length of the rod. A seven-foot rod,
with four hooks on each chain, the chains
being six inches apart, would have fifty
six hooks. One fisherman in a : boat can '
operate two of these.
The apparatus depends for its action
on the habits of the clams, or "mussels,"
as they are called. They rest on the bot
tom of the stream partly buried in the
mud or sand, with the free margin of
their shells turned upstream, and with
their shells separated to admit the wa
ter. When touched they quickly close
their shell, and if a foreign body is inter
posed between the valves it Is tightly
grasped and retained.
After rowing out Into the stream the
fisherman throws his "crowfoot" appax-

A necklace composed of more large pearls than
any pearl necklace ever Been In the United

There It will be sold .for $100,000. From the

It has lone been a popular conception, fostered by Jewelers, that the*
Oriental pearl Is the only kind worth having. They are deceived. Pearls "j
are daily coming Into the United States from Paris and London that were
found In the Black and White rivers of Arkansas and in the Mississippi.
They go to Paris, which is the European market for pearls, and are sent
from Paris to India. They are drihed In that faraway country, not be

which is dally becoming: of more interest to pearl Importers and domestic
pearl dealers, that the" largest pearls are found In the United States. The
necklace in question, although con. a nlng forty-one pearls, weighs 1935

SEA MONSTER THAT LIFTS
FORTY FIVE TONS
Anchored to the mouth of Oakland CTeefc, where it Is bus
ily engaged In lifting the bottom of the bay and deposltlur
It across the breakwater, that the channel may be deepened,
the largest d.edger in the world may be seen. It is the prop
erty of the American Dredging Company, composed entirely
of men of this State and is called the Uncle Sam. It was
entirely constructed here, the capital for It furnished by
local men, and It Is engaged in making Imperative Improve
ments In the bay under a contract with the United States.
This dredger exceeds in size and capacity anything of its
kind, not even excepting the Immense machines which were
constructed for digging out the Panama canal. It is a com
bined "clam shell" and hydraulic dredger and the only one
of its kind ever built. It was constructed especially for har
bor improvements and for reclamation work upon the tidal
and overflowed lands along the banks of the Sacramento
and San Joaquln rivers and their tributaries. The building
of It was directly instigated by the determination of the
"War Department to let large contracts for dredging the har
bor. For this work it Is admirably equipped and its energies
will be engaged for the next two years by the Government
on contracts for harbor improvements already let. '
Looking at the sturdy craft as it rides on the smooth
waters of Oakland Creek it seems hard to realize that within
Its compact limits are crowded the most powerful engines
on the Pacific Coast and that $176,000 worth of machinery and
timber are contained in the narrow space. The lumber alone
In the hull would make a email forest, there being almost
1,000.000 cubic feet used.
The main engines operating the bucket when the dredger
Is worked as a "clam ,,sheir"_ machine are the most powerful
ever used for this purpose. They are of the upright marine
type, are quadruple triple expansion and are capable of de
veloping 1250 horsepower, running 200 revolutions a minute
under 200 pounds of steam pressure. In constructing the
foundations for these engines 35,000 feet of lumber was used.
The "A" 'frame which supports the boom is the most
massive ever built on any dredger and weighs more than
fifty tons. It Is more than sixty-two feet high from the deck
and is made of six 24x24 timbers for side legs and two 18x24
timbers for back legs. At the top there is a solid cast iron
cap weighing about 18,000 pounds. Prom Â£hls the topping lift
Is run to the end ot the boom, and supports the weight of the
boom and bucket or ladder as the requirements may be.
When working the dredger as a "clam shell" machine
a boom 160 feet long asd 28x2S Inches square la supported by
the "A" frame. At the end of the boom are two large steel
sheaves six. feet In diameter In frames weighing; three tons,
over which are run the cables operating the "clam shell"
bucket. These cables are 1% Inches In diameter and ha.vÂ»
a combined tensile strength of 300 tons. The bucket us*.
is made of steel and opens and closes like a pair of shears.
The shells are shaped like rinds on a quarter of -an orange
when opened and when closed they form a half sphere. This
backet weighs empty Â£2,000 pounds and will lift in good stiff
material twenty cublo yards, wwighlns; thirty toj*Â»
. Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦ . Â¦ -
This enormous lead, together with the bucket, - weighing
In all more than forty-five tons, Is raised" from the bottom ot
the bay, swung a distance of 250 feet, emptied and the bucket
returned to its starting point In less than one minute. It
Is remarkable with what ease the operator can handle this
great crane. He is put to no more exertion than would be
required to lift his cap.
In the hull at each side, near the legs of the "A" frame,
and In the center of the hull aft and to one side are located
four "spud casings," each forty-two inches square and thir
teen feet long, weighing twelve tons each. In these casings
are placed the "spuds," which are not the potatoes used in
the galley, as some may suppose, but timbers eighty feet
Jong and thirty-8lx Inches square, which pierce the hull ani
rest on the bottom of the bay. These are used to anchoi
the dredger in any position desired without the use of cable:
or lines to the shore, and are raised and lowered by cables
By the manipulation of these the heavy hull may be swung
around to any position by merely touching the necessarj
levers.
At present the dredger Is being operated as a hydraulic
machine, which means that the bottom of the bay is ground
up by an immense steel shaft on the end of which Is a cutter
and then pumped through long lines of large pipe, the debris
being deposited In some cases 7000 feet away. As an example
of the power used in raising this Immense stream of semi
eolld material the writer was shown a piece of iron weighing
150 pounds that had been pumped through this huge pipe
without the slightest difficulty and dumped where the other
debris is deposited.
Located in the .hull on the kelsons arÂ© the boilers, pumps,
ell tanks, water tanks, condensers, evaporators, main engine
and blacksmith shop. On the main deck is the kitchen and
dining-room to accommodate sixty men; storeroom, electric
department, swinging engines, drums and frictions, machine
shop, air compressor, and cutter engines on the forward deck.
On the hurricane deck are located the water tanks for the
galley and the staterooms for the crew. There are accom
modations for sixty men all told, which is tho numerical
Â¦trength of the crew.
Above the staterooms is the pilot house, forty feet above
the main deck, In which are located all the levers, gauges,
etc., and from which point the plant is operated. Prom this
elevation a dear view Is obtainable of all the surroundings
and of -the pipe line running ashore. 'At night the whole

For not a traoe had he yet seen of the stranger in his lair. \
As he turned about to quit the place and seek the treeless r Uf "i
A rustling sound in a near-by bush thrilled his heated brain.
"By the land o'er which I reign," he said, In tones quits mellow,
"I think that I have found at last this strange, elusive UVLowW '
With courage that becomes a King, into the bush he dashed,
And soon, came out with, safe in hand, the stranger t w ,ti > *Ti abashed^ '
"Now, who are you and what are youf" the monarch gravely said; ,?/
"None of your kind have Z e/er seen in the U^d of which Z*m head."
The captive, filled with greatest fear, dropped down upon his knes
An<? pleaded Â«Jtat \* bo not harmed and forthwith be set free,
"You shall be spared," King Peter spoke, "for I think that you
, should be {
A Princeling in my family and be faithful e'er to me."
"They call me Pippin o'er the hills," the captive did explain,
"And over there, 0 worthy sire, they have no one to reign."
King Peter's eyes grew sparkling bright and he danced about in glee,
For he straightway determined' that he their King should be.
"Now, Pippin true, Prince number two^f or such I* do ordain,*
Henceforth you shall a general be In all my great campaign. . . "
I now command that you shall lead me and my faithful host
To this place of beings strange, where to my power they'll toast."
General Pippin, warrior bold, made a fine salute,
And started through the woodland dark, of glory in pursuit..
At last the King and Princes two came to a sudden stop,
And General Pippin whispered low, "Now, to our knees we'll drop
And crawl along until we reach yon ridge safe and secure,
Whereupon your Majesty can make his conquest sure."
Prom the ridge the monarch proud in wonder gazed an hour
Upon the merrymaking hosts o'er whom he would have power.
" Twere wise, 0 King, to arm ourselves," the general softly said,
"For some may not be overpowered until they're killed quite dead."!
Peter turned to Crookneck, who with fright began to squirm,
And commanded that he get for each a cat-tail strong and firm.
Crookneck scampered to a pond and found the weapons wanted,
And presently the warriors bold charged down the hill undaunted.
By strategy and wisdom great the monarch gained the day,
And not a head was bumped or bruised in the heat of that short fray.
The King, when victory was assured, felt very much enraptured,
And expressed desire to know about the things that he had captured.
Each captive knelt before the King, who stood upon a mound,
And swore allegiance ever strong, with earnestness profound, j
WhÂ«n all the host had given faith to the kingly one supreme,
King Peter promised guidance good and a father's love serene.
General Pippin called the roll, and each spoke out his nameâ
Some in voices loud and clear and some in accents tame.
Among the throng was W. Melon, big and loud of lung,
And Onion old, who stood near by his boy, whose name was Young.
Oxheart Beet, of reddest blood, piped out his answer shrill,
And next to speak was Fickle sour, whose given name was Dill.
Then followed chubby Eggplant, of gayest purple hue,
And happy Guernsey Parsnip, a subject food and true.
Bartlett Pear, with, skin of tan, unblemishedâ without flaw,
Preceded midget Bony, who was known to all as Straw.
There were many more, my pretty pets, that I cannot now recall-.
But every onÂ© a name spoke out and allegiance promised all.

and money. If they do not succeed in
bringing about war between Turkey and
Bulgaria or obtain European intervention
they Intend to blow up the Macedonian
cities, burn the villages and poison the
wells.
A dispatch to the Tageblatt from Con
stantinople, dated to-day, says:
"War with Bulgaria is In sight. The
Council of "War has recommended send
ing an amended ultimatum to Bulgaria,
but the Sultan has decided to wait. It
is rumored that Turkish troops have al
ready crossed the Bulgarian frontier
without a declaration of war.
"The members of the Council of War
were up all last night at the Tildlz
Kiosk and designated Edhim Pasha as
commander in chief.
"The Turkish press is printing Inflam
matory articles against Bulgaria."
The Turkish Government, according to
Information received from the Foreign
Office, notified the powers that the Port*
cannot guarantee the safety of the lega
tions In Constantinople.
This extraordinary statement was com
municated without explanation or quali
fying details in response to inauiriea as
to whether German marines were among
those reported by United States Minister
Leischman as having landed at Constan
tinople.
It is inferred, however, that the condi
tions at tha Turkish capital are not so
bad as the Sultan's notification would
imply, but that the legations have been
warned to look out for their own safety,
the Porte disclaiming in advance respon
sibility for any disorderly act.
The foreign officials added that the Ger
man embassy in Constantinople had not
reported whether German marines had
been landed nor whether marines of any
other power had been landed. Complete
official reserve is maintained on this
point.
It is learned from sources outside tha

NEW YORK, Sept. 5.â Advices from

are bound for home.
This news would seem to imply that
Congress will soon adjourn. There has
been no new action In regard to the canal

from the capital.
SERVIAN CABINET CRISIS
SEEMS TO BE AT HAND
Great ', Excitement Prevails Over the
Arrests of Officers of.
tha Army.
BELGRADE, Servia, Sept. 5.â An of
ficial note concerning the recent arrests
of Servian army officers says that tyen
ty-elght officers, mostly lieutenants, were
arrested on ., charges of insubordination
and that their disciplinary examination
Is proceeding.- The officers : arrested yes
terday have been released, but they have
been ordered to remain in their quarters.
Groat loca! excitement prevails. There
are rumors of a Cabinet crisis. King
Peter will return here to-morrow.
When the warrant for Griffith's arrest
was Issued the officers anticipated no dif
ficulty in. finding him, but they were des
tined to a surprise. Griffith had been
about the streets all day, acting as If
nothing , unusual had happened and re
peating to the persons who asked him
his story. of last night to the effect that
the, shooting of his wife was accidental.
He went about his business like a man
who had not a care. He had 'been in
formed of the intention of his wife's rel
atives to cause his arrest, but stated that
that . didÂ» not worry him.
Â¦i Later, in the afternoon, however, he
disappeared. It was learned subsequently
that he had gone Into retirement at the
solicitation, of his attorneys, not with any
view to. evade arrest, but because his at
torneys told him that his manner was
being taken .by the people as a brazen
exhibition of unconcern as to the fate of
his' wife, and, while they said they knew
"For a number of years Mr. Griffith
has acted as though he was afraid of
being poisoned. He seemed to conceal
that fear, but I noticed it. Even at the
hotel I had to order the meal for the
family as a whole, for if it came in in
dividual orders he ' would exchange por
tions with us. Some time ago he aqted
peculiarly. One night he stood in, the
room and said, 'Come in here, Hwant.to
speak to, you.' His look and manner so
frightened me that I ran out of the
house and away to my sister's place."
GRIFFITH DISAPPEARS.
to answer his questions, and asked: '
"'Did you ever hear- or know anything
about Briswalter being poisoned?" I said.
'Why, no. I knew that he had a sore
foot and blood poisoning from that and
nothing else.' He then asked: 'Have
you been implicated with or do you know
of any one giving me poison?" I replied:
'Why. certainly not; you surely know I
have not.' His third question was, 'Have
you always be^n faithful to your mar
riage vows? 1 I said, 'As God is my judge.
I have, and you know that I have.'
"As I answered the last question he
shot me. I was on my knees and I jump
ed up and rushed for the window. It was
closed, but I managed' to raise It and got
out. I sprang out and fell to the roof
below.
That the United States Government has
given up hope of favorable action by the
Colombian Congresii on the Panama ca
nal treaty was madÂ» plain to-night, when
a his-h official of the State Department
declared that the treaty was practically
dead t although the Colombian Congress
had until the 22d of this month to act
upon It. Official advices received here
convey the intelligence that the friends
of the treaty at Bogota have abandoned
their efforts in the interest of ratification
and some of them have departed for their
homes.
Dr. Herran remarked that Secretary
Hay's note concerning the dispatches was
extremely polite, but that it wound up
with the statement that, "It is needless
to say that you appreciate the gravity of
this matter."
POLITE BUT POINTED.
DISPATCHES ABE TRACED.
The department then traced its dis
patches from . the telegraph office in
Washington to Buena Ventura, Colombia,
where the cable ends and the telegraph
line controlled by the Colombian Govern
ment begins. There all trace of the dis
patches was lost, and Inquiry on the part
of the cable company, in the form of a
tracer, brought no satisfaction.
For some unexpected reason Dr. Herran
is avoiding the State Department. A day
or so ago, when it was anounced that Sec
retary Hay intended to call upon him for
an explanation of an interview in which
Minister Beaupre was severely criticised.
Dr. Herran said that he would visit Hay
at once. He failed to do so, however, and
has not called at the State Department
since. '.
The truth is that there is some feeling
between the department and Dr. Herran,
though outwardly a show of civility Is
maintained. Secretary Hay has been ex
hausted by the methods employed -by Co
lombia in attempting to manipulate canal
negotiations.
:.Pro"bf o'f. the. duplicity of tbe-<2plom:biah
Government agents, was obtained by-.the
department through a message from Min
ister Beaupre, dated August 25, which
accidentally found its way to the depart
ment. Beaupre reported that he received
no dispatches between July 24 and August
13, although others of a later date had
been received.

W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.âCable

Washington to Minister Eeaupre in Bo

department are being held up by the
Colombian Government. The adminis
tration has been for several days with
out information concerning important
proceedings at Bogota, and finding be
yond question that its dispatches are
being purposely delayed, has taken steps
to remedy the state of affairs.
It is learned that Secretary Hay to
day formally called the attention of Dr.
Herran, the Colombian Charge d'Af"
faires, to the fact that communication
between the department and the Ameri
can Minister had been cut off and asked
for an explanation. Hay, it is said,
made his communication very 'pointed,
suggesting that regrettable consequences
to both countries would ensue if sup
pression of dispatches were persisted in.

sued at 5:30 o'clock this afternoon for the
arrest of Colonel J. Griffith on a charge
of assault with intent to murder.
The complaint on which the warrant
was issued was sworn to by Deputy Sher
iff George Longfellow, who is connected
â¢with the office of the District Attorney.
Accompanied by Attorney Isadore Dock
weller and Joseph Scott, representing
Mrs. Griffith and her relatives, he ap
peared before Justice Chanbers of the
Police Court and made formal applica
tion for the warrant whicn was at once
issued.
When the Question of ball was men
tioned the attorneys for the complaint
endeavored to secure an order from the
court .refusing ball to Griffith, but it
was finally decided that this bajl should
be fixed at 515.003
HEAVY BAIL FIXED.
Griffith was represented by Attorney
E. D. Silent. He asked that the service
of the warrant be delayed until Mon
day for the reason that despite his great
wealth it would be inconvenient for Mr.
Griffith to give fl5,000 bail at that hour,
and unless he could give the bail required
he would be obliged to remain In Jail
until Monday.
In response to this request Assistant
District Attorney James insisted that the
warrant be served immediately if pos
sible.
â¢This man is accused of one of the
most serious of crimes," he said. "It
is no fault of his that the charge is not
that of wife murder. We consider that he
Is a dangerous man. that every moment
he is at large he is a menace not only
to his wife, but to others and we Insist
that the law take its course." t
It was ordered that the warrant be
served and the Instrument was placed in
the hand* of detectives.
When, at their conference this morning
the relatives of Mrs. Griffith expressed
the desire that Griffith be prosecuted,
they decided to ascertain what her wishes
were. Accordingly her brother went to
the California Hospital and the question
â¢was put to her directly. She unhesitat
ingly stated that she desired that her
husband be arrested on a charge of trying
to kill her.
' With' this Information her brother went
to the District Attorney's office and asked
that a warrant be issued. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney James then .went to the
"I then noticed the revolver, which he
was holding In his right hand and behind
him. I said, 'Griffith, put down that re
volver. Why do you hold itr He said,
â¢You don't think I would hurt you with
it, do your I again asked him to put it
down, but he did not do so. He told me
to close my eyes, but I was frightened
an donly hastily closed them. He told me
"I looked at him and answered, 'Why,
certainly.' He then said, 'Get down on
your knees and answer these questions. 1
He also told me to close my eyes.
QUESTIONS AND BULLET.
"After coming out of thebath house I
said: 'It Is warm; let us get Into the
air. 1 Mr. Griffith remarked that I had
better go up and commence packing and
he would go over and call on Wiley
Wells. I went on to our room at. the
hotel and began to pack. After a while
Mr. Griffith came In and said he would
help me. He folded up a coat and pair
of trousers of his and I told him not to
mind the little things in the dresser
drawer, I would attend to them..'\ Â» :
"Up to this time on that day nothing
of an unkind or quarelsome character
had passed between us. Mr.' Griffith
had been pleased by all his actions . to

that he looked peculiar as" he asked the
question: 'Would you swear on' this

He usually came down at that time and

to. the city on Friday morning. Mr. Grif

from Mrs. Griffith. This statement, after

POWERS FORCED INTO ACTION".
Hastened Crisis Compels an Agree
ment to Intervene.
LONDON, Sept. 5. â So threatening Iff
the Macedonian situation that the pow
ers are being forced , to^ take action
sooner than was expected. Emperor
Francis Joseph, it is now learned, has
brought the powers to a stage where a
decision is about to be reached regard
ing the character of the intervention
which should be adopted. It is authori
tatively denied that tne Intervention
contemplates the occupation of Mace
donia by Austria and Russia.
. "You may reiterate." said a diplomat
who is participating in the negotiations,
"that the powers continue to act in har
mony. .It is not true that Russia has
entered into a secret alliance with Bul
garia. Roumania is quiescent, but there
is an element of doubt in Servia in con
sequence of the predominance of the
military in that country."
All of the diplomatic advices available
here agree in the statement that order
prevails in Constantinople. The few
marines landed there from the guard
ships were merely for the purpose of
placing sentinels at the embassies as an
extra , precaution in consequence of the
Porte's warnings against insurgent
plots. !
D. G. Metaxes, the Greek Minister to
the court of St. James, to-day outlined

LONDON, Sept. 5.â Mail advices from
Salonlca says that the seizure of Ne
veska by the Bulgarians on August 23 and
its reoccupatlon by the Turks on August
27 were bloodless exploits. The Turkish
garrison, consisting of about 200 men, was
surprised and did not resist. About
eighty of the soldiers surrendered and the
remainder escaped without their arms
and fell Into the hands of another Bul
garian band. The prisoners were not
harmed, but were utilized to carry the
captured arms and ammunition to the
mountains. They were then liberated.
When the Turks reoccupied Neveska
and Klissura, on August 27 and 28 re
spectively, the fears of the inhabitants of
a repetition of the Krushevo excesses
were not fulfilled. The conduct of the sol
diers at both places was correct.
It is supposed that the official Turkish
report saying 200 soldiers out of a gar
rison of 240 were killed at Neveska was
due either to the unwillingness of the au
thorities to admit that such a large gar
rison was bo easily captured or to the
belief that the Insurgents would certainly
kill their prisoners.

This fact, then, is highly important.
That an examination of Mrs. Griffith's
face immediately after the shooting
showed as follows: The upper portion of
her left cheek was powd.er burned," and
powder marks were well scattered in and
around her right eye; the bullet struck
against the Inner and upper portion of
the -bony wall of the orbital cavity: the
bullet split. as it struck the hard, sharp
edge of the bone and one' part of the lead
passed downward to the right, lodging
behind the eyeball, while the other and
smaller part passed upward, grooving the
eyebrow and forehead and lodging un
der the scalp.
Mr?. Griffith's supporters claim that the
foregoing facts show conclusively that
the firing ' of the revolver was done by
Colonel Griffith exactly as described by
his wife:- while the husband's friends
claim that the facts are proof that the
weapon was discharged while its posses

point appears evident, viz.â that the re

Attorney. Charles Silent late to-night
At midnight her fever had not increas
ed, but she had not slept more than two
hours during the night. What her phy
sicians fear now Is that meningitis will
develop, and there are also indications
that the injuries received when she jump
ed from' the window to escape, as she
says, a second shot, are much more se
rious than at first supposed.
Â¦ One of the physicians who is attending
her made this statement late to-night:
"Mrs. Griffith is* far from being past
the danger point and we cannot deter
mine what turn her condition may take.
It all depends upon the next forty-eight
hours.- At present there are Indications
that inflammation may develop In the in
jured eye, but we are trying to prevent
that. We consider her condition serious,
very serious, and for one I do not wish to
make any predictions as to the result, al
though we Â¦ all hope for the best."
Much, it is claimed, will depend upon
the .very nature of the wound in Mrs.
Griffiths' eye as a means of determining
whetherher statement that she was shot
with murderous intent or whether the
statement of her husband, which he still
adheres" to, that it was an accident. Is
really the fact. He has also made the
statement .that the weapon was dis
charged while they were scuffling for
its possession.
NATUBE OF THE WOUND.
Although Mrs. Griffith's condition Is not
such as to indicate that har injuries will
result fatally, it is not at all satisfactory
to her physicians. She was conscious all
day and to-night went to sleep early, but
there has developed a feverish state
caused by the excitement incident
to having given a sworn statement
to the deputy District Attorney, which
the physicians think may cause a decided
turn for the worse.
PHYSICIANS HAVE FEARS.
Not the slightest trace of him could
be found, and it was not until 11:30 o'clock
to-night that he waa located and the
warrant served. Through Griffith's sec
retary, William H. Knight, Deputy Sher
iff Longfellow was informed that the
much sought man was at the home , of
a relative, Dr. Griffith, at Sixteenth and
Valencia streets, and thither the officer
went. He. found his man there and Grif
fith himself was the Jlrst man to meet
him at the door. He had been notified by
telephone that the officer was coining
and was ready for him. As he opened the
door he greeted the officer with utmost
cordiality.
"Come right in and sit down," he said.
"I know, your mission and you hafe only
to do your duty. No, I don't want to
read the warrant," he added as the officer
produced the paper which meant the loss
of Griffith's liberty unless a bond was
forthcoming.
"That would be only a mere form," he
said, "I waive that. Here is your bond.
Please examine it and see that it is cor
rect."
With this he handed Longfellow a ball
bond for $50,000, prepared In regular form
end bearing the signatures of John S.
Slauson and Robert Hale, who made af
fidavit that they were worth $100,000 and
$150,000 respectively.
"Don't think I have any the less re
gard for you because you have had this
unpleasant duty to perform," said Grif
fith. "I knew you only did your doty.
Good evening, sir. If I can be of service
to you command me."
He then closed the door and the officer
proceeded to" the "Sheriff's office and made
due return on the warrant.

SOCIETY OF MAYEXOWER
DESCENDANTS CONVENES
NEW YORK, Sept 6.â Francis N.
Benque, 46 years old, a photographer,
was committed to Bellevue Hospital to
day to be examined as to . his sanity.
Benque had been arrested for writing a
letter to Secretary of State Hay in which
he threatened the Secretary if a claim of
$41,000 was not paid. Benque haa written
letters on the subject to the various Pres
idents and Secretaries of State. since the
administration of Harrison, none, how
ever, threatening until this letter to Sec
retary Hay, in which he declared If Hay
did not attend to his claim he would at
tend to Hay. Magistrate Cornell de
clared that he did not believe- .Benque was
in his right mind and committed him to
Bellevue Tor examination.
The Washington police statÂ« that the
amount demanded by Benque from the
authorities' of Hamburg, Germany, was
10,000 marks. This sum, he says, was In
vested in 1SS9 in a photographic gallery
in that city, and he claims to have lost
it when he was expelled because he re
fused to perform military duty on the
ground that he was an American. He
was given three days to leave Germany,
but through Secretary of* State Elaine
had the time extended to three months.
The alleged threat in his recent letter to
Sacretary Hay was in the statement that
he had written eight letters to the Gov
ernment to have his claim enforced, and
the present one would be the last. He
said he would take up the matter then
himself and whatever he did would be "In
self-defense." The letter, like its prede
cessors, was long and rambling.
ACTION NOT HAY'S.
"WASHINGTON, 'Sept. Â£.â The following
authorized statement was given to the
Associated Press to-nisht:
It is understood that the action in the case
of Benque, the writer of the threatening letters,
was not reoorted at the instance of the Secro
tary of State. Mr. Hay received a good many
such letters and as a rule pays not attention to
them. In this case the letter came Into the
hands of officials of the State Department, who
thought It showed a disposition which might
lead to mischief. Benque's threats were not
aime<I especially at the Secretary of State, and
It was thought probable that he would make a
Journey to Wnshlneton to carry them out, but
being so much nearer to Oyster Bay !t was
feared his disorder of mind might lead him
there. For thin reason it was suggested to
the proper officers that the matter should be
looked into.
It was learned that Bennue had writ
ten Secretary Hay no less than 100 letters
in reference to his alleged claim against
Germany, and in this last communica
tion, which hastened tha determination of
the officials of the department to cause
his arrest, he notified Hay that he would
allow just three days to pay heed to his
demands, at the end of which time he
would make his move.
FEAR FOR PRESIDENT.
When asked about it to-night. Secre
tary Hav would not say that the writer
of the letter also threatened the Presi
dent, but the fear expressed in the state
ment above that the man's state of mind
might take him to Oyster Bay would lead
to the belief that he had communicated
such threat. Benque's' capture was made
possible by the fact that he made no
effort to conceal either his name or ad
dress, both being plainly given.
Secretary Hay has received similar let
ters from at least twenty persons ' and
he has heretofore paid no attention to
them, but In view of the recent episode
at Oyster Bay_and the present case the
determination has been reached to place
all such communications received here
after in the hands of the police, in the
hope of locating the writers and placing
them in custody.

LONDON, Sept. 5.â Considerable com
ment has been 'caused by a special dis
patch from Nev/ York to the Dally Mail,
declaring that a mistake In connection
Â¦with the Shamrock Ill's water line made
her defeat a foregone conclusion. The
correspondent says it is strange the error
in the design was not discovered in time
to prevent the formation of the unwar
ranted hopes by which Sir Thomas Lip
ton had been deceived, and intimates that'
some one blundered inexcusably.
The friends of Sir Thomas in London
are much exercised. They declare they
are aulte unable to see how the water
line mistake occurred and hope an ex
pktSiition will be forthcoming.
NEW YORK. Sept. 5.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton's two racing yajhts. Shamrock I and
III, lay beside a wnarf in Erie Basin to
day. The work of preparing them for
the trip home was not fully under way.
Shamrock. Ill still carried her racing
mast, but her Jury mast was lying on the
wharf ready to be stepped. The crew of
the defeated challenger is expecting to
Bail for home about September 14.
According to Hunter, Mrs. Hunter, who,
he says, Is an enthusiastic yachtswoman
and a member of the Clyde Corinthian
Club, has had ambitions ever since the
Valkyrie was lost off Hunter quay, Scot
land, to have a try for the America's cup,
and she has, he says, set aside a sum of
Â£20,000 for that purpose. Her idea is to
act as her own skipper and have an ama
teur crew.
. Hunter says that they have no inten
tion of interfering with Sir Thomas Lip
ton and that a challenger will be sent
only in case the Irish knight does not
challenge again. In the event of a boat
being built it will be by Messrs. Denny
of the Clyde.
Hunter says he once worked for Sir
Thomas Lipton and that he made his
money out of building operations.
MONTREAL, Sept. , 5. â Graeme Hunter,
â¢who Is stopping at the "Windsor Hotel in
this city and who claims to be a friend
of Sir Thomas LIpton, Is authority for
that statement that his wife has ambi
tions for the America's cup and may
send on a challenge. ' Graeme Hunter
comes from Arrocher, Scotland, and when
seen to-night his first statement was to
disclaim that he was a millionaire, as
reported. Mrs. Hunter is at her home In
Scotland.

In conclusion I am pleasfd to Inform you that

At an Interview to-night Commander
Peary said that the expedition would'be
made under the auspices of the Peary
Arctic Ciub of New York, of which Mor
ris K. Jessup is president. The club
will finance the expedition to the extent
of $150,000. which is $50,000 more than the
cost of the last trip, which occupied four
yearr
The attainment of the pole should be your
main object. Nothing short will suffice. The
discovery of the pole is all that remains to
complete the map. of th<? world. That map
should bÂ«- completed In our generation and by
our countrymen. If it is claimed that the en
terprise is fraught with danger and privation,
the ancwer is that geographical discovery in all
ages has been purchased at the price of heroic
courage and noble sacrifices. Our national pride
is involved in the undertaking, and this de
partment expects that you will accomplish your
purpose and bring further distinction to a ser
vice of illustrious traditions.
Distinctive features of Commander
Peary's plan are the use of Individual
sledges, with comparatively loads,
drawn by dogs; the adoption of Eskimo
methods and costumes, and the fullest
utilization of the Eskimos.
Commander Peary believes the advant
ages of his plan and route are a fixed
land base 100 miles nearer the pole than
any other route; a more rigid ice pack
extending farther poleward than is found
on the opposite side of the pole; a wider
land base on which to retreat and a well
beaten line of communication and retreat
from winter quarters to comparatively
low latitudes, which is practicable at any
season of the year.
Acting Secretary Darling of the navy,
who is a close student of Arctic work and
an enthusiastic believer In the ability of
American p'.uck and daring to find the
pole, says in his letter to Commander
Peary, granting him three years' leave
of absence from April 1 next, that he
thinks he is be-tter equipped than any
other ptrson In the country to undertake
this work. He pays a high compliment
to Pcary'e courage and ability and con
cludes his letter with this admonition:
Upon arriving at the Whale Sound re
gion he will take on board a large num
ber of Eskimo and establish a permanent
base at Cape Sablne. Thence he will force
bis way northward to Grand Island,
where he hopes to establish winter quar
ters on the northern shore. As far as
practicable al<Ag thÂ© route he will es
tablish caches. The following February,
with the earliest returning light, he will
start due north over the polar pack with
a small light pioneer party and followed
hi- a large main party.
In his letter of application to Acting
Secretary Darling for leave of absence
Commander Peary said:
I should expect to accomplish the distance to
the #o!e and return in about 100 days or a little
mort, an average travel of about ten miles a
day. Returning. I should break the ship out
lute in the season and return home.
If ice conditions this year were such as to
prevent reaching the northern shore of Grand
Island I should winter as far north 88 practi
cable and ffcrce the ship to the desired location
the following year. In this event the expedi
tion would be Kone two years.
In his letter of application for leave of
absence Commander Peary briefly out
lines his plans of action. In a suitable
ship built In one of our best shipyards,
reinforced and strengthened to the max
imum degree and fitted with American
engines, "so that she may go as an ex
ponent of American skill and mechanical
ability," Commander Peary hopes to start
with his expedition about the 1st of July
next.
"WASHINGTON. Sept B.-Commander
Robert E. Peary, United States navy, the
Â¦well known Arctlo explorer, will make
another dash for the north pole. Leave
of absence Tor three years has been grant
ed him, with the permission of the Pres
ident, by Assistant Secretary of the Navy

hearty sympathy of both of these of
ficials.

WHAT CAT7SES DANDRUFF.
Greatest European Authority on Skin
Diseases Says It's a Germ.
The old idea that dandruff is scales of
skin thrown off, through a feverish con-
dition of the scalp, is exploded. Prof.
Unna, Hamburg. Germany, European
authority on skin diseases, says dan-
druff is a germ disease. The germ bur-
rows under the scalp, throwing up little
.scales of cuticle, and sapping the vital-
ity of the hair at the root. The only
hair preparation that kills dandruff
germs Is Newbro's Herplcide. "Destroy
the cause, you remove tne effect." Not
only cures dandruff, tout stops falling
hair and permits a luxuriant growth.

A Btory is current to the effect that the
big deal Just announced is but the fore
runner of one that Is gigantic in com
parison. It Is said the Pennsylvania
Railroad has secured practical control in
the Pittsburg Coal Company, and this,
with the control of the river coal combine
through the Pittsburg Coal Company, will
give the Pennsylvania Railroad control
of one-fourth of the total output of bitu
minous coal In the entire State of Penn
sylvania. As a railroad, by law, Is not
allowed to operate any coal mines, the
holdings will be transferred to the Pitts
burg Coal Company, which will operate
the property.
PITTSBURG. Sept 5.â The Pittsburg
Gazette says contracts have been signed,
under the terms of which George I. Whit
ney of Whitney, Stephenaon & Co. of this
city undertakes to deliver for cash a con
trolling interest in the Monongahela River
Consolidated Coal and Coke Company to
the Pittsburg Coal Company. The trans
fer of control will be through the pur
chase for cash of a majority of the capi
tal stock, deliverable in either common
or preferred shares, or both. The Monon
gahela River Consolidated Coal and Coke
Company is capitalized at $40,000,000 and
its output last year approximated 6,000,000
tons of coal. The combination of inter
ests will represent a total of $132,000,000
and the tonnage close to 25,000,000 tons.
George I. Whitney, who engineered the
Etock transaction, denied that It presaged
a merger of the companies and said what
ever would be done In that, line could not
be until November 1. At that time it was
probably the plan to have the companies
operated under practically one manage
ment or dictation, which could be done to
mutual advantage. They would maintain
their individuality, however, as both com
panies operated in different fields.
Nightcap Party.
The members of Mission Lodge of the

asked to be placed on the retired list.
Newell Vanderbllt, recently unanimous

Infantry, located at San Rafael, vice
Cheda, passed a most successful exami

University.
Upon the retirement of Captain Thomas

Inter Nos Circle is known in the Com
panions of the Forest of America as the
brides' clrcla for the reason that not a
quarter passes but some lady member is
married. For a time every unmarried
woman who accepted the position of sub
chief companion was married before the
end of the term. This occurred six times
Intercession. Recently three of the
members did not wait to occupy the en
chanted chair, but were married, and ia
view of that fact a sum that had been
set aside to furnish souvenirs to all who
should attend the silver anniversary of
the circle on September 10, in the Alcazar
building, will be diverted from its origi
nal purpose and used to purchase wed
ding presents for these three brides. Ttvo
more members of the circle will become
brides before the close of the year.

George Nalley, a visitor from Windsor,
Sonoma County, was seeing the sights on
Friday morning and while on Grant ave
nue met two men, who invited him to
have a drink. He had several drinks with
them and finally they suggested that he
should accompany them to Golden Gate
Park. They walked along the park and
over the sand dunes till Nalley got tired
and sat down, saying he could not go a
step' farther.
Nalley fell asleep and when he awaken
ed in the afternoon he discovered that
his two companions had disappeared and
so had his gold watch and chain, valued
at $110, and his purse, which contained
about $35 in gold. Nalley reported his loss
to the park police station and gave a de
scription of the two men. Both were of
dark complexion and each wore a dark
sack suit and dark derby hat. One was
about 5 feet 8 inches tall and the other
about 5 feet 4 inches.

At the first of the fall meetings of the
Corona Club held last Friday in Mission
Masonic Hall there were present many
guests, it being an open meeting. The
first number on the programme was a
6oprano solo by Miss Wadsworth. She
was followed by President Culllnan of
the Mission Park Association, who asked
the ladies of the club to use their influ
ence with their voting friends to vote
for Mission Park, "for," said he, "to use
the words of Rev. Father Crowley, 'the
Supervisors have given the Mission the
County Hospital, the dog pound, the pest
house and the almshouse; now we want
something nice.'" The Mission district,
he added, had one-fifth of the entire vot
ing population and Its wishes ought to
be respected.
Miss Reed then sang a contralto solo,
after which the Rev. Mr. Rader deliv
ered a most interesting lecture on Rem
brandt, describing his splendid Dutch
conscientiousness and devotional spirit."
He spoke of his early life, his place
among the painters of the world and
cited that his merit was not appreciated
until after his death, for while he died
a poor man, one of his pictures after h Â»
death sold for $31,000. The lecturer then
described a number of Rembrandt's paint
ings, such as "The Rainstorm on a Sum
mer Day," "Jesus Preaching to the Mul
titude" and others, saying that in hi?
works he developed the poetry of the
commonplace and was the artist of the
ordinary. The programme closed with
two numbers by Miss Greeniger, "Thou
Art to Me" and "Love Is a Bubble," af
ter which the members and guests ad
journed to the banquet hall, where a dain
ty luncheon was served.

Calaveras County was represented by
Assessor W, M. Nuner Jr. and other of
ficials. Its assessment last year was
$5,557,900. This year's assessment is
$5,972,125. The Assessor said that some
Assessors claimed, judging from the
newspaper reports, that over 25 per cent
of the mortgages are assessed for less
than their face value. If such Is the
case, said Assessor Nuner, the money
lenders are surely not good busings
men, else they would not loan more than
the market value to tjie holders of such
property, nor can he understand why 25
per cent of the mortgages should not be
assessed at the cash value, for in Cala
veras County there are only ffc'e mort
gages assessed at less than the face
value and they are mortgages given un
der peculiar circumstances.
Labor conditions are much disturbed
on account of strikes among the miners.
The town of Jackson is dependent on the
mines. Whenever a strike occurs busi
ness becomes paralyzed. The dispute
between the Western Federation miners
and' the American Federation of Labor
has had something to do with the un
settled condition of Amador County.
Should any more strikes occur the af
fected mines will close down perma
nently. Â¦ '
There has been a decrease of 100 In
the school census. Timber land is al
most inaccessible. There are seventy
vacant houses In Sutter, Creek on ac
count of the closing down of some of the
mines. Amador's assessment in 1902
was $4,498,930. The assessment for this
year is $4,796,533.
Amador County was represented by
Assessor John Marchant and. other
county officials. The Assessor said the
condition of the mining industry in Am
ador County is not encouraging. There
is only one dividend-paying mine in op
eration. The Kennedy mine has not
paid any dividends in the last three
years. Last year the mine was assessed
for $114,000. This year it Is assessed
for $155,000. The Argonaut has been
idle since its litigation with the Ken
nedy mine, although it won the suit.
The Argonaut mine Is assessed for be
tween $50,000 and $60,000.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 5. â Supervisor
John Fritz of Modoc County waa the only
representative of that county before the
State Board of Equalization this morn-
Ing. Modoc is a stock-raising county,
although the price of stock is depreci
ating. The principal grain grown is
wheat, twenty bushels to the acre. This
year the yield was not up to that of
former years. There has not been much
new property added to the assessment
roll. The assessment on all town prop
erty was increased and there was an in
crease on every class of property. In
1902 the assessed valuation of Modoc
County was $3,216,423. This year it is
$4,076,680. Generally speaking the
county is in a prosperous condition.
VICTOR, Sept. 5.â A mass meeting, at
tended by several thousand citizens of
Victor, was held this afternoon. The
speakers were strong in their denuncia
tion of Governor Peabody's action in
sending the troops to the district, but
counseled) their hearers to treat the sol
diers with consideration and respect. Res
olutions were adopted declaring that mis
representation was employed In Inducing
the Governor to send troops to the district
and condemning the Governor's action as
"unwarranted by the facts and anarchis
tic In its inception, spirit and conse
quences."
The resolutions declare that the Cripple
Creek district is as peaceable as any in
the country, and protest against the in
vasion by the troops and the threatened
establishment of martial law. /
Everything has been quiet in the Crip
ple Creek districts since the arrival of the
military forces and it is thought that the
mere presence of the guard will serve to
quell the spirit of lawlessness which has
prevailed throughout the great mining
district since the early part of the week.
Last night military picket posts were sta
tioned all along the line of the Colorado
Midland Railroad from Divide to Cripple
Creek as a precautionary measure against
any attempt that might be made to blow
up the trains carrying arms and supplies
to thÂ© forces. No trouble was experienced.
DENVER, Sept. 5. â A special to the
News from Cripple Creek, Colo., says the
usual Saturday night crowds were on
the streets to-night and It was as
peaceable as usual. A member of the
Mine Owners' Association said to-night:
The miners will now be given an opportu
nity to work and in the event of their refusal
miners will be imported into the camp. The
mine owners are determined to start up their
mines and they will do so. Union or non-union
men will not be discriminated against. They
will have to go back under the agreement of
1894.
Labor day will be celebrated by the
miners on Monday as usual, notwith
! standing the presence of the troops.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Sept. 5. â The
State military forces which were or
; dered to the Cripple Creek district yes
! terday afternoon by Governor J. . H.
Peabody, under the command of Briga
dier General Chase and Adjutant General
Bell pitched camp about three-quarters
of a mile from Victor at daylight this
morning near the Stratton Independence
mine.
| In all there are now about 1000 equipped
| militiamen in camp and others have been
1 ordered to the scene of the trouble by
I Brigadier General Chase, including one
I troop of cowboy cavalry from. Meeker,
; Colo. By to-morrow morning the military
forces will have been increased to upward
of 1200 men. '

like all former triumphs of science this

Mahoganized Birch
Â«
One of the most usenil woods on the market is
birch. It is a hard wood, and when well finished in
mahogany color very few people can tell it from the
genuine mahogany. Â»And of course birch is much less
expensive.
Take, for instance, this mahoganized birch chiffonier
shown above. We offer it this week for $12.50. The
stock will probaSly last the week out, but come Tues-
day if you can â we close Monday and Wednesday.
A Dutch dining-room set now in our east window is

cloudburst in the Farmlngton River Val

to the wrecking of a passenger train on
the New Hartford branch of the North
ampton division of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad. The train
of three coaches toppled over on Its side
and about a dozen passengers were in
jured, none of them seriously. Had the
coaches fallen in the opposite direction
they would have gone Into Farmlngton
River.
The cloudburst washed out about 100
feet of the track at a point where the line
makes a curve. The engineer did not see
the danger point until his engine crossed
it and parted from the tender and cars.
The cars then toppled over.
The storm throughout this section was
the worst in many years.

on that date pay the parlor an official
visit. The work the evening will be

CHICAGO, Sept. 6.â Secretary' Shaw
was in Chicago to-day on his* way to
Deadwood, S. D., to attend a meeting of
the American Mining Congress. Regard
ing the action taken by him to relieve
the St.' Louis banks from the strain in
cident to expenditures on account of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, he said:
The banks at 8t. Louis have advanced di
rectly probably three millions of the ten mil
lions expended upon the exposition grounds and
buildings and indirectly nearly the entire
amount. In addition to this they have ad
vanced two or three millions to concession
aires. They are now facing the annual de
mand for money to move crops and are ship
ping out from $200,000 to $600,000 per day.
The Government has appropriated $5,000,000 to
aid the exposition. This Is applicable only to
meet the current expenditures. To relieve the
present situation I have arranged to deposit
two and a half millions in the banks of St.
Louis and as security the banks will deposit
five millions of State and municipal bonds,
such as New York approves as security for
money belonging to widows and orphans. This,
however, is intended as a temporary loan and
wlll.be gradually recalled as the five millions
appropriated Is expended.

FORMER QUEEN NATHALIE OF SERVIA. WHOSE UNHAPPY LIFE
ENTERS INTO A NOVEL. "WRITTEN BY MISS FRANCES GERARD.
AND SOON TO BE PUBLISHED IN LONDON. ,
â¢ : Â¦;Â¦ â¢ ..." ;â¢
The hit which Mr. Jack London's dog
story made will Increase the interest in
another book by him that Messrs. Is-
Miss Frances Gerard has written the
strange and checkered history of King
Milan of Servia in a book which Messrs.
Hutchinson are to publish. She had near
ly finished it before the tragedy which
wiped out Milan's dynasty took place at
Belgrade. Miss Gerard is already known
for a book dealing with King Ludwlg II
of Bavaria, whose life was also a curious
story. The present volume, which has
much to say of Queen Natalie and some
thing of King Alexander and Queen
Draga, will be entitled "A King's Ro
mance."
LONDON, Sept. 5.â If things remain
very dull In the publishing world
of London, there seems to be
plenty of activity In Edinburgh.
There has been of late quite a
revival at the headquarters of the old
publishing firms of Blackwood, Chambers
& Nelson, this being supplemented by the
establishment in the northern capital of
several new publishing houses. Oneâ that
O f d_ Hayâ has now become well estab
lished in 'a picturesque old house in High
street associated with the name of John
Knox. Mr. Sands, the London publisher,
has completed arrangements for begin
ning business in the central part of the
city, while George Morton, long business
manager with Blackwood, has opened
remises just a few doors away from the
famous office with which he has so long
been connected.
"All my works," said Goethe, "are con
fessions." So might Joseph Conrad say
of his. In one way or another they are a
sort of autobiography. They embody his
own experiences of life, personal or vica
rious. When a young boy, Just after he
had taken up the life of a sailor, he
shipped on a rattletrap of a boat run
ning between London and Australian
ports. Out of the Incidents of that voy
age, aiwl glamor of romance which his
youthful hunger for experience threw
over all the dirty work and peril and
hardship, grew the story "Youth," In
the Eastern seas he worked for many
years on both sailing and steam vessels,
and it was during that time he met with
the type of man whom he made into
the hero of "The End of the Tether," tHo
steadfast, faithful captain of the steamer
Sofal* The experiences which crystal
lized Into the weird and powerful story
of the African Jungle, "The. Heart of
Darkness." he deliberately -went out to
seek. In 1831 he -went to the Belgian
Congo, ostensibly to command a river
steamer, but in reality prompted by his
curiosity to see what life actually was In
that "Heart of Darkness." He returned
stricken with fever, the first day's Illness
since he was a boy of 18. How vivid an
impression he brought back only these
who have read "The Heart of Darkness"
can imagine.
bister are to issue In the autumn. Some
time ago he walked into their office and
explained that he had been living for
three months In the East End of London
to study life there. Then he took from h!s
pocket a crumpled manuscript of his
coming book, "People of the Abyss."
The passengers will find accommoda
tions in the car bodies arranged along
*a.ch side of the traveling structure, and
provided with a removable roof and sides
In order to permit ready means of ingress
and egress. The top of the rail Is only 6
feet above the base raiL In actual pracj
tice the cars will be run at a speed about
ten to fifteen miles an hour and will be
caused to col^de at about eight miles an
bour, which will be Quite sufficient for
As the illustrations show, the forward
ends of the pilots of the superimposed
tracks are provided with rollers and skids
which are so designed that one car shall
mount the other without shock. The
f>kids gently ride up the inclined track of
the car ahead and sufficiently elevate the
rollers of the pilots to permit them to run
upon the superimposed narrow gauge
track without Jar. The car itself follown
with a motion equally as gentle. In
actual Dractlce cars of ll^feet 6 Inches
in iength will be employed, the extreme
length being 43 feet.
Stern's system is rema.rka.bla chiefly
for the daring conception which It ex
presses and for tl*e exceptional Bklll
shown In devising mechanism absolutely
pale in its operation. In It a single track
Is used, on which railway cars are caused
to travel, either In the fame or opposite
direction. When one car meets another,
it 6imply rides over the roof of the oppos
ing car on specially provided rails, gently
rolls down on the other side upon the
track and proceeds upon its way as If it
had never left the roadbed. The photo
graphs herewith reproduced were taken
from an electrically-driven working
model, made strictly according to scale.
The cars, although they run upon
wheels, are really traveling bridges with
overhanging compartments for the ac
commodation of passengers. Over the
framed structure of the cars thus con
stituted, an arched track' Is carried, se
curely fastened to the car and serving
the purpose of providing a roadbed for
the colliding car/ This superimposed
track is built In accordance with well
understood principles of bridge construc
tion. The outer ends of each superim
posed track are designed to form with
the surface of the roadway an overhead
switch provided with specially formed
pilots and with a horizontal axis and a
vertical axlÂ». Upon each horizontal axis
the respective outer portions of the
arched track can swing vertically, and
upon the vertical axis the track can
swing to a limited extent from side to
side. The pilots of the superimposed
track are automatic In their operation.
When they ettfke the car ahead they
immediately travel up the inclined super
imposed way of that car, thereby guid
ing the car to which they are themselves
attached. After the superimposed car
has passed over the car below It, the
rear pilot as It descends will be lifted
and will gradually drop "by gravity to the
roadbed. The permanent roadbed upon
which the cars normally travel and the
superimposed track on each car are of
different gauges. The wheels of the car
resemble those which were once used on
old-fashioned cable railways, formed as
they are with a broad middle flange trav
eling in a centrally grooved track, with
lateral portions of smaller diameter sus
tained by flanges which flank the central
groove of the traak.
An electrical engineer of New Yorkâ
P. K. Sternâ now comes forward with a
contrivance which proves the scientific
American is fully calculated to tickle the
sluggish sensations of the most blase.
This apparatus is intended to furnish
the delightfully horrible experience of a
head-on collision, without, however, in
juring the passengers who are seated In
the railway cars employed. , ,
The "Ferris Wheel." "scenic railway."
"loop-the-loop"' and other contrivances
have come in their turn and have had
their day of popularity, but the crowd
Is aiiv-ays ready for something new and

The facts may be profitably read by the taxpayers, alongside of the Labor Union party plat
form and in connection with the bonding propositions to compel the taxpayers of this city and Oak
land to furnish capital for commercial enterprises under municipal ownership^ - \- â _____
The United States is in the printing and bookbinding business in the public 1 printing office
in Washington. The developments in the case of Foreman Miller, who was first turned out of the
bookbinders' union and then out of Government employ, and was reinstated by President Roose
velt, show that he proved that the Government was paying in its own shop 40 cents for work that in
private establishments costs only 8 cents. Being an honest man Mr. Miller was appalled at this. The
Government was paying 400 per cent more for work in its own shop than it could have had the
same work for in a private shop. Miller sought to reform this condition and was expelled from the
union for his zeal. The unions were making the 400 per cent out of the taxpayers,. and regarded it
as treason to their constitution to 'make them supply the taxpayers as cheaply? as private shops
would do it. >
This State has on its hands a commercial enterprise in the State Printing Office. Not Ion**
ago a comparison was made hetween the cost of work in the State office and in private printing
offices. It was found that the same work cost in the State office from 150 to 962 per cent more than
in private establishments. The taxpayers of California are compelled by law to provide the capital
for the State Printing Office, and are compelled to pay for every line it prints, and the cost to them
is so excessively above what it would be in private establishments that it seems like flattery to call
THE proponents of public ownership of public utilities make no .answer to the facts proved in
the case of purely business enterprises already carried on by the Government. The cities of
California are asked to tax all of their citizens to provide capital for investment in commer
cial enterprises. If it will pay to embark in those enterprises they, are able to provide their
own capital. If it will not pay it is tyranny to compel the taxpayer to provide capital for a non-pa}'-

Miss Helen Keller says In "The Story
of My Life" that she very early made up
her mind to go . to Harvard. She Is be
ginning her last, year in Radcliffe, which
Is the woman's annex of the university
In Cambridge. A story that has Just
come to light may account for Miss Kel
ler's early interest In Harvard.
Years ago. when a little girl, she re
ceived a doll from the Hasty Pudding
Club of Harvard. The students were at
that time much Interested In a certain
actress and many of them knew her well.
The actress heard from some of the boys
the story of Helen Keller, which was
Just beginning to be known. They club
bed together and bought a doll, and the
actress dressed if herself in the costume
of one of her own characters. The let
ter which the secretary of the Pudding
Club wrote to Miss Keller has been lost
but she has the doll still. '
Authorsâ even well-known authors
make curious clips sometimes. In one
novel Just out the author has associated
with the villain of the story another vil
lain, a Hindoo, who he calls Naorojl. It
Is Just as If an English author were to
call a North American Indian, Sioux or
Iroquls. by a Mexican cognomen. No
Hindoo that ever lived has been called
Naoroji, which ls'a purely Parsee name";
well known to Londoners by reason of its
being the name of a former member of
Parliament for Central Finsbury, a Parsee
gentleman, who has resided in London
for nearly forty years and Is widely re
spected. To take It as a label for a par
ticularly abominable, murderous Hindoo
man not of Parsee race is rather rough
on Parsees. It puts one in mind of a
rather famous writer "of a serial appear
ing in one of the Illustrated weeklies, who
made a man with a Mohammedan name
swear by Brahma.

Book Notes.
The latest doctrine is that as a people we do not sleep enough. It is even intimated that in
most of our cities a large number of persons do not get any genuine sleep at all, for the rattle and
bang, the jar and the whirr, going on day and night, reach the bedrooms of the masses and by dis
turbing the nerves prevent thorough restfulness even when sleep is soundest.
It is alleged that the increase of insanity and of various kinds of mania is due~mainly to the
lack of good and sufficient sleep. One authority asserts that unless we can in some way put a stop
to the increasing noisiness of our cities we shall eventually become a nation of lunatics, or at least
approximate it to such an extent that our lunatic asylums will become the most important of our
state structures, and prudent legislators will be liberal in appropriations for them because each .will
perceive that lie himself may be ere long removed from the capitol to the asylum amid the applause
of taxpayers.
It is strange that any well educated race of people should have to be advised to sleep more.
One would suppose that every man and woman of culture would understand the benefits of late sleep
ing and practice it to the fullest extent possible. The experts who are crying out against us for our lack
of sleep say we are living an unnatural life, and it may be so. Still the average American will hesi
tate to believe that his fellow-countrymen are as sleepless and insane a lot as the experts declare.
We live longer than our fathers. Infant mortality has diminished. greatly in the last fifty years.
Many diseases have been well nigh eradicated or rendered comparatively harmless. Our noisy cities
are healthier than were the quieter cities of old, and if we do not sleep quite enough it would seem
that our ancestors must have slept altogether too much, for we have improved upon their condi
tions. When all is said, however, it will do no one any harm to follow the advice of the new teach
ers and sleep as much as one can; for there are many men who are better citizens when asleep than
at any other time. _
WHILE as a people we Americans would be quick to resent any imputation that we are a
race of weaklings, it is unquestionably true that there is something about us which
keeps medical experts continually busy trying to diagnose the national disease. Some
say we are a race of dyspeptics and others say we are a nervous, high strung breed of
gamblers who are going mad. There are various other primary theories as to what is the matter
with us, and then there are secondary theories put forth to sustain the originals.
OUR SLEEPLESS LIFE.
amusement purposes. The Inclined tracks
Â¦with -which each car Is provided form a
gradient of 25 per cent. The actual power
to mount such a grade Is probably less
than that required to send many a rail
way train around a sharp curve. The
peculiar, "' arched structure, which sur
mounts each car, when considered in con
nection with the permanent track itself,
forms an undulatory roadway upon which
the cars travel with a motion very much
akin to that of a boat riding on a bil
lowy eea. The motorman is to take his
seat on the roof of each car at about the
middle, at which point he will have a
clear view of the track ahead and behind
him. When In operation a central slot
will be used, through which a plow
works, which will take up the current for
transmission to the motor. The rails will
be used as a return.
The fact is that the petty bandits who govern Colombia had a motive, and a low motive,
for defeating the American canal. money was bribing them in the matter, and they
earned it by rejecting the treaty. For the last two months Bogota has been full of agents and lob
byists against the treaty. They were not there to use arguments; for Central American politicians
are proof against reason. They have no proper patriotism, and are subject only to corrupt infln
ences. The astute enemies of the canal wasted no time in talk, and when their purpose was accom
plished, and the treaty was killed so near the time limit fixed for the exchange of ratifications that
it was impossible to reconsider the vote in the hope of a different result, it was necessary to give a
reason. It suited the corrupted legislators and the enemies of the canal who had paid their, price,
to put the blame on Secretary Hay. This would handicap him in future negotiations, whether, with
Colombia or Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
At last the rumor about Colonel Hay's note has been vindicated by its publication, and what
is it? Through our Minister at Bogota, Mr. x Beaupre, Colonel Hay informed the Colombian Gov
ernment that in the event' of failure of the treaty "the United States may be forced to take action
which would be a source of regret to all true friends of Colombia." The obvious and plain mean
ing of that is that, in* view of the alternative provided by our Congress, the United States will be
compelled to take action looking to the construction of the canal by the Nicaragua route, and Co
lombia would therefore lose the canal, to the regret of her friends, if the robber-ridden country
have any. Nothing else was meant and honest men could torture no other meaning out of the note-
Colombia has placed herself in a position now that endangers her own sovereignty over the
canal territory. It lies in the State of Panama. The people of that State have had contact with civ
ilization. Commerce lias passed over the Panama Railroad, foreign merchants are located at each
terminus of that thoroughfare. American warships visit the coasts of the State of Panama, and that
part of the Colombian people have had their ambition roused, and desire to emerge from the preda
tbry and bombastic atmosphere of the country and take on enterprise and put themselves in the
way^'of sharing the world's progress. So they threaten to secede from the Bogota government,
set^ijQi for themselves and negotiate for the canal, which they desire as much as do our own people.
The united States cannot promote such secession. But individual Americans will delight in help
ing it along, and our Government will not hesitate to give the de facto government belligerent
rights, nor to recognize it as a nation as soon as it has given the inland lowdalgos a good thrashing.
Wherever there is a gleam of intelligence in any State of Latin America it is the business
of American citizens co encourage it. If it takes the form of a revolution it is our right to direct re
sults toward the establishment of decent principles of government and to the creation of States in
which the rights of person and property will be respected. This duty will become also a pleasure
in the case of Panama, and there will; be no regret in this country if that revolution starts
promptly and even soon heads in conditions that will compel our interference as we interfered in
Cuba. The besotted government at Bogota may study the Cuban incident with profit, remembering
that we are great people for following precedents.
WHEN the Colombian Senate refused ratification of the canal treaty it was given out
from Bogota that the high hidalgos had been angered by the threatening nature of
the notes of Secretary Hay. Every one who knows the diplomatic temper and habit of
our Secretary of State knew this to be merely a pretext. But admitting that his
notes had been unguarded, what other people entitled to a place in the family of nations would let
an issue of punctilio defeat an enterprise of so much importance to their country and the world?
Americans desirous of the construction of the canal did not believe that Colonel Hay had
done other than wisely in handling the question for his country. HeTs not a man who threatens,
a course of action required it, he would be found advising his own Government in the application
of force; but he is too strong in diplomacy to threaten it in advance, for that is a sign of weakness,
and he is strong and has the world's strongest country at Jais back. \

to the Nevada Governor yesterday. Gov
ernor Sparks stated that Murphy and
Woods are in the Reno jail and were

that the American Tobacco Company, aft

bacco corporation, one of the largest to
bacco concerns in Japan, has announced
that the payment of dividends will be

nas caused great dissatisfaction to the
original owners of the property, who hold
a minority of the shares. Some of them
seem to feel that such an arrangement
is unfair, especially as heretofore they
received dividends regularly. Reports re
garding the American Tobacco Company's
action have caused many Japanese in

CENTRAL PROPERTY.
The realty sales of the last week have
, been less numerous tnan during some pre
ceding weeks. In fact, the sales in this
city during the month of .August were
not so large as those of earlier months
In the year. The total sales for August
amounted to $2,794,108 and numbered 463.
The explanation afforded by Thomas Ma
gee & Sons in their real estate circular
is that the midsummer dullness and the
disturbance in the Eastern money mar
ket were thÂ« principal causes for tho
quieter market. Concerning the home
conditions generally the real estate cir
cular reasons hopefully, eaylng:
Locally there seems to bÂ« no disturbing rea
son for the smaller total of sales except the
question of decided lack of Bupply of good in
vestment properties In the ro vara and loo
vara districts. This lack has been caused by
very heavy buying for the past year and by
the continued advance In price of the balance
of properties which are for sale. Many prop
erties are now in the market -at prices which
present improvement and present rates will not
Justify, but which would be salable if buyers
were not prevented from erecting suitable im
provements by the prohibitive price of labor
and material and the uncertainty ,of both.
Â£yon & Hoag have sold for the Ma
loney estate to Napoleon and Louise Va
silatos for $30,000 the property on the
north line of Eddy street. 111:6 feet west

SAN QUENTIN. Sept. 6.â A murder
was very nearly committed in San Quen
tin on Thursday. As a result one of the
convicts was cinched in the dreaded
straltjacket for thirty-eight hours and
now languishes in a dungeon. Although
the affair happened two days ago, it did
not become known outside the prison
walls until this evening.
James McGulre. doing ten years for
manslaughter, attempted to summarily
dispose of a celltender, J. B. Radley, also
a convict, by kicking and beating him
Into insensibility and then throwing his
body over the railing from the top tier
of cells to the asphalt pavement below.
McGuire has always disliked Radley and
on several other occasions had attempted
to harm him.
On Thursday Radley in his rounds
found McGulre's cell door open. Not
knowing any one was inside, he closed it.
This made McGulre, who was on his bunk
Inside, angry. He threw the door open
and rushed at Radley with a piece of
wood, striking him on the head and fell-
Ins him. lie then jumped upon the pros
irate body, kicking it unmercifully. The
noise attracted the attention of guards,
but before they had time to reach the
upper balcony McGuire was endeavoring
to lift the body over the rail in order to '
precipitate It below.
Radley was rescued and McGuire was
taken in charge. Warden Tompkins made
an Investigation and sentenced the cul
prit to thirty hours in the straltjacket.
When the time had *been served McGuire
was released, taken before the Warden
and lectured. He became ugly toward
the prison-keeper and he was speedily
given a 6econd dose of the jacket After
eight more hours of suffering he begged
to be released. He promised to be an ex
emplary prisoner and was sent to the
dungeon. Radley Is in the hospital.

Sheepshead Bay to-day. The big
son of Watercress, which was crowned
champion of the all-age division In the
early part of the season, to-day settled
all question of his superiority by his easy
victory. He broke the track record for
one and a half miles by covering the dis
tance In 2:31 3-5, which Is two-fifths of a
second faster than the time made by Wa
tercolor In 1901. Waterboy was third
choice in the betting, closing at 4 to 1.
This year's American- Derby winner,
The Kcket, was second and Heno third.
The ffeld that faced the starter probably
was the best and most evenly matched of
the year. Only five horses paraded, with
Hermis always a warm favorite at 9 to 5,
Heno being second choice at 13 to 5.
After a few moments' delay at the post
they were sent away to a good start.
Before they had covered an eighth of a
mile Odom sent Hermis to the front. Wa
terboy being second and Heno in third
place. This order was maintained pass
ing the stand the first time. Hermis was
full of running and fighting for his head,
but Odom had a strong ,hold on him.
Around the paddock they swept, with
Hermis two lengths In front of Water
boy. which was leading The Picket by
about three-quarters of a length. Round
ing the far turn O'Neil sent Waterboy up
to the leader. The pair ran like a team
for a few strides, when O'Neil gave his
mount his head and h*e shot forward and
soon had a commanding lead.

The talent was away out of line In its
Judgment yesterday at Ingleslde Cours
ing Park. In the first ten trials the form
players made what proved to be six false
favorites. The last of the ten was Flora
Belle, a 1 to 7 choice, which was defeated
by Jack Dennis' clever performer Re
mlsso Animo.
In the first course of the day Gambit, a
1 to 3 choice, was beaten by Lily Wright.
The last course of the day also provided
an upset, Eastlake beating the 1 to 3
choice Idaho Boy pointless.
The coursing was remarkable for the
number of long trials, the average being
more than- one minute. The relief dogs
were in frequent demand. A number of
the hares made good their escape.
Of the dogs left in to-day the best per
formers are Black Coon. Doc Burns. Full

Ninth of September Committee of
Native Sons of Golden West
Holds Final Meeting.
The joint 9th of September committee
of the Native Sons held Its last meeting
previous to the celebration in Native
Sons' Hall last night. Thirty parlors
were represented.
The several committees reported that
each had performed the duties assigned
and that all isJ now In readiness for the

tember 8, and in San Jose on Admission
day.
It was stated that Chief Wittman had
been asked for native born policemen to
act as escort to the parade in this city
and In San Jose, and that he said, he
would furnish the escort for this city,
but that he could not send any to San
Jose, as he had applications from ISO
Native Son policemen and he did not feel
that he could not make a selection with
out creating ill teeling, a matter he
wishes to avoid.
Mission Parlor has secured Eagles* Hall

a ball. Louis Schmidt has been selected
as the floor manager and Henry L. Maas

PORTLAND, Sept. 5.â There will be^B
prizefight in Portland on Friday next.
If Jack McClelland desires to wrest the
laurels from Aurelia Herrera he must do
it in eome other district, for not only do
the authorities promise to stop any at
tempt to hold the contest Itself, but they
threaten also to arrest any person who
attende the fight.
"There will be no fight," said John
Manning, the District Attorney, to-day.
"The public does not wajit tHe fight. The
law f oi oius. and I will not allow it to
come off; that's all there is to it.**
-So victory rests upon the banners of the
Municipal Association In the first battle
with that large portion of the pubtlc
which is interested in prizefights and
boxing contests. Jack Grant, who has
made all the arrangements for the pugi
listic exhibition, was at first inclined to
make a test case. This idea has, how
ever, been abandoned. The Municipal
Association, which originated from a
cemmittee appointed by the Calvary.Pres
hyterlan Church, is apparently to be an
other of the law and" order leagues which
from time to time raise their combative
heads in all Western cities. It proposed,

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 5.â It "begins
to look as If the historic Vlnctor
stake, which in the years gone by
was famous for many a hard-
fought contest, will be a. thing of
the past Â»" another year. To-day none
of the original entries cared to try con
clusions with Kenil worth, and for the
second lime at the meeting the strapping;
brown horse enjoyed a walkover for the
entrance money.
As a sjieclaJ attraction Gibney. the high
dh*r. electrified the big crowd by a
graceful seventy-four-foot plunge Into a
tar.k on the infield opposite the grand
etand.
The sport was above, the average, with
favorites takintf four of the seven purses.
The Pleasanton horse Ben F has quite as
Vug a mortgage on the pacing events as
George ci ho'.ds on the trotting numbers.
He *<i.s barred in the Letting this after
noon in the 2:" 1 * class pace. After finish
ing third in the first heat he won the
next three in ragtime, not being com
piled to travel faster than "ill. Walter
Maben secured second money and a mark
of 2:1$& with Ira by annexing the .first
heat. V
It was mostly small money in circula
tion in the rinÂ»r. and it does not come to
the surface until the runs are called. Pat
Bulger at 20 and Dr. Shorb, an 8 to 1 shot,
w* re the genuine surprises. Dick Havey
v r.s In gfod form, sending his fields away
nicely aligned.
By long odds the best performance was
ihat of Kocmtlua In the handicap, at scv
*n furlong'. The three-year-old picked
â¢jp Powell ar.i 1CS pounds, and after Glen
denxdag ha4 set the track ablaze for six
ar.d a half furlongs he caught and de
1 rated the faint-hearted sprinter a neck
in l:C6 l i. equaling the track record. The
ring laid 4 to B against the winner. Moun
ichank and The Miller were never In It
from the start.
Pat Bulger, which waÂ« sold on Friday
by Johnny Mellin to Jack Frawley for
jsn. captured the 2-year-old scramble at
odds of CO to L Frawley had the
mount, and overtaking Dusty Rhodes In
the stretch, won ridden out three lengths
before the favorite. Charlie Schweitzer,

sroond choice, refused to leave the bar-
On Thursday in a cheap selling dash
â¢won by Metlakatla. Elphln King, with
He:iÂ«1Â«--rson in the saddle and a hot favor
ite, finished a musty th:re. To-day with
Jarkson up and equal choice in the ring
with Jack Richelieu Jr. Elphin King #
made a show of his company. Jack
Richelieu Jr. ran second and Jim Gore
third. Henderson's riding lias been
open to criticism for some time, and
unless the boy mends his ways his finish
j? not difficult to prognosticate.
Dug Martin, an 8 to 1 shot, winner of
the mile Belling affair, was another eagle
bird for the books. Tuneful was con
sidered such a g-ood thing that the ring
quoted the liberal price of 1 to 2 about

first furlong by Dwight Way and re
tired. Dr. Shorb then looked a winner,
when Dug Martin with little Crosthwaite
â¢;p came along, reaching the wire first
by a long neck In 1;42. Dwight Way
was third.
Although only a short time off the
;rain from Seattle, Blissful, at odds of 6
to 5, made a show of the other three
starters in the sixth race, a six-furlong
sprint. St. Phillippina delayed the
Btart for many minutes and could not
run any after finally getting away.
Blissful raced Little Margaret to a
standstill the first three-eighths and gal

ball excepting in the seventh and ninth ln

Arrangements for the mammoth labor
carnival to take place at Central Park
for ten nlght3 beginning October 1 axe
being rapidly completed. Judging from
the reports of those who have the affair
in charge It will be the most successful
affair of its kind ever attempted in this
city. In addition to being a carnival it
will be in the nature of a country fair,
thus affording to those not interested in
the doings of the men of brawn 'an op
portunity to enjoy themselves after their
own fashion. There will be all sorts of
booths and sideshows. Altogether the
carnival promises to be unique as well
as instructing. â¢
The feature of the entire affair will be
the tug-of-war tournament that will be
held during the ten nights of the carni
val In the amphitheater recently erected
by the Spanish handball players. A plat
form, raised six feet from the ground and
In full view of every one of the 3000 spec
tators for whom seats are provided, has
been erected. Even at this early date It
is the scene of some might/ struggles be
tween the men of brawn and muscle, for
they are practicing nightly there and
conditioning themselves for the October
St Tha.t C the affair Is attracting . consider
able atetntion is shown by the fact that
there are already fifteen teams entered
for the tug-of-war tournamem. The men
who have been selected to pull for glory
and the large prizes that have been of
fered the best teams are all big, husky
fellows, skilled In the art of pulling upon
a rope Each team wants to carry off
the first prize, and the knowledge that
it will be something handsome Is spur
ring the men on.
Those who have seen the men at prac
tice recall the days when the internation
al tournament was held In this city and
the excitement that prevailed during that
time Mechanics' Pavilion was packed to
the doors every night by natives of Scot
land England, France, Greece, Ireland.
Italy, Wales, Norway, Sweden and this
Many "of the men who took part in that
tournament have signified their Intention
of entering the lists this time and are al
ready In training. It will be a case of
trade against trade, instead of flag
against flag, as was the case In the in
ternational tournament. Plasterers will
pull against teamsters, sailors against
longshoremen, machinists against plumb
ers and so on. The linemen, who are ex
pert wire-pullers, have entered a team,
and so have the ironworkers. â¢ They are
all hard-handed, hard-muscled sons : of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Messerly inaugurated the little "matinee
in the Cripples' half of the second round.
He led oft with a clean drive. Then Uncle
Peter responded with another, and so it
went down the line, every one taking a
swipe at one of Butler's best and send
ing the ball on a mad career to the iso
lated corners of the lot, where no waiting
fielder's mitt was ready to receive it.
When the bombardment at last came
to a close Mr. Butler was told to be seat
ed on the bench, and Mr. Thielman trot
ted out and got" busy on the firing line.
The little German was the goods for the
rest of the game. They only landed on
him four times and secured two runs,
one of which he allowed with a wild
pitch.
Meanwhile the "Red Dog," Mr. Brindle
Devereaux, was pitching some that the
Brownies could not solve, try as they
might. To be sure, they landed every
once in a while on ono of Bill's specials,
but never with force enough to do any
damage. In the fourth O'Hara and Mes
serly made a pair of errors. This allowed
a run. The only time the Brownies hit
Bill's offerings hard was during the pro
gress of the eighth, when three in a row
netted one more, the last for them.
After the came many of the generous
fans had a sort of meeting and decided
to throw Bill a few pieces of money in
recognition of the way he handled him
self during the stormy siege. So they
began to shower the coin from the stand
and Bill graciously accepted it He Is
richer bv J2 71.
Sam Morris, the Indian pitcher, will join
the Brownies this evenlnc and will make
his San Francisco bow in. Monday after
noon's game, pitching against Devereaux.

Umpire â Levy-
Such a walloping has not been equaled
here in a lone time. Every hit that
sounded and echoed through the expanse
of the lot was a clean one with that gen
uine baseball ring to it.
Big: Ike Butler was sent out on the
mound yesterday afternoon to baffle the
Cripples at Recreation Park. He bravely
took up the burden. Then the Cripples
took him up, mildly at first, but finally
with a determination that would drive
any slabster to the timbers. "When it
Â¦was all over the Cripples had amassed
bIx, and the game was theirs, though it
dragged along for seven more innings.

- The largest crowd of thÂ» week was
present at the San Rafael tennis courts
yesterday to witness the championship
match In men's doubles. One and all
went over to witness a thrilling match.
Consequently there was great disappoint
ment fjv-hen It was announced that owing
to the Illness of Grant Smith, one of the
contestants, a postponement would be
necessary.
Smith was too badly used up In his
match with Bell on the previous day to
play yesterday. Freeman and Bell could
have claimed the match and champion
ship by default, but declined to do so.
The match has been Bet for Tuesday af
ternoon, the final of the singles being
scheduled for to-morrow and the singles
championship for Wednesday.
In the morning the final of the women's

The doubles resulted in a victory for
Miss Gabriel Dobbins and Miss Florence

Berkeley In the final. The northern girls
made a much better showing than was
expected, the second set being JK7. In the
semi-flnal round the Misses May and
Violet Sutton, who held the championship,
defaulted to Miss Dobbins and Miss Flor
ence Sutton. The former were not pres
ent when their match was called.
In the mixed doubles play was com
pleted in one half down to the final and
in the other down to the semi-finals. In
the upper half Mrs. Seymour" and Louis
Freeman won a place in the final and will
meet the winners of the match between
Miss May Sutton and A. C. "Way and

Silvera was hauling wood on the
memorable afternoon of. July 27 when the
thirteen convicts suddenly pounced down
on him and made him drive them up the
road to Pilot Hill, where the battle took
place. In the wagon were the thirteen
convicts, the six guards and Silvera, who
drove the team, four horses comprising it.
"When the posses. Sheriffs and guards
arrived at Pilot Hill they attempted to
surround the convicts, but the escapes
ordered Silvera to drive them into the
timber adjacent. In order to stop that
move the posses shot the horses, killing
one instantly and wounding two others.
One was afterward killed by the guards
to put him out of his misery. It is for
the loss of these horses that Silvera put
in his claim.
Now Silvera is wondering where the
money is coming from to reimburse him
for his loss.
. When thirteen convicts escaped from
Folsom prison on July 27 they forcibly
took thÂ© team of Joseph F. Silvera and
appropriated it to their own use. Silvera
presented a claim for $C0O damages against
the Board of Prison Directors.
The case was submitted to the Attorney
General, who has advised the board that
there is no statute authorizing the pay
ment of such claims in this State and
that the State Board of Prison Directors
has no authority to pay the claim out of
any State funds or appropriations under
their control, nor has the State Board of
Examiners any authority to audit such
claims. -
of the appropriation was $39,500, leaving a
balance on hand of $2534 96. in addition to
stock on hand valued at $28 57.

BIRTHS AND DEATHS.
Colonel Irish, as president of the board
of trustees, said: "Mr. Mills' decision to
go has been known to the trustees for
several months. His work in this church
has been magnificent. By almost super
human effort he lifted the load of debt
from the church, and that has caused
him to be; in great demand elsewhere."
Mr. Mills did not obligate himself to
fulfill the ordinary routine of pastoral du
ties, and in March. 1902, feeling that the
church had reached a point where it was
necessary tor some one to do that work,
presented his resignation. Instead of ac
cepting it the church membership unani
mously requested Mr. Mills to remain.
They had an assistant pastor appointed,
but this did 1 not prove advantageous, and
since the assistant's departure Mr. Mills
has had in mind his final retirement. Mr.'
Mills has under consideration some pro
posals, the nature of which he is not
ready to make public.
"The relations between the church and
myself are of the most cordial charac
ter," said -Mr. Mills to-day. "My^retire
ment has been in mind for months. My
reasons are well known to the trustees,
and they are weighty enough to be suffi
cient. My mind is clear about my field of
work. I feel that the church is strongly
on its feet and that I can safely step out
at this time."
Four years ago Mr. Mills came to Oak
land from Boston. Seeking quiet and re
tirement he took a homo In the Piedmont
Hills. He was invited to supply for a
time the then vacant pulpit at the church
of which he later became minister.Â© Dur
ing his work he raised more than $25,000
outside of the Regular church expenses
and lifted the heavy burden of debt that
was upon the organization.
The retiring clergyman's letter will be
read to-morrow morning after services by
John P. Irish, president of the board of
trustees. Under the rules of the church
a meeting of the congregation will be
called to act on the letter. Mr. Mills an
nounced to-day that his decision to retire
was final.
The resignation has been contemplated
for six months and was placed In the
hands of a special committee of the
church board of trustees in August,
though three months i before that the
board was notified of Mr. Mills' Intention
to withdraw. '
The Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills has pre
sented his resignation as minister of the
First Unitarian Church, the resignation
to take effect October 15, the close of the
fourth year of Mr. Mills' service in that
field.
Oakland Office San Frandsco Call,
1118 Broadway. Sept. 5.
That the Improvements on protestant's land
consist entirely of dwelling houses and the
passing of trains would depreciate their value
and lessen their revenues.
That the proposed franchise contemplates the
running of a portion of the Santa Fe tracks
on Seventh street, which is already occupied
by the double tracks of the Southern Pacific
Company, and the proposed franchise would
completely destroy Seventh street as an artery
of communication.
That said franchise contemplates a steam
railroad catering Mariposa street at Iowa
street at a considerable angle and leaving Mari
posa street at a considerable angle at Pennsyl
vania avenue; that Mariposa Rtreet ] a a main
artery of traffic between the Mission and Po
trero and has been improved at a considerable
expense and the usefulness of the street as an
avenue of traffic will be seriously Impaired.
That the Board of Supervisors is without
power to grant the petition for the reason that
the franchise does not allow the Santa Fe
Company to enter the city with its road or to
run its cars to the water front, one of which
conditions must exist in order to authorize
the board named to grant a franchise to any
railroad company other than a street railroad
company.
EHzabeth Christy, owner of 20ft feet
frontage on the south side of Mariposa
street, between Pennsylvania avenue and
Mississippi street, filed with the Boaxd of
Supervisors yesterday a protest against
the granting of the petition of the Atchl
son, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Com
pany for a franchise to operate a steam
road along portions of Mariposa, Seventh,
Sixteenth and Hubbell streets. The

.When arrested , Pettingell had a bundle
of letters in his possession which plainly
show that he had not abandoned his Pa
cific Coast j scheme. One .of the letters,
addressed to David H. Moffat, the Utah
millionaire and partner, of Senator Clark
in several big enterprises, clearly outlines
Pettlnsell's business - methods In bis . at-
LETTERS TELL THE TALE.
It was a promising project until the
Board of Supervisors refused . to give, it
the privileges asked for. but even with
out" them the franchise across the neigh
boring counties and up to the line of this
county was valuable when united with
another franchise, such as the Monterey
and -Fresno road claimed. With these
two" franchises Pettlngell's scheme was
to have a railroad route from San Fran
cisco to Denver by way' of Monterey,
Fresno, the Minerat Pass and thence â¢ to
Pioche, Nev., where he contemplated
connecting with the Clark road. Having
made' some progress in his scheme, with
the assistance of Dr. : Flint, Pettlngell
swelled round town" for several weeks, in
terviewing various capitalists.' and then
disappeared. The next heard of him was
through the dispatch received yesterday
from Denver stating that he had been
arrested there.
Pettingell undertook to float the bonds
of that corporation In New York, but
claimed that just about the time he had
succeeded in his deal the promoters of
the road abandoned their plans. He and
an associate named Finley then brought
suit to recover a 10 per cent commission
on $7,000,000 worth of bonds, which they
were to have floated and in January last
a default judgment was taken In the New
York courts. It was immediately after
this judgment that Pettingell. accom
panied by two representatives of Eastern
banking concertis, landed In this city and
quietly registered at the Palace Hotel.
Although his traveling companions en
deavored to keep secret the purpose of
their visit, Pettingell, in three days' time,
had succeeded in widely advertising- their
presence as well as his own and then as
sumed a mysterious air that for a time
caused a great deal of speculation among
those who had got an inkling as to what
he was about. It later developed that
he had paid a visit to Dr. Flint's home
in San Juan and interested that gentle
man in a scheme to unite the franchise
of the Â¦ Monterey and Fresno Railway,
â¢which practically had been ceded to Pet
tlngell on hlu judgment, with that of
what is known as the Bay and Coast
Railway. The latter corporation was con
trolled by local capital and was originally
formed with a view of bringing a road
into San Francisco by way of Islais
Creek and securing terminal facilities in
the very center of the city.
HIS PROMISING PROJECT.'
FE. PETTINGELL of New York,
a railroad promoter, who has
"' been a familiar figure about
& the court of the Palace Hotel
during the last few months,
spent Tuesday, Wednesday and part of
Thursday behind the bars of the Denver
jail, to which he had been taken from
one of the leading hotels of that city on
suspicion of being a bqnko man. A num
ber of letters which he had addressed, to
wealthy residents of Denver, relative 'to
a railroad scheme with which he had
identified himself here, aroused the sus
picion of the police that he was trying to
get money on a swindling sctieme and he
was arrested. After inquiring into Pet
tingell's history, however, the police de
cided that they had no grounds for fur
ther holding their prisoner and he was re
leased on 'Thursday afternoon.
Pettingell is widely known throughout
the country, he having been identified
prominently with a number of big rail
road schemes. His recent arrival in this
city attracted considerable attention, for
he announced that he was about to effect
a deal which would result in furnishing a
new gateway for another transcontinental
road to San Francisco. The promoter had
been previously connected with the Mon
terey and Fresno road, a project in which
were interested a number of prominent
men, among them Dr. Thomas Flint of
San Juan, father of State Senator Flint.
AFTER BIG, COMMISSION.
Evidently Vice* President Kruttschnltt
did not think well of the project, for Pet
tingell continued to hawk it around
among those he thought might buy it.
In an Interview yesterday in Denver Pet
tingell said that he had asked Letter
$1,000,000 for the terminal option and he
added that he refused to even consider
"the small offer." Among other letters
in Pettlngell's bundle of communications
were two from G. Forgeus, the weil
known capitalist of Santa. Cruz, who had
seemingly become interested in the new
railroad scheme, but was not clearly sat
isfied with the proposition of bay facil
ities and- wrote to Pettlngell regarding
the matter. Forgeus also inclosed two
letters of -recommendation for PettingelL

E. H. HARRIMAN.
. E. H. Harriman, president of the South
ern Pacific Company, was also impor
tuned and sent the foldwing reply:
Having tried his game on Moffat with
out success, Pettlngell, as is shown by
several dispatches found among his let
ters, threw his bait to other millionaires,
among them Joseph Letter of Chicago,
who answered as follows:
F. E. Pettingell. Palace Hotel, San Fran
cisco: On ray return from Mexico to-day I
found your several telegrams. If you will re
member, I informed you that if you would give
me sufficient time to look Into the terminal

purchased at a price not exceeding $150,000.
otherwise not. At the price you quote it would

letter reads as follows:

you the Bay and Coast Railway Company's
franchise, granted by the city of San Francisco

miles of trackage on city streets.
- I now have a cash offer from several very
strong: financial interests who have formulated
plans for constructing a road from San Fran
cisco to Denver via Monterey, Madera, Fresno,

Lake road (W. A. Clark's road to Los Angeles),
thence east , to Marysville, Utah, to connect

With the Mrs. Donahue Incident still
fresh in their minds. Mrs. McNally and
her sister are naturally greatly alarmed
over the prospect of an encounter with
their brother, but they have made no ef
fort to comply with his demands for
money and have declared that they will
not do so. Yesterday Arthur McNally,
son of Mrs. McNally, greatly angered by
the annoyance given to his aged mother,
spent the greater portion of the afternoon
In a hunt for Hawkins in the business
part of the city, which the last named is
in the habit of frequenting. It was tha
intention of the young man, in the event
of meeting Hawkins, to give him a
thrashing and warn him that another vis
it to his mother's home would be attended
with more serious treatment. Fortunate
ly for Hawkins, however, he failed to
meet McNally during the afternoon and
escaped the punishment that was in store
for him.
Michael J. Hawkins, who was arrested
several years ago on a charge of trying
to kill the late Mrs. Annie Donahue, wid
ow of Peter Donahue, while she was seat
ed in her carriage on Montgomery street.
is now charged with sending threatening
letters to his sister. Mrs. Lawrence Mc-
Nally, a widow, who resides with her sis
ter and son at 639 Greenwich street
For several nights the jJcNally home has
been tightly barricaded by its frightened
female occupants, who fear that Haw
kins is planning some harm to Mrs. Mc-
Nally and might gain an entrance to tha
house.
The McNallys and Hawkinses have not
been on the best of terms for soma
months, a condition of affairs which
friends of the women attribute to Haw
kins' disappointment in money matters
and especially to the fact that when a
sister, the late Mrs. English, widow ot
J. M. English, died some time ago, she
bequeathed what little property she had
to Mrs. McNally and ignored Hawkins.
It Is charged by the McNallys that on
several occasions lately at night the door
bell of the Greenwich residence has been
rung and that the occupants of the house
have opened the door Just in. time to sea
the form of Hawkins disappearing in tha
distance. On the door sill have been
found letters signed by Hawkins and ad
dressed to his sister. Mrs. McNally. in
which he has reviewed in a rambling
manner his imaginary grievances and has
concluded the missives with the threaten
ing statement that If he was not fur
nished with $300 by September 7 he "would
do something."

This: is the second appearance of Mrs.
Foise In the divorce court, and also the
second appearance of Foise. She was di
vorced from Anton A. Stoibel in this
city jj in November, 1900, and Poise was
divorced from Martha Foise in New York
inlS99. â¢ He came to this city in the early
part of; the present year, and on June 30
called at the Mayor's office and demanded
protection from fancied pursuers. He
was arrested by Officer Williams and the
next day committed to the asylum for
the: insane by Insanity Commissioners
McGettigan and Rethers. From testimony
gathered, at his hearing on the Insanity
charge K developed that he had once been
confined in an asylum In England.
Lee H. Foise, who on June 30
last visited the Mayor's office and de
manded protection from hordes of" men,
women and children he fancied were pur
suing him through the streets for the
purpose of taking his life, was married
to Elizabeth H. Stoibel of this city Just
seventeen davs before his visit to tho
Mayor. This fact becama known yes
terday through the filing of a complaint
for divorce against Foise. The unfor
tunate woman brings the suit on the
ground of cruelty, alleging that during
the three days she lived with Foise he
treated her In such a manner that she
came to the conclusion that if she re
mained ! longer with him her life would
be endangered. They were married on
June 13. He woke her out of a sound
sleep at 3 o'clock the next moraine and
said he would "beat the life out of her."
Two . days afterward he proceeded to do
as he had promised, but was prevented.
On the 16th he tried it again, but she
ran away from him and never returned.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Sept. B.-News of
a murder Just east of the British Colum
bia boundary line In Alberta has been tel
egraphed to the Vancouver police depart
ment, and officers all over the coast are
now on the lookout for the alleged mur
derer.
Four weeks ago two German Bettlers
went from MacLeod and reached a place
called Stand Off, about twenty miles west
of there. They had some money, a fairly
good outfit to start ranching, a team of
horses and a big wagon. They started
out for some new land, and It was the
last seen of the two men. Ten days ago
one man was seen traveling westward
with the wagon and outfit. His partner
was nowhere in sight.
Another party of settlers came in ! a
day or two later with the information
that they had found the body of a mur
dered man. Mounted police constables
made investigation, with the result that
the body of the other German was found
with a piece of canvas wrapped around
it. The man had apparently been killed
with an ax and what money he had was
evidentaly taken, for nothing of any value
was found in the pockets of his clothing.
A fragment of a newspaper printed in
German and dated at Portland, Ore., was
found near by.
Judge Fritz issued a warrant yesterday

of the police and will be retained as a
vitness in the prospective trial. He has
not been placed in custody nor will he
be unless there are some developments
â¢which may place him In a bad position
in respect to the Bowers murder.
Chief of Police Wiuman received the
statement of Mrs. D. D. McCallum from
Chief of Police Hunt of Portland, Or.,
yesterday. The woman said that Mrs.
Bowers was afraid that her husband
would become cognizar.* of the fact that
the was keeping: company with Lervey;
that Bowers was angry when he came
home from Mare Island to find his wife's
paramour in the house, but that there
Â¦kzs no fight, as has been frequently re
ported. The police are still inclined to
believe that the men had a struggle on
that occasion.
The authorities feel that the evidence

Jlrs. Button with the murder Is strong
enough to secure a conviction, but they
are searching for more Information whicn
would make It clear that the deceased's
v.-ife was anxious to^bave her husband

PERSONAL MENTION.
A. W. Haight is the name of the man
who was held up at Bush and Polk streets
about midnight. He is a clerk and lives
at 611 Polk street. He was on his way
home, when he was accosted by two
masked men. One pointed a revolver sit
his head, while the other searched his
clothing. They took $40 in coin, but left
him his watch. They cautioned him to
proceed on his way without making any
outcry. This he did until he met a po
liceman, with whom he returned to the
scene of the robbery, but by this time the
footpads had disappeared.
Notwithstanding the discrepancies in
the descriptions given by those held up
in the park the police believe it was all
the work. of one man. The different de
scriptions are accounted for by the ex
cited condition of the victims.
They were then ordered to proceed and
not to look back. They hurried to the
Stanyan-street station and reported the
robbery. They described the robber as
about six feet tall and having a promi
nent nose. Mounted policemen were sent
out at once to watch the paths, but could
get no trace of the footDad.
An hour later Miss O. Briggs, who lives
at ,420 Tehama street, with two other
women and four small boys, was riding
through the park. When passing the old
'49 camp a man stepped from behind a
tree- and, pointing a revolver at them,
told them to give up their money. They
said they had no money and he let them
go, cautioning them not to look around.
They describe the footpad as being short
and wearing a slouch hat, a sack coat
and a mask.
So far as has been reported to the po
lice, ten persons in all were the victims
of footpads Friday night, as published
exclusively in yesterday's Call. Nine of
these were held up in the park and the
other was stopped at Bush and Polk
streets and made to deliver.
The first hold-up occurred about 8
o'clock, when E. K. Stanton and his
brother were walking along the main road
to the conservatory in the park. They
were suddenly accosted by a masked
man. with a revolver in his hand, who
emerged from the shrubbery lining the
road. He gruffly ordered them to throw
up their hands and made them empty
their pockets of all the money they had,
which amounted to $2 50.

Let us remember, however, that the higher
formi of culture cannot best endure save where
the reneral forms of culture and education
are widespread. It is cne of the functions of
the public school service . to spread wide thÂ«
spirit and the forms of education and culture.
And so, ecmÂ« day, San Francisco must sus
tain a public school system which shall be
worthy cf rank with its industry and rnuElc,
Its commerce and its art. Meanwhile in our
enthusiasm for the future let us be "about
and doing." The future is made up of Just
euch hours as we are Jiving now. and the deeds
cf the future are but those we can now do.
Do you realize that then- is growinp up on
thle Western coas=t a pecor.d new civilization,
a new center of trade an<i culture which is to
be more profoundly American than that on the
Eastern seaboard? Already tfure are PigiM! cf
our quickening development. Our commerce
and manufacture*, the bMla of our new
growth, are already swinging forward with
majestic strides. In this San Francisco has
taken and must maintain the lead. The great
est city of the Far West, it muFt rise to the
responsibilities Vl leading in culture and edu
cation as it leads In industry and trade. Sep
arated from "the great centers of American cul
ture. Industry and life upon the Atlantic by
vast stretch.-s cf territory, lofty mountain bar
riers and wide stretching plains, we must be
always largely dependent upon ourselves. Here
ehall rise a Becond great American civiliza
tion. In matters of industry this seems al
ready assured. In matters of culture there are
many assuring signs. In the field of letters
Wtstera men and women â liarte. Twain,
ilarkham, N orris and London â have spoken
Â¦with certain voices; in music our people have
risen to be the most appreciative In the na
tion, itascagni end Kcheel, Gadski and Eair.es,
find a welcome here that no other place of
proportionate size can boast. In art the West
ern echool ha* made Ju mark. Keith and
Hill. Peters. Matthews and others have pio
neered in our favor. In scholarship two great
universities lead the vay to research and
truth. We nave but to grow as we are grow
ing and the future leadership of Â£an Francisco
Is eaie.
THE CENTER OF CULTURE.
We are behind and must catch up. The city I
Is growing t-o fast that if we do not catch up j
eoon we never will, for this year alone there '
has been an increase of alrriort 0000 census chll- I
Cren. We cannot properly take care of those j
we have, how shall we take caie of the In- |
crea*e? Then the last school census rtrmrts i
showed that there are in this city almost iO.000 :
census children who attended no school, public '
or private, during the past year. The last L^g. I
Ulature passed a compulsory school law which j
we .mutt Â«>oon enloroe. We cannot properly â¢
take care cf these children who are willing tu i
attfnd school; how shall we care for thoÂ«e who I
ought to be compelled to attend T Nothing less ;
than something strenuous can relieve our situa- j
tion. and that is the strenuous Fupport of the j
echool bonds at the coming election by all who '
cave a deep concern in the schools.
When you have given children healthy quar- ]
terÂ», with conditions conducive to comfort and '
inspiration ana work, you have laid the fcunda- i
tion for a pood s- hool system. You cannoi I
make over the natural and eocial atmosphere In
â¢which a child lives, but you can make his arti- !
flcial and human environment what it ought to I
be. Give the child beautiful and comfortable I
buildings and grounds designed fcr his health
and the cultivation of h!s finer sensibilities and I
you make his artificial environment a powerful
but unconscious influence for good as against
t^tatiEtics compiled from the latest available
reports show that ihce ip more overcrowding
in San Francisco than anywhere else. The av
erage number of children belonging to a single
teacher in San Francisco Is over forty-six In
tlie largest cjtiea of the United States, where
the evils of overcrowding are likely to be great
et-t. it is much less. No teacher can do justice
to primary- children with more than a maximum
3f forty children, while tho maximum for gram
mar grades ehouid be forty-five.
Aa interesting 1 lecture was delivered
yesterday afternoon by Superintendent of
Public Schools William H. Langdon to
tho members of the local Council of
Women's Clubs In the assembly hall of
the Century Club. The subject of his lec
ture was "The Future Development of
Our Public School System." He said, in
part:
The schools of the city of 5an Francisco have
not been iui'i are not what they ought to be. It
Is not our ! u.i.:.t .-.- to encage la rancorous dis
. .'.-:-.Â¦ :. as to the responsibility (or this condi
tion, or to engage in controversy as to the par
ticular causes v. j:; v <i have left us where we are.
It is your business and mine as your official
representative to take things as they are and
lilt them tu a higrh level, one commensurate
with cur rank aÂ«s the greatest city in the far
\Vett. Beiore tills can be done, we must learn
;.'!â¢- lessen < ' patience, lor a great work take*
tears for it* accomplishment. The school de
partment cannot be brought to the state that
we desire in two or three years â it will require
eight or ten years of conblstent working toward
a definite ideal. We must firet study our prob
lems, long and patiently, and then Fet for our
selves the best known educational ideals that
*,'.'. :.t our pecuhar situation, and then we must
be content to gain irround slowly and eteadily â
an Inch a year until our mile is measured off.
Then our work will have been well done â and
the superstructure that those who follow will
build will have a sound foundation. We want
your co-operation, but we want that }cu ehall
6tudy aad work with us patiently, for this is na
simple problem. If any one offers you a pimple
solution, be timid of accepting it. It Is a good
working principle to beware of any simple rem
edy for & great social problem. If you would
Â¦work with us content to improve some Flight
ihirg each month or year and to Influence pub
lic opinion to support the public school more
liberally we con, together, overcome every dif-
Oculty.
BETTEB BUILDINGS NEEDED.
One of the first things we need is a system
of modern, well equipped school buildings to
relieve congestion. Nothing less than a large
bond issue will do. for Bail Francisco has the
worst school equipment of ail the important
cities in the United States. Outside of two
brick high fechool building?, San K-ancisco hat
not a substantial end presentable building. The
elementary schools are miserably cared for.
Children are crowded together in a way not to
be found in other advanced centers of civiliza
tion in these United States.

The wonderful power of Iiydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound over the diseases^ of T*omairÂ»
kind is not because it is a stimulant, â not because it is a palliative, but simply because it is the most
wonderful tonic and reconstructor ever discovered to act directly upon the whole .uterine system, positively
CURING disease and restoring health and vigor. v w
Marvelous cures are reported from all parts of the country by women who have been cured, trained
nurses who have witnessed cures, and physicians who have recognized the^ virtue in X-ydia XL
Pinkham's "Vegetable Compound and are fair enough to give credit where it is due.
One of Many Women Cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compoundr
Without Submitting to an Operation, Writes: â
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham ; â I was a great sufferer for three years, had some of the leading physicians,
and they all said nothing but an operation would cure me, but to that I would not submit.
" I picked up a paper and saw your advertisement and made up mjr .mind to try your medicine. I
had falling and inflammation of the womb and a flow of whites all the time, pains across small of back,
severe headache, did not know what it was to be without a pain or an ache until I used your medicine.
After three months' use of it, I felt like a new woman. I still sound the praise of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound."â Mrs. Wat A. Cowan, 1804 Bainbridgo St., Philadelphia, Pa.
A Graduate Nurse, Convinced by Cures, Endorses Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. She Writes: â
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â Ministering to the sick I have had numerous chances to compare Iiydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound with other medicines in cases of diseases of Â¦women, and tho
number of cures recorded where your medicine was used convinced me that it is the safest and surest
medicine for a sick woman. Doctors certainly niust know the value of Iiydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. I am convinced that you deserve the splendid record you have made. â Yours very truly,
Mrs. Catherine Jackson, 769 Beaubien St., Detroit, Mich." (Graduate Nurse and President Detroit
Emergency Association.) \
Many Physicians Admit that no Medicine Known to the Profession Equals
Lydia E. Pinkham's Compound for the Cure of Woman's Ills,
and We are Permitted to Publish the Following: â
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â It gives me great pleasure to state that I have found Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound very efficacious, and have often prescribed it for female difficulties.
"My oldest daughter found it very beneficial for uterine trouble some two years ago, and my youngest
daughter is using it for. female weakness, and as a tonic, and is slowly but surely gaining strength and health.
" I freely advocate it as a most reliable specific in all disorders which women are reject to, and give it
honest endorsement. â Yours very truly, Sarah C. Brioham, M.D., 4 Brigham Park, Fi burg, Mass.
If physicians dared to be frank and open, hundreds of them would acknowledge that they constantly
prescribe Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound in severe cases of female ills, as they know by
experience that it can be relied upon to effect a cure.
Women who are troubled with painful or irregular menstruation, backache, bloating (or flatulence),
leucorrhcea, falling, inflammation or ulceration of the uterus, ovarian troubles, that " bearing-down " feeling,
dizziness, faintness, indigestion, nervous prostration or the blues, should take immediate action to ward off
the serious consequences, and be restored to perfect health and strength by taking Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, and then write to Mra. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for further free advice. No liv?*.g
person has had such a vast and successful experience in treating female ills. She has guided thousanda to
oifeith. Everv sufferina: woman should aÂ«K for and follow her advice.

â¢car; permaaeacy guaranteed; Hours 1 w 4 p,oÂ»The executive office of the United
States calls for only $112,000 a year,
while England gives the royal family
S4.000.000.
This entire advertising plan Is being carried
out by Barnard & Swasey. the largest firm In
the West In the management, designing, writ-
Ing and placing of advertising. The whole
idea of the style and method of campaign was
originated by this firm and immediately ac
cepted by Grommes & Ullrich.
Grommes & Ullrich are known throughout
America as one of the oldest and most reliable
distilling firms, who have built up their huge
business by their unflinching integrity and en
terprising methods, of which this advertising
campaign is but another example.
These Illustrations are done by a renowned
poster and scenic artist, and promise to be
something far above the usual run of advertis
ing art. Advertising of such great historical
and biographical value has never been at
tempted before on the Pacific Coast, and can
not fail to arouse the greatest educational in
terest and be highly appreciated along that
line.
Every phase of the romantic life of th's he
roic pioneer will be representedâ his departure
from the Canadian missions to discover and
explore the Mississippi; his Journey to iÂ»ach
that river, and many # other events In Mar
quette's life will appear in these pictures.
A very Interesting and Instructive advertis
ing campaign will shortly be placed before
the people of. San Francisco.
Grommes & Ullrich of Chicago, distillers of
Marquette Whiskey â the purest and costliest
whisky made â will pUce in the newspapers,
street cars and upon the billboards beautifully
executed and highly artistic Illustrations of
the lite and adventures of Pere Marquette,
the famous explorer and discoverer after whom
their whisky Is named. "
A Unique Advertising Campaign.
Rhoda Royal's sixty-one-horse act,
Pearl Souder's three groups of perform
ing elephants and Captain Webb's two
troupes of educated seals are examples of
animal training thai have never been
equaled and constitute In themselves
priceless features of attraction in this
enormous show. Seats for any ' of the
performances may be bought at Sherman
& Clay's for exactly the same price
charged at the wagons on the show
grounds.
The parade was postponed from Mon
day to Tuesday on account of the Labor
day procession. The first performance
â¢will be given Monday afternoon. Sunday
all the show tents but tlie menagerie will
be open to the public.
The big circus parade Tuesday morning
will start from the show grounds at
Eleventh and Market streets promptly_at
9 o'clock and move as follows: To
Howard, to Second, to Market, to Mont
gomery, to California, to Kearny, to Mar
ket and thence to ehow grounds.
SIXTY-ONE HORSE ACT.
There are more than 300 acts in the
arenlc bill and the performers are gath
ered from the four corners of the earth.
Among the far-famed in their different
way are the Dollard troupe, the Nelson
family, the Fortune brothers, the Rios,
the St. Leon family, the Tybell sisters,
the Leon sisters, the flying Fishers, the
Potter family and the Alvo trio. Among
the accomplished horsemen and horse
women are John Rooney, Mike Rooney,
Rhoda Royal, Reno McCree, Albert Cran
dall, the Hobsons, Dolly Julian, May
Davenport, Ida Mlaco, Daisy Leon and
too many more to mention here.
The little baby elephant, "Baby Boo."
will be left at home, as will the little
baby dromedary and the other Infant
mites of wild animal nature. This nur
sery department Is one of the great at
tractions of the big show.
In a dramatic spectacle, called "Jeru
salem and the Crusades," Ringling Bros,
bring forward a distinct circus novelty.
Pageants and ballet spectacles have been
seen before under circus canvas. This is
the first time, however, that the scenic
appointments of a theater have been used
to tell a story- Twelve hundred chai^
acters, 200 choristers, 200 dancing girls,
2000 costumes, Bpeclal scenery, electrical
and calcium effects and original music
signify the importance of this feature.
This novelty will take up about thirty
minutes of time and precedes the circus
programme proper.
INFANTS OV THE JUNGLE.
Most of the animal dens will be open.
Fashionable traps, crack military com
panies, typifying foreign nations; a herd
of elephants, gayly gowned women riders,
smart malt* whips, a mounted military
band, a hair-lifting clown band, all sorts
of "Merry Andrews," forty plodding ele
phants, meekly marching camels, and %
lot of other oddities of more or less Inter
est, If not actual fascination, will be in
dividual items in the three-mile display
of circus glories.
Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock the big
street pageant will leave the shov(
grounds and wend its way through the
principal tfowntown streets. This display
of Ringling Bros, is worth going a long
way to see, for it is not only longer, but
it comprises more attractive features
than were ever woven into an affair of
this kind before. Besides the hundred
and one things peculiar to such exhibi
tions, there is a host of novelties which
separate this firm from all others for en
terprise and ingenuity. There will be,
twenty-five tableau floats, gorgeous
structures of cost and color, upon which
will be grouped typical figures in familiar
scenes from the important nations of the
earth. >
Earjy this morning the long circus
trains of Ringling Bros, will cross the bay
and the great army of show people will
quickly go into camp at Eleventh and
Market streets. It takes more than four
score of cars, most of them double
length, to haul the great enterprise from
place to place. The circus is to be here
eight days, beginning- Monday, and per
formances will be given afternoon and
evening at 2 and 8 o'clock.

The California Redwood Lumber Asso
ciation has Informed the commissioners
to St. Louis that all the companies repre
sented In the redwood lumber combine
will co-operate to make up a great.show
ing of redwood. Among the big things
reported at yesterday's meeting of the
St. Louis commissioners was a sea bass
weighing 450 pounds that was caught off
the coast of Southern California.
Wiggins told then of the offer of the.
Southern California Citrus Fruit Agency
to provide a sufficient quantity of citrus
fruits by the carload to keep up the rep
utation of California In great shape, and
Commissioner Fllcher said that the north
ern counties would also provide citrus
fruits In great quantities.
A display of California npples will be
made at St. Louis that will rival those
of even Illinois, Ohio and all other apple
producing States that have made reputa
tions In that line. This will undoubted
ly be a cause of surprise to the country
at large. California's show will Include
practically everything that Is raised In
any part of the world having a temper
ate climate and will also exhibit an ag
gregation of specialties in soil products
that cannot elsewhere be duplicated. In
the apple display southern and northern
counties will alike be represented largely.
The California commissioners to the St.
Louis Exposition held an important meet-
Ing In this city yesterday. They decided
definitely that the California building at
St.. Louis must be completed and the keys
In the possession of the commissioners by
January 1 next. Atter some delay the
specifications have been sent on for final
approval of the exposition authorities.
An answer by wire, as to whether they
are entirely satisfactory had been re
quested. The outlook is good that the
contract for bids for construction of the
building will be advertised within the
next fortnight. The time that it will take
to build Is estimated at about thirty days
by Commissioners Fllcher and Wiggins.
Announcements were made at yesterday's
meeting of great interest to the State.
One was that the forestry, agriculture
and horticulture exhibits of the State at
St. Louis will surpass any ever made at
any world's fair. This has been deter
mined to be the fact by the returns al
ready made and by comparison with what
has been done at other times. It was
also announced that the biggest collection
of Pacific Coast fish up to date has been
secured. A great show at St. Louis In
behalf of California is assured ' in the
lines of education and arts.
Southern California comes to the front
with a huge walnut elephant to illustrate
the .walnut growing Industry of the State.
This elephant will be thirteen feet high
and will weigh about two tons. When
Commissioner Filcher heard of this he re
ported a gigantic cheese that will be pro
vided to indicate the dairy Industry of
the northern part of the State. This enor
mous cheese would cut up into enough
cheese sandwiches to furnish the entire
attendance for a day at St. Louis. Fll
cher confessed with evident pride that
the cheese will weigh one ton.

There was hardly ever a programme
presented in this city so varied in char
acter and yet so choice in artistic qual
ity as those to be given at the two pop
ular concerts under the direction of Fritz
Scheel at the Mechanics' Pavilion next
Monday and Wednesday afternoons. The
desire to listen to good music is present
in the heart of every man, woman and
child who has the least bit of sentiment
in his or her composition and If a man
is able to play on these sentiments as
if they were ever so many keys of a great
Instrument it Is Scheel. who has the taste
of the public at his finger ends. There
fore it is not unlikely that the pavilion
will be crowded on these occasions with
a happy crowd, who will forget for the
time being the troubles and tribulations
of every day life.

"It Is in the first place our duty to

the production of 'Parsifal' In America

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Sept. 5.
A fearful father arrived at the County
Clerk's office this morning just in time
to niD in the bud the marriage of his
16-year-old daughter. Re visited the of
fice to Inform the Clerk that Cornelius
R. Sweeney would in all probability ap
ply to him for a license to marry Frances
C. Otis, and that she was but 16 years
of age, and that he, as her father, ob
jected to the marriage.
Otis pere had hardly left when young
Sweeney arrived on the scene all uncon
scious of what was awaiting him. He
asked for a marriage license and the
Clerk wrote his name in the book, then
he gave his prospective bride's name and
her age as IS and past. Clerk Henley
spoke up and said: "Why, her father
was in here Just now and said that she
was but sixteen.*"
The young man was sorrowful, but said
that he would come back in the after
noon with the written consent of the girl's
mother. Young Sweeney said:
"It's only the father who is making all
the trouble. He stopped us at San Fran
cisco, anct San Rafael, and now, here. I
have to so to Los Angeles and we must
be married so that we can go together.
You leave the page as it is and I will
come back."
The Clerk Is still waiting, for Sweeney
failed to keep his promise.
The argument necessitated a review of
all the proceedings In the case and the
filing of the papers and orders made by
the court. An error In the proceedings
was unearthed and admitted by Judge
Ogden, but the time for its correction, he
held, had gone by. Delmas occupied most
of the day.
Apparently the matter was in the bal
ance up to the final rendering of the de
cision by the court and attracted the at
tention of the legal fraternity about the
Courthouse. Judge Ogden's decision in
effect was that, although a judgment had
been rendered, it was not a judgment on
the merits of the case, and that while
such a judgment should not have been
rendered, it having been given at the re
quest of the plaintiff in the case, without
prejudice, she was now entitled to begin
her action anew and have its merits
passed upon.
A former suit commenced in the case
had been dismissed without prejudice
after a demurrer with leave to amend
had been sustained. That was in a nut
'Bhell the basis of to-day's arguments. |
After a battle royal to-day between At
torneys D. M. Delmas and A. A. Moore
In an argument lasting all day, Delmas
won his right to maintain the suit of Ger
trude Johnson against the Southern Pa
cific Company for $25,000 damages, which
she alleges she sustained by being thrown
from the step of a car at Nlles by its
moving forward without warning.
The case has been "on for several days
and the evidence for the girl has been
presented to the jury. The railroad be
gan its defense this morning and Attorney
Moore started -what would have been a
fatal blow to his adversary had his con
tention been upheld. He moved to have
the case dismissed upon the ground that
a Judgment had already been rendered
and that the plaintiff was barred from
further action.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118^Broadway, Sept. 5.
Despite the fact that the earth was
gravelly and very loose, ; no braces of
limber h.id been placed against the em
bankment and an additional element of
Uanger was created by tiie fact that the
top of the bank was used as a dumping
p'.ace for bricks. The workmen thus were
tixtecn feet below the tor> of the bank in
a hole that was like a. huge grave without
means of exit more than by a ladder.
About 3 o'clock this afternoon a wagon
load of brick was dumped at the very
rdge ct the bank and this caused a sec
tion of it to fall off and completely fill
the trench, burying the men under nearly
ten feet of earth. Bunch was leaving the
liole at the tim*? and thus escaped the
fate of his fellow laborers.
Within a minute after the accident
scores of men summoned from other
parts of the work, were digging away
the fallen earth in the effort to rescue
the men. Jcssoy's body was reached in
half an hour and a faint beating of the
heart was detected. A physician was at
hand and administered a. ftimulant, but
â¢while he was working with him the man
Â«3ied. Two hours' work was required to
reach the bodies of the other two men.
Thf-y were found one above the other.
The Coroner ordered a rig-id investiga
tion into the absence of braces.
The men were working in made ground
and had excavated the entire lot to the
level of the sidewalk, leaving an eight
foot embankment on the north side of the
cleared portion. Along the edge of this
a trerich three feet wide and thirty feet
long had been dug to a depth of eight
feet, it being necessary to go through the
made ground in order to secure a firm
resting place for the foundations.
LOS AN'GELES. Sept. 5.â By the caving
of a sixteen-foot embankment which tow
ered over an excavation being made for
the foundations of a new hotel at Sixth
and San Joasuin streets and against
which the contractor had failed to place
supports, three lives were crushed out this
afternoon and a fourth man narrowly es
caped a similar fate. All of the victims
were laborers. The dÂ»ad are:
MIKE JESSEY. aged 42: unmarried;
lower portion of body crushed.
JOHN CRANSE. aged 2S; unmarried;
neck broken and ribs crushed.
. SABIN, aged 40; Mexican; suffo
cated.
The only man who escaped from the
trench in which the men were working Is
John Bunch (colored). He paw the em
bankment falling in on him and his com
panions and sprang toward the top, but
too late to escape all of it. His body was
covered, but his head etuck out. He was
quickly rescued, but was severely injured
about the lower portion of the body and
the legs.
f iwel&l Dispatch to The Call.
In this city Henry Phlpps has de
clared that he will not turn another
stone except where operations have al
ready been started. The delay in the
extensive improvements contemplated
by H. C. Frick has been stated to be
due entirely to the unreliable state of
the labor field and a similar condition is
said to exist with the II. W. Oliver im
provements, not already begun.
Information given out shows that in
New York alone there is at least $60.
000,000 of new building for 1904 involved
in the general plan of withdrawal. In
Chicago, where the labor troubles have
been continuous for months, it is said
that more than $70,000,000 of new work
has been abandoned.
It Is also said by the same authority
that so far as known there will be noth
ing in the shape of new work undertaken
the coming year and when the present'
contracts are completed a period of wait
ing will ensue. It will be a waiting for
the general labor situation to settle down
and thÂ« end of the factional wars and
strikes that have almost destroyed con
fidence In buildine. The same informa
tion is that the Pennsylvania Railroad,
which now has enough improvements un
der way and contemplated at least as
much more, or $50,000,000 during 1904, has
decided to withdraw all of these plans
and do nothing further with them until
there is a more placid condition of the la
bor market.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Sept. 5.â The Post
to-morrow will 6ay: According to well
matured plans, not only of the great rail
road corporations of the country, but of
â¢the larger investors of capital in building
operations, there is likely to be a general
cessation of building operations during
1904, which will make that year memor
able to the trades interested. The state
ment of one of the largest contracting
concerns in the country connected with
railroad construction work is the basis
for the assertion that at least JISO.OOO.OOO
worth of building operations proposed for
1S04 have actually been called off and
plans have been recalled from architects
and engineers.
After the Mayor had requested that all
of the protests made in Oakland be in
corporated as originally filed, the session
adjourned. The Harbor Board, it is be
lieved from the trend of the engineers'
remarks to-day, will pive favorable re
port on the company's petition to the
Secretary of War when the documents
are forwarded to that official. It is
thought that the 500-foot channel instead
of the 200-foot Inlet will be recommended.
A. D. Shephard, for the Oakland Water
Front Company, opposed the filling at the
estuary arm, but wanted to know wheth
er the Mayor would agree to a compro
mise with the railroad people by which a
channel BOO feet wide should be left.
Mayor Olney replied that he stood op
posed to any reduction of the width at
all.
J. H. Wallace, engineer of the main
tenance and way department of the
Southern Pacific Company, said # his com
pany would erect drawbridges across the
channel if the fill were made.
The Mayor said the reduction of the
width of the tide channel *is proposed by
the building of the embankments at the
trestles would cause a rapid shoaling In
the East Oakland basin, east of the
drawbridges, and would retard harbor
improvements. He was unalterably op
posed to any proposition that would mean
injury to any of the city's holdings along
the north arm.
Mayor Warren Olney made a strong
protest to-day before the United States
Board of Harbor Line Engineers against
the granting of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's application to fill all but 2C0 feet
of its First and Seventh street railroad
trestles across the north arm of the estu
ary. His Honor declared that to change
the pierhead and bulkhead lines as con
templated would encroach upon the 1600
feet of frontage along the north arm,
would impair the tidal flow into Lake
Merritt and would be a taking of mu
nicipal property. He strongly objected to
the proposed embankments on each side
of the estuary, which he claimed would
be permanent obstructions.
Colonel H. H. Heuer, a member of the
board, contended that the north arm of
the estuary should not have been Includ
ed in the harbor boundaries. This remark
raised the Mayor's ire and he vigorously
combated it. N .

Since the Southern Pacific Company,
through General Manager Julius Krutt

offered by the municipal legislators, there
Is an Inclination on the part of three
members of the Board of City Trustees-
President J. F. Forderer, . B. E. Combs
and C. J. Hammondâ to submit the mat
ter of the disposition of the franchises to
the voters. The ordinances granting the
Southern Pacific the franchises for twen
ty-five years will come up for thÂ© second
reading 1 at the meeting of the City Trus
tees Tuesday night, but In view of the
stand taken by the corporation It is not
likely that any decisive action will be
taken.

Conditions and prices In tbe Potato market
showed no change from the previous report
Supplies were ample and trade was moderately
active under a fair demand for local con
sumption and shipping account. Offerings of
Sweet Potatoes were less liberal than on the
preceding day, but there was enough on hand
to satisfy the demand and prices were un
changed. Onions were steady for choice stock,
while second quality offerings dragged.
There was an abundance of most descrip
tions of vegetables and prices of all kinds
excepting Green Corn and bay Tomatoes stood
as orevlously quoted. There waa a marked
falling of! in tbe receipts of Tomatoes and the
market cleaned up well under a steady de
mand. The canners were offering SOc per box
for the lower cradeg of bay, out were unable
to procure any at that figure. Receipts of
Corn were light and as trashy stock was well
cleaned up prices ranged higher. The pre
vious low prices have checked the movement
somewhat and growers ore not sending poor
stock to market. Pickle Cucumbers arrived
freely and cleaned up quickly under a good
demand f Aim packers.

The week was cool throughout and the long
dry fpell wa? broken by several showery days.
In" the eastern smt^n the copious rains were
on the 25th and 2Cth. on which dates more
than an inch of rain occurred in many local-
Ifcs The rains interrupted harvesting and
thrashing, thus delaying those operations sev
eral -lays, ar.d slightly injured wheat In eomÂ«
lo'-allties. but the benefits from the rains far
outw.ightd the trifling damage. Late spring
grain, which was in danger of 'â¢burning '
ir< m th* hot winds, was Baved from Injury,
and Fugar beets and late vegetables werÂ»
pr^atly benefited. But the best results were
the revivin* cf pastures and the soaking up
of the ground for fall plowing. The soil has
boen put in much better condition for plowing
than it was, but more rain is needed for the
purpose.
ronfiderablp Fprir^; wheat remains to be
cut The harvest is about two-thirds over in
rt-Â» late localities. All reports received con
f.rra the ert.irr.ates of the wheat crop, accord
ing to locality and cultivation, of from half
the average yield to somewhat below average.
B-d quality the very best- Oats have nearly
all b*en harvested and the yield was good.
Potatoes continue to thrive, although there
are sonse reports of blight. On the whole the
ix-.tato crop promises to be. an excellent one.
H"ps which at one time looked very un
maMxm have greatly Improved. The ship
ment cf large quantities of fine fruit continue
from th<Â» irrigated districts, and the third cut
ting of a good crop cf alfalfa has been secured
in fine condition.

The local demand for fruits, which is gen
erally brisk on Saturday, was confined chiefly
to fancy stock, thl demand for second quality
offerings being very light. Firmer prices pre
vailed for Barflett Pears, which wero in lim
ited supcly. and fine Peaches were bteady at
previous prices. The canners cleaned up bulk
lots of Clingstones and Salways at the pre
viously quoted rates and sales were reported
In a small way at $27 50 per ton. Receipts
of Plums and Prunes in bulk consisted entirely
of email quantities, which found prompt sale
at previous prices. Offerings in small boxes
and crates were steady under moderate re
ceipts. Strictly fancy Bellflower and Graven
stein Apples in 4-tier boxes were in good
demand at $1@1 10 per box, but t>mall and
wormy stock was In excessive sub ply and
dragged at unsteady rates. Quinces and Pome
granates were offering freely at e.isy prices,
but met with very slow gale. Available sup
plies of Figs cleaned up quickly in the raorn
infc, but fresh arrivals from Orovllle and
vicinity came to hand too late for the regular
trade and there was quite a surplus unsold
at the close. Choice offerings of seedless
Grapes were In good request, but the bulk of
the receipts arrived too late for the morning
trade and had to be sold at easy prices. Trad
ing in tbe other varieties was of small vol
ume, although supplies were plentiful and
prices easy. Melons were active and Canta
loupes and Nutmeg' Melons were still higher
under continued light receipts. Watermelons
were steady and unchanged. Huckleberries
were suddenly plentiful and there was a sharp
drop in prices. The other berries were In
ample supply and sold well at unchanged
rat*"*.
Citrus fruits were moderately active. Lem
ons. Oranges and Grape Fruit were steady and
Mexican Limes were quoted firm. The feature
of the market was the arrival of a car of

COFFEE^ â C. E. Blckford's circular says:
"No changes of much importance have oc
curred since the 7th ult. The period has been
a dull one and all markets remain quiet at
this writing. Some exceptional sales have been
made â¢>Â£ ftrictly fancy, bold blue washed Costa
Rica at 14@ir>c, but the quantities were small
owing to depleted stocks. The business could
be repeated on a larger scale with suitable cof
fee. Salvadors are held on the basis of 7%c for
current unwashed, but without transactions;
buyers are offering 7@7 ] /4c. Inferior and ash
damaged coffees have sold irregularly, generally
lower.
"Conditions as to next Brazil crop are by
some regarded Improved on reports of rains
being . general throughout the state of ' Sao
Paulo. Others contend that the crops had not
been menaced by the lack of it up to the time.
The present crop Is coming forward freely, re
ceipts at the ports of Brazil being still In
excess of last year's some 300. COO bags. The
visible supply of thÂ« world increased 778. 000
bags during August, but its effect upon either
ppot coffee or futures has been nil.

Butter closÂ»d the week very firm, with some
houses inclined to quote an advance, and there
was Indeed some selling at 30c, but this was
mostly in the form of resales. Stocks of fancy
creamery were cloeely cleaned up. The lower
grades showed no Improvement. The more
conservative houses were inclined to oppose
any advance on the ground that the two holi
days during the coming week may result 'in
tome accumulation of receipts, in which case
it would be difficult to maintain the advance.

Though business on the- Stock Exchange was
less in volume than In the week ending August
25,the average dally clearings were $21,000,000
greater, amounting to $162,000,000; the increase
was probably largely due to the September
settlements which were in progress during the
week. Though the decrease In surplus reserve
was Important, as above noted, there does not
seem to be any Indication that the movement
of money for crop purposes had begun to be
large; this being confined to shipments largely
to the South of not more than $800,000 bo far
as could be traced. Moreover, the fact that
the treasury is absorbing considerable sums
ought not to cause anxiety, for should these
absorptions continue to be large the Secretary
will probably be induced to extend relief
through an Increase of deposits, for public
funds in the national bank depositories. Com
parisons of changes in loans show that three
of the larger banks Increased this item by
$1,400,000 net. Five institutions lost $3,100,000
net In cash.
NEW YORK. Sept. 5.â The Financier
this week says;
The notable feature of the official statement
of the New York Associated Banks last week
was the decrease In surplus reserve, the result
of an Important loss in cash caused by a large
though exceptional movement in Boston for th*
needs of a local corporation, and there were
also comparatively large shipments of cur
*rency to the South, influenced by some activity
In the movement of cotton from the planta
tions. The reduction in, cash was principally
due, however, to absorptions of money from
the banks by the sub-treasury In consequence
of tho fiscal operations, payments through the
banks for customs and for transfers of Internal
revenue collections from western, depositories
through their New York correspondents being
greatly in excess of current disbursements by
the treasury.
The decrease in specie was $2,261,900, and
In legal tenders $1,617,200, making: the total
loss of cash $3,879,100, which amount. It may
be observed, closely corresponds with the
$.'l,S.S5.200 loss to tbe banks, as estimated on
the basis of the traceable movements of money
during the week. The required reserve was
reduced $498,150, through a decrease of $1,092.-
C00 In deposits. Deducting thla sum of $498,150
from the total loss of cash leaves $3,380,950
as the decrease In surplus reserve, which now
is $37,296,975. Calculated upon the basis of
deposits, less those of $37,234,400 of public
funds, the surplus is $26,605,525. The state
ment failed to balance by $589,200, this being
the difference between the sum of the loss of
difference between the sum of the loss of cash,
less the Increase of $1,304,300 In bonds and the
amount of the decrease In deposits. The above
noted expansion In the loan item waa more
likely due more to the extension of accommo
dation to mercantile borrowers than to the
stock commtssiun houses and therefore It was
regarded as unimportant. It may be noted
that the loans are $6,284,500 in excess of the
deposits against $2,067,000 in the previous
week.

Half an hour before the Oceanic Steamship
Company's liner Alameda Failed yesterday for
Honolulu the first "all ashore" whistle was
sounded. There was a subsequent whistle and
ln the interval between whistles a loudly
btaten gong announced the approach of the
hour for del enure. A well regulated ear lo
cated far out in the Mission could have heard
the whistles and the grong's harsh voice was
plainly audible for blocks around. There were
two women on board, however, so busily en
gaged ln the tearful task of bidding good-by
that neither whistles nor gong attracted their
attention and not until the gangway had been
hauled ashore and the lines cast off did they
reulize that the liner was ready to depart. It
was with a Joyous smile that Captain Howard
raw their signals, realized their predicament
and ordered the gangway replaced. Captain
Howard has several varieties of smile, and the
one he wore yesterday was the kind he re
serves for people and circumstanceiwthat In
terfere with the .sailing of a steamship on
schedule time. As the ladles tripped down
the hurriedly replaced plank they got a good
view of the superintendent's smile. "Let's
go," they said simultaneously and up the dock
they scurried, and as they disappeared the
smile that had lent wings to their flight slowly
wore away.

Cavalry on board. All of the Four
teenth, with the exception of about a
score of troopers and an officer or two,
who went on the Thomas as a guard over
a big shipment of treasure, are on the
Logan. Nearly every married officer has
his wife and children with him and among
the passengers were few outsiders.
The Logan left the transport wharf
promptly at noon and very clean and
smart she looked as the tug Slocum
yanked her into the stream by the stern
and strlghtened her out for her run to
the Golden Gate. The band of the Four
teenth contributed musical selections and
on the wharf a large crowd of army peo
ple waved good-by.

Several of the big transcontinental con
cerns have made surveys through the ter
ritory, but no definite results were ac
complished. Not long ago it is said that
the Santa Fe Company showed a dispo
sition to build a line that would event
ually connect with Durango. It secured
possession of a number of coal beds and
was surveying extensively, when the
Southern Pacific Company entered an op
position that resulted ln a conference be
tween the officials of the two roads and
finally the abandonment of the Santa Fe'a
plans. .
It is now resorted that Frank Ktnne.
who, with a number of wealthy associ
ates, has been making large Investments
ln coal beds ln Mexico, has been confer
ring, with the representatives of the Har
rlma'n interests ln the East, and that the
result is a definite assurance riven by
the railroad people that the road will be
built. President Harriman, being too slclc
to give the matter hla personal attention,
instructed General Manager Kruttschnitt
to take it up, and the last named has re
ported in favor of the plans, which, if
carried out, will bring the main lines of
the Southern Pacific Company in touch
with a new and exceedingly rich country.
It is announced that the Southern Pa
cific Company will soon begin a survey
of a route for a line from Durango, Mex
ico, to a point on Its main road in Ari
zona. The matter has been under con
sideration for a -number of months and
was finally turned over to General Man
ager Kruttschnitt by President Harriman,
with authority to proceed as the manager
saw best. - - - â

Complaint was filed yesterday with Jus
tice of thÂ© Peace Van Nostrand that J.
N. Ross and W. J. Thompson of tha
National Law and Collection Company
are In the habit of using:, for the pur
pose of Intimidating people, an imitation
of a document known in law as a "com
plaint and summons." The imitation pro
fesses to be an "Original notice to defend
ant," which is not known ln the legal
business of the Justices' Court. At a cas
ual glance the paper seems to have been
issued from the Justices' Court, but JudgÂ»
Van Nostrand declares that it emanates
from the offices of Ross & Thompson,
who are the attorneys for the National
Law and Collection Company.
The specific instance callea to the at
tention of Judge Van Nostrand was the
serving of one of the papers on W. A.
Nevills, owner of the Rawhide mining
property. The paper was numbered 1349
and recited that suit had been brought
by the National Law and Collection Com
pany against w. A. Nevills for the re
covery of $20 alleged to be due as a sub
scription to an Eastern periodical. The
document was not issued by any Justice
of the Peace nor by the Clerk of the
Justices' Court, Van Nostrand says.
"The use of these imitation papers,"
said Judge Van Nostrand. "appears to me
to be for the purpose of forcing people
to pay an alleged debt with the alterna
tive cf defending a suit to recover the
amount. I understand that Ross whose
name appears signed to the document
served on Nevills. threatens to have the
Sheriff levy on property owned by the
debtor unless he pays up. The paper is
a clever imitation of a "Summons and
complaint." which is the regular docu
ment issued by the Clerk of the Court
and no doubt intimidates people who are
ignorant of the legal procedure in such
cases. I propose to bring the matter to
the attention of the Justices of the Peace
with a view of putting a stop to what I
consider a fraudulent method of com
pelling people to settle with alleged credi
tors."

bers for songs and speeches. At the
conclusion of the feast the members re
paired to the pavilion. An orchestra
composed of Herman Schaefer. Max Du
now. Professor Haug, A. Strellltz and J.
Rlegger rendered popular selections.
Apiong those who took part in the
entertainment were Robert Lorentz, Max
Dunow, S. Levi, Alexander Engelhart,
Carl Dlehl, John Plagemann and Richard
Lenz. At the close of a vaudeville show
a clever burlesque written by Max Du
now entitled "The Wholesale Butchery,
or the Sentimental Girl," was presented.
The actors were attired in ludicrous
costumes and recited their lines inter
estingly. The play told the love story
of a chieftain's daughter who fell in
love with a barn-storming actor. The
girl's father learned of the actor's devo
tion and hired a man to ring down the
curtain on the "tie-walker." It then de
veloped that the actor was "Mr. Sorrow"
and the maid "Miss Care." Both were
condemned to be burned at the stake.
Immediately thereafter two shots were
fired In quick succession. Two men ran
in the direction of Second street. Frank
lin crossed the street and saw Sample
lying on the sidewalk with his face cover
ed with* blood. Sample asked . Franklin
to raise him up. - Franklin did so, but had
to place him on his back again, as his
mouth and nose became choked with
blood. Policemen Nobmann and Clark
then came up with the two defendants
and Sample was carried to an electric
car. Franklin picked up Sample's whistle
and keys from the sidewalk and saw. his
club lying against the fence. No one
passed along between' First and Second
streets between the time of the shooting
and the arrival -of - the -officers.. with the
two defendants. â¢
At this stage the case was continued
till next Friday morning.
FIGHT WITH DTJXLIGHAN.
Thomas F. Dullighan, boiler-maker, tes
tified to having a fight with the defend
ants outside Hugh O'Connor's grocery at
First and Folsom streets. Sample came
up to them and separated them, telling
the defendants to go home. The defend
ants called Sample a foul name and
walked along toward Second street.
Sample remarked that he should have
used his club on them and N walked after
them. That was the last he saw of Sam
ple and the defendants. Joseph Â»1. Sulli
van, a brassmolder, corroborated Dullig
han. Joseph P. Conley, a longshoreman,
who was knocked down either by Sullivan
or Powell, testified that he was too drunk
at the time to remember anything about
it. Hugh O'Connor, the grocer, gave un
important testimony.
C. R. Franklin, a clerk, living at 525
Folsom street, was the most Important
witness. He said he was standing on the
steps of his house and diagonally oppo
site he heard some one telling another
that he couldn't fight him. This was fol
lowed by a scuffling noise and a sound as
If a head had been hit with a club. ,
SHOOTING OF OFFICES.
The preliminary examination of Charles
Sullivan and John H. Powell, charged with
killing Special Officer Robert A. Sample on
Folsom street, between First and Second,
between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of
August 11, was commenced before Police
Judge Mogan yesterday. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Whiting conducted the
prosecution and the defendants were rep
resented by Attorneys Eddy and Coghlan.
Martin Kelly was an interested spectator.
Dr. Charles J. Schmelz, the physician
who attended Sample, described the na
ture of his wounds. One of the bullets
had fractured the neck; there was a
wound on the top of the head, inflicted
with a blunt instrument, perhaps a heavy
shoe; the right eye was contused and cut
and the forehead contused and abrased
by blows from brass knuckles or some
other instrument. Dr. S. J. Fraser, con
sulting physician, corroborated the evi
dence of Dr. Schmelz.

The election was proceeded with, says
the complaint, and resulted in the selec
tion of Treadwell, Lynch, Vandercook,
Bergerot and Birdsall as directors. The
new directors then elected Lynch presi
dent of the corporation and Birdsall sec
retary.
Following the election, the plaintiffs
aver, the new officers of the corporation
immediately took advantage of their po
sition to break away from the agreement
the old board had made with the Asso
ciated Oil Company, and filed an action
to recover the Kern County property.
The action. It is complained, is a breach
of faith and one that will Injure the rep
utation of the stockholders of the Sham
rock Oil Company and do them irrepar
able injury in the business community,
and because of this the aid of the injunc
tion law is sought. Judge Kerrigan is
sued the injunction prayed for. and it will
remain In effect until the court deter
mines the rights, of the plaintiffs in the
premises.
ELECTION PROCEEDS.
A few weeks ago a suit to recover the
Kern County property was filed in Kern
County by the defendants in the suit
brought here yesterday, and this suit is
the cause of appeal to the local courts.
It appears from the complaint filed here
that a few weeks ago the stock and
bonds left with the Associated Oil Com
pany as security were given Into the
hands of Lange and Phillips, and they, so
the complainants aver, immediately called
a meeting of the stockholders of the
Shamrock OH Company. Notices of the
meeting were sent to Treadwell, Lynch,
Vandercook, Bergerot and Blrdsall, and
when they were assembled each one was
made the owner of one share of stock in
the Shamrock Oil Company. Lange and
Phillips, It is said, were eacSi voted eight
shares of stock, thus making in addition
to the stock standing In the name of the
corporation, which was voted by those
present, the majority of the stock, which
the by-laws of the corporation required
should bo represented at a meeting where
an election of officers was held.
As compensation they were to receive
$250,424 in stock and $12,423 worth of bonds
of the Associated Oil Company. At a
subsequent meeting the sellers agreed to
deposit with the purchasing corporation
all of the stock and half of the bonds as
security against any claims or suits con
cerning the title to the Kern County
lands that might be brought against the
Associated Oil Company. It was also
agreed that the Shamrock OH Company
Consolidated should defray the cost of de
fending the title to the land that might
be incurred by the Associated Oil Com
pany.
In the complaint for the injunction,
which was filed yesterday, they allege
that the defendants have entered into a
conspiracy to injure the plaintiffs and to
deprive them of their interests In the cor
poration. The defendants are Edward
Lynch, president of the Shamrock Oil
Company Consolidated; B. M. Blrdsall,
secretary, and E. P. Vandercook, John
Treadwell and P. A. Bergerot, directors
of the corporation.
According to the complaint the directo
rate of the Shamrock Oil Company Con
solidated prior to June 2 of this year -was
composed of the plaintiffs, W. Lange Jr.
and C. H. Phillips. They each owned ten
shares of stock, and the balance, 249,970
shares, stood in the name of the corpora
tion. Lange and Phillips were, respeo
lively, secretary and president. At tho
annual meeting held on that date a prop
osition to sell certain lands in Kern
County owned by the corporation to the
Associated Oil Company was received,
and on vote of Lange, Phillips, Porter
and Whittier was accepted.
COMPENSATION FIXED.
W. S. Porter, B. E. Green and M. H.
Whittler of the Green-Whlttler Oil Com
pany, each of whom owns ten shares of
stock in the Shamrock Oil Company Con
solidated, are dissatisfied with the action
of the directors of the last named com
pany and have filed a suit for an injunc
tion restraining them from proceeding
with the carrying out of certain alleged
schemes and for an order of court declar
ing their election as directors of the com
pany null and void.

Henry H. Lynch is an active and in
fluential aspirant for a place on the tick
et as the nominee for Sheriff. He Is sup
ported by a legion of friends. It is re
marked in his favor that he has always
been true and energetic in support of the
party and that the time has arrived for a
just recognition of his services.
A spirited contest for the District At
torneyship is in progress, with General
Edward S. Salomon and former State
Senator Frank McGowan well to the
front In the favor of the convention.
The United Republican League is de
sirous that every citizen who is entitled
to vote shall be registered. Big registra
tion Is accepted as a harbinger of Re
publican success. Registration for the
municipal election closes September 23.
Cards bearing the following information
have been issued by the league:
If you were not registered for the gubernato
rial election tn November, 1002. or for the pri
mary election In August, 1903, or if you have
changed your residence since your last regis
tration, you must re-register now In order to
voti at the coming elections.
Citizens who will have resided in this city
one year on November 3 are entitled to regls-
Twent'y-onesters, who will become of age on
or before November 3 are entitled to register
n Â°If' you are registered in any other county in
this State, send for a transfer of registration
to the County Clerk of the county in which you
formerly resided, and when received take it to
the registration office in this city.

The Fortieth Assembly District Demo
cratic delegation organized last night at
Oakwood Hall,. 1805 Devisadero street, by
the election of William Ross to the office
of chairman. Of the thirteen delegates,
ten and a half participated in the organ
ization. The following letter from Mr.
Ross was presented: Â»
- .* : " San Francisco, Sept. 4, 1003.
At the. recent primary election the Re
publican party cast more votes than were
cast by both the Democratic and Union
Labor parties. This actual demonstration
of voting strength is accepted as a pretty
sure sign that the â¢ Republican ticket will
come out ahead in the November election.
All that the Republican voters ask for is
a good ticket. The .delegates-elect are
free and unpledged. There Is no indica
tion of any scheme to programme delega
tions lor Mayor. On the contrary, It ap
pears that the contest for the high honor
of leading the party in the campaign will
be fought out openly and squarely on the
floor of the convention.
It transpires that the haste of the Union
Labor convention in disposing of the nom
ination for Mayor was made as a stroke
of political strategy. In the labor parade
Mayor Schmitz will figure in the proces
sion as the only nominee.
It Is common gossip that Thomas W.
Hlckey will be elected to wield the gavel
at the Democratic convention. Gavin Mc-
Nab's control of the forces In the Demo
cratic camp will be almost absolute when
the time arrives for calling the roll of
delegates. Franklin K. Lane is slated as
the nominee of the Democratic convention
for Mayor. He has not publicly an
nounced that he will accept the leadership
of his party in the local campaign, but
his closest supporters affirm that he will
not decline th.^ honor.
The friendly contest for the honor of
presiding over the Republican local con
vention may not be settled until the del
egates assemble In the convention hall
Tuesday evening, September 15. The In
dications are that neither Henry Ach
nor A. Iluef will be chosen.

LONDON. Sept. 5.â Lord and Lady
Yarmouth, whoa* wedding- ex

are coming on surprisingly In
English society. Lady Yarmouth
gave one of the smartest dinners of the
season last week at Prince's, and for a
first big. attempt at entertaining the
English aristocracy the event was voted
a great success. Lady Yarmouth has al
ready adopted the graces of the English
grande dame. Some one said of her at
the dinner, "She's just like every other
American peeress â much more peeressy
than one born to the title."
Tho most important of Lady Yar
mouth's conquests thus far is the favor
she . has won with her husband's own
people. The Marquis of Hertford, head
of the ancient family, has taken his heir
and the heir's bride home to live with
him at the town house in Eaton square,
and they will shortly accompany him on
a country and continental trip. Lord
Yarmouth, according to English opinion,
has been much maligned with regard to
his marriage. His Intimate friends de
clare that, far from marrying for money.

Member of Parliament Says Proposed

Danger of Fire.
LONDON. Sept.* 5.â Is Westminster Ab
bey in danger? This alarming question
has Just been raised, not by a sensa
tional journal but by a serious member
of. Parliament, Mr. Channlng. The eccle
siastical commissioners, it seems, have
determined to clear away the residential
area to the south of the abbey and erect
on the sites a number of tall business

anything built in America for beauty's
sake alone, nearly everything having its
utilitarian side. There is one thingâ the
aquarium, in New lorkâ which he says
has no end except Its beauty.
that any one on the premises knows how
to use the apparatus.
There is, however, a distinguished ex
ception to this rule. It is not generally
known that King Edward VII has .con
siderable knowledge of the routine of flre
brigade work, and that on the occasion
of an outbreak at Marlborough House
when he was Prince of Wales it was
through his exertions and the promptness
with which he ordered a hole to be cut
through a floor and a hose inserted that
the flre was extinguished j before the ar
rival of the regular firemen.
The Prince of Wales would be quite
competent, it is said, to take the position
o! superintendent of a fire brigade should
a revolution deprive him of his exalted
station. The Prince learned the work of
flre extinguishing when he was in the
navy, and it so fascinated him that he
took up the study of flre-flghtlng on land,
and at one time he made it his hobby.
As a result, perhaps, of this fad in thÂ«

May Soon Be Peeress.
LONDON, Sept 5,-It seems likely that
a new name will be added rery soon to
the list of American peeresses In Eng
land. Lord Leigh Is a -very old man and
has been 111 for some time. His son and
heir, Dudley Leigh, married Frances Hel
ene Forbes, daughter of N. M. Beckwlth
of New York. She was a beauty when
last there was a court In Paris, but does
not look more than 30 now, with her fair
brown hair and clear complexion and
charming, gentle manner. She and her
husband are seldom seen apart and she
has most beautiful Jewels, most of which
are his gifts.
his Lordship was and Is In a state of "all
for-love-and-the-world-well-lost." so far
as the present Lady . Tannouth Is con
cerned. Lord Yarmouth Is not thought
of as a business man In any sense of the
word, and stories stating that he de
manded more money with his bride are
laughed at over here.
Two ardent converts to motoring are
the Misses Nell and Anita Evans, daugh
ters of the United States Consul General,
H. Clay Evans. Miss Nell has gone on
a long motoring trip ' on the Continent
with Mr. and Mrs. Mlllard Hunsiker,
formerly, of Plttsburg. The Hunsikers
own several motors, and Miss Evans fre
quently accompanies them In tours
around England. The present continental
trip will last about a month. Miss Anita
and her mother hope for a trip later on,
when Miss Nell returns to town to keep
her father company during his enforced
stay In < London. Miss Anita has been
motoring a great deal recently In the
vicinity of London.
Curiously enough, however, male mem
bers of the British aristocracyâ witness
the Duke of Marlboroughâ seldom trouble
themselves about the art of flre extin
guishing. They content themselves -with
paying for up-to-date appliances at their
mansions and leave the instruction of
their sen-ants to their wives and daugh
ters. The Earl of Derby has recently had
his place at Knowsley fitted up in this
manner, but so far as I can discover
he takes no personal Interest in seeing
ROYAL FIREMEN.
Lord St. Levan's daughters, their
friends and servants are among those who
have become adepts at fire brigade work,
and Lord P.osebery's staff of domestics at
the Durdans, near Epsom, have been
trained under the personal supervision of
the ex-Premier.
forth to drill her servants in the art of
"shooting the chute." I am Informed by
an eyewitness that the Baroness some
times has had to slide down the canvas
tube half a dozen times in person before
s-he could induce a nervous housemaid to
follow her example.
Thanks to the energy and foresight of
the Countess of "Warwick, Dunmow Castle
is protected from fire by perhaps the most
complete private flre brigade in England.
Since the recent destruction of part of
Welbeck Abbey, the Duke of Portland's
historic country seat, flre drill has be
come popular at house parties and It Is a
common experience for the alarm of flre
to be given purposely in the midst of fes
tivities, when guests and servants alike

ness to battle with the enemy.
xjolsaeurs for generation after generation
have collected priceless art treasures.
Fine old mansions they are and choice
food for the flames that now and then lay
hold of them and lick them up, while the
occupants look en helplessly. Some of
them were built so many centuries ago
and with euch joyous disregard of danger
from flre that they ere nothing less than
death traps.
But with the advent of modern fire
fighting apparatusâ much of It of Ameri

has become more secure, thanks to the
rtudy of the subject made by their aristo
cratic owners and the training they have
given to their servants.
THE DUCHESS' OWN BRIGADE.
The Duke of Marlborough was one of
t!-i first to taJie up -with this idea. When
the access to some of the Vanderbilt mil
lions enabled him to renovate the splen

ous ancestor by a nation grateful for his
victories In war. one of his first thoughts
â¢was to protect it from flre and he
equipped the mansion with the latest fire
extinguishing apparatus. It occurred to
h!s energetic little Duchess, however, th3t
their private fire department wasn't of
much use until they had trained help to

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1903.Each performance of "Everyman"- at

of the many Innovations which Mr. Greet
has made in the old morality this yearâ
the processional through the audience,
representing "Everyman" on his way to
the tomb proving to be one of the most
effective.
Mr. Greet Is very desirous, that the play
be seen by students of schools and col
leges and all societies Interested in tho
development of the English drama. For
all such a special rate will be made iÂ£
written application Is made to Mr. Greet
at the Lyric Hall.

The two popular symphony concerts to
be given by Mr. Scheel and his men at
the Pavilion to-morrow and Wednesday
afternoons will recall the Joys of the
Vienna Prater days. The concerts will
doubtless be crowded, as opportunity to
hear the orchestra Is exceptional for the
grand army of working folk.
And now, whether It Is to applaud or
deprecate the oboist's rash heroism is the
question. I myself, still unaccustomed
to the programmed names of the orches
tra, had not ascribed to Mr. Mundwyler
the sins of the Sibelius horning, .not
imagining for a moment that Mundwy
ler's kind of player could be responsible.
Yet upon his head the responsibility In
evitably descended with the audience, and
the question is whether that kind of self
sacrifice Is worth -while? Also, whether
criticism of the unpteaslng result Is "un
fair"?
It presents itself to two of my cor
respondents that my comment upon the
performance of the English horn solo in
tho Sibelius "Legende," given at last
week's symphony concert, was unfair, for
the following reasons. Mr. Louis
Mundwyler, the soloist In question
âand to whom I hasten to ac
knowledge a debt of gratitude for
his most able and artistic handling
of the oboe work in the "Erolca"â had
only an English horn of the old "high"
pitch in the Sibelius solo, which com
pelled him, therefore, to transpose his
part the necessary half tone lower. Un
fortunately, the difference between the
normal pitch of the orchestra and .the
pitch of Mr. Mundwyler's instrument
was not quite the full half tone! The
uncertain rhythmic quality of the solo
one of my correspondents ascribes to the
Inherent impossibility of the work itself,
the other to the excessive sensitiveness
of tho instrument. With an artist of Mr.
Mundwyler's caliber "at the end of It I
should Judge rather that this -was due to
the general horror of the situation.
instrumentsâ hence the name "concerto
grosso." The particular example on TueB
day's programme is perhaps the most
beautiful of the set. The symphony will
be Dvorak"s "New World."

Mr. Scheel has a fascinating novelty on

Handel "Concerto Grosso" that will be

voices. Benedetto's, the soprano's, mezza
voce is exquisite, her upper notes of ad
mirable beauty, her lower notes of un
usual fullness. She loses quality in the
middle range, and on Monday night
showed considerable unevenness In her
production, but I am told she was very
nervous.
There is no doubt about the Gregoretti
voice, the new barytone's. It Is smooth,
powerful, without a trace of tremolo and
conspicuously sympathetic. It Is again
beautifully certain in Intonation, and Slg

K';pgage car getting sidetracked all over

"You arc a Californian. aren't you. Miss
Roberts?" I asked, wondering then about
the pre-star days.
"And proud of It," the actress replied,
prettily.

"Right herÂ«s," pointing a decisive little
finger toward the auditorium. "And, my!

"Doing what? Not "
"Yes. Fuping.** and Miss Roberts
laughed her mellow little gurgle; "pulling

vrhon she hns been here throe weeks!"
"Who had the playhouse then?"
"That was in Osbourne & Stockwell's
"I saw immediately that the play was
one in which the public would like to see
me. The role of Mrs. Hatch is the Cam
illlsh sort of thing, intensely emotional,
and it appeals very strongly to me."
"Why was Mrs. Hatch unwelcome?â A
t.-iking title that," I esked.
"Mrs. Hatch has left her husband
twelve years before the action of the play
begins," Miss Roberts explained. "The
Ftory suggests that che loft him for just
cause, but it is one of the weaknesses of
the play that the fact of her own guilt
or innocence Is not fully established. The
suggestion, however, is that ehe is an in
nocent woman, and the husband is dis
covered married to his former mistress.
But the circumstances of Mrs. Hatch's
disappearance are made to tell against
her. Her guilt is assumed and she has
been compelled to promise that ehe will
not see her daughter. For twelve years
r.he keeps her promise. Then, hearing In
San Francisco, where she has lived In the
meantime, of her daughter's coming mar
riage, she determines to see her, and does
so in disguise. But you can see where
the unwelcomeness comes In."
"Rather the 'East Lynne' kind of
thing," I suggested.
"A littb?," Miss Roberts grants. "But
you trill tay that the first act is one of
the most original and unique that you
liave seen. It has the clever feature of
putting the necessary explanatory mat
ter into the mouths of the leading char
acters. So often when the threads of the
plot are given to a housemaid or a foot
man they are lost. The audience pays
ro attention, and the play in consequence
ruff era."
"Still, I think the audience usually
listens rather eagerly to the Introductory
matter."
"I fir.a It very frequently forgets all
about it in' the clamming of seals, the
furs of late comers and so on." the little
Ftar Insists. "Not eo, though, if it be
friven to the leading people. The strong
act of the play is the thirdâ there arc
fourâ of course, where the two women
meet. Mrs. Hatch has obtained admis
sion to the home as a dressmaker's
assistant and tries on her daughter's
â¢n-edding Cress. Here the second wife
wmej in. recognizes her and thenâ zip!
Mrs. Hatch does not make herself known
then to the daughter, however, but docs
in the last act, when she dies. There is.
of course, a lover, whom Mrs. Hatch wT.l
not marry, as it will "bring ehamo' upon
him. It's a good play, thoughâ a very
pood one, I think. It would amuse you
to see the children. We have thirty of
them In the second act. Oh. but they
pft on onfi's nerves!
"I don't knew why they did not like
the play in New York," Miss Roberts be
gan in her comfortable, low-toned way.
"But they didn't. Outside of New York,
however, it drew tremendously and I'm
sure they'll like the play here."
"Did you see Mrs. Flske in it?" I asked.
"Yes, I saw her In New York and liked
the part and the play Immensely. You
know our foremost actress," and Mis3
Roberts bent her sunny head In graceful
homage to Mrs. Fiske, "would hardly
produce anything that was not at least
worthy."
I said I was cure of it, and Mrs. Fiske's
other admirer continued:
Very pretty, very well and younger than
over the clever Californian looks, and as
we went upstairs to the managerial of
fice I ventured to Fay so. As the man
ager courteously disappeared to allow of
our confidences. Miss Roberts agreed as
we seated ourselves: "Yes, hard work
suits me. I suppose. Then, you know, the
make-up cue uses tends to keep one
young looking."
"It would seem to be Just the other
way," I said, but scanned admiringly the
living testimony of Miss Roberts' smooth
cheek, fair and fine as a baby's. "Some
day." I added, "I am going to persuade
an actress to tell me Just how to be beau
tiful. But I'd rather hear some
thing about "The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch*
to-day, if you don't mind." This was be
fore the actress' triumphs of last Mon

Miss Roberts began, thoughtfully re
garding me:
"It is just a matter of keeping the
pores alive, I thinkâ don't you?â the com
plexion, not Mrs. Hatch," she laughingly
explained.
I turned the other tanned cheek to her

"What do you think I think? But not
oven an expert's opinion on pores shall
divert me from Mrs. Hatch to-day. I
want to know why she was unwelcome,
why New York would have none of the

it?'
WITH the pardonable pleasure of
the woman caught unawares In
an eminently becoming get-up.

the trim, black Filk gown, with its fronts
of delicate embroideries, the white, sheer
waist, with its suggestion of mysterious
laces and flushed satins beneath, the tie
that repeated the frank blue of the eyes,
the chic hat were not donned for me.
"Not this year. And I'd rather play
Peggy than eat," Miss Roberts giggled,
Peggy-fashion. "She's lots of funâ Just as
much fun for me as for the
audience. I think I'm going # to
enjoy 'The Frisky Mrs. Johnson.'
Isn't that English lordllng amusing?
I*awford was so good in the part â 'Really,
I do love you, Grace. I shall grieve for
weeks if you go back on me. Really, I
shall,' " the actress quoted. "But the
parts are all cood."
"I could not sre Grace falling in love
with that puppy." I objected. "The whoie
situation fails to convince. Still, as Mr.
Lackaye put it: 'When will you find a
married woman falling in love where she
might reasonably be supposed to? She'll
inevitably turn from her fine husband to
a consumptive farm hand.' Of course,
from that side the crrlne Grace might
have loved Mr. Lawfocrt's lordllng. Not
otherwise. You liked 'The Frisky Mrs.
Johnson* better than The Climbers'?"
"Well, 'The Climbets* is really a play
for a stock eompariy, not a Btar. Then
again. I really think it is a mistake when
the hrro and heroine are married. There
is unfortunately no more romance about
the married lovers. If Romeo and Juliet
wore married, for example, who'd care
whether he climbed the balcony or not?"
Miss Roberts quizzically put it. "Zaza,
too. Who'd care about Zaza and Ber-
"Have you' my best side?" the little
woman suddenly asked the artist. "It's
this," turning her piquant, smiling, little
profile that he might get the left view.
"Xhis is the side the photographers all
want," she laughed. I noted, however,
that she did not have the usual curiosity
to see the sketch after it was made.
"Is there any Shakespeare on the list
for this year?" I asked then.
"Not this year. My season is for only
six Â¦weeks."
"Still f you have not yet accounted for
them,"'l reminded the actress.
"Well, another week goes. to 'The Lady
Ursula,' bo that the people who don't
want to pay two dollars to see the play
can RtUl see Mr. Hope's charminc com
edy," laughed the little lady. "And I'm
going to do 'The Frisky Mrs. Johnson.' "
"Mrs. Fiske, Amelia Bingham, Marga
ret Anglin, Leslie Carter and Duse rolled
into one!" I testify to the Roberts ver
satility.
"Yes, Leslie Carter," she smiled in re
turn; "I have 'Du Barry' for next sea
son. Also 'The Darling of the Gods.' "
"And Blanche Bates, too!" I murmur.
"You will not do 'The Country Girl' this
year?"
"No, there were many places where
my idea of the part differs from hers.
But, dear, how I did want to do the
thing! Now Becky Sharp â well, there
couldn't be any other Becky than Mrs.
Fiske's."
"That is, of course, easy to under
stand," the coming Gioconda said. "There
ere speeches as long as this," and she
stretched her plump arms to their longest
reach, "and In Italian â one may worry
through French, but we have few au
diences here that know enough Italian
to enjoy the long speeches. You will find,
too, that the drama's interest is largely
in atmosphere. There is Very littleâ
though deeply expressiveâ action. Then
the lines are very beautiful."
"Whose is your translation?"
"Arthur Symonds'."
"Good," I witness, "and the cast?"
"Lucius Henderson is to be the sculptor
â he has just the fine nervous personality
for the part," Miss Roberts stated, "the
others are not yet decided 'upon. But
they will be most carefully chosen. I
have Robert Aitken â how proud San
Francisco should be of that boy â to over
look the arrangement of the sculptor's
studio."
"And now what else Is on the pro
gramme?"
" 'Magda,' " replied this versatile per-,
son. "I've always wanted to do "Magda,'
Now I'm going to. Then I fihall revive
'Za2a' for a week. And oh!" and the
actress clashed excited hands, "I wanted
â never wanted anything so much in my
lifeâ to play 'Tess of the D'UrbervHles,'
but when the arrangements were all but
completed for the production here the
matter fell through."
"You evidently like Mrs. Fiske's reper
toire?"
"Still, I shouldn't play Tess by .any
means Just as Mrs. Flske played it." v
"No?"
"Of the sculptor, his wife and friend,
of the destroyed statue that fnlls upon
the woman's hands and amputates them?
Yes. it's not easy to forget it." I testified.
"But how came you to undertake such a
play? Only Duse has yet done It here,
I believe?"
Miss Roberts nodded an assent and
eaid:
"The way I came to do the play was
really odd. I was playing in Seattle and
one afternoon received a postal reading
something like this: 'Dear Miss Roberts:
There is in the library here a translation
of D'Annunzlo's "La Gioconda." Won't
you read It? Duse's part might have been
written for you. A. E. M.' And I did
get the translation, wrote East then to
find out about the rights and here I am
to play the part!"
"I am right in my impression that the
difficult New York gave Duse and D'An
nunzio no too warm welcome in 'La
Gioconda?' "
"The D'Annunzio 'La Gioconda' is chief
among the new things," the actress re
turned, with pardonable satisfaction.
"We shall give the play at a series of
special Thursday matinees â and It
will. I think, be produced very
handsomely. P:verything will be as fit
and beautiful as it can be made, even to
a new drop curtain. You have to do
things well Jn San Francisco. People
know here. You remember the story of
'La Gioconda?'
"And then, Miss Roberts?"
"Well, everything went comfortably
nfter that. I took Miss Forsythe's place
in the next play â she did not recover for
pome timeâ and afterward I went to the
California Theater, then managed by Mr.
Morrison and Mr. Hayman. You know
the rest. I married the manager." she
laughed, delightfully. "I've been married,
Jus=t think, for fourteen years."
The orthodox "No!" to this was man
aged with much more than common con
viction, and I then inquired:
"What other novelties are we to have
this season besides 'The Unwelcome Mrs
Hatch*?"
"And was It here you got your first
chance?"
"No, that was nt the Baldwin," the
actress pensively recalled, "in a play
called "CHto." It came about curiously, as
those things generally do. Kate For-
F>thc, who v.'as starring in the part, fell
ill of the gTlppe and had to give it up.
The women of the company attempted it
then, but somehow got afraid of it. Then
little Mips Roberts took the part one day
and played it the next. Mr. Morrison,
my husband, and Eben Plympton were
in the cast among others, by the way."
THE SAN FBAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, . 1903.
The new company so far as I have
heard it â I speak only of the "Alda" cast
â seems to be exceptionally competent.
No company within my Tivoll memories
has ever given so smpoth first perform
ance. Every member seemed sure of his
part and the ensemble work was conse
quently in notable contrast to the hesi
tant and doubtful work with which one
again allure! Twelve weeks from
now its quaint elixirs will be i' the blood,
and one helpless to see its dire and lovely
absurdities. But yearly, I find, one must
go through the same acclimatizing experi
ence. Yearly one must dip doubtfully
Into Its trustful tides, later to believe
them real. Yearly one must see a mag
nified plum pudding carried on the stage
as Ptah, and come soon to accept it as
the Egyptian Joss.
But it goes hardly at first. Not all
Alda's beautiful mezza voce (and Ptah
forgive the proofreader for making me
say "mezzo voices" on Tuesday last) im
mediately persuades one that to slap the
chest with one' hand and hall high heaven
with the other is the Ethiopian way of
expressing emotion â though strictly ac
cording to tradition. Nor do such won
ders as- the corsage of the week's Am
nerisâcheerfully reminiscent of our child
hood's best dolls, with the scalloped-top
ped white kid bodies!â woo to quick Illu
sion. Nor is tho shambling lockstep of
the noble Egyptian warriors of those
things that conduce to dear deception.
But these things will be soon joyfully
forgotten, and one may as well begin
now.
HO! for the naive vales of opera

VOICES HEARD
AT7THETIVOLI
Notes of the Players.
The splendid reception which has been
accorded to "Everyman" during its first
week's engagement at Lyric Hall has
surpassed Ben Greet's largest expecta
tions as to the success of the play on
the Pacific Coast. It has now been
definitely decided that on September 28
the company playing "Everyman" will
return to Berkeley, where their first pre
sentment was made so successfully, and
produce "Twelvth Night" In the new
Greek amphitheater of the university.
Mr3. Fiske's season will begin Septem
ber 14 at the Manhattan Theater, New
York, where she is busy rehearsinc her
company in "Mary of Magdala." In which
she will be seen in this city. Mrs. Flske' a
engagement at the Manhattan, where sho
appeared for several months In this play
last season, will cover but four weeks,
and her tour will be one of the longest
she has ever undertaken. She will be sup
ported by a very strong and well-balanced
organization that promises to give even
a more rounded and â¢ symmetrical per
formance of Heyse's great drama than
that of last season. It Is always safe to
predict new excellences In any play in
which Mrs. Fiske appears for a second
season, because of the thought that this
great actress gives to any drama in which
she shows the Interest displayed by her
in "Mary of Magdala." In every promi
nent character that she has assumed
heretofore her repetitions have disclosed
new forces and new subtleties; and such
is her magnetism in her work beyond
that penetralia of the theater commonly
called "behind the scenes" that she seem3
to Inspire every player associated with
her to better effort than the player ever
before has shown. This Is a wonder of
her work reserved for the stage itself.
The marvels of her ability to adjust asso
ciative actora to the ensemble of any
play that she directs are well known
among players, many of whom that have
had the advantage of app*arinst with her
esteeming a season with Mrs. Flske
equivalent to a liberal education In the
arts of the theater.
