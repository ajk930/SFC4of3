VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 11.â Twenf
ty mounted policemen are scouring the
plains south of Calgary to-night
searching for Henri Cashel, sentenced
to be hanged next Tuesday for mur
der. Cashel escaped last, night from
the mounted . police barracks â¢ .jail,
where three big policemen "were con
stantly on: duty watching the death
chamber. Up to a late hour to-night
Cashel had not been found. It is
thought that he crossed the American
boundary.
Constable Piper ordered the con
demned man out of his cell last night
until he could < search it, according to
daily instructions. Outside the ," door
standing guard were two more officers,
Leslie and Phillips. Cashel went out
and sat on a bench in front of. a win-,
dow facing the street.. Piper, after
the search, ordered Cashel back to the
cell, whereupon the priaoner^ suddenly
flashed two revolvers in , the faces of
the guards and ordered all three Into
the cell he had' just vacated. He took
their . revolvers, locked the officers in
the cell, ;ind then walked in hi3
shackled feel to. the place' whyere the
keys were^ kept, removed ] the shackles,
and after! taunting the guards kissed
his hand to them by way of adieu and
left the barracks. . Fifteen minutes
later the night guard entered the' bav
racks and found the three mounted po
pollcemen in Cashel's cell.;
Cashel stole a horse at the edge â¢ of
the town and was not seen afterward.
A formal' reprieve was granted to-day
in his case by the Government. If this
were not done he would be legally, dead
after next Tuesday and the law could'

Sonje one had asked a question abon/
the alleged proposal to rearm the Ger-
â¢ The speaker" sa.!d he recalled with
pride and Joy the friendships he formed
as â¢young officer with the wives and
daughters of his superiors. Thry threw
home Influences around th<> young offi
cers, often J^afnins: the srratitude of dis
tant mothers by affording the former
good counsel and refining surroundings.
Regarding the brutalities, the 'Min
ister declared that such incidents were
not wholly inenpllcabl*?. There was the
bad private soldier, as well asthe bad
sergeant, and the bad private .. was
largely responsible for the whole diffi
culty, ""succeeding by the most "devil
ish ingenuity to so embitter the non
commissioned -officers that. the latter
finally vented their anger . upon the
weaklings." â¢ Â¦ -
Thi3 type of private had always ex
isted, and was more common under So
cial Democratic influence.' The Social
Democrats asserted that militarism en
slaved, brutalized and stupefied the
people and suppressed freedom' of
thought. If this were true Germany
should be in a sad condition, since
Germany was a universal military serv
ice country. But this was not true, as
Germany had succeeded by a combina
tion of industry, intelligence and en
ergy unparalleled in conquering a large
part of the markets of the world.
During the vear ending in June, the
War Minister continued, fifty officers
and 577 non-commissioned officers and
good service men were punished for
mistreatment of private soldiers. Reck
oning percentages, one officer in 400 and
one non-commissioned officer in IS) had
been 1 found guilty of the misuse of au
thority. The convictions were really
fewer duringf the recent agitation than
in some other year?. However, the
army_ administration had determined to
stop mistreatment altogether. Even 100
cases a year would be intolerable.
Discussing Herr Rebel's charge that
the German artillery was Inefficient and
that the German gun was Inferior to
the French gun. the Minister entered
Into a^technleal, explanation of why the
German gun of the, model of 1SSS was
better than the French gun c-f the 1303
model.
German army officers, without attempt-
Ing to exculpate them. He admitted
there had been abuses, and declared the
army administration was determined to
correct them so far as possible. No
body regretted the evils more than Em
peror William, who never lost an op
portunity to Impress the seriousness of
the offenses that had been brought to
light.
Referring to Lieutenant Bilzen's
book, "A Little Garrison" (telling of
alleged actions discreditable to officers,
for writing which the Iientenant was
sentenced to six months' imprisonment
and to dismissal from the army), the
War Minister said it contained a cer
tain amount of truth, but It was not
true that every lieutenant in 'the small
garrisons lived as Bilzen had described.
The Minister did not deny' the possibil
ity of corrupt relations between officers
and women in a" few cases, but the as
sertion that such was the rule was a
slander against German womanhood.
BERLIN, Dec. 11.â In the Reichstag

tered earnestly into the charges of bru
tality and Immorality brought against
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â The state
ments attributed to General MacAr
thur. as contained in last night's dis
patches from Honolulu, in which he
is alleged to have predicted war In the
immediate future between the United
States and Germany, have come to the
notice of Secretary Root.
In an interview to-day the Secretary
said the only information he had on"
the subject was what he had seen in
the papers. He did not regard it as a
case calling -for action >. by him, inas
much as the dispatch quoted General
MacArthur as saying that the state
ments in Colonel Jones' report to Gov
ernor Carter did not correctly repre
sent his views in any particular, and
utterly misrepresented them in some.
Secretary* Boot made the assertion
that remarks -of this character deliv
ered in private conversation:. would not
necessarily shield an officer from the
requirement of an. explanation, but he
gays that General MacArthur carries
with it the weight ,of an ..explanation.
He. therefore, 'would' take no action
in the matter, '
At the iiieetiricr of the Cabinet to-day
it iy'safd that* the matter was discuss
ed, as a ro.*ult of which it seems likely
that Secretary Root will* modify ' his
view, and in the Interest of fairness
to Gohtral MacArthur call upon him

Mrs. : Pierson has recently separated
from her! husband* and as he was very
desirous of securing their child she is
Inclined , to think the husband is at
the bottom of the matter. As Pierson
is known to have been in San Francis
co and to have left for his mother's
home in Missouri with his child yester
day afternoon it. is not out of the
range of possibility that Mrs. Pierson's
surmise is correct. .

resided at 410 Bush' street recently. Her
husband 'has commenced an action for
divorce in Riverside, County. .He is su
perintendent; of ' the Corona Power
Company. \
Suddenly the stranger picked up the
boy, threw him into the buggy, end
jumped in himself. The mother
screamed and the child gave a terrified
shriek, Sandy Ferguson leapfed from
the piazza where he had been sitting
and grasped the horses* heads. The
man who nad remained In the buggy
whipped out a revolver with an oath
and. shouted to Ferguson to let go and
the others xo keep away or some one
would get killed. '.The pugilist Jumped
back and the abductors were soon fly
ing up the road.
Teams were secured and a flrce pur
suit commenced. The strangers had
the fastest team, however, and easily
distanced their pursuers. The local po
lice authorities were informed by tele
phone from Co*lma of what had taken
place and â¢ an attempt was made to
head off the fugitives, but in vain. The
abductors knew what they were doing
and took a roundabout course, as was
shown by the subsequent investigation
of the detectives.
The stranger smiled and held out
some candy. The child followed him
delightedly. Finally the candy was
dropped ov^r the rail on the porch and
the youhg3ter ran down the steps to
secure it.
- Shortly after noon Thursday, the
previous day's visitor drove up again
with a companion. He walked into the
barroom as before and bought drinks
for the crov.-d, and one which he car
ried out to his companion. Soon he
asked after the child, but it was ex
plained that the little fellow was up
stairs with his mother. Hour after
hour the two strangers waited pa
tiently, the one ih the barroom and the
other in the buggy. At about 5 o'c'ock
the little boy appeared in company with
his mother.
Wednesday afternoon the smaller of
the two abductors drove up to the
Seven-Mile Hjuse and hitched his
horse. He then strolled into the bar
room and purchased a few drinks. He
finally turned the conversation to the
subject of Mrs. Pierson and her child
and casually elicited the information of
which he was In search. The barkeeper
and the hangers-on were entirely un
suspicious and after the stranger had
made the acquaintance of "Billy" he
drove away in the direction of San
Francisco.
The Seven-Mile House, just below
Colma, was the scene of a sensational
abduction at 5 o'clock last Thursday
afternoon. Two strange men seized
the two-year-old son of Ida F. Pierson,
in plain view of a dozen people, hurled
the shrieking little one into a top buggy
and dashed up the road to San Fran
cisco, with a crowd of enraged men In
vain pursuit.
The deed was accomplished by a dis
play of firearms and dire threats.
Sandy Ferguson, the pugilist, almost
prevented the abduction, but* was
forced to relinquish his hold on the
horses at. the point of a revolver. The
police authorities of San Francisco
were notified of the occurrence as soon
as possible and detectives were imme
diately placed upon the case. The
mother of the stolen child is frantic
with grief. -
No one seems to be able" to give much
of a description of the man who re
mained in Â¦ the btyjgy. _? His companion
is said to have been well dressed, short
in stature, of prepossessing: appearance
and.- with , a curly. bj^frk-muataÂ«hÂ«.-is*"-^
Mrs. Pierson , has recently. . come " to
.this section, of the State from Corona.
For several weeks she has been living
at the Seven-Mile House a3 the guest
of Jack. Sutton, the proprietor. Her
little boy, "Billy," has been a great fa
vorite of Ferguson and his followers,
who have been living at Sutton's place.

SENATOR 3IAKES PROTEST.
WORDS OF McKlXLEY.
The Senator also quoted from Presi
dent McKinley's last speech at Buffalo.
Bard stated that California, Arizona!
Florida and the Gulf States produce
everything that is produced in Cuba,
and that while immediate injury to the'
industries may not be great, future in
jury will be most serious. By tables
he Fhowed the . growth of the citrus
fruit industry In California, and deliv
ered high encomiums upon the farmers
of that State generally, calling atten
tion to their high standing as citizens
and agriculturalists and to the fact
that they have devoted their time, en
ergies and fortunes to the upbuilding
of great industries, which this bill will
most seriously affect. He referred to
the live-year clause of the measure and
said that tie believed a more definite
term should have been provided and
that it is Incorrect to say that the
treaty will continue for five years only;
that It will continue indefinitely until
notice be given by either party of its
intention to terminate the same. He
asked:
Mr. Bard quoted from the report of
Collector Bliss, at Havana, to show
that many articles in common use in
the United States are unsuited to the
physical conditions of Cuba and that
the lack of trade is the result of the
indifference of American manufactur
ers, who will not cater to the tastes
and wants of the Cuban people. He en
tered a most earnest protest on be
half of the farmers and fruit-growers
of California, and quoted the views of
Mr. Bluine, former Sneaker Heed,
President McKlnley and President
Roosevelt, and other Republican lead
ers on reciprocity, to the effect that
it must not be permitted to injure our
own industries.
'"This declaration that our promises
vrere fulfilled Is an* acquittance so far
as any obligation rested upon us up
to thnt date, and if.. any obligation of
honor rests upon us now. It musti have
originated since then. Commercial re
lations with Cuba are desirable and
should be promoted, but the advant
ages accruing to us are not worth the
cost if, in order to secure-them. we
must sacrifice some of our own indus
tries and Â¦ derogate from the great
principles which the Republicans are
pledged to support. The reduction pro
posed by the bill in the tariff rates
upon the most important Cuban prod
ucts can have no other effect than to
stimulate their production and facili
tate tho sale, sooner or later, of such
articles in our own markets in compe
tition with the products of our own
soil. I am unable to believe the meas
ure will do harm to^no industry, and
am not convinced that the measure
provides the only way by which our
export trade with Cuba could be ex
panded."
INDUSTRIES ENDANGERED.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 11.â
Senator Bard addressed the Senate to
day In opposition to the Cuban reci
procity bill. His remarks received
close attention by the Senators. He
spoke of the Plait amendment and
stated that careful examination of its
provisions fail to disclose any indi
cation that this Government must
necessarily grant to Cuba commercial
preferential advantages in our mar
kets for her products. He said:
"The Cuban people certainly under
stood that in accepting the Platt
amendment it was as a full settlement
of all claims between Cuba and the
United States. There could be no
other meaning: of the words of Presi
dent Palma which were uttered upon
a memorable occasion, when on the
"Oth of May. l<v>2. General Wood, under

CHICAGO, Dec. 11.â The troubles of
Nance O'Neill, McKee Rankin and W.
S. Cleveland, the theatrical manager,
who has attached all the property of
the two actors, were aired in a Justice's
ccurt here to-day. Cleveland in his tes
timony declared that Miss O'Xeill was
hypnotized by Rankin. '_ \ \.*"V_
"It is a second case of Trilby and
Svengali," he said. "From the stage of
my theater I have seen McKee Rankin
exert his influence over Miss O'Xeill.
When he looked at her she forgot her
lines, and when he snapped his finger
at her she would act. He has an undue
influence over her and has kept her
segregated from other actors or man

When Miss O'Neill was put on the
stand she denied the allegation of
Cleveland that Rankin had any hyp

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â The Repub

When asked regarding the reported at
tempt to create a division among the
members of the "Panama Canal Com
pany and its probable effect on the rat
ification- of the treaty by the United
States Senate, M. Bunau-Varilla said
that while the matter is completed so
far as Panama is concerned, it is ad
visable to move quickly, because delays
tend to affect the imagination, and that
so long as a thing Is unsettled compli
cations are likely to arise. He declined
to enter Into a - discussion - regarding
any action which the Panama Canal
Company may take. - . -;
Some of the Colombian contingent in
Washington are trf the opinion that the
agitation in Paris of this question is
simply an- opening-of the bitter contro
versy that raged for some time be
tween the conflicting interests in the
original Panama Canal Company and
the reorganized company. The offi
cials here, however, do not "see how
any regular and orderly proceedings in
France can materially affect the rela
tions between the canal company and
the United States Government, for they
feel that the agreement between the
two to sell the canal is in the nature
of a contract, which cannot be broken
by either party so long as the other
insists on regarding* it as in force.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11.â John E.
Chandler, who is alleged to be one of
the dynamiters who blew up a miue
in Colorado during the present labor
troubles there, was arrested to-night
by Sheriff White on East Ninth street
as a fugitive from justice and will be
held until an officer can come from
Colorado io take him back for trial.
The arrest was made on a telegram,
which the Sheriff received from Sheriff
Sanborg of Idaho Springs, Clear Creek
County, Colo., requesting that Chandler
be arrested, and stating that it was
positively known that he was in Los
Angeles.
How st -on? a case the Colorado au
thorities have against the prisoner 13
not known here,' but that he is badly
wanted is indicated by the fact that
to-night Sheriff White received by wire
a certified telegram containing the text
of the warrant which is held there for
Chandler's arrest. The warrant does
not recite the allegations of the com
plaint; but is simply an order directed
to any peace officer of Colorado to
place the man under arrest on a felony
charge of arson. His capture in Los
Angeles was the result of the discov
ery that he has relatives In this city.
When he fled from Colorado he f left
word with other relatives where they
should address their mail to him, arfd
by watching the mail the man' was ap
prehended. .
The) crime for which Chandler is
wanted Is not that of participating In
the explosion which wrecked the Vin
dicator mine in the Cripple Creek dis
trict, killed several men and precipita
ted the state of affairs which caused
Governor Peabcdy to declare that por
tion of the State under martial law.
Instead it was one of the serious crimes
which was committed almost at the In
ception of the present labor troubles in
Colorado. Idaho Springs is far re
moved from the Cripple Creek district
and there, several weeks ago, as a re-,
suit- of the actions of certain leaders
of the striking miners, the citizens
fcrmed a vigilance committee, took a
number of the officers of the Miners'
Union into custody and drove them out
of the country. Prior to this action,
and largely one of Â¦ the Â¦ contributing
causes of it, occurred a series of dyna
mite outrages, which In more than one
instance resulted In loss of life.
' It Is allesed that Chandler was a
leading spirit among the miners there
and that when others suspected of par
ticipation In the outrages were arrested
he fled the country. Since then the
Colorado authorities have been making
a search for him, but it was not until
to-day that they discovered his exact
address* A letter mailed to him in Ida
ho Springs to a certain address on East
Ninth street was seen, and that ad
dress telegraphed to Sheriff White of
this city. The Sheriff went there and
found his man. â¢ â¢
Chandler refuses to make any state
ment and declares that he will fight
auy effort to take him back to Colo
rado for trial. He will neither affirm
nor deny that he is the man wanted.
Late to-night. Sheriff White received a
telegram from Idaho Springs asking

LOVELOCKS, Nev., Dec. 11.â A de
plorable but seemingly unavoidable ac
cidental shooting took place at the
Southern Pacific depot early this morn-
Ing, in which Agent J. W. "Walters re
ceived a bullet wound that caused his
death nine hours later. H. P. Cook of
Salt Lake, a friend, and Walters were
comparing their revolvers. The re
volver Cook carried was a Colt's auto
matic, and he was explaining the mech
anism to "Walters. The weapon had been
taken apart and the cartridges removed
from the magazine, but there was a
load in the barrel which had escaped
notice. In explaining the use of the
revolver It was accidentally discharged
and the bullet entered "Walters' ab
domen, inflicting a wound that proved
fatal. The bullet took a downward
course, punctured the intestines in sev
eral places and finally lodged in the
liver. Local medical aid- was sum
moned and Dr. "W. H. Hood of Reno.
Nevada, was telegraphed for. Upon his
arrival and after a short consultation
with the other physicians It was found
that an operation should be performed.
The wounded man was placed under an
anesthetic and remained on the oper
ating table six hours. The efforts of the
surgeons were of no avail, for "Walters
died about 6 o'clock this evening.
Agent Walters was one of the most
popular employes on the Salt Lake di
vision of the Southern Pacific. He has
been stationed at Lovelocks for the past
six years, being transferred from Red
Bluff, Cal.

."If the President refuses to obey the
plain words- of the Spooner act, ap
proved by him, . perhaps, suggested by
him? if he is going to override the law;
if, after having waited a reasonable
time to enter into a treaty with Colom
bia, -he now refuses to obey the lan
guage of that law and proceed to try
and negotiate a treaty with Costa Rica
and Nicaragua, then in God's- name
hurry up your canal."
â¢ 'Mr. Williams, the minority leader,
following,- charged- that^'this was the
first time that this Government had in
terfered in :the.:<. domestic affairs of a
South American t^ountry.T He! said that
the minority side could not.- be made to
make t,he. mistake which the majority
desired it to -make. : The Democrats
want a canal, he said.-. They wanted
the Nicaragua*! canal, but if they could
not, get the canal where they, thought
it ought to be they would take it whert)
they could get it,-: and take it as they
might get it. He thought possibly the
Nicaraguan route was regarded as too
great a competitor of the transconti
nental railways.
After some further remarks on the
same line Mr. Williams, closed as fol
lows: â¢ Â¦ ,-....-'
"It was done* sedulously and care
fully, but it did ;nqt 'result in making it
vary difficult for troops to come from
Bogota. Our Government will not per
mit anybody on the line of that railway
or the crossing of the Isthmus" that
would disturb free transit, and it is be
cause the two things coincided that
men who do not look on the, matter
calmly will say that we did what we"
did to injure Bogota, when in fact we
did it to keep good faith, though it has
in jufed Bogota."' â¢
After reviewing the history of the act
of Congress and the negotiations with
â¢Colombia and the sending of a treaty
to Bogota, Mr. Hitt said the people of
Colombia thought the United States
were so bent on having a canal on the
isthmus that the game wa^easy. They
had $10,000,000. but $20,000,000 would be
better, â¢ and Colombian papers had
urged those charged with the power to
hold out for -great sums of Yankee
money. ...
"Now it so happened ;in the course of
human events, '/which we; do not;8ruide,
but which : >it; is believed by many; an
All-Wise, '^Providence watches \ and j di
rects,'that in this case our duty in goo'd
faith under the treaty to ' keep .that"
highway open Ifell In with and brought
cut' a consequence which was grave to
Colombia. Shevhad invoked that'inter
ference before,' but it so happened that
always heretofore it was to hei\benefit.
In this case what/\ve. have' done we did
for a motive of the highest obligation
of national faifh. i 'Â¦ ' . ' '
The President, said- Hitt, had not
'been precipitate, but .had waited a
reasonable time. "But," he added, "he
did not waste time; he never does.V
"Ordinarily," Hitt, went oh, "when a
ship is in peril and a disturbance oc
curs we land troops to protect Ameri
cans from being killed or robbed. We
have done that in France and we
would do it anywhere. "
"In the case -of Panama situa
tion was different 'from that. of any
nation on earth. We had\ a s solemn
and binding ' engagement' >\vhich' has
been impressed upon us. by, all, these
years. Often we were called upon- by
the Colombian Government, Qftener by
events, to force the obligation to keep
that path open from sea to sea; .not
to aid nor ' to suppress rebellion, but
to keep the path open;' and when we
landed troops at Colon their"duty"un
der the treaty was plain -to -let- no

mus. .; Â¦ .\,.n .'. '< â'Â¦â¢Â¦. â¢- ' .â¢Â¦'''Â¦
Hitt â¢ said there was nothing hasty,
or unique in the recognition of the new
republic, as it occurred five days after

Carr was a Democrat In politics and
for many years was* one of the most
influential men of his party in Cali
fornia.
Though for some years entirely blind
and deaf in one i ear he exercised al
most to the very last a personal super
vision over his many business Inter
ests, and when at home was to be
found at his office every morning by S
o'clock. ?-- - Â¦
In 1S66 he engaged ; in . 'staging â¢ and
carried the first mails;between'VirginIa
City, New, and" Boiaej_ Idaho, through
a country infested b>vhostlle Indians:
From-1866; to 1870 ?he>waÂ«* the largest
"star rout6", mall contractor on the
Pacific Coast, his contracts amounting
to as much as $300,000 a year. For four
years he carried the mails between
Oroville, Cal., and Portland, Or. This
took him through the northern part of
the State, and, liking the countrV, he
later acquired 20,000 acres of land In
Modoc County and stocked the ranch
with horses and cattle. He also ac
quired large holdings in Monterey
County, but of late years had been re
ducing these by sales. By one of these
sales he parted with 10.000 acres of the
richest land to be found in the section,
but immediately bought an equal
amount In Northern California.
Carr was a public-spirited citizen and
identified with nearly every enterprise
of Monterey County. He was for many
years president of the Bank of Monte
rey and president of the Monterey Dis
trict Agricultural Association. He was
a member of the Board of Freeholders
which, In 1900. framed a charter, for Sa
linas City. Though a close trader, he
was quite liberal with his means. He
gave $5000 to the Odd Fellows for a
public library in Salinas and $4000 to
the South Methodist College in Santa
Rosa. He was a good friend to those
he liked and helped many a boy and
?tirl to obtain an education.

became interested in ; the Pulgas ranch
and In the fall of 1S53 moved itb'the
Pajaro Valley. He later purchased, a
part of the Salsupuedes ranch: In 1859
he moved to the Salinas Valley, where
he made h!s home.
. While there he was offered the posi
tion of postal agent of California and
arranged to start for this coast Con
gress had just passed a law authoriz
ing the War Department to furnish,
upon registration, persons going ' to
California with firearms at Govern
ment cost. General William M. Gwin
was the first man and- Jesse. D. Carr
the second to register under this law. â¢
Carr gave up the Â¦ appointment as
postal agent and finally came on out
here to take a position as deputy Col
lector of the Port of San Francisco, un
der . Colonel James - Collier, then just
appointed^ He arrived here August 18,
1S49, preceding Collier by four months.
Â¦ Immediately upon his arrival Carr ac
cepted a position as deputy under the
military Collector, Mr. Harrison, and
Colonel Collier's arrival assisted in
organizing the- office on a civil basis
He remained in the position about a
year. After retiring he was elected. to
the Assembly and was made chairman
of the Committee on ; Commerce . arid
Navigation and a member of the Ways
and Means Committee. He introduced
and secured the ' passage of the first
funding bill for San Francisco, provid
ing for funding the debt at 10 per cent.
Warrants were drawing interest at the
rate of 3 per cent a month.
S Subsequent to this Carr had some ex

Jesse D. Carr's early days were spent
on a farm and attending the country
school. At the age of 16 he left home
and spent two years at Cairo, III., and
then six years at Nashville, Tenn.,
clerking In stores. At the age of 23 he
married and with his savings, amount
ing to $1000, went Into business with a
former employer, as a partner, in Mem
phis. They did well until his partner,
who had lost his mind, involved .the
firm to the extent of $20,000. This in
debtedness Carr paid off In two years
and four years later closed out the busi
ness with $40,000 in hand. He is skid
to have built, in 1840. the first brick
house ever erected in Memphis. In
1843 he went to New Orleans and en
gaged in the cotton commission busi
ness. In which, after a time, he lost all
that he had made. The Mexican War
breaking out soon after, though con
tinuing his business in New Orleans,
he went with General Taylor's army as
a sutler and supply contractor. He
had many adventures' In that capacity
and on February 24, 1S47, lost all of his
goods, valued at $40,000. He barely es
caped, with his own life. 180 men with
the train being killed or captured. It
turned out that the capture of this
train kept General Urea, with 3000 Mex
icans, from taking part in the battle
of Buena Vista and so probably lost
the day for the Mexicans. The inci
dent brought Carr into relations with
General Taylor, which later became
very friendly.
Carr recouped his losses in Mexico
to the extent of $15,000, and > in Janu
ary, 1849, returned to New- Orleans.
There he had a second attack of chol
era (the first In 1834), and after a hard
siege recovered and went to Washing
ton to attend Taylor's inauguration.
Jesse D. Carr, himself a pioneer of
California, was born of pioneer stock
in Sumner County, Tennessee, June 14.
1S14. His people were among those
who crossed the Alleghanies in colonial
days and helped to build up and or
ganize that commonwealth. At the
time of his birth his father, with most
of the able-bodied men of the State,
was engaged with General Andrew
Jackson in warring with the Creeks
and Seminoles in the country to the
south. *

SAN JOSE. Dec. 11. â Walter Lewin
and B. Osborne are in the custody
of the police. The men came here
about a week ago and visited many
physicians, claiming they were about
to establish a collection agency. Dr.
J. F. Burns and Dr. Ulrich gave them
bills to collect. Lewin posed as man
ager of the concern and Osborne as
collector^ A few days Jater the men
returned to the physicians and stated
that in order to get the money on the
bills suits would have to be com
menced. Drs. Burns and Ulrich each
gave Lewin $7 50 for costs of the suits.
No actions were brought on the bills
and the medicos came to the belief
they had been swindled. They re
ported the matter to the police and
the arrests followed. Lewin to-day
was charged with obtaining money
under false pretenses and Osborne was
charged with vagrancy.
Alleged Swindlers Arc In Jail.
The roll call of cities brought out re
ports of improvements of municipal
conditions in all the cities represented.
The convention took a determined
stand against the suits now pending
wherein certain cities are sued because
of alleged infringements ef patents cov
ering road and street Improvement by
means of oil. The patent was declared
invalid on its face, as the use o* oil
for such purposes is not new. Similar
patents antedate the one in contro
versy, and both oil and the dust sought
to be laid are natural products and
therefore not subjects of letters cf pat
ent. All delegates were directed to in
terest their respective Supervisors and
the society was instructed to mail cop
ies cf the report on the subject to the
various cities.
Mayor Schmitz of San Francisco was
the last speaker and talked at some
length. He approved of municipal con
ventions and said he knew that any
thing that benefits California helps San
Francisco. He promised that the 517.
000.000 bond issue would be spent to
best advantage. He said during the
last r.ine months San Francisco had
$2,000,000 worth of buildings started,
while Eastern cities have decreased.
He urged the Importance of making ex
hibits at St. Louis and said that the
Supervisors upon his recommendation
were considering a municipal exhibit
there for San Francisco.
Standing committees were appointed
as follows: Engineering â Pearson of
Sacramento, Piper of San Jcse, Tell

"I think Chamberlain means more
than his critics give him credit for. He
sees the extraordinary power the selfish
policy of the United States has placed
in Great Britain's hands. Three courses
are open to Great Britain. They can
use their power to force reciprocity on
the States, they can use it to stimulate
emigration and food production in
countries other than the States, or they
might use It to pave the way for a
\rade alliance between the English
speaking peoples. Such an alliance
would mean a world-wide dominion of
the English-speaking peoples. We may
live to see two great world empiresâ
the Russian and the English-speaking.
I would guard against the United
States. They have good qualities, al
though they have sometimes descended
to sharp practice. Long and often I
have advocated a friendly alliance
between Great Britain, Canada and the~
United States, and that is why I advo
cate reciprocity with the United States,
and I desire the British zollvereln as a
step in that direction."

PARIS. Dec. 11.â Dr. Perriquet, con
sidered the leading witness in the Fair
will case, testified to-day before Com
missioner Eiser of New York. He said
he arrived on the scene an hour after
the automobile accident and found both
Charles L. Fair and his wife dead. The
*body of Fair was already rigid, but
that ef his wife was not rigid, Indicat
ing that the former died first. From
the condition of Fair's body the wit
ness believed his death had been In
stantaneous. The condition of Mrs.
Fair's body indicated that her death
was not instantaneous.
Dr. . Perriauet recited the case of a
woman who was murdered near the
scene oi. the accident. Her wounds,
which were in the head, were almost
Identical with these of <&Irs. Fair, the
victim living Vor many hours.
The v.itness further testified that
while he was unable to swear positive
ly whether Fair or Mrs. Fair died first,
yet his positive opinion was that Mrs.
Fair must have survived her husband.
The court has received a letter signed
"Lescour," an official of the local May
or's office near the scene of the acci
dent, saying that the porter's wife, who
found the bc-dies. told him she saw Mrs.
Fair's hand move after Fair was dead.
The cross-examination of Dr. Perri
quet will take place Monday.
BERLIN. Dec. 1Lâ The eight armored
cruisers that yet remain to be built
under the naval programme will ap
proach battleships In tonnage, with cor
responding increases in armor, gun
power and steaming radius. The first
of these has already been designed by
the Navy Department and will be laid
down immediately. The largest German
cruiser in course of construction is the
Roon, which was launched at Kiel In
June last. She is under 10,000 tons.
Technical writers, especially Lieutenant
General Count von Revenslow, have
been urging the Government to build
cruisers as large as those of Great
Britain, the United States and France,
with considerable coal capacity, the
armored cruisers of the German navy
having a limited field of action and in
ferior armaments. The vessels of tho
new cruiserNype will somewhat Impair
the homogeneity of the squadron, and
for this reason the Navy Department
reluctantly adopted them.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11.â Manager
Wells of the Santa Fe is out of the
city, but other Santa "Fe officials here
take no stock in the rumor that the
Santa Fe company will move its offices
to San " Francisco.
"I believe the story was made out
of whole cloth at San Francisco," said
Treasurer Holterhoff to-day. "Nothing
has been heard of the alleged change
of quarters down here, and I do not
believe a word of the rumor is true."
It is pointed out that the Santa Fe
company leased a large part of three
floors In the Conservative Life Build
ing for a period of ten years only
twelve months ago, when it moved
from the old quarters in the Bradbury
Block. This indicates that the com
pany had no intention of removing its
general offices from" Los Angeles at
that time.

Judge Sloss holds that the places in
question are civil service positions, but
that the men are holding them legally,
first because of their-appointment as
regular members of the Fire Depart
ment prior, to^ the existence of the
Civil Service Commission and second
ly, because \ they were placed .under
civil service by the reorganization of
the department.
Gleason Â¦ petitioned the Superior
Court for a writ of mandate compell
ing the Commissioners to declare the
positions held by these men vacant on
the ground that they were doing the
work of machinists at the corporation
yard; He wanted the positions filled
by men from the classified civil ser

"Foxy Grandpa." 'The advance sale
is the largest in the history of the pop

Â¦ For the last two seasons "Foxy

Joe Hart is probably the best known
and most popular comedian that ever
visits this part of the country. His
last appearance here was at the Or

conjunction with Carrie de Mar, he
played the longest engagement ever
recorded in local vaudeville. Hart
first came into prominence with Fred

Rnbbi Opens Course of Lectures.
. Rev. Jacob- Nieto, rabbi of the Con
gregation Sherith Israel, opened :hls
regular winter course of Friday night
lectures at the synagogue, corner of
.Taylor and Post streets, last night.
The edifice was fairly well filled and
'pome beautiful music was rendered by
the choir. The rabbi took for his sub
ject a recent book on the Conversion
of the Jews and in his scholarly man
ner tore it to shreds. He advanced
the belief that all of the ethics and
: philosophy of the Christian religion
j was of Jewish birth and only the hand
;*of might had kept the Jewish religion
from being the foremost monotheistic
.doctrine of .the world. Instead of . a
conversion, of the Jews he pleaded' for
a revertion of Christian to the mono
theistic theory of. theology, first .ad
vanced by Israelistic philosophers a*nd
kept alive through two thousand years
of barbarities and persecutions, 'â¢ ,
. Dr. Voorsanger has discontinuedjiis
weekly lectures for the winter season
because his congregation evinced', no
particular desire to attend them.

On motion of Commissioner Sullivan,
seconded by Commissioner Altman, this
resolution was unanimously adopted:

. TACOMA, Dec. 11.â The finding of
nearly a half-bushel of counterfeit sil
ver coins in the bottom of Tacoma
harbor is taken by secret service of
ficers as evidence that a gang of coun
terfeiters is doing a wholesale business
in Alaska and sending their product to
Puget Sound. A big hydraulic dredger
belonging to the North American
Dredging Company of San Francisco
brought the coins up from' the bottom
of the city channel several days ago.
About the same time the Seattle detec
tives arrested Jake Claussen, on whom
were found dies for 50, 25 and 5 cent
coins, together with several counterfeit
half-dollars, one spurious quarter and
one nickel. Investigation shows that
after Claussen returned to Tacoma
from Alaska, about October 1, he re
mained here as watchman of the steam
er Arthur B until three weeks ago.
The coins brought up by the dredger
were found exactly where the Arthur
B was lying while Claussen was watch
man. Claussen claims the coins found
on him were given him by a man from
Alaska. The officers believe he threw
the coins overboard because suspicious
that his actions were being watched.
"I do not know what action Fed
eral authorities will take in the matter
now. Bonetti has become a public
charge ! in the legal sense of the word
and ,1 presume can now be deported.
He will be sentenced next week and
will be safe for some time to come."
The matter was also reported to the
Federal authorities with a view to hav
ing him deported as an anarchist, but
no evidence cc-uld be found connecting
him with anarchist societies. Another
clause of the immigration act, however,
allows an immigrant to be deported
who becomes a public charge within
two years after landing in the country.
Bonetti was found guilty of assault
with a deadly weapon, which is a re
duction of the offense charged against
him, the maximum penalty for which
is two years in prison. In speaking
of the matter of dei>ortation. Deputy
District Attorney Harris said:
' Joseph Bonetti, the alleged anarchist,
was found Ruilty of assault with a
deadly weapon by a jury this evening
and imprisonment and final deporta
tion from the country may be the re
sult of his act. â¢
Bonetti had only been in the country
fifteen days from Italy, when he stab
bed Patrick Coughlan, a night watch
man at LIvermore. He was arrested
and charged with assault with Intent
to commit murder.

Albert Elkus Will Be Soloist of Min
etti Orchestra Recitation at
Alhambra Theater.
On Monday" night, December 14,
the Minetti orchestra will give its
first concert of the season at the Al
hambra Theater and the soloist will
be Albert Elkus, a composer and pian
ist, who has already distinguished
himself in both directions.
Elkus was born in Sacramento
eighteen years ago and graduated
from the Sacramento High School
and has been attending the. University
of California. At the age of 13 he
gave a piano recital here, at which
he played a number -of original com
positions and Improvised on J given
themes in a manner that aroused ad
miration. Shortly afterward the boy
playedfor Rosenthal and Sauer while
they were concertizlng here and they
pronounced him <a genius.
Edward MacDowell also examined
some of the boy's compositions with
the result that the distinguished com
poser sent for young Elkus to tell him
personally that he found the composi
tions genuinely original and of great
beauty. This, from the acklowledged
greatest of American composers, was
a significant compliment.!
During the last two years several of
Elkus* songs have appeared upon the
concert programmes of our \ profes
sional singers and a trio for -violin,
cello and piano was performed pub
licly at Steinway Hall two years ago
Dy three of our best professional mu
sicians with great success. At the
age of 12' the boy began to write for
orchestra, though he had. then no
systematic instruction in orchestra
tion. He. wrote a number of pieces
for full orchestra, one of which has
been publicly performed.
Young Elkus is a pupil of Hugo
Mansfeldt. His playing is tempera
mental and he commands- an unusu
ally wide. technical resource. At the
concert on Monday*night he will play
'.'The Lady of Shalott" and "Cleopat
ra" of his own composition and "Le
zende St. Francois Marchant sur les
Flots," by Uszt.

The general conclusion reached after
receiving the report of the agents who
went East is that the agriculturists of
the Eastern States are experiencing as
much difficulty in obtaining efficient
help as are those of California, and in
stead of endeavoring to secure young
men the committee recommended that
inducements be offered to families to
come to California by the sale to them
on the most reasonable terms of small
tracts. of land upon which they may
settle, being, willing at the same time
to assist in the orchards and vineyards
when needed/During the year the com
mittee received applications from
would-be employers for 1903 hands for
work in harvest field or vineyard. The
committee, through its office, placed 911
persons in positions. Many more were
induced to come to California and se
cured, work, of whom the committee
has no record. Most of the help want
ed was "asked for in August, September
and October, but some of It was want
ed for the year. "
At the afternoon session H. P. Sta

ity of , Our Orchards?" was the subject
of an address by A. D. Bishop. /
Professor S. F. Woodbridge spoke on
the subject of "Fertilization.".
Allegations of undue influence are
made concerning all the clauses ap
pealed from.
and trustee. ~" That statement vras
elaborated in the document filed to
day. Tvhich, after repeating the clauses
of the will to which objection Is taken,
says, in effect, that Mr. and Mrs. Bry
an '"induced and persuaded Bennett
to sisn a paper addressed to "William
J. Bryan, and to copy a considerable
portion of another paper, the said
ropy to be addressed to Mrs. Bennett.
The papers referred to are the sealed
letter by which Mr. Bryan and family
â¢were to be given $50,000 by consent of
Mrs. Bennett, and a letter, similar in
purport, which Mr. Bryan produced In
court.
The appeal says it was then the In
tention of Mr. Bryan and his wife that
only the sealed letter addressed to
Mrs. Bennett was to be brought to her
knowledge, "and that was for the pur
pose of Inducing her to permit Wil
liam J. Bryan to get the $50,000." It is
rlso declared to have been the inten
tion of Mr. and Mrs. Bryan not to
make public the other paper ad
dressed to Mr. Bryan as "My dear Mr.
Bryan," or to have it brought to the
knowledge of Mrs. Bennett. -
The document continues:
"The writing addressed to this appel
lant, the wife of Mr. Bennett, did not
state the real and true arrangement
which Mr. and Mrs. Bryan had in
duced Mr. Bennett to enter Into rrith
them. The fact that the children of 1
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan are to receive j
Jlo.OOO of Mr. Bennett's money was
not stated, but, on the contrary, the
-.vritlr.g addressed to the widow ex
rret?!y stated that if William J. Bry- j
an for any reason is unwilling to re- j
r-eive that sum for himself, that he j
fihiill distribute the JjO.000 among ed
urational and charitable institutions,
vrhllc in truth and fact and in law
the letter addressed Jo Mr. Bryan
< onstifjted him a. trustee for his wife
r.nd children, and the sum of $25,009
if received by Mr. Bryan would belong i
to his wife and children, all of which
Mr. Brynn and his wife well knew." i
The several clauses to which -ob- I
jet-lion is taken and the sealed letter j
and the letter to Mr. Bryan are de- j
dared to have been prepared at Lin- j
coin, Nebr., by Mr. Bryan and his j
wife, without the knowledge of Mrs.
Bennett, and without the knowledge
or presence of any of Mr. Bennett's
family or business associates.
NEW HAVE.", Conn., Dec. 11. â
Counsel for Mrs. Bennett, uidow of

statement of the reasons for the ap
peal recently taken from the decision
of Probate Judge Cleaveland in rela

notice of appeal it was briefly an
nounced that objection would be taken
to all of the bequests in the vrill pro

and still are. mines ' which ' have made- and

On t*e east lode, which lies', about, ten 'nlles

Some ventures in this county in the past in
the mother lode region have proven nonpro
ductive, chiefly because they were ill-advised
from their incipiency, but offsetting these fail
ures great success has attended properly di
rected effort In some of the newer concerns.
Among the notable examples may be mentioned
the reopening of the Central Eureka, mine after
an idleness of many years. This mine is now
down over 2000 feet in depth: is equipped with
complete surface plant, including' a fortj
stemp mill. Near Amador Cliy* the Bunker
Hill has been reopened in recent years by a
local company, and is at present building a
twenty-stamp mill, anticipating, an increase In
capacity within a short time. North of- the
Bunker Hill in the Fremont Consolidated, which
Was been reopened within the past four years.
A new mill haa recently been â¢ completed to
treat the ere developed In that property, which
comprises several consolidated mines, 'opened to
a depth of more than 1000 feet. In addition
to these, there are other less prominent mines
which are in the development stage, but which
promise well, iind besides these there are a
noiabfr of enterprises In the Incipient stage,
which ha\-e . a fair share -of premise for ths
future, upon being properly equipped and de
veloped.
The principal iplnes are from ten to four
teen miles from railroad points, four and a
half hours from Sacramento and nine and a
half hours from Kan Francisco. There art
many large companies engaged in quartz mtn-
Ing In this county, and in eptne of th?ee
depths of over 2um> feet have been^attajnÂ»o.
and one, the K >nnedy. at Jackxon. -has reached
2750 feet, vertical depth, below the croppings.
The development of these mines has abundant
ly proven the great depth to which these gold
bearing deposits extend, and at more than
SuQO feet in depth, on the vein, there Is no
diminution In size of the ore bodies. Indeed,
they ere larrer In the Kennedy mine than
those found at higher levels, while still con
taining value* which Insure a handsome j-ror-
It over working coats.
Opportunely, as a demonstration of
the mineral resources of Amador Coun
ty, a register of the county is issued
by the State Mining Bureau. Amador
ranked fourth in gold production
among the counties of California' In
1902. the total county output being
$1,629,151 in value. The total value of
all mineral products of the county for
1S02 was $1,679,113. Amador is eighth
in rank when the total mineral prod
ucts -for 1902 are considered. In addi
tion to go'.d the mineral output In
cluded silver, copper, coal and mar
ble. The copper bearing formations
are described as similar to those of
Calaveras County. Several copper
mines have been opened, but the lack
of proper transportation facilities has
hampered the industry.
Coal is being mined at several places
in the low foothills near lone. This is
a light variety of lignite. Large quan
tities of clay are shipped front Ama
dor to the potteries in the bay region.
The clay is of good quality and very
abundant. Among the county's prod
ucts are granite, sandstone and Iron
ore. A few diamonds have been found
near Volcano and Oleta in the gravels
of the ancient river channels that cross
the county. Concerning the mineral
deposits the State Mining Bureau bul
letin says:
rillNCIPAL DEPOSITS.
A3LADOR IN EVIDENCE.
The exhibit will be so arranged by
Mr. Aubury that general information
can be furnished about any mineral de
posit of which inquiries may be made.
In this way, a miner seeking capital
to assist in the development of his
property, if representative samples are
are furnished by him to the exhibit,
may succeed in Interesting the cap
ital he desires.
Those wishing 1 to donate minerals
should send them to Mining Depart
ment St. Louis Exposition, 29 Mar
ket street. Where the specimens do
not exceed twenty pounds in weight
Wells, Fargo & Co. will transport the
same free of charge from any railroad
point. Packages. above .that weight the
Southern Pacific or Santa Fe will
transport free of charge.
A department of information will
be established, where will be shown
maps of &JÂ» the mining counties, with
the Ideation of each mineral deposit
and a general description of the same,
and names and addresses of the owners
>and photographs of all the prominent
mines.
Special features will be exhibits of
tourmalines, chrysoprase, the new
gem "kunzite," turquoise and jewel
ers' materials. The borax, soda and
salt Industries will be well represented.
Niter will also be shown. Specimens
of niter are now being secured from
Death Valley. A large display of min
eral waters will also be made.
Models of stamp mills, concentra
tors, cyanide plants, gold dredgers,
quartz mines in operation, and meth
ods showing the manner of working
hydraulic and drift mines are In the
collection.
A comprehensive exhibit of Califor
nia oils, oil bearing formations and the
various by-products of petroleum will
be exhibited. With the oils, the only
complete collection in the State, will
be furnished a chemical analysis of
each sample, which will inform pos
sible investors of the properties con
tained. Sections of oiled roads, as
phalt paving, the concentration of ores
by oil and many exhibits will be ar
ranged so that the various uses to
which oil can be adapted will be
shown.
Nearly all the material for the im
mense composite arch of California
building stones, comprising marble,
pressed brick, terra cotta, palagonite,
etc., has been received and will be
ready for shipment January 1. This
arch will be one of the most striking
features in the department of mines at
St. Louis, and will fully represent Cal
ifornia building materials. Hundreds
of representative specimens of the va
rious minerals found in this State will
be shown. Special exhibits of clays,
together with the various articles man
ufactured, will be exhibited.
A large collection of cinnabar ores,
together with the native mercury, and
gold quartz specimens and nuggets
from the hydraulic and placer mines
will also be displayed.
COLLECTION OF OILS.
The California collection of minerals
to be sent to St. Louis, so reports
State Mineralogist Aubury, is nearly
complete. All specimens that have been
received have been classified, repacked
and labeled. Arrangements will be
made for shipping the entire collection
to St. Louis about January 1, 1901*
Specimens received in San Francisco
later than December 23 will run the
risk of not being exhibited, for it will
be impossible to make additional res
ervations of space.
The Teresa Quicksilver Mining Com
pany has secured a deed to 325 acres
of land in Santa Clara County, near
Edenvale, south of San Jose. -
Location notices, says the Mining
and Scientific Press, were filed one
week recently in Trinity County for five
lode claims and eight placer claims.
In view of the hopes entertained for
the extension of the niter industry in
California some figures contained in a
report of United States Consul Mans
field at Valparaiso relative to the out
put of nitrates of Chile is of interest.
The production and control is in the
hands of a syndicate, reports the of
ficial mentioned, and this syndicate has
issued a circulaT from which it appears
that for the year 1902-03 the exporta
tion quotas amounted to 1,663,436 tons.
On March 31, 1903. the' stock on the
coast was given at 269,923 tons, and
that abroad at 518,136 tonsâ a total of
788,059 tons. In course of half the year
five new works joined the association,
making in all twenty-four "officinas,"
or producing plants, operating under
the combination. The total exportation
for 1903-04 has been fixed at 1,625,000
tons.
According to the Angels Record the
Melones mine will add forty stamps to
its milling capacity soon.
The Welsh gold mine, near Copper
opolis, has resumed.
The Millspaugh Mining a'nd Milling
Company's plant at Millspaugh, Inyo

The Karma mine, near Mojave, is in
stalling a twenty-stamp mill and also a
cyanide plant.
The Zeibright mill, in Nevada Coun
ty, will have five additional stamps.
The report is circulated that" the
Marguerite mine, near Auburn, Placer
County, will resume operations.
The Nevada County Miner says that
work has been resumed' at the Old
Home Consolidated mine, at Moun,t
Vernon, near Blue Tent. The Osceola
mine, in the Rough and Ready district,
is being reopened.
-A two-foot vein of coal is reported
to have been discovered near Vacaville.
The American â¢ Dredge Company â¢ Is
constructing a dredger five miles below
Oroville on the east side of the Feather
River.
Considerable information is supplied
officially, by the bureau's , register of
Amador County relative to the methods
of mining that is of general interest to
mining men everywhere. Each mill
treats ores in its own way, no two fol
lowing exactly the same method. The
stamps are all heavy and drop from
five to six inches from 96 to 100 times
per minute. Amalgamation is practiced
both inside and outside of the batteries,
and the .pulp is conveyed by launders
to vanners and shaking tables for con
centration. The tailings from the van
ners in many instances go to slime
plants. The sulphides are either treat
ed by chlorination, being roasted in
reverberatory furnaces, with crude oil
for fuel, or are shipped to the smelters.
No sulphides are cyanided directly.

William CaldweyV'an attorney asso
ciated with A.; Pidwell in the Mills

dence of James de la Montanya, 260U
Point Lobos avenue. .
The father of Caldwell's wife died in
Los Angeles two days ago, and Mrs.
Caldwell started for that place last
Thursday to attend the funeral.
Caldwell and some friends dined with
the de la Montanyas on Thursday
evening, and he went to bed at 9:30
o'clock. James de la Montanya in
formed Deputy Coroner Michael Brown
yesterday that Caldwell requested to
be awakened at 7:30 o'clock yesterday
morning, and that he responded "All
right" to a knock at that hour.
Mr. de la Montanya made a second
visit to the room at 8:30 o'clock, and
hearing: Caldwell snoring concluded
that he was very much fatigued, and
â¢rent away. .
At 10 o'clock Mrs. de la Montanya
Morgue Surgeon Bacigalupi performed
the autopsy and found that" death" Mad,
been, caused by suffocation 'with illu

Obtain Money on Bogus Contract.
D. Rolleri, 303 Grant avenue, ob
tained a warrant .from Police Judge
Cabaniss yesterday for the- arrest of
L. Avaclni and r Frank Moresco on a
charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses. He alleges that the defend
ants called., upon him and showed him
an alleged contract- which they, had
entered into to pick grapes at the
Astl vineyards and he advanced th,em
$35 on September 14. .He. now 8ay3
he has discovered that the contract

From the testimc-ny of several dusky,
witnesses for the prosecution it was
gathered that on the night of Decem
ber 1, while a select terpsichorean func
tion was in progress, Mr. Stewart, pre
siding at the piano, laushed immoder
ately at some airy persiflage which
several young bloods were addressing
to Miss Irene Walker, and that Mr.
Slaughter, who was generally recog
nized as Miss Walker's "steady," en
tered the ballroom, unlimbered his six
shooter and fired twice at Mr. Stewart,
missing that gentleman, but inflicting
a severe wound in the leg of a small
boy who was in the vicinity.
The attorney for the defense attempt
ed to make it appear that for some time
a feud had existed between Mr. Stew
art and the defendant, and that Mr.
Slaughter's shot was the outcome of a
long period of persecution on the part
of the complainant and of self-repres
sion on the part of the defendant. This
plea of provocation will probably.be tbe
line of defense introdticed to-day, when
testimony in behalf ' of Mr: Slaughter,
will be heard.
Pacific street's most exclusive colored
society was numerously in evidence in
Judge Mogan's court while the case of.
the people vs. Claude Slaughter,
charged with shooting and attempting
to kill Georse Stewart, was in the
course of hearing.
Two chronic female vagrants were
given six months apiece by Mogan. One
of them, Bridget Boyle, was arrested
for soliciting alms from women pedes
trians on Market street and addressing
curses and filthy epithets to those that
ignored 1 her petition. The other one,
Jane Bellinger, has been such a famil
iar and unlovely figure. in the Police
courts that the Judge regretted he
could not make her Incarceration per
manent.
Bertrand Van Rensselaer, who claims
kin with the -oldest Knickerbockers in
Manhattan society, is the defendant on
a charge of , robbery sworn to by Miss
Uertha Linden of .1150 Guerrero street.
The list of articles described by Miss
Linden as having been purloined from
her residence by Bertrand consists
mostly of feminine apparel and Its to
tal value is estimated at $165.
"The members of the aristocracy of
two continents seem to be rivaling
each other in moral degeneracy," re
marked his Honor Mogan, to whom
had wafted intelligence of the appear
ance of a scion of Britain's nobility be
fere Neighbor Fritz.
Detectives Gibson and Bell were de
tailed on the case, and yesterday morn
ing- they found Mirovvsky in his room.
When they knocked on 'the dwr he
would not open it. They obtained an
entrance through another room and
found him crouched under the- bed.
Mirowsky has not yet been booked, as
the detectives say. there are several
other checks of a similar nature that
Mirowsky has cashed with business
men, which they are investigating.
Mirowsky came into prominence- dur
ing the early part of last year. He
blossomed out as a Russian Count; and
so fascinated Mrs. Fanny Rosenthal,
who has a cigar store at 418 Montgom
ery street, with his title and general
demeanor that they were married on
Hay 23 of that year. Love's dream was
soon dispelled and the following Sep
tember she secured a divorce from her
young husband. She alleged that his
claim to bea Russian Count was false
and that he had given* away to other
women or pawned all of her "diamonds
and other jewelry and had squandered
nearly all of the money leftrher by her
former husband. - â¢
For two weeks prior to December 2 j
Mirowsky was employed, as a clerk by i
the We? tern Fish Company, 510-512 j
Merchant street. He had access to the j
books 2nd papers of the company, and.^.
it is alleged, he collected money to the*
extent of $25.' Which he used for his own Â«
purposes, and was discharged. j
Last Saturday he called upqn F..L.
Greenberg. barber. . 324 Montgomery
street, and asked him to cash a check
for $35 drawn on the Central Trust ,
Company and purporting to be signed !
by J. B. Inguglla, manager of the!
Western Fish Company. Greenberg j
gave hlrrt $10 on the check, which he ]
artcefl Greenberg not to present at the j
bank till he heard from him again. J
Greenberj; did not hear from him and i
on Tuesday notified the police, after
discovering that lnguglia's signature
was a forgery. ;
On the same day Mirowsky cashed a
check for ?40 drawn on the Germania
National Bank and purporting to be
signed by Ingruglia, with Crum & Ma
son, cigar dealers. 914 Market street.
They were also told not to present the j
check at the bank till they heard from
h!m again, but as he failed to notify
them they presented the check at the
bank and were informed that Ingu
glia's signature was forged. They at
once rotted the police. .
Robert A- Mirowsky was arrested
yesterday morning in his room at 123
Turk street by Detectives. Ed Gibson!

Is the Man Who, Posing as a
Russian Count, Married Mrs.
Fanny Rosenthal Last Year
Tho two fellows were next heard of
at the residence of Mrs. Mary Smith,
716 Howard street, where Howard be
came involved in an altercation with a
cripple and with difficulty "was re
strained from shooting him. When told
that it would be beneath his dignity to
assault a man physically maimed How
ard flourished a "pistol and said, "I
would just as lief kill him as not."
Little's saloon was" the scene of the
third act.' When Howard entered the
place the inmates were Little himself,
J. McAuliffe, James Killodl, Michael
Driscoll and Defendant Owens, who sat
aloof from the others. Prior to enter-
Ing* the saloon Howard held converse
with an unknown boy and was over
heard to instruct him to remain out
side and keep, watch for "cops" while
his instructor was at work inside. This
was testified to. by a lad named G. J.
Schroeffel, who was loitering at the sa
loon d,oor. and to whom Howard gave
20 cents to "trot along about his busi
ness." When these preliminaries had
been , arranged Howard went Jnto the
saloon, drew a pistol and compelled
McAuliffe, Killodi and Driscoll to stand
against the wall with their hands up,
and he then went over to where Owens
was sitting and spectacularly com
manded him to' hoist his hands and
preserve silence on penalty of death.
, ?Then, after surveying the line of men
ranged against the wall, the bold high
wayman said: "Oh. I guess you;bums
have- nothing^ after which he de-voted
his. attention' exclusively "to -Little and
robbed that 'person of airtne'^SttHrey he
had. Then, with a final threat to the
Â¦tl\rtfe "wallBo'wers," aSjOne^of the at
torneys- 'facetiously ;Â¦ allud"e&>.Â»t o % McAu-
Jiffe&KJilib'di and Driscoll, the -robber

Policeman Skelly told of how.. he saw
Howard running' and commanded him
to stop, and of . how Howard replied
'811(1 was then pursued, shot
in' the leg- and driven under the gun
of-. Policeman.'^ Murphy, who "got the
dcop.on hlm'Vf^aJl of which was printed
at the time of the happening. 'The de
fense" will be taken up .'next Tuesday.
Details pertaining to the "holding up"
of William .Little's saloon, at 760 How
ard street, on the night of Decem
ber 6 were freely related yesterday in
Judge Mogan's court, where Harry
Howard and W. H. Owens were on pre
liminary examinatipn for the offense.
Howard. was arrested at the time of the
robbery and Owens was subsequently
taken in as an accomplice.
The testimony served to expose the
movements of the defendants prior to
the time of and during the "stand up."
Howard and Owens were seen that
evening among the audience of a street
evangelist at Third and Mission streets,
and Howard' seemed to be so much af
fected by the words of the exhorter
that he followed the procession to
church, while Owens remained;on the
broad path that sinners find it easiest
to follow.

The defendant gasped, glared incred
ulously at' the. bench, opened his lips
as if to voice a protest, but apparently
underwent a sudden change of mind,
for he bowed with courtly grace ahd
said: Â¦ ...
"Much obloiged." .
"You're entirely welcome," responded
the Judge, bowing in return.
"But Oi'd have ye to undherstand,"
shouted the defendant, as the bailiff
grasped his arm, "that this is an out
rage for which ye'll suffer. Ye cawn't
sind me to Jail laegelly, nor can ye keep
me there afther ye've slnt me."
"Bring him back here," said the
Judge to the bailiff.
When the order was complied with,
and' the tall figure of 'the claimant to
one of the proudest titles in the British
peerage, stood again at the bar, the
Judge addressed" him as follows:
' "Edward Horn, alias Lord Godolphin
Osborne, Duke of Westminster, the
duty devolves upon me-^bf punishing
you for willful contempt of this court.
I sentenced you to sixty days' impris
onment because I thought you might
prefer the holiday fare at the County
Jail to the Incertitude and. inevitable
hardships attendant. upon begging
nickels and dimes from plain Ameri
can citizens imbued with the holiday
spirit of giving. But, instead of appre
ciating my motive and , relishing your
sentence, you loudly and impudently
accuse me of exceeding the authority
vested in me to punish you as a va
grant. So. now, without ignoring the
possibility of my. action embroiling two
greatnatlons In sanguinary conflict, I
must increase your sentence to six
months.".
His Grace appeared to be dazed to
dumbness as he" was "led away.
accint." " Â¦
"Ah, I see. And ndw, my lordâ or
Shall I say your grace, in recognition
of the ducal part of your double bar
reled title?" â¢
"Ayether will do," was the magnani
mous concession.
"Well, your grace', may I inquire as
to how you came to be arrested and
charged with vagrancy?"
"A bobby's mlstaikeâ that's all. Ye
hev.uo roight to punish me. ye knoaw."
"The. charge has been pretty clearly
proved, while your defense is extreme
ly inadequate. At the risk of starting
an international complication ,1 must
send you to Jail"â
"But ye cawn't" â
"For sixty days."
"Lord Godolphin Osborne, Duke of
Westminster, .London. England," was
the legend penciled on a scrap of paper
and oassed un to Police Judge Fritz
yesterday,. morning- by a, tall and seedy
looking mrih who stood accused of va
grancy.
"What's this?" inquired the court, al
ternately scanning the dc-cument and
its author. * Â¦'â¢;<;
"Me rale name an' tolt'.e," was the
laconic answer. t
Â¦"Pardon me, your lordship, for fall
ing to notice your distinction at first
glance," said the court, apologetically,
"but vou must concede that you do
not !c-ok the part. Besides, you are
registered on the docket here as plain
Edward Horn. How did "that come to
pass?"
"A stoopid blundther; on the pawt uv
wan uv yer consthabularyi doan't ye

dialect that savored of a cross between
"coster" English and Dublin* brogue.
"Yc-ur card here," suggested . the
Judge, "pronounces you an Eiglshman,

Coroner Leland held an inquest ye 3 .
terday upon the bodies of Vf. D. Ran
kin and Fred Axelbrigbt. Rank in was
killed by falling from the fifth floor of
the new Merchants' Exchange building
on 23, and Axelbright was
killed on December 9 by falling off the
seventh floor of the same building.
When Rankin fell to his death Axnt
brlght was standing near by. and It fa
a singular circumstance that Axel
bright, an hour or two before he was
killed, was served with a subpena to
attend the inquest on Rankin's body,
which had been set for yesterday. On
the day of Rankin's death one of the
Coroner's deputies remarked to Axel-"
bright that structural ironwork was a
hazardous calling. Aselbrlght replied
lightly that it was not at all dangerous
to an experienced man. but he re
marked to a fellow workman that he
expected to go that way himself some
day.
The testimony in Rankin's case was
that he was standing on the last steel
girder at the south extremity of the
fifth floor and had a monkeywrench in
his right hand, while he supported his
balance by throwing his left arm
around a steel upright. Workmen were
engaged In putting a girder in place,
and when everything was ready Ran
ldn said, "It's all right, boys." He had
withdrawn his left arm from the up
right and was sustaining hi3 balance
with the wrench, but as he. spoke the
wrench slipped and he tumbled head
long downward.
Albright was engaged .in similar
work on the seventh floor when a hoist
ing derrick fell to the flqoring. Fearing
that it was. about to strike him Axel
bright changed his position and lost his
balance, falling into a pile of half-hard
mortar in the basement. He died In the
Central Emergency Hospital half an
hour later.

both cases. ...

gibbons has- announced an inteationof
contesting the right of the tw<J t "sisters
to the; property intends to have
a "guardian . appointed ; for Mrs. Eliza
Stoddard, on j the ground 'Â¦ that i she is
an Incompetent. - This move. Â¦ will be
fought bitterly by ; Attorney Duffey. on
behalf of "Mrs. Stoddard.
Believing that Mrs. Eliza &toddard
was imposed upon by Dr. Joseph M.
Toner when she executed a deed to
him for an undivided one-third inter
est In an improved piece of real estate
at Thirteenth and Harrison streets. At
torney D. M. Duffey is endeavoring to
have the woman's conveyance set
aside.
Mrs. Stoddard is a sister, of David
Fitzgibbons, who died In this city on
November J2 last. Shortly before his
death he was adjudged an incompe
tent, and- the Union Trust Company
was appointed his guardian. - His prop
erty, consisting of the. improved real
estate at Thirteenth and Harrison
streets, was divided equally between
his sisters, .Mrs. Eliza Stoddard and
Mrs. Mary McCann. The latter is an
inmate of St. Mary's Hospital and is
85 years old. Thursday last she was
adjudged an incompetent and the Pro
, bate Court appointed Edmond V. Mad
! den her guardian! Some time previous
ly to this, it is claimed by the attorney
for Mrs. Stoddard, Toner prevailed on
Mrs. McCann to deed to her sister all
of her interest In the property left by
her brother. Then, it ! is claimed, he
induced airs. Stoddard to deed him one
third of. the property without any con
sideration. Mrs. Stoddard says'she did
not realize that she was signing -away
any of her property when the convey
ance was presented by Dr. Toner, and
that. she received no -consideration in
return' for the execution, of the deed.
She says that Dr. Toner was a warm
friend of her dead brother and treated
him during his illness. Knowing this
relationship, she said she and her sis
ter reposed confidence in him and
signed any instrument he offered.
Dr. Toner claims that the property
was transferred to him In payment for
medical services rendered . to David
Fitzgibbon and to the two sisters,
whom he has treated for several years.
He says his services much "overbalance
the value of the property conveyed to
him. which is said to be worth/ about
$3000. ;

Physician Says That Medical
Services 3Iore Than Balance

BEQAL SHOES. _ '^^^^^
/ . Â¦ . . Â¦ , ...
people in the shoe trade say the
gro^vth of the Regal Shoe business
has been marvelous.
Mebbe so. P'raps it has.
But listen a minuteâ we know the growth has been
rapidâ from a mere idea in 1892, to the most extensive
retail shoe business in the world in 1903. Remarkable^
yes. But the marvel to us is that it has taken so long.
The whole problem has been to make people believe the
truth, ancf -it is positively astonishing how hard that is to do.
; . We make the very best shoes that can be produced
at any priceâ and we sell* them direct from tannery to
wearer at $3.50 a pair. For ten years we've been ham-
mering in that fact till it would certainly seem as if it
ought to have been driven clear through and clinched on
the other side. .
V s-i>= ftgwt that about a million people have been
convinced. That is about the number of Regal wearers.
There are nine millions more who ought to have been
convinced long ago.
Now, if one million people continuously buy Regal
Shoes, it must mean that they are satisfied with style, [ fit,
finish, comfort, wear â¢ and price. , That is a sensible, rea-
sonable, inevitable conclusion.
Now tell usâ why should you go on paying $5 and
Â§6 a pair for less real style and value than -you can get
inRegalsat$3.50?
Think it over. r
There are 6o Regal Storesâ 20 of them in Greater New ,
York, where the styles originate. The new styles are on sale in
our San Francisco store at the same time as in the New York
stores. Other dealers get the same styles a year later.

RIPENING OF ORANGES.
TWO prominent witnesses from Southern California
have come into court to testify relative to the time
when it is possible to ship ripe oranges from the
counties of the State south of Tehachapi. The Eos An
geles Herald is one and the other is the San Bernardino
Sun. The people in the orange growing counties thatiie
north of Tehachapi will peruse the testimony with inter
est. ' Â¦
â¢ "It is impossible," says the Los Angeles Herald, "to
send thoroughly prime oranges to the Eastern market
from this section available for Christ,mas.'.'
The San Bernardino Sun says : "That oranges will . not
be ripe for heavy shipments for the Christmas markets
was the unanimous report brought in by:dire'ctors 'of the
San. Bernardino County Fruit Exchange, which met in
the new Court-street offices of the exchange yesterday
afternoon. Nearly all the districts were represented by
directors, and the same report, that the fruit is slow in
coloring, came from. all directions."
The Los Angeles Herald says: "The, orange crop for
the present season will^ be the largest, and it promises to
be one of the best on. record. It will not begin to moye
in large quantities until after the ; holidays, by whichuime
a ; part of it will be fully, matured."

FIRMSâ Call reader, Berkeley, CaL
This department does not give any In
formation as to the financial standing
of any firm, individual or association.
THE Presidential candidacy of Mr. William Ran
dolph Hearst not only adds to the gayety of nations,
but induces an interesting study of the chameleon
in politics. It is known, of course, and by all men, that
the chameleon is a member, of the lizard family, a degen
erate -descendant of the mighty saurians. It is also
known to paleontologists that the word saurian comes
from saur. or dirt, and that the saurians were the animals
that lived in the dirt.
The chameleon takes on the color of whatever he lies
on. You meet a chameleon one day basking on garbage
and he looks like garbage. Next day he is sunning him
self on a lichen-covered rock and looks like a lichen.
But we are not writing a treatise on the paleozoic age,
but intend- merely to address ourselves to the chameleon
in politics. Not long ago Mr. Hearst, in furtherance of
his Presidential candidacy, published of himself in his
own newspapers that he Vis the implacable foe of in
herited wealth.": That day he was basking on union
labor and faithfully took on its color. It is true that
some surprise was felt by those who knew that his own
wealth was inherited, but a little* thing lil^e that makes
no difference. (
Now he causes it to be published in his own news
papers that as â¢"Mr. Bryan, who leads the extreme liber
als* of the party, is out by his own declaration, and Mr.
Cleveland, the leader of the conservative or wealthy ele
ment, is now impossible by his own declaration, there
should be found a man who combines the elements of
wealth, so that legal wealth in the country may feel that
it will not be unjustly assaulted, and one whose personal
sympathies are with the masses of the people on the great
measures necessary for their" prosperity." They solve
this f^or. themselves by saying 'that Hearst embodies these
elements more than any other man now before the coun
try. .0
- That is the color of 'Mr. Hearst as the conservative suc
cessor of Cleveland. He takes on the'hue of wealth. But
the whole question is not solved. He said before that he
was the implacable foe of inherited wealth and now that
he is the champion of, legal- wealth. Are we to under
stand from this that inherited' wealth is illegal, that it
belongs to others than its' heirs? If so, to whom?
Thc-answer concerns many who are helpless against
chameleon schemes for their spoliation. All over the
country, are widows and orphan children who have in
herited property. Much or little, it is their wealth. It
is cared for by v trust companies under probate control.
As Mr. Hearst is the champion of legal wealth only
and the implacable foe of inherited wealth, what manner
of attack will he make upon the estate of the widow and
.orphan? Will it be outlawry and confiscation? What
will the chameleon do with it? .
If out of the saur, the dirt, is to come the successor of
Cleveland, representing the wealthy element, and the foe
of inherited property, which' Mr." Bryan opposed by say^
ing that he attacked the interest of -those who- lived ori
fixed incomes, will the watchman lift hisÂ«voice and please
tell us what of the night ? '
A CHAMELEON CANDIDATE:
The curious affairs- and devious ways of the County
Clerk have at last become subjects of diligent inquiry
by the 'Grand Jury. There is always 6ne distinguishing
disadvantage to a post mortem investigation. The sub
ject is always fortunately dead, and the public is not
spurred to interest by a prospect of any revelation of
novelty in the case.
Curious Cures.
BY W. R. C. LATSON. M. IX
(Editor Health Culture Marazlne. New York.)
(Copyright. 15*03, by Joseph's. Bowles.)
The history, of medicine is the his
tory at once of human error and hu
man progress. In no other field have
prejudice and superstitutien held more
powerful and more deadly sway. In
none have there been more arduous re
search and unflagging effort to achieve
the object aimed at. the cure of human
weakness and disease.
As Bacon said, "The complexity of
the universe exceeds the subtlety of
man," and In no respect is this more
strikingly true than in regard to the
human body. In spite of laboric-us /ind
painstaking study by thousands of de
voted students, we know but little of
the human body. If it be true to-dayâ
as 'all students of, physiology must ad
mitâthat, compared with astronomy,
physics or mathematics, the science of
physiology is merely in its infancy, how
much more must it have been true in
those days when men had to depend for
thtir information upon practitioners
unaided by the light of modern science.
In addition to entire ignorance of the
organism he. was supposed to repair,
the physician all through the ages has
been at another great disadvantage.
His very anxiety to heal the patient
has been a stumbling block, and has
led him to seek always the strange and
curious through his own superstitious
hope that in some mystical manner
such agents would effect what mole
commonplace measures would not.
Another cause of erroT has "arisen in
consequence of the fact that every dis
order is in reality a duality â a condi
tion presenting two distinct although
interdepende.t phases. First of all, we
have the actual physical derangement,
the disease; secondly, we have the pa
tient's mental state, . his own concep
tion of his condition. Any remedy
which affects the patient's mind has
an immediate influence upon the bodily
condition. - If he be encouraged and
made more sanguine there is an im
mediate Invigoration of all vital activi
ties, and recovery is facilitated. If by
any means the patient be disheartened
or depressed, there is immediate and
marked increase of all unfavorable
symptom?, and the chances of recov
ery are lessened by just so much. A
remedy, then, which is in. itself quite
useless", or even harmful, may by ap
pealing to the patient's imagination, so
as to arouse anticipation of relief, con
duce to his recovery. The same drug
given to a patient who lacked faith in
it and in the doctor who prescribed it
would be quite unavailing or harmful.
We can readily understand how the
doctor of the olden times, finding that
strange and weird prescriptions pro
duced good effects and quite ignorant
of the physical principle involved,
should have been led to believe that
the curative power lay in the strange
ness of his compound and should have
Btriven to make his prescription even
more and more strange and impressive.
Dr. ' Ambrose Parey, a, famous Eng
lish doctor, published In 1579 a book on
medical practice which was for many
years an accepted authority on medi
cine and surgery^. One of the remedies
on which he places greatest confidence
as a medicament of general application
Is "mummie." '^Mummie" he describes
as "a liquor flowing from the aromatic
embalmments of dead bodies, which
become dry and hard."
Parey waa evidently a believer in
water cure, and had some dim idea of
tbe b&neflcial results sometimes follow
ing physiologic shock. His methods,
howerer.'-j were rather drastic. After
descanting on the value of certain
measures he goes on to say: "I would
not cast the patients out of the window,
but would rather cast', them/suddenly,
and thinking of Â¦ no such thing, into a
great "cistern filled with cold water,
with their ; heads foremost. â¢ Neither
would I take them; out, until they had
drunk a great quantity of water, ,00

That astute old gossiper about things
as they, are in Europe, Marquis de Fon
tenoy, thinks that there is a pretty
kettle of fish simmering in Bulgaria.
He says:
"The fact that a family council
should have been in session last week
in Sofia, in which not only Prince Fer
dinand's mother, the aged Princess
Clementine of Saxe-Coburg, and his
elder brother. Prince Philip, but also
all the other adult mstlc members of
the Coburg family took part, indicates *
that some very grave subject has been
under discussion. It is the first time
since Ferdinand has been on the Bul
garian throne that there has' ever been
such a gathering of the members of
the Saxe-Coburg family, at Sofia. The
question which the Prince 13 under
stood to have submitted to his rela
tives was as to the policy of his abdi
cating his crown in favor of his 10
year-old boy. Prince Boris, his own po
sition at Sofia having become unten
able. Until a year ago he was able in
a measure to rely upon the loyalty of
his thoroughly up-to-date, .well-drilled
and, well-equjpped army. But his atti
tude throughout the troubles in Mace
donia have to such a degree destroyed
his popularity among his troops that
instead of constituting a source of
strength and security they .have be
come a serious danger to his throne.
There are a very large number of
Macedonians among the officers of the
Bulgarian army, and those who are not
Macedonians themselves have
Macedonian relatives and 1 affiliations.
Thanks to this, almost th6 entire corps
of officers is bitterly incensed against
the Prince. They openly denounce him.
The malcontents are too numerous to
arrest or cashier, and their sentiments
may* best be described by the mani
festo which has been circulated among
them, which runs thus: 'Comrades,
every man with a Bulgarian heart and
breast must feel that the role forced
upon U3,by Prince Ferdinand has dis
graced us in the eyes of all Europe. It
is only a Prince who is no Bulgarian
that falls to understand how he has
thus dragged not only the honor, but
the future, of Bulgarians in the dust." "
'A Serious Detail.
In the life of a police reporter some
curious incidents happen. On one oc
casion while police headquarters was
at the City Hall a message was re
ceived about 1 o'clock in the morning
that a lion had escaped from a cage in
a circus at Central Park. The report
ers of the three morning papers hur
ried tor the scene. They entered the
park by a side gate on Eighth street
and were followed by a boy about 16
years of age. S' >["Â¦
Inside the tent the circus men, each
carrying a torch, were diligently
searching for the escaped lion. As the
reporters and the .boy stood watching
the waving torches it suddenly dawned
upon them that if the lion came their
way something serious might happen.
They had just 'concluded to return to
the hall when there was a rush made
by the men with the torches in their
direction and an animal sprang against
the canvas.
With a yell the reporters and the
boy scurried away to places of safety.
One of the reporters climbed to the top
of the band wagon and as he climbed
up the boy grabbed hold of his foot.
The reporter,, thinking it was the lion,
gave a despairing yell that could be
heard for* blocks. "Thatihad the effect
of increasing the speed of the other
two, one of whom went hand over hand
to the top of a telephone pole; the
other ran till he reached a saloon on
the corner of Eighth and Market
streets and, rushing in, he caused a
stampede by shouting out that an es
caped lion from the circus was after
him.
, It was subsequently learned that the
lion was captured and put back in the
cage without trouble and that the ani
mal that scared the reporters was a
big Newfoundland dog that had been
mistaken for the king of beasts. But
it was many moons before the newspa
per men completely recovered.
Costly Modest v.
- A well-known San Francisco politi
cian in years gone by lost a very fat
and lucrative position by his brusque
way of showing his modesty.
This man was known as the "Major"
and during the campaign of General
Grant he contributed much to the elec
tion of that distinguished man to the
President's chair. The then United
States Senator from California recom
mended the "Major" for the position of
United States Marshal for the Northern
Di&tiict. In due time the "Major" re
ceived a letter from the Senator in
forming him of his good luck In secur
ing the position and suggested that It
would be well if the "Major" would
visit the national capital and become
personally acquainted with President
Grant. The invitation was accepted and
in due time the "Major" arrived in
Washington and, with a letter of in
troduction, presented himself at the
White House, where he was most gra
ciously received and personally thanked
by the President for his share in elect
ing him.
"Major Blank," said President Grant,
"in view of what you have done for
the success of the Republican party In
California. I have prepared your com
mission as United States Marshal.? 7 Â¦'
"Mr. President," said the "Major,"
straightening himself up and throwing
out his chest, "It was not I who did
this; it was the man 'round the corner."
Grant looked up at the "Major" with a
scowl ; on his face and said:
"Very well; I will send for t-h-a-t
man 'round the corner and reward him
for his services." Grant stood up and
left the room and the "Major" returned
minus his commission.
Great Railroad Fights.
1ST EARL D. BERRY.
(FonnÂ»r Kailrcad Editor New York Time* and
Xw York Sun.)
tCopvrtpht, J4*O". by Joeeph B. Bowie*. >
Recent Wall street rumors of a
Rockefeller-Cassatt fight for control of
tbe Pennsylvania Railroad bring to
mind other strenuo-ug contests for the
possession of great railroad properties.
In the case of the Pennsylvania, offi
cial denials that there is any attempt
to change the control are emphatic and
explicit, but some other great fights
fpr railway control have passed into
history. Just as the large buying of
Pennsylvania shares in the stock mar
ket led to the reports that the Rocke
fellers were seeking to acquire the
property, so a sudden and abnormal de
mand for Northern Pacific stock early
in May, 1901, indicated to Wall street
that "somebody was after that prop
erty."
. .
The main facts of the Northern Pa
cific fight are doubtless still fresh in
the public mind. An important detail
is recalled in the annual report of the
Union Paci " Railroad, issued a few
days ago, wherein the statement is
made that JS2,491,OO0 of Oregon Short
Line bonds have been issued to cover
the cost of the purchases of Northern
Pacific stock which were made by E.
H. Harriroan and his friends during
those exciting May days of two years
ago. This large sum represents a ma
jority of the Northern Pacific's $155.
000,000 of stock. Mr. Harrjman, through
The banking house of Kuhn,. Loeb &
Co.. deliberately set out to buy control
of this great property away from J.
Pierpont Morgan and -James J. Hill,
because the Union Pacific was denied
participation in the joint purchase of
the Chicago. Burlington and Quincy
system by the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern companies. Mr. Har
riman started to buy Northern Pacific
Â¦when it was selling at about 125. His
movements were quick and energetic,
and h<? took the controlling manage
ment of that road completely" by sur
prise. Both sides bc-ught fast and fu
riousiv for two days, forcing the price
ud to 51000 a share and so effectually
'Â¦cornering" the stock that a very se
rious panic threatened. Many brokers
sold Northern Pacific stock that they
did rot possess, and widespread ruin
would have followed had not J. P. Mor
gan fz Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. mu
tually aere^d to ease up on the con
tracts. Although Mr. Harriman suc
ceeded in acquiring a majority of all
the shares, the victory was technically
with the Morgan party, which held a
majority of the common stock, in which
the voting power alone was vested.
Some of the Gould millions gave Mr.
Harriman temporary aid in this great
fight, and it is interesting to contem
plate the important 'part that the
Gould millions have played in other
railway controversies. Jay Gould on
two occasions had to fight for the
Union Pacific which Mr. Harriman now
controls. The most remarkable contest
with xvhirh the elder Gould was con
nected, however, was the Erie Railroad
war. It was fn 1867 that Commodore
Vanderbilt undertook to buy the Erie
road. This property had become the
football of Wai! Ftreet. through the
speculative tendencies of Daniel Drew,
and Vanderbilt thought that it would
be easy for him to buy a majority of
the stock. Jay Gould and James Fisk
Jr. were associated with Mr. Drew in
the cc-r.trol of Erie, and when they
found that Commodore Vanderbilt's
millions were being poured into Wall
street to acauire Erie stock they se
cretly, and contrary to an order of the
court, issued 100,000 shares of new
stock. More than 510,000.000 was paid
by purchasers of this 'stock," which
had no va!id existence. Vanderbilt took
it in $1,000,000 block?, and when the
trick -was exposed the price of Erie
dropped so fast that the commodore's
friends thought he was ruined. Power
ful financial influences came to his aid,
and he soon succeeded in gettingon his

birthday of Hon. Jesse D. Carr of Salinas, and now
we record his death, which occurred at his home in
Salinas yesterday. His career, j beginning in Tennessee

. Here for more than a lialf century he was a vital force
and most picturesque figure. A. man of iron will, he was
attracted by difficulties and never flinched from embar
rassments. /This led him'into fields- that he won alone,
because weaker men were fepelledby the Â¦hindrances to
success. The soul of hospitality- and of the, most t genial
social qualities, he had the spirit of a soldier, the suavity
of a gentleman, the address and resources of a diplomat.
He was "welcomed in the White House by every Presi
dent from Taylor to Cleveland arid, without regard to
party. politics, his advice was sought by 'them all.
General Taylor always said that he won the battle of
Buena Vista by a diversion created by Mr. Carr/ and
during the Presidency of old Rough and Ready Carr was
a most welcome and trusted friend at the White House.
With all his influence in and knowledge of politics he
was not an office seeker.. The most important public sta
tion he ever filled wasÂ«as the organizer of the customs
service in San Pfancisco, to which he was chosen that
the Government might' have the benefit of his keen-genius
for' business organization.
In his long career he championed every good cause
mightily with his purse and his energy, and ;he fought
every bad one with the courage of a crusader. His
friends knew him for everything that was gentle and
kindly and helpful and his enemies as a tireless, resource
ful and straight fighter. He was about the last of the
mighty men of early California. He was the contem
porary and companion of Gwin and Fremont and his
long life of war and peace, of activity projected with
force into many fields, ends with his honor unscarred
and as stainless as a star..

the London Chronicle. Though we now
learn that it is not true that the Pope
superintended the work of putting out
the fire at the Vatican, the German Em
peror was certainly well to the front
when there was an outbreak in the
new palace a year ago. King Edward,
too. displayed the utmost energy when
a fire took place at Marlborough House
in July, 1863. He took command of tha
water taps and superintended the fill
ing and passing of jugs and buckets,
and the flames not abating he took fur

arrived with the brigade he found the
King in his shirtsleeves and as black

the flooring to get at the seat of the
fire.

yellow man has been accentuated by a
sad experience. . Two of the young phy
sician's friends conceived the idea that
it would be a jolly good joke to give
Tillman a day with the Mongols. One
Saturday afternoon the pair spent sev
eral hours in Chinatown engaging Chi
nese boys as house servants to report
Sunday at the Tlllman home, In the
Mission. " . :
Bright and early Sunday morning the
Chinese contingent began to show.

the number grew and grew. The neigh
bors wondered, and Tlllman, beside
himself with rage, knew not what to
do to stem the flood /of invading
"chinks." It was a steady procession
all day. To protect himself Tillman
borrowed' a neighbor's Great Dane, but
the canine only tore up the flower beds,
and encouraged by fondlings from the
timorous Chinese let the stream con
tinue to the door. *'f
Anywhere from fifty to a hundred

very existence of the Rio Grande road.
This was war, in which physical
force and firearms were resorted to as
well as *\-jery expedlentof the law. The
strife, which extended over a period of
two years, was started by the forcible
seizure of a narrow mountain pass by
a gang of men-in the. employ of the
Atchison road. This pass afforded the
only available railroad route through
the mountains to the great mining re
gion of Leadville, in Colorado. Both
roads were determined to extend to
Leadville. and President. Strong of the
Atchison and President Palmer of the
Denver and Rio Grande each recognized
the importance of securing control of
the Royal Gorge, and made their plans
accordingly. A small force of Atchison
men reached the mouth of the pass a
few hours before their rivals one morn
ing in April, 1S78. A dozen shovelfuls
of- dirt were thrown up and formal
declaration was made that the con
struction oÂ£ the Canyon City and San
Juan Railroad had begun.
"When the chief 'engineer of the Den
ver and Rio Grande reached the en
trance to the pass with 200 men and a
construction outfit he found scarcely a
dozen Atchison representatives on
guard. Thinking it an easy matter to
intimidate this - small force, the Rio
Grande party started to march into the
gorge. The leaders, . however, looked
over the muzzles of rifles and revolvers
in the hands of men of well-known de
termined character. Seeing that an adr
vance meant bloodshed the larger party
withdrew and left the handful of Atchi
son men in possession for the time be
ing. Subsequently armed bodies com
prising several hundred men were
marched to the scene, but nothing more
than threatening . demonstrations en
sued. Meanwhile the courts of Colorado
were ke?t busy by innumerable legal
tactics. While the controversy was at
its fiercest the Denver and Rio Grande
became impoverished, and President
Palmer was obliged to lease his road
to the Atchison company. The owners
of the Rio Grande road speedily became
dissatisfied with the Atchison policy to
ward their property and took aggres
sive steps to break the lease and re
claim the road.

TALKING OFFICERS
SEVERAL army and navy officers in recent years
have talked too much. Some of them have em
barked on the rough sea of domestic questions and,
like General Funston, have talked themselves, to an en
forced standstill. Others, more ambitious, -have -sailed
on the broader ocean of international questions and
have undertaken to create issues with other countries
embarrassing to our Government.
In regard to this practice a question of. veracity has
arisen between General Mac Arthur of the regular army
and Colonel Jones of the Hawaiian militia. s In a report
to Governor Carter, .in which he, enlarged upon the im
portance of the island militia, the colonel said he had
the assurance of General MacArthur that we arc on the
eve of a war with Germany. This was accompanied by
an exposition of Pan-Germanic spirit to the effect' that
the Kaiser was forcibly promoting a substantial union of
all men of German blood wherever domiciled to support
by sympathy and uprising the spread of the empire. In
support of this view .General MacArthur was reported as
lamenting that the Germans in the United States stu
diously avoided enlisting for the Spanish war, and he put
this down with other signs and tokens in the political earth
and sky to demonstrate that wherever a German goes he
carries the empire and its militarism with him. j He was
reported as disturbed also by the fecundity of the.Ger
mans, which was represented as deliberately planned to
create a surplus population for the purpose of. migrating
and carrying the empire with it. v .' V V 'Â¦
Colonel Jones two days after all this portentous
prophecy was given to him wrote it down and reported it
to the Governor of Hawaii, intending thereby to create
a thrill that would inure to the benefit of the militia.
Now comes General MacArthur declaring that the re
port exaggerated and distorted what he did say, but he
refrains from stating how it looked, and was worded be
fore it was refracted inthe prism of Colonel Jones' mili
tary enthusiasm. Jones comes into focus long enough
to say that he did not intend his report of the conversa
tion to be made public and is supported' by" Governor
Carter, who says the publication was unauthorized and
occurred through a misunderstanding. This moves, us
to offer the advice that officers do not talk with -tattlers
and that tattlers do not tattle to officers.'
The net result of the affair is that if the expressions in
regard V 3 Germany and the Germans were not; the
ments of General MacArthur they were the views of Colo
nel Jones, so that they are only one remove; any way.
It is not for regular, officers of the army or navy to cre
ate international complications by walk or' conversation.
Our system of government wisely confides international
affairs to the executive, who should not be embarrassed
by military subordinates. Nor is it the function of a
militia colonel in Hawaii or elsewhere to sniff the battle
afar off and thereby begin the embroiling of his country
with a friendly foreign power. (
As far as the Germans in the United States are con
cerned they seek naturalization as soon as the law per
mits a^d.jare .amo,ag. ( qur best alien borri citizens. The
first great migration" of Germans hither followed the
revolution of 1848. They came from Schleswig-Holstein
and Bavaria mostly, but there were, many Prussians.
Their leaders, Schurz, Sigel, Ottendorfer, Hassurek and
others, became Americans in spirit and purpose. They
set the pace for all Germans who have followed them,
and it is probable that there^ are among us none who
have cherished in greater purity American sentiment.
They did what some other aliens have failed to do. They
left behind them the politics, the jealousies and conten
tions, the grudges and revenges of the Old World, and
addressed themselves with spirit and intelligence to the
public affairs and higher politics of their adopted coun
try, as they did to its best industries and larger enter
prises.
This :s not saying that they forgot the Fatherland, but
they remembered it not for the glories of its dynasty nor
the glitter of its imperial pageantry, but for its schools,
its homes of virtue, its students, scholars and philoso
phers, whose patience and genius had pushed scientific
investigation, to thej ultimate, had turned a searching lens
upon the dead past and brought out of it the facts that
overthrow modern superstition and emancipate human
reason. Tbeyj realized* that Germany is greater than
the empire, better than its, armies," stronger than its
power, with a jurisdiction in the wide republic of
thought and letters, which mere political empire can
never achieve. Because they come with such motives,
illustrated by such conduct, they have been fellowshiped
by Americans, and their assimilation has raisedthe power
of our blood and strengthened/every sinew of the nation.
To say that such a people are, the sinister agents of the
empire, living among .us physically. but apart from us
in purpose and sentiment, using the broader opportunity
of our free and splendid institutions only to gather, the
substance and gain the strength to assist in their over
throw, is to utter slander, whether the expression be that
of a regular army officer or the hitherto unheard of colo
nel of an island militia.

as the result of the sale of timber lands
in this State acquired by his father
thirty years ago at the time of the
Jay Cooke failure. Charlemagne Tower
Sr. was originally one of the heavy
holders of Northern Pacific stock.
At the time of the Cooke failure he is
said to have exchanged a large block
of stock for timber lands along the
main line between Tacoma and Port
land. After his death and up to a few
years agro the tract taken entire was
offered at J5 per acre. Negotiations for
its purchase by Tacoma lumbermen fell
through and the price was^ advanced
to $10. At laat the idea of disposing
of the estate in one transaction was
abandoned and it was put on the mar

SACRAMENTO. Dec. 1Lâ While criti
cism is still ringing in the ears of the
Jurors who voted to let Convict J. H.
Wood off with light punishment for the
murder of Guard W. L. Cotter, plans
are under way which are intended to
bring the desperate Folsom escape to
the gallows. Wood is undergoing im
prisonment at Folsom on his original
life sentence, so his conviction on a
charge of murder in the second degree,
with a term of imprisonment as the.
penalty, meant nothing whatever to
him. But it is known that Wood was
one of the escaped convicts who at
Placerville. El Dorado County, killed
Militiamen Rutherford and Jones at
the Grand Victory, mine.
District Attorney Seymour said to
day that be was convinced that the
desperado's trail from the time he left
Pilot Hill to the time of the tragic
scene at the Grand Victory mine was
perfectly plain. . In company with Dis
trict Attorney Peters 'of El Dorado
County, Seymour visited ~ thÂ© ground
and examined witnesses,- with the re
sult they have secured evidence enough
to warrant them in proceeding with
the trial of Wood for murder at ' the
county seat of El Dorado County.

Charles Bright, alias Sanfa Claus,
clothed in the flaming red robe that
Santa Claus can wear without bciag
considered out of date, and with long
beard, white as the driven snow, .came
from behind the great tree with great
er things tucked away In his arms. The
genial Santa depended not upon for
mality, therefore introduction bein|[
unnecessary he m,ade himself at home
and at ease with the gaping young
ones and kept up his kindly reputation
by presenting to each good little boy
and girl a present As soon . as the
good Santa's stock was exhausted he
would return to his quarters and come
forth once again with ever so many
more pretty things until the children
began to thjnk there could be no limit
to his generosity and resources. .
TOWNSFOLK INTERESTED.
They were also permitted to glance
upon the cases of neatly published
books of fairy tales and stories of more
serious material, and then the voices
were hushed at the request of Princi
pal C. O. Sh'arpe, who announced brief
ly that the Christmas gifts would be
distributed. . .- , ' : \iX\
It was 1 o'clock when the children
arrived at the park and without cere
mony or speeches they were allowed
to take their places around the hand
some Christmas tree to admire the
myriad of yari-colored candles and
covet the ribbon-tied boxes and bru
nette and blonde-haired dolls and mus
lin bags of sweetmeats.
SANTA CLAUS APPEARS.
Sausalito families were all- astir yes
terday and children were tidied up and
jnade to look spick and span in their
prettiest costumes and then, with smil
ing faces, they wended their way to
Buena Vista Park, where awaiting
them was a huge Christmas tree laden
with an assortment of presents that
benevolent Santa Claus brings to all
good and obedient school children at
Yuletide.
The recipients of all the numerous
good things were scholars of the pri
mary and higher grades of the Sausa
lito grammar school and in recogni
tion of their quite admirable scholas
tic showing Mayor Jacques Thomas,
with the aid of generous neighbors,
was enabled to purchase presents for
every one cf the 300 pupils.
Body of Wreck Victim Is Found.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 11.â A Body
supposed to be that of one of the crew
of the wrecked French bark Francois
Coppee was washed ashore near Point
Reyes life-saving station to-day. The
Coppee went ashore in the fog on Fri
day, November 20, on Pierce Point.
The department has considered the
advisability of submitting the matter
to the courts to determine the purpose
of Congress, and whether in fact It is
being fulfilled. That course, however,
would necessarily involve delay and
litigation. If it were held that the
property should revert back to the
United State?, the future disposition
of the property doubtless would re
quire action by Congress.
Secret/try Ccrtelyou has trans
mitted the papers directly to Con
gress to determine whether Its pur
pose is being fulfilled, and if not what
<3ispc5it:on be made of the prop
erty, which is. valuable.

was the purpose of Congress by the
act of August 11, 1ST6, to provide that
the sailors* home, formerly a marine
hospital, should be supported by the

Governor Brady says that those tvho
have traveled throughout the Territory
this year are certain that Alaska
lo-day has a less v. hite population than
it had in 1&00, and that it is migratory-
In view of these facts the Governor
deprecates the agitation for a change
of government of Alaska from \ district
to territorial, though aspiring to State
hood when Alaska, fills with a desira
ble population. He asks what reason
there is for requesting Congress to or
ganize an expensive system of govern
ment that will plunge the Alaskans
into debt and all manner of excesses,
involving taxation to its utmost limit.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â Governor
Brady ef Alaska, in his annual report
\ â¢ the Secretary of the Interior, urges
provisions for Alaska's representation
by a delegate in Congress, and savs
that Alaska's main need is for pioneers
and home builders. He urges the abol
ishment of the fee system for United
States Commissioners and Deputy
Marshals and extension of the home
stead laws. He says CongTess can do
better thing* for Alaska now than to
encourage the construction of roads.

commenced at Ingleslde Park this
morning at 11:20 o'clock.- A number of
Eastern greyhounds will make their
first appearance. The likely , winners
look to be:
Mount Rcse was expected to cut a big
figure in the stake, but he cannot start
unless permission is given by the Ingle-
Bide management. He ran last Satur
day at their park and was withdrawn
without cause. He was suspended, and
the suspension was sustained by the
California Coursing Committee.
The coursing at Union Park will com
mence to-day upon the arrival of the 11
o'clock train. There will be trains to
morrow at 10:15, 11, 12 and 1 o'clock.
The likely winners look to be:
Re<J Rock, Sacramento Boy, Cloudburst

Curtis* Lou Chord second ($600). and J
tfhea's Gaae Bey third ($350).
Of the sixty-four entries xo-day fif
teen are from the East. They include
the fastest greyhounds in America
owned outside of California. Gambit
is the only imported dog entered. Twen
ty-four are by imported eires, Fetter
Free heading the list with nine. For
tuna Favente and For Freedom have
fcur each. There are six representa
tives of imported dams. Northern
Alarm and Advertiser are the best of
the Eastern contingent.
The stake is conceded on all sides to
be the highest class event ever drawn
in America. The form students have
decided that the winner of the Rector-
Belle Free course this afternoon will be
a contender for the lion's share of the
purse. Both greyhounds are at their
best and a sensational trial is expected
when they meet. Barge and Pocatelli
are also expected to Ehow to nfl-nn
tage. The Eastern dogs have never
started here and are an unknown quan
tity. Â£;:;*

among the sportsmen of the gun clubs
that the ducks are coming back and
elaborate. preparations are being made
to receive them. The gun stores are
overwhelmed with orders' for shells and
there is a general air of activity among
the dovotees of the gun.
There havebesn trying weeks of in
activity, during which. the ducks have
been conspicuous by their absence, and
owners of costly preserves have returned
from the marsh day- after day empty
handed. With the" recent- dry, cold
weather conditions have changed and
good sport Is apparently in prospect.
The fuHplumaRe'd northern birds are
in evidence\while those which went
inland are returning to the feeding
grounds about the bay." )
If th3 rain holds off and the cold
weather continues, excellent shooting is
expected on all the bay preserves. The
sportsmen win beout in numbers in
order to make the. most of their oppor

In Great Britain there are golf courses
almost innumerable. So far from being,'
as Is the case In 'the United States, a
recreation for the rich only, golf is
played by anybody and everybody.
Many of the"courses are laid out "on
common land, and on such links . cu- 4
rious incidents occur. Nursemaids*
wheel baby carriages right across the
links and pay no attention at all to the
oft-repeated cries of "Fore!" The golfer
must resign himself to waiting until the,
maids and the children' In* her, charge
have passed out of the way.' In the.
good old summer time playful girls : nnd
cool retreats in the sand b'unkers.^and

The first Council's cup for ladies was

now until Christmas day. On that
holiday there will be a handicap over
eighteen holes for first and second

qualifying round for a match play con
test, the eight men who hand in the
lowest gross scores to qualify. The
handicaps given at the beginning of the
competition will apply throughout, four
days being allowed for each round of
match play.
On Tuesday morning next, beginning
at 9:30 o'clock, the ladies of the San
Francisco Golf Club will hold a handi
cap over eighteen hdles, medal play.

The recent competition for the Coun
cil's cup for men of the San Francisco
Golf Club was concluded on Tuesday,
when J. W. Byrne defeated Lieutenant
J. S. Oyster 7 up 6 to play ..over
eighteen holes. On the first round J.
W. Byrne won six holes and halved the
remaining three, being 6,up. His medal
play scote was 6, 4, 5, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 5â
total 35. or four better than "bogey-,"
which Is 39. On the second round Mr.
Byrne Won the tenth hole, and the elev
enth was taken by L'ieutenant Oyster.
The twelfth hole was won by J. W.
Byrne and with it the match and , the
right to have his name engraved on "the
handsome silver trophy. The cup now
bears the names of S.I*. Abbott Jr., H.
C. Golcher, R. H. Gaylord. H. Owodwin.
John Lawson, Lieutenant J. S. Oyster
and J. W. Byrne. The names of S. L.
Abbott Jr. and H. C. Go'lcher- appear
on it twice, and each of tha other names
once. J. W. Byrne was in the 'final
round against R. H.": Gaylord In 1900
and against H. C.- Golcher In: 1801. The
match between R. H. Gaylord and J.
W. Byrne was a most remarkable one.
At the end of the first round R. H.
Gaylord was 7 up, but at the seven*
teenth hole the match was all square.
Gaylord took the last" hole and Won the
match.

.Both- the California and Golden
Gate Tennis dubs will hold tourna
ments on- Christmas day. "The former
will hold a , handicap ! doubles tourney
for, the .challenge cups. - \ The > Smith
brothers are. the holders, Vbut will . not
enter . the next event. Chester , Smith
will join forces with Will Collier. The
latter has tried almost every good" man
in the club, but does not work" well in
double harness.; All of the teams that
participated in the last event and sev
eral' more : will' play K in : the .' holiday
tournament. IWill' Allen and Dr. Hill
are -the only' others , ; to';have -their,
names "on; the/cups.'-' They 'must'^be

Tobin combines speed and .accu
racy, but his volleying and overhead
work -are rather weak. When he
brings his net game up to his back
court game the cracks Will find him a
hard man to beat. ' ' â¢' â¢
The' only hope of wre3ting the
championship from Bell lies in Mac-
Gavin and Percy Murdock, the'Ala
meda crack. MacGavin looked to be
steadying down some," but last Sun
day played his old time .wild, care
less game. If Murdock improves this
year as he did last he will surely be
the strongest player from the north.
One of these two players wi 11 un
doubtedly win the State champion
ship tournament. The winner will be
called upon to play Grant Smith, the
present champion. The latter will
probably be able to. play this match,
but will participate in no other tour
naments during the year. â¢
Will Taylor and Joe .Tobin, two ex
champions, have again taken up. the
game and play almo3t as well as ever.
In a, doubles. on Sunday they. showed
surprising form, beating Frank Mitch
ell and Sidney Salisbury witti 'ease.
Tobin and Taylor make a strong com
bination in doubles, as both play a
safe game and aim. to get. everything
back. Taylor is as steady as a clock
and makes few errors. He would be
much rnore dangerous if he, played a'
more aggressive game. The. game" he
plays now is the one'that made him
the undefeated champfon for so many
years. The game, however,' has gone
ahead a great deal since Taylor was
champion and he will have to culti
vate more speed to win. ". ".';Â»Â¦-â

really belongs there is Drummond
MacGavin and at times Tiis game is
far from being first clas3.; In' the

, Fuller assumed aggressive . tactics
in the second round. He landed two
heavy.- rights'" on Welch's jaw and
shook him up. Welch took things
easy, and let Fuller tire himself. Ful
ler'fought hard'in the third, but could
do no damage. - Welch would cover
up- and allow George to do the bat
tling and then would let fly with both
hands and land heavy wallops on Ful
ler's head and body. Welch used a
left shift, , a la Canole, and caught
Fuller gapping. The second time he
tried it. Fuller crossed him with his
right on .the jaw. It was even up at
the end of this round.
Welch tried covering up tactics in
the -fourth and allowed Fuller to do
the ,wc>rk. When the latter tired
Welch :' turned . loose and had his man
going. .The "Spider" had his man in
a weary condition before the round
ended^and it- was apparent to all that
Welch" would win the next round.' Ful
ler was* game, '"however, and came up
for the" fifth round' ready and willing:'
to mix._Welch* hooked him twice with
his long left and- then sent in a ter
rific body, punch which hurt. Fuller
fought back, but Welch, scenting vic
tory, went in and in half a minute had
Fuller faltering. He shifted and sent
a terrific left to the body and followed
with a right to the head, sending Ful
ler to the floor. Referee McDevitt hu
manely stopped the fight and gave the
decision to Welch. Fuller arose be
fore the court^of ten, but, was very
groggy. ..
'Fuller was in splendid shape, al
though a trifle drawn. Welch was
also trained and very confident. In
the first round Fuller started the go
ing by hammering Welch with lefts
and rights. He landed some vicious
punches and surprised the "Spider."
As the round closed Welch landed a
vicious left uppercut that hurt Ful
ler. It was Fuller's round.
The preliminary battle between
"Spider" Welch and George Fuller
was a clean exhibition of . boxing.
Welch was declared the winner in
the fifth round by Referee Jimmy
McDevitt, who stopped the V bout for
fear that Fuller might bejnjured. It
was well he did so, as 'the defeated
man had no chance against his hard
hitting opponent. <

offered were satisfactory;
This announcement will be.joyfuily
received' by all lovera of the game, and
the match will be one of. the mostim^
partarit athletic events of the. year on
the Pacific â¢ Coast. . . When theV Indian
eleven-played against the University^ of
California here four years "ago, '.the
match attracted', widespread Â¦attention
arid [ drew' an immense crowd. ',' Every
year since there has been talk of again
bringing the Indian kickers to'Â»vthe
coasts but not tjll the present time have
the plans carried.. " . ;
"Pete" , Smith, 'manager of " the Reli

the red men*for. several weeks. He said
last night:" â¢.!Â¦-*. ? ' .. Â¦'Â¦Â¦..: ,,Â¦'.
".Yes; the Indians will play 'here
Christmas day. without doub't,>'and' I
think that I; will be able to put. a crack
team in; the field against; them. They
will play,: in Denver on December 19 and
will leave immediately for this city, ar
riving here on December 22, so- that.
they, will have two days in which to
warm up for the big game.
"I have been after several of the Cal
ifornia, and Stanford players and I
think that many of them will consent
to play. Overall, Heitmuller, j3towe and
several other stars from the Berkeley
team will-be on the All-California lirie
up, provided the game with Minnesota
is declared off.
"I expect to have many of the Stan
ford gladiators on the team. I will
have a talk with them to-day and see
what can be done toward inducing
them to play on the All-California
team. I am sure Captain Bransbacll
will consent, and there are others that
I know would like to play, but as yet I
am not at liberty to give out their
names."
The big contest will be pulled- off on
the Richmond field and should attract
15,000 people. The California squad,
which will probably consist of twenty
three or more men, will begin active
training on Monday, so that the team
'will be in first-class form to meet the
famous redskin kickers.' â¢/ . â¢:â¢,.Â¦

Dolly Hayman, a product of Napa
Stock Farm, furnished the sensational
part of the racing at Oakland yester
day. The three-year-old filly is owned
by the Texas horseman, Wade McLe
more, and was one of seven starters in
the concluding event of the afternoon,
a mile purse affair. So busy were the
talent, getting aboard Beau Ormonde
and Epicure, each of which wasquoted
'.at â¢.7; to 5,. that very little attention was
paid any of the others. Dolly Hayman
made -her California debut In a race
last Tuesday, but the showing she
made was far below her Eastern rec
ord. Wade McLemore figured that his
entry was up against It; and so did the
major portion of the bookmakers, for
100 to 1 was 'chalked . on a rfew boards.
Bullman had the mount on Beau Or
monde and Powell rode. -Epicure. At the
"start ? the pair went out in front and
everything 1 : pointed to a two-horse race.
Although "the pace was not a sizzling
one, Powell topk 'Epicure back a bit
about three turlongs from the stand.
About this time Lowe began moving up
.wUhJJolly Hayman, '.'and it was 'appar
ent 'she was going ' to be a factor. Bull
man" 'Â¦' saw- " her ' coming.' and sat . .down
hard: on Ormonde,' and Powell also tried
to iget t iri^the', game- again. About a
furlong f rom â¢ the wire .the latter was
cut- off, .and in" a.. mild drive- the-.de
splsed>l6hg.,shot lowered the colors of
BeaJu'.brmoriae' by a long' neck in 1:39^.
Two -lengths away, . Epicure was third.
There ,was only a dribbling play. on the
winner, .the average, market price being
40 ' to/ 1, Â¦'"'. arid ' the bets recorded were
mostly show plays. . v . . :'Â» v â¢.. ; .;
The mild weather. and a" card above
the. average attracted a large ; attend
ance.;; '.The different events were -well
contested, head and nose finishes be
ing - common occurrences. ..Â¦* Three fa
vorites were, returned winners."',
, Morris Eppinger's colt The Bugaboo,
an 8 to 1 "chance," took the maiden two
year-old scramble from a 'field of ten.
Et Tu Brutes Another, long, sJjoJL led to
within fifty yards of the wire, where
The Bugaboo, ridden by' N. Lewis, got
up in -time to win by- almost a length.
Pachuca beat the favorite, Harbor, for
the show.
If St. Winifride had a'ch'ahce to take
the six and a half furlong selling num
ber it was ruined soon after the start
by Foley's saddle turning. The rider
himself narrowly escaped injury, finally
getting the mare pulled up near the
three-eighths pole. Jockey Club, pilot
ed by Bill Waldo and equal favorite
with St. Winifride, early assumed the
front position, beating out Albemarle
with something in reserve. Tamm, ;a
100 to 1 shot, with W. Coleman up,
downed Polonius a, short head for the
show.
The Fog, a 3 to 5 favorite, made a
runaway race of the five and a half
furlong selling run. Foley had the leg
up on the colt and was kept busy, from
the time the. barrier was released try
ing to prevent his mount fror; running
out. Under this handicap "the favorite
crossed the line two lengths before
Waterpower, a 40 to 1 'chance. Bob
Smith's two-year-old Silent Water dis
posed of Bay Wonder for third place.
A body punch that hurt was deliv-.
ered when Horton finished third In the
mile and a sixteenth selling number.
The little horse had Bullman in the*
pilot-house and closed favorite at 9 to
5. "Bull" proved a poor skipper, act
ing verv much as if he had lost his
bearings and was afraid of striking
Farallo*n light. Because the faint
hearted Oscar Tolle opened up a gap
over the field Bullman drew his marlin
spike at the five-furlc-ng pole and be
gan riding the favorite. Horton has
but one run, and in the stretch was
not there. Hifdebrand rode an excel-i
lent race on Rosarie. beating out See
on Illowaho in a driving finish by a
neck. The favorite ran third, nearly
three lengths back. ,
However, the followers of Bullman
evened up matters in the seven-furlong
event following. ' He had the mount on
Billy. Magrane's Redwald^ and away
from, the post only- fairly well grad
ually wore down the leaders and in a
desperate drive was awarded a nose
decision over Constellator. The Miller'
ran a bang up third.

in the hope of saving himself- punishment.

and the crowd hooted.* ; â¢

"Pete" Smith Arranges Match
Which Will Bs Played in
This City Christmas" Day
whipped both of them without turning
a hair.
Jack Johnson, the 'colored heavy
weight boxer, gained an easy decision
over Sandy Ferguson at Colma last
night after ttfenty rounds of variegated
milling. It was more comedy than fight
at times--.
Ferguson proved ai:- awkward boy,
without ability as a boxer and without
any knowledge of ringcraft. He was
bo big and so clumsy that Johnson's
far-famed â¢ cleverness was in eclipse
throughout the fight. His stinging left
Jab. which, with other men. had the
bite <* a viper in it, proved harmless.
His right- was also seldom used for
pome reason not apparent to the spec
tators. Ferguson leaned so far back
and kept his left so far out that John
son's blows seldom reached thefV mark.
When they did they were not effective,
Ferguson showing the first trace of
Mood in the seventeenth round.
The Boston man was credited with
having a great right hand, but it was
not in evidence last night. After the
light Ferguson claimed he injured it in
the third round. He used It at long in
tervals, but each time he swung it like
a flail and struck with his open glove.
There was no force in the blow or in
any he used.
BETTING ON ROUNDS.
Johnson commenced using his right in
the sixteenth round, which gave the
spectators the impression that there
had been some betting on the rounds
Â¦and that Johnson did not try to wind
matters up quickly. The spectators
made up their minds early in the fight
that the heavyweights were not doing
the fighting expected of them. They
jeered them repeatedly and urged them
on sarcastically whenever the big 1 fel
lows got besy, although they were do
ing no damage. There was no class to
the contest, but it gave those in attend
ance a chance to yell and coach to their
heart's content.
They were with Ferguson from the
start and joined his seconds in pleading
for him to go in and do something. He
either did not know how or would not
take a charce, as he was invariably on
the receiving end. Johnson was the
arÂ»res-5or, m a mild r.ort of way, at all
iimes, but there wai something lack
ing. He cou?<l not make the spectators
believe he was in earnest. He could
outfeint Ferguson any time, the Boston
man being all at sea whenever he
made a few passes in front of his face.
For a time Ferguson seemed anxious
for an excuse to stop, as he claimed
several blows were foul. As they wen?
palpably fair Referee Welch gave Iiirn
r.n satisfaction, but ordered him to con
tinue fighting.
BLOWS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE.
ThÂ« majority of the blows struck Juv
irg the fight landed on Ferguson, bat
Fccir.ed to a' ve no effect on him. In
i he seventh round Johnson stumbled
down" and th..- spectators thought Fer
puson had hi:r.. Johnson was up in an
instant, but lor the time being he had
all the fight taken out of him. In Uw
sixteenth he knocked Ferguson down,
but he was up at the count of two.
Johnson was a consistent favorit3
frcm the time betting commenced. The
bulk of the -.r.oney was wagered at 10
tÂ«Â» .< and 10 to 4.
The Colma band discoursed sweet
music after the first preliminary.
"Sandy" Ferguson entered the ring to
the tune of a waltz and Jack Johnson
came somewhat later. His delay in
entering the ring was due to his desire
to come down the middle aisle in step
with a ragtime melody. When Mr.
Johnson entered the arena he created
a sensation. He looked like a colored
Fanta Claus. He wore a bathrobe tha't
would make any member of his race
turn green with envy. It was a crea
tion. Pink and blue roses on a black
background, and a pink girdle set off
the robe. Johnson's black face and gold
teeth shone beneath the big hood that
covered his shiny head. He was so
proud of h5s robe that upon entering
tfye ring he walked around and dis
played it to the spectators amid great
laughter.
ATTENDANCE IS LJCHT.
Ferguson was seconded by Tim 51c-
Grath, Joe Millet and Walter Mareno.
He wore black trunks and a sash of
red, white and blue. His tkin was pink,
but he looked a trifle too fat. John
son discarded his robe and came forth
in a purple breech-clout and purple
stockings. He was In splendid shape
He had Mark Shaughnessy, Australian
Tim, Murphy and Harry Foley behind
The arrangements for the fight were
an imorovement upon those of ' the
club's first affair. The ventilation was
better and there was flooring: for the
spectators instead of tanbark. The spe
cial trains proved an excellent inno
vation and several hundred spectators
availed thomsolves of the chance to
ride to and from the fight by rail.
Small boys scampered over the roof
and tore off shingles in the hooe erf
peelnp the fight. Had they not drop
ped shingles on the heads of the spec
tators they would probably have been
permitted to remain. Having commit
ted this breach of Colma rules, a dep
uty sheriff climbed on ths roof and
scattered the daring youths. The at
tendance was not large, there being
less than 5^000 in the lie-use. I' '
One point the spectators were agreed
upon. That was that both men should
Irccp as far away as possible from Jef
fries. From the showing they made
last right the bis champion could have

When the Ivy hoisted her anchorthe
wind was blowing: freshly and favor-;

Bave the expense of a towboat and sail

gation nearly cost him his vessel, for
when between the heads th^wind failed
and a sweeping: tide toox charge of the
Ivy. Helpless in the current's grasp,
she neared the jagged fringe of coast
line at Lime Point. There was no se
cure anchorage available and the Ivy's
plight was precarious in the extreme,
when the Sea Queen came romping
through the swell to her aid. A line
was passed to the schooner ( and made
fast. The Ivy was almost touching the
Ktsep rocks when th^ towline tightened
and the Sea Queen dragged the vessel
clear of danger. Captain Jensen then
engaged the Sea Queen to tow the Ivy
to sea.
The schooner Ivy, which sailed yes

that saved the sailing vessel from be

In the suit brought by Captain
James Brown, the Cocos Island treas
ure hunter, against Louis H. aiooser
and others, to recover' 5375 salary-al
leged to be due him as supercargo of
the schooner Herman,- the defendants
yesterday filed a cross libel in the
United .States District Court asking for
judgment against Brown for $19.
999 35, the money advanced by "the de
fendants to lit out and carry on the
expedition. They allege that he de
ceived them with his treasure story
and that he converted $ 24 6 S of the
money to his own use. The cross li
bel recites the history of the voyage
of the Herman as already published.
Treasure Hunter Brown Sued.

The mste of the British ship Levern
bank was taking the air about this
time and when cries of "help" suddenly
filled the a ; r he was quick to respond.
Although ready for sea the Levernbank
lacked a crew, but in the half deck
wore half a dozen sleerir.g apprentices.
The mate's "man overboard" sent their
dreams a-sesttering and in a few min
utes one of the Britisher's boats was
pulling: in the direction of the cries.
The three half-drowned deserters were
picked ur> off Alcatraz and taken
aboard the Levernbank.
After breakfast yesterday morning
they were placed aboard a Crowley
launch and taken to the Yerba Buena
station, where, in the brig of the P<?n
sacola, they await the punishment pro

with Uncle Sam.
Several hours after taps had sound
rd. when the island v:as wrapped in
r.ight and all but the sentries slum
bered, the unfaithful three stole their
silent way to a place on the beach
Â¦where tho tide lat-ped the, time-worn
timbers of n skiff belonging to a visit
1nj? pile-driving outfit. Noiselessly the
trio embarked and without parting sa
lute or even spoken farewell padd!ed
their craft a. way from the shore.
Once clear of the island the ebb tide
took chars'? the skiff and the de
s-crters wor- 3 filling their lungs with the
air cf freedom when a splash in the
bottom of the boat called attention to
the fact that their versel was of close
kin to a si:ve.
T. Cook, 'andsman, and E. .L. and E.
G. Couch, brothers and naval appren
tices, tried to desert from the Yerba
Buena training station Thursday
night, but only succeeded in running o
close race with death. They won the
race as far as Ihe reaper was Â«.on
cprjied, but as return Lar the island was
the price of victory the would-be de
serters' joy is not the really rosy arti
cle.

Pay day at the Presidio yesterday
was a big one. Both the soldiers of the
post prope>' and also the men of the
Tenth Infantry were paid off at the
same time. That is, the two paymas
ters left the Phelan building in their
four-ln-hand ambulances and drove out
to th3 post at almost the same hour.
Major .Rochester went to the main pay
office in the pest" and there handed out
something like ?20,COO in gold coin of
the realm to the cavalry, artillery and
others connected with that department.
Paymaster Captain W. F. Creary paid
off the Tenth Infantry in its canton
ment just at the entrance to the Pre
sidio. His pay roll amounted to some
thing over $10,000. This was altogether
one of the biggest pay days that has
occurred since the close of the Spanish-
American, war.
The commission men are not idle and
they insist that the Harbor Commis
sioners have no jurisdiction beyond the
property of the State; also, that they
have never been approached along the
wharves by the three men that claim
to have suffered from discriminations.
This . Is to command you, said defendants,
your counselors, attorneys, solicitors, agents,
servants and. employes and all others acting in
aid or assistance of you to absolutely desist and
refrain from alt Interference in any way with
the sale or disposition by said plaintiffs, their
agents', servants or employes, of vegetables,
fruit or. other produce commonly known as per
ishable products upon the public wharves or
other property belonging: to the State of Cali
fornia in the city and county of San Francisco
or. elsewhere; and to refrain from enforcing or
carrying into effect the decree or order made
by i said defendants December 3, 1903. revoking
the permits of said plaintiff heretofore granted
by eald defendants to sell products upon said
property. . ' â¢
The order issued by Judge Murasky
to restrain the Harbor Commissioners
from interfering with the operations of
L. Scatena & Co., Wetmore Bros., "Wolf
& Sons and McDonough & Runyon Is
wide in its scope. The following is a
copy of the order in one case, the f,our
being identical In terms:
No move was made publicly^ yester
day by the Harbor Commissioners,
through their- /attorney, TV. H. Davis,
toward the dissolution of the injunc
tion. Attorney Davis said last evening
that the plan of procedure had not been
mapped out. When the commissioners
had reapffed a decision the next move
would be intended to reach a result as
quickly as possible. He declined to in
dicate what would be done. Possibly
something will happen to-day* In be
half of the Harbor Commissioners.
Attorney Davis calls attention to the
ground set up in their complaint by
the four commission firms whose per
mits to sell were taken away by the
ilarbor Commissioners. Especial stress,
Mr. Davis says, was placed by the
commission men deprived of permits
on the point that they were not given
due notice of the proceeding before the
board, under the Woodward law, and
that they had not been charged with* a
specific offense, as they thought they
ought to have been, as a basis for p'ro
ceedings involving their selling per
mits. No attack, Mr. Davis, was
made against the Woodward law by
the commission men in their complaint
agninst the law.
The proceedings relative to L. G.
Sresovlch & Co., Garcia & Maggini,
Mitcheil &.Goodall and G. Berti & Co.
will go on next Tuesday morning, as
set by the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners. Notice was served upon each
of these firms yesterday. Against each
of them a specific charge will be drawn
by Attorney. Davis for the Harbor
Commissioners, on the basis of the affi
davits filed with the commissioners
relative to the alleged refusal to sell
produce to persons not members of the
retail dealers' association.
The commission houses of L. Scatena
& Co., "Wolf & Sons, AIcDonough &
lyinyon and Wetmore Eros., under the
temporary Injunction secured by them
against the Board of State Harbor
Commissioners, are free to sell perish
able products on the State's wharves
in this city or elsewhere without inter
ference of any sort by ths Harbor Com
missioners. Â¦

CHICAGO, Dec. 11.â A bullish sentiment pre
vailed among wheat traders at the opening, due
partly to the government report on acreage
and condition of the fall .Southwestern wheat.
This factor, howeve.r. was not as potent as was
the firmness in the Liverpool 'market in the
face of the weakness that prevailed here yes
terday. The effects of reports of rain in Ar
gentina was alfo Just beginning to be felt and
the continued small receipts in the Northwest
and Southwert were Instrumental In bringing
out a Rood demand. May was up 14c to 14c.
to 'aÂ®%c at the start,' opening at 81c to 81?Â»c
and with only scattered selling the price grad
ually advanced. There was' considerable cov
ering by those who had overshot on the break
yesterday nnd commission houses were also ac
tive on tlfc buying aide. The strength In other
markets and the small receipts intensified the
desire to buy and later, when it wa* announced
that clearances were. much larger than usual,
there was a sharp demand, which carried May
up to R2Â«ic. a gain of lÂ» g c from the Ion- point.
A part of the gain wa* lost on ' profit-taking,

There was an utrent demand for oats from

NEW YORK. Dee. 11.â There wa* lew :x
tlvlty In to-day"Â« stock market and the rt?al
iri4rs were more congested In a few stocks.
United States Steel preferred was betT.Â«-en
three and four times as active as any othÂ»r

market diligently all day. Its price was.
forced down to 51 W. which wa* only a trifle

of the dividend rate ton the preferred for the

Published estimates of the heavy erirink&ge of

the sto?k. Bnxiklyn Transit, which waÂ« next
In point of activity, was reactionary on vhat
â¢<?Â«med profit-taking. Amalgamated Coppor,
Erie and Pennsylvania were very conspicuous
In the trading and had periods of strength. Ss
long as trading continues in London the mar
ket showed point* of strength, but afterward
the advance melted away â¢ very generally,
Brooklyn TrarMt receding to near the low
point of the room'.njr dip. The reactionary
force* In the market did not develop jrreat ac
tivity an4 the moment suggested rather a ces
sation of the advance than a new factor of
weakness. Thrre is a prevalent sentiment that
prudence in the making of. new commitment*

The estimates cf the rejrulir export movement
Â©f currency for the week point to a balance
fn favor of New York of between $2/juO.OOO
and $2,500,000.
As the cub-treasury operations have ab

heavy rains were reported In all parts, with
hail in the south, thunder and lightning In all
parts of the north, with Rtrong winds, and thÂ«
harvest in portions of the province of Buenoa
Ayres hindered by storms. Snow was reported
over the greater part of the American Winter
Wheat belt, but this Is beneficial, as It. pro.
tects the plant from the cold. Bradstreet's
gave the exports for the week. Flour Included,
at 4,607,000 bushels, an Increase over the re

The market was exceedingly dull, as the lo
cal demand was light, owing to the cool weath
er, and there was > practically no Inquiry from
outsldÂ« points. r Recelpts of berries consisted
of a few scattering lots of lar^e strawberries,
which were mostly of poor quality and hard to
dispose of. The market was overloaded with
apple?, particularly low-grade stock, and prices
were inclined to easiness. An assorted car
load of high-grade stock from La?sen County
was placed in storage awaiting more favor
able Â¦ market conditions. Stocks of other de
ciduous fruits were light but ample, and price*
had no quotable variance.

rr.ere were no changes in Game, but the mar
ket continued weak In sympathy with Poultry
and there was quite a surplus untold at the
end of the day.
Dressed Turkeys were suddenly plentiful a^nd
there was a sharp break In prices. Ninety
cases were Â¦ received. 7<> of which were con
signed to one house. Good stock was In fair re
quest at 20023c per pound, while poor lots were
bard to dispose- of .even at the minimum quota
tion. --Receipts' .of live Turkeys were light and
prices were well sustained. The chicken mar
ket continued weak with supplies still In excei's
of requirements, and dealers were making con
cessions In order to clean up. Some leading
retailers took >advantage of the opportunity to
speculate and purchaetd freely for storage pur
poses. One dealer cleaned up several coops of
fine -young 'Western Roosters for that purpose
at fi per dozen. Another car of "Western stock
was marketed, making the seventh for the

The Board of Public Works yesterday
sent a caustic letter to the Board of
Education in which it states .that it
does not deem the dismissal by the last
named board of James B. McSheehy,
inspector of school buildings, advisable
nor to the best interests of the "city."
The Board of Works holds -that the
constant inspection of school buildings,
many of which are in urgent" need of
repair, and a thorough knowledge of
their condition Is equally as important
as the superintendence and supervision
of the mechanics employed.. ; ,. .
For the foregoing reasons the Board
of Works recomrtiends that the Â¦Board
of Education reconsider its action in
regard to the inspector of school;build
ings. The letter continues: 'Â¦'$'â¢

Right upon the heels of the discharge
by the Board of Education of a num
ber of mechanics that have been em
ployed on necessary repairs to the pub-,
lie school buildings comes the discov
ery by Auditor .Baehr that the same
board ' has gone into the business of
equipping,, football teams connected
with, the hi erh schools.
Yesterday there was presented to the
Auditor for his signature a demand in
the sum of $77 drawn in favor of Fred
Barthels- and covering certain articles
cf wear for the Lowell 'High SchooF
football team. Baehr thinks that this
is preliminary to the equipping of the
Polytechnic High School and Mission
High School' football teams by the
board.
Barthels is, a pupil in the school
named and is captain of the football
team. Baehr was somewhat surprised
that a demand should be made out in
favor of the pupil named, and on in
vestigation found that the firm name
on the bill for the supplies had been
cut from the bill and in that shape
it had been pasted, on the official de
mand.
Upon further inauiry Baehr learned
that the football supplies had been
bought/ from Gantner & Mattern by
Barthels and the demand was then
made out In favor of the last named.
The bill was approved by Directors
Woodward, Mark and Roncovieri and
specified the following articles as hav
ing been furnished to the team:
September 11â Â« padded Jerseys at $2 75. $16 50
10 pairs pants at $3 50 33 00
/ 10 pairs hose at $1 1O0O
September 4 â * padded Jerseys at %2 75. 11 00
October 1â1 pair football shoes 4 80
. Total ....":... â¢Â¦%'' 00
No sooner had the bill been sent from
the Board of Education than Barthels
appeared at the Auditor's office for the
purpose of securing " it , and . having: it
cashed; at. the city treasury.-'' 1 When
questioned â¢ by j the Auditor's - deputies
Barthels said that h* had ordered the
goods: upon th e direction of '. Directors
Mark, and Roncovieri. Mark is chair
man of the HIeh School Committee,
and as such supervises the expenditures
of the high schools, while Roncovieri
is chairman of the Supplies Committee
and has similar but more comprehen
sive powers., Â¦
-.Auditor Baehr "declined to jrive the
demand to BartheJs and declared that
he would , withhold . payment on the
ground thatit is an illegal expendi
ture of. schooh moneys. Considering
that % the Board ' of Education is con
tinually complaining that it has not
sufficient funds to hin the School De
partment properly, "' Baehr 'thinks that
an '.expenditure for .football supplies is
unwise and unwarranted, and he states
that he will positively, refuse to audit
such a demand or -any -of a similar
character. ' . -

the company that amaunt to purchase
stocks on a margin for him with the
understanding that when he demand
ed the return of the money it was to
be refunded. Recently he asked that
the cash be restored to him and his
demand was refused, hence the suit.
- D. J. Guggenheim said It- a condition
were imposed that cars should be. un
loaded in the warehouses it would ren
der useless 89 per cent of the. spur
tracks' now in "use. He argued that
many of the warehouses were not'con
structed to permit I of cars being run
into them, and insurance rates would
be increased if such a requirement
were adopted. The committee post
poned action on the matter until next
Friday.
The -Supervisors' Judiciary arid Fin
ance" Committee yesterday began an in
vestigation into a demand of 5156 per
sented by F. A. Mantle for services
as expert to the Grand Jury. It was
stated that after Mantle had- submit
ted'the demand to- the. Supervisors he
withdrew it and then filed it with the
Auditor. Chairman Comte stated that
only J1500 was allowed the Grand Jury
for this year's expenses. Of this amount
Stenographer J. A. Vaughan is paid
$100 per month, and- Comte said fhere
would be a deficit in the, fund if care
was not taken regarding its distribu
tion. Actjon in the matter was post
poned for one week.
The proposed ordinance licensing
locksmiths aricl providing restrictive
regulations therefor was "referred to
Chief of Pplice v Wittman, who invited
interested persons to meet him at his
office oh MonSay "afternoon at 3 o'clock,
when some agreement will, arrived
at. Sonie twenty itinerant locksmiths
protested against the ordinance because
it required locksmiths to. have a fixed
place of business...
"The Supervisors' joint Committee on
"Judiciary and Streets yesterday began
consideration of a proposed ordinance
regulating spur' track privileges arid
the operation of cars thereon. The or
dinance Drovides that cars running on
spur tracks must be . unloaded Inside
the Â¦warehouses, and not on the street,
and makes it unlawful to operate a car
on a spur track between 6 a. m. and 6
p.. m. on any day.
The ordinance was submitted by
George Renner, manager of the Dray
men's Association, who submitted" a
draft; of the ordinance after telling; of
the abuses- to which spur track privi
leges have . been subjected, causing
traffic to be impeded and often result
ing in death to valuable horses.
,'P.C. Rossi of the Italian-Swiss Col
ony objected to ordinance, claim
ing that it would be a hardship Jpn
those warehouses into which the siiur
tracks do not run.- Rossi said it would
be absolutely necessary to unload the
cars outside the warehouses.
