treaty. Serious debating on the conven
tion will begin on July 14. Dr. Rico, the

as that which was sent to tho United
States Senate by President Roosevelt.

continued the discussion of the absence
of President Marroquin's signature from
the treaty. Dr. Antonio Jose Uribe, the
Minister cf Public Instruction, spoke. Dr.
Rico, the Foreign Minister, in a much-ap
jilauded address, replied to former Presi
dent, now Senator, Caro's argument on
the Question of President Mirroquin's

powerful address, showing that the Sen
ate must approve the treaty before the
President Planed it.
The Senate resumed the discussion on
Thursday on the same point, but did not
arrive at any definite conclusion. On that
day the House of Representatives debated
on the Government's legislative decrees.

The captors are four young women who
escaped from the surveillance of 'the
heads of the Women's Hall and went out
for a glorious lark. They hired a rig
and drove furiously across the campus
into the men's quadrangle, which is
bounded by Snell and Hitchcock halls.
They found some of the men who live
in Hitchcock Hall standing on . the lawn
in front of the building-. Two of -.these
young men were bold enough to approach
the rig to Inquire if they could render any
assistance to the young women.
In less time than it takes to tell it,
two good looking young athletes, with
plenty of money to spend and plenty of
appetite for a good lark, had been en

WASHINGTON. July 12.â Dr. Charles
Wardell Stiles of the Public Health and
Marine Hospital Service, the 'discoverer
of the parasite Uncinaria Americana, gen
erally known as the bookworm, or "germ
of laziness," and who, in his address last
December before the Sanitary Confer
ence of American Republics, told of the
effects of the ravages of the bookworm
disease upon the social, industrial and
economic conditions in the Southern
States, has made ano-aer discovery in the
parasite world. It is considered by Gov
ernment scientists as of the greatest im
portance and its effects may be far
reaching.
Dr. Stilejs* new achievement is the dis
covery, and isolation of what he has
named the Agaraomermls â¢ culicis, other
wise known as "the mosquito destroyer,"
a parasite which kills millions' of mos
quitoes each year, and which, it Is be
lieved, under artificial preparation, will
prove far superior to any means now
known for ridding Infested communities
of these pests.
Scientists in Washington who have
been made acquainted with the discovery
say its importance cannot be overesti
mated, and that the mosquito is doomed
to extermination.

"The comet discovered by Morelly at
Marseilles three weeks ago has been un
der observation by various members of
the Lick Observatory staff. It promises
to be an unusually interesting object. Its
brightness has increased very rapidly, un
til it is now as easily visible as a fourth
magnitude star.
"On Monday evening observer's should
experience no difficulty in detecting: It
about one or two degrees southwest of
the bright star Alpha Cygni. Its motion
is- carrying it southwestward about five
degrees daily. The orbit of the comet
has been computed by Professor Perrlne.
It is now in a parabola In such a way
tha* Its nearest approach to the sun will
occur on August 27 at a distance of
about 31,000,000 miles. Its present distance
from the sun is about 100,000,000 miles and
from the earth alout 20,000.000. To tne
unassisted eye the comet will appear as a
hazy patch of light. An acute eye should
be able to detect a short tall
away from the sun. Our photographs
have recorded two prominent tails, each
several degrees in length. While it is al
ways unsafe to make predictions as to
how bright a comet will grow, yet there
is little doubt that this one will be a fair
ly conspicuous object in the evening sky.
In fact. I should expect it to be the
brightest comet of the past ten years."

firing the charges of both barrels of a

compelled by a gunshot wound inflicted
by Terrill a short time before.
Wolfe had deserted his wife and baby
and suit was brought to compel him to
support them. Early to-day Wolfe drove
past the Terrill home, shouting insulting
remarks and shaking his fist at Terrill.
When Wolfe came by again Terrill shot
him in the leg.
An article in a local paper during his
absence gave an outline of the investiga

Fulkerson returned and refused to act
further with the special agents. Col
lector Garrett was instructed by the
Treasury Department to require him to
give all facts in his possession and last
night Fulkerson resigned from the service
and sent the following telegram to the
department:
"I refuse to act with Agent3 Evans or
Johnson, they having no discretion as to
secrecy. Nor are they competent to ob
tain results. I am willing to co-operate
with any competent board. My resigna

EL PASO, Texas, July 12.â Special
Treasury Agents E. Polk Johnson of New
Orleans and J. F. Evans of El Paso are
investigating what is believed to be the
most gigantic irregularity that has ever
come to light in the customs service of
the Southwestern border. In a formal re
port filed with Customs Collector Patrick
Garrett, Storekeeper John Fulkerson, who
had charge of the Government force of
assayers and ore samplers at the .Amer
ican Smelting trust's works here, said he
could supply evidence that for years past
grave irregularities in the handling of ore
from Mexico had been practiced, result-
Ing in the loss of duties to the Govern
ment amounting to hundreds of thousands
of dollars. An investigation of the trans
actions for three months discovered a loss
of several thousand dollars, and Fulker
son, who has been storekeeper for ten
years, was confident the irregularities
have been practiced for at least half of
that period. He asked that he be made
chairman of a commission to Investigate
and gather evidence, and Collector Gar
rett so recommended to the department.
As a member of the commission, Ful
kerson would have been entitled, under
the laws governing seizures, to a commis
sion on duties recovered and would have
been practically assured of a better po
sittrm elsewhere.. inane service alter'be

Garrett's recommendation was Ignored
and Fulkerson was ordered to supply to
the Treasury agents all information he
might possess. He declined to do this un

and, while his request was under consid
eration, he went on a five days' leave to

handkerchief, which he tore in two and
gave half of it to his companion, and
through this illk the men tried to
breathe.
Blinded by the smoke, they stumbled
and fell as they ran, and as a laM resort
began crawling along the track, with
their faces near the ground. When with

DIES FROM GAS
IN THE TUNNEL
I At last the crash came. On June 22,
j 1S93. the Pacific Bank suspended payment
| and on November 3 It was declared In
[ solvent. A terrific run immediately com-
I menced on the People's Home Savings
! Bank and it also soon went under, carry
! ing ruin to hundreds of poor depositors.
President McDonald and R. H. Mc-
Donald Jr. were indicted by the Grande
Jury and made to stand trial. Frank Mc-
Donald fled to Japan. In both Instances
the alleged offenders were released upon
technical grounds after sensational trials.
Dr. McDonald, who was considered more
the unfortunate dupe of his two sons than
an active offender, could not face the
shame of the sensational incident and
left the city for Cuba, never to set foot
on his native land again.
McDonald Is survived by his brothers,
McDonald, the capitalist and
Park Commissioner of this city, and Mark
L. McDonald of Santa Rosa, who regis
tered at the Occidental last night. Rich
ard H. McDonald Jr.. the pon, who was
implicated with his father In the bank
failure, is now a practicing attorney In
this city. Both Jasper McDonald and his
nephew, Richard, are Jn Santa Rosa at
I the present time.
As subsequent Investigations showed,
the McDonalds soon inaugurated a reck
less campaign of speculation. Umler the
unscrupulous Influence of M. H. Sher
man, a daring financial promoter, first
the sons and later the father began to
squander the funds of the Pacific Bank
in wildcat schemes. First it wasf an
electric road In Los Angeles; then a Sim-,
liar enterprise at Phoenix. In these two
concerns $742,000 of worthless bonds were
bought with the money of the bank's de
positors. In quick succession stock In
the Mohawk canal, the John Brown Col
ony and similar unprofitable* ventures,
the chimerical schemes of Sherman, was
purchased with riotous prodigality.
When these expenditures had begun to
pinch the Pacific Bank President McDon
ald, without scruple, began a systematic
drain upon the People's Home Savings
Bank to stem the tide. As fast as the
deposits came into the savings bank they
were transferred to fill the yawning
breach in the other institution.
On December 11. 1831. the State Bank
Commissioners, becoming suspicious of
"the condition of the McDonald banks,
warned Attorney General W. H. H. Hart,
but the warning passed unheeded. Re
peated admonitory notes to McDonald
himself drew no reply whatever. It sub
sequently devolved that through J. E.
Farnum, manager of the savings bank.
McDonald was keeping his finger on the
pulse of the Bank Commissioners.
CRASH RUINS HUNDREDS.
Dr. McDonald, after a trial replete with
sensations, was allowed to escape on a
technicality, but such was the appalling
number of suits brought against him by
persons who had been defrauded, that the
disgraced bank president took refuge in
flight and had been a self-appointed exile
for ten years when his death came In
Montreal. It is known that he left- a
considerable fortune, despite the financial
crash which overwhelmed him. * s
It was with a small fortune amassed as
the results of the sale of a popular patent
medicine that Dr. McDonald became
president of the old Pacific Bank, which
had been incorporated as early as 1S63.
Later his two sons became officers and
heavy stockholders in their father's in
stitution. So prosperous was the bank's
business that the People's Home Savings
Bank was shortly launched under the
guiding hand of the McDonalds.
RIOTOUS SPECULATION.
DIES IN EXILE.
The death of Dr. McDonald recalls the
sensational Incidents surrounding the
failure of the Pacific Bank and the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank in this city in
1833. The crash of these two concerns
and the resulting disclosures of wholesale
fraud involving Dr. McDonald, his two
sons, Richard H. McDonald Jr. and Frank
McDonald, and other men high in finan
cial and political circles of the commu
nity formed the most startling sensation
In the history of finance on the coast.
Detective Harry Bralg made a moat
thorough research, and, after taking Into
consideration all the various features of
the case, reported to Acting Chief of Po
lice Martin that as far as he could ascer
tain Hausel had taken his own life by
plunging over the landing at the top of
the stairs leading to the Alexander resi
dence.
The wound in the neck is still unex
plained, but It ia thought possible that
Hausel Inflicted this himself with some
Instrument and then walked some dis
tance This hypothesis would account fof
the trail of blood on the sidewalk and also
for a blood-stained handkerchief which
was found In one of the pockets of thÂ«
dead man. -
The- remains have been removed to an
undertaking establishment and will be
cremated at the expense of Brewery
Workers" Union, Local No. 7. of which the
dead man was a member.
She told of her marriage to Hausel in
Seattle, of his habits and his actions on
leaving her three weeks ago without
money. She makes vague and indefinite
charges against "those men In Seattle"
and is convinced her husband was the
victim of foul play.
The poiiee have decided that Hausel's
death was a case of suicide and have
abandoned further investigation of the
case.,
"I know my husband loved me," said
Mrs. Hausel. "and would have sent for
me as soon as he got work. They would
not let him get work. Those Seattle men
that he fought with killed him. Now
they want me to go back to Seattle, but
a. will not go." . . - '
Mrs.' Hausel says she received a letter
from her husband last Friday. He was in
San Francisco and said that he would
send for her as soon as he found employ
ment.
MrÂ«. Joseph Hausel, whose husband's
body was found with the skull fractured
and- a wound in the throat Friday after
noon in front of a residence at 2523 Gough
street, believes he was murdered. She, is
living at the Bethlehem home In Los An
geles and In an Interview yesterday she
asserted that she knew who murdered her
husband.
After asserting the moral obligation and
the legal right of the United States to pro
test to the Russian Government against
its treatment of Jews, Weber said:
W> cannot look with unconcern upon the ar
rival of the thousands of hunted, terror
ftiickcn human beings, who come to us crush

In his address, Weber charged the Rus
sian restrictive laws with being respon
sible for misery and persecution. He said
that there would be no peace, no substan
tial relief for the sufferers until the total
disappearance from Russia of either the
Jew or the special laws directed against
him. Taking up the laws regarding the
right of residence, which the speaker
characterized as especially hard and op
pressive, he briefly sketched the history
of the official decrees regulating the area
within which the Jews were permitted to
live during the past forty years. Sum
ming up the status of the Jew in Russia,
Weber said:
ATLANTIC CITY. July 1*.-John B.
Weber of Buffalo. N. T.. late Commission
er of Immisration at the port of New
York and chairman of the special com
mission authorized by Congress in 1SSS to
investigate in Europe the causes induc

speaker to-day before the Jewish Chau
tauqua on the subject of "The Status of
the Jews in Russia."
It Is r.o breach cf International diplomacy or
frlendFhip If this country Fubmits the question
to the Russian Government its to whether it
will receive a Petition presented hy a large
numher of respectable citizens of this country.
At the conference on Tuesday it will be de
cided what ehall be done with the petition. If
the Russian authorities decide that they cannot
acrept the petition, why that will end the

CAXL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. July IT.â Regardless
of Information received here from trust
worthy sources that the Russian Gov
ernment is taicing effective measures to
punish those responsible for the Kish
enev massacre and prevent further per
secutions of that kind, the President will
not hold back the petition of the B"nai
B'rith Association. It is understood from
an official of the State Department, how
ever, thafr arpruments will be used at the
conference on Tuesday at Oyster Bay
between the President and the petitioners
to Induce the latter to withdraw their
petition if the efforts of the Russian Gov
ernment to prevent further persecutions
prove to be sustained.
What may be accepted as an unofficial
position of the Government in the Kish
enev issue and the attitude of the Presi
dent Is contained in the following state
ment, obtained to-day:
The whole situation Is F.imply that there has
heen no official communication between the
two Governments. Since the President prom
ised the petitioners that he would forward their
petition there has- been nothing to change the
situation.
Special Dispatch to Th* Call
in 1SS3 paused widespread panic
and resulted in sensational charges
against its president, died in this -city to
day at an advanced age. ..It is said that
worry over his involved estate and the
many suits pending- against him as the
result of the failure of the bank of which
he was the head hastened his end. The
remains will be taken to the United
States for burial. .

CHICAGO. July 12.â The indications to
night are that to-morrow will bring the
commencement of another conflict be
tween the freight handlers' organization
in Chicago and the railroads, such as was
experienced here last summer when the
union was defeated and all but disrupted.
The. difficulty this time is brought about
by a controversy between the Teamsters'
Union and the Kellogg Switchboard and
Supply Company, where the employes
went on strike two months ago because
the firm refused to discharge two. non
union employes. Lately the company's
â¢goods- have been hauled from its factory
by non-union men under police protection.
President Curran of the freight handlers
said to-night that if the Kellogg people
persisted In such a course he would order
a general strike of freight handlers in
i.iis city to-morrow. Tho railroad man
agers said that they were prepared for a
Â«tr1ke
striKe.

LONDON, July 12.â The nervousness
felt regarding the political outlook in the
Balkans and Manchuria tended to restrict
business on the Stock Exchange last
week. The advent of fine weather bene
fiting the home railways, and the cheap
ening of money are expected, however, to
bring a revival of business. American se
curities have Bhown renewed weakness,
partly due to reports that Wall Street
suffered heavily through the rise in cot
ton. The anticipation of a new Issue of
capital for New York Central also tended
to depress the market, the idea being that
difficulty would be experienced in raising
the capital necessary to enable American
railroads to cope with their growing
traffic.
Uncertain Political Outlook in the
Balkans and' Manchuria Tends
to Restrict Business.

Moore was fired upon in the street from

police points to Ross as the man who
fired the shots. Ross, however, accused

In the place at the time say that Dettor
had given general orders to shoot at un
ion pickets who walked the streets out
side the foundry. The shots were fired
from behind a high picket fence.
No Immediate cause for the trouble was
apparent, but during the long strike there
have been threats that blood would be
shed. Four rifles were taken "from the
foundry by the police. The rifles are
claimed to . have been procured by the
head of the company, and the Italian
boss is said to have told his men that
they would be protected If they used the
firearms.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., July 12.â An Italian
strike-breaker at the foundry of L/C.
Stearns & Co. this afternoon shot George
Moore, a union molder, employed else

Three men are under arrest for complic

The engine on the excursion train,
which consisted of twelve coaches heavily

ahead to stop the fast mail, then about

to see the foremost flagman and only
slacked up when warned by ' the second
man. who was within a short distance of
the excursion train. The fast mall was
running at a high rate of speed and It
was/unable to come to a full stop. When
the /fast mall struck it was making fif

the patient. Dr. Lapponi addressed them
all, saying:
"Yes, the Pope is better, but I beg you
not to exaggerate In optimism, in order
to avoid a disillusion later."
Dr. Mazzoni also was absent from the
Pope's side, which in itself gave the
clearest evidence that the doctors them
selves were relieved of Immediate appre
hefision. Dr. Rossonl has been taken sick
with fever and was prevented visiting the
Pope this evening, as he intended.
ARISES AND DRESSES ALONE,
During the afternoon the Pope felt
strong enough to get up. He arose,
dressed himself alone in white and went
to sit In his usual armchair, where he
remained for pome time. Then the win
dows were opened for a change of air,
the sun streaming in, together with a
light, refreshing breeze from the Medit
erranean. Late in the afternoon he re
ceived Cardinals Mathiau, Steinhuber.
Agliardl and Casali. The Pope showed
his usual brightness and lucidity of mind,
and spoke to each without showing any
perceptible fatigue. To Cardinal Mathleu
his Holiness said:
"I have not ceased for one moment to
pray God to protect France and have the
men now governing her repent and stop
the persecution of the church."
He then sent the apostolic blessing to
Cardinal Mathleu's sister, who Is a nun.
He heartily thanked Cardinal Steinhuber.
who told him that the whole Jesuit order
was daily praying for his recovery and
preservation, and he asked Cardinal Ag
liardi hov.- he liked the position of vice
chancellor of the church, to which he
was appointed at the last consistory, and
how the Cardinal enjoyed his new resi
dence, the beautiful and historic palace
of tfie chancellory.
CARDINALS SHAKE HIS HAND.
Hearing that the Cardinal had not yet
moved thither. Pope Leo said: "You must
settle yourself before leaving for the
country." as though the removal was a
remote possibility. He thanked Cardinal
Casali for the warm interest the latter
had taken in his illness and then gave
all the Cardinals his hand to shake.
Aa the King of Spain had telegraphed
to inquire about the Pope's health and
had asked for the papal benediction, his
Holiness directed Cardinal Rampolla to
telegraph back, granting the request. I
Later the Pontiff took a short nap and
slept tranquilly enough, although he
seemed to have somewhat more difficulty
in breathing.
The doctors returned at 7:30 o'clock In
the evening and their evening* bulletin
gave negative encouragement, simply
showing that the favorable conditions of
this morning had been maintained.
Throughout the day St. Peter's was sur
rounded by the usual Sunday worshipers
and steady lines of inquirers visited the
Vatican courtyard, where the bulletins
are Issued.
Unusual rigor was adopted to prevent
unseemly gatherings. One notable in
stance of Vatican sternness was the ar
rest of Captain Smith, commanding the
Swiss Guard, for having given Informa
tion to the press.
IMPRESSIVE PRAYER SERVICE.
There was i striking scene within 8t.
Peter's to-night. In the midst of the
vespers the German students, all in scar
let cassocks, entered the cathedral. Be
hind them came the German friars in
rough hair cloth cassocks and then Ger
man nuns in conventional black and
white. These formed a procession and,
kneeling first at one altar and then at an
other, some prayed aloud and others in
silence for/Pope Leo. .
The congregation Joined in the pro
cession until the basilica was half
circled by a moving mass of color, and,
when St. Peter's tomb was reached, many
hundreds followed the picture of the Sav
ior held aloft by a statuesque monk. On
one side of the brass rails which guard
the entrance to the tomb knelt the nuns.
Opposite, three deep, were â¢ the shorn
heads of the friars, while In the center
knelt the young: students, their scarlet
Judge Pryor and Town Attorney Pis
tolesl are determined to put a stop to
the rowdyism of the soldiers and each
offender will be given the full penalty.
After making the night hideous by
howling and vulgar language, three sol
diers of the Sixty-eighth Company, Coast
Artillery, named Parent, Bailey and Hill
engaged in an altercation in which pistols
were drawn and shots were fired. Luck
ily the town marshal was at hand and

ITALIAN KING AND PRELATE
WHO ARE CONCERNED
OVER POPE'S ILLNESS.
Pictures at the Edinburgh Exhibition" in
1SS7. He next edited a series of "Tudor
Translations," and produced a collection
of "verses for Englishmen" entitled
"Lyra Heroica." With Charles Whibley,
he published an anthology of English
prose, and by himself an anthology of
"English Lyrics."
In collaboration with T. F. Henderson
he edited "The Centenary Burns" with a
terminal essay on the "Life, Genius and
Achievement of Burns," for which the
academy awarded him one of Its prizes
in 1398. He later Issued an edition of the
prose and verse of Byron. In 1S33 Henley
received the honor of the LL. D. degree
at the St. Andrews University. He was
editor of the New Review from its be
ginning in 18S5 till its extinction In 1S97.
Henley aroused the wrath of the Eng
lish critics in December, 1831. by publish
ing in a Christmas periodical an article
reflecting on the character of his dead
friend and former associate. Robert
Louis Stevenson. He was severely scored
by them for disloyalty and bad taste and
for a time literary London was in a
foment over the matter. Henlty took the
onslaught coolly.
Now and then the Pope su3nccts that
something is being concealed lrom him.
To-day, after the visit of the doctors,
when a copy of the medical bulletin was
brought in, he read it attentively and
then rang. To Centra, who appeared In
response to the bell, he said abruptly:
"Bring me another cdpy of the bulletin,"
emphasizing the word "another," and
evidently believing that the first one had
been "doctored" for his benefit, as had
been done before. But to-day Centra was
able triumphantly to bring another identi
cal with the first.
One of the greatest difficulties is to pre
vent the Pope from speaking too much.
When some one is allowed to visit him,
he immediately begins describing the sat
isfaction he felt on the greetings he re
ceived on the occasion of the last jubilee
and also at the manifestations of sympa
thy from all parts of the world during his
present illness, which he considers almost
providential to strengthen the Influence
of the Catholic Church in the person of
its head. Then either the doctor or one
of his nephews steps in and monopolizes
the conversation, obliging the Pope to be
silent, which he does not like at all.
It Is remarkable -what different Impres
sions visitors receive of the Pope's condi
tion, according to their different tejnpera
ments. For instance, when Cardinals
Ferriata, Segna and Cretonl left the sick
room together Cardinal Ferriata, rubbing
his hands, said:
"The Holy Father is almost convales-.
cent. We shall soon see him in the Vati
can gardens again."
Cardinal Segna, making the sign of the
cross, sighed: "Our beloved Pontiff is
lost," while Cardinal Cretonl, shaking his
head in doubt, exclaimed: "Who knows?
He may die; still he may get better."
INFLUENCE OF AMERICA.
The newspaper Italia publishes an arti
cle with reference to the Journey of Car
dinal Gibbons to Rome, in which it says:
The Cardinal will certainly be one of the most
remarkable personalities in the approaching
conclave, representing, as he doea, 35,000.000
Catholics. If the successor to St. Peter were
to be chosen by popular vote. America's Influ
ence In the election would not.be inferior to
that of any other power, but the great Ameri
can nation will be represented by only a single
Cardinal, while Spain, with less than half the
number of Catholics in the United States, has
four times the number of Cardinals In the con
clave. But, perhaps, because he is alone. Car
dinal Gibbons will represent a moral force of
the first rank. I lie is , the only Cardinal who
Is absolutely free and independent of all the
petty Intrigues and machinations which to some
extent precede a conclave.
: King Victor Emmanuel has given orders
As many fantastic descriptions are in
circulation regarding the room . where
Pope Leo lies, a representative of the
press has taken^some pains to obtain an
exact account from one of the Pope's
nephews, who sees his uncle daily. The
room Is large, bright and airy. The walls
are hung with pale green and goldjike
damask. Entering it with the sun'pour
ing through the ample windows. Is like
a taste of spring. A large curtain - di
vides the room and is drawn open; show
ing on the right the modest, narrow brass
bed, covered with a red damask cover.
In his condition, Pope Leo shows great
daintiness with regard to his person, per
forming a full toilet whenever possible
and changing dally his fine white batiste
night robe. At the head of the bed is a
good picture of the Madonna, beside a
holy water font, while in the middle of
the adjacent wall is an immense crufciflx,
reaching from floor to celling, with an
ivory figure of Christ. At the foot of the
bed stands a very simple walnut writing
desk, at which the Pope has written the
best of his Latin poems. On the other
side is the now famous arm chair, which
Is most comfortable; a small table, a few
shelves with the Pope's preferred books,
and nothing more.
The chamber gives the idea of extreme
simplicity, luxuries being rigorously ban
ished. Even in his present condition. Pope
Leo has great objection to having per
sons about him, unless especially called,
so that except in the moments when he
was much worse, even Dr. Lapponi and
the valet. Centra, could not enter unless
he rang. '
Centra, who is most rductant to leave
the room, asked this morning if the
Pontiff did not think it better to have
some one always to keep him company.
Pope Leo replied, "I am In good com
pany," pointing to the large crucifix.

rosary ended, the Germans filed out, their
heads still bent in prayer.
POPE'S PLAIN SURROUNDINGS.
ROME. July 12.â Pope Leo has lived
to sec another Sunday and with
the Sabbath quiet which fell upon
Rome came also peace and even
progress to the Pontiff. Beginning this
morning with distinct signs of improve
ment, he maintained this throughout the
day. To-night Dr. Lapponi made the fol
lowing Important statement to the ques
tion if he believed the Pope's improved
condition could continue:
â¢'I believe that if the Pope lasts until
July II we may not perhaps achieve an
absolute cure, but we will secure such a
good state of health in the patient as will
allay our anxiety.
During the morning the Pontiff partici
pated In the celebration of mass. The
'ceremony was held in the chapel adjoin
ing the eick chamber. Monsigneur Mar

necting the pick room with the chapel
Â¦was opened fo that his Holiness might
follow the services. He insisted that Dr.
Lapponi and his valet. Plo Centra, leave
his side and enter the chapel, in order to
better hear the mass.
The history of the day has be>en compar
atively uneventful. The Pontiff had sev
eral hours' repose, Dr. Lapponi resting
near him ihro'jghout the night. The phy
sician twice administered stimulants to
him, once of digitalis to strengthen the
heart and once of camphor caffeine to
overcome the paxtezxffl growing depres
sion. This morning found the Pontiff with
Fpirits bright and the conditions generally
improved.

William Ernest Henley, the poet, critic,
dramatist, and editor, was born at Glou
cester August 23, 1S-I9. In his early years
he suffered much from ill-health, and his
first book, "In Hospital: Rhymes and
Rhymes," published in 1SS8, was a record
of experiences in the Old Infirmary,
Edinburgh, from 1S73 to 1S73. This was
the opening section of his "Book of
Verses," which attained to a fourth edi
tion in 1S93. In 1S75 he began writing for
the London magazines, and in 1S77 was
one of the founders as well as the editor
of London.
LONDON, July 12.â William Ernest
Henley, poet and collaborator in
several plays with Robert Louis
Stevenson, died this evening at
the age of 54 years at his residence at
Woklng. He was in his usual Uiealth
until a fortnight ago. He then felt sick
and was obliged to keep his room but
was not conlined to his bod. On Satur
day he became worse and a doctor was
summoned. He died suddenly at 9:30
o'clock this evening of heart failure, fol
lowing on nephritis. The papers contain
long obituaries and editorial articles in
which they regret the "loss of one of the
foremost and most striking of British
writers."
This evening the authorities here took
charge of young Simmons and he finally
confessed that he had ridden here last
night from Los Angeles on a bicycle, as
sisted the girl out s of the window, and.
taking her to Monrovia, placed her on
board a train. He has a brother-in-law
in Lnrned, Texas, and she was tc go there
and wait for him. He says he intended to
follow her in a few weeks. He will not be
given that opportunity, for the Revl Mr.
Jent will lay the matter before the Dis
trict Attorney to-morrow and if possible
proceed 'against Simmons criminally.
Telegrams have been sent ea3t to in
tercept the girl and have her returned
here. Because Simmons' story is not be
lieved by many persons, the friends of
Mr. Jent are continuing the search for
her in this vicinity.
This mornlns when the Rev. Mr. Jent
went to call his daughter he found that
nor bed had not been occupied. An open
window and footprints beneath it showed
how she had left the house. The Los
Angelfs police department and the Sher
iff's office were at once notified and asked
to ilnd the girl, and despite the fact that
officers searched for her all day no trace
of her could be found.
The young lady's absence was discov
ered earlv this morning, but It was not
until to-night that the truth became
known through the confession of the man
in the case. He is Carl Simmons, whose
home is in Los Angeles. Â«*ie has known
the girl for months, but until a few weeks
ago, when her parents learned that they
contemplated marriage, their relations
were supposed to be only those of ac
quaintances. He was forbidden to call
at her home and she was forbidden to
communicate with him. but through a
younger brother she regularly correspond
ed with him and arranged for the de
parture, which has left her oaients al
most heartbroken.

Yesterday, however, failed to bring
forth the desired results. Agulrre real
ized that all chances of remaining had
passed and now he proposes to vent spite
upon innocent parties. Just how many
more guards will go is a mere conjecture.
Those who profess to know, however, as
sert that the next few days will bring
many more surprises and that before the
prison directors meet on next Saturday
in San Francisco to erect a warden,
Aguirre will make It necessary for some
one to name a long list of guards and
petty officials.
Some of the guards who have been dis
charged assert that Agulrre laid all sorts
of traps in order to get a chance to cut
them from the payroll. As yet only those
near the outside gate, as it were, have
felt the disappointed warden's power, but
some of the guards and even the head
officials Inside the jute mill are daily ex
pecting to receive notice that their ser
vices are no further required. The war
den himself will not talk upon the sub
ject, claiming it is his own affair. In an
interview to-night Aguirre said:
"I did let out some of my men, but just
why I did it Is nobody's business. If they
had not deserved to be discharged they
would be here still. From the beginning
of my administration at this prison I
deemed It most essential that there should
only be one head to this institution.
Whenever I found that others werfc at
tempting to undermine me, why it' was
best to let them go. Further than this
I have absolutely nothing to say.
FINE RECOBDS FORGOTT^J.
The records of the men discharged aro
absolutely above reproach. ' Henry S.
Chappelear has been employed at the
prison during several wardens" adminis
trations and had been the steward of the
convicts' mess for the past twelve years.
He is well known to have been a most
efficient officer and one of the most com
petent stewards the prison has ever had.
Judson S. Kerfoot is also an oldtime
official. For the past fourteen years he had
creditably held the watch tower of "God
dess of Liberty." On one occasion sev
eral years ago Kerfoot is known to have
stopped a gang of convicts from escap
ing from the prison reservation- by the
prompt use of a gatllng gun. which was
in his tower. The convicts escaped from
the prison yard but by careful aiming of
the magazine gun. the fugitives were
compelled to seek shelter and eventually
were captured. All the other men dis
charged to-day were competent attaches,
but had incurred the enmity of the retir
ing warden.
To-day flvo of the most efficient guards
and one of the most competent officers of
the penitentiary were given their walking
papers. No reason was attributed for the
discharges and even these victims of
Agulrre's wrath have not the faintest idea
why they must hunt for other Jobs. Alt
h* will tell them Is that they were taken
off the payroll for good and sufficient
reasons. Friends of the discharged at
taches assert, however, tnat the present
Warden proposes to make a "clean-up"
of various employes and that In the next
few days many more trusted men will bo
officially decapitated.
The men who to-day felt the keenness
of Agulre's ax were Henry S. Chappelear.
Clarence E. Chappelear. Leander Carpen
ter, John Carpenter. Judson G. Kerfoot
and Joseph W. Hasklns. On July 1
Aguirre cut off several of the best at
taches of the penal institution from the
payroll, but the discharges caused so
much comment that he refrained from
scalping others. His list was long, but
he imagined he might have some possible
chance to retain his position and there
fore did not care to hamper his opportuni
ties for reappointment.

NEW conditions were visible in trade last week.
General business throughout the country ex
hibited increased activity and firmness, with
a better demand for goods reported all over the
country, and yet Wail street stocks, which are in
fluenced almost wholly (or supposedly so) by these
camt general trade conditions, were weak and de
clining, nobody apparently knowing why. This par
adoxical condition of frade hardly ever occuts.
Not even the mo%t astute financiers pretended to
definitely explain last week's marked weakness in the
New York stock market. For several days the whole
list of industrials and railroad shares declined and
the most vigorous professional support failed to
check the depreciation. Guesses were numerous, but
they were merely guesses. The general supposition
was that liquidation was not yet over, as previously
supposed, and this is about as good an explanation
as any. The Government crop report and the per
sistent poor threshing returns from the wheat belt,
finally culminating in the issuance of the report which
indicated a wheat crop of less than r 700,000,000
bushels, agaihsf an expected showing of- 750,000,000
or 800.000.000 a month or two ago, might have had
something to do with the depreciation, but this is
meri conjecture.
But. as said before, general trade made a better
cxhiit than for several months. The retail trade
in ilimmer goods showed marked improvement, with
many reorders: the wholesale business brightened up
under larger orders from the jobbers and practically
sure prospects of abundant harvests gave the whole
situation a brighter aspect. The improvement was
general rather than special, for taken individually
conditions did not appear especially encouraging. In
the first place iron and steel were dull, unsettled and
not over firm, while provisions persisted in being
weak at Chicago in spite of the attempts of the
packers to hold up the market. Both of these com
modities are accepted as very good barometers of
trade. There was an advance in ra*- wool, but no
other staple showed any improvement in quotations,
while a number declined. Still, the tenor of the
commercial reports was uniformlj' cheerful and the
impression seemed to prevail that the commerce of
the country, both foreign and domestic, was in pretty
good condition in spite of the pessimism of the past
several months. This cheerful confidence in the fu
ture is about as difficult to explain as the decline in
the New York stock market. Nobody seems able
to give a satisfactory reason for either. Taking up
the great staples of the country seriatim and con
sidering them from all sides give no grounds for
either optimism or pessimism, for regarded in this
aspect general business remains precisely as for a
month or so back. The bank clearings show very
little fluctuation from week to week, the percentages
of gains and losses as compared with corresponding
periods in 1902 being small. Last week there was
a gain of 7 per cent. Next week may show a loss
of the same per cent. Thus the tide of business
flows on week after week. The failures last week
were 104. against 193 last year. The railroad earn
ings in June were 13 per cent larger than in June,
1002, and 25.3 larger than in 1901. As to the plane
of quotations, Dun's index number showed a slight
advance in June, being $99,456, against $98,936 in

In order to mystify foreign naval experts and to conceal
increases made in the Russian navy the. Admiralty permits
little accurate Information to be given out. Contradictory
statements as to types, size, armament and speed confosa
all experts. The latest mystification is practiced In chang
ing the names of torpedoboat-destroyers, new names being
given to old boats ' aTsd an interchanging 1 of names of new
boats of different sizes and types. This plan effectually pre
vents foreigners from knowing the. exact number of de
stroyers in the Russian navy.
A new scale of rations has been adopted In the British
navy to go into effect October 1. Instead of the old systera
of only three recognized meals a dayâ the last of which ia
at four In the afternoonâ the crew will have four meals.
Breakfast is to be at eight o'clock, dinner from twelve to
one, tea between four and five, and supper, the extra meal,
about eight o'clock. Hitherto the men had to provide sup
per at their own expense. A further improvement Is Rja.de
in this that the rations are no longer to be served In tha
form of a pound of meat and a certain quantity of bread
per day. instead of which a greater variety of articles will
be Issued. The new scale cf dietary includes Jam. vege
tablesâfresh and preservedâ condensed milk, raisins, etc,
while the present meat ration will be slightly reduced.
A new school for navigating officers of the British,, navy

The German third-class cruiser Frauenlob of 2663 tons, 8000
horsepower and 21 knots, was built within seventeen months
by the Weser Shipbuilding Company, and her steam trials
have given satisfactory results. Its eight-hour trial under
full power took place on March 19 last and developed thÂ«
calculated horsepower and speed. Later on, the vessel mada
four runs over a measured mile and averaged 85M horse
power and 21.102 knots. Her most economi
cal performance was found to be 11.8 knot3 with S3.9 revo
lutions and 1259 horsepower. The Frauenlob being Intended
for foreign service is wood-sheathed and coppered, by which
the vessel maintains Its high speed without being compelled
to so into dock for cleaning.
The use of oil as fuel has proved a success on the Mara
and Hannibal, battleships In the British navy. Experiments
have been in progress on these two ships during*. the pas:
three months, one-half of the number of boilers being fitted
for oil burning and the other boilers using coal. The trials
have demonstrated that while oil gives as much smoke as
coal the advantage is with liquid fuel in that It haa given
greater speeds and ability to keep at sea for a longer
period owing to reduced consumption. All the boilers In tha
two ships named are now to be fitted with oil burning ap

PERSONAL MENTION.
The selection of C. W. Rae as successor to George W.
Melville as chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering is a
disappointment to the recular line officers of which several
were candidates for this desireable office. Mr. Rae, how
ever, possesses the requisite theoretical and practical â¢quali
fications and is considered the best selection that could be
made. He was graduated from the first class of engineer
students at the Naval Academy in 1SSS and during his thir
ty-six years and nine months of -service has been a mem
ber of several important boards requiring expert engineer
ing and general scientific knowledge, besides taking his
share of sea duty. He is popular in Washington where his
duties required his presence for a number of years. His
service record to date is fourteen years and six months
at sea, chiefly on the European station; twenty years and
two months shore duty, largely in Washington and at the
Naval Academy, and only two years and one month unem
ployed. During the recent war Mr. Rae was chief engineer
of the battleship Iowa, the steaming performance of which
during the battle of Santiago was rather a disappointment
as contrasted with that of the Oregon. The failure of the
Iowa, however, was no doubt due to conditions beyond the
control of its ship engineer. Mr. Rae will relieve Engineer
in-Chlef 'Melville in August next and his retirement on ac
count of age takes place June 30, 1903.
Chief petty officers in United States navy are to receive
$70 a month after July 1. The present pay of this class,
embracing twelve designations, ranges from $52 to $70 a
month, and the increase is not to apply to those already
in the service but only to such as shall receive permanent
employment after a competitive examination. A new rat-
The u Bureau of Steam Engineering, which has been pre
paring plans for a scout ship with turbines, has found that
the increase in size of the turbine exceeds in rapidity the
increase in power, and that turbines as now designed are
far too large for use in small vessels of high speed. To
overcome this difficulty two alternatives present themselves,
one being to build the vessel with a highly arched deck;
the other to discard the deck altogether and substitute side
armor as protection.
The Brooklyn navy yard mechanics have appealed to Sec
retary Moody for his decision regarding the fifteen days
leave which the law allows them during the year. They
complain that they are not permitted to take this leave as
they would like to have it, but that it is doled out in small
sections and that they are forced to take it whether they
like it or not. Last summer it was the custom to make the
men take a half holiday each Saturday for thirty succes
sive weeks, and they ask now to have this practice discon
tinued and that they be permitted to take two or three
days off at a time. The heads of departments, as well
as the commandant, oppose the plan of the mechanics.
The Connecticut, building in the New York navy yard. Is
estimated to cost $3,952,000. against J3.9M.000 for the Louisi
ana, building by contract at Newport News. The sum au
thorized by Congress to be expended on each of these five
ships is H ,212.000, exclusive of armor and armament, leav
ing J2G0.000 for equipment for the Connecticut, but only
a $33,000 surplus for the same purposes for the Kansas.
This latter margin will be entirely wiped out in extras to
contractors and work done by the Government to complete
the ships and it is evident that there will be a deficiency
in the building of these ships of not less than $3)0.000 in the
aggregate.
WHEN our fleet was at Kiel the Kaiser
poured forth in commendation of the
American people a stream of words about
as sparkling and as exuberant as the champagne
that gave it a glow even if it did not inspire it. Now
in London King Edward has been equally gracious.
His method of speech is of course radically different
from that of the Kaiser. He speaks as a diplomat,,
while the Kaiser has the oratorical instinct and talks
with a flow that sometimes makes diplomatists gasp
and stare.
The commendation of crowned heads is not likely
to turn our head?. We have British blood among
our people and German blood also. We have a cer
tain liking for the sovereigns who hold the loyalty
of ourBritish and our German cousins. We delight
therefore in receiving the praise of royalty as a sort
of evidence of cousinly regard, and we are averse to
analyzing it too critically. Still in this case we can
hardly forbear believing that much of the commen
dation is due to the fact that we are getting to be
the biggest power on the globe, and that Kaiser and
King are gracious to us because we axe strong and
not because of any recognition on their part of dis
tant cousinship.
The American colony in London is now numerous
enough and influential enough to cut a conspicuous
figure in the cosmopolitan , world, and accordingly
when it speaks the world listens. It has just spoken
on the occasion of the celebration of the Fourth of
July and in doing so has been profuse in professions
of friendship toward Great Britain. Such professions
are natural enough. It is but right that a visitor in
a foreign land should, speak kindly of the natives
who give him welcome and enable him to have a
good time. Were there as strong an American col
ony in Berlin as in London we should have had
equally fervent professions there- of American love
of the fatherland. In fact when it comes to talking
love international we are about as eloquent as either
King or Kaiser.
Something like a love feast is going on between
our republic and the royalties of the Old World and
perhaps the world is the better for it. At any rate
no harm is done. Meantime neither Great Britain,
Germany nor ourselves will cease to strengthen naval
armaments. It is agreed at the love feasts that a
combination of the three powers could assure the
peace of the world, but it seems to be understood
that as yet they are by no means so loving as to
venture to ally themselves with one another and un
dertake the job.

made, which will be Incorporated in the new ships, but no
increase in displacement nor speed is contemplated. Tad
Chitose was built at the Union Iron "Works and has evi

its bids for the Louisiana 11.14 per cent over the Virginia

Minnesota, the horsepower is 2500 greater in the first named

DESPITE the well nigh universal opinion that
Cleveland cannot be seriously considered as
a- candidate for the Presidency next year, the
Brooklyn Eagle insists he will be by all odds the
strongest figure in the Democratic convention and
will have a fair prospect of carrying the country.
In confirmation of its views the Eagle has recently
printed a long letter on the subject from a corre
spondent who writes from the summer home of Mr.
Cleveland at Buzzard's Bay. Of the letter the Eagle
says in a double-leaded editorial: "The statements
which the correspondent makes are interesting, im
portant and suggestive, and arc quite likely to prove
historical. They, will not be questioned because they
cannot be. They will not be misunderstood and'for
the same reason. They will not be underestimated
by any intelligent politician, by any. enlightened
statesman, or by any thoughtful citizen. Nor can
they be easily overestimated, for their significance
is unmistakable and unescapable."
With that declaration by way of introduction the
article commands attention. The correspondent
does not assert positively that Mr. Cleveland will
be a candidate, but intimates as much. He says:
"The keyword to a determination of what the course
of Grover Cleveland will be is 'duty.' If in the de
velopment of events it can be made to appear to him
that it is a duty which he owes to the party and to
the country, those who know him well anticipate he
will accept another nomination and obey the call.
He recognizes the obligations of- duty as few men
do. It means much to him, and it will be with him
as in the past, swaying with him. All those then
who wish an answer to the question can find it in
watching the development of the political situation
of the next nine months."
The writer goes on to say further that the friends
of Mr. Cleveland are not asking him to declare his
position at this time. Those who are trying to get
an answer from him, or who are making demands on
him for a declaration of his intentions, are his op
ponents. He quotes "a man who knows Mr. Cleve
land as well as one can know another." as saying:
"Such demands can only confirm Mr. Cleveland in
his determination to remain silent during these days
of development. And. indeed, I imagine there is
enough Adam in the former President to refuse to
gratify them by an expression. If he were to signify
that he would accept a nomination they would imme
diately lift up a great shout that they had smoked
him out; if he were to say that he would not take
a nomination, they would declare with a flourish of
trumpets that they had driven him off. Whatever
he might say would be tortured to suit their ends."
The sort of developments which are expected by
Mr. Cleveland's friends to bring him back into ac
tive political life are those which lead to a "rehabili
tation of the party in the esteem of the people, bring
it back to old and tried principles and cast off the
errors and sophistries that have led it into disaster
and nearly into destruction."
If that view be correct it is by no means improba
ble that Mr. Cleveland may be the nominee of the
party, for it is unquestionable that in the South and
in the West the drift of Democratic sentiment is
clearly in the direction of Clevelandism as against
Bryanism. That tendency has been demonstrated in
well nigh every Democratic State convention of the
year, and has been further revealed in the expressions
of newspapers and of Democratic leaders. In fact
Bryan by his assumption of dictatorial powers in the
party has alienated thousands who might otherwise
have supported him, and it is now becoming ques
tionable whether he will be able to control even so
much as an important faction in the national con
vention.
As to Cleveland's relation to the revolt against
Bryanism the writer says: "He looks with leniency
arid equanimity on the use of his name in giving
direction to the movement within the party which
cannot fail to arouse among its members an old time
love and enthusiasm for the creed of pure Democ-
Then follows this statement: "In various utter
ances, by tongue and pen, Grover Cleveland has le # ft
the party and indeed the country in no doubt as to
what should be the future policy of the Democratic
party and what principles it should espouse. Disin
clined to talk to interviewers, at least on his own re
lation to the party, he has been free to speak of
party principles. He regards tariff reform as the
most important issue and believes that the best as
surance of success in the coming campaign is an
insistence upon its old-time doctrine of a fair and
beneficent tariff adjustment. He believes thousands
who have not declared irrevocably their party affilia
tions await an opportunity to espouse a cause in
which tariff reform is made the chief issue. Hardly
second to this is administrative reform, and in the
recent disclosures at Washington this question has
gained an\ importance it had not a few months ago
in the public mind. Sound money should be an
affirmative declaration and the present financial sys
; tern perfected by the necessary legislation."
Such is the understanding of the attitude of Cleve
land by those who are near to him and are in com
munication with his closest friends. They hold that
Cleveland should not be urged into making a de
cisive statement at this time. It is with them a wait
ing game. It appears as if everything were moving
in their direction, and that they have nothing to do
but to sit still and let the nomination come to Cleve
land without effort on his part or on theirs. It is
certainly an interesting situation, and the Eagle is
fully justified in pressing it upon the attention of the
rftiblic
to a long discussed project of Scottish business en
terprise, and as a consequence plans are now being
made for the opening of a deep canal capable: of
affording passageway to the largest ships afloat from
the Clyde to the Forth. ;
The proposed water way will be about forty miles
long, but some ten miles of that distance will be
through Loch Lomond. * The estimated cost is about
$50,000,000. Â¦ The money required for a careful sur
vey of the route and for obtaining approximate cal
culations as to construction has been deposited by
a syndicate that purposes to undertake the work,
and it "is announced that plans for the enterprise will
be submitted to the public in November.
Naval authorities are quoted as saying the canal
will be of the highest strategic value and it is for
that reason the Government will give its aid to the
enterprise. When opened the canal will enable
British fleets to pass at once from the waters of one
coast to those of the other without having to make
a long voyage. The effective strength of the channel
and home fleets will therefore be materially in
creased. From a commercial point of view also the
work will be of great importance to the Scottish
people.'
In comparison with its length the canal will be
one-of the most costly of modern times. The Cale
donian canal, sixty miles long, cost but $6,000,000.
The Kaiser Wilhelm canal, sixty-one miles long,
cost about $40,000,000. The record for extreme cost,
however, will remain with the Manchester canal, for
that work, while only thirty-five miles in length, cost
inMhe neighborhood of $75,000,000.

and divided the money with the others,
but they now assert he kept by far the
larger share.
The trio then started for Chicago, and
on the way Engvall was robbed of nearly
$400, he says, by the other two. He was
afraid to report the case, but swore he
would be revenged. He paid the debt by
confessing the whole crime after his ar
rest in Chicago, and but for that confes
sion he and Reinleln would probably have
been released after a time because there
was little positive evidence to connect
them with the crime.
The capture of the gang resulted from
the receipt of an anonymous letter by the
Los Angeles police, telling them to look
up Engvall In a Chicago hotel, and also
mentioning Reinlein. This letter was
turned over to detectives and the two
boys were taken into custody. The offi
cers secured a confession, first from Eng
vall, and then both boys told of Baer's
connection with" the crime. All that re
mained for the officers then to do was
to have them brought back to Los An

LOS ANGELES, July 12â Three
youths, hardly more than merÂ»
boys, only one of whom has at
tained his majority, are prisoners
In the Los Angeles city Jail, self
confessed thieve? t guilty of the biggest
diamond robbery ever committed in this
j city, and. despite their youth, they have
i expressed not the slightest regret for
their crime.
They were brought back from Chicago
a few days ago, where they were cap
tured more by accident than by the exer
cise of any great detective ability, al
though the police of half a dozen cities
had been on the lookout for them or their
booty for several months. The thieves are
certain to be sent to the penitentiary, but
it is doubtful If any large portion of the
515,000 worth of diamonds and jewelry
they stole will ever be recovered. It was
disposed of in various places, most of it
in New York, for much less than its real
value, and the proceeds have been spent
long sipce by the thieves.
Tne prisoners are William Baer. aged 21
years, the leader of the trio; John Eng
vall and Charles Reinleln, aged 20 years
and 18 years respectively. Although of
tender years, hardened criminals could
not appear to be less concerned as to the
consequences of their crime; in fact, they
are boastful of It The onlv feel-
Ing they have expressed is that of a de
sire for revenge, each against the others,
for each believes the others responsible
for his capture, and to them capture was
worse than the commission of the crime.
All were bellboys. It was while work
ing as such at Hotel Melrose, a fashion
able family hotel in this city, that the
opportunity was presented, and quickly
embraced, Jo commit the crime which
has given them the undesirable distinc
tion to "turning the largest trick" in a
criminal line that has engaged the atten
tion of the local Police Department in
many years.
They received their training in Chicago
and came here last September Just before
the beginning of the annual tourist rush
to California. They worked at various
hotels and finally secured employment at
the Melrose. Among the guests at the
house early In October was Mrs. I. D.
Webster, a wealthy widow, whose home
is in Brooklyn, N. Y., and who spends her
winters in California. She carried with
her diamonds and other Jewelry worth
nearly $20,000. nearly all of it being con
tained in a fancy jewel case made es
pecially for it. As a matter of precaution
she placed this case in the hotel safe
and took from it, from time to time, such
articles as she desired to use. Thus the
bellboys learned ot Its presence there and
of its contents.
CHANCE FOB THEFT.
Reinleln had been appointed night clerk
at the hotel, because he had.displayed un
usual ability in such work, and this ap
pointment was Just what the trio wanted
to complete their plan of securing Mrs.
Webster's Jewelry. Fortunately for them
she decided to go to Coronado and not
caring to take her diamonds with her left
them, as she thought. In the hotel safe. 5
"That was just the chance we wanted,"
said Reinlein in his confession. "We
knew we would have time to make a
get-away and no one would know' that
the stuff had been lifted. The night she
left the house. October 26. I was on the
night trick and I emptied that Jewel case
in a napkin and put the empty, case back
into the safe. We three got together and
decided to hide the stuff and then quit
one at a time, so that we would not be
suspected. We knew. that nothing would
he thought of it when we quit, for bell
boys quit such jobs every week. * As long
as the case was not opened, no one would
know of the robbery. The plan worked
Just as we thought it would and we then
shipped the stuff to New Orleans and
followed it there. We pawned a diamond
cluster worth $1000 for about 5200 to get
the coin we needed and then left here. I
don't know why they did not get after
us sooner, and if Baer had acted square
with us we wouldn't have been pinched.
He got more money out of the stuff than
he told us he got and when me and Eng
vall were caught we just told what he
had to do with it. If Engvall hadn't
got cold feet and hollered, they couldn't
have done nothing with us, but we're up
against it now."
It was not until the return of Mrs.
Webster from Coronado, nearly two
months after her departure, that the
robbery was discovered. Meantime sev
eral other persons had had access to the
safe and at first suspicion was not di
rected to the three boys who had com
mitted the crime. The accidental finding
of a diamond ring in a room In a. lodging
house occupied by them the night before
their departure led to their being sus
pected, but that was nearly three months
after the robbery.
FINDING OF DIAMONDS.
The ring was identified by Mrs. Web
ster. 'Â¦ A few days later through the San
Francisco Police Department a diamond
cluster was recovered in that city, f Theso
t,wo pieces of Jewelry are all that have
been recovered, and the thieves admit
they do not know what became of the
balance. When they reached New Or
lae.ns they sold part of their plunder and
while Engvall and Relnlein remained in
that city, working at different hotels,

LOS ANGELES, July 12.â It is stated
on reliable authority that the Huntlngton-
Hellman street railway syndicate will, on
next Wednesday, assume control <jf all
the street railway lines in Los AngVes,
including the Los Angeles traction sys
tem.
The price paid for the traction system
Is stated as $1.7S5,0C0. The battle, which
was at Its height when $110,000 was paid
for a franchise on West Sixth street, will
thus have culminated In the consolidation
of all the street railway systems in Los
Angeles under one ownership.
It was definitely stated Saturday that
the Clark option on the traction com
pany's system was transferred to the
Huntington-Hellman syndicate before Fl.
E. Huntington left Los Angeles and that
the property will be transferred not later
than Wednesday.
The holdings of the Los Angeles Trac
tion Company, which include the Cali
fornia Pacific Railway with a trackage of
twenty miles, consists of forty-nine miles
of street track, together with power
houses, sub-station and rolling stock val
ued at almost $1,000,000. The gross earn
ings of the company last year amounted
to $270,763 and the net earnings were $115,
60). Most of the city franchises of. the
traction company run until 1944.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. July 12.â
Professor William Russell Dudley, of the
botany department at the University and
secretary' for the commissioners who have
in charge the preparation of the new Big
l>asin Park for public use, said to-day
that for various reasons the Park was not
yet ready to be opened, that on June 15
the commissioners had unanimously
passed a resolution to exclude campers
from the Big Basin this year, and that
Mrs. White, president of the Semper
virtns Club, was mistaken in her state
ment concerning campers. When asked
for a detailed statement of the facts Pro
ftssor Dudley replied:
"There Is not a great deal to be said,
as there Is no foundation in fact to the
?â¢ssential points In the complaint. Since
the adoption, on June 15, of the rejfula
:ion prohibiting- the camping: of pleasure
putlea In the California Redwood Park
v.\ account of danger from tire in the tim
ber on the eastern side of the Park during
ihe dry season of this year, no permits
whatever, except to Governor Pardee and
quests invited by him, have been piven
oat by the secretary, or by any lndivid
::. I member of the commission, so far as
J Prow.
"The commission itself, in accordance j
with its published plans, has since June j
:* directed an engineer and his assistants i
10 fix the prade of a road already sur- j
vryed ir.to the area of the Park where j
are assembled the finest of the trees; it
has also allowed a party of geologists, j
engagt-d in plotting the structure of the
rocks in the Santa Cruz range of moun
tains for the United States Geological '
Survey.. to camp in the Park for a week
In pursuit of their work.
"It is rxi'ected that other similar sur
veys In small parties, doing work of ac
tual use to the commission, will enter
tbfl Park in the future; but since the j
adoption of the above named regulation j
r>o primits have been granted by the com- J
mlssioners In favor of any general camp
ers. }frs. White, who has recently be-
D08M a member and the president of the
Pcmpervirens Club, has been greatly mis
informed by some person recently visiting
the Park."
Professor Dudley expressed his respect
for Mrs. White and her generous devo
tion several years ago to the work of in
tfrcstir.g the rx'ople of California in the
proposed purchase of the famous Cala
veras Sequela Grove by the United States.
The party of campers from the St, Mat
thew's School went into the Big Basin
early in June before the time of the com
missioners' meeting. Upon apftying for
permission to go in they received It under
the practice that* had prevailed since the
land was bought last September until the
middle of June, 15Â»i3, of permitting respon
t-!b!e parties and experienced campers in
e mall numbers to camp in the Park. They
were given a permit under the same con- I
ditions that prevailed when the President
of the Sempervirens Club was gladly
granted leave to camp in the Park with
a party some months previous at the time
of her first visit.
"There have been forest fires lately,"
he said, "extending over the ridge from
thÂ«Â» little basin of Scott's creek to the
Waddell creek In the Big Basin. The
guardian and eight men had extreme dif
ficulty in keeping the flames from the
heavy timber of the Park. Only by work
ing day and night and by backfiring were
they able to bring it under control, and
that was after several acres across the
Park boundary line had been swept. Al
though there is fire raging along the San
I^orenzo district and In the Santa Cruz
forests there is no further danger to the
Park, the guardian having the assistance,
of five men all the time, and there being
a gang of lumbermen within call."
Professor Dudley said the basin will be
ready for campers during next year and
thereafter.
TIENTSIN. JuJy 12.â M. Lessar. the Rus
nia.il Minister, will leave Port Arthur on his
return to I'eit'.T.K r.n July 14.

to allow for adjusting a neck
tie without springing the col-

close together in front, it keeps
the tie in place and you don't
see the cut-out part. Besides
the tie is retained just over the
button, which is also kept out of fight.

TACOMA, July 12.â The morning game
was a brilliant, hard-fought contest, with
dashes of sensational fielding, in which Lynch
and Fay were the star performers. The game
was anybody's until the eighth, when Byers
hit for two sacks, and, with two out. Fiannery
doubted and Fay singled, scoring two runs.
Both Blewett and Slagle were steady and ef
fective with men on bases.
In the afternoon Nichols had the Tigers at
his merry and would have scored a shut-out
except for a passed bull In the first inning
which allowed Lynch to score and Diesel's
wild throw In -the fourth allowing Byers to
score. Baker had nothing Spokane could not
hit and struck out nobody. The fielding of
both teams was very ragged. Spokane scoring
five unearned runs in the first Inning off one
clean hit and a bunt mixed with errors. At

Twenty-one teams competed in the
handicap doubles tournament for the
challenge cups on the Golden Gate Park
courts yesterday. When time was called,
late in the afternoon, but three teams
were left to struggle for final honors. In
the lower half Stewart Gayne3S and Guy
Lytton worked their way Into the finals,
while in the upper half Will Allen and
Grant Smith will be opposed to Robert X.
Whitney and Jules Brady in the semi
finals. The winner of this match will
meet Lytton and Gayness next Sunday at
2:30 o'clock.
For a tournament of this kind there was
considerable more class than usual, and
most of the matches were very close and
interesting. Routh and Dunlau and the
Hotchklss brothers, the two scratch
teams, were beaten. Allen and Smith, the
most heavily handicapped team, playing
from 15 back of scratch, won both their
matches without losing a set. In their
match with Clarence Griffin and George
Janes, who received odds of "Vi of 15,"
Smith and Allen played great tennis and
won handily. The ponies had a lead of
3-1 in the first set, but their opponents
forced them away from the net and took
eight straight games.
Smith and Allen are the only team left
in the tournament with their names on
the cups. They won the trophies last
time and should they be succpssful Sun
day will be tied with the Hotchklss broth
ers, who have won them twice. Routh
and Dunlap have one win to their credit.

Palo Alto at 1 0 to 1 Loses in
First Round to Mickey
Free.
It was a great crowd that filled the
grand stand and bettln? ring at Union
Park yesterday. The reopening of the
big coursing grounds saw many of the
old-time followers of the game picking
winners and incidentally tearing a ticket
on a loser or two.
To the players who cash only when tho
flag of a favorite Is raise-.! the stake will
go down in history as a profitable one.
Twenty-six trials were run. every one of
which was productive to trie talent, be
fore a choice failed to get the decision.
A. R. Curtis' Charta was the first to
break faith with the wise ones. Charta
has been a flag raiser on many occasions
and against Lady Granarrt the talent fig
ured her a good one to carry their money.
She carried it, but pat far enough to lose
it for keeps. The Lady, whose backers
got 5 to 1 for their coin, won the course
without much of a struggle.
Then came the top notcher. Palo Alto,
with a hard throwdown. Ten to one was
the price offered that he would beat
Mickey Free. It looked such an easy
thing that the pikers kept oft and luckily
for the moneyed men but few ticket*
were written.
Gearys champion set the pace and took
a three lengths' lead, but after scoring
five points was overcome by his chronic
disease, laziness, and let Mickey run up
six and beat him out.
Cascade against Reckless Acrobat,
Reno's beat of Lord Erazen at 3 to 1, Sil
ver Heels' win from Tralee Boy at 2 to 1
and Dom Pedro's victory of Benegade
Apache made up the half-dozen short
ends that were recorded.
Rector won the stake, taking final hon
ors from Silver Heels. The Curtis dog's
victory is all the more to his credit when
It Is considered that this was his first
time out since his inglorious defeat by
Real Article in the big John Grace cup
event in October last. Rector on that
day was a 1 to 7 favorite for the* course
and was heavily backed. He had his re
venge yesterday by beating Real Article
handily !n the third.
In going through the stake Rector made
his trials short and snappy and in the
final he was 1 to (> against Silver Heels.
Though he led in the runup and took the
turn. Rector's backers got quite a little
scare. Silver Heels joined in with a
chance to run up a score. She killed and
ended the course. Score 3 to 2.
Following are the day's results with

big crowd was on hand to root, and
throughout the entire ten Innings there
was hardly a dull moment. The score:

ONE little tally kept Mike Fisher
and his Senatorial gang from go
ing back to third place in the
merry chase after the pennant
yesterday. After ten vicious
rounds full of that real life and ginger
that make the game what it is the Sen
ators speezed Truck Egan through the
lines of the locals' defense, and all was
over. Mike Fisher was saved, and the
finish happened 3 to 2. After ten rounds
of battling on the Oakland diamond In
the morning the game broke up in a tie,
5 to 5.
A gala day throng was on the spot at
Eighth and Harrison streets when Um
pire O'Connell gave the high sign and
ushered in the game. And the crowd was
on its toes from the moment the first
ball was thrown. Such baseball has not
been seen here for ever so many moons,
and It is not likely that the fans will
have a chance of witnessing another per
formance of the kind for many more.
In the ninth round, with the game all
but over and every fanatic In the lot in
a fever of excitement, the home team
landed with a run, which tied the score.
Irwln, the first man up, was given a
chance on Truck Egan's error, the first
the Senators committed. Then Leahy
bunted along the third base line, Sheehan
grappled with the sphere, and in his anx
iety to make a double play threw badly
to second. I^eahy kept on running, but
was tagged out at the middle station
after a close play, Irwln going to third.
Pabst came along and lined the
leather at Egan. He fielded it and
threw it true to the rubber. But the
throw was a second late and Irwln
safely slid in with ' the run that tied,
while the multitude yelled and cheered
like mad. Delmas was the next man up.
He soaked one that was going right over
second, but Casey made a stab for it ana
got it Just in time to save the day for
the Senators.
Ham Iberg became careless for just an
Instant at the opening of the tenth and
he hit McLaughlln in the ribs. ' Egan
forced Mac at second. Then Townsend hit
to Irwln, who fumbled the ball long
enough to allow the runner to reach first.
At the next ball pitched, Egan and
Townsend started to work the double
steal.
Tommy Leahy lined the ball to second,
but the throw was low, Shay picked the
sphere up In a twinkling and shot it to
the plate. Egan was tearing along at
his fastest clip and he beat the ball out
by a foot. This was the last run of the
game, and it saved Mike Fisher from be
ing rudely hurled into third place.
But the locals died game. When their
turn came for hitting in the tenth they
fought every Inch of the way. Herr was
sent In to bat for Iberg and he was
passed. Shay hit to left and the crowd
nearly went wild. Meany forced Herr at
third and thÂ£ next two men failed to
make Rood, s'o It was all over and the
game was Mike's.
Mike would have easily won without
the formality of going through an extra
inning had not Caaey become dopey on
the bases. In the third the bags were
loaded and but one man was out. Casey
was on third, and for just a single in
stant he dreamed, and while he was thus
engaged Leahy whipped, the ball down to
Irwln and caught Casey a yard off the
bag. Then again In the seventh Casey
was nailed in the same way. Each time It
â¢ meant at least a run. The score:

Frank J. Morrissey, accused by the po
lice of this city of a most unique and dar
ing robbery, was arrested by the police of
Stockton yesterday. The capture makes
a story as interesting as that of the
crime Morrissey confesses to having com
mitted and was the result of a series of
events that makes it savor of fate. The
robber had accused another man of theft
and while making the complaint against
him was recognized and taken into cus
tody.
On June 18 Morrissey met Herman Nel
son, a farmhand from Fresno, near the
Cliff Ho'ise and Invited him to take a dip
In the surf. The two men walked about
four miles down the beach, stripped and
waded into the water. After a short
swim both returned to the shore and
while seated in the sand Morrissey struck
his companion on the head with a rock
and attempted to throw him into the
water. â¢
As soon as Nelson lost consciousness
Morrissey took his clothes, a gold watch
and $50 in coin and made his escape. The
robber left his own clothes behind. The
injured man was found by the life-sav
ing crew and was taken with a fractured
skull to the Receiving Hospital. Cir
culars were then issued by the police giv
ing Morrissey's description, but nothing
was heard of him until the news of his
arrest came last night.
Morrissey had been working at the
Smith ranch, a few miles north of L:ock
ton, since he committed the crime. Yes
terday morning a man who had formerly
worked on the ranch and whose place
Morrissey had taken appeared at the
place and demanded his position back. .
When this was denied him he entered
the bunkhouse and stole a number of per.
sonal effects, Morrissey's razor among
them. When the theft was discovered
the ranch hands went to town and re
ported the crime to the police and then
began searching for the thief. In the
meantime Officer Dutschke arrested the
petty larcenlst and went In search of the

SEATTLE. Wash.. July 12.â William
Dawpon, who says his home is in San
Francisco, but can give no further ac
count of himself, was picked up on the
streets at an early hour this morning, ap
parently demented. He was taken to the
City Jail and this afternoon removed to
the County Jail for safe keeping. He is
not at all violent, but his brain seems
muddled. There is no Indication that he
has been drinking.
Dawson is about 30 years old and neatly
dressed. In his pockets he had $180. He
was noticed this morning walking up afcd
down on First avenue with bent head,
covering the same ground time and again.
When finally accosted by the policeman
on the beat he could not even remember
his name. This and the fact that his
home was in San Francisco he appeared
to recall to-day, hut beyond that nothing
can be elicited from him.
The only William Dawson whose name
is in the directory was found last night at
614 Howard street. He had been missing
for about a month, having left his resi
dence in a most mysterious manner. A
fruitless inquiry was made in the city for
him and not until yesterday morning did
he return.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
NEVADA CITY. July 12.â L. I.. Gaff
ney, superintendent of the Downieville
Stage Company, has brought to town a
story of an exciting experience. He
states that while driving toward Nevada
City yesterday with many passengers,
and when between the Mountain House
and Nigger Tent, two large bears sprang
out of the brush just behind the vehicle.
Gaffney's attention was called to the fact
by the cries of the women passengers.
Glancing back the driver saw the cause.
Both bears were in pursuit of the stage
and close behind. The passengers had
no weapons, and as no treasure was be
ing carried Gaffney was not armed. The
only course left was to whip up the
horses and speed from danger. The bears
followed for half a mile and then disap
peared. â
Scarely a day passes when bears are
not seen on the road between here and
Downieville, but this is the first instance
where the animals have become so bold
as to pursue a stage.

named:
venerable pastor of the Church of
Immaculate Conception, celebrated to-day
In honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the
ordination to the priesthood of the kindly
old clergyman, who is beloved by all who
are blessed with his acquaintance, irre
spective of creed or nationality.
Following the celebration of the solemn
high jubilee mass this morning was a
dinner to the visiting church dignitaries,
at which the aged priest was the recipi
ent of a purse of gold, a token from
his brethren in the church. The jubilee
festival was concluded this evening with
a reception to Father King, during which
a large purse of gold was presented to
him, the gift of his parishioners.
Because of his advanced years and for
fear that he was not strong enough to
intone the solemn high mass himself,
Father King delegated the office of cele
brant to the Rev. Father J. M. Gleason,
one of his young assistants. The priests
who assisted the celebrant all had been
at one time or another assistants to
Father King. They were the Rev. Father
Lawrence Serda, deacon; the Rev. Father
J. J. Cranwell, sub-deacon, and the Rev.
Father Thomas McSweeney, masfter of
ceremonies. During the service Father
King worshiped within the sanctuary on
the gospel side, of the altar. He knelt
at the right hand of Archbishop Rlor
dan, at whose left was the Rev.'
Father Kenelm Vaughan, brother to the
late Cardinal Vaughan of England.
Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, vicar-gen
eral of the archdiocease, preached the
sermon, after reading the gospel of the
day, the eighth chapter of St. Mark, be
ginning with the first and ending with
the ninth verse, and which dealt with the
parable of the loaves and the fishes.
At the conclusion of the mass Ills Grace
Archbishop Riordan spoke brieflly, say
ing:
It must be a consolation to Father King to
look back over his fifty years of faithful stew
ardship in the service of the Lord. The priest's
greatest power lies In his fidelity to duty. He
must be rneek and humble like his Savior and
gentle to all. liy no other power could such a
congregation â¢ as this be brought and held to
gether. Father King has been a gentle and
charitable priest. He has carried about with
him the teachings and attributes of his Mas
ter. May his life be spared for many more
years to bMM further promote God's word, and
when his time cornea to receive his reward
may he be given that crown of glory which
his Lord and Master Jesus Christ has promised
to all who serve him.

At the age of 102 years and 5 months,
Miss Lavlna Wheeler passed away this
afternoon at 4 o'clock at her home, 1633
Grove street. Though she had lived in
two centuries and had been a participant
in historical events that have long since
been only of record In . the books. Miss
Wheeler retained possession of her mental
faculties to a marked degree. Last Feb
ruary this notable centenarian celebrated
the one hundred and second anniversary,
of her birth with a reception at the resi
dence of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Osgood
Wheeler, wife of the late Rev. Osgood
Wheeler, a brother of Miss Wheeler. For
several- months the aged woman had been
failing physically.
Miss Wheeler came of a long-lived fam
ily. She was born in Wayne County, N.
Y., February 4, 1S01. She was the third
of twelve children, all of whom lived to
an old age. Mrs. Eunice Crabtree, a sis
ter, of this city. Is the only blood kin in
this State. Their mother lived to the aga
of 93 years, and their father died at 75
years of age. Miss Wheeler in her early
life was a school teacher in her native
State and had many reminiscences of the
early days in the Empire State, where
her life was spent until 1875, when she
came to California with her brother, the
late Rev. Osgood Wheeler, at one time a
prominent Baptist clergyman. For a time
Miss Wheeler resided at Wheatland, com
ing to Oakland in 1881.
Miss Wheeler was a first cousin to John
Gould, the father of Jay Gould, the fam
ous Wall street broker. Before her phys
ical aliments enfeebled the aged woman,
she delighted in recounting stories of the
pioneer days In New York. She had lived
through the administration of every Pres
ident of the United States, except George
Washington. To her the war of 1812 was
a memory of childhood, and she had
grown to a mature age when the Mexi
can war occurred. All of her life Miss
Wheeler was devoted to the cause of re
ligion and she was a devout Christian.
Until "a very few years ago Miss Wheel
er took active interest In church affairs.

scenery, costumes and original novelties.
The attraction to-night at the Central

be the farce comedy. "Muldoon's Picnic,"
In which James Corrigan will conclude his
three weeks' starring engagement. -Con-

bers' powerful play, "A Modern Mag

For a first encore Miss McKinley re
peated "Anona." a story of Arizona love,
that was such a decided success last
week. Then, when the immense throng
of spectators insisted that she, should
sing more, she gave the second verse of
the Indian ditty and retired amid great
applause.
The success of Miss McKinley does not
detract from the remainder of the bill.
On the programme are acts that are of
the artistic order. Manager ' Morrtsey
never secured a better aggregation of
talent. De Kolta is indeed a wizard. Ha
does not work alone on the stage, but
he walks among the spectators and mys
tifies them under their eyes. Hodges and
Launchmere. in comedy song and dance,
furnish the best of amusement. Their
"cat" duet is particularly clever and
something distinctively their owh. Bailey
and Madison are two rollicking: come
dians worth seeing any day.
Julian Rose, "our Hebrew friend," Is
just as popular as when he made his Ini
tial appearance. The beauty of his turn
Is that he changes his Jokes and stories,
and the monotony that accompanies a
great many hold-over acts Is missing.
Charles Dlckson and his company appear
in a pretty comedietta. "Heart to Heart
Talks." and their closing work, accom
panied by a song by Harry Goodwin,
won applause from every part of tho
house. Mosher. Houghton and Mosher
continue as acrobatic and comedy cy
clists, and Frank C. Young and Bessie
de Vole do a dancing turn that Is hard to
excel.
The audience cheered again for Miss
Mabel McKinley at the Orpheum last
night. The late President's niece opened
her second week In vaudeville yesterday,
and if success can be measured by the
welcome San Francisco has given her.
a brilliant future Is hers. She changed
her bill completely. Each number was
encored and the audience, called for
more. In her clear, full soprano voice
she rendered the waltz song from "Ro
meo and Juliet.'* Then she sang Chad
walck's "Danza." A third selection was
a dainty little Japanese love song, and
her exquisite Interpretation showed the
most tasteful cultivation.
under which a Normal School graduate
may enter the university and how much
â¢Â¦redit he will get. * This understanding
was arrived at after a conference be
tween a committee appointed by Presi
dent Wheeler and the presidents of the
Normal Schools. The result of the con
i". rence is embodied In the circular of to.
i:ay under the title of "The Relation of
\he Normal Schools to the University.'"
]? is as follows:
It is desirable that properly prepared gTa<J
Â¦u; 'â¢Â¦* oj high Fchools who fine* completing
their hijjh school course have been under
;.-per instruction for two years 1n one of our
Male normal school* and have received thÂ»
rcrn:al pcl:o':l diploma of graduation should
be ixrmitted to enter the university with
njvcmc c;Â«Jit.
Such credit may be given to tbe specially
re<iÂ«Â»iiinrde<l graduates of any one of the
normal schools in which the instruction
U -f university grade; that is. Instruction (a)
<tirrlrd rn by teachers of university grade <b)
in cU.m-.-b made up entirely of high school
jrraivxtet-. (c) w!th proper scholastic equip
ment
Wr.Â»n all of these conditions have been com
pli -J Witts normal school graduates may be
j<rir.i:u-<i to enter the university with a ir.ax-
ISMta crcJ;t of thirty units.
So long as only one year of university credit
is riven for two years of normal school work,
the normal eohoole shall not be asked to make
any change in their (professional) courses by
way cf adjustment to the (general culture)
course of the university.
In lieu of inspection of normal school* by
university instructors, there shall be such oc
casional or stated conference as may be found
desirable between representatives cf the normal
schools and the university.
The credit granted in any given case shall
r.ot relieve the student of prescription 1n any
ceps.rtment of the university; but any de
partment may at its discretion accept any
trivea portion of the normal school work In
cluded v it!. in the thirty units of advance credit
as satisfying equivalent prescriptions in that
Â£er*rtment.
The university shall not be expected to make
any change in its admission requirements to
BMft the case of graduates of the normal
schools Any part of the university admis
sion requirements which may not have been
satisfactorily covered by a normal school grad
uate seeking advance credit shall be made up
by such Â«tudtnt before the granting of a de
gree. The question of a two-year course In
l^atin tn the normal schools shall bÂ« consid
ered wish reference to Its value as a part of.
the professional training of these schools
To sum It all up, the university will not
accept Normal School graduates unless
their standard in instruction is raised,
ar.d the State Board of Education will not
grant cc-rtlncates unless the university
raises Its standard. In a few words, the
university and the Normal Schools must
improve their courses or the student will
have to go to both if he wants a teacher's
certificate. *
The men responsible for this new set of
rules are President Wheeler and Pro
fessors Irving Stringham, Frederick
Slate, W. A. Merrill, A. F. Lange. K. C.
Baboock and Elmer E. Brown of the unll
varsity, and M. E. Dally of the San Jose,

fo that they now outnumber the univer
sity's representatives. This increase was
brought about by the establishment of
â¢ Normal Schools at Chlco, San Diego and
San Francisco", each of which is repre-
Ftnted on the State board.
The Normal Schools, having a majority
representation, proceeded to even up old
pcores with the university. And so the
first thing the majority did was to pass
a rule that the State board would not isÂ»-
Fue any more teachers* certificates to
graduates of the university unless that
university added a course in practical
pedagogy to its curriculum. The univer
sity has always given its students the
best instruction In the theoretical knowl
edge of teaching, but very little practice.
The Norms! School people had been try
ing for a Ions time to force the univer
sity to put in a practice department, but
its minority was never able to do any
thing more than talk and storm.
Now the university will have to found
a practice department whether It will or
no. The new rule does not go into effect
until the year 1904, a delay which was
made in deference to the wishes of the
university. In the meantime the univer
sity will have to organize a practice de
partment, and it has already begun to
lcok around for a suitable place for it
and the necessary teachers to give in
struction.
The university is not altogether defeat
ed, however, by this latest turn, and it
has come out of the battle with a little
< r*-dit. It has succeeded in reaching a
definite understanding with the Normal
School people as to exactly the conditions
their numbers as representatives on the
Statp Roard of Education have increased.
The annual yuarrel between the Univer
sity of California and the State Normal
School authorities Is over, and out of
the smoke of strife looms another set of
rules designed to govern the education of
those young men and women who have
selected pedagogy for their profession.
These r.ew regulations appeared In clrcu-
But the advent of this circular does not
ten the whole story. The university has
l.ad its Inning for a long time, but now
comes the Normal Schools 1 turn. The
history of teaching in this State in the
higher branches is a history of clashes
between the university and Normal
School authorities. For a long time the
university had the upper hand. It out
numbered the Normal School representa
tion on the State Board of Education and
dictated terms. The university could de
rr.and any standard it wanted and always
pet it, but the Normal Schools were
forced to take what their rival was
j.'.t-ased to give them. All this led to a
friction, and the Normal School people
have not been willing to forget.
The Normal Schools' time to rule the
"oost has come. Within the last year

Shipping Intelligence.
ARRIVED
Several dispatches have been* received
at the Merchants* Exchange during: the
voyage of the ship, stating that her trip
has been anything but pleasant. She had
several breakdowns during her voj*age
and caused her owners and the Ham
mond Lumber Company no end of anxiety
and the news that she has at last been
sighted near home will be kindly received
by all interested in her.
After leaving Newport News nothing
was heard of the ship till May 25. when
she put into the harbor of Rio de Janeiro
disabled. She was repaired there and
started on her journey again. On June
10 she signaled the steamship Punta
Arenas for aid. She then continued her
voyage for a few days more, but on
June 19 was again in distress and called
on the steamship Coronet for assistance.
Since that time nothing had been heard
of the Leggett till she was sighted by the
yacht Lurline.
The Leggett is said to be a very fine
boat and capable of making fast time.
The present voyage is the first long one
undergone by the vessel and it is thought
that perhaps she was not in condition for
the trip. It is said that she has been
chartered by the Hammond Lumber Com
pany and will be used here in the coast
lumber trade.
A dispatch was received in this city
las.t night statins that the steamship
Frances E. Leggett hatl been sighted oft
Carpentaria by the pleasure yacht Lur
line. The steamship appeared to be in
distress and signaled to the Lurline to
report her at the nearest" port, saying
that she was slowly making her way to
her destination.
The Leggett i3 a new steamer, recently'
built at the shipyards at Newport News,
Va, She left there about seventy days
ago and was due in this port two days
ago. She is consigned to the Hammond
Lumber Company and carries a large
cargo of coal. The Leggett is com
manded by Captain Jahnsen. She has
never been to this port.

YOUNG WOMAN WHO LAN
GUISHES IN JAIL ON A
CHARGE OF LARCENY.
â¢|â s^.VELYN ALDRIDGE, the statu-
esque blonde, who is confined in
the City Prison charged with
'Â¦ *w the larceny of numerous skirts
and bolts of material from Wil
liam Baron, the cloakmaker, on' Market
street, spent an unhappy Sabbath behind
the bars. She was held In detinue and
none of her friends were allowed to see
her. In fact, it is not on record that any
of them tried.
The young woman is confident that
Baron will not prosecute her. It is said
that he will be satisfied with the return
of the missing goods.
Miss or Mrs. Aldrldge was a familiar
figure prior to her arrest around the re
sorts where hot birds are accompani
ments to cold bottles. She is variously
known as Evelyn Mason, Evelyn Ald
ridge and Evelyn McGowan, and also as
just plain Evelyn, by which name most
of her male acquaintances, in that spirit
of comradarle that prevails under the
splutter of electric lights, will recall her.
She came to this city from Los'An
geles, where she was a familiar figure
on the streets and where she worked for
a time in one of the large department
stores. Of her history she will say noth
ing definite, but hints at the exalted po
sitions her relations occupy in society
upon their native heath and. the scandal
that the upper circles would be cast Into
if her true identity were . known. â¢ She
admits taking the articles in question,
and says she sent them to a man named
H. Lewis, in Los Angeles.* John Mason
Aldridge, a bartender, who has been con
sorting with the woman, is 'under surveil
lance by the police on suspicion of being
implicated in the disposal of the goods.
The woman promises to have the stolen
articles returned to Baron, and expects
to go free when this is done.

HITS PROMINENT CHINESE
WITH CLUB DURING FEAST
Joe King, Ex-Pugilist and Erstwhile
Watchman, Is Arrested on
Serious Charge.
For assaulting Chin Chung, managei
of the Washingtorf-street Theater, and
one of the representative citizens of the
Chinese quarter, Joe King, erstwhile
watchman and ex-pugilist, was arrested
last evening by Patrolman Schmitt of
Corporal Sylvester's Chinatown squad and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
King, up to a few days ago. was em
ployed in the Chinese theater as a ticket
taker, but was dismissed by Chung, the
manager. Last evening Chung, who is
better known as "Big" Chung, was the
host at a. banquet which he was giving
to sixty of Chinatown's representative
merchants at a restaurant at 710 Jackson
street. Shortly after the company Eat
down to the repast King appeared in the
doorway, and, walking over to Chung,
spoke to him. The nature of the conver
sation is not known, but is understood to
have been in reference to King's dismis
sal. Several of the Chinese, fearing trou
ble, attempted to hustle King out of the
room.
According to the Chinese, he drew his
gun and ordered them back. King then
drew his club and struck his former em
ployer on the head.
A scene of wild excitement ensued and
King ran down the steps, pureued by a
Chinese student. Policeman Schmltt was
attracted by the crowd and placed. King
under arrest. His pursuer informed the
police that King had drawn nis revolver
on him during his flight.
Chung was removed to the Harbor Hos
pital and several stitches were taken in
his scalp. The physicians feared that he
had sustained a fracture of the skull and
held him for observation for . two hours.
He was subsequently removed to his home
and his friends fear he has been seriously
wounded. .
King was formerly a watchman, for the
Six Companies and recently became en
gaged in an altercation with former Cap
tain Yoho of the squad.

ORDAIN YOUNG PRIEST
Detective Wren is hopeful that Zimmer
man's confederate will be captured. He
has obtained a good description of all the
former convhit's associates and among
them is confident he will be able to pick
the second man who took part in the day
light outrage.
A woman who resides in the lower flat
of the house is accustomed to loave there
every afternoon at 1:30 o'clock to go to
her employment. The police regard as a
suspicious circumstance the fact that the
robbery was attempted shortly after this
woman left the house, and believe that
some one who was cognizant of the move
ments of all those living In the house in
formed the marauders of what hour it
would be most safe to attempt their haz
ardous crime. Mrs. Rubenstein was ab
sent from the house when the men en
tered, ostensibly on her way to her sis
ter's residence, but she returned home
without going to the place of her original
destination.
Detective investigation Into the violent
robbery of Mrs. Thomas Hughes at her
residence at 314 Goujjh street Thursday
afternoon by two men has resolved Itself
Into a. belief that Fred Zimmerman, the
former convict now In custody, and some
man whose identity Is unknown com
mitted the crime. The police also believe
that Mrs. RubensteJn. an occupant of the
Fame fiat in which Mrs. Hughes lives,
may have had knowledge of the crime.
She is being watched and may be taken
into custody at any moment.
This theory of the detectives is based
on the fact that they claim to have in
formation that Zimmerman was a regu
lar visitor to the rooms of Mrs. Ruben
pteln and that another man with whom
Zimmerman is acquainted was also in the
habit of calling on her. The calls of these
two men Mrs. Rubenstein explained to
the other occupants of the house by say
ing that one was her divorced husband
and the other his employer.
Yesterday "Mush" Rubenstein, the di
vorced husband of the woman, called at
police headquarters and explained to De
tective Wren that he had not eeen his
former wife for three weeks. He said
he was in the habit of calling uoon her
once every month for the purpose of pay
ing her $10 alimony, which had been
awarded by the court for the support of
the child. He always gave it to her in
person and obtained her receipt for it, but
had no further dealings with her and had
not had since the divorce was granted.
He said he had never been accompanied
on his visits by another man, and his em
ployer did not even know he had been
married. He says he does not know Zim
merman, and the woman's explanation of
the identity of her frequent visitors is ab
solutely false.
After banking the money she had re
ceived from the street car company, Mrs.
Hughes paid a visit to a grocery and
made some purchases. When she returned
home she was met by Mrs. Rubenstein.
who Questioned her as to where she had
been. Mrs. Hughes said she had been
to the grocery and said nothing about
having deposited the money in bank. The
police believe that had she told Mrs. Ru
benstein that the money was out of her
possession the attempt to secure It in
the afternoon would not have taken place.

VOTE ON QUESTION.
Commissioners Voorsanger, Roberts and
Boyle voted to recognize the Aubertlne
County Committee. Commissioners Deasy
and Everett voted to support the Harders-
Berger petition. Facts pertaining to the
controversy were fully set forth m the
opinion of the acting city attorney which
was recently published in The Call. The
decision of the Board of Election Commis
sioners is regarded as a triumph of the
Parry-Schmitz ring and a defeat of the
followers of Michael Casey.
United Republican League Club meet
ings will be held this week as follows:
The Board of Klectlon Commissioners,
at a meeting last Saturday night, recog
nized the Republican County Committee,
Thomas D. Rlordan. chairman, and Clif
ford McClellan, secretary, as the govern
ing body of the Republican party of San
Francisco, and accepted the petition for
a local nominating convention and a place
on the primary election ballot, filed by
said committee. The petition signed by
followers of Martin Kelly's Mutual Alli
ance was rejected. The signers of the Al
liance s ~petition asked for recognition on
the ground that the Republican conven
tion of 1902 refused to reappolnt the old
County Committee and adjourned without
appointing a new governing body.
Commissioners Everett, Boyle, Deasy
and Voorsanger voted to recognize the
Rlordan committee. Commissioner Rob
erts voted against such recognition.
The factional fight in the Union Labor
Party engaged the prolonged attention of
the Board. An opinion of the acting city
attorney holding that the Harders-Berger
faction was the legal governing body of
the Labor Party In San Francisco was set
aside, and the petition of the Ewell-Au
bertlne faction for a place on the ballot
was accepted.

Resolved, That we respectfully suggest to
our brothers, the County Committee ot Sar.

visability of reading Eugene Schmitz out of the

suggest to them to nee to it that all of our

Committee.

future of the party in the State; and
Whereas, Mayor Eugene Schmitz has be
trayed the party which honored him and al
lied himself with so-called ''bofs politicians,"
thereby becoming a part of the political sys
tem which the Union Labor party utterly re
pudiates; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we call upon our brother
workers in San Francisco to be specially act
ive on August 11, ths day of the primaries, in
order that the combination of traitors and ene
mies with which Eugene Schmitz is allied may
have no further Dower for evil in our party
