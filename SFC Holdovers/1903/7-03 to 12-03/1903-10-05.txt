Insurgent chief. General Zontcheff, was

Powers Agree to Leave to Her the

LONDON, Oct. 4.â The Tangier corre

of Morocco has given a second Installment
of J50.0M to the American syndicate which
is undertaking the Moorish exhibit at the
St. Louis Exposition. The correspondent
adds:
"This action on the part of the Sultan
creates much criticism here, as the Moor
ish Government, pleading the existing
crisis, has refused to consider or pay the
claims of the Europeans who have suf
fered loss of property through tho re
bellion.
"I learn that the powers have agreed
to leave the solution of the existing crisis
to France, who will give necessary as
sistance to the Sultan's Government when
their resources shall be finished. There
is no question of a French protectorate,
but France will naturally acquire a pre
ponderating influence in Moorish politics."

CAPTAIN DIES AT HIS POST.
"As the boat sank it was clear that
there was only one chance for any one
being saved, and that was by dinging to
the wreckage. I gave orders for the men
to put the women upon It first. They did
so, and behaved well, every man remain
ing on the sinking boat until the women
had been placed on pieces of the cabin
and other wreckage.
"There was then a wild scramble on the
part of each man to get such planking as
he could secure and cling to. Every man
found something to float on except the
captain, who remained in the pilot-house
to the last, doing his best to right the
boat, and he finally went down with her.
"We floated on different pieces, and for
a few minutes we were in sight of each
other, but soon darkness came on and we
separated. The last person that I saw,
except those with me, were the two Vin
cent girls, from Egg Harbor, who were
floating together. They seemed to have
recovered entirely from their first fright
and were making a brave struggle for
their livesâ a struggle which It now seems
was in vain.
"Those of us who were fortunate
enough to escape clung to the wreckage
all night, bitten by the cold wind and be
numbed by the colder water, and the sur
prise Is that we did not all die of ex
posure. "We drifted, I know not where,
until picked up by the Sheboygan."
"Everyone on board gathered on the
deck, most of them In a state of frantic
panic. The situation was made particu
larly heartrending by the women, who
shouted hysterically, imploring the men
to save them, and accompanied their ap
peals for assistance with prayers.
Dowie says he will not be satisfied after
this with converting large cities like New

they were unable for some time to tell
anything about the wreck.
The waves were rolling high, and sev

selves from immediate death lost strength
and sank. It was several hours, after the
Hackley went down before the Sheboygan

of the floating men attracted the atten

The low prices attracted numerous small
investors, and buying orders from the con
tinent, especially on foreign bonds, helped
to suBtain the market, but confidence Is
not likely to return whilst the consols re
main at such a low figure. The news that
E. H. Harriman.has joined the board of
Erie Railroad brought steadiness to the
American list, which mainly followed the
movements of Wall street.
LONDON, Oct. 4. â The stock market
closed steadier yesterday, after one of tho
most disturbed weeks experienced since
the Baring crisis, and all the departments
showed a shade of improvement on the
prices of the previous Saturday. Little
confidence, however, is yet felt in the sta
bility of the market. The settlement pass
ed without trouble, but -it is known that
four meetings of creditors were held
Tuesday, and operators remained sensi
tive. :

LONDON STOCK MAKKBT
IS BECOMING STEADIES
"The three men who were washed over
board were never seen afterwards. They
disappeared In the sea that broke over us,
and it is a wonder that all of us were not
carried away. We must have been going
twelve knots an hour, and with the wind
and sea we could neither hear nor see a
thing of the others.
"At daylight we began pouring oil on
the water, and that seemed to do somo
good. We used about four barrels of oil,
and though the sea was so heavy as to be
continually breaking over us, the oil seem
ed to helD a good deal.
"The gale drove us right down the coast,
and we were almost abreast of San Diego
before getting out of the storm. Then we
were so crippled that things looked pretty
bad. About two days afterwards I got up
steam and sent up new sails to take .the
place of the ones carried away. A main
sail,-fore mlzzen topgallant sail, maintop
staysail were carried away, starting the
cap on the fore topmast. The gale bent
the supporters and outriggers and carried
away the bolts, and also the main gallant
stay. A boat which was lashed on the
top of the main hatch was smashed to
pieces, the hatch bars broken and the tar
paulin washed away. The water was on
the deck only, and very little got below."
HONOLULU, Sept. 26.â The ship Marian
Chllcott, whlcji arrived here September 24,
after having lost three men overboard in
a gale off the coast qf California on the
morning of September 11, Is rather badly
battered. Captain Williams tells the story
of the troubles of the Chilcott as follows:
"We left San Francisco on September 10
at 10 o'clock at night, and before we had
hardly gotten past the lighthouse we ran
right into a gale. We had laid around the
lightship from 10 In the night until 2
o'clock the next morning. There wasn't a
breath of wind, when suddenly we ran
Into the gale. It was a" clear night, al
though not moonlight. -A heavy sea was
running and we were shipping water right
along on the decks. I kept the ship before
the wind and we ran dead before the gale.
"We were hauling on the braces, and I
was at work with the men when I saw the
sea coming. I yelled 'Look out!' but none
of us was prepared for the sea that swept
over us. We were hauling on the port
forebrace, and three of my men were
washed overboard and lost. Two men
and the mate were also washed overboard,
but they hung onto the braces, while I
kept hold of the sheets. One of the men
must have been .hanging on over the side
fully four or five minutes before he was
rescued. The man at the wheel said he
thought that there must have been two
heavy seas breaking over us in quick suc
cession. The sea began to break just ft
the fore mlzzen rigging and then swept
all over us.
Stecial Correspondence- of ThÂ« Call.
Men on all sides were clamoring for
recognition, but failed to get it for no or
ganization existed. This fact was finally
forced upon the main body in the hall
and their leaders began to exert their in
fluence to quiet their followers. It was a
difficult task, but eventually was accom
plished and D. Rass nominated for, the
chair, which he quickly took and 'pro
ceeded to ring a bell for order. Then Al
bers Bosquet, former superintendent of
the hospital, who was recently accused of
indiscriminately kissing nurses of the In
stitution and. who was among the first to
pain the platform and direct matters in
the Interest of the. opposition, which had
called the meeting, was chosen temporary
eecretary and with these formalities ef-
. Hissing, hooting, yelling, cheering, the
stamping of feet and the crashing of
chairs, as the men clambered to their feet,
combined to create a din that could be
heard for & block around Native Sons'
Hall, and It lasted for several minutes,
until several leaden of the opposition suc
ceeded In crowding through the uproar
bus mass of humanity and gained the
stage, where they yelled for attention.
When It was finally given them they loud
ly protested against the doture that had
been enforced by the retiring chairman.
WILD TURMOIL FOLLOWS.
In exactly seven minutes after Bergerot
had taken his seat in the assembly on the
floor the hall was in the midst of a. wild
1-trmoiL Vice President Bozio wasted no
time in presenting briefly to the meeting
the purpose of Its call, and then proceeded
*o read the report of the administrative
committee upon the recent changes that
had taken place at the French Hospital.
Jt was explained that the removal of Dr.
Canac-M&rquis had been made in the best
Interests of the French society, and in
Response to another question regarding
the raising of salaries of employes of the
Jiospital, which has also been - agitating
certain members. It was stated that this
matter would be fully explained in the
next annual report of the committee.
Without the slightest warning that the
report was concluded, the speaker sud
denly lifted his eyes from the paper, and
glancing quietly at his auditors remarked:
. "Messieurs, there being nothing further
before this meeting, it stands adjourned."
and before the crowd of excited French
men In the body of the hall fully appre
ciated tho situation the members of the
fcommlttee had left the rostrum and were
filing ont of the building. Just as Vice
President Bozio and his fellow committee
men reached the main exit there was a
terrific roar of voices.
The noisy hum that resounded through
out the hal> plainly suggested to those on
the stage that harmony would not long
assert itself in that assemblage, and that
they were not amiss in their calculations
was shortly demonstrated. President
Bayle, in calling the meeting to order,
asked to be excused from presiding on the
ground that he was suffering from a
throat affliction, and he gracefully gave
way to Vice President Bozio.
As a prelude to the disturbing scenes,
Alexandra Bergerot mounted the rostrum
Sot the purpose of delivering a eulogy i of
n departed member, and he took occasion
during his eloquent remarks to refer to
the peaceful gathering, which brought a
*mile to the faces of many of those pres
ent who were within the range of the
epeaker's voice.
BOZIO'S TACTFUL MOVE.
Then the trouble began. A large faction
of the society, which was kindly disposed
toward the deposed surgeon, accepted a
prerogative granted it under the by
laws of the society and Immediately de
manded an explanation from the commit
tee of administration. This demand was
signed by more than seven hundred mem
bers of the organization, the majority of
whom crowded the hall yesterday when
the meeting was called to order to listen
to the report of the administrative com
mittee. Seated on the platform with Pres
ident Bayle were the members of the com
mittee, with four exceptions, the absentees
being Messager, Theile, Bellegard and
Rancovieri.
MINORITY TO THE FOEE.
Some weeks ago friction, which had ex
isted for months at the hospital between
Chief Surgeon Canac-Marquis and the
matron of the institution, Miss Keelee,
ended In counter-charges being made by
each of tho parties mentioned, and finally
the trouble vu carried to the administra
tive committee, which is composed of
Messrs. Bayle, Bozlo, Bergerot, Lacoste,
Messager. Thlele, Caraes, Ponchan, Ron
oovieTi, Lacaze, Pon, Gardet, Bellegard,
Godeau and Gless. This committee after
careful deliberation over the matters ar
rived at the conclusion, by a vote of 11 to
2. that the resignation of Dr. Canac-Mar-
MUis would bÂ« to the best interests of the
institution, and so notified that gentleman
by telephone.
But the doctor had already formed his
own views in the matter and responded
over the wire that if the committee stood
31 to 2 against him he could see no reason
why his resignation should be requested,
for it was apparent to him that if the
committee wanted to make a vacancy all
It had to do was to declare one, and
Feexnlngly following his suggestion It
promptly did so, naming as his successor
Dr. B. F. Alden.
The resular annual volcanlc-llke erup
tion la the French Benevolent Society
occurred yesterday when that- organiza
tion met in Native Sons' Hall for the pur
pose of pacifying, the turbulent faction
that has been for some time attempting
to repudiate the recent actions of the con
stituted administrative committee, that
saw fit to remove Dr. Canac-Marquts
from the position of chief surgeon of the
local hospital.
Within ten minutes after the meeting
was formally called to order at 3 o'clock
the 1_I1 was in an uproar and the din
continued for nearly two hours, during
which much brilliant oratory was waited
in an attempt to straighten out matters
and bring the members of the society
back to a normal state, which seemingly
they are not destined to enjoy for any
great length of time.
What happened yesterday has happened
before, and when it was all over the mem
bers of the society retired from the place
of meeting with that air of satisfaction
that comes from having effected a pur
pose. And they had. One faction had
succeeded in proving to its own satisfac
tion that it was not popular with another
party of the organization, and the latter
body had enjoyed the privilege' of demon
strating to the regular officials of the so
ciety that by-laws sometimes work two
ways and that minorities may, if they
choose, create a mighty turmoil and keep
the storm raging so long as their tspeech
makers are able to engage in the task.
THVTIH. TROUBLES BEGIN.
Taken all in all,- the Home Rule ticket
Is far from being a strong, one, and the
Republicans should be able to elect the
first county officers in the Territory of
Hawaii by Bteady work during the next
six weeks.
HONOLULU, Sept. 26.â The second polit
ical convention for nominating candidates
for county of dees, has J\i8t_be_n_concluded.
It was held by the Home Rule party,
whose leaders" in" the Legislature recently
expressed their antagonism to American^
ism and; to any -attempt to 'promote an
Increase in the population' here by the In
flux of settlers from the mainland.
This anti-American Home Rule party
has nominated twelve Hawailans for the
county offices, their leader being Former
Delegate to Congress R. W. "Wiloox. who
runs for the office of Sheriff. Two rene
gades, who deserted the Republican
party because they failed to get nomina
tions, were welcomed with open arms by
the Home Rulersâ James H. Boyd, former
Superintendent of , Public Works,' being
nominated for Supervisor, and Curtis P.
Iaukea for Assessor- and. Tax Collector.
Among the other nominees is C. W. Booth,
who tried to sell some property, .valued at
$10,000 for assessment, for water works
purposes to the Government for $250,000,
his chief supporters in the deal being
Home Rule members of the Legislature.
Princess Theresa, wife of Robert "Wll
cox, the Home Rule leader, has bolted the
ticket, being dissatisfied with some of the
nominations.. The Princess runs a weekly
paper called "The County," that supports
tho Home Rule party, and the lady edi
tor's utterances in the next issue should
be interesting if expressed as warmly and
Etrongly as her views were at the close
of the convention.

" SUISUN, Oct. 4.â Last Wednesday
Deputy Sheriff Martin of Cordelia brought
to the county hospital a man wh'o had
been _ found lying unconscious beside the
road near the Thomasson rock crusher.
Tuesday evening the man, rode from Sul
sun to Cordelia with William McCarron,
a teamster. On Wednesday McCarron
found the man , Hear where" he had' left
him the day before. He was in a helpless
condition and had evidently lain out of
doors all night. ' â¢
.The man, died in the hospital Thursday
evening, and since" his death It has been
discovered that he 'was ) well to do. On
his body was found" a "purse containing
about , 550 : and two. passbooks, one show
ing deposits in the Hibernla Bank of San
Francisco to -the credit of Nicholas Cain
to the amount of $400 and the other issued
by the People's Savings Bank of Seattle,
where he had a credit of more than $2000.
The man's Identity is unknown here. An
autopsy disclosed that death was dua^to
pleural pneumonia.
Notwithstanding this fact the men were
placed on board the Sierra on April 7 and
transferred by the military authorities to
San Francisco. "When the cases were called
at the May term Judge Robinson and At
torney General Andrews both wrote to the
War -Department at Washington. Later
a letter from the War Department stated
that the case had been referred to the
department of California, and General
McArthur also wrote expressing his re
grets and asking that the civil authorities
here drop the cases as an act of courtesy
to the War Department. All the corre
spondence is to be produced in court on
Monday. ;"V:;

for burglary, has not ended. The affair
has; occasioned: some very bitter corre

be brought back from' Calif ornia,, where
they have been transferred, and ' Judge

These, soldiers broke Into the mountain
home of i Chief Justice Frear in- the early

men who were then In Oahu Jail, together
with Captain Pierce of the United States
army, called at the office of the Attorney
General and represented that the military
authorities were very anxious to obtain
control of the men pending the civil trial,
so as to inflict military punishment upon
them and pledging their word that the
men would be held subject to the order of
the civil authorities until their cases were
finally disposed of. Relying upon these
assurances the Attorney General made a
motion before Judge DeBolt that the de
fendants be released upon their own rec
ognizance, stating In open court that the
military authorities would be responsible
for the. appearance of the men when they
weTS wanted. The court granted the re
quest and the -prisoners were turned over
to Captain Pierce. Later Major John Mc-
Clellan asked that the civil authorities

could be se^nt out of the Territory. This
request was. denied by Attorney General

REDDING, Oct. -4.â A six-year-old In
dian boy, Â» whose iname has not ' been
learned here, met an awful death last
Thursday at Amadee, Lassen County.
The little fellow was playing with a white
boy of his own age about a hot water
spring, when he slipped and fell into the
boiling water. He managed to scramble
out, and assisted by his playmate suc
ceeded after repeated delays, occasioned
by the' terrible agony of the burns.^in
reaching a nearby hotel. All possible was
done for the boy, but death soon relieved
his sufferings.

D. S. Richardson, superintendent of the
San Francisco postofnee, whose name has
been made prominent in connection with
the indictment of ex-Superintendent of
Special Delivery System James W. Er
win, returned to his home }n Oakland;
accompanied by his wife, last night. He
refused absolutely to discuss In any man
ner the recent scandal in the San Fran
cisco postofnee or to attempt a vindica
tion of the Â¦ Imputation commonly made
that his own name is deeply involved in
the affair. He claimed to be under orders
from Washington prohibiting him from
talking. ' . ;
After the indictment of Erwin it de
veloped that it was upon the testimony
given by Richardson before the Federal
Grand Jury of the District of Columbia
that the . charge'N was founded. He is
president of the Postal Device and Im
provement Company, which, it was
claimed, had been defrauding the Gov
ernment by charging, exorbitant prices
upon contracts secured through alleged
conspiracies.
.; Richardson had been introduced to the
postal authorities by Erwin when he first
attempted to float the scheme of the
patent, mail boxes and .upon his testimony
in this respect Erwin was indicted. ,
Despite the fact that for. three weeks
after, the indictment of Erwin was made
public, Richardson could not be located,
either In Washington or at any point
west, he now,! strongly asserts that he was
not in hiding, but merely visiting relatives
of his wife's In Wisconsin.' It Is presumed
that he will pass all the responsibility for
the indictment of Erwin up. to admissions
made^by Erwin to the special. officers who
were investigating the local postofflce in
the spring.
BALTIMORE. Oct. 4.â Special services
were held in the Baltimore cathedral to
day in honor of the election of Pius X.
Cardinal Gibbons preached the sermon at
high mass. In the course of the sermon
Cardinal Gibbons said:
The conclave which- has Just taken place
marks a new and Important era in the annals
of the American Catholic church. This is the
first time in the history of the Christian rell-
Cion that the United States or any part of this
Western hemisphere was ever associated with
the other nations of Christendom in selecting
a successor to the chair of Peter. I would not
be at all surprised if in the next conclave the
Catholic church of 'the United States will be
represented by several members of the Sacred
College, so that the number of Cardinals from
our country may be commensurate with the
population, the grandeur and the commanding;
influence of the nation, and may be in keeping
also with the numerical strength of our hier
archy and laity and the splendor and progress
of our religious and charitable Institutions.
Two ballots were cast each day in the con
clave, one In the forenoon and another m tne
afternoon. The votes for Cardinal Sarto stead
ily increased from the first to the seventh bal
lot on which he was elected. %\*hen the Car
dinal observed that the suffrag^- for him
were augmenting he was visibly . disturbed,
and In a. fervent speech he implored his col
leagues not to regard him as a candidate.
Contrary to his wishes the votes for him In
creased. He then became -alarmed, and In a
second speech, in most pathetic language, he
again besought the Cardinals to forget his
name, as he could not accept a burden too
heavy for him to bear. All were moved by
the modesty and transparent sincerity of the
man. "When he resumed his seat his cheeks
were suffused with blushes, tears were gush-
Ing from his eyes and hi* body trembled with
emotion. It was only after some of 'the lead-
Ing; Cardinals entreated him to withdraw his
opposition that he finally and reluctantly: con-
Bented to abide by the will of God and ac
cept the sacrifice. Â¦Â¦-Â¦.-Â¦
Never did a prisoner make greater efforts
to escape from his confinement than did Car
dinal Sarto to escape from the yoke - of the
Papacy. With his divine master he exclaimed:
"Father, if It be possible let this chalice pasa
from me. Nevertheless, not my ' will, but
thine, be done.'.' .
When his election was officially . announced
his florid countenance assumed . a Â¦ deathly : pal
lor and restoratives were applied to save him
from fainting. ' . "Â¦Â¦'.:'-

the celebration held by the San Francisco

WINNIPEG, Man., Oct. 4.â It Is now
certain that Missionary McLaughlin of
the Methodist Church, who left Huron
River on September 7 with six Indian chil
dren, perished # with the entire party. To
day word reached Selkirk that two bodies,
one of an elderly Indian and another of
an Indian boy, were found in Lake Win
nipeg, near Big Island, at a point where
McLaughlin and party were supposed to
be when the big storm occurred. It is
supposed that the older Indian had been
engaged by McLaughlin to assist in navi
gating the sailboat in which they were
coming up the lake. Rev. John Simmons,
in charge of the Northern Missions for
the Methodist Church, is now on the lake
with a tug endeavoring to locate the body,
of McLaughlin or to discover traces of his
whereabouts.

Then comes the remarkable feature of
the story, for the old soldier took a course
that merits him a monument for unheard
of charity. HJs boarder, the wife's para
mour, sat on the front porch with his
feet cocked on the railing, smoking a
cigar, and coolly gave orders while Tib
betts packed the woman's belongings, the
tears rollinz from his eyes.
Then he went to the bank and drew
$1500, all he had, and gave it to his wife.
More than that, he tlessed her and told
her he would be waiting for her whenever
she would come back. She never came

the corpse stating that while Tlbbetta

At the time of the robbery he reported
the v.hole casjf to the police. After a long
pf-arch a woman answering Nelson's de
scription was found and arrested. In con
.Flderatlon of the woman's youth and of
the fact that she has a young child the
police do not contemplate taking action
egalnst her. In the expeditions of her
husband Fhe apparently took thÂ£ part of
lookout cniy, although when arrested her
hair was found to have been recently cut
short so as to fit under a derby hat, and
this led to the* belief that she had mas
queraded in men's clothes.
Martin Nelson after being held up was
proceeding to the police station when he
met a young woman, and anxious to pre
vent her from falling into tha hands of
the highwayman told her he had just
been robbed.
"Could you Identify the man that did
it?" was the unexpected reply, that
aroused Nelson's suspicions. By talking
unconcernedly to the v.-oman he managed
to lead her to an arc light, where he
Ftudled her features. He was thus en
abled to identify both man and wife yes

â¢i wi.Â»h people to recall that one week ago
Mr. Cutting said publicly the same thing; that
is, that he could see no reason why such an
Indorsement, made without conditions, should
not be accepted. I suppose I may not com
plain if during the past week Mr. Low and
Mr. Cutting, under the impulse of Mr. Platt.
Mr. Woodruff and Mr. Bruce, have revised their
opinions. Last Monday I told Mr. Low that
the only alternative fairly left me waÂ» either
to accept all nominations and indorsements or
else decline all, including the fusion. He then
refused to listen to such a declination, and it
wan at his suggestion that the formal notifica
tions proceeded that day. If he were ever to
have taken the position he now takes it would
have been fairer to have taken It a week ago.
The Mayor concedes, thererore, that he >ild
not protest when I mentioned to him thÂ» prop
osition that the acceptance of Democratic in
dorsement would aid him because It would be
a helpful indorsement of the fusion adminis
tration. I feel sure that, when he recalls the
conversation I now bring to his attention, he
will admit that he then thought that such an
Indorsement would be a distinct tactical ad
vantage to him in the campaign. By the ac
tion of the Democratic convention Mr. Low
has gained that tactical advantage. He has
gained all that hÂ« can gain by that, whether
Sir. Fornes and I are retained on the fusion
ticket or not. Having won the advantage,
which he Is quite willing should be won for
him, it seems he is now willing, at a demand
Inspired by T. C. Platt and his associates, to
have Mr. Fornes and myself cast from his
ticket.
I think that Mr. Low will recall another
conversation with me about two weeks ago. I
told him that the talk of an indorsement by
Tammany seemed to be coming: from various
directions; that I had deemed It an impossi
bility, but that now it began to seem possible,
though I could sot yet think it probable. I
said I could receive it only If made uncondi
tionally and that I would not permit. It to
silence me In the campaign; that under these
conditions It seemed to me that it would be a
tower of strength to Mr. Low and that I might
properly accept. Mr. Low distinctly assented
to this view.

said, he did not regard seriously. Grout

PERSONAL MENTION.
A new naval base and dockyard Is likely
to be established at Berehaven, Bantry
Bay, in the south of Ireland. The choice
was between Berehaven and Cork har
bor, but the former possesses many nat
ural strategic advantages over Cork.
A powerful base on- the south
west coast of Ireland would con
trol and protect â¢ St. George's Chan
nel and the Irish Sea. Bantry Bay
is an ideal locality for a dockyard with
a great expanse and depth of waterway.
It Is now rather isolated, but there will
be no difficulty in placing it in communi
cation with Cork by means of a railway.
Incidentally the building up of a naval
establishment would be of great benefit
to the population of that section In that
It would give employment to thousands
of mechanics and laborers. It is also con
fidently, expected that In the unexplored
mountainous districts Iron ore and coal
might be found and thus add to the com
mercial industries of the, country.'

Concerning results of gun practice in
the United States navy, some of the high
officials in Washington and commanders
of fleets are disinclined to let the public
know anything, while the Secretary be
lieves in publicity. In England the of
ficers favor non-secrecy and the Admir
alty wants results to be kept secret. The
public has a right to know the state of
efficiency of the navy, and official reports
are better than incomplete and mislead
ing accounts from irresponsible sources.
It is impossible to keep such matters se
cret. Every man on board the several
ships knows the facts and it soon becomes
common talk how one particular ship
excelled another In gun practice. Rear
Admiral Evans does not appear to be
averse to publicity and his report on the
firing practice of the American ships on
the Chira station is satisfactory, as it
indicates a better general average of ef
ficiency than that of the British squad
ron. The Oregon's 13-inch guns scored
68 per cent of hits and 55 per cent hit*
per minute; the Wisconsin made 75 per
cent hits and the Kentucky made nearly
as good a showing. With the 8-lnch
guns the Oregon made 63 per cent hits
per minute and 67 per cent of the shots
were hits. ' With her 6-inch guns the Wis
consin scored 60 per cent hits, which is
considerably lower than that of the Brit
ish squadron.
First â Should the bonds be based upon the plant
alone, as is the case with all enterprises that are con
ducted by private capital, or should the bonds be
based upon the entire city for a local improvement
not strictly within the purposes of municipal govern-
Second â Can the city construct and operate this
road without imposing an additional taxation upon
the whole body of. taxpayers?
Third â Should the city undertake this additional
labor in view oLall its present duties?
We have shown by conclusive reasoning in discuss
ing the first proposition that as the city, in conduct
ing a railroad, is conducting a business and not a gov
ernmental enterprise, it should conduct it on business
principles only, and therefore all bonds issued in or
der to construct this road should be based upon the
road alone and not upon the entire property of the
city.
This argument has not been answered by the ad
vocates of municipal ownership.
We have shown from the figiftes of the City En
gineer that the road will cost the city $20,550 a year
in excess of its income to operate it, and that in addi
tion to these figures the city will have to pay dam
ages for the injuries inflicted by the carelessness and
negligence of its employes and will also have to pay
for keeping in repair that portion of the street which
is always kept in repair by the pwners of street rail
roads. These last two items will more than offset
any decrease in the annual payment of interest. The
only answer made to this statement is that the fig
ures of the City Engineer are wrong; that he has esti
mated the earnings too low and the expense too high
and that his figures should be amended. But the
charter provides that the Board of Supervisors in
taking proceedings to acquire public utilities must
rely upon the estimates furnished by the City En
gineer.
The claim is made by the advocates of municipal
ownership that there should be eliminated from his
estimates the item of $17,750 provided for a sinking
fund required by law to be paid on the bonds. This
item cannot be omitted because the charter provides
that at the time of levying the municipal tax the
Supervisors shall levy and collect annually a tax suf
ficient to pay the annual interest on such bonds and
also the proper aliquot part of the aggregate amount
of such indebtedness so incurred and that such tax
6hall be in addition to all other taxes levied for
municipal purposes.
Under this provision the amount required to raise
the sinking fund and interest must be raised by taxa
tion every year whether the road is leased or sold or
operated by the city. The bonds will remain the lia
bility of the city and the law requires that the princi
pal and interest shall be raised in the above men
tioned way.
We have also shown that the city cannot under the
charter sell this, franchise in order to relieve itself
THE argument for and against the acquisition by
the city of the street railroad on Geary street
and the issue of bonds to the amount of $710,000
for that purpose has resolved itself down to the fol
lowing issues: t
THE London Chronicle ot September
11 publishes an elaborate and inter
esting table of prize firing of the
twenty-three ships comprising the Brit
ish China squadron in 1902, of which the
following condensation gives the aggre
gate results:
mander Fletcher recommend an appro
priation of $3,464,358 towards expansion
and improvement of present facilities or a
recourse to contracts with private firms.
The gist of the report Is that the 12-inch
and 10-inch guns may be completed in
time, but those of 8-inch and smaller cali
ber will be delayed for about eight years
beyond 1907. There are ten battleships,
eight armored cruisers and three protected
cruisers under construction which wera
authorized between March 3, 1S99, and last
March. The delivery of these ships is due
tetween February. 1904. and March, 1907,
and they will require 430 guns of the fol
lowing calibers: Forty 12-inch, 8 10-inch,
104 8-lnch. 60 7-inch and 21S 6-inch. These
constitute the main batteries for the
twenty-one ships referred to, and in addi
tion twelve 4-inch for two gunboats and
3S6 3-inch are needed for the new ships.
The small caliber guns need not neces
sarily be made at the Washington gun
foundry, and the remainder could have
been manufactured at the Government
shops in due time for delivery if there had
not been Unnecessary delay In placing
contracts for forcings.
The gun foundry at the Washington
navy yard Is reported to be unable to fur
nish the ordnance required for the ships
under construction, and that the ships
launched during the next four years will
be without the complement of guns for
several months. \ A board of naval offi

Considerable work is being done in the
French navy in modernizing the coast
defence ships. The Indomptable, Caiman.
Beguin and Terrible built between 1881
and 1SS5, have had all their woodwork
removed where practicable and steel or
linoleum substituted: the heavy guns 'of
1875 models removed for new, lighter and
equally powerful ordnance, and the com
pound engines have been replaced with
triple-expansion machinery. A* a result
the horsepower has been increased from
GOOO to 7000, giving the ships a speed of
over fifteen knots, against the former thir
teen knots, and increased the cruising
radius by 1200 to 1700 miles, according to
the character of the ships, which range
from 7000 to 7575 tons.
M. Camilla Pelletan, the French Minis
ter of Marine, Is untiring In his efforts to
effect changes In the navy. His idea is
to simplify the former complex system
afloat and ashore, with a View of locating
responsibility. He Is, of course, popular
with the crew, younger officers and
workmen in the dockyards, while the high
rank officers and bureau officials enter
tain different feelings towards this man
who is wiping out all the old fogy tradi
tions of the navy. He has done much to
elevate, the personnel as a whole In de
stroying the superiority idea of caste, so
dear to the line officers of the old school,
and all branches of the service are now
open to meritorious persons, regardless of
birth and previous conditions. As an In
dication of M. Pelletan's minute scrutiny
of details, he has even gone so far as to
modify the manner of concluding official
reports by eliminating "I have the honor
to be" and substituting "Respectfully."
The French armored cruiser Jules Fer
ry, 12,550 tons and 26,000 horsepower, was
launched at Cherbourg last month in an
advanced state of completion. Her armor
below the water line was in place, as well
as electric motors, condensers, propeller
shafts and the four funnels. /
This ship made quite a stir in naval cir
cles twenty years ago. embodying as it
did several novel features, chief of which
being her turrets placed en echelon: that
is to say, not as now on a line with the
keel, but toward each side of the vessel.
The armor ranged from 24 inches to 13
inches on the side, and the turrets were
16 inches in thickness. The vessel was
of 11,400 tons displacement with engines
of 8000 horsepower, giving a speed of
about 14 knots. The Inflexible was laid
down at Portsmouth in February, 1874,
and launched in April, 1876, but was not
completed until 1879. Her cost was 14,757,
030, and the repairs up to date of retire
ment amounted to $702,170. The only war
service this ship ever rendered was at
the bombardment of Alexandria, In 1SS2,
where her four 80-ton muzzle-loading
rifles fired 1700-pound shells with great
effect against the fortifications. There
has been a wonderful change since the
Inflexible was launched- Ships of her
class have increased 50 per cent in Blze;
the engine power has been more than
doubled, and the speed raised from 14 to 19
knots. The thickness and weight of the In
flexlble's compound armor would, if made
of Krupp steel, would be impenetrable by
any ordnance built to date. The 80-ton
muzzle-loading rifle had a penetration of 21
inches of iron at 2000 yards, while the lat
est 12-inch gun, weighing 50 tons, , will
pierce nearly 32 inches of iron with a pro
jectile weighing only 850 pounds, at a
range of 2000 yards.

The situation presents few features out of the ordi
nary run. The crop prospects are now pretty well de
termined and it is seen that the country will have
an exportable surplus of everything, though with the ;
exception of corn the yield of farm produce will not
be heavy. The wheat crop is variously estimated at
from 620,000,000 to 070.000,000 bushels and the corn
crop is figured down by all interests to about 2,000,
000,000 bushels. These figures insure a good business
for the railroads during the fall and promise a fair
movement of merchandise and easy collections in the
great wheat and corn belts. It is these conditions
which cause the best reports to come from the west
ern half of the country, as mentioned above. The
Atlantic coast is making a less satisfactory exhibit
owing to the decreased activity in iron and steel and
the continual labor troubles, which render business
conditions far from stable in that region.
The Eastern situation, too, is more or less affected
by conditions in Wall street. The influence of this
hive of speculation on general trade may not be im
mediate or direct, but it reaches its logical destination
sooner or later. Business men all over the eastern
half of the country consider that Wall street keeps
thoroughly posted on the trade conditions of the land
and that stocks go up or down according as trade and
money prospects fluctuate. Hence any protracted
rise or fall in the New York stock market is bound
to affect g'eneral trade sooner or later. Therefore it
is not surprising that after the severe scourging and
pruning that the New York stock market has re
ceived during the past six or eight months commer
cial reports from the Atlantic seaboard should be less
optimistic than those from the West, where the in
fluence of Wall street is not as marked. In fact there
is a spirit of pessimism, with Wall street as source
and distributing center, all over the Atlantic coast.
The bankers do not share this pessimism and are
actively endeavoring to convince the public of the
needlessness of yielding to it, but their efforts are not
oversuccessful. One financial report hits the nail
squared in saying that "there is no ground what
ever for the pessimistic sentiment which pervades
the stock market like some infectious disease." The
best posted authorities arc persistently calling atten
tion to the fact that the standard railroad and indus
trial stocks are now and have been for some time
down to the level of good investment from a divi
dend-paving standpoint, and many of them are below
it, and that consequently now is a good time to buy,
but the public is evidently not taking the hint very
There is not much new in the staples. It is ex
pected that a reduction of about 20 per cent in the
output of pig iron will shortly be arranged in view of
the lessened demand and a growing tendency toward
an accumulation of stock. Heavy receipts of cattle
at Western points are causing some depression in
hides. Wool is well held, though buying is confined
to immediate requirements. Lumber Continues to
quiet down, with weak quotations for some descrip
tions in the West. Building operations, however, arc
still active except at some large Eastern centers.
The wholesale and jobbing trade continues good,
many large Eastern cities reporting the movement
better than at this time last year. The bank clear
ings, however, indicate rather the reverse, as they
show a decrease of 24.5 per cent from the correspond
ing week in 1902. The railroad earnings continue to
lead last year by a fair percentage, but the loud com
plaints of car shortage which characterized last year
are no longer heard except in a few sections and then
only occasionally. About the best feature of the week
was the report of improved collections throughout the
West and Northwest, due to the beginning of the crop
movement to market. In this connection it is inter
esting to note that the apprehensions of a scarcity of
money wherewith to move the crops, so freely ex
pressed last spring and summer, and which for
months hung like a cloud over the money market,
have not thus far been realized.
TRADE conditions mentioned a week ago still
continue and the commercial reports from the
different sections of the country are irregular
and diverse. The best reports are coming from the
western half of the country, but this has been the case
for a yrar or more.
BUSINESS CONDITIONS STILL
SATISFAC1OKY.
WITH three parties in the field the municipal
campaign has outwardly a close resemblance
to that of two years ago, when through de
fections from the ranks of both the Republican and
Democratic parties the Labor Union candidate for
Mayor was elected. The seeming resemblance of the
two contests is, however, deceptive and vanishes when
the essential elements of the two situations are care
fully noted. Two years ago the Republican party
was torn by dissensions, the Democratic party was
demoralized almost to the point of complete disor
ganization, while the Labor party, untried by experi
ence and animated by hope, attracted to its candidate
not only the full labor vote,'* but the whole discon
tented vote of the city.
. Very different is the situation to-day. The posses
sion of power has split the Labor party into factions
fighting over the spoils of office,- Democracy has made
a strong effort to pull itself together, while the Re
publican party, profiting by the experience of the past,
ridding itself of bosses and of factions and reviving
the spirit of harmony, enters the campaign more
thoroughly organized and better led than has been the
case for many a year. In the campaign of two years
ago the party of unity and vigor won and Schmitz
was elected. If history repeat itself and unity and
vigor once more triumph over dissension and indif
ference, the next Mayor of San Francisco will be
Henry J. Crocker..
When studied dispassionately it will be. seen that
Mr. Lane's chances are not much better than were
those of Mr. Tobin last year and that the real crux of
the campaign lies in the contest between Mayor
Schmitz and Mr. Crocker. When the somewhat
similar situation presented itself two years ago there
was a large discontented element among the people,
and that element almost to a man voted for Schmitz.
This year there is but little discontent. On the con
trary the sense of satisfaction among the people over
the prevailing prosperity is so great that there has
just been an overwhelming vote in favor of bonding
the city for many millions and largely increasing the
burden of taxation for the purpose of effecting ex
tensive municipal improvements. As the discontented
vote went to the extreme radical party of the cam
paign it is reasonable to suppose that the contented
vote of this year will go to the party of business and
prosperity and swell the majority to be given to Mr.
Crocker and his colleagues on the Republican ticket.
From whatever standpoint the situation be studied it
will be seen that Mr. Lane is not at all a probable
winner. His candidacy is an important factor in the
contest only because it will endanger and may possi
bly prevent the election of Mr. Crocker.
Such being the situation it is clear that the duty of
sll independent voters is to unite in support of the
'Republican ticket. The vote on the bond election
renders it absolutely necessary that the next Mayor
of San Francisco be a man of first-class business
capacity and experience. Neither Mr. Lane nor Mr.
Schmitz meets those requirements. Mr. Crocker on
the other hand is one of the foremost business men
of California. In the emergency that now confronts
the municipality he is indeed an ideal man for Mayor.
That fact will of course count for much with all
voters who have the welfare of the city at heart, and
when the better elements of the people get a clear
conception of the real issue at stake it is quite probable
we shall see a grand rally regardless of party ties to
the support of the Republican ticket in order to put
an end to the period of faction fights over the spoils
of public office by electing men of known business
capacity to give the city a sound business administra
tion.
THE CITY CAMPAIGN.
Two forms of exhibit are included in
the plan adopted. One will Include a gen
eral exhibit of the State public schools
at large and of the public school system,
and the other will take in individual ex
hibits of cities, counties, private school
systems, even a single educational insti
tution.
LIMIT IS PLACED.
All applications for space must be made
not later than October 10. Mr. Furlong
says that the amount of space that whl
be assigned to any one exhibit cannot be
determined until all the applications are
in. He hopes that the rural schools, as
well as the town and village schools, will
be well represented. The exhibits will be
divided into eight groups. These are di
vided as follows:
Elementary education, including kindergar
ten, elementary grades, training and certifica
tion of teachers and continuation of Â»<*oolÂ»
as evening schools, vacation schools and
schools for special training. '.â¢_._
Secondary education. Including h srh schon s
and academies, manual training high schools
and commercial hish schools. â¢_ '
Higher education. Including colleges and uni
versities, scientific, technical and engineering
schools, professional schools, libraries and mu-
B *lsp*cial Education In the nnÂ« arts. Including
art schools and Institutes, schools and depart
ments of music, conservatories of music.
Special education in agriculture. Including
agricultural colleges and departments, experi
ment stations and instruction In forestry.
Special education in commerce and industry.
Vnder this head are grouped Industrial and
trade schools, business and commercial schools,
evening industrial schools and higher lnstruc
ticn in commerce.
Education of defectives, which takes In Insti
tutions for the blind, for the deaf and dumb
and for the feeble minded.
There is also a class for summer schools,
extension courses, scientific societies and
associations, educational publications,
school furniture and appliances, etc.
Mr. Furlong, with the sanction of the
advisory committee, has sent out 2000
copies of a pamphlet In which educators
will find instructions to guide them in
preparing exhibits to be sent to St. Louis.

DESIRED MATERIAL.
What is suitable material for a display
of California's school output? Mr. Fur
long answers in this manner:
All work from schools, whether of pupils In
elementary classes or of students la hUher
#ra,des or institutions, should be a faithful
representation of the curriculum. It should
comprise a series of lessons; extending, if pos
sible, throuth a month, a term, cr a year, In
A DEFINITE plan has been adopted
for the educational display that
California will make at the St.
Louis Exposition. This exhibit
will represent hundreds of thousands of
California children. Consequently it will
be of leading interest in the minds of all
parents of children of school age.
For the first time In the history of ex
positions, the St. Louis show will have
a large 'building devoted exclusively to
education. This huge structure will cover
seven acres of land. Side by side the
handiwork and the evidences of education
in all lands on which the sun shines will
be displayed. The reputation of Califor
nia for educational advancement has
given i^ the sixth place in the building,
as indicated by the space allotted to the
several States of the Union.
It has been determined by Robert Fur
long, the chief of the department of edu
cation for California at St. Louis, that
California shall display such material as
may best illustrate the different phases
of educational effort in the schools. The
material must come chiefly from the
schools. Historical monographs and offi
cial records will show the development
of the school system of this State, but
it is believed, so says Mr. Furlong, that
the work of pupils will best represent edu
cation in California at the present time.
This statement will appeal to thousands
of ambitious boys and girls throughout
the State. They will see in The Call thin
morning a picture of the splendid struc
ture at St. Louis in which their work

In the pursuit of a career it is always well to be
tireless in effort and persistent in concentrated en
deavor. The bell-boy who robbed a guest a few
days ago fought with a policeman, tried to murder a
bank attache and otherwise conducted himself in a
villainous manner, demonstrated his complete fit
ness for a long residence in a penitentiary.
AT the. meeting to be held at Union Square Hall
this evening the Republican municipal cam
paign will be virtually opened. It is to be a
mass meeting of "business men," but the phrase is to
be understood in the broadest sense, including all
citizens who hold to the sound doctrine that our
municipal affairs should be administered oh business
principles by men of known business capacity and
experience. It is to be in no sense a class meeting.
The appeal and invitation for attendance runs to all
taxpayers and to ell who have any concern and inter
est in the raising and expenditure 'of public revenue
for the common good.
It will be recognired by all good citizens that it
is right and fitting the/Republican campaign should
be inaugurated under business auspices since the
issues of the time are distinctly of a business nature.
Under any and all circumstances there is need for the
exercise of financial skill, strict economy and* a high
order of "executive ability in the conduct of municipal
affairs, but at this juncture there is an added need for
such an administration owing to the relation the in
coming administration will have to the beginning of
the extensive public improvements for which the
people have just voted.
The Republican party presents to the voters of the
city a ticket that has been carefully made up of men
fitted to perform the duties of the offices to which
they have been nominated. It is therefore essentially
a business as well as a Republican ticket. It asks for
support on something more than partisan grounds
and can reasonably expect to have the co-operation
of all citizens who in municipal contests break away
from party ties and vote solely for those candidates
who can be safely counted on to serve their party by
serving the city honestly, faithfully and efficiently.
Experience has shown that in American politics it
is generally safe to estimate an entire ticket by the
character of the candidate chosen to lead it. If the
leader be the representative of a faction, or the tool
of a boss, it is almost sure to be the case that. other
candidates on the ticket will be subject to similar ob
jections; but if the leader be a strong, independent
and thoroughly reliable man one may be reasonably
sure that his colleagues will be worthy of the support
his leadership commands. The Republican ticket in
this case is no exception to that rule. Henry J.
Crocker needs no indorsement to the people of San
Francisco. He has been a business man prominent
among business men for many years. His name, his
work, his record and his character are familiar to all.
He stands as a representative of the best type of our
younger business men and has been rightly chosen to
lead a ticket that appeals to the intelligence of the
people by reason of the sterling quality of the men
who make it up.
The meeting at Union Square Hall this evening
will probably be the most significant single meeting
of the campaign and should be largely attended. The
interests at stake in the contest are the most im
portant from a financial point of view that have been
submitted to the voters of San Francisco for many
years, and as many citizens as possible should make it
a point to hear what Mr. Crocker has to say about
them, for all signs point to the conclusion that he will
be the next Mayor of San Francisco.

of its 'burden or lease it with the same end in view.
It can only grant a franchise under the charter and j
receive in compensation a percentage of the gro8s re- \
celpts. This would not be enough to pay the annual
amount of interest.
We have also shown that if the city would grant
this franchise to a private individual or corporation
it would make a certain annual profit of $18,850. In
view of the fact that the city has just voted to bond
itself to an amount of $18,000,000, with a consequent
interest fund of $13,000,000, we submit that it is timely
and opportune for the taxpayer to regard as of some
importance the giving up of ari annual profit of over
$18,000 in order to undertake an enterprise that may
involve the loss of $40,000.
The duties of running this municipal government
already overtax the officials elected for that purpose.
The voting of the recent bond issue will impose ex
tensive additional burdens upon them. The building
of schoolhouses and sewers and the laying out of
parks will require all of the time and attention posfk
ble to be given to them by the municipal govern
ment. These officials have no time to enter upon a
new undertaking expensive and admittedly experi
mental. If the money recently voted is to be ex
pended wifely and economically it would be folly to
impose upon the city officials who are tp expend it a_
single burden not absolutely necessary for the exist
ence of the city government.

CLUB WOMAN AT WHOSE
HOME DAUGHTERS OF CON
FEDERACY WILL MEET.
TO-DAY the Daughters of the Con
federacy will meet in annual con
vention at the home of the presi
dent of the Alfred Sydney John
ston Chapter, Mrs. Alfred Hunter
Voorhies on California street. The organ
ization is of comparatively recent birth
j In the West, the first chapter this side of
the Rockiesâ the Albert Sydney Johnston
â having been created a very few years
ago. when Mrs. Helen S. Wright, conceiv
ing the necessity of organized effort for
the benefit of friendless Confederate veter
ans, issued a call to many representative
Southern women In this city. Seven pat
riotic daughters of the South, caught by
the spirit that inspired the call, re
sponded, and from that nucleus the or
panization has grown in just proportion
to its worthy objectsâ that of caring for
friendless soldiers of the South, of mark
ing decently the graves of those who fell
in a cause they felt to be right, and of
gathering certified data of the unhappy
war by actual personal knowledge.
"Our principal object â our vital object,"
said Mrs. Voorhies, "Is the care of these
old men of the South. Many of them in
the old days were of independent fortune,
men of culture, education and position,
but now are wholly dependent in their de
clining years. We do not exist to 'keep
up the sentiment,' as has been ridiculous
ly asserted, but to do for the Southern
Rolditrs what our national Government is
doing for the Union soldiersâ that and the
marking of their graves when they shall
have passed away. This is a duty we owe
these menâ we, the daughters of the
Southland."
Inspired by these views the convention
Captain John Metcalfe went out parly
in the day and pave his personal super
vision to the management of affairs. The
bark is now sliphtiy listed to the star
board at an angle of about twenty de
grees oceanward.
Th<- tugs Relief and Alert also went to
the scene and will he kept in calling- dis
tance s-o they can be on hand when their
assistance will be needed.
'Everything went smoothly on the way
qut. but on tho return trip they encoun
tered a rough and choppy sea. which
U>ssed the little boat around like a cocKle
â¢shell. They derided the best plan was to
try to get aboard thÂ»* Gilford, aJid, with
â¢this idea in view, attempted to pull their
frail craft around the bark's stern and
bparfl her on the port side. Just when
they were making the turn a great wave
â¢ hashed against the stranded bark and the
rebound struck the Mini! boat with great
force and ewamped it.
â¢ . For a few minutes boat and occupants
were completely lost to view in the surg
ing of the now raging sea. Finally an
other great wave came thundering along
and on its creast were seen the three men
dinging to the capsized boat. In the
meantime the eye-witnesses on shore were
tryir-g to launch a boat to go to the res
cue, but the waves were running so high
that they found it impossible. The men
on the upturned boat hung on to the keel
with deathlike tenacity, and after being
tossed about for nearly half an hour were
buffeted near enough to the shore so that
the- men o:i the btaeh could wade out
and null them on the eands.
A- great crowd had collected on the
shore, and by the application of restora
tives and rolling: tho sufferers on the
sands they were soon restored sufficiently
to enable them to move about. Dry
< >othes wore provided and Bishop and
Page came into town, but Captain Wood
side Flayed ai the heath to superintend
the work nf setting things in shape to
begin the unloading of the cargo.
As matters look now chances seem pood
for the saving of the ship. The weather
was good yesterday iind the barge was
again towed out and placed alongside.
Donkey were put on board and
rvÂ«?ryth!r.? is now in readiness to begin
to jettison the cargo at daybreak this
morning. The barge carried out a hip
ganÂ£ of men and every possible appliance
of every kind and description to assist in
dislodging the vessel from her present
rocky bed.
<%ptain Alexander Woodside, J. A.
Bishop and Charles Page were capsized
In" the heavy surf and cazno near being
drowned while they were attempting to
board the stranded bark Gifford, near
Mussel Rock, yesterday. Captain Wood
side, who is president of the Pacific
.Stevedoring and Ballasting Company, had
been awarded a contract by Captain Met
oalfe, Lloyd's marine surveyor, to float
the'Gifford. Yesterday while engaged in
his preparations for jettisoning the cargo
of coaJ he found it necessary to commu
nicate with Captain Metcalfe, who was
en board the tug Relief, anchored about
half a mile off shore, where the tug was
placing the kfdge anchors that are to be
used as soon as the stranded vessel is
relieved of her cargo of coal.
Captain Woodside took a small shore
Â¦Boat, and, :n company with B^hop. who
is manager of the Parifir Coast Adjust

to the Relief.

on a party test does not exceed 23.000.
The Socialists number 2000 voters. Re
publican leaders predict that Henry J.
Crocker will get at least 23,000 " votes.
Careful politicians estimate that the
Union Labor party can rally 15,000 voters.
It Is figured that 10,000 can be drawn from
the Democratic fold and 5000 from the
Republican camp. This reduces the nor
mal Democratic strength from 25,000 to
15,000 and diminishes the Republican
strength from 28,000 to 23,000.
CITY IS REPUBLICAN.
In the Democratic camp the Horse and
Cart leaders are elated over what they
are pleased to term, the defeat of McNab.
Outsiders note the fact that tranquillity
came as soon as the rule of threeâ"addi
tion, division and silence" â was adopted.
Politicians of the old regime still con
tend that San Francisco is a Democratic
town, notwithstanding the fact that the
10,000 majority for McKinley in 1900
brought the Republican banner to the
city. The election returns of 1902 clearly
prove that the city is Republican. Dr.
Pardee did not get his party vote be
cause many hostile elements in the party
knifed him. For Secretary of State
Charles F. Curry received 30,753 votes,
against 24.017 for his adversary, Alex
Rosborough. No doubt Mr. Curry's vote
was greater than the actual voting
strength of the party and it was account
ed for on the ground of local acquaint
ance. Colgan, Republican candidate for
Controller, received 29,428 votes, against
23.3S2 for Frederick Harkness, the Dem
ocratic nominee. For Treasurer Truman
Reeves, Republican, got 28,572 votes and
S. H. Brooks, Democrat, 24,557. The vote
for Attorney General was surely a fair
test of party strength, as both candidates
resided outside of San Francisco and no
special light was made on behalf of
either. U. S. Webb, the Republican, ob
tained 28,218 votes and W. A. Gett, the
Democrat, 24,803. For Surveyor General
Victor H. Wood, Republican, got 27,612
votes and Charles H. Holcomb. Democrat,
25,25!). For Superintendent of Public In
struction Thomas J. Kirk, Republican, se
cured 28,903 votes and his Democratic op
ponent 23,332.
DEFEAT OF McNAB.
It did not escaDe the observation of
workingmen that the recent Schmitz-
Parry-Ruef Union Labor Convention at
Pioneer Hall contained a large representa
tion of city office-holders and job-chasers.
It is common talk In labor circles that
the candidates on the Republican ticket
are the only candidates before the people
that pay "fair" prices for making and dis
playing campaign banners.
Republican leaders are informed that
many well-known labor union men, team
sters, expressmen, clerks, porters, long
shoremen and others, have resolved to
give Mr. Crocker their open support in
this campaign and to vote for him on
election day, basing their preference on
the ground that he is a better jfriend of
labor than any other candidate now be
fore the people. The knowledge that Re
publican workingmen have determined to
assert their Independence of bosses causes
consternation in the midnight councils of
Rucf, Parry and Schmitz.
Business men who favor the election of
Henry J. Crocker to the office of Mayor
of San Francisco are cordially invited to
attend the meeting at Union Square Hall
on Post street this evening. No special
invitations have been issued. Republican
business men and others who are im
pressed with the belief that the affairs of
the city should be administered accord
ing to the spirit of the charter are asked
to come forward and sign the roll of the
Crocker Club. There are indications that
the meeting will be largely attended and
that an effective organization of active
men to promote the prosperity of the city
will be established.
Myles McCarthy and Miss Aida Wool
cott, In "The Race Tout's Dream," were
interrupted several times by encores.
They are a clever, pair and have made a
decided hit in this city. The "tout" dia
lect fetches the audience from the first
and few people on the stage can deliver
it more precisely than can McCarthy.
Paulo and Dike, in "A French Frappe";
Al Carleton and Williard Terre, in "A
Strlngtown Yap," and the great Alexius,
in astonishing bicycle work, complete the
bill.
Of Arthur Cunningham, the operatic
barytone, little need be said in the way
of Introduction. He is. too well known
and too popular with the theater-goers of
San Francisco to need praise in print.
Yesterday he discarded the paint and wigs
of tho opera characters and came from
the wings as himself. When he stepped
out he was cheered and it is sufficient to
say that he was obliged to discontinue
encores on account of the length of the
programme. . ''â¢ >
The Golden Gate Quartet, with Fanny
Wlnfred in songs and quick changes, is
composed of people who are stars in
specialties. Their singing was of the best
and their team dancing brought down the
house. They appeared in every manner of
costume, including Chinese, and their
singing Impersonations could not be beat.
The Pantzer trio, assisted by Mrs. Carl
Pantzer, opened with a new comedy act,
"A Gymnast's Parlor Amusement." The
contortion work was marvelous and the
acrobatic turns were graceful and diffi
cult.
The Orpheum may always be relied
upen for a good show, but yester
day's performance was in the superlative
degree, so far as excellence is concerned.
There are acts from the cream of vaude
ville. Every feature is a show in Itself
and such an aggregation of stars can sel
dom be found on a single programme.
It is a most difficult matter for an audi
ence to classify the acts from a stand
point of pleasure. Each is of a different
character, but distinct novelty is brought
out and smiles or attention alternate as
the curtain rises on comedy or the seri
ous. It was one succession of high-class
amusement from the start to the finish.
Vivacious Marie Stuart and Clftyton
White, assisted by Pauline Taylor, appear
in a one-act comedy, "Paris." Few
sketches are any better. It sparkles with
good things from start to finish. The plot
is original and the acting splendid. Miss
Stuart, as Mrs. Dickey Waldorg of Paris,
London and New York, introduced ver
sitality that has not been seen since the
engagement of Elfie Fay. White appears
in two roles and does each to perfection.
He makes a typical ward heeler and as
Judge Metropole leaves no wrong impres
sion of a "man of the world."
The present minstrel company has some
very good voices in its ranks and some
clever specialty artists. George W. Jen
kins and James H. Sadler are good tenor
singers, and Aubrey Pringle is a young
basso who gives promise of making a
good reputation, for he certainly has 'a
splendid voice. George Jones, Fred May,
John King and Charles E. Gano rendered
a number of amusing songs and duets and
actually sprung a number of new Jokes.
J. A. Probst is a wonderful Imitator of
birds and animals, and the daring feats
of Kartell! on a slack wire evoked loud
plaudits.
* The choruses were up to the usual
standard and the Instrumental music up
to the average. The stage settings and
costumes are good to look upon and the
company Is likely to attract large audi
ences during the week.
West's Minstrels presents the usual ag
gregation of solo singers and variety per
formers, with a wildly absurd "after
piece," that causes laughter more on ac
count of the ludicrous antics of thÂ© per
formers.
West's Minstrels at the California The
ater last night were greeted by an audi
ence that filled every seat in the audito
rium and overflowed into the foyer.
. The audience enjoyed the programme of
variety presented and the company
worked hard and was rewarded with con
siderable applause.; The- makeup of the
organization is on the same lines as seen
in previous years. There Is nothing of
the old style minstrelsy, when scenes of
the lives of the colored people were real
istically presented.
Nowadays a minstrel company, with
few exceptions, does not deign to blacken
up, and as for buck and wing dances and
plantation melodies, they are unknown.
"Under Two Flags," a play Â¦which has
always thrilled San Francisco theater
goers, was revived at the Grand Opera
house by the Neill Company Ia3t night.
The vast throng which greeted the pro
duction was well satisfied. It was re
ceived with that enthusiasm which it de
served and several curtain calls were
given the favorites.
James NeUl and hia well balanced com
pany played the piece as well as it was
ever given in this city. The strong
points in the great drama were well
brought out and the scenic effects were
more than up to the standard. James
Neill in the role cf Bertie Cecil came in
for a most generous share of the ap
plause, as he usually does, and his Inter
pretation of this role is certainly good.
Miss Edythe Chapman as Cigarette
made an impression on the audience that
will last. She more than did Justice to
the part and carried it with that vim
and dash that made Blanche Bates fam
ous in the role. Mi3s Chapman was called
before the curtain on several occasions
and during the entire play was the cen
tral figure.
The rest of the company were equally
good in the many role3. Donald Bowles,
Reginald Travers, Clifford Dempsey and
Edith Campbell all came, in for their
share of the applause at different times.
The play is one that has always been
much admired and seeing it acted by the
Nflll Company is a pleasure that should
not be missed. -

San Francisco County eleven won the
last match of the cricket season with the
greatest ease yesterday from the Pacific
Club on the ground at Webster street,
Alameda. The Pacific captain lost the
toss and his team was sent to the wickets
first. Only two of the batsmen. Wilding
(46, not out), and Langdale (29) proved
able to do anything against the bowling
of Petersen and Kortlang. Wilding played
an excellent inning, going in first and
carrying his bat almost without giving a
chance. He was ably seconded by Lang
dale, but the rest of the team collapsed,
the innings closing for 99 runs.
Richardson put hla men in in reverse
order and' did not bat himself, but 219 runs
were scored for the loss of eight wickets,
Wilkes making 62, Kortlang 44 not out.
and Johns 32. Nine of the Pacific team
tried their hands with the ball. Bennlon

A large crowd turned out at the Cali
fornia* courts and many good matches
were played. The best match In singles
was that between "Will Allen and Grant
Smith. The latter was in fine form and
took Allen's measure rather easily. In the
last two sets the '.jser played an excellent
game. Smith won the first three and Al
len the- fourth.
H. Schmidt and Merle Johnson played
an exciting one-set match with Frank
Mitchell and Carl Gardner. Schmidt was
In excellent form and played a tie with
Johnson. Each won two sets. Mitchell
proved too strong for Chet Smith, whom
he beat three straight. "W. S. MacGavin.
the veteran of the courts, showed that he
can still play some. He made Allen play
his best to win.
The following matches were played:
The two new asphalt courts recently
laid out In the park were used for the
first time yesterday. They are excellent
courts and have a fine location.
Outside of the tournament match the
most Interesting ?amÂ« was that between
Will Allen and Clarence Griffin. Allen was
tired from a hard match in the morning,
but managed to defeat his younger op
ponent. All three sets went to deuce, the

The handicap doubles tennis tournament
which has been In progress for the last
three Sundays was completed yesterday.
The honors were won by the Baker broth
ersâGeorge and Nealâ of Oakland. They
met Harry Routh and Charles Dunlap,
the other scratch team, on even terms
and won easily. The clever brothers took
three straight sets. The outcome was
evident from the start. The losers had
won the cup once, and a victory for them
would have put them in the lead. This
Is the first time the Baker brothers havo
competed. In the future they will play
from back of scratch.
Routh and Dunlap played most of the
balls to Neal Baker, while Routh was re
ceiver general on his side of the net. The
score was &â 1, 6 â J. 6 â *.

Mr. Wheeler, the gentleman â¢ who es
sayed to go a few with his mitts with the
umpire in Saturday's game, has been sus
pended by the management of the league
for an Indefinite period. The directors of
the league say they will stop rowdy ball
playing. They Intend to make an exam

Dillon to second base yesterday and Spies

Francisco has won one game out
of seven played. They were lucky to get
that one and the fans are sorry the An
gels did not make a clean sweep and
capture the whole seven. The results
yesterday were: Morning, Los Angeles 3,
San Francisco 2; afternoon, Los Angeles
9, San Francisco 0.
During the morning: at Oakland Uncle
Henry's alleged ball players made the
best showing of the week against the An
gels. They managed to keep the result
in doubt till the end. The southern
swingers finally came through with the
necessary tally and won out. It was a
good came from the start and an error
by Krug broke It up.
But. oh! what a different aspect mark
ed the afternoon struggle. It looked like
a contest between a Missouri cricket club
and the Pittsburg ball nine. The home
tossers were skirmishing around for a
run for two hours and they have not
scored it yet.
Joe Corbe-tt was the boy who kept them
away from the plate. In all his career
in the league he never pitched ball as he
did yesterday afternoon. Never on the
home lot was a ball team so .omplntely
at the mercy of a pitcher as Ban Fran
cisco was at the mercy of the former
Baltimore star.
They never had a single chance to score
a run. From the first inning on he had
them buffaloed and although h&vpitched
many an easy one over the plate the Na
tives seemed afraid to hit at them. His
curves and speed were about right and
he had splendid control of the ball.
The pitcher's box was not the only
place In which Joe made good. Out of
three times at bat he clouted the leather
for a home run and a three-bagger. His
homer came in the sixth and sailed far
over the right field fence. In the next
round, with Egan on flrsC Corbett landed
on the ball and lined it out past the left
field bleachers for the cleanest triple
made on the grounds this season.
Cutter began to get his bumps when the
game was well started. The Angels were
in the best of form and everything the
youngster tossed up they hit hard. Runs
began to accumulate in the second . in
ning and when once they began to arrive
the locals were powerless to stop them.
The natives committed *five glaring er
rors, all of which allowed runs to come
In.

CHICAGO, Oct. 4-â Chicago bookmakers
have not been put out of commission by
the "killlnjr" on The Fiddler, which won
at 20 to 1 at Morris Park yesterday, but
they recelTed such a financial jolt as they
will feel for many days. How much
aoney was lost ia Chicago will never be
ascertained, but it la believed by the
eporting fraternity to be well up to
$200,000.
"Jim" O'Leary. the poolroom king, is
Bald to have been given the worst of it
to the tune of more than 5100,000, and "So- i
cial" Smith of Smith & Perry is on thi<
unofficial schedule as having lo?t $38,000.
Other big and little lasses make the "kill-
Ing" one of the biggest in turf annals.
O'Leary announct-d to-night th:tt he
would not pay any more checks until he
6hall have been assured that the horse
that ran was not a "ringer." Other book
makers v.-lll follow the example of the
leader and withhold their money from
winning bettors until the atmosphere Is
cleared. It reached the ears of book
makers to-night that there had been an
agreement among jockeys to pocket the
favorites and let the long shot win.
The general opinion is that the sports
who were hard hit are merely trying to
find a good excuse for not paying the
winners to-morrow, when strong pressure
Is pure to be brought to bear upon them.
John J. Ryan, who is credited with hav
ing cleared hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in the East during the last few
weefca. added at least $30,000 to his bank
roll yesterday, according to the best In
formation obtainable here.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. Oct. 4.-The local
poolrooms were hit very hard by the win
r.lr.g of The Fiddler In the last race at
Morris Park yesterday, they losing from
flO.000 to $15,000. The bulk of the money
v.as won by a couple of strangers, pre
sumably from St. Louis, who came here
especially to play the. race.

The best shooting at the pistol target
was done by William F. Blasse with 87
rings and George Tammeyer with 80. The
results:
The attendance of marksmen at Schuet
zen Park was not as large yesterday as
usual. The changing light and shifting
wind made it difficult for the riflemen to
get In scores that would go toward In
creasing their monthly averages.
Marked interest was taken in the com
petition monthly medal shoot of the Cali
fornia Bchuetzen Club. Al. Gehret, Otto
Bremer and A- Strecker, who shoot In
the first champion class, are all bunched
for first honors, and a difference of a few
rings will win or lose the championship.
Yesterday Al. Gehret was high with 221
rings and A. Strecker second with 21S.
In the second champion class A. Rah
wyler was high with 203 and 205. In the
second class M. F. Blasse carried oft the
honors with the good score of 217. M. K.
Hartter* with 212 to his credit carried oft
the third class medal. The fourth class
honors were won by H. Sheunert with
the good score of 197 rings.
Landry C. Babin was on the range again
and took a hand In the day's proceedings.
That he can still handle the rifle Is shown
by his good scores of 200 and 203 rings in
his medal string.

After working for several months on the
silhouette target, the Nationals have come
back to the use of the Blunt target. 'In
consequence, the results of yesterday's
shoot at Bhell Mound rifle range do not
compare favorably with the average
scores. Lieutenant Ross says the change
has been made in the interest of marks
manship, however, and that the artillery
men will Improve after a few days' prac

played yesterday at C. W\ Clark's grounds
near San Mateo. The -score was 8 to 3 In
favor of the home team. The three Lyons
brothers and Coutts of the Talagoo team
did brilliant work. Began and Tansey
were but little behind them, while Wil
liams, Judge and Creely of the Tecumsehs
were almost equally clever. The first six
games were played without a pause, ex
cept the brief moment required to face
the ball. The first three of these went to
San Mateo, scored respectively by J. J.
Lyons. Theberg and M. J. Lyons. Then
Williams and Creely scored goals for the
Tecumsehs. followed by Coutts for San
Mateo, making the score 4 to 2.
San Francisco scored only once after
this, by Williams In the seventh game.
M. J. Lyons and Coutts quickly followed
with one each for the Talagoos. The
greatest playing of the match was seen in
the ninth game, which was iongr and
fierce. The ball traversed the field a score
Of times before Degan of San Mateo, on
a long drive, sent It between the posts.
J. J. Lyons was laid out with a broken
hand, and Beck with and Jones were also
injured. Lyons could not resume the

ing in the tenth.

Pioneers of the region say that Honey

PARIS. Oct. 5.â The Paris edition of tho
New York Herald publishes a dispatch
from Bogota, via Panama, which sayB
that no immediate steps will be taken in
favor of the canal. The opponents of the
treaty are apparently pleased to see the
United States feign to return to the Nica
ragua route. President! Roosevelt's atti
tude is interpreted in Bogota as a sign
that he will wait until August if neces
sary, and that the United States will
eventually accept Colombia's conditions.
The dispatch adds that President Roose

the United States Congress before mak
ing a decision has produced a bad impres
sion, throughout the Isthmus. â¢

Both young men shot themselves In the

This afternoon they went to a hardware

pattern and loaded them at the store.
Williamson left some friends, with whom
he had been talking, and a moment after
reaching his room flred a bullet into his

Welsh boarded In another part of the
city and did not reach his room until mid
n?ght. He read for a half-hour, then
placed his revolver to his left temple and
sent a bullet into his brain.
Separation from the Chicago young
woman did not lessen Williamson's pas
sion, and he grew morose and then
threatened suicide. On such occasions
Welsh expressed a determination to kill
himself also, and a week ago It was mu
tually understood that, when William

Williamson was engaged to a young lady

him and he came here with the hope of
forgetting her. He and Welsh had been
warm .friends in Chicago, and when Wil

PROCESSION IS FORMED.
After the sermon tfce benediction was
pronounced and* the procession was then
formed in honor of the Feast cf the Ros
ary. To the strains of St Dominic's
band the procession marched from the
robing-rcom and down the main aisle of
the church to the street and then around
the entire block on which the edifice
stands. Hundreds of little children were
in the procession, the girls dressed In
white and wearing the insignia of their
religious schools.
The various banners depicting the les-
Fons of the rosary were borne aloft by
adults, and white robed priests slowly
marched along, all singing the prayers
of the rosary. A statue of the Virgin,
decorated with roses and surrounded by
candles, was borne on the shoulders of
four me-n. and a large number of women
and men were In the procession, together
with Sisters of the Dominican order.
All the adults in the procession carried
rosaries in their hands and moved the
beads as they recited the prayers. The
procession was witnessed by a large gath
ering of spectators.

In. honor of that victory we celebrate the
Fca*t <T the Hoses, which draws our thoughts
to the fact that God works wonder* by mean*
of sinr.l: thing*. The holy rogary has been
sanctioned by Pojvs and Bishops and the IatÂ»
Pontiff was devoted to the rojary cf the Holy
Virgin and added to its litany.
We should love the roeary o? Mary for what
it ha* done inside as well as outside the church.
Who can tell what wonders hav? be*-n wrought
by*irayers of the holy rosary? Multitudes have
b<en cured of evil and *in. and countless death
agrcnies have been softened. Hardened dinners
heve b*en Faved by It and heretics converted.
Yet there are people, and some in the church,
who despise it and say tlm such a mode of
prayer Is not for them.
Saintly men have said the rosary dally and
ordered It* recital, and kin^s and princes have
loved to rec'.te its prayers. It should be a
consolation to all of u*. and the sacred beads
should t><? In the hands of every man and
woman of the Catholic church.
The prayers of the roÂ«ary are simple and
beautiful fend they embrdy all that exists in
our religion. The rosary teaches us the sub
lirr;<? lessons of the church and works for the
redemption of .mankind. Love your beads and
carry them with you always. Tor In time of
peril they will protect you, and the Holy Queen
will bestow many MeFsinscs. Her intercession
is co powerful that no soul can remain in vice
if her aid Is asked. Place your trust in the
Hoiy v !rt:in and practice the many virtues
that adorn hÂ«r saintly heritage.

FCWIB OF TEE EOSARY.
The religious service was materially aid
ed by the special musical programme,
rendered under the direction of Dr. H. J.
Stewart, the organist of St. Dominic's.
The choir of the church was enlarged,
and the services of Madame Marquardt,
harpist, and of Theodore Mansfeldt, vlo
lincellLst, were utilized. .
Caesar Frank's famous "Mass in A" was
rendered by the choir, organ and instru
mentaJlsts. it being the first time that
the renowned composition had been heard
In San Francisco.
The sequence was "0. Salutaris." sung
by Miss E. V. McCloskey and composed
by Dr. Stewart. For the offertory Miss
Camllle Frank sang "Alma Virgo." by
Hummel, and the concerted music con
sisted of "Asperges. 'â¢ by Dethier, and
"Venl Creator." by Hammerl.
The sermon was preached by Rev.
Father J. P. O'Connor, O. P.. and was
mainly devoted to the duty of all Cath
olics to use the rosary. He said, that
while man was obliged to utilize power
ful means to attain certain ends, Gcd
worked through what seemed small sub
jects. He cited the deliverance of Is
rael by the rod of Moses, the death of
Goliath by the sling and pebble of David,
the wooden cross as a means for the re
demption of mankind and the saving of
the worid by twelve lowly men.
SPECIAL MASS IS SUNG.
A large congregation gathered at St.
Dominlc'e Church, Bush and Stelner
streets, yesterday morning to witness the
celebration of the Feast of the Roses, one
of the most important events In the his
tory of the Catholic Church, and which
dates back to the year 1BTL

of the prayers of the rcsary, which, tra
dition asserts, led to the defeat of the
Turks by the Christians at the battle of
Lepanto. the anniversary is always cele
brated by elaborate services In all Catho
lic churches.
The Interior of St. Dominic's Church
presented an impressive appearance at
the services held yesterday morning. The
main and side altars were ablaze with
lighted candles and almost every variety
of Californian flowers had been utilized
to decorate the sacred structures.
As the congregation entered the church
acolytes presented the worshippers with
beautiful flowers, and the air was filled
with fragrant odor. Previous to the cele
bration of the mass the officiating priests
proceeded through the church and blessed
the roses presented to the congregation.
The mass was an impressive one, and
was celebrated by Rev. J. C. Kourk, O.

deacon, and Rev. Father Clyne, sub

Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall's lecture on the I
"Elixir of Life" attracted a big audi- 1
ence to Stelnway Hall last night, when he
traced the history of the search for the
philosopher's stone back to the period of
the ancients. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall said
that 6uch great minds as Albertus Mag- i
nus, Pliny, Paracelsus, VanHelmont and 1
Roger Bacon had plainly expressed their
knowledge, and not . merely a belief, in
the existence of the "stone." Dr. Mclvor-
Tyndall said he believed . that when the
world shall have discovered the ultimate
uses of radium it will also be discovered
that within the power, of the human mind
are all the qualities of that substance
itself. Next Sunday Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall ,
will discuss the opposite - theme, Â« "The
Thought That Kills." _...____ __ j

the boisterous conduct and rowdyism that

Deuprey first came into prominence as
the special counsel for the prosecution
being employed by the insurance compan
iesâin the case -of Dr. J. Milton Bowers,
charged with murdering his wife by
poison to get the insurance on her life.
Eugene N. Deuprey was a familiar figure
in legal and political circles. He was born
in New Orleans and was 65 years old at
the time of his death. He came to this
city when a lad and received his education
here and was admitted to the bar In this
State. He quickly earned the reputation
of being a skillful orator and in a few
years built up a lucrative practice.
Affiliated with the Democratic party,
Deuprey was in demand during political
campaigns, and during his career he de
livered many speeches in this State. He
ran for the offlce of District Attorney in
1S98, but was defeated, and subsequently
was appointed as an Assistant District
Attorney by District Attorney Bylngton.
Mr. Deuprey was conveyed home, and
his condition grew worse. Yesterday mcrn
ing he got up out of bed to go to the
bathroom and suddenly fell senseless on
the floor. Dr. Wiegand was summoned,
but when he arrived Deuprey had passed
away. The body was taken in charge by
the Masonic fraternity, to which Deuprey
belonged, and the remains were removed
to an undertaking establishment. The
funeral will be held under the auspices of
the Masons, Â¦ ' .
three days. The Immediate cause
of death was heart-failure, caused by con
gestion of the lungs. Deuprey had been
in failing' health for some time and last
week he contracted a severe cold. His
physician, Dr. Wlegand, advised him to
remain indoors, but he went out last
Wednesday to attend court and fainted
twice while in the courtroom.

known attorney, died suddenly
yesterday at his residence, 2103

George Balmer, a sailor living at 317
First street, -was choked and robbed by
two men on the roof of the lodging-house
at 715 Howard street early yesterday
morning. Balmer called at the lodging
house to eee a friend and met . two
men on the stairs. He asked them, if
they knew the number of the room oc
cupied by her, and they replied that she
had moved upstairs. They offered* to show
him the room and he went upstairs with
them.
The two men took Balmer to the roof
of the building and one of them grabbed
him by the throat and told him to give
up his money or he would be killed. The
other man pulled a knife out of his pock
et and held it close to Balmer's heart,
while with the other hand he went
through Balmer's pockets, taking $2 50,
all the money he had. Balmer struggled
all the time to free himself from the man
who held him by the throat and finally
succeeded. He ran to the fire escape and
made his way to the sidewalk down it.
Balmer met Policemen Hinrichs and
Tillman and told them of his experience.
Every effort is being made to find the
two robbers.
Policeman Tillman made an arrest In
another robbery early yesterday morning.
He saw three men acting suspiciously
with Henry Gohringer, 549 Howard street.
They took Gohringer into the dark door
way of a house on Mission street, near
Third, and Tillman thought It was time
to act. He ran toward the doorway and
the three men fled, but Tillman captured
one of them, who gave his name as Jo
seph Davis, a laborer, 19 years of age.
Gohringer said that the three men had
tried to rob him and Davis was booked
on a charge of attempt to commit rob
bery.
Bowers was convicted of the* crime. Deu
prey gained further prominence as the
attorney for Theodore Durrant, who was
executed for the murder of Blanche La
mont. The counsel saved his client from
his doom for a considerable period by legal
technicalities and appeals. On the very
day that Durrant was hanged at
San Quentln prison argument was
made before the United States Su
preme Court on a writ of error
taken to that tribunal from a judgment
of the District Court for the Northern
District of California, denying the petition
of. Durrant for a writ of habeas corpus.
Louis . P. Boardman, representing Deu
prey, made the argument before the
United States Supreme Court, and had
not finished It when the trap dropped, but
upon the conclusion of his argument the
writ was denied.
Deuprey was twice married. His first
wife secured a divorce from him in this
city on December 23, 1S99, failure to pro
vide being the cause assigned. Mrs. Deu
prey was given the custody of the four
minor children of the marriage.
Deuprey was married a second time on
December 28, 1S99, a few days after his
first wife had secured her divorce. His
second wife was Mrs. ' J. Craig
at the time of her wedding to the attor
ney, and Is a half-sister of Gertrude Ath
erton, the novelist. She has been very ill
for the past few months, and her rela
tives fear for her life.

Archbishop Montgomery delivered a
powerful address, in which he called upon
those of the Catholic Slavonian Church to
remember that unity was at all times es
sential in their direction of the church,
and he gave them his hearty congratula
tions upon their achievement in so far
realizing the beginning of a place of wor
ship wherein they could participate in
their devotion in their own language.
Father Bontempo 1 followed the Arch
bishop and spoke of the necessity of the
church where they could worship and hear
the doctrines of the Catholic Church in
their Own language. He paid a deep and
thankful tribute to Archbishop Riordan
and Archbishop Montgomery. j
The ceremonies were concluded with a '
prayer offered by Archbishop Mont
gomery. '.
Archbishop Montgomery read a prayer
and then descended to the north por
tion of the ground, where a large
wooden cross stood as a mark of where
the altar will be placed. His Grace blessed
the cross and sprinkled it with holy water
and then proceeded further around the
ground, offering up a prayer the while.
Architect Shea then offered his erace a
trowel and the corner stone was impres
sively laid. Beneath the stofce was placed
a box containing portraits placed in the
following order: Pope Pius X, Archbish
op Riordan, Archbishop Montgomery,
President Roosevelt, Governor George C.
Pardee, Mayor Schmitz and a history
and plans and picture of the new church,
together with copies of the dally papers
and coins. >
After the stone had been laid Arch
bishop Montgomery expressed the re
grets that Archbishop Riordan felt at be
ing unable to attend the ceremony and ex
plained that ill health alone prevented the
Archbishop from being present.
OFFERS CONGRATULATIONS.
Arriving at the ground upon which the
church is to be erected, a full description
of which structure has already appeared
in The Call, Archbishop Montgomery and
the. deacons of honor and Father Henry
Bontempo and Father Francis de Turk,
who will have charge of the Church of
the Nativity of Our Lord, ascended the
platform from which the corner stone wag
to be laid.
BLESSES THE CROSS.
There were in the procession fully 600.
First came fifty little girls, headed by a
banner, and following them were over 300
men, headed by a handsome banner, the
silken cords of which^ were held by six
little girls attired in white. Then followed
a number of choir and altar boys in pur
ple and lace vestments, preceding the
clergy, with the Rev. Father Frieden in
the center. An acolyte and an altar boy
came next, anu immediately following, in
his purple vestments, was Archbishop
Montgomery, supported by the Rev.
Father Landry, S. J., and the Rev.
Father Morgan of the Youth's Directory,
deacons of honor.
A procession of reverent men and
women and prelate and clergy formed at
