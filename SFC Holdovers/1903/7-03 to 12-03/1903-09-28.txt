WIFE AFRAH> OF HIM.
Chambers called to see his wife on sev
eral occasions. He was usually Intoxi
cated. His wife feared him and tried to
shun him. Yesterday evening 1 shortly be
fore 7 o'clock Chambers rang the bell at
Mrs. Payne's residence, but receiving no
response he turned the knob of the door
and walked into the hallway.
No one in the house saw him enter, and
a few seconds later the occupants were
startled by the report of a pistol. Mrs.
Payne and Mrs. Chambers rushed down
stairs, and at the end of a short hallway
they saw Chambers lying at full length,
his lifeblood fast ebbing from an ugly
wound In -the roof of his mouth and a 3S
callber pistol tightly clutched in his right
hand.
Signs of life were still visible, so tha
patrol wagon at the Harbor Police station
was hastily summoned. The dying man
was removed to the Harbor Emergency
Hospital, but he passed away ere the
wagon reached Its destination.
Chambers left a farewell message for
his wife, rudely penciled in a' notebook.
The missive was full of passionate plead
ings for forgiveness and expressed re
morse for a misspent life and an unhappy
marriage. It ran:
"Darling, try to forget what I have
done. I will meet you in heaven. Do not
think of me any more, but remember that
I died loving you. Try to forget the past
and the Iive3 you have ruined. Give my
love to mother and the folks, and remem
'ber that I loved you more than life lt-
WAS POSSESSED OF MEANS.
Chambers was apparently a man of
means at one time and of late he had
been existing chiefly on remittances
from his father in England. He left the
old country about a year ago, having lost
his fortune there. He came to this State
about three months ago and was engaged
in some kind of a fruit enterprise in
"Wheatland. He was last seen at the Win
chester Hotel at 1 o'clock on Sunday
morning, when he came looking for C. K.
Thorp of Sausallto. He failed to find
Thorp at the time and left the hotel with
out going near his room.
Among the dead man's effects wero Iet-
his career of adversity by
sending a bullet through his brain in a
hallway at 413 Harrison street shortly be
fore 7 o'clock last night. Chambers wan
in an Intoxicated condition when he com
mitted the rash deed and had gone to the
place in search of his wife, who fled from
him a few days ago, fearing for her own
safety.
Chambers and hi3 wife arrived in thl3
city about ten day3 ago from "Wheatland.
Yolo County. "While residing in the latter
town he was wont to maltreat his spouse,
and had threatened her life on several oc
casions, so the story gees. The woman
became acquainted with Mrs. Payne of 413
Harrison street, this city, who was visit
ing in Wheatland, and confided her trou
bles to the latter.
Mrs. Payne took an Interest in her,
newly.made friend's welfare and Invited
her to stop at her home when she ar

her any more. Mrs. Payne heard nothing
more from Mrs. Chambers till a few days

of the former and asked for shelter.

HELENA, Mont., Sept. 27.â There was
a startling development in the $50,000
Northern Pacific dynamite plot to-day, in
that it became known that Thomas Tra
vis, chief of police of this city, has re
ceived an ultimatum from the conspira
tors ordering the immediate release of two
men who are confined in the City Jail on
the charge of having attempted to dyna
mite the Northern Pacific bridge at Liv
ingston a few days after the first, or
$25,000 ultimatum, was delivered to the
railroad company. The city officials have
a strong case connecting these men with
the crime, although the evidence is prin
cipally circumstantial.
The notice received by the Helena police
is to the effect that if the men are not re
leased by Monday noon the Jail will be
blown up with dynamite. This letter Is
believed to have the same origin as those
sent to the Northern Pacific demanding
$50,000. All of the letters sent to the rail
road company were mailed at either Hel
ena or Butte and the one received by
Chief Travis is postmarked at Helena.
It was learned to-day that the Northern
Pacific was given until October 4 next to
comply with, the demands of the conspir
ators. It is learned also that as a means
of knowing that their terms had been ac
cepted the railroad was to place white
flags on all engines for at least twenty
four hours prior to the delivery of the
money at a point west of Garrison. .\u25a0
The company, in Its attempt to capture
the dynamiters, blundered in not posting
the flags on west bound trains, as di
rected, and then sending out an armed
posse on another engine closely pursuing
it- As It was the conspirators, not seeing
the white flags, did not meet the first
light engine.

CRIPPLED, almost penniless
and fearing to be dependent
on his friends, Henry James
Masson, a stenographer, aged
about 27 years, put a bullet
through his brain about 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon in Golden
Gate Park, and died two hours later at
the Park Emergency Hospital without re
gaining consciousness.
Masson selected for the tragedy a grassy
knoll somewhat covered with brush be
hind the- handball courts, near the south
drive. He had made all preparations for
his final act. He had purchased a cheap
revolver, disposed of all his earthly be
longings and written a letter expressing
his final wishes. The shot which ended
his life was heard by Policemen Manuel
de la Guerra and John O'Shea, who
rushed to the spot whence the sound pro
ceeded and .found the unfortunate young
man gasping 1 in his death agonies. They
summoned the ambulance and had him
conveyed to the Park Emergency Hos
pital, where his recovery was pronounced
impossible.
LEAVES A LETTER.
In one of the pockets of his coat was
found tn$ following letter, dated yester
day:
To whom it may concern: This is to cer
tify that I am Harry James Masson. In the
event^ of my death I desire that I be cre
mated and that ray remains be disposed of
without any religious ceremony of any kind
and that I wish my friend, Charles Eetz of
720 California street, to have absolute con
trol of everything concerning the handling
of my body and also to have absolute pos
session of all my belongings contained in my
trunk.
TIRED OF STRUGGLING.
Besides the letter, the clothing contained
5 cents In money, a Young Men's Chris
tian Association card, a chtjap chain with
out a watch and some other trinkets of
no value. On the lapel of his coat was
the photograph of a young woman, whose
identity could not be learned. \u25a0
Charles Betz, to whom the suicide con
fided the care of his body and his belong
ings, was first Informed of the tragedy
by a Call reporter, and seemed deeply
shocked at the news. He said it was not
altogether unexpected, as Masson had
frequently, threatened to take his own life.
Masson, Betz said, was a sufferer from
hip disease, and had to wear apparatus
to enable him to walk. Up to two weeks
ago he had been employed as a stenogra
pher in the Callaghan building, but he did
not know by whom. Two weeks ago Mas
son told him he had given up his position
and said he was tired of struggling with
the world.
Yesterday afternoon Betz met Masson
at the Park and took him for a boat ride.
He left him at 4 o'clock and returned to
the city. At that time he claims that
Masson said nothing about killing him
self. Bctz said he would carry out the
wishes of his dead friend and see that
his body was cremated, as had been re
quested.
It was said that Masson was deeply In
love with the girl whose photograph was
found on him after the shooting. He made
no secret of his infatuation, but never, as
far as could be learned, told who the girl
In the meantime two brave men had
stripped and plunged into the sea. F. J.
Healy of 33S0 Twenty-third street and J.
S. Tait of S14B Larkin street risked their
lives in the hope of 'rescuing the unfor
tunate suicide. They clutched the body
and held it near the shore until the life
savers arrived and took it In charge.
About six months ago Gerke made a trip
to Germany, expecting to receive $4000
which had been left from a sister's es
tate. According to Herman Harms, a
liquor dealer at 100 Geary street, who
identified > the" body, there was some dis
pute over the money, and the brewery
man returned to this city penniless. He
resided at 405 Geary street and has been
in the habit of -paying the landlady his
rent from day to day. Yesterday he had
no money and promised to pay to-day.
Then it was that he must have been
seized with, a fit of despondency and
planned his death. ;
The body is at the Morgue and friends
will take charge of it to-day.
Gerke left several notes written in Ger
man, which could scarcely be deciphered.
The import of them was that he died in
distress and that friends would under
stand the reason of his act."
Police Officer Donovan was aboard a
California street steam train when the
suicide occurred. He was informed of the
occurrence, and the locomotive was un
coupled from the train and returned to
Lands End. When the policeman arrived
the body was rolling about in the surf
and life was extinct. A message was Im
mediately sent to the life-saving station.
The life-savers responded, and in view of
hundreds of people launched their boat
It required but a short time to reach the
scene of the tragedy. Then a rope was
attached to the body and it was held se

Charles Meehan, Tom Davis and James
Murphy. (
Shortly before 3 o'clock many people
assembled in the vicinity of 'Land's End

self-destruction was . premeditated, and
when on the summit " he loaded ;; his

worked on his mind until he considered
life not worth the living and ended what
he deemed a miserable existence in the

ments were made on the New York and
Ottawa Railroad for a special train to
night to take the members of "William
Rockefeller's family and their visitors
from Bay Pond in the Adirondacks to
New York City.
Neither Rockefeller nor his son, "William
G. Rockefeller was a . passenger on the
Adirondack Express that left New York
last evening. Loungers in the station at
Paul Smith's were disappointed this morn
ing when the millionaire failed to alight
there. It had been assumed that Rocke
feller would come to pass Sunday on the
vast preserves in which he has taken so
deep an interest. There are no regular
trains on Sunday on the Ottawa road
which connects with the New York Cen
tral at Tupper Lake Junction.
Last Sunday Rockefeller went up on the
Adirondack express to Paul Smith's and
drove over the eighteen miles of mountain
road from there to Bay Pond. It is be
lieved probable that he hesitated about
coming to-day on account of the excite
ment prevailing throughout that section
because of the murder of Orlando P. Dex
ter. This crime has revived the open hos

ing about his residence at Bay Pond has
been lighted almost as brilliantly at night
as the streets of a city and there has been
a cordon of guards to keep out all intru
ders. It Is known that the family has
been badly frightened by reports that
armed men have been seen prowling in
the vicinity of the house.
Rockefeller's superintendent, John Red
wood, sent an appeal to New York for
competent detectives. All of the efforts
made to secure the safety of the house
hold did not relieve the overwrought feel
ings of the women, who have been of late
little better than prisoners in their great
mansion, as they have hesitated to leave
it.
Many threats have been made against
Rockefeller at different times and they
have been brought to his attention. A
railroad man who has come into frequent
contact with both father and son said to
day he had informed "William G. Rockefel

LONDON, Sept. 27.â A balloon voyage
from Paris to Hull, a distance of 360
miks, has been made by three French
aeronauts, members of the Aero Club de
France. This is the first time a balloon
has traveled from Paris to England. An
attempt was made in 1SS5 to cross the
channel from France, but the aeronauts
never were heard of afterward.
The party which has now accomplished
the feat consisted of Comte Henri de la
Vaulx, Comte Hadelius d'Outfemont arid
Captain Jules Veger of the regiment of
engineers at Versailles. They set out
from St. Cloud at 6 o'clock last evening.
They crossed the channel near Dover at
1 o'clock this morning, and, keeping to
the east coast, passed over the estuary of
the Thames at 5 o'clock. Rapid progress
was subsequently made, the coast being
kept in sight near Hull. However, the
wind veered round to the west and when
the balloon crossed the Humber, between
Grimsby and Hull, at 11:30 o'clock the
wind waa blowing the aeronauts out to
sea. To escape this danger they made a
descent about six miles from Hull, hav
ing covered the distance of 360 miles in
seventeen hours and forty-five minutes.
The aeronauts were naturally elated at
their feat. They had set out, they said,
with the Intention of traveling as far as
they could, and but for the wind chang
ing near Hull, there was no reason why
they should not have traveled over the
entire length of England. One object of
the voyage was to experiment with the
new arrangement of having a small bal
loon Inside the larger one.

ceived here that both Turkey and Bul
garia are actively preparing for the pos
sibility of war. The correspondent of the

f=killiul disposition of the Turkish troops
for delivering- a Quick blow ccainst either
Servia or Bulgaria. There are 10,000 sol
diers in the vilayet of Kossovo; 70,000
men, with 3jO guns, in Adrianople Vila
yet; 50,000 in Monastir Vilayet and 170,

reaches IIL Reports from other reliable
quarters represent that a much larger
lumber of villages have been destroyed.
The correspondent continues that the
attention of the humane and charitable
should be directed to the starving popu

pared to assist in the distribution of re

Adda to Its Already Immense
Fighting Force in the
When the fire was at its height the ex
plosions began. A considerable amount
of the ammunition belonged to Major Si
rnonds, but the greater portion was in
the cellar, where 13 was deposited in or*
der to ho near at hand for the State shoot
which Company C held to-day.
There was a continuous discharge of
cartridges for half an hour and bullets
were fast shooting into the air, but by
the time they had passed through the
wreckage they had about spent their
force. All the leaden missiles dropped
near the house. Those who had gathered
to view the fire realized the danger when
the shells began to explode and hurried
off to a safe distance. Men who were
removing the furniture and lighting the
flames barely escaped whizzing bullets.
The loss is SoOOO.
It waa by far the most dangerous fire
that has occurred here. Tho firemen gal
lantly battled with the flames, regardless
of the 6000 rounds of ammunition that
.were discharging around them and imper
iling their lives. Fortunately no onÂ© was
injured.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, JiONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1903.
The Mexican custom-house authorities
have been temporarily removed to Lam
pasas, where all Incoming baggage and
freight over the National Railway Is ex
amined, thus permitting trains to run
through to Laredo, Texas, without stop
ping at Nuevo Laredo.
MONTEREY, Mexico. Sept. 27.â Dr. Al
vin G. Alderman, a well-known Ameri
can, founder of the Christian Institute,
died at his home from what is said to be
yellow fever. The authorities ere taking
every precaution to prevent the spread of
the disease. The schools have been
closed. The medical men express the be
lief that the disease will not spread.
TAMPICO, Mexico, Sept. 27.â Five new
cases of yellow fever have appeared here.
The fever Is of a mild form.
The situation in Nuevo Laredo is un
changed. Dr. Mariano Trevino, a Mexi
can Government yellow fever expert, who
is in charge there, believes that within
eight days he will have stamped out the
fever.
Quarantines against Laredo have been
established in all directions and no person
can get beyond the limits of Webb Coun
ty. Other Texas counties have estab
lished a shotgun quarantine and are turn
ing back" ail persons who are endeavoring
to get away In coaches, buggies and carts.
The quarantine applies to all persons,
freight, baggage, express, mall or other
matter originating in the city of Laredo
or points south, the only persons having
authority to leave the corporation limits
being the health officers of the State of
Texas and of the United States.
The work of placing the city in a thor
oughly sanitary condition Is being carried
on under the supervision of Dr. Gulteras
and -a corps of expert assistants.
Laredo presents a dead appearance, all
of those who could get away having de
parted for points north of the State of
Texas and for points south. It !s estimat
ed that nearly 4000 residents have fled
from, here since the scare began.
Dr. Gulteras, in his houss-to-house can
vass to-day, saw many cases of fever and
at the conclusion of his day's examina
tion made tha announcement that twelve
of the cases were genuine yellow fever.
LAREDO, Texas, Sept. 27.--Yellow fever
seems to be on the Increase In this city
despite the rigorous efforts that are be
ing taken to stamp it out. Two deaths

LONDON, Sept. 27.â The uneasiness
concerning the money market both In
London and New Yorkr, resulted in com
plete stagnation last Week on the stock
market, which passed through a week of
unrelieved depression. Renewed realiza
tions, especially of investment stocks,
produced a heavy fall in prices except in
the foreign department, which received
strong support from Paris, where the be
lief prevailed that the talked-of war in
the Balkans would be avoided. The pro
longation of the British cabinet crisis and
the political difficulties in Hungary did
not tend to improve the situation.
Americans and Canadians shared fully in
the general depression, being dominated
by the situation on "Wall street and the
position in the United States Steel shares,
and they showed declines on the week
ranging from $2 to $5.

LONDON, Sept. 27.â The Duke of Rich

house party and the castle was full of
guests when the gravity of his seizure
was announced. Most of the guests left
the castle on Friday and Saturday.
.The deceased was the sixth Duke of
Richmond. He was born on February 27,
1818, and succeeded his father in 1860. He
held at various times the Government

President of \he Council ana Secretary

That Coroner William F. Gormley
should have denied to 'ine Call corre

in fact he had half an hour before pre
sided at an inquest nt which a verdict of
suicide was rendered, has given rise to

CAMP YOUNG, West Point. Ky.. Sept. |
17. â After a day of rest thi various de

in the first of the maneuvers to-morrow.
Colonel Raspopoff. the Russian military ;
attache at Washington, and Lieutenant !
Colonel Foster, representing Great Brit- j
ain at the maneuvers, arrived to-day.
Secretary Tszchi was anxious to ascer
tain from the interviewer what the pub
lic thought of the affair and whether or
not it was believed that Tom Kim Yung
was guilty of the offense charged. He
was surprised to hear that the Chinese
population was divided on that point and
circulars had been distributed in China
town announcing the fact .that Tom Kim
Yung was ordered to commit suicide by
the acting Consul General.
The distinguished member of the diplo
matic corps has been In the diplomatic
service for eight years. He is a native of
Shantung province and graduated with
high honors from the University of Pek
ing In 1S93. It is his intention after in
vestigating the case to take a vacation
of several weeks. He expresses himself
delighted with California climate and
scenery. A reception will be tendered him
during his stay- +n this city by the Six
Companies and the representative mer
cantile organizations of Chinatown.
"According to International etiquette,"
said Secretary Tszchi, "the proper pro
cedure in the case of a member of the
diplomatic corps committing a violation
of the laws would have been to report the
matter to his Minister and allow his Gov
ernment to mete out a punishment com
mensurate with the offense. This rule,
however, only strictly applies to mem
bers of the diplomatic corps and not to
members of the consular service."
PROPER PROCEDURE.
Is understood that Chew Tszchi comes
armed with credentials from the State
Department directing the Federal au
thorities in thi3 city to assist him In every
possible way in his Investigation.
Tszchi was averse to expressing his per
sonal views on the outcome of the affair,
other than to state that if he found that
the arrest was unjustifiable the Chinese
Government would take the matter up
with the Slate Department at Washing
ton.

FATAL ILLNESS
SEIZES A DUKE
Mr. Tszchi stated that the announce
ment of the arrest and suicide of Tom
Kim Yung, military attache of the lega
tion, had caused all of the members of
the legation in Washington much sorrow,
as he was a man of sterling character
and greatly liked by all who knew him.
"It hardly seems possible to a man with
good common sense," said the secretary,
"that Tom Kim Yung, even If the degen
erate the police of this city maintain he
v.*as, would approach a policeman in full
uniform on a well lighted public thor
oughfare, traveled by hundreds of pedes
trians. It was my good fortune to become
acquainted with Tom Kim Yung several
years ago in Peking, and he was a gen
eral favorite with every one. His charac
ter was above reproach. None of those
who knew him intimately can believe the
allegations that have been made."
The representative of the Chinese im
perial Government will begin his investi
gation this morning, and in addition to
reviewing the evidence secured by the Six
Companies," a visit will be paid to Mayor
Schmltz and Chief of Police "Wittman. It
The gentleman who occupies a position
next in rank to the Chinese Minister to
the United States is regarded as one of
the most astute members of the diplo
matic corps in this country, and there is
no doubt that the investigation that he
Is about to make will be thorough and
searching In its nature. Upon his arrival
In this city he was met at the ferry by
members of the consular service and es^
cortcd to the consulate.
Mr. Chew Tszchi was not averse to be- 1
ing interviewed and readily consented to
discuss the mission that brings him to the
city. He ia a man of commanding ap
pearance, and affability and courtesy are
among his chief characteristics. His an
swers to all interrogations are pointed,
and he possesses the factulty of skillfully
parrying any questions the answers to
which might call forth an expression of
personal opinion.
SUICIDE CAUSED SORROW.
WITH the arrival of Chew
Tszchi, first secretary of the
Chinese legation, from Wash
ington, D. C, last evening,
the first chapter of the inves
tigation attendant upon the arrest of Tom
Kira Yung and his subsequent suicide
by the inhalation of illuminating gas is
about to begin, and complications may
result that will hold the boards of the
International stage for some time to come.
Chew Tszchi arrived from Washington
on the overland train last evening fully
empowered by Sir Chentung Liang
Chung, the Chinese Minister, to rigidly
investigate the circumstances surrounding
the arrest of Tom Kim Yung and his
self-destruction. Upon the report of Chew
Tszchi will depend future -developments
in this international affair, which has
caused the Chinese Government and the
State Department much concern.
Dr. Campbell, In an interview with The
Call correspondent to-day, said It was a
clear case of suicide and he had so testi
fied at the Coroner's Inquest. He said
he asked the woman if she had taken
the poison and she nodded affirmatively.
He asked her if she had taken It of her
own volition and she replied in the same
manner that she had. He could not get
her to say whether she had taken the
drug with suicidal intent, but he was
certain such was the case, and he said
upon his evidence such a verdict was re
turned by the Coroner's Jury.' ,
Dr. Campbell showed an envelope con
taining the poison, which he found under
Mrs. MacEwen's pillow. In it remained
a considerable quantity of poison. The
envelope was entirely blank, save for a
notation in Dr. Campbell's handwritingâ
"Found under; Mrs. MacEwen's pillow."
As there is a State law against selling
deadly 'poisons in such quantities, or at
all without a physician's prescription,
and as Mrs. MacEwen .was not being
treated with morphine it is evident some
druggist is guilty of a violation of the
State law, and another â¢ reason appears
why there was an effort to hush up the
case.
Mrs. MacEwen was a highly respected
woman and was very well known to the
older generation of Sacramento people.
"About two weeks ago," said the Mayor,
"Mrs. MacEwen called at my establish
ment and caid she expected to die soon,
as she was afflicted with heart disease.
She asked me what it would cost to give
her a proper burial in the event of her
death, and I gave her different prices for
different kinds of funerals. Ono price
pleased her and she said she would depos
it the amount in a local bank, subject to
my order.
"I thought at the time that the woman
was in a despondent mood and that she
would think no more of the matter when
she recovered from her despondency.
When I heard yesterday that she was in
a dying condition and was told by Dr.
Campbell it was a case of suicide I Im
mediately recalled her visit to my estab
lishment."
A jury was summoned. Dr. Campbell
appeared before It and testified that the
woman had died of poison evidently
taken with suicidal intent, and the verdict
of the Jury was in accordance with this
report. At the Capual Hotel no informa
tion whatever could be obtained, not even
the name of the woman, and It was ap
parent that every effort was being made
to keep the affair a secret.
Mayor Clark was called upon this morn-,
ing and asked for a statement of -his cor*
nection with the mysterious case.
on coma. Under her pillow was found a
blank envelope with enough sulphate of
morphine in it to kill a dozen persons.
To Dr. G. B. Campbell, who attended her,
the .woman admitted that she had taken
the poison. She was removed yesterday
morning to the house of the friend whom
she had first visited and there died about
three hours later.
Coroner Gormley was called in the case
and by friends of the woman asked to
keep the affair out of the newspapers.
Gormley complied with the request, even
to the extent of denying knowledge of
the affair, until he found The Call had
secured the information outside his office.
CALL BUREAU. 1106 G STREET N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Sept. 27.â According
to George M. Bailey, a new3paptr cor
respondent who has Just spent three
weeks in Indian Territory investigating,
the land scandal, the conditions In the j
Choctaw, Chickasha and Creek nations
are as bad as they can bs and the "graft
ing" has already exceeded in proportion
the postoffice scandal. The Indian scan
dals involve the gotfd faith and integrity
of the Government in the administra
tion of an estate of 70,00) helpless per
sons who are wards of the Government.
"In the Choctaw and Chickasha coun
tries the sufferers are white homeseekers
rather than the Indians," said Bailey to
night. "After the passage of the Curtis
act, which provided for the allotment of
lands and the ratification of the Atoka i
agreement and a supplementary treaty,
each Choctaw and Chickasha Indian be
came entitled to 320 acres of average land,
160 acres of which became a homestead
inalienable for twenty years. Tho re
maining 160 acres the Indian was permit
ted to sell," one fourth each year, after
he received his patent, until all of It was
disposed of. Then it was that the whit;
homeseekers from Texas, Arkansas,
Kansas and Missouri began to flock into
the two nations by thousands in order to
be on the ground when the allotments
were made, so as, to secure homes by ac
tiuiring.the alienable lands of Indians. Up
to the present time these whites have
been renting the lands from the Indians,
paying therefor a percentage of the
crops raised. During this period of wait
tng they have endured all manner of
hardships, lived in the merest shacks,
their children have been without school
facilities and they have been preyed upon
by land grafters and Indians alike. They
have suffered too much already and Con
gress should see to it without delay that
they receive better treatment.
"The scandals have reached the highest
development in the Creek nation, for the
reason that the Creek allotments have
been completed. Bradley, of the Bradley
Real Estate Company, informed me that
the so-called 'grafting' of the kind he was
engaged in was the result of the policy of
the Interior Department in making it dif
ficult for Indians to sell their land.
Creek f ullbloods are in a semi-starving
condition and they leased their lands in
order to get money to buy food. If they
had been permitted to sell they could
have paid their debts, purchased nec
essaries and improved their inalienable
hqmesteads.
"There are Indians in the Federal Jail
at Muskogee charged with cattle theft
who were caught in the timber eating the
i raw flesh of a yearling they had killed
because they were pressed by hunger.
These Indians are possessed of $2500 or
; $3000 worth of land and yet they are crim
inals because they could not use their
â¢ property to prevent starvation."

the wages asked, a hitch in the negotia

packers that the butchers increase their
amount of work. Every lodge of butchers
in the country has been asked to vote on
the demand of the packers, and meetings
will be held for the purpose throughout
the country to-morrow. If the vote shall
be unfavorable It Is likely a general strike
will be ordered, affecting more than 50,000

BEDDING, Sept. 27.â Several hundred
Indians and halfbreed Indians employed
In picking fruit at Anderson, twelve miles
south of here, held a dance on the Petty
grove farm a mile from Anderson, last
night, which wound up in the early hours
this morning with two fights. One ended
fatally at once and the other may result
in a fatality.
The Indiana and halfbrecds had been
drinking. The flrst trouble was between
Jeff Lowry. a haubreed Indian of Modoc
County, and Dick Rogers, an Indian of
Big Meadows, Plumas County. Rogers,
who is under arrest, says that he loaned
Lowry a dollar some time ago and failed
to get it back, despite repeated requests.
He says he asked Lowry for It again this
morning at the dance and Lowry. calling
him a vile name, told him never to ask
for the money again, at the same time
pressing a revolver against Rogers'
breast and pulling the trigger. The cart
ridge failed to explode. Rogers says he
stabbed Lowry twice in the abdomen to
save himself. Physicians say one of the
knife wounds may cause death. Lowry
was a partner of Charley Hough, a noto
riously bad Indian cf Modoc County, who
was killed by officers.
The excitement of the stabbing affair
had hardly worn off when the Indian
dancers heard three pistol shots in rapid
succession on the outskirts of the crowd.
They found Joe Henderson, an Indian of
Big Bend, Shasta County, a brother of
Stonewall Jackson, a locally famous In
dian chief of the same locality, dying. He
had been shot through the body, the bul
let touching the heart. Death came in a
few minutes and the Identity of the slay
er has not been, established.
The Indians will talk but little of the
affair, although they say that Henderson
was considered the leader in the move
ment which resulted in the shooting and
beheading of Louie Thomas, an Indian
doctor of Burney Valley in this county,
several months ago.

A local man is seeking divorce on the ground that
his wife compels him to do the family washing. This

Sir Thomas Lipton has sold the Shamrock I and
the Shamrock II. The commercial spirit of Sir
Thomas is evidently too strong for the sentiment
that would make one ding even to an inanimate

their owner something more than that intrinsic value
which attaches to second-hand goods.
DR. W. H. WILEY, chief of the bureau of
chemistry of the Department of Agriculture,
who has just returned from Europe, where
he has been investigating the export of adulterated
or falsely labeled foodstuffs to this country, has man
aged to start a nice little controversy immediately
upon his arrival. In the course of a talk on the sub
ject of wine imports he was reported as saying:
"There are no chateau or vineyard wines shipped to
the United States. , The. Americms drink nothing
but labels." The statement naturally aroused the in
dignation of wine dealers and wine consumers in
New York. Prompt refutation was called for and
was forthcoming, so the conflict began.
OnÂ£ of the leading wine mei. in New York is
quoted as saying: "The American people are not
fools, and they know what they are drinking. At
least 8o per cent of the chateau and imported wines
are genuine. There may be 20 per cent of inferior
and .adulterated wines shipped as chateau and vine
yard. But the drinker of French wines can tell the
difference. Of course a greenhorn may be fooled.
Put a glass of California and French claret before
me, and I can tell the difference by the color. There

If partisan reports be accepted as true, both the

The divorce courts have ever been the stage for

days ago when a local citizen pleaded that an oyster
had come between him and his wife and supplied
just cause for separation. A little further inquiry
might perhaps uncover a clam in the affair.

Cameras and Supplies.
The staples seem to have begun a downward cur
rent of late. Wheat, com, cotton, provisions, live
stock and some minor staples have eased off more or
less in price during the past few days, with quieter
markets. Lumber and building materials of all kinds
are also showing less activity in many parts of the
country. The dry goods market is likewise reported
quieter, though a fair trade is in progress.
Like the merchandise market, speculation emerged
from its hibernation last week, and with Wall street as
the storm center became sensational. For one or two
days prices declined with a sinister persistency that
set the street trembling. On Thursday the market
seemed to have lest its bottom altogether, but on
Friday there was a partial rally. Just what caused
the decline nobody seemed to know, but the wise ones
when questioned shook their sage heads and uttered
that portentous word, "liquidation." It is a con
venient explanation to have in stock, ready for irrime
diate delivery, when one does not know what else to
say. There were plenty of dark forebodings and
rumors to help along the decline, but none of them
were realized. No dark cloud broke over Wall street,
no gigantic failures were announced, no crazed finan
cier put a pistol to his worried head â nothing hap
pened. Whether it was a scare or actual liquidation
it was impossible to say. It might have been the
closing down of the steel mills to curtail production,
and many operators were inclined to this view. Any
how the market went down and was not slow about
it either.
On this coast conditions remain as heretofore. If
business has become less eager and vast in the East
this market has thus far shown little sympathy. True,
the grain markets have gone down during the past
f-w days, but canned and dried fruits, hops, wool,
butter and eggs and beans have either gone up or
pointed toward a rise, so the net balance of the farm
produce, on which we all so largely depend here, re
trmrs about as "before. Real estate continues active
and the stock of money among merchants, banks and
the jrcneri.! public, seems as large and accessible as at
any time during the past five years, so the inference
is natural that no matter what is going on elsewhere
we are, all right.
Another negative feature is the comparatively few
complaints of car shortage, though it must not be
forgotten that the corn and cotton crops are late and
that the railroads have greatly added to their rolling
stock during the past two years. The gain in rail
road earnings thus far in September is 8.7 per cent
over September, 1002. and 17.2 per cent over 1901.
The zenith in these railroad earnings has undoubt
edly been passed, for the volume of trade throughout
the country is not as large as last year, nor is the
demand for all sorts of merchandise so lively and in
sistent for immediate deliveries. In fact announce
ments cf a partial and often complete closing down of
a line of mills or factories are constantly received
from widely distant parts of the country and no more
talk of a scarcity of labor is heard. It is beginning
to be the other way.
The bank clearings of the country decreased last
week 24.9 per cent as compared with the same week
last year, with abont half of the largest cities on the
wrong side of the exhibit. The aggregate clearings
were $l,774.;i7,ooo. The failures were 232, against
207 last year. The city of New York reports notable
quietness in jreneral trade.
TRADE showed more variety last week than for
weeks back. The midsummer lethargy has
bten succeeded by the regular fall movement,
and from now on we may expect less monotony and
more lluctuation.
It must be admitted, however, that the general
tenor of the week was rather negative than other
wise. That merchants are getting cautious and that
the demand for goods is not as sharp as it was a year
Â«*go is shown by the increased ability of the mills and
:actories to make prompt deliveries, whereas for sev
eral years back the buyers have been clamoring for
their goods, often in vain. In other words produc
tion is catching up with consumption. In fact in
some lines it has not only caught up with but actually
passed it. This is especially noticeable in iron and
steel and coal, a number of furnaces and mines having
during the past two or three days announced that
they would hereafter run on diminished time or close
down altogether in order to keep the markets from
getting overstocked. Against this, however, is to be
noted increased activity among the cotton mills and
excellent reports from the footwear factories.
MORE VARiEiY iO TrtADE
It has been the custom of Americans to make short
work of bolters even when they break away in an
open and manly fashion. When the silver question
disturbed the country in 1896 Republicans did not
grant leave of absence even to so honored a states
man as Senator Teller; neither did the Democrats
grant leave of absence to Grover Cleveland. In each
case the bolter was read out of the party. Why should
there be a more lenient dealing' with a man who with
out honesty enough to stand for his convictions tries
to sneak away under pretense of a leave of absence?
There is but one dignified and simple course open
to the advisory council and that is to expel the
traitor. The granting of a leave of absence in a case
of this kind would be to turn politics into a farce.
Ruef is either a Republican or he is not. If he be
not a Republican, if he has been intriguing against
the party all the time he has been holding a place
in the councils of the league and a seat in the con
vention, then he should now be let out by being
kicked out
forward honesty of the American people has required
that a politician either support his party ticket or bolt
it. He has had to take some such honest, above
board course or get out of politics. Ruef hasn't the
honesty or the manliness to do either the one or the
other. He is a member of the Republican League,
t
he has shared in its councils, he was a delegate to
the Republican convention and took part in all its
proceedings. Now he purposes to betray the party,
but with a cunning that surely was engendered in his
gall rather than in his brain he asks to be granted
opportunity to commit the betrayal while enjoying a
leave ,oi absence.
The possibilities of the new trick are numerous.
Why should not the league take into its councils all
the Democratic and the Labor party bosses during
off years, give them a voice in every arrangement
made for the next election, permit them to sit as dele
gates in the nominating convention of the party and
then when the lines are drawn and the campaign and
the canvassing are about to begin graciously grant
them leave of absence to fight the ticket?
If Benedict Arnold had had the gall of Ruef he
might have made his little treason quite safe by
asking Washington for a leave of absence while nego
tiating the surrender of West Point.
SOMETHING new in politics has been fur
nished by the versatile Abe Ruef. Finding
himself insecurely balanced on a slender rope
of his own manufacture stretched across the chasm
that separates the Republican party from the Labor
party, he has had the happy thought of applying to
the Republican League for leave of absence until No
vember 3. His letter is in the hands of officers of
the league and will be considered at a meeting of the
advisory council this evening.
The request embodied in the letter will doubtless
surprise the council. It will certainly present an alto
gether new issue in political tactics and political
morals. In times past the common-sense and straight-

The number of vessels to be laid down during the present
fiscal yaar in tho French navy totals seventy, but fifty of this
number are torpedo-boats and sixteen are destroyers, leav
ing only four fighting ships of heavy class to be built. Of the
latter one is an armored cruiser of the Ernest Renan type,
to be built at Brest. The new cruiser's dimensions are 523
feet 4 inches in length, 71 feet '2 inches breadth; the displace
ment is 13,644 tons; the engines are triple screw, of 36,000 horse
power, to give a speed of 23 knots. The destroyers art- to be
of an Improved Stylet type, of 335 tons and 7200 horsepower,
with a speed of 20 knots. The torpedo-boats are 126 feet 8
inches in length an.d of 26 knots speed.
The French armored cruiser Dupuy de Lome, the first
pea-going naval vessel fitted with triple screws, is to have
her Normand boilers removed and Fox boilers substituted.
It Is claimed that this change will effect a saving in weight
'of 250 tons, which, given to coal, will increase the ship's
crulsnig capacity to 13,000 miles at 10 knot3 speed.
The French Admiralty has abolished the full dress uni
form in the navy except for general officers and high of

to the poorly paid lower grades.
During the recent British naval maneuvers four ships in
the three fleets were equipped with the Cody system of aero
plane or box kites. The kite consists of a bamboo frame,
over which' is stretched a material like silk alpaca. On the
Bachante one kite was sent up as a pilot and another took
up an aerial wire, which was connected with the wireless
telegraphy apparatus en the deck of the ship. The kite was
carried to a height of 300 feet and messages were sent and
received for a distance of 110 miles. The use of the kite pave
a considerable advantage, as the usual distance of ship com
munication is about sixty-five miles.

The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as created by the
recent naval force act provides for the, enrollment of divis

ports. They arc liable to serve anywhere with the under
standing that their services shall not extend beyond home
waters and the Mediterranean. This volunteer force will lie
under the order of the admiral commanding the Coastguard
and Reserve, and will take precedence immediately after the
Royal Naval Reserve. Each division will be under the com
mand of a lieutenant and under him there will be two sub
lieutenants and one midshipman for each of the five com
panies comrjosing the division. A capitation allowance of
5S 75 annually will be granted to each member and additional
premiums, ranging from $7 50 to $20 annually, to such as may
obtain certificates of proficiency in gunnery, engine-room
work, electricity, signaling and telegraphy.

en, but the Secretary nevertheless ordered a court-martial.
The latter acquitted Ensign Wortman and he was condition
ally returned to duty on March 17 last. Secretary Moody'*
review of the case, rendered September 13, is quite lengthy;
It refers to the responsibility resting upon officers, and con
cludes as follows; "After a careful review of all the evidence.
I am of the opinion that the accused failed to exercise tha
care which was required of him: that In giving the order to
open the breech of the gun, under the circumstances which
the evidence proves, he was negligent; that the death of nine
men resulted from his negligence, and that in what he dltl
and failed to do In the premises he was guilty of culpable
inefficiency in the performance of duty. â¢ â¢ â¢ The finding
of the court is disapproved. There is no power to set aside
the verdict of acquittal. â¢ â¢ â¢ Ensign Wortman is hereby
fully restored to duty." The best course for Wortman to
take would be to resign from the service In which his- useful
ness as an officer has ceased.
The "blue book." containing the regulations governing tho
United States navy. Is constantly being changed, so much aa
to make the edition of March 23. 1300. practically obsolil".
Since 1S65 the Navy Department has issued no less than si:c
compilations of navy regulations, namely: 1SC5, 1870. 1*7".
1893, 1Â£96 and 1DCC. That of 1S93 was almost an exact tran
script of the British navy regulations of 1S79 in so far 3 +
related to discipline. It Is almost time for another edition,
as the additional rules and changes made nearly equal the
contents of the 1900 Issue. Our Navy Department might fol
low the plan of the British Admiralty with benefit to tho per
sonnel of our navy, which consists in printing pay tables and
other regulations, differing from those originally establish^
In 1ST9, In the- quarterly published navy list. In our navy the
navy register "is Issued In January and July and the addition
of new laws and regulations made In the Interval would be
much more convenient to the persons interested than tha
present method of intermittent publications on loose sheet*.
The latest changes In the navy regulations amend prior
methods of appointments In the navy and marine corps. Ap
pointments to the lowest grade (ensign) of the line Â«hall be
made from those midshipmen who successfully complete tha
six years' course at the Naval Academy, and there may be
not exceeding twelve promotions during each calendar year
from the boatswains, gunners and .warrant machinists. No
warrant officer over 3a years of age, or who has served Ies3
than six years as a warrant officer, or who Is not recom
mended by the commanding officer under â¢whom he has served,
ehall be appointed an ensign: nor shall such promotion be
made until he shall have passed a competitive examination.
The law of March 3, 1901. provided for the yearly appoint
ment of six warrant officers to the grade of ensign, but thus
far only two gunners, Soule and Martin, have become en
signs from July, 1901; others have tried and failed, becauso
the commanding officers have not recommended their promo
tion. The great majority of Naval Academy graduates op
pose the entry of warrant officers into the line upon thi
ground that such would-be line officers, while they may be
professionally, physically and morally qualified, still lack th->
social attainments requisite in a wardroom officer, and thus
the law becomes Inoperative through the passive, resistance at
the regular line officers. Officers in the marine corps are to
bo selected: First, from four years" midshipmen at thÂ« Naval
Academy as far as practicable; second, from meritorious
non-commissioned officers of the marine corps; third, from
civil life. Appointments from the second and third of the
above classes must, when appointed, be between the ages of
21 and 27 years.

In no event can the acquisition of this public utility
be considered an experiment. From any point of
view it is bound certainly to cause to the city a loss
and therefore an additional burden upon the tax
payers.
What compensation is offered to counterbalance
this certain financial loss? The city does not promise
a better road, as it has based its estimates on the fact
that it can use the present road, converting it from
a cable road to a conduit electric road. This would
be done by any private owner under the franchise.
It does not promise cheaper fares and cannot do so
because upon the basis of the present 5-cent fare the
City Engineer has based all his estimates, and yet
upon such estimates there would be a financial loss.
It cannot promise better service than a private
owner would furnish because such service is not fur
nished in any department of municipal, State or Fed
eral government.
In asking the people to vote for the issue of bonds
for public improvements, such as parks, school
houses, streets, sewers and hospitals, the people are
asked to tax themselves for purposes of exclusively
governmental nature such as must be constructed
and furnished by the public generally or not at all.
In asking the people to vote for bonds to construct
or operate a street railroad the people are asked to
tax themselves for the purpose of enabling the mu
nicipal government to go into a business that pri
vate capital stands ready to undertake and which the
people have no business to undertake in view of the
universal incompetence of government to conduct
any business economically and efficiently. There is
no department of government, municipal, State or
Federal, that could not be more economically and ef
ficiently conducted by private enterprise, and yet the
Government must conduct it. The same reason does
not exist for the Government conducting any enter
prise not governmental in its nature.
"We believe, however, that if all the money pro
posed to be paid into this enterprise is to be lost the
bonds still should be voted for."
This is a c,andid statement and informs the tax
payers of the real nature of the movement for the ac
quisition by the city of public utilities, namely, that
it is a socialistic movement, whereby socialism is to
enter into our form of government and in time drive
out that individualism that has made this country so
powerful and its 'people so prosperous. In other
words the taxpayers are asked to vote to burden
themselves, with a mortgage of upward of a mil
lion dollars, in order that the city may undertake an
enterprise that it is officially informed by its own
expert will cost it a loss of about forty thousand
dollars a year, "and possibly a loss of a million in
all, an enterprise that private capital stands ready
to undertake and pay the city for the privilege.
The advocates of municipal ownership further
say that if the Geary-street road under municipal
management should prove to be a losing venture,
the road with its equipment can be sold in a single
day for more than it can possibly cost.
We would be very much obliged if any one can
show us how this solution of the question can be
accomplished.
Under the charter the Board of Supervisors are
authorized to sell at public auction personal prop
erty unfit or unnecessary for the use of the city and
county. If the city should wish to sell any 61 the
personal property connected with this road, such
as wires, machinery an d cars, f no one is insane
enough to believe that any one would pur
chase second-hand material for as much as its
original cost. No one in even a municipal govern
ment would be guilty of such an absurdity.
After any one had purchased this equipment, such
person could not use it in operating the road until he
had obtained a franchise under the charter. The
charter provisions provide as compensation for
such a franchise the payment of a certain percent
age cf the gross receipts. No other compensation
is authorized. The same result would follow if the
city, instead of selling the equipment, should lease
the rond. In either case it would not be able to
sell that which cost so much money to acquire,
namely, the road itself.
We doubt the power of the Board of Supervisors
to lease the road. The charter provides for leas
ing a street railroad only when the road has re
verted to the city upon the expiration of a franchise.
This would not be that case.
The city, therefore, could neither sell the road
nor lease it. The utmost it could do would be to
grant a franchise to a private corporation to oper
ate it. No private corporation would bid more than
is requisite under the charter, which would be not
to exceed eight or nine thousand dollars a year.
This with taxes would not exceed $20,000 a year.
In the meantime the city would remain liable under
its bonds. It would have to pay annually in interest
and sinking fund about double the sum it would re
ceive. The utmost benefit it could hope for would
be that its receipts would eventually pay the interest
on its bonds. The net result would be that it would
certainly have to raise by taxation the entire cost of
the road.
THE advocates of the municipal ownership of
the Geary-street road have finally been driven
to make the following statement:
FAT ARE THE PROFITS OF CONTRACTORS
IN THE NAVAL YARDS OF GREAT BRITAIN
real chateau and vineyards. They may also be.ob
tained from some grocery firms and big restaurants
that have agents on the other, side."
Perhaps the consumers of French wines in the
East may be comforted by the assurance that they
drink only 20 per cent of falsely labeled wines, but
there will remain a suspicion concerning the char
acter of every bottle of such wine so long as one in
every five is adulterated stuff instead of genuine vin
tage. It is curious, however, to learn that the
bureau of chemistry is finding some difficulty in de
ciding which is spurious and which is genuine. A
report says: "Chemical analysis will not determine
whether a particular consignment of claret has been
given the label of some famous chateau or whether
a Scotch whisky is a blend. After consulting with
experts, including the man in charge of the spirits de
partment of the army and navy stores in London,
Dr. Wiley has determined that the only way in which
false labeling of this character can be guarded
against is by stationing experts attached to the con
sulates at the principal ports from which these Â«'ines"
and liquors are shipped and requiring them to keep
so in touch with the situation as to be able to certify
whether or not the wines or liquors in question are
what the labels describe them as being."
As it stands the controversy is interesting, and it is
to be hoped the people of New. York will have sense
enough to perceive the true moral of the situation
and recognize that the only sure way of getting good
wine and pure wine is to purchase that of California.

BINO WORM AND DANDRUFF.
They Are Each Caused by a Pestif-

Ringworm and dandruff are somewhat
similar in their originâ each Is caused by
a parasite. The germ that causes dandruff
digs to the root of the hair and saps Its
vitality, causing falling hair, and finally
baldness. Without dandruff there would
never be baldness, and to cure dandruff
it is necessary to kill the germ. There has
been no hair preparation that would do
this until the discovery of Newbro's Herp-

Rain was not needed and will result In

being harvested. The bean crop in this
county is estimated at 75.000 sacks, but a
continuance of the rain will materially re
duce this estimate.
SANTA ANA, Sept. 27.â The first rain
of the season fell to-day. Gentle showers
began to fall early this morning and con
tinued throughout the day. The total pre

about .25 inch. Conditions are favorable
for a continuance of the showers to-night.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 27.â After three
days of cloudy, threatening weather the
first rain of the season began to fall here
early this morning and continued through
cut the day. Up to 5 o'clock this evening
the Government Weather Bureau reported
a precipitation o5 .22 inch. Rain contin
ues to-night in gentle showers with no in
dication? of clearing off.
A storm at this time will result in ser
ious damage to the bean crop if clearing
weather does not' immediately follow.
Harvesting of 7000 acres in the Santa Mon
ica district was to have begun Monday,
but the storm will interfere with these
plans and may result in serious damage
to the crop. It Is estimated that more
than IO0.O0U packs will be harvested In the
Santa Monica district. The demand for
California bf-ans is said to be strong in
the East and early rains will greatly in
crease the price. The crop has thus far
sold at 3 to 3 1 * cents per pound. The rain,
if continued, will greatly increase these
figures.
The disturbance appears to be confined
to narrow limits.. Up to a late hour to
night no rain had fallen at San Diego on

The Orpheum was packed to its utmost
capacity at both performances yesterday
and every number on the new programme
was warmly received. Myles McCarthy,
who last appeared in this city as a star in
a drama by Hall Caine, offered a refresh
ing novelty In his skit. "The Race Tout's
Dream." He was ably assisted by Miss
Aida Woolcott. Alexius, programmed
"the great." certainly lives up to his bill
ing. He gives the most extraordinary
single acrobatic bicycle act ever seen in
this city, performing feats of daring and
skill that almost defy belief. Al Carleton
and Willlard Terre offer a singing and
talking act greatly out of the ordinary,
and abounding in genuine fun. Paulo and
Dika, genuine cafe chantant performers,
scored a great hit in their frothy come
dietta, "A French Frappe." Their rendi
tion of up to date jokes in broken Eng
lish was very funny. Charles Ernest, the
black face monologist and parodist, had
an entirely new routine of Ktories and
songs and his turn was an Improvement
on that of last week. Falke and Semon
introduced several new laughs in their
musical comedy work. E. Rousby's beau
tiful electrical novelty, "In Paris," began
its third and last week and Mario and
Aldo continued their wonderful triple

the artress scored a marked success be

One of the largest audiences of the sea
con cathered at the California Theater
last night, jammed It as full as the law
would allow and gloated and roared over
the late Charles A. Hoyt's remarkable
witty, brilliant comedy, "A Texas Steer."
The master satirist, Hoyt. Justly la
mented, never wrote with more ease,
never weaved such delicate, albeit Sting
ing, satire, and it is no doubt a fact,
never paid so much attention to consecu
tive construction as in his rearing of "A
Texas Steer."
That his reappearance in the city Is wel
come to the play-goers was fully demon
strated yesterday afternoon by the ova
tion which was tendered not only himself
and Miss Chapman but every one of the
familiar faces in the company. To a
small group of friends there was especial
interest in the production, occasioned by
the appearance of Miss Mary Gilman, the
stately Stanford beauty, who attracted so
much attention as the star in the "Knight
of the Burning Pestle" some months ago.
All in all, "A Gentleman of France" is a
good type of the somewhat passe roman
tic plays, and will be enjoyed by those
who have a penchant for the stories of
dim, forgotten days of the old icgime.
Bosides the big fight there are seven
scenes of Kings' palaces, midnight es
capes from gloomy castles and awful am
bushes. Two monarchs of old France,
some Dukes and villains various drag
their swords and click their spurs until
when one goes outside of the enchanted
realm and sees the electric cars and po
licemen he feels that life to-day Is not
what it should be. j
This being the first time that "A Gen
tleman of France" has been produced
west of Chicago, Neill has endeavored to
make its appearance noteworthy. This
he has done from the viewpoint of setting
and costumes. The court scenes are re
markable for the beautifully gowned la
dies in waiting and the scenlcal- appoint
ments. For the somewhat meager oppor
tunities for acting which a typical long
cloak-and-rapier play offers, Neill has ad
equately filled the vacancy by an excel
lent mise en scene.
The gods of the gallery grip their seats
and gurgle with delight at the Grand this
week, for there is a glorious fight in "A
Gentleman of France." The genial James
Neill suddenly becomes an avenging fury
and, armed with a glistening . r-r-rapier
and a blodgy dagger, slays six men In
quick succession and rescues the beautiful
heroine from her enemies.
It is upon the staircase of the chateau
of Monsieur de Bruhl. Gaston de Marsac,
with the calcium glittering from his wav
ing steel, stands at the top of the strip of
red Brussels carpet and meets his caitiff
enemies one by one. The first is speared
in the neck and falls over the balustrade
In a heap. A second, with his cloak about
his face, rushes up the stairs and re
ceives the dagger 'neath his fifth rib. The
third is hit on the head with a. stool. Still
they press on. only to fall with sickening
noise upon the gory floor. At last the
curtain goes down with the Steur de Mar
eac leaning on his trusty blade and the
heroine pressing a rapier against the third
jacket button of one of the wounded vil
lains. Tt is great.
The financial account shows that during
the year there was received $85,565 61; the
expenditures were $52,869 93, leaving a bal
ance of $32,695 6S, from which must bc.de
ducted $S8 50 on account of namÂ«j stricken
off the rolls for non-payment of dues,
making a net balance of $32,607 18. Of the
amount expended, $39,380 60 was for the
asylum and $12,22S 04 for tne Old People's
Home.
Mr. Levy paid a glowing tribute to the
memories of the late L.ou:s "G^rstle and

poor form during the morning game. Ha
walked eleven men. Then his support was
something awful. The team made eight
errors behind him. so the Senators had a
pipe all the time. The home team out
hit them, but the best they secured was
four runs for their trouble. The score:

SUMMARY.
Four special rounds were tacked on thÂ©
struggle at Recreation Park yesterday
afternoon. Just as on the previous day.
Strange as It may seem. Uncle and hi j
tossers got away with it- Stranger still.
the score was the same. All Uiese things
combined made some baseball history.
Scoreâ San Francisco 3, Sacramento 1
The morning game was a pie for the
Senators, and they ate It up 9 to i The.
series stood three and three when the
two teams lined up for the decisive battle.
The natives won It, so they finished ahead
on the week, winning four games out of
a total of seven played.
Both Iberg and Knell pitched ball that
was really wonderful. Neither ever wav
; ered. They were well supported except
in the final round, when two errors Io3t
the game for the veteran southpaw Just
when he was beginning to get more ef
fective, If anything.
San Francisco opened up strongly, but
after the first*inning they scored no moid
runs till Lynch rushed home In the thir
teenth. '\'.',i
In the first Meany was passed, and Ir
win responded with a drive | to the score
board for two bases. This set the crowd
going, and when Krug hit to Egan and
Meany beat the throw to the plate their
enthusiasm was beyond control. Then
Zearfoss lined a torrid one direct at Knell,
and while he was hooking It up with his
left nytt and delivering it to the flm bag
Irwin landed with the only runs the home
team made In twelve rounds.
Graham opened hostilities In the fourth
spasm with a drive over first, good for
two bases. While the excitement was still
in full bloom Casey came through with
another of the same caliber to the score
board, and Graham raced to the finish.
The game was practically over and the
crowd was ready to depart in the first
half of the ninth when the Senators sud
denly tied up the result. With one gone,
Truck Egan pasted one at Irwin that
nearly lifted him up bodily. Then Truck
stole second. Bang! went Townsend's bat
against the leather. When the noise had
stilled Egan was home and the score was
a tie.
Then the struggle commenced In real
earnest. It was one fast battle for the
next four rounds. No one seemed to be
equal to the emergency, and the several
chances that offered themselves were
simply passed up.
Finally the tense strain was loosened In
the luckless thirteenth. Lynch opened It
with a drive far out to left field that net
ted him two cushions. Meany laid down
a bunt and Townsend In the mlxup fum
bled it, allowing Lynch to reach third.
All was over then. Charley Irwin sim
ply popped up a little fly to right field.
Lynch bounded home, beating the throw
of McLaughlin by many feet and ending 1
It all then and there.
Charley Graham began to kick at a de.
clsion in the tenth Inning and was put
out of the game. Hogan taking his place
behind the bat. The score:

Among the jockeys now riding Burns
speaks in glowing terms of Odom, who,
he declares, would make a great hit on
the English turf. Fuller is a line natur

O'Neil also has captivated Burns' atten

Fuller, O'Neil and Odom Is that appar
enty they are part of the horse they are
on. This, Burns says, makes them im

ropolitan racegoers welcome the advent
of the fall meeting at Morris Park, -which
will begin to-morrow. There was much
reckless riding at the recent meeting at
Grave-send and the excuse was made that
the circular course was to blame. Large
fields of horses required to run around the
turn at top speed helped to precipitate
accidents and to EUi>ply a plausible de
fense for riders charged with unfair
work. That slate of affairs will not pre*
vail at Morris Park, the Eclipse course ob
viating any crowding. There is but one
turn In any race up to one mile and a

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 27.â Within twen
ty-four hours after ' she had positively
identified a corpse as that of her husband,
Mrs. T. C. Carter of Whlttler was amazed
to see her husband, alive and In the best
of health, walk into the house In which
she is living. Before he reached her the
shock was so great that she fainted and
became hysterical. Her condition is still
serious.
Mrs. Carter came here several weeks
ago from Greenville. Tex., to vUit-frlends
in Whittier. She was accompanied by her
11-year-old' son. Ten days ago the boy
fell off a house and fractured both of his
legg. Tetanus set in and he died within
three days. During the boy's Illness she
telegraphed to her husband, telling him
to come to Whlttler at once. She heard
no more from him until she saw him to
day.
A week ago the body of an unknown
man was found in a lodging-house on
North Main street. Ho had died of heart
disease, and there was nothing on his
person by which his identity could be
discovered. The body was burled In the
Potter's field. Mrs. Carter saw the ac
count of the finding of the body In the
newspapers, and as she could find no
trace of her husband she decided to in
vestigate the identity of the unknown.
She obtained permission from the Coroner
to exhume the body, and went to the cem
etery with &r. undertaker, who removed
the body from the grave. When she saw
it she declared at once that it was that
of her husband. There were certain
marks about the face, she said, which
made her positive. She had the body re
buried and the grave marked, it being
her intention to remove it to Whittier
later. Then she returned home, grieving
over the death of both husband and son.
To-day Carter arrived in Whlttler, and
his wife from the window of her room
saw htm enter the yard. Then she faint
ed. He explained that he had been de
layed en route from Texas because the
conductors would not recognize his trav
eling card as a member of a railroad or
ganization.
The identity of the dead man may never
be discovered.

BOGOTA. Sept. 27.â The . Minister ot
State to-day made public the demands of
the cable company, which asks for a new
concession lasting twenty years and tho
privilege of raising the tariff. Among the
reasons given for the Government's re
fusal of this proposition is that an Italian
company has applied to establish a new
system of wireless telegraphy.
PANAMA, Sept. 27.â It is announced
that the cable service to Buen.% Ventura
will be closed at the end of September.
The Inspector of telegraphs has received
orders from Eogota to close the Central
and South American Company's offices in
this town on the suspension of the ser
vice to Buena Ventura. If the Govern
ment carries out its threat the company
will lose heavily.
The Government in the meantime is
making efforts to establish the Marconi
system of wireless telegraphy between
Panama. Chlriqul, Buena Ventura, Colon.
Bocas del Toro and Cartagena. It ls also
reported that the West Indian and Pan
ama Telegraph Company will offer to con- ,
struct a cable to Buena Ventura.
Colombian Government Refuses to
Grant the Demands of the Tele
graph. Company.
BUENA VENTURA CABT-E
SERVICE TO BE CLOSED
Rev. George W. White, the recently se
lected pastor of the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church, appeared In the pulpit
yesterday morning and gave bis Initial
eermon. The edifice was well filled with
worshipers, and the occasion was In every
way a good augury for tho future career
of the new pastor. He chose for his text
the second and seventeenth verses of the
seventy-third Psalm: "As for me. my feet
had almost slipped and my steps had well
nigh gone â¢ â¢ â¢ until I went Into the
sanctuary of God."
Dr. White ls one of the best known men
In the Methodist church in the State of
California. He was born In Indiana in
1S58, but spent most of his younger life In
Iowa. Ha attended Cornell College, in
Iowa, and entered the ministry In 1SS0.
He came . to Southern California In 1SS*
and served as pastor for the church at
Alhambra, Fallbrook and San Bernardino,
and was made presiding elder of the Loj
Angeles district in 1S02. His brilliant suc
cess in that capacity led the trustees of
the University of Southern California to
elect him president of that institution.
He tired of this work and was chosen' to
tafce charge of the splendid church at
Pomona. He has done a great deal of
Chautauqua work in his ministry, and Is
regarded as highly proficient in letters.
To-morrow evening- a. reception will bo
tendered Dr. and Mrs. White in the par
lors of the church.
Where does Mr. Clarke stand On the "war
amendments"? Docs he believe in them or
will he favor their repeal? 13 he in harmony
with Senator Tillman. who has boasted that
whenever colored voters attempt to exercise
the elective franchise in South Carolina he
will meet the attempt with a shotgun? If
elected to the Senate will Mr. Clarke join his
colleague from Tennessee. Mr. Carmack. and
vote for his resolution to repeal the fifteenth
amendment? Is Mr. Clarke willing to ex
plain his position on these vital questions?
Where does Mr. Clarke stand on the Philip
pine question? Does he stand with I Mr.
Bryan when he is lobbying at the Capitol at
Washington for the ratification of the treaty
that ceded the islands to us? Or. later, when
in the campaign of 19W he advocated an
"American protectorate"? X>r when. still
later, he declared for their "absolute inde
pendence"? Does Mr. Clarke staftd for any
or all three of these propositions? Does Mr.
Clarke side with the Eastern Democrats, the
"reorBanlzers" ?
Democracy to-day wears so many colors, ap
pears under so many different shapes and
forms, assumes bo many illfeuispis that I feel
it would be unfair to Senator Hanna to ask
him to meet Mr. Clarke in a joint debate until
he ls advised more fully as to Mr. Clarke's
position on the subjects above alluded to:
until he learns what particular brand of
Democracy Mr. Clarke claims as his; until he
knows whether he is" expected to debate with
Mr Clarke, the corporation lawyer, or Mr.
Clarke, the candidate for United States Sen
ator.
The Republican State platform declares that
every one of the "war amendments" 13 bind
ing in honor upon every American citizen.
Why did Mr. Clarke say in his Akron speech
that that platform "winds up with a declara
tion that amounts to a nullification of the
fifteenth amendment"?
AS TO THE WAR AMENDMENTS.
Mr. Clarke has all these strings on his bow
and more. too. What chance does Mr.
Hanna who has only one string to his bow,
have, in disputation with such a man? Mr.
Har.na stands pat. When Mr. Clarke joins a
party that stands pat on anything, Mr.
Hanna will talk with him.
Then there is the coinage question. How
does Mr Clarke stand on that?' The abso
lution Mr. Bryan save him would argue that
he ls not a stand-patter: Indeed. Mr. Bryan
says he is' not. Then, if Mr. Clarke is really
on the Kansas City platform and ls bound to
have a. "debate with somebody, let him hunt up
the Palmer and Buckner platform and debate
â¢wiih- that. If on the other hand, he ls still
a gold bug he has no quarrel with Mr. Hanna
on that *core â ex-Senator Charles A. Towne
is the man he is looking for, or the Hon.
John J. I^ents mlpht do in a pinch. If Mr.
Clarke were elected to the Senate, would hÂ«
vote on the currency question with the gold
Democrats or with free silver Democrats?
I regret that candor compels me to say that
I find some rather terlous objections \u25a0 to the
conditions of your proposal. Tii ere ought to
be some separate quality a3 mutuality in a
.'olnt discussion. I fear you have overlooked
that phase of the case. L*t me partlcularfze :
Mr Hanna' s party â¢ has -but on? set of prin
ciple while Mr. Clarke's party has a vast
assortment of principles, sounding the enUre
gamut from doctrine to dogmaâ Democratic,
Popultet Agrarian and Socialistic.
There is the tariff. How dws Mr. Clark*
otand on that ls?ue? His party stands all
over it. In New Kngland it is for free raw
material and for protected flnlsrhed product?:
in Texas it is for protected raw materials
and tor free finished products.
Does Mr. Clarke favor a tariff for revenue
only or a tariff for revenue with incidental
prctectlon? Is he a Gorman tariff Democrat or
a Johnson no-tariff Democrat? If he favors any
kind of a tariff, let him debate with Mr.
Johnson who is an absolute free trader, and
would repeal every tariff and internal revenue
law and sell all the custom-houses.
ONE STRING TO HANNA'S BOW.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Sept. 27.~The reply
of Chairman Dick of the Republican
State Committee to Charles Salen of. the
Democratic State Committee, declin
ing the challenge of John H. Clarke,
Democratic nominee for the United States
Senate, to a Joint debate with Senator M.
A. Hanna, was given out to-night. Chair

Yee Foo was placed under arrest Later
he was positively identified by Detectives
McMahon and others as the man who
ehot and killed Yee Him, and was booked
on the charee cf murder. The police had
been looking for him since the murder,
but he had managed to keep out of their
way.
' Yee Foo, alias Tee Ling, was booked at
the City Prison yesterday morning on a
charge of murder. He Is accused of shoot
ing and killing Yee Him at Washington
ttreet and 'Ross alley about 1 o'clock on
ihe afternoon of April 8, at the time of
the war 'between the Ping Kong tong and
the Suey Dun tong. Yee Foo is a Ping
Kong man and Yee Him belonged to the
ether tcng. It was claimed that Yee Him
had killed a member of the Ping Kong
rong some months previous at the oppo
site corner of Washing-ton street and
Koss alley.
Shortly before 3 o'clock yesterday
morning Lin Doon. a member of the Suey
Dun tong. met Charles P. Schultz, one of
Mrwee's patrolman, in Chinatownâ at Du
pont and "Washington streets â ar.d point
ing to Yee Foo said: "Him kill a man."
Tee Foo immediately took to his heels
end Schultz started in pursuit. He called
upon Yee Foo to stop, but the Chinese
kept on runnlr.s and Schultz fired a shot
over his head to intimidate him. It had
no clTect- Yee Foo turned into Commer
cial street and Schultz fired another shot.
Policeman J. F. Welch was standing on
the corner of Commercial and Kcarny
etrets, and, hearing the shots, ran up
Commercial street aad met Yee Foo.
Welch drew his revolver and covering
Yee Foo. ordered him to throw up his
hands. Yee Foo rut his hand under his
blouse and pulled out a big Coifs revol
ver, but before he cculd use it William
Echwark, a teamfter employed by McNab
& Smitii. gTabbed hold of his hand and
â¢wrenched the weapon from him. It was
loaded in every chamber.
It might be supposed that euch places,
through the indifference of the municipal au
thorities or through the corruption of politics,
might for a time be tolerated, but It is an
unheard of thing that any city by the vote
of its citizens should determine to keep up
euch resorts, and I cannot believe that the
citizens of San Francisco will do so.

part of those who have recently opposed the
Issues of some of the bonds to drop the
whole question and not vote against any of
them. At present, the St. Mary's Square
proposition is becoming the most popular and
this Is chiefly through the influence of the
Catholic clergy of the city.
They have publlcally announced that it is

proposition should be defeated, it would be in

McNab's surrender. The convention will
meet to-night at the Alhambra Theater.
It now rests with Gavin McXab to say
â¢whether there shall bÂ« peace or war in
the Democratic convention. The leaders
of the "Horse and Cart" faction of the
party have submitted their ultimatum to
Mr. McNab, and he must render his de
cision as early as 7 o'clock this evening.
The minority delegates demand the right
to name the County Clerk and to possess
all the patronage of the office in the event
of the election of their candidate. It is
not stipulated, however, that A. W. Wehe
shaJl be named as the candidate for Clerk.
It Is demanded further that the new
County Committee or governing body of
the party shall be selected by Assembly
district delegations on the basis, so far
as representation goes, of one member for
each 100 votes cast for Lane at the last
gubernatorial election, and one member
for each majority fraction of 100 votes.
The third and most important demand is
that the minority shall name four Super
visors without referring the names to the
majority.
British Consul General Courteney "W.
Bennett has not yet decided whether he
will hold an investieation here on the
wrecking of the Gifford. Such investiga
tions are usually held In London by the
British Board of Trade unless a request
to the contrary is received from that body.
In the event of the crew of the Gifford
being forwarded to the port they shipped
from, tho investigation will not be held
here.
The officers and apprentices of the Gif
ford will remain on the beach to guard
the vessel. They have a good stock of
the ship's supplies and fresh provisions
were taken to them yesterday. They
have rigged up a temporary home of sails
and seem to be aulte comforteble.
Captain Michle of the Gifford and his
men were indignant yesterday at the ex
aggerated reports published that a mu
tiny had taken' place when the vessel
ran ashore. The refusal of one sailor to
obey the orders of the captain was mag
nified Into a wholesale mutiny. Captain
Michle Bays that his crew behaved with
strict obedience and promptness, and the
majority of the sailors speak In the high
est terms of their skiDoer.
GUARDING THE SHIP.
The crew of the Gifford, which spent
Saturday night on the beach, was taken
to the Southslde Life-Saving Station yes
terday afternoon. The crew was not al
lowed to enter ..ne city until the men had
been inspected by the Federal Quaran
tine officer. This morning the sailors will
be taken to the Sailors' Home to await
Instructions from the owners in Glasgow,
Scotland as to their ultimate disposi
tion.
A crowd of sightseers visited the wreck
yesterday. Many proceeded by team to
Mussel Rock, while others walked to the
spot where the Gifford is lying, proceeding
from Colma over the hills or along the
beach from the terminus of the electric
car line.
Tugs will be attached to heavy hawsers
fastened to the vessel and they will set to
work at high tide. The water in the Gif
ford will be pumped out at low tide and
the rents in her plates will be patched up.
As the Gifford Is valued at $90,000 and is
insured It will pay the Insurance com
panies to try to save her from destruc
tion.
The 3600 tons of coal in the hold of the
Gifford will be thrown overboard In order
to lighten the vessel. Calculations made
yesterday as to the cost of lightering
the coal showed that it would not pay to
try to save the cargo. The value of the
coal Is estimated at $18,000.
When the Gifford is relieved of her
cargo, which will probably be in five or
six days, the attempt will be made to
pull her off the beach.
COAL GOES OVERBOAKD.
A possibility still exists that the British
bark Gifford, which went ashore at Mus
sel Rock last Friday night, may be pulled
off from the spot where she is now lying:.
Yesterday the wrecked vessel was care
fully inspected by Captain John Metcalfe,
the local surveyor for Lloyds, which fa
mous organization represents the Insur
ance companies in which the Gifford is
Insured.
Captain David Michle of the Gifford
and some of his officers were also pres
ent at the examination of the vessel. It
was found that the bark had made ten
feet of water in the thirty hours she had
been ashore, but this dm not dissipate
the hope of saving her.
Captain Metcalfe will personally super
intend the work of trying to save the Gif
ford. Contracts will be entered into this
morning with a firm of wreckers and
other persons whose assistance will be
required in the attempt to get the Gif
ford off Mussel Rock.
Tha first work to be done will be to
fasten anchors to the bark In order to
prevent her from drifting farther inshore
and from pounding on the rocky bottom
on whlcn she rests.
