At the caucus of the Republican Sena
tors to-morrow a resolution will be of
fered declaring that the Committee on

and that the chairman should be a Re

which case the Committee on Commit
tees when it reports will provide that a
Republican Senator shall succeed Senator
Morgan. It is supposed that Senator
Hanna will be named for the place.
The Democratic steering committee of
the Senate was In session for two hours
to-day, the greater portion of which time
was devoted to the consideration of the
situation on the isthmus. The situation
was discussed in all its aspects, especial
attention being given to the allegations
that this country bad been Instrumental
in producing the revolt at Panama and
Colon. A number of Senators expressed
the opinion that the administration had
not been unfriendly to nor ignorant of the
movement from ita beginning, but it was
decided to wait until there waa further
light on the question before advising the
Democrats to take a position on the sub
ject as a party. Some Senators expressed
the opinion that the' mass of the peoplo
were eo anxious to secure a canal that
many people would even Indorse a revo
lution on the isthmus If It should prove
a means of securing one. Senator Mor
gan waa before the committee for quite
a time and advocated a vigorous policy of
criticism.
WILL^OPPOSE RECIPROCITY.
The steering committee also discussed
- lamation â¢ - of President
Roosevelt for the enacting of legislation
necessary - to make effective the Cuban
reciprocity treaty. Organization waa per
fected and everything put Into readiness

The House assembled the largest mem
bership in its history, and the scene be

of animation, both on the floor, in the
cloak-rooms and in the lobbies and corri
dors. The day was crisp and bright ami
the Capitol building presented the appear
ance of a new structure with its coat of
white paint and complete renovation
within.
Many handsome floral tributes to mem
bers were borne in unusual profusion to
the lobbies back of both the Senate and
House chambers to be placed later on tha
desks of the members. , The new members
of the House received their Initiation to
doorkeepers and House employes, and
many were turned back for Identification
because of their slight hesitation on pre

Incidents contributed to the general lively

WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.-The
Fifty-eighth Congress con

session at noon to-day in

There was an Informal dinner to-night
at the house of Mrs. Ogden Goelet for
the bridal party." Robert Goelei will give
a dinner for the bridesmaids and ushers
to-morrow night.
Though the Duke and his bride will go
to Newport to spend a few days in the
unusual qu!et Into which' the great
watering place-"falls at this season the
real honeymoon will . be . passed on the
Duke's estate in Scotland.
The Duke of Roxburghe took luncheon
at Sherry's before the rehearsal, there
being also in the party Lady Isabel Innes-
Ker, Captain <Ward and Mrs. Cornelius
Vanderbilt Jr.
The rehearsal lasted fifty minutes,
after which the party remained a short
while to observe tue floral decorators at
work. With the rehearsal arrangements
for the marriace completed there will be
no change from the plans already an
nounced.
NO CHANGE IN PLANS.
The bridesmaids will lead the pro
cession up the aisle and follow the bride
and bridegroom in the recessional. Rob
ert Goelet will give his sister away. Â¦
During the rehearsal Rev. Dr. Ernest
M. Stlres, rector of the church, was in
the chancel. Will McFarland' presided, at
the and Mesdames Goelet and
Vanderbilt acted as critics, although the
rehearsal went so smoothly - that their
duties were not arduous. The vested
choir, which will take part in :ne cere
mony, was not present, but rehearsed
later. The ushers did not join in either
processional or recessional, .but ap
proached by the side aisles and took seats
In the front pews. . .
The rehearsal waa appointed for 4 o'clock
when Â£he florists suspended work to give
the wedding party an opportunity. The
Duke left the Goelet residence at twenty
minutes to 4, the future Duchess at 4.
Miss Goelet was several minutes late. She
wore a gown of black, the somberness of
v.hich was relieved only by the gray of
a rich plume In her hat.
NO CAUSE FOR CRITICISM.
May Goelet will become the
Duchess of Roxburghe. Incidental to Hie
arrival* at the church the Duke showed
himself to be Quite clever aÂ». avoiding an
army of photographers, for. while they
av/aited him at . all principal entrances
he slipped in by the chapel door quite un
seen. Miss Goelet was not so fortunate,
for, though she tripped nurrledly from
her carriage to the church door, she was
unable to elude the lenses of men and
women with cameras.

On the Pacific coast of Colqmbia Buena
Ventura would be an excellent coaling
station 'site, especially if Germany car
ries out her reported intention to place a
fleet in the. South Pacific.
Cartagena, several hundred miles from
the Isthmus, is, however, an important
strategic point. Germany's strength in
a Caribbean naval campaign would be
greatly improved by a station there. â¢
Sa vanilla and Cispata are ports nearer
the isthmus, which, however, .would be
difficult to. fortify and of less strategic
value.
"Our Inquiries would go to Colombia.
Under ordinary circumstances before ne
gotiating any such concessions with a
European pqwer Colombia would first
consult the American Government. What
she will do now, in view of the present
situation on the isthmus, should Germany
seek coaling stations Is a matter of
doubt."
POBTS GERMANY WOTJXD XIKE.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â Members- of
Congress who were told to-night of re
ports emanating from Arturo de Brigard,
Consul General of Colombia at New York,
and other sources, that Germany might
negotiate with Colombia for coaling sta
tions on both sides of the isthmus and
near the dividing line between Colombia
and the new republic of Panama, at first
expressed doubts as. to Its authenticity,
but afterward guardedly admitted the
probability that such might be the out
come of the present situation. It seems
to be the general opinion In Congress
that Colombia would be willing to make
any trouble for the United States possi
ble, arid that she probably would think a
deal of this kind with Germany would be
particularly aggravating to this country.
It Is also believed by Congressmen fa
miliar with South American affairs that
Germany sooner or later desires to thor
oughly test the Monroe doctrine and that
acquisitions of coaling stations near each
end of the proposed canal would afford
this opportunity. Should the report prove
true and negotiations for such coaling
stations be complete this country would
not hesitate, according to opinions ex
pressed to-day, to enforce the Monroe
doctrine if any permanent lease or con
trol of Colombian territory were given to
Germany.
REPORT CAUSES SOME CONCERN.
It is useless to deny that the report
that Colombia contemplates such a thing
has given some concern to Washington.
One effect, should this prove to be true,
will be that Democrats and Republicans
would line â¢ up In support of President
Roosevelt in his Isthmian policy. Repre
sentative Hltt, who will succeed himself
as -chairman of the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, in speaking of this phase
of the isthmian attitude to-night said:
"Should It be true that Germany and
Colombia contemplate negotiation for
coaling stations It would be a matter of
serious Interest to this country. Should
anything like sovereignty or permanent
contfol be given to Germany for coaling
stations, with the consequent probability
of erecting defenses, it would be a shaft
aimed directly at the Monroe doctrine,
and this country would immediately be
come concerned..
COLOMBIA IS VINDICTIVE.
NEW YORK, Nov. 0.â That Colombia
may turn for aid to Germany, which will
be asked to protect the South American
republic from assaults of Us enemies,
was the remarkable statement made by
Arturo de Brlgard, Consul General of Co
lombia, In this city 'to-day. Â»
"From an unofficial sourc<9 I have
learned that the people at Bogota are to
send a commission to Emperor William to
ask that Germany establish a protector
ate over Colombia. My country Is to cede
valuable territory adjpfning Panama in
returru I have endeavored thiW afternoon
to communicate Â¦with Bogota, in order to
confirm this, but the telegraph company
Informs me that as yet there is an inter
ruption and messages cannot be sent
through to the capital.
"I fully realize how serious such a step
would be, but it is a rumor that so far I
have been unable to contradict."
Brigard does not believe that there has
been any massacre of. Americans a{ Bo
gota, or any Injury to Americans or their
property. He has- received no' advices
from the capital Bince the conflict at
Panama. '

Herbert, so that for all time to come it

and serious wars, bringing anxiety to
every court in Europe. It was impos
sible, said the Premier, that a disease of
such long standing could be instantane
ously cured, but he was convinced that
the question must be ultimately settled by
the concert of Europe, which could not
more effectively carry out its designs than
through the medium of those powers
Russia and Austria, which had under
taken to deal with the situation.
In proposing the toast of "His Ma
jesty's Ministers" the Lord Mayor paid
a graceful tribute to the late Lord Salis
bury. Premier Balfour prefaced his
speech in reply to the toast with a
lrngthy and touching reference to the life
and work of his distinguished predeces
sor. Addressing himself to the current
topic. Balfour said he would carefully
avoid referring to party politics and
would endeavor not to even touch the
fringe of the fiscal question.
Concerning the situation in the Far
Eatt, Balfour said there was every rea
son to feel sanguine that it would have no
serious outcome. He based this assurance
on the passionate j desire of the Czar of
Russia to promote the general peace and
on the fact that Japan as the ally of
Great Britain would be certain to display
moderation, discretion and judgment in
its demands, as well as firmness In en
forcing them.
LORD MAYOR'S TOAST.
The new Lord Mayor, James Richie,
gave a banquet to 100 persons in the his
toric Guildhall to-night in honor of the
King's birthday. Premier Balfour was

rough, the former Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, C. T. Richie, brother of the
Lord Mayor, and others.
Before the banquet the Lord and Lady
Mayoress held a reception, at which Mr.
Choate, the. first prominent personage- to
arrive, was enthusiastically received.
After the banquet the Lord Mayor

and then proposed the health of the
King, from whom he read a message of
congratulation.
A toast to the Queen followed. The
other toasts Included "The Na\-al and
Military Forces of the Empire," which
was responded to by Lord Selbourne, First
Lord of the Admiralty, and Lieutenant
General Lord Francis Grenfell. Mr. Bal
four replied to the toast of "His Majesty's
Ministers," and Mr. Choate replied \o
"The Foreign Ministers."

The reported appointment by Colombia
of General Reyes as peace commissioner
to the republic of Panama :s viewed with
some Interest by th& officials here, as in
accord with the suggestion to the Colom
bian Government contained In the dis
patch to Minister Beaupre recommending
the peaceful and equitable settlement of
all Guestloi\s at issue between Colombia
and Panama. ThÂ« United States, it Is
paid, will lend its good offices to bring
about a meeting of General Reyes and
the Panama officials and will do every
thing in its power to hasten a satisfactory
adjustment of the questions brought for
ward as a result of the recent develop
ments on the isthmus.
Herran, the Colombian Charge, said to
night that he was still without any ad
vices from his Government, although he
keeps the officials at Bogota # promptly
advised of everything that is transpiring.
As yet he has not received any reply to
his protest against the attitude of the
United States Government Â«n Isthmian
affairs.
It was made very plain that the United
States does not intend to and will not
annex Panama, nor .dominate by force,
but that it Is open to and anxious for
the negotiation of a treaty providing for
an Isthmian waterway.
That something along this line was
done, it is said, was admitted by an of
ficial, but the intimation had heen con
veyed In reply that the time for Inter
position of this character nad passed and
that the United States could not consider
such an offer.
It is intimated that nothing is likely to
be done at present In regard to the Co
lombian protest. The apparent Inability
of the Colombians to realize the fact that
the canal treaty is dead and that the rev
olution is a success is shown by the fact
that a cable message was received to-day
at the State Department from Minister
Beaupre, dated at Bogota,' November 6,
in which the Minister reported that a
great change of feeling had come about
In Bogota and that the advocates of the
canal treaty with the United States were
growing greatly in strength.
The State Department has been inform
ed by an agent of the Panama Canal
Company that the provisional govern
ment of Panama has designated a com
mission of three members, one of whom
is Frederico Boyd, a member of the junta.
who will leave Panama to-morrow for
Washington to begin the immediate nego
tiation of a new canal treaty. The com
mission, it is said, is clothed with full
power to conclude that instrument.
Reports were current to-night to the
effect that an effort was being made
whereby negotiations for a Panama canal
treaty might yet be resumed with Colom
bia, notwithstanding the defection of the
department of Panama and tho establish
ment of an independent government there.
These had as their basis the restoration
by the United States of the status of the
isthmus as it existed ten days ago, fol
lowing which Colombia would immediately
take up the question of a canal treaty,
effecting a speedy ratification of such a
convention. It was said that unofficial
representations . of this tenor had come
from an outside nation which is vitally
Interested In the question and that an
official of the State Department hud been
approached on the subject.
ADVANCES COME TOO LATE.
BOGOTA STILL SLEEPING.
Secretary Hay, during a call at the
White House to-day, placed in the hands
of the President the Colombian protest
against the course pursued by the Wash
ington Government on the isthmus and
Its attitude toward the new government
of Panama. The protest came to Secre
tary Hay from Dr. Thomas Herran, the
Colombian Charge, and was duly acknowl
edged In a brief formal note.
The protest is short and to the point.
It follows the usual lines of oral com
munications of this kind. In view of the
authorized announcement by the Colom
bian Charge that he has not been in com
munication with his Government since
November 2, it is presumed that he pro
tested on his own responsibility. What
action will be taken regarding the pro
test probably will be decided on at a con
ference between the President and Sec
retary Hay.
No cablegrams reached the State or
Navy Department over night from isth
mian lands or waters, nor has the State
Department heard from Bogota since ca
bling to the American legation there for
presentation to the Colombian Govern
ment an announcement of the action of
the United States in recognizing the de
facto" government of Panama.
PROTEST OF COLOMBIA
for the isthmus will not be
permitted by the Washington Govern
ment, and American warships will be or
dered to any port on receipt of an inti
mation that Colombian troops will at
tempt to sail for the isthmus. The Wash
ington Government holds that this policy
is in the Interest of the general good.
Secretaries Root and Hay had a con
ference to-day, presumably in regard to
the latest developments in the isthmian
affair. As he was returning to his home
Secretary Root was asked the direct ques
tion as to whether United States forces
would be ordered to the isthmus of Pa
nama. He replied that while such a thing
was possible It was extremely improb
able. He added that he had made that
answer to a similar question in New
York yc-Eterdaj*. when he really knew
very little about the situation, and he
made it now for the reason that he knew
nothing more of an intention to employ
troops on the Isthmus.

Special Correspondence of The Call
- HONOLULU, Nov. 3.â The- appointment
of S. B. Dole as United States District
Judge to succeed the late M. M. Estee
and that of George R. Carter as Governor
"to succeed Dole are the subject of resolu
tions of protest adopted by the Home
Rule party at a campaign meeting. In
the Home Rule press the appointments
are vigorously opposed. The Evening
Bulletin, Republican, Tefers to the ap
pointment of Dole as an Insult to the
memory -of the late Judge and disap
proves the Carter appointment- The Star
and Advertiser, Republican, both approve
the President's selections.
Governor Dole, as commander in chief
of the National Guard of Hawaii, bade
the troops farewell. October 31, at the
drill shed, delivering anÂ»address teeming
with patriotism, coupled with regrets
that the long years In which he had been
so closely allied to the military arm of
the Hawaiian Government had at last
come to a close. The Governor said:
The present "and future of Hawaii form, one
subject. The past, present and future are one
subject, because they are so intimately con
nected that one can hardly be spoken of with
out callinc upon the other. The evil things
in politics or in social life are the fruits of
what people have planted in the' past, or of
what they have neglected to do in past gen
erations. I speak of this because It is my
privilege to speak of Hawaii's future, and I
want to impress upon you the fact that the
future of Hawaii depend*, more than anything
else, upon the attitude of the present genera
tion.
If Hawaii in the fnture. Is to be a country
to be respected. It will largely be because
the men of the young jreneration do their duty.
I want you to feel this responsibility so that
the next generation will not lie back and
blame the men of this generation because they
planted seed which'- produced bad fruit. This
Is a small community compared to other po
litical communities of the United States. Take
Greater New York, for instance, and con
sider how little one vote in million* counts
for responsibility. But In Hawaii with one
vote a man's responsibility means something.
To-day we are a Territory, which is a good
thing. We have the privileges of self-govern
ment to a certain extent â as illustrated In the
Territorial Governmentâ but I want you to un
derstand that thin Territorial Government is
temporary. It Is a test of our citizenship. It
is a privilege given to us so we may get an
understanding of the principles of American
representative government. The future of lla
wail nel ought to be a State Government. That
Is something for us to work for.
Train Engineer Finds a Body.
REDDING, Nov. 9.â The engineer of the
second section of the California express
found the mutilated remains of an un
known man on the railroad track near
Shasta Springs last night. It is presumed
that the man was struck and run over
by the first section of the train. The body
was taken to Dunsmulr, where an inquest
will be held.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
ASTORIA,. Or., Nov. 9.â The British
bark Dunslaw, which sailed from Astoria
last Tuesday for South Africa with a
cargo of wheat and was reported in dis
tress off Grays Harbor, was towed back
here last night and is now' Bafely an
chored In tha lower harbor.
Her master. Captain Nichols, tells of a
storm of hurricane force, during which
the vessel laid over to her main hatch for
forty-eight hours, while the chartroom
was flooded, the crew mutinied, the cargo
shifted, the new lower sails blew to piece*
and one good sailor was washed over
board.
Captain Nichols Bays his mate tola ntm
before sailing that the crew was Incom
petent, but that there were some good
men among them and he felt safe in going
to sea with them. Three hours after dis
charging the pilot the glass showed evi
dence of a storm and the Dunslaw was
cut down to lower topsails. That night
a terrific gale sprang up. Captain Nich.
ols says he never saw one like It before.
The sails, which were new. were carried
away because the majority of the crew
were incompetent to do their work. As
the vessel laid over to the storm her
cargo shifted, and for forty-eight hours
she was over to starboard, with her
hatches under water. The tarpaulins over
them were washed off.
In this emergency the crew mutinied,
refused to obey the orders of the officers
and demanded that the masts be cut
away to right the ship. Captain Nichols
gave the spokesman of the mutineers a
punch on the jaw that knocked him out
and ordered the few sailors on board to
assist him In saving themselves and the
vessel. t "',, â__,
A sf.im.Tn. John Hansen," who signed
with the vessel at Portland, as all the
crew did, was faithful. While the others
were scared he obeyed all orders, and
about 1 o'clock on Thursday morning,
while on the topgallant forecastle, was
washed overboard and drowned. It Is
now learned that the man had signed un
der a fictitious name. He was Julius An
derson of Hamburg, who left his wife in
Portland for some reason not known.
After the storm had abated the ..vessel
was righted sufficiently to make sail.
Then the crew mutinied again and de
manded that the vessel be taken hack to
the Columbia, but Captain Nichols had
previously decided to do this.

- Five dollars in gold, which last week
was worth $12 20 in local currency, has
a value to-day of only $11. THany per
sons will no doubt lose heavily, while It
is probable that others will make com
fortable fortunes. A further drop in lo
cal exchange is expected.
The nev$ Government is desirous of
establishing its currency on a gold basis,
abolishing monopolies and gambling sa
loons, and of making other radical Im
provements.
Dr. Manuel Amador, Minister of Fi
nance, and Frederico Boyd. a member of
the Junta, have been. appointed by the
provisional government a . committee to
go to Washington and arrange with the
United States for canal and other neces
sary treaties. They will sail to-morrow
on the steamer City of Washington. It
is said that the Commissioners will en
deavor to have amendments made to ar
ticle 8 'of the Hay-Herran canal treaty,
and to eliminate article 12, in order that
the entire territory of the republic may
be made free to the commerce of the
world, to which the commissariat stipu
lations of article 12 are considered" as
prejudicial.
An address was officially presented to
night by the Consuls of France, Great
Britain and Germany to United' States
Consul Oscar Malmros, expressing sin
cere sentiments of gratitude for the pro
tection that the Consuls and their coun
trymen received on the 4th and 5th of
November, when the lives and property of
all foreign residents in Colon were in the
greatest peril and were safeguarded only
through the energetic action, coolness and
devotion of the United States citizens,
both civil and military.
In the address special mention Is made
of Consul Malmros. Commander Hubbard
of the Nashville, Executive Officer Wlt
zel and the men of the Nashville, Colo
nel Shaler, Superintendent of the Panama
Railroad, and" Colonel Black and Colonel
Brooks of the United States Engineer
Corps. The last named two came down
from Cvftebra and volunteered to help In
the defense of Colon.
Great satisfaction is expressed at this
official recognition by the Consuls.
Charles M. Pepper, Pan-American Rail
way Commissioner, has arrived on the
isthmus on his way to Costa Rica. He
says his mission in the South American
countries has been highly successful.

Panama ftkgent^s Letter Brings Cut-
tinp Remark From Senator.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.-PhlIippe Va
rllla, the envoy of the new Republic of
Panama, to-day sent the following letter
to Senator.Morgan of Alabama:
REPUBLIC OP PANAMA, Nov. $>/lO<tt.â
John T. Morgan. United States Senator, Wash
ingtonâMr. Senator: As a champion of the
completion of a canal across the American
Isthmus, as the minister plenipotentiary of the
new republic, the life of which has sprung
from an expression of the ardent desire of
turning into a reality the dream of two coun
tries. 1 feel myself bound to express to you
my admiration for the display of indomitable
will you have shown in the service of this
noble conception.
The fact that we have fought, both with
th e energies of our souls, for a common ideal,
is not lessened by the minor fact of defend
ing different solutions.
If 1 have not been on the same side as you,
allow me, Mr. Morcan. re gay that It Is sim
ply because I enfered Into the Held of active
life about one-third of a century after you.
The solution which was the,' better one fifty
years ago. ; when there was>caree!y any ship
drawing more than seventeen feet or water,
has gradually seen Its superiority vanish and
transform Itself Into a deep Inferiority, ac
cordinsr to the constant Increase of the draft
and length of ships. These gradual and
scarcely noticeable changes In the necessities
of the waterways are accountable for the dif
ferences of opinion between you, the champion
of the solution of the middle of the nineteenth
century, 'and the champions of the solution of
the beginning of the twentieth. ' Â¦
Now, Mr. Senator, I come to you and most
respectfully entreat you to take the high place
which is due to the. honored veteran of the
noblest fight .that ever took place for the wel
fare of mankind.
I beg you not to throw away the titfe which
the, thankfulness of humanity owes you. that
of the father of the Isthmian canal; I beg
you to take the laurels of a victory which Is
yours, by accepting with a K^nerous and Chris
tian mind what the necessities of ocean travel
have made Inevitable.
You will well crown a noble life. Inspired
by the greatest, the most patriotic, the most
disinterested aim.
I am, Mr. Senator, most respectfully.
P. BUNAU-VAUILi.A.
Senator Morgan to-day admitted that
he had received a letter from Bunau-Va
rilla, and. in reference to the communica
tion, said:
I have not read the letter In public, and
the fact that It was written came from another
source. The letter' was signed by Mr. Varilla,
who professes to be -the minister plenipoten
tiary of the republic. The writer made me a
flattering proposal to get Into line by support
inr the new republic, but when I take advice
It will come from another source and not from
a Frenchman.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Come men buy shoes because' they
like the style. Wear, price, even
comfort, are of less importance.
Now, it is a fact, susceptible to
ocular proof, that there is more distinctive style in Regal
Shoes than in any other shoes. The most expensive cus-
tom shoe makers in New York, Boston, and London are
making shoes for us all the time. These go to our factory
and serve as models. We do not slavishly follow them
â we have ideas of our own, many of which the swell
custom man is glad to adopt for his own trade. We
spend time, and money, and energy, to get the latest limit
in style. :
We make 149 styles to suit all tastes, and we serve
equally well the man who wants the "latest" and the
conservative man who asks for the same shoe year after
year.

No definite conclusion was reached, the
understanding being that a further and

left the White House he declined to dis

Senator Hanna arrived he was
greeted with cheers, which Increased to
thunderous applause as he was followed a
moment later by Senator Gorman, and
the two shook hands cordially.
The Senate was called to order at noon
and after prayer by Rev. F. J. Prettyman
of Washington, the formal proclamation
calling the Congress in extraordinary ses
sion was read. At the roll call seventy
Senators answered and President Pro
Tern. Frye declared a quorum present.
Hoar and Gorman were appointed to
inform the President that Congress had
organized and was ready to receive any
communication he had to make.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â With the gal
leries crowded, with the chamber a mass
of elaborate floral tributes and with near
ly every Senator In his seat, the gavel of
President Pro Tern. Frye sounded at noon
to-day, calling the Senate together in the
second extraordinary session of the Fifty
eighth Congress. The special session of
the Senate, following the adjournment
last spring of the Fifty-seventh. Congress,
eliminated much of the routine work
which otherwise would have been per
formed to-day. New Senators had gone
through the formality of taking oaths of
office, seats had been assigned, and, with
the exception of appointments to some
vacancies, all functions of the organiza
tion had been completed.
More than two hours before the Senate
was called to order the galleries were fill
ing with early arrivals. Senator Hanna's
pronounced victory in the Ohio .election
won for him what was one of the -most
pretentious floral designs ever seen in the
Senate, a shield. *3^x4VÂ£ feet In dimen
sions, of blue Immortelles, In which was
wrought out of California grasses, ribbons
and red, white and blue Immortelles, the
design of the American eagle identical
with that on a silver quarter of a dollar.
The shield was surmounted with a [ gor
geous cluster of American Beauty roses.
The offering bore the inscription.
Senator Mark Hanna. from his friends, "The
Irish Democrats" of Cleveland.
Fully a score of smaller tributes were
banked around Senator Hanna's desk.
Senator Gorman's triumph In the Mary
land election was recognized by the
largest floral piece, a handsome wreath,
more than two feet in diameter, with a
crossed cluster of roses, carnations and
chrysanthemums as the base. Chrysan

there was hardly a desk that did not
carry one or more huge bunches of these
flowera.

Williams of Mississippi said the minor
ity should have a larger representation
on' the committees than now provided,
saying that when their rf presentation was
reduced it was explained to have been
due to the fact that the Democratic mem

said, it has been increased and he hoped
the majority would grant the request.

members were then sworn In by Cannon.
Following this a resolution was adopted

By resolution the Speaker appointed a

Another resolution was adopted ap

When the vote for Speaker was taken
it was found that Cannon had received
193 votes and Williams 166, Cannon being
decrared duly elected as Speaker of the
House. Williams of Mississippi and
Grcsvenor of Ohio were appointed a com
mittee to notify Cannon of his election
and to cfcort him to the Speaker's chair.
As Cannon entered with Williams and
Grosvenor. members on both sides arose
and joined in the ovation to the newly
elected Speaker. Williams Introduced
Cannon, saying:
The drawing of seats, in which old and
new members alike take deep concern,
occupied a great portion of the day's ses
sion. A pretty compliment was paid to
the leaders and veterans of both sides,
they being permitted to select their seats
without drawing lots.
To-day's session was full of Interest to
the spectator^ likewise to the new mem
ber, but to the veteran it was but a
routine proceeding. Long before noon,
when the gavel, fell, the galleries were
filled, the ladies being largely in the ma
jority. Among the spectators were public
officers, diplomats and a great many out
of town visitors.

Alexander McDowell called the House to

Professor Johannes Orth, the famous
cancer specialist, who succeeded the late
Professor Stlrchow in the chair of patho
logical anatomy at the University of Ber
lin, says:
I authorize you to declare as explicitly as
possible that not the slightest suspicion of any
dangerous formation exists. It is a matter ex
plained in any ordinary laryngological book.
With persons who, like the Emperor, are com
pelled by their professional duties to apeak
often In public there are often formations on
the vocal chords which we call pollypia. They
are. of course, a hindrance to the voice and
accordingly these excretions were removed. As
for the rest, I am unacquainted with the clini
cal side of the case, but I believe I am war
ranted In sayins that the Emperor In eight
days will again have full possession of his vo-
cal jxmers
second place, and his bill is No. 2.
A bill giving Congress the right to reg
ulate the trusts was Introduced by Pal
mer (R.) of Pennsylvania. Slbley (R.) of
Pennsylvania introduced a bill to increase
the pay of rural free delivery carriers.
Greene (R.) of Massachusetts introduced
a bill to Induce favorable employment of
American ships.
The Emperor felt the excrescence in his
throat before the Wiesbaden meeting, but
decided to postpone the operation until
after seeing the Czar, out ot deference
to the latter and because he had no other
time. Persons near the Emperor say he
did not display the slightest nervousness
preceding or during the ordeal.
The Emperor Informed his physicians
that he. was opposed to any attempt to
disguise" the character of his ailment and
gave them stringent orders to inform him
fully of Its nature and to make public
their conclusions, asserting that the peo
ple had the right to know the condition
of their ruler. The promptness' with
which Professor Orth's analysis was pub
lished did much to allay public concern.
Dr. Moritz Schmidt of Frankfort-on-.
the-Maln, who removed the polypus, has,
performed thousands of similar opera
tions. The Emperor has known Dr.
Schmidt Intimately ever .since the time
when, as Crown Prince, he went to San
Remo to see his father and took Dr.
Schmidt on the same car with him. It
was therefore the Emperor's own desire
to Intrust him with the operation.
The operation lasted only a minute or
two.
The story of the day concerning the Em
peror is not the story of the bulletins, of
the telegrams from foreign sovereigns nor
of the sympathetic inquiries of, the Em
bassadors, but of the regret and concern
of the people.
"It is worth being ill to receive a thing
like this," the Emperor Is reported as.hav
ing said when some flowers sent by three
working women were handed to him to
day. Several similar indications of regard
were made by poor persons In Potsdam.
The Emperor makes light of his indis
position and has asked the members of
his family to act precisely as heretofore.
He feels that the change from his uncom
monly active life to forced quiet, but he
declines to be relieved altogether of the
routine business of state and received in
audience the heads of his private cabinet
and the Chancellor, Count von Bulow.
Professor Bernhard Fraenkel, the emi
nent throat specialist of Berlin University,
in an interview to-day, said:
The public concern about the Emperor's con
dition Is unwarranted. The facts are absolute
ly' as stated in thl3 morning's bulletin. The
people are only agitated because they remem
ber that the first reports about Emperor Fred
erick did not disclose his true malady, but this
time the bulletin is correct. You can reassure
America.
The court circular states that the Em
peror this morning personally heard the
report of Herr von Lucanus, chief of the
civil cabinet.
Inflammation, which naturally follows as a
reaction from the operation, already is di
minishing. We can, therefore, be satisfied
with the appearance of the left vocal chord.
Nevertheless, tlje healing of the little wound
probably will require another week.
The Emperor's general health is good, his
temperature and pulee are normal.

1LBERG.
BERLIN, Nov. 9.â The latest news re
garding the condition of Emperor Wil
ljam is that it remains satisfactory. He
worked several hours this afternoon on
Government business and wrote a long
telegram to King Edward, congratulating
him on his birthdav.
A bulletin concerning the condition of
Emperor William, who was operated upon
Saturday for the removal of a r polypus
from the larynx, was issued this morning
at thft new palace at Potsdam. It is as
follows:
The Rev. B. S. Broderick, formerly of
Hartford. Conn., the auxiliary BlshtÂ»p
o* Havana, Cuba, was appointed titular
Bishop of Giulianopoli.
The confirmation of the appointment of
the Rt. Rev. J. J. Harty as Archbishop of
Manila and of the Rev. Pedro Gonzales y
Estrada as Bishop of Havana and the
Rt. Rev. Maximilian Raynoso y del Coral
as titular Bishop of Nocesarea followed.
The Pope . then arose and bestowed the
apostolic blessing, after which he re
turned to his apartments. â¢;-â¢-Â¦'
Among the confirmations at thia morn
ing's, consistory were those of the Rev.
Thomas A. Hendrick, as Bishop of Cebu,
Philippine Islands, and the Rev. Manuel
Orne Vivanco as Bishop of Pinar del Rio,
Cuba.
Efforts are now being made to destroy the
liberty of the Catholic truth, which the church
must absolutely oppose, as that Is not a pro
motion of liberty, but a corruption of liberty.
However, following the Redeemer, we must
pity and pardon the sinners while trying by
all means to become reconciled with them
"tWO CARDINALS APPOINTED.
. Then the real business of the day was
proceeded with, the appointment of two
Cardinals, Monsigneur Merry del Val, tfie
Papal Secretary of State, and Monslgneu'r
Callegari, Archbishop of Padua, being
announced by the Pope, who said In
Latin: "What have you to say?"
In response the Cardinals raised their
caps as a sign of affirmation on their
part. .
.This was all, so every doubt was laid
at rest for the present regarding the ap
pointment of another American Cardinal.
Continuing, the Pope enumerated all
that was necessary to reach this end.
added that he knew there would be no
obstacles to his work, and safa:
The Pope in his office cannot separate faith
from Dolltlcs. Therefore, he. being the head
and ruler of the most perfect society â namely,
tlie church â constituted among men, and of
men. he certainly must wish that between him
and the. princes of the world and the ruler3
of public affairs mutual relations should exut.
If he wlshen to provide for liberty for Catho
lics In all parts of the world.
RELATIONS WITH NATIONS.
Knowing the duties resting on a Roman Pon
tiff, it is not strange if we considered ourselves
unfit for the task. As we saw the Apostolic
duties we Judged they could not be properly
carried out with our strength, as we recog
nized that on rising to the Papal throne our
greatest study must be to give the utmost
force to religion and to rectify errors. All this,
considering our great weakness, frightened us;
but, as God willed to elevate us to this dignity,
we trust in His help to sustain us. Before all,
our effort wih be to maintain the faith invio
late and to pray for the salvation of all, with
out saving ourselves any trouble and fatigue.
For truth's sake it is necessary that in gov
erning the' church the Pontiff should appear to
be free and not the subject of any power. But
this is not the case, and that is what we la
ment as being a grave injury to the church.
Your precious help and advice, my venerable
brothers, assist me in fulfilling the duties of
my most important office, and I shall always
ask for your counsel under grave circumstances.
Thus, each of you sustaining part of the Im
mense weight resting on us. our services will
be extended not only to the faithful, but to
the whole world. We shall not follow any
path but that of our predecessors, namely, to
restore all in Christ. As Christ is truth, we
must go toward truth.
LAMENTS HIS CAPTIVITY.
The Pope began by recalling that at
first he wished to decline the pontifical
dignity. He said: . ,
Only the Pope and the Cardinals were
present to-day. The latter, according to
custom, gathered somewhat early In an
ante-chamber near the Hall of the Con
sistory, from where they passed into the
latter place, the many papal guards in at
tendance rendering them sovereign hon
ors. The Cardinals took their places ac
cording to precedence. Every one except
Pope Pius showed excitement and pre
occupation. The Pontiff rose at his usual
hour and after a private mass he par
took of a cup of .coffee and went for a
brisk walk in the third loggia, returning
la time to dress for the ceremony at 11.
The Pontiff walked from his apartment
accompanied only by the personages In
immediate attendance on him. As he en
tered the Hall of the Consistory the pic
ture produced was very striking, the red
gowns of the Cardinals and the white
robes and gold and red mantle of the
Pope giving a pleasing coloring to the
scene. The commanding appearance of
the Pontiff was somewhat softened by his
silver hair, under which his blue eyes
gleamed with pleasure and friendliness.
He wore the full pontifical robes, which
r..e only used at a secret consistory once
in each pontificate, namely, for the first
one. . "When the Pope had seated himself
on the throne all those present, one by
one, paid him homage, after which the
master of ceremonies called upon all but
those authorized -to take part in the con
sistory to leave the hall, which was done.
When the doors had been closed and a
guard had been stationed before them,
outside, Pope Pius, in a harmonious voice,
intoned a prayer. Cardinal Oreglia, dean
of the Sacred College, then stood up and
in a few words thanked the Pontiff for
having put aside his private preferences
and accepted the burden of the church.
The Pope replied in an allocution which
received universal approbation.
POPE PIUS IS CAI*M.
ROME, Nov. 9.â The first secret con
sistory of the new pontificate was held
to-day. No American Cardinal was ap
pointed.
Several appointments of Archbishops
and Bishops were made, Including that of
the Rev. J. J. Harty as Archbishop of
Manila, Philippine Islands, -who, as an
exceptional privilege, received the pallium

Mr. Montgomery, Ex-Member ' of State Lefriilature, was recently later-
viewed by the Nashville (Tenn.) American, regarding: bis cure by Swamp-Soot
and mede the following- signed statement:
"My indorsement of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root cannot be written strong
enough. I had been greatly troubled with my kidneys and with what the
doctors termed inflammation of the neck of the bladder. Was obliged to pass
water very frequently day and night, often with smarting and burning. Some-
times my back would get so lame and sore that I was almost helpless. I tried
several doctors and medicines to no good effect, when finally I heard that Df.
Kilmer would send a sample bottle of his kidney medicine. Swamp-Root, free
by mail. I sent at once and received a sample bottle without delay. After
trying the sample I concluded it was just the medicine I needed, and I pur-
chased a liberal supply from my merchant and friend, Mr. E. J. Eslizer. To-
day I am a well man*, and can ride horseback and drive with any of my
friends. I cannot recommend Swamp-Root too highly for what it has done
for me. You are at liberty to use this letter or refer any-one to me, and I will
gladly tell them about my past troubles and what a wonderful remedy this
Swamp-Root is. I am very glad to recommend it to others at every opportu-
nity. Mr. James Ivens of Saundersville, Tenn, and many others are taking it
with good results. Yours very truly, /fts\~~YY} >^"*

a field last Monday morning, the back of
his head having been crushed. The ac
cused are Mrs. Jones, wife of the mur
dered man; Thomas Loving and Daniel
Jefferson. It is alleged that evidence has
developed which leads to the theory that
Jones was murdered for the purpose of
securing $350 insurance upon Jones' life.

The station has been established six
years, during which many kinds of com
mercial plants have been grown there to
ascertain the adaptability of the soil.
"In addition to these reasons there Is
the other that the station has outlived Its
usefulness," said Dr. Hilgard to-day.
"We have got all the good we could out
of it. The Â£500 that we have been spend
ing on it will now be turned into other
channels."
On the ground that it has outlived its
usefulness and that the people for whose
benefit it was established are not partial
to It. the University of California proposrs
to abandon the agricultural sub-station
In the foothill region of Amador County,
near Jackson. The abandonment of this
plant means a considerable loss to the
activities of the region, not only because
of the $2500 that has been expended upon
It annually, but also for the reason that
It has conferred a general benefit upon all
cf the northern counties.
The recommendation for its abandon
ment will be made to the Board of Re
gents by Professor E. W. Hilgard, dean
of the Agricultural College. It will be
acted upon at the regents' meeting to
morrow and will without doubt be
adopted.
The reasons for the abandonment of
the foothill station are given In the re
cent review of the work of the sub
stations as published in the report of the
Agricultural College for the last two
years. In part it reads as follows:
"The remoteness of this sub-station
from railroad facilities still remains a
serious handicap to its development on
broader lines. While situated in a region
in some respects comparable to the
Placer County foothill district, it Is next
to impossible to Induce fruit growers of
the latter district to consider the results
obtained as of any direct value to them.
It Is unfortunate that the prospects of
securing a railroad Into Jackson, which
were eo promising when the station was
established, have not been fulfilled. The
region is primarily a mining center. Agri
culture and horticulture are, therefore, of
secondary importance. Under these con
ditions the Influence of the station must
be considered local. Its existence can
hardly claim to be of prime importance
to the welfare of the agricultural and
horticultural interests of the Jackson dis
trict."

John B. Mnhrr's private secretary was
fhroujrhout a pleasure. He made one for
pet Frank Bacon. His picture of the
par.dy-locked. ppindle-le&ged. old-maidish
Spaulding was admirably consistent,
never overdrawn, always sufficient and
p.ttaininp a notable degree of finish. And
a delightful character it is. The Alcazar
is to be warmly congratulated en the pos
session of Mr. Maher, of tbe best of the
now people.
Mr. Cattermole. done by George Op
bourne, is well in line with Mr. Maher's
Spaulding. Mr. Osboume is always
there, and as th<Â» Irascible uncle of the
scapegrace nephew is peculiarly well
suited It is a vigorous, humorous con
ception. Mr. Durkin is the scapegrace
nephew, young Cattermole. He was easy
Â«>nd boyish in the part, though its hu
mor seemed to slip by him occasionally.
A sightly person the new leading man
is and has evidently established himself
as a high favorite.

is beautifully staged.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
And â¢â¢The Private Secretary" stands
well In the forefront of its kind. One
doesn't need to wash one's teeth afttr
laughing at It to begin with. And there
is much laughter. One likes its people
and its story, the story told with the neat
*Ft of farcical logic. True, when the
tempo of the acting slows up a bit, as it
did occasionally last night, there are gaps
in the plausibility. But that is not the
j'lsy's fault. Nor the players. A week H
rot cufficient to speed the farce to the
snappy t>mpo demanded. That the Alca
zar people do so well with it is indeed
matter for wonder.
Ther#Â» is but one disaster In the cast-
Miss Marie Howe's Miss Ashford. Miss
Howe, who has done much good work, is
here* completely at sea. Her splritialistic
ppinster is a cross between an eÂ».leptic
end a 6t. Yitus dancer, the scenes in
which she appears thrown completely out
(f Tocuf by tbe meaningless exaggera
tion. Mifs Howe also swms curiously to

Of the earlier farce comedtea perhaps
none better bears revival than "The Pri
vate Secretary." that they are giving this
TveÂ«k at the Alcazar. Charles Hawtrey
U\ England. William Gillette here, in their
respective adaptations, found the farce
among their happiest mediums. To-d*ay
it li equally attractive.
They were building very good farce
comedy when "The Private Secretary"
v.as made. It was not thÂ« unhappy me
lange of horse-play, tattered Jest and un
savory situations that the g*nr<> has since
to largely berome. Humor, unforced and
unsciltd. was its Inevitable accomplish
ment. Situations grew naturally from the
play of character upon character, the
portraits touched in with as much care as
was bestowed upon the dramatis personae
of the serious play. The cad, bad, mad
specialty was non t-st; the dialogue pos
t-ssed the outworn distinction tf being
pranimatlral ae well as human.
The scene of the murder is Just one
block from the spot where Celia saw
Crudo and Migalo quarreling and the po
lice think that Migalo followed Crudo and
that he renewed the quarrel with his
enemy, which resulted in the murder.
The description given by persons who
saw three men running away from the
scene of the murder tallies with that of
Crudo, Reccetto and Tupo.
"I went down in a cellar with my
friends,'^ said Celia, "to get some wine
The last I saw of Migalo he was stand
ing where I left him and Crudowas going
toward the cdrner of Kearny street. Ten
minutes later a man came into the wine
cellar and said that Migalo had been
shot."
Celia declares that Crudo and Migalo
engaged in a bitter quarrel about the af
fair of Crudo buying out Migalo's boot
black stand and that high words passed.
It is claimed by Celia that Crudo cursed
Migalo and told him he would buy out
any business he engaged in.
CELIA CONTRADICTS CRUDO.
Crudo's statement that he parted good
friends with Migalo at the corner of Green
and Dupont streets is contradicted by
Guiseppe Celia. who operates a bootblack
stand at California and Kearny streets.
Celia said yesterday that he was with
three friends on Sunday night at Green
and Dupont streets, when he rhet Migalo
and another man. They engaged in con
versation and then Crudo, with Vito Tupo
and Pietro Migalo, came up and Joined
the gathering.
Both Crudo and Reccetto denied any
knowledge of the killing of Migalo. but
the police feel confident that they are
the men implicated in the murder and
therefore detained them.
Reccetto when questioned by the detec
tives told a contradictory story. He as
serted that he and Migalo had been in
the Dupont-street saloon on Sunday night
playing "muro" and that his cousin,
Crudo, had not been in the place all even
ing.
When Crudo was questioned by the de
tectives he admitted that he had been
with Migalo on Sunday night in the saloon
on Dupont street and that they had
played "muro" together, the third party
being Crudo's cousin, Reccetto.
Crudo said Migalo had quarreled with
him, but that they finally parted friends
at the corner of Green and Dupont
streets, and that he, Crudo, then went to
his home close by.
TELL CONFLICTING STORIES.
The men were engaged in playing the
Italian game of "muro," and had high
words about the purchase of Migalo'a
bootblack stand. Friends intervened and
separated thÂ© two men.
The quarrel waa resumed at the corner
of Green and Dupont streets and a few
minutes later the shot was' fired that
killed Migalo. - "- - ' " " â¢.
He "was found by his son John a few
minutes after the shooting and was alive
at the time. Migalo said to his son, "My
God, I am shot," but was unable to tell
the name of his slayer, as he died almost
instantly after making his exclamation.
John Migalo claimed yesterday that he
would produce two Witnesses who heard
Migalo say right after the shooting, "Joe,
why have you shot me," but he refused
to give the names of these witnesses.
Joseph Crudo went to the Hall of Jus
tice yesterday and had a talk with Victor
Demartinl, the official interpreter. He
said he had Just dropped Into see Demar
tini, and though it was known in the Ital
ian quarter that Crudo was suspected of
being implicated In the murder, the police
were all at sea regarding whom suspicion
pointed at. Later on Crudo was arrested
at his home and taken to the Hall of
Justice. . .
HAD A BITTER QUARREL.
Crudo bought out the right to operate
the bootblack stand run by Migalo at
Eddy and Taylor streets, paying $200 to
the saloonkeeper where the stand was lo
cated. This occurred about two months
ago, and since that time Migalo has fre
quently quarreled with Crudo.
Investigation made yesterday showed
that Crudo and Migalo were seen to
gether last Sunday night in the saloon
formerly owned by Crudo at 1405 Dupont
street.
The bad feeling between Crudo and
Migalo, caused by their appearing on dif
ferent sides at the trial of Pagano, led to
further trouble.
Two Italians, Joseph Crudo and his
cousin, Batista Reccetto, were arrested
yesterday by the police and held at tne
Hall of Justice, their names being en
tered on the detinue book. The police ex
pect to prove that Crudo is the man who
fired the shot that killed Migalo.
Considerable excitement reigned yester
day in the Italian quarter, factions tak
ing sides in the quarrel that led to the
killing of Migalo. Mainly through the ef
forts of John Migalo, a son of the mur
dered man, the evidence was forthcoming
that points suspicion at the two men un
der arrest. Chief of Detectives Martin
and Detectives Harry Reynolds and Ed
Wren maintained a sphinx-like attitude
all day yesterday and positively refused
to divulge any evidence in their posses
sion.
The story is that Migalo was shot by
Crudo in a quarrel and that Reccetto,
his cousin, and a man named Vito Tupo
were eyewitnesses.
Migalo, who was a married man, for
irerly kept a bootblack stand at Eddy and
Taylor streets. Lately he operated a
stand on Fourth street.
MURDER LEADS TO MURDER.
The first bad blood that led to the kill-
Ing of Migalo was caused in the trial for
murder of Vincero Pagano, a former part
ner of Joseph Crudo, some months ago.
Pogano was accused of the murder of
his uncle, Pasqualle Faro. Pagano was
acquitted in Judge Dunn's court by the
Jury on the ground of self-defense.
Crudo and Migalo were witnesses in the
trial of Pagano. Crudo testified for Pa
gano that he had heard Faro make
threats to kill Pagano, while Migalo was
a witness for the prosecution.
A feud of long standing undoubtedly led
to the murder of Prospero Migalo, the
Italian bootblack, who was killed late last
Sunday evening at the corner of Green
and Kearny streets.
I wish to brand that statement a falsehood.
It Is absolutely absurd upon Us face that I
Â¦would for a moment consider such a thing.
The only time that I have ever been asso
ciated with Mrs. Anderson outside the church
wai In Aueust of this year, when I went to
Beveral real estate dealers at her request ana
assisted her in securing a house in which to
live. No word of engagement or marrlaga ever
passed between uÂ«.
I have never before stated to this congrega
tion my ace. I will now state that I am 33
years of age. This woman who claims that I
promised to marry her Is more than CO years
of age. There seems to be something behind
all this and I propose to have a thorough in
vestigation, and, if possible, land the guilty
parties behind prison bars.
Nearly every minister of this church during
the last twenty years has had trouble of some
kind with members of the congregation. They
have put rollers under some of them and rolled
thÂ»>m out of the church. Such methods will
not avail with me. for I intend to remain pas
tor of this church for the nÂ»xt three years at
least, and If any one leaves it will not be me.
There was much excitement at. the con
clusion of the minister's statement, and
many of the members of uÂ»e congrega
tion crowded around their pastor, offering
him their sympathy and promising their
support.
The Rev. O. E. Jones is a native of
Ohio. He studied theology at Wllber
force, and has been in the ministry for
seven years, and has been pastor of his
present church for three years. He re
sides at 856 Nineteenth street.
Mrs. Anderson lives at 513 East Twelfth
6treet. She has been twice married.
Before he made the public announce
ment of the actions of Mrs. Anderson the
pastor had requested a committee of the
members of the church to call upon her
and attempt to persuade her to desist
from further pressure of her matrimonial
claims. Mrs. Anderson told the mem
bers of t.ie committee that she had no
intention of trying to force the Rev. -Â»ir.
Jones to fulfill hia obligation, but that
she would maintain to her dying day that
the minister had promised to marry her.
After making the announcement that
Mrs. Anderson had circulated the story
of the alleged engagement, the pastor
said:
The Rev. O. E. Jones, pastor of
the Afro-American Methodist Episcopal
Church, on Fifteenth street, made a sen
sational statement to the congregation
after hla eermon last night to the ef
fect that Mrs. Maria Anderson, widow of
the late Rev. J. F. Anderson of East Oak
land, had been circulating a report that
he was engaged to marry her.
The minister, after relating trie story as
he had heard it, branded the statement
of the widow as absolutely false and
without foundation. He stated that he
was but 33 years of age, while Mrs. An
derson was nearly 70, and for that reason,
if for no other, he would not consider
such a proposition. The minister also said
that unless the annoyance ceased he
should invoke the aid of the law to pro
tect himself against further persecution.

Johnny Doyen, the six-year-old son of

with his little sister when he went too

lying at the wharf, heard the commotion

In this damage suit the defendants ap

that change over the objection of the
Tingley attorneys. From his decision on
the motion for , a change of venue the

While the libel suit was pending an In

Mrs. Tingley, it being alleged that he had
demanded money to settle certain things

The financial statement was read by
John B. Lennon. treasurer of the federa
tion. The report showed that the Income
of the year was $247,800, the expenditures

All of these reports were referred to the

"Nothing herein shall be so construed as to
apply to the organizations of wage earners hav
ing for their object the regulation of wages,
hours and conditions of employment."
With one exception, this proposed clause has
always disclosed the real purpose which the
proposers had iu Introducing their . so-called
anti-trust bills both in the Federal Congress
and State Legislatures ; for whenever this ex
empting clause was submitted the proposers
were unmasked and abandoned their bills. It
ls worse than folly to Join in the hue and cry
raised by our opponents and the faddists for
legislative demands ostensibly aimed at Â¦ com
binations of capital, but really directed against
organizations of labor. .
Attention has been called to the fact that un
der the guise of so-called anti-trust laws lay
the hidden puriÂ«ose to attack the organization*
of labor. A\"e are all familiar with the so
called Sherman anti-trust law, and we are also
aware of the fact that under its provisions the
only persons e\er indicted were a number of
workmen who sought to protect their interests
against an opponent, and that under the pre
tense of its provisions and the so-called inter
state commerce law the Federal courts have is
sued the many injunctions enjoining workmen
from doing those things for which there is ab
solutely no prohibition in the laws, and the do
ing of which ia in no wise atvarlance or in
conflict with the constitution or any of the laws
of our country. It ls because we have detected
in the various proposed bills ostensibly to re
strict or govern the trusts and other corpora
tions of capital the insidious purpose, to attack
the trade unions, which, by the way, have no
pemblance to the trusts, that we have urged in
all measures of this character the following
clause:
From the reports which reach us of the la
bor conditions in the Philippines and our own
knowledge of thfc Chinese in our own and other
countries, we have the right to and will dissent
from Governor Taft's suggestion that any Chi
nese be admitted to the islands under any con
ditions We cannot, however, but commend thÂ«
very enlightened view he takes in his opposition
to the general admission of Chinese, and also
to the views he expresses on the labor move
ment.
Referring to anti-trust agitation, Gom
pers made the following remarks:
rope but from China and Japan, into the main

be brought to the sound."

Efforts have been made to make it appear
that Chinese are necessary to the industry of
the American possessions. That this claim Is
unfounded is demonstrated not only by the in
vestigation made by the representative of the
American Federation of Labor sent to Hawaii,
China, Japan and the Philippines, but it is
borne out by the estimates of native and Ameri
can workmen to the effect that there are suf
ficient numbers of men to perform all the. work
and all the kinds of work which now or which
may in the near future be required; that, as a
matter of fact. In the Philippines there are
more half breed Chinamen than is good for
either the Industrial development of the Islands
or for the economic, social and political Inter
ests of the Philippine people. In Hawaii the
Japanese have invaded every industry and call-
Ing and here as well as in several sections of
the mainland of the United States have become
and are a growing menace to the well being of
our people. From every section comes the com
plaint and the warning that unrestricted Japa
nese immigration is as grave a danger to-day as
was at any time in our hlFtory the unrestricted
Immigration of Chinese. This convention shou'd

Discussing "Mongolian immigration,"
President Gompers said:

"We urge that wages be maintained, even if
necessary to resist reductions; that as a sub
stitute for discharges of workmen the work to
be performed be divided, thus not only helping
to bear each other's burdens, but more quickly
to restore activity in industry, trade and com
merce.
No industry, no country has ever becoms
great or ever can become great founded upon
the poverty of its workers.
The working people should resist any attempt
to reduce their wages or to increase their hours
of labor.
At this time it is difficult to foresee the ex
tent to which the industrial reaction may reach,
although It is quite evident that it is not likely
to become so prolonged or so. intense as previ
ous industrial stagnations or crises.
It is the height of economic unwisdom to cur
tail the consuming power of the masses as a
means to industrial revival or prosperity.
There are indications that the era of Indus
trial activity which we have enjoyed during the
past two years has reached Its flood tide, in
that there is now somewhat of a reaction. Al
ready we see some contraction of industry by
which workmen have been rendered idle. It is
true that the change ia not pronounced, but it
is sufficiently evident for notice and deserves
our consideration. More especially should this
receive our attention elnce, quite recently, act-
Ing upon the cue given by our most pronounced
antagonists, the capitalist press has endeavored
to place upon our movement the responsibillty
for the industrial reaction.
President Gompers' address took up
most of the afternoon. It showed that
the gain In membership of the affiliated
international unions and of the American
Federation of Labor during the last year
had been 442,100. Mr. Gompers reviewed
at length what the federation had ac
complished during the year, and he made
numerous recommendations. He pointed
out that the grave danger -which con
fronted their movement was the inter
necine strife due to the conflicting claims
of trade Jurisdiction. Mr. Gompers con
demned such anti-trust legislation as was
secretly against labor and urged eternal
vigilance with respect to legislation.
President Gompers reported that never
before has there been such uniform
growth in unionism as during the past
year. The American Federation of
Labor has Issued new charters as follows:
International unions, 20; State federa
tions, 3; central labor unions, 171; local
trades unions and Federal labor unions,
1139. The gain in membership has been
442,100.
At the end of the fiscal year, on October
10, 1903, the number of international
unions in the federation was 113; State
federations, 29; central labor unions, 549;

General Manager James F. Welborn of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company an
nounced to-day that the company would
continue to operate its mines and the pub
lic need have no fear of a coal famine. At
the office, of the Victor Fuel Company it
was announced that all of its mines were
in ' operation and would continue to be
operated. The large companies operating
in the northern fields admitted that their
mines were closed. Not more than 150
men were working in the northern fields.
Despite the claims of the coal compa
nies, householders in Denver and other
cities who have not laid In a supply to

for immediate delivery. The supply of
anthracite coal is exhausted and compa

nearly 1000 tons of coal, which had been

sidings. . .
Sheriff Clark of Laa Animas County hag

held in readiness to be dispatched to the
coal regions at the first call from the
sheriffs of counties affected.
MANY PLANTS ARE CLOSED.
It will be the policy of the United Mine
Workers to depopulate the various coal
districts by sending the idle and their
families to Illinois, Indian Territory, Mis
souri, Iowa and other States where. work
could be obtained for them. Five thou
sand fares to these States had already
been arranged for by the United Mine
Workers, and to-day hundreds of the
strikers were on their way to new fields.
D. C. Evans,' member of the executive
board of the national organization from

financial end of the strike. Other mem
bers of the executive board are in the
State and will have charge of the cam
paign during the struggle, one being sta

region.
The storm centers will be Trinidad, in
the southern fields, where the number of
miners aggregate 8000, and the towns of
Hastings and Delagnia, where the Victor

reported that 1000 were working to-day.
Both places are strongly guarded and

Of the idle men, C000 are in the south

fields and 1800 In Fremont County. One
hundred mines have been closed. A few
independent properties in the northern
coal fields and elsewhere '" will not stop
work, since the operators have agreed, to
concede the eight-hour day and also In

Our Canadian friends were guilty the other day of hissing
the American national anthem at a theatrical performance
in Vancouver. This seems to be singularly in bad taste.
We are willing to admit that the anthem, musically consid

just to insult us we cannot understand. We might retaliate
and send the Canadians a bunch of photographs of Lord

A writer in the October 31 issue of Har
per's Weekly makes a plea for the scien
tific regulation of food. It is a striking
fact, he- points out, that science, which
has weighed the moon and measured the
orbits of the planets and split the atom
into electrons, has not yet been able con
vincingly to tell man what is and what
Is net his proper food. And yet it is evi
dent to every Intelligent observer that a
very large proportion of men and women
are polsoniag themselves every day, ruin
ing their bodies and their minds, shorten
ing their lives, and bringing upon them
selves pain and misery through eating
and drinking substances and quantities
that are not fitted for human assimila
tion. "Reformers are at work every
where, but the reformer who could, with
authority, show humanity what it should
eat and drink would surely do more good
than a whole army of wiseacres tinkering
at the effects of the evil. What the world
needs is an authoritative science of food "

In defending British industries and trade conditions Lord
Goschen recently ventured the shrewd opinion, in opposi
tion to the assaults of Chamberlain upon the British system,
that foreign communities are fleeced by trusts. There
can be no question that this is another covert attack upon
American institutions. Lord Goschen forgets that some na
tions, like some families, condone and conceal thievery when
committed in the family or national circle. The cultivation
of impostors is an American industry.
"Give the native Filipino some bamboo,
and a bolo (which takes the place of
saw, ax and knife) and his requirements
are practically filled, for with these he
can almost entirely build his house."
says the cut rent number of the Southern
Workmen. "The bamboo gives him his
timbers for the frame; he splits it for
the floor and walls, and then finishes his
house with - nlpa-palm roof. The bamboo
also furnishes his bed, if he has one, and
his chairs, tables and such other furni
ture as he may need. It even supplies
many of his dishes and kitchen utensils,
?s well as his hat, and also provides him
with food, for bamboo sprouts make a
very palatable dieh. Fruit in sufllclent
quantities to satisfy his needs grows
readily without cultivation. Rice and fish
constitute the rest of his diet The for
mer must be cultivated with care if the
bâ¬3t results are to be obtained, but it is
needless to cay that as a rule the best re
sults are not obtained. Thus It can easily
be seen that the average native's simple
wants are readily supplied by Mother Na
ture and that the necessity for a strenu
ous life does not exist"

THE Redlands Citograph of November 4, noting a
shipment of navel oranges from San Diraas, Los An
geles County, on October 23, says: "The first shipment
from Northern California was made just nine days previous.
North California oranges are all shipped early in the season in
order to avoid possibility of damage by the January frosts."
This is an error. There is no record of an orange tree in
the Northern California citrus belt being damaged by frost,
and for the sufficient reason that the orange grows in North
ern California in a region that stretches from Porterville to
Oroville, nearly 300 miles, in a thermal belt, where killing
frost is not known. Nor is the orange in Northern Califor
nia confined exclusively to that thermal belt in the foothills.
In Sutter County the orange ripens in the fall and remains
on the tree until May, for the fruit gains in quality by leaving
it unharvested, so it is picked as needed for use.
The reason why the Northern California orange goes into
market early is because it ripens three months or more in
advance of the Southern California fruit.' For some phy
sical reason this is true of the stone fruits, which ripen in
the northern part of the State long in advance of the south.
The first ripe oranges in the State this year were sent into
market from Placer County, and Porterville soon followed,
and Oroville will soon be harvesting and shipping. The
crop is marketed early because it ripens early, and not to
escape frost, for the fruit could be safely left on the tree until
spring.
Californians who rejoice in the matchless capacity of their
State do not gird at Northern California for having early,
nor at Southern California for having late, oranges. The
great and important fact, of value to the whole State, is that
we have the longest citrus season of any part of the world.
Our orange harvest is practically continuous from October
to April, and the marketing season is much extended by using
cold, dry storage. â¢
The only reason why Northern California shipsa less num
ber of carloads than Southern California is that this part of
the State began planting orchards later. No attention was
paid to citrus fruits as a commercial proposition in Northern
California until the citrus exhibit in Sacramento, about
twelve years ago. Yet the orange tree at Bidwell's Bar had
been bearing heavy annual crops for twenty-five years, and
trees in full bearing were established on the lawns and parks
of Sacramento, Marysville, Oroville, Colusa and Chico. That
exhibit was the cause of Northern California embarking in
orange planting as a commercial proposition, and that
proved the earliriess of the fruit in the north and gave to
the State an orange harvest season about seven months long.
So our Citrographic friend, instead of dreaming cold and
frosty dreams about the northern citrus belt, should be
proud of his whole State, and rather dream of the time when
the combined Northern and Southern California citrus belts
willmake a yellow equator around the globe and controlthe
orange market of the world, putting Sicily, Spain, Brazil and
Mexico out of the business.

Let your sparring partner lead for your
face with his left. As he leads move the
head to the right (as In the left cross
counter for the face) Just far enough to
avoid his blow, and at the same time
leafl with your left for his wind, or "solar
plexus," or "the mark," as It is variously
called. As you do eo. bend the left knee
and throw the weight and force of your
body Into the blow. The left knee is bent
in delivering this counter, in order to
bring the center of force lower down than
would be needed for a face blow, and also
to jive directness, force and grace to tÂ£e
delivery of the -blow. This could not be
accomplished with the legs in a rigid posi
tion, as when leading: for the face. Do
not bend the right knee. When practicing
this blow in lessons, or when applying it
in a regular boxing match, it is well to
raise the riarht arm In such a way as to
be able to suard the face should your op
ponent take advantage of the forward in
clination of the upper part of your body
to uppercut you or to land a right-hander
on your face. In thus raising the right
to ruard the face do not bring it ud bo
high as to be unable to guard a possible
right counter for your body. When you
axe in such a position, however, your ad
versary is far more likely to lead for
your face than for your body We will
continue this subject in next Friday's ls-
That brings us to the body blows
First, we will take the left counter for
the wind, a terrifically effective blow in
a fight and one needing more skill than
appears at first glance.
Left lead for the faceâ parryâ right lead

60!
On guard, then In first position. Let us
go over the maneuvers you have already
studied before taking up the new ones.
At the beginning of each lesson remember
to go over all the blows, guards, etc.. you
have learned before starting in on some
thing new.
Now for our lesson: Stand on guard.
Remember, no matter how far advanced
you may consider yourself, you cannot af
ford to grow negligent as to your position
on guard. Avoid a slovenly, sprawling
ruard. The exoerts who decreed that
boxer* thould stand erect, right hand
ruarding the wind, left guarding the
heart, feet about eighteen Inches apart,
and weight resting on the ball of the
foot, did not do so merely for their own
amusement or for any arbitrary reason.
Every detail has a reason for being, as
when you are a little farther advanced
you will understand. In the meantime,
take my word for it.
Do not Imagine that I digress when I
give advice of this sort. All that I advise
in of the utmost importance to a boxer.
Mere knowledge of handling the gloves,
without accompanying knowledge as to
the care of the outer and inner man, will
profit you little. The condition of the
Fkln and of the stomach, heart, lungs,
etc^. have decided more fights and boxing
matches than has all the mere science
ever Invented.
A rubdown with alcohol or witch hazel
Just after boxlnp. or a hot bath, will
greatly lessen the chances of stiffness.
But remember, in bathing, never remain
in the tub longer than two minutes at the
very most. One minute is better. If you
take a plunge bath and a sponge batb
every day (and no one -with any preten
sions to cleanliness or athletic prowess
should take fewer), you will find that one
minute of vigorous Trashing in the tub
will keep you quite clean enough. "Soak
ing" or lying for any length of time In a
bath (particularly In a warm bath) is one
of the mort enervating habits that can be
formed. Not only does it weaken you,
but it leaves you perilously prone to catch
cold. And colds are among the athlete's
worst foes.
Left Coulter for Solar Plexus.
Last week we took up the various
straight leads and counters for the face.
To-day we will practice body blows and
their guards.
If. during your first few lessons, you
find that the exercise stiffens or pains
your muscles and if you awake in the
morning sore and aching in every Joint,
do not be alarmed. The condition is not
alarming. It simply Indicates that a lot
of sinews which you have neglected and
allowed to grow flabby are offering a lazy
protest against being forced to work.
The- very best remedy for such pains Is
to continue the exercise. In a very few
days the aching joints and muscles will
accustom themselves to the work and will
thrive mightily thereon. Incidentally, you
will find yourself in better health and in
possession of better spirits and more vig
orous energy than you ever before knew.

WHILE the majority in Congress will> stand by the
administration in the recognition of the new state
of Panama, and will insist upon the canal policy
moving onward without a hitch', the attitude of the Demo
cratic minority is not without interest. Mr.. William Ran
dolph Hearst has already declared in his newspapers that
the administration must be scandalized because of its ac
tion. He wants a resolution of inquiry, an investigation,
and declares that "guilt must be fixed" upon the President
and the State Department. The country is interested in
knowing whether the Democracy will follow this pro
gramme.
There are indications that, in a modified form, it will
be favored by Senator Morgan, chairman of the canal com
mittee. The Republican majority in the Senate, in recogni
tion of his sustained interest in an isthmian canal, and of his
long service in that behalf, made him chairman of that lead
ing committee, although a member of the minority. Be
sides Morgan the members of the committee are Senators
Hawley of Connecticut, Platt of New York, Hanna of Ohio,
Mitchell of Oregon, Millard of Nebraska, Kittredge of South
Dakota and Foster of Louisiana â an exceptionally strong
committee. 1
Senator Morgan's views becomes important, not only on
account of his chairmanship of the committee, but by reason
of his knowledge of canal matters. He is reported as say
ing: "Recognition of the so-called republic Of Panama does
not create a government for the purpose of doing business.
The reception of a representative of that government does
not make a government. While the recognition of de facto
governments rests with the President, when it comes to a
matter of doing business the Senate becomes part of the
recognizing power. It will inquire about the manner of the
establishment of this so-called government."
The threat in that is hardly covert. It is quite open and
frank. Of course the Senate will, and should, inquire. But
when that inquiry is made Senator Morgan will be con
fronted with some past history of his own making. The
republic of Hawaii was born of revolution, in which a war
ship of the United States took the principal part, without
which the revolution could have been suppressed by a
dozen policemen. Its scene was not the whole of the islands,
nor even the whole island of Oahu. It was the most local
revolution that ever happened, for it was limited to the city
of Honolulu. Molokai, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai and the smaller
islands of Lanai, Kehoolawe and Niihau, knew nothing of it
and took no part in it.
Yet Senator Morgan supported immediate recognition or
the new republic, which had to be wetnursed by American
bluejackets and suckled by Gatlings landed by an American
man-of-war! He wanted to immediately proceed to do busi
ness with it, far more important as an international matter
than any business we will do with Panama, for he thought
it so qualified to do business as to immediately offer itself to
the United States. Panama will not do that. He was sent
as a Commissioner of our Government to do business with
Hawaii, and it will be remembered that he told the natives
to be reconciled, because they would be accorded the same
rights as the negroes in this country. This promise has
been made good very recently by ordering Prince Jonah,
Hawaii's member of Congress, and his wife out of a box in
d. Columbus theater on the ground that they axe "niggers."
. If Hawaii, revolutionized by our direct act, became imme
diately qualified to do such serious business as annexation
was, surely Panama is hard baked enough to make a canal
treaty. If Senator Morgan find anything rawer about "the
manner of the establishment of this so-called government" of
Panama than existed in the case of Hawaii, the country will
listen to his discoverv with interest.
Oakland is at the moment fortunate above many cities
in having a peculiarly strong and clean rity government. It
was secured by all political parties standing together, for
getful of merely partisan differences in the greater interest
of the whole people. That government will build to itself a
lasting monument, not only in the esteem of the people
who elected it and whom it serves, but in the gratitude of all
American municipalities, if it take the initiative in planting
municipal ownership of public utilities upon proper business
principles. Admitting that such ownership mixed with the
political part of government has been productive of some
benefits, it is nowhere nor by any one denied that such bene
fits would have been much greater had each plant stood
upon its own resources, independent of the public revenues
and not among the burdens of the taxpayers. Where mu
nicipal ownership has failed, its failure is traceable to mak
ing it a burden on the general fund to be carried by the
taxpayers. Where its administration has been scandalous
the scandals are traceable to the same cause.
Oakland is happy in having the experience of others as
her guide. Her need of public improvement becomes greater
with every exploit of private enterprise. Her new ferries,
the new trans-mountain railroad that already has terminal
facilities upon her harbor, every nail driven in a new build
ing, and every brush of paint spread on its walls, adds to
this need. She wants parks, not plazas; the best paving for
her streets: the best sewers for her drainage, and public
buildings that more nobly house her administration. To
get these and get them now, while her government is in
good hands, and before she suffers such a political reaction
as has overtaken New York, will tax her present credit to
the limit, and as much of these improvements, such as sew
ers and streets, must be paid for by abutting or immediately
benefited property, why should she unnecessarily increase the
burden and injure the popularity of an improvement policy
by adding to it the cost of a water plant which should pay
its own way?
If she refuse to do this, and availing herself of the ad
monitory experience of others by making such a plant stand
alone, and possibly by making it add to instead of sub
tracting from the general fund, Glasgow will pass out of
public notice as an exponent of municipal ownership and
Oakland will take her place as an example of such owner
ship that conforms to right principles and vindicates the san
ity of dividing business from politics.
San Francisco needs such an example badly enough to
wait for it. The moment such a policy is decided upon by
Oakland all eyes and all hopes turn toward her. In a high
sense the fame that she will secure by being boldly mindful
of her own interests will be the greatest advertisement that
any American city has enjoyed. We promoted, with great
satisfaction, the success of her present government, and we
havefaith that it will not be content to follow the mistaken
path of other cities, but will cut out for itself a right and
OAKLAND is at the advent of great things. The re
cent duplication of her ferry facilities does not
mean that , the new line will get only what the old
loses, but that increase of population and patronage will
soon tax the carrying capacity of both. The physical charms
of that side of the bay, its superior clemency of climate, the
majesty of its scenery and the improved satisfaction of life
in the midst of it all, emboss it with every desirable char
acteristic of a place for homes. San Francisco is interested
in its progress, for it is part of our tributary territory, and
every new home made there contributes to our welfare and
progress as the business center of the Pacific Coast. â¢-
Under the circumstances Oakland finds herself stand
ing at the open door of a great future, and needful of many
things. These necessities have always been upon her, and
while the lack of them has been a just cause of complaint,
in some respects she is fortunate that the responsibility of
meeting and supplying them has been projected into a pe
riod that enables her to profit by the experience of others.
In a recent interview her City Auditor said: "I am in favor
of obtaining every improvement as fast as it can be ac
quired, provided that there is always sufficient revenue to buy
the water plant."
There is the crux of the whole matter. The acquisition
of a public water system stands in the way of something
else that is desirable and necessary to the growth of the
city. When the people understand that this obstruction is un
necessary they will feel that a burden is lifted and a bar to ad
vancement is removed. The process is not only simple, it
is good business, and removes from the future of the city
a cloud that always hangs over public ownership, when it
involves the public revenues and becomes a part of the
merely, and properly, political functions of the municipal
government. A water plant, administered as a municipal
monopoly, should bear its own cost, have charged to it the
cost of its acquisition and the expense of its administration./
Does any one doubt that a public water plant in Oakland
can carry itself? If so, he doubts the propriety of acquiring
such a plant at all. By the simple expedient of making the
plant carry its own bonds the city revenues are left free for
the other and necessary * public purposes which the City
Auditor has in mind.
When visited by Professor Dana in 18S9
it lacked only 400 feet of being full, so
as to run over from the top. In 1840 the
lava had subsided eo that it was 1000 feet
below the rim. No recent eruptions have
projected the lava over the rim, but at
various times since the discovery of the
island great streams of lava have burst
out from the side of the mountain, 2000
feet or more below the summit.
Jorullo, in Mexico, is one of the most
remarkable instances of Intermittent vol
canic action. Up to 1753 the site where
the voloanic cone now stands was occu
pied by a fertile plain, surrounded by hills
composed of very ancient volcanic rocks.
In that year, amid earthquake shocks,
a chasm opened in the plain, from which
flames issued, and ashes and lava were
ejected In sufficient quantities to form in
a short time a mountain 1600 feet high.
Since then there have been no eruptions,
and the lower flanks of the mountain
are now covered with trees and the sur
rounding: country is cultivated as for
merly.
One of the largest volcanoes, and one
which has been most carefully studied, is
Kllauea, on the island of Hawaii, the
crater of which is 13,673 feet above the
sea. The crater is nearly three miles in
diameter and is filled with boiling lava,
which varies greatly in height at different
times.
But the many other positive indications
of the existence of molten matter In the
interior of the earth' have lead to a
conclusion which satisfies all parties,
namely, that after descending forty or
fifty miles from the surface the heat is
bo great and the pressure so limited that
all substances are melted, so that there
Is a segment, probably many hundreds
of miles in thickness, consisting of molten
matter, while the interior remains both
intensely hot and at the same time eolid.
One of the most striking positive Indi
cations that there is such a molten mass
at no sxeat distance below the surface
of the earth Is to be found In the vol
canoes of the world, which are best ex
plained as vent holes through which this
molten matter escapes to the surface in
response to the varying degrees of pres
sure from the crust of the earth over
different areas. When, for example,
through long continued deposition of
earthy material about the mouths of the
great rivers, one portion of the earth's
crust becomes overloaded, eo that it
presses with undue weight over a lim
ited area, it would squeeze a portion of
the molten material to the surface, Just
as if you press with your thumb upon
the rind of an orange In one place it will
crack the rind in another place and force
the Juice out through it. The slow con
traction of the diameter of the earth also,
through its loss of heat by radiation, may
result in the wrinkling up of the crust
in such a manner that the molten matter
will be forced out along the lines of great
est weakness.
Taking the average' increase of heat to
be one degree in fifty feet, we should
reach a point where water would boil at
a distance of about 8000 feet, or a little
over a mile and a half. It, therefore,
would be a feasible plan to bore a hole
to that depth, and by letting cold water
into it by one pipe bring it up hot in
another, thus making use of the heat of
the interior of the earth to warm our
houses. Very likely before the coal and
oil are exhausted this may be the source
through which to dispel In our homes the
rigors of winter, even in arctic climates.
At the same rate of increase we should
have to descend over thirty or forty miles
to find a degree of heat which would melt
any known substance and produce a mol
ten interior. The only escape from the
conclusion that the earth consists of thi3
thin erust of consolidated material arises
from the fact that the melting point of
metals rises under pressure. For exam
ple, iron when subjected to very great
pressure will remain solid long after
reaching the temperature at which it or
dinarily melts, so it is supposed that the
pressure toward the center of the earth
Is so great that no amount of heat, or,
at any rate, the intense heat of the Inte
rior of the earth, can make it assume
the liquid form. This also agrees with
the calculations of physicists, who affirm
that the earth behaves like a solid, and
therefore can not have a liquid interior,
as was formerly supposed.
hot enough to melt all known mineral
substances. In boring for gas or oil or
water and in descending along the line of
mineral veins or to reach deep seated coal
deposits it Is found that the temperature
ircreases about one degree for every fifty
or seventy-five feet, so that it is a seri
ous Question with miners how far they
can follow a vein into the earth before
reaching a point where the heat will be so
great that it would be impossible for
workmen to endure it.

terrific heat of the sun. It says:
"Now if we drop a cup of water on a
redhot stove we know the commotion pro
duced. "What shall we say when we
think of dropping a volume of water sev
eral times bigger than the earth upon a
molten surface 866,000 miles In diameter?
This would probably create something the
effect of a sun spot, which, owing to the
sun's vast distance from us, only creates
a little fleck on its surface. Yet one of
these spots Is known to be 60,000 miles
wide. Across it shoot vast tongues of
fire and flame, and in these surging cav
erns of molten matter all our conceptions
of heat seem insignificant. Yet if this Is
only a mere spot in the sun. what must
the whole volume be? The mind Is lost
in trying to conceive it."

Cat With Tender Feelings.
Tombstone II, the Press Club's. big black
cat, can do everything but talk, and de
spite his lack of speech he generally suc
ceeds in making known his wants. The
Knockers' Club (an adjunct composed of
non- voting, but hypercritical, associate
members) swears he knows more than
some of the active members.
Tombstone II came to the Press Club
with a reputation as a hunter. Before he
had been there a week he had killed or
frightened away every rat of a large col
ony that had made its appearance a short
time previously in the Ellis-street quar
ters. Every time he killed a rat the big
black fellow would carry it from room to
room, depositing It at the feet of each
member present and strutting up and
down with pompous pride.
Several days ago a puny little mouse
was caught on one of the lower floors
and it was decided to take it up to the
Press Club and turn it over to the tender
mercies of Tombstone II. When the
mouse was released the black cat struck
It a couple of sharp blows with his paw.
Either it was too frightened to run, or
too young to realize its danger, and it
made no attempt to get away. Apparent
ly the helplessness of the little rodent ap
pealed to Tombstone II. He turned It
over and over and examined It critically,
walked away a few feet, returned and
then sat down to debate the problem.
Finally the big feline picked up the
mouse carefully by the back of the neck
and 'carried It to the door. There he put
it down long enough to let out a
"meow," which was a demand that the
door be opened. Then he again picked it
up, passed out through the door and de
scended the stairway- a short distance.
Depositing the mouse unharmed on one of
the steps, he strode back into the club
with solemn dignity.
Yet it is said that the feline tribe is
never moved by the promptings of a kind
ly instinct.

Russia is already trying ' to capture the
cotton goods market of Manchuria from the
hands of the United States. Under date of
March 19. 1903. the United States Consul at
Newchwang. Henry B. Miller, made the fol
lowing statement In the advance sheets of Con
sular Reports:
Good markets are not so plentiful nowadays
that we caa afford to let one slip through oar
fingers where we are already pre-eminent, and
for soch articles as Russia can manufacture
herself we will certalaly lose the Manchurian
market if the business men of thÂ» United
States do cot wake up and see to it that our
Interests are safeguarded now â now is the
time to do It.
When people are prosperous they are good
customers for those who have something to
sell, aad la Manchuria the articles that sell
best are those which the United States can
furnish to the best advantage, such as kero
sene, flour, cotton goods, etc There la also a
good market for California fruits.
AMERICAN-MADE GOODS.
Manchuria is a richer province than any to
be found In the whole Russian empire. It
reminds one cf the prairies of Iowa. Kansas
or the Dakota*. As far aa the eye caa reach
one sees immense grain and com fields. The
country is not cut up into small tracts as bap
pens to be the case In many other Oriental
countries, but there are large fields, and farm
ing is done on a large scale, I have seen
Chinamen plowing and harrowing with five and
six ponies and mules. There teems to be
prosperity en every hand. To a casual passer
by this Is best evidenced by the bountiful crops
and the sleek, fat appearance of tbe farm
stock. While the horses are small they are
very tough and enduring, and so are the don
keys but the mules are fine specimens, as
large aad strong as those in the United States.
To protect oar Manchurian Interests we must
deal with Russia. China has nothing to aay in
Manchuria to-day aad Russia Is paramount.
Russia wl!l never let go of Manchuria aad sbs
has almost aa good a grip oa jt to-day aa she
has on Moscow. I weat nearly all over the
country and saw Russian soldiers In practically
every town. At every railway station one sees
Russian sentries on guard. They run the whol*
thing, and poor John Chinaman- has not a word
to say about it. At every railway station from
Dalny to Harbin, even If there are only three
or four buildings there, one sees fine brick
buildings going up. I have never been any
where wbere I saw such activity In building.
Does anybody believe for a moment that Russia
fs putting up all these fine buildiags on the eve
of her evacuation for the Chiaese to come back
and live In them?
DEALING WITH BTJSSIA.
In 1901 the imports frcta the United Elates
into Manchuria amounted to nearly $5,000,000.
The total foreign Imports for the same year
were under S13.OuO.00>). Tbe United States had.
therefore, about 44 per ceat of tbe total foreign
Imports of Manchcrta. In 1902 the American
experts Into Manchuria fell to about S3 per
ceat of the total amount of Manchuria's fcre'm
imports. Notwithstanding this decline from
IK'l. we are still doing a far larger business in
Manchuria than any other foreign country. But
how long will this lavt if the American peoptj
do not wake up to the true realization of the
facts and see to it that American goods shall be
assured a square deal in that market?
The opinion seems to prevail at home that
the United States has not much at stake la
Maachuria. aad that England and Japan are en
deavoring to Induce Uncle Sam to haul the
chestnuts out of the fire for them. It Is true
we have no political Interests there, wherea*
Japan has; but from the above figures It would
seem that the United States has more at stake
in Manchuria than any other country.
I wish to call your attention to Manchuria,
that rich territory where America. Is doing such
a large business, and wbere we may find oar
sej\es shut out almost any day if our Govern
ment does not take energetic steps to protect
our Interests.

Americans are net permitted to enjoy." The
friends of tbe United States trade with Man

few words. Of course. If you do not believe
your Consul at Xewchwang and are happy ia
placing your heart and confidence in the state

MARKET FOB FLOUB.
The fDllowusr is an extract frosi aa article
published la a paper oat here:
"The largest imports of flour from the United
States iato Manchuria were made la 1901. when
It amounted to J12S.O0O in value, while In 1902
it fell to $91,004. Xew the demand for Amert
caa flour has beea worked up in the few years
preceding 1801. aad Is therefore of receat
growth. Ansericaa flour gained a good deal
ia Chinese favor when they found out its su
perior quality, and also especially whea they
found out that its price was not very much
different from the native aad Inferior flour.
An areat cf Rcssiaa manufacturers Is here
endeavoring, ia rocnectleo with ths Russo-
Chinese Bank, to secure the trade ia cotton
priats. He has a very large selection of sam
ples *nd promises delivery la three months.
The prices range from 12.5 kopecks <&4 ceats)
per Russian yard CS laches) for ordinary
prlated cambrics, to 21 kooecks (10.S ceats>
t--r fancy Lastlngs.
Tbe Chinese say the character and quality of
the goods are well suited to this market and
are b*ttÂ»r thaa the American goods, aad that
they will sell If prices are low enough. The
above Quotations are aot, however, sufficiently
low to secure the trade.
The lmoorts of drill*. Jeans and sheetings
frcm the United States through Newchwang
amount annually to about U.OO>>XOO. and when
the quantity coming through Dalny and Port
Arthur is taken iato account aad the other
kinds of cottoo fabrics are iaciuded. I am, con
vinced that Â©cr imports of cotton goods Into
Manchuria will amount to over S4.5CO.CO0 per
anrum. Under Russian control of the customs
it is claimed that lius* ian goods win pass free
and ail others would pay the duty.
American oil has enjoyed great favor la
Manchuria. The quantity of American kero
sene lmDorted into Menchurla steadily grew
up to 190L In that year it amounted to 8.172,
000 gallons. In 1902. however, the lxaportt fell
from the three million mark down to 603.2S9
gallons.
So far as costom returns show there Is no
accounting for this decrease by the iatroduc
ttou of aay other oil. but the facts are that
th- prediction made ia my last year's report
have been fulfilled, aad oil sold by the Russo-
Chiaese-Bank la the Interior cities of Man
churia is driving out the American product.
An American firm en account of the opposition
of the Russian oil dealers has been unable to
secure a site at Daisy for building warehouses
to store American oil.

SCKZDUT-E OF HOURS.
It appears by the evideace that the average
hours cf actual labcr by the body of regular
cea cader the present schedule are tea hours
and three niautes. or thereabout; thef e . tne
tirae when the strike was settled la April.
13GC, the schedcle which was agreed to by tas
company was tea hours per day. ta be com
pleted wlthia focrteea hour*, aad that this
schedule, usca the request of the uaioa, was
amended ty exteadlc*- the hours of labor ta
elerea. to be completed within Cfteea hoars,
la compering the hours of service oa these
railroads it does not appear that they are
longer cr more arduous than generally prevail
ia this line of service: nor does it appear that
they are too long, coaslderinr toe health aad
welfare of the mca la this line of service, aad
la view cf the fact that the diaiat* of the
I'i-'.S-- Coast Is exceptlosaZljr mild and free
from that severity that obtains ia the middle
asd eastern part of the Unite-d Bcates.
Thirdâ 1 Judge and award that the same
hours and schedule that now obtains be coa
ttcued. it :s always wlthla the province of
the railroad en the cue side and the employes
oa the other ta inwd their schedules ty mu
tual agreement- I therefore dedlae to disturb
the prÂ«*ent schedules.

which this arbitration was entered cpoa. the
wage rate adjudged aad awarded Â»*iÂ«i; \jÂ»
deemed to go jr. to effect as of the In of May
1V03. and continue Butll the 1st of May. 190*. '
la conclusion I desire to add that in coming
to ths sbove dec; j lea I have endeavored to be
Just aad equitable to both sides, and have
beea largely influenced by the desire and pur
pose to establish a permanent peace betweea
the company and its employes, to eacourage
a r;!r;t cf mutual cocadeace aad to secure to
the public what It has a right to demand, the
best possible street railway service without
frteUin. so aa to avoid for many yean to
coo* ccaÂ£lct aad disagreement between the
corporation oa the one side, the union on the
other, although by this agreement the award
as aforesaid, is to be cr.'y binding for a period
of one year.
I trust, asd It Is my expectation, that it will
continue for a much longer period. The exten
sive creparatioa of this case, wita its vast
amount cf testimony asd the large cost aad
labor it has entailed upoa both sides, has been
so great that It is hoped that this will be aa
added rtasoa for ceatiauing the award for
years to cetae beyond the period specified.
For the purpose of avoiding aay dispute or
disagreemcat regarding the meaalag aad la
terpretalkjo cf these awards or regarding the
persons to whom they shall apply. 1 suggest ia
such ereat the q3estloa be referred to arbitra
tion, the arbitrators to be selected. ocÂ« by
the United Railroads, the other by the Em

third arbitrator be selected by these two. whose
dedsica shall be Cnal and conclusive.

I decline to ccacur &ad wIU Â£!â¢ aj reasons

the rest cf the United States does not appear.
It was daisied that part cf the Increase la
due to the fact that labor is more generally
orraruxed in the different branchee of industry
la eaa Francisco than elsewhere, aad that has
been one of Uxe causes for a rise ia thÂ« cost
of living.
Ia view, therefore, cf all these circoa
Â«taaoeÂ«. I aiJrSge and award:
Firstâ That the United RaRrcads ef Baa
Francisco pay to such cf the members of Divis

now and have t>eÂ«a la their employ for a

now aad have beea tsrlcr to April l. 1W3. la
their eacpJcy two years aad over aa iacreas* of
10 per cent obore 25 ceats aa hour, aad that
for overtime tie like percentages of Increase
above the present rate be paid.
Second â I adjudge aad award that the United
Railroads cf Eaa Francisco pay to suca

Uoq cf Street Railway Employes of Anaer.

and have been la their employ for a serlod of

said <.-_;' :â¢?â¢Â«Â¦Â« who are new aad have beea
prior to April 1, 1908. la their employ two
years as3 over aa Increase of 10 per cent
above the rate of wage they are now receiving.
W bother the Increase cf the co*t of llrlag
io =an Francisco for the first Stc months ia
1KB as ooraoared with the first five months
la 13u2 was normal or not as compared with
TffA-rTF.S ITS AWJLRD.
On the other hand it Is claimed by the
United ' Railroads, based upon Professor
Pleha s report, that while there has been an
advance thai advance does not exceed raere
thaa 3 per ce=t. The basle of ths large mass
of teÂ«tlsiocy oifered fcy the street railway eni
plcyt* derived from their own members Is
larking in deÂ£niteness and ia part ia reliabil
ity. Oa the other hand the bases of the ex
haustive calculations made by Professor
Piehn are not entirely satisfactory or coa
vtsci&g. The -rrv.â.-zv oa both sides estab
lishes, however, the fact that there has beea
for the perlcls mentioned a rt*e In the cost of
living; that cd t*Â»e average the rent of rooms
or ax>artzcÂ«-ats such as the employe* live in has
advanced about 10 per cent.

The rtaaiard cf wages oa the Pacific Coast,

It waÂ» for that reasoa asiong others that the
United Railrcadc cf fian Fraaciaco after the

eaea 23 cents per hour with 30 cents for over

wag 10 to 13 per cent higher than paid by sim
ilar railroads ia other cities with the excep

The evidence shows la coenpariag the erwt
of llvis* in 1902 with that of iftOS that there

SCOTT'S EMULSION".
This is the season of the
year when Scott's Emulsion
does some of its best work-
Fortifying the system against
the ravages of winter is one
of the most effective uses of
Scott's Emulsion ; it builds
up the strength of the whole
body and puts one in a
healthy, vigorous condition-
Weak lungs, throat troubles
or bronchial affections get
more positive help and relief
from Scott's Emulsion than
from any other source.
Cod liver oil itself is very
scarce just now; cheap adul-
terations and mixtures of
inferior oils are offered every-
where.
This. is why Scott's Emul-
sion should be insisted upon.
It never varies from the high
quality and absolute purity
that has made it the standard
for thirty years.

cored of kidney trouble by LydiaE.
Pinkhara's Vegetable Compound.
Of all the diseases known with which
the f exsale organism is afflicted, kidney
disease is the most fatal. In fact, tm-
less prompt and correct treatment is a p-
plied. the weary patientseldomsarri Tea.
Being- fully aware of this, Mrs. Pink-
ham, early in her career, gave careful
study to tie subject, and in producing
her sreat remedr for woman's ills â
Lydia E. Pizxkbam's Vegetable
Compound â made anre that it con-
tained the correct combination of
herbs which was certain to control
that dreaded disease, woman's kidney
troubles.
Bead What 3Irs. Weisslitz Says.
"Deab Mes. Pesxbam : â For two
years ny life was simply a burden, I
esSered so with female troubles, and
pains across my back and loins. The
doctor told me that I had kidney
troubles and prescribed for me. For
three months I took his medidne, but
grew steadily worse. My husband then
advised me to tnr Lydia EL. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, and
brought home a bottle. It is tbe great-
est blessing erer brought to our home.
Within three months I was a changed
woman. " My pain had disappeared, ny
complexion became dear, my eyes
bright, and my entire system in good
shape.*â Mes. Pactjl VrjassLnz, 178

night, under the direction of the
San Francisco Athletic Club. The bat
tle was to have been fought last month,
but owing to an injury suffered by Britt,
the tight was postponed until to-night.
Brltt has entirely recovered the use of his
.ankle and is In splendid condition. - The
sale of seats for the "go" has been very
large and it Is expected that fully five
thousand ring-goers will crowd the Pa
vilion. .
Britt has his work cut out for him. Sei
ger is known as the "Iron man." He not
only is capable of withstanding great
punishment, but knows how to inflict It.
JIMMY BRITT, the local lightweight
boxer, and Charley Seiger of
Brooklyn will contest twenty
rounds in Mechanics' Pavilion to-
It will be a fight between two well-trained
men who are at the top of their class.
Seiger has two draws with Joe Gans and
a victory over -Willie Fitzgerald to his
credit. He Is trained to the hour and is
down to weight.
The betting on the contest is 10 to 6,
with Brltt the favorite. Both men will be
heavily backed. The Olympic Club con
tingent will turn out in large numbers
and cheer Jimmy and also wager their
money on him. Seiger has made a good
impression on the local ring-goers. He Is
fast and aggressive. Seiger has Informed
his friends that he will go right at Britt
and will not give him a .minute's rest.
Britt has heard of the plan and it pleases
him greatly. He eays he likes to have a
roan come right at him, as it gives him a
chance. to land some of his pet hooks.
Eddie Graney will referee the contest.
He was chosen some weeks ago and his
selection meets with the approval of all

According to the articles, of agreement
they must weigh not more than 133
pounds.
The preliminary, battles will be well
worth seeing. Dave Barry, the Sixth
street champion, who is training George
Gardner for his battle with Fltzsimmons,
is to box ten rounds with Maxey Kane,
the champion of the Philippine Islands.
This ought to prove a good light, as both
men are aggressive. The ten-round con
test between' "Spider" Welch and Frank
Rafael should also be interesting. Both
men are well known "in pugilistic circles
arid are certain to put up a fast battle.
Rafael has been training 1 Jimmy Brltt
and is in splendid shape. He showed laat 1
monyi that he could go some, even when
out of condition. He is a stiff puncher
and ought to give the "Spider" an inter,
esting argument.

To-days, to-morrow's and Wednesday's j
practices will be behind the closed gates i
at the varsity oval and the coaches in
three days of secret work will try to in
still into the big eleven sufficient of the
fine points of the game to make them a
formidable aggregation. Signal practice,
rather than scrimmage, is what the big
fellows nted and that is what the coaches
are giving them. Saturday's game with
Multnomah wm a grilling contest and
several of the players are slightly the
wori>e for it. A few of the varsity men
peemed to be trained a little too fine and
it is feared that they may break over
and go stale before the big game. How
ever, every precaution will be taken to
prevent this and Trainer Moulton will en
deavor to have the men in the rink of
condition when they appear on Richmond
Field' en Saturday.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 9.-
The momentary thrill of hope and confi
dence that struck through the rooters on
the bieachers at the Varslty-Multnomah
game Saturday, when it was announced
that Nevada had defeated California, dleu
away yesterday when the etory of the
Berkeley game was read in the morning
papers and it was learned that California
had fairly outclassed the Sagebrush team
In every part of the game except trickery.
The Nevada eleven proved itself almost
the equal of the cardinal team In its
game here three weeks ago. and since the
former is supposed to have improved
greatly after its contest with the Stan
ford team, the contrast In the real ability
of the two elevens in the Berkeley game
is not particularly encouraging to the
Stanford rooters.
STANFORD IS DOWNCAST
Fails to Find Hope in Defeat of
Berkeley by Nevada.
Hsrry Hudson, v.ho limped off the field
with an injured log three weeks ago, was
on the field in his football suit for the
first time Fince the injury. He did not
mix in the playing against the second
e:even, but will probably go back to his
old place at right end to-morrow.
Secret practice was resumed at the
oval this afternoon. The players, stung
a Mttlo by Saturday's defeat and realiz
ing that they must "get together," ran
around and tackled with a snap and vim
that was good to see. Whipple and Mini
were tried out for backs most of the
time, and the chances are that they will
go into the game first next Saturday.
Korse played fullback and More at quar
ter, the rest of the line being the same
as bsuÂ£L
&o. taking out all the bad luck, as the
varsity team calls it, and putting in a
littio of the good end mixing it with im
proved playinp. the critics of the Berke
ley campus feel that the chances for vlc
tcry are with California and that the
Starford rooster will be flopping around
with his head off next Saturday about 4
o'clock.
Five minutes after the play began Cali
fornia had Nevada on the one-yard line.
The bill would have benn shoved over the
line but for somebody mistaking the sig
nals. That would have been six points.
Nevada could not gain through Califor
nia's line. In fact, she only made her
ground once bf sides Steckle's long run.
That should have been enough to prevent
California trying for the field goal in
the first half and three others in the sec
ond half, because she could have made
her distance all along. This was demon
strated near the end of the second half
when California plowed great holes In the
Nevada line. The team w^uld have kept
it up and won but for int- penalties for
off-side play and Overall's wanting to try
fcr goal because he thought there was so
little time left.
On the offensive and defensive Califor
nia played all around Nevada, even
though the score does tell a different
story. She may not have had backs
in offeiirlve work equal to the rest of the
team, but the line was at Us best. And if
it should come about that California and
Nevada meet againâ well, the Berkeley
team e^js the score "will be the other
way.
liEBKELKT, Nov. 9.â Instead of being
blue and disheartened over last Satur
day's defeat at the bands of the Nevada
University eleven, as most people think,
the students at the University of Califor
nia have more confidence In their tram to
win than they did before Saturday. The
leellng is prevalent that California
played a better game than Nevada did.

PRESCOTT, Ariz.. Nov. 9. â Bernard
Dolly and W. D. Berry, two young men
employed in the Kashrord-Burmister
Co.'b department store here, quarreled to
day over the time a certain grocery order
was taken.
Dolly called Berry a liar and was knock
ed down. Dolly then drew a revolver and
shot Berry three times. iiÂ§Sv*Â£
Two bullets took effect in the arm and
the third was prevented from entering
the heart by the thick wad of rubber It
cut from the clothing. Dolly was arrested
and was released on bail. Berry may re
cover.
Special Dlepatch to The Call,
It is now said that little doubt exists
but that The Fiddler, which won at Mor
ris Park some weeks ago, and over whose
victory a big clean-up was made in the
pool rooms, was a "ringer. As a prepara
tion for the race, the horse is said to
have worked a mile down at Brighton
Beach in 1:41; the first three-quarters in
1:13*4. The original The Fiddler couldn't
work Eix furlongs In 1:1314 down the side
of Mount Tamalpais with roller skates on
and a storage battery, McNamara might
do It. The latter horse is now on a trip
around the world and may winter In Cal
ifornia, or possibly Nevada, as he did last
season.
Bob Smith, who handled Articulate
throughout his Eastern campaign, is back
In California again. Bob's horses have
been here for more than a fortnight.
Another carloaa of horses from St.
L<ouis got in at Oakland yesterday.
Among them were The Buffoon, Lou
Clieveden and Conlan, owned by Â«T M.
McDowell, and Virgie d'Or and Dan
Giovler, the property of W. W. Becker.
Glennevis and two or three others owned
by W. Durker were passengers In the
same car.
Sam Morton, owner of Dodle S, C. B.
Campbell and several other useful horses,
brought out the promising lightweight
rider. H. Booker.
There s:re material increases in the long
distance events, such as the Waterhouse
cup and the Thornton stake.
The f ntries represent some of the high
est class horses in all sections of the
country and fine fields should contend for
the rich stakes.
The following comparison will show the
increase in entries for the principal
stakes this season over the season of 1902:

Jockey Haack; a very clever light
weight, formerly with the Goughacres
stable, arrived yesterday. After leaving
the New York tracks Haack rode with
marked success on the Canadian circuit.
Walter Jennings has secured the ser
vices of Jack Martin, one of the stars of
the metropolitan tracks. Jack was out
this way a few seasons ago with the sta
ble of Alex Shields, when he was consid
ered an infant prodigy.
Charles Boots states that Tiny Williams
will probably do the riding for the firm
of Boots & Hollenheck. "Teen" is an old
timer, but can still do about 106 pounds
in the paddle. .
For the $10,000 Burns handicap 134 nomi
nations were made, while last season
93 horses 1 were named.
The Kollansbee handicap is a close sec
ond. With 117, against 112 for last season.
Third on the list comes the JLissak han.
dicap, the total being 144. Last season it
was 98. , _y
The entries for the stakes of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club were announced yes
terday and show a material Increase in
numbers, there being: 400 more than for
any previous season in the history of rac
ing on the coast. Another illustration of
the interest taken in the. sport is that
fuUy 25 per cent more owners have made
nominations than ever before.
The event that received ' the most en
tries is the Adam Andrew selling stake.
It has a total of 14S, while Jast year 123
were named.

The case of Michael Nlhlll, charged with
the murder of Mrs. Benefrieda Baker In a
saloon at Howard and Russ streets on
April 21, came up for trial In Judge Cook's

Harding Put Under Bonds.
Charles M. Harding, collection agent,
who was arrested on complaint of Ru
dolph Schultz, 238 Kearny street, on a
charge of threats to kill, was put under
bonds of $3000 by Judge Conlan yesterday
to keep the peace. There is a similar
charge pending against him on complaint
of Jules Gamage, collection agent.
Some of the counties did not report the
list of exhibits they have collected for the
world show or mention the amount of
space they deemed would be required to
install them properly. Some counties re
sorted to the Yankee method of answer
ing the leading question that was sent to
them by the Commissioners' by asking
others. For instance, some asked about
the amount of space that would be given
to Los Angeles or Alameda or some other
county that is expected to show up well.
This situation left the Commissioners
just where they were before, bo far as al
lotting the space to the counties was con
cerned. One county demanded 2000 square
feet of space. Others had large ideas.
The Commissioners thought and thought.
Finally they determined to send to every
county that has indicated an intention to
show In the collective California exhibit
in the Agriculture building a letter call-
Ing for both the plans of Installation and
also the lists of exhibits that have been
prepared. Commissioners Filcher and
Wiggins have both had wide experience
in the installation of exhibits at world's
fairs. When they see the installation
plans that have been devised by the re
spectlve'countles* they will at once be able
to judge, considering at the same time
the array of separate Â«ounty exhibits,
Just what space ought to be allotted to
each county.
Little has been said about the matter,'
but the fact is that the space that Cali
fornia is to have in the Agriculture build
ing is not finally determined. The amount
is fixed quite definitely, but there are
other questions concerning it. Although
the St. Louis buildings collectively em
brace a greater area than those erected
for any other exposition, they will be
crowded, and the management of the ex.
position, finding the demands upon their
room greater than at first appeared to.be
probable are turning, every way to fee
what can be done.
Counties of California that are intend
ing to make their resources known
through the medium of the St. Louis Ex
position .are now jockeying for space.
Two California Commissioners and one
secretary to St. Louis have corrugated
foreheads and the look of care unmistak
ably shades their eyes. Two or three
weeks ago it was supposed that by this
time the exhibiting counties of California
would have sent In to the Commissioners
an exact account of the space that they
would severally require In the collective
Collfornla exhibit to be made in the agri
cultural building. Last week Commis
sioner Wiggins came up from Los An
geles to consider such returns, In com
pany with Commissioner Filcher and Sec
retary Willis. The trio had a surprise
which has necessitated a new course of
action.

H. O. Cummins of Boston, manager of
the Middle Creek Gold Mining Company
of Shasta County, made a hurried trip to
this city Sunday for the avowed purpose
of causing the arrest of a young man on
charges of forgery and perjury. Arriving
at the Palace Hotel ho immediately placed
himself in communication with a private
detective agency and In a few hours he
had succeeded in locating the young man
for the punishment of whom his hur
ried trip down from Redding had been
designed. But when he had his man in
hand, Cummins, suddenly realizing that
the nrrest of the accused would result
In humiliation to the latter's family, the
members of which are prominent in
Shasta, relented after warning the young
fellow to leave town at once.
According to a statement made by Cum
mins he had been negotiating for a bond
on a mining property in Shasta County
owned by residents of Napa Junction and
he finally delegated Harry Page to come
to this city and secure a deed to the prop
erty. With the necessary purchase price
Page came to San Francisco, but Instead
of Journeying up to Napa Junction and
paying over the money and securing the
deed he Inscribed the signatures of the
parties to the document and mailed it
back to Cummins, with the statement that
the transaction had been effected. A fa
miliarity with the writing of the man
and jeife at Napa Junction, with whom he
had already had some correspondence,
aroused the suspicions of Cummins that
the signatures on the deed were not gen
uine and an inquiry by wire developed the
fact that young Page had not been to
that place.
It was on receipt of this news that
Cummins hurried to this city, and with
the aid of his detective located Page at
the Golden West Hotel. Finding that de
nials were of no avail, the young man con
fessed his offense, and after being de
tained for a time was permitted to leave
town. Yesterday Cummins went to Napa
Junction and secured a new deed to tho
property. . â¢

PLANS ARREST OF AN
AGENT, BUT RELENTS
Assessor Dr. Washington Dodge, speak
ing yesterday in reference to the payment
of taxes, said:
Taxpayers art finding that their taxes this
year are greatly increased over last yÂ«>ar. This
Is the causa of considerable comment In the
Tax Collector's office, which Is daily thronged
with citizen* peeking their tax bills. Few
soem to understand that this is the result of
the roce.it action of the State Board of Equali
sation at Sacramento in raising my figures as
Assessor cf San Francisco. It will be remem
btrecl that the Btate board, against my very
vigorous protest, increased the assessment of
all property in San Francisco for this year
nearly one-third. In addition to this raise.
thÂ« State tax rate Is very much higher this
year than last year. Our taxpayers have ex-
Governor Gage to thank for this. It win be
remembered that JuPt prior to his campaign
he managed to eecure the abnormally low tax
rate of 33 cents. This unjustifiable rate neces
sitated an unusually high rate this year to
provide for the deficiencies caused by the for
mer rate.
Thus the State tax rate this year Is 58
cents per $100 against 38 cents last year.
This fact together' with the raise In the as
sessed value of all property in San Francisco,
as made by the State board, has greatly in
crrased taxes this year. It is feared that
many taxpayers will become delinquent, as
the time Is very i-hort In which taxes can be
tiaid â¢without delinquency. This Is due to the
fact that tax bills are nearly one month later
than usual owing to the delay caused by figur
ing out the Increase made by the State board.
All taxes will be delinquent on. November 30,
when a penalty of 15 per cent will be added.
I unite with the Tax Collector in requesting
all taxpayers to secure their tax bills at the
earliest possible moment, in order to prevent
confusion and errors.

Responsible for the Raise
in Rates.

AV. Keddie, charged with subornation of
perjury, came to an abrupt termination
yesterday in the United States District
Court, when Bert Schleslnger annoupced
that tho defense would not offer any tes
timony and would submit the case with
out argument. First Assistant United
States District Attorney Banning also
submitted his case without argument, and
an adjournment was taken until 11 o'clock
thls"mdr'ning, when the jury will be

Miss Helen; Keddie, "daughter of Arthur
W. Keddie, was the first witness called.
Her statement was that she Â¦ signed an
application on June 3, 1901, for a quarter
section of timber land in Sierra County.
; Her fathe^, James .M/' Erigle, and Mrs.,
Engle; were in the land office at the time,
the Engles filing applications also. She
paid her expenses; and the cost of the
land out of "her own money. She intended
to hold the land' until she could eell II
at a profit, which she afterward did to
John H. Engle of Philadelphia, a brother
of Â¦ defendant James M. Engle. The first
deed to. John H. Engle she destroyed be
cause Uhere was a good deal of talk at
the time to the effect that a person, would
not have a right to sell timber land after
having purchased it from the Govern
ment, but afterward, feeling that she
had a> right to do so, she made a second
deed and sold the land to John H. Engle.

WITNESSES NOT SUBPENAED.
The names of Mrs. Corolynne _E. Bat
telle, George Stimers, Creed T. Hill,
Stephen Whlttlesey and William S. Mead
were called at the door and they failed
to answer. Bert Schleslnger, on behalf
of the defendants, protested against the
action of First Assistant United States
District Attorney In calling witnesses
who had not been subpenaed. Then Mr.
Banning placed United States Marshal
John H. Shine on the stand to prove that
he had attempted to find the missing wit
nesses, but had failed. Mr. Schlesinger
proceeded to cross examine the witness
but had not completed the first question
when Judge de Haven rapped sharply
on his desk with a lead pencil, peremp
torily ordered the witness to leave the
stand.
Captain J. H. Roberts, a wealthy resi
dent of Sacramento, was called for the
prosecution, and in answer to questions by
Mr. Banning stated that he was presi
dent of the Boca and Loyalton Railroad
Company, now known as the Roberts
Lumber Company. Mr. Engle, he said,
was a real estate agent dealing princi
pally in patented land, and for such land
sold to the witness by Engle the wit
ness paid Engle a commission of 50
cents per acre, but he could not remem
ber how many acres he had purchased of
Engle. He' hrn*Anever be^n ore the land
and knew nothing about it. The Lewis
brothers had charge of the lumber mill
and interests, and the witness was devot

It may be assumed that the annual re
ceipts at a 5-cent fare will be about 51S0,

out the consent of the municipality. But
little cf the roadbed should be considered
serviceable for further use. The future
importance of Geary street as a main
avenue of approach to the Richmond dis
trict makes it appear inadvisable to set
it apart as Â» boulevard.
ANTJTJAL RECEIPTS.
"It 1* not probable, without a specific
order frora the Board of Supervisors, that
the roadbed of the Geary street com
pany's pystPm will be removed from the
street. It may be safely assumed that
the roadbed and subway are at the dis
position of the municipality. The city
may therefore, on the expiration of the
franchise, be considered to be in posses
sion and In control of the roadbed on
which a cable car system could be ope
rated or the road could be converted into
a conduit underground electric road."
Four propositions can be considered:
The city to take possession of the road
bed, lease or purchase the power-house,
carhoupe and car? from the present own
ers and continue the operation of the road
es a cable system; the city to take pos
session of the track system and lea?e the
Fame to the highest bidder; the city to
eell a new franchise to the highest bid
der for a term of twenty-live years; the
railroad company to be required to re
move the roadbed and repave the streets
and Geary street then to be declared a
boulevard. Â¦ â¢
"For power to operate the road electric
current is to be purchased from any of
the large electric companies. In all three
projects an estimated cost of $50,000 Is
allowed for the introduction of storage
batteries in connection with the motors.
The estimated expense for the year for
the first project Is J1&6.37:.; second project.
$197.eT; third project, $156,340."
In his report City Engineer Grunsky
pays:
TO PURCHASE POWER.
Two reports bearing upon the future
operation of the Geary-street railway
were filed with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday by the Board of Public Works.
One was from. City Engineer Grunsky
relative to the disposition of the road on
the expiration of Its franchise and the
ether from J. C. II. Stut, who was em
jjloyed as consulting mechanical engineer
to report upon the feasibility and cost
cf converting the rystem into an electric
road with overhead trolley.
Stut estimates that the cost of such a
Fystem. on Geary street from Kearny
street to Point Lobos avenuo to Fifth
avenue to Golden Gate Park will be
J40LS2O. If the road were extended to
Ter.th avenue the cost will be $425,920.
The coct of an electric read with under
ground conductors is fixed at $435,400.
Â£tut reports that a good feature of the
r.rst project mentioned is its comparative
cheapness as compared with the other
two propositions, but Fays that an unde
sirable feature Is its terminus at Fifth
avenue, too far removed from the amuse
ment centers. The second project over
comes this undesirable feature, but would
cost more as .8'.Â»S miles of new double
track must be built from Fifth to Tenth
avenues and along Tenth avenue to the
park.
The third project involves the conver
sion of the present cable road into a xnod
<rn up-to-date conduit electric road from
Kearny street to Fifth avenue and from
Fifth avenue to Tenth avenue to the park
a new overhead trolley road would be re
quired. The entire road could be made
<onduit entirely, but on account of the
first cost it may be found advisable not
to do so. The report concludes:

to the Police Committee.
Auditor Baehr appeared before the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee yesterday
and stated that he would decline to pay
two judgment demands in favor of Mar
tin Collman for $&04 and Joseph Musto for
J] 1.502, drawn on St. Mary's Park fund,
unless the .promoters of the project file a
guarantee to contribute the additional
money necessary for the acquisition of
the entire tract of land necessary for the
park. Baehr explained that of the origi
nal fund of $125,000 there now remains the
sum of $54,092 â¬S. The sum of $45,907 32
was paid to merchant creditors under a
stipulation that the Board of Supervisors
would appropriate $50,000 In two equal in
stallments to replace the amount named.
One Judgment of $25,000 had also been
raid, and Baehr said that he wanted
some essurance that the city would not be
liable for any Judgments in excess of
$125,000. Auditor Baehr saw Father Wy
man, one of the stanch promoters of the
project, who stated that the sum required
would certainly be raised by private sub
scription. With the understanding that
the entire square will be thus acquired.
Auditor liat-hr said he would sign the
two judftmvrit demands.
The Pacific Humane Society filed a com.
munication yesterday with the Board of
Supervisors alleging that H. O. irwin, the
poundmaster appointed by Mayor
Schmitz. has negligently conducted the
office in that he has neglected and still
neglects to impound large stock running
at large, and further that Irwin has been
guilty of malfeasance in office in Issuing
leceipte for money on blanks other than
those provided by law. The society fur
ther alleges that Irwin has received sums
of money as fees for which he has not
accounted. The society petitions for a
hearing on the charges and asks that the
management of the pound be put in the
hands of the society.

Fenm Grove P. O., Cal.
"After four years' suffering from loss of blood
from my bladder, caused by a bleeding- tumor,
anil after many doctors had failed to cure me,
I was sent to & hospital in San Francisco to be
operated upon. I was so weak from loss of
blood that the hospital surgeon informed my
wife that there was little chance to save my
life. It ' was decided that before undergoing
the dangerous Buryical operation it would be
best to try the Electro-Chemlc treatment, so
my wife took me to the Electro-Chemlc Insti-
tute, 118 Grant avenue, and placed me under
the Electro-Chemlc treatment. In three
months' time I was perfectly cured. The loss
of blood had stopped. I had regained my lost
fleBh and strength and I was able to do my
heavy work in the hay fields."

The schooner XV. F. Garms. which on Sun
day was towed Into Portland with her rudder
disabled. Is the fourth of a fleet of vessels
built by Charles G. White of Everett, Wash
ington, to come to grief through mishap to
steering apparatus. Whether victims of a
Â«-ries of unfortunate coincidences or whether
the vessels have been constructed on faulty
principles, the marine insurance companies
that have noted and paid for the list of acci
dents are not prepared to say. The schooners
J. H. Lunsmann and Otelia Pcderson and the
barkentine Aurora all .came from the Everett
builder's yard. The Otelia Pederson's rudder
carried away in the China seas and the vessel
was abandoned, to become a total loss later
on the island of Formosa. Shortly afterward
the J. H. Lunsmann's rudder lost Its useful
ness and she finished her voyage untler Jury
steering gear. The Aurora was compelled to
put Into Sydney on account of the breaking
of her rudder and now the XV. V. Garms adds
the fourth chapter to the tale of misadventure.

In th<? course cf his lecture the speaker
said that it is certain that the use of ra
dium as a. test for threatened blindness
will serve thousands who would otherwise
be condemned to permanent darkness.
Mr. Harrison was heartily applauded
when he concluded his lecture. Many of
his listeners came to him afterward and
thanked him for the knowledge he im
parted to them in his lecture.
Mr. Harrison has made a deep study
of his subject ancT he talked entertaining
ly on his researches. He traced its dis
<o\-ery and told what had been done with
this practicaily unknown and precious
substance.
W!l!iam Greer Harrison, president of
the Olympic Club, read an interesting
paper on "Radium" last evening in the
free reading-room 'and library for the
blind at Fourth and Clara streets. The
lecture was given under t'ne auspices of
the Women's Auxiliary, of which Mrs.
Josephine de Greayer is president.
In the audience which filled the room
were a number of the blind and they lis
tÂ«-ned with deep interest to the learned
discourse on the latest scientific discov
ery. They were interested because sci
entists have said that it will be through
the medium ot radium that the blind will
be mude to see.

In making the trip down the coast, of
course, the Southern Pacific Company
furnishes the Ripley special with an en
gineer, whose duty it will be to remain in
the cab with the Santa Fe man and ad
vise the latter as to curves, bridges,
grades and stepping places along the line.
President Ripley, Vice Presidents Ken
dricks and Morton and General Manager
"Wells of the Santa i"e road departed for
Monterey last evening. They will remain
there to-day and then proceed south to
Los Anjreies. So far as the memory of the
local ofScials extends President Ripley's
party Is the first one to ride over the lines
of the Ilarrircan syndicate in a car hauled
by a foreign engine. The Ripley train yes
terday was not only made up of Santa
Fe cars, but was in tow cf a Santa Fe
engine, brought here from Needles ex
pressly for that purpose. It is usually
the custom cf a'l big railroads to oper
ate all trains and specials over their own
territory with their own engines and
when the representatives of a "foreign"
company arrive wlthm the jurisdiction of
the local concern the latter promptly fur
nishes an engine of Its own to take the
place of the one that brings the special
up to the other company's terminal and
pilots the train over its system. This has
always been the custom on the Southern
Pacific Company's iines end would per
haps have been followed out yesterday
had not President Ripley wired for one of
hi;- own company's locomotives. Having
plenty of motive power available on this
coast and fully appreciating the present
predicament of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, whose supp'y of locomotives has
been lately insutlioient to meet the re
quirements of overland traffic. President
Rjpley suggested the advisability of using
a Santa Fe engine, one of which was
hurried up from the Needles and trans
ported across the bay for service on the
coast line of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
After taking the Kerr to an anchorage
In Tucker Bay, the Escort No. 2 returned
to aid the Georgian. She finally pulled
the stranded barge into aeep water and
took her to Union Bay. She is leaking
badly and will have to be either beached
or docked.
After the two barges had knocked
around for a time the hawser on the
Georgian sr.aDDed and she was carried
toward the Texada Island shore. Hav
ing to care for the Kerr, the Escort No. 2
could not go to the rescue of the Geor
gian and the craft finally landed upon
the shore, where she bumped about on
the rocks.
The barges got beyond the control of
the tug while in Sabine Channel, and the
result was a collision caused by the Kerr
running across the bows of the Georgian.
The barges came together with a crash
in the high running sea which prevailed
at the time.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 9.â The tug
Escort No. 2, which left Vancouver yes
terday for Union Bay, with the barges
Georgian and Kerr in tov.-, had a strenu
ous time in last night's storm.
F. Delgado was Spanish stenographer in
the Manila Court of Land Registration
and during the stormy times through
which his land lately passed was attached
to the staff of General Luna. J. Ramos
was a deputy governor of Talbac and H.
Valberas was for a time Governor Taft's
confidential clerk. A number of them have
been schoolteachers, and all seem to be
thoroughly alive to the value of an Amer
ican education. v
After becoming acclimated at Los An
geles and before being distributed among
the schools and colleg-es of the country
the students will be . taken to the St.
Louis Exposition and allowed to observe
some of the wonders there displayed.

sometimes occurs. The heights given are in

Coast Survey charts, ercept when a minus ( â )
sign precedes the height, and then the number
given is subtracted from the depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference is the mean

Ninety-six Filipino students arrived
here yesterday on the liner Korea, "they
are here as wards of Uncle Sam, at whose
expense they crossed the Pacific and from
whose pocketbook they may draw at the
rate of $500 a year until such time as they
"have acquired the kind of an education
with which the average American boy Is
armed for the battle of life. They are in
charge of William A. Sutherland, in
whose care they were intrusted by the
Insular Government. The Grand Hotel
sheltered them last night and to-day they
will be taken to Los Angeles, where they
will remain, attending the schools of the
southern city, until acclimated, when
they will be distributed throughout the
country.
These student3 were selected from
among the brightest of the youths of the
archipelago. They all speak English of a
fairly useful kind, Spanish and their .^na
tive tongue. Six provinces are represent
ed In this band of students, and most of
the young men are memhers of good fam
ilies. Some of them bear names distin
guished in their own land and not un
known in the busy Occident, and a few
of them have occupied positions of im
portance.
Will Be Educated in Ameri

AYtr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. Â».â The cotsticned llqui- |
Â¦ Â¦â¢:Â¦ t. in the United Â£tateÂ« Steel securities j
again overshadowed the whole stock market \
to-41a.y. The sympathetic response In the gen- ,
ml market was very (light and the effect
of the Â»peclal movement in United States SteÂ»l
was rather to repress the trading', than to de
press the tone. The n-.arket as a whole was
extremely sluggish and unimportant. The
condition tn the tnoney rr.a-V. t had Its share
in rep; CTrtnr activity, and the traditional dis
position rn Wall vtrvet to pause and take ob
servation* cpon the acvezsbiicg of Congress
was alK> ev.fjent. There was a feeling that
the procÂ«*<Jir.gs in Congress sÂ»y take a turn
to which active Interest rr.aj attach la Wall
vtrvrt. All tfcrve of the active securities of
â¢ - - United States Steel Corporation during the
day fell loww thaa ever be-fcr*. thÂ«Â» preferred
rtock at S0%. -* â¢ common at 1O% and the
r : bonds at <" . In the case of the bonds
*nl the common trtock the previous low record*
L>*tÂ»> barely shaded at these figures and the
'trsr.sactlons in them were not particularly
noticeable. In the preferred stock, bxnrever.
there vu a constant outpouring of offerings
a.U fay aad an unending ruccessicm of offerings
Â¦ cf 1000-efcare blocks and upward. The special
soure* cf this selling was much of a mys
tery at :.'A times, but thÂ« manner cf the **;!
â¢.rSg gav* color to the rcrpoiltlon that a very
large account was In prxÂ»oe*Â« of liquidation.
Officials cf the corporation denied the numer
ous rrpcTts of heavy ctru In price*, but this
did ntt prevent the general conviction that
Trices throughout the trade would be readjust
ed to the new basis fixed by the reduction In
â¢teÂ»l bUl*U. In a general way It was argued
that since the restraint tinder the rise of price
cf Â»t*Â«l had availed to conserve the consump
tive <3Â»rrAr.'5 there was reason to doubt wbether
the iÂ«1ce reduction will restore the demand.
Tne street was flooded with rumors and calcu
lations bas*<5 en theories a* to the elect ca
the eamir^s c? the rorporatioa and Ma cons*
qnent dividend paying power on the sew baÂ«U
of prices. AH of this was of course based
ca very iB-.jwrfect data, but was nevertheless
an fffectire influence upm sentiment regard
ing the *ecurf-ie*. There was a special up
ward â¢ movement in New York corporation
docks wtlch Â«w unexplained. The Colorado
miners' strike affected some of the stacks ef
the corpora tlocs concerned. The epedal 'beavj
-Â«Â¦*Â« of Pecr.rrlvania due to the expanding
vorcnie of bond Issues by subsidiary compa
r.ies and the death cf a prominent Philadelphia
capitalist, tt was raid, might also be a con
tributory cause.

CHICAGO. Nor. 9.â December wheat opened
*4Â©%o lower at 7Sc to 77%c under the influ
ence of easy cables and liberal Northwest re
ceipts, together with tha fact that a la^ge
quantity of Dulath wheat was reported on its
way to this market. Heavy shipments and an
unexpectedly large increase in the visible aug
mented the initial pessimism and throughout
the remainder of the session there was little
demand save that coming from shorts with
profits in sight. All opUons closed weak. De
cember down *ic at 77>3Â®77%c.
Anticipation of a bearish Government report
to-morrow, easy cables and favorable weather
depressed corn, but the market was not an
active one. December closed %c down at 33Â»ic.
With increasing receipts and a slow cash
demand as a bearish basis, oats responded
readily to the wheat weakness early, but
steadied at the bottom and closed with some
of the early loss recovered. December %c down
at 34%c. . .
Buying of December lard for the foreign
account was the main support of the provision
market, although reports of a decreasing hog
supply were also influential. The dose was
firm, January pork 7%-c higher, lard 7%e up
and ribs 1>S7%c improved.

MANILA, Nov. 9.â Major General Leon
ard Wood reports that the Moros of Jolo,
from whom he has been expecting trouble,
have at last revolted, j On October 30 a
body of them attacked a battery of ar
tillery under command of Captain D. J.
Romboughs, and firing was kept up all
day, with little effect, only two of the
American force being wounded during the
engagement. General Wood left to-day
for the. scene of the disturbance. He is
quoted as having said that prompt ac
tion would be necessary or the trpuble
would reach larger proportions. A long
expected Issue has been raised, he said,
which he was prepared to settle Imme
diately. The garrison at Jolo is being
strongly reinforced.
The troublesome Sultan Barca of Lanao
has Just sent in a letter of submission to
General Wood, and conditions in this
portion of the island are. excellent, with
the exception of Jolo.
A mass meeting has Just been held here,
attended" by residents of all nationalities,
which has Indorsed Executive Secretary
A. W. Fergusson for the\ vacancy on the
Philippine Commission which will be cre
ated upon the retirement of Governor

Harry Gllson, who desired to convey the
Impression that he hem a position In the
editorial department of a newspaper, but
who was found to be a linotype operator
and friendly to the saloon man, was next
called. He gave Simpson a good reputa
tion.
M. A. Lang of the Wellarid Brewery
said he knew nothing of Simpson except
in a business way, and that he paid his
bills promptly. Lang refused to express
a private opinion. tv.-: '
John . F. Murray, who leases the cigar
store 'in front of Simpson's saloon, never
heard any evil "of the saloon*, man, and
Hugo Fritz, a uauor drummer, said that
he had always settled his accounts when
ever he agreed to do so. â¢
F.- Andrews, â¢ another . linotype operator
who frequents the saloon,- said that Simp
son was a â¢ good ;; man.' ' Â¦ 'Â¦ , '
Adjournment was then taken until Wefli
Simpson then attempted to vindicate his
character.by the testimony of several.wit
nesses. The first was Henry Clay, a bar
tender who had been in his employ. Clay
gave his employer a good reputation, but
finally admitted that he . .Â»ad heard of
Simpson being mixed up In ' a swindling
game in Ventura; . that he had also un
derstood he , was the principal in a $15,000
gold brick swindle in Los -Angeles, but
he did not remember that Simpson had
been made the defendant in an adultery
case and that his father had put up
money tp get the complaining witness out
of the country.
Captain Spillane was then put on the
stand and contradicted Murphy. He said
that he had censured the patrolman for
not making more arrests and avoiding the
complaints that came in about women,
and that Murphy's excuse for not exercis
ing his authority was that he was follow
ing the Instructions of Wolf. â¢'.-Â¦
SIMPSON'S REPUTATION.
Walsh averred that he had been warned
to look out for himself, as he would be
done up. Patrolman Peter Murphy was
then called and questioned with regard
to a conversation he is alleged to have
had with Captain Spillane. Murphy was
asked if he had ever told the captain
that he did not arrest women because
Wolf had forbidden him to do so, and he
replied that he had never made such a
statement. . :
Patrolman John F. Walsh was then re
called and denied the conversation attrib
uted to him by Patrolman Cavanaugh and
five brother officers on the morning after
the first hearing of the case, in which it
was alleged that he said he intended to
break Wolf. Walsh admitted that he dis
cussed the case with Patrolman Brown en
a street car and that Brown told him
that all the policemen would be "down"
on him for having given such testimony.
Walsh "further said that Wolf had told
him in the month of May to permit wom
en of ill-fame on the streetâ that there
would be money in it for him. Walth
claims that he replied that he did not
wish to make money in that way and the
Incident closed. In June Wolf again
broached the subject, but gave as a rea
son this time that the women were use
ful to the department !n giving infor
mation, and that by driving them from
the streets the milliner, dressmaker and
shoe dealers would suffer. Wolf had
brought Walsh before the Commission
ers but three days before on a charge of
being absent from his beat.
WALSH ACCUSES SERGEANT.
The sergeant's testimony was a contra
diction of the charges made against him.
He said he had never solicited money,
never received any nor had he been lax in
his duty. He said that Simpson's saloon
was the worst of its character in the dis
trict and that he had much trouble with
it; owing to the fact that patrolmen were
negligent in giving him information. It
then transpired that there had been some
correspondence between the PolicÂ» De
partment of this city and the police of
Los Angeles, but that Chief Wittman was
absent from the city when it was ex
changed, hence had no knowledge of it.
A letter from the Los Angeles police was
introduced in evidence. It was of a char
acter sustaining Simpson, rather than in
juring him, and said that he had on many
occasions given the police of the southern
city Information.
The first deposition read was made by
Edward F. Dishman, a newspaper re
porter on the Los Angeles Times. Dish
man related that Simpson's saloon in that
city was one of the lowest type; that it
came to be regarded as a dive, and that
the proprietor was constantly :n trouble
and under the surveillance of the author
ities. Then objection was madÂ« to the
depositions on the grouni that they did
not prove "truth or veracity"' and they
were submitted to the attorneys to elimi
nate the objectionable features.
Captain of Police Anderson gave Wolf
a good reputation; "said that he was a
brave, active and intelligent officer and
had done much work in the section allot
ted to him. Lieutenant Colby verified
this, and said that Wolf had never shown
discrimination In matters regarding po
licemen or saloon men. Sergeant Maho
ney averred that the sergeant's reputation
was good; that he rendered efliclent ser
vice, and that 'officers had * complained
that he pressed them too hard with their
duties. Among the latter was Patrolman
Walsh. Sergeant Wolf then took ths
stand.
SERGEANT WOLF TESTIFIES.
The case of Sergeant R. A. Wolf,
charged with having taken money from
George B. .Simpson, a saloonkeeper at tie
corner of Mission and Seventh Â¦ streets,
â¢was continued yesterday afternoon at a
special session of the Police Commission
ers. Testimony as to the character of
the complaining witness was given by
men who had heard it discussed and some
depositions regarding Simpson's Los An
geles record were withheld until certain
statements which are not pertinent to
the matter can be eliminated by consent
of the attorneys representing both sides.
During the session yesterday Police
man John F. Walsh, whose testimony
was strongly against the accused officer
at the first hearing of the case, made sev-'
eral additional statements that* were ex
ceedingly damaging to the defendant. Pa
trolman Peter Murphy made statements
that- were flatly contradicted by Captain
Spillane. Then the case was postponed
until to-morrow' afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Frank Gllger, a salesman, testified that
Simpson had been mixed up in a deal by
which Japanese women were swindled in
Ventura and that he had caused his
father much trouble in getting him out of
various difficulties. E. B. Doyle, who was
Simpson's former partner in tfie saloon
business, said that he gave up his inter
est because the place became too rough
for him. John Purvis, -a foreman at the
new Postofflce building, had heard 5 the
saloon man's reputation discussed and
said that it was not good.. H. M. Ohms,
a contractor, gave similar testimony.
Charles E. Wunder, a breweryman, said
that Simpson's record in Los Angeles was
bad. It was then admitted that sixty
eight saloon men in Wolfs district would
testify that they had never paid the ser
geant any money and the matter, of depo
sitions taken in Los Angeles was taken
up. ,'\ '

"AT THE OPERA,"
The first subject selected could scarcely be recognized 1
by the half-tone above, on account of the impossibility of
showine the exquisite coloring of the original by this
process. _. r
Copies of the original which are to be given away are
displayed in prominent places throughput the city. Don't
fail to inspect one.
"At the Opera" has a decidedly pleasing flavor in its
composition. It depicts a beautiful, buddine younc
woman, rich in all the attractiveness of her young life,
and typically an American Girl.
The ideal Grecian profile,' the rich coloring of her au-
burn hair, the carelessly draped opera gown, exposing
' her. delicately chiseled neck and bust, all combine to eive
the study a distinct character. The background could not
be more aptly described than by the saying â it's Bry-
son's â as in his execution and handling of colors he
seems to impart to his creations a bit of life and dash
seldom attained by contemporary artists.
REMEMBERâ The publisher has no possible way of
knowing just howj many of this set to order; "the best he
can do is to guess; and as it will take weeks for addi-
tional orders to be refilled, it seems proper to suggest
that every one wanting this beautiful "Series in Gold"
ought to order from his carrier, newsdealer or 'phone
this office in ample time. The demand will be tremen-
dous.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 9.â James Bentley, a
brother of the Rev. Robert Bentlsy, died
in this city yesterday, aged 48 years. Ha
was a native of Illinois and came to the
coast six years ago. after engaging in
newspaper work in Chicago. He was con
nected for a time with the local press
here, and was also secretary of the So
ciety for the Prevention cf Cruelty to
Animals. A few years ago he conducted
a newspaper at Sutter Creek, where he
contracted a disease which developed lnta

Speaking- of the chances i for saving the
pharles Nelson, Captain Gunderson said:
'/I do not think-there is much danger, of
her sinking, unless she- loses, the lumber
forward. There Is enough there to keep
her afloat and if the weather moderates
it will not be washed" away." The line
which the Aurelia had on her was a small
one and she was making. little headway
with her tow. I did not want to leave the
Nelson, but. I w'anted first to save the
lives of my passengers and crew.. We had
only two boats and the . situation was
such that I did not feel Justified in send
ing- both Â«of- them away. and retaining any
part of the crew. We then would have
had --no -means rof 1 escape.' To' have
launched only one boat would have made
it badly overcrowded and probably re
sulted disastrously" in' the condition of
the sea." . â¢ -
Â¦ The Sea Rover went on her course and
in a few minutes' sighted the abandoned
schooner in' tow of .the steam, schooner
Aurelia. The tug stood by and offered to
take. the. tew. but the captain of theAu
relia refused to give it up. At that time
the Charles Â¦ Nelson was awash entirely,
except her bow, which was kept up by
the lumber forward. Two hours later the
Sea Rover sighted the ; collier Titanla,
bound from Nanaimo, B. C.,.to San Fran
cisco, and transferred . the rescued .crew
and passengers to. her. Â¦' Â¦â¢â¢ . ; â¢ â¢

About 8 .o'clock Saturday morning the
smoke of the tug Sea Rover was sighted.
Her- captain had se'e-n the two boats from
the pilot-house and was heading for them.
Ho came alongside, and the benumbed
and worn-out : occupants were got on
board the.tug! The sea was still high and
the work â¢ of i transferring the passengers
was difficult. :- The rescued were -warmed
and fed and all- of , them. fell off into the
deep sleep of '.exhaustion. : #
SEA "' BOVEB SIGHTED.
The sea did not appear to- abate during
Friday. - The drenched -and- frozen occu
pants kept a. sharp lookout, for some pass
ing craft that would come to. their assist-,
ahce, but tho day wore on and night came
again without the /sights of aid. ,Moro
dead than alive they â¢ huddled In the
boats, endeavoring to keep warm. Those
who were. able pulled at .the *Â¦ oars and
kept -the boats from drifting away/ from
the* track of paesing vessels. -â¢ Outside of
Philip Bradley, all bore their sufferings
unc'omplainirigly.- It seemed, as .though
the night would never endJ; Again : dawn
broke ahd:no succor, was in sight.' George
Wilson, one 'of the firemen, became de
"llrious shortly b'efore dawn and made re
peated'attempts'-to Jump intothe sea- The
weary, -and: stiffened- derelicts restrained
him with. difficulty.' One.of the.cabln.boys
also became ' delirious, but was not.vio
lent.-Nearly everybody in the two boats,
with the exception of the captain, his two
mates ahefthflfchief engineer, was flighty
at^times. .': ,
The two boats, ond under* the command
of the captain and the other in charge of
the first mate, karr'Kjellin.'cruised near
each- other all during th*t terrible night.
They had ' hoped to be sighted by. some
passing vessel, but daylight dawned with
out succor. There was plenty of food and
water and the boats were not overcrowd
ed. The main difficulty was to keep from
dying of cold. Had the boat which got
away not been recovered the other, boat
could not have contained the entire party
and some' of them would' have had to fe
maln with the schooner.
Ifc was' evident that the vessel was bad
ly waterlogged and could not be navi
gated.- The cabins on- the port side were
gone and both liferafts had -been -washed
away. At this Juncture Captain Gunder
son ordered the two boats; provisioned for
thi-ee ' days and got 'jtlie ; passengers into
them. He wished to stav, by his ship, but
did not feel justified in'' asking his crew
to remain with him so that the other

DEAD WHEN, HE AWAKENS
Fred Johai.sc n, the seaman who ivas
supposed to. have been one of the men
â¢who launched the starboard boat, proved
a poor witness.* - He denied that he had
helped to launch that boat and every
other attempt to get anything of value
from ,hlm was as fruitless as the exami
nation of all tie sailors has been.
j The Inspectors say that the investiga
tion has been one of the hardest ones to
make anything from that they have ever
held. "A marked ignorance of affairs at
tending the wreck, a loss of memory and
an equally marked reticence in answering
questions characterized the testimony
given by all examined. Contradictions. and
admissions were made, tangling matters.
.Whether any charges of perjury will be
preferred against the witnesses in the
case will not be known until the Inspec
tors make known the result of their In
vestigation.
[ Mate Bruce said that he thought the
engines were stopped or he would have
lowered' the "port boat, but would not ad
mit that If the ship hÂ£Â«t not been moving
af the time the boats were launched
they coul 1 have been launched success
fully and more lives s-ived.
Mate Bruce admitted that he had made
but", a. few trips up the northern c#ast
and was unfamiliar with it. He claimed,
however* to know thfe change in the cur
rents at the different times of the year.
Captain Melntyre, when questioned as
to the reliability of his testimony, said
that he was not certain of anything in
connection with the wreck. His memory
was particularly hazy. He was able to
give no good reason for changing his
course so many, times. He could net ac
count for getting seventy fathoms of wa
ter with the lead and line two hours be
fore the- vessel struck. By his figuring,
using merely the log book and chart, he
said he thought he was seven miles off
Cape Blanco.
Captain Mclntyre did. not know yester
day whether the ship'3 engines were ever
stopped. He? said he did- all in his power
to save the lives of those aboard and up
held hfs course in leaving the vessel be
fore,, every one else br saying that ' he
warifeo" to save the passengers and
thought the crew able to look out for
themselves. He thought, however, that
the engines were not going. Captain
Bolles said that it was all nonsense for
him to say that, as the testimony of
every one else was against him.
INVESTIGATION DIFFICULT.
The steamer was lost through the fact
that the officers neslected to make up
their reckonings in the fog the day of
the wreck. Captain Mclntyre admitted
changing his course six times between
Umpqua River bar and Cape Blanco, al
though "the run is practically a straight
one.
If these figures are correct, there were
six more people on the South Portland
than the ship's papers called for. Two
of these were stowaways, so the cap
tain cannot be held responsible for their
.presence on the ship. The other four
were J one passenger and three "work
aways." The captain, being cognizant of
their presence aboard, is culpable for
carrying more souls than the law pre
scribed.
ship was carrying nine more on his vessel
than his papers called for. The general
belief however, despite the sworn state
ments' of Ravens, is that there were forty
passengers, including a child, aboard.

This was Philip Bradley, who claims to
be the grandson of an English admiral.

Stiff and sore and still shivering from
their thirt>'-six hours' vigil in open boats,
the passengers and crew of the aban
doned Charles Nelson arrived in port at
9 o'clock yesterday morning on board the
Tltania. to which they had been trans
ferred from the tug Sea Rover, which had
picked them up.
Safe In port, they began to discuss the
ridiculous features of their perilous voy
aging after tney 'left the schooner, and
it was hard to get any of them to tell of
the thrilling 'hours they. ; spcnt bobbing
about the wide expanse 'of ocean before
they were sighted by the tug Sea RoVer
and transferred to her stanch deck.
LAUGH AT PEBILS.
Gunderson is not much to look at nor
to talk to. He is a tall, rawboned
Swede, and he couldn't tell a story that
would reflect credit on himself if It
meant an appointment to a full admiral
ship in the United States navy. But he
knows the sea and its ways and he knows
what the world demands of a man who
assumes command of a vessel, with pre
cious lives and cargoes under h'.s charge.
He knows that his own safety must be
the last consideration, and with that un
derstanding he has become a skipper.
Therefore It was that when. the collier
Tltania, bearing the thirty-five human be
ings who were on the steam schooner
Charles Nelson when she became, water
logged and abandoned last Thursday
morning were hawsered to the Mission
street wharf and the. rescued party filed

tain Thomas Gunderson of the water
logged and abandoned steam schooner
Charles Nelson. He was the last to leave
the: vessel and before he went he saw
that every one of his passengers and crew
were safely stowed away in the boats. In
fact he would not have left the unman
ageable craft at all except for the. fact
that there were two boats and both of
them were needed for the safety of pas
sengers and crew. At the time a hurri
cane was blowing, but not one life was

The capitalists began the glad new year
with p.nother payment of interest and the
emiles of the bondholders became broad
er. The rainy season passed away and
everything appeared to be taking on n*w
life, except the mines. It was rumored
that all sorts of things would be done
soon, but work at the mines was slack.
June came and went and the bondholders
were fingering .their coupons.
But alas! there was no sign of the usual
payment of interest. The people watched
and waited onlr to learn one sad day
that thev seemed to have lost the prin
cipal and the interest for nineteen years.
It was a hard blow.
The Companla Exploradora de Terrenos
CÂ«rbonlferos en Sonora brought suit un
der its agreement to regain the title to
the coal mines comprised in the 2.500,009
acres of land. Hay ward and his fellow
investors were notified of the lawsuit and
were represented by an agent In the sub
sequent proceedings.
Without any opposition en the part of
the asrcr.t, the contest was decided in
favor of the old company by the Judge
of the Second Court of First Instance.
Tlig original concern once more owned
the mines. Its debts had all been paid.
Mn=. Black, who held 1111.700 worth of
tfce bonds; G. W. Jackson, who whs in
possession of paper calling for $53,000. and
various other Investors were not satisfied.
It was decided accordingly to bring suit
against the local capitalists for principal
and interest. Mrs. Black sues for her
own money and for such other as may
belong to any people who may choose to
defray a lust proportion of the expense
of litigation.
Tht" local firm of Kinley & Kinley is
handling her case. She is at present trav
eling in the East. It is stated that Al
vfnza Kayward Js liable for the amount
of one-half the bond issue and that the
others have each an eighth interest.
â¢A suit has lately been brought by G.
W. Jackson in the Circuit Court against
tho Mercantile Trust Company, which
held a mortgage on tbe property. It Is
not thought that the trust company is
responsible, but it is desired by such a
ruit to cet an opinion as to liability and
use it In the suit brought in the Superior
Court. Why the local capitalists aban
doned possession of the property Is the
problem that is puzzling the plaintiff % r .
The people of tho State of Sonora and in
tact of all Mexico thought that the mines
sliviuld be almost as valuable as If filled
with gold since the rich Americans had
come into the field. Hence there was no
Â«:!ff:ru!ty in floating the bends. The new
Sonora railroad was right at hand and no
apprehension was felt in regard to the
old-time difficulty cf transportation. The
rew company had JSOO.uOO worth of bonds
for itself. It is alleged that the capital
ists floated these to pay the expense of
purchasing new machinery and of opera
tion. Any way. the old holes in the
rarth were made larger and new ones
were dug:.
The bonds were issued in January. 1902.
The coal seemed abundant. New veins
of anthracite rivaling the quality of the
carboniferous deposits of Pennsylvania
â¢were discovered. In July. 1902, the first
installment of interest was paid. The
bondholders smiled and counled theJr
coupons. Everything v.as progressing
swimmingly, except the major part of
the money for operating expenses, and
that was eunk, as appeared later.
SAD DAY DAWNS.
The new corporation began its existence
under the name- of the Mexican Anthra
cite Coal Mining Company and with the
abbreviated name had a correspondingly
*hort Hfp. It was sUpuiated in the arti
cles of isele that the new concern should
pay semi-annual interest on the bonds
and that if it failed 'to do so the right to
operate the coal mines should revert to
the original owners.
Hayward ar.d his associates proposed a
plan of payment not quite so acceptable,
to the sellers as cash in hand, but an
i-gn-finpnt was^ reached after a consider
able amcunt cf barpalninj?. The local
<-Â«pitalists .said that they world pay in
twenty-year bond? bearing interest at 4
per cent. The payment in real money
amounted to $23.<XÂ».X The property was
then bonded to thÂ«* exu-nt of Jl.OW.CV). Of
this amount $700,010 was Riven to the old
company in I pit wni bonds.
PAY. IN BONDS
A suit for Sl.ono.OOO was instituted yes
terday against Alvinza Haywaid, A. J.

and H. CJ. Stevenson. Mrs. Kate J.
lilack, the plaintiff, wanls oniy $111,700 of

desired by a large number of people who
purfhaset] thj bends of a corporation con
trelied by the defendant capitalists. The
$1.<*X),O00 was raised on coal mines scat
tered through 2.500.000 acres of rich min
eral land in the Stats of Sonor.i, Mexico.
Hayward Â«ind hfs associates have already
lost the property by decision of the Mexi
can courts and tho litigant aim*; to secure
t..o 8,400,000 in Che courts of this country.
Thus far it look? like a bad investment,
on the pjrt <-f iho capitalist*.'
Twenty-Ore years ago the Compania
Kxploradnra Of Torrenos CarbonifVros ?>!!
Foriora obtained the coal m'nes from tTie
Mexican Government for $105,nno by con
â¢â¢opsioii. Machinery was installed, the

mrmym necessary to seorire Ju^t a little
more capital before the mines would per

was appropriated by Clark or Sweeney.
Individually, the personal judgment asked
for against them cannot be given.

decree, taking further proof if necessary,

so moditled it will stand affirmed; Hanley
to recover costs.
The appeal of the Emptre State-Idaho
Company from the final decree Is next
considered. It is stated that defendants
claimed Hanley*s interest to the mine toy
virtue of the deed -which thÂ© court ad
judged never to have been delivered, but
to have been fraudulently got posses
sion of by Sweeney and Clark, during all
of which time they unlawfully and fraud
ulently excluded Hanley from the" mine.
It is true that under the statutes of
Idaho those holding the rjajority interest
In a mining claim have a right to mine
and control the operations of the entire
mine, if done honestly and properly, but
not to the exclusion of their co-owner,
who has the right to access to any and
every part of the property and to its
proper inspection, to the end that he may
see that his rights are respected and pro
tected and that he may receive his Just
proportion of the net proceeds. "Where the
owner is excluded from the premises and
his ore extracted and disposed of the act
is an unlawful trespass.
SECURES BIO JUDGMENT.
Some time after the ?ntry of the final decree
In March. 1903.. the Empire State Company
again commenced mining undi>r the surface oC
the Skookum claim, having taken thÂ« advice of
its counsel to the effect that It had that right.
and. under like advice, set apart and deposited
in bank one-eifchth of the net proceeds thereof
for the protection of I Ian ley. as tvelj as itself.
That course has since been pursued, until now
and here this court is askÂ»Â«l. without any show,
infr of fraud in the mining operations" of me
company or of any unminerllke working of thÂ«
ground, to enjoin the company from mining
further, and thus ti<* the property up. We are
of the opinion that under the provisions of the
statute of Idaho, as construed by the Supreme
I'ourt of that Ptate, which construction Is blnil
injf upon the Federal Courts in respect to prop
erty situated In that State, as is that here ln
volvrt, the owner of toe majority interest In
such property is entitled to mine and control
its operations In the absence of any showinc
of fraud or wrongdoing-, accounting, of cours*.
to the owner for his proportion of the net pro
ceeds. The application made hero for an in
junction Is therefor* denied, with cost* to thÂ«
defendants.
