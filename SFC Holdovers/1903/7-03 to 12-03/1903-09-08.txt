SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER -8, 1903.
/T cannot be too often repeated that in this country, in the long run, we all of us tend to go up or
go down together. If the average of well-being is high, it means that the average zvage-worker,
:â¢ the average farmer and the average business]manarc all alike zvcll off. If the average shrinks,
there is not one of these classes which zvill not feel the shrinkage. Of course there arc always some
men who are not affected by good times, jusPas there arc seme men who are not affected by bad
times. ' But, speaking broadly, 'it is true that if prosperity conies all of us tend to share more or less
therein, and that if : adversity comes each of its, Jo a greater or. less extent, feels the tension. It is
all-essential to, the continuance of our healthy national life that zve should recognize this community
of interest among our people. The welfare -of each of .us is dependent fundamentally upon the zvcl
fare of all of us, and therefore in public life that man is the best representative of each of us zvho
seeks to do good. to each by doing good to all; in other zcords, zvhosc endeavor is not to represent
any special class; but to represent, all true and honest men of all classes. â Extract from the Presi
dent's~ Labor Day speech.

THERE is no zvorsc enemy of the zvagc-zvorker than the man who condones mob violence in
any shape or isho preaches class hatred, and surely the slightest acquaintance with our indus
trial history should teach eve n the most short-sighted that theJimes of most suffering for our
people as a whole, the times when business is stagnant and capital suffers from shrinkage and gets no
return from its investments, are exactly the times of hardships and want and grim .disaster amdng
the poor. If all the existing instrumentalities of wealth could be abolished, the first and severest
suffering would come among those of us who are least well off at present. The zvage-zvorker is
well off only when the rest of the country is well off, and he can best contribute to this general zuell
being by showing sanity and a firm purpose to do justice to others. In his turn the capitalist who is
really a conservative, the man who has forethought as well as patriotism, should heartily welcome
every effort, legislative and otherwise, which has for Us object to secure fair dealing by capital,
corporate or individual, toward the public and toward the employes.â Extract from the President's
Labor Day speech. . :
CLASS HATRED IMPERILS LABOR
"Exactly, the power behind the throne
âexactly. And it makes one proud to
think he is an American to 'see these
men." remarked the- President.'.;
In the parade were a few floats with
placards. One read: "The Trust Fights
Us; Let Us Fight the Trusts by Not
Using Their Goods/'
At 11:30 o'clock the line had passed and
the party was driven to the train and
departed for the State Fair. '

PUTS IN A BUSY DAY.
It was a busy day for the President, as
well as a day full of Incidents. In the
morning soon after his arrival he re
viewed from a beautifully decorated
Ftand in Hanover square a great parade
of the labor organizations of the city. He
then went to the State Fair grounds,
where he delivered before 50,000 persons
an address on good citizenship and the
relations that should exist between labor
and capital. He was the principal gnest
at a luncheon at the clubhouse on the
groundsâ a luncheon which v,as attended
by every important State official except
Governor Odell, who could not be present
or. account of a previous engagement; re
viewed a fine parade of the National Let
ter Carriers' Association and fraternal
bodies of the city, and was the guest to
night of former United States Senator
Frank Hiscock at a dinner which was
attended by about thirty persons invited
to meet the President.
EEVIEWS ARMY OF LABOBEES.
Clear Ekies, bands of music, the local
military company, an unprecedented dis
play of Hag's ar.d patriotic decorations
and the unbounded, enthusiasm of a vast
throng greeted President Roosevelt at 5:30
o'clock this morning when his special
train rolled Into the station. With him on
the train were Secretary Loeb, Jacob A.
Riis of New York, a newspaper repre-
Ecntatlve.'^ie secret service men and of
ficials of the operating department of the
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Railroad. The run from New York was
without Incident. The President was met
at the train by a reception committee.
The forty-first separate company pre
sented arms as the r President appeared
and then, headed by t^e New York Letter
Carriers' band, escorted the President
and the committee to the reviewing stand.
The President on the march received an
ovation from the densely packed throng.
Jn the square about the reviewing stand
were fully Â£5,000 persons. Upon the stand
beside- the President were Senator Depew,
Bishop P. A. Ludlen of Syracuse, and in
fluential citizens.
SHOUTS TO THE MARCHERS.
There was never before such a demon-
Ftration by organized labor in this city.
Fully MOO men and women were in line.
The Labor Day Committee as it reached
the stand sent its chairman to greet the
President and to pin a badge upon his
coat- The President expressed his pleas
ure in a few words and the line began
to move. Union after union uncovered
at it reached the stand. Now and again
the President shouted compliments to a
fine looking body of men. From start to
finish his attention was never diverted
from the workinemen.
"They are the power behind the
throne," remarked a Syracusan to the
President as the men marched by.

The probability of the aged woman's

TACOMA, Sept. 7.â A new and Import
ant complication has arisen in Chinese
politics at Peking, according to mall ad
vices received to-day from Yokohama.
It consists of a new malady of the Em
press Dowager, a symptom of which con
sists of a large swelling under one of her
eyes.
This news was announced in court cir
cles at Tokio last month by Major Watan
nabe of the Japanese legation at Peking.
He stated also that German physicians,
who examined her Majesty, pronounced
a very unfavorable opinion, expressing
the belief that she could not survive more
than a year.
Watannabe stated that the news had
caused consternation in court circles at
Peking, but was unknown to the public
generally there. The diplomatists of the
powers, however, have learned of the
serious condition of the Empress and
they have cautiously but assiduously ap
plied themselves to the difficult task of
gathering information as to the progress
of the disease.

SYRACUSE, Sept. 7.â Believing that he
intended to assassinate President Roose
velt, the police this afternoon arrested
John Miller, 35 years old. as he -was leav
ing his home, supposedly to go to Han
over Square, where the President was re
viewing the parade of the National Asso
ciation of Letter-carriers.
The evidence upon which Miller was
arrested was supplied by Mrs. Philip
Smith and her 15-year-old son, who testi
fied that they heard him declare: "I am
going- to shoot the President."
Although no weapon was found on him,
the police believe Miller intended to carry
out his alleged threat. While there is
much secrecy maintained about the case
at police headquarters, it is asserted that
the authorities have been on the watch
for Miller since yesterday morning. They
kept his house under surveillance, but it
was not until thi3 afternoon that' they
caught sight of him. Secret Service men
aided in the watch, and from the number
of men detailed on the case It was con
sidered to be of considerable importance.
Miller is married and has four children.
He is a German.

When the shooting occurred Mrs. Godat
sprang between the men and tried to stop
the. fight, but she was pushed aside' and
was' rather roughly handled, ' though she
wasnofseriously-hurt. : "
TUOLTJMNE. Sept. 7.â Walter Brown,
a" Soulsbyville miner, was shot and in
tan tly- killed here, to-night by Eugene
Godat, also a miner from the -same town,
who " received a bullet through his head
and will probably, die during the night.
The men met on the street at 7 o'clock
this evening, while Walter Brown was ac
companied by "lils .own wife, and Mrs.
Godat. As Godat had threatened to at
tack Brown at their first meeting, Brown
took the first shot with his pistol. Godat
was almost as quick and returned the
fire with ! fatal effect, two bullets going
through Brown's body.
Mrs. Ed Russell, wife of a mining man,
was passing along in the crowded street
at the time and received a stray bullet In
one of her thighs, but the wound is not
serious. Godat was carried to a hospital
and 'is being cared for by surgeons, but
they do not think he will live.
Brown and Godat had quarreled at
.Soulsbyville, five miles from here, several
months ago and their falling. out was bit
ter. Godat left the place and went -to Ari
zona, leaving his family at Soulsbyville.
I It .w : as not believed he would return, but
he. came back to the county to-daV and

ABOR DAY has come and gone and
m with it3 passing one fact stands
S out l n b 01 ' 1 outline. It Is evident
that the unions of San Francisco
- Â¦ comprising more than one-third,
of the male adult population of the city,
have enjoyed a season of unexampled in
crease and prosperity.
There were between 20,000 and 23,000 men
in line by actual count. This number
does not by any means represent the total
strength of the local unions, nor win the
estimate be satisfying to the labor leaders,
who claimed nearly twice as many ln line.
But the actual figures as gathered by
men experienced ln such matters and who
devoted all their, time to tallylne the
marchers give slightly under 23,000 men la
line in both oararlea.
The wild estimates made of previous xx>
rades, when shorn of their exaggerations,
will show a very much smaller number
than this and the Increase In the repre
sentation, appearance and interest that
marks this year's turnout cannot fail to
give encouragement to the friends of or
ganized labor.
Oakland unionists made a noble show*
ing, placing that city among those which
own the sway of organized labor In every
department of manual work.
NOTABLE ADDHESSES.
The literary exercises at the Chutes In
this city and at Shell Mound were remark
able for the loftiness of thought and the
conservatism, of utterance by the various
speakers. Apparently the day of the blatant
agitator in laboring circles has passed.
Among all the addresses there was not an
utterance that savored of radicalism. The
speeches were dispassionate statements of
the high fundamental purposes of trades
organizations of such erudite character
as to do credit to college presidents or
educated students of deep sociological
questions. That they were the product
of men who have made their living by the
work of their hands speaks volumes for
the educational influences of trades union-
Ism.
Of the men composing the unions who
took part in the various exercises of the
day no praise can be too high. They
showed ln every action the influence that
fair wages and liberal hours have had on
them. They evidenced the dignity which
a clear appreciation of their own impor
tance ln the industrial field has disclosed
to them. They indicated a realization
that, having assumed a position of im
portance. It was their duty to â¢Â«Mntnin
it properly and that any Â¦ lapse was not
an individual matter, bat a collective In-
Jury to their wllow tollers.
IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY.
No finer body of men of equal numbers
was ever seen anywhere. They were the
toilers of the people, but nothing of de
pression or oppression was visible any
where. Permeating every division, every
line, every Individual among the great
mass was that Indefinable air of supe
riority that accompanies Industry and
prosperity. They were typical of the best
ln manhood that the earth has to offerâ
the Western American worklngman.
As far as the present Industrial pros
perity overshadows the conditions of past
years so far did the parade of yesterday
surpass that of previous Labor days. Be
tween the present and past performances
on the part of organized ! labor there was
no comparison. In numbers the turnout
exceeded that of last year; In appearance
it was in every way superior. Distinctive
uniforms of attractive design and appro
priate to the various crafts were worn
by the different bodies for the most part.
There was no motley assemblage of un
labeled toilers. Each division, each trade
was readily recognizable.
Impressive beyond the power of expres
sion was this display of craftsmen who
constitute the productive power of the
city. It was a revelation not only to
those who give scant thought to indus
trial conditions, but even to the men tak
ing part in the display. Such sterling
manhood and strength, physical and men
tal, as was shown bespeaks a force great
er than that which ln past uays has made
and unmade empires and totally changed
political and social conditions.

able, but even in that there are posslbllltie
that are glorious. But to carry no load at aJ
â there is nothing: In that. No one seems ti
f" lve at any goal really worth reaching li
tnis wond who does not come to It heav;
laden. '
Surely from our own experience each one of
\xa knows that this is true. From the great
est to the smallest, happiness and usefulness
are largely found ln v the same soul, and the
joy of life la won In its deepest and truest
sense only by those who have not shirked life's
burdens. The men whom we most delight to
honor In all this land are those who. Jn the
iron years from 'Cl to 'C5, bore on their
shoulders.'. the burden of saving the Union.
They did not choose the easy task. They did
not shirk the difficult duty. Deliberately and
of their own free will they strove for an Ideal,
upward and onward across the etony slopes of
greatness. They did the hardest work that
was then to be done: they bore the heaviest
burden that any generation of Americans ever
had to bear, and because they did this they
have won such proud Joy as It has fallen to
the lot of no other men to win. and have writ
ten their names forevermore on the golden
honor roll of the nation. As it is with the soldier,
so it Is with the civilian. To win success in
the busnesB world, to become a first-class me
chanic, a successful farmer, an able lawyer or
doctor, means that the man has devoted his
best enersry and power through long years to
the achievement of his ends. So it Is in the
life of the family, upon which In the last
analysis the whole welfare of the nation rests.
The man or woman who as bread-winner and
home-maker, or as wife and mother, has done
all that he or she can do, patiently and un
complainingly, is to be honored. Â¦ and is to be
envied by all those who have never had the
good fortune to feel the need and duty of doing
such work. The woman who has borne and
who has reared aa they should be reared a
family of children has in the most emphatic
manner deserved well of the republic. Her
burden has been heavy and she has been able
to bear it ' worthily only by the possession of
resolution, of good sense, of conscience and of
unselfishness. But If she has borne It well,
then to her shall come ! the supreme | blessing,
for in the words of the oldest and greatest of
books, '"Her children shall rise up and call her
blessed," and among the benefactors of the
land her place must be with those who have
done the best and the hardest work, whether
as lawgivers or as soldiers, whether In public
or in private life.
QUALITY OF OUR GREATNESS.
This is not a soft and easy creed to preach.
It is a creed willingly learned only by men
and women who, together with the softer vir
tues, possess also the stronger; who can do
anil <lare and die at need, but who while life
lasts will never filnch from their allotted task.
You farmers and wage-workers and business
men of this great State, of this mighty and
wonderful nation, are gathered to-day, proud
of your State and still prouder of your nation,
because your forefathers and predecessors have
lived up to Just this creed. You have received
from their hands a great Inheritance, and you
will leave an even greater Inheritance to your
children and your children's children, provided
only that your practice alike in your private
and ycur public lives the strong virtues that
have given us as a people greatness in the
past. It Is not enough to be well-meaning and
kindly, but weak: neither is It enough to be
strong, - unless morality and decency go hand
in hand with strength. We must possess the
qualities which make us do our duty In our
homes and among our neighbors, and in addi
tion we must possess the qualities which are
indispensable to the makeup of every great
and masterful nation â the qualities of courage
and hardihood, of Individual initiative and >Â«.t
of power to combine for a common end, and
above - all, the resolute determination to per
mit no man and no set of men to sunder us
one from the other by lines of caste or creed
or section. We must act upon the motto of
all for each and each for all. There must be
ever present In cur minds the fundamental
truth that In a republic such as ours the only
safety 1? to stand neither for nor against any
man because he Is rich or because he is poor,
because he is engaged In one occupation or
another, because he works with hia brains or
because he works witb his hands. We mutt
treat each man on his worth and merits aa a
man. We must see that each is given a square
deal, because be Is entitled to no more and
should receive no less. Finally we must keep
ever In mind that a republic such as ours can
exist only ' la virtue of the orderly liberty
LABOB COUNCIL PABADE.
Ne'ver before in any city west of the
Uocky Mountains has a more manly ap
pearing, distinctive and attractive aggre
gation of workingraen appeared In public
than turned out yesterday in the parade
of the unions of San Francisco affiliated
with the Labor Council. More than Ju 0&0
men were in line and their prosperous ap
pearance and confident bearing spoke
louder than words of the well-dese-ved
progress that the industrial classes have
attained In this cltjr. O
The procession started at 9:30 o'clock
from the foot of Market street. It was
headed by a platoon of mounted police
and a full military band and Grand Mar
shal Emil Schaerer rode ;*t the head on a
mettlesome charger, attended by George
Hook and Carl Goertz as aids. Mayor
Kugene E. Schmitz and officers of the
Labor Council followed in carriages.
ThÂ»' first division waa composed of the
Gas. Electrical. Street Railway and Pow
er Council. They wore white caps and
carried canes and made an attractive ap
pearance. More than 1000 were In line. A
A. Knox marshaled the division with H
S. Cleveland and Joseph Lorimer as aids
The float consisted of a model of a trol-
U ;â¢ car flanked by dynamos and a furnace
was plowing in the rear. On the corners
were gas meters and lamp posts and m
the center were a telegraph polo and an
arc light structure. The unions compos-
Ing the division were Gas 'Workers JCo
PiÂ«0, Electrical Workers No. 2S3, Linemen
No. 15L Street Railway Employes No. 205
and Stationary Firemen No. 86.
Some of the street railway employes
Â¦wore uniforms, but for- the most part
they were dressed in citizens' clothes and
wore badges. The linemen bore banners
with the inscriptions. "We are still out
and determined to v/in," "Waiting for a
conference." "What will he say?" and
ether similar Inscriptions. One of the
men carried a monkey tagged with a
card saying "He won't talk." The elec
trical workers appeared in their ordinary
laboring clothes, equipped with climbers
and tools of their trade.
The Ffcond division, composed of tne
Team Drivers' Council, was the second
strongest numerically of any in the pa
rade, turning out about 2000 marchers, it
wu marshaled by George Shepston,
whose aids were Joseph F. Sullivan and
v. j. Kerr. It was headed by the Juve-
There Is no room In our healthy American
life for the mere Idler, for the man or the
woman whose object It Is throughout life to
shirk the duties which life ought to bring.
Life can mean nothing worth meaning unless
Its prime aim is the doing of duty, the
achievement of results worth achieving. A
recent writer has finely said: "After all, the
saddest thing that can happen to a man Is to
carry no burdens. To be bent under too great
a load Is bad; to be crushed by It la lament-
NO BOOM FOB THE IDLER.
There Is no worsa enemy of the wage
worker than the man who condones mob vio
lence in any shape or who preaches class
hatred, and surely the slightest acquaintance
with our Industrial history should teach even
the most shortsighted that the times of most
suffering for our people' as a whole, the times
when business is stangnant and capital suffers
from shrinkage and gets no return from Us
investments, are exactly the times of hard
ships and want and grim disaster among the
poor. If all the existing instrumentalities of
wealth could be abolished the first and sever
est suffering would come among those ot us
who are least well off at present. The wage
worker la well off only when the rest of the
country Is well off, and he can best contribute
to this general well-being by showing eanlt7
and a firm purpose to do Justice to others.
the man who seeks each day's wage by that
day's work, wronging no one and doing his
duty by his neighbor; nor yet does this line of
cleavage divide the unscrupulous wealthy man,
who exploits others In his own interest, from
the demagogue, or from the sullen and en
vious being who wishes to attack all men of
property, whether they do well or 111. On
the contrary the line of cleavage bet'veen good
citizenship and bad citizenship separates the
rich man who does well from the rich man
who does 111. the poor man of good conduct
from the poor man of bad conduct. This
line of cleavage lies at right angles to any
such arbitrary line of division as that separat
ing one class from another, one locality from
another, or men with a certain degree of prop
erty from tho*e of a less degree of property.
The good citizen is the man who. whatever
his wealth or his poverty strives manfully to
do his duty to himself, to his family, to his
neighbor, to the State; who is incapable of
the baseness which manifests Itself either in
arrogance or in envy, but who while demand
ing justice for himself is no less scrupulous
to do Justice to others. It is because the
average American citizen, rich or poor. Is of
Just thin type that we have cause for our
profound faith in the future of the republic.
Ours Is a government of liberty, by, through
and under the law. Lawlessness and conni
vance at law-breaking â whether the law
breaking take the form of a crime of greed
and cunning or. of a crime of violenceâ are de
structive not only Of order, but of the true
liberties which can only come through order.
If alive t6 their true Interests rich and poor
alike will set their faces like flint against the
spirit which seeks personal advantage by over
riding the laws, without regard to whether
this spirit shows Itself in the form of bodily
violence by one set of men or In the form of
vulpine cunning by another set of men.
Let the watchwords of all our people he the
old familiar watchwords of honesty, decency,
fair-dealing and common sense. The qualities
denoted by these words are essential to all of
us; as we deal with the complex Industrial
problems of to-day, the problems affecting not
merely the accumulation but even more the
wise distribution of wealth. We ask no man's
permission when we require him to obey the
law; neither the permission of the poor man
nor yet of the rich man. Least of all can the
man of great wealth afford to break the law,
even for his own financial advantage; for tha
law Is his prop and support, and it is both fool
ish and profoundly unpatriotic for him to fail
In giving hearty support to those who show
that there is in very fact one law. and one
law only, alike for the rich and the poor,
for the great and the small. -
Men sincerely interested In tha due protec
tion of property, and men sincerely Interested
in seeing that the Just rights of labor are
guaranteed, should alike remember not only
that in the long run neither - the capitalist
nor the ware-worker can be helped In healthy
fashion save by helping the other: but also
that to require either side to obey the law and
do Its full duty toward the community Is em
phatically to that side's real interest, i
FOE OP THE WAGEWORKER.
COMMUNITY OF INTEREST.
It is all-essential to the continuance of oar
healthy national life that we should recognize
this community of Interest among our people!
The welfare of each of us is dependent funda
mentally upon the welfare of all of us. and
therefore in public life that man is the best
representative of each. of ua who seeks to do
good to each by doing good to all; in other
words, whose endeavor It is not to represent
any special class and promote merely that
class's selfish Interests, but to represent all
true and honest men of all- sections and all
classes and to work for their Interests by
working for our common country. .. . ..
Â¦We can keep our Government on a sane 'and
healthy basis, we can make and keep our- so
cial system what it should be, only on. condi
tion of Judging each man, not as a member Of
a class, but on his worth as a man. . It la an
infamous thing in our American life, and fund
amentally treacherous to our ; institutions, to
apply to any man any test save that of his
personal ' worth, or to draw, between 'two sets
of men any distinction save the distinction of
conduct,' the distinction that marks off those
who dfcwell and wisely from those who do ill
and f jlllshly. There are good citizens and bad
citizens In every class as In every locality,
and the attitude of decent people toward great
public and social questions should be deter
mined, not by the accidental questions of em
ployment or locality, but by those deep set
principles which represent the innermost souls
Â° The failure In public and in private life thus
to treat each man on his own merits, the recog.
nltlon of this Government aÂ» being either for
the poor as such or for the rich as such, would
prove fatal to our republic, as such failure
and such recognition have always proved fatal
in the past to other republics. A healthy re
publican government must rest upon Indi
vidual*, not upon classes or sections. As soon
as it becomes government by a class or by a
cection it departs from the old American Ideal.
It Is. of course, the merest truism to say that
grounds a crowd estimated at 00,000 had
arrived and crowds were pouring, through
all the gates. A citizens' committee of
100 occupied the speakers' stand. The
President was introduced by Lieutenant
Governor Higgins, president of the State
Fair commission. After the cheering had
subsided the President spoke as follows:
In speaJung en Labor Day at the annual fair
of the New York State Agricultural Associa
tion, It Is natural to keep especially in mind
the two bodits who compose the majority of
our people and upun whose welfare depends the
welfare of the entire State. If circumstances
are such that thrift, energy, industry and fore
thought enable the farmer, the tiller of the
soil, on th% one hand, and the wage worker, on
the other, to keep themselves, their wives and
their children in reasonable comfort, then the
State is well off, and we can be assured that
the other classes in the community will like
wise prosper. On the other hand, if there is in
the long run a lat:k"<.f prosperity among the two
claetes named, then all other prosperity is sure
to be more seeming than real. It has been our
profound good fortune as a nation that hlther
to, disregarding exceptional periods of depres
sion and the normal und inevitable fluctuations,
there has been on the whole from the begin
ning of our Government to the present day a
progressive betterment alike in the condition
of the tiller of the soil and in the condition of
the man who. by his manual skill and labor,
supports hlmuelf and his family, and endeavors
to bring up his children so that they may be at
least as well off ens, and if possible better oft
than, he himself has been. There are, of
course, exceptions, but as a whole the standard
of living among the farmers of our country
has risen from generation to generation, and
the wealth represented on the farms has steaJ
ily Increased, while the wages of labor have
likewise rieen, bQth as regards the actual
money paid and as regards the purchasing
power which Jhat money represents.
Side by side with this increase in the pros
perity of the wage worker and the tiller of
the soil has gone on a great increase in the
protperity amor* the business men and among
certain classes of professional men; and the
prosperity of these men has been partly the
cause and partly the consequence of the pros
perity of the fanner and wage worker. It can
not be too often repeated that In this country,
In tho long run, we all of us tend to go up or
go down together. If the average of well-being
Is high, it means that the average wage
worker, the average farmer and the average
business man are all alike well off. If tne
average shrinks, there is not one of these
classes which will not feel the shrinkage. Of
course, there are always some men who are
not affected by good times. Just as there are
some men who are not affected by bad times.
Iiut, epeaking broadly. It Is true that if pros
perity comes all of us tend to share more or
less therein, and that if adversity comes each
of us. to a greater or less extent, feels the
tension. Unfortunately, in this world the in
nocent frequently find themselves obliged to
pny some of the penalty for the misdeeds of
the guilty; and so If hard times come, whether
they be due to our own fault or to our mis
fortune, whether they be due to some burst of
speculative frenzy that has caused a portion of
the business world to lose Its head â a loss
which no legislation can possibly supply â or
whether they be due to any lack of wiBdom In
a portion of the world of laborâ in each case
the trouble once started Is felt more or less In
every walk of life,
Again and again in the republics of ancient
Greece, In those of mediaeval Italy and me
diaeval Flanders, this tendency waa shown,
and wherever tho tendency' became a habit it
invariably and inevitably proved fatal to the
utate. In the final result it mattered not one
â¢whit whether the movement was in favor ..of
one class or of another The outcome was
equally fatal, whether the country fell Into the
hands of a wealthy oligarchy which exploited
the poor or whether it fell under the domina
tion of a turbulent mob which plundered .the
rich. " In both cases there resulted violent al
ternations between tyranny and disorder, and
a final complete loss of liberty to all citizens â
destruction In the end overtaking; the class
which had for the moment been victorious as
well as that which had momentarily been de
feated. The death knell of the republic had
rung as noon as the active power became lodged
in .the hands of those who sought, not to do
Justice to all citizens rich and poor alike, but
to stand for one special class and for its In
terests as opposed to the Interests of others.
The reason why our future is assured lies
in the fact that our people are genuinely
skilled in and fitted for self-government and
therefore will spurn the leadership of those
who seek to excite this ferocious and foolish
class antagonism.
The average American knows not only that
he himself Intends to do about what is right,
but that his average fellow-countryman has
the' same Intention and the same power to
make his Intention â¢ â¢ effective. He knows,
whether, he be business man, professional
man, farmer, mechanic, employer, or wage
worker that the welfare of each of these men
is bound up with the welfare of all the others:
that each is neighbor to the other. Is actuated
by the same hopes and fears,. has fundamentally
the same Ideals and that all alike have much
the same virtues and the same faults. Our
average fellow-eitlzen â¢ is a eane and healthy
man. who- believes, in decency and has a
wholesome mind. He therefore feels an equal
scorn alike for the man of wealth guilty of
the mean and base eplrit of arrogance toward
those who are' less well off.' and "for 'the man
of rmall means who in his turn either feels
or seeks -to excite . In, others . the feeling of
mean and. baee envy'fQr those who are better
off. The two feeling*, envy and arrogance,
are but opposite aides of the same shield, but
different' developments of. r the- - same' eplrlt.
Fundamentally. , the .unscrupulous rich, man
w;ho seeks to exploit and oppress those who
are. less well oft Is In Bplrlt not opposed to,
but identical with, the unscrupulous poor man
who desires to plunder and oppress those who
are better off. The courtier and the dema
gogue are but developments of the same type
under different conditions, each manifesting
the same servile npirit. the eame desire to rise
by pandering to base . passions; though one
pandera to power in the shape of a single man
and the other to power In the shape of a mul
titude. So likewise the man who wishes to
rise by wronging others must by right be con
trasted, not with the man who likewise wishes
to do wrong, though to a different set of peo
ple, but with the man who wishes to do Jus
tice to all people and to wrong none.
GOOD AND BAD CITIZENSHIP.
The line of cleavage between good and bad
citizenship lies, not between the man of
wealth who acts squarely by his fellows and
In the history of mankind many republics
have risen, have flourished for a less or 'greater
t|rae, and then have fallen because their citi
zens lost the power of governing themselves
and thereby of governing their state; and In
no way has this Iobs of power been so often
and so clearly shown as in the tendency to
turn the government" in a government primarily
for the benefit of one class instead of a gov
ernment for the benefit of the people as a
Whole.
DANGER IN CLASS BULK
free institutions^ "dre of ' avail" only to people
who poSso'sa the blgft'andipeculiar characteris
tics needtd to take advantage of such institu
tions. The century that has Just closed has
witnessed many and lamentable instances in
which people have seized a government free In
form, or havp had it bestowed upon them, and
yet have permitted it under the forms of lib
erty to become some Rpecies of despotism or
anarchy, because they did not have in them the
power to make this seeming: liberty one of deed
Instead of one merely of word. Under . such
circumstances the seeming: liberty may be sup
planted by a tyranny or despotism In the first
place, or it may reach the road of despotism
by the path of license and anarchy. It matters
but little which road Is taken. In either case
the same goal Is reached. People show them
selves Ju?t as unfit for liberty whether they
submit to anarchy or to tyranny; and class
government, whether it be the government of
a plutocracy or the government of a mob, 19
equally Incompatible with the principles es
tablished in the days of Washington and per
petuated in the days of Lincoln.
Many qualities are needed by a people which
would preserve the power of self-government In
fact as well as In name. Among: these quali
ties are forethought, shrewdness, self-restraint,
the courage which refuses to abandon one'a
own rights and the disinterested and kindly
good sense which enables one to do Justice to
the rights of ethers. Lack of strength and lack
of courage unfit men for self-government on the
one hand: and on the other, brutal arrogance,
envy, in short, any manifestation of the spirit
of selfflsh disregard, whether of one's own
duties or of the rlshts of others, are equally
fatal.
President Urges Business Man, Farmer
and Laborer to Work Together for
the Common Good of All Classes
Dy some blunder the head of the pro
cession was cut off by the Building
Trades Council procession at Van Ness
avenue, and the line was compelled to
halt for an hour and a half before It
could proceed. This was the only Inci
dent that marred the display.
The next division was headed by the
shirt waist and laundry workers, who
made a splendid appearance. Thirty
floats and vehicles carried cargoes of
pretty girl â¢ operators, who received a
warm welcome along the line. Then came
the garment workers, upholsterers, soap,
Boda and candle workers, carriage paint
ers and carriage woodworkers, shoe
workers, shoe ctitters and shoe repairers,
glove workers, leather workers on fiorse
goods and tanners.
A cavalcade of officers on white horses
headed the Stablemen's Union- They were
followed by Â¦ the shippers', packers' and
porters' unions and the canmakers, who
carried metal American flags.
The Allied Provision Trades Council
followed, with W. Kugler as marshal and
W. S. LUtle and T. 8. McLaughlin as
aids. Gigantic plea, cakes and loaves of
bread symbolized the craft. The. bakers
and confectioners were - In . the lead,
dressed in spotless white. The brewers
and maltsters, decked with sprays of
hops; the Cooks' and Walters' Union,
with a dining-rom float on which meals
were served; the soda and mineral watÂ«Â»r
bottlers and a large delegation of the
butcher workmen brought up the rear of
the procession. The lathers, a finely
equipped body of men, dropped out be
cause of being compelled to wait.
Three, unions of coopers, with S. J. Cook
as marshal, composed the following divi
sion, together with a representation of the
Fishhandlers' Union.
nile band of the Ancient Order of Forest
ers. It was composed of Ice wagon driv
ers, retail delivery drivers, butcher cart,
soda and mineral water wagon drivers,
brewery wagon drivers, expressmen,
hackmen in carriages, a strong body of
sanitary wagon drivers and drivers of
furniture, piano and milk wagons. The
League of the Cross band furnished mu
sic for the second half of. this division.
Eight hundred retail clerks and* sales
women formed the third division, with D.
B. Ferguson as marshal and E. D. Mon
trcse and Charles B. Whilden as aids.
The women In goodly number rode in
carriages between the Retail Store
Clerks' Association in white caps and
natty suits and the Retail Clerks' Inde
pendent Protective Apscciation in red
caps and sashes. This division made a
particularly line appearance.
The Iron Trades Council formed the
fourth division of the parade, the largest
and most Imposing of any. All of 4000 men
allied to the Iron trad'es marched after
George Sandeman, president of the coun
cil, as marshal and J. J. McDade and T.
A. Riordan as aids. One of the floats was
a miniature of the battleship Maine, with
smoke pouring from the funnels. The un
ions comprising this division were Black
smiths' Helpers No. 316, Casting Chlppers.
No. 10,405, Boilermakers' Helpers No. 65,
Amalgamated Engineers No. 618, Pattern
makers' League, Ship and. Machine Smiths
No. 168, Machine Hands, Brotherhood of
Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders,
Ignited Metal Workers, Boilermakers.
Ship Drillers, Iron Mo'.ders, Steam Fitters
and Machinists' Apprentices.
The fifth division was marshaled by H.
Gallagher, who had for aids F. Ducolng
and H. Clunie. It was composed of un
ions affiliated with the Labor Council
but not organized under any especial de
partment Those represented were the
rope and cordage workers, with a mag
nificent float emblematic of their employ
ment; the broommakers, who carried um
brellas made of broom straw and had a
convict and a Chinaman chained to
gether as a symbol of cheap broom manu
facturing; the glassblowers, with a fur
nace and blowers on a float; cigarmakers,
with a gigantic cigar box on a float;
united cloth hat and cap makers, with
women operatives In carriages; cloak

and automobile machinists on bicycles,
stove mounters and rammermen, box
makers and 6awyers, picture frame work
ers, reed and rattan workers and sugar
workers. .
The Bridge and Structural Ircn Work
ers" Union was the feature of the third
division, which was under the command
M J. E. Scully. The members wore
lilaok. the sort of clothes they wear when
working on the skyscrapers. The metal
workers were also in this division, and
they escorted a float showing in opera
tion a flying machine. The machine.
however, was stationary for the occasion!
M. Morton commanded the fourth divi-
Fion. which consisted principally of
painters, decorators and paperhangers
The glaziers and ornamental glass work
ers and carpet mechanics completed the
division, making it one of the best, In
]>oir,t of numbers, in the parade.
The fifth and sixth divisions were under
the command of w. J. Holman and Jo
seph Trumpower. In those two divisions
marchtd the engineers, riggers and steve
dores, longshore lumbermen, lumber
<!erks, building material team drivers
horseshoers and laborers. The Horse
ehoers' Union was easily the banner ag
gregation of these two divisions Its
member* wore blue shirts and black
trousers, and belt and black caps Their
shirts were decorated with a white horse
thoe. making an ensemble neat, natty and
attractive. '
The second division was under com*
mand cf Marshal T. J. Farrell. It con
sisted cf Plumbers', Gas and Steam Fit
ters'. Sheet Metal Workers' unions and
rirntlar trades. The plumbers distln
#--uifhed themselves by appearing several
hundrol strong, and the sheet metal
workers won the applause of all the
spectators. Each one of the metal
vorken carried a tin parasol wore a
natty blue and white uniform, producing
an effect that won for them cheer after
< h-er and hand-clapping galore.
Th<? parade cf the unions affiliated with
the Buiiding Trades Council was a feature
of the celebration of yesterday. Fully
12.000 men who have to do with the erec
tion of skyscrapers, Hats and buildings of
< very description started iroai the corner
of Union street and Van Ness avenue
yesterday meming at 10 o'clock. The
men who hollowed out for the foundation
were Sn 1'ne and so were also the men who
laid It. Every trade connected with the
erection of a building from the ground
to the roof was represented and the spec
tacle presented was a grand one. They
are not military rrsen. these bui!der3, and
their start was a siow cne, but what
they larked in celerity was more than
made up by the earnestness displayed
once they got started.
The parade redounds greatly to the

II. McCarthy, president of the Building
Trades Council, <5cwn to the g"Uide in the
ranlis cf the unions that followed the red,
white and blue sash of McCarthy as
grand marshal.
E. L. Nol:Â»n, president of the Brick
layers' t'nlon. was marshal of the first
division. He practically led the parade,
betes followed by h!s union, 3'X> strong
12nd a float containing a mammoth repre
sentation of a "union card." The plas
terers followed the float and they in turn
RN followed by the stonecutters and

were on the platform.
BENHAM SPEAKS.
G. B. Benham. president of the Labor
Council, made a brilliant and forcible ad
dress. He said In part:
These exercises are held under the auspices
of the San Francisco Labor Council, an organi
zation credited with belrnj second to none In
this or any other country in Its knov.todgsof
the necessities of the working people. ThÂ«
ends it seeks are those which make Tor tha
elimination of a great part of the restrictions
which surround the worker at the present time.
We stand here, pledged by our declaration of
principles "to secure the enactment of such
laws, or aid to establish such systems of gov
ernment as will secure to the producers thÂ»
full prod l'.-t rt their lnlor."
It would not be well for America nor for
the world if the fraternal bonds of the workers
were torn asunder. Picture to yourself the <le
structlon of the trades unions and t/ien ronipa.s
that catastrophe to the mere financial panics of
the past. It Is something that should Ox lt.Â»e!f
Indelibly upon the minds of the thinking peop!Â»
of this land. Prosperity rests upon the broad
back of .productive laborers, mechanics and
artisans. â¢ The ware received is the T.ean* o!

Andrew Furuseth was given a tumultu
ous welcome when he was Introduced and
several minutes elapsed before he could
quiet the applause. He reviewed tha
growth of labor development since the
days of absolutism, tracing a connection
with the dlsfranchisement of the toilers
and the spread of the doctrine of Christ.
The labor movement, he said, was a co
rollary of the doctrine enunciated by
Christ of the equality of man under tha
iathershlp of God.
Trades unionism, he said. In Its sim
plest form was an association of workers

this had grown many forms qf organiza

pressed the greatest concern as being the
rock upon which trades unionism might
be wrecked. The contract system also,
whereby organizations agreed to work
for certain parties and compelled a re
turn contract to refuse the employment
of others, he denounced as treason to
labor and of the utmost danger.

PETALUMA TAKES DAY OFF.
Enthusiasm was a-plenty. There were
cheers along the line, the bulk of the
noise, however, being caused by the re
ception given two big floats laden with
pretty laundry workers clad In summery
gowns of purest white. The only dis
cordant note of the day was the derisive
yells and howls that came from a delega
tion of striking telephone linemen whose
raucous cries of "Scab, scab," spoiled at
spots an otherwise perfect exhibition.
The men of the mechanical trades
made a particularly excellent impression
Each union man wore a distinctive uni
form that Identified him with his trade
In the building trades there was much of
featured The iron workers carried their"
hammers and the crash and din of' anvil
and the sparks from forges, with the
clang of riveters at work, lent a practical
side to the scene. The steel rolling mills
men hauled a miniature steel bridge, a
tribute to their skill and to the industries
Grand Marshal J. B. Bowen, business
agent for the Building Trades Council,
had no reason to feel anything but a
thrill of pleasurable emotion as he sat for
two hours on his steed and watched the
marching hosts pass before him in re
view. He had well organized his demon
stration and sent it through without halt
or hitch. And it was variety of color and
feature that made the display the very
best that the labor organizations of the
city have ever produced.- There were
varied touches of color, numerous floats
of interesting and- typical design, catchy
uniforms and stirring music.

EXEHCISE VIGELANCE.
Trades unions are the result and register
the rise and progress of the advanced thinkers
among the ware-workers of the past and the
present. The whole current of the world's
affairs â of human activity and achievements â
has been influenced by Its power and teach
ings. No other organized society has ever
<ione as much either morally, financially or
f ducationally as the trades unions. This may
appear as a bold statement, but when we re
member that trades unions have had to deal
with the poorest of mankind â with a class who
were for centuries the offspring of serfs and
servant** â the assertion will appear wholly
within proper bounds. Karly history, while
giving a fair idea of the rise and fall of na
tions, of the advancement In the arts and
sciences, of the fierce struggles to establish
new creeds in religion or liberal forms of gov
ernments, is stransely silent on questions re
lating to the. condition of labor. Possibly the
great cost of keeping records may account for
this, but certain it is that the laborers in ye
Good old times had no rights of any kind
eacept to die. The common people were re
garded as natural slaves and treated as such.
UNIONS REGISTER PROGRESS.

nowadays in our country, it is of the utmost

they stand for their fellow workingmen and for

be level-headed, for their obligations are fully
as serious as those of Congressmen or of cor

know that at the opening of the twentieth cen

That labor is entitled to a fair share of the
wealth It produces no fair minded person will

a government that will give labor equal pro

for force demonstrations on the shoulders of
labor until the laws grant to labor equal pro

There are hundreds of acts of violence on the
part of organized employers that are. fresh in

there has been a notable absence of protection
to labor.

The Ancient Scalp-Fever Theory Ex-
ploded. x ,
At one time dandruff was attributed to
the result of a feverish condition of the
KcaJp. which threw fcff the dried cuticle
.in scales.
â¢ Professor Unna. Hamburg. Germany,
noted authority on skin diseases, ex-
plodes this theory and says that dan-
druff is a germ disease.
This germ is really responsible for the
dandruff, and xor so many bald heads. It
ran be cured If it is gone about in the
right way. The right way. of course, and
the only way. is to kill the perm.
Newbro's Herpicide aoes this and per-
mits the hair to grow luxuriantly, Just
as nature intended it should.

WHO CANNOT BE CURED.
Backed up by over a third of a century
of remarkable and uniform cures, a record
such as no other remedy for the diseases
and^ weaknesses peculiar to women ever
attained, the proprietors and makers of Dr.
Pierce 's Favorite Prescription now feel
fully warranted in offerinz to pay $500 in
legal money of the United States, for any
case of Leucorrhea, Female Weakness, Pro-
lapsus, or Falling" of Womb which they
cannot cure. All they ask is a fair and
reasonable trial of their means of cure.

Billy Magrane's Tamm, played from
threes down to 8 to 5, took the seven-fur
long run. Frawley, who had the mount,
trailed Rubino and Wandering Boy, the
favorite, to the stretch. Then assuming
the front position with his mount he won
from Dark Secret by less than a length
in a mild drive. "Wandering Boy found
the route too far, finishing a moderate
third.
Powell on Samar, the favorite for the
two-year-old scramble, did ' not get his
mount away to any advantage and cut
no figure in the running. Bozeman astride
the 4 to 1 chance Dusty Rhodes was first
to show, and holding Pat Bulger safe in
the stretch won cleverly by a length. Be
hind Pat Bulger the second choice
Doris finished a poor third.
â¢ To Hildebrand's wretched ride could be
attributed the defeat of Iras, the even
money choice for the six-furlong selling
affair. Vic Gilbert's lightweight got his
mount pocketed on the rail early in the
race, being unable to pet clear sailing un
til well into the stretch. Then he got
down and rode hard, but could not quite
catch Jack Richelieu Jr., the gray gold
ing earning a nose decision. Madame
Bishop, the early pacemaker, ran third.
DUSTY BHODES WINS.
The third and last heat also saw the
favorite extended from the word. Swift
R being at her wheel all the way and
only losing by a neck. Tuna leaving her
feet just after crossing the line. The
Jester was distanced in this heat.
The bookmakers were kept busy and as
there were several good breaks could
likely be credited with having a good
day. Tamm and Maresa were the only
choices in the running events to land.
Tuna, the game daughter of James
Madison, captured the Stanford stake,
thereby repeating her victory in the Oc
cident stake and duplicating the feat of
the crack colt Aristo last year. The
night before Henry Sanders disposed of
the filly to J. de la Montanya at the re
ported price of 5.W0, but drove her In to
day's race as in the Occident stake. She
sold an overwhelming favorite and again
Swift B was the only other starter capa
ble of making her race.
In the first heat she stepped to town In
2:16%, which time has been beaten but
once before in the stake, then by Rio
Alto, whose mark is a quarter of a sec
ond lower. In the second heat Tuna left
her feet about a furlong from the wire
and it looked as if Swift 15 would surely
take the heat, but Sanders picked her up
and, making a drive for it, caught and
passed the colt seventy yards from home,
where he made a Jimmy under the forced
pressure.
LUCK FOB BOOKMAKERS.
Dlvina started in the Grove L. Johnson
stake, at the track last weÂ£k and his own
er bet $700 on her, but Jackson failed to
get the mare away with her field. To
day the ptable let the mare run unbacked.
In fact, h?r owner was not present. Other
duties also prevented Governor Pardee
from visiting the park. Dlvina is a live
year-old bay mare by Bassetlaw-An
gelique and is a product of Rancho del
Paso.
The favorite, > trailed by : . the light
weighted CHileno, cut out the running for
three-fourths of a mile, which was
stepped in 1:13%,' with Dlvina In third'po

Dlvina lrt the mare down and she quick

.second and the three-year-old Horatius,
shouldering 110 pounds, third.

ACTION AT THE START.
The Cripples opened the battle amid a
storm. O'Hara was passed to first, but
Frar.cks forced him on a bunt to the
Indian. Then Dr. Mosklman and Schwartz
tapped the ball out for lusty singles and
Francks ran in. The Brownies tied It up
in the. fourth, when Nadeau was on third
and two out. Elsey hit a high fly to
O"Hara, and the latter let it pass, giv
ing the Brownies their lone tally.
Then the Cripples began a systematic

eye on the leather, and the Indian kept
throrrtng 'em right over. Every once and
a while the Cripples would open up and

drive, the only home run on the grounds
for many days. The score:
But the Indian is not entitled to all the
praise. Some is due old Bill Devereaux
for the way he handed it out to the
Brownies. The veteran wound them
around the nicks of the batsmen and
twined 'em down lew, but still they never
could pet Jerry to his kind. Once Willie
O'Hara was thougrhUefs enough to let a
fly ball drop through his mitts. Then the
Brownies got a run, but none before or
cftcr.
Morris showed that he is a natural ball
player by the way he fielded his position.
Eight chances came his way and he ate
up every one. He Is cool, calm and col
lected and never gets rattled. He will
let the crowd kid him till it gets tired,
ar.d then he will glance up and give It
the merry warwhoop.
And though the native American slab
st/>r was ph-en the wallop time and time

poods, and when he learns a little more
about fooling the opposing battmen he
will land oftcner. He used a swift ball
yesterday, with Just a trifle of an out
curve attached to It. and sent It sailing
over the plate so seductK'ely that the
OripplQs could net pass up the temptav-
Tion of hitting It out ever} 1 now and then.

Imperial Troops in Numerous Clashes
With Revolutionaries.
.CONSTANTINOPLE. Sept. 7.â Official
dispatches from Monastir, dated August
31, and September 1. 2 and 3, give details
of numerous skirmishes of the imperial
troops in. that district. A body of Bul
garians I intrenched In the hills between
Lake Rodenik and the village of Yelendle
was attacked by the troops and lost thir
ty-flve men killed. The remainder of tlie
band, seeking to escape pursuit, threw
themselves, into the lake and were
drowned.
At the village of Resna twenty-two in
surgents were killed and around Fiorina
forty others perished.
A band of 200 revolutionaries was dis
persed at Boussovo, five being killed. In
the district, of Vlshanl two strong bands
were annihilated. The women and chil
dren who were found in the forest were
fed and sent back to their villages.
At Smlluo a number of fleeing insur
gents set fire to eleven houses. A strong
wind and the explosion of hidden bombs
The banana and potato are almost Iden
tical in chemical composition.
Hilo Ships Frogs to San Francisco.
HONOLULU, Sept. 7.â The frog in
dustry In Hilo has risen to the dignity
of an export trade, 500 frogs beinjr shipped
by a recent steamer to the coast. The
batrachlans are destined for thÂ« San
Francisco market, where It is hoped they
will be appreciated by Callfornian epi
cures, with the result that Hawaiian
frog legs will soon be an Important item
on all coast menus that aspire to be up
to-date.
The. revolutionaries destroyed the light
house near Limanpulevo. The Sofia Vedo
most! states that Roumania is strength
ening her military position on the Bul
garian frontier.
The newspaper Poshta asserts that all
the villages in the district of Leren are
burning. According to revolutionary es
timates Turkey has now in Macedonia an
army of 175,000 men, with 3700 horses and
440 guns.
In an engagement at Simen, Losengrad,
the villagers joined the Turks, who were
defeated. The Insurgents * afterward
burned the village as a punishment to the
inhabitants for aiding the, Turks.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Sept. 7.â In official
quarters there is a suspicious absence of
news from the Interior of Macedonia and
also from Adrianople, and it is feared
that the conditions there are. steadily be
coming worse. The Macedonian organi
zations are straining every nerve to force
Bulgaria into a war. The large and small
bands are crossing the frontier of North
ern Macedonia, where General Zontcheff
and Colonel Yankoff are organizing the
insurrectionary movement, which ls ex
pected to break out in the valley of the
Struma before the end of the week. The
Macedonian committees are prosecuting
ah active campaign to raise funds in Bul
garia. They are addressing letters to
everybody in a position to contribute to
the cause. The applications usually do
not refer to the revolutionary movement,
but ask aid for the starving and home
less fugitives from Macedonia.
Where wealthy citizens decline to sub
scribe the organizations do not hesitate
to make strong representations. A rich
merchant of Phlllppopolis was recently
told that unless he contributed $5000 his
house would be blown up.
Several fights are reported from the dis
trict of Losehgrad. At the Bashi Bazouk
village of Sashira the Turks lost twenty
men. At Tersidere a band fought 300 sol
diers all day. with the result that the
Turks lost thirty-seven men and the In
surgents lost five. At Prespan, in the
Okerda district, fighting has long been
proceeding between insurgent bands and
an army of 20,000 Turks. The latter are
reported to have lost more than 200 killed
or wounded. An engagement lasting all
day has been fought at Pritylisti, Mon
astir vilayet, in which the Turkish loss
was given as forty and the Insurgent loss
as five. A band led by Yanko Stoyanoff
has destroyed the village of Gorinoka
' vieve, Â¦ Carlpengrad, a notorious haunt of
Turkish brigands.

RUSSIA WILL EVACUATE
NEWCHWANO AND MUKDEN
CONSTANTINOPLE. Sept. 7.â War be
tween Turkey and Bulgaria ls now re
garded here as Inevitable. It is even be
lieved that the outbreak of hostilities will
occur before the end of September, when
the reinforcements from Asia will have
been concentrated in Macedonia and in
the vilayet of Adrianople. It Is not
thought that there will be any formal
declaration of war. In view of Bulgaria's
vassal status, but that some frontier in
cident will precipitate hostilities.
The Bulgarians and Macedonians resid
ing in Constantinople are In terre-r of
massacre. A large number of them were
arrested a few days ago as a "preven
tive measure." and they have not yet
been released. The fear of a massacre
is probably exaggerated, although, in
view of the present excited state of Mus
sulman feeling, an Insignificant incident
might lead to Â» massacre.
The terrible accounts received regard
ing the conduct of the Turkish troops
have not surprised European circles here,
but many who have hitherto been opti
mistic in their views now accept the pre
vailing belief that Turkey is on the verge
of a catastrophe.
A consular dispatch from Salonica says

The Russian and Austrian representa
tions regarding the necessary action
against Bulgaria reveal the attitude of
these powers toward Turkey and the

Bulgaria has been acting in bad faith in
giving secret countenance to the insur

success, thus rendering Turkey's task of
pacification more difficult and delaying yet
longer the execution of the programme of
reform accepted by Turkey. The language
of the joint, proposal assumes that a set
tlement of the Balkan trouble is attain
able If Bulgaria is forced to cut off all
connection between the two sides of the
frontier.
BERLIN, Sept. 7.â Russia and Austria
have proposed that the powers take coer
cive dipomatic action at Sofia, with the
aim of severing the relations now existing
between Bulgaria and the Macedonian in
surgents. Germany has assented, but sov
eral of the powers have objected and the
Russian and Austrian proposal probably
has fallen through.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 7.â Unless Colonel
Griffith J. Griffith tenders his resignation
as a member of the Board of Park Com
missioners by to-morrow. Mayor Snyder
will officially notify the City Council that
"he has removed him from office.
This announcement was made this even
ing by the Mayor and serves In a meas
ure to show the depth of feeling which
pervades the community as a result of
the shooting of Mrs. Griffith in Hote*
Arcadia at Santa Monica Thursday night.
As yet the resignation has not been forth
coming, but It may be in the mails, Col.
Griffith having refused to discuss the
matter although his manner showed that
he keenly feels the implication which this
action carries with it.
The Griffith case will be called in the
police court to-morrow for the purpose
of arraignment and the date of the pre
liminary trial will be set at such a* time
as Mrs. Griffith will be able to appear if
she recovers, which, despite the fact tha^t
she has shown a decided improvement to'
day, is by no means certain.
Colonel Griffiths ball will remain as It
is unless his wife dies In which event he
would of course be rearrested and held
without bail on a charge of murder. He
is being closely watched by those who
have interested themselves in his behalf.
The tremendous strain to which he has
been subjected ls telling on him, and to
guard against possible rashness his
friends do not leave him alone at any
time during the day. His extreme ner
vousness is increased by the fact that
for days prior to the shooting he had
been drinking heavily and it would not
be surprising to his friends if he were
compelled to take to his bed. He is be
ing kept off the streets as much as pos
sible and denies himself to all except
intimate personal friends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The insurgents are now said to number
25,000 well-armed and efficiently com
manded men. Their leaders will stop at
nothing to secure resources for their
.equipment. The Sofia correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph says:
I am in close touch with the insurgents and
am enabled to affirm emphatically that unless
acceptable proposals shall Ik? maoe witnln iv^x
or three weeks. Europe will be startled by a
record of deeds unequaled in the blood-stained
history of the East.
The Morning Leader's correspondent in
Sofia says the Turkish policy is to draw
the insurgents into action at all points.
The bands, however, are avoiding con
flicts until their preparations shall be
completed." They are gathering in masses
at various strategic points with a view to
a comprehensive movement within ten
days.
An unconfirmed report from Vienna
states that the Bulgarian exarch has
been shut up in his palace because of his
refusal to issue a further pastoral letter
asking the Bulgarians to lay down their
arms.
A dispatch to the Times from Monastlr,
dated September 5, says:
In Turkish circles war with Bulgaria ls con
sidered to be imminent. Hlltnl Pasha, In
spector general of Macedonia, says !)â¢ sees
no other solution. The final reserve* are be
ing- warned to hold themselves In readiness,
and orders have been issued to the principal
towns to supply horses and money and other
wise to aid the military preparations.
In the feverish attempt to stamp out the
insurrection in this quarter so as to release
the troops for operations elsewhere, there ls,
unfortunately every reason to suspect that an
attempt ls being mado to produce the Indis
criminate slaughter of the Bulgarian element,
in which Christians of all denominations are
in danger of being treated alike. Should this
prove true there can be no hope of saving the
greater part of the Christian population in the
remote districts of Western Macedonia.
Accounts from both Turkish and Insur
gent sources of the operations in Macedo
nia show that the work of extermination
is proceeding ; unchecked, and. although
the powers are making, some' effort to in
terfere, it is believed that nothing of a
serious nature will . be done until after
the meeting of the Czar and Emperor
Francis Joseph in Vienna, when It may
be too late.
LONDON, Sept. 8.â Special dispatches
from the Near East published this morn-
Ing add little fresh news regarding the

957 to 977 Market Street, San FranciscoThe Washington correspondent of the Baltimore
Herald in reviewing the situation as it appears to
politicians in the capital says that while the conser
vatives have been going about with a dark lantern
looking for a Presidential candidate the Bryanites
have been working for control of State conventions
and the party machine. He adds: "As it stands the
Bryan wing will be strongly represented from a
number of States sending large delegations to the
National convention. Ohio has been committed, for
rot only was the Kansas City platform reaffirmed
with practical unanimity, but William J. Bryan him
self is to be formally invited to stump the State this
fall. Missouri will in all probability be for the Bryan
ideas; Nebraska is committed; Illinois, if Carter
Harrison has his way, will (all into line; Texas will
be for Brj'an, and the entire South, with the possible
exception of Georgia and Alabama, is regarded as
being for the Nebraskan's principles."
It is not expected that Bryan will be again the
nominee of the party or even a candidate for the
nomination, but a fear is felt among the reorgan
izes that he will be able to frame the platform and
dictate the head of the ticket That would of course
be as bad as the renomination of Bryan himself, and
as a consequence the Johnson victory in Ohio is fill
ing the conservatives with alarm. Some of them
appear to be already making preparations to bolt.
For the moment, at any rate, the Bryanites have
the laugh on their side. It is now time for Bryan
to meet Watterson's taunt by saying that the gold
faction leaders will go to the convention with a "cor
poral's guard" behind them and then bolt
WHEN the Democrats of Iowa threw the
Kansas City platform aside and turned
Bryan's picture to the wall the reorganizes
wcrv riiied with joy. They believed the West* had
come to join hands with the East and that the
Nebraska man- would no longer be able to disturb
the growing harmony of the camp.
There were good reasons for thr joy of the con
servatives. For a long time the wcrk of reorganiza
tion had been going on, and report after report gave
encouragement to those who expected big results.
The South ceased to talk of Bryan, while the names
of Parker and Gorman grew as familiar in the
mouth as household words. The action of the Iowa
convention appeared to be the natural climax of a
movement which had been steadily increasing in
strength and spreading over the country. Under
such circumstances it was not strange that Henry
Watterson declared Bryan would not have a cor
poral's guard at his back in the next national con
vention of the party and that he would bolt. So, too,
it was natural the Populists ot Nebraska should have
similar views of the prospects ahead and speak with
assurance of the coming bolt of the Bryanite clans.
The whole situation has been changed by the Dem
ocratic convention in Ohio. In that strong and
important State the Bryanites under the lead of Tom
Johnson have captured the party machine and made
it all their own. They drew up the platform and
nominated the ticket. They will name the delegates
from the State to the Presidential convention, and
vhen the struggle between the rival factions comes
Ohio will be on the Bryan side.
The large population of the State and its com
manding position between the Atlantic States and
those of the Mississippi Valley, as well as the possi
bility that it may be z doubtful State in the Presi
dential contest, give a high degree of importance to
the position it takes in the Bryan column. It as
sures that the Nebraska leader will not go to the
convention with only the "corporal's guard" of which
[Watterson spoke so mockingly, but will have strong
delegations from strong States.

The Examiner says the present Geary-street road,
owned and run by a corporation, is a paying busi
ness, and the city's road will pay better. It de
clares that the present road pays 5 per cent interest
on $671,000 in bonds, and dividends of 2j^ per cent
on $1,000,000 in stock. This amounts to $58,500 per
year, a sum greater than the interest and sinking
fund of the bonds that are to be made a lien on the
city instead of on the road. If the Examiner is so
certain that the city will be a great success in the
railroad business, why not show that confidence by
taking these bonds off the backs of the taxpayers and
putting them on the road? To refuse this is to doubt
that the city can run a road as successfully as the
present corporation.
The Examiner's ignorance of the subject is
shown in this further statement: "In the case of the
Geary-street Railroad, however, the people of the
Mission, Potrero, North Beach and the other dis
tricts are not asked to pay anything in taxes. They
are asked to acquire a valuable piece of property
without the expenditure of any of their own money.
The money would be furnished by the bond buyers
and the interest and principal would be paid out of
the earnings of the road." Now if that were true,
which it is not. the thing we are contending for
would be already present, and the bonds would be a
lien on the plant alone and not on the city.
The people will read on the ballots for those
bonds that they are voting on "a proposition to
acquire by original construction and completion
by the city and county of San Francisco a public
utility, to wit: a otreet railroad, and TO INCUR
A BONDED DEBT OF THE CITY AND COUNTY
TO THE AMOUNT OF $710,000."
That language is plain. It is a debt of the
city and county, and not of the Geary-street Rail
road, and has to be paid by all the taxpayers,
whether they are served by the road or not.
WE have pointed out the necessity of putting
municipal socialism on its merits by making
all bonds issued for public utilities a lien
only upon the plant itself and not upon the taxpay
ers. The principle which requires this is so plain and
proper that it cannot be successfully antagonized.
American cities are being urged into municipal
ownership because cities in the British Isles have
very generally embarked in it, calling it there "mu
nicipal trading." The cities in England, Ireland and
Scotland which have gone into business have raised
the capital for commercial investment by general tax
ation, the bonds and stocks issued being a lien upon
the city and not upon the plants. The effect has been
an enormous increase in municipal debts. tThe an
nual reports of the local government board snow that
the debts of the cities have increased between 1,-891
and 1902 by 291 per cent. The annual average of in
crease has been $125,000,000, and in 1002 it jumped to
$144,677,465.
In the period of 1874-1899 the debts of Eng
lish cities increased from $465,000,000 to
$1,470,000,000, the increase of more than one
billion dollars being due to borrowing money for
investment in public utilities, to be paid by the
taxpayers. The debts of such cities incurred for
public utilities amount now to Â§50 per capita
of their inhabitants. The Chamber of -Commerce
of London, investigating the stagnating effects
of this vast debt incuired for business invest
ments, found that sixty-one municipalities, in
cluding Glasgow, . -were conducting either all or
most of the public plants at a loss, the deficit be
ing made up by extorting from the taxpayer:
These facts should warn all municipal taxpayers
against permitting the bonds for any kind of business
investment to be a lien on the municipality. If the
business can be run at a profit, or if it can pay the
cost of starting it, and of its operation," let it do so
and bear the burden of its own securities.
The Examiner favors municipal ownership of the
Geary-street Railroad. In attempting to discuss the
question it says, in answer to The Call's demand
that the bonds shall be paid by the plant and not by
the people: "If that argument were to have weight
the city government would have to go out of busi
ness. Push the question "a little further and we
should be asked, 'Why should the people of the
Western Addition be taxed to pay for the paving of
Kearny street? Why should the people of North
Beach be taxed for building the Mission High School?
Why should the Richmond District be taxed to pay
the repairs on the City Hall?' " Now all of that looks
very smart, but it isn't. Streets are paved by a tax
on the abutting property. The building of school
houses is reciprocal. When one part of the' city is
taxed with the whole city to build a new school
house in a certain district that district is in turn
taxed to build schools for the other districts which
have contributed to it. But unless the Geary-street
Railroad can be made a movable feast, and carried
around the city for the convenience of all the tax
payers, the statement remains true that all the rest
of the taxpayers are to be burdened to create a
utility which they cannot use.

HONOLULU, Sept. 7. â Attorney General
Andrews has decided not to pay to John
Jones the reward of $500 offered for In
formation leading, to the arrest of his
father, E. M. Jones, for double murder.
The decision is based on the fact that
the murderer gave himself up to his son,
and also on the general ground that it is
against public policy and is a scandal to
allow a son to collect blood money for ar
resting his father. The son intended to
use the money to pay xiounsel for Jones.

The United States authorities have determined that
criminal immigrants, who commit an offense within
three years after their admission into this country,
must be deported to the land whence they came. The
only possible objection which Americans can have
to this very excellent law is the shortness of the time
allowance. If there be any danger on earth to a
criminal foreigner it is to be thrown from a new
field of operations back to one that has been worked
out.

PERSONAL MEiNTlON.
It is not stated in the reports that any of the dele
gates to the convention went so far as that, for they
are not doctors having theories of disease, but life
insurance men dealing with statistics. They find that
on the whole the average risk is safer now than it was
in former times, but they are not agreed that a really
strong man is any safer risk now than of old. One
of the speakers put the case of longevity in this way:
"The first reason is the better care children receive
in the present day. The dealing of the human race
with the epidemics is vastly better than before and
has improved in the last few years. The third cause
is the progress in medical and surgical science. We
find that the mortality in particular diseases has de
creased very greatly in the last forty years. These in
fluences are all alike in this respect, that all repre
sent not an increase in the vitality of the strong, but
a diminution of mortality among the weak."
The issue is one upon which it seems no class of
experts is at this time capable of pronouncing defini
tive judgment. All valid conclusions upon it must
be to a large extent based upon statistics, and it ap
pears that as yet we have no statistics that can be
safely relied upon. That much was brought out dur
ing the congress by the caustic criticism pronounced
upon some governmental statistics. Thus a report
of one of the discussions says: "F. L.. Hoffman in
nis address said: 'When we are told by a Secretary
of War that the mortality in Cuba is not more than
that in the city of New York, it does not require
much actuarial knowledge to cause one to smile and
to know that it is nonsense.' He also declared the
statement that the death rate of the city of Havana
is no greater than that of Washington to be untrue.
For some time to come the death rate of Havana
will be from 50 to 100 per cent greater than any
Northern city."
Where doctors differ laymen will not undertake to
decide. It will be perceived that an interesting ques
tion has been raised and that discussion, upon it is
liable to go on indefinitely.
REPORTS from New York concerning the pro
ceedings of the International Congress of Ac
tuaries are to the effect that while all dele
gates were agreed that the average duration of hu
man life has been increased of late years, there was a
wide difference of opinion as to the manner in which
the added longevity has been obtained. It was main
tained by some that the general increase in the length
of life affected all classes of civilized men, while
others asserted it has affected none but the weak â in
other words, they maintain that sanitary science has
not increased the vitality of the strong, but has di
minished mortality among invalids.
The subject is an interesting one, and when the
proceedings of the congress' are published in full the
debates on it will doubtless prove to be instructive.
The theory that science is conserving the weak
rather than promoting the welfare of the vigorous is
not a new one. A good many physicians have argued
that the increase of insanity and of all forms of ner
vous diseases among civilized people is- due almost
wholly to the tendency of the time to maintain alive
weak children who in a less scientific age would not
have survived infancy. The preservation of the
weak, it is argued, enables them to marry and to
transmit their weakened -blood to the next genera
tion, so that the entire race of civilized man is be
coming afected with inherent tendencies to nervous
disorders.
A QUESTION OF LIFE.
The diplomatic representative of the United States
of Colombia at Washington is reported to be in
very bad favor with our Government. Under existing
circumstances, created by recent events, we are al
most tempted to suggest that the character of this
representative is such that it is enough to make us
forget the rules of common sense in discussing him.
Against 35,000 acres of 'beana last year
there are 25,000 this season. Prices are

to 52 CO. The yield is poor. Vegetables in

STOCKTON. Sept. 7.â There Is but an
acreage of 15,000 of potatoes in San Jo

but the yield per acre is from 20 to 25 per
cent less. They are now selling at from
85 to 90 cents a sack, as against 35 to 40
cents last season at the opening. As to
onions, the prices range from 60 to 70
cents a sack which is a trifle higher than
the previous season, and the prices are
better sustained. The acreage this year
is about the same as last year, or per
haps a trifle less. There 13 an unusual
condition in the fact that the onions are
rather small. From fifteen to twenty
carloads of potatoes and onions are dally
shipped from Stockton to Arizona, Texas
and New Mexico.

when he was shown the car said that he
had run it when he was working in the
old mine half a century ago. Mullen is

called to his mind many memories of the
Pennsylvania, which once was one of the
best paying mines in the district.

NEVADA CITY, Sept. 7.â An old car
and blower have been found in the work
ings of the Pennsylvania mine, now
known as the Oustomah. Several days
ago men employed in the old works of
the mine came iK?foss the car. It was
buried completely with debris from caved
in workings. Nothing was left but the
bed of the car, the wheels and gear. y It
was standing on the rails Just as It had
been left fifty years ago, when the mine
was abandoned.
The big nugget, the finest ever found
in Southern British Columbia, was at
tached to the rock by beautiful stringers
of gold that ran through and around the
ore. This afternoon $1000 was refused by
thfe owners for the nugget. There is eas
ily $800 of actual value of the yellow
metal.
The find was made on the same claim
that started the recent excitement in that
district. Near it other smaller nuggets
were found, but this big one stands in a
class all by itself. To-night it was
brought down to Kaslo and placed on ex
hibition.
A few feet away from where this nug
get was discovered a shaft is being sunk.
A makeshift, hand-worked hoisting buck
et is being: used, for the camp is very
new, and auantities of fine gold can be
seen clinging to this bucket. In the bed

Thirty-five thousand dollars in cash i
was paid yesterday for a claim lying be
tween what is known as the Lucky Jack
group and the Swede group. The buyers
were J. J. Young of Calgary and Coch
rane Bros, of MacLeod. Mining men who ,
have Just returned to Kaslo say that in
ail their experience they have never seen
anything to come up to the fortunes that
are in sight in the new district. There
is a wood and coal famine in Kaslo and
other towns within a radius of fifty miles,
for workmen and laborers have all left
city jobs to go mining. Men, women and
children have joined the stampede.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 7.â A piece
of gold quartz the size of a man's head,
with a section of pure gold as large as a

made yesterday on the Gold Park claim
in the Poplar Creek district.
A resolution was presented and passed
to the effect that the party still favors
an eight-hour law. The convention then
adjourned.
The platform reaffirms allegiance to tha
principles of the Democratic party as set
forth in the Kansas City platform; de
clares that there should bo no compro
mise with lawlessness, whether it bo in
an individual or a corporation; condemn*
the use of the military arm of the Gov
ernment at any time unless it 13 demon
strated that the civil authorities are un

nounces the State Board of Equalization
for "allowing the corporations to escape

A good many Southern papers declare that the
vote for Vardaman was designed as a rebuke to the
President because of his alleged revival of the race
issue in politics. Such declarations are hardly worth
noting except as an evidence of the deeire of even
the Bourbon Southerners to find an excuse for the
election of such a man on such a platform as Gov
ernor of a Southern State.
The negroes of Mississippi are reported to be
much alarmed over the situation, as the more credu
lous among them are circulating a rumor that it is the
intention of Vardaman to deprive them not only of
their schools, but of their property. A good many
of them have arranged to leave the State, and a wide
spread spirit of distontent and uneasiness exists
among them. Such a feeling will of course disturb
the relations between the two races, and the whites in
the end may suffer as much as the blacks. Evidently
the Democrats of Mississippi have made a mistake,
and no amount of explaining will wholly undo its ill
effects.
victory for Vardaman the Democrats made nomina
tions for candidates for the Legislature, and .in doing
so they assured the election of a Legislature pledged
to maintain the present system of public schools for
white and black. Thus the Legislative vote "cancels
or at least contradicts the vote for Governor, and
outsiders are left to decipher as best they can the
true status of the political sentiment.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALIi, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, . 1903.

The United States Government has assumed the
task of trying to destroy the Japanese slave trade in
the Hawaiian Islands. There is still reason to hope,
therefore, that some day. when Uncle Sam is at peace
with his friends and has nothing else to do, he may
seek to blot out the Chinese slave trade in San Fran
cisco.
It is agreed that Vardaman sought the Democratic
nomination for Governor as art avowed' representa
tive of the "anti-nigger" element in the State., In
the course of his canvass he not only advocated clos
ing all schools for negroes except those that could
be maintained by school taxes paid by negroes, but
he declared himself an opponent of negro education
altogether. On that platform he defeated a conser
vative candidate of high character, receiving the
nomination, which is equivalent to election, and ac
cordingly/will be Governor of Mississippi.
On that showing one might safely conclude that
a majority of the Democratic voters in Mississippi
are of the. reactionary type and would like to reduce
the negro to the old slavery if they could. There
appears to be no other way of understanding the se
lection of such a man as Vardaman to be the stan
dard bearer of the party and Governor of the State.
However, there remains another phase of the story
to hf Mid. In the same contest that resulted in a N

From early morning until the setting sun
more than a thousand merrymakers
roamed the wooded knolls of the park
across the bay and only turned their re
luctant faces cityward when the warn

called them from their sports.

HONOLULU, Sept. 1.â The hottest pre
cinct election Honolulu has ever known
took place last Eaturday for the election
of delegates to the county convention,
to be held September 12, for the nomina
tion of Republican candidates to fill coun
ty offices for the first time in Hawaii.
The county law goes into effect January
4. 1904, and the election will be held on
November 3 of this year.
There were two factions in the Repub
lican party. The regulars were led by
Chairman CrabbÂ£* of the Territorial Cen
tral Committee. The other faction was
led by T. McCants Stewart, a colored
man, who hails from the Carolinas. Stew
art has always been an avowed office
seeker. He left the Democratic ranks
when President Cleveland refused to give
him the District Attorneyship In Kings
County, New York. Failing to secure of
fice In the East, he migrated to Hawaii
scon after annexation, and now poses as
a Republican leader and the savior of his
party. His precinct in the Fifth District
Is known as the "Fighting Seventh."
where he was opposed for control by
Hon. Henry Vida, a member of the Leg
islature. Stewart was swept from his
precinct, not electing a single delegate to
the convention. It was the same through
out the city, the regulars carrying every
thing before them.

WOODLAND, Sept. 7.â Prompt and
courageous work ui>on the part of the
"Woodland volunteer flre department
averted an explosion and possibly great
lo?s thi* afternoon.
Jt was about twenty minutes to 4
o'clock. Two passenger traJnB were al
most due and u. his crowd of people Â¦was
about the depot. The crew of a freight
train which had been left standing on a
tidetrack was at dinner up town. A blaze
was tfiFcovered under the firebox of the
engine, which was an oil burner. The
:reff of the tire department Â¦were hastily
s-ummoned, tÂ»ut before they arrived the
entire tender was enveloped in flames,
which were leaping twenty feet high. The
tank contained Dean? iiiOO gallons of oil.
A big etrrarn of water was soon play
ing on the lire and it was Quickly extin
guished. There is no doubt but that for
the timely arrival of the fire company
the oil tar.k and steam boiler would have
exploded and the lives of many people
would have been endangered. The engine
had to be hauled to the Fhops.

Among the attendants at the picnic
were Dr. W. McFarland and John Glen

the pioneer educators of this State, hav
ing first taken up their abode in Mon

1853, when the capital was moved to the

There were two bands In attendanceâ
St Dominic's, of fifteen pieces, under the
leadership of Rev. Father Welsh, and the
Benicia Band, led by William Ilearn.
Dancing in the big pavilion was the prin
cipal enjoyment of the day and with two
bands there was no lack of music for
those who desired to trip the "light fan
tastic."
There were several clergymen present,
all of whom worked hard to insure the
comfort and pleasure of the guests. The
clergymen included Rev. Father J. B.

disease. He was 73 years of age.
PASS HAPPY DAY
IN MAD FROLICS
"Theron wore a pretty decent-looking
dark suit of clothes, a light colored soft
crowned hat with a black band. He had
a short thick mustache and looked like
he had not had a ehave for ten days."
Immediately upon the receipt of the
news Sheriff Laneford and three Deputy
Sheriffs started for Campbell to take the
trail, but up to a late hour to-night no
word has come from them.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 7.â Joseph Theron, one
of tho Folsom prison escapes, ate break
fast this morning on a county road, in
the edge of the town of Campbell. The
meal was given him by a party of camp
ers, one of whom was F. Kenney, who
says he was formerlv a guard at Folsom
and knows Theron well.
Kenney first teleDhoned to the author
ities at Folsom, who referred the matter
to Sheriff Langford, at the same time
vouching for the fact of Kenney's ac- i
quaintance with Theron and their belief
in his reliability in this matter, though
they said that instead of being a guard
he had been a prisoner there up to April
7 lost. Kenney's story was as follows:
"We were eating breakfast In the edge
of an orchard on Campbell avenue at
7:30 o'clock this mornine when Theron
came up and asked for something to eat.
I recognized him instantly,' but he did
not appear to see me. I did not want him
to and I stepped behind a tree. He sat
down and ate his breakfast leisurely and
when he was through asked where he
could get work. The men pointed to the
surrounding orchards and told hhn he
could get work at any of them.
"He then sauntered off down the ave
nue in a southerly direction. I was con
siderably excited and a little afraid and
I got on the next train and went to Los
Gatos. After thinking the matter over I
j concluded to telephone Warden Wilkin.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.-Although
this was a "legal holiday, the State
Board of Equalization held a session this
afternoon for the accommodation of the
Assessors and other officials of outside
counties.
Lake County was represented by As
sessor C. M. Young. In 1902 the county's
assessed valuation was $3,153,764. This
year's valuation was reported to be $3,-^
253,282. There was a boom in Lake Coun
ty ten or twelve years ago, but In the
last ten years there has been a falling oft
in the population of 1084. The crops tnls
year were short on account of the ab
sence of rain. " .
Ab.out 100 flasks of quicksilver were pro
duced In the county during the year.
The Bradford mine, which was sold for
$100,000, closed down a few years ago. The
springs and the mines are what keep
the county up. The hop raising industry
has been abandoned. The temperance
| people in the county had boycotted the
Â¦ business with the result that the industry
fell down to a very low point.
Nevada County was represented by As
sessor Henry E. Schroeder. The assess
ment of the county In 1902 "was $6,453,015.
This year it Is $6,478,110. The increase in
ten years was $1,350,000. On account of
the suspension of hydraulic mining in
1881 the assessed valuation of the county
was decreased $3,500,000. Ill 18S0 tho as
sessment roll amounted to $9,064,000. In
1889 it fell to $5,473,000.
At that time hydraulic mining was the
principal mining industry. Since then
the mining industry has worked gradual
ly from hydraulic to quartz mining.
There are now six dividend paying mines
in tho county. There are only about twenty
sections of timber land in the county at
the present time. The best assessment on
land outside of mineral land Is $12 50 an
acre. Lowest assessment on non-mlncral
land is about $5 an acre.

Association of San Francisco.

Th* overdue Norwegian bark Arabia, rein
sured for 25 per cent ami generally considered
* somer.-hat dubious risk, arrived yesterday
! from Glasgow, somewhat battered from a
I conflict vlth the elements eft Cape Horn but
in good working trim and with her cargo in
tÂ«ct. She was 1U0 days from Glasgow and
I ISO dajs from Belfast Loch. She left Glasgow
In heavy weather, and from February 19 until
j March 12 Temained at anchor on account of a
, liUeceMion of severe sales. Proceeding on her
' voyage, she was caught in *. southwester
which threw the vessel on her beam ends'
caused the cargo to shift and wrought con
: rl.ieraMe damage about the decks. The Ara
I b!a put into Belfast March Is. trimmed carÂ«o
j effected repaJrs, and March 31 resumed her
; voyage. Off Cape Horn more bad weather was
j encountered, and for ten days a lusty south
westerly gale played shuttlecock and battle
dore v.lth the Arabia. She was thrown on her
beam ends repeatedly and emerged from tho
conflict considerably the worse for wear. Three
boats were ctove in and the pieces, with the
bark's bridge, were washed overboard. The
I cargo shifted, and It was same weeks before
the damage sustained In the Cape Horn battle
could be temporarily repaired. Light winds
for the rest of the voyage were responsible for
the Arabia's appearance on the overdue HÂ«t
at Â£3 per cent. â¢

Two tournaments were completed on
the San Rafael tennis courts yesterday.
A large crowd was in attendance in the
afternoon. In the final3 of the men's
singles Alfonso Bell of Los Angeles beat
Percy Murdock of Alameda. The mixed
doubles honors were carried off by Miss
May Sutton and A. C. Way, also of tne
south. .
The Bell-Murdock match was exceed
ingly close and In doubt until the end.
Murdock had many chances to win. but
lacked the strength- to do so at critical
times. As In the Bell-Sailth match, Bell
wore his opponent down and finally beat
him out on condition/
On strokes Murdock was easily the
equal of his opponent. In the first set
Murdock led at 6-5 and 3(*-0, but lost. 8-6.
In the second set he had a still bigger
lead and at 5-3 looked to have the set
won. In the next game Murdock led at
30-0, but again Bell pulled out.
In the third set Murdock played r-ome
great tennis and won. 6-4. The effort in
this set, however, used him up completely
and the J- fourth and deciding set went to
Bell quite easily. The complete score
was 8-6, 7-5, .4-6, 6-2.
Murdock .played the game of his life
yesterday 'and certainly mads a great
fight, but Bell is undoubtedly, a hard man
to beat. He plays a steady game, excep
tionally strong at the net and never
seems to tire. A peculiar feature of the
match- was â¢. the number of games each
player, lost on his 'own service. Murdock
outsmashed "his opponent, but did 'not
volley as well. By virtue of his victory'
yesterday Bell will play Champion Free
man on Wednesday.
In the seml-flnals of the mixed doubles
Miss May Sutton and A. C. Way and
Miss Florence Sutton and J. D. MacGav
in furnished the most exciting match of
the tournament. Miss May and Way
won the first set easily, 6-3. The second
set, after 25-5 had been reached, was very
close and went up to 11-9. Miss Florence
and MacGavln had a lead of 5-2, but were
unable to win out. Miss Florence sup
ported her partner excellently, but their
opponents were too aggressive at the net.
The score was 6-3, 11-9.
The final match was a one-sided affair,
the outcome of which was never In
doubt. Mrs. Seymour and L. R. Freeman
were opposed to Miss May Sutton and
Way. The latter won, 6-0. 6-3. Freeman
tried hard to stave off defeat, but most
of the balls were played to his partner.
This afternoon the challenge match in
men's doubles which was postponed from
last Saturday will be played. L. R. Free
man and A. E. Bell (hoiders) will be op
posed to Grant Smith and Drummond
MacGavln (challengers). This is the last
chance of a northern victory, as in both
the men's and women's singles the con
testants are southerner.*. The northern
men are hardly in their best form, but
are considered to have an excellent
chance of .winning. The match will be
played at 2:30.

Yfiars of Severe
Heart Trouble.
Obtained No Relief
Until I Tried
Dr. Miles* Heart Cure-
It Cured Me.
Since the advent of Dr. Miles' Heart Cere
the general public has learned to know that
heart disease is curable. Fluttering, palpi-
tation, shortness cf breath and heart pair.s
rapidiy disappear before its magic influence.
It is unequalled zs a heart and blood tonic.
"My cise xvas one of long standing. AÂ«
early in life as my thirty-sixth year, or more
partiruJarly November. 1853, when returning
hoir.e frcin a joumev, I vras taken with a se-
vere congestive chill, which caaÂ«ed my whole
frame to shake, end which a noted physician
pronounced a case of severe congestion of the
licart. From thrt time on for thirty years I
gradually becatse enfeebled in health, until
1892, rny sufferings became intense from
shortness of breath and palpitation of the
heart. 1 could obtain no permanent relief,
although I spent much money in procuring
raedicJJ advics, until I took several bottles
of Dr. Miles' New Cure for the Heart. I
continued the remedy until ray health was
restored, and zlwzys keep a supply on hand
for any emergency. I am now past 70 years
of age and weigh 176 pounds. I have also
used Dr. Miles' Nerve and Liver Pills, Anti-
Pain Pills and Nerve Plasters with good res-
suits. The Anti Pain Pills proved most
effective in a most painful attack of neu*
ralgia, and also for sciatica. It is rny exper>
ience that the remedies can be relied upon
absolutely every time they are' propÂ«rly
used."â Vv. G. Koweks, Beaver City, Utah.

I have never as yet challenged Mr. Parry
to Join in a debate, but I say now I will
challenge Mr. Parry to a debate upon the la
bor question and the labor movement not
necessarily before a great public gathering
although I will do that if It please* him but
1 am willing to meet him In debate before
any economic association that he may select
1 will meet him before the Indianapolis Min
isterial Association or the Manufacturers' As
sociation or that of any other city in AmÂ«rica
I challenge him to submit the report that he
prepared for the last convention Â«t Xew Or
leans to the mxt convention of the Manufac
turer*' Association and ask the convention to
indorse al! he said in that report. He knows
that the National Manufacturers' Association
will not be committed to such an unjustifiable
and unreasonable attack on organized labor
Organized labor has' no feeling against Mr.
Parry. It has r.o denlgns against his life, his
children or the safety of his property. He
is as eafe Irom labor as is President Roose
velt.
A strike may bring about strife and discord,
but as soon as it is done, better feelings are
engendered and mutual respect is brought
about. I don't think I would care to have
a atrtke in Mr. Parry's factory, but I don't
believe It would be an unmixed evil, for he.
might learn the lesson that Mr. Baer has
learnedâ that there is something to arbitrate,
to discuss, to concede.
To-<3ay we have great machines of labor,
new tools of labor, dividing and subdividing
the labor performed, specialization of Industry
going on. the worker doing a thousand, aye.
ten thousand times over and over a little
given thing la the great beehives of industry,
and all these machines propelled by the power
of steam and electricity. Xow, I ask every
thoughtful man and woman within the sound
of tny voice, I ask any one who may perhaps
have the ouoortunity of reading anything I
may eay this afternoon, how can a workman,
an individual workman, act upon his own ini
tiative and from his own volition? Where can
he act as an individual to try to 6ccure im
provement in his condition, much less protec
tion against a great corporation?
Some eay the workingmen lore their indi
viduality when they join a union of labor. In
the United States the workingman has lost his
individuality just as coon as he enters one of
our great modern industrial plants.
President Gompers turned his attention
to D. M. Parry, president cf the National
Manufacturers' Association! He said
Parry had constituted himself the savior
ot society and civilization. His references
to Parry were from the standpoint of
ridicule. Gompers said in closing:
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., Sept. 7. -The
Labor day parade to-day was the largest
ever seen here. The address of the day
was delivered this afternoon by Samuel
Gompers, president of the American Fed
eration of Labor. He said in part:

POUGHKEEPSIE. N. Y., Sept. 7.-Theo
dore Shaffer, president of the Amalga
mated Association of Iron Workers, who
has been missing from hls^home in Pitts
burg, surprised the labor unions of this
city to-day by appearing at the Labor day
celebration. He had been announced as
the orator of the day, but owing to the
published accounts of his disappearance
Herman R*oblnson of New York, secretary
of the New York Central Labor Union,
was invited to take his place.'
Robinson was received by the commit
tee and escorted to the Hudson River
Driving Park, where more than 1000 per
sons were assembled. Just before Robin
son was introduced Shaffer arrived in a
cab and made his way tp ' the platform,
not recognized by the crowd. He looked
pale and showed signs of exhaustion.
After Robinson's addre'ss President Shaf
fer was introduced. In a husky voice he
said^ â¢
' The thing I would moat gladly do Is to keep
still and say nothing. Two years ago I made a
mistake by trying to make 13,000 people hear
me and as a result of such efforts I am re
duced physically. Nine months ago I made
three speeches in one day, and I will not again
allow people to use me up In that way.
That was all the reference he made to
himself and he then proceeded with evi
dent difficulty to make a brief speech.
When asked to make a statement he said
that he was anxioiia to make one and ar
ranged with the reporters to meet them at
the Nelson House at 7 o'clock , to-night.
He was then driven away in company
with John Bradley, a prominent local la
bor man. It' was found that he had not
been at the Nelson . House at all and a
thorough search, of -the -city- failed to re
veal any trace of either Shaffer or Brad
ley. It is : believed that Shaffer hurried
away from .the city. '

BERLIN, Sept. .".â Herr Rebel's articles
on the vice presidency of the Reichstag,
which he Is opposed to the Socialist party
accepting, have betn declined by the edi
tor of the Vorwaerts and therefore the
late autocrat of the party., has been
obliged to have them printed in less im
portant Socialist papers. The significance
of this is that the Vorwaerts is the
party's central organ and is owned col
lectively and controlled by a committee
designated by the party organization. It
is taken to mean that leaders like Herr
Bernstein, who differ from Herr Bebel
on the party policy and favor accepting
a vice presidency, have obtained the up

Pacific Parlor of this city has secured
the large hall in the St. James Hotel in
San Jose, which is ' admirably adapted
for dancing and it has engaged a number
of rooms sufficient to accommodate the
large number of members who are to. b6
in. line in the parades in, the , two cities.
The parlor will keep open -house all day
on thÂ« 9th and will have a grand ball in
the evening, having secured the- San. Jose
City Orchestra, which performs at the
Alum Rock Park. This, will furnish con
cert music during the afternoon and
dance music at night. This parlor In the
past always had a first-class brass band
to accompany It, but- this year ' it could
not make terms that were satisfactory to
it. so the band will not play. On arrival
in San Jose to-night the members of the
Athens Parlor of Oakland I has* secured
new uniforms for the occasion, consist
ing of white flannel trousers and coats,
white silk vestlets, white Fedora hats,
white neckties and white canvas shoes,
and each member will carry a white para
sol with golden streamers. Among those
who have been very active in the ar
rangements for the celebration ' by this
parlor may be named Louis A.- Lefevre,
vice president of the committee of ar
rangements; E. J. Russell, a member 'of
that committee, and Dr. W. H. Abbey, a
member of the joint 9th of September
committee.

PACIFIC SECURES HALL.
It ia expected that between five and
Bix thousand people will leave this city
by the broad-gauge trains that will, carry
excursionists this afternoon and to-night
and by the regular and specials to-mor
row forenoon. Whatver profit may be
derived from the sale of tickets will this
year not be divided among tho parlors,
as in the past, but will be turned over
to the Native Sons' committee that has
charge of arranging for the exercises that
are to be held at the launching of the
cruiser California, now being built at the
Union Iron "Works.
FROM the preparations that have
been made by the Native Sons of
the Golden "West, represented "In
the joint 9th of September cele
bration committee, in which are
delegates from the parlors of the order
!n San Francisco, Alameda and Marln
counties, and by what has been done by
the parlors of Santa Clara County, as
sisted by the membership of the parlors
in Santa Cruz and Monterey, it is evident
that the festivities in San Jose to-mor
row will surpass any previously held In
that city in honor of the admission of
the State into the Union. " :
The interest manifested in the event
was apparent at the meeting of the Joint
committee held in Native Sons' Hall,
when more than thirty parlors were rep
resented, a larger representation than
was ever had in such a committee since
the monster celebration in this city in

Thornton employs a large number of
teamsters, all of whom are members of
the union, and has never had any trouble
with the organization before to-day.
CHICAGO, Sept 7.-J. J. Thornton, the
proprietor of a warehouse and van com
pany, was assaulted to-day during: tho
labor parade for driving one of his own
teams without having a union card in his,
possession. Thornton hitched three horses
to one of his vans In the morning and
took a score or more of children to see
the parade. He attempted to haul noth
ing but h!s guests. For three hours ho
stood with his wagon at the corner of
Jackson boulevard and Clark street and
watched the parade, and when he at
tempted to drive away he was stopped
by some of the teamsters in the parade,
who asked if he had a union card. He
tried to explain that he needed no card,
that it was his own team and that he was
doing no hauling. Several hundred men
gathered around the wagon and attempt
ed to drag- him off. An escort of police
enabled him to get several blocks away,
when a mob numbering fully 1000 caught
up with him. He whip|Â«d up his horses,
and for nearly a mlle*fie was pursued,
when finally the mob cut the harness of
his horses into small pieces, beat the
animals with canes, compelling them to
run away and then beat Thornton badly.
Th* particular facts which were in isstue in

of the record the motion to vacate the order

in the Justice's count must be denied.
Tlie motion is based upon the alleged fact

woman's monthly suffering is
permanently relieved by Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
"I have never before given my en-
dorsement- for any medicine, but
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound has added so much to my
life and happiness that I feel like mak-
ing' an exception in this case. For two
years every month. I would have two
days of severe pain and 'â¢ould find no
relief, but one day while visiting a
friend I ran across Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound,â
she had used it with the best results
and advised me to try it. I found
that' it worked wonders with me ; I
now experience no pain, and only had
to use a few bottles to bring about
this wonderful change." â Miss Alice

Conditions in Honolulu, acccrdlngr to
Carter, are steadily improving and the
expenditure of this $1,000,000 is absolutely
necessary to enable the Territory to keep
up with the march of progress and handle
intelligently the problems that are al
ready looming up big and complex before
the administrators of tne affairs of
greater Hawaii.
On the* Sonoma was also E. R. Stack
able, Collector of Customs for the district
of Hawaii. He comes to San Francisco
to meet Assistant Secretary of the United
States Treasury R. B. Armstrong, who Is
due here to-morrow, and Collector of the
Port Stratton, with whom he will confer
regarding irregularities and methods of
the Hawaiian customs service. It is un
derstood that one of the matters that will
receive theJr attention will be the order,
made some time ago and recently rescind
ed, whereby the baggage of passengers on
through steamers was examined at Hon
olulu. The order resulted in many com
plaints and it is supposed that it was
rescinded for this reason. There is to
be a meeting of collectors of customs of
the various ports of the United States
in New Tork in October and it is pos
sible that Assistant Secretary Armstrong
will order Collector Stackable there to
represent Hawaii.
George R. Carter, secretary cf the Ter
ritory of Hawaii, arrived here yesteday
from Honolulu on the liner Sonoma. He
is on his way to Washington to secure
the approval of President Roosevelt to
a $1,000,000 loan for needed improvements
in the Territory. After securing the
chief executive's permission Carter' will
proceed to New York, where he hopes to
float the ponds with little difficulty.
This loan of $1,000,000 was provided for
in the Territorial organic act. The money
is needed for the construction of school
buildings, the building of roads for the
opening of new country, for an insane
asylum, the improvement of the harbor
of Honolulu and other public Improve
ments. Everything necessary to the is
suance of the bonds has been arranged
except the approval of President Roose
velt, which is required by the organic
act. Carter expectrf^no difficulty in car
rying out his mission so far as the chief
executive is concerned, and thinks there
should be little delay in floating the
bonds. Hawaii, he says, has a gilt edged
reputation In the matter of financial re
sponsibilities.
The bonds will be redeemable in from
five to fifteen years and will bear 5 per
cent interest.
, Mrs. La Schelle interrupted to say that
Mrs., Green was troubled with .asthma
and also suffered from pains in the shoul

Mrs. La Schelle listened to the entire in

is much younger than Green. Her son.

the Â¦ conversation:

This whole story 13 made up to injure me.
They have no cause for it. I never injured a
person in my life. I pay my debts, and the
merchants will say I am a good citizen. My
first two wives died of consumption. They
were relatives and consumption was hereditary
in their family. My third wife died In Cali
fornia, and Dr. Bryan of Gllroy said she had
consumption of the bowels. My fourth wife is
divorced. Mrs. Scales was my fifth wife.

ready to appear before any court and swear to
what I have told you.
Mrs. La Schelle explains her presence
at the funeral by the statement that she
was a friend of the dead woman and if
she stayed away there would be more
gossip.
In an interview to-night rGreen made
the following statement: t"
They (meaning people of Watsonviile) started
this talk about my wife's death, because two
days after the funeral I went to court and was
myself made administrator of her estate. T did
this on the advice of my lawyer and two of
Mrs. Green's closest Â«nd best friends. The
property value has not been fixed, but it will
not amount to more than $10,000. She owned
this house and held a mortgage of $llt.O on a
ranch In this county.
She denies that she ever quarreled with
Mrs. Green. She swears she was never
sent away from the house, but went at
the recsuest of Mrs. Green, who secured
her employment looking after Mrs.
"Wright, mother of a -well known lumber
man of this city, who was suffering from
blood poisoning. She states that Mrs.
Green told her to come back as soon as
she finished.
Mrs. La Schelle's connection with the
case has given the gossips a great chance
to talk. She comes from Forbestown,
Butte County. She came to Watsonviile
some years ago in quest of employment
and took ur> her residence with "W. R.
Blbby'and wife, who were, living in the
lodging-house conducted by Green. She
"became acquainted with Green, it is al
leged,'and a liking sprung up between
them. Mrs. La Schelle made herself use
ful around the house and her presence
was indispensable.

- Mr. Baker had been complaining for
quite a while of nor. feeling well and it is
supposed that death was caused by an
attack of heart disease, aggravated by
the shock of the cold water.
In early days Mr. Baker was a promi
nent newspaper man, but in his later
years he was engaged In other\ occupa
tions. Some years ago he married Miss
Freda Galllck, an actress. The dead man
had relatives in Milwaukee.* He was 65
years -old.
Colgate Baker, at one time a prominent
journalist, died suddenly yesterday morn
ing in his lodgings at 1149 Larkin street.
It had been his custom to rise early and
take a cold sponge bath while standing
at the sink. His nude body was found
by thfg housekeeper, the forehead resting
on the sink, against which he had fallen.
The body was wet and the sponge, which
was lying near the right hand, was satu
rated with water.

COLGATE BAKER DIES
WHILE TAKING A BATE
District Attorney Knight Is wroth at
the county officials for not Informing him |
immediately that the circumstances sur
rounding the death of Mrs. Green were
mysterious. He says he would have had !
an opportunity of sifting the entire mat
ter and fixing the blame, If there was
any, on the proper party. Sheriff Trafton
was the one who started the investiga
tion. He received an anonymous com.
munication a few days after the death
of Mrs. Green which read as follows:
"I presume that you have seen In the
papers that Mrs. Elvira J. Green met her
death by the gas route. From one who
knows the Inside. If you wou.d Investi
gate the matter, you might find that the
death was not as accidental as it seemed
to be."
Sheriff Trafton was loth to pay atten
tion to the communication. The anony-.
mous writer, however, suggested that if
he desired to learn more he might put
an advertisement In one of the papers
that "H. V. T. would like to learn more"
and he would call upon him and give him
the" desired information. The Sheriff
thereupon advertised and his unknown
correspondent called ' upon him and en
lightened him considerably about the
daily life of ;Mr. and Mrs. Green and
said something. about Mrs. La Schelle.
..The" Sheriff, reported what, he had
: learned to the District Attorney and the
latter advised frraf ton: to investigate. The

TIGATING AND FORMER HOME.
There are many good points in the sup
porting cast. Miss Virjrinia Brissac as the
daughter being prominently among them.
Miss Brissac is a clever young woman
with an appcalingly girlish air, a pretty
voice and general attraction. Her Gladys
was conspicuous for its dainty simplicity
and charming naturalness. Marie Howe
has done nothing better than her old Irish
servant The rele is a good one. and
Miss Howe brought a strong sense of fun
and refreshing buoyancy to its acting.
The men comparatively have small
All of Miss Roberts' good conscience and
familiar sincerity are in best evidence in
her Mrs. Hatch. She suggests the mother
hunger with a sweetness never overdone.
Hashes into a convincing fury at meeting
the woman who wrecked her home, shows
graceful g-erstleness and dignity in her
relations with the man who would marry
her, and presents throughout a well-bal
anced, thoughtful portrait. She shows all
of her accustomed emotional grip in the
big scene. Perhaps there is a tint too
much of the Bohemian in her first scene
with Adrian, a recklessness that Is not
wholly in keening with the situation.
But it is one cf the best things Miss Rob
erts has given us, rounded out and
smoothed into a very human convincing
whole.
By the erace of a two weeks' run I
made ray late acquaintance with "The
Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch" last night at the
Alcazar, along with an audience that
matched the first night's in size and
noise. The week has doubtless added
much to the smoothness of the perform
ance. It went on rubber tires last night
and as a production is one of the most
satisfying the Alcazar has offered of late.
One has learned to look for at least
one important novelty during the annual
â¢visits cf Miss Florence Roberts to the
Alcazar. This year the popular actress
has two to offer, in D'Annunzio's "La
Gioconda." to be presented for the first
time here on Thursday afternoon next.
and the current bill. "The Unwelcome
Mrs. Hatch," a comedy by Mrs. Burton
Harrison. The Harrison play proves to
be a particularly happy medium for Miss
Roberts. Further it is a play of sus
tained and at times striking interest, and
lends itself luckily to the Alcazar re
sources. Its central episode is one to
command sympathy and Mrs. HaVrison's
handling of her material is throughout
effective and unhackneyed. The motive
cf the playâ the love of a presumably
erring mother for her daughterâ attracts
the maudlin, but the player has neatly
avoided this pitfall. In the humorous and
philosophic fiber of the character of Mrs.
Hatch Mrs. Harrison has saved It from
Iru' impending sentimentality, and in its
Sensitive, impulsive, willful quality is
cleverly suggested the reason lor the
â¢woman's separation from her cold-blooded
husband.
In the first act the mother, who has not
tees her daughter for twelve years, ac
ceding to the promise, returns to her
home en hearing of the girl's coming mar
riage She implores her former husband s
permission to see the girl, and the lirst act
has a striking scene between the mother,
father and the lawyer who secured their
divorce. She received the desired per
mission to see the girl at a picnic given to
street waifs in Central Park, but may not
ppcak with her. The scene with the chil
dren is handled with a good deal of point
and fun in the production, some very
clever little tikes taking part. Ollie Coop
er's cynic remark on the wonderful dra
gon story of Mrs. Hatch was a particular
ly bright spot. However the climax was
reached when in "Eatt Lynne" fashion
Mrs. Hatch returns to her home in dis
guise as a dressmaker's assistant, to try
on her daughter's wedding gown. Here
siie meets the second wife, the "other
â¢womaji" of h<?r story, and the scene be
tween the two crackles. The rest Is
explanation and the death of Mrs. Hatch.
â¢Delegates-elect to the Democratic con
vention are considering the merits of the
many candidates for the Board of Super
visors. W. M. Clack, merchant, corner
of Market and Haight streets, is on the
acceptable list. It is regarded as certain
that a nomination will be tendered to
him. The importance of nominating good
men for the board seems to be appreci
ated by the delegates to the respective
conventions. In the Republican camp an
effort will be made to give each Assembly
district a nominee for Supervisor. As the
legislative apportionment now stands the
number of Assembly districts in San Fran
cisco corresponds with the number of Su
pervisors provided for by the charter. It
is an open question whether the Demo
cratic and Union Labor conventions will
go so far in the indorsement of home rule
principles as to recognize the right of
each district to name the nominee for the
local legislature.
"It is the common impression in Repub
lican ranks that Auditor Harry Baehr,
Tax Collector E. J. Smith and Treasurer
J. E. McEougald will be renominated in
recognition of the excellent official record
made by each. Many of the Treasurer's
friends are urginc him to get into the
contest for Mayor, but he expresses a de
sire for renomination to the office that
he now holds.
United States Senator Thomas R. Bard
advises his friends that he will return
from Europe in October. If an extra
session Is called he will remain in the
East until the adjournment.
It Is expected that the Regents of the
State University at their meeting to-day
will consider the subject of electing an
attorney of the board to succeed Major
Mhoon. Three candlda^s may be voted
forâ Charles E. Snook, Warren Olney Jr.
and Osgood Putnam. There are indica
tions that the attendance of Regents will
bevlarge. Judge McKinley of Los An
geles Is in the city and expects to at
tend the session. Lieutenant Governor
Anderson, Speaker Fisk and Superintend
ent of Common Schools Thomas J. Kirk
will probably be present. Governor Par
dee was in Oakland yesterday and ex
pects to be in Chlco to-morrow.
The Thirty-sixth Assembly District del
egation to the Republican local conven

â¢â¢ When mj little girl was six monthi

creams and all kinds of remcdleu but
aothing did her any good, in fact she
kept getting worse. I used to wrap her

I had to put her on the table for I conld
