\ a thicket, near Davisville. The deputies covered him with their guns and he quittly submitted
to arrest. He informed his captors that he had been in Sacramento with Convict Hozvard,
and that they had parted company. It is believed that Howard is hiding in Yolo County. Blood
hounds were put on the trail of the other escapes, but failed to take up the scent.

While Roberts was in the Davisville jail he was interviewed bv a Call
representative. At first 'he declined to talk to a newspaper man. btrt later
was induced to tell something about his flight. He began bv declaring
that the report' that the convicts cut Warden ; Wilkinson*s clothes was false.
They were all rifcht when Wilkinson was released, he said, and if they were
slashed when he returned to prison the -Warden did it' himself.
Roberts was dressed in a striped shirt, brown pantaloons and a dark vest.
He carried a pair. of tan shoes. besides the heavy leather ones he wore. The Jailer
came in with . supper for Roberts while The Call representative was In the cell.
He ate heartily and -as a result- talked with; more Â¦ freedom. â¢ He 'expressed the
opinion" that the prison authorities wanted- to hang him ; for the murder of Guard
Cotter. He declared. he was innocent of any complicity in that crime. He sa.'d he
was in the laundry, when the fight in the office- occurred 'and joined the conspira
tors while they, were on the, way, to the armory. '
The officers \ are of the \ opinion that Roberts is, the. man who carried out the
dynamite to blow. up. the gate and abandonedit when the gate was opened by a
som who knows both Roberts and Howard, but . they , found no trace of
either of the meii wanted. . They were about to abandon the search in that
"direction when one of the. officers suggested a thicket on the south side of
the creek known as Hamel Island. About'three hundred yards from the rail
road bridgethe posse suddenly came upon 'Roberts lying under a tree. He
had been asleep," and awoke to find the officers : covering him with their
guns. He was armed. with a"45-caliber revolver, but as resistance was hope
less he held up his hands when commanded,' until, they were handcuffed. He
made no attempt to deny his identity, but insisted that he parted with How
ard in Sacramento and made the trip to Davisville alone. He was taken to
the Davisville jail, where he" was confined, until the officers made a further
but fruitless search for- Howard,. The, Sacramento posse took the prisoner in
a surrey and left for Sacramento about 6 o'clock to-night, going by way of
Elkhorn, hoping to induce him en route to give them information concern
ing the other convicts. e .

supposed to' be that of the patriot, Em

that of a man 6 feet high, whereas Em
met was only 5 feet 7 inches.
A curious circumstance in connection
with the examination was that the skull,
instead of being found lying prone at the
head of the trunk, was found lying in an
upright position, which as Emmet was
beheaded, may strengthen the theory that
the remains were his. But the matter is
still regarded as doubtful.

Mclllhatton experienced immediate re
lief and tho operation was pronounced
flawless. The explosion of the electrical
current caused coagulation of the con
tents of the aneurism, which thereby
shrank, relieving the pressure upon lungs
and larynx.-
The wire was then connected with a
galvanic battery and the circuit was com
pleted by the placing of a negative plate
upon the patient'B back and a current of
five milliamperes was turned on. This
was increased at regular intervals until
it had attained the strength of eighty
milliamperes and one -hour's time had
been consumed. 'â¢/Â¦ \
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 5.â The life of
Frank Mclllhatton has been saved by an
exceedingly rare surgical operation. The
man was suffering from an aneurism, or
dilation, of the great artery, which ex
tended three inches above the base of
the breastbone and was three and a half
inches wide. As a result of this enlarge
ment he had become unable to swallow
and had great difficulty in breathing and
suffered excruciating pains in the head.
To save his life it was necessary to reduce
the aneurism and to do that the hospital
physicians had recourse to what is known
as the "Corridls operation." Mclllhatton
was able to talk to his wife five minutes
after the task of the surgeons was com
pleted and is reported as doing well.
The operation was performed by Pro
fessor E. W. Holmes, surgeon in chief
of the Samaritan Hospital, assisted by
Dr. Dietrich, Dr. Snively and Dr. Finck.
Many prominent men in the profession
were spectators. Cocaine was applied
to the affected portion of the aorta, the
disease lying In the transverse section,
or arch of the artery. A hollow, porce
lain-covered needle was introduced into
the aneurism and a section of gold wire
fifteen feet long was passed through the
hollow of the instrument and permitted
to coll in the diseased region.

ROME. Aug. B.â The news .that- the
Austrian Emperor vetoed the elec
tion of Cardinal Rampolla has been
confirmed by.' all of - tho Cardinals.
In the ballot taken on Saturday after
noon Cardinal Rampolla obtained twenty
nine votes, an increase on the. morning
ballot. On Sunday morning Cardinal
Gruscha received a telegram from Em
peror Francis Joseph containing his veto
against Cardinal ' Rampolla. Cardinal
Gruscha showed this dispatch to Cardinal
On>glia . and the Camerlingo communi
cated the information to the Sacred Col
lege before the vote was taken.
The veto caused a profound sensation,
as it was absolutely unexpected. Car
dinal Rampolla at once, stood up. Ho
was very pale. He declared he felt quite
unworthy of being elected Pope and that
the veto did not disculet his conscience,
for he had always â¢ acted exclusively in
the interests of the church.
Cardinal Oreglia delivered a similar
speech of pretest In the- ballot which
succeeded Cardinal Hampolla obtained one
vote more than on the previous day, but
his opponents thrreupon renrewed the
campaign against, him. urging that if he
were elected Pope 1 the Holy See would
immediately be thrown into conflict not
only with France and Italy, as during the
reign of Leo XIII, but also with Austria
and Germany, all of the Cardinals being
convinced that the Austrian Emperor's
veto was instigated by-the-Kaiser.
~*lt Is certain that the Austrian Emper
or's exercise of his right of veto will
cause much discussion, as through it
Cardinal Sarto's election represents the
success of a candidate favored by him,
or. it should perhaps be said, by the
Kaiser.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 5.â Although
disappointed at Cardinal Rampolla's de
feat, the newspapers accept Sarto's elec
tion with good grace. They regard it as
a compromise between the followers of
Cardinals Seraflno Vannutelll and Ram
polla, and therefore deny that the Ger
man element has won a victory. The new
Pontiff is regarded here as the possessor
of statesmanlike, practical and adminis
trative qualities and one who will pur
sue a cautious political policy and likely
to effect changes in the religious field of
tho church rather than its political
sphere.
The Government la disposed to regard
the new Pope as a pure Vannutellist and
an opponent of Cardinal Rampolla. A re
turn to the belligerent policy of Pius IX,
however, is regarded as unlikely, and the
Government is confident of maintaining
Its Influence over the Catholic church In
Russia. .The Polish Catholics favored
Cardinal Oreglia, as being the last sur
viving Cardinal appointed by Pius IX,
but are somewhat consoled, however, by
Sarto's assumption of the title of Pius X.

Pope Pius wished to see personally most
of the innumerable telegrams of con
gratulation received, giving instructions
for the answers to those for which he cared
most, and looked at the copies, changing
here and there a word. Then he prepared
for this mornings' state reception of the
Cardinals in the Slstine Chapel, which
during the night had been cleared of its
temporary furniture, used for the' bal
lots, and was assuming its normal aspect.
The third and last obedience of the
Sacred College was consummated this
morning with the same ceremonialas be
fore in the Slstine Chapel, the Pone be
ing in his full pontifical robes, and pal
pably restored in mind and nerves by a
night's . rest. The Cardinals filed before
him and kissed his hand and foot, all
smiling and apparently in a perfectly con
tented frame of mind. They themselves
In turn received a hearty embrace from
Plus X. The music was directed by Abbe
Perossi, who was the Pontiff's protege, all
present remarking how the Slstine choir
had improved its method since being un
der the abbe's care. Every available cor
ner of the small chapel was filled this
morning and those present seemed to for
get Plus X in their pleasure In the mag
nificent harmony of the voices of the
choir and the feast of color as they rested
their eyes on the pictures before them.
The ceremony ended about noon.

X- being the first journalist of any na

At 7-15 o'clock the Pope said mass, as
sisted by Monsignor Bressan, his conclav
ist. He. afterward took breakfast, which
consisted of only coffee, milk and a roll.
Then, as he stood against the window
from which he caught a glimpse of the
gardens of the Vatican, the Pontiff ex
claimed:
ROME, Aug. 5.â Pope Pius X arose at
5:30 o'clock this morning. He slept last
night in the apartment occupied by Car

is situated on the second floor of the Vati

cerning the Pontiff's ultimate quarters,
but it is already said that he desires them
to be extremely modest.

A report was received here late to-night
that the five convicts in the Cat Creek
country are to-night less than live miles
from the spot where they camped last
night. The fugitives traveled all day to
day, but lost their way, traveling in a cir
cuitous route and bringing up to-night
with little to show for the day's work and
in much greater danger of meeting posses
than at any time since leaving the Grand
Victory mine region on Saturday night.
Reports to-night from Olita brought
there by a man in a team were that
Sheriff Norman on leaving Olita early this
morning said no trustworthy reports of
his movements could be received by the
outer world until he sent a mounted mes
senger back to Volcano, which has a pri
vate telephone to Olita, a distance of
twelve miles. Olita has a telephone to
Plymouth and that place with PlacerviUe.
Reports say the convicts are* in a trap
on account of the trailers being behind
them and Norman with his posse ahead
of them and that the-outlaws will be am
bushed by the Sheriff and killed. If
they try to double on their track the con
victs will meet the professional- trailers,
who are sure shots.
PLACERVILLE, Aug. 5.â Sheriff Bos
quit has received no news to-night from
the three professional trailers who are
following the five convicts who ambushed
the soldiers or from Sheriff Norman of
Amador County who, with posse, is now
in the southeast portion of El Dorado
near Cat Creek, many miles from com
munication.

Pius likes not only to walk but to climb.
A few days before he left Venice for
Rome he ascended Mount Grappa, 5500
feet high. But his greatest enjoyment is
music. He ia a great friend and admirer
of Lorenzo Perossl. the eminent director
of the Pontifical Choir, who was former
ly maestro at St. Mark's, Venice. Perossi
is chiefly indebted to him for his musical
career.
In all of the excitement of his first
triumph he keÂ»t his word and went to
the telephone station and called up the
number only to find that Mgr. Stratlmi
rovich already knew the result of the
balloting and was then on his way to the
Vatican.
No no fear for me. Tell me the number cf
your telephone ami I will let you know who
receives that honor.
He was sincere in thinking that he
would not be made Pope. M. Stratimlro
vlch, thÂ« Venetian prelate, accompanied
him to Rome and up to the door of the
conclave, and in taking leave, as usual,
hoped that Cardinal Sarto would be made
Pope. His Eminence replied, laughing:
I shall have white robes Instead of red. That
will be the only change. I shall remain the
same Sarto as ever.
When in the past people asked Cardinal
Sarto what he would do if made Pope,
referring to his modesty and affability,
he replied:
ROME, Aug. 5.â A few anecdotes show
what sort of a man is Pius X. His posi
tion as patriarch of Venice brought him
from $2000 to $2400 a year, which did not
go far when he had paid the bills for
all of his numerous charities. So when
he was called suddenly to leave Venice
he often found himself without money.
Once, when he had come to Rome, he
was without a cent and did not know
where to turn. He was finally obliged to
borrow $400 from a bank and was in a
perfect fever until the debt was paid.
He has a nephew, John Baptlste Sarto.
who, notwithstanding the relation, is only
the archpriest of the small village of Pes
sagno.

The credit of to-day's important catch, the first of the exciting man hunt of
the past week, belongs to the deputies of Sheriff Reese, composed of his son,
Edward Reese, and Deputies George wHtenbrock and Jack Hunter, aided by
Constable Hainllne.of Davisville. The deputies acted upon one of many rumors
which were afloat last night, and that they selected one based on fact is evi
denced by the outcome. Last night two nien were seen at a late hour emerging
from Chinatown bareheaded and with rifles upon their shoulders. They were
soon lost in the darkness that hangs over the river wharves and were not again
seen. - . . ..
Roberts since his capture, told the officers that he sent a man into China
town at Sacramento. .to. get some opium and bring It to himself and Howard, but
it Is believed that they were so desperately in need of the drug that they took
the risk of entering Chinatown In quest of it, relying upon the lateness of the^/
hour to prevent^ detection.
In a statement to-night Deputy Sher Iff Reese said the convict who had brought
information to his office concerning the fugitives this morning said he was afraid
the other convicts would kill him. He h as been In Sacramento only a short time
from Folsom and had started out to Va cavIIle to Pick fruit. In company with an
other ex-convict. They had gone but a short distance on the Yolo trestle, when
Roberts', whom the ex-convict named "Smiley," accosted them.
"Smiley," according to the ex-convic 1 ' 3 story, drew a revolver and said he
wanted the informant to go with him. Roberts took him over to Davisville, and
this morning Roberts sent him to the drug store for opium. He got him the
drug and went back and told Roberts that he (the ex-convict) had got a job in a
livery stable and that he would like to go to work. So he left Roberts there and
came over and told Reese.
The ex-convict informed Reese that Roberts was lying in a brushy creek just
beyond Davisville. It was at that point that the capture took place.
Roberts on the way from Davisville to Sacramento told Deputy Sheriff
Reese that the convicts were forced to make their break at Folsom; that they
were not treated impartially at the prison; that they were fed on rotten pota
toes and rotten stew.
Roberts claimed that he left Howard at Sacramento after a quarrel aris
ing over the desire of Howard to go Into town for opium in daylight. He claim
ed Howard was not with him in Yolo County. This story is not credited, as it .
is thought Roberts desires to protect Howard by concealing his whereabouts.
i One of the ex-convicts said Howard was on his way to Slssons. Roberts ad
mitted that It was his and Howard's tracks that Sheriff Reese had discovered
near Ben All, on the rancho Del Paso.
Roberts said Gordon left the band of escapes at the bridge at Mormon Isl
and. He said he did not know anything about the battle at the Grand Victory
mine except what he had read in the papers.
for some time, walking around anxious
as If waiting for some one. Following
the trail Bosquit discovered the marks of
rubber heeled shoes. It is known that
Case took a pair of rubber heeled shoes
from Stage Driver Brown of Folsom
Penitentiary, Brown being one of the men
the convicts took with them from -the
prison on the day of the outbreak. A well
defined trail led Bosquit to Smith's place,
a mile north of the hotel, on tho Tennes
see Creek road, where the remains of
food under a fig tree indicated that the
men had stopped there while the lunch
obtained at the hotel by Case was eaten.
It is generally believed that one of Case's
companions, if he has more than one,
Is Seavis, the negro, and that Seavis did
not accompany Case to the hotel because
his color and the very noticeable scars on
his face would betray him.
SHERIFF IS INDIGNANT.
Sheriff Bosquit is indignant at the in
difference shown by some of the citizens
of the county, who either fail to report
important developments or wait until 'it is
almost -too late to do anything. The Shin
gle Springs Incident is but one of many.
Another thing which greatly handicaps
and aggravates Sheriff Bosquit is the
lack of financial support extended him by
the State officials in hunting down the
murderous escapes from Kolsom peniten
tiary. The State has not permitted
Sheriff Bosquit to spend one cent on its
account- The same may be said of the
Supervisors of El Dorado County, who
have thus far turned deaf ears to the.
appeals of the Sheriff for financial assis
tance.

SACRAMENTO,. Aug. 6.â It was 11 o'clock to-night when Deputy Sheriff s Reese
and Hinter returned here by .team with Convtet James P. Roberts securely ironed.
An immense crowd. Including many women. Waited at the Sacramento end of the
Yolo bridge for the arrival of the prisoner. While an equally large, number gath
ered at the jail. Roberts announced that he would not talk to the, newspaper men
here, and asked a deputy if he were compelled to do so. Being told that he was
at liberty to use his own judgment in the matter, he declined to make a statement
to the press representatives here, although he talked freely with The Call-repre
sentative at Davisville. . . .
District Attorney Seymour followed Roberts to his cell and examined him at
some length.
Deputy Sheriff Reese when told of a rumor that the officers had followed an
ex-convict named Newman to an opium den and through him got track of Roberts
and Howard said that he knew nothing of the opium feature, but it was true that
an ex-convict named Newman had given information to the" officers that aided in
the capture. . [ Â¦
The Sheriff's officers, as well as the police detectives, are of the belief that
Howard is In hiding in the Yolo County jungles, and at a late hour to-night a
posse was still hunting for him there.
When Roberts was taken this afternoon his first thought was to impress upon
his captors the idea that he was not guilty of murder. It was an exhibition of the
thief's instinct to provide an alibi. "You can't hold me for murder," he said in ex
ultation. "Howard and I cleared away from the bunch before the fight at the
Grand Victory mine, where the militiamen were killed. It's all up now I know,
but I made a -pretty good getaway, did I not? I have been tramping day and night
all the time." â¢ ' .'...Â¦
District .Attorney, Seymour said to : nlgW- that he would certainly place a charge
of murder against Robert?; and also against Howard if caught. All the conspira
tors are equally guilty of the death of Guard William Cotter at Folsom prison, if
not of the subsequent murders. Roberts will be kept in the tanks at the County
Jail here until returned at an early date to Folsom prison. It is believed his re
turn will have a good moral effect on the convicts and it will be made as conspic
uous as possible. Not a few of the officers here express the belief that the body
of Convict Allison should not have been burled at Pilot Hill, where he fell, but
should have been returned to the prison for the sake of the effect of the spectacle
upon the unruly .prisoners.
Sheriff Lowell and Haggerty returned at midnight from the search for Howard in
Yolo County. They said that while they had information that Howard spent most
of the day in the brush near the river bridge he had escaped into the brush and
it was impossible in the dark to locate him. : ...
A farmer came into the Sheriff's office to-night and reported he saw th^
afternoon Roberts and a man whom he described as Howard crossing his place
in Yolo County soon after Roberts fell into the hands of the posse. The
farmer declared Howard took off in the direction of Marysville. Acting upon this
information Deputy Sheriffs Howell and Haggerty armed themselves and started

guard. Roberts said the convicts traveled in a body until after the firBt fight at
Pilot Hill. His account of that fight does not differ materially from published
newspaper reports. He confirms the report that Allison ended his own life with
a pistol shot after he had been shot through the body by the trailers. Soon after
that fight Roberts and Howard separated from the main body of convicts.
RETURNS TO FOLSOM TO GET A SUPPI/5T OF FOOD.
Wednesday they went to a cabin, where they found a bottle of whisky and
some flour. Roberts made seme biscuits and that .was all ,the food they had ex
cept fruit until they reached Folsom. They went back down the North Fork of
the American River, crossing the bridge at Mormon Island. They passed near tfie
main gate of the Folsom prison Saturday night and went into the town of Fol
som. They remained there long enough to get some food and. left as soon as tfie
moon went down, going in the direction of Roaevllle.
Two miles out of Folsom they stopped and were in hiding all day Sunday.
That night they went on to Sacramento. They' remained in that city all day
Monday and in the evening crossed over on the Yolo side, spending the night in
the bushes. *
Roberts told the officers that he left Howard Tuesday evening, but to The Call
representative he stated that they quarreled and separated Monday morning.
Howard wanted to go on th? main streets of Sacramento and Roberts refused.
Roberts says he obtained a good supply of food in Sacramento and Tuesday night
left his camp, traveling along the railroad.
EXPRESSES SORROW OVER DEATH OF GUARD COTTER.
Roberts said he left the road and went into the bushes at Davisville, where
he was captured. He stated that it was his intention to board a San Francisco
train to-night and ship on the first vessel to leave the harbor. He is confident
that if he could have evaded the officers one day longer he would have made his
escape. He professed to be sorry that Cotter and the two soldiers were killed
and insisted that he did not know who killed them. When asked if he was not
glad that his flight was over and that he was again In "custody he gave an em
phatic negative reply. He said he was sent to prison on the testimony of a de
serter; that he was Innocent of the crime of which he was convicted, and that he
had brooded over his wrongs until ha became desperate. A chance came for him
to escape, he took It and lost. If he must hang for 'Hi all right, a man has enly
one time to die. The officers think Roberts is lying about Howard and endeavor
ing to aid him in making his escape. All the officers are on the alert to-night
and if he is in this county he is almost certain of capture.

Sheriff Bosquit dispatched his eon
Dallas, who is his chief deputy, to Shin
jrie Springs early this morning to investi
gate the report-
The young man returned to Placerville
this afternoon. He 6tated that on his ar
rival at the Planters Hotel he obtained
the names of several people who had
peon the stranger on Monday night, and
taking each person aside, he showed the
photographs of allÂ» the escaped convict*.
Witbout hesitation the hotel people all
identified the picture of Case as the man
who had eaten the meal at the hotel and
y.-ho had purchased supper for an alleged
tick companion.
Miss Maria Craig, who cooked and
served the meal to the stranger, was
jxraltlve in her identification, as was also
George Graham and one or two others.
Including a young lad, who, attracted by
the rough appearance of the stranger and
rxcited by the stories of the escaped con
victs, plucked up courage enough to fol
low the man some distance from the hotel
until, awed by the furtive glances of the
ftrangcr, he stopped and returned to the
hotel. The youngster heard the man,
since identified as Case, whistle and dis
tinctly heard a whistled reply come from
the vicinity of the cemetery, in which
direction the stranger headed.
Satisfying himself that he was on the
right track young Bosquit proceeded to
the cemetery and there discovered tracks
made by heavily nailed shoes. The large
number of print* indicated that one or
more persens had stopped at that point
IDENTIFY PHOTOGRAPH
I^tte last night Sheriff Bosquit received
a telephonic message from Mr. Scott of
the firm of Scott & Gilbert of San Fran
eisco, who stated that a rough appearing
man, attired in ill-fitting clothes and
minus a coat, appeared at the Planters'
Hotel at Shingle Springs, about twelve
mJles southwest of Placerville, at 7
o'clock last Monday evening and asked
to be served a substantial meal. Before
leaving the dining-room he asked to have
some food wrapped up for him, saying
that he had a friend waiting in the hills
who was too 111 to walk to the hotel. The
Ftranger stated that his companion and
himself were on the way to the moun
tains to secure work.
The visitors appetite being appeased he
walked to the counter and threw down
a $5 piece and received the change and
the package of food. During his stay at
the hotel, which lasted about half an
hour, he appeared somewhat nervous and
watched the movements of every person
who entered the room. On leaving the
<1ining-room he backed out of the door as
if afraid some one might attempt to shoot
him should he leave the room In the usual
inanner. face forward. Before leaving the
premises he drew a bucketful of water
from the well and carried It with him. No
effort was made by the hotel people, to
.question the stranger and nothing was
.done to ascertain the direction in which
he traveled after quitting the place.
Sheriff Bosquit was not informed of the
occurrence until last night, when Mr.
Scott called up his offlce after arriving in
Plaeerville to learn the outcome of the
stranger's visit to the hotel at Shingle
Springs
OUTLAW VISITS A HOTEL.
Of the many reports which have drifted
'Into Placerville to-day concerning the
whereabouts of the convicts, the most
promising is the discovery of the fact that
on Monday evening last Case and one or
mere of the fugitives were in the vicinity
of Shingle Springs. It is known that one
of them, since identified as Case, ate a
hearty supper at the Planters* Hotel and
secured a Quantity of food, which he car
ried away in a paper bag. Sheriff Bos
quit's son. Dallas, was sent to investi
gate the matter and on his report Sheriff
Bo?qu!t based the following statement to
night:
"It is a settled fact in my mind that
Case and one or two others were in the
vicinity of Shingle Springs on Monday
night. I am satisfied that it is the best
trail we have to work on outside of the
pursuit which is being prosecuted in the
Cat Creek country by Sheriff Norman and
his posses. They are following up the five
men who murdered our two militiamen,
Rutherford and Jones."
CONVICT CASE IS SEEN.
The manhunt is to be kept up and the
increase In the reward offered for the cap
ture nr killing of the convicts has stimu
lated the members of the posses now In
the field.
No word has been received here to-day
from Sheriff Norman's posse or the pro
fessional trailers who are searching for
the five outlaws who ambushed the mili
tia at Manzanita Hill last Saturday with
fuch fatal results. The convicts who are
being trailed and their pursuers are now
in the southeastern portion of El Dorado
County, which is cut off from communi
cation by telegraph or telephone. If the
losses succeed in killing any one of this
rand the news must be sent back by
courier to either Volcano or Olita, where
It can be scr.t to Plymouth, which has
t r >phonic connection with Placerville.
Sheriff Bosquit will take charge of an
other posse when a definite trail is
picked up cf the convicts in the Webber
Creek region. The members of the militia
company are anxious to avenge the mur
der of their comrades who fell at Man
zanita Hill and If the convicts are defi
nitely located the militia will be in the
hunt and also in at the death.
The two convicts who were known to
be above the town of Mosquito and head-
Ing for the northern portion of this coun
ty are being followed by Sheriff Mansfield
of San Mateo and ex-Sheriff Conroy of
Placer County. These convict? were
trailed this morning to the viefnity of
Bald Mountain, but their trail was about
three days old.
The region of Pilot Hill and other ad
jacent points where the convicts have
been seen in the past five days was gone
over to-day by the posse with the blood
liounds, but the dogs failed to take the
trail, as the scent was too old. Upon the
receipt of information of the negro Seavis
or Case being seen the bloodhounds will
be hurried to the spot.
SEARCHING FOE LOST TRAIL.
Placerville is still the center of the scene
cf operations, for It Is positive that two or
three of the convicts are still In the Web
ber Creek district and in the region abut
ting Pilot Hill and Shingle Springs. The
fact that Convict Case was seen at Shin
gle Springs on Monday night and that he
Â«as accompanied by another convict, if
Tiot by two of the outlaws, shows that a
portion of the band has not beÂ«?n able to
get far away from tha place where the
j*Â«ss?s gave battle at Pilot Hill.
The people of Placerville are incensed
that the information that Case, and other
convicts were at Shingle Springs last
Monday night was not at once telephoned
In to Sheriff Bosquit. There was no doubt
of the identity of Case, and if word had
been sent to Sheriff Bosquit the blood
hounds that arrived here yesterday could
have been put on a fresh trail.

the information that Robert?, one of the
outlaws, had been caught near Davisville

in a roundabout manner about twenty

mountain sides, down deep ravines,
through, canyons and along the banks of
the placid Webber Creek, but all to no
effect. The scent could not be found, so
at 6 o'clock, after fifteen hours' hard and
serious labor, the dogs were called off.
The dogs will be taken to Shingle Springs

take the scent The party left Lotus
at 3 a. m. and arrived at Ingram, thirteen
miles distant, just after daybreak. ' The
air was crisp and chill' and as soon as the
hounds were on the scene they com
menced to bark and bay *nd evinced
great "excitement in anticipation of the
hunt that was in store for them. The
place is a lonely spot in the woods, three
miles southwest from Pilot Hill, the
scene of the battle between the convicts
and their pursuers. The exact, spot is
known as the Julia mine, a corporation
owned and managed by colored people,
who have quite an extensive plant. On
Monday night before retiring the miners
placed three large kettles filled with
beans, corn b beef and vegetables on the
stove, which, on account of the summer
weather, is now out In the open near the
corner of their cabin. They stated that
there were, -enough provisions being
cooked to last them three days. The con
victs swooped down upon the- whole lot
some time early Tuesday . morning and
carried their booty about 200 feet up the
hill. _ Here they apparently devoured
everything, leaving merely a few rem
nants" and the three large pans to mark
the spot of their repast. From the foot
marks it would appear there were three
or four in the party.
C. P. Ferrell,, the owner of the hounds
Bessie and Jumbo, took his place in the
middle of the spot where the convicts had
feasted themselves, and then, taking out
a portion of the trousers that the negro.
Seavis, had discarded after his escape
from, prison, he placed it before tbÂ§
hounds to smell. They sniffed them again
and again, and then,, with noses on the
ground, they commenced dashing hither
and thither through the long, dry grasses
and srubby chaparral that abound in
the vicinity. Again the dogs came back
to take a whiff from the trousers and
once more they were scouring every nook
and corner for a trace of the scent.. For
thirty minutes they worked with tre
mendous vigor and energy, covering an
enormous area of territory, but without
success. They could not get the scent,
and- so the hunt in that section was
ended.

Pius X Graciously Welcomes Delegation of United
States Citizens Chaperoned by Cardinal Gibbons;
of high dignitaries who had not yet been
admitted, including even the diplomatic
body. Nevertheless he used his influence,
with the happiest result, and obtained the
consent of the Pope to receive the Ameri
cans. Their luggage was hastily brought
back from the station in order that they
mlght apear in proper apparel, and at 5:33
o'clock this afternoon all were at thf
bronze doors of the Vatican. They were
met by Monsignor Kennedy, rector of the
American College, whose presence was
quite sufficient to make the Swiss Guard
step back, present arms and give entrance
to all. They trooped up the high stair
way, one hundred strong, and on through
the corridors, bending their heads to pas3
through the openings in the walls which
had been erected for the conclave. Bricks
were still lying about on the flagstones.
Through the beautiful loggia dT Raphael
they passed to the unique hall of Inscrip
tions, where a halt was called. Â¦>
POPE PASSES AMONG THEM.
After a considerable wait there was a
murmured "Hush,#hush." and two Swis3
Guards . entered from a corridor. Before
the pilgrims could quite realize it the
Pope stood among them.
Pius X is a little taller than Cardinal
Gibbons, giving, however, the impression
of being a much bigger man. as he is
inclined to stoutness. He has abundant
gray hair, with no signs of baldness;
dark, clear eyes; handsome features and
a magnificent voice, low In tone, to which
is added a peculiar grace due to his mu
sical Venetian accent. From his whole
person emanated great benignity and cor
diality. He walked slowly but with the
firmness of a young man down the long
kneeling line, accompanied by Cardinal
Gibbons and Mgr. Kennedy, and gave to
each of the pilgrims as he passed his
hand to be kissed. He spoke a few word3
to almost every one.
Plus X was arrayed completely In
white, without a gleam of color except
that which sparkled from the huge emer
ald on his finger. Cardinal Gibbons was
on hia rljtht in red robes and Mgr. Ken
nedy on his left in purple. They were
ROME. Aug. 5.â The spirit, of "The
King is dead! Long live the King!"
which has been repeated through
all the long ages upon a change of
sovereigns, was the dominant note to-day
at the Vatican among those gathered
there, not to acknowledge an earthly sov
ereign, but to accept without reserve
Pope Pius X as their spiritual king. Not
only had America enjoyed the honor of
first announcing through the press the ac
cession. of the present Pontiff to the chair
of St. Peter, but to-day Americans en
joyed the far greater privilege and honor
of being the first to convey to his Holi
ness the homage of the nations.
The American pilgrimage, conducted by
John J. McGrane of New York and
Father-Lynch of Niagara University of
Buffalo, N. T., which j left the United
States for its pious journey to Rome to
receive the blessing of Leo XIII. arrived
while the conclave was sitting. Its mem
bers lingered until the never-to-be-forgot
ten moment yesterday when the election
of the new Pope was announced, and
then decided reluctantly to leave to-day.
But U was with tears of disappointment
at not having been able" to see the Holy
Father that the pilgrims packed and
strapped their luggage and sent it to the
station.
FROM GLOOM TO REJOICING.
While the. desolate band was eating a
hurried luncheon preparatory to leaving.
McGrane. with radiant face, burst in,
waving a paper and almost dancing in
excitement.
"You shall see him!, You shall see him!"
he cried. "Our Cardinal has arranged it."
Cardinal Gibbons had been asked yes
terday to try to arrange for the reception
of the Americans, and had promised to do
his best, at the same time explaining how
unprecedented It would b* for the Pope
the day after his election to receive a for
eign pilgrimage when there, were scores

head and replaced it with theone which
had been presented by father Lynch.
McGrane handed to Pius X the offer

together after luncheon to-day. The Pope
spoke especially to the members of the
I^ante family of Philadelphia to Rev
John E. Burke, pastor .of the Church of
St. Benedict the Moor of New York: I*
Father Wall, who expressly represented
Archbishop Farley, and to Rev. James
Roger Matthews of Washington.
To Father Uurke he gave a special bene

Occasionally, as the Pope passed along.
he laid his hand upon the head of one
of the pilgrims. When Pius X reached
the persons who waved two flags yes

"Will you extend your ex-client the
courtesy of listening to him?" asked Su
tro.
'"He Is no client of mine and I don't
desire to hear anything he says," replied
Ach.
Ach took exception to the remark and
criticized Sutro. Attorney Freldearich
tried to have the remark stricken from
the record, but Ach objected and the ref
eree refused to grant the motion.
Ach became wroth at this time and, ris
ing, said: "1 publicly withdraw as the
witness' individual counsel. My associa
tion with his partners as their counsel
will not permit me to consistently act as
his counsel in this matter. I would there
fore suggest an adjournment until he can
secure personal counsel."
Referee Green turned to Ettlinger and
asked him If he understood what Ach
was saying. The old mqji was fHirried'by
the remarks and tried to collect â¢ his
thought?. He was uncertain as to hUÂ» po
sition and tried to hold a . consultation
with the attorneys for the creditors. He
wanted Ach to listen to his txplanation,
but Ach declined unless the shorthand re
porters made it a part of the record. Ach
said he had no objection to h!s ; ex-client
holding a consultation with I he creditor
attorney, but he would not Join that con
ference.
Attorney Ach again tried to Inform the
witness that he need not answer the ques
tions, as, his answers might incriminate
him. but hl3 advice was -overlooked. At
torney Sutro could not refrain from iutex
jcctlng the remark that the witness "evi

"Did you ever miss it from the office
up to the time of the failure?" asked
Freidenrich In an effort to locate the
missing volume.
"I never had any use for It, therefore I
never missed it."
Ach pointedly told the witness he need
not answer the question- unless he so de
sired.
"At both places," replied Ettlinger.
"What business was carried on at
Crockett*?"
"Shipping of grain."
"Where were the books kept?"
Ach gave the witness the same instruc
tions, but his advice was overlooked as
before. The witness replied, "At both
places."
"What books were kept there?"
Against the advice of Ach tlfc witness
replied, "I am not familiar with that end
of the business?"
"You know that a warehouse book was
kept In the office of Eppinger & Co'.'"
Attorney Ach advised Ettlinger not to
answer, but he replied that he did.
"Do you know what became of that
warehouse book with its stubs and
pages?"
"I don't know. I paid no attention to
it." '
"I have no means to presume to the
contrary," replied Ach. The* examination
then continued.

Freidenrich and his associates declined
to permit the question and objected to

to understand his position. Freidenrich
sarcastically retorted that if Ach desired
to Interview his client he had no objec

REFUSES ACH'S ADVICE.
Arh Informed Kttlinger he need not an
pwer thp question if he so desired, as it
might incriminate him, and further be
caure his partners had been indicted for
transactions connected with the ware
house business.
. Ettlinger again ignored Ach and re
plied in the affirmative. The witness fur
ther volunteered the Information that the
firm's warehouses were situated at Crock
ett, Goshen, Dir.uba and near Fresno.
Ach was nettled at the stand taken by
Ettlinger and be conferred with the coun
sel for the creditors and tried -to have
them suspend their examination of the
â¢witness In order to give him an oppor
tunity of learning whether he was act
ing as his attorney.
"Uim vfiii Â«jthÂ«.r counsel besides mi*-
"About $10u0. She doubled this, as the
rates of interest were very high at that
time. My wife died on March 30, 1900,
leaving all her property to me by will. In
the event of my death the same, however,
Is to revert to my daughter."
"Did the money with which Mrs. Hat
tie Strauss bought this land come from
you or your wife?"
"The biggest part came from her
mother. Her husband may have given
her money."
The witness' attention was directed to
entries In the ledger which showed that
ho had* drawn sums aggregating $10,000
for improving lands in the Ryer Reclama
tion District. He said that whenever tho
land was Hooded he advanced sums of
money to save it. He said the money had
not been repaid him and that he held no
promissory notes against the same. Et
tlinger said the land was now held by
Ettlinger & Co., a corporation, and that
he was interested in the same.
"Then these moneys have not been paid
to you and are still owing to you?"
"Yes. sir."
"Was the firm engaged in the warehouse
business?" ER&fi
LAND WAS LEASED.
"No. sir; some of the land was leased
to third parties. The leases were made
by the firm."
The attorney for the creditors then tried
to learn something about Ettlinger's
financial condition, whether he was not
a heavy landowner himself, but the aged
speculator replied that his daughter, Mrs.
Hattie Strauss, held property interests.
He said she was able to invest by reason
of money she had received from his de
ceased v/ife and himself.
"How much money did your wife have
when you married her in ISO?" the wit
ness was asked.
"Jacob Eppinger," said the witness,
"had charge of the whole business. All
orders came through him. I looked after
the land interests of the firm. I was busy
looking after the Ryer Island Reclamation
District, in which we were deeply inter
ested. I ordered supplies for the ranches.
Much of my time was spent in the coun
try looking after the ranches."
'â¢Was this land transferred to the Lon
don, Paris and American Bank," asked
Freidenrich.
"Yes, sir; Jacob Eppinger," replied the
witness, before Ach could advise him that
he need not answer the question, as it
might incriminate him. Much to Ach's
surprise, Ettlinger Ignored him and
seemed to be anxious to clear himself of
all blame in the matter.
Bernhard Ettlinger was then sworn and
he testified that he was 63 years of age
""ia resident of this city; that the firm
*Â»' Eppinger & Co. began business in
Dixon in 1SCS and that it opened an. office
in this city in 1SS0.
"Was It the duty of anyone member
of the firm to look after the finances?"
asked Mr. Freidenrich.
When the proceedings were opened be
fore the referee in bankruptcy yesterday
mcrnlng- Attorney Ach and Attorney
Freidenrich had a short argument as to
the refusal of the bankrupts to furnisli
the creditors with a schedule. Freidenrich
desired that Ach's clients , comply with
the often repeated request to file a sched
ule of liabilities. He said that the Ep
pingera were in contempt of court. Ach
thought otherwise and the referee di
rected counsel to prepare a bill of ex
ceptions for presentation to the Federal
court.
WANTS SCHEDULE FILED.
Joseph L. Eppinger, son of Jaeob Ep
pinger, the Indicted grain broker, was
then put on the witness stand and gave
testimony of a highly sensational charac
ter. The witness stated that he occupied
the position of cashier in the disrupted
firm and he admitted taking sums aggre
gating $1000 a month from the cash
drawer, which he spent In living and in
speculation. He was interrogated partic
ularly about a check for $S66 25, which he
recived from Mr. Ettcr on June 5, the
day before the doors of the firm were
closed, and he testified that he had
cashed the check, charged the amount to
himself and had given his father $G00 of
the amount and had kept $2-30 or more for
himself. Eppinger's admissions startled
the attorneys for the creditors.
When asked if he was a man of fam
ily Eppinger replied he was. He did
not know what salary he received. He
said he crossed out an entry made by
Bookkeeper Mitchell, charging him with
$2C0 a month salary, because he thought
he deserved more.

Ach yesterday morning, while giving tes
timony before Milton J. Green, referee In
bankruptcy, and the lawyer immediately
gave notice of his withdrawal as counsel
for the witness. At the suggestion of Ach
and at the request of his ex-client the
further hearing of Ettlinger's testimony
was continued until next Wednesday
morning, In order that Ettlinger may be
represented by counsel.

UKIAH, Aug. 5.â An Inquest was held
to-day in the case of Miss Lizzie Snow,
who committed suicide Tuesday evening
by shooting herself in the head, and a
verdict was rendered in accordance with
the facts. A third bullet hole was dis
covered in her head to-day and as the
pistol found by the body only contained
one empty shell, the case began to look
mysterious. A close examination was
then made of the room in which tha un
fortunate young woman died and another
pistol containing three empty shells waa
brought to light.
The evidence taken at the inquest was
to the effect that Miss Snow had been
mentally affected for several weeks. ' It
is believed by her friends that she was
demented when she took her own life, as
po other cause for the suicide is known.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Mrs. Keith, who is about 50 years of
age, has conducted a successful millin
ery business in San Francisco for many
years and has acquired considerable
property. Last week she tiled a suit for
divorce against her husband, Joseph H.
Keith, who resides at 2624 California
street, in San Francisco. In her com
plaint she alleged that her husband had
represented that she was insane and on
two occasions had caused her detention on
an insanity charge. Mrs. Keith alleged
that her business was worth 115,000, and
asked for a settlement of the community
property. /
SAN JOSE, Aug. 6.â Mrs. . Alma E.
Keith, a fashionable milliner of San
Francisco, with a large establishment on
Market street, has become insane and
was taken in charge by the police this
morning. She has been spending the sum
mer in San Jose and had apartments at
the Grand, on the corner of Second and
San Fernando streets. At an early hour
this morning Mrs. Keith was discovered
running from room to room in scanty at
tire and loudly calling for imaginary per
sons.* For her own safety it was deemed
best to turn her over to the police. Mrs.
Keith, was taken to the Red Cross Sani
tarium, which is conducted by Police
Matron Frost.
In Mrs. Keith's possession was found a
small hand satchel containing diamonds
and jewelry valued at more than $2000.
These have been taken charge of by
Chief of Police Carroll.
Mrs. Keith's condition is said to have
resulted from fright from the earthquake.
The Grand lodging-house is in the Louise
building, where considerable damage was
done by the earthquake. Part of the
tower of the building and several chim
neys were wrecked and created much
noise and excitement. Mrs.' Lusson, wife
of Dr. P. .M. L.usson, who' died of heart
disease from the earthquake shock, lived
at the Grand. Since that time Mrs.
Keith has been suffering from hysteria
and her condition has gradually become
Â¦worse.

Governor Rowland was born in Philadel
phia, Pa., seventy-three years ago. .He
came to this home from Santa Monica,
Cal.. six years ago to take the place of A. 1
J. Smith, who was transferred. His ad
ministration was harmonious and marked
by his order which wiped from the map
the notorious "Klondike Saloon City,"
which bordered the home grounds and
had been the scene of the murder of
many old veterans.
Governor Rowland volunteered his ser
vices to the Government- at Qulncy, III.,
August 1, 1S61. He was made a first lieu-,
tenant and was commissioned adjutant.
Later he was appointed a major in the
Tenth Illinois Infantry. lie resigned his
commission in 1862. After the war he was
elected Mayor of Qulncy, 111.
LEAVENWORTH. Kans., Aug. 5.â J.O.
Rowland, governor of the Soldiers' Home
at this place, died this v evening at 9:20
o'clock of Brlght's disease. He had been

Sheriff Ed Cal!ahan followed Judge
Hargls on the witness stand. Several
times he became confused and contra
dicted his testimony. He corroborated
Judge Hargis as to what Hargis told
Ewen when he rent for him and asked
as to who did the killing and if he saw
any one do it. Ewen,' he stated, said to
them thÂ«t he did not know who did it.
and that he (Ewen) was afraid of his
life. Hargis urged him to assist the au
thorities in rapturing the murderer and
said that if necessary he would wire Gov
ernor Beckham to send fifty soldiers to
Jackson, and they would protect him.
On cross-examination Callahan contra
dicted himself several times. Several of
his statements did not correspond- with
his testimony before the Grand Jury
which indicted Jett and White.
Judge Hargis was cross-examined by
Byrd. In reply to a question as to why
he stood by Jett, his nephew, when they
did not speak to each other. Hargis said
Jett was not treated right when he was
brought lo court by fifty soldiers with a
Gatling gun. On being pressed for an
other reason, Harsis said that Jetfs
mother who was his elder sister, had
cared for him during* the war when his
father had been carried away by Federal
soldiers, and that as an honest man he
now wanted to repay that debt with v in
terest.
Judge James Hargls was called to the
stand. He said he saw Ewen running
and Marcum fall, and saw Curtis Jett
on a street corner near a tree after the
shooting. He said Sheriff Ca!Iahan'was
in his store and he prevented Callahan
going out. Afterward the witness sent
for. Ewen to talk about the murder.
CYNTHIANA. Ky.. Aug. 5.â In the Jett
and White ,$rial to-day the defense placed
Mrs. Lulu South, a sister of. Judge Har
ris, on the stand. She contradicted Miss
Emma Clark, who testified for the com
monwealth, and corroborated other wit
nesses for the defense.
Statements have been made in certain
newspapers declaring that the State of
ficials should be investigated and It is pre
sumed the Grand Jury called these to give
them an opportunity to testify regarding
bcodling and to deny any allegations that
may have been made against them. Wil
liam H. Phelps of Carthage is expected to
come before the Grand Jury to-morrow,
when, it is thought, he will be questioned
regarding the distribution of passes to
members of the State Legislature. â¢
Former Lieutenant Governor John A.
I/ee was before the Grand Jury for two
hours this afternoon. He arrlve'd from
St. Louis at noon and went directly to the
Grand Jury room. The nature of his tes
timony is not known.

third trial on the charge of perjury, con
victed and his punishment fixed at three
years' Imprisonment in the penitentiary.
At the first trial Faulkner was convicted,
but the Supreme Court reversed and re
manded the case. The jury that tried the
case the second time disagreed.
The Jury was out -forty-nine minutes.
Faulkner's counsel, immediately . filed a
motion for a new trial and bond in the
sum of $15,C00 was given.

Call Art Supplement, August 9, 1903 I
i , - â â _____ , p â :
"The Wedding Party," by Kowalski, illustrates the Polish form of a |j
custom which exists in almost every civilized and many semi-civilized Â©
In the agricultural districts of Poland, where horses are most neces- 9
sary to .cover long distances over the broad steppes, it is most natural Â¦
that the wedding procession should take the form of a "promenade en - S
voituile." It is such a scene, full of life and gayety, that is depicted in Â©
the picture reproduced in the art supplement. Laughing faces, bright o
color and lively movement combine to give the scene a character of joy- "
ousness and a "go" seldom found in pictorial representations. gj
"The Wedding Party," which is at present exhibited at the Chicago Â®
Art Institute, is the property of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Bosenbaum of Chi- â¢
cago, and is held in high favor. g

The firm of Jfurjbut, Hatch & Co. (John
Henry Hurlbut. E. Sanford Hatch., the
board member and J. Frailey Smith) was
organized In September, 1890. Their finan
cial embarrassment has been a matter of
general comment in the "street" for some
weeks. No statement regarding their af
fairs was obtainable to-day.
For a time it looked as it the two ware
houses belonging to the Mission Bay
Warehouse Company were doomed. They
contained 25,000 sacks of grain and other
perishable merchandise. The warehouse
south of the lumber yard was In flames
several times, but the combined efforts of
the employes and the firemen kept it from
destruction. The warehouse east of the
lumber yard was in peril, fior over two
hours and It was deemed a measure of
necessity to begin the removal of the
grain. Some of it was lotfed Into a
schooner In the creek and another portion
was carried out on the flat out of reach
of the flames by direction of the under
writers. After a fierce battle on the east
ern side lasting over two hours, the flre
was confined to the blazing piles of lum
ber.
When Chief Sullivan of the Fire De
partment arrived on the scene the con
flagration had assumed such proportions
that he sent- In a third alarm and appar
atus came from all parts of the city." Hy
drants were scarce south of Fourth
street bridge and only two engines were
able to couple close to the fire. The others
strung hose from across the bridge and
the long lines proved too heavy to be
wieldy.
FANNED by a stiff western wind
flames that began at 9:55 o'clock
yesterday morning destroyed about
$100,000 worth of lumber and ma
chinery In the planing mill and
lumber yards of the Excelsior Lumber
Company, situated In the block bounded
by Kentucky, Fourth and Channel streets
and running to the water front on Mis
sion flat.
The flre broke out In the molding-room,
according to the accounts of the em
ployes, and spread with inconceivable
rapidity to the store shed In the rear and
to the office building fronting on Ken
tucky street. From there It attacked the
planing mill and almost before any of the
flre apparatus had arrived on the scene
there was a solid brock of flames, extend
ing from Mission Creek to Channel street,
between Fourth street and the bay.
The fire crept through the piled lumber
in the store shed and suddenly the whole
mass sprang into blaze, communicating
with the lumber piles outside. The flames
ate their way through a section of stack
ed timbers, destroying everything in their
path for a width of 300 feet. Dense vol
umes of smoke poured from the burning
mass, seriously impeding the efforts of
the firemen and effectually concealing the
ravages that were being made by the
flames in the yards.
"WAREHOUSES THREATENED.
IMPERIAL, Aug. 5.â W. F. Holt of
Redlands has arrived here with ! a con
firmation of the report that a railroad will
be built this fall connecting the Imperial
branch of the Southern Pacific road with
Holton, eleven miles east of here. He
also says his company will begin work at
once to develop power for the east side
canal, which has a capacity of 1700 horse
power. Imperial and other towns of the
valley will thus be supplied with elec
tricity. The company is composed of
capitalists of Redlands and Los Angeles.
Imperlal-Holton Branch Railroad.
One of the employes in the molding
room, where the fire started, had his
hand burned slightly by the Ignition of a
can of paint he was holding, and Captain
Sullivan of engine 12 was overcome by
smoke, but quickly resuscitated. The fire
is said to have had its origin in the igni
tion of Inflammable paint used In coloring
hoops. . v.;v
When the flames spread to the engine
room of the planing mill the engineers
were driven out before they could drain
the boilers and for a time it was feared
that explosions might add fatalities to the
disaster. One of the boilers did explode,
but It caused ne serious damage. Captain
Spillane of the Southern station person
ally took charge of the police detail at
the flre and kept curious sightseers out of
harm's way until all danger was passed.
C A. Hooper, president of the Excel
sior Lumber Company, said yesterday
afternoon that as far as could be ascer
tained the loss to the company would be
about $100,000 and that $67,000 of this was
covered by j insurance. Among the ma
terial lost was a large quantity of lumber
finished on a contract with Williams &
Co. of New York to be used for the new
cable stations at Guam and in the Philip
pines. The mill and yards employed about
175 men and many of these will be thrown
out of work.
The center of the wharf on which the
burning lumber was piled caught flre un
derneath and for hours presented a solid
wall of flame over the water of the bay.
After the fire on the Burface had been
controlled holes were cut In the wharf
and streams deflected below, with the re
sult that all those portions of the struc
ture that had not already caved in were
saved frcm further ravages. At 1 o'clock
Chief Sullivan announced that the flre was
under control.
The arrival of the flre tugs Governor
Markham and Governor Irwin did much
to relieve the pressure and limit the dam
age by supplying the much felt want of
water supply. Four lines of hose * were
laid from the Markham and three from
the Irwin and with thesg reinforcements
the firemen fought their way through the
blazing: avenues and finally outlined limits
within which they were able to hold the
flames.
For hours a vast volume of water was
poured from, more than thirty lines of
hose at the seething- furnace and still the
flames continued to burn. The peculiar
manner of piling lumber renders it ex
tremely open to the attack of flames
and protects the fire from the action of
water. Added to this a hard wind was
blowing from the west and It took the
utmost efforts of the Fire Department to
hold the conflagration inside its original
limits.
WHARF IS IN FI^AMES.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 5.â George H.
Fisher, the youngynaan arrested Saturday
night on the; charge of passing forged
checks, was arraigned in court to-day
and his examination set for Friday. Bail
was fixed at 51000. He was first charged
Â¦with burglary for having- entered the
house of Mrs. Bailie and taken a lot of
jewelry. Then followed three complaints
fpr passing fictitious checks. The police
claim Fisher passed forty bogus checks
In Los Anjjeles in one month.
Alleged Forger Arraigned.
Several vessels of this fleet were sighted
during the day at various points along
the coast.
It is expected that the attacking fleet
will head for one of the many harbors to
the eastward of this port, as those to the
westward are comparatively few.
With Admiral Barker to act on the de
fensive are Admiral Coughlin on his flag
ship, the Olympia. and Admiral Wise on
his flagship, the Yankee. The vessels of
the fleet are the battleship Alabama and
Illinois, the cruisers Baltimore, Prairie
and Panther, the dispatch boat Vixen,
the torpedo boat destroyers Decatur,
Balnbridge, Barry, Dale and Chauncey,
two Government tugs and the schoolshlp
Hartford. As the hostile fleet, which
sailed Monday under Rear Admiral Sands,
is permitted to make an attack or attempt
an anchorage at any time after this noon,
It was expected that every vessel on the
defense would reach Its position before
nightfall. They must protect the coast
from Cape Ann to Eastport.
Admiral Sands' squadron includes the
battleships Indiana, Massachusetts and
Texas, and three torpedo boat destroyers.
PORTLAND. Me.. Aug. 5.â At midnight
last night that portion of the New Eng
land coast from the boundary to Cape
Ann had been theoretically threatened by
a hostile fleet for a period of twelve hours,
but so far as known the "enemy" had not
taken advantage of the northeast storm
and thick weather to slip past the defend
ing fleet and establish himself in any
harbor. The attacking fleet has been at
sea for about three days and will have
till Saturday to win the game planned by
the naval experts in "Washington by oc
cupying any of the harbors on this por
tion of the coast for a period of five hours
without being destroyed. The defending
fleet under the command of Rear Admiral
Barker sailed from Bar Harbor at 6
o'clock yesterday' morning and by night
the various ships of the squadron Â¦were
well distributed along the coast and the
work of patrol had begun. Many of the
ships are equipped with a wireless system
of telegraph, so that a majority of them
can be concentrated at any point within
a short time.

We have endeavored to free the subject of
all utopianlsm and make an absolutely prac
tical proposition. We expect that the begin
nings now made will be extended until there
appears a similar basis of agreement through
out the countries of Europe and America. Hav
ing brought about an exchange of views be
tween the members of the French and Brit
ish Parliaments. I next wish to eee a similar
exchange between Â¦ American and French par
liamentarians. I expect to go to St. Louis
next year to : deliver. an address on diplomacy
at the International .Congress in connection
with the exposition and hope to make the
definite plan for bringing to Europe a dele
gation of representative American officials and
parliamentarians, who are certain to be ac
corded-a splendid reception on this 'aide of the
Atlantic.
Speaking to the correspondent of the
Associated Press, Bapon d'Estournelles
said: "
Baron . d'Estournelles urges Minister
Delcasse not to let to-day's favorable mo
ment slip by, and declares that with
equal good will on both sides these three
general agreements with Great Britain
can be signed within a few months. He
finally announced his Intention of put
ting a cuestion to the Minister on the
subject in the Chamber of Deputies when
Parliament reassembled.
The new policy has three essential ob
jects: First, tne conclusion of a reason
able arbitration treatv similar to that
negotiated between Great Britain and the
United States, and in accordance with
clause 19 of The Hague international ar
bitration convention; second, a reduction
in the overwhelming naval expenses. In
agreement with France and Russia, con
cerning which the Baron claims to have
received categorical verbal and written
assurances; third, a friendly settlement
of the outstanding differences which for
twenty years have vainly exhausted' the
resources of diplomacy.
PARIS, Aug. 6.â Baron <TEstournelles
de Constant, who headed the French par
liamentary arbitration group on its re
cent, visit to London, has written an im
portant letter to Foreign Minister Del
casse setting forth the results of the re
cent exchanges of views in London and
Paris between members of the British
and French Parliaments and the leading
Ministers of the two governments. The
conferences included those with Foreign
Minister Lansdowne and Colonial Secre
tary Chamberlain, and there is good rea
son to believe that Baron d'Estournelles
in the references he makes in his letters
to the conclusion of an arbitration treaty
for the settlement of the outstanding
Anglo-French difficulties has the distinct
approval of those controlling Great Brit
ain's foreign policy, while his suggestion
for a reduction of 'naval force is due en
tirely to the initiative of the leading mem
bers of the British Ministry.
The letter pays that during twenty years
the fear of Parliamentary opposition has
alone prevented the sentiment of the An
glo-French difficulties, and now that that
fear is dispelled nothing prevents the
adoption of a conciliatory policy. All the
British statesmen whom he saw, without
distinction of party, says the'Baron. were
unanimously desiring their suggested new
policy which must be as clearly defined
as the former one was obscure.
PANAMA, Aug. 5.â By order of the
Government, El Istmeno, a t newspaper,
has been suspended for six months for"
publishing an article advocating the Inde
pendence of the Isthmus of Panama from
Colombia. The objectionable article is as
follow:
Has Colombia resDonded to the sincere ad
hesion, loyalty and important services of. the
Isthmus of Panama, of the same origin and
having the same tendencies, religious senti
ments and language? Can anybody answer
affirmatively? Is the Isthmus of Panama
happy and prosperous, belonging to Colombia?
Would It not be happier seceding as an inde
pendent, sovereign republic? Has not the above
idea been germinating for years in the hearts
of patriotic Isthmians, owing to the Justified
resentment of the noble people of this unfor
tunate strip of land which annexed Itself to
Colombia of lta own free will? Panama can
and should be absolutely Independent. We are
not happy, not satisfied in any way under Co
lombian control. Isthmians without exception
are separatists and dream of independence. We
do not seek annexation to foreign powers. We
advocate and proclaim a sovereign republic
governed and controlled by isthmians alone.
Costa Rica is a small nation, yet a happy and
prosperous one. Why not the isthmus, being
larger and with more elements, why should It
not become Independent and prosperous?

DELEGATE tickets proposed by the district
clubs of the two great parties have been filed
in the office of the Registrar of Voters, and
"accordingly the preliminary work of the primaries
â¢ is virtually over. Of course the tickets named by
the clubs are not binding upon any one, and on the
day of election each voter may vote for whom he
pleases, but nevertheless it is a safe conclusion that
â¢in each district one of the tickets proposed will be
It therefore behooves the members of the
rank and file of each party to study thc tickets closely
and to vote for that which gives most assurance of
an honest party convention and thc nomination of
candidates f.tted to fulfill the duties of the offices for
'which they are named.
As affairs stand to-day there is a promise of a
lively contest in the primaries of the Democratic as
well as of the Republican party, and consequently
we shall not see such crowds of Democratic round
ers voting at Republican primaries as in some recent
elections. Still it is certain the would-be bosses in
the Republican camp will gather all the floating
voters they can and make a strong effort to capture
a district here and there, even if they cannot elect
enough of their men to control the convention. The
situation, therefore, is not one which good Repub
licans can regard with indifference. The promise of
"a victory for clean politics is good, provided the
better elements of the 'party attend to their political
duties and vote at the primaries for the right men;
but otherwise the result is certain to be disappointing
to the hopes of those who desire to see the Repub
lican convention nominate a ticket that will have the
confidence of thc people, earn' the elections and give
the city and county a thoroughly honest and efficient
"administration.
'The election of city and county officers is always
"an important event, but this year it is especially so.
There is to be submitted to the voters a proposi
tion to bond the city to an amount of $18,135,000 for
various public improvements. A considerable per
centage of the bond propositions, if not ( the whole of
them, may be carried, and in that case the next ad
ministration will ha\-c control of the expenditure of
large sums in excess of the usual cost of govern
ment. Such being the case, the election of good men
to office at the coming election is one of well nigh
imperative necessity. No taxpayer, nor indeed any
citizen having a due regard for public welfare, can
afford to be indifferent to the issue. Attention,
therefore, should be given at once to the approach
ing primaries and earnest efforts be made to bring
about the election of the right men to the nominat
ing conventions.
In the Republican party the issue has been made
dear-far the rank and file of the party by the action
of the United Republican League, which has nomi
nated in every district a ticket well deserving the
support of every loyal member of the party. The
full list of the delegates proposed in every district
was published in The Call of yesterday and should
be carefully studied. In each and every instance the
ticket is made up of men who are thoroughly repre
sentative of the best interests of the city. They are
gentlemen of established reputation and known char
acter. They hive been pledged to no set of candi
dates, to no party faction. They will go to the con
vention untrammeled. They will be governed in their
action as delegates solely by their sense of duty to
the party and to the city, having no other object than
that of nominating men who will obtain the votes
of a majority of their fellow citizens by deserving
The prospects of the time point to a Republican
victory on election day if a proper ticket be nomi
nated, and a proper ticket will be nominated if the
rank and file of the party go to the primaries and
elect unpledged, independent, public-spirited men to
the convention. That is the issue now before the
party. It is to be hoped there will be no indifference
in the ranks. The United Republican League has
done its work well. Now let loyal Republicans give
their support in the primaries and all will be well.

Seyeral.of the municipal departments of Oakland
have expressed a modest desire to spend more than
their income this fiscal year: This may be accepted
as an indication, clear, emphatic and resolute, that
Oakland wants to take her place among the big cities
of the Union.
The National Populists who met recently at Denver
announced that their session was ordered to discuss
a reorganization of the party. While the affair is
nobody's business but their own a timely suggestion
might not be amiss. Perhaps the gentlemen of the
National Populist party mean reform when they say
reorganization.
REPORTS of the Bureau of Statistics of the
Department of Commerce and Labor con
cerning our export trade are highly satisfac
tory in every respect except one. They show that we
are doing an enormous business in foreign markets
and that we have outstripped our only rivals, Ger
many and Great Britain. Such showings are gratify
ing, but there remains the comparison of our trade
of last year with our own trade of former years, and
when studied from that point of view the result is by
no means, pleasing.
We have surpassed our rivals, we are doing an
enormous export business, but the trade is increas
ing very slowly as compared with the increase in do
mestic industries. That much is shown by the fig
ures of exports for the past five years, which are
tabulated thus:
1899 $1,203,931,222
1900 1,370.763.571
1901 .' 1,460,462.806
1902 1,355,481,861
1903 1,392,087,672
It will be seen that our export trade during the
past five years has been virtually stationary. In
fact, it was less last year than in 1901. There must be
some reason for the seeming fixity of the figures. In
well nigh every other department of industry and
commerce we have made steady progress during those
years. Why, then, should we not have augmented
our export business in something like the same pro
portion?
There are doubtless many factors involved in the
problem, but it is safe to say that one of the most
potent is the lack of a merchant marine capable of
carrying American exports to new markets. The fig
ures seem to show that we are exporting to market's
of a fixed capacity for consumption, that we reached
the level of that consumption some time ago, and
now can sell no more than in former years. Had we a
merchant service on the ocean equal to the needs of
our commerce it is almost a foregone conclusion that
new markets would b.e opened for our domestic
produce. In South America, for example, we could
sell large quantities of produce if we had proper fa-

the United States, has been the means of revealing a
large number of similar cases in which eligibles
under the civil service and employed according to
law in the Government printing office have been re
fused membership in the union and ordered by it to
resign without reference to the law or its officers!
One young woman from Boston presents a typical
case. She was eligible as a compositor in the print
ing office and was legally appointed. Next day after
she went to work the walking delegate called for her
union card. She had none, but' expressed a willing
ness to join the typographical union' in Washington
City. The walking delegate communicated with the
Boston union, which refused to consent to her join
ing in Washington or Boston. She was then told by
the walking delegate that she must make her peace
with the Boston union or quit Government employ.
As she was necessitous she applied to Boston for
union membership and was refused. She was then
ordered to quit by the walking delegate and did so,
supposing that she had no recourse.
In this way the administration of the public print
ing office has been abdicated by the Government in
favor of the unions, and the constitutional rights of
American citizens have been subverted as completely
as if they had none. "='?{â¢. \ *
The unions overstepped themselves in the Miller
case and have thereby probably overthrown their
own dominance of the office.

The superstitious may lay some stress on the fact
that thirteen convicts made their savage and desperate
escape from Folsom prison. It has not yet been de
termined, however, in view of the subsequent bloody
events, whether the number was unlucky for the con
victs or their pursuers.
The recent determination of the authorities to cap
ture and prosecute a defaulter who committed his
crime in the office of the County Clerk and then es
caped is startling enough to be considered, revolu
tionary. If .this sort of thing continues' we may be
forced to suspect that the administration of municipal
affairs may be drifting into honesty.

JUDGE ALTON B.' PARKER of New York is
kept busy dodging politicians and reporters who
â¢desire to find out his attitude toward politics
and especially toward the Democratic nomination
for the Presidency. By a correspondent of the Bal
timore American he is quoted as saying recently:
"I am without any present views on national topics,
having determined not to talk for publication on
any subject whatever." So, too, a reporter of the
Newark News reports him as saying: "I take it that
this is an interview we are now having. I want to
say frankly,, so there will be no misunderstanding,
that I cannot be interviewed on the subject of
whether or not I am a consideration in the political
condition of my party, nor upon any political ques
tion whatever."
There is a familiar story of a man who stood so
straight that he leaned backward. Judge Parker's
political attitude is similar. In his eagerness to say
nothing about politics he says enough to show the
country that he is so eager for the Democratic nomi
nation that he is afraid to have any political views
whatever â or at least is afraid to express them.
By way of defending this negative attitude the
Judge has made several explanations. In one of
them he said: "I have had nothing to do with poli
tics except to vote since 1884. The party has not
needed me." On another occasion he said to a re
porter: "I will explain my position to you, so you
can understand why I cannot talk upon the subject
you have mentioned. . I went on the bench to make
it my life-work. It is congenial to me, and I am
very happy and contented. I am with, my family
here in my home. I usually take them to Albany
for three or four months during the winter, and when
it i3 necessary for me to be away during the other
months of the year I can run down from Albany
every week. If I behave myself I can remain on the
bench for life. The salary is ample. The New
York State Court of Appeals pays its Judges larger
salaries than the United States Supreme Court. I I
shall remain on the bench. It is my ideal."
If we could take that statement at its face value
the position of the Judge would be clearly intelli
gible, and he would be at once eliminated from the
list of Presidential candidates. Unfortunately there
is good reason for believing that the Judge may be
a candidate after all. It will be noted that he says he
has taken no part in politics since 1884; that the
party has not needed him; and it appears we may
infer that if the party should need him he would set
aside his ideal life on the bench and take a chance
of four years in the White House.
One authority says that Parker might have had
the Democratic nomination for Governor of New
York last year, but declined it because he prefers the
judicial career. He then goes on tcsay: "That was
his position; it is his position to-day, so far as his
own attitude toward the Presidency is , concerned.
It may sound somewhat flippant, and as treating the
office 'lightly, to say that Judge Parker is not de
sirous of the Democratic nomination; but that is
the exact state of his mind. If it comes to him he
will accept it, taking the fact of his nomination as
a call from his party, and when his party calls he is
not one to delay making response or in rendering
it the best service of which he is capable."
From all those statements we may draw the con
clusion that Parker has no politics calculated to of
fend either the Cleveland or the Bryan wing of the
party. He likes his place on the bench, but is lis
tening for a call. Clearly the Judge is out of politics
for the present, but is willing to get in if invited.

POPE PIUS X ascends his throne amid the ac
clamations of the ( entire Christian world. He
inherits the universal good will brought about
by the gracious influence of his. illustrious predeces
sor, and enters upon his high office, not as the rep
resentative of a faction, but as the common choice of
all. While no longer young, he is reported to be still
vigorous and hale, and has every reason to expect
a long reign. The world, therefore, as well as the
church, greets him with high expectations and looks
to him for a continuance of that broad policy by
which Leo did so much to confirm and extend the
spiritual prestige of the pontificate.
Despite the universal favor with which his election
has been received, the reign of the new Pope will
not be an easy one. Difficulties and danger lurk in
the very universality of the hopes entertained con
cerning him. Where all parties and factions expect
much, some are sure to be disappointed. The elec
tion of Pius is confessedly that of a compromise be
tween two powerful rival parties in the church, and
sooner or later he, will have to confront the issues
upon which they have been divided. It remains to be
seen whether he will be able to harmonize them or be
compelled to choose the one and discard the other.
An incident connected with the announcement of
his election discloses the situation in the councils of
the Vatican and the division of opinion that exists
there. We are told that when the announcement of
the election was made from the windows of St.
Peter's there was a great rush of the people outside
to get into the basilica to receive the papal benedic
tion. Then, it is said, the attendants who had .an
nounced the election signaled the crowd to go back
to the steps of St. Peter's and wait there for the
benediction. That meant that the new Pope was
going to give a blessing. to the world from outside
the basilica, a thing that has not been done since
the days when the Vatican ruled Rome. It was rec
ognized that a revolution in the attitude of the pa
pacy toward Italy was about to be manifested, and
the crowd hastened to get out of the basilica as fast
as it went in. In a moment, however, the programme
was changed, and the crowd was called into St.
Peter's to receive the benediction there.
Just what mistake or sudden change of mind may
have caused that momentary vacillation as to the
place of giving the benediction may never be known,
but the fact that it occurred is significant of a divi
sion of sentiment within the Vatican itself. Later de
velopments will show how far the new Pope will go
in the direction of conciliation with the Italian Gov
ernment. It is not probable he will take any early
steps in that direction, though it seems conceded he
will be inclined to put an end to the present strained
relations. That much is forecast by the announce
ment on one side that he will continue the policy of
Leo toward the Italian Government, but, as the dis
patches say, will not "emphasize it." On the other
side it is evident that the governmental party expects
much, for it is already announced that the new Pope
has long been a favorite with the King and is a
friend of the Queen.
Marion Crawford in reviewing the situation fol
lowing the death of Leo stated that there were three
shades of sentiment respecting the character of the
man to be chosen as his successor. One party de
sired a political Pope, who would uphold the tem
poral power of the papacy and make its influence felt
in diplomatic circles. A second party desired above
all to choose a strong theologian, who would main
tain the dogmas of the church. The third desired
the election of an apostolic Pope, who would be,
more than anything else, the father of Christendom.
It appears from all reports that it is the apostolic
Pope that has been chosen. While Cardinal Sarto
has been noted for piety and for culture, he has
been most notable and most loved by reason of his
fidelity as a pastor. All reports speak highly of his
administration of the office of Patriarch of Venice
and of his love for the common people. Having,
then, an apostolic ambition above all else, he may
safely guide the church through the coming difficul
ties without becoming in any respect a partisan. The
Venetians, who know him better than the rest of
the world, love him, and have predicted that he will
be as much loved as Pontiff as he has been loved as
a priest and Patriarch. That prediction is worth
more as a promise to the church and to the world
than any forecasts that have been made concerning
his political policy or his theological dogmas, and it
is with high hope of its complete realization that his
accession to the headship of the church' is hailed with
gratification both in Europe and in America.

A petition signed by numerous property

the fence has been maintained, for six
years to the detriment of business on
Seventh and Mission streets. Street Su
perintendent Donovan is investigating
and he says he will recommend the re

The City Street Improvement Commit
tee was granted a permit to bltumlnize
Fourteenth street between Noe and San

The board approved a map of the boun
daries of the district to be benefited by
and assessed for changes of grade on

Before the meeting adjourned Schmitz
offered a written resolution reciting that
"he contended that the minutes of the
board were not correctly recorded regard
ing his protest to the passage of a reso
lution apportioning the appropriation for
the fiscal year 1903-1904 and increasing the
salaries of certain employes, as he con
sidered it an act of unnecessary and un
called for extravagance.
Manson objected to the latter part of
the resolution, claiming that a Commis
sioner had no right to criticize the action
of the board. He moved that the objec
tionable phrase be eliminated, but Casey's
motion that the resolution and the
amendment be laid on the table prevailed,
Schmitz voting- no.
The Civil Service Commission notified
the board that it will disapprove the tem
porary appointment of W. E. Commary,
assistant Inspector of school buildings,
for August for the reason that there'ls an
eligible list for the position. As ' the
board has appointed James *S. McSheehy
to be inspector of school buildings, Man
son said Commary would lose his posi
tion. Action, however, was postponed un
til the Board of Education is heard from.
The board denied the petition of H. R.
Glenn to erect a tent In which to Bell re
freshments on the corner of Grant ave

from Mrs. E. M. Hegger was also denied.
Schmitz was obdurate in his contention
and accused the secretary and the assist
ant secretary of having willfully failed
to record a resolution offered by him at a
subsequent meeting protesting against
the increase, which, however, had also
been lost. Secretary Jortall explained
that Schmitz had not offered a resolu
tion, but had made a motion which failed
to carry, but Schmitz was not satisfied
with this explanation until after the
meeting, when it was made clear to him.

Ferguson was fifteen years in the Mail
Company's service and the engines of the
Siberia and Korea were Installed at New
port News under his supervision. He was
65 years old at the time of his death and
stood at the head of his profession. He
had many friends here and in the Orient
and It was the result of an investigation
by his friends into the circumstances of
his death that revealed the criminal care
lessness of a shipmate as responsible for
his taking off. ,jv**
The chief engineer's widow and two
grown-up daughters reside In New York
and have been advised, it Is said, to bring
suit for damages against the Pacific Mail
Company.
The accident occurred last June, when
tho liner was approaching Kobe from,
Yokohama.* Ferguson was on his way
from his room, which was on the prome
nade deck, to the main deck. At the after
break of the promenade deck is a com
panion ladder leading to the main deck,
somo eight feet below.
While Ferguson was in his room some
body removed this ladder. The ladder
when in place Is out of sight of the
promenade deck. No notice was posted
calling attention to the ladder's absence,
no barrier In the shape of rail or line
was placed across the opening, and when
Ferguson stepped from the promenade
deck It was into space. He struck the
Iron deck below with terrific force, and
in addition to the serious internal injuries,
from which he subsequently died, sus
tained a compound fracture of one
wrist He was taken to tho hospital at
Kobe, where he died.
The accident occurred In broad day
light and the fact that an experienced,
careful man like Ferguson fell into tho
trap shows how serious was the, neglect
of the person In charge of the Job of re
moving that ladder. The only reason that
the trap did not catch a few passengers
Is that Ferguson was the first man on
board whose business took him in that di
rection.
When the news was received in San
Francisco. of the death at Kobe of George
H. Ferguson, chief engineer of the Pa
cific Mall steamship Siberia, it was stated
by the company officials that death had
resulted from, pneumonia. Alexander Cen
ter, the general agent, admitted that
Ferguson had sustained some hurt in a
fall on board the liner, but pooh-poohed
the idea that his injuries were serious,
magnified the pneumonia and suggested
that the whole affair was of too slight im
portance for any serious consideration.
W hen the liner reached port not a soul on
board would discuss the accident. The
reason has been revealed in the discovery
that Ferguson came to his death as the
result of criminal carelessness.

"Within a block of the camp many of

officers climbed over the fence to get in
formation about the children's condition,
the- tots literally swarmed around them.
The children were nearly all half naked,
with hair hanging: unkempt around their

of five families. Two of the men, who
were In a tent, said In broken English

University of Kentucky at Lexington In
1899 and later from the Kentucky Chris

has been eminently successful in gaining
a large congregation and putting the
church work on a firm financial basls.fjle

Rev. David M. Crabtree
Resigns to Take a
Needed Rest.
It is expected that the court will hand
down an opinion in the course of a few
days decisively settling the points at is
sue.
Auditor Harry Baehr was represented
by William H. Cobb and J. H. Me*. In
the course of his argument Mee 'contended
that the law (was constitutional, in that
the current of authority supported the
proposition that municipal corporations
were in a class by themselves, requiring
different legislation than in, the case of
the general public. He further contended
that it was the policy of this State to
render all property liable to be taken in
satisfaction of the claims of a creditor,
and there was no special exception to
this rule favoring a public official. He
said the true Interpretation of the- act
was that a public official's salary was
included within, the phrase "money due
and owing by a public corporation." and
that this 'express enactment of the Legis
lature should not be set aside by any sup
posed rule of public policy to the con
trary.
LAW CONSTITUTIONAL.
Thomas V. Cator argued for the peti
tioner that the law was unconstitutional,
in that it was special legislation affecting
the fees and salaries of public officials.
He took the further ground that It was
against the public policy of this State, in
the absence of an express enactment of
the Legislature, to permit the salary of a
public employe to be taken from him by
his creditors, and that consequently as
the law did not expressly mention pub
lic officials, their salaries were exempt
from its operation. He adverted to the
fact that in his interpretation of the law
he was supported by the Attorney Gen
eral In an opinion rendered by him a few
weeks ago to the Controller of the State
In a case Involving substantially similar
issues to that before the court.
In the course of the arguments it de
veloped that the Grocers' Association of
Washington. D. C, had inaugurated a
movement in that city, the result of which
was an expression of opinion by the heads
of practically all the departments of the
Government situated there, that so far
as those departments were concerned it
would compel employes of the Govern
ment to pay their debts contracted for
necessaries of life, although the Govern
ment would not consent to constitute it
self a collection agency for individuals,
nor would it recognize professional col
lectors.
It appears that for years past certain
money brokers in this State have been
doing a lucrative business in discounting
the warrants of city officials and were
consequently interested in this attempt to
overthrow the law in question. The
grocers of this city, upon the other hand,
were equally interested in having it sus
tained and therefore undertook the de
fense of the case in conjunction with the
Auditor.
OPPOSED INTERESTS.
of Ruperich upon the ground that a local
collection agency had attached his salary
under the provision of the act referred
to, and that thg Auditor was thereby
placed under a duty to pass this money
into court for the benefit of the creditor,
and not to Ruperich. George B. Ruperich
filed a petition In the Supreme Court
praying that the Auditor be compelled to
audit these salary demands. The Audi
tor, as respondent, relied upon the sec
tion above quoted as a defense.
George E. Ruperich, an employe of the
Department of Electricity of this city,
had a difficulty with the Auditor as to
two months' salary. It is claimed that
the Auditor declined to audit the demand
In the event that any one of those cor
porations owed money to the Judgment
debtor a judgment creditor was entitled
by following this procedure to have the
auditor of that corporation draw his war
rant in favor of the court which pro
nounced the judgment, and the court
upon receipt of tne money was. directed
to pay out so much thereof as was not
exempt from execution to the Judgment
creditor and to pay the balance to the
judgment debtor.
CREDITOR'S RIGHTS.
A case involving the validity and inter
pretation of a statute passed by the last
j Legislature providing for the attachment
i of moneys due by any public corpora
tion in this State was argued yesterday
morning before the Supreme Court, sit
ting in bank.
The history of the legislation in ques
tion is of interest, as it indicates the
general trend of a national movement in
augurated by the different associations of
retail grocers throughout the country. It
was attempted eight years ago to pass
a law in this State providing for the at
tachment of public officials' salaries while
in the hands of the disbursing officer.
The Judiciary Committee of the Legisla
ture considered such a law to be inaa
visable and refused to approve it.
At the three subsequent sessions of the
Legislature the Retail Grocers' Associa
tion of California attempted to'obtain leg
islation upon the subject, but without re
sult. At the last session, however, its
efforts were rewarded in that a new sec
tion was added to the Code of Civil Pro
cedure which provided in substance that
when a. creditor had reduced his claim
to judgment he might file a certified copy
of the Judgment with the Controller of
the State' of California or the Auditor of :
any county or city within the -State, ac- j
companied by his affidavit stating the
exact sum due upon the judgment and
that he desired to avail himself of the
provisions of the section In question.
The State of California and each of the
different counties and cities in the State
are in the eyes of the law separate public
corporations, having independent exist
ence and being subject to independent du
ties.

This is the proposition : You want to |ur-
nish a home. You haven't enough ready cash
to pay in full when the goods are delivered,
jence you're compelled to buy "on time." Yet
you dislike trading Jn an out-and-out install-
ment store. How are you going to get the ,
easy - payment accommodation and still buy
your goods in one of the big first-class stores?
We offer you the way.
We loan you the money, charging simply
the regular banking rate of interest â six per
cent. You go then to one of the big, first-
class furniture stores where the stock is big
and fresh, and where _ satisfaction is certain;
and when you have made your selections pay
your bill in good, hard cash.
The installment stores charge you ten per
cent above their cash prices for time. All you
pay us is six per cent. The actual saving to
you is FOUR PER CENT.
For instance: If your purchases amount to
$100.00 we will charge you $106.00â which is a
six per cent advance; 'then you pay us $20.00
cash and the balance in monthly payments
amounting to $8.60 each month. If your pur-
chases amount to $75.00 we will" charge you
$79.50; you make us a cash payment on this
of $15.00 and pay the balance at the easy rate
of $0.45 per month. .

The other missive was an advertising
circular which/is being distributed by the
Yosemite Club. It fell into the hands of
some joker, who took Corbett's picture,
which appears on the circular, and touch
ed it up artistically. Jim's closest friend
would never know him In the photograph.
His j left eye Is blackened and there are
cuts and bruises, done in red and black
ink, all pver his body. One caption in
forms Jim this is what Jeffries will do
to him, while another advises some one
to ring for an ambulance.
Betting on the fight Is expected to com

open a 1 to 2 choice. Harry Corbett iÂ» so
sanguine of his brother's winning the
fight that he has expressed his Intention
of betting Jim will knock Jeffries out. He
expects good odds on this proposition.
Jim weighed 185% pounds in ring cos
tume before he commenced work yester
day. He continues to drink two quarts
of mineral water each morning after his
work and finds it agrees with him.
Jim's extensive mail brought him two
missives which amused him. One was a
linen cuff sent him by a New York com
edian. The writer wished Jim good luck
and told him his friends in the profession
expect him to carry off the long end of
the purse.
Berger was the first victim and for
nineteen minutes, wltnout a breathing
spell, he and Corbett fought all over the
ring. The blows exchanged were no love
taps. Corbett had done but little gymna
sium work and was fresh for the. boxing.
He tried all manner of blows on Berger,
and also wrestled him about roughly as
though he expects some of this work
when he meets Jeffries. Berger was fly
ing signals of distress soon after hos
tilities commenced, but stuck gamely to
his task. This work was done in the
open air and the party then adjourned
to the gymnasium, where Yank Kenny's
troubles commenced. Kenny performs a
double duty in the Corbett camp, acting
as sparring partner and also raising the
standard of beauty among Jim's handlers.
He had hardly put up his hands before
Jim caught him a hard blow on the head
and took much of the speed out of him.
He was finally compelled to stop, as re

nerves of his neck and rendered him de

The champion and his partner claim
they had to acknowledge defeat because
of the splendid signal code used by Lyons
and Robert3. If a heart lead was desired
Roberts would tell of how sweet one of
the pretty waitress girls was on the cook.
Then, If sitting back with a first full of
spades, Lyons would spin a yarn of a
clambake and the best places to dig them.
Out would come Roberts with a spade
lead. Probably next deal the latter would
tell of a friend of his, a great clubman,
that ho expected up here to-morrow, and,
of course, a club lead followed on the part
of Lyons. If overloaded with a diamond
cult Lyons would next relate how an in
timate friend of his picked up a three
karat stone for $90. In this way it Is not
difficult to see how Jeff and Kelly went
down to defeat.

tho dinner hour Jeff participated In the
ball game, occupying the pitcher's box.
Later in the evening, with Luke Kelly as

The Cripples were lucky â no one will
doubt that, but still when they could
have won without the aid of luck they
failed. The Angels played the game all
the time and it was due to their steadi
ness and their gameness that victory
rested with them. When they once got a
good start they made enough runs to
win and took no chances after that.
Graham was wild, walking nine men.
He was hit some, too. but for a time
the luck the Cripples had on their staff
leapt the southerners at a distance from
the rubber. Hall had them, buffaloed after
the opening round of the- game and hfa
support did the rest.
In the seventh round, with the score 2 tol
against them, the Angels began to get
busy. With one gone Hoy accepted a
pass to the first bag. Wheeler drove the
ball at Francks, who fielded it in a hurry
and threw to Baxter in order to cut off
Hoy. Moose dropped the ball and both
runners were safe, when a double play
would have retired the side.
Smith then tallied Hoy with a drive to
center. Dillon scored Smith and Wheeler
by forcing the ball through the infield.
This broke up the game, for after that
the Cripples could do nothing with HalL
The score: TV
For a time at Recreation Park yester
day afternoon the Cripples had the
Angels on the gallop in order to avoid
the defeat that seemed due again. When
the time came for the showdown of the
real eameness Moose Baxter was not
there. It was he who fell down as Oak
land's chances seemed brightest. Then it
was curtains. Score. 5 to 2.

Nicht, a 4 to 1 shot, with Sidney C. Love
third. The victory of Warte Nicht was
not unexpected, despite the heavy play
on both Gregor K and Sardine, as the
track was Just to his liking.
It Is known that ever Eince Lynch and
his stable came to the local tracks with
the opening of the season he has been
closely watched. Several suspicious deals
have been investigated, but not until the
Bondage affair did the stewards get
what they regarded as ample proof of
guilt. Lynch came from California with
a malodorous reputation, and the peculiar
running of his at once began to
arouse comment. It is said that because
of his previous notoriety the local jockey
clubs would have preferred that he go
elsewhere, but as he was in good stand
ing on the turf there was no excuse lor
warning him away.
The action taken by the Harlem officials
was due to the poor showing made by Or
pina last Monday, when, it was alleged,
she was deliberately pulled by Jockey
treanor and the race allowed to go to
Postmaster Wright.
In the July selling stakes at Hawthorne
last week. Bondage, heavily backed by
his owner, James Arthur, ran a bad last
and complaint was made that the horse
had been tampered with. An investiga
tion was started by the track officers and
it is claimed that evidence was secured
showing 1 that James Crabb, an employe
of the Arthur stable, had given Bondage
two powders and that they came from
the Lind stable, which had Orslna in the
same race.
For connection with the drugging of the
horse Bondage on July 27 the stable of C.
Llnd & Co., composed of C. Lind and D. J.
Lynch, is suspended indefinitely and James
Lynch and James Harris, the latter beinÂ£
known as James Crabb. are ruled eft the turf.
The suspension of John Uobb, implicated in
the same case, is removed.
The decision in the Bondage case by
the Chicago Jockey Club officials was
handed down simultaneously with that of
the Harlem Jockey Club, and is as fol
lows: '
CHICAGO, Aug:. 5.â Tho racing: firm of
I>!nd & Co. of San Francisco, Jockey
Treajior, James Lynch and James Har
ris, the latter two employes of the Arthur
stable, were ruled off the turf to-day by
the stewards of Harlem Jockey Club 3nd
the Chicago Jockey Club. The official
ruling of the Harlem officials follows:
The temporary suspension of C. Lind, D. J.
Lynch and Jockey Treanor is made permanent
and they are warned off the Harlem racetrack.
The further entries of C. Lind and D. J.
Lynch and of the horses Orosius, Orfeo, Or

fined since Monday last, make a favora
ble report on his condition and it is most
likely that the uxoricide will live to stand
trial for his crime. "To guard aganist

was shot on Sunday last by her husband,
William J. Sabins, a bookbinder, who
afterward attempted suicide by cutting
his own throat, died at the Central
Emergency Hospital at 1:30 last evening.
That the woman lived so long with two
bullets in her brain is deemed remark-*
able by the surgeons who attended her at
the hospital.
One of the bullets entered from the
lower part of the face and lodged in the
brain and the second one, probably fired
after the unfortunate woman had fallen,
entered at the skull. The missile in en
tering drove a hairpin through the skull
and into the brain and it was only by a
great effort that the wire pin was re
moved when Mrs. Sabins was operated
upon soon after the tragedy.

Two weeks ago Shores resigned as
treasurer and also surrendered his posi
tion as night steward at Wagner & Des
loh's bakery, on Washington street. His
books were examined and the shortage
brought to lleht. but search for Shores
was fruitless. Last Friday Conwell re
ceived a letter from the runaway, say
ing he was en route to Alaska and would
reimburse the union.
Shores came into police observation dur
ing April last year, when Mrs. Jane Mor
gan, a lodging-house keeper, caused his
arrest on a charge of battery. But Shores
retaliated by having the woman arrested.
It developed that Mrs. Morgan, many
years Shores' senior, was infatuated with
the steward and pursued him with so
much vlcor that his days were rendered
unbearable. : >
Charles W. Shores, former treasurer of

Yesterday the child was taken to the

ravenously and upon investigation it was
discovered that the elephant had con

operation at that time was obviated and
it is hoped that further inconvenience is
at an end.
The etrange tale is vouched for by Dr.
L. F. Herrick, while an X-ray photo
graph taken of the throat, with the ele
hant inside, bears mute testimony that
what the doctor eays is true. Three
weeks ago little Hazel was playing with
a child's Noah's ark and While she
emptied the numerous stalls of their oc
cupants a Email lead elephant was placed
by her in her mouth. An awkward move
ment and it had slipped past her control
and lodged far down out of reach. The
parents hoped against hope that as it had
started it would continue. But Hazel was
unable to swallow and after a week of
discomfort Dr. Herrick was called.
Yesterday, however, the elephant con
tinued on its way. Unlike the boa. the
child is not waiting for her extravagant
meal to digest, but is eating ravenously
and the doctor hopes it is all for the best.
The Scriptures intimate that it is dif
ficult for a camel to pass through the
eye of a needle, yet little 7-year-old Hazel
Clark, daughter of H. J. Clark, Sixty
third street and San Pablo avenue. Golden
Gate, has swallowed an elephant. She
had considerable difficulty in performing
the feat and for three weeks the passage
of the aesophagus was blocked to solid
food.

1118 Broadway, Aug. 5.
The Southern Pacific officials were not
ready after the conference to say what
they would do in the premises. Manager
Kruttschnitt said he desired further time
to ascertain what revenue the Southern
Pacific obtained from the travel between
stations within the city before he could
say what the company would do in the
matter of a 2-cent fare.
It is Bald that the demands of the ex
ecutive committee were considered some
what stiff by the railroad people and took
them by surprise, as they did not expect
that Alameda would ask so much.
It was arranged that the representatives
of Alameda and the Southern Pacific
would meet "again next Friday afternoon
at the same place, when it is expected
that Manager Kruttschnitt will be ready
to announce definitely what his corpora
tion will do.
It was also decided that the executive
committee would give Herman Eppinger
Jr. and Robert B. Mott, who filed an ap
plication Monday night for the south side
track, Â»Â¦ hearing to-morrow night in the
City Hall. Eppinger, Mott and ex-Con
gressman James G. Maguire. who repre
sents them, will be afforded an opportu
nity to inform the committee who are
back of their project and how it is to be
financed. Although the majority of the
committe of fifty take littte or no stock
in the Eppinger-Mott proposal, it believes
it only fair that the promoters of the new
local train and ferry service be given a
chance to show their hand and what they
arÂ« prepared to do. -
All of the important stipulations which
Alamedans believe should be entered in
the terms of the franchises, such as the
length of the life of the franchises, the
payment into the city treasury by the
Southern Pacific of a certain sum for the
privilege of using the avenues and streets
of Alameda, the betterment of the local
service, the establishment of a 2-cent fare
within the limits of the city and other de
mands of lesser Importance, were taken
up and discussed thoroughly by the repre
sentatives of the city and the railroad
company.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 5.â All of the members
of the executive committee of the com
mittee of fifty, with President Joseph
Forderer of the City Trustees, went to
San Francisco to-day and in the after
noon held a conference with representa
tives of the Southern Pacific relative to
the two local franchises sought by that
corporation, what the people of Alameda
v.-ant in exchange for the privileges and
the concessions that the company is pre
pared to grant. The meeting was held in
the Crocker building, in the office of Ma
jor Charles L. Tilden, chairman of tha
committee of fifty and ex-officio member
of the executive committee. Besides Til
den there were present on behalf of Ala
meda, Frank Otis, chairman of the execu
tive committee; Charles S. Neal, T. O.
Daniells. Joseph Knowland, S. M. Haslett
and C. R. Smith. Representing the South

GRASS VALLEY, Aug. 5.â Despite every
effort to prevent it, blackleg continues to
spread in this county in the vicinity of
Chicago Park. Within the week it is said
over sixty head of cattle died from the
disease. Vaccination goes on with all ra
pidity, and cattlemen are busy collect
ing and burning carcasses. The disease
is no longer confined to calves, but is at
tacking full-grown animals. To-day three
valuable cows belonging to William
George died from blackleg. Cattlemen
are much alarmed, ' fearing the disease
may wipe out a large portion of the
herds.

Isabella is believed to be a waif run
wild. Her mother stated she had neve
punished the child because it did no good.
Afraid neither of the dark nor the police,
she roamed at will. It is said she swears
because she has heard others do it; that
she was expelled from school because she
had never been taught obedience at home.
Isabella Maguire, the girl who has de
veloped abnormal tendencies toward
wrong doing, was committed to-day by
Judge Ellsworth to the California Train
ing Home for Girls. Her little fingers
dipped Into her mother's purse without
the latter's knowledge and she was wont
to run away from her home until the
mother, worn out with anxiety caused by
her incorrigible offspring, applied to the
courts for u id. She, was given^the choice
between the State reformatory at Whlt
tler or the home in Alameda, and choss
the latter, as it would be nearer to her
mother in Emeryville.
Â¦ Miss Anita Whitney, the probation of
ficer under whose care the child now is,
believes ehe can * be reformed. It U
thought the restraining influences of a
home, where opportunities to do wrong
are removed as far as possible from those
within and the special attention she will
be given, will correct her degenerate ten
dencies.

The first resolution condemned feud
riots and mob law as unworthy* of civ

murder and the burning and torturing of
persons, even when clearly guilty, as bar
barous and a menace to the peace and
security of all good citizens. All Catho

and spread in the community sound opin
ions against such savagery.
The federation also protested against
the action of the French Government in
attempting to legalize religious prosecu

to wrest the Government from those who
have misused the powers entrusted to
them. The Catholic Truth societies were
commended and members of the federa

Phil May was a famous pen and ink de
lineator of London's rag and tatterdom.
He was bom In Leeds in 1Â«64. When 12
years old he was obliged to leave school
and shift for himself. He was hired by
the father of one of his friends, who was
a local scene painter. By sketching cos
tumes and designing comic masks he
gradually gained a small reputation as an
artist around the theaters. A manager
finally engaged him to play small parts,
but with the provision that he do six
large sketches a week of the chorus In
plays, the sketches to be used as show
bills in shop windows of the towns the
company played in. When he was 18 he
was employed to design the dresses for
the Leeds pantomime.
The turn in his fortune came when he
made the acquaintance of the photog
grapher who took his drawings of Irving,
Bancroft and Tolle and published them.
After this he managed to have a few
drawings accepted by periodicals. One
of these, a drawing of Mr. Bancroft, pub
lished in Society, secured him a perma
nent place on Stephens' Review.
Shortly afterward he went to Australia
and for three years was employed in Syd
ney on the Bulletin. While there he suc
ceeded in catching and setting into the
style of pen and ink work that made him
famous. When he returned to England
he was the recognized master of that
style of illustration and he was almost
immediately admitted to the Olympus of
English illustrators, the round table of
Punch, taking the place of Du Maurier.
It was about this time that Whistler said
of him: â¢
"Black and white art is summed up in
two wordsâ Phil May."
Captain Wringe was for a few moments
in serious danger, being grappled by sev
eral men who could not swim and who
held fast to him until all were rescued
by a boat. Captain Bevis reached shore
after rescuing a man who was unable to
keep afloat. Both captains returned to
their yachts after being provided with dry
clothing by guests of a nearby hotel.
A great crowd had been attracted to a
nearby â¢ wharf, where Captains Wringe
and Bevis landed after procuring tackle
for the purpose of hauling the steam
launch out of water. One end of the
tackle was fastened to the stern of the
Buttercup and the other was secured to
one of the piles of the wharf. While they
were thus engaged the wharf collapsed
and all on it were thrown into the water.
For a time it was feared that many had
been crushed under the timbers, but with
the exception of a few who were slightly
cut and bruised all succeeded in getting to
shore unhurt.
Captain Wringe and Captain Bevis,
with three sailors, left the Shamrock In
Sandy Hook bay in the afternoon In the
steam launch Buttercup and started up
the Shrewsbury River for the Highlands
of Navesink. On the way the Buttercup
struck a sandbar and it became apparent
that unless she was immediately beached
she would founder. Captain Wringe took
the wheel and headed her for the beach.
The water had risen almost to the furnace
door when the bow of the Buttercup took
b"bttom.
NEW YORK. Aug. 5.â Captain Robert
Wringe of the Shamrock HI and Captain
Bevis of Shamrock I had a narrow es
cape to-night through the collapse of a
pier tin the Shrewsbury River at the
Highlands. With twenty other persons,
including several members of the crew
of the challenger, the two sailing mas
ters were precipitated into the water, but
were not hurt.
This land had already been withdrawn
from all save homestead entry under the
irrigation act, but is now entirely with
held. It is the first tract in Southern
California to be thus reserved exclusively
to the Government, which fact carries the
Impression that it has been recommended
by the experts' who have recently been
over the ground as a site suitable for res
ervoir purposes.
The brief telegram conveying the im
portant news reads as follows:
On account of rroj?eted irrigation -work, sus
pend from aH forms of disposal land in town
fhlps l't south, ranges 22, 23 and 24 east: It
Fouth. ranges 2."l and 21 east; 15 eouth, range
24 east, S. B. M.
The selection of a reservoir site in con
nection with the recent irrigation experi
ments along the river has been pending
for some time. J. B. Lippincott, Gov
ernment hydrographer here, returned not
long ago from an inspection of that dis
trict, the recommendation of reservoir
sites being one of the missions of his
trip, it is understood.
Lippincott said to-night that he is not
at liberty to make any statement con
cerning the national irrigation work that
has been undertaken in this district, but
volunteered the information that the Gov
ernment has prepared plans for work in
this region on a much larger scale than
the local offices of the geographical sur
vey had expected.
Special Dispatch to The / Call
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 5.-lnformat(on
which appears to signify that the Gov
ernment has selected a large tract of land
in the southeastern part of San Diego
County for a reservoir site in connection
with the work proposed along the Colo
rado River under the provisions of tne
national irrigation bill, lias reached lh*
United States Land Office here. The local
authorities have received a telegram from
the General Land Office In Washington
ordering the withdrawal from all forms
of disposal upward of 12,000 acres of Gov
ernment land lying in the bend of the*
Colorado River, on the California side,
just north of the Yuma Indian reserva

FROM MISCHIEF
It is reported that Kev. Mr. Pianette came
very nearly dying this week from the effects
of brutal treatment at the hands of an at
tendant, being- kicked, it Is reported, in such a
vicious , manner that It was really feared his
Injuries would pro% - e fatal, and he is now very

Other patients who are wholly insane, if as
sured Immunity from the abuse sure to follow
their testimony, can tell stories of man's in
humanity to man that will raise such a storm of
Indignation it will astound the State.
For the past three weeks a local paper
has been making perlous charges con
cerning the management of the hospital.
The articles containing these allegations
have contained much "inside" inturmation
and Dr. Campbell has Instituted an in
vestigation among his subordinates in
order to discover where certain informa
tion originated. Yesterday morning the
local paper contained a special from Pat
ton telling of the ."violent and cruel"
treatment administered to Rev. Mr. Pian
ette,'recently committed from Los Ange
les. 'This brought matters to a climax
at the asylum and the, ' superintendent,
having already suspected Steward Whit
aker of being the author of the printed
statements, called him to account.
; At' the meeting of the board of man
agers Whitaker's case will be investi
gated, as will the charges which have
been made against the management. The
story published here this morning which
brought about the disruption at the hos
pital read in part:
SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 5.-There
was a war of words on at the Southern
California State Hospital at Highland
this afternoon between C. N. Whitaker,
steward at the asylum, and the medical
superintendent, Dr. M. B. Campbell. As
a result Whitaker has been suspended.
His case will come up before the board
of managers at a special meeting called
for next Friday.

May died of phthisis after a year of poor

CHILD SWALLOWS
A TOY ELEPHANT
Some of the mob thought hanging too
good for Hamilton and wanted to tor
ture him. but the original programme
prevailed and it was decided to hang him.
Some one produced a black mask like
that used in a legal hanging and it was
put over the head of Hamilton. It reach
ed down to ,his shoulders. The rope was
then produced, placed about his neck and
then thrown over the guy wire, being long
enough to reach within grasping distance
of the lynchers. It was seized by power
ful men, the body was lifted off the
ground and suspended at a heieht of
about four feet. The doomed wretch be
gan to ga6p for breath. After Hamilton
had been held by the lynchers for a time,
long enough to make certain he was dead,
the rope was tied to the telegraph pole
and the body left suspended. The crowds
when they were satisfied the wretch had
breathed his last quietly melted away
and sought their beds, and the streets
were Eoon deserted.
Meanwhile another company of masked
men. about eighty in number, had
ifarched up the street and taken positions
about the entrance to the jail. All were
masked and all were orderly. With these
men none attempted to interfere.
About twenty masked men. their faces
concealed with handkerchiefs, marched in
an orderly manner up the street toward
the Jail. When they got within sight
the guards thrown about the structure
called upon them to halt. The answer of
the masked men was to throw the guards
to the ground. The keys were taken
from the guards, the jail yard entered
and finally entrance was efjected into the
Jail proper.
When the cell containing the guilty man
was reached no key could he found to fit
It. It was necessary to saw and hack at
the bars until the door could be opened.
What transpired during the operation,
what Hamilton. said, probably will not be
known until some of the lynchers make
public the details, hut Hamilton after
about fifteen minutes' delay was dragged
out of the cell and down Into the yard.
ASOTIN, Wash.. Aug. 5.â The excite
ment consequent upon the lynching of
William Hamilton. Player of little Mabel
Richards, has abated. The feeling that
Hamilton should be hanged was practi
cally unanimous and there were those
who thought he should be tortured. It
was finally agreed that vengeance would
be satisfied by hanging him.

Suttner and others have maintained a
picket at the northwest corner of Sacra
mento and Drumm streets, where the fac
tory of the petitioners is situated, and

States Circuit Court yesterday asking
that the San Francisco Labor Council and
strikers, pickets and boycotters. to the
number 'of more than 100 be restrained
from Interfering with the business of the
petitioners and from intimidating and
beating their employes.
The complaint alleges that Mitchell
Suttner and other defendants conspired to

for bags received from other States and
from Territories of the United States and
that by means of threats and violence
they have deterred working men and wo
r..en from engaging in the service of the
firm.

She was entering the harbor in
charge of a pilot and struck with
terrific force on. the bar. The blow shiver
ed her timbers with a vengeance and con
verted the tight little bark In an Instant
into a veritable sieve. The fact that she
was loaded with lumber alone prevented
her going to the bottom as soon as she
cleared the shoal on which she struck.
The star witness of the day. Sam Yat
Sam. waf thfn called to the witness
stand and testified through Chinese In
epector John E. Gardner that he was a
native of China, a laborer, and that he
came to the United States in 189S in tran
sit to Mexico. Then he slipped over the
border through Kl Paso to Deming. While
in Demins he paid a white man whose
name he did not romc-mber 5100 for a cer
tificate of residence, which wa* sent to
him from San Francisco by Toy Man
Sing, who wrote him a letter stating that

Mr. Shcrtridge introduced the letter
Mess book of Lynch's office, wherein
Lynch stated to Chinese Inspector Charles
Mrehan at El Paso that the Lynch signa
tures on two Chinese residence certifi
cates; photographs of which were sent to
him. were genuine. Lynch paid he could
rot remember having seen such a letter,
end that he had not been made aware of
the existence of the letter until a few
months ago.
The witness stated that 400 duplicate
Certificates that had been made out dur
ing thp- administration of Osca M. Wei
fjurn, Mr. Lynch's predecessor, had never
been called for. In reply to a question as
to whether Dillard had not offered to re
sign during the progress of the trial of
Wclburn for embezzling the funds of the
Government, Lynch replied that Dillard
bad offered to resign because a dispute
had arisen between Dillard and Special
Revenue Agent Thomas as to the genuine
ness of one of the Welburn signatures.
On another occasion Dillard wanted to re
sign because his wife came to Collector
Lynch several times and complained of
Dillard's conduct. Dillard left the offlce
on May 10. 1902. â¢
Mr. Lynch admitted that he had gone
before the Federal Grand Jury and sworn
in the first instance tSfat he was in doubt
as to a part of those signatures. He had
sworn positively as to five, but as to four.
Â¦te-en he had stated lie was in doubt. At
that time he had not made any compari-
"I expressed doubts as to a portion of
them. After a careful examination I
satisfied .myself that they were my sig
natures. I examined enlarged photo
graphs" of these signatures." replied Mr.
Lynch, "and I satisfied myself that they
were not ray signatures."
"Have you not expressed doubts to
Special Revenue Agent Thomas as to
whether the fourteen sigmatures on the
if-rtificates produced in evidence were
forged or genuine?" asked Mr. Shortridge.
NOT HIS SIGNATURES.
Mr. Woodwurths objection to the ques
tion was sustained. Then Mr. Shortridge
t'ried to prove !Â©â¢ Collector Lynch that
Dillard's, roll top desk in the offlce had
been broken into on several occasions, bÂ»\:
Lynch did not remember this.
"Did not Dillard insist that the photo
graph Â¦ in the Ahem case was not the
photograph of the applicant and didn't
you overrule him?" asked Mr. Shortridge.
x CAMPAIGN HEADQUABTEKS.
Mr. Shortridge then sought to show that
the supply-room, opening off the corridor,
had been u*ed in the campaign of 1903
as. a "place for secret political consulta
tions, and the witness admitted that on
<5ne occasion Deputies Breidenstein. Gil
christ and Wright used the room in which
to address envelopes containing political
matter. He denied, however, that the
room had been used for political purposes
during the whole of the campaign.
In repiy to another question Lynch ad
mitted that he had forwarded a duplicate
certificate of registration of a Chinese tt>
J..W. Ahem. District Attorney of Kern
County, and In that case he was con
vinced that the application was genuine
and that the original certificate had been
lo'st.
United States Internal Revenue Col
lector Lynch was recalled for cross-ex
amination in the United States District
Court yesterday morning: in the case of
the United States vs. William H. Dillard,
indicted for forgery. Samuel M. Short
ridge of defendant's counsel proceeded to
show by the witness that all the other
deputies In Lynch's offlce, also other per
sons, fcad access to the rooms in that of
fice and to the Chinese records; that Jani
tors, indexers and others had access to
the rooms.
Mr. Lynch said that Dillard had copies
ct all the letters and took letters to the
PoetoSce. He was generally the last to
leave the efflce, added Mr. Lynch. He
did a little of everything and "was the
handy man around the office."
Mr. Shortridge called the attention of
the witness to the fact that on the list
of- deputies made out by him the name
cf Senator John G. Tyrrell was absent.
Mr. Lynch explained that the Senator
was in the office only a short time. He
explained that when he took charge of
the office on September 1.1S37. some of the
duplicate Chir.ese certificates in the vault
were loose and gome were tied with tape.
He e.t once obtained an order from the
department and had them bound in
volumes of 100 each and indexed. Some of
the certificates had been lost and could
not be found.
"We have mi:ch to thank the Ameri
cans for. They have set us a good ex
ample and our people have profited by
it. We are beginning to keenly appre
ciate the necessity of commercial enter
prise, and I am satisfied that the people
of Salvador, remote as they are from
the world's great trade centers, are stead
ily improving their conditions jfad will
some day figure as an important factor
in the commercial interests of the west
ern hemisphere."
The Escallons and Consul General Ma
theu expect to leave for Salvador on the
next steamer.
The father of the two young men â¢ is
one of the richest coffee planters In Sal
vador, his flncas .lying within the state
of Santa Ana, of which he was Governor
until elected to the Presidency last -March.
He Is a graduate of Harvard, and has
taken a deep interest in the education
Â©f his sons, who. at his suggestion, un
dertook a tour, of the world for Instruc
tion. They have almost concluded the
tour. Pedro, Uhe elder of the sons, for
a time attended school in this State and
speaks English fluently. Both boys, the
elder of whom is 22 and the other 19 years
of age, are typically Central Americans
In their manners, although they have
readily accustomed themselves to foreign
habits. and thoroughly enjoy the methods
of amusement of this country. They
modestly discuss the administration of
their father in Salvador, and, referring
to the future of. their country yesterday,
they united in the prediction that the
republic would coon be out of debt and
well on a prosperous career and Pedro
added:
Pedro and Fredericq Escalion, sons of
Jose Pedros Escalion. the newly elected
President of the republic of Salvador, ac
companied by P. J. Matheu. Consul Gen
eral of the republic In Paris, are regis

Gen. Manager. Gen. FaÂ». Afit.NEW YORK, Aug. 5. â The hour for closing
I of to-day's stock market was hailed with re
lief by the highly strung members of the ex
Â¦Â¦:Â¦.â¢ r<- The day was one of excitement and
alarm : and the facing awajr of the prices of
*4-cur!Ues was Â»o rapid and comprehensive as
to â¢rouae.grave fears of the consequences. The
antiMjncements of two failures were the only
two distressing developments, and neither of
them mat a surprise. Same of the day'* liqui
dation wa* supposed ts be of collateral on the
I loans at the failed firrr.B. although It was
[officially announced I:i one case that the crAl-
I Â¦ â¢ bad decided to withhold the collateral
!.'â¢ Â¦ ~j thÂ« market in its present condition. It
pas very evident that a very general closing
but cf collateral in loans was in progress and
feiuch cf it was allowed to go for what lt
irould bring. 'As the demand for stocks is still
ixceedinrly light, the natural result was a de
ti. .riiizatsun of the market and the pressur*
*t*-w more acute from the reactionary selling
ir. forcing a shrinkage cf the collateral in
fitter loans. 60 tÂ»x as the news of the day
wtt. concerned there wan very elender bads for
*Â»â¢ tacrlflc* cf securities beyond the uneasy 1
Â¦â¢lire that collateral could not be readily real
*Â»d on and the consequent desire to convert
JBlr.to ready money. This is the essence

itTJiatu'ral result to-day. Expectation was mt

WEATHER AND CROP CONDITIONS
! Corn products have moved up 50c per ton. In
1 Fympathy with the raw gialn. The other
! Feeds tuffs are unchanged. Ifay Is easy under
continued heavy receipts and prices show some
shading. The circular of Sorners & Co. says:
Â¦ '"Hay shipments have been very heavy dur
! ing the pant week, the total with to-day's ar
rivals beine 6300 tons, more than double the
quantity that would be ordinarily consumed In
one wef-k's â¢ time. On comparing- the records
with last year's account we flnrt, that the corre
f-ponuinK week of 1001! ahowPd arrivals of 4500
tons. The week previous, however. showed
5800 tons, which . was noted ns about the
heaviest week's arrivals >in thf history of the
trade. The cry for cars la still heard In many
diatrlcte. for certain sections seem especially
favored, while others are compelled to hold
back their hay with but an occasional chance
to semi In a few carloads.
"Under pressure of these heavy receipts
the market has been a bit softer. Wo can
hardly quote any material chango In prices,
but the feeling has naturally been quite weak.
From -all reports this influence haa extended
EomewhHt into the country and buyers do not
seem nearly as eager. a*. they have been during
the pant levy weeks. Quite a portion of the
n-op has heen bought up, however, so there is
little trading yet to bo done. What still re
mains unsold will .probably chance hands at
somewhat lower figures than have been noted
during July. . %
' "There in no change in the outlook, for the
fairly' jrood demand ' continues frfcm outside
points, mpny* consumers now stocking up for
their winter's supply. One dis<-ouraglug report
haa come In of late to tho effect that many
district* that tire now buying hay through
the San Francisco market have quite a bit of
hay of their own. Thia is being held at such
prices, however, that buyers have gone else
where. Later tho farmers must surely dispose
of their holdings with the consequence that our
market will have to suffer later on.
Â¦ "We still note a scarcity of strictly gilt
edge wheat hay, most everything now arriving
being good wheat hay."

CHICAGO. Aug. 5. â There was a firm open-
Ing In wheat due to the higher cables and to
the continued rains throughout the Northwest.
September being V4Â®VÂ«c higher at SO%Â®Blc.
All the outside markets were strong early In
the day. and this was a bull factor here during
the first few minutes of trading and helped to
hold prices temporarily, but so much long
wheat came out on the advance that prices be
gan to decline steadily. The Northwest mar
kets, which had been strong early, had quite
a severe decline later In the day, on predictions
of more favorable weather for that section of
thÂ« country and this fact aided in the down
turn. Extreme weakness prevailed the latter
part of the day and September declined to
79%c. closing at 70 ! J 8 @79%c. a net loss of
Trading In corn was rather quiet and gov
erned largely by the action of wheat. Favor
able weather for the crop restrained the bulls,
and small receipts held the bears in check.
The Illinois corn report, making the condition
of the crop 73 on August 1 against 78 last
month, had a strengthening influence, but the
weakness in wheat overbalanced all other fac
tors. The close was weak with September %
C'ic lower at 62 Vic
Oats ruled quiet throughout' the entire day
and prices were Influenced mainly by the
course of other grains. â¢
Trading was mostly oJ a local character.
September closed %c lowtr at 34V&C.
Provisions were exceedingly dull and prices
were inclined to droop. September pork closed
2^4 lower at $13 05. September lard was un-
changed at $7 02ft. while ribs were off 2ViQ5c
at $S 07^??8.10.

Conditions In the fruit market stood about
the same as previously reported and prices of
fruit in small packages had but little change.
One canner was In the -market for Aprlcota,
and aÂ» there was no competition he was able
to secure a considerable quantity at his own
price. The leading canners were still heav
ily supplied with Bartlett . Pears and were not
handling Peaches. Apricots or Plums. Fancy
Pears were In somewhat limited supply, and
No. 2 stock, which was plentiful, moved more
freely in consequence. There was a fair
inquiry for choice fruit for shipment
north, but orders â¢ were not sufficiently
numerous to permit any advance in prices.
Plums, FIgrs and choice Nectarines were rather
scarce and steady, but other descriptions con
tinued to arrive .freely and were generally
easy. Seedless Grapes arrived freely from
several sections, but moved telowly, most of
the offerings being poor and eour. Other
Grape* were in free supply and dull. Water
melons and Cantaloupes were unchanged with
supplies plentiful. Nutmeg Melons were abun
dant and easier. Attractive lots of Raspber
ries. Blackberries and large Strawberries con
tinued to sell readily at good prices. Receipts
of Longworth Strawberries were light, but as
they came to hand soft and badly shaken up
prices ranged lower.
. Aside from a firmer feeling In Mexican
Limes, which were moving off well, there was
nothing new to report In Citrus or Tropical
fruits.

was helped by the fact that some of the de
velopments which were feared from yester
day's meeting, of directors did not occur. As
the weakness of these stocks was a patent fac
tor in the weakness of yesterday's market,
the strong support accorded them had a sooth
ing effect on sentiment. The result was a
pretty general recovery from the opening de
clines. Then came the announcement . of the
first failure, that of an Important house with
commitments in a variety of stocks. From
that time until the close the liquidation was
intermittently pursued with occasional rallies
on thort covering. There was an eager rush
to cover among the bears in the final dealings,
but even then there were renewed breaks at
other points, and the closing was extremely
nervous and excited, with very Irregular fluc
tuations. The United States Steel stocks suf
fered comparatively small losses, but both the
common and the preferred and the sinking
fund five per cent bonds touched low records
during the day. Liquidation In Missouri Pa
cific was very latent and it suffered an ex
treme Io58 of 6%. Much of the liquidation in
this stock was attributed to the account of one
of the suspended firms. It carried down Wa
bash preferred five points with it. Erie was
very heavily sold as the day progressed. The
Pacifies and Grangers were under steady pres
sure during most of the day. The violent de
clines In the Colorado and Southern stocks, the
Southern Railway stocks and Virginia-Caro
lina Chemical were associated with the fail
ures. Some of the high priced comparatively
Inactive stocks were severe sufferers. Ameri
can Snuff breaking 15 and New York Air
brake, Pullman, Consolidated Gas. General
Electric and Chicago and Eastern Illinois cer
tificates from 5 to 10 points.
Call loans we.i slightly firmer, but there was
nothing in the time money market to explain
thÂ« pressure to retire loans. A further eharp
break in sterling exchange caused an approach
in the rate toward the *old-lmport point.
Profit-taking in the grain market was a satis
factory development, which was offset, how
ever, by the continued speculative manipula
tion In cotton. A cut in price of Eteam coal
by the Reading an<l talk of a Rock Island
Ftrike, which was denied, were made some
thing of by the beam. Satisfactory reports of
railroad earnings, including a 13 per cent in
ereasÂ« in gross earnings for July over last
year by the New York Central, were -with
out any Influence upon sentiment.
Bonds were weak In Ej-mpathy with stocks.
Total sales (par value), tt. 640,000.
United Htates bonds were aJl unchanged on
laet call.

On December 19 a store at Eighteenth
and Dolores streets, which was also a
postal sub-station, was visited, and while
the young lady in charge went out to sell
the man In the buggy some stamps the
confederate seized a sack containing
money and stamps to the value of $65
and the pair drove away with the sack.
Maguire was arrested on January 23 and
was identified as the man In the buggy.
He was held to answer, but gave bonds.
Last Monday morning, shortly after 10
o'clock, a man entered the grocery and
fruit store of E. Boschetti & Co., 1388
Bush street, and said that a man in" a
buggy wanted a $5 gold piece for $5 in
silver. Boschetti went outside and the
man In the buggy kept him talking for
a minute or two about fruit and then
asked for 5 cents' worth of peaches. When
Boschetti re-entered the store he saw a
$20 gold piece lying on the floor beside the
safe, the door of which was open, and
he discovered that $200 had been stolen
from tho safe. He rushed outside, but
the man with the buggy and the other
man had disappeared. BoschetU notified
the police and Detective Reynolds was de
tailed on the case. He told Policeman
Mitchell where the criminal could be
found and Mitchell arrested Maguire on
Monday night and he was locked up In
"the tanks." He has been Identified aa
the man In the buggy, and the police are
searching for his confederate.
Frank Maguire, who was arrested laÂ»t
January on a charge of grand lar
ceny aijd who is awaiting trial in the Su
perior Court, has been, the police allege,
carrying on the same daring game that
landed him in prison at that time. Ha
ha3 a confederate. Recently several com
plaints have been made to the police by
grocers and other business men of thÂ«
actions of two men. One would drive up
to the store in a buggy and his confeder
ate would enter and say that the man in
the buggy wanted a drink or some arti
cle that would necessitate the storekeep
er's going outside. During his absence
the confederate would rob the till or thÂ«
cash drawer. .
The market was liberally supplied with Poul
try, and while there was' continued firmness In

Harrison's circular says: "Since the depar
ture of the steamer Sonoma, there have been
the following deliveries of coal from Aus

tons. Of the above named fifteen cargoes,
eleven have arrived within the pa3t week,
which will amply supply all pressing demands
for this month. There are still on the en
gaged list now afloat, and to be loaded for this
market, slxty-clx vessels, with a carrying
capacity of 195,000 tons. The coal fleet from
Newcastle has already diminished and will con
tinue to diminish for this port for some time,
as grain freights outward from here are now. in
a demoralized condition with no likelihood for
any early improvement. Furthermore, the labor
troubles in British Columbia have become am
icably settled, hence there will be generous de
liveries from there from this time forward.
The simultaneous arrivals for the past several
days will cause a congestion of wharf room
to discharge. Prices remain steady, and should
remain so if wholesale dealers do not force
their receipts en the market, fortunately there
will be ample yard room to receive these recent
arrivals. â¢ as there Is very little coal In store.
The principal grades of coal now being deliv
ered- from Newcastle will be utilized for domes
tie purposes, hence should bring fair prices."

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Under this regime of an interregnum of
eighteen months the question of the division of
The objects for action of divorce are to de
termine the Individual status of the parties
to the action and to determine the division of
communal property. An appeal can be taken
from any decree within six months, conse
quently by this amendment to the Civil Code
the time of appeal ia extended to eighteen
months.
OBJECTS OF DIVORCE.
The case of Deyoe, which is to be made
the test of the constitutionality of the
amendment to the Civil Code, is based
upon an appeal .for a writ of mandate
compelling the Superior Court of Mendo
clno County to grant a final decree of
separation to Deyoe and his wife, Annie
I. Deyoe.
The arguments, upon the decision of
which hangs the fate of the popular trips
to Reno, partook of a nature so legally
technical that any prospective divorcee
would have blanched with terror at the
intricate ramifications of the counselors'
oratory- J. M. Mannon Jr. of the firm of
Mannon & Mannon in outlining the case
for the plaintiff said In part:
The amendment to the Civil Code la uncon
stitutional on the following grounds:
It is a special act regulating the practice of
the courts of justice.
The object of the law Is not expressed In its
title.
It Is a special act where a general act can
be made applicable.
It interfiles with the uniform operation of
general, law.
By the act passed by the Legislature
the former law permitting the marriage
of divorced persons after a year from the
date of the decree of separation was made
more stringent by an addition to the
Civil Code. This required that Judges of
Superior Courts should make Interlocutory
orders upon hearing the â¢ testimony In di
vorce cases and file with the County
Clerk their findings of the facts therein.
These findings are open to amendment or
may be appealed from six months after
their Issuance, but a final decree of di
vorce cannot be granted until a year from
the date of the recording of the court's
finding.
TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS.
The constitutionality of the amendment
to the Civil Code relative to judicial
procedure in divorce cases which was
passed by the last Legislature Is now be
fore the Supremo Court for confirmation
or adverse decision. The arguments in
the case of Frank C. Deyoe against the
Superior Court of Mendoclno County,
which was appealed to the Supreme
Court, was submitted yesterday, and the
test of the law Is now in the hands of the
Justices. '
Amendment of Legislature
Must Stand Test in Su
preme Court.
Constitutionality of the
Code Revision Is at
Stake. â¢.
LAWYERS ARGUE
ON DIVORCE LAW
THE SAN FEAK CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 1903.
The law of divorce is a distinct branch of
the law and the objects of such proceedings
Justify Us classification -a* a special act. The
evils cannot be avoided and the objects.accom
plished by any other method of Judicial pro
cedure and consequently special laws are nec
essary.
The laws regulating procedure in actions for
divorce are not special laws merely because
they are made applicable only to such actions.
The ultimate object of divorce proceedings la
not to postpone remarriage but to prevent such
action pending the time when an appeal may
be made.
H. S. G. McCartney of Los Angeles ar
gued for the constitutionality of the
amendment in part as follows:
( NAPA, Aug. 6.â George E. Goodman
Jr.. until recently teller of the James H.
Goodman & Co. Bank in this city, died
at his residence in Xapa {his morning
from consumption. He was a son of
George E. Goodman, president of the local
bank and a director in the Bank of Cali
fornia and other San Francisco financial
Institutions. He was a native of Cali
fornia, 35 years of. age. He leaves a
widow and one daughter. His wife H
the daughter of the late song writer, Har
rison Mlllard. Goodman was a member
of the Native Sons, of Napa Comman
dery t Knights Templar; of Islam Temple,
Mystic Shrine, and was one of the most
popular young men in this section.
communal property is needlessly complicated
and laid open to fraud.
The entry of the interlocutory order aa pro

LONG SERVICE
REWARDED WITH
HIGH HONORS
Part of the plans of the Harriman-Ham
mond combine Is to â¢ run the line north
ward by way of; Marshfleld or Empire
City In Oregon.. from one of which places
an' easterly, branch- will be constructed so
as to tap the â¢ lower part of the Willam
ette Valley - and J connect with the . main
line of the Southern Pacific at Roseburg.
A survey of .this branch Is., already In
progress,/ a party of surveyors â¢ having
been sent north about six' weeks ago 'for
this purpose.' "
A recent announcement that a party of
surveyors were at work on a proposed
line from Granta Pass southwesterly, to
Crescent City has given -rise to a suspi
cion - that the Harriraan syndicate was
really behind tho undertaking, but it Is
now learned from a.most reliable source
that , the engineer department of the
Southern Pacific Company has condemned
In extending the Hammond road north
ward from Crescent City Harriman will
penetrate the richest- redwood district in
the Western world. It lies along the
coast between Humboldt Bay and the
northern boundary of the State and. is
absolutely controlled by Hammond and
those who are associated with him In the
Hammond Lumber Company. On the
Oregon* side of the coast route the pro
posed line will extend through rich tracts
of fir and; pine,. and farther north, In the
territory through which the Hammond
line running southward out of Astoria is
laid, another valuable timber belt will be
encountered. . - <-
RICH REDWOOD DISTRICT.
Of the reported alliance with Harri
man, Hammond looked troubled, and then
said that he and the railroad president
were good friends, emphasizing the con
fession with a significant smile.
"Well, we have been thinking for a long
time of extending our northern lines and
possibly may carry- out the plan."
Although A. B. Hammond, when seen
yesterday regarding these facts, declined
to confirm them, he could not be in
duced to deny them, apparently realizing
that his Interviewer had possessed him
self of Information that could not very
well be refuted.- As a matter of fact,
at the very moment the reporter called
upon Hammond he was engaged In con
ference with engineers of the Harriman
lines and a number of contractors who
are figuring on the contemplated work.
When asked point blank if it was not a
fact that he was working In harmony
with Harriman and that plans for the
work mentioned was receiving his daily
consideration the lumber king paused for
a time, then tried to evade the questions
by endeavoring to interest his interviewer
in a map of the rich timber tracts of
Humboldt County, but finally reluctantly
said:
CONFERS WITH ENGINEERS.
Should Harriman win he will Imme
diately proceed to make connections with
Eureka from Arcata. The. necessary
grading has already been done and all
that will be necessary will be to lay the
rails, which were landed at Eureka two
weeks ago from the steamer Francis H.
Leggett. Pending the settlement of this
legal question, however, Harriman Is not
wasting time, and through Hammond he
Is preparing to extend the newly acquired
road north of Eureka on to Crescent City.
Within the last few weeks parties of
surveyors ' have been hurrying their work
over the proposed extension, a distance of
about thirty-five miles, and grading is ex
pected to begin shortly.
Meanwhile : Harriman has entered Into
an agreement with Hammond to secure
control of the lumberman's road running
south from Astoria and is said to have
assured the o"wner that he will- not
want for the necessary funds to con
tinue the road farther south. In fact,
plans for this work are already prepared
and are now In the office of Hammond in
the Hayward building, where, for sev
eral days, contractors have been looking
them over with the idea of giving esti
mates on the cost of the work. Harri
man's engineers have also been visiting
Hammond's office and holding long con
ferences with the lumberman and his as
sociates concerning the proposed exten
sion of the Washington road and the line
running northward " from Arcata toward
Eureka,
people carried the matter Into the courts,
where it has remained ever since. When
tho Santa Fe Company absorbed the Eu
reka and Eel River road it naturally in
herited this litigation and Harriman also
became a party to It when he Interested
himself with Hammond in the opposition
road. The case is to come up -shortly in
the courts of Eureka and will be bitterly
fought, although the Harriman people
are sanguine of victory, claiming that
their side of the case is well supported
by the existing agreement.
Â£f : NOT WASTING TIME.
Before this latter connection can be
made a bitter fight In the courts between
the Santa Fe and the Harriman-Ham
niond interests will have to be settled.
It is a case that involves the right of
way .into the town of Eureka and the lit
igation which has developed was inherited
by the Harriman syndicate and the Santa
Fe Company In their efforts to beat each
other into that important lumber shipping
point. The Eureka and Eel River road
extends around the inner side of - the
shore of Humboldt Bay to Eureka, while
the Hammond road runs southwest from
Arcata down the peninsula that forms
the outer side of the bay. Some years
ago the Hammond interests, desiring to
reach Eureka by rail instead of having
to cross the bay with the product of their
lumber mill, which is situated on the
peninsula, entered into an agreement with
the Eureka and Eel River road by which
the former could use a certain portion of
the tracks and a tunnel just outside the
town of Eureka. Later the Eureka and
Eel River road, bo it was alleged, repudi
ated this agreement and the Hammond
BITTER LEGAL BATTLE.
It was learned yesterday that the pre
liminary plans for the new route to tho
north are already in this city and copies
of them, are in the hands of A. B. Ham
mond, the lumber king, who is working
in harmony with the Southern Pacific
magnate in assuring the success of the
project. The first step was taken some
weeks ago, when the Southern Pacific
Company secured an option on the Ham
mond road running north from Arcata
thirty odd miles toward Crescent
City. It is purposed to extern! this
road as fast as possible to Crescent City
and eventually connect it with the town
of Eureka.
E. H. Harriman, head of thÂ© syndicate
which controls the California Northwest
ern Railway, is planning to make that
road part of - a coast system that will
eventually have its northern terminus at
Astoria, where direct connections will be
made with the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company's line. The extension of
the local road to the State of "Washing
ton is not a project contemplated for the
far future, but is actually under con
sideration. Engineers of the Harriman
syndicate are already engaged in defin
ing the route and estimating the cost of
and the time that will be necessary to
carry out the enterprise.

The right of the original locators to change
their original location so long as such change
does not Interfere with the existing rights of
others acquired previous to such change is
unquestioned. The amended certificate of loca
tion -when made, becomes the completed loca
tion of the discoverer and is Just as valid
as If It had been made In the first Instanftf.
W. E. F. Deal. Kenneth M. Jackson
and Campbell. Metson & Campbell were
the attorneys for the successful parties
to the suit.
"When a valid location' of a mining: claim
In once made it veÂ«'.s in the locator and his
successors tn interest the right of possession
thereto which right cannot be divested by
the obiiRÂ»tlon or removal, without the fault
of the locator or his successor in Interest, of
the stakes and monuments marking Its bound
aries or of the obliteration or removal from
the 'claim of the location notices posted
thereon.
The main plea of the complainant was
that in many Instances Butler's boundary
stakes were not to be found, and also
that his amended notice varied from that
first placed by him In the rusty tomato
can on the ridge. To this , argument
Judge Hawley gave the following answer:
STAKES WERE MISSING.
It wan on August 30, 1900, that Butler
put up his location notices in a rusty
tomato can on the top of the gold ribbed
ridge. On March 20. 1901. the company
which Butler had formed tiled in the Land
Office at Carson an amended notice of lo
cation, embracing eight consolidated
claims. But the news of the strike had
brought a rush to the new fields and the
Tonopah and Salt Lake Company staked
its claims so that in part they were co
incident with the ground staked out in
the amended notice of Butler's Tonopah
Mining Company. -
In reviewing the three suits Judge Haw
ley announced that testimony taken in
either of them which was applicable to
any one or both of the other suits would
be allowed to stand for all three. De
spite this short cut. his Honor had to
weigh an almost limitless amount of con-*
flicting evidence concerning boundary
stakes and location notices before he
could render his decision.
Upon finally "prospecting" the rough
rocks there came to the penniless miner
the vision of his sudden -wealth, and rac
ing back to the desert he staked the
claims which were destined to yield him
a fortune.
ROCK PROVES RICH. ,
A mining suit Involving Tonopah min
eral lands valued at a figure well Into
the million* was settled on Monday In
Carson, Kev., by the decision of United
States Circuit Judge Hawley. The Ton
opah Mining Company, of which J. L.
Butler, the original discoverer of the new
El Dorado, is the heaviest stockholder,
gained the decision over the Tonopah and
Salt Lake Mining Company In the legal
struggle for the possession of the richest
portions of the Butler group of mines.
The suit was brought upon an adverse
claim and a protest entered in the United
States Land Office at Carson against the
application of Butler's company for a
parent to a cens lid .ted claln embracing
eight locations. The complainants in the
suit alleged that two of Butler's claims,
the Valley View and the Silver Top,
overlapped their several locations known
as the Pyramid, the Wandering Boy and
the Stone Cabin. Upon these grounds
they brought the suit which has been de
cided acalnst them.
Into the suit' there was introduced the
story of the romantic discovery of the
rich Tonooah ledges by Butler. While
riding throush the desert In the summer
of 1900 the lucky prospector carelessly
picked up a sack full of specimens from
the bleak ridge In the sand and left them
unheeded in his house for weeks.
